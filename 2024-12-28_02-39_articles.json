                "content": "Rescue teams ended a search on Friday for a 51-year-old man who fell overboard from the Norwegian Epic cruise ship en route to the Bahamas, less than 24 hours after he was reported missing. A spokesperson for Norwegian Cruise Line told NPR that the man was reported missing at around 3 p.m. local time on Thursday as the ship was sailing from Ocho Rios, Jamaica, to Nassau, Bahamas. A search and rescue operation was quickly carried out, but the mission grew complicated once the sun set just hours later. \"After an extensive search that was unfortunately unsuccessful, the ship was released by the authorities and continued its voyage,\" the spokesperson for Norwegian said. \"The guest was traveling with a large group and his family on board is being attended to and supported during this very challenging situation. Our thoughts and prayers are with his loved ones during this difficult time.\" The circumstances of the man's fall were not immediately clear. The tragedy marks the 19th overboard incident aboard a cruise ship this year, according to Cruise Junkie — the most recent being less than a week ago. On Saturday, a 48-year-old woman died after trying to jump overboard from a Princess Cruises ship en route back to Florida after traveling around the Caribbean. The woman died from injuries sustained after inadvertently falling onto a lower deck 10 stories below. In November 2022, a 28-year-old man who fell overboard from a Carnival Valor cruise ship was rescued off of Louisiana's southeast coast after treading water for nearly 20 hours. Copyright 2024 NPR",

                "content": "The search for a Norwegian Cruise Line passenger who went overboard Thursday on the way to the Bahamas on a ship sailing out of Port Canaveral has been called off. A 51-year-old man, who has not been identified, went overboard on the Norwegian Epic around 3 p.m. on a seven-night Western Caribbean trip that left the Florida coast on Dec. 21, according to Cruise Hive. Another nearby cruise ship joined in the search operations but the cruise line confirmed to Cruise Hive that the search ended Thursday evening. “The authorities were immediately notified, and a search and rescue operation under the guidance and oversight of the Bahamas Rescue Coordination Center went underway,\" a Norwegian Cruise Line spokesperson told Cruise Hive. \"After an extensive search that was unfortunately unsuccessful, the ship was released by the authorities to continue its voyage.“ In 2018, an unidentified woman fell off the Norwegian Epic near the Bahamas but was rescued during a night search. Here's what we know. The name of the passenger has not yet been released. It was a 51-year-old man, and according to onboard announcements he was wearing a blue shirt. The Norwegian Cruise Line spokesperson said the man was traveling with a large group. \"His family on board is being attended to and supported during this very challenging situation,\" they said. \"The guest was traveling with a large group and his family on board is being attended to and supported during this very challenging situation,\" a spokesperson for Norwegian Cruise Line said in a statement to USA TODAY. \"Our thoughts and prayers are with his loved ones during this difficult time.” The Norwegian Epic was sailing northbound from Ocho Rios, Jamaica en route to Great Stirrup Cay in the Bahamas. The ship immediately stopped and began search and rescue operations, and it was joined by Holland America Line’s Zuiderdam ship out of Port Everglades, according to Cruise Hive. The Norwegian Epic had already seen \"multiple medical incidents\" during the current sailing, Cruise Hive reported, but they were not related to this incident. Man overboard!How easy is it to fall overboard on a cruise ship, and how can you survive? The Norwegian Epic ― which was built in 2010 and refurbished in 2020 ― can accommodate 4,100 passengers, based on double occupancy of its cabins, and has 1,724 crew members. It has 19 decks, is 1,081 feet long and is 155,873 gross tons. It previously sailed from Italy and Spain on Mediterranean cruises, but was brought to Port Canaveral for the 2023-2024 winter season to accommodate the growing demand for Caribbean sailings, the company said last year.

                "title": "Search Abandoned For Cruise Ship Passenger Who Went Overboard - Newsweek",
                "content": "The search for a cruise passenger who went overboard en route to the Bahamas has been abandoned. The search was abandoned on Thursday night after a 51-year-old man, who has not been named, fell overboard at approximately 3 p.m. earlier that day. The man had been on board Norwegian Cruise Line's Norwegian Epic, sailing northbound from Ocho Rios, Jamaica, to Great Stirrup Cay in the Bahamas when he went overboard. \"The authorities were immediately notified, and a search and rescue operation under the guidance and oversight of the Bahamas Rescue Coordination Center went underway,\" a Norwegian Cruise Line spokesperson told Cruise Hive. \"After an extensive search that was unfortunately unsuccessful, the ship was released by the authorities to continue its voyage,\" the spokesperson added. Newsweek has contacted Norwegian Cruise Line for comment via email. The search was called off after search and rescue teams failed to find the man. Cruise Hive reported that with sunset in the Bahamas on December 26 at 5:18 p.m., there were only a couple hours of strong daylight available for the search operation to take place before it became more difficult. The ship has been cleared by the U.S. Coast Guard to continue with the cruise. It is currently not clear why the man went overboard. Norwegian Cruise Line said search and rescue operations were initiated immediately, with the ship diverted and a flare tossed into the water to mark the ship's position at the first report of the overboard. Holland America Line's Zuiderdam was also nearby and joined the search. The man who went overboard was traveling with a large group, including his family, a spokesperson said. The man's family members are now being \"attended to and supported during this very challenging situation,\" the spokesperson added. Cruise Hive reported that onboard announcements told passengers that the individual who went overboard was wearing a blue shirt at the time of their fall. Norwegian Epic is currently on a seven-night Western Caribbean voyage after departing from Canaveral, Florida, on Saturday. The incident comes amid several cruise ship accidents this year. It is estimated that 19 people go overboard on cruise ships each year, and only around four people are rescued. Meanwhile, Norwegian Epic has had multiple medical incidents aboard the current sailing, with ambulances stationed to meet the ship at its first port of call, Cozumel, Mexico, on Monday, December 23, as well as at Ocho Rios on Christmas Day. So far in 2024, at least 19 people have gone overboard on cruise ships, only two of whom survived. The incidents, which occurred on various cruise lines and locations worldwide, involved both passengers and crew members. The last incident occurred just days ago when Elizabeth McElmurray, 48, died on the Sky Princess on December 21 as it returned to Florida from the Caribbean. Princess Cruises said she fell while trying to \"jump\" into the water, inadvertently landing on one of the cruise ship decks 10 stories below. Just days earlier, on December 17, Royal Caribbean's Vision of the Seas issued a code OSCAR, signaling an overboard situation. At the time, the ship was nearing the end of a 12-night Southern Caribbean itinerary. Meanwhile, on December 2, a male passenger was reported missing and believed overboard from Princess Cruises' Ruby Princess as the ship returned to San Francisco at the end of a 5-night itinerary that had included visits to San Diego and Ensenada. The ship will now continue its voyage to the Bahamas. Search and rescue operations have now ceased.

The unidentified passenger fell from the Norwegian Epic around 3 p.m. Thursday while the ship sailed from Ocho Rios, Jamaica, to Great Stirrup Cay in the Bahamas. “The authorities were immediately notified, and a search and rescue operation under the guidance and oversight of the Bahamas Rescue Coordination Center went underway,” a Norwegian Cruise Line spokesperson told The Post. After an “extensive” but ultimately unsuccessful search, which involved the help of another nearby cruise ship, the Norwegian Epic “was released by the authorities to continue its voyage,” the cruise line said. It was not immediately clear how the passenger went overboard. He was traveling with a large group that included his family, who are being “attended to and supported during this very challenging situation,” the cruise line said. “Our thoughts and prayers are with his loved ones during this difficult time,” the spokesperson said. Immediately after the passenger went overboard, the ship dropped a flare in the ocean to mark its location where the man fell and circled the area repeatedly, according to Cruise Hive. Holland America Line’s ship Zuiderdam, which was sailing nearby, joined in the search. Video from a Norwegian Epic passenger posted on social media shows passengers on their balconies scouring the sea for any sign of the man.

                "title": "Vivek Ramaswamy - Wikipedia",
                "content": "Vivek Ganapathy Ramaswamy (/vɪˈveɪk rɑːməˈswɑːmiː/;[1][2] vih-VAYK rah-mə-SWAH-mee; born August 9, 1985) is an American entrepreneur and politician. He founded Roivant Sciences, a pharmaceutical company, in 2014. In February 2023, Ramaswamy declared his candidacy for the Republican Party nomination in the 2024 United States presidential election. He suspended his campaign in January 2024, after finishing fourth in the Iowa caucuses and endorsed Trump. On November 12, 2024, President-elect Donald Trump announced that Ramaswamy and businessman Elon Musk had been tasked to lead the newly proposed Department of Government Efficiency. Ramaswamy was born in Cincinnati to Indian immigrant parents. He graduated from Harvard University with a bachelor's degree in biology and later earned a degree from Yale Law School. Ramaswamy worked as an investment partner at a hedge fund before founding Roivant Sciences. He also co-founded an investment firm, Strive Asset Management. Ramaswamy sees the United States in the middle of a national identity crisis precipitated by what he calls \"new secular religions like COVID-ism, climate-ism, and gender ideology\". He is also a critic of environmental, social, and corporate governance initiatives (ESG).[3] In January 2024, Forbes estimated Ramaswamy's net worth at more than $960 million; his wealth comes from biotech and financial businesses.[4][5] Vivek Ganapathy Ramaswamy was born on August 9, 1985, in Cincinnati, Ohio, to Indian Hindu immigrant parents.[6][7][8][9][10] His parents are Tamil-speaking Brahmins from Kerala.[6][11][12] His father, V. Ganapathy Ramaswamy, a graduate of the National Institute of Technology Calicut, worked as an engineer and patent attorney for General Electric, while his mother, Geetha Ramaswamy, a graduate of the Mysore Medical College & Research Institute, worked as a geriatric psychiatrist.[6][13] His parents immigrated from Palakkad district in Kerala,[14][15] where the family had an ancestral home in a traditional agraharam in the town of Vadakkencherry.[14][16][17] Ramaswamy was raised in Ohio.[18] Growing up, Ramaswamy often attended the local Hindu temple in Dayton with his family.[19] His conservative Christian piano teacher, who gave him private lessons from elementary through high school, also influenced his social views.[6] He spent many summer vacations traveling to India with his parents.[16] In high school, Ramaswamy was a nationally ranked tennis player.[20] Ramaswamy attended public schools through eighth grade.[6][21] He then attended Cincinnati's St. Xavier High School, a Catholic school affiliated with the Jesuit order,[6][22] graduating as valedictorian in 2003.[6][23] In 2007, Ramaswamy graduated from Harvard University with a Bachelor of Arts, summa cum laude, in biology, and was a member of Phi Beta Kappa.[24] At Harvard, he gained a reputation as a brash and confident libertarian.[25] He was a member of the Harvard Political Union,[26] becoming its president.[6] He told The Harvard Crimson that he considered himself a contrarian who loved to debate.[26] While in college, he performed Eminem covers and libertarian-themed rap music under the stage name and alter ego \"Da Vek\",[6][27][28] and was an intern for the hedge fund Amaranth Advisors and the investment bank Goldman Sachs.[6] He wrote his senior thesis on the ethical questions raised by creating human-animal chimeras and earned a Bowdoin Prize.[24] In 2011, Ramaswamy was awarded a post-graduate fellowship by the Paul & Daisy Soros Fellowships for New Americans.[29][30] In 2023 Ramaswamy paid an editor to remove this from his Wikipedia entry.[31][32] Later, Ramaswamy said that by the time he attended Yale, he was already wealthy from his activities in the finance, pharmaceutical, and biotech industries; he said in 2023 that he had a net worth of around $15 million before graduating from law school.[25] At Yale he befriended fellow Ohio native and future U.S. vice president–elect JD Vance.[33][24] He earned a Juris Doctor in 2013. In a 2023 interview, Ramaswamy said that he was a member of the campus Jewish intellectual discussion society Shabtai while a law student.[34] In 2007, Ramaswamy and Travis May co-founded Campus Venture Network, which published a private social networking website for university students who aspired to launch a business.[35] The company was sold to the nonprofit Ewing Marion Kauffman Foundation in 2009.[36] Ramaswamy worked at the hedge fund QVT Financial from 2007 to 2014.[6][37][38][39] He was a partner and co-managed the firm's biotech portfolio.[37][38][36] QVT's biotech investments under Ramaswamy included stakes in Palatin Technologies,[36] Concert Pharmaceuticals,[36] Pharmasset,[40][41] and Martin Shkreli's Retrophin.[42] In a 2023 speech and in his book Woke Inc., Ramaswamy called Shkreli, whose company had greatly increased the cost of a life-saving drug, both \"brilliant\" and a pathological liar. He criticized the U.S. Department of Justice for prosecuting Shkreli, calling his fraud a victimless crime.[42] In 2014, Ramaswamy founded the biotechnology firm Roivant Sciences; the \"Roi\" in the company's name refers to return on investment.[39] The company was incorporated in Bermuda, a tax haven, and received almost $100 million in start-up capital from QVT and other investors,[39] including RA Capital Management, Visium Asset Management, and the hedge fund managers D. E. Shaw & Co. and Falcon Edge Capital.[36] Roivant's strategy was to purchase patents from larger pharmaceutical companies for drugs that had not yet been successfully developed, and then bring them to the market.[39] The company created numerous subsidiaries,[40][43] including Dermavant (focused on dermatology), Urovant (focused on urological disease), and China-based Sinovant and Cytovant, focused on the Asian market.[40][44] In 2015, Ramaswamy raised $360 million for the Roivant subsidiary Axovant Sciences in an attempt to market intepirdine as a drug for Alzheimer's disease.[38][45] In December 2014,[46] Axovant purchased the patent for intepirdine from GlaxoSmithKline (where the drug had failed four previous clinical trials) for $5 million, a small sum in the industry.[39] Ramaswamy appeared on the cover of Forbes in 2015, and said his company would \"be the highest return on investment endeavor ever taken up in the pharmaceutical industry.\"[39][45] Before new clinical trials began, he engineered an initial public offering (IPO) in Axovant.[39] Axovant became a \"Wall Street darling\" and raised $315 million in its IPO.[46] The company's market value initially soared to almost $3 billion, although at the time it only had eight employees, including Ramaswamy's brother and mother.[39] Ramaswamy took a massive payout after selling a portion of his shares in Roivant to Viking Global Investors.[39] He claimed more than $37 million in capital gains in 2015.[39] Ramaswamy said his company would be the \"Berkshire Hathaway of drug development\"[6] and touted the drug as a \"tremendous\" opportunity that \"could help millions\" of patients, prompting some criticism that he was overpromising.[39] In September 2017, the company announced that intepirdine had failed in its large clinical trial.[39][47] The company's value plunged; it lost 75% in one day and continued to decline afterward.[39] Shareholders who lost money included various institutional investors, such as the California State Teachers' Retirement System pension fund.[39] Ramaswamy was insulated from much of Axovant's losses because he held his stake through Roivant.[39][46] The company abandoned intepirdine. In 2018, Ramaswamy said he had no regrets about how the company handled the drug;[46] in subsequent years, he said he regretted the outcome but was annoyed by criticism of the company.[39] Axovant attempted to reinvent itself as a gene therapy company,[48] but dissolved in 2023.[39] In 2017, Roivant partnered with the private equity arm of the Chinese state-owned CITIC Group to form Sinovant.[49][50][51] In 2017, Ramaswamy struck a deal with Masayoshi Son in which SoftBank invested $1.1 billion in Roivant.[39] In 2019, Roivant sold its stake in five subsidiaries (or \"vants\"), including Enzyvant, to Sumitomo Dainippon Pharma;[39][52] Ramaswamy made $175 million in capital gains from the sale.[39] The deal also gave Sumitomo Dainippon a 10% stake in Roivant.[52][53] While campaigning for the presidency, Ramaswamy called himself a \"scientist\" and said, \"I developed a number of medicines.\"[39] His undergraduate degree is in biology, but he was never a scientist; his role in the biotechnology industry was that of a financier and entrepreneur.[39] In January 2021, Ramaswamy stepped down as CEO of Roivant Sciences and assumed the role of executive chairman.[52][53] In 2021, after he resigned as CEO, Roivant was listed on the Nasdaq via a reverse merger with Montes Archimedes Acquisition Corp, a special purpose acquisition vehicle.[54] In February 2023, Ramaswamy stepped down as chair of Roivant to focus on his presidential campaign.[39][55] Ramaswamy remains the sixth-largest shareholder of Roivant,[39] retaining a 7.17% stake.[7] During Ramaswamy's time running Roivant the company had never been profitable.[54] In 2020, when Ramaswamy was CEO of Roivant Sciences, the company established a nonprofit social-impact arm, Roivant Social Ventures (RSV), with his support.[55] An earlier iteration of RSV, the Roivant Foundation, was created in 2018.[56] Although Ramaswamy's presidential campaign centers on opposing corporate diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) and environmental, social, and corporate governance (ESG) initiatives, RSV worked in support of pro-DEI and ESG initiatives, including promoting health equity and diversity within the biopharma and biotech industries.[55] While campaigning, Ramaswamy has downplayed his role in creating and overseeing RSV.[55] In 2020, Ramaswamy co-founded Chapter Medicare, a Medicare navigation platform.[57] He served on the Ohio COVID-19 Response Team.[32] He was chairman of OnCore Biopharma, a position he maintained at Tekmira Pharmaceuticals when the two companies merged in March 2015.[58] He also was chair of the board of Arbutus Biopharma, a Canadian firm.[36] In May 2024, Ramaswamy acquired a 7.7% stake in BuzzFeed,[59] later increased to 8.4%, making him the second-largest Class A shareholder in the company.[60] Soon after the acquisition, he sent a letter to the company's board of directors, in which he suggested they hire conservative pundits such as Candace Owens, Tucker Carlson, and Bill Maher, as well as three \"high-profile directors, with strong track business records in new media\" whom he knew.[61] Analysts have predicted that his direction could seriously shift BuzzFeed's content and editorial approach. In early 2022, together with his high school friend Anson Frericks,[62] Ramaswamy co-founded Strive Asset Management, a Columbus, Ohio-based asset management firm.[63] The firm raised about $20 million from outside investors,[54] including Peter Thiel, JD Vance, and Bill Ackman.[6][64][65] Strive has branded itself as \"anti-woke\" and its funds as \"anti-ESG\"; Ramaswamy has claimed that the largest asset managers, such as BlackRock, State Street, and Vanguard, mix business with ESG politics to the detriment of their funds' investors.[6][66][67] Pension fund managers take account of ESG in the assessment of long-term risk, including climate risks, when making portfolio decisions.[6][68] Ramaswamy has crusaded against ESG[15][68] and emphasizes the doctrine of shareholder primacy, famously articulated by Milton Friedman.[6] In his book Woke, Inc.: Inside Corporate America's Social Justice Scam and elsewhere, he has depicted private corporations' socially conscious investing as simultaneously ineffective and the greatest threat to American society.[6] He published a second book, Nation of Victims: Identity Politics, the Death of Merit, and the Path Back to Excellence, in September 2022, a few months before announcing his presidential candidacy.[69] Strive's flagship fund, the exchange-traded fund DRLL, launched in 2022 as an \"anti-woke\" energy sector index fund.[70][71] Ramaswamy said that Strive would push energy companies to drill for more oil, frack for more natural gas, and \"do whatever allows them to be most successful over the long run without regard to political, social, cultural or environmental agendas.\"[72] In October 2022, Ramaswamy held closed-door meetings with South Carolina lawmakers in a session arranged by state treasurer Curtis Loftis; during the meetings, Ramaswamy pitched Strive to manage South Carolina pension funds.[73] In June 2023, after The Post and Courier reported on the meetings, the sessions were criticized as a form of unregistered lobbying; Ramaswamy's campaign manager denied any impropriety.[73] Ramaswamy was Strive's executive chairman[6][64][65] before resigning in February 2023 to focus on his presidential campaign.[63][74] On November 12, 2024, President-elect Donald Trump announced that Ramaswamy and businessman Elon Musk had been tasked to lead the newly proposed Department of Government Efficiency.[75] Ramaswamy said that he voted for Michael Badnarik, the Libertarian Party presidential nominee in 2004, but did not vote in the presidential elections in 2008, 2012, or 2016.[76] He described himself as apolitical during this period.[77] He supported Donald Trump in the 2020 election.[76][77] In November 2021, Ramaswamy registered to vote in Franklin County, Ohio, as \"unaffiliated\", but described himself as a Republican.[76] Ramaswamy has made political contributions to both Democrats and Republicans. In 2016, he donated $2,700 to the campaign of Dena Grayson, a Florida Democrat running for Congress.[76] From 2020 to 2023, he donated $30,000 to the Ohio Republican Party.[40] Ramaswamy considered running in the 2022 U.S. Senate election in Ohio.[78] On February 21, 2023, Ramaswamy declared his candidacy for the Republican nomination for president of the United States in 2024 on Tucker Carlson Tonight.[79] He publicly released 20 years of his individual income tax returns and called upon his rivals in the primary to do the same.[39][65] His fortune had made up the vast majority of his campaign's fundraising.[54] From February to July 2023, Ramaswamy loaned his campaign more than $15 million; his campaign ended the second quarter of 2023 with about $9 million in cash on hand.[80] His fundraising lagged far behind Trump's and Ron DeSantis's, but ahead of most of the other Republican primary candidates'.[80] During his campaign for the Republican presidential nomination, Ramaswamy sought to appeal to evangelical Christian right and Christian nationalist voters, an important part of the Republican base, some of whom are reluctant or unwilling to support a non-Christian presidential candidate such as Ramaswamy, who is Hindu.[19] In campaign stops and interviews, Ramaswamy had criticized secularism,[19] saying that the U.S. was founded on Christian values[19] or Judeo-Christian values;[81] that he shares those values;[19][81] and that he believes in one God.[19] While campaigning, Ramaswamy called himself an \"unapologetic American nationalist\";[82] he often attacked DeSantis but avoided directly criticizing Trump.[82][83] In May 2023, Ramaswamy's campaign admitted that he had paid an editor to alter his Wikipedia biography before announcing his candidacy, but denied that the payment for edits was politically motivated.[32][84][85] The edits to the Wikipedia biography removed references to Ramaswamy's postgraduate fellowship from the Paul & Daisy Soros Fellowship for New Americans, as well as his involvement with the Ohio COVID-19 Response Team.[32][84] Paul and Daisy Soros are the elder brother and sister-in-law, respectively, of businessman and social activist George Soros, who has been the subject of numerous conspiracy theories among American conservatives and rightists.[86][84] Ramaswamy's campaign denied attempting to \"scrub\" his Wikipedia page and argued the edits were revisions of \"factual distortions\".[32][84] In January, after finishing fourth in the Iowa caucuses, Ramaswamy ended his campaign and endorsed Donald Trump.[87][88] For the remainder of the 2024 U.S. presidential election, Ramaswamy served the Trump campaign as a political surrogate,[89] representing the Trump campaign and attending campaign events in place of the candidate.[90][91] Ramaswamy sees the United States in the middle of a national identity crisis precipitated by what he calls \"new secular religions like COVID-ism, climate-ism, and gender ideology\".[92] Although they were running against each other for the 2024 Republican nomination, Ramaswamy vocally supported Trump.[93] After Trump was indicted on federal criminal charges in 2023, Ramaswamy immediately rallied behind him.[94] He promised to pardon Trump if elected president.[93][95] He also promised to pardon Julian Assange, Ross Ulbricht, and Edward Snowden.[96][97][98] He suggested that he considered Robert F. Kennedy Jr. as a possible running mate.[25][99] Ramaswamy opposed affirmative action,[100] and vowed to rescind Executive Order 11246.[101] He argued that American-style capitalism provides an antidote to India's caste system.[6] He asserted that critical race theory has indoctrinated students in public schools.[102] Ramaswamy opposed abortion,[103] terming it \"murder\".[104] He supported state-level six-week abortion bans, with exceptions for rape, incest, and danger to the woman's life, but opposes a federal ban.[103][105] Ramaswamy called the LGBTQ movement a \"cult\".[106] He said through a spokesman that he believes same-sex marriage is \"settled precedent\"[107] but supported broad restrictions on the rights of transgender Americans, and used anti-trans rhetoric.[108] Ramaswamy pledged, if elected, to rule by executive fiat[25] to a degree unprecedented among modern U.S. presidents.[109] He pledged to fire 75% of federal employees;[110] dismantle civil service protections, making federal employment at-will;[111] and abolish at least five federal agencies,[112] including the Education Department, FBI, ATF, IRS, Nuclear Regulatory Commission, and USDA's Food and Nutrition Service.[112][113] He called the Food and Drug Administration \"corrupt\" and vowed to \"expose and ultimately gut\" the FDA.[114] He asserted that the president has the unilateral power to abolish agencies by executive order,[115] although executive agencies and departments are created by statute, and under the Constitution, Congress has the power of the purse.[25] He called for an eight-year term for all government employees and pledged to revoke Executive Order 10988, an order issued by President John F. Kennedy that gives federal employees the right to collectively bargain.[111] He proposed to repeal the federal law that requires presidents to spend all the money Congress appropriates.[25] Ramaswamy favored raising the standard voting age to 25, which would require repealing the 26th Amendment to the Constitution.[116][117][118] This proposal would have disenfranchised a portion of the U.S. electorate; nearly 9% of voters in the 2020 general election were under 25.[109] Ramaswamy also said he would have liked to end birthright citizenship.[119] He said he would have allow citizens between 18 and 24 to vote only if they are enlisted in the military, work as first responders, or pass the civics test required for naturalization.[117][119][120] He supported making Election Day a federal holiday, while eliminating Juneteenth (which he called \"useless\" and \"redundant\") as a federal holiday.[121] Ramaswamy pledged to \"use our military to annihilate the Mexican drug cartels\".[113] He favored federal legalization of marijuana.[122] He took no public position on the 2017 Trump tax cuts.[123] In a thought experiment he expressed support for an inheritance tax,[76] and called for ending the Federal Reserve's dual mandate,[123] but during his presidential campaign he expressed opposition to an inheritance tax.[124] In Republican primary debates and campaign appearances, Ramaswamy often repeated and promoted an array of right-wing conspiracy theories[125][126] and falsehoods.[127] In the days after the January 6, 2021, attack on the Capitol, he condemned the attack, but argued that social media bans on Trump violate the First Amendment.[18][128] Later, while running for president, Ramaswamy repeatedly claimed that the January 6 attack \"was an inside job\", a claim supported by no evidence and refuted by numerous investigations.[125][129] He also asserted that \"big tech\" stole the 2020 election and that the \"Great Replacement\" conspiracy theory was \"the Democratic Party's platform\".[125] Invoking September 11 conspiracy theories, he asked whether \"federal agents were on the planes\" that hit the Twin Towers during the September 11 attacks.[130][131][132] When asked about some of his past remarks, Ramaswamy frequently denied making the comments or claimed to have been misquoted, even when those denials were belied by recordings, transcripts, or extracts from his writing.[127] Ramaswamy said he would not have used U.S. military force against Iran.[133] In November 2023, he condemned Azerbaijan's military operation against the Armenian population of Nagorno-Karabakh and said that the U.S. should block all its military aid to Azerbaijan.[134] Ramaswamy said he favored \"some major concessions to Russia, including freezing those current lines of control in a Korean-war style armistice agreement\" to end the Russo-Ukrainian War.[135] He favored ending U.S. military aid to Ukraine, excluding Ukraine from NATO, and allowing Russia to remain in occupied regions of Ukraine in exchange for an agreement that Russia end its alliance with China.[136][137] He expressed support for Taiwanese independence,[138] and floated the idea of \"putting a gun in every Taiwanese household\" to deter an invasion by China, but said the U.S. should not militarily defend Taiwan from Chinese attack after the U.S. has achieved \"semiconductor independence\", which he pledged to achieve by 2028.[139][140] Ramaswamy is pro-Israel and calls Israel \"a Divine nation, charged with a Divine purpose\".[141] Ramaswamy has said Israel should feel free to oppose the two-state solution.[142][143] After Hamas's October 7, 2023, attack on Israel, Ramaswamy supported Israel's right to defend itself and to make its own decisions while suggesting that the U.S. should provide a \"diplomatic Iron Dome\" for Israel. [144] Regarding the U.S. aid to Israel, he said that it should be contingent upon Israel's plans for defeating Hamas and its actions in Gaza.[145] Although he said he was not a climate denier,[7] Ramaswamy said in a Republican primary debate that \"the climate change agenda is a hoax\"[146][126] and asserted, falsely, that \"more people are dying from climate policies than actual climate change.\"[147][148] At other times, he said that he accepted that burning fossil fuels causes climate change,[25] but called global climate change \"not entirely bad\";[7] said that \"people should be proud to live a high-carbon lifestyle\";[7] and said that the U.S. should \"drill, frack, burn coal\".[25] He criticized what he calls the \"climate cult\" and said that as president, he would \"abandon the anticarbon framework as it exists\" and halt \"any mandate to measure carbon dioxide\".[149] In 2022, he urged Chevron to increase oil production[150] and criticized its support for a carbon tax.[7] Ramaswamy's company holds a 0.02% stake in Chevron.[150] Ramaswamy opposed subsidies for electric vehicles.[123] In his arguments, Ramaswamy used incorrect statistical claims about the history of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. His critics said that when he cited the upsides of climate change and fossil fuels, such as reduced cold-related deaths, cheap energy, and faster plant growth, he ignored larger downsides, such as increases in other weather-related disasters, deaths, and plant damage, and ignored that there are now less-polluting sources of cheap energy.[151] Ramaswamy's wife, Apoorva Tewari Ramaswamy, is a laryngologist and surgeon; they met at Yale, when he was studying law and she was studying medicine.[6][152] They married in 2015 and have two sons.[6] Ramaswamy has a younger brother, Shankar,[6] who worked for him at Axovant and later co-founded Kriya Therapeutics, a biopharmaceutical company.[153] Ramaswamy is a monotheistic Hindu.[19] According to relatives, he is fluent in Tamil[154][155] and understands (but does not speak) Malayalam.[155] He is a vegetarian and wrote in 2020, \"I believe it is wrong to kill sentient animals for culinary pleasure\".[25][76][156] According to his parents, he has tried to develop a good understanding of both eastern and western culture and traditions.[154][76] In 2023, Ramaswamy's campaign advisor said his net worth was more than $1 billion;[157] Forbes estimated it at more than $950 million.[54] He lived in Manhattan as of 2016.[158] As of 2021, he owned a house in Butler County, Ohio,[18] but in 2023, the only real estate he reported owning was a house in Columbus, Ohio, in Franklin County.[157] A 2023 Politico profile of Ramaswamy mentions him living in a $2 million estate in the Columbus suburb of Upper Arlington.[159]",

                "content": "Manage your account The billionaire bro–far-right civil war is heating up. Former presidential hopeful and “Department of Government Efficiency” co-head Vivek Ramaswamy is the latest in Donald Trump’s inner circle to weigh in on a brewing debate over American workers, triggering a MAGA meltdown in the process. In response to a MAGA-world fight over Tesla CEO and X owner Elon Musk’s call for more skilled immigrant workers, Ramaswamy issued an indictment on American culture deeply rooted in 90s sitcom references. “The reason top tech companies often hire foreign-born & first-generation engineers over 'native' Americans isn’t because of an innate American IQ deficit … A key part of it comes down to the c-word: culture,” Ramaswamy wrote in a Thursday post to X. “Our American culture has venerated mediocrity over excellence for way too long.” “A culture that celebrates the prom queen over the math olympiad champ, or the jock over the valedictorian, will not produce the best engineers,” the billionaire added. “A culture that venerates Cory from ‘Boy Meets World,’ or Zach & Slater over Screech in ‘Saved by the Bell,’ or ‘Stefan’ over Steve Urkel in ‘Family Matters,’ will not produce the best engineers.” Ramaswamy concluded by supporting Musk’s position that skilled immigrant workers can’t simply be banned from entering the country, claiming America needed a cultural shift “rather than wallowing in victimhood & just wishing (or legislating) alternative hiring practices into existence.” The remark earned some ridicule – “Somebody got stuffed in a locker,” CNN panelist Scott Jennings jabbed – but sparked even more far-right fury. “This is one of the most offensive things I’ve read. America and Americans are not mediocre,\" conservative pundit John Cardillo wrote in a post to X. Others took issue with Ramaswamy’s position within the Trump administration, with the billionaire co-heading “DOGE,” the unofficial cost-cutting division announced by Trump last month. “No matter how you slice it, both Musk and Ramaswamy are saying native born Americans just aren’t good enough. That’s a lie and a deeply impropriate thing for any government official to say,” Fox News columnist David Marcus wrote in a Thursday post. Also condemning the suggestion was fellow Indian-American former presidential hopeful Nikki Haley. “There is nothing wrong with American workers or American culture,” Haley responded to Ramaswamy on X. “We should be investing and prioritizing in Americans, not foreign workers.” Ramaswamy wasn’t the only right-wing financier to attract outrage over calls to open up immigration. Musk’s suggestion that there was a shortage of skilled, American-born tech workers led one MAGA influencer to forecast a “divorce” between Musk and Trump’s base.",

                "title": "Vivek Ramaswamy: Eight things Republican presidential candidate believes",
                "content": "Vivek Ramaswamy, the 38-year-old biotech multi-millionaire running for US president, has said he wants to ban \"addictive\" social media for children. \"If you're 16 years old or under, you should not be using an addictive social media product,\" he said at the second debate between Republican candidates. With no previous experience of political office, he has positioned himself as an outsider willing to develop former President Donald Trump's \"America First\" agenda with his own personal spin. That includes some unconventional proposals on everything from abolishing the FBI to ending military aid to Ukraine. Here are eight things he believes. Mr Ramaswamy has criticised social media platforms and described their products as addictive. He even recently called TikTok \"digital fentanyl\". \"I worry about the impact that it has on 12 or 13-year-olds that are using this product that they probably shouldn't be,\" he said. And during the second Republican debate, he called for a ban on children using the platforms in order to, among other things, \"revive... the mental health of this country\". \"This isn't a Republican point or a Democrat point,\" he said. Mr Ramaswamy, however, has been criticised by his Republican opponents for joining TikTok himself just days after he labelled it \"digital fentanyl\". In response, he said the move was an attempt to reach younger voters. Mr Ramaswamy said he wants to \"gut\" the H-1B visa system, which is used by employers to hire skilled foreign workers in the US. The visa is open to people with specialised skills and education and is tied to a job offer. It allows foreign employees to live and work in the US for up to six years, after which it can be renewed. It is also incredibly popular: for 2024, US businesses have already submitted 780,000 visa applications. In a recent statement, Mr Ramaswamy said the visa is \"a form of indentured servitude that only accrues to the benefit of the company,\" and that it needs to be replaced by \"meritocratic admission\". Mr Ramaswamy has come under fire for these comments, particularly because he used the same programme to hire workers for his pharmaceutical company, Roivant Sciences. When asked about this, Mr Ramaswamy said his company played by the current rules of government, and he would reform the visa programme if elected. The US Citizenship and Immigration Services website shows Roivant Sciences has applied for at least 12 visas under the H-1B programme since 2018. Mr Ramaswamy has voiced support for raising the voting age to 25. But under his proposal, those over 18 would be able to vote if they meet a \"national service requirement\", either by being an emergency first responder or by serving for at least six months in the military. \"We must think ambitiously about reviving civic duty in America,\" he said earlier this year. He suggested that those over 18 would also be able to vote if they pass the same test given to those seeking US citizenship. \"I understand not everyone will like this proposal and that it will take persuasion to convince many of its merits, but I'm ready to take that on,\" he said. Raising the voting age would require changing the US Constitution, meaning, among other things, that two-thirds of Congress would need to approve the measure. In a departure from most Western sentiment on the war, Mr Ramaswamy has called for Ukraine to make \"major concessions\" in order to end the conflict. \"What I think we need to do is end the Ukraine war on peaceful terms that, yes, do make some major concessions to Russia, including freezing those current lines of control in a Korean-war style armistice agreement,\" he told ABC News in June. He believes the \"number one threat to the US military\" is the Chinese-Russian alliance, and so called for \"a permanent commitment not to allow Ukraine to enter Nato. But in return, Russia has to leave its treaty and its joint military agreement with China\". Mr Ramaswamy opposes sending aid to Kyiv and instead believes the president should focus on American interests. \"I think that by fighting further in Russia, by further arming Ukraine, we are driving Russia into China's hands.\" he said. Mr Ramaswamy does not support a federal ban on abortion because, in his words, \"the federal government should stay out of it\". He has supported six-week bans on the procedure at state level, however, and described himself as \"unapologetically pro-life\". \"If murder laws are handled at the state level, and abortion is a form of murder, the pro-life view, then it makes no sense for that to be the one federal law,\" he told CNN. Mr Ramaswamy has put forward plans to scrap a number of federal departments including the Department of Education, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, the Internal Revenue Service and the FBI. \"In many cases, these agencies are redundant relative to functions that are already performed elsewhere in the federal government,\" he told NBC News. He has proposed a reorganisation in which the FBI's funding would be distributed instead to the Secret Service, the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network and the Defense Intelligence Agency. Former President Donald Trump, the current frontrunner to win the Republican nomination, has repeatedly attacked the FBI as being part of a \"witch hunt\" against him. And a Fox News poll in June showed public confidence in America's top law enforcement agency had eroded from 80% in 2017 to 59%, mostly among Republicans. Mr Ramaswamy has been widely criticised for remarks he made about the 9/11 attacks in an interview with The Atlantic magazine. \"It is legitimate to say how many police, how many federal agents, were on the planes that hit the Twin Towers,\" he said. \"Maybe the answer is zero. It probably is zero for all I know, right? I have no reason to think it was anything other than zero,\" he continued. \"But if we're doing a comprehensive assessment of what happened... absolutely that should be an answer the public knows the answer to.\" An official bipartisan commission, in a final report published in 2004, established the events of 9/11 and found no evidence of a government plot. Mr Ramaswamy later said he had been misquoted by the magazine, telling CNN: \"The truth is there are lies the government has told about 9/11. But it's not the ones that somebody put in my mouth.\" The Atlantic then published audio which showed his comments had been accurately transcribed. Mr Ramaswamy has said he is in line with his Republican rivals on how to tackle undocumented immigration in the US, arguing they support the militarization of the southern border, defunding so-called \"sanctuary cities\" and ending aid to Mexico and Central America. But during the second Republican presidential debate, Mr Ramaswamy said he would go a \"step further\" than other candidates by \"ending birthright citizenship for the kids of illegal immigrants in this country\". \"Now, the left will howl about the Constitution and the 14th Amendment. The difference between me and them is I've actually read the 14th amendment,\" he added. The 14th amendment - approved in 1866 - grants citizenship to people \"born or naturalized in the United States\". In 1898, the Supreme Court ruled that the amendment applied to any person born in the US regardless of their parents' immigration status. Mr Ramaswamy has claimed in the past that there are \"legally contested questions under the 14th Amendment of whether the child of an illegal immigrant is indeed a child who enjoys birthright citizenship\". At the second debate, he argued children of undocumented immigrants do not deserve citizenship because their parents \"broke the law\" to come to the US.

                "title": "Vivek Ramaswamy | Trump, Education, Department of Government Efficiency, & Family | Britannica",
                "content": "Our editors will review what you’ve submitted and determine whether to revise the article. Vivek Ramaswamy (born August 9, 1985, Cincinnati, Ohio) is an American biotech entrepreneur who drew national attention with his bid for the Republican nomination in the 2024 U.S. presidential election. He first gained notice for his outspoken opposition to environment, social, and governance (ESG) investing, but his frequent media appearances (especially on podcasts) and unconventional positions helped raise his profile early in the presidential race. He suspended his campaign in January 2024 and subsequently endorsed eventual winner Donald Trump. The president-elect later announced that Ramaswamy and Elon Musk would head the Department of Government Efficiency. Ramaswamy’s mother, who worked as a geriatric psychiatrist, and his father, an engineer and patent lawyer at General Electric, moved to the United States from Kerala, India, in the 1970s. Ramaswamy was born in 1985 in Cincinnati, Ohio, where he grew up; his younger brother, Shankar, was born in 1989. Ramaswamy was a nationally ranked junior tennis player and the valedictorian of his Jesuit high-school class. After finishing a bachelor’s degree in biology at Harvard University in 2007, he worked for a hedge fund and made $7 million in seven years. Meanwhile, he earned a law degree in 2013 from Yale University, where he met his future wife, Apoorva Tewari, a medical student (later, a throat surgeon). In 2014, when Ramaswamy was 29, he started a pharmaceutical company, Roivant Sciences. By 2023 he had made at least a quarter million dollars in personal income from the company. Ramaswamy has claimed he was apolitical before 2020, when he first lamented in The Wall Street Journal that partisan politics was interfering in the corporate sector. In January 2021 he stepped down as Roivant’s CEO, and later that year he published his first book, Woke, Inc.: Inside Corporate America’s Social Justice Scam. He argued in the book that when corporations wade into social issues—for instance, by instituting diversity quotas in hiring or by divesting from companies that pollute the environment—the practice tends to be both cynical, a ploy to increase profits or deflect attention from unethical deeds, and corrosive to democracy, because it imposes these social priorities on the public. For instance, when Delta Air Lines, Inc. criticized new laws in Georgia on the grounds that they would suppress voter turnout, Ramaswamy said the company had failed “to explain why Americans should care whether a voting law matches the values of an airline company.” In 2022 Ramaswamy founded an “anti-woke” index fund provider called Strive Asset Management LLC, billing it as the antithesis of other asset management companies like BlackRock, Inc., that purport publicly to invest in an ESG framework. He promised that Strive would offer investment funds without asking companies to “push political agendas.” The firm’s backers included Peter Thiel and Narya Capital, the venture capital firm belonging to J.D. Vance (Ramaswamy’s friend from law school, who would be elected to the U.S. Senate in late 2022). In September 2023, as Ramaswamy was surging in opinion polling for the Republican primary elections, Strive announced that its assets had come to exceed $1 billion. About the same time, Ramaswamy’s personal net worth was hovering around $1 billion. Ramaswamy’s presidential run began in February 2023, after the Republican race already included the major political figures Donald Trump and Nikki Haley. In a video announcing his bid, he argued that “faith, patriotism, and hard work” were being replaced in the United States by “new secular religions like COVID-ism, climate-ism and gender ideology.” Along with standard Republican positions, such as support for abortion bans and opposition to affirmative action, Ramaswamy advocated some unconventional policies during his presidential run. He called for raising the standard voting age to 25, restricting birthright citizenship, and sending the U.S. military to Mexico to “annihilate” drug cartels. He pledged to fire more than 75 percent of the federal workforce and disband the FBI, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, and the Department of Education (and to abolish teacher unions as well). He argued that people should “be proud to live a high-carbon lifestyle” and claimed that “more people are dying of bad climate change policies than they are of actual climate change.” Despite his claims that ESG investing is a threat to democracy, Ramaswamy told Sheelah Kolhatkar of The New Yorker that he does not believe that extreme concentration of wealth necessarily poses a major threat to the institution. “When I asked Ramaswamy why he ignores how money in politics compromises the regulatory and legislative process,” Kolhatkar wrote, “the issue seemed to bore him.” In the early months of the campaign season, Ramaswamy quickly rose from relative obscurity to a position as one of the main contenders to challenge Trump’s lead in the polls. In August 2023 Politico reported that he had once done roughly 30 interviews in a single day and had appeared on more than 150 podcasts in the previous six months. CNN called his performance at an August debate “a breakout moment,” and, according to a Washington Post poll, Republican voters who watched the debate thought he was bested only by Ron DeSantis. (Trump did not participate.) As the campaign continued, however, Ramaswamy lost ground to DeSantis and Haley, and he finished fourth in the Iowa Republican caucus on January 15, 2024. That night he suspended his campaign, and, as he told supporters, he “called Donald Trump to tell him that I congratulate him on his victory. And now, going forward, he will have my full endorsement for the presidency.” After Trump won the general election in November 2024, he announced that Ramaswamy and Musk would head the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE). According to Trump, the new agency would help “dismantle Government Bureaucracy, slash excess regulations, cut wasteful expenditures, and restructure Federal Agencies.” The DOGE was not expected to be part of the federal government.",

                "content": "Watch CBS News By Kate Gibson Edited By Aimee Picchi, Alex Sundby Updated on: December 27, 2024 / 12:29 AM EST / CBS News ChatGPT stopped functioning for many users on Thursday afternoon, with OpenAI saying that its AI app was experiencing glitches for some. The app recovered several hours later, the San Francisco-based company said. The artificial intelligence company said in an update to its status page late Thursday night that ChatGPT had achieved a \"full recovery\" by 11:16 p.m. Eastern Time. \"OpenAI will run a full root-cause analysis of this outage and will share details on this page when complete,\" OpenAI said. The company had earlier said that Sora, its video generation model, as well as its automated application programming interface — or API, which lets software programs speak to one another — were operational. But on Thursday night it said it was \"currently investigating a separate incident regarding Sora,\" but did not elaborate. More than 15,000 incidents were reported by OpenAI users on Thursday afternoon, with most of the problems related to ChatGPT, according to Downdetector, an online platform that provides users with real-time information about the status of various websites and services. The technical glitches cropped up at about 1:30 p.m. Eastern. The company initially posted, \"ChatGPT, the API and Sora are currently experiencing high error rates. The issue is caused by an upstream provider and we are currently monitoring.\" The number of reports dwindled to less than 50 by late Thursday night. Launched in 2022, OpenAI's ChatGPT service can generate human-like replies based on user prompts, and as of late this summer had more than 200 million active users. According to the company, a majority of Fortune 500 companies use OpenAI's products and its API. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman is among the tech leaders planning to donate $1 million to President-elect Donald Trump's inaugural fund, a spokesperson confirmed earlier this month.

                "content": "Manage your account OpenAI’s widely used chatbot, ChatGPT, faced a significant outage on Thursday, leaving thousands of users unable to access the platform. The disruption sparked widespread reports of errors and downtime. OpenAI quickly acknowledged the problem and worked on a fix. Now many users are curious to know about what happened to ChatGPT and why was it down. Here’s why ChatGPT was down on Thursday. OpenAI’s ChatGPT experienced a significant outage on Thursday, disrupting service for thousands of users. Starting around 1:30 P.M. EST, reports of issues flooded Downdetector, with over 50,000 incidents recorded by 3:30 P.M. EST. Many users encountered an “Internal Server Error” message, leaving them unable to interact with the popular AI chatbot. The issues also extended to OpenAI’s Sora video-generation model and its automated application programming interface (API), which led to more technical difficulties across the platform. By 4:05 P.M. EST, OpenAI stated it was actively working on a fix. However, frustration grew among users who turned to social media platforms like X to share their experiences. The outage lasted for several hours, with OpenAI attributing the problem to an unnamed internet service provider. By 11:16 P.M. EST, OpenAI confirmed that it had restored full service. The statement said, “OpenAI will run a full root-cause analysis of this outage and will share details on this page when complete.” The company issued a statement, acknowledging the disruption and assuring users that a detailed analysis of the root cause would be conducted to prevent future occurrences. This was the second major outage for ChatGPT in December, following a similar disruption earlier in the month. Despite the hiccups, OpenAI remains one of the most prominent players in the AI market. The platform boasts over 300 million weekly active users and continues to be a valuable tool for businesses and individuals alike. Originally reported by Disheeta Maheshwari on ComingSoon.net.

Now that the college football regular season has come and gone and the conference champions have been crowned, the attention turns to the postseason with a loaded slate of bowl games set to grace our television sets this holiday season. There may not be a more anticipated season in college football history. In addition to the usual schedule of bowl games, this year ushers in the first season of the 12-team College Football Playoff era. What was once tabbed the New Year's Six will now be part of the new playoff system after the first-round games have been played at home sites. Fresh off a win in the SEC Championship Game, Georgia (11-2) earned the No. 2 seed with Mountain West champion Boise State (12-1) and Big 12 champion Arizona State (11-2) rounding out the top four seeds -- all conference title holders receiving first-round byes as part of the new 12-team format. Clemson (10-3), the lone Power Four champion not to receive a bye, picked up the No. 12 seed and will open the first round playing at No. 5 seed Texas (11-2). All first-round games will be held at the sites of the lower-seeded teams placed higher in the final CFP Rankings. Rounding out the first-round matchups, No. 8 seed Ohio State (10-2) will host No. 9 seed Tennessee (10-2), No. 6 seed Penn State (11-2) welcomes No. 11 seed SMU (10-2) and No. 7 seed Notre Dame (11-1) will see No. 10 seed Indiana (11-1) come to town. Quarterfinal and semifinal games will be held at traditional New Year's Six bowl sites. The Rose Bowl will host Oregon and the winner of Tennessee-Ohio State, the Sugar Bowl gets Georgia and the winner of Indiana-Notre Dame, the Fiesta Bowl hosts Boise vs. the winner of SMU-Penn State and the Peach Bowl draws Arizona State vs. either Texas or Clemson. in the semifinals, the Orange Bowl hosts the winners from the Georgia-Boise State side of the bracket.

                "content": "We are entering the business end of proceedings of the college football season. Are you ready for five non-stop weeks of bowl action? Tis the season to be jolly. College campuses all over the nation are in the midst of a football frenzy. There are a total of 47 games taking place over a 38-day period, starting with the Cricket Celebration Bowl in Atlanta on Saturday, December 14 and finishing in Atlanta on Monday, January 20, with the College Football Playoff National Championship game. Whatever awaits over the coming weeks, one thing that’s guaranteed is that there’ll be non-stop thrills and spills from start to finish. To add to the excitement this time around, the College Football Playoff schedule has been revamped, so 11 of those 47 total games are CFP-related. Under the new 12-team format, the College Football Playoffs will begin with first-round games in late December, followed by quarter-final action on New Year's Eve and New Year's Day. The semi-final match-ups and the National Championship game will then be held during January. All of the former New Year’s Six bowls will be used for the College Football Playoff this year. The quarter-finals will be played at the Fiesta Bowl, Peach Bowl, Rose Bowl and Sugar Bowl and the semi-finals at the Orange Bowl and Cotton Bowl on January 9 and 10, respectively. The top five college football regular season conference champions, along with the next seven highest-ranked teams, will secure positions in the CFP 12-team bracket. There are no restrictions on the number of teams from a single conference that can qualify, and there are no guaranteed spots for any specific conferences. Bowl season is one of the greatest and longest-running traditions in American sports and has been an annual celebration of college football for over 100 years. The history of the bowl game began with the 1902 Tournament East-West football game, sponsored by the Tournament of Roses Association, between Michigan and Stanford. This Tournament East-West Football Game would become an annual event from 1916 onwards. The 1923 edition took place at the newly completed Rose Bowl stadium in Pasadena, and the clash became known as the Rose Bowl from then on. Other cities saw the positive effect that the Rose Bowl brought to the California area on tourism and business, and they began to develop their own regional festivals, which included college football games. The Rose Bowl may have been the only major college bowl game in 1930; however, by 1940, there would be four further standout games: the Sugar Bowl (established in 1935), the Orange Bowl (1935), the Sun Bowl (1935) and the Cotton Bowl Classic (1937). This further galvanised interest in the college game, and the expansion and spread of bowl games continued. Yale have won the most college football national championship crowns, 18 in total. However, that was in the distant past, with the last of those successes occurring way back in 1927. Alabama's college football greatness has been more recent and relevant. The Crimson Tide have collected 16 national titles in total and have been one of the dominant forces since the College Football Playoffs system was introduced, being crowned FBS national champions on three occasions since 2014 and finishing as runners-up in three other seasons. Alabama also holds the record for most bowl games played and most bowl wins, as they've featured in 76 encounters, winning 45 of them. Let GOAL bring you everything you need to know about the college football bowl season and playoffs, including the full schedule and how you can watch and stream every single game. Oregon heads into the College Football Playoffs as the No.1 overall seed. The Ducks are the only side of the twelve remaining in the race for the National Championship crown, and they are still unbeaten this season, having won 13 games on the spin. That 13th straight success came in the Big 10 championship game against Penn State, with Oregon coming out top 45-37 in an absorbing clash. As well as Oregon and Penn State, two other Big 10 outfits, Indiana and Ohio State, still have their eyes on the main prize. Another conference with multiple sides still in the hunt for honours is the SEC, with Georgia, Texas and Tennessee dreaming of glory. It was Georgia who grabbed the No.2 overall seed spot when they knocked off Texas 22-19 in overtime for the SEC championship title. Georgia and Oregon and the two highest-ranked conference champions, Boise State and Arizona State have been rewarded with first-round byes in the College Football Playoff format shake-up. The biggest debate following the College Football Playoff committee's final-12 selections on Sunday, December 8, surrounded Alabama missing out on the CFP party. SEC side Alabama are one of the most honoured college football sides in history, but had dropped three games this season and SMU got the vote ahead of them. Despite losing a nail-biting ACC championship thriller against Clemson, the Mustangs were unbeaten during league play, and they got the nod due to their overall season performance.

                "content": "The Premier League is a professional association football league in England and the highest level of the English football league system. Contested by 20 clubs, it operates on a system of promotion and relegation with the English Football League (EFL). Seasons usually run from August to May, with each team playing 38 matches: two against each other team, one home and one away.[1] Most games are played on weekend afternoons, with occasional weekday evening fixtures.[2] The competition was founded as the FA Premier League on 20 February 1992, following the decision of First Division (the top-tier league from 1888 until 1992) clubs to break away from the English Football League. However, teams may still be relegated to and promoted from the EFL Championship. The Premier League is a corporation managed by a chief executive, with member clubs acting as shareholders.[3] The Premier League takes advantage of a £5 billion television rights deal, with Sky and BT Group securing the domestic rights to broadcast 128 and 32 games, respectively.[4][5] This deal will rise to £6.7 billion for the four seasons from 2025 to 2029.[6] The league is projected to earn $7.2 billion in overseas TV rights from 2022 to 2025.[7] Clubs were apportioned central payment revenues of £2.4 billion in 2016–17, with a further £343 million in solidarity payments to EFL clubs.[8] The Premier League is the most-watched sports league in the world, broadcast in 212 territories to 643 million homes, with a potential TV audience of 4.7 billion people.[9][10] For the 2023–24 season, the average Premier League match attendance was 38,375,[11] second to the German Bundesliga's 39,512,[12] whilst aggregated attendance across all matches in a 38-game season is the highest of any association football league.[13] Most stadium occupancies are near capacity.[14] As of 2023[update], the Premier League is ranked first in the UEFA coefficient rankings based on performances in European competitions over the past five seasons, ahead of Spain's La Liga.[15] The English top-flight has produced the second-highest number of European Cup / UEFA Champions League titles, with a record six English clubs having won fifteen European championships in total.[16] Fifty-one clubs have competed in the Premier League since its inception in 1992: 49 from England and 2 from Wales. Seven of them have won the title: Manchester United (13), Manchester City (8), Chelsea (5), Arsenal (3), Blackburn Rovers (1), Leicester City (1), and Liverpool (1).[17] Only six clubs have played in every season to date: Arsenal, Chelsea, Everton, Liverpool, Manchester United, and Tottenham Hotspur.[18] Despite significant European success in the 1970s and early 1980s, the late 1980s marked a low point for English football. Stadiums were deteriorating, supporters endured poor facilities, hooliganism was rife, and English clubs had been banned from European competition for five years following the Heysel Stadium disaster between the fans of Liverpool Football Club and the fans of Juventus in 1985.[19] The Football League First Division, the top level of English football since 1888, was behind leagues such as Italy's Serie A and Spain's La Liga in attendance and revenues, and several top English players had moved abroad.[20] By the turn of the 1990s, the downward trend was starting to reverse. At the 1990 FIFA World Cup, England reached the semi-finals; UEFA, European football's governing body, lifted the five-year ban on English clubs playing in European competitions in 1990, resulting in Manchester United lifting the Cup Winners' Cup in 1991. The Taylor Report on stadium safety standards, which proposed expensive upgrades to create all-seater stadiums in the aftermath of the Hillsborough disaster; between the fans of Liverpool and the fans of Nottingham Forest at Hillsborough Stadium, Sheffield, Yorkshire on 15 April 1989, was published in January 1990.[21] During the 1980s, major English clubs began to transform into business ventures, applying commercial principles to club administration to maximise revenue. Martin Edwards of Manchester United, Irving Scholar of Tottenham Hotspur, and David Dein of Arsenal were among the leaders in this transformation.[22] The commercial imperative led to the top clubs seeking to increase their power and revenue: the clubs in Division One threatened to break away from the Football League, and in doing so, they managed to increase their voting power and gain a more favourable financial arrangement, taking a 50% share of all television and sponsorship income in 1986.[22] They demanded that television companies should pay more for their coverage of football matches,[23] and revenue from television grew in importance. The Football League received £6.3 million for a two-year agreement in 1986, but by 1988, in a deal agreed with ITV, the price rose to £44 million over four years, with the leading clubs taking 75% of the cash.[24][25] According to Scholar, who was involved in the negotiations of television deals, each of the First Division clubs received only around £25,000 per year from television rights before 1986, this increased to around £50,000 in the 1986 negotiation, then to £600,000 in 1988.[26] The 1988 negotiations were conducted under the threat of ten clubs leaving to form a \"super league\", but they were eventually persuaded to stay, with the top clubs taking the lion's share of the deal.[24][27][28] The negotiations also convinced the bigger clubs that, in order to receive enough votes, they needed to take the whole of the First Division with them instead of a smaller \"super league\".[29] By the beginning of the 1990s, the big clubs again considered breaking away, especially now that they had to fund the cost of stadium upgrades as proposed by the Taylor Report.[30] In 1990, the managing director of London Weekend Television (LWT), Greg Dyke, met with the representatives of the \"big five\" football clubs in England (Manchester United, Liverpool, Tottenham Hotspur, Everton, and Arsenal) over a dinner.[31] The meeting was to pave the way for a breakaway from the Football League.[32] Dyke believed that it would be more lucrative for LWT if only the larger clubs in the country were featured on national television and wanted to establish whether the clubs would be interested in a larger share of television rights money.[33] The five clubs agreed with the suggestion and decided to press ahead with it; however, the league would have no credibility without the backing of the Football Association, and so David Dein of Arsenal held talks to see whether the FA were receptive to the idea. The FA did not have an amicable relationship with the Football League at the time and considered it a way to weaken the Football League's position.[34] The FA released a report in June 1991, Blueprint for the Future of Football, that supported the plan for the Premier League, with the FA as the ultimate authority that would oversee the breakaway league.[29] At the close of the 1990–1991 season, a proposal was tabled for the establishment of a new league that would bring more money into the game overall. The Founder Members Agreement, signed on 17 July 1991, by the game's top-flight clubs, established the basic principles for setting up the FA Premier League.[35] The newly formed top division was to have commercial independence from the Football Association and the Football League, giving the FA Premier League licence to negotiate its own broadcast and sponsorship agreements. The argument given at the time was that the extra income would allow English clubs to compete with teams across Europe.[20] Although Dyke played a significant role in the creation of the Premier League, he and ITV (of which LWT was part) lost out in the bidding for broadcast rights: BSkyB won with a bid of £304 million over five years, with the BBC awarded the highlights package broadcast on Match of the Day.[31][33] Luton Town, Notts County, and West Ham United were the three teams relegated from the old First Division at the end of the 1991–92 season, and did not take part in the inaugural Premier League season. They were replaced by Ipswich Town, Middlesbrough, and Blackburn Rovers, promoted from the old Second Division.[36] The 22 First Division clubs resigned en masse from the Football League in 1992, and on 27 May that year, the FA Premier League was formed as a limited company, working out of an office at the Football Association's then headquarters in Lancaster Gate.[20] The 22 inaugural members of the new Premier League were:[37] This meant a break-up of the 104-year-old Football League that had operated until then with four divisions; the Premier League would operate with a single division and the Football League with three. There was no change in competition format; the same number of teams competed in the top flight, and promotion and relegation between the Premier League and the new First Division remained the same as the old First and Second Divisions, with three teams relegated from the league and three promoted.[28] The league held its first season in 1992–93. It was composed of 22 clubs for that season (reduced to 20 in the 1995–96 season). The first Premier League goal was scored by Brian Deane of Sheffield United in a 2–1 win against Manchester United.[38] Manchester United won the inaugural edition of the new league, ending a twenty-six year wait to be crowned champions of England. Bolstered by this breakthrough, United immediately became the competition's dominant team, winning seven of the first nine trophies, two League and FA Cup 'doubles' and a European treble, initially under a team of hardened veterans such as Bryan Robson, Steve Bruce, Paul Ince, Mark Hughes, and Eric Cantona, before Cantona, Bruce, and Roy Keane led a young, dynamic new team filled with the Class of 92, a group of young players including David Beckham who came through the Manchester United Academy. Between 1993 and 1997, Blackburn Rovers and Newcastle United came close to challenging Manchester United's early dominance; Blackburn won the 1994–95 FA Premier League and Newcastle led the title charge over United for much of the 1995–96 season. As the decade closed, Arsenal replicated Manchester United's dominance by winning the League and FA Cup double in 1997–98, and together they would form a duopoly over the league between 1997 and 2003. The 2000s saw the rise of Liverpool alongside the \"Big 2\", followed by Chelsea finally breaking the Arsenal–Man United duopoly by winning the league in 2004–05. The dominance of the so-called \"Big Four\" clubs – Arsenal, Chelsea, Liverpool, and Manchester United[39][40] – saw them finish at the top of the table for most of the decade, thereby guaranteeing qualification for the UEFA Champions League. Only three other clubs managed to qualify for the competition during this period: Newcastle United (2001–02 and 2002–03), Everton (2004–05), and Tottenham Hotspur (2009–10) – each occupying the final Champions League spot, with the exception of Newcastle in the 2002–03 season, who finished third. Following the 2003–04 season, Arsenal acquired the nickname \"The Invincibles\" as they became the first and, to date, only club to complete a Premier League campaign without losing a single game.[41][42] In May 2008, Kevin Keegan stated that \"Big Four\" dominance threatened the division: \"This league is in danger of becoming one of the most boring but great leagues in the world.\"[43] Premier League chief executive Richard Scudamore said in defence: \"There are a lot of different tussles that go on in the Premier League depending on whether you're at the top, in the middle, or at the bottom that make it interesting.\"[44] Between 2005 and 2012, there was a Premier League representative in seven of the eight Champions League finals, with only the \"Big Four\" clubs reaching that stage. Liverpool (2005), Manchester United (2008), and Chelsea (2012) won the competition during this period, with Arsenal (2006), Liverpool (2007), Chelsea (2008), and Manchester United (2009 and 2011) all losing Champions League finals.[45] Leeds United were the only non-\"Big Four\" side to reach the semi-finals of the Champions League, in the 2000–01 season. There were three Premier League teams in the Champions League semi-finals in 2006–07, 2007–08, and 2008–09, a feat only ever achieved five times (along with Serie A in 2002–03 and La Liga in 1999–2000). Additionally, between the 1999–2000 and 2009–10 seasons, four Premier League sides reached the UEFA Cup or Europa League finals, with only Liverpool managing to win the competition in 2001. Arsenal (2000), Middlesbrough (2006), and Fulham (2010) all lost their finals.[46] Although the group's dominance was reduced to a degree after this period with the emergence of Manchester City and Tottenham, in terms of all-time Premier League points won, they remain clear by some margin. As of the end of the 2021–22 season – the 30th season of the Premier League – Liverpool, in fourth place in the all-time points table, were over 300 points ahead of the next team, Tottenham Hotspur. They are also the only teams to maintain a winning average of over 50% throughout their entire Premier League tenures.[47] The years following 2009 marked a shift from the \"Big Four\" with Tottenham Hotspur and Manchester City breaking into the top four places on a regular basis, turning the \"Big Four\" into the \"Big Six\".[48] In the 2009–10 season, Tottenham finished fourth and became the first new team to finish in the top four since Everton five years prior.[49] Criticism of the gap between an elite group of \"super clubs\" and the majority of the Premier League has continued, nevertheless, due to their increasing ability to spend more than the other Premier League clubs.[50] Manchester City won the title in the 2011–12 season, becoming the first club outside the \"Big Four\" to win since Blackburn Rovers in the 1994–95 season. That season also saw two of the \"Big Four\" (Chelsea and Liverpool) finish outside the top four places for the first time since that season.[48] With only four UEFA Champions League qualifying places available in the league, greater competition for qualification now exists, albeit from a narrow base of six clubs. In the five seasons following the 2011–12 campaign, Manchester United and Liverpool both found themselves outside of the top four three times, whilst Chelsea finished 10th in the 2015–16 season. Arsenal finished 5th in 2016–17, ending their record run of 20 consecutive top-four finishes.[51] In the 2015–16 season, underdogs Leicester City won the Premier League. With 5000/1 odds of winning the league at the beginning of the season, Leicester became the first club outside the \"Big Six\" to win the Premier League since Blackburn Rovers in the 1994–95 season.[52] Off the pitch, the \"Big Six\" wield significant financial power and influence, with these clubs arguing that they should be entitled to a greater share of revenue due to the greater stature of their clubs globally and the attractive football they aim to play.[53] Objectors argue that the egalitarian revenue structure in the Premier League helps to maintain a competitive league which is vital for its future success.[54] The 2016–17 Deloitte Football Money League report showed the financial disparity between the \"Big Six\" and the rest of the division. All of the \"Big Six\" had revenues greater than €350 million, with Manchester United having the largest revenue in the league at €676.3 million. Leicester City was the closest club to the \"Big Six\" in terms of revenue, recording a figure of €271.1 million for that season – helped by participation in the Champions League. The eighth-largest revenue generator, West Ham – who did not play in European competition – had revenues of €213.3 million, less than half of those of the club with the fifth-largest revenue, Liverpool (€424.2 million).[55] A substantial part of the clubs' revenue by then came from television broadcast deals, with the biggest clubs each taking from around £150 million to nearly £200 million in the 2016–17 season from such deals.[56] In Deloitte's 2019 report, all the \"Big Six\" were in the top ten of the world's richest clubs.[57] From the 2019–20 season, video assistant referees were used in the league.[58] The 2019–20 season saw Liverpool win their first Premier League trophy, their first top-flight trophy in 30 years.[59] Project Big Picture was announced in October 2020 that described a plan to reunite the top Premier League clubs with the English Football League, proposed by leading Premier League clubs Manchester United and Liverpool.[60] It has been criticised by the Premier League leadership and the UK government's Department for Culture, Media and Sport.[61] On 26 April 2021, play was stopped during a match between Leicester City and Crystal Palace to allow players Wesley Fofana and Cheikhou Kouyaté to break Ramadan fast. It is believed to be the first time in Premier League history that a game was paused to allow Muslim players to eat and drink after the sun had set in accordance with the rules of the faith.[62] The 2022–23 season was the first to take a six-week break between November and December 2022 to allow for the first winter World Cup,[63] with a return for the Boxing Day fixtures.[64] The Premier League players decided to take the knee at selected \"significant moments\". They assured to \"remain resolutely committed to eradicate racial prejudice\".[65] That season was notable for Newcastle United and Brighton & Hove Albion breaking the traditional \"Big Six\" as they finished fourth and sixth, respectively, whilst \"Big Six\" teams Tottenham and Chelsea finished eighth and twelfth.[66][67] Meanwhile, 2015–16 champions Leicester City were relegated, becoming the second league-winning club to suffer relegation since 1992, after Blackburn Rovers in the 2011–12 season.[68] In the 2023–24 season, Manchester City won the Premier League for the sixth time in seven years to become the first top-flight team to win four consecutive league titles in English football history.[69] Meanwhile, non-Big Six club Aston Villa finished fourth and qualified for the 2024–25 UEFA Champions League.[70] The Football Association Premier League Ltd (FAPL)[71][72][73] is operated as a corporation and is owned by the 20 member clubs. Each club is a shareholder, with one vote each on issues such as rule changes and contracts. The clubs select a chairman, chief executive, and board of directors to oversee the daily operations of the league.[74] The Football Association is not directly involved in the day-to-day operations of the Premier League, but has veto power as a special shareholder during the election of the chairman and chief executive and when new rules are adopted by the league.[75] The current chief executive is Richard Masters, who was appointed in December 2019.[76] The chair is currently Alison Brittain, who took over the role in early 2023.[77] The Premier League sends representatives to UEFA's European Club Association, the number of clubs and the clubs themselves chosen according to UEFA coefficients. For the 2023–24 season, the Premier League has 13 representatives in the Association: Arsenal, Aston Villa, Brighton & Hove Albion, Chelsea, Everton, Liverpool, Manchester City, Manchester United, Newcastle United, Nottingham Forest, Tottenham Hotspur, West Ham United, and Wolverhampton Wanderers.[78] The European Club Association is responsible for electing three members to UEFA's Club Competitions Committee, which is involved in the operations of UEFA competitions such as the Champions League and UEFA Europa League.[79] The Premier League has faced criticism of its governance due to an alleged lack of transparency and accountability. Following the Premier League's blocking of the attempted takeover of Newcastle United by a PIF-backed consortium through the league's Owners' and Directors' test, many MPs, Newcastle United fans and related parties to the deal denounced the Premier League for its perceived lack of transparency and accountability throughout the process.[80][81][82] On 6 July 2021, consortium member Amanda Staveley of PCP Capital Partners said that \"fans surely deserve absolute transparency from the regulators across all their processes – to best ensure that they act responsibly. They (the Premier League) are performing a function like that of a government regulator – but without the same systems for accountability.\"[82] On 22 July 2021, Tracey Crouch MP – chair of the fan-led review into the UK's football governance – announced in the review's interim findings that the Premier League had \"lost the trust and confidence\" of fans. The review also recommended that a new independent regulator be created to oversee matters such as club takeovers.[83][84] Premier League chief executive Richard Masters had earlier spoken out against the implementation of an independent regulator, saying in May 2021, \"I don't think that the independent regulator is the answer to the question. I would defend the Premier League's role as regulator of its clubs over the past 30 years.\"[85] [The Premier League] is very tough and is different. If you compare this league to another league, it's like playing another sport. In [The Premier League] you never really know what is going to happen, there is very little between the teams. There are 20 clubs in the Premier League. During the course of a season (from August to May) each club plays the others twice (a double round-robin system), once at their home stadium and once at that of their opponents, for 38 games. Teams receive three points for a win and one point for a draw. No points are awarded for a loss. Teams are ranked by total points, then goal difference, and then goals scored. If still equal, teams are deemed to occupy the same position. If there is a tie for the championship, for relegation, or for qualification to other competitions, the head-to-head record between the tied teams is taken into consideration (points scored in the matches between the teams, followed by away goals in those matches.) If two teams are still tied, a play-off match at a neutral venue decides rank.[88] A system of promotion and relegation exists between the Premier League and the EFL Championship. The three lowest placed teams in the Premier League are relegated to the Championship, and the top two teams from the Championship promoted to the Premier League,[89] with an additional team promoted after a series of play-offs involving the third, fourth, fifth and sixth placed clubs.[90] The number of clubs was reduced from 22 to 20 in 1995, when four teams were relegated from the league and only two teams promoted.[91][92] The top flight had only been expanded to 22 teams at the start of the 1991–92 season – the year prior to the formation of the Premier League.[92] On 8 June 2006, FIFA requested that all major European leagues, including Italy's Serie A and Spain's La Liga, be reduced to 18 teams by the start of the 2007–08 season. The Premier League responded by announcing their intention to resist such a reduction.[93] Ultimately, the 2007–08 season kicked off again with 20 teams.[94] Video assistant referee (VAR), was introduced to the Premier League at the beginning of the 2019–20 season. It uses technology and officials to assist the referee in making decisions on the pitch.[95] However, its use has been met with mixed receptions from fans and pundits, with some praising its accuracy whilst others criticise its impact on the flow of the game and consistency of decision-making. The on-field referee still makes the final decision, but VAR can assist the referee in the decision-making process. VAR can only be used for four types of decisions: goals, penalty decisions, direct red card incidents, and cases of mistaken identity. VAR officials review the video footage and communicate with the on-field referee via a headset. The VAR officials are located in a central control room, which is equipped with multiple camera angles and the ability to replay footage at various speeds. A study evaluating fan reception of VAR in the Premier League was made by Otto Kolbinger and Melanie Knopp and was done by analysing Twitter data.[96] The researchers used sentiment analysis to measure the overall positive or negative attitudes towards VAR, as well as topic modelling to identify specific issues that fans are discussing related to VAR. The study found that the reception of VAR on Twitter is largely negative, with fans expressing frustration and criticism of the technology's impact on the flow of the game and the inconsistency of decisions. The researchers also identified specific issues, such as handball and offside decisions, that fans are particularly critical of. The study concludes that VAR has not been well received by fans in the Premier League, and that efforts to improve the technology and increase transparency in decision-making are needed to address these concerns. Fifty-one clubs have played in the Premier League from its inception in 1992, up to and including the 2023–24 season.[97] Titles won by club (%) Italics indicate former Premier League champions that are currently outside the Premier League. Twenty clubs are competing in the 2024–25 season – top seventeen from the previous season and three promoted from the Championship. In 2011, after Swansea City gained promotion, a Welsh club participated in the Premier League for the first time.[98][99] The first Premier League match to be played outside England was Swansea City's home match at Liberty Stadium against Wigan Athletic on 20 August 2011.[100] The number of Welsh clubs in the Premier League increased to two in 2013–14, as Cardiff City gained promotion,[101] but they were relegated after their maiden season.[102] Cardiff were promoted again in 2017–18 but the number of Welsh clubs remained the same for the 2018–19 Premier League season, as Swansea City had been relegated from the Premier League in 2017–18.[103] Following Cardiff City's relegation after the 2018–19 season, there are currently no Welsh clubs participating in the Premier League.[104] Because they are members of the Football Association of Wales (FAW), the question of whether clubs like Swansea should represent England or Wales in European competitions has caused long-running discussions in UEFA. Swansea took one of England's three available places in the Europa League in 2013–14 by winning the League Cup in 2012–13.[105] The right of Welsh clubs to take up such English places was in doubt until UEFA clarified the matter in March 2012, allowing them to participate.[106] Participation in the Premier League by some Scottish or Irish clubs has sometimes been discussed, but without result. The idea came closest to reality in 1998, when Wimbledon received Premier League approval to relocate to Dublin, Ireland, but the move was blocked by the Football Association of Ireland.[107][108][109][110] Additionally, the media occasionally discusses the idea that Scotland's two biggest teams, Celtic and Rangers, should or will take part in the Premier League, but nothing has come of these discussions.[111] The top four teams in the Premier League qualify automatically for the subsequent season's UEFA Champions League league phase. The champions of the Champions League and UEFA Europa League may earn an additional qualification for the subsequent season's Champions League league phase if did not finish in the top four. If this means six Premier League teams qualify, then the fourth-placed team in the Premier League is instead entered in the Europa League, as any single nation is limited to a maximum of five teams in the Champions League. However, starting from the 2024–25 UEFA Champions League there are additional berths for the two best associations in the previous season's ranking, which may result in a maximum of six teams from one association in the Champions League. The fifth-placed team in the Premier League, as well as the winners of the FA Cup, qualify for the subsequent season's Europa League league phase, but if the winner of the FA Cup also finishes in the top five places in the Premier League or has won one of UEFA's major tournaments, then this place reverts to the team that finished sixth. The winner of the EFL Cup qualifies for the subsequent season's UEFA Conference League, but if the winner had already qualified for a UEFA competition via their performance in another competition, then this place reverts to the team that finished sixth in the Premier League, or seventh if the FA Cup result had already caused the sixth-placed team to qualify.[112] The number of places allocated to English clubs in UEFA competitions is dependent upon the position the country holds in the UEFA coefficient rankings, which are calculated based on the performance of teams in UEFA competitions over the previous five years. Currently, England is ranked first, ahead of Spain. As of 26 September 2024, the coefficients for are as follows (only top five European leagues are shown):[113][114] An exception to the usual European qualification system happened in 2005, after Liverpool won the Champions League the season before, but did not finish in a Champions League qualification place in the Premier League. UEFA gave special dispensation for Liverpool to enter the Champions League, giving England five qualifiers.[115] The governing body subsequently ruled that the defending champions qualify for the competition the following year regardless of their domestic league placing. However, for those leagues with four entrants in the Champions League, this meant that if the Champions League winners finished outside the top four in its domestic league, it would qualify at the expense of the fourth-placed team. At that time, no association could have more than four entrants in the Champions League.[116] This occurred in 2012, when Chelsea – who had won the Champions League that summer, but finished sixth in the league – qualified for the 2012–13 Champions League in place of Tottenham Hotspur, who went into the Europa League.[117] From 2015–16, the Europa League champions qualify for the Champions League, increasing the maximum number of participants per country to five.[118] This took effect in England in 2016–17, when Manchester United finished sixth in the Premier League and won the Europa League, giving England five Champions League entrants for 2017–18.[119] In these instances, any Europa League berth vacated is not handed down to the next-best Premier League finisher outside of a qualifying place. If both Champions League and Europa League winners are of the same association and both finish outside the top four, then the fourth-placed team is transferred to the Europa League. With 48 continental trophies won, English clubs are the third-most successful in European football, behind Italy (50) and Spain (67). In the top-tier UEFA Champions League, a record six English clubs have won a total of 15 titles and lost a further 11 finals, behind Spanish clubs with 20 and 11, respectively.[120] In the second-tier UEFA Europa League, English clubs are third, with nine victories and eight losses in the finals.[121] In the former second-tier UEFA Cup Winners' Cup, English teams won a record eight titles and had a further five finalists.[122] In the non-UEFA organised Inter-Cities Fairs Cup, English clubs provided four winners and four runners-up, the second-most behind Spain with six and three, respectively.[123] In the newly created third-tier UEFA Conference League, English clubs have won a joint-record one title so far.[124] In the former fourth-tier UEFA Intertoto Cup, England won four titles and had a further final appearance, placing it fifth in the rankings, although English clubs were notorious for treating the tournament with disdain, either sending \"B\" squads or withdrawing from it altogether.[125][126][127] In the one-off UEFA Super Cup, England has ten winners and ten runners-up, the second-most behind Spain with 17 and 15, respectively.[128] Similarly to the Intertoto Cup, English teams did not take the former Intercontinental Cup seriously enough, despite its international status of the Club World Championship. They a made a total of six appearances in the one-off competition, winning only one of them, and withdrew a further three times.[129] English clubs have won the FIFA-organised Club World Cup four times, tied for the second-most with Brazil, and behind only Spain, with eight.[130][127] After an inaugural season with no sponsorship, the Premier League was sponsored by Carling from 1993 until 2001, during which time it was known as the FA Carling Premiership. In 2001, a new sponsorship deal with Barclaycard saw the league rebranded the FA Barclaycard Premiership, which was changed to the FA Barclays Premiership in time for the 2004–05 season. For the 2007–08 season, the league was rebranded the Barclays Premier League.[131][132] Barclays' deal with the Premier League expired at the end of the 2015–16 season. The organisation announced on 4 June 2015 that it would not pursue any further title sponsorship deals for the Premier League, arguing that they wanted to build a \"clean\" brand for the competition more in line with those of major U.S. sports leagues.[134] As well as sponsorship for the league itself, the Premier League has a number of official partners and suppliers.[135] The official ball supplier for the league is Nike who have had the contract since the 2000–01 season when they took over from Mitre.[136] Under its Merlin brand, Topps held the licence to produce collectables for the Premier League between 1994 and 2019 including stickers (for their sticker album) and trading cards.[137] Launched in the 2007–08 season, Topps' Match Attax, the official Premier League trading card game, is the best selling boys collectable in the UK, and is also the biggest selling sports trading card game in the world.[137][138] In October 2018, Panini were awarded the licence to produce collectables from the 2019–20 season.[139] The chocolate company Cadbury has been the official snack partner of the Premier League since 2017, and sponsored the Golden Boot, Golden Glove and Playmaker of the Season awards from the 2017–18 season to 2019–20 season.[140][141] The Coca-Cola Company (under its Coca-Cola Zero Sugar product line) sponsored these awards during the 2020–21 season with Castrol being the current sponsor as of the 2021–22 season.[142] The Premier League has the highest revenue of any association football league in the world, with total club revenues of €2.48 billion in 2009–10.[143][144] In 2013–14, due to improved television revenues and cost controls, the Premier League clubs collectively made a net profit in excess of £78 million, exceeding all other football leagues.[145] In 2010 the Premier League was awarded the Queen's Award for Enterprise in the International Trade category for its outstanding contribution to international trade and the value it brings to English football and the United Kingdom's broadcasting industry.[146] The Premier League includes some of the richest football clubs in the world. Deloitte's \"Football Money League\" listed seven Premier League clubs in the top 20 for the 2009–10 season,[147] and all 20 clubs were in the top 40 globally by the end of the 2013–14 season, largely as a result of increased broadcasting revenue.[148] In 2019, the league generated around £3.1 billion per year in domestic and international television rights.[4] Premier League clubs agreed in principle in December 2012, to radical new cost controls. The two proposals consist of a break-even rule and a cap on the amount clubs can increase their wage bill by each season. With the new television deals on the horizon, momentum has been growing to find ways of preventing the majority of the cash going straight to players and agents.[149] Central payments for the 2016–17 season amounted to £2,398,515,773 across the 20 clubs, with each team receiving a flat participation fee of £35,301,989 and additional payments for TV broadcasts (£1,016,690 for general UK rights to match highlights, £1,136,083 for each live UK broadcast of their games and £39,090,596 for all overseas rights), commercial rights (a flat fee of £4,759,404) and a notional measure of \"merit\" which was based upon final league position.[8] The merit component was a nominal sum of £1,941,609 multiplied by each finishing place, counted from the foot of the table (e.g., Burnley finished 16th in May 2017, five places counting upwards, and received 5 × £1,941,609 = £9,708,045 merit payment).[8] Since its split with the Football League, established clubs in the Premier League have a funding disparity from counterparts in lower leagues. Revenue from television rights between the leagues has played a part in this.[150] Promoted teams have found it difficult to avoid relegation in their first Premier League season. One Premier League newcomer has been relegated back to the Football League every season, save the 2001–02, 2011–12, 2017–18 & 2022–23 seasons. In the 1997–98 and 2023–24 seasons, all three promoted clubs were relegated by the season's end.[151] The Premier League distributes a portion of its television revenue as \"parachute payments\" to relegated clubs for adjustment to television revenue loss. The average Premier League team receives £41 million[152] whilst the average Championship club receives £2 million.[153] Starting with the 2013–14 season, these payments are in excess of £60 million over four seasons.[154] Critics maintain that the payments widen the gap between teams that have reached the Premier League and those that have not,[155] leading to the common occurrence of teams \"bouncing back\" soon after their relegation. Clubs which have failed to win immediate promotion back to the Premier League have seen financial problems, in some cases administration or liquidation. Further relegations down the footballing ladder have occurred for multiple clubs unable to cope with the gap.[156][157] Television has played a major role in the history of the Premier League. The League's decision to assign broadcasting rights to Sky in 1992 was at the time a radical decision, but one that has paid off. At the time, paid television was an almost untested proposition in the UK market as was charging fans to watch live televised football. However, a combination of Sky's strategy, the quality of Premier League football and the public's appetite for the game has seen the value of the Premier League's TV rights soar.[25] The Premier League sells its television rights on a collective basis. This is in contrast to some other European leagues, including La Liga, in which each club sells its rights individually, leading to a much higher share of the total income going to the top few clubs.[159] The money is divided into three parts:[160] half is divided equally between the clubs; one quarter is awarded on a merit basis based on final league position, the top club getting twenty times as much as the bottom club, and equal steps all the way down the table; the final quarter is paid out as facilities fees for games that are shown on television, with the top clubs generally receiving the largest shares of this. The income from overseas rights is divided equally between the twenty clubs.[161] Not all Premier League matches are televised in the United Kingdom, as the league upholds the long-standing prohibition on telecasts of any association football match (domestic or otherwise) that kicks off between 2:45 p.m. and 5:15 p.m. on Saturday matchdays.[162][163][164] The first Sky television rights agreement was worth £304 million over five seasons.[165] The next contract, negotiated to start from the 1997–98 season, rose to £670 million over four seasons.[165] The third contract was a £1.024 billion deal with BSkyB for the three seasons from 2001 to 2004. The league brought in £320 million from the sale of its international rights for the three-year period from 2004 to 2007. It sold the rights itself on a territory-by-territory basis.[166] Sky's monopoly was broken from August 2006 when Setanta Sports was awarded rights to show two out of the six packages of matches available. This occurred following an insistence by the European Commission that exclusive rights should not be sold to one television company. Sky and Setanta paid £1.7 billion, a two-thirds increase which took many commentators by surprise as it had been widely assumed that the value of the rights had levelled off following many years of rapid growth. Setanta also hold rights to a live 3 pm match solely for Irish viewers. The BBC retained the rights to show highlights for the same three seasons (on Match of the Day) for £171.6 million, a 63 per cent increase on the £105 million it paid for the previous three-year period.[167] Sky and BT Group (via its new channel BT Sport, now TNT Sports) agreed to jointly pay £84.3 million for delayed television rights to 242 games (that is the right to broadcast them in full on television and over the internet) in most cases for a period of 50 hours after 10 p.m. on matchday.[168] Overseas television rights fetched £625 million, nearly double the previous contract.[169] The total raised from those deals was more than £2.7 billion, giving Premier League clubs an average media income from league games of around £40 million-a-year from 2007 to 2010.[170] The TV rights agreement between the Premier League and Sky faced accusations of being a cartel, and a number of court cases arose as a result.[171] An investigation by the Office of Fair Trading in 2002 found BSkyB to be dominant within the pay TV sports market, but concluded that there were insufficient grounds for the claim that BSkyB had abused its dominant position.[172] In July 1999 the Premier League's method of selling rights collectively for all member clubs was investigated by the UK Restrictive Practices Court, which concluded that the agreement was not contrary to the public interest.[173] The BBC's highlights package on Saturday and Sunday nights, as well as other evenings when fixtures justify, ran until 2016.[174] Television rights alone for the period 2010 to 2013 were purchased for £1.782 billion.[175] On 22 June 2009, due to troubles encountered by Setanta Sports after it failed to meet a final deadline over a £30 million payment to the Premier League, ESPN was awarded two packages of UK rights containing 46 matches that were available for the 2009–10 season as well as a package of 23 matches per season from 2010 to 2013.[176] On 13 June 2012, the Premier League announced that BT had been awarded 38 games a season for the 2013–14, 2014–15 and 2015–16 seasons at £246 million-a-year. The remaining 116 games were retained by Sky, which paid £760 million-a-year. The total domestic rights raised £3.018 billion, an increase of 70.2% over the 2010–11 to 2012–13 rights.[177] The value of the licensing deal rose by another 70.2% in 2015, when Sky and BT paid £5.136 billion to renew their contracts with the Premier League for another three years up to the 2018–19 season.[178] A new rights cycle began in the 2019–20 season, with the domestic package increasing to 200 matches overall; in February 2018, BT were awarded the package of 32 lunchtime fixtures on Saturdays, whilst Sky was awarded four of the seven packages, covering the majority of weekend fixtures (including eight new prime time fixtures on Saturdays), as well as Monday and Friday matches. Two remaining packages of 20 fixtures each were to be sold at a later date, including three rounds of mid-week fixtures and a bank holiday round. As Sky already owned the maximum number of matches it could hold without breaching a 148-match cap, it was speculated that at least one of the new packages could go to a new entrant, such as a streaming service. The five packages sold to BT and Sky were valued at £4.464 billion.[179] In June 2018, it was announced that Amazon Prime Video and BT had acquired the remaining two packages; Amazon acquired rights to 20 matches per-season, covering a mid-week round in December, and all Boxing Day fixtures.[180] The Amazon telecasts are produced in association with Sunset + Vine and BT Sport.[181] With the resumption of play in the 2019–20 Premier League due to the COVID-19 pandemic in the United Kingdom, the Premier League announced that all remaining matches would be carried on British television, split primarily across Sky, BT, and Amazon. A large number of these matches were also scheduled for free-to-air broadcasts, with Sky airing 25 on Pick, Amazon streaming its four matches on Twitch, and the BBC – for the first time in league history – carrying four live matches.[182][183][184][185] As matches would continue to be played without spectators upon the start of the 2020–21 Premier League, its clubs voted on 8 September to continue broadcasting all matches through at least September (with the BBC and Amazon each holding one additional match), and \"appropriate arrangements\" being made for October.[186][187] It was later announced that matches not selected for broadcast would be carried on pay-per-view via BT Sport Box Office and Sky Box Office at a cost of £14.95 per-match. The PPV scheme was poorly received; the Football Supporters' Federation felt that the price was too high, and there were concerns that it could encourage piracy. There were calls from supporters to boycott the pay-per-views, and make donations to support charitable causes instead (with Newcastle's \"Charity Not PPV\" campaign raising £20,000 for a local food bank, and Arsenal fans raising £34,000 for Islington Giving). On 13 November, amid the reintroduction of measures across the UK, the Premier League officially announced that the non-televised matches would be assigned to its main broadcast partners, and again including additional matches for the BBC and Amazon Prime.[188][189][190][191] The next cycle of rights between 2022–23 and 2024–25 season was renewed without tender due to compelling and exceptional circumstances in light of the COVID-19 pandemic. Therefore, rights remained as they were since the 2019–20 season.[192] UK highlights In August 2016, it was announced the BBC would be creating a new magazine-style show for the Premier League entitled The Premier League Show.[193] The Premier League is the most-watched football league in the world, broadcast in 212 territories to 643 million homes and a potential TV audience of 4.7 billion people.[9] The Premier League's production arm, Premier League Productions, is operated by IMG Productions and produces content for its international television partners.[194] On 22 November 2024, the Premier League announced plans to end its agreement with IMG and take Premier League Productions in-house beginning in 2026–27.[195] The Premier League is the most widely distributed sports programme in Asia.[196] In the Indian subcontinent, the matches are broadcast live on STAR Sports.[197] In MENA region, BeIN Sports holds exclusive rights to the Premier League.[198] In China, the broadcast rights were awarded to iQiyi, Migu and CCTV that began in the 2021–22 season.[199][200][201] SCTV broadcast the matches for Indonesia, and Astro for Malaysia. In Australia, Optus telecommunications holds exclusive rights to the Premier League, providing live broadcasts and online access (Fox Sports formerly held rights).[202] As of the 2022–23 season, Canadian media rights to the Premier League are owned by FuboTV,[203] after having been jointly owned by Sportsnet and TSN, and most recently DAZN.[204] The Premier League is broadcast in the United States by NBC Sports, a division of Sky parent Comcast.[205] Acquiring the rights to the Premier League in 2013 (replacing Fox Soccer and ESPN), NBC Sports has been widely praised for its coverage.[206][207][208] NBC Sports reached a six-year extension with the Premier League in 2015 to broadcast the league until the end of the 2021–22 season in a deal valued at $1 billion (£640 million).[209][210] In November 2021, NBC reached another six-year extension through 2028 in a deal valued at $2.76 billion (£2 billion).[211][212] The Premier League is broadcast by SuperSport across sub-Saharan Africa.[213] Broadcasters to continental Europe until 2025 include Canal+ for France,[214] Sky Sport Germany for Germany and Austria,[215] Match TV for Russia,[216] Sky Sport Italy for Italy,[217] Eleven Sports for Portugal,[218] DAZN for Spain,[219] beIN Sports Turkey to Turkey,[220] Digi Sport for Romania,[221] and NENT to Nordic countries (Sweden, Denmark and Norway),[222] Poland and the Netherlands.[223] In South America, ESPN covers much of the continent,[224] with coverage in Brazil shared between ESPN Brasil and ESPN4.[225][226] Paramount+ broadcasts the league in Central America.[227] As of the 2023–24 season, Premier League football has been played in 61 stadiums since the formation of the division.[228] The Hillsborough disaster in 1989 and the subsequent Taylor Report saw a recommendation that standing terraces should be abolished. As a result, all stadiums in the Premier League are all-seater.[229][230] Since the formation of the Premier League, football grounds in England have seen constant improvements to capacity and facilities, with some clubs moving to new-build stadiums.[231] Eleven stadiums that have seen Premier League football have now been demolished. The stadiums for the 2023–24 season show a large disparity in capacity. For example, Old Trafford, the home of Manchester United, has a capacity of 74,031 whilst Dean Court, the home of Bournemouth, has a capacity of 11,307. The combined total capacity of the Premier League in the 2023–24 season is 787,002 with an average capacity of 39,350. Stadium attendances are a significant source of regular income for Premier League clubs.[232] For the 2022–23 season, average attendances across the league clubs were 40,235 for Premier League matches with an aggregate attendance of 15,289,340.[233] This represents an increase of 19,109 from the average attendance of 21,126 recorded in the Premier League's first season (1992–93).[234] However, during the 1992–93 season, the capacities of most stadiums were reduced as clubs replaced terraces with seats in order to meet the Taylor Report's 1994–95 deadline for all-seater stadiums.[235][236] The 2022–23 season also set a competition record for total attendance with more than 15 million spectators, with average attendance also reaching record levels, surpassing the previous record of 39,989 set in the 2021–22 season, which in turn broke over 70 years old record set in 1948–49 season.[237] In October 2024 it was reported that the government is planning to grant the independent regulator authority to stop Premier League clubs from selling their stadiums to affiliated or third-party companies.[238] I have never known this level before. Of course, there are managers in Germany, Italy, and Spain, but in the Premier League, these are the best managers, the elite managers. The quality, the preparation. The level is so high. Managers in the Premier League are involved in the day-to-day running of the team, including the training, team selection and player acquisition. Their influence varies from club-to-club and is related to the ownership of the club and the relationship of the manager with fans.[240] Managers are required to have a UEFA Pro Licence which is the final coaching qualification available, and follows the completion of the UEFA 'B' and 'A' Licences.[241] The UEFA Pro Licence is required by every person who wishes to manage a club in the Premier League on a permanent basis (i.e., more than 12 weeks, the amount of time an unqualified caretaker manager is allowed to take control).[242] Caretaker appointments are managers that fill the gap between a managerial departure and a new appointment. Several caretaker managers have gone on to secure a permanent managerial post after performing well as a caretaker, including Paul Hart at Portsmouth, David Pleat at Tottenham Hotspur and Ole Gunnar Solskjær at Manchester United. Arsène Wenger is the longest-serving manager, having been in charge of Arsenal in the Premier League from 1996 to his departure at the conclusion of the 2017–18 season, and holds the record for most matches managed in the Premier League with 828, all with Arsenal. He broke the record set by Alex Ferguson, who had managed 810 matches with Manchester United from the Premier League's inception to his retirement at the end of the 2012–13 season. Ferguson was in charge of Manchester United from November 1986 until his retirement at the end of the 2012–13 season, meaning he was manager for the last five years of the old Football League First Division and all of the first 21 seasons of the Premier League.[243] Notably, since its creation the Premier League has never been won by an English manager. There have been several studies into the reasoning behind, and effects of, managerial sackings. Most famously, Sue Bridgewater of the University of Liverpool and Bas ter Weel of the University of Amsterdam, performed two separate studies which helped to explain the statistics behind managerial sackings. Bridgewater's study found clubs generally sack their managers upon dropping below an average of one point per match.[244] Player transfers may only take place within transfer windows set by the Football Association. The two transfer windows run from the last day of the season to 31 August and from 31 December to 31 January. Player registrations cannot be exchanged outside these windows except under specific licence from the FA, usually on an emergency basis.[246] As of the 2010–11 season, the Premier League introduced new rules mandating that each club must register a maximum 25-man squad of players aged over 21, with the squad list only allowed to be changed in transfer windows or in exceptional circumstances.[247][248] This was to enable the \"home grown\" rule to be enacted, whereby the Premier League would also from 2010 require at least eight members of the named 25-man squad to be \"home-grown players\".[247] At the inception of the Premier League in 1992–93, just 11 players named in the starting line-ups for the first round of matches hailed from outside of the United Kingdom or Ireland.[249] By 2000–01, the number of foreign players participating in the Premier League was 36% of the total. In the 2004–05 season, the figure had increased to 45%. On 26 December 1999, Chelsea became the first Premier League side to field an entirely foreign starting line-up,[250] and on 14 February 2005, Arsenal were the first to name a completely foreign 16-man squad for a match.[251] By 2009, under 40% of the players in the Premier League were English.[252] By February 2020, 117 different nationalities had played in the Premier League, and 101 nationalities had scored in the competition.[253] In 1999, in response to concerns that clubs were increasingly passing over young English players in favour of foreign players, the Home Office tightened its rules for granting work permits to players from countries outside of the European Union.[254] A non-EU player applying for the permit must have played for his country in at least 75 per cent of its competitive 'A' team matches for which he was available for selection during the previous two years, and his country must have averaged at least 70th place in the official FIFA world rankings over the previous two years. If a player does not meet those criteria, the club wishing to sign him may appeal.[255] Following the implementation of Brexit in January 2021, new regulations were introduced which require all foreign players to obtain a Governing Body Endorsement (GBE) in order to play football in the United Kingdom, regardless of EU status.[256] Italics denotes players still playing professional football,Bold denotes players still playing in the Premier League. The Premier League Golden Boot is awarded each season to the top scorer in the division. Former Blackburn Rovers and Newcastle United striker Alan Shearer holds the record for most Premier League goals with 260.[258] Thirty-three players have reached the 100-goal mark.[259] Since the first Premier League season in 1992–93, 23 players from 11 clubs have won or shared the top scorer title.[260] Thierry Henry won his fourth overall scoring title by scoring 27 goals in the 2005–06 season. Erling Haaland holds the record for most goals in a Premier League season (38 matches) with 36 goals as of 15 May 2023.[261] Ryan Giggs of Manchester United holds the record for scoring goals in consecutive seasons, having scored in the first 21 seasons of the league.[262] Giggs also holds the record for the most Premier League assists, with 162.[263] There is no team or individual salary cap in the Premier League. As a result of the increasingly lucrative television deals, player wages rose sharply following the formation of the Premier League, when the average player wage was £75,000 per year.[264] In the 2018–19 season the average annual salary stood at £2.99 million. The total salary bill for the 20 Premier League clubs in the 2018–19 season was £1.62 billion; this compares to £1.05 billion in La Liga, £0.83 billion in Serie A, £0.72 billion in Bundesliga, and £0.54 billion in Ligue 1. The club with the highest average wage is Manchester United at £6.5 million. This is smaller than the club with the highest wage bill in Spain (Barcelona £10.5 million) and Italy (Juventus £6.7 million), but higher than in Germany (Bayern Munich £6.4 million) and France (Paris Saint-Germain £6.1 million). For the 2018–19 season, the ratio of the wages of the highest-paid team to lowest-paid in the Premier League is 6.82 to 1. This is much lower than in La Liga (19.1 to 1), Serie A (16 to 1), Bundesliga (20.5 to 1), and Ligue 1 (26.6 to 1). Because of the lower differential between team wage bills in the Premier League, it is often regarded as being more competitive than other top European leagues.[265] The record transfer fee for a Premier League player has risen steadily over the lifetime of the competition. Before the start of the first Premier League season, Alan Shearer became the first British player to command a transfer fee of more than £3 million.[266] The record has increased steadily and Enzo Fernández is now the most expensive transfer fee paid by a Premier League club at £106.8 million, whilst Philippe Coutinho is the biggest transfer involving a Premier League club at £105 million. The Premier League maintains two trophies – the genuine trophy (held by the reigning champions) and a spare replica. Two trophies are held for the purpose of making the award within minutes of the title being secured, in the event that on the final day of the season two clubs are still within reach of winning the League.[293] In the rare event that more than two clubs are vying for the title on the final day of the season, a replica won by a previous club is used.[294] The current Premier League trophy was created by Royal Jewellers Garrard & Co/Asprey of London and was designed in house at Garrard & Co by Trevor Brown and Paul Marsden. It consists of a trophy with a golden crown and a malachite plinth base. The plinth weighs 33 pounds (15 kg) and the trophy weighs 22 pounds (10.0 kg).[295] The trophy and plinth are 76 cm (30 in) tall, 43 cm (17 in) wide and 25 cm (9.8 in) deep.[296] Its main body is solid sterling silver and silver gilt, whilst its plinth is made of malachite, a semi-precious stone. The plinth has a silver band around its circumference, upon which the names of the title-winning clubs are listed. The green of the malachite represents the green field of play.[296] The design of the trophy is based on the heraldry of Three Lions that is associated with English football. Two of the lions are found above the handles on either side of the trophy – the third is symbolised by the captain of the title-winning team as he raises the trophy, and its gold crown, above his head at the end of the season.[297] The ribbons that drape the handles are presented in the team colours of the league champions that year. In 2004, a special gold version of the trophy was commissioned to commemorate Arsenal winning the title without a single defeat.[298] In addition to the winner's trophy and the individual winner's medals awarded to players who win the title, the Premier League also issues other awards throughout the season.

                "content": "Theodore Edmond Bridgewater Jr.[1] (born November 10, 1992) is an American professional football quarterback for the Detroit Lions of the National Football League (NFL). He played college football for the Louisville Cardinals, winning the 2013 Sugar Bowl, and was selected as the final first round pick of the 2014 NFL draft by the Minnesota Vikings. During his second season, Bridgewater led the Vikings to a division title and earned Pro Bowl honors. Upon suffering a severe leg injury the following offseason, Bridgewater appeared in only one game over the next two years. Bridgewater joined the New Orleans Saints in 2018 as a backup, but served as the team's starter in relief of Drew Brees and helped contribute to them winning their conference's top seed. He later held starting roles with the Carolina Panthers and Denver Broncos for one season each and spent his last two seasons as a backup for the Miami Dolphins and Detroit Lions. After initially retiring from the NFL in 2023, Bridgewater became the head football coach at Miami Northwestern, his former high school. Bridgewater returned to the Detroit Lions in 2024 after leading Miami Northwestern to a state championship. The son of Teddy Bridgewater Sr. and Rose Murphy, Bridgewater was born in Miami, Florida, on November 10, 1992. He attended Miami Northwestern Senior High School.[2] The school's football field was later renamed in his honor.[3] In his sophomore year, Bridgewater replaced Jacory Harris as starting quarterback and took over a team that had been named the 2007 national champions by USA Today. Bridgewater completed 97 of 160 attempts (60.6 percent) for 1,560 yards over the season, throwing 16 touchdowns with three interceptions. He also carried 45 times for 211 yards (4.7 average) and two more scores. Northwestern finished the season 13–3, falling short to Seminole High School of Sanford 28–21 in the 6A state title game.[4] As a junior, Bridgewater passed for 2,546 yards and 32 touchdowns and rushed for 379 yards and five more scores. In a late-September game against Hialeah-Miami Lakes High School, he completed 19 of 24 passes for 327 yards and a Dade County record of seven touchdowns.[5] Bridgewater was named second-team All-State for 6A classification and first-team All-County by the Miami Herald. Northwestern finished the season 10–2, after a 29–16 loss to rival Miami Central High School. As a senior, Bridgewater had 2,606 passing yards and 22 touchdowns despite missing parts of the season with a medial collateral ligament injury. He also rushed for 223 yards and eight more scores. Northwestern had a 9–3 record for the season, losing 42–27 to Miami Central in the 6-A semifinals, in which he threw for 436 yards and scored four touchdowns. Regarded as a four-star recruit, Bridgewater was considered the sixth best dual-threat quarterback prospect in the nation by Rivals.com.[6] He played in the 2011 U.S. Army All-American Bowl.[7] Bridgewater originally committed to the University of Miami in June 2010.[8] However, after the firing of Miami head coach Randy Shannon in November 2010, Bridgewater switched his commitment to the University of Louisville.[9] Sources: As a freshman at Louisville in 2011, Bridgewater entered the season as a backup to Will Stein. However, by the Cardinals' fourth game of the season against Marshall, he was starting and remained the starter the rest of the year.[10][11] Bridgewater finished the season completing 191 of 296 passes for 2,129 yards, 14 touchdowns, and 12 interceptions.[12] For his play, Bridgewater was named the Big East Rookie of the Year and was named a freshman All-American by Rivals.com, Scout.com, CBS Sports, and Sporting News.[13][14][15][16][17] As a sophomore in 2012, Bridgewater started 11 of 12 regular season games. In his only non-starting action, coming off the bench while injured against Rutgers, Bridgewater led his team to a win, a Big East title, and a berth to the BCS.[18] He finished the regular season completing 267-of-387 passes for 3,452 yards, 25 touchdowns, and just seven interceptions.[19] Bridgewater finished sixth in the nation in completion percentage, eighth in yards per attempt, and seventh in passing efficiency. For his play, Bridgewater was named the Big East Offensive Player of the Year.[20] The Cardinals entered the 2013 Sugar Bowl against the Florida Gators as decided underdogs.[21][22] Although Florida boasted the nation's #1 pass efficiency defense,[23] Bridgewater passed for 266 yards and two touchdowns to become the game's MVP during a 33–23 victory.[24] As a junior in 2013, Bridgewater completed 303-of-427 passes for 3,970 yards, 31 touchdowns, and four interceptions.[25] In his final college game against the Miami Hurricanes in the 2013 Russell Athletic Bowl, Bridgewater completed 35-of-42 passes for 447 yards three touchdowns and was named the game's MVP.[26][27] As early as April 2013, Bridgewater was seen as one of the top prospects for the 2014 NFL draft, alongside Jadeveon Clowney and Johnny Manziel. Reports said that, had Bridgewater been eligible for the 2013 Draft, he most likely would have been the first quarterback taken.[28] At one point, he was projected by many to be the first overall pick in the draft.[29][30] On January 1, 2014, Bridgewater announced that he would forgo his final year of eligibility at Louisville.[31] Bridgewater was selected by the Minnesota Vikings as the 32nd and final pick of the first round of the draft.[35] The Vikings had traded their second round and fourth round picks to the Seattle Seahawks to move up and select Bridgewater.[36] He signed a four-year contract worth $6.85 million with a $3.3 million signing bonus with the Vikings.[37] Bridgewater entered the season as the second-string quarterback, behind veteran Matt Cassel, but ahead of Christian Ponder.[38] Bridgewater made his NFL debut on September 21, 2014, against the New Orleans Saints, entering in relief of the injured Cassel and finished the game with 150 passing yards.[39] Bridgewater was named the starting quarterback for the remainder of the season after Cassel, who broke his foot in the aforementioned game, was placed on injured reserve.[40] On September 28, 2014, Bridgewater made his first NFL start against the Atlanta Falcons and won the game, in large part due to his 317 passing yards, and scored his first NFL touchdown on a 13-yard rush.[41] After spraining his ankle during the Falcons matchup, Bridgewater was inactive for the next game against the Green Bay Packers in Week 5. However, he was able to recover in time for the Week 6 game against the Detroit Lions. However, a weak offensive line against a strong Lions' defense led to a 17–3 rout. Bridgewater was intercepted three times, two from tipped passes, and was sacked eight times.[42] During Week 7 against the Buffalo Bills, Bridgewater threw his first NFL touchdown pass to Cordarrelle Patterson. Despite being sacked five times and throwing two interceptions, Bridgewater helped the Vikings get a 16–10 lead, but the effort was negated only by the Bills' comeback win which put them up 17–16 with no time to retaliate.[43] In the next game against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, Bridgewater threw for 241 yards and a touchdown and was sacked only once. He led a game-tying drive to force overtime, where fellow first-round pick Anthony Barr made a fumble recovery on the Bucs' first overtime play, giving the Vikings a 19–13 win.[44] His third win as a starter, a 29–26 comeback win over the Washington Redskins, broke a franchise record shared by Fran Tarkenton and Ponder for wins among starting rookie quarterbacks.[45] Bridgewater added to this record with wins over the Carolina Panthers, New York Jets, and Chicago Bears in weeks 13, 14, and 17 respectively.[46][47][48] The win over the Jets is notable for when wide receiver Jarius Wright turned a screen pass from Bridgewater into an 87-yard touchdown, giving the Vikings another overtime win. Bridgewater finished his rookie year with 2,919 passing yards, 14 touchdowns, 12 interceptions, and an 85.2 passer rating. He also rushed for 209 yards and a touchdown.[49] He played in 13 games, starting 12 of them. On January 13, 2015, Bridgewater was selected as the quarterback of the 2014 NFL All-Rookie team by the Pro Football Writers of America, joining Tommy Kramer as the only Vikings quarterbacks to claim this award.[50] Bridgewater also won the 2014 Pepsi Rookie of the Year award, as voted by fans.[51] Bridgewater threw for no touchdowns and an interception behind a struggling offensive line that allowed five sacks in the 3–20 loss at the San Francisco 49ers in Week 1.[52] He threw only 18 times the next game, but completed 14 of those passes for 153 yards and threw his first touchdown pass of the year to tight end Kyle Rudolph in a 26–16 win over the Lions in Minnesota's home opener.[53] Bridgewater had some struggles in week three against the San Diego Chargers, going 13 of 24 for 121 yards and one interception but won the game 31–14 with a strong performance by the defense and running back Adrian Peterson.[54] He rebounded to go 27 of 41, 269 yards and a touchdown pass to Mike Wallace against Denver Broncos who had the number one ranked defense coming into the game. Minnesota still lost 23–20 as Bridgewater was sacked seven times.[55] Coming off of a bye week, he threw 31 times and completed 17 of them for 249 yards with another touchdown pass to Rudolph, but threw two interceptions in a sloppy 16–10 win against the Kansas City Chiefs.[56] Bridgewater then had arguably the best game of his career the next week against the Lions going 25 of 35, 316 yards, two touchdown passes and no interceptions, including his first touchdown pass to rookie Stefon Diggs.[57] That game was Bridgewater's fourth career 300+ yard passing game, and the second 300+ passing game of Bridgewater's career against the Lions. Bridgewater led his fourth career fourth-quarter comeback at the Bears despite having a below-average day going 17 of 30, 187 yards, one touchdown and one interception.[58] Bridgewater went 13 of 21 for 144 yards and an interception while also rushing for a touchdown and two-point conversion against the St. Louis Rams before he sustained a blow to the head by the Rams' safety Lamarcus Joyner that caused Bridgewater to leave the game in the fourth quarter. Minnesota still managed to pull off a 21–18 victory in overtime against the Rams.[59] At home against the Bears in week 15, Bridgewater completed 17 of 20 pass attempts, four passing touchdowns, and a rushing touchdown in a 38–17 win, giving him a career-high passer rating (154.4).[60][61] In a fight for the NFC North Division Title in week 17 against the Packers, Bridgewater connected only 52.6% of his passes for 99 yards and an interception. Despite his career-lowest passer rating (45.7), the Vikings pulled off a 20–13 victory and won their first division title since 2009.[62][63] Bridgewater finished his second season with 3,231 passing yards, 14 touchdowns, and 9 interceptions. He also rushed for 192 yards and 3 touchdowns. During the wild-card round against the Seahawks in one of the coldest games ever played, Bridgewater was 17-of-24 for 146 yards as the Vikings fell 10–9 after Blair Walsh missed a 27-yard field goal.[64] On January 25, 2016, Bridgewater was named to his first Pro Bowl.[65] During a team practice on August 30, 2016, Bridgewater suffered a non-contact injury to his left leg. An ambulance took Bridgewater off the field and the rest of practice was canceled.[66] A subsequent MRI confirmed that Bridgewater tore his ACL and suffered other structural damage, including a dislocation of the knee joint. The injury was so severe that Bridgewater was at risk of losing his leg, with the surgeon describing it as a \"horribly grotesque injury... It's almost like a war wound. Everything is blown.\"[67] As a result, Bridgewater missed the rest of the 2016 season.[68][69] After the loss of Bridgewater for at least the 2016 season, the Vikings traded a first-round pick in the 2017 NFL draft and a conditional fourth-round pick in the 2018 NFL draft to the Philadelphia Eagles for quarterback Sam Bradford.[70] In 2016, the Vikings went 8–8, finishing third in the NFC North and missing the playoffs, despite starting the season with a 5–0 record.[71] The media initially reported that Bridgewater's injury would keep him out for 17–19 months, meaning he would miss the entire 2017 season. In January 2017, doctors confirmed that the healing would indeed take 19 months.[72] On May 1, 2017, the Vikings declined the fifth-year option on Bridgewater's contract, making him a free agent after the 2017 season.[73] Bridgewater began throwing and doing individual work in May at Vikings mini-camps. Head coach Mike Zimmer said on June 6, that Bridgewater \"has a long way to go\" until he is fully healed, but was impressed by his rehabilitation progress to that point.[74] However, on September 2, the Vikings announced that Bridgewater would begin the season on the PUP list, meaning that he would miss the first six games to begin the year.[75] On October 16, Bridgewater was cleared to practice, but could not return to action for three more weeks.[76][77] He was activated off PUP to the active roster on November 8 to be Case Keenum's backup.[78][79] Bridgewater entered the Week 15 game against the Cincinnati Bengals in relief of Keenum in the fourth quarter. The crowd gave Bridgewater a standing ovation as he walked onto the field.[80] Bridgewater finished with an interception out of two pass attempts as the Vikings won 34–7.[81][82] On March 18, 2018, Bridgewater signed a one-year contract with the Jets.[83][84] The contract only guaranteed a $500,000 signing bonus, though he could make up to a maximum of $15 million from a non-guaranteed salary and incentives.[85] On August 29, 2018, the Jets traded Bridgewater and a 2019 sixth-round draft pick to the Saints for a 2019 third-round draft pick.[86][87] Bridgewater made his Saints debut on October 8 against the Redskins, taking a knee twice to close out the game. He did this in two more games later in the season.[88] On December 28, with the Saints already having locked up the #1 seed, the team announced that Bridgewater would start in the season finale against the Panthers.[89] Making his first start since 2015, Bridgewater finished the game completing 14 of 22 passes for 118 yards, a touchdown, and an interception as the Saints lost 33–14. He also rushed for 12 yards.[90] On March 15, 2019, Bridgewater signed a one-year, $7.25 million fully guaranteed contract with the Saints.[91] During Week 2, he replaced Drew Brees, who left with a right thumb injury, completing 17 of 30 passes for 165 yards in a 27–9 loss to the Los Angeles Rams.[92] Due to Brees's injury, Bridgewater was named the starting quarterback for Week 3. In that game, Bridgewater completed 19 of 27 passes for 177 yards and two touchdowns as the Saints defeated the Seahawks on the road by a score of 33–27. This was the first game where Bridgewater threw for more than one touchdown in a game since week 15 of the 2015 season. In Week 5 against the Buccaneers, Bridgewater threw for 314 yards, four touchdowns, and one interception in the 31–24 win.[93] In Week 6, against the Jacksonville Jaguars, he had 240 passing yards and one passing touchdown in the 13–6 victory.[94] In Week 7, against the Bears, he had 281 passing yards and two passing touchdowns.[95] Brees returned from his injury in Week 8 against the Arizona Cardinals.[96] On March 26, 2020, Bridgewater signed a three-year, $63 million contract with the Panthers.[97] Bridgewater made his Panthers debut in the season-opening 34–30 loss to the Las Vegas Raiders and finished the game with 269 passing yards, including a 75-yard touchdown to former Jets teammate Robby Anderson.[98] During Week 2 against the Buccaneers, Bridgewater finished with 367 passing yards and two interceptions as the Panthers lost, 31–17.[99] In Week 3 against the Los Angeles Chargers, Bridgewater threw for 235 yards and one touchdown during the 21–16 win. This was Bridgewater's first win as a Panther.[100] In Week 5 against the Falcons, Bridgewater threw for 313 yards and two touchdowns during the 23–16 win.[101] In Week 9 against the Chiefs, Bridgewater threw for 310 yards and two touchdowns and rushed for 19 yards and another touchdown during the 33–31 loss.[102] Bridgewater finished the season with career-high totals in several statistics, including completions (340), passing yards (3,733), touchdowns (15) and rushing yards (279).[103] On April 28, 2021, weeks after the Panthers acquired Sam Darnold in a trade with the Jets, Bridgewater was traded to the Broncos in exchange for a 2021 sixth-round pick.[104] The team brought in Bridgewater to compete with incumbent quarterback Drew Lock, and the players split starts throughout the 2021 preseason.[105] On August 25, 2021, the Broncos announced that Bridgewater had won the starting job.[106] On September 12, Bridgewater made his Broncos debut on the road against the New York Giants, completing 28-of-36 passes for 264 yards and two touchdowns in a 27–13 season-opening victory.[107] He then led the team to 2–0 with a victory over the Jaguars in Week 2 with a 328-yard, two-touchdown day.[108] Bridgewater suffered a concussion in the Broncos Week 15 loss to the Bengals ruling him out for the rest of the season.[109] Bridgewater was placed on injured reserve on January 5, 2022.[110] He finished the 2021 season with 3,052 passing yards, 18 passing touchdowns, and seven interceptions to go along with two rushing touchdowns.[111] On March 17, 2022, Bridgewater signed a one-year contract with the Miami Dolphins worth up to $10 million.[112] Bridgewater made his first appearance for the Dolphins in Week 3 against the Bills after starter Tua Tagovailoa briefly left the game in the second quarter. He attempted two passes and was sacked once before Tagovailoa returned in the second half.[113] In Week 4 against the Bengals, Bridgewater came in the second quarter after Tagovailoa left the game with a head and neck injury. Bridgewater threw for 193 yards, a touchdown, and an interception in the 27–15 loss.[114][115] During Week 5 against the Jets, Bridgewater committed an intentional grounding penalty that occurred in the endzone for a safety. During the play, he was hit by Sauce Gardner and left the game due to a concussion.[116] In Week 6, against the Vikings, Bridgewater came into the game in relief of Skylar Thompson and passed for 329 yards, two touchdowns, and two interceptions in the 24–16 loss.[117] Following Tua Tagovailoa entering concussion protocols after their Week 16 loss against the Packers, head coach Mike McDaniel announced that Bridgewater would start against the New England Patriots in Week 17.[118] In the game, Bridgewater completed 12-of-19 passes for 161 yards, a touchdown, and an interception that was returned for a touchdown before exiting the game in the third quarter after suffering a broken finger in his throwing hand. The Dolphins went on to lose 23–21.[119] As a result of the injury, third-string rookie quarterback Skylar Thompson made his second start of the season in Week 18 against the Jets.[120] On August 10, 2023, Bridgewater signed with the Lions, a move which reunited him with Dan Campbell, the assistant head coach during his time with the Saints.[121] On December 16, 2023, Bridgewater announced his plans to retire from the NFL following the conclusion of the season, and become a high school football coach.[122] Bridgewater officially announced his retirement for the first time on February 2, 2024.[123] On December 26, 2024, Bridgewater announced on NFL Network that he intended to continue his playing career in the NFL, and that he would be re-signed by the Lions, joining Hendon Hooker in backing up starting quarterback Jared Goff.[124] After the Lions' 2023 season ended with a loss to the 49ers in the NFC Championship game, Bridgewater formally confirmed his retirement from playing, and was shortly named the head coach for Miami Northwestern High School, his alma mater.[125] In his first season, Bridgewater and Miami Northwestern won the Class 3A Florida High School Athletic Association state title.[126] Bridgewater grew up in Miami as the youngest of four children to a single mother. He is a Christian.[127][128] He graduated from the University of Louisville with a degree in Sports Administration after the 2013 college football season.[129] His mother, Rose, is a breast cancer survivor. In 2014, soon after her son was drafted by the Vikings, Cadillac presented a pink Escalade to Rose when they learned that Bridgewater had wanted to get her one ever since he was in the third grade.[130]",

                "title": "Detroit Lions bring back QB Teddy Bridgewater",
                "content": "Senior Writer The Detroit Lions have brought back a familiar face. The team signed veteran quarterback Teddy Bridgewater to the active roster and he was on the practice field Thursday as the Lions begin on-field preparations for Monday night's game on the road against the San Francisco 49ers. Bridgewater spent last season as Jared Goff's backup in Detroit but retired after the season to coach his high school alma mater, Miami Northwestern. After leading Northwestern to a state title earlier this month, Bridgewater told NFL Network Insiders Ian Rapoport and Tom Pelissero he planned to return to the NFL. Bridgewater, 32, knows the offense and is a good fit in Detroit. \"I've been in contact with Teddy for a while. It was something that was always potentially a possibility,\" Lions head coach Dan Campbell said Thursday. \"We all know what Teddy's been doing down there and giving back to his community. They won a championship down there, so his debut at coaching worked out pretty dang good. \"But to be able to get somebody back here that's got experience – he's staying in shape, he's been throwing, just get him worked back in here a little bit. It just brings a level of professionalism, veteran presence, somebody that's great for our team, great for the position.\" Bridgewater has career stops with the Minnesota Vikings, New Orleans Saints, Carolina Panthers, Denver Broncos and Miami Dolphins. He's played in 79 games with 65 starts and has a 33-32 record, throwing for 15,120 yards, 75 touchdowns and 47 interceptions. Campbell said the move to add Bridgewater was not a sign that they are disappointed or lacking trust in second-year quarterback Hendon Hooker. The 2023 third-round pick has served as Goff's backup all season and Campbell said he has gotten 'a little bit better' each week. \"Doesn't mean we're disappointed in Hooker, that's not what this means, it just means this gives us somebody that's played a lot in the NFL, we're getting ready for the playoffs,\" Campbell said. \"And so, it'll be good to get him back in the fold with us.\" \"I understand what it looks like, but it's just a different world that we're getting ready to walk into, and I just – we felt like this was the right thing to do, especially with somebody that I have a tremendous amount of trust with and for. He understands our offense well, the guys know him well, the coaches know him well, and he brings a certain level of comfort to us.\" CHEESEHEADS FOR A DAY Lions fans will become huge Green Bay Packers fans Sunday starting at around 4:25 p.m. The Packers face the Vikings in Minnesota, and a Packers win would give the Lions an opportunity to clinch the NFC North title and the No. 1 seed in the NFC with a win Monday night in San Francisco. A Vikings win will mean that no matter what happens in the Lions-49ers game Monday night, the Week 18 matchup between the Vikings and Lions in Detroit will be a winner take all for the division title (and the No. 1 seed for Detroit) with the loser falling to the No. 5 seed and starting the playoffs on the road.

Campbell said he felt pretty good about Reeves-Maybin making it back this week after the Lions started his practice clock last week. The veteran linebacker has been out since injuring his neck Week 9 in Houston. He was a Pro Bowl special teamer for the Lions last year and is a valuable reserve at linebacker, especially in passing situations. The Lions have been hit hard by injury at linebacker with Alex Anzalone, Derrick Barnes, and Malcolm Rodriguez currently on IR. EXTRA POINT The Lions began the practice clock of wide receiver/returner Kalif Raymond Thursday, though Campbell didn't seem optimistic he would be able to play Monday in San Francisco. \"I don't feel as confident with him as I do Germ (Reeves-Maybin), but it's good to have him back out practicing,\" Campbell said of the possibility Raymond returns this week against the 49ers. \"It will be good to get him back out there running around.\" Tim Twentyman takes a look at where all four teams in the NFC North stand heading into Week 17 of the 2024 NFL season.

                "content": "NEW! Find where to watch all of your favorite sports! Dan Campbell confirms that quarterback Teddy Bridgewater is unretiring and signing with the Lions. (1:00) Quarterback Teddy Bridgewater has come out of retirement and signed with the Detroit Lions on Thursday, weeks after he coached his high school alma mater to a state championship. Lions coach Dan Campbell said Bridgewater's return does not mean the team is disappointed with current backup quarterback Hendon Hooker. Bridgewater said last week that he wanted to return to the NFL after coaching Miami Northwestern Senior High School, his alma mater, to the Class 3A Florida High School Athletic Association state title earlier this month. \"My team knows that's the plan. We wanted to win a state championship and then Coach goes back to the league, see what happens, and then come back February in the offseason, continue coaching high school football. We'll see how it plays out,\" he told NFL Network's \"The Insiders\" last week. A source told ESPN's Jeremy Fowler on Thursday that Bridgewater has received NFL coaching inquiries in recent weeks but that he wants to try to win a championship as a player before entertaining those opportunities. Bridgewater, 32, spent last season as the Lions' backup quarterback behind starter Jared Goff. Campbell said that he has been in contact with Bridgewater \"for a while\" and that re-signing him was always a possibility because of Bridgewater's leadership and familiarity with the system. The Lions organization has a tremendous amount of trust in Bridgewater and has followed him throughout his high school coaching journey this year. \"It just brings a level of professionalism, veteran presence, somebody that's great for our team, he's great for the position,\" Campbell said. \"Doesn't mean we're disappointed in Hooker. That's not what this means. It just means this gives us somebody that's played a lot in the NFL. We're getting ready for the playoffs, and so it'll be good to get him back in the fold with us.\" The Lions have continued to develop Hooker, who has \"improved,\" according to Campbell. Hooker has learned under Goff after becoming the Lions' highest-drafted quarterback since Matthew Stafford went No. 1 in 2009. Hooker was selected as the 68th overall pick in the third round of the 2023 NFL draft. However, Campbell said he feels that the addition of Bridgewater is \"great\" for the team, not only on the field, but in practices, as well, with his friendly demeanor and many years of experience that fit well with players. \"This does not mean that Hooker is out. That's not what this means. If it comes to that, Hooker's going to play for us, but Teddy probably will, too,\" Campbell said. \"So, I understand what it looks like, but it's just a different world that we're getting ready to walk into, and we felt like this was the right thing to do.\" Goff said \"it's cool\" to have Bridgewater back on the team. \"I'm glad I have him back here, state champ Teddy Bridgewater is what we call him now, but yeah, he's a valuable asset to our team and I love having him in the quarterback room and he's great to have around,\" Goff said. After retiring, Bridgewater was hired by Miami Northwestern in February, tasked with turning around a program that went 4-6 the previous season. Miami Northwestern went 12-2 this season, outscoring its opponents 262-12 in five playoff games. It finished the season on a 10-game winning streak. A first-round pick by the Minnesota Vikings in 2014, Bridgewater has had a career that was nearly derailed because of a torn ACL and a dislocated knee sustained during training camp in 2016; he missed all of that season and most of 2017 before leaving the Vikings. He spent two seasons with the New Orleans Saints (2018-19), started 29 games over two seasons for the Carolina Panthers (2020) and Denver Broncos (2021), and served as Tua Tagovailoa's backup with the Miami Dolphins in 2022, when he was limited by injuries again. He then signed with the Lions for his last season and appeared in one game to kneel out a victory. ESPN's Eric Woodyard contributed to this report.",

                "content": "Editions: En/nfl/detroit-lions The quarterback retired after the 2023 NFL season Two weeks after leading his high school alma mater to a state championship, Teddy Bridgewater is returning to the NFL. The 32-year-old quarterback will rejoin the Detroit Lions, coach Dan Campbell confirmed Thursday. Currently, the Lions' quarterback room is compromised of Jared Goff as Detroit's undisputed starter, second-year player Hendon Hooker, and former fifth-rounder Jake Fromm on the practice squad. Campbell outlined the Lions' objectives for signing Bridgewater for the rest of the season. \"It just brings a level of professionalism, veteran presence, somebody that's great for our team, he's great for the position.,\" Campbell said. \"Doesn't mean we're disappointed in [Hendon] Hooker. That's not what this means. It just means this gives us somebody that's played a lot in the NFL. It'll be good to get him back in the fold with us.\" Related: Bridgewater's return adds depth to the Lions' quarterback room, which currently includes starter Jared Goff and promising young backup Hendon Hooker. Campbell emphasized that Bridgewater's signing does not reflect any dissatisfaction with Hooker's development. \"This does not mean we're disappointed in [Hendon] Hooker,\"Campbell reiterated. \"That's not what this means. It just means this gives us somebody that's played a lot in the NFL.\" Bridgewater, a first-round pick by the Minnesota Vikings in 2014, spent last season as Goff's backup in Detroit. He briefly retired from the NFL earlier this year to coach his high school alma mater, Miami Northwestern, leading them to a state championship. \"My team knows that's the plan. We wanted to win a state championship and then coach goes back to the league, see what happens, and then come back February in the offseason, continue coaching high school football,\"Bridgewater told NFL Network's \"The Insiders\" last week. Bridgewater brings valuable experience to the Lions, having played for multiple teams throughout his career. He will provide veteran leadership and insurance for Goff as the team makes a playoff push in the final weeks of the season. The Lions currently hold a 13-2 record and are poised for a deep playoff run. Bridgewater's return adds another layer of depth and experience to a team already brimming with talent. © Unidad Editorial Información Deportiva, S.L.U. All rights reserved. Follow us",

                "content": "Defunct Newspapers Journals TV channels Websites Other Economics Gun rights Identity politics Nativist Religion Watchdog groups Youth/student groups Miscellaneous Other Sean Patrick Hannity[3] (born December 30, 1961)[4] is an American conservative television presenter, broadcaster and writer.[5][6][7] He hosts The Sean Hannity Show, a nationally syndicated talk radio show, has hosted a self-titled political commentary program on Fox News since 2009, and co-hosted the original Fox News debate show Hannity & Colmes with Alan Colmes from the network's founding in 1996 to 2009. Hannity worked as a general contractor and volunteered as a talk show host at UC Santa Barbara in 1989. He later joined WVNN in Athens, Alabama, and shortly afterward, WGST in Atlanta. After leaving WGST, he worked at WABC in New York until 2013. Since 2014, Hannity has worked at WOR.[8] In 1996, Hannity and Alan Colmes co-hosted Hannity & Colmes on Fox. After Colmes announced his departure in January 2008, Hannity merged the Hannity & Colmes show into Hannity.[9] Hannity has said he is not a journalist, and he has been characterized as a propagandist.[10] He has promoted conspiracy theories, such as \"birtherism\" (claims that then-President Barack Obama was not a legitimate U.S. citizen), claims regarding the murder of Seth Rich, falsehoods about Hillary Clinton's health, and false claims of election fraud in the 2020 presidential election.[11] Hannity was an early supporter of Donald Trump in the 2016 presidential election and often acted as an unofficial spokesman for him.[12] When Trump was president, White House advisors characterized Hannity as the \"shadow\" chief of staff,[13] and he reportedly phoned the White House and spoke to Trump most weeknights.[14] According to Forbes, by 2018 Hannity had become one of the most-watched hosts in cable news and most-listened-to hosts in talk radio, due in part to his closeness and access to Trump.[14] He privately urged Trump administration officials before and during the January 6 United States Capitol attack to cease some of their efforts to retain the presidency and to urge Trump's supporters to leave the Capitol.[15] Hannity was among the hosts named in the Dominion Voting Systems v. Fox News Network defamation lawsuit for broadcasting false statements about the plaintiff company's voting machines that Fox News settled for $787.5 million and required Fox News to acknowledge that the broadcast statements were false.[16][17] Hannity has an honorary degree from Liberty University. He won awards from the National Association of Broadcasters in 2003 and 2007.[18] He has written three New York Times best-selling books: Let Freedom Ring: Winning the War of Liberty over Liberalism; Deliver Us from Evil: Defeating Terrorism, Despotism, and Liberalism; and Conservative Victory: Defeating Obama's Radical Agenda, and released a fourth, Live Free or Die, in 2020.[19] Hannity was born in New York City, New York, the son of Lillian (née Flynn) and Hugh Hannity.[4][20] Lillian worked as a stenographer and a corrections officer at a county jail, while Hugh was a World War II veteran and family-court officer.[21] He was the youngest of four siblings and the only boy.[21] All his grandparents immigrated to the United States from Ireland. He grew up in Franklin Square, New York on Long Island.[21] In his youth, Hannity worked as a paperboy delivering issues of the New York Daily News and the Long Island Daily Press. His parents were initially supporters of President John F. Kennedy, eventually growing more Republican in their views as time went on, though they resisted being overtly political at home.[21][22] Hannity attended Sacred Heart Seminary in Hempstead, New York[21] and St. Pius X Preparatory Seminary in Uniondale, New York.[23] He attended New York University and Adelphi University, but did not graduate from either.[21] In 1982, Hannity started a house-painting business and a few years later, worked as a building contractor in Santa Barbara, California.[24] He hosted his first talk radio show in 1989 at the volunteer college station at UC Santa Barbara, KCSB-FM, while working as a general contractor. The show aired for 40 hours of air time.[25][26] Regarding his first show, he said, \"I wasn't good at it. I was terrible.\"[27] Hannity's weekly show on KCSB was canceled after less than a year after a controversy. During two shows, gay and lesbian rights were discussed in what was considered to be a contentious manner. (See LGBT issues below.) The university board that governed the station later reversed its decision after a campaign conducted on Hannity's behalf by the Santa Barbara chapter of the American Civil Liberties Union argued that the station had discriminated against Hannity's First Amendment rights. When the station refused to issue Hannity a public apology and more airtime, he did not return to KCSB.[28][22] After leaving KCSB, Hannity placed an advertisement in radio publications, presenting himself as \"the most talked about college radio host in America\".[22] Radio station WVNN in Athens, Alabama (part of the Huntsville media market), then hired him to be the afternoon talk show host.[25] From Huntsville, he moved to WGST in Atlanta in 1992, filling the slot vacated by Neal Boortz, who had moved to competing station WSB. In September 1996, Fox News co-founder Roger Ailes hired the then relatively unknown Hannity to host a television program under the working title Hannity and LTBD (\"liberal to be determined\").[29] Alan Colmes was then hired to co-host and the show debuted as Hannity & Colmes. Later that year, Hannity left WGST for New York, where WABC had him substitute for their afternoon drive time host during Christmas week. In January 1997, WABC put Hannity on the air full-time, giving him the late-night time slot. WABC then moved Hannity to the same drive-time slot he had filled temporarily a little more than a year earlier. Hannity was on WABC's afternoon time slot from January 1998.[30] In their 2007 book Common Ground: How to Stop the Partisan War That Is Destroying America, conservative Cal Thomas and liberal Bob Beckel describe Hannity as a leader of the pack among broadcasting political polarizers, which following James Q. Wilson they define as those who have \"an intense commitment to a candidate, a culture, or an ideology that sets people in one group definitively apart from people in another, rival group\".[31] The WABC slot continued until the end of 2013. Since January 2014, Hannity has hosted the 3:00–6:00 p.m. time slot on WOR in New York City.[32] Hannity's radio program is a conservative political talk show that features Hannity's opinions and ideology related to current issues and politicians. The Sean Hannity Show began national syndication on September 10, 2001, on more than five hundred stations nationwide.[33] In 2004, Hannity signed a $25 million five-year contract extension with ABC Radio (now Citadel Media) to continue the show until 2009.[34] The program was made available via Armed Forces Radio Network in 2006.[35] In June 2007, ABC Radio was sold to Citadel Communications[36] and in the summer of 2008, Hannity was signed for a $100 million five-year contract.[37] As of March 2018, the program is heard by more than 13.5 million listeners a week.[38] Hannity was ranked No. 2 in Talkers Magazine's 2017 Heavy Hundred[39] and was listed as No. 72 on Forbes' \"Celebrity 100\" list in 2013.[40] In January 2007, Clear Channel Communications signed a groupwide three-year extension with Hannity on more than eighty stations.[41] The largest stations in the group deal included KTRH Houston, KFYI Phoenix, WPGB Pittsburgh, WKRC Cincinnati, WOOD Grand Rapids, WFLA Tampa, WOAI San Antonio, WLAC Nashville, and WREC Memphis. Hannity signed a long-term contract to remain with Premiere Networks in September 2013.[42] At the beginning of 2014, Hannity signed contracts to air on several Salem Communications stations including WDTK Detroit, WIND Chicago, WWRC (now WQOF) Washington, D.C., and KSKY Dallas.[43] Hannity was a co-host of Hannity & Colmes, an American political \"point-counterpoint\"-style television program on the Fox News Channel featuring Hannity and Alan Colmes as co-hosts. Hannity presented the conservative point of view with Colmes providing the liberal viewpoint. While Hannity's views are typically politically and socially conservative, he has spoken supportively about birth control, which has led to on-air clashes with pro-life guests such as Rev. Thomas Euteneuer, president of Human Life International.[44] Hannity said if the Catholic Church were to excommunicate him over his support for contraception, he would join Jerry Falwell's Thomas Road Baptist Church.[45] In January 2007, Hannity began a new Sunday night television show on Fox News, Hannity's America. In November 2008, Colmes announced his departure from Hannity & Colmes. After the show's final broadcast on January 9, 2009, Hannity took over the time slot with his own new show, Hannity, which has a format similar to Hannity's America. Hannity is the author of four books. Let Freedom Ring: Winning the War of Liberty over Liberalism was published in 2002, and Deliver Us from Evil: Defeating Terrorism, Despotism, and Liberalism was published in 2004 through ReganBooks. Both these books reached the nonfiction New York Times bestseller list, the second of which stayed there for five weeks.[46][47] Hannity has said he is too busy to write many books,[46] and dictated a lot of his own two books into a tape recorder while driving in to do his radio show.[48] Hannity wrote his third book, Conservative Victory: Defeating Obama's Radical Agenda, which was released by HarperCollins in March 2010.[49] The book became Hannity's third New York Times Bestseller.[50] In 2020, Hannity released his fourth book, Live Free or Die.[51] From 2003 until 2010, Hannity hosted country music-themed \"Freedom Concerts\" to raise money for charity.[52] In 2010, conservative blogger Debbie Schlussel wrote that only a small percentage of the money raised by the concerts goes to the target charity, Freedom Alliance.[53] The Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington (CREW) filed complaints with the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) and the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), also in 2010. The FTC complaint alleges that Hannity was \"falsely promoting that all concert proceeds would be donated to a scholarship fund for the children of those killed or wounded in war\".[54] The complaint filed with the IRS claims that Freedom Alliance has violated its 501(c)(3) charity status.[55] The concerts stopped around the same year.[56] Hannity has had cameo appearances in film and television, having a brief voiceover in The Siege as an unseen reporter, and appearing in Atlas Shrugged: Part II and the second season of House of Cards as himself.[61][62] He executive produced and appeared in the 2017 film Let There Be Light, which also stars Kevin Sorbo.[63] As of April 2018, Hannity owned at least 877 residential properties, which were bought for nearly $89 million.[64][65] He purchased some of the homes with the help of loans from the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development and most are in working-class neighborhoods.[66] His property managers have taken an aggressive management approach with a much higher than average eviction rate. The Washington Post reported that his property management team has used eviction proceedings both to remove tenants and to generate revenue. His property managers have claimed that Hannity has no active role in the management of the more than 1,000 properties he has a stake in.[67] According to The Washington Post, Hannity \"repeatedly embraces storylines that prove to be inaccurate\" and takes positions that change over time.[22] In the opinion of The New York Times, Hannity is \"barreling headfirst into the murky territory between opinion and out-and-out conspiracy theorism\".[21] Hannity often promotes conspiracy theories without explicitly endorsing them, unlike Alex Jones. The New York Times wrote that this \"has the effect of nourishing the more wild-eyed beliefs of his fans while providing Hannity a degree of plausible deniability\".[21] The New Yorker wrote in 2019 that Hannity had \"[spewed] baseless conspiracy theories with impunity\".[68] During the Bush years, Hannity \"loyally supported the president's policies\".[22] During the Obama administration, Hannity \"leaned more heavily on stories he believed were being given short shrift by the 'liberal media' – stories about where Obama was born, and who deserved blame for the attack on the U.S. compound in Benghazi, Libya\".[22] In 2017, The Washington Post wrote that \"what Hannity has stood for – at least for the past couple of years – is Trump.\"[22] Hannity is known for his pro-Trump coverage.[21][22][69] According to The Washington Post, \"Hannity's comeback coincided with his early, eager embrace of his fellow New Yorker ... Trump attacked the Gold Star father, and Hannity stood by him. Trump went after a federal judge of Mexican descent, and Hannity backed him. After the Access Hollywood tape emerged of Trump making lewd comments about inappropriate sexual behaviour towards women, Hannity continued to defend him: 'King David had 500 concubines, for crying out loud.'\"[22] After the inauguration, the first interview the new president gave to a cable news channel was conducted by Hannity.[22] Hannity additionally defended the Trump administration's false claim that Trump's inauguration crowd was the biggest ever.[22] Hannity has been criticized as being overly favorable to the candidacy of Trump and granting him more airtime than other presidential candidates during the 2016 primaries.[70] Hannity, for instance, let Trump promote the false claim that Rafael Cruz, father of Trump's rival presidential candidate Ted Cruz, was involved in the John F. Kennedy assassination.[22] He admitted to favoring Republican candidates, though without indicating a preference for Donald Trump over Ted Cruz.[71] According to Dylan Byers of CNN, Hannity during interviews \"frequently cites areas where he agrees with Trump, or where he thinks Trump was right about something, then asks him to expand on it\", and \"often ignores or defends Trump from criticism\".[71] Tensions between Cruz and Hannity appeared to reach a boiling point during a contentious April 2016 radio interview, during which Cruz implied Hannity was a \"hardcore Donald Trump supporter\" and Hannity responded by accusing Cruz of \"throw[ing] this in my face\" every time he asked a \"legitimate question\".[72] Jim Rutenberg commented in August 2016 that Hannity is \"not only Mr. Trump's biggest media booster; he also veers into the role of adviser,\" citing sources who said Hannity spent months offering suggestions to Trump and his campaign on strategy and messaging. Hannity responded to the report by saying, \"I'm not hiding the fact that I want Donald Trump to be the next President of the United States. ... I never claimed to be a journalist.\"[73] (In an article published in December 2017, Hannity said \"I'm a journalist. But I'm an advocacy journalist, or an opinion journalist.\")[21] Hannity also appeared in a 2016 Trump campaign ad.[74] Hannity has feuded with several conservatives who oppose Trump, including National Review's Jonah Goldberg,[75][76] Wall Street Journal foreign affairs columnist Bret Stephens,[77] and National Review editor Rich Lowry.[78] Hannity developed a close relationship with Trump during the election and became even closer during his presidency.[68] The two men spoke on the phone multiple times a week, discussing Hannity's weekday show, the special counsel investigation, even evaluating White House staff.[68][13][79][80] Hannity shares, The Economist asserts, \"Mr. Trump's love of conspiracy theories and hatred of snooty elites\".[81] They speak so often that one Trump adviser has said Hannity \"basically has a desk in the place\".[13] On the air, Hannity echoes Trump's attacks on the media and Special Counsel investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 United States elections.[82] Trump sometimes quotes Hannity to others or promotes the show to his Twitter followers.[14] Hannity has encouraged Trump to shut down the government to get funding for a border wall, as well as his declaration of a national emergency over the US–Mexico border.[14] According to reports by the Los Angeles Times and New York magazine, Hannity frequently talks to Trump by telephone after Hannity's weekday broadcasts,[80][83][14] and Hannity is one of several dozen cleared callers whose calls to the White House public switchboard can be connected directly to the president.[83] Hannity stirred controversy in April 2018 when it was revealed that he shared a lawyer, Michael Cohen, with Trump. In a breach of journalistic ethics, Hannity had failed to disclose that Cohen was his lawyer while at the same time taking to the Fox airwaves to defend Cohen and criticize those who investigated him.[84][85][86][87] On April 9, 2018, federal agents from the U.S. Attorney's office served a search warrant on the office and residence of Michael Cohen, Trump's personal attorney.[88] On the air, Hannity defended Cohen and criticized the federal action, calling it \"highly questionable\" and \"an unprecedented abuse of power\".[89] On April 16, 2018, in a court hearing, Cohen's lawyers told the judge that Cohen had ten clients in 2017–2018 but did \"traditional legal tasks\" for only three: Trump, Elliott Broidy, and a \"prominent person\" who did not wish to be named for fear of being \"embarrassed\".[90][91][92] The federal judge ordered the revelation of the third client, whom Cohen's lawyers named as Hannity.[90] Although Hannity has covered Cohen on his show, he did not disclose that he had consulted with Cohen.[93] Fox News released a statement on April 16, 2018, attributed to Hannity: \"Michael Cohen has never represented me in any matter. I never retained him, received an invoice, or paid legal fees. I have occasionally had brief discussions with him about legal questions about which I wanted his input and perspective. I assumed those conversations were confidential, but to be absolutely clear they never involved any matter between me and a third party.\"[94] Also, NBC News quoted Hannity as saying: \"We definitely had attorney–client privilege because I asked him for that,\"[95] while Hannity said on his radio show that he \"might have handed him ten bucks\" for the attorney-client privilege.[94][90] Lastly, Hannity tweeted that his discussions with Cohen were \"almost exclusively\" about real estate.[96] The following day, news reports revealed that Hannity had shared another lawyer with Trump, Jay Sekulow. Sekulow had written a cease-and-desist letter to KFAQ on Hannity's behalf in May 2017, and later represented Trump in connection with the Mueller investigation.[97][98] In August 2018, Hannity allowed Sekulow and Rudy Giuliani, another personal lawyer for Trump, to host Hannity's radio show; the duo proceeded to defend Trump and promote arguments made by the Trump administration.[99] In June 2019, Hannity expressed outrage at Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi's comment that she would like to see Trump \"in prison\". Hannity declared: \"Based on no actual crimes, she wants a political opponent locked up in prison? That happens in banana republics – beyond despicable behavior.\" Aaron Rupar of Vox criticized Hannity for \"obvious hypocrisy\", noting that Hannity himself had said in January 2018 regarding Hillary Clinton: \"I think Hillary should be in jail. Lock her up.\"[100] Aaron Blake of The Washington Post described Hannity's comment as \"a pretty obvious bit of gaslighting\", noting Hannity's loyalty to Trump, whose campaign rallies have featured chants of \"Lock her up\", and also Hannity's comments that Trump was free to investigate Clinton.[101] Hannity played the most important role in persuading Trump to pardon the convicted murderer and war criminal Clint Lorance.[102] After Trump lost the 2020 election, Hannity sent a number of text messages offering advice to Trump chief of staff Mark Meadows, including a message apparently suggesting a joint \"NC Real estate\" venture with him.[103][74] In October 2023, a staffer on his show emailed Republican lawmakers asking why they weren't supporting Representative Jim Jordan, Donald Trump's choice for House Speaker to replace Representative Kevin McCarthy.[104][105] During the 2016 presidential election, Hannity periodically promoted conspiracy theories regarding Hillary Clinton and the Democratic Party.[106][107][108][109] Hannity repeatedly claimed that Clinton had very serious medical problems and that the media was covering them up.[22][106][110][111] He misrepresented photos of Clinton to give the impression that she had secret medical problems.[106][108] He shared a photo from the fake news site Gateway Pundit and falsely claimed that it showed her Secret Service agent holding a diazepam pen intended to treat seizures, when he in fact was holding a small flashlight.[106] He booked doctors on his show to discuss Clinton's health; although these people had never personally examined Clinton, they made alarmist statements about her state of health which turned out to be false.[106][108] At one point, Hannity promoted an unsubstantiated report that Clinton had been drunk at a rally; at another point, he suggested that Clinton was drunk and that her campaign needed to \"sober her up\".[112] Although Hannity said he believed President Obama was born in the U.S., to answer queries on Obama's citizenship, he repeatedly called on Obama to release his birth certificate.[113][114] Hannity described the circumstances regarding Obama's birth certificate as \"odd\".[68] Hannity also defended and promoted those who questioned Obama's citizenship of the U.S., such as Donald Trump. Hannity invited Trump to his show while Trump was a leader in the birther movement; during an interview with Hannity, Trump said Obama \"could have easily have come from Kenya, or someplace\".[21] Hannity said in response, \"The issue could go away in a minute. Just show the certificate.\"[21] Even after Obama produced his birth certificate in 2008, certified by the state of Hawaii, Hannity kept calling on Obama to release his birth certificate, asking why did he not \"just produce it and we move on?\"[115] In October 2016, Hannity offered to purchase a one-way ticket to Kenya for Obama.[116] In May 2017, Hannity became a prominent promoter of the conspiracy theory that Hillary Clinton and the Democratic Party had a DNC staffer killed.[117][118][119][120][121][22] Shortly afterward, he faced backlash from news sources across the political spectrum and lost several advertisers, including Crowne Plaza Hotels, Cars.com, Leesa Mattress, USAA, Peloton and Casper Sleep deciding to pull their marketing from his program on Fox News.[122][123][124] However, USAA decided to return to the show shortly after following a negative outcry against its decision to pull out.[125] Conservative magazine National Review compared the story to a flat earth video, called it a \"disgrace\" that Hannity and other conspiracy theorists were hyping the story, and called for them to stop.[126] In March 2018, Seth Rich's parents filed a lawsuit against Fox News for pushing conspiracy theories about their son's death. The suit alleges that the network \"intentionally exploited\" the tragedy for political purposes.[127] On October 12, 2020, Fox News agreed to pay millions of dollars to the Rich family.[128] Hannity came under criticism during the 2016 presidential election for false claims about election rigging during interviews. Hannity responded to this by citing Mitt Romney's failure in the 2012 United States presidential election to obtain any votes in 59 of 1,687 Philadelphia voting districts as proof of election rigging. However, FactCheck.org and PolitiFact found that it was not unusual at all for this to occur, as those electoral districts are heavily African-American. Philadelphia elections inspector Ryan Godfrey also refuted Hannity's claim.[129][130] After the 2020 election, Hannity amplified false claims of election fraud,[11] including by hosting former Trump lawyer Sidney Powell on his Fox News show, where Powell made unsubstantiated allegations on the topic.[131] The House Select Committee on the January 6 Attack investigated what Hannity may have known in advance. The committee discovered that, on December 31, 2020, Hannity texted White House chief of staff Mark Meadows, saying, \"I do NOT see January 6 happening the way he [Trump] is being told.\"[15][132] In December 2020, Hannity called for Trump's claims of voter fraud to be investigated by a special prosecutor, despite no credible evidence of such.[133] The Washington Post reported in May 2022 that Hannity participated in a conference call days after the 2020 presidential election that focused on strategies for challenging the legitimacy of the vote. Other participants on the call included senator Lindsey Graham, Trump personal attorney Jay Sekulow, Oracle Corporation founder Larry Ellison and James Bopp, an attorney for True the Vote.[134] Fox News was sued for defamation in 2021 by Dominion Voting Systems, after Hannity and other network hosts and their guests promoted claims the company's voting machines had been rigged against Donald Trump in the 2020 presidential election. Shortly after the election, Hannity hosted Trump attorney Sidney Powell, who made such assertions, but Hannity said in a sworn deposition for the Dominion case, \"I did not believe it for one second.\"[135] Hannity has advocated the QAnon[136] and \"deep state\" conspiracy theories. The latter proposes a government officials network is working to hinder the Trump administration. He has described the deep state as a \"Shadow Government\" and \"Deep state swamp of Obama holdovers and DC lifers\".[137][138] In March 2017, he called for a \"purge\" of Obama-era bureaucrats and appointees in government.[139] In an op-ed for The Wall Street Journal, conservative columnist Bret Stephens disputed Hannity's deep state allegations, saying they were an example of the \"paranoid style in politics\".[140] Later that month, Hannity said NBC News was part of the deep state.[141] In May 2017, he reiterated that deep state/intelligence operatives were trying to destroy the Trump presidency.[142] Analysis of Fox News coverage published by Media Matters in 2014 found that Hannity was a major proponent of alleged scandals involving the Obama administration and then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton related to the 2012 Benghazi attack.[143] Six investigations by Republican-controlled House committees found no evidence of scandal.[144][145][146][147] In 2010, Hannity said WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange was waging a \"war\" on the United States, and that WikiLeaks put American lives in \"jeopardy\" and \"danger\" around the world. He also criticized the Obama administration for failing to apprehend Assange.[148][149] In 2016, after WikiLeaks published leaked emails from the Democratic National Committee, Hannity praised Assange for showing \"how corrupt, dishonest and phony our government is\".[149][150] He told Assange in a September 2016 interview, \"I do hope you get free one day. I wish you the best.\"[151] The following month, Hannity claimed that WikiLeaks has revealed \"everything that conspiracy theorists have said over the years\" about Hillary Clinton is true.[152] In February 2017, Hannity retweeted a WikiLeaks tweet linking to an article by the conspiracy website Gateway Pundit, claiming that John McCain was a \"globalist war criminal\". McCain's spokeswoman called Hannity out on it, asking him to \"correct the record\". Hannity later deleted the tweet.[153] In May 2017, Hannity made an offer to Assange to guest host his Fox News TV show.[154] During President Trump's administration, Hannity has repeatedly been highly critical of the FBI, DOJ, Special Counsel Robert Mueller, and others investigating Russian interference in the 2016 election.[155] According to a review by Media Matters of all transcripts from the 254 episodes of Hannity's show from Mueller's appointment (May 17, 2017) to May 16, 2018, Hannity had 487 segments substantially devoted to Mueller (approximately two per episode), opened his program with Mueller 152 times (approximately three times per week), and the content of his show was highly critical of the probe and the media's coverage of the probe.[156] He has called the Russia inquiry a \"witch hunt\", an \"utter disgrace\", and \"a direct threat to you, the American people, and our American republic\".[155] Hannity has expressed skepticism of the U.S. intelligence community's view that Russia hacked the Democratic National Convention's emails during the 2016 election and has promoted various conspiracy theories. In March 2017 he publicized a theory, first proposed at the WikiLeaks Twitter account, that the CIA could have done the hacking while making it look like Russia did it.[157] In August he suggested that Seth Rich may have been the leaker.[158] Hannity falsely claimed fewer people voted for Trump in the 2016 election because they heard about the \"pee tape\" rumor, which he called \"election interference\", even though it was not public knowledge until 63 days after the election.[159] Hannity has described the Mueller investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election, as well as James Comey's tenure as FBI Director, as \"one giant incestuous circle of corruption\".[160] In April 2018, Hannity ran a segment where he claimed there were \"criminal\" connections between Bill and Hillary Clinton, Mueller, and Comey.[160] Hannity asserted that there were three connected \"Deep State crime families\" actively \"trying to take down the president\".[161][160] A guest on the segment, attorney Joseph diGenova, called Mueller's team \"legal terrorists\" and referred to Comey as a \"dirty cop\".[162] In March 2018, Hannity attacked Special Counsel Robert Mueller, saying his career was \"anything but impeccable\".[163] Hannity said Mueller was friends with former FBI Director James Comey and former Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, and that he \"cannot be expected to honestly investigate scandals that his friends are directly involved in\".[164] He said these individuals were involved in \"one massive, huge, deep-state conflict of interest after another. Now they're protecting themselves. They're trying to preserve their own power.\"[160] Mueller and Comey are professional acquaintances but not known to be friends, while Trump attorney general Bill Barr said in 2019 that he and Mueller had been friends for thirty years.[165] On November 4, 2018, Trump's website, DonaldJTrump.com, announced in a press release that Hannity would make a \"special guest appearance\" with Trump at a midterm campaign rally the following night in Cape Girardeau, Missouri.[166] The following morning, Hannity tweeted \"To be clear, I will not be on stage campaigning with the President.\"[167] Hannity nevertheless spoke at Trump's lectern on stage at the rally, immediately mocking the \"fake news\" at the back of the auditorium, Fox News reporters among them. Several Fox News employees expressed outrage at Hannity's actions, with one stating, \"a new line was crossed\".[168] Hannity later asserted that his action was not pre-planned, and Fox News stated it \"does not condone any talent participating in campaign events\".[169] Fox News host Jeanine Pirro also appeared on stage with Trump at the rally. The Trump press release was later removed from Trump's website.[166] Hannity also claimed that Mueller had been involved in the corrupt dealings of several FBI agents in connection with Boston, Massachusetts crime boss Whitey Bulger.[170] The federal judge who presided over a lawsuit concerning the corrupt dealings said Hannity's claims were unsubstantiated and that Mueller was never accused of any wrongdoing nor even mentioned during the proceedings.[170] In June 2018, after reports that Mueller's probe had asked witnesses to turn their personal phones over to investigators for examination, Hannity sarcastically suggested on air to the witnesses that they \"follow Hillary Clinton's lead\" and destroy their personal phones so they cannot be examined.[171][172] In May 2019, after Mueller gave a statement saying the Special Counsel investigation did not exonerate Trump of crimes, Hannity said Mueller was \"basically full of crap\" and did not know the law.[173] In 2016, Hannity vociferously defended Roger Ailes when he was accused by multiple women of sexual harassment.[21][174] In May 2017, Hannity paid a tribute to Ailes after he died.[175] Hannity called him \"a second father\" and said to Ailes' \"enemies\" that he was \"preparing to kick your a** in the next life\".[175] In April 2017, Hannity came to the defense of Fox News co-president Bill Shine after it was reported that Shine's job was at risk.[176][177] At least four lawsuits alleged that Shine had ignored, enabled or concealed Ailes' alleged sexual harassment.[176][177][178] In another lawsuit, he was accused of belittling a female guest on his TV show, allegedly offering cash to anyone on set who would take her on a date.[179] In September 2017, several months after Bill O'Reilly was fired from Fox News in the wake of a number of women's alleging that he had sexually harassed them, Hannity hosted O'Reilly on his show.[180][181][182] Some Fox News employees criticized the decision.[181] In the interview, O'Reilly attacked liberal media watchdog groups and said he should have fought harder when those groups targeted his advertisers.[181] According to CNN, during the interview, Hannity found kinship with O'Reilly as he appeared \"to feel that he and O'Reilly have both become victims of liberals looking to silence them\".[181] Hannity came under criticism in October 2017 when he attacked Democrats after it became known that a large number of women had accused Harvey Weinstein, the Hollywood producer and donor to Democratic causes, of sexual harassment.[183] Critics noted that Hannity had weeks earlier defended and hosted his coworker Bill O'Reilly who was fired following a number of sexual harassment allegations.[183][184] In the radio show for KCSB, which was the subject of controversy in 1989, Hannity made anti-gay comments.[185][186] He called AIDS a \"gay disease\" and said the media was hiding salient information from the public.[22][186] Two editions featured anti-gay activist Gene Antonio, a Lutheran minister,[187] discussing his book The AIDS Coverup: The Real and Alarming Facts about AIDS. In the book, Antonio claims that AIDS can be spread by people sneezing in close proximity to each other. Hannity encouraged Antonio when he said that AIDS spread when gay men consumed each other's feces,[22] said that homosexuality was a \"lower form of behavior\", compared homosexual sex to \"playing in a sewer\" and gay people of being \"filled with hatred and bigotry\".[185] When a lesbian, another broadcaster at the station, called into the show, Hannity said \"I feel sorry for your child.\"[21][185][188] Hannity was quoted at the time as having said \"anyone listening to this show that believes homosexuality is a normal lifestyle has been brainwashed.\"[21][22][189] The ACLU opposed his firing and petitioned the station to reverse their decision.[190] Hannity demanded a formal apology and double the airtime. While the station did offer to allow Hannity to return, they would not meet Hannity's additional demands and he declined to return.[190] In 2017, Hannity said he regretted the comments and that they were \"ignorant and embarrassing\".[191][185] Hannity opposed amnesty for undocumented immigrants; however, in 2012 he said he had evolved on the issue and favored a \"pathway to citizenship\".[192][22] Later, he opposed that idea.[22] By 2018, he was described as an immigration hardliner by CNN, The Washington Post, and New York magazine.[193][194][195] In August 2018, Trump suggested that he might shut down the government to force Congress to fund his border wall, boasting that Hannity agreed with the action.[196] Hannity left the Catholic Church in 2019, citing \"too much institutionalized corruption\". However, he has said that as he has aged, his Christian faith has \"gotten stronger\" and that he needs and wants God in his life.[197] Hannity has warned of Sharia law coming to the United States.[198] Hannity opposed the building of Park51, a mosque two blocks from the World Trade Center site.[198] Hannity promoted the idea of \"Islamic training camps right here in America\", which were based on an unsubstantiated \"documentary\" by the Christian Action Network.[199] In 2006, Hannity was critical of Keith Ellison, the first Muslim elected to U.S. Congress, being sworn into office with an oath on a Quran. Hannity equated the Quran with Mein Kampf, asking a guest on his show whether he would have allowed Ellison \"to choose, you know, Hitler's Mein Kampf, which is the Nazi bible?\"[200][201] In 2009, Hannity said he supported enhanced interrogation, a euphemism for torture. He also volunteered to be waterboarded for charity.[202][203] In response, Keith Olbermann pledged to donate $1,000 for every second of waterboarding Hannity underwent. In 2017, Hannity continued to advocate for waterboarding, raising the example of using it against a kidnapper.[204] According to Media Matters, Hannity has not been waterboarded as of March 2018.[205] Hannity rejects the scientific consensus on climate change. In 2001, he described it as \"phony science from the left\".[206] In 2004, he falsely claimed that scientists couldn't agree on whether global warming was \"scientific fact or fiction\".[206] In 2010, Hannity falsely stated that so-called \"Climategate\" – the leaking of e-mails written by climate scientists that, according to climate change deniers, demonstrated scientific misconduct, but which all subsequent inquiries found to show no evidence of misconduct or wrongdoing – was a scandal that \"exposed global warming as a myth cooked up by alarmists\".[207] Hannity frequently invites critics of climate science onto his shows.[208] Hannity promoted the falsehood that the Affordable Care Act would create so-called \"death panels\".[209][210][211] According to a study by Dartmouth College political scientist Brendan Nyhan, Hannity's show, along with the Laura Ingraham Show, were the first major conservative media personalities to latch onto the false claim of Betsy McCaughey, a former lieutenant governor of New York, that the Affordable Care Act contained death panels.[210] When Sarah Palin stirred controversy by promoting the death panels myth, and argued her case in a Facebook post, Hannity defended her and said, \"I agree with everything that she wrote.\"[212] Hannity also claimed that he found the specific pages in the Affordable Care Act containing provisions on death panels.[212] A 2016 study found that Hannity promoted a number of falsehoods about the Affordable Care Act.[212] For instance, Hannity falsely alleged several times that Democratic Senate Finance Committee Chairman Max Baucus had said Social Security could be \"insolvent in two years\" due to the Affordable Care Act.[212] According to the study, Hannity, unlike other Fox News hosts such as Bill O'Reilly and Greta Van Susteren, \"took a more direct approach, aggressively supporting Republicans and conservatives and attacking Democrats and liberals, endorsing the more spurious claims long after they were proven incorrect, and putting advocacy above accurate reporting, to further the network's themes opposing reform\".[212] In 2009, Hannity said of the Iraq War, \"we were victorious in spite of the Democrats' efforts and attempts at preventing victory.\"[213] During the 2016 election, Hannity vouched for Trump's claimed opposition to the Iraq War, \"Mr. Trump and I disagreed about the Iraq war; I was for it and he was against it.\"[214] In June 2019, Hannity called on Trump to \"bomb the hell of out Iran\" after Iran shot down a U.S. drone.[215] After the assassination of Qasem Soleimani, Hannity opened his show by saying, \"tonight the world is safer as one of the most ruthless, evil war criminals on Earth has been brought to justice.\"[216] From 2015 into 2018, Fox News broadcast extensive coverage of an alleged scandal surrounding the sale of Uranium One to Russian interests, which Hannity characterized as \"one of the biggest scandals in American history\".[217] The Fox News coverage extended throughout the programming day, with particular emphasis by Hannity.[218] The network promoted a narrative asserting that, as Secretary of State, Hillary Clinton personally approved the Uranium One sale in exchange for $145 million in bribes paid to the Clinton Foundation. Donald Trump repeated these allegations as a candidate and as president.[219] No evidence of wrongdoing by Clinton had been found after three years of allegations, an FBI investigation, and the 2017 appointment of a Federal attorney to evaluate the investigation. In November 2017, Fox News host Shepard Smith concisely debunked the alleged scandal, including saying that Clinton did not personally approve the sale, infuriating viewers who suggested he should work for CNN or MSNBC.[220][221] Hannity later called Smith \"clueless\", while Smith stated, \"I get it, that some of our opinion programming is there strictly to be entertaining. I get that. I don't work there. I wouldn't work there.\"[222][223] A two-year Justice Department investigation initiated after Trump became president found no evidence to justify pursuing a criminal investigation.[224] In February 2020, amid the spread of COVID-19 to the United States, Hannity said \"many on the left are now all rooting for corona to wreak havoc in the United States. Why? To score cheap, repulsive political points.\"[225] In March 2020, he characterized the virus as a \"hoax\",[226] and said it \"may be true\" that the outbreak was a \"fraud\" perpetrated by the \"deep state\".[227][228] Later in March, as the disease spread into a global pandemic and Trump declared it a national emergency, Hannity started to take the virus more seriously, denying that he had referred to it as a hoax less than a month earlier.[229][230] In July 2021, on live television, Hannity encouraged the audience to consider vaccination.[231] Hannity was a major promoter of allegations that President Joe Biden had acted corruptly through involvement in the business affairs of his son Hunter Biden, characterizing the men as leaders of the \"Biden crime family.\" CNN characterized Hannity as \"the primary vehicle for driving the narrative to the GOP base.\" Hannity alleged the president had been \"very credibly accused of public corruption on a scale this country has never seen before,\" including taking a bribe from a Ukrainian businessman, as alleged by a \"highly credible\" FBI informant. Analysis by Media Matters found that Hannity had discussed the bribery allegation on his program 85 times in 2023, and had hosted James Comer, chair of the Republican-controlled House Oversight Committee investigation into the Biden family 43 times to discuss the investigation that year. Hannity ran at least 115 segments in 2023 falsely alleging that as vice president Joe Biden had corruptly pressured Ukraine to fire its prosecutor general Viktor Shokin to protect Hunter Biden and his employer, Burisma, from an investigation. Comer began investigating the Bidens in January 2023 but did not find evidence of wrongdoing by the president; nevertheless, Republicans who controlled the House voted unanimously to initiate an impeachment inquiry in December 2023. The FBI informant who made the bribery allegation was indicted in February 2024 on charges he had fabricated the story; the indictment alleged the informant, Alexander Smirnov, was associated with Russian intelligence. Hannity did not mention the development on his program that night, and Media Matters reported that by April 2024 he had not mentioned the Biden inquiry or hosted Comer for a month. Lacking evidence and Republican appetite to proceed to impeachment hearings with their thin House majority, by March 2024 the impeachment inquiry was winding down.[232][233][234][235][236][237] Hannity met Jill Rhodes in 1991 when he worked at WVNN in Huntsville, Alabama and she was a political columnist for the Huntsville Times.[238] The two married in 1993.[24] In June 2020, the couple announced that they had divorced the previous year but had separated years prior.[239] Hannity has since dated Fox News colleague Ainsley Earhardt.[240] In August 2019, Hannity and Earhardt arrived together as guests for a wedding at Trump National Golf Course in Colts Neck, New Jersey. During the COVID-19 pandemic, she hosted her Fox & Friends program from a remote studio in the basement of Hannity's Long Island mansion.[241] Hannity has two children from his marriage to Rhodes: a son, Patrick, born in 1998, and daughter, Merri, born in 2001.[238] Both children graduated from Cold Spring Harbor High School. Patrick attended Wake Forest University where he played tennis.[242][243][24] Merri attends The University of Michigan where she also plays tennis. In high school, Merri was the fourth highest ranked tennis player in New York State.[244] In 2018, Forbes estimated that Hannity's annual income was $36 million.[191] In April 2021, he purchased a $5.3 million house several miles from Donald Trump's Mar-a-Lago residence.[245] In 2014 he said he has carried a weapon \"more than half my adult life\".[246] According to Hannity, he has a brown belt in martial arts and trains four days a week in the sport.[247] In 2024, Hannity announced that he had moved from his home in Long Island, New York to Florida and would be broadcasting The Sean Hannity Show and Hannity from his new home permanently.[248] It was announced that Hannity proposed to Fox & Friends co-host Ainsley Earhardt on Christmas Day 2024 at a church in Florida. The two have been dating privately for several years. [249]",

                "content": "Manage your account Fox News’s Ainsley Earhardt and Sean Hannity are engaged. According to an announcement from Fox, Hannity popped the question at their church in Florida. The couple have maintained their long-distance relationship for years, with Hannity living in Florida and Earhardt living in New York. \"We are overjoyed and so thankful to our families for all of their love and support during this wonderful time in our lives,\" Hannity, 62, and Earhardt, 48, said in Fox’s announcement. See for yourself — The Yodel is the go-to source for daily news, entertainment and feel-good stories. By signing up, you agree to our Terms and Privacy Policy. According to Fox, the two will continue their current roles at the network, with Hannity keeping his position at his long-running Fox News show, Hannity, and Earhardt hosting Fox & Friends alongside co-hosts Steve Doocy and Brian Kilmeade. President-elect Donald Trump, a big fan of Fox & Friends who has been interviewed by both Hannity and Earhardt, celebrated the announcement on social media. “Great news about Sean and Ainsley,” Trump wrote on Truth Social. “They are officially engaged to be married! There are no finer people than these, and there will be no finer couple. Congratulations to both — A deal made in HEAVEN!!!” This will be the third marriage for Earhardt, who has worked at Fox News since 2007. During her first years at the network, she hosted a segment on Hannity before becoming a Fox & Friends co-host in 2016. She was married to former Clemson Tigers quarterback Will Proctor in 2012 and divorced in 2019. The two have a 9-year-old daughter. Her first marriage was to film producer Kevin McKinney in 2005; they divorced in 2009. Hannity was married to former journalist Jill Rhodes from 1993 to 2019, and the two have a 26-year-old son and a 23-year-old daughter. Vanity Fair first reported in August 2020 that Earhardt and Hannity were dating after they arrived together at Fox & Friends weekend host Pete Hegseth and Fox producer Jennifer Rauchet’s wedding at the Trump National Golf Club in Bedminster, N.J. “It was as if Hannity and Earhardt were the first couple of Fox News — which they are,” Vanity Fair wrote, referring to them as a figurative first lady and president of the media network.",

                "content": "Hannity is an American conservative television political talk program on Fox News hosted by Sean Hannity. Episodes air live at 9:00 p.m. from Monday through Thursday, while episodes that air on Fridays are pre-recorded, with a repeat airing at 2:00 a.m. the following morning. The show focuses on the development of the day's events with long monologues, political analysis, and legal analysis. The show has been a part of the Fox News program lineup since January 12, 2009 succeeding Hannity & Colmes, and is the number one cable news broadcast in its time slot. On nights when Hannity is not available, Jason Chaffetz, Tammy Bruce, Jeanine Pirro, Kayleigh McEnany, Kellyanne Conway fill in as substitute hosts.[clarification needed] At the beginning of the show, Hannity opens with an opening monologue detailing the political issues of the day. He then transitions to clips backing evidence or showing statements of opposition forces. When Hannity finishes his opening monologue, he goes to a political & legal panel analyzing the situations on hand. After the opening segments, the show has a looser format. Hannity may go to another monologue, go to an interview, or continue with another panel. The first guest on Hannity was former Speaker of the House Newt Gingrich. Hannity featured an exclusive interview with Don Imus during his premiere week. During the second week, conservative talk show host Rush Limbaugh appeared in an exclusive two-part interview about the future of the conservative movement and the newly inaugurated President Barack Obama. Following the announcement on November 25, 2008, that Alan Colmes would leave Fox News primetime show Hannity & Colmes,[1] it was decided that show would be succeeded by Hannity with Sean Hannity hosting solo.[2] From October 7, 2013, to September 22, 2017, most Hannity episodes were pre-recorded to air in the 10:00 p.m. time-slot, occasionally airing live if a major breaking news story was being covered. Following the move to 10:00 p.m., the 9:00 p.m. time-slot was filled by several programs, including The Kelly File, Tucker Carlson Tonight, and most recently The Five, which aired at 9:00 p.m. until September 25, 2017, when Hannity returned to its original time and got a graphics makeover. Hannity is broadcast from Studio J at 1211 Avenue of the Americas (also known as the News Corp. Building), New York City. On March 20, 2018, Hannity temporarily relocated to Studio F from its original location in Studio J for construction. The program went back to renovated Studio J on June 5, 2018.[3] On January 2, 2024, Hannity announced that he had moved to Florida and would be broadcasting both his radio show and Hannity from his new home permanently.

                "title": "Liverpool - Wikipedia",
                "content": "Liverpool is a cathedral and port city and metropolitan borough in Merseyside, England, which had a population of 496,770 in 2022.[3] It is on the eastern side of the Mersey Estuary, near the Irish Sea, 178 miles (286 km) northwest of London. Liverpool is the fifth largest city in the United Kingdom and the administrative headquarters of the Liverpool City Region, a combined authority area with a population of over 1.5 million.[5] Liverpool's wider metropolitan area is estimated to have a population of more than 2.2 million people.[6] Established as a borough in Lancashire in 1207, Liverpool became significant in the late 17th century when the Port of Liverpool was heavily involved in the Atlantic slave trade. The port also imported cotton for the Lancashire textile mills, and became a major departure point for English and Irish emigrants to North America. Liverpool rose to global economic importance at the forefront of the Industrial Revolution in the 19th century and was home to the first intercity railway, the first non-combustible warehouse system (the Royal Albert Dock), and a pioneering elevated electrical railway; it was granted city status in 1880 and was moved from Lancashire to the newly created county of Merseyside in 1974. It entered a period of decline in the mid-20th century, but has experienced regeneration since the European Union selected it as the European Capital of Culture in 2008,[a] which was reported to have generated over £800 million for the local economy within a year.[7][8] The economy of Liverpool is diversified and encompasses tourism, culture, maritime, hospitality, healthcare, life sciences, advanced manufacturing, creative, and digital sectors.[9][10][11] The city is home to the UK's second highest number of art galleries, national museums, listed buildings, and parks and open spaces, with only London having more.[12] It is often used as a filming location due to its architecture, and was the fifth most visited UK city by foreign tourists in 2022.[13] It has produced numerous musicians, most notably the Beatles, and artists from the city have had more UK No. 1 hit singles than anywhere else.[14] It has also produced academics, actors, artists, comedians, filmmakers, poets, scientists, sportspeople, and writers. It is the home of Premier League football teams Everton and Liverpool. The world's oldest still-operating mainline train station, Liverpool Lime Street, is in the city centre; it is also served by the underground Merseyrail network. The city's port was the fourth largest in the UK in 2023, with numerous shipping and freight lines having headquarters and offices there.[15] Residents of Liverpool are often called \"Scousers\" in reference to scouse, a local stew made popular by sailors in the city, while \"Scouse\" is also the most common name given to the local accent. The city's cultural and ethnic diversity is a result of attracting immigrants, especially from Ireland, Scandinavia, and Wales; it is also the home of a large black and Chinese community, and the first mosque in England.[16] The name comes from the Old English lifer, meaning thick or muddy water, and pōl, meaning a pool or creek, and is first recorded around 1190 as Liuerpul.[17][18] According to the Cambridge Dictionary of English Place-Names, \"The original reference was to a pool or tidal creek now filled up into which two streams drained\".[19] The place appearing as Leyrpole, in a legal record of 1418, may also refer to Liverpool.[20] Other origins of the name have been suggested, including \"elverpool\", a reference to the large number of eels in the Mersey.[21] The adjective \"Liverpudlian\" was first recorded in 1833.[18] Although the Old English origin of the name Liverpool is beyond dispute, claims are sometimes made that the name Liverpool is of Welsh origin, but these are without foundation. The Welsh name for Liverpool is Lerpwl, from a former English local form Leerpool. This is a reduction of the form \"Leverpool\" with the loss of the intervocalic [v] (seen in other English names and words e.g. Daventry (Northamptonshire) > Danetry, never-do-well > ne’er-do-well). In the 19th century, some Welsh publications used the name \"Lle'r Pwll\" (\"(the) place (of) the pool\"), a reinterpretation of Lerpwl, probably in the belief that \"Lle'r Pwll\" was the original form. Another name, which is widely known even today, is Llynlleifiad, again a 19th-century coining. \"Llyn\" is pool, but \"lleifiad\" has no obvious meaning. G. Melville Richards (1910–1973), a pioneer of scientific toponymy in Wales, in \"Place Names of North Wales\",[22] does not attempt to explain it beyond noting that \"lleifiad\" is used as a Welsh equivalent of \"Liver\". A derivative form of a learned borrowing into Welsh (*llaf) of Latin lāma (slough, bog, fen) to give \"lleifiad\" is possible, but unproven. In the Middle Ages, Liverpool existed firstly as farmland within the West Derby Hundred[23] before growing in to a small town of farmers, fishermen and tradesmen and tactical army base for King John of England. The town was planned with its own castle, although due to outbreaks of disease and its subordinance to the nearby Roman port of Chester, the town's growth and prosperity stagnated until the late 17th and early 18th centuries. Substantial growth took place in the mid-late 18th century when the town became the most heavily involved European port in the Atlantic slave trade.[24] King John's letters patent of 1207 announced the foundation of the borough of Liverpool (then spelt as Liuerpul). There is no evidence that the place had previously been a centre of any trade. The creation of the borough was probably due to King John deciding it would be a convenient place to embark men and supplies for his Irish campaigns, in particular John's Irish campaign of 1209.[25][26] The original street plan of Liverpool is said to have been designed by King John near the same time it was granted a royal charter, making it a borough. The original seven streets were laid out in the shape of a double cross: Bank Street (now Water Street), Castle Street, Chapel Street, Dale Street, Juggler Street (now High Street), Moor Street (now Tithebarn Street) and Whiteacre Street (now Old Hall Street).[26] Liverpool Castle was built before 1235, it survived until it was demolished in the 1720s.[27] By the middle of the 16th century, the population was still around 600, although this was likely to have fallen from an earlier peak of 1000 people due to slow trade and the effects of the plague.[28][29][30] In the 17th century, there was slow progress in trade and population growth. Battles for control of the town were waged during the English Civil War, including a brief siege in 1644.[31] In 1699, the same year as its first recorded slave ship, Liverpool Merchant, set sail for Africa,[32] Liverpool was made a parish by Act of Parliament. But arguably, the legislation of 1695 that reformed the Liverpool council was of more significance to its subsequent development.[33] Since Roman times nearby Chester on the River Dee had been the region's principal port on the Irish Sea. However, as the Dee began to silt up, maritime trade from Chester became increasingly difficult and shifted towards Liverpool on the neighbouring River Mersey. The first of the Liverpool docks was constructed in 1715, and the system of docks gradually grew into a large interconnected system.[34] As trade from the West Indies, including sugar, surpassed that of Ireland and Europe, and as the River Dee continued to silt up, Liverpool began to grow with increasing rapidity. The first commercial wet dock was built in Liverpool in 1715.[35][36] Substantial profits from the slave trade and tobacco helped the town to prosper and rapidly grow, although several prominent local men, including William Rathbone, William Roscoe and Edward Rushton, were at the forefront of the local abolitionist movement.[37] The 19th century saw Liverpool rise to global economic importance. Pioneering, world first, technology and civic facilities launched in the city to serve the accelerating population which was fuelled by an influx of ethnic and religious communities from all around the world. By the start of the 19th century, a large volume of trade was passing through Liverpool, and the construction of major buildings reflected this wealth. In 1830, Liverpool and Manchester became the first cities to have an intercity rail link, through the Liverpool and Manchester Railway. The population continued to rise rapidly, especially during the 1840s when Irish migrants began arriving by the hundreds of thousands as a result of the Great Famine. While many Irish settled during this time in the city, a large percentage also emigrated to the United States or moved to the industrial centres of Lancashire, Yorkshire and the Midlands.[38] In her poetical illustration \"Liverpool\" (1832), which celebrates the city's worldwide commerce, Letitia Elizabeth Landon refers specifically to the Macgregor Laird expedition to the Niger River, at that time in progress.[39] This is to a painting by Samuel Austin, Liverpool, from the Mersey.[40] Britain was a major market for cotton imported from the Deep South of the United States, which fed the textile industry in the country. Given the crucial place cotton held in the city's economy, during the American Civil War Liverpool was, in the words of historian Sven Beckert, \"the most pro-Confederate place in the world outside the Confederacy itself.\"[41] Liverpool merchants helped to bring out cotton from ports blockaded by the Union Navy, built ships of war for the Confederacy, and supplied the South with military equipment and credit.[42] During the war, the Confederate Navy ship, the CSS Alabama, was built at Birkenhead on the Mersey, and the CSS Shenandoah surrendered there (being the final surrender at the end of the war). The city was also the center of Confederate purchasing war materiel, including arms and ammunition, uniforms, and naval supplies to be smuggled by British blockade runners to the South.[43] For periods during the 19th century, the wealth of Liverpool exceeded that of London,[44] and Liverpool's Custom House was the single largest contributor to the British Exchequer.[45] Liverpool was the only British city ever to have its own Whitehall office.[46] During this century, at least 40% of the world's entire trade passed through Liverpool.[47] In the early 19th century, Liverpool played a major role in the Antarctic sealing industry, in recognition of which Liverpool Beach in the South Shetland Islands is named after the city.[48] As early as 1851, the city was described as \"the New York of Europe\".[49] During the late 19th and early 20th century, Liverpool was attracting immigrants from across Europe. This resulted in the construction of a diverse array of religious buildings in the city for the new ethnic and religious groups, many of which are still in use today. The Deutsche Kirche Liverpool, Greek Orthodox Church of St Nicholas, Gustav Adolf Church and Princes Road Synagogue were all established in the 1800s to serve Liverpool's growing German, Greek, Nordic and Jewish communities, respectively. One of Liverpool's oldest surviving churches, St. Peter's Roman Catholic Church, served the Polish community in its final years as a place of worship. The 20th century saw Liverpool's established rank as a global economic powerhouse challenged. Its strategic location as an international seaport made it particularly vulnerable in two World wars. Economic depressions (both in the United Kingdom and across the world), changing housing patterns and containerisation in the maritime industry contributed to a downtrend in the city's productivity and prosperity. Despite this, the city's influence on global popular culture excelled and by the end of the century, the continuing process of urban renewal paved the way for the redefined modern city of the 21st century. The period after the Great War was marked by social unrest, as society grappled with the massive war losses of young men, as well as trying to re-integrate veterans into civilian life and the economy. Unemployment and poor living standards greeted many ex-servicemen. Union organising and strikes took place in numerous locations, including a police strike in Liverpool among the City Police. Numerous colonial soldiers and sailors from Africa and India, who had served with the British Armed Forces, settled in Liverpool and other port cities. In June 1919, they were subject to attack by whites in racial riots; residents in the port included Swedish immigrants, and both groups had to compete with native people from Liverpool for jobs and housing. In this period, race riots also took place in other port cities.[50] The Housing Act 1919 resulted in mass council housing being built across Liverpool during the 1920s and 1930s. In the 1920s and 1930s, as much as 15% of the city's population (around 140,000 people) was relocated from the inner-city to new purpose built, lower density suburban housing estates, based on the belief that this would improve their standard of living, though the overall benefits have been contested.[51][52] Numerous private homes were also built during this era. During the Great Depression of the early 1930s, unemployment peaked at around 30% in the city. Liverpool was the site of Britain's first provincial airport, operating from 1930. During the Second World War, the critical strategic importance of Liverpool was recognised by both Hitler and Churchill. The city was heavily bombed by the Germans, suffering a blitz second only to London's.[53] The pivotal Battle of the Atlantic was planned, fought and won from Liverpool.[54] The Luftwaffe made 80 air raids on Merseyside, killing 2,500 people and causing damage to almost half the homes in the metropolitan area. Significant rebuilding followed the war, including massive housing estates and the Seaforth Dock, the largest dock project in Britain. Since 1952, Liverpool has been twinned with Cologne, Germany, a city which also suffered severe aerial bombing during the war. In the 1950s and 1960s, much of the immediate reconstruction that took place in the city centre proved to be deeply unpopular. The historic portions of the city that had survived German bombing suffered extensive destruction during urban renewal. It has been argued that the so-called \"Shankland Plan\" of the 1960s, named after the town planner Graeme Shankland, led to compromised town planning and vast road-building schemes that devastated and divided inner city neighbourhoods. Concrete brutalist architecture, compromised visions, botched projects and grand designs that were never realised became the subject of condemnation. Historian Raphael Samuel labelled Graeme Shankland \"the butcher of Liverpool\".[55][56][57][58] A significant West Indian black community has existed in the city since the first two decades of the 20th century. Like most British cities and industrialised towns, Liverpool became home to a significant number of Commonwealth immigrants, beginning after World War I with colonial soldiers and sailors who had served in the area. More immigrants arrived after World War II, mostly settling in older inner-city areas such as Toxteth, where housing was less expensive. The black population of Liverpool was recorded at 1.90% in 2011. In the 2021 Census, 5.2% described themselves as black African, Caribbean, mixed white and black African, mixed white and Caribbean or 'other black'.[59][60] In the 1960s, Liverpool was the centre of the \"Merseybeat\" sound, which became synonymous with the Beatles and fellow Liverpudlian rock bands. Influenced by American rhythm and blues and rock music, they also in turn strongly affected American music. The Beatles became internationally known in the early 1960s and performed around the world together; they were, and continue to be, the most commercially successful and musically influential band in popular history. Their co-founder, singer, and composer John Lennon was killed in New York City in 1980. Liverpool Airport was renamed after him in 2002, the first British airport to be named in honour of an individual.[61][62] Previously part of Lancashire, and a county borough from 1889, Liverpool became a metropolitan borough within the newly created metropolitan county of Merseyside, in 1974. From the mid-1970s onwards, Liverpool's docks and traditional manufacturing industries declined due to restructuring of shipping and heavy industry, causing massive losses of jobs. The advent of containerisation meant that the city's docks became largely obsolete, and dock workers were made unemployed. By the early 1980s, unemployment rates in Liverpool were among the highest in the UK,[63] standing at 17% by January 1982 although, this was about half the level of unemployment that had affected the city during the Great Depression some 50 years previously.[64] During this period, Liverpool became a hub of fierce left-wing opposition to the central government in London.[65] Liverpool in the 1980s has been labelled as Britain's 'shock city'. Once the acclaimed second city of the British Empire which rivalled the capital city in global significance, Liverpool had collapsed in to its 'nadir' at the depths of post-colonial, post-industrial Britain.[66][67] In the late 20th century, Liverpool's economy began to recover. The late 1980s saw the opening of a regenerated Albert Dock which proved to be a catalyst for further regeneration.[68] In the mid-1990s, the city enjoyed growth rates higher than the national average. At the end of the 20th century, Liverpool was concentrating on regeneration, a process that continues today. Ongoing regeneration combined with the hosting of internationally significant events has helped to re-purpose Liverpool as one of the most visited, tourist orientated, cities in the United Kingdom. City leaders are focussing on long-term strategies to grow the city's population and economy, while national government explores the continuous potential for devolution in the city. In 2002, Queen Elizabeth II and Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh visited Liverpool to mark the Golden Jubilee. On speaking to an audience at Liverpool Town Hall, the Queen recognised Liverpool as \"one of the most distinctive and energetic parts of the United Kingdom\", and paid tribute to the city's \"major orchestras, world-class museums and galleries\". She also acknowledged Liverpool's bid to become the European Capital of Culture.[69][70] To celebrate the Golden Jubilee of Elizabeth II in 2002, the conservation charity Plantlife organised a competition to choose county flowers; the sea-holly was Liverpool's final choice. The initiative was designed to highlight growing threats to the UK's flower species and also ask the public about which flowers best represented their county.[71] Capitalising on the popularity of 1960s rock groups, such as the Beatles, as well as the city's world-class art galleries, museums and landmarks, tourism and culture have become a significant factor in Liverpool's economy. In 2004, property developer Grosvenor started the Paradise Project, a £920 million development based on Paradise Street. This produced one of the most significant changes to Liverpool's city centre since the post-war reconstruction. Renamed as 'Liverpool One,' the centre opened in May 2008. In 2007, events and celebrations took place in honour of the 800th anniversary of the founding of the borough of Liverpool. Liverpool was designated as a joint European Capital of Culture for 2008. The celebrations included the erection of La Princesse, a large mechanical spider 20 metres high and weighing 37 tonnes, which represented the \"eight legs\" of Liverpool: honour, history, music, the Mersey, the ports, governance, sunshine and culture. La Princesse roamed the streets of the city during the festivities, and concluded by entering the Queensway Tunnel. Spearheaded by the multi-billion-pound Liverpool ONE development, regeneration continued throughout the 2010s. Some of the most significant redevelopment projects included new buildings in the Commercial District, King's Dock, Mann Island, around Lime Street, the Baltic Triangle, RopeWalks, and Edge Lane.[72][73][74] Changes to Liverpool's governance took place in 2014. The local authority of Liverpool City Council decided to pool its power and resources with surrounding boroughs through the formation of the Liverpool City Region Combined Authority in a form of devolution. With a devolved budget granted by central government, the authority now oversees and invests in foremost strategic affairs throughout the Liverpool City Region, including major regeneration projects. The authority, along with Liverpool City Council itself, has embarked on long-term plans to grow the population and economy of the city.[75][76][77][78] By the 2020s, urban regeneration throughout the city continues. Liverpool Waters, a mixed-use development in the city's disused northern docklands, has been identified as one of the largest megaprojects in the UK's history. Everton's new stadium at Bramley-Moore Dock was regarded as the largest single-site private sector development in the United Kingdom at the time of construction.[79][80] Major events, business and political conferences regularly take place in the city and form an important part of the economy. In June 2014, Prime Minister David Cameron launched the International Festival for Business in Liverpool, the world's largest business event in 2014,[81] and the largest in the UK since the Festival of Britain in 1951.[82] The Labour Party has chosen Liverpool numerous times since the mid 2010s for their annual Labour Party Conference. Liverpool hosted the Eurovision Song Contest 2023. Liverpool has been a centre of invention and innovation. Railways, transatlantic steamships, municipal trams,[83] and electric trains were all pioneered in Liverpool as modes of mass transit. In 1829 and 1836, the first railway tunnels in the world were constructed under Liverpool (Wapping Tunnel). From 1950 to 1951, the world's first scheduled passenger helicopter service ran between Liverpool and Cardiff.[84] The first School for the Blind,[85] Mechanics' Institute,[86] High School for Girls,[87][88] council house,[89] and Juvenile Court[90] were all founded in Liverpool. Charities such as the RSPCA,[91] NSPCC,[92] Age Concern,[93] Relate, and Citizen's Advice Bureau[94] all evolved from work in the city. The first lifeboat station, public bath and wash-house,[95] sanitary act,[96] medical officer for health (William Henry Duncan), district nurse, slum clearance,[97] purpose-built ambulance,[98] X-ray medical diagnosis,[99] school of tropical medicine (Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine), motorised municipal fire-engine,[100] free school meal,[101] cancer research centre,[102] and zoonosis research centre[103] all originated in Liverpool. The first British Nobel Prize was awarded in 1902 to Ronald Ross, professor at the School of Tropical Medicine, the first school of its kind in the world.[104] Orthopaedic surgery was pioneered in Liverpool by Hugh Owen Thomas,[105] and modern medical anaesthetics by Thomas Cecil Gray. The world's first integrated sewer system was constructed in Liverpool by James Newlands, appointed in 1847 as the UK's first borough engineer.[106][107] Liverpool also founded the UK's first Underwriters' Association[108] and the first Institute of Accountants. The Western world's first financial derivatives (cotton futures) were traded on the Liverpool Cotton Exchange in the late 1700s.[109] In the arts, Liverpool was home to the first lending library (The Lyceum), athenaeum society (Liverpool Athenaeum), arts centre (Bluecoat Chambers),[110] and public art conservation centre (National Conservation Centre).[111] It is also home to the UK's oldest surviving classical orchestra (Royal Liverpool Philharmonic Orchestra)[112] and repertory theatre (Liverpool Playhouse).[113] In 1864, Peter Ellis built the world's first iron-framed, curtain-walled office building, Oriel Chambers, which was a prototype of the skyscraper. The UK's first purpose-built department store was Compton House, completed in 1867 for the retailer J.R. Jeffrey.[114] It was the largest store in the world at the time.[115] Between 1862 and 1867, Liverpool held an annual Grand Olympic Festival. Devised by John Hulley and Charles Pierre Melly, these games were the first to be wholly amateur in nature and international in outlook.[116][117] The programme of the first modern Olympiad in Athens in 1896 was almost identical to that of the Liverpool Olympics.[118] In 1865, Hulley co-founded the National Olympian Association in Liverpool, a forerunner of the British Olympic Association. Its articles of foundation provided the framework for the Olympic Charter. A concept devised by retail entrepreneur David Lewis, the first Christmas grotto opened in Lewis's department store in Liverpool in 1879.[119] Sir Alfred Lewis Jones, a shipowner, introduced bananas to the UK via Liverpool's docks in 1884.[120] The Mersey Railway, opened in 1886, incorporated the world's first tunnel under a tidal estuary[121] and the world's first deep-level underground stations (Liverpool James Street railway station). In 1889, borough engineer John Alexander Brodie invented the football goal net. He was also a pioneer in the use of pre-fabricated housing[123] and oversaw the construction of the UK's first ring road (A5058) and intercity highway (East Lancashire Road), as well as the Queensway Tunnel linking Liverpool and Birkenhead. Described as \"the eighth wonder of the world\" at the time of its construction, it was the longest underwater tunnel in the world for 24 years. In 1897, the Lumière brothers filmed Liverpool,[124] including what is believed to be the world's first tracking shot,[125] taken from the Liverpool Overhead Railway, the world's first elevated electrified railway. The Overhead Railway was the first railway in the world to use electric multiple units, employ automatic signalling, and install an escalator. Liverpool inventor Frank Hornby was a visionary in toy development and manufacture, producing three of the most popular lines of toys in the 20th century: Meccano, Hornby Model Railways (both in 1901), and Dinky Toys in 1934.[126] The British Interplanetary Society, founded in Liverpool in 1933 by Phillip Ellaby Cleator, is the world's oldest existing organisation devoted to the promotion of spaceflight. Its journal, the Journal of the British Interplanetary Society, is the longest-running astronautical publication in the world.[127] In 1999, Liverpool was the first city outside London to be awarded blue plaques by English Heritage in recognition of the \"significant contribution made by its sons and daughters in all walks of life\".[128] For the purposes of local government, Liverpool is classified as a metropolitan borough with city status. The metropolitan borough is located within both the county of Merseyside and the Liverpool City Region. Each of these geographical areas is treated as an administrative area with different levels of local governance applying to each. Liverpool City Council is the governing body solely for the Metropolitan Borough of Liverpool and performs functions that are standard of an English Unitary Authority. The Liverpool City Region Combined Authority and the Mayor of the Liverpool City Region reserve major strategic powers over such things as transport, economic development and regeneration for the city along with the 5 surrounding boroughs of the Liverpool City Region. The Combined Authority has competency over areas which have been devolved by national government and are specific to the city region.[129] Nevertheless, there are a few exceptions to local governance apart from these two structures. Liverpool was administered by Merseyside County Council between 1974 and 1986 and some residual aspects of organisation which date back to this time have survived. When the County Council was disbanded in 1986, most civic functions were transferred to Liverpool City Council. However, several authorities such as the police and fire and rescue service, continue to be run at a county-wide level. The county of Merseyside, therefore, continues to exist as an administrative area for a few limited services only, while the capability and capacity of the Liverpool City Region Combined Authority is evolving over time.[130] The city also elects five members of Parliament (MPs) to the Westminster Parliament, all Labour as of the 2024 general election. Liverpool City Council operates under a constitution comprising 85 city councillors who are directly elected by the Liverpool electorate every 4 years and represent a variety of different political parties. The city councillors make decisions about local services for the city's people. At each election, the political party that wins the majority of the 85 council seats leads the council for the following 4 years. The local leader of this party assumes the role of Leader of the City Council who then chairs a Cabinet of 9 councillors who are assigned specific responsibilities known as 'portfolios'. The incumbent Leader of Liverpool City Council is Councillor Liam Robinson, who represents the Labour Party, which secured a large majority at the 2023 local election,[132] the Leader is also a member of the Mayor of the Liverpool City Regions cabinet (Separate from the City Council Cabinet), at present Robinson holds the portfolio of Cabinet Member for Innovation. The City Council's decisions and scrutiny of activities are undertaken by a number of different committees and panels which include the Overview and Scrutiny Committees, Scrutiny Panels, Regulatory Committees and other committees. The day-to-day management of the council is carried out by the management team which includes the Chief Executive and several directors and senior officers. The management team works with the Cabinet and councillors to deliver strategic direction and priorities such as the budget and the City Plan.[133][134] Every four years, the city elects 85 councillors from 64 local council wards.[135] During the 2023 Liverpool City Council election, the Labour Party consolidated its control of Liverpool City Council, following on from the previous elections. Out of the total 85 City Council seats up for election, The Labour Party won 61 seats (53.13% of the electorate's total votes), the Liberal Democrats won 15 seats (21.61% of the votes), the Green Party won 3 seats (9.76% of the votes), the Liverpool Community Independents won 3 seats (4.64% of the votes) and the Liberal Party won the remaining 3 seats (3.21% of the votes). The Conservative Party, the political party in power at national government, had no representation on Liverpool City Council. Only 27.27% of the eligible Liverpool electorate turned out to vote.[136] Throughout most of the 19th and early 20th centuries, Liverpool was a municipal stronghold of Toryism. However, support for the Conservative Party in recent times has been among the lowest in any part of Britain, particularly since the monetarist economic policies of former prime minister Margaret Thatcher. After the 1979 general election, many have claimed that her victory contributed to longstanding high unemployment and decline in the city.[137] Liverpool is one of the Labour Party's key strongholds; however, the city has also seen hard times under Labour governments. Particularly in the Winter of Discontent (late 1978 and early 1979) when Liverpool suffered public sector strikes along with the rest of the United Kingdom, but also when it suffered the particularly humiliating misfortune of having grave-diggers going on strike, leaving the dead unburied for long periods.[138] In recent years, Liverpool City Council began an extensive improvement program designed to ensure that the authority makes efficient use of taxpayer's money and to encourage more business and investment in the city. Grosvenor Group, the property company responsible for Liverpool One, commended the changes as an \"opportunity for bold thinking in liverpool\".[139] In 2021, a highly critical government inspection and subsequent report of Liverpool City Council (referred to as the Caller report) identified multiple shortcomings at Liverpool City Council. The Secretary of State for Housing, Communities and Local Government, Robert Jenrick sent government commissioners to oversee the City Council's highways, regeneration, property management, governance and financial decision-making. The authority was compelled to commit to a three-year improvement plan in which the entire structure of the council would be overhauled. As a result of the intervention, major structural changes at the City Council took place by the 2023 United Kingdom local elections, which were labelled \"the most unpredictable [elections] in the city's history\". The number of electoral wards in the city was doubled from 30 to 64, while the overall number of City Councillors up for election was reduced from 90 to 85. In future, the council would also change to 'all out' elections every four years whereby every single City Councillor would be eligible for re-election at the same time. The role of elected city mayor was also abolished and the Council reverted to the previous Leader and Cabinet style of leadership. The outcome of the elections were seen not only as a test of how the general public would respond to the government intervention in the city, but also to Prime Minister Rishi Sunak's government as a whole.[140][141][142][143] Councillor Liam Robinson became the new Leader of Liverpool City Council at the 2023 City Council election. The Liverpool Strategic Futures Advisory Panel, chaired by the Mayor of Liverpool City Region Steve Rotheram, and including several high-profile figures with experience in local government, was established. The panel was tasked with directing the council's long-term future outside of government intervention measures and to advise on plans and priorities that the city should pursue.[144] In February 2008, Liverpool City Council was reported to be the worst-performing council in the country, receiving just a one-star rating (classified as inadequate). The main cause of the poor rating was attributed to the council's poor handling of tax-payer money, including the accumulation of a £20m shortfall while the city held the title of European Capital of Culture.[145] In April 2024, the Office for Local Government released a ranking of local authorities, placing Liverpool City Council 317th out of a possible 318.[146] The Lord Mayor of Liverpool is an ancient ceremonial role. Councillors within Liverpool City Council (not the general public) elect the Lord Mayor annually, who then serves a one-year term. The Lord Mayor is styled as the \"first citizen\" and is chosen to represent the city at civic functions and engagements, promote it to the wider world, support local charities and community groups, attend religious events, meet delegates from Liverpool's twin cities, chair council meetings and confer Honorary Freemen and associations.[147] The Lord Mayor is also the presiding officer for Liverpool City Council full meetings. . Liverpool is one of the six constituent boroughs of the Liverpool City Region. The Mayor of the Liverpool City Region is directly every four years by residents of those six boroughs and oversees the Liverpool City Region Combined Authority. The Combined Authority is the top-tier administrative body for the local governance of the city region and is tasked with taking major strategic decisions on issues such as transport and investment, economic development, employment and skills, tourism, culture, housing and physical infrastructure. The current Mayor is Steve Rotheram. Liverpool is included within five parliamentary constituencies, through which MPs are elected to represent the city in Westminster: Liverpool Riverside, Liverpool Walton, Liverpool Wavertree, Liverpool West Derby and Garston and Halewood.[148] At the last general election, all were won by Labour with representation being from Kim Johnson, Dan Carden, Paula Barker and Ian Byrne respectively.[149] Due to boundary changes prior to the 2010 election, the Liverpool Garston constituency was merged with most of Knowsley South to form the Garston and Halewood cross-boundary seat. At the most recent 2024 election, this seat was won by Maria Eagle of the Labour Party.[149] Liverpool has been described as having \"the most splendid setting of any English city.\"[150] At 53°24′0″N 2°59′0″W﻿ / ﻿53.40000°N 2.98333°W﻿ / 53.40000; -2.98333 (53.4, −2.98), 176 miles (283 kilometres) northwest of London, located on the Liverpool Bay of the Irish Sea, Liverpool is built across a ridge of sandstone hills rising up to a height of around 230 feet (70 m) above sea-level at Everton Hill, which represents the southern boundary of the West Lancashire Coastal Plain. The Mersey Estuary separates Liverpool from the Wirral Peninsula. The boundaries of Liverpool are adjacent to Bootle, Crosby and Maghull in south Sefton to the north, and Kirkby, Huyton, Prescot and Halewood in Knowsley to the east. Liverpool experiences a temperate maritime climate (Köppen: Cfb), like much of the British Isles, with relatively mild summers, cool winters and rainfall spread fairly evenly throughout the year. Rainfall and temperature records had been kept at Bidston Hill since 1867, but records for atmospheric pressure go back as far as at least 1846.[151] Bidston closed down in 2002 but the Met Office also has a weather station at Crosby. Since records began in 1867, temperatures have ranged from −17.6 °C (0.3 °F) on 21 December 2010 to 34.5 °C (94.1 °F) on 2 August 1990, although Liverpool Airport recorded a temperature of 35.0 °C (95.0 °F) on 19 July 2006.[152] The lowest amount of sunshine on record was 16.5 hours in December 1927 whereas the most was 314.5 hours in July 2013.[153][154] Tornado activity or funnel cloud formation is very rare in and around the Liverpool area and tornadoes that do form are usually weak. Recent tornadoes or funnel clouds in Merseyside have been seen in 1998 and 2014.[155][156] During the period 1981–2010, Crosby recorded an average of 32.8 days of air frost per year, which is low for the United Kingdom.[157] Snow is fairly common during the winter although heavy snow is rare. Snow generally falls between November and March but can occasionally fall earlier and later. In recent times, the earliest snowfall was on 1 October 2008[158] while the latest occurred on 15 May 2012.[159] Although historically, the earliest snowfall occurred on 10 September 1908[160] and the latest on 2 June 1975.[161] Rainfall, although light, is quite a common occurrence in Liverpool, with the wettest month on record being August 1956, which recorded 221.2 mm (8.71 in) of rain and the driest being February 1932, with 0.9 mm (0.035 in).[162] The driest year on record was 1991, with 480.5 mm (18.92 in) of rainfall and the wettest was 1872, with 1,159.9 mm (45.67 in).[163] Suburbs and districts of Liverpool include: In 2010, Liverpool City Council and the Primary Care Trust commissioned the Mersey Forest to complete \"A Green Infrastructure Strategy\" for the city.[172] Liverpool is a core urban element of a green belt region that extends into the wider surrounding counties, which is in place to reduce urban sprawl, prevent the towns in the conurbation from further convergence, protect the identity of outlying communities, encourage brownfield reuse, and preserve nearby countryside. This is achieved by restricting inappropriate development within the designated areas and imposing stricter conditions on permitted building.[173] Due to being already highly built up, the city contains limited portions of protected green belt area within greenfield throughout the borough at Fazakerley, Croxteth Hall and country park and Craven Wood, Woodfields Park and nearby golf courses in Netherley, small greenfield tracts east of the Speke area by the St Ambrose primary school, and the small hamlet of Oglet and the surrounding area south of Liverpool Airport.[174] The green belt was first drawn up in 1983 under Merseyside County Council[175] and the size in the city amounts to 530 hectares (5.3 km2; 2.0 sq mi).[176] Since the mid-20th century, Scouser has become the predominant demonym for the inhabitants of Liverpool, and is strongly associated with the Scouse accent and dialect of the city.[177] The Scouse accent is described as progressively diverging from the Lancastrian accent in the late 19th century.[178][179][180][181][182] The etymology of Scouser is derived from the traditional dish Scouse brought to the area by sailors travelling through Liverpool's port.[183][182][184] Prior to the establishment of Scouser as there have been a number of different terms used to refer to inhabitants of Liverpool of varying popularity and longevity: Professor Tony Crowley argues that up until the 1950s, inhabitants of Liverpool were generally referred to by a number of demonyms. He argues that there was a debate in the mid 20th century between the two rival terms of 'Liverpolitan' and 'Liverpudlian'. The debate surrounded the lexicology of these terms and their connotations of social class.[184][188] Professor John Belchem suggests that a series of other nicknames such as 'Dick Liver', 'Dicky Sam' and 'whacker' were used, but gradually fell out of use. Belchem and Philip Boland suggest that comedic radio presenters and entertainers brought the Liverpool identity to a national audience, which in turn encouraged locals to be gradually more known as 'scousers'. By the time that Frank Shaw's My Liverpool, a Celebration of 'Scousetown' was published in 1971, Belchem argues that 'Scouser' had firmly become the dominant demonym.[177][189][190] The city of Liverpool is at the core of a much larger and more populous metropolitan area, however, at the most recent UK Census in 2021, the area governed by Liverpool City Council had a population of 486,100, a 4.2% increase from the previous Census in 2011. This figure increased to 500,500 people by 2022, according to data from Liverpool City Council. Taking in to account how local government is organised within the cities and metropolitan areas of England, the Liverpool was the fifth largest of England's 'core cities' and had the second overall highest population density of those, by 2021.[202][203] The population of the city has steadily risen since the 2001 Census. As well as having a growing population, the population density also grew at the 2021 Census compared to the previous Census. Since 2011, its population size ranked 10th out of 309 local authority areas.[204] The population of the city is comparatively younger than that of England as a whole. Family life in the city is also growing at odds with the North West England region as a whole: At the 2021 Census, the percentage of households including a couple without children increased in Liverpool, but fell across the North West. The percentage of people aged 16 years and over (excluding full-time students) who were employed also increased in Liverpool compared to the overall North West region where it fell. The 2021 Census also showed that Liverpool's ethnic and international population was growing. The number of residents in the city born outside of England has increased since the previous Census, while the number of residents who did not identify with any national identity associated with the UK has also increased at a faster rate than England as a whole. The overall share of the city's population who identified as Asian and Black increased, while the percentage who identified as white decreased in the city compared with previous Census.[205] It has been argued that the city can claim to have one of the strongest Irish heritages in the United Kingdom, with as many as 75 percent (estimated) of Liverpool's population with some form of Irish ancestry.[206] The growing population of Liverpool in the 21st century reverses a trend which took place between the 1930s and 2001, when the population of the city proper effectively halved. At the 1931 United Kingdom census, Liverpool's population reached an all-time high of 846,302. Following this peak, in response to central government policy, the Council authority of Liverpool then built and owned large several 'new town' council estates in the suburbs within Liverpool's metropolitan area. Tens of thousands of people were systematically relocated to new housing in areas such as Halton, Knowsley, St Helens, Sefton, Wirral, Cheshire West and Chester, West Lancashire, Warrington and as far as North Wales. Such a mass relocation and population loss during this time was common practice for many British cities, including London and Manchester, In contrast, satellite towns such as Kirkby, Skelmersdale and Runcorn saw a corresponding rise in their populations (Kirkby being the fastest growing town in Britain during the 1960s).[207][208][205][209] Liverpool is typically grouped with the wider Merseyside (plus Halton) area for the purpose of defining its metropolitan footprint, and there are several methodologies. Sometimes, this metropolitan area is broadened to encompass urban settlements in the neighbouring counties of Lancashire and Cheshire.[210][211] The Office for National Statistics in the United Kingdom uses the international standardised International Territorial Levels (ITLs) to divide up the economic territory of the UK. This enables the ONS to calculate regional and local statistics and data. The ONS uses a series of codes to identify these areas. In order of hierarchy from largest area to smallest area, Liverpool is part of the following regions:[212][213][214] North West England (code TLD) At the 2021 Census, the ITL 1 region of North West England had a usual resident population of 7,417,300.[215] Merseyside (code TLD7) The ITL 2 region of Merseyside is defined as the area comprising East Merseyside (TLD71) plus Liverpool (TLD72), Sefton (TLD73) and Wirral (TLD74). At the 2021 Census, the population of this area was as follows:[216] East Merseyside (TLD71): Liverpool (TLD72) = 486,100 Sefton (TLD73) = 279,300 Wirral (TLD74) = 320,200 Therefore, the total population of the ITL 2 Merseyside region was 1,551,500 based on the 2021 Census. The smallest ITL 3 area classed as Liverpool (code TLD72), therefore, had a population of 486,100 at the 2021 Census. At the 2021 Census, the ONS used a refreshed concept of built-up areas (BUAs) based on the physical built environment, using satellite imagery to recognise developed land, such as cities, towns, and villages. This allows the ONS to investigate economic and social statistics based on actual settlements where most people live. Data from the 2021 Census is not directly comparable with 2011 Census data due to this revised methodology. Using the population figures of BUAs at the 2021 Census (excluding London), Liverpool Built-up Area is the third largest in England with some 506,565 usual residents (behind only Birmingham and Leeds). Liverpool's built-up area is, therefore, larger than the major English cities of Bristol, Manchester, Newcastle upon Tyne, Nottingham and Sheffield.[217] Excluding London, the Liverpool City Region was the 4th largest combined authority area in England, by 2021. The population is approximately 1.6 million. The Liverpool City Region is a political and economic partnership between local authorities including Liverpool, plus the Metropolitan boroughs of Knowsley, Sefton, St Helens, Wirral and the Borough of Halton. The Liverpool City Region Combined Authority exercises strategic governance powers for the region in many areas. The economic data of the Liverpool city region is of particular policy interest to the Office for National Statistics, particularly as the British Government continuously explores the potential to negotiate increased devolved powers for each combined authority area.[218][219][220][221] A 2011 report, Liverpool City Region – Building on its Strengths, by Lord Heseltine and Terry Leahy, stated that \"what is now called Liverpool City Region has a population of around 1.5 million\", but also referred to \"an urban region that spreads from Wrexham and Flintshire to Chester, Warrington, West Lancashire and across to Southport\", with a population of 2.3 million.[222] In 2006, in an attempt to harmonise the series of metropolitan areas across the European Union, ESPON (now European Observation Network for Territorial Development and Cohesion) released a study defining a \"Liverpool/Birkenhead Metropolitan area\" with an estimated population of 2,241,000 people. The metro area comprised a functional urban area consisting of a contiguous urban sprawl, labour pool, and commuter Travel to work areas. The analysis defined this metropolitan area as Liverpool itself, combined with the surrounding areas of Birkenhead, Wigan/Ashton, Warrington, Widnes/Runcorn, Chester, Southport, Ellesmere Port, Ormskirk and Skelmersdale.[6] Liverpool and Manchester are sometimes considered as one large polynuclear metropolitan area,[223][224][225] or megalopolis. In recent decades, Liverpool's population is becoming more multicultural. According to the 2021 census, 77% of all Liverpool residents described their ethnic group as White English, Welsh, Scottish, Northern Irish or British. The remaining 23% were described as non-White English/British. Between 2011 and 2021, there was population growth across all ethnic groups, except 'White English/British' and 'Any Other', where there were overall losses. The number of 'Other White residents' in Liverpool also increased by almost 12,000 people, with notable increases in the 'Other Asian', 'Arab', and 'Other Mixed/Multiple' population categories. The non-White English/British population as a percentage of the total population across the 'newly organised city electoral wards' ranged from 5% in the Orrell Park ward to 69% in the Princes Park ward. 9 out of 10 Liverpool residents regarded English as their main language. The highest non-English languages in the city were Arabic (5,743 main speakers) followed by Polish (4,809 main speakers). Overall, almost 45,000 residents had a main language that was not English.[226] According to a 2014 survey, the ten most popular surnames of Liverpool and their occurrence in the population are:[228][229] Liverpool is home to Britain's oldest Black community, dating to at least the 1730s. Some Liverpudlians can trace their black ancestry in the city back ten generations.[230] Early Black settlers in the city included seamen, the children of traders sent to be educated, and freed slaves, since slaves entering the country after 1722 were deemed free men.[231] Since the 20th century, Liverpool is also noted for its large African-Caribbean,[4] Ghanaian,[232] and Somali[233] communities, formed of more recent African-descended immigrants and their subsequent generations. The city is also home to the oldest Chinese community in Europe; the first residents of the city's Chinatown arrived as seamen in the 19th century.[234] The traditional Chinese gateway erected in Liverpool's Chinatown is the largest such gateway outside China. Liverpool also has a long-standing Filipino community. Lita Roza, a singer from Liverpool who was the first woman to achieve a UK number one hit, had Filipino ancestry. The city is also known for its large Irish and Welsh populations.[235] In 1813, 10 per cent of Liverpool's population was Welsh, leading to the city becoming known as \"the capital of North Wales.\"[235] During, and in the decades following, the Great Irish Famine in the mid-19th century, up to two million Irish people travelled to Liverpool within one decade, with many subsequently departing for the United States.[236] By 1851, more than 20 per cent of the population of Liverpool was Irish.[237] At the 2001 Census, 1.17 per cent of the population were Welsh-born and 0.75 per cent were born in the Republic of Ireland, while 0.54 per cent were born in Northern Ireland,[238] but many more Liverpudlians are of legacy Welsh or Irish ancestry.[239] Other contemporary ethnicities include Indian,[4] Latin American,[240] Malaysian,[241] and Yemeni[242] communities, which number several thousand each. The thousands of migrants and sailors passing through Liverpool resulted in a religious diversity that is still apparent today. This is reflected in the equally diverse collection of religious buildings,[244] including two Christian cathedrals. Liverpool is known to be England's 'most Catholic city', with a Catholic population much larger than in other parts of England.[245] This is mainly due to high historic Irish migration to the city and their descendants since.[246] The parish church of Liverpool is the Anglican Our Lady and St Nicholas, colloquially known as \"the sailors church\", which has existed near the waterfront since 1257. It regularly plays host to Catholic masses. Other notable churches include the Greek Orthodox Church of St Nicholas (built in the Neo-Byzantine architecture style), and the Gustav Adolf Church (the Swedish Seamen's Church, reminiscent of Nordic styles). Liverpool's wealth as a port city enabled the construction of two enormous cathedrals in the 20th century. The Anglican Cathedral, which was designed by Sir Giles Gilbert Scott and plays host to the annual Liverpool Shakespeare Festival, has one of the longest naves, largest organs and heaviest and highest peals of bells in the world. The Roman Catholic Metropolitan Cathedral, on Mount Pleasant next to Liverpool Science Park, was initially planned to be even larger. Of Sir Edwin Lutyens's original design, only the crypt was completed. The cathedral was eventually built to a simpler design by Sir Frederick Gibberd. While this is on a smaller scale than Lutyens' original design, it still incorporates the largest panel of stained glass in the world. The road running between the two cathedrals is called Hope Street. The cathedral has long been colloquially referred to as \"Paddy's Wigwam\" due to its shape.[247] Liverpool contains several synagogues, of which the Grade I listed Moorish Revival Princes Road Synagogue is architecturally the most notable. Princes Road is widely considered to be the most magnificent of Britain's Moorish Revival synagogues and one of the finest buildings in Liverpool.[248] Liverpool has a thriving Jewish community with a further two orthodox Synagogues, one in the Allerton district of the city and a second in the Childwall district of the city where a significant Jewish community reside. A third orthodox Synagogue in the Greenbank Park area of L17 has recently closed and is a listed 1930s structure. There is also a Lubavitch Chabad House and a reform Synagogue. Liverpool has had a Jewish community since the mid-18th century. The Jewish population of Liverpool is around 5,000.[249] The Liverpool Talmudical College existed from 1914 until 1990, when its classes moved to the Childwall Synagogue.[citation needed] Liverpool also has a Hindu community, with a Mandir on Edge Lane, Edge Hill. The Shri Radha Krishna Temple from the Hindu Cultural Organisation in Liverpool is located there.[250] Liverpool also has the Guru Nanak Sikh Gurdwara in Wavertree[251] and a Baháʼí Centre in the same area.[252] The city had the earliest Mosque in England and possibly the UK, founded in 1887 by William Abdullah Quilliam, a lawyer who had converted to Islam who set up the Liverpool Muslim Institute in a terraced house on West Derby Road.[253] Apart from the first mosque in England which now houses a museum,[254][255] the largest and main one, Al-Rahma mosque, was also the third purpose-built mosque in the United Kingdom.[256] The second largest mosque in Liverpool is the Masjid Al-Taiseer.[257] Other mosques in the city include the Bait ul Lateef Ahmadiyya Mosque,[258] Hamza Center (Community Center),[259] Islamic community centre,[260] Liverpool Mosque and Islamic Institute,[261] Liverpool Towhid Centre,[262] Masjid Annour,[263] and the Shah Jalal Mosque.[264] Liverpool forms an integral part of North West England's economy, the third largest regional economy in the United Kingdom. The city is also a major contributor to the economy of Liverpool City Region, worth over £40 billion per year.[268][269][270] The local authority area governed by Liverpool City Council accounts for 39% of the Liverpool city region's total jobs, 40% of its total GVA and 35% of its total businesses. At the local authority level, the city's GVA (balanced) at current basic prices was £14.3 billion in 2021. Its GDP at current market prices was £15.9 billion. This equates to £32,841 per head of the population.[271][272] At the 2021 United Kingdom census, 51.1% of Liverpool's population aged 16 years and over was classed as employed, 44.2% economically inactive and 4.8% unemployed. Of those employed, the most popular industries providing the employment were human health and social work activities (18.7%), wholesale and retail trade; repair of motor vehicles and motor cycles (15%), education (10.8%), public administration and defence; compulsory social security (7.3%), accommodation and food service activities (6.8%), construction (6.5%), transport and storage (5.8%), manufacturing (5.5%) and professional, scientific and technical activities (5.2%).[273] According to the ONS Business Register and Employment Survey 2021, some industries within Liverpool perform strongly compared to other local authorities in Great Britain. In terms of absolute number of jobs per industry in Great Britain's local authority areas, Liverpool features in the national top 10 for human health and social work activities; arts, entertainment and recreation; public administration and defence; compulsory social security; accommodation and food service activities and real estate activities. Liverpool features in the national top 20 for number of jobs in education; construction; wholesale and retail trade; repair of motor vehicles and motorcycles; transportation and storage; financial and insurance activities and professional, scientific and technical activities.[274] In 2023, Liverpool City Council set out an economic growth plan for the city over the following 20 years. The City Council will have particular focus on economic sectors such as the visitor economy (tourism), culture, life sciences, digital and creative sectors, and advanced car manufacturing.[275] According to the International passenger Survey, from the ONS, Liverpool was one of the top 5 most visited cities in the UK by overseas tourists in 2022. As of the same year, the city's tourist industry was worth a total of £3.5 billion annually and was part of a larger city region tourist industry worth £5 billion. A consistent calendar of major events, as well as a plethora of cultural attractions, continue to provide a significant draw for tourists. Tourism related to the Beatles is worth an estimated £100m to the Liverpool economy each year alone. Liverpool One, as well as a growing retail offer overall, has led to the city being one of the most prominent destinations for shopping in the UK. Liverpool Cruise Terminal, which is situated close to the Pier Head, enables tourists to berth in the centre of the city.[276][277][278][279][280][281][282] Liverpool is home to the Knowledge Quarter, a 450-acre city centre district that hosts some of the world's most influential institutions in science, health, technology, education, music and the creative performing arts. The UK government has also identified the city as a 'pharmaceutical production superpower' and one of the UK's leading regions for bioprocessing. The accolade led to the government choosing the city for England's second ever 'Investment Zone' in 2023. This will involve millions of pounds being invested over the coming years in to science orientated districts including the Knowledge Quarter and the so-called 'pharma cluster' in the city suburb of Speke. The two clusters form an internationally significant role in infectious disease control. Liverpool City Council also plan to invest in the city's Baltic Triangle, which is renowned in the creative and digital industries.[283][284][285][286][287][288] Car manufacturing also takes place in the city at the Jaguar Land Rover Halewood plant, where the Range Rover Evoque model is assembled. In 2023, Jaguar Land Rover announced that the Halewood plant would begin to shift its focus to electric car production.[289][290] Historically, the economy of Liverpool was centred on the city's port and manufacturing base. Today, the Port of Liverpool is the UK's fourth largest port by tonnage of freight, handling over 30 million tonnes in 2020. The city is also the UK's largest port for transatlantic trade, handling 45% of the country's trade from the United States. In 2023, the city was chosen by the British government to be a designated Freeport to encourage growing international commerce. The Liverpool2 container terminal, completed in 2022, has greatly increased the volume of cargo which Liverpool is able to handle and has facilitated the world's biggest container vessels.[291][292][293][294][295][296][297] Liverpool is also home to numerous UK headquarters, or the major strategic branch offices, of many shipping and freight lines including: Atlantic Container Line,[298] Bibby Line,[299] Borchard Lines Ltd,[300] CMA CGM,[301] Hapag-Lloyd,[302] Independent Container Line,[303] Irish Ferries,[304] Maersk Line,[305] Mediterranean Shipping Company[306] and Zim Integrated Shipping Services.[307] Liverpool's rich architectural base has helped the city become the second most filmed city in the UK outside London. As well as being a featured location in its own right, it often doubles up for Chicago, London, Moscow, New York City, Paris and Rome. The Depot studios, close to the city centre, provide space for film and TV productions.[308][309] Major economic projects planned for the city include the revitalisation of disused land in the North docks/Ten Streets area, Liverpool Waters and a new purpose built TV studio at the former Littlewoods Pools building, adjacent to the Depot.[310][311][312] The Liverpool City Region GDP in 2021 was £40.479 billion. The 6 contributing boroughs to this GDP were as follows:[313] The policy agenda of the British Government is to continuously monitor the economy and productivity of the UK's core cities within the context of their respective city regions. The government's longer-term plan is to assess each area's potential for increased devolution and transfer of additional powers and budgets from central government in Whitehall to their corresponding combined authorities. As such, official statistics about Liverpool's economy within the context of the Liverpool City Region, are closely monitored by the Office for National Statistics. This allows policy and decision makers to more accurately assess the 'functional economic area' of the city, which is not bound by traditional local government geographies.[314][315][316][317][318] As of 2023, there are 10 city regions in England with Combined Authorities. The economy of Liverpool's combined authority area in comparison to the other city regions is as follows: Liverpool's long commercial history has given rise to a considerable variety of architectural styles found within the city, ranging from 16th century Tudor buildings to modern-day contemporary architecture.[320] The majority of buildings in the city date from the late-18th century onwards, the period during which the city grew into one of the foremost powers in the British Empire.[321] There are over 2,500 listed buildings in Liverpool, of which 27 are Grade I listed[322] and 85 are Grade II* listed.[323] The city also has a greater number of public sculptures than any other location in the United Kingdom aside from Westminster and significant number of Georgian houses still exist.[324][325] This richness of architecture has subsequently seen Liverpool described by English Heritage, as England's finest Victorian city.[326] The value of Liverpool's architecture and design was recognised in 2004, when several areas throughout the city were declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site. Known as the Liverpool Maritime Mercantile City, the sites were added in recognition of the city's role in the development of international trade and docking technology.[327] However, this status was revoked in July 2021, when UNESCO resolved that recent and proposed developments, such as the Bramley-Moore Dock Stadium and Liverpool Waters projects, had resulted in the \"serious deterioration\" of the area's significance.[328] As a major British port, the docks in Liverpool have historically been central to the city's development. Several major docking firsts have occurred in the city including the construction of the world's first enclosed wet dock (the Old Dock) in 1715 and the first ever hydraulic lifting cranes.[329] The best-known dock in Liverpool is the Royal Albert Dock, which was constructed in 1846 and today comprises the largest single collection of Grade I listed buildings anywhere in Britain.[330] Built under the guidance of Jesse Hartley, it was considered to be one of the most advanced docks anywhere in the world upon completion and is often attributed with helping the city to become one of the most important ports in the world. Today, the Royal Albert Dock houses restaurants, bars, shops, two hotels as well as the Merseyside Maritime Museum, International Slavery Museum, Tate Liverpool and The Beatles Story. North of the city centre is Stanley Dock, home to the Stanley Dock Tobacco Warehouse, which was at the time of its construction in 1901, the world's largest building in terms of area[331] and today stands as the world's largest brick-work building.[332] One of the most famous locations in Liverpool is the Pier Head, renowned for the trio of buildings – the Royal Liver Building, the Cunard Building and the Port of Liverpool Building – which sit upon it. Collectively referred to as the Three Graces, these buildings stand as a testament to the great wealth in the city during the late 19th and early 20th century. Built in a variety of architectural styles, they are recognised as being the symbol of 'maritime Liverpool' and are regarded by many as contributing to one of the most impressive waterfronts in the world.[333][334][335][336] In the 21st century, several areas along Liverpool's waterfront have undergone significant redevelopment. Among the notable developments are the Museum of Liverpool, the construction of the Liverpool Arena, ACC Liverpool and Exhibition Centre Liverpool on King's Dock, Alexandra Tower and 1 Princes Dock on Prince's Dock and Liverpool Marina around Coburg and Brunswick Docks. The Wheel of Liverpool opened on 25 March 2010.[337][338] However, plans to redevelop parts of Liverpool city centre have been marred by controversy. In December 2016, a newly formed company called North Point Global Ltd. was given the rights to develop part of the docks under the \"New Chinatown\" working name. Though heavily advertised in Liverpool, Hong Kong and Chinese cities with high-profile advertisements and videos, the \"New Chinatown\" development failed to materialise.[339] In January 2018, the Liverpool Echo and Asia Times revealed that the site remained sans any construction. North Point Global as well as its subcontractor \"Bilt\" had both declared bankruptcy, and the small investors (mostly middle class couples) who had already paid money for the apartments had lost most of their savings in them.[340] Liverpool's historic position as one of the most important trading ports in the world has meant that over time many grand buildings have been constructed in the city as headquarters for shipping firms, insurance companies, banks and other large firms. The great wealth this brought then allowed for the development of grand civic buildings, which were designed to allow the local administrators to 'run the city with pride'.[341] The commercial district is centred on the Castle Street, Dale Street and Old Hall Street areas of the city, with many of the area's roads still following their medieval layout. Having developed predominantly over a period of three centuries, the area is regarded as one of the most important architectural locations in the city, as recognised by its inclusion in Liverpool's former World Heritage site.[342] The oldest building in the area is the Grade I listed Liverpool Town Hall, which is located at the top of Castle Street and dates from 1754. Often regarded as the city's finest piece of Georgian architecture, the building is known as one of the most extravagantly decorated civic buildings anywhere in Britain.[343][344] Also on Castle Street is the Grade I listed Bank of England Building, constructed between 1845 and 1848, as one of only three provincial branches of the national bank.[343] Among the other buildings in the area are the Tower Buildings, Albion House (the former White Star Line headquarters), the Municipal Buildings and Oriel Chambers,[345] which is considered to be one of the earliest Modernist style buildings ever built.[346] The area around William Brown Street is referred to as the city's 'Cultural Quarter', owing to the presence of numerous civic buildings, including the William Brown Library, Walker Art Gallery, Picton Reading Rooms and World Museum Liverpool. The area is dominated by neo-classical architecture, of which the most prominent, St George's Hall,[347] is widely regarded as the best example of a neo-classical building anywhere in Europe.[348] A Grade I listed building, it was constructed between 1840 and 1855 to serve a variety of civic functions in the city and its doors are inscribed with \"S.P.Q.L.\" (Latin senatus populusque Liverpudliensis), meaning \"the senate and people of Liverpool\". William Brown Street is also home to numerous public monuments and sculptures, including Wellington's Column and the Steble Fountain. Many others are located around the area, particularly in St John's Gardens, which was specifically developed for this purpose.[349] The William Brown Street area has been likened to a modern recreation of the Roman Forum.[350] While the majority of Liverpool's architecture dates from the mid-18th century onwards, there are several buildings that pre-date this time. One of the oldest surviving buildings is Speke Hall, a Tudor manor house located in the south of the city, which was completed in 1598.[351] The building is one of the few remaining timber framed Tudor houses left in the north of England and is particularly noted for its Victorian interiors, which were added in the mid-19th century.[352] In addition to Speke Hall, many of the city's other oldest surviving buildings are also former manor houses including Croxteth Hall and Woolton Hall, which were completed in 1702 and 1704 respectively.[353] The oldest building within the city centre is the Grade I listed Bluecoat Chambers,[354] which was built between 1717 and 1718. Constructed in British Queen Anne style architecture,[355][356] the building was influenced in part by the work of Christopher Wren[357] and was originally the home of the Bluecoat School (who later moved to a larger site in Wavertree in the south of the city). Since 1908, it has acted as a centre for arts in Liverpool.[355] Liverpool is noted for having two Cathedrals, each of which imposes over the landscape around it.[358] The Anglican Cathedral, which was constructed between 1904 and 1978, is the largest Cathedral in Britain[359] and the fifth largest in the world. Designed and built in Gothic style, it is regarded as one of the greatest buildings to have been constructed during the 20th century[360] and was described by former British Poet Laureate, John Betjeman, as \"one of the great buildings of the world\".[361] The Roman Catholic Metropolitan Cathedral was constructed between 1962 and 1967 and is known as one of the first cathedrals to break the traditional longitudinal design.[362] In the 21st century, many parts of Liverpool's city centre have undergone significant redevelopment and regeneration after years of decline. So far, the largest of these developments has been Liverpool One, which saw almost £1 billion invested in the redevelopment of 42 acres (17 hectares) of land, providing new retail, commercial, residential and leisure space.[363] Around the north of the city centre, several new skyscrapers have also been constructed including the RIBA award-winning Unity Buildings and West Tower, which at 140m is Liverpool's tallest building. Many redevelopment schemes are also in progress including Circus,[364] King's Dock,[365] Paddington Village[366] and Liverpool Waters.[367] There are many other notable buildings in Liverpool, including the art deco former terminal building of Speke Airport, the University of Liverpool's Victoria Building, (which provided the inspiration for the term Red Brick University), and the Adelphi Hotel, which was in the past considered to be one of the finest hotels anywhere in the world.[368] The Register of Historic Parks and Gardens of Special Historic Interest in England describes Merseyside's Victorian Parks as collectively the \"most important in the country\".[369] Liverpool has ten listed parks and cemeteries, including two Grade I and five Grade II*, more than any other English city apart from London.[370] Liverpool has an extensive transport infrastructure that connects the city with its metropolitan area, the rest of the United Kingdom, Europe and the world. Various modes of transport provide considerable connections by road, rail, air and sea. The local network of buses, trains and ferries is managed by Merseytravel on behalf of the Liverpool City Region Combined Authority and the Metro Mayor of the Liverpool City Region. The Mayor and Combined Authority have control of a devolved transport budget and associated transport powers for this local system. The city's major port and international airport provide global links for both passengers and freight.[371][372] The city sits at the centre of a much larger metropolitan area. The city's suburbs run contiguously into the neighbouring boroughs defined by the ONS as the Liverpool Built-up Area. The wider City Region and Merseyside in general is densely urbanised and divided by several motorways and major roads. The city is served by a network motorways. The three motorways in closest proximity are the M58 to the north, and M62 and M57 to the east. To the north, the M58 motorway runs 12 miles and provides links to the neighbouring counties of Lancashire and Greater Manchester, finally joining with the M6 west of Wigan.[373] To the east, the M62 runs across the north of the UK, ultimately connecting Liverpool with Hull on the opposite coast, and along the route to several large cities including Manchester, Leeds and Bradford. The M62 also provides a connection to both the M6 and M1 motorways, providing indirect links to more distant areas including Birmingham, London, Nottingham, Preston and Sheffield.[374][375] To the east, but running north-south, the M57 acts as a 10-mile ring road for the city itself and links the M62 and M58 motorways, as well as the A580 East Lancashire Road providing a link directly to the A5300 that links to the bridges that cross the Mersey to the south of the city.[376] To the south, Liverpool is connected to Widnes and Warrington via the A562 and A5300 and across the River Mersey to Runcorn in Cheshire, via the Silver Jubilee and Mersey Gateway bridges. The M56 motorway then provides routes into parts of the neighbouring counties, with connections to the Wirral and North Wales, and a direct route to Manchester Airport.[377] The Kingsway and Queensway Tunnels connect Liverpool with the settlements on the Wirral Peninsula across the Mersey to the west, including Birkenhead, and Wallasey. The A41 road and M53 motorway, which both begin in Birkenhead, link to Cheshire and Shropshire and via the A55, to North Wales.[378] Liverpool is served by two separate rail networks. The local rail network is managed and run by Merseyrail and provides links throughout the Liverpool city region and beyond (see Local travel below). The national network, which is managed by Network Rail, provides Liverpool with connections to major towns and cities across England. The city's primary main line station is Lime Street station, which is the terminus for several lines into the city. The station is served by a number of different train operating companies including Avanti West Coast, East Midlands Railway, London North Eastern Railway, Northern Rail, TransPennine Express and West Midlands Trains.[380][381] Between them, the station is connected with direct train services to numerous destinations including London (in 2 hours 8 minutes with Pendolino trains), Birmingham, Glasgow, Hull, Leeds, Manchester, Newcastle upon Tyne, Norwich, Nottingham, Preston, Scarborough, Sheffield and York.[382][383][384][385] Opened in 1836, Lime Street station is the world's oldest mainline terminus station still in use.[386] In the south of the city, Liverpool South Parkway provides a connection to the city's airport. The Port of Liverpool connects passengers and freight to Liverpool from all around the world. Passenger ferry services depart from the city across the Irish Sea to Belfast and the Isle of Man. Services are provided by several companies, including the Isle of Man Steam Packet Company, P&O Ferries and Stena Line. The Liverpool Cruise Terminal handles over 200,000 passengers and crew annually and is located alongside the Pier Head in the city centre. Berthing facilities for long-distance passenger cruises are provided and served by a large number of different cruise lines. Ports in Australia, France, Faroe Islands, Iceland, North America, Norway, Spain and the Caribbean are served by the facility.[387][388][389] The cruise lines that call at Liverpool cruise terminal include the following: As of 2022[update], the Port of Liverpool is the fourth busiest port in the UK by freight tonnage, handling 33 million tonnes of freight cargo.[409] It is the main port in the country for transatlantic trade and the largest port on the west coast of the UK. The Royal Seaforth and Liverpool2 container terminals are the port's two main terminals and handle a wide variety of cargo including containers, liquid and dry bulk cargoes such as coal and grain, biomass and roll-on/roll-off cargoes such as cars and trucks.[410][411][412][413][414][415] Leeds and Liverpool Canal runs into Liverpool city centre via Liverpool Canal Link at Pier Head since 2009.[416] Liverpool John Lennon Airport, which is located in the south of the city, provides Liverpool with direct air connections across the United Kingdom and Europe. It offers direct services to over 60 airports worldwide and to over 100 destinations via one-stop connections in Frankfurt, Dublin and Reykjavík. The airport is primarily served by low-cost airlines namely Aer Lingus, easyJet, Jet2.com, Loganair, Lufthansa, Play, Ryanair, Widerøe and Wizz Air, although it does provide facilities for private aircraft.[417][418][419][420][421] Liverpool's urban railway network, known as Merseyrail, is one of the busiest and most extensive in the country. The network provides approximately 30 million passenger journeys per year, across a system of 69 stations throughout Liverpool's metropolitan area, within the formal boundaries of the Liverpool city region and adjacent areas of Cheshire and Lancashire.[422][423][424][425] The network consists of three lines: the Northern Line, which runs to Southport, Ormskirk, Headbolt Lane and Hunts Cross; the Wirral Line, which runs through the Mersey Railway Tunnel and has branches to New Brighton, West Kirby, Chester and Ellesmere Port; and the City Line, which begins at Lime Street, providing links to St Helens, Wigan, Preston, Warrington and Manchester.[426][427] The network is predominantly electric and covers 75 miles (120 kilometres) of track.[428][429] Trains are owned and operated by the Merseyrail franchise and managed by Merseytravel under the direction of the Liverpool City Region Combined Authority. Local services on the City Line are operated by Northern rather than Merseyrail, although the line itself remains part of the Merseyrail network. Within Liverpool city centre, four stations and over 6+1⁄2 miles (10.5 kilometres) of tunnels are underground.[428] Hamilton Square and Liverpool James Street are the oldest deep level underground stations in the world.[430] In 2023, for the first time in UK history, battery-powered passenger trains launched on Merseyrail tracks from the newly opened Headbolt Lane station in Kirkby. The Liverpool City Region Combined Authority's long term \"Merseyrail for All\" plan is to reduce dependency on live third rail and promote battery power in order to further expand Merseyrail to previously inaccessible places across the city region and as far as Manchester, Wrexham, Warrington and Preston.[431][432] Local bus services within and around Liverpool are managed by Merseytravel[433] and are run by several different companies, including Arriva and Stagecoach. The two principal termini for local buses are Queen Square bus station (located near Lime Street railway station) for services north and east of the city, and Liverpool One bus station (located near the Royal Albert Dock) for services to the south and east.[434] Cross-river services to the Wirral use roadside terminus points in Castle Street and Sir Thomas Street. A night bus service also operates on Saturdays providing services from the city centre across Liverpool and wider region.[435] Tour bus services are provided by Maghull Coaches which allow tourists to hop-on-hop-off and view historical landmarks and attractions, as well as Liverpool F.C. and Beatles related locations.[436][437] National Express services operate from the Liverpool One bus station to and from destinations across the UK.[438] In 2023, the Liverpool city region confirmed plans to become the second place outside London to implement bus franchising. Local leaders have argued that it will improve services by transferring control over fares, ticketing and routes from bus companies to the Combined Authority. The full implementation of bus franchising will take place by the end of 2028.[439][440] The cross-river ferry service in Liverpool, known as the Mersey Ferry, is managed and operated by Merseytravel, with services operating between the Pier Head in Liverpool city centre and both Woodside in Birkenhead and Seacombe in Wallasey. Services operate at intervals ranging from 20 minutes, at peak times, to every hour during the middle of the day and at weekends.[441] Despite remaining an important transport link between the city and the Wirral Peninsula, the Mersey Ferry has become an increasingly popular tourist attraction within the city, with daytime River Explorer Cruises providing passengers with an historical overview of the River Mersey and surrounding areas.[442] A scooter-sharing system and electric bicycle scheme operates throughout Liverpool which allows residents and visitors to move around the city on rented scooters and bicycles. The scheme is operated by Swedish technology company Voi, and riders are able to pick up and drop off bikes and scooters at various locations around the city.[443][444][445] National Cycle Route 56, National Cycle Route 62 and National Cycle Route 810 run through Liverpool. As with other large cities, Liverpool is an important cultural centre within the United Kingdom, incorporating music, performing arts, museums and art galleries, literature and nightlife among others. In 2008, the cultural heritage of the city was celebrated with the city holding the title of European Capital of Culture, during which time a wide range of cultural celebrations took place in the city, including Go Superlambananas! and La Princesse. Liverpool has also held Europe's largest music and poetry event, the Welsh national Eisteddfod, three times, despite being in England, in 1884, 1900, and 1929. Liverpool is internationally known for music and is recognised by Guinness World Records as the \"World Capital City of Pop\".[447] Musicians from the city have produced 58 No. 1 singles, more than any other city in the world.[448] Both the most successful male band and girl group in global music history have contained Liverpudlian members. Liverpool is most famous as the birthplace of the Beatles and during the 1960s was at the forefront of the Beat Music movement, which would eventually lead to the British Invasion. Many notable musicians of the time originated in the city including Billy J. Kramer, Cilla Black, Gerry and the Pacemakers and The Searchers. The influence of musicians from Liverpool, coupled with other cultural exploits of the time, such as the Liverpool poets, prompted American poet Allen Ginsberg to proclaim that the city was \"the centre of consciousness of the human universe\".[449] Other musicians from Liverpool include Billy Fury, A Flock of Seagulls, Echo & the Bunnymen, Frankie Goes to Hollywood, Frankie Vaughan, Anathema, Ladytron, The Zutons, Cast, Atomic Kitten and Rebecca Ferguson. The La's 1990 hit single \"There She Goes\" was described by Rolling Stone as a \"founding piece of Britpop's foundation.\"[450] The city is also home to the oldest surviving professional symphony orchestra in the UK, the Royal Liverpool Philharmonic Orchestra, which is based in the Philharmonic Hall.[451] The chief conductor of the orchestra is Vasily Petrenko.[452] Sir Edward Elgar dedicated his Pomp and Circumstance March No. 1 to the Liverpool Orchestral Society, and the piece had its first performance in the city in 1901.[453] Among Liverpool's curiosities, the Austrian émigré Fritz Spiegl is notable. He not only became a world expert on the etymology of Scouse, but composed the music to Z-cars and the Radio 4 UK Theme. Well established festivals in the city include Africa Oyé and Brazilica which are the UK's largest free African and Brazilian music festivals respectively.[454][455] The dance music festival Creamfields was established by the Liverpool-based Cream clubbing brand which started life as a weekly event at Nation nightclub. There are numerous music venues located across the city, however, the Liverpool Arena is by far the largest. Opened in 2008, the 11,000-seat arena hosted the MTV Europe Music Awards the same year, and since then has played host to world-renowned acts such as Andrea Bocelli, Beyoncé, Elton John, Kanye West, Kasabian, The Killers, Lady Gaga, Oasis, Pink, Rihanna, and UB40. On 7 October 2022, the [[publisherBBCrporation and the European Broadcasting Union (EBU) announced that Liverpool would host the Eurovision Song Contest 2023 on behalf of the previous year's winning country Ukraine, which was unable to meet the demands of hosting the event due to security concerns caused by the Russian invasion of the country. The contest was held at Liverpool Arena, and consisted of two semi-finals on 9 and 11 May and a final on 13 May 2023. This was the first time that the contest took place in the city, and was also a record-extending ninth time that the UK has hosted the contest, having last done so in Birmingham in 1998.[456] Liverpool has more galleries and national museums than any other city in the United Kingdom apart from London.[12] National Museums Liverpool is the only English national collection based wholly outside London.[457] The Tate Liverpool gallery houses the modern art collection of the Tate in the North of England and was, until the opening of Tate Modern, the largest exhibition space dedicated to modern art in the United Kingdom. The FACT centre hosts touring multimedia exhibitions, while the Walker Art Gallery houses one of the most impressive permanent collections of Pre-Raphaelite art in the world.[458] Sudley House contains another major collection of pre-20th-century art.[459] Liverpool University's Victoria Building was re-opened as a public art gallery and museum to display the university's artwork and historical collections which include the largest display of art by Audubon outside the US.[460] A number of artists have also come from the city, including painter George Stubbs who was born in Liverpool in 1724. The Liverpool Biennial festival of arts runs from mid-September to late November and comprises three main sections; the International, The Independents and New Contemporaries although fringe events are timed to coincide.[461] It was during the 2004 festival that Yoko Ono's work \"My mummy was beautiful\" invited controversy when photographs of a woman's breast and crotch were exhibited on the main shopping street.[462] Felicia Hemans (née Browne) was born in Dale Street, Liverpool, in 1793, although she later moved to Flintshire, in Wales. Felicia was born in Liverpool, a granddaughter of the Venetian consul in that city. Her father's business soon brought the family to Denbighshire in North Wales, where she spent her youth. They made their home near Abergele and St. Asaph (Flintshire), and it is clear that she came to regard herself as Welsh by adoption, later referring to Wales as \"Land of my childhood, my home and my dead\". Her first poems, dedicated to the Prince of Wales, were published in Liverpool in 1808, when she was only fourteen, arousing the interest of Percy Bysshe Shelley, who briefly corresponded with her. [463] An engraving of a painting of The Wishing Gate. by S. F. Serres was published in Fisher's Drawing Room Scrap Book, 1834 with a poetical illustration by Letitia Elizabeth Landon to which she adds the note 'I believe that to this haunted gate, a common superstition is attached, namely, that to wish, and to have that wish fulfilled, is the result of such wish being uttered while passing'. It stood on the North Shore before the docks were built and was a place where farewells could be waved to departing voyagers.[464] A number of notable authors have visited Liverpool, including Daniel Defoe, Washington Irving, Charles Dickens, Thomas De Quincey, Herman Melville, Nathaniel Hawthorne, Gerard Manley Hopkins and Hugh Walpole. Defoe, after visiting the city, described it, as \"one of the wonders of Britain in his 'Tour through England and Wales'\".[465] Melville's novel Redburn deals with the first seagoing voyage of 19 years old Wellingborough Redburn between New York and Liverpool in 1839. Largely autobiographical, the middle sections of the book are set in Liverpool and describe the young merchantman's wanderings, and his reflections.[463] From 1842 to 1869, Dickens visited the city to give public readings of his novels.[466] Hawthorne was stationed in Liverpool as United States consul between 1853 and 1856.[467] Hopkins served as priest at St Francis Xavier Church, Langdale St., Liverpool, between 1879 and 81.[468] Although he is not known to have ever visited Liverpool, Jung famously had a vivid dream of the city which he analysed in one of his works.[469] Her Benny, a novel telling the tragic story of Liverpool street urchins in the 1870s, written by Methodist preacher Silas K. Hocking, was a best-seller and the first book to sell a million copies in the author's lifetime.[470] The prolific writer of adventure novels, Harold Edward Bindloss (1866–1945), was born in Liverpool. The writer, docker and political activist George Garrett was born in Seacombe, on the Wirral Peninsula in 1896 and was brought up in Liverpool's South end, around Park Road, the son of a fierce Liverpool–Irish Catholic mother and a staunch 'Orange' stevedore father. In the 1920s and 1930s, his organisation within the Seamen's Vigilance Committees, unemployed demonstrations, and hunger marches from Liverpool became part of a wider cultural force. He spoke at reconciliation meetings in sectarian Liverpool, and helped found the Unity Theatre in the 1930s as part of the Popular Front against the rise of fascism, particularly its echoes in the Spanish Civil War. Garrett died in 1966.[471] The novelist and playwright James Hanley (1897–1985) was born in Kirkdale, Liverpool, in 1897 (not Dublin, nor 1901 as he generally implied) to a working-class family.[472] Hanley grew up close to the docks and much of his early writing is about seamen. The Furys (1935) is first in a sequence of five loosely autobiographical novels about working-class life in Liverpool. James Hanley's brother, novelist Gerald Hanley (1916–92) was also born in Liverpool (not County Cork, Ireland, as he claimed).[473] While he published a number of novels he also wrote radio plays for the BBC as well as some film scripts, most notably The Blue Max (1966).[474] He was also one of several scriptwriters for a life of Gandhi (1964).[475] Novelist Beryl Bainbridge (1932–2010) was born in Liverpool and raised in nearby Formby. She was primarily known for her works of psychological fiction, often set among the English working classes. Bainbridge won the Whitbread Awards prize for best novel in 1977 and 1996 and was nominated five times for the Booker Prize. The Times newspaper named Bainbridge among their list of \"The 50 greatest British writers since 1945\".[476] J. G. Farrell was born in Liverpool in 1935 but left at the outbreak of war in 1939.[477] A novelist of Irish descent, Farrell gained prominence for his historical fiction, most notably his Empire Trilogy (Troubles, The Siege of Krishnapur and The Singapore Grip), dealing with the political and human consequences of British colonial rule. However, his career ended when he drowned in Ireland in 1979 at the age of 44. Helen Forrester was the pen name of June Bhatia (née Huband) (1919–2011),[478][479] who was known for her books about her early childhood in Liverpool during the Great Depression, including Twopence to Cross the Mersey (1974), as well as several works of fiction. During the late 1960s the city became well known for the Liverpool poets, who include Roger McGough and the late Adrian Henri. An anthology of poems, The Mersey Sound, written by Henri, McGough and Brian Patten, has sold well since it was first being published in 1967. Liverpool has produced several noted writers of horror fiction, often set on Merseyside – Ramsey Campbell, Clive Barker and Peter Atkins among them. A collection of Liverpudlian horror fiction, Spook City was edited by a Liverpool expatriate, Angus Mackenzie, and introduced by Doug Bradley, also from Liverpool.[480] Bradley is famed for portraying Barker's creation Pinhead in the Hellraiser series of films. Liverpool also has a long history of performing arts, reflected in several annual theatre festivals such as the Liverpool Shakespeare Festival, which takes place inside Liverpool Cathedral and in the adjacent historic St James' Gardens every summer; the Everyword Festival of new theatre writing, the only one of its kind in the country;[481] Physical Fest, an international festival of physical theatre;[482] the annual festivals organised by Liverpool John Moores University's drama department and the Liverpool Institute for Performing Arts; and other festivals by the large number of theatres in the city, such as the Empire, Everyman,[483][484] Playhouse,[485][486] Royal Court, and Unity theatres. Notable actors and actresses from Liverpool include Arthur Askey, Tom Baker, Kim Cattrall, Jodie Comer, Stephen Graham, Rex Harrison, Jason Isaacs, Tina Malone, the McGann brothers (Joe, Mark, Paul, and Stephen), David Morrissey, Elizabeth Morton, Peter Serafinowicz, Elisabeth Sladen, Alison Steadman, and Rita Tushingham. Actors and actresses from elsewhere in the world have strong ties to the city, such as Canadian actor Mike Myers (whose parents were both from Liverpool) and American actress Halle Berry (whose mother was from Liverpool). Liverpool has a thriving and varied nightlife. The majority of the city's late-night restaurants, bars, pubs, nightclubs, music venues and comedy clubs are located in a number of distinct districts. In 2023, figures from global data company Square show that night-time spending in bars and restaurants in Liverpool city centre outperformed all major UK cities, including London.[487] Figures by the Liverpool BID Company suggest that the busiest nights of the week in Liverpool city centre are Friday and Saturday. Using cameras to track the flow of people in key locations between 7 pm and 4 am, at least 1.5 million people pass through the city centre every Friday night and almost 2 million people on Saturday nights. The data demonstrates that Monday night is the quietest night of the week in the city centre and footfall then increases every single night to reach its peak on Saturday nights. 125,889 people worked in the city's night time economy as of 2022, according to the Liverpool BID Company.[488][489][490] Liverpool's nightlife is concentrated in a number of districts including Ropewalks which comprises Concert Square, St. Peter's Square and the adjoining Seel Street and Duke Street. Other popular areas include Hardman Street, the Cavern Quarter, Baltic Triangle, Royal Albert Dock and the city's Pride Quarter, which is home to a large number of LGBT venues.[491][492] In the city's suburbs, Lark Lane in Aigburth is noted for an abundance of bars and late-night venues.[493][494] In Liverpool primary and secondary education is available in various forms supported by the state including secular, Church of England, Jewish, and Roman Catholic. Islamic education is available at primary level, but there is no secondary provision. One of Liverpool's important early schools was The Liverpool Blue Coat School; founded in 1708 as a charitable school. It is now a state grammar school. The Liverpool Blue Coat School is the top-performing school in the city with 100% 5 or more A*-C grades at GCSE resulting in the 30th best GCSE results in the country and an average point score per student of 1087.4 in A/AS levels.[495] Other notable schools include Liverpool College founded in 1840 Merchant Taylors' School founded in 1620.[496] Another of Liverpool's notable senior schools is St. Edward's College situated in the West Derby area of the city. Historic grammar schools, such as the Liverpool Institute High School and Liverpool Collegiate School—both closed in the 1980s—are still remembered as centres of academic excellence. Bellerive Catholic College is the city's top-performing non-selective school, based upon GCSE results in 2007. Liverpool has three universities: the University of Liverpool, Liverpool John Moores University and Liverpool Hope University. Edge Hill University, founded as a teacher-training college in the Edge Hill district of Liverpool, is now located in Ormskirk in South-West Lancashire. Liverpool is also home to the Liverpool Institute for Performing Arts (LIPA). The University of Liverpool was established in 1881 as University College Liverpool. In 1884, it became part of the federal Victoria University. Following a Royal Charter and Act of Parliament in 1903, it became an independent university, the University of Liverpool, with the right to confer its own degrees. It was the first university to offer degrees in biochemistry, architecture, civic design, veterinary science, oceanography and social science. Liverpool Hope University, which was formed through the merger of three colleges, the earliest of which was founded in 1844, gained university status in 2005. It is the only ecumenical university in Europe.[497] It is situated on both sides of Taggart Avenue in Childwall and has a second campus in the city centre (the Cornerstone). The Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine, founded to address some of the problems created by trade, continues today as a post-graduate school affiliated with the University of Liverpool and houses an anti-venom repository. Liverpool John Moores University was previously a polytechnic, and gained status in 1992. It is named in honour of Sir John Moores, one of the founders of the Littlewoods football pools and retail group, who was a major benefactor. The institution was previously owned and run by Liverpool City Council. It traces it lineage to the Liverpool Mechanics' institute, opened in 1823, making it by this measure England's third-oldest university. The city has one further education college, City of Liverpool College in the city centre. Liverpool City Council operates Burton Manor, a residential adult education college in nearby Burton, on the Wirral Peninsula. There are two Jewish schools in Liverpool, both belonging to the King David Foundation. King David School, Liverpool, is the High School and the King David Primary School. There is also a King David Kindergarten, featured in the community centre of Harold House. These schools are all run by the King David Foundation located in Harold House in Childwall; conveniently next door to the Childwall Synagogue. Liverpool is one of the most successful footballing cities in England, and is home to two top flight Premier League teams. Everton F.C. was founded in 1878 and was one of the twelve founder members of the Football League. It plays at Goodison Park. Liverpool F.C. were founded in 1892 and play at Anfield. Between them, the clubs have won 28 English First Division titles, 12 FA Cup titles, 10 League Cup titles, 6 European Cup titles, 1 FIFA Club World Cup title, 1 European Cup Winners' Cup title, 3 UEFA Cup titles, and 24 FA Charity Shields. The two clubs contest the Merseyside derby, dubbed the 'friendly derby'. Despite the name the fixture is known for its keen rivalry, having seen more sending-offs in this fixture than any other. Unlike many other derbies it is not rare for families in the city to contain supporters of both clubs.[498] Liverpool F.C. is the English and British club with the most European Cup titles with six, the latest in 2019. Liverpool has played at Anfield since 1892, when the club was formed to occupy the stadium following Everton's departure due to a dispute with their landlord. Liverpool are still playing there 125 years later, although the ground has been completely rebuilt since the 1970s. The Spion Kop (rebuilt as an all-seater stand in 1994–95) was the most famous part of the ground, gaining cult status across the world due to the songs and celebrations of the many fans who packed onto its terraces. Anfield as capacity for 54,000 spectators in comfort and is a distinctive landmark in an area filled with smaller and older buildings. Liverpool club also has a multimillion-pound youth training facility called The Academy. After leaving Anfield in 1892, Everton moved to Goodison Park on the opposite side of Stanley Park. The ground was opened on 24 August 1892, by Lord Kinnaird and Frederick Wall of the FA but the first crowds to attend the ground saw a short athletics meeting followed by a selection of music and a fireworks display. Everton's first game there was on 2 September 1892 when they beat Bolton 4–2. It was one of the host venues during the 1966 FIFA World Cup. It now has the capacity for just under 40,000 spectators all-seated, but the last expansion took place in 1994 when a new Park End Stand gave the stadium an all-seater capacity. The Goodison Road Stand dates back to the 1970s, while the Gwladys Street Stand and Bullens Road Stand are refurbished pre-Second World War structures. Everton is currently in the process of relocating, with a stadium move first mooted as early as 1996.[499] In 2003, the club were forced to abandon plans for a 55,000-seat stadium at King's Dock due to financial constraints,[500] with further proposed moves to Kirkby (comprising part of Destination Kirkby, moving the stadium just beyond Liverpool's council boundary into Kirkby) and Walton Hall Park similarly scrapped. The club will relocate to the multimillion-pound Everton Stadium designed by the American architect Dan Meis at the nearby Bramley-Moore Dock on the River Mersey waterfront during the 2024/25 season, with ground broken on the project in August 2021.[501] The new stadium will have a capacity of 52,888 which could be expanded to 62,000 demand permitting and it will be a host venue for the UEFA Euro 2028. Everton also have a multimillion-pound training facility based at Finch Farm. The Everton Women's Team play in the Women's Super League at the Walton Hall Park Stadium. Boxing is massively popular in Liverpool. The city has a proud heritage and history in the sport and is home to around 22 amateur boxing clubs, which are responsible for producing many successful boxers, such as Nel Tarleton, Alan Rudkin, John Conteh, Andy Holligan, Liam Smith, Paul Hodkinson, Tony Bellew and Robin Ried. The city also boasts a consistently strong amateur contingent which is highlighted by Liverpool being the most represented city on the GB Boxing team, as well as at the 2012 London Olympics, the most notable Liverpool amateur fighters include; Jimmy Lloyd, George Turpin, Tony Willis, Robin Reid and David Price who have all medalled at the Olympic Games. Boxing events are usually hosted at the Echo Arena and Liverpool Olympia within the city, although the former home of Liverpool boxing was the renowned Liverpool Stadium. Aintree Racecourse in the adjacent Metropolitan Borough of Sefton is home to the world's most famous steeple-chase, the Randox Grand National which takes place annually in early April. The race meeting attracts horse owners/ jockeys from around the world to compete in the demanding 4-mile (6.5-kilometre) and 30-fence course. There have been many memorable moments of the Grand National, for instance, the 100/1 outsider Foinavon in 1967, the dominant Red Rum and Ginger McCain of the 1970s and Mon Mome (100/1) who won the 2009 meeting. In 2010, the National became the first horse race to be televised in high-definition in the UK. The Royal Liverpool Golf Club, situated in the nearby town of Hoylake on the Wirral Peninsula, has hosted The Open Championship on a number of occasions, most recently in 2023. It also hosted the Walker Cup in 1983. Liverpool once contained four greyhound tracks, Seaforth Greyhound Stadium (1933–1965), Breck Park Stadium (1927–1948), Stanley Greyhound Stadium (1927–1961) and White City Stadium (1932–1973). Breck Park also hosted boxing bouts and both Stanley and Seaforth hosted Motorcycle speedway. Wavertree Sports Park is home to the Liverpool Harriers athletics club, which has produced such athletes as Curtis Robb, Allyn Condon (the only British athlete to compete at both the Summer and Winter Olympics), and Katarina Johnson-Thompson; Great Britain was represented by Johnson-Thompson at the 2012 London Olympics in the women's heptathlon, and she would go on to win the gold medal at the 2019 World Championships, giving Liverpool its first gold medal and breaking the British record in the process. In August 2012, Liverpool gymnast Beth Tweddle won an Olympic bronze medal in London 2012 in the uneven bars at her third Olympic Games, thus becoming the most decorated British gymnast in history. Park Road Gymnastics Centre provides training to a high level. Liverpool has produced several swimmers who have represented their nation at major championships such as the Olympic Games. The most notable of which is Steve Parry who claimed a bronze medal at the 2004 Athens Olympics in the 200m butterfly. Others include Herbert Nickel Haresnape, Margaret Kelly, Shellagh Ratcliffe and Austin Rawlinson. There is a purpose-built aquatics centre at Wavertree Sports Park, which opened in 2008. The City of Liverpool Swimming Club has been National Speedo League Champions 8 out of the last 11 years. The city is the hub of the Liverpool and District Cricket Competition, an ECB Premier League.[502] Sefton Park and Liverpool are the league's founder members based in the city with Wavertree, Alder and Old Xaverians clubs having joined the league more recently.[503] Liverpool plays host Lancashire County Cricket Club as an outground most seasons, including six of eight home County Championship games during Lancashire's 2011[504] title winning campaign[505] while Old Trafford was refurbished.[506][507] Since 2014 Liverpool Cricket Club has played host[508] to the annual Tradition-ICAP Liverpool International tennis tournament, which has seen tennis stars such as Novak Djokovic, David Ferrer, Mardy Fish, Laura Robson and Caroline Wozniacki. Previously this had been held at Calderstones Park, situated in Allerton in the south of the city. Liverpool Tennis Development Programme at Wavertree Tennis Centre is one of the largest in the UK. Professional basketball came to the city in 2007 with the entry of Everton Tigers, later known as Mersey Tigers, into the elite British Basketball League. The club was originally associated with Everton F.C., and was part of the Toxteth Tigers youth development programme, which reached over 1,500 young people every year.[509] The Tigers began to play in Britain's top league for the 2007–08 season, playing at the Greenbank Sports Academy before moving into the newly completed Echo Arena during that season. After the 2009–10 season, Everton F.C. withdrew funding from the Tigers, who then changed their name to Mersey Tigers. The club were expelled from the British Basketball League in 2013 due to financial problems.[510] Liverpool is one of three cities which still host the traditional sport of British baseball and it hosts the annual England-Wales international match every two years, alternating with Cardiff and Newport. Liverpool Trojans are the oldest existing baseball club in the UK. The 2014 Tour of Britain cycle race began in Liverpool on 7 September, using a city centre circuit to complete 130 km (80.8 mi) of racing.[511] The Tour of Britain took nine stages and finished in London on 14 September. A 2016 study of UK fitness centres found that, of the top 20 UK urban areas, Liverpool had the highest number of leisure and sports centres per capita, with 4.3 centres per 100,000 of the city population.[512] The city has one daily newspaper: the Echo, published by Reach plc. The Liverpool Daily Post was also published until 2013. The UK's first online only weekly newspaper called Southport Reporter (Southport and Mersey Reporter), is also one of the many other news outlets that cover the city. The independent media organisation The Post[513] also covers Liverpool, while Nerve magazine publishes articles and reviews of cultural events. Liverpool TV is a local television station serving Liverpool City Region and surrounding areas. The station is owned and operated by Made Television Ltd and forms part of a group of eight local TV stations. It broadcasts from studios and offices in Liverpool. The ITV region which covers Liverpool is ITV Granada. In 2006, the Television company opened a new newsroom in the Royal Liver Building. Granada's regional news broadcasts were produced at the Royal Albert Dock News Centre during the 1980s and 1990s.[514] The BBC also opened a new newsroom on Hanover Street in 2006. ITV's daily magazine programme This Morning was broadcast from studios at Royal Albert Dock until 1996, when production was moved to London. Granada's short-lived shopping channel \"Shop!\" was also produced in Liverpool until it was cancelled in 2002.[515] Liverpool is the home of the TV production company Lime Pictures, formerly Mersey Television, which produced the now-defunct soap operas Brookside and Grange Hill.

                "title": "Scouse - Wikipedia",
                "content": "Scouse (/skaʊs/ skowss), more formally known as Liverpool English[2] or Merseyside English,[3][4][5] is an accent and dialect of English associated with the city of Liverpool and the surrounding Liverpool City Region. The Scouse accent is highly distinctive as it was influenced heavily by Irish and Welsh immigrants who arrived via the Liverpool docks, as well as Scandinavian sailors who also used the docks,[6] and thus has very little in common with the accents found throughout the rest of England.[7] People from Liverpool are known as Liverpudlians, but are usually called Scousers; the name comes from scouse, a stew originating from Scandinavian lobscouse eaten by sailors and locals.[8][9][10][11] The development of Liverpool since the 1950s has spread the accent into nearby areas such as the towns of Runcorn and Skelmersdale.[12] Variations within Scouse have been noted: the accent of Liverpool's city centre and northern neighbourhoods is usually described as fast, harsh, and nasal,[13] while the \"Beatles-like\" accent found in the southern suburbs of Liverpool is typically referred to as slow, soft, and dark.[14] Popular colloquialisms have shown a growing deviation from the historical Lancashire dialect that was previously found in Liverpool,[12] as well as a growth in the influence of the accent in the wider area.[7][15][16][17][18] Scouse is often considered by other Britons to be one of the country's least popular accents due to its difficulty, but it conversely also performs very well in polls of British accents that people perceive as happy and friendly.[19] The word scouse is a shortened form of lobscouse, the origin of which is uncertain.[20] It is related to the Norwegian lapskaus, Swedish lapskojs, and Danish labskovs (skipperlabskovs), as well as the Low German labskaus and refers to a stew of the same name commonly eaten by sailors. In the 19th century, poorer people in Liverpool, Birkenhead, Bootle and Wallasey commonly ate scouse as it was a cheap dish and familiar to the families of seafarers. Outsiders tended to call these people \"scousers\".[21] In The Lancashire Dictionary of Dialect, Tradition and Folklore, Alan Crosby suggested that the word only became known nationwide with the popularity of the BBC sitcom Till Death Us Do Part (1965–1975), which featured a Liverpudlian socialist and a Cockney conservative in a regular argument.[10] Originally a small fishing village, Liverpool developed as a port. After the 1700s, it developed into a major international trading and industrial centre. The city consequently became a melting pot of several accents and dialects as sailors and traders from different areas (specifically Wales and Ireland) established themselves in the area. Until the mid-19th century, the dominant local accent was similar to that of neighbouring areas of Lancashire. For instance, the comedian and actor Robb Wilton (1881–1957), despite coming from the Everton district of Liverpool, spoke with a dry Lancashire accent rather than a Scouse accent.[22][better source needed] The influence of immigrants from Ireland (especially Dublin) and Northern Wales, as well as visiting Scandinavian sailors, contributed to a distinctive local Liverpool accent.[23][24] The first reference to a distinctive Liverpool accent was in 1890. Linguist Gerald Knowles suggested that the accent's nasal quality may have derived from poor public health in the 19th century, by which the prevalence of colds among many people over a long time resulted in a nasal accent coming to be regarded as the norm and copied by newer incomers learning the dialect of the local area.[25] Scousers tend to speak at a higher pitch than most other English speakers, sometimes approaching falsetto. The Victorian phonetician Alexander John Ellis said that Liverpool and Birkenhead \"had no dialect proper\", as he conceived of dialects as speech that had been passed down through generations from the earliest English speakers. Ellis did research some locations on the Wirral, but these respondents spoke in the traditional Cheshire dialect at the time and not in Scouse.[26] The 1950s Survey of English Dialects recorded traditional Lancastrian dialect from the town of Halewood, finding no trace of Scouse influence. The phonetician John C. Wells wrote that \"the Scouse accent might as well not exist\" in The Linguistic Atlas of England, which was the Survey's principal output.[27] An academic study of Scouse was undertaken by Gerald Knowles at the University of Leeds in 1973. He identified a key problem: that traditional dialect research had focused on developments from a single proto-language, but Scouse (and many other urban dialects) had resulted from interactions between an unknown number of languages.[28] The phonemic notation used in this article is based on the set of symbols used by Watson (2007). Scouse is highly distinguishable from other English dialects. Because of this international recognition, Keith Szlamp made a request to IANA on 16 September 1996 to make it a recognised Internet dialect.[47] After citing a number of references,[48][49][50][51][11] the application was accepted on 25 May 2000 and now allows Internet documents that use the dialect to be categorised as Scouse by using the language tag \"en-Scouse\". Scouse has also become well-known globally as the accent of the Beatles.[52] While the members of the band are famously from Liverpool,[53] their accents have more in common with the older Lancashire-like Liverpool dialect found in the southern suburbs; the accent has evolved into Scouse since the 1960s. Other northern English dialects include:",

Liverpool, a city and seaport in northwestern England, forms an irregular crescent along the north shore of the Mersey estuary a few miles from the Irish Sea. It is the nucleus of the metropolitan county of Merseyside in the historic county of Lancashire. The location that became the city of Liverpool was granted a charter for a planned new town by King John of England in 1207. In 1830 the Liverpool and Manchester Railway, the first in England to link two major cities, was opened. A rail network providing easy and cheap access to all major British industrial centers was soon created. All four of the Beatles—John Lennon, Paul McCartney, George Harrison, and Ringo Starr—were born and started their musical careers in Liverpool. Liverpool, city and seaport, northwestern England, forming the nucleus of the metropolitan county of Merseyside in the historic county of Lancashire. The city proper, which is a metropolitan borough of Merseyside, forms an irregular crescent along the north shore of the Mersey estuary a few miles from the Irish Sea. The first significant date in the history of Liverpool is 1207, when King John of England granted a charter for a planned new town there. The town’s medieval growth was slow, but in the 18th century it expanded rapidly as a result of profitable trade with the Americas and the West Indies and became the second most important port in Britain. A major element in the general trading pattern was the Liverpool Triangle—the exchange of manufactured goods from the Mersey hinterland for slaves in West Africa who were in turn traded for sugar, molasses, spices, and other plantation crops in the West Indies. The first dock in Liverpool was built in 1715. By the end of the century, four other docks had been established along the Mersey, so that the port outranked even London in dock space. In 1830 the Liverpool and Manchester Railway, the first in England to link two major cities, was opened. A rail network providing easy and cheap access to all major British industrial centres was soon created, and steam ferry links between Liverpool and the Wirral, across the Mersey estuary, were established. This growth was accompanied by high levels of immigration from surrounding areas and from Ireland, especially during and after the Irish Potato Famine (1845–49). By the beginning of the 20th century, Liverpool had become the centre of 7 miles (11 km) of docks extending along the Mersey from Hornby (1884) in the north to Herculaneum (1866) in the south. Additional improvements were made to the docks, but after World War II Liverpool declined as an exporting and passenger port. That change can be attributed mainly to the decreasing significance, in the economic life of Britain, of Liverpool’s industrial hinterland and its traditional trade with the United States and West Africa. Low capital investment and unemployment in the docks intensified the situation. Liverpool continues to exert a great degree of dominance over the surrounding metropolitan region. Although the traditional activities of transport, communication, distribution, and shipping have declined, they are still important in the economic life of the city. The port, in addition to handling general cargo, has developed as a major facility for containerized shipping, and in 2012 it became a terminus for cruise ships. The docklands and several areas of the historic centre of the city collectively were named a UNESCO World Heritage site in 2004. However, that designation was rescinded in 2021 because of developments that have caused “the irreversible loss of attributes.” Paramount among Liverpool’s important contributions to 20th-century popular culture were the Beatles, who emerged from the Cavern (a nightclub that was part of the city’s musical scene in the 1960s) to become the world’s best-known rock group. Local “performance” poets such as Roger McGough, Adrian Henri, and Brian Patten helped popularize poetry in the 1960s. And from the heyday of the music hall to the radio comedy of Tommy Handley in the 1940s, Liverpudlians contributed to the British comedy tradition. Tourism has grown in importance and includes a rise in interest for visiting locations associated with the Beatles. Architectural landmarks include the 18th-century Town Hall and the 19th-century St. George’s Hall; the Neo-Gothic Anglican cathedral, founded in 1904 and completed in 1978; and the Roman Catholic Metropolitan Cathedral (1967), of strikingly modern design. Tate Liverpool (a branch of the national Tate galleries), Merseyside County Museum and Library, the Walker Art Gallery, the Picton Library, the International Slave Museum, and the University of Liverpool (chartered 1881) are among the many cultural institutions.

                "content": "Manmohan Singh[a] (26 September 1932 – 26 December 2024) was an Indian politician, economist, academic, and bureaucrat, who served as the 13th prime minister of India from 2004 to 2014. He was the fourth longest-serving prime minister after Jawaharlal Nehru, Indira Gandhi and Narendra Modi.[1] A member of the Indian National Congress, Singh was the first Sikh prime minister of India.[2] He was also the first prime minister since Nehru to be re-elected after completing a full five-year term.[3][4] Born in Gah in what is today Pakistan, Singh's family migrated to India during its partition in 1947. After obtaining his doctorate in economics from the University of Oxford, Singh worked for the United Nations during 1966–1969. He subsequently began his bureaucratic career when Lalit Narayan Mishra hired him as an advisor in the Ministry of Commerce and Industry. During the 1970s and 1980s, Singh held several key posts in the Government of India, such as Chief Economic Advisor (1972–1976), governor of the Reserve Bank (1982–1985) and head of the Planning Commission (1985–1987). In 1991, as India faced a severe economic crisis, the newly elected prime minister, P. V. Narasimha Rao, inducted the apolitical Singh into his cabinet as finance minister. Over the next few years, despite strong opposition, he carried out several structural reforms that liberalised India's economy. Although these measures proved successful in averting the crisis, and enhanced Singh's reputation globally as a leading reform-minded economist, the incumbent Congress Party fared poorly in the 1996 general election. Subsequently, Singh was leader of the opposition in the Rajya Sabha (the upper house of the Parliament of India) during the Atal Bihari Vajpayee government of 1998–2004. In 2004, when the Congress-led United Progressive Alliance came to power, its chairperson Sonia Gandhi unexpectedly relinquished the prime ministership to Singh. His first ministry executed several key legislations and projects, including the National Rural Health Mission, Unique Identification Authority, Rural Employment Guarantee scheme and Right to Information Act. In 2008, opposition to a historic civil nuclear agreement with the United States nearly caused Singh's government to fall after Left Front parties withdrew their support.[5] In 2009, BRICS was established with India as one of the founding members.[6] India's economy grew rapidly during his term.[7][8] The 2009 general election saw the UPA return with an increased mandate, with Singh retaining the office of prime minister. After his term ended, he opted out from the race for the office of prime minister during the 2014 Indian general election.[9] Singh was never a member of the Lok Sabha but served as a member of the Rajya Sabha, representing the state of Assam from 1991 to 2019 and Rajasthan from 2019 to 2024.[10][11] Singh was born to Gurmukh Singh Kohli and Amrit Kaur on 26 September 1932, in Gah, Punjab, British India, into a family of Punjabi Sikh traders of Khatri background.[12][13] His mother died when he was very young.[14][15] His paternal grandmother Jamna Devi raised him, and he was very close to her.[12][15] His early schooling was in Urdu medium until the age of 10, after which he was enrolled in an upper-primary school in Peshawar.[12][16] Even as prime minister years later, Singh wrote his apparently Hindi speeches in the Urdu script, although sometimes he would also use Gurmukhi, a script used to write Punjabi, his mother tongue.[17] After the Partition of India, his family migrated to Haldwani, India.[14] In 1948 they relocated to Amritsar, where he studied at Hindu College, Amritsar.[14][18] He attended Panjab University, then in Hoshiarpur,[19][20][21] Punjab, studying Economics and got his bachelor's and master's degrees in 1952 and 1954, respectively, standing first throughout his academic career. He completed his Economics Tripos at University of Cambridge in 1957. He was a member of St John's College.[22] In a 2005 interview with the British journalist Mark Tully, Singh said about his Cambridge days: I first became conscious of the creative role of politics in shaping human affairs, and I owe that mostly to my teachers Joan Robinson and Nicholas Kaldor. Joan Robinson was a brilliant teacher, but she also sought to awaken the inner conscience of her students in a manner that very few others were able to achieve. She questioned me a great deal and made me think the unthinkable. She propounded the left wing interpretation of Keynes, maintaining that the state has to play more of a role if you really want to combine development with social equity. Kaldor influenced me even more; I found him pragmatic, scintillating, stimulating. Joan Robinson was a great admirer of what was going on in China, but Kaldor used the Keynesian analysis to demonstrate that capitalism could be made to work.[23] After Cambridge, Singh returned to India and served as a teacher at Panjab University.[24] In 1960, he went to the University of Oxford for his DPhil, where he was a member of Nuffield College. His 1962 doctoral thesis under the supervision of Ian Little was titled \"India's export performance, 1951–1960, export prospects and policy implications\", and was later the basis for his book \"India's Export Trends and Prospects for Self-Sustained Growth\".[25] Premiership Budgets After completing his D.Phil., Singh returned to India. He was a senior lecturer of economics at Panjab University from 1957 to 1959. During 1959 and 1963, he served as a reader in economics at Panjab University, and from 1963 to 1965, he was an economics professor there.[26] Then he went to work for the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) from 1966 to 1969.[22] Later, he was appointed as an advisor to the Ministry of Foreign Trade by Lalit Narayan Mishra, in recognition of Singh's talent as an economist.[27] From 1969 to 1971, Singh was a professor of international trade at the Delhi School of Economics, University of Delhi.[22][28] In 1972, Singh was chief economic adviser in the Ministry of Finance, and in 1976 he was secretary in the Finance Ministry.[22] In 1980–1982 he was at the Planning Commission, and in 1982, he was appointed governor of the Reserve Bank of India under then finance minister Pranab Mukherjee and held the post until 1985.[22] He went on to become the deputy chairman of the Planning Commission (India) from 1985 to 1987.[13] Following his tenure at the Planning Commission, he was secretary general of the South Commission, an independent economic policy think tank headquartered in Geneva, Switzerland from 1987 to November 1990.[29] Singh returned to India from Geneva in November 1990 and held the post as the advisor to Prime Minister of India on economic affairs during the tenure of Chandra Shekar.[22] In March 1991, he became chairman of the University Grants Commission.[22] In June 1991, India's prime minister at the time, P. V. Narasimha Rao, chose Singh to be his finance minister. Singh told Mark Tully, a British journalist, in 2005: On the day (Rao) was formulating his cabinet, he sent his Principal Secretary to me saying, \"The PM would like you to become the Minister of Finance\". I didn't take it seriously. He eventually tracked me down the next morning, rather angry, and demanded that I get dressed up and come to Rashtrapati Bhavan for the swearing in. So that's how I started in politics[.][24] In 1991, India's fiscal deficit was close to 8.5 per cent of the gross domestic product, the balance of payments deficit was huge and the current account deficit was close to 3.5 per cent of India's GDP.[30] India's foreign reserves barely amounted to US$1 billion, enough to pay for 2 weeks of imports,[31] in comparison to US$600 billion in 2009.[32] Singh explained to the PM and the party that India is facing an unprecedented crisis.[31] However the rank and file of the party resisted deregulation.[31] So P. Chidambaram and Singh explained to the party that the economy would collapse if it was not deregulated.[31] To the dismay of the party, Rao allowed Singh to deregulate the Indian economy.[31] Subsequently, Singh, who had thus far been one of the most influential architects of India's socialist economy, eliminated the permit raj,[31] reduced state control of the economy, and reduced import taxes[30][33] Rao and Singh thus implemented policies to open up the economy and change India's socialist economy to a more capitalistic one, in the process dismantling the License Raj, a system that inhibited the prosperity of private businesses. They removed many obstacles standing in the way of Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) and initiated the process of the privatisation of public sector companies. However, in spite of these reforms, Rao's government was voted out in 1996 due to non-performance of government in other areas. In praise of Singh's work that pushed India towards a market economy, long-time Cabinet minister P. Chidambaram has compared Singh's role in India's reforms to Deng Xiaoping's in China.[34] In 1993, Singh offered his resignation from the post of Finance Minister after a parliamentary investigation report criticised his ministry for not being able to anticipate a US$1.8 billion 1992 securities scandal. Prime Minister Rao refused Singh's resignation, instead promising to punish the individuals directly accused in the report.[35] Singh was first elected to the upper house of Parliament, the Rajya Sabha, in 1991[36] by the legislature of the state of Assam, and was re-elected in 1995, 2001, 2007[13] and 2013.[37] From 1998 to 2004, while the Bharatiya Janata Party was in power, Singh was the Leader of the Opposition in the Rajya Sabha. In 1999, he contested for the Lok Sabha from South Delhi but was unable to win the seat.[38] After the 2004 general elections, the Indian National Congress ended the incumbent National Democratic Alliance (NDA) tenure by becoming the political party with the single largest number of seats in the Lok Sabha. It formed United Progressive Alliance (UPA) with allies and staked claim to form government. In a surprise move, Chairperson Sonia Gandhi declared Manmohan Singh, a technocrat, as the UPA candidate for the prime ministership. Despite the fact that Singh had never won a direct popular election, according to the BBC, he \"enjoyed massive popular support, not least because he was seen by many as a clean politician untouched by the taint of corruption that has run through many Indian administrations.\"[39] He took the oath as the Prime Minister of India on 22 May 2004.[40][41] In 1991, Singh, as Finance Minister, abolished the Licence Raj, source of slow economic growth and corruption in the Indian economy for decades. He liberalised the Indian economy, allowing it to speed up development dramatically. During his term as prime minister, Singh continued to encourage growth in the Indian market, enjoying widespread success in these matters. Singh, along with his finance minister, P. Chidambaram, presided over a period where the Indian economy grew with an 8–9% economic growth rate. In 2007, India achieved its highest GDP growth rate of 9% and became the second fastest growing major economy in the world.[42][43] Singh's ministry enacted a National Employment Guarantee Act (MGNREGA) in 2005.[44] Singh's government continued the Golden Quadrilateral and the highway modernisation program that was initiated by Vajpayee's government.[45] Singh also worked on reforming the banking and financial sectors, as well as public sector companies.[46] The Finance ministry worked towards relieving farmers of their debt and worked towards pro-industry policies.[47] In 2005, Singh's government introduced the value added tax, replacing sales tax. In 2007 and early 2008, the global problem of inflation impacted India.[48] In 2005, Prime Minister Singh and his government's health ministry started the National Rural Health Mission (NHRM), which mobilised half a million community health workers. This rural health initiative was praised by the American economist Jeffrey Sachs.[49] In 2006, his Government implemented the proposal to reserve 27% of seats in All India Institute of Medical Studies (AIIMS), Indian Institutes of Technology (IITs), the Indian Institutes of Management (IIMs) and other central institutions of higher education for Other Backward Classes which led to 2006 Indian anti-reservation protests.[50][51][52] On 2 July 2009, Singh ministry introduced the Right to Education Act (RTE) act. Eight IITs were opened in the states of Andhra Pradesh, Bihar, Gujarat, Orissa, Punjab, Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan and Himachal Pradesh.[53] The Singh government also continued the Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan program. The program includes the introduction and improvement of mid-day meals and the opening of schools all over India, especially in rural areas, to fight illiteracy.[54] Singh's government strengthened anti-terror laws with amendments to Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act (UAPA). National Investigation Agency (NIA) was also created soon after the 2008 Mumbai terror attacks, as need for a central agency to combat terrorism was realised.[55] Also, Unique Identification Authority of India was established in February 2009, an agency responsible for implementing the envisioned Multipurpose National Identity Card with the objective of increasing national security and facilitating e-governance.[56] Singh's administration initiated a massive reconstruction effort in Kashmir to stabilise the region but after some period of success, insurgent infiltration and terrorism in Kashmir has increased since 2009.[57] The Singh administration was, however, successful in reducing terrorism in Northeast India.[57] The important National Rural Employment Guarantee Act (NREGA) and the Right to Information Act were passed by the Parliament in 2005 during his tenure. While the effectiveness of the NREGA has been successful at various degrees, in various regions, the RTI act has proved crucial in India's fight against corruption.[58] New cash benefits were also introduced for widows, pregnant women, and landless persons.[59][60] The Right to Fair Compensation and Transparency in Land Acquisition, Rehabilitation and Resettlement Act, 2013 was passed on 29 August 2013 in the Lok Sabha (lower house of the Indian parliament) and on 4 September 2013 in Rajya Sabha (upper house of the Indian parliament). The bill received the assent of the President of India, Pranab Mukherjee on 27 September 2013.[61] The Act came into force from 1 January 2014.[62][63][64] Right of Children to Free and Compulsory Education Act was enacted on 4 August 2009, which describes the modalities of the importance of free and compulsory education for children between 6 and 14 in India under Article 21A of the Indian Constitution.[65] India became one of 135 countries to make education a fundamental right of every child when the act came into force on 1 April 2010.[66][67][68] Manmohan Singh continued the pragmatic foreign policy that was started by P.V. Narasimha Rao and continued by Bharatiya Janata Party's Atal Bihari Vajpayee. Singh continued the peace process with Pakistan initiated by his predecessor, Atal Bihari Vajpayee. Exchange of high-level visits by top leaders from both countries have highlighted his tenure. Efforts have been made during Singh's tenure to end the border dispute with People's Republic of China. In November 2006, Chinese President Hu Jintao visited India which was followed by Singh's visit to Beijing in January 2008. A major development in Sino-Indian relations was the reopening of the Nathula Pass in 2006 after being closed for more than four decades.[69] Premier of the State Council of the People's Republic of China, Li Keqiang paid a state visit to India (Delhi-Mumbai) from 19 to 21 May 2013.[69] Singh paid an official visit to China from 22 to 24 October 2013.[69] Three agreements were signed establishing sister-city partnership between Delhi-Beijing, Kolkata-Kunming and Bangalore-Chengdu. As of 2010, the People's Republic of China was the second biggest trade partner of India.[70] Relations with Afghanistan have improved considerably, with India now becoming the largest regional donor to Afghanistan.[71] During Afghan President Hamid Karzai's visit to New Delhi in August 2008, Manmohan Singh increased the aid package to Afghanistan for the development of more schools, health clinics, infrastructure, and defence.[72] Under the leadership of Singh, India emerged as one of the single largest aid donors to Afghanistan.[72] Singh's government worked towards stronger ties with the United States. He visited the United States in July 2005 initiating negotiations over the Indo-US civilian nuclear agreement. This was followed by George W. Bush's successful visit to India in March 2006, during which the declaration over the nuclear agreement was made, giving India access to American nuclear fuel and technology while India will have to allow IAEA inspection of its civil nuclear reactors. After more than two years for more negotiations, followed by approval from the IAEA, Nuclear Suppliers Group and the US Congress, India and the US signed the agreement on 10 October 2008 with Pranab Mukherjee representing India.[73] Singh had the first official state visit to the White House during the administration of US President Barack Obama. The visit took place in November 2009, and several discussions took place, including on trade and nuclear power.[74] Relations have improved with Japan and European Union countries, like the United Kingdom, France, and Germany. Relations with Iran have continued and negotiations over the Iran-Pakistan-India gas pipeline have taken place. New Delhi hosted an India–Africa Summit in April 2006 which was attended by the leaders of 15 African states.[75] Relations have improved with other developing countries, particularly Brazil and South Africa. Singh carried forward the momentum which was established after the \"Brasilia Declaration\" in 2003 and the IBSA Dialogue Forum was formed.[76] Singh's government has also been especially keen on expanding ties with Israel. Since 2003, the two countries have made significant investments in each other[77] and Israel now rivals Russia to become India's largest defence partner.[78] Though there have been a few diplomatic glitches between India and Russia, especially over the delay and price hike of several Russian weapons to be delivered to India,[79] relations between the two remained strong with India and Russia signing various agreements to increase defence, nuclear energy and space co-operation.[80] During the Libyan Civil War, India abstained from voting on the UN Security Council's Resolutions 1970 and 1973 that authorised NATO action in Libya.[81] In Lok Sabha, resolution was uniamously adopted to condemn NATO's military intervention in Libya.[82] In 2009, Singh was among the leaders who laid the foundation of the BRICS. The establishment of the group is often described as a display of emergent economic power.[6] Singh criticised the West for the use of force to enforce regime change in Syria and Libya during his speech at the UN in September 2011.[83] India was silent over the killing of Gaddafi.[84][85] Although India was among the last few countries to recognise the Libyan National Transitional Council, it agreed to work with the Council to help rebuild Libya.[86] India resent an ambassador to Tripoli in July 2012 having shut its mission in Tripoli in 2011.[87] India held general elections to the 15th Lok Sabha in five phases between 16 April 2009 and 13 May 2009. The results of the election were announced on 16 May 2009.[88] Strong showing in Andhra Pradesh, Rajasthan, Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu, Kerala, West Bengal and Uttar Pradesh helped the United Progressive Alliance (UPA) form the new government under the incumbent Singh, who became the first prime minister since Jawaharlal Nehru in 1962 to win re-election after completing a full five-year term.[89] The Congress and its allies were able to put together a comfortable majority with support from 322 members out of 543 members of the House. These included those of the UPA and the external support from the Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP), Samajwadi Party (SP), Janata Dal (Secular) (JD(S)), Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) and other minor parties.[90] On 22 May 2009, Manmohan Singh was sworn in as the prime minister during a ceremony held at Rashtrapati Bhavan.[91][92] The 2012 report filed by the CAG in Parliament of India states that due to the allocation of coal blocks to certain private companies without bidding process the nation suffered an estimated loss of Rs 1.85 trillion (short scale) between 2005 and 2009 in which Manmohan Singh was the coal minister of India.[93][94] Manmohan Singh declined to appear before a Joint Parliamentary Committee (JPC) in April 2013 when called upon by one of the members of JPC Yashwant Sinha for his alleged involvement in the 2G case.[95] Singh's premiership officially ended at noon on 17 May 2014. He did not contest the 2014 general election for the 16th Lok Sabha as the prime ministerial candidate. He resigned his post as prime minister after the Bharatiya Janata Party-led National Democratic Alliance won the election. He served as the acting prime minister till 26 May 2014, when Narendra Modi was sworn in as the new prime minister.[96][97] Singh, along with Congress president Sonia Gandhi, former Presidents A. P. J. Abdul Kalam and Pratibha Patil, and Vice President Hamid Ansari attended Modi's swearing-in ceremony.[98] In 2016, it was announced that Singh was to take up a position at Panjab University as the Jawaharlal Nehru Chair, which he eventually did not.[99] Singh retired from the Rajya Sabha in April 2024 and was succeeded by Sonia Gandhi.[100] The Independent described Singh as \"one of the world's most revered leaders\" and \"a man of uncommon decency and grace\", noting that he drives a Maruti 800, one of the humblest cars in the Indian market. Khushwant Singh lauded Singh as the best prime minister India has had, even rating him higher than Jawaharlal Nehru. He mentions an incident in his book Absolute Khushwant: The Low-Down on Life, Death and Most things In-between where after losing the 1999 Lok Sabha elections, Singh immediately returned the ₹2 lakh (US$2,400) he had borrowed from the writer for hiring taxis. Terming him as the best example of integrity, Khushwant Singh stated, \"When people talk of integrity, I say the best example is the man who occupies the country's highest office.\"[101] In 2010, Newsweek magazine recognised him as a world leader who is respected by other heads of state, describing him as \"the leader other leaders love.\" The article quoted Mohamed ElBaradei, who remarked that Singh is \"the model of what a political leader should be.\"[102] Singh also received the World Statesman Award in 2010. Henry Kissinger described Singh as \"a statesman with vision, persistence and integrity\", and praised him for his \"leadership, which has been instrumental in the economic transformation underway in India.\"[103] Singh was ranked 18 on the 2010 Forbes list of the World's Most Powerful People.[104] Forbes magazine described Singh as being \"universally praised as India's best prime minister since Nehru\".[105] Australian journalist Greg Sheridan praised Singh \"as one of the greatest statesmen in Asian history.\"[106] Singh was later ranked 19 and 28 in 2012 and 2013 in the Forbes list.[107][108][109] Time magazine described Singh as \"guiding India into the ranks of the great powers\".[110] Conversely, Time magazine's Asia edition for 10–17 July 2012, on its cover remarked that Singh was an \"underachiever\".[111] It stated that Singh appears \"unwilling to stick his neck out\" on reforms that will put the country back onto a growth path. Congress spokesperson Manish Tewari rebutted the charges. UPA ally Lalu Prasad Yadav took issue with the magazine's statements. Praising the government, Prasad said UPA projects [were] doing well and asked, \"What will America say as their own economy is shattered?\".[112] Additionally, Singh faced negative reception following the 2008 Mumbai attacks for falling short on enhancing national security. [113] In his 2020 memoir A Promised Land, former U.S. President Barack Obama called Singh \"Wise, thoughtful, and scrupulously honest\".[114] Political opponents, including BJP co-founder L. K. Advani, have claimed that Singh is a \"weak\" prime minister. Advani declared \"He is weak. What do I call a person who can't take his decisions until 10 Janpath gives instruction.\"[115][116][117] Arvind Kejriwal in 2018 said the people are \"missing an educated PM like Dr Manmohan Singh\".[118] In 2022, Union Transport Minister of Modi Government, Nitin Gadkari said the \"country is indebted to Manmohan Singh for the liberalisation that gave a new direction\".[119] In 2013, BJP leader Narendra Modi had termed Singh as \"night watchman\" and a \"puppet of the Gandhi family\".[120] On 8 February 2024, Modi praised Manmohan Singh stating,[121] Ideological differences are short lived, but the way Manmohan Singh has guided this House and the country for such a long period, he will be remembered for his contributions during every discussion on our democracy. Modi also recalled when Singh arrived at the Parliament in a wheelchair to cast his vote over a key legislation.[121] Singh married Gursharan Kaur in 1958. They had three daughters, Upinder Singh, Daman Singh and Amrit Singh.[122] Upinder Singh is a professor of history at Ashoka University.[123] Daman Singh is a graduate of St. Stephen's College, Delhi and Institute of Rural Management, Anand, Gujarat, and author of The Last Frontier: People and Forests in Mizoram and a novel ,Nine by Nine,[124] Amrit Singh is a staff attorney at the American Civil Liberties Union.[125] Singh's son-in-law, Ashok Pattnaik, a 1983 batch Indian Police Service officer, was appointed CEO of National Intelligence Grid (NATGRID) in 2016.[126] Singh was attacked during the 1984 Anti-Sikh riots and provided financial assistance to the Citizens' Relief Committee, and had controversially apologised on behalf of the Indian National Congress for the bloodshed during the riots.[127][128] Until his death, Singh resided at 3 Motilal Nehru Marg in New Delhi.[129] Singh underwent multiple cardiac bypass surgeries, the last of which took place in January 2009.[130] In May 2020, Singh was hospitalised at the All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) due to a negative reaction from his medication.[131] In April 2021, Singh was hospitalised after testing positive for COVID-19.[132] In October 2021, Singh was hospitalised again at the AIIMS after experiencing weakness and fever.[133] On 26 December 2024, Singh had collapsed at his home in New Delhi and was admitted to the emergency department of AIIMS Delhi.[134][135][135][136] Singh died a few hours after his hospitalisation at the age of 92.[137][138][139] The government subsequently announced a period of national mourning until 1 January 2025 and said that it would accord Singh a state funeral.[140] Following his death, Prime Minister Narendra Modi called Singh one of \"India's most distinguished leaders\" and declared national mourning.[138] President Droupadi Murmu, Vice-President Jagdeep Dhankhar, Opposition Leader Rahul Gandhi, Home Affairs Minister Amit Shah, Defence Minister Rajnath Singh and former Prime Minister H. D. Deve Gowda issued statements praising Singh and his leadership after his death.[141] A Bollywood film was made in 2019 based on Singh's life, titled The Accidental Prime Minister directed by Vijay Gutte and written by Mayank Tewari with Anupam Kher in the titular role.[142] The film was based on the 2014 memoir of the same name by Sanjaya Baru.[143][144] Pradhanmantri (lit. 'Prime Minister'), a 2013 Indian documentary television series which aired on ABP News and covers the various policies and political tenures of Indian PMs, includes the tenure of Manmohan Singh in the episodes \"Story of Sonia Gandhi and UPA-I Government\", and \"Scams in UPA government and anti-corruption movement\".[145]",

            {
                "title": "Kansas State Wildcats football - Wikipedia",
                "content": "The Kansas State Wildcats football program (variously K-State or KSU) is the intercollegiate football program of the Kansas State University Wildcats. The program is classified in the NCAA Division I Bowl Subdivision (FBS), and the team competes in the Big 12 Conference. Historically, the team has an all-time losing record, at 570–671–41 as of the conclusion of the 2023 season. However, the program has had some stretches of winning in its history. Most recently, in 2022 the team under head coach Chris Klieman won the Big 12 Conference and appeared in its first Sugar Bowl. Under former coach Bill Snyder, Kansas State won two conference titles, finished the 1998 regular season with an undefeated (11–0) record and No. 1 national ranking, and from 1995 to 2001 appeared in the AP Poll for 108 consecutive weeks—the 16th-longest streak in college football history.[3] Since 1968, the team has played in Bill Snyder Family Football Stadium (formerly KSU Stadium) in Manhattan, Kansas. The Kansas State University Marching Band, also known as the Pride of Wildcat Land, performs at all home games and bowl games. According to most sources, Kansas State's football team began play on Thanksgiving Day 1893.[4][5][6] A team from Kansas State defeated St. Mary's College 18–10 on that date.[7] Other sources name Kansas State's first game as a 24–0 victory over a team from Abilene, Kansas, on November 3, 1894.[8][9] However, the first official game recorded in the team's history is a 14–0 loss to Fort Riley on November 28, 1896.[10] In its earliest years, the program had a different coach every year—generally, a former college football player who had just graduated from college.[11] Often, the coaches also played with the team during the games.[9] Some of the coaches during this era include Fay Moulton (1900), who went on to win Olympic medals as a sprinter;[12][13] Wade Moore (1901), who later was a successful minor league baseball manager;[14] and Cyrus E. Dietz (1902), who became a justice of the Illinois Supreme Court.[15][16] The pattern changed when Mike Ahearn became the first long-term coach in 1905.[17][18] Ahearn coached for six seasons, leading the team to winning records each year, and concluding in the 1910 season with a 10–1 mark.[19][18] Ahearn also won two conference championships in the Kansas Intercollegiate Athletic Association, in 1909 and 1910.[20] Ahearn was followed by Guy Lowman, who led Kansas State to another conference championship in 1912.[20][8][21][22] Kansas State accepted an invitation into the Missouri Valley Intercollegiate Athletic Association in 1913.[23][24] After a few years adjusting to the league's eligibility rules and a higher level of competition, the school experienced sustained success in the 1920s and 1930s. Elden Auker was part of a group of excellent athletes who attended Kansas State around the time of the Great Depression, which also included Ralph Graham, Maurice Elder, Leland Shaffer, Cookie Tackwell, Dougal Russell, Henry Cronkite, George Maddox, and Elmer Hackney. These athletes were coupled with a series of Hall of Fame coaches. The first of these coaches was Z.G. Clevenger, who arrived in 1916 when Kansas State essentially swapped head coaches with Tennessee.[25] Clevenger is in the College Football Hall of Fame for his playing abilities, but he was also recognized as a brilliant coach and administrator. Clevenger was followed as football coach in 1920 by Charlie Bachman, who stayed until 1927 and earned his way into the College Football Hall of Fame with his coaching prowess. Bachman was also responsible for permanently endowing Kansas State's sports teams with the nickname of \"Wildcats.\" His successor, Alvin \"Bo\" McMillin, the coach from 1928 to 1933, is also in the College Football Hall of Fame as a player, but he too was a successful coach who, after leaving Kansas State, was recognized as national collegiate coach of the year and then served as head coach for two NFL teams. After McMillin left, Kansas State hired Lynn \"Pappy\" Waldorf, who was also later enshrined in the College Football Hall of Fame as a coach. With this combination of coaches and players, Kansas State enjoyed what would be its last streak of sustained success on the football field for 60 years. In 1931, the football team was on track for a potential bid to the Rose Bowl, the sole bowl game in the country at the time, until Ralph Graham was injured. In 1934, Kansas State won its first major conference football championship. That same year, the New York Times referred to Kansas State as \"an established Middle Western leader.\"[26] But then Waldorf abruptly left for Northwestern after the season, and the winning stopped. In the midst of the period, the MVIAA split up. In 1928, six of the seven state schools in the MVIAA, including Kansas State, banded together in a conference that retained the MVIAA name. This group would evolve into the Big Eight Conference. Over the next 60 years, Kansas State would experience very little success on the football field. According to longtime Wildcat radio announcer Dev Nelson, part of the problem was that Kansas State was one of the few major schools that didn't make a significant investment in its football program after World War II.[27] Indeed, for many years the Wildcats spent far less on football—and athletics as a whole—than any Big Eight school. For example, in 1987–1988, the University of Oklahoma (the conference's second smallest school) spent $12.5 million on athletics while Kansas State spent $5.5 million.[27] Reflective of the mid-century futility was a 28-game losing streak from 1945 to 1948, the second-longest in NCAA FBS history. Kansas State also had losing streaks of 18 and 17 games in the 1960s. In the middle of posting a 0–10 record in the 1947 season, the Kansas State program slipped below the .500 all-time winning percentage, where it has remained since. However, there were a few shining moments during these decades. (the first televised homecoming game),[28][29] losing to Nebraska 25–9.[30] In the mid-1950s, head coach Bill Meek started to rebuild the program he took over in 1951.[31] In 1953, Kansas State posted a 5–3–1 record, the school's first winning season since Wes Fry's 1936 team. Upon starting that season 5–1, K-State also made the school's first appearance in the top 20 polls for college football, at No. 18 in the Coaches Poll on October 28, 1953. The following year was even better, with Kansas State posting a 7–3 record and playing for an Orange Bowl berth in their final game. But Meek left Kansas State following the 1954 season, when the school refused to give raises to his assistants.[32] Bus Mertes got his first college head coach position as the 24th head football coach for the Kansas State Wildcats in Manhattan, Kansas, and he held that position for five seasons, from 1955 until 1959.[33] His coaching record at Kansas State was 15 wins, 34 losses, and 1 ties. As of completion of the 2007 season, this ranks him tenth at Kansas State in terms of total wins and 19th at Kansas State in terms of winning percentage.[34] In seven seasons at Kansas State, Coach Doug Weaver compiled an 8–60–1 record.[35] His final two seasons went without a win. His 1961 and 1962 teams posted a losing streak of 18 games—tied for the 20th-longest streak in college football history.[citation needed] Weaver's best season at K-State came in 1964, when his team went 3–7,[36] with the three wins coming by a combined six points, but he retained his sense of humor. According to a Sports Illustrated article, after he was hanged in effigy at K-State, he said: \"I'm glad it happened in front of the library. I've always emphasized scholarship.\" He was fired following the 1966 season. His career record was 8–60–1 including a 4–43–1 record in conference play. In the late 1960s, coach Vince Gibson also briefly started to turn the program around.[37] Behind sophomore quarterback Lynn Dickey, the 1968 squad earned the school's first ranking in the AP Poll and shut out the University of Nebraska in Lincoln for the school's first victory over NU in a decade. That same season, Kansas State also moved into newly built KSU Stadium, currently named The Bill Snyder Family Stadium. The 1969 season was even better. The team started 2–0 before second-ranked Penn State University arrived to play in Manhattan, Kansas. Penn State would ultimately finish the 1969 season undefeated, but Kansas State provided them with one of their toughest tests in a 17–14 game. Following the loss to Penn State, Kansas State reeled off three straight victories, including a win over defending conference champion Kansas in the first Governor's Cup game, and a 59–21 blowout of 11th-ranked Oklahoma, which was Kansas State's first win over OU since 1934. (It was also the largest loss in Oklahoma's history.) After the Oklahoma game, Kansas State sported a 5–1 record and a No. 12 national ranking in the AP Poll. This was the high point of the season, as the team lost its last four games to finish 5–5. Nevertheless, in only his third season, Gibson had dramatically improved the program. Prior to the 1970 season, Gibson was named the pre-season national coach of the year by Playboy Magazine. The season that followed was up-and-down but ultimately disappointing despite a winning record and a second-place finish in the Big Eight. Kansas State won at Oklahoma and defeated eighth-ranked Colorado, but the season was soured by non-conference defeats and a blow-out loss to Nebraska in the final conference game of the year with the conference title on the line. The worst news of the season came on October 7, 1970, when the conference issued severe sanctions against Kansas State for recruiting violations. The Wildcats were placed on three years' probation, including a one-year ban from bowl games and live television. Gibson would never have another winning season, and left the school in 1974. He later said that the sanctions—the product of what he called an immature quarrel between himself and Jayhawks coach Pepper Rodgers—destroyed everything he'd built over his first four years.[38] Wisconsin assistant coach Ellis Rainsberger returned to his alma mater to serve as head football coach from 1975 to 1977.[39] He started his tenure there winning his first three games, but ultimately compiled a record of 6–27.[40] Rainsberger left Kansas State with the program placed on probation for giving too many scholarships. The Wildcats wouldn't have another winning season until 1982, when Jim Dickey led a redshirt-laden roster to the 1982 Independence Bowl—the first bowl appearance in school history.[41] However, Dickey was unable to sustain the momentum, and suffered back-to-back three-win seasons in 1983 and 1984.[42][43] After the team opened the 1985 season with two consecutive losses to I-AA teams,[44] Dickey was forced to resign,[45] leaving Kansas State with a record of 24–52–2.[46] In 1986, Marshall head coach Stan Parrish was hired as K-State's head coach.[47] Parrish was unable to sustain any sort of success, posting yearly records of 2–9, 0–10–1,[48] and 0–11.[49] The Wildcats bottomed out by going on a 27-game winless streak (0–26–1) that began in October 1986. Following back-to-back winless campaigns, Parrish resigned under pressure after the 1988 season.[50] By then, Kansas State had become the first program in Division I-A (FBS) to lose 500 games and had the worst overall record in the nation. In 93 years of play, the Wildcats had gone 299–509–41 (.370).[27] Things changed in 1989, when the athletic department hired Iowa's offensive coordinator, Bill Snyder, to replace Parrish as head coach. Snyder took over a program that had the worst record in NCAA Division I-A (FBS) history at the time and had gone 27 consecutive games without a win (0–26–1) dating to October 1986.[27] From 1935 to 1988, the last year before Snyder's arrival, Kansas State had won 137 games in total. Since the 1982 Independence Bowl season, the Wildcats had won a total of seven games. Snyder then presided over one of the most successful rebuilding projects in the history of college athletics, ultimately earning enshrinement in the College Football Hall of Fame for his work at Kansas State. Considering the dreadful state of the program he'd inherited, Snyder made the Wildcats respectable fairly quickly. In his third year, 1991, Snyder's Wildcats finished 7–4 and narrowly missed receiving the school's second bowl bid ever. The team also finished with a winning record in conference play for only the third time since winning the conference title in 1934. In Snyder's fifth season in 1993, Kansas State played in the 1993 Copper Bowl, only its second bowl bid ever. They then pounded Wyoming 52–17 to tally the first bowl win in school history, breaking one of the longest such droughts in Division I-A at the time. Success and high rankings continued over the next decade, including six top-ten finishes in the AP Poll and four consecutive 11-win seasons from 1997 to 2000. The latter included a perfect (11–0) regular season in 1998 (before stumbling in the Big 12 Championship Game against Texas A&M). The game ended on a controversial play in double-overtime, with Sirr Parker being credited a touchdown despite video replay clearly indicating his knee down at the one yard line. As the team improved, recruiting also improved, in large part because Snyder began tapping the rich talent base in Kansas' junior college system. Snyder was able to bring in athletes such as quarterback Michael Bishop, the runner-up for the Heisman Trophy in 1998, and running back Darren Sproles, who led the nation in rushing in 2003 and holds the Big 12 record for all-purpose yards in a career. The run of success culminated in a Big 12 Conference championship in 2003 with a 35–7 victory over the No. 1 ranked Oklahoma. (The 69 years since the last conference title in 1934 was the longest span between football titles in Division I history.) In his first 17-year stint as head coach at K-State, Snyder won 136 games—as many as his predecessors had won from 1935 to 1988—and led Kansas State to 11 consecutive bowl games (1993–2003), including six wins. Snyder's legacy at K-State during his first term also included winning or sharing four Big 12 North titles (1998, 1999, 2000, 2003) and six 11-win seasons. In 1998, Snyder was recognized as the National Coach of the Year by the Associated Press and the Walter Camp Football Foundation, and was awarded the Bear Bryant Award and the Bobby Dodd Coach of the Year Award.[51][52] Snyder was also selected Big Eight Conference coach of the Year by the Associated Press three times (1990, 1991 and 1993), joining Bob Devaney as the only two men in Big Eight history to be named Coach of the Year three times in a four-year period. Snyder was named Big 12 Conference coach of the Year twice during his first term, in 1998 (Associated Press, coaches) and 2002 (coaches). The winning attitude under Snyder was represented by a stylized wildcat, called the \"Powercat\" (shown in the infobox), that was added to the football team's uniforms in 1989.[53] The emblem became so popular that by the late 1990s it had essentially replaced \"Willie the Wildcat\", a character designed by art department students in the late 1950s. On December 5, 2005, Ron Prince was hired as the 33rd head football coach of the Kansas State Wildcats.[54] Prince was formerly the offensive coordinator at Virginia. In 2006, Prince's first year at the helm of the Wildcats, he led Kansas State to a 7–6 record and the team's first winning season since 2003. The signature win of the regular season was a 45–42 upset over No. 4-ranked University of Texas on November 11, 2006. Kansas State finished the season with a 37–10 loss to the Scarlet Knights of Rutgers University in the inaugural Texas Bowl on December 28, 2006. In Prince's second season, the team featured standout quarterback Josh Freeman and receiver Jordy Nelson, but still slipped to a 5–7 record. Coach Prince got the 2007 team off to a quick start, with a 3–1 record and a No. 24 ranking in the AP Poll after four weeks—the first ranking for Kansas State since the 2004 season. This start included another victory against a top 10-ranked Texas team, this time by 20 points.[30] However, in the next four games, the team alternated wins and losses and fell from the Top 25. Four straight losses followed to close out the season. The 2008 season was Ron Prince's third at Kansas State. Coach Prince led the 2008 team to another 5–7 record. With three games remaining in the season, on November 5, 2008, the school announced that Ron Prince would not return as Kansas State head coach in 2009. Ron Prince finished his career at Kansas State 0–9 against Kansas State's biggest rivals (Nebraska, Kansas, and Missouri)[55] On November 23, 2008, in a surprising move, Kansas State University announced that Bill Snyder was coming out of retirement and was hired to replace Ron Prince as head coach.[56] Snyder initially received a 5-year, $1.8 million contract. In 2009, Snyder led the team to a 6–6 record, going 4–4 in Big 12 play,[57] and falling one game short of winning the Big 12 North. The team failed to make a bowl game for the third consecutive season. Following a loss to Nebraska Cornhuskers football at Memorial Stadium on November 21, 2009, Kansas State became the fourth FBS teams to lose 600 games, joining Northwestern, Indiana, and Wake Forest.[58] Snyder led the 2010 team to an improved 7–6 record, with a 3–5 record in conference play,[59] good for third in the North division. The season ended with a loss to Syracuse in the 2010 Pinstripe Bowl—K-State's first bowl appearance since Ron Prince led the school to the 2006 Texas Bowl. In 2011, Coach Snyder led the team to a 10–3 record, a second-place finish in the Big 12 Conference, and a No. 15 ranking in the final AP Poll.[60] The team finished the season with a loss to the No. 7 Arkansas Razorbacks in the Cotton Bowl. It was the first 10-win season and first top-20 ranking for Kansas State since the 2003 season. After the season Snyder was named the Woody Hayes Coach of the Year and the Sporting News National Coach of the Year, as well as the Big 12 Conference Coach of the Year. In 2012, Snyder's Wildcats won the school's sixth conference football championship, and first since 2003. Kansas State also earned the school's first No. 1 ranking in the BCS standings after starting the season 10–0, before falling to Baylor in its 11th game of the season.[61][62] The Wildcats earned the conference's automatic berth in the 2013 Fiesta Bowl, where the team lost to the No. 5 Oregon Ducks, 35–17. After the season, Coach Snyder was named the conference coach of the year for the seventh time in his career.[63] He also was awarded the Bobby Dodd Coach of the Year Award for the second time.[64] He and Joe Paterno are the only two-time winners of the award. In 2013, after completing the regular season with a 7–5 record, the Kansas State Wildcats returned for a bowl game for the fourth straight year, were selected to play in the 2013 Buffalo Wild Wings Bowl and played the Michigan Wolverines.[65] Winning this game, Kansas State snapped a five-game bowl losing streak, beating Michigan in the Buffalo Wild Wings Bowl, 31–14.[66] On January 31, 2013, it was announced that Snyder's contract was extended through the 2017 season.[67] In 2014, the Wildcats were led to a 9–3 record by Snyder with losses to Auburn of the SEC, Baylor and TCU, finishing third in the Big 12. The Wildcats had been ranked in all polls with the highest ranking in the new College Football Playoff rankings at number 7. Kansas State became bowl eligible after winning its sixth game against Texas on October 25. The No. 11 Wildcats were invited to the Alamo Bowl where they fell to No. 14 UCLA in San Antonio, Texas, 40–35. On December 2, 2018, Bill Snyder announced his second retirement from coaching college football.[68] The turnaround of the Kansas State football program between Snyder's initial arrival in 1989 and second retirement in 2018 is widely regarded as one of the most remarkable in college football history.[69][70] He retired as the twentieth-winningest head coach in college football history.[71] Snyder finished his career with Kansas State with 215 victories and two Big 12 championships.[72] He has accounted for over 40 percent of Kansas State's all-time wins as of the completion of the 2018 season.[73] On December 10, 2018, following Bill Snyder's decision to retire again, North Dakota State head coach Chris Klieman was announced as the new Kansas State head football coach.[74] Both schools agreed that Klieman would remain at NDSU while the Bison were participating in the FCS playoffs, then take over as Wildcats head coach once the Bisons' season ended.[75][76] When he was hired by K-State, Klieman signed a six-year contract worth over $2 million annually excluding incentives.[77][78][79] The Wildcats exceeded expectations in his Klieman's season, finishing with an 8–5 record which included a CFP rank as high as No. 20, a win over No. 5 Oklahoma,[80] and a Liberty Bowl berth, where they lost to Navy.[81] During the 2020 season, Chris Klieman led Kansas State to a 4–6 season and 4–5 in the Big 12, which is good for 7th in the Big 12 standings. The 2020 season was shortened by Covid. On October 5, 2020, K-State and Chris Klieman agreed to a new contract worth $23.5 million over the course of the deal excluding incentives.[82] In the 2021 Season, Chris Klieman and the Wildcats had a bounce back season and ended the season 8–5 overall and another 4–5 in the Big 12. Kansas State beat LSU in the Texas Bowl. In the 2022 season, Kansas State went 10–4 overall and 7–2 in the Big 12. The Wildcats beat then-undefeated TCU to win the 2022 Big 12 Championship. The team was selected for the New Year Six Bowl; the Sugar Bowl, however, lost to a 10-2 Alabama Crimson Tide team. Chris Klieman has 39–24 (62%) overall record and 26–19 (57%) in the Big 12. On May 15, 2023, Kansas State University and Chris Klieman agreed to a new eight-year contract worth $5.5 million annually excluding incentives.[83] Klieman led the Wildcats to a 9–4 record in 2023.[84] They began the season on September 2 with a 45–0 shutout victory over FCS opponent Southeast Missouri State.[85][86] After a 42–13 victory over Troy the following week,[87] K-State suffered their first loss of the season in a 30–27 contest against Missouri on a 61-yard field goal as time expired.[88] After a 44–31 win over UCF the next week,[89] Klieman's team lost 29–21 to Oklahoma State.[90][91] The Wildcats then reeled off three straight wins; 38–21 over Texas Tech,[92] 41–3 over TCU[93] and a 41–0 shutout over Houston.[94] On November 3, Kansas State dropped a 33–30 heartbreaker to Texas in overtime.[95][96] After a 59–25 win over Baylor[97] and a 31–27 victory over archrival Kansas,[98] the Wildcats closed the regular season with a 42–35 loss to rival Iowa State.[99] Kansas State accepted a berth in the 2023 Pop-Tarts Bowl, where they defeated NC State by a score of 28–19.[100] Kansas State has won seven conference championships, six outright and one shared. † Co-champions Kansas State has won four division championships, all within the Big 12 North. † Co-champions Kansas State has appeared in 25 bowl games, posting an overall record of 11–14. The team's most recent appearance in a bowl game was a 28–19 win against North Carolina State University at the 2023 Pop-Tarts Bowl. The team's first bowl game was the 1982 Independence Bowl, under coach Jim Dickey. The Wildcats lost to the Wisconsin Badgers 14–3 in that contest. The team's next bowl game came in 1993 when Kansas State began a streak of 11 straight bowl appearances under coach Bill Snyder that lasted through the 2003 season. This is the 21st-longest bowl streak in college football history.[101] Kansas State has been invited seven times to one of the \"New Year's Six\" major bowl games (the Rose, Sugar, Fiesta, Orange, Cotton, and Peach Bowls), including appearances in BCS and Bowl Alliance games. Not included in this tally of bowl games is Kansas State's first \"post-season\" game, played in 1931 against Wichita State as a fundraiser during the Great Depression.[8] Kansas State won that game 20–6. Also not included is the 1992 \"Coca-Cola Bowl\" played in Tokyo, Japan, against Nebraska, which was a regular season game.[10] † The Cactus Bowl includes in its history Kansas State appearances in the Copper Bowl (1993), the Insight.com Bowl (2001), the Buffalo WildWings Bowl (2013), the Cactus Bowl (2017), and the Rate Bowl (2024). Kansas State University has finished in the final rankings of the AP Poll or Coaches Poll on 15 occasions throughout its history, including six top-10 finishes. The AP Poll first appeared in 1934, and has been published continuously since 1936. The Coaches Poll began in the 1950–51 season. In addition to the major polls, the BCS produced rankings from 1998 to 2013, to help select teams for BCS Bowls. The final BCS standings were issued before bowl games. Beginning in 2014, the College Football Playoff committee began issuing rankings to determine which teams were selected for the playoffs. Kansas State spent four weeks ranked No. 1 in mid-season Coaches Polls during the 1998 season, and one week ranked No. 1 in the mid-season BCS standings during the 2012 season, but has not finished with a No. 1 ranking in a final poll.[102][page needed] Kansas State's first official playing field was an open public square in Manhattan located at Bluemont Avenue and 8th Street, which it began using in 1897.[4][9] The square hosted Kansas State baseball games and track meets in addition to football contests.[9] The first improvements built at this site were a wooden fence around the square and a wooden covered grandstand, erected in 1901.[9] A new grandstand was built in 1906, along with a small locker room.[9] Seats for football games in the new grandstand were reserved with a charge of $1.00 for the season, plus the admission fee for each game.[9] Construction of Bluemont Elementary School on that plot of land forced Kansas State to move its athletics on campus beginning in 1911.[4][9] The on-campus football field was located at the southwest corner of the campus and was named Ahearn Field in honor of former coach Mike Ahearn, who had led the football team to a 10–1 record in its last season at the prior field. The covered wooden grandstand and locker room from the old field were moved and used at Ahearn Field.[9] In 1922, Kansas State opened the first section of Memorial Stadium on the location of Ahearn Field, at a cost of $500,000 USD. The stadium's name was a tribute to Kansas State students who died in World War I. It had a seating capacity of 17,500 when completed, although attendance sometimes exceeded 20,000. By 1967, the school's allegiance outgrew the old stadium, and the team moved to KSU Stadium in 1968. KSU Stadium opened its doors September 21, 1968, with a 21–0 victory over Colorado State. It was renamed Bill Snyder Family Football Stadium after former head coach Bill Snyder originally retired at the end of the 2005 season. The original stadium seating capacity was 35,000. An expansion in the summer of 1970 added 4,000 permanent bleachers on the east side and 3,000 temporary bleachers on the west side. Following the 1998 season, the addition of a deck and sky suites on the east side of the stadium increased capacity to more than 50,000. In 2013, Kansas State opened an entirely new West Side Stadium Center, including a new press box, additional luxury seats, and areas for student-athlete uses (including a dining area). The exterior of the West Side Stadium Center is faced with limestone and features two towers with decorative battlements. In August 2015, Kansas State finished a $69 million renovation to the north end zone (Vanier Football Complex). It includes a new student study area, an 1,800 square foot locker room, and a 10,000 square foot weight room as well as new coaches offices, seating, and a new team entrance area. It also features a limestone facade on its exterior similar to the rest of the K-State campus Kansas State's final stage of the Bill Snyder Family Stadium master plan was completed prior to the 2021 football season with the addition of the Shamrock Zone on the south end of the stadium. This addition connects the stadium's south endzone luxury seating to Bramlage Coliseum; known as the Legends Club. Kansas State's longest home winning streak in the stadium was a 26-game streak from 1996 to 2000. On November 11, 2000, 53,811 fans witnessed Kansas State's 29–28 win over Nebraska; this remains the largest crowd in the stadium's history, and also the largest attendance for any collegiate sporting event in the state of Kansas. Colorado leads the series 45–21–1. Both former Big 8 and Big 12 rivals Kansas State played annually against each other in all sports from 1948 to 2010.[103] In 2016, Colorado football announced a renewed rivalry series between Kansas State in a home-and-home series in 2027 and 2028.[104] Following Colorado's announcement that it would rejoin the Big 12 starting in 2024, the two will likely play as regular conference opponents, earlier than the series that was previously scheduled.[105] On November 1, 2023, the Big 12 announced the opponents for the 2024 through 2027 seasons, with Colorado and Kansas State scheduled to meet in 2024, 2025, and 2026.[106] Kansas State has played Iowa State every year since their first match-up in 1917, making it the eighth-longest active series in NCAA college football (102 straight years), and the longest never-interrupted series in college football history. The series record is the closest for Kansas State against any of its old Big Eight Conference rivals, with Iowa State holding a 53–50–4 lead following the 2023 game. In 2009 and 2010, the two schools played neutral-site games at Arrowhead Stadium in Kansas City, Missouri, and fans and media adopted the name \"Farmageddon\" for the series. The name alludes to the two schools' agriculture programs. Kansas State University won the first \"Farmageddon\" game in Kansas City 24–23 in 2009, and won again the following year, 27–20. After 2010 the schools returned to playing on their campuses. Following the 2022 contest, K-State has won 26 of the last 33 games between the two schools. Kansas State and Kansas first played in 1902 and have faced each other every season since 1911, making this the sixth-longest continuous series in NCAA college football history (108 straight years).[107][108] The two rivals compete annually for the Governor's Cup trophy. Neither school has had sustained excellence at the same time. The only time for a while that both schools met as ranked teams was in 1995, when the University of Kansas came into the game 7–0 and ranked No. 6 in the AP Poll, while Kansas State University was 5–1 and ranked No. 14. Kansas State beat KU 41–7 in that game. They had another ranked showdown in 2023, with #25 Kansas hosting #21 Kansas State in Lawrence. Kansas State won the back-and-forth game 31-27. KU leads the all-time series 64–53–5 after the 2023 season. The University of Kansas disputes the series record because it does not acknowledge its forfeit of a 1980 victory.[109] Kansas State and Nebraska were conference rivals for almost a century, from 1913 to 2010. With only 135 miles separating the two schools, they were the closest cross-border rivals in the Big 8 and Big 12 conferences. The two schools played for the first time in 1911, and then played every year from 1922, making it one of the longest uninterrupted series in college football, until Nebraska moved to the Big Ten Conference in 2011. All-time, Nebraska leads the series 78–15–2. Kansas State lost 29 consecutive games to Nebraska, lasting from 1969 to November 14, 1998, when No. 1 Kansas State beat No. 11 Nebraska 40–30. The record between the two schools after that game was more even with Kansas State going an improved 4–8 in the last 12 years Nebraska was in the Big 12. The 1939 contest between the two teams was televised in Manhattan, becoming only the second televised college football game. The 1992 contest was played in Tokyo, Japan, as the Coca-Cola Classic. Kansas State also has a rivalry with Oklahoma.[110] The series between the border rivals was first contested in 1908 and has been played 103 times.[111][112] Oklahoma has dominated K-State for most of the history of the rivalry, including winning 32 in a row over the Wildcats from 1937 to 1968.[113] Oklahoma went 54–2 against Kansas State from 1937 to 1992.[114] However, the series has been much more competitive since the early 1990's.[114] The Wildcats won five in a row from 1993 to 1997 and have won 11 games over the Sooners since 1993 compared to Oklahoma's 14 wins over the same time span.[115][116] The teams were members of the old Big Eight Conference together from 1928 to 1995 and the Big 12 Conference from 1996 to 2023.[117] However, the Sooners will be leaving the Big 12 for the Southeastern Conference in 2024,[118][119] and there are currently no future meetings scheduled. The all-time series record currently stands at 77–22–4 in favor of Oklahoma.[120] The official color of the university is Royal Purple, which is highlighted in the official fight song, \"Wildcat Victory.\" Kansas State is one of a handful of colleges and universities to have just one official school color. The athletic department commonly uses white or silver as a complementary color. The dominant color in Kansas State's football uniforms is Royal Purple. The team's home jersey is purple with white lettering, two white stripes around the sleeves, TV numbers on the shoulders, and a white Powercat logo under the collar. K-State's away jersey is white with purple lettering, two purple stripes around the sleeves, TV numbers on the shoulders and a purple Powercat under the collar. Both home and away pants are silver with a white stripe and purple trim down the sides, with a purple Powercat on the front left side of the pants. The team has worn these uniforms from 1989 to 2007, and from 2010 to present. The uniforms were altered slightly in 2008 and 2009. In 2008, the Wildcats introduced purple pants while playing road games. These debuted in the first road game of the season at Louisville. The team wore purple pants every road game in 2008 until the final road game of the season at Missouri, when the Wildcats wore gray pants. On November 15, 2008, Kansas State wore purple pants with purple jerseys at home against Nebraska, marking the first time since 1988 that the team wore all-purple uniforms. The Wildcats warmed up for the Nebraska game with their traditional purple jerseys with gray pants but came out for the game wearing purple pants. Kansas State has had the same design on its football helmets since 1989: silver with a dark purple Powercat logo on both sides, and a white stripe and purple trim from the front to the rear of the helmet. On each side of the helmet's stripe is the individual player's number. The word \"Wildcats\" is also written on the back of the helmet at the very bottom. But on Fort Riley Day 2013 there was purple digital camouflage on the helmets. The official mascot for the Kansas State Wildcats is Willie the Wildcat. Willie appears at every football game, home and away, as well as every home men's and women's basketball games, volleyball games, and select baseball games. Willie does one push-up for each point the football team scores, which is followed by a \"K!-S!-U! Wildcats!\" cheer. Since 1915, Kansas State has hosted an annual Homecoming event for its alumni in conjunction with a home football game. More recently, other events have also developed into traditions. Once per year the school hosts \"Fort Riley Day\", when U.S. Army soldiers from nearby Fort Riley are given tickets to the game. During the game, the soldiers receive special recognition. Since 2008, the school's mascot, Willie the Wildcat, has donned digital US Army fatigues in place of his usual football uniform for this game. The Fort Riley game often has high attendance numbers. During KSU's annual \"Harley Day\", Willie wears a leather vest or jacket with leather chaps on top of his usual football uniform and rides into Bill Snyder Family Stadium on a Harley-Davidson motorcycle, followed by around 50 other K-State fans on motorcycles. Kansas State also hosts an annual \"Band Day\" for area high school marching bands. A number of slogans and nicknames are associated with Kansas State, including: In 1992, K-State installed a new press box and 2 Ahearn Fund Donors, Randy Shoemaker and John Badke after the public address announcer would say “x” amount of yards on the play, they would yell and motion, “Good for a Wildcat First-down!” The announcer then caught on and helped start what would become a K-State tradition. After a Wildcat first down, the announcer would say, \"Good for a Wildcat first down.\" Now, with the addition of the first down and touchdown arm motions, K-State's P.A. announcer no longer even needs to finish the phrase, as the Wildcat fans finish it for him. Former KSU quarterbacks Lynn Dickey and Steve Grogan had their jersey number 11 retired by the university to jointly honor both players. It is the only number retired by the football program. In 2002, the athletic department inducted the first class into its Ring of Honor. The honored players' names and jersey numbers are on the facade of the east side of the stadium. The first class consisted of Dickey, Grogan, Sean Snyder, Jaime Mendez, Gary Spani, and Veryl Switzer.[124] In 2008, a second class was inducted into the Ring of Honor, consisting of Terence Newman, Martín Gramática, David Allen, and Mark Simoneau.[125] In 2015, a third class was inducted, consisting of Michael Bishop, Jordy Nelson, Clarence Scott, and Darren Sproles. In 2022, a fourth class was inducted, consisting of Larry Brown, Ell Roberson, Darren Howard, Tyler Lockett, Arthur Brown, and Collin Klein. Kansas State's football team has played in some pioneering televised games, including: The following Kansas State players and coaches are in the College Football Hall of Fame (with induction year): Kansas State players and coaches have won the following national awards: Player honors Coaching honors Since 1936, the Heisman Trophy has been awarded to the most outstanding player in college football in the United States.

                "content": "Jimmy Butler III (born September 14, 1989) is an American professional basketball player for the Miami Heat of the National Basketball Association (NBA). Nicknamed \"Jimmy Buckets\", he is a six-time NBA All-Star, a five-time All-NBA Team member, and a five-time NBA All-Defensive Team member. He won a gold medal as a member of the 2016 U.S. Olympic team. Butler played one year of college basketball for Tyler Junior College before transferring to Marquette University. He was selected with the 30th overall pick in the 2011 NBA draft by the Chicago Bulls. In 2015, he was named the NBA Most Improved Player. After six seasons in Chicago, he was traded to the Minnesota Timberwolves in June 2017, and was then again traded in November 2018, this time to the Philadelphia 76ers. In July 2019, he signed with the Heat. During his first season with the team, Butler reached the NBA Finals. In 2021, he led the league in steals. In 2023, Butler and the eighth-seeded Heat played in the 2023 NBA Finals, their second appearance in four years.[1][2] Butler was born in Houston on September 14, 1989.[3][4] His father, Jimmy Butler Jr., left the family when Butler was an infant. When he was 13 years old and living in the Houston suburb of Tomball, his mother kicked him out of the house. As Butler remembered it in a 2011 interview, she told him, \"I don't like the look of you. You gotta go.\" He moved between the homes of various friends, staying for a few weeks at a time before moving to another house.[5] Butler maintains a relationship with his parents, saying, \"I don't hold grudges. I still talk to my family. My mom. My father. We love each other. That's never going to change.\"[6][7] In a summer basketball league before his senior year at Tomball High School, he was noticed by Jordan Leslie, a freshman football and basketball player at the school, who challenged him to a three-point shooting contest. The two became friends, and Butler stayed at Leslie's house for a few months, Leslie's mother and stepfather had six other children between them. Butler would later say, \"They accepted me into their family. And it wasn't because of basketball. She [Michelle Lambert, Leslie's mother] was just very loving. She just did stuff like that. I couldn't believe it.\"[5] As a junior at Tomball High, Butler averaged 10 points per game. As a senior and team captain in 2006–07, Butler averaged 19.9 points and 8.7 rebounds per game and was subsequently voted his team's most valuable player. Butler was not recruited coming out of high school and chose to attend Tyler Junior College in Tyler, Texas.

The Heat set an NBA record by making all 40 of their free throws, the last of those coming on Butler's three-point play with 12.9 seconds left in the game.[119] On February 10, Butler made a game-winning alley-oop dunk in a 97–95 win over the Houston Rockets.[120] On March 11, Butler scored a season-high 38 points, including 15 in the final six minutes of the fourth quarter when Miami overcame a 15-point deficit. His three-pointer at the buzzer of regulation sent the game to overtime, which the Heat lost 126–114 in against the Orlando Magic.[121] On April 1, Butler recorded a season-high 12 assists and 35 points on 12-of-16 shooting from the field in a 129–122 win over the Dallas Mavericks.[122] On April 14, Butler in his second play-in appearance scored a game-high 31 points to help the Heat take a 102–91 win over his former team, the Chicago Bulls, and secure the eighth seed for the playoffs. He and Max Strus became the third Heat duo with 30 points apiece in a playoff or play-in game.[123] In Game 1 of the Heat's first round playoff series against the top-seeded Milwaukee Bucks, Butler recorded 35 points, 5 rebounds, 11 assists and three steals in a 130–117 win to lead the Heat to a 1–0 series lead.[124] He moved to second place in 35+ point playoff games in Heat franchise history (10), surpassing LeBron James (9) and trailing only Dwyane Wade (14).[125] In Game 4 of the Heat's playoff series against the Bucks, Butler scored a career-high 56 points on 19-for-28 shooting from the field and 15-of-18 shooting from the free throw line, including a franchise-record 22 points in the first quarter, in a 119–114 win.[126] His 56 points also set a Miami Heat franchise record for the most points scored in a playoff game, surpassing LeBron James' previous record of 49.[127][128][129] In Game 5 of the series against the Bucks, Butler recorded 42 points, eight rebounds, four assists and two steals in a 128–126 overtime win, leading the Heat to the second round of the playoffs. He also became the first player in Heat history to put up back-to-back 40-point playoff games and also put up his eighth 40-point playoff game as a member of the Heat, surpassing Dwyane Wade's previous Heat franchise record of seven 40-point playoff games. In Games 4 and 5, Butler amassed a total of 98 points, becoming one of five players in NBA playoff history to produce that many points in a two-game span. He joined Michael Jordan (who accomplished the feat on three occasions), Jerry West, Elgin Baylor and Rick Barry. Butler finished the series averaging 37.6 points, 6 rebounds, 4.8 assists and 1.8 steals per game.[130][131][132] In Game 1 of the Eastern Conference finals, Butler recorded 35 points, five rebounds, seven assists and a playoff career-high six steals in a 123–116 win over the Boston Celtics.[133] The Heat eventually advanced to the NBA Finals after winning the series in seven games. In Game 7 against the Celtics, Butler posted 28 points, seven rebounds, six assists and three steals in the 103–84 win.[134][135] In a narrow vote between him and Caleb Martin, Butler was named Eastern Conference Finals MVP, averaging 24.7 points, 7.6 rebounds, 6.1 assists and 2.6 steals per game.[136] In Game 2 of the NBA Finals, Butler put up 21 points and nine assists in a 111–108 win over the Denver Nuggets. He joined LeBron James and Dwyane Wade as the only players in Heat history to put up at least 500 points, 100 rebounds, and 100 assists in a single postseason run.[137] However, the Heat went on to lose the next 3 games of the series to lose the finals in 5 games.[138] On November 16, 2023, Butler scored 36 points in a 122–115 win over the Brooklyn Nets, to lead the Heat to their first seven-game win streak since January 14, 2018.[139] On December 16, Butler put up 28 points alongside a buzzer-beating, game-winning stepback jumper in a 118–116 win over the Chicago Bulls.[140][141] On February 7, 2024, Butler recorded his 16th career triple-double with 17 points, 11 rebounds, 11 assists and three steals in a 116–104 win over the San Antonio Spurs.[142] On March 2, Butler scored a season-high 37 points on 12-of-19 shooting, 3-of-3 from three and 10-of-11 from the free throw line in a 126–120 win over the Utah Jazz.[143] Butler missed the 2024 NBA playoffs following a medial collateral ligament (MCL) sprain he sustained during a play-in game against the Philadelphia 76ers.[144] On November 24, 2024, Butler scored 33 points along with nine rebounds and six assists in a 123–118 overtime win over the Dallas Mavericks.[145] On December 16, he had 35 points, 19 rebounds and 10 assists in a 125–124 loss to the Detroit Pistons, becoming the third player in NBA history to finish with at least 35 points, 19 rebounds, 10 assists and four steals in a game, joining DeMarcus Cousins in 2018 and George McGinnis in 1976.[146] While attending Marquette, Butler earned a Bachelor of Arts degree in communications.[147][148] Butler is a fan of country and emo music. He starred in the music video of the country song \"Light It Up\" by Luke Bryan[149] and the emo song \"So Much (for) Stardust\" by Fall Out Boy.[150] He is good friends with Mark Wahlberg, whom he met while Wahlberg was filming Transformers: Age of Extinction in Chicago. The two have vacationed in Paris together.[151] Butler became a fan of soccer during the 2016 Summer Olympics, after watching Neymar Jr. play for Brazil. He cites Paris Saint Germain as his favorite team and Neymar as his favorite player.[152] [153] Butler and his girlfriend have two children.[154] He did not make his Heat debut until the fourth game of the 2019–20 NBA season, as he was on paternity leave after the birth of his first child.[155] In the NBA Bubble, Butler opened Big Face Coffee, a side business which he operated out of his hotel room using his French press coffee brewer, charging $20 per cup.[156] A year later, he officially launched his coffee brand, and planned to dedicate his time into the coffee roastery business post-retirement.[157] During the 2023 NBA playoffs, Butler filed a trademark on the name \"Himmy Butler\" for the purpose of launching his own clothing and beverage brand. The nickname \"Himmy\" came from the meme phrase \"he's him\", which rose in popularity during the Heat's Butler-led run during that postseason.[158][159] Butler is a Christian.[160] Butler is featured in the Netflix documentary series, \"Starting 5\", which followed Butler, Anthony Edwards, LeBron James, Domantas Sabonis, and Jayson Tatum through the 2023–24 NBA season and playoffs.[161] Butler's father died on February 8, 2024.[162]",

                "content": "Manchester City Football Club (or simply Man City F.C.) is a professional football club based in Manchester, England, that competes in the Premier League, the top flight of English football. Founded in 1880 as St. Mark's (West Gorton), they became Ardwick Association Football Club in 1887 and Manchester City in 1894. The club's home ground is the City of Manchester Stadium, currently known as the Etihad Stadium in east Manchester, to which they moved in 2003, having played at Maine Road since 1923. Manchester City adopted their sky blue home shirts in 1894, the first season with the current name.[4] Over the course of its history, the club has won ten league titles, seven FA Cups, eight League Cups, seven FA Community Shields, one UEFA Champions League, one European Cup Winners' Cup, one UEFA Super Cup and one FIFA Club World Cup. The club joined the Football League in 1892, and won their first major honour, the FA Cup, in 1904. Manchester City had its first major period of success in the late 1960s and early 1970s, winning the league title, FA Cup, League Cup, and European Cup Winners Cup under the management of Joe Mercer and Malcolm Allison. After losing the 1981 FA Cup final, Manchester City went through a period of decline, culminating in relegation to the third tier of English football for the only time in their history in 1998. They since regained promotion to the top tier in 2001–02 and have remained a fixture in the Premier League since 2002–03. Manchester City received considerable financial investment both in playing staff and facilities following its takeover by Sheikh Mansour bin Zayed Al Nahyan through the Abu Dhabi United Group in August 2008.[5] This started a new era of unprecedented success, with the club winning the FA Cup in 2011 and the Premier League in 2012, both their first since the 1960s, followed by another league title in 2014. Under the management of Pep Guardiola, Manchester City won the Premier League in 2018, becoming the only team in the competition history to attain 100 points in a single season. In 2018–19, they won four trophies, completing an unprecedented sweep of all domestic titles in England and becoming the first English men's team to win the domestic treble.[6] This was followed by four consecutive Premier League titles in 2020–21, 2021–22, 2022–23 and 2023–24, as well as the club's first Champions League final in 2021, which they lost to Chelsea. The 2022–23 season saw Manchester City win their maiden European Cup and complete the continental treble in the process, becoming the second English club to do so.[7] The club was ranked first in the UEFA coefficient standings in 2023.[8] By the end of 2024, the club had suffered a decline, losing nine out of their last twelve games, winning only one. They were placed seventh in the Premier League on 27 points.[9] Manchester City topped the Deloitte Football Money League at the end of the 2021–22 season, making it the football club with the highest revenue in the world, approximated at €731 million.[10] In 2022, Forbes estimated the club was the sixth-most valuable in the world, worth $4.250 billion.[11][12] Manchester City are owned by City Football Group Limited, a holding company valued at £3.73 ($4.8) billion in November 2019 and majority-owned by the Abu Dhabi United Group.[13][14] City gained their first honours by winning the Second Division in 1899; with it came promotion to the highest level in English football, the First Division. They went on to claim their first major honour on 23 April 1904, beating Bolton Wanderers 1–0 at Crystal Palace to win the FA Cup; the Blues narrowly missed out on a League and Cup double that season after finishing runners-up in the league campaign, but they still became the first club in Manchester to win a major honour.[16] In the seasons following the FA Cup triumph, the club was dogged by allegations of financial irregularities, culminating in the suspension of seventeen players in 1906, including captain Billy Meredith, who subsequently moved across town to Manchester United.[17] A fire at Hyde Road destroyed the main stand in 1920, and in 1923 the club moved to their new purpose-built stadium at Maine Road in Moss Side.[18] In the 1930s, Manchester City reached two consecutive FA Cup finals, losing to Everton in 1933, before claiming the Cup by beating Portsmouth in 1934.[19] During the 1934 run, the club broke the record for the highest home attendance of any club in English football history, as 84,569 fans packed Maine Road for a sixth-round FA Cup tie against Stoke City – a record which stood until 2016.[20][21] The club won the First Division title for the first time in 1937, but were relegated the following season, despite scoring more goals than any other team in the division.[22] Twenty years later, a City team inspired by a tactical system known as the Revie Plan reached consecutive FA Cup finals again, in 1955 and 1956; just as in the 1930s, they lost the first one, to Newcastle United, and won the second. The 1956 final, in which the Blues defeated Birmingham City 3–1, saw City goalkeeper Bert Trautmann continuing to play on after unknowingly breaking his neck.[23] After being relegated to the Second Division in 1963, the future looked bleak with a record low home attendance of 8,015 against Swindon Town in January 1965.[24] In the summer of 1965, the management team of Joe Mercer and Malcolm Allison was appointed. In the first season under Mercer, Manchester City won the Second Division title and made important signings in Mike Summerbee and Colin Bell.[25] Two seasons later, in 1967–68, City claimed the league championship for the second time, beating their close neighbours Manchester United to the title on the final day of the season with a 4–3 victory at Newcastle United.[26] Further trophies followed: City won the FA Cup in 1969 and a year later triumphed in the European Cup Winners' Cup, defeating Górnik Zabrze 2–1 in the 1970 final. This was the club's only European honour until their triumph in the 2022–23 UEFA Champions League.[27] The Blues also won the League Cup that year, becoming the second English team to win a European trophy and a domestic trophy in the same season. The club continued to challenge for honours throughout the 1970s, finishing one point behind the league champions on two occasions and reaching the final of the 1974 League Cup.[28] One of the matches from this period that is most fondly remembered by supporters of Manchester City is the final match of the 1973–74 season against arch-rivals Manchester United, who needed to win to have any hope of avoiding relegation. Former United player Denis Law scored with a backheel to give City a 1–0 win at Old Trafford and confirm the relegation of their rivals.[29][30] The final trophy of the club's most successful period of the 20th century was won in 1976, when Newcastle United were beaten 2–1 in the League Cup final. A long period of decline followed the success of the 1960s and 1970s. Malcolm Allison rejoined the club to become manager for the second time in 1979, but squandered large sums of money on several unsuccessful signings, such as Steve Daley.[31] A succession of managers then followed – seven in the 1980s alone. Under John Bond, City reached the 1981 FA Cup final but lost in a replay to Tottenham Hotspur. The club were twice relegated from the top flight in the 1980s (in 1983 and 1987), but returned to the top flight again in 1989 under Mel Machin. Howard Kendall guided the club to top flight safety in 1990 and the club finished fifth in 1991 and 1992 under the management of active player Peter Reid.[32] However, this was only a temporary respite, and following Reid's departure Manchester City's fortunes continued to fade. City were co-founders of the Premier League upon its creation in 1992, but after finishing ninth in its first season, Peter Swales, club chairman since 1973, was replaced by club legend Francis Lee in February 1994 in a movement supported by fans. Despite this, they endured three years of struggle under Brian Horton and Alan Ball Jr. before being relegated in dramatic fashion in 1996. After two seasons in the First Division[a] and four different permanent managers, Lee resigned from his role as chairman midway through the 1998 season, although remained as a shareholder, as City fell to the lowest point in their history, becoming the second ever European trophy winners to be relegated to their country's third-tier league after 1. FC Magdeburg of Germany. After relegation, the club underwent off-the-field upheaval, with new chairman David Bernstein introducing greater fiscal discipline.[33] Under manager Joe Royle, City were promoted at the first attempt, achieved in dramatic fashion in the Second Division play-off final against Gillingham.[34] A second successive promotion saw City return to the top division, but this proved to have been a step too far for the recovering club, and in 2001 City were relegated once more. Kevin Keegan replaced Royle as manager in the close season, and achieved an immediate return to the top division as the club won the 2001–02 First Division championship, breaking club records for the number of points gained and goals scored in a single season in the process.[35] The 2002–03 season was the last at Maine Road and included a 3–1 derby victory over rivals Manchester United, ending a 13-year run without a derby win.[36] Additionally, City qualified for European competition for the first time in 25 years via UEFA fair play ranking. In the close 2003–04 season, the club moved to the new City of Manchester Stadium. The first four seasons at the stadium all resulted in mid-table finishes. Former England manager Sven-Göran Eriksson became the club's first foreign manager when appointed in 2007.[37] After a bright start, performances faded in the second half of the season, and Eriksson was sacked on 2 June 2008;[38] he was replaced by Mark Hughes two days later.[39] By 2008, Manchester City were in a financially precarious position. Thaksin Shinawatra had taken control of the club the year before, but his political travails saw his assets frozen.[40] Then, in August 2008, City were purchased by the Abu Dhabi United Group. The takeover was immediately followed by a flurry of bids for high-profile players; the club broke the British transfer record by signing Brazilian international Robinho from Real Madrid for £32.5 million.[41] There was not a huge improvement in performance compared to the previous season despite the influx of money however, with the team finishing tenth, although they did well to reach the quarter-finals of the UEFA Cup. During the summer of 2009, the club took transfer spending to an unprecedented level, with an outlay of over £100 million on players Gareth Barry, Roque Santa Cruz, Kolo Touré, Emmanuel Adebayor, Carlos Tevez, and Joleon Lescott.[42] In December 2009, Mark Hughes – who had been hired shortly before the change in ownership but was originally retained by the new board – was replaced as manager by Roberto Mancini.[43] City finished the season in fifth position in the Premier League, narrowly missing out on a place in the Champions League but qualifying for the UEFA Europa League.[44] Continued investment in players followed in successive seasons, and results began to match the upturn in player quality. City reached the FA Cup final in 2011, their first major final in over 30 years, after defeating derby rivals Manchester United in the semi-finals,[45] the first time they had knocked their rival out of a cup competition since 1975. The Blues defeated Stoke City 1–0 in the final, securing their fifth FA Cup and the club's first major trophy since winning the 1976 League Cup. On the last day of the 2010–11 season, City beat out Arsenal for the third place, thereby securing qualification directly into the Champions League group stage.[46] Strong performances continued to follow in the 2011–12 season, including a 5–1 victory over Tottenham at White Hart Lane and a record-equalling 6–1 win over Manchester United at Old Trafford, but a poor run of form in the second half of the season left City in second place, eight points behind United with only six games left to play. At this point, United suffered their own loss of form, dropping eight points in the space of four games, while City began a run of successive wins which saw both teams level on points with two games to go. Despite the Blues only needing a home win against Queens Park Rangers, a team in the relegation zone, they fell 1–2 behind by the end of normal time. However, two goals in injury time – the second by Sergio Agüero in the fourth added minute – settled the title in City's favour, making them the first team to win the Premier League on goal difference alone.[47] The following season, City were unable to replicate the previous year's success. After finishing second in the league, eleven points behind Manchester United, and losing the FA Cup final 0–1 to relegated Wigan Athletic,[48] Mancini was sacked.[49] He was replaced by Chilean manager Manuel Pellegrini.[50] In Pellegrini's first year in charge, City won the League Cup and regained the Premier League title on the last matchday of the season.[51][52] The team's league form then slowly declined over the next couple of years, as the Blues finished second in 2014–15 and then dropped to fourth in 2015–16, although the 2015–16 season would see City win another League Cup title and reach the Champions League semi-finals for the first time.[53] Pep Guardiola, former head coach of Barcelona and Bayern Munich, was confirmed to become Manchester City's new manager on 1 February 2016,[54] with the announcement having been made several months before Manuel Pellegrini left his position. Guardiola's first season in Manchester would end trophyless, with the Blues placing third in the league standings,[55] but the following season proved far more successful, as City won the Premier League title with the highest points total in history and broke numerous other club and English league records along the way.[56] This would prove to be the start of a period of unprecedented success for Manchester City under Guardiola. Between the 2017–18 and 2023–24 Premier League seasons, City won six out of possible seven league titles, only finishing second behind Liverpool in the 2019–20 season.[57] Guardiola also guided the Blues to silverware in domestic cup competitions, highlighted by four consecutive League Cup triumphs in 2018–2021.[58] During the 2018–19 season, City completed an unprecedented domestic treble of English men's titles.[59] Apart from winning all three of the major English football tournaments, they also won the Community Shield, the first time any team has ever held all four of England's primary football trophies at the same time.[60] On the continental stage, the club achieved breakthrough in 2020–21, reaching their first-ever Champions League final.[61] In an all-English affair, City lost 0–1 to Chelsea at the Estádio do Dragão in Porto.[62] The 2022–23 season turned out to be the greatest in the club's history, as Manchester City won their third consecutive Premier League title, the FA Cup final against rivals Manchester United, and their maiden Champions League title at the Atatürk Olympic Stadium in Istanbul against Inter Milan, thereby assembling a rare feat – the continental treble. The road to the Champions League victory included wins over European giants Bayern Munich, who were defeated 4–1 on aggregate,[63] and Real Madrid, who suffered a 1–5 aggregate loss at the hands of City.[64][65][66] The following season saw considerably less success for the Blues, as they won the UEFA Super Cup and FIFA Club World Cup for the first time and became the first English men's club to win four consecutive league titles.[67] City also advanced to the FA Cup final for the second straight year but lost in a rematch to rivals Manchester United. Manchester City's era of sustained competitive excellence coincided with charges of breaching Financial Fair Play (FFP) regulations. In 2020, the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) ruled that sanctions placed on the club by UEFA were not justified, overturning City's two-year European ban.[68] In 2023, the Premier League announced its own investigation of the allegations levied against Manchester City, charging the club with 115 breaches of its FFP rules up to the 2017–18 season.[69][70] On 24 November 2024 in the 2024-25 season, City lost 0-4 to Tottenham Hotspur that marked the end of their 52-game unbeaten streak at home. It was the Citizen's first home defeat since November 2022 when Brentford claimed a surprise victory at the same venue. Despite having most of the ball possession and creating 23 attempts at goal, City were made to rue wasteful chances while their opponent on the day converted their chances clinically.[71] Manchester City's home colours are sky blue and white. Traditional away kit colours have been either maroon or (from the 1960s) red and black; however, in recent years several colours have been used. The origins of the club's home colours are unclear, but there is evidence that the club has worn blue since 1892 or earlier. A booklet entitled Famous Football Clubs – Manchester City published in the 1940s indicates that West Gorton (St. Marks) originally played in scarlet and black, and reports dating from 1884 describe the team wearing black jerseys bearing a white cross, showing the club's origins as a church side.[72]: 14–15 The infrequent yet recurrent use of red and black away colours comes from former assistant manager Malcolm Allison's belief that adopting the colours of AC Milan would inspire City to glory.[73] Allison's theory seemingly took effect, with City winning the 1969 FA Cup final, 1970 League Cup final, and 1970 Cup Winners' Cup final in red and black stripes as opposed to the club's home kit of sky blue. City had previously worn three other badges on their shirts, prior to their current badge being implemented in 2016. The first, introduced in 1970, was based on designs which had been used on official club documentation since the mid-1960s. It consisted of a circular badge which used the same shield as the present badge (including a ship, based on the City of Manchester coat of arms), inside a circle bearing the name of the club. In 1972, this was replaced by a variation which replaced the lower half of the shield with the red rose of Lancashire. In 1976, a heraldic badge was granted by the College of Arms to the English Football League for use by City. The badge consisted of the familiar ship above a red rose but on a circular device instead of a shield (blazoned as \"A roundel per fess azure and argent in chief a three masted ship sails set pennons flying or in base a rose gules barbed and seeded proper\").[74] On occasions when Manchester City played in a major cup final, the club wore shirts bearing the City of Manchester coat of arms, as a symbol of pride in representing the city at a major event. This practice originated from a time when the players' shirts did not normally bear a badge of any kind.[75]: 21 The club has since abandoned the practice; for the 2011 FA Cup final, its first in the 21st century, City used the usual badge with a special legend, but the Manchester coat of arms was included as a small monochrome logo in the numbers on the back of players' shirts.[76] A new club badge was adopted in 1997, as a result of the previous badge being ineligible for registration as a trademark. This badge was based on the arms of the city of Manchester, and consisted of a shield in front of a golden eagle. The eagle is an old heraldic symbol of the city of Manchester; a golden eagle was added to the city's badge in 1958 (but had since been removed), representing the growing aviation industry. The shield featured a ship on its upper half representing the Manchester Ship Canal, and three diagonal stripes in the lower half symbolised the city's three rivers – the Irwell, the Irk and the Medlock. The bottom of the badge bore the motto \"Superbia in Proelio\", which translates as \"Pride in Battle\" in Latin. Above the eagle and shield were the three stars, added for decorative purposes. On 15 October 2015, following years of criticism from the fans over the design of the 1997 badge,[77] the club announced they intended to carry out a fan consultation on whether to discontinue the current badge and institute a new design.[77] After the consultation, the club announced in late November 2015 the badge would be replaced in due course by a new version which would be designed in the style of the older, circular variants.[78] A design purporting to be the new badge was unintentionally leaked two days early prior to the official unveiling on 26 December 2015 by the IPO when the design was trademarked on 22 December.[79] The new badge was officially unveiled at Manchester City's home match against Sunderland on 26 December.[80] Note: Flags indicate national team as defined under FIFA eligibility rules; some limited exceptions apply.

Other players (vice-captains) have led the team on the pitch when the club captain is not playing or not available. Some players have been made captain on a one-off basis to celebrate or commemorate an event, e.g. Oleksandr Zinchenko captained the team in their 2021–22 FA Cup fifth round tie at Peterborough United in support of his country during the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine.[89] Each season since the end of the 1966–67 season, the members of the Manchester City Official Supporters Club have voted by ballot to choose the player on the team they feel is the most worthy of recognition for his performances during that season.

Even in the late 1990s, when City were relegated twice in three seasons and playing in the third tier of English football (then the Second Division, now the EFL League One), home attendances were in the region of 30,000, compared to an average of fewer than 8,000 for the division.[127] Research carried out by Manchester City in 2005 estimated a fanbase of 886,000 in the United Kingdom and a total in excess of 2 million worldwide, although since the purchase of the club by Sheikh Mansour, and City's recent achievements, that figure has since ballooned to many times that size.[128] Manchester City's officially recognised supporters club is the Manchester City F.C. Supporters Club (1949), formed by a merger of two existing organisations in 2010: the Official Supporters Club (OSC) and the Centenary Supporters Association (CSA).[129] City fans' song of choice is a rendition of \"Blue Moon\", which despite its melancholic theme is belted out with gusto as though it were a heroic anthem. City supporters tend to believe that unpredictability is an inherent trait of their team, and label unexpected results \"typical City\".[130][131] Events that fans regard as \"typical City\" include the club being the only reigning English champions ever to be relegated (in 1938), the only team to score and concede over 100 goals in the same season (1957–58),[132] or the more recent example where Manchester City were the only team to beat Chelsea in the latter's record-breaking 2004–05 Premier League season, yet in the same season City were knocked out of the FA Cup by Oldham Athletic, a team two divisions lower. In the late 1980s, City fans started a craze of bringing inflatable objects to matches, primarily oversized bananas. One disputed explanation for the phenomenon is that in a match against West Bromwich Albion, chants from fans calling for the introduction of Imre Varadi as a substitute mutated into \"Imre Banana\". Terraces packed with inflatable-waving supporters became a frequent sight in the 1988–89 season, as the craze spread to other clubs (inflatable fish were seen at Grimsby Town), with the craze reaching its peak at City's match at Stoke City on 26 December 1988, a game declared by fanzines as a fancy dress party.[133] In 2010, Manchester City supporters adopted an exuberant dance, dubbed The Poznań, from fans of Polish club Lech Poznań that they played in the Europa League.[134] In 2022, Manchester City proposed the release of the Connected Scarf, that would contain a sensor tracking physiological and emotional data of the wearer, for supporters in 2023.[135] Manchester City's biggest rivalry is with neighbours Manchester United, against whom they contest the Manchester derby. Before the Second World War, when travel to away games was rare, many Mancunian football fans regularly watched both teams even if considering themselves \"supporters\" of only one. This practice continued into the early 1960s but as travel became easier, and the cost of entry to matches rose, watching both teams became unusual and the rivalry intensified. A common stereotype is that City fans come from Manchester proper, while United fans come from elsewhere. A 2002 report by a researcher at Manchester Metropolitan University found that while it was true that a higher proportion of City season ticket holders came from Manchester postcode areas (40% compared to United's 29%), there were more United season ticket holders, the lower percentage being due to United's higher overall number of season ticket holders (27,667 compared to City's 16,481). The report noted that since the compiling of data in 2001, the number of both City and United season ticket holders had risen; expansion of United's ground and City's move to the City of Manchester Stadium have caused season ticket sales to increase further.[136] Over the last few years, Manchester City has also developed a notable rivalry with Liverpool,[137] currently considered one of the biggest in association football.[138][139] Though the two clubs had been involved in a title race in the 1976–77 season, Liverpool and City's modern rivalry began in the 2010s, with the Blues beating Liverpool to the 2013–14 title by just two points on the final day of the season.[140] In the final of the 2015–16 League Cup, City defeated Liverpool on penalties after a 1–1 draw. The two clubs met in European competition for the first time in the 2017–18 Champions League quarter-finals, where Liverpool won 5–1 on aggregate, ultimately reaching the final and then winning the competition a year later.[141][142] In the 2018–19 season, City again won the title on the final day, with the Blues' 98 points and Liverpool's 97 being the third- and fourth-highest Premier League points totals ever.[143] The following season, Liverpool clinched the title, recording 99 points (the second-highest Premier League total ever after Manchester City's 100 in 2017–18) to finish 18 points above runners-up City. The Blues then regained the title in 2020–21 and outgunned Liverpool in another closely-fought title race in 2021–22, to finish with 93 points to Liverpool's 92. The success of the two teams in the 2010s and 2020s has led to the development of a rivalry between Jürgen Klopp and Pep Guardiola, the managers of Liverpool and Manchester City, with the two previously having been the respective managers of Der Klassiker rivals Borussia Dortmund and Bayern Munich in the Bundesliga.[144] At the end of the 2018–19 season, Guardiola described his relationship with Klopp as a \"beautiful rivalry\" and called Klopp's Liverpool team \"the strongest opponents I have faced in my career as a manager\".[145][146] In September 2019, Klopp hailed Guardiola for being his 'greatest rival ever', after both were nominated for the FIFA Men's Coach of the Year award in 2019, which Klopp ultimately won.[147][148] In a 2019 survey, City fans answered that Liverpool, and not Manchester United, are the club's biggest rivals.[149] Manchester City also have long established local rivalries with Bolton Wanderers, Oldham Athletic, and Stockport County, and more recent competitive Premier League rivalries with Tottenham Hotspur, Chelsea and Arsenal.[150][151][152] The holding company of Manchester City F.C., Manchester City Limited, is a private limited company, with approximately 54 million shares in issue. The club has been in private hands since 2007, when the major shareholders agreed to sell their holdings to UK Sports Investments Limited (UKSIL), a company controlled by former Thailand prime minister Thaksin Shinawatra. UKSIL then made a formal offer to buy the shares held by several thousands of small shareholders. Prior to the Thaksin takeover, the club was listed on the specialist independent equity market PLUS (formerly OFEX),[153] where it had been listed since 1995. On 6 July 2007, having acquired 75% of the shares, Thaksin de-listed the club and re-registered it as a private company.[154] By August, UKSIL had acquired over 90% of the shares and exercised its rights under the Companies Act to \"squeeze out\" the remaining shareholders, and acquire the entire shareholding. Thaksin Shinawatra became chairman of the club and two of Thaksin's children, Pintongta and Oak Chinnawat became directors. Former chairman John Wardle stayed on the board for a year, but resigned in July 2008 following Nike executive Garry Cook's appointment as executive chairman in May.[155] The club made a pre-tax loss of £11m in the fiscal year ending 31 May 2007, the final year for which the club published accounts as a public company.[156] Thaksin's purchase prompted a period of transfer spending at the club,[157] in total around £30 million,[158] whereas over the several previous seasons Manchester City's net spending had been among the lowest in the Premier League. A year later, this investment was dwarfed by an influx of money derived from the club's takeover. On 1 September 2008, Abu Dhabi-based Abu Dhabi United Group Investment and Development Limited completed the takeover of Manchester City. The deal, worth a reported £200 million, was announced on the morning of 1 September. It sparked various transfer \"deadline-day\" rumours and bids such as the club's attempt to gazump Manchester United's protracted bid to sign Dimitar Berbatov from Tottenham Hotspur for a fee in excess of £30 million.[159][160] Minutes before the transfer window closed, the club signed Robinho from Real Madrid for a British record transfer fee of £32.5 million.[161] The wealth of the new owners meant that, in the summer of 2009, City were able to finance the purchase of experienced international players prior to the new season, spending more than any other club in the Premier League.[162] Created in the 2013–14 season to manage the global footballing interests of the Abu Dhabi United Group, City Football Group (CFG) is an umbrella corporation owning stakes in a network of global clubs for the purposes of resource sharing, academy networking and marketing. In addition to Manchester City, City Football Group owns stakes in a number of clubs: The City of Manchester Stadium in east Manchester, known as the Etihad Stadium since 2011 for sponsorship reasons, is on a 200-year lease from Manchester City Council to Manchester City. It has been the club's home since the end of the 2002–03 season, when City moved from Maine Road.[177] Before moving to the stadium, the club spent in excess of £30 million to convert it to football use: the pitch was lowered, adding another tier of seating around it, and a new North Stand was constructed.[178] The inaugural match at the new stadium was a 2–1 win over Barcelona in a friendly match.[179] A 7,000-seat third tier on the South Stand was completed in time for the start of the 2015–16 football season, increasing the stadium's capacity to 55,097. A North Stand third tier is in development, potentially increasing capacity to around 61,000.[180] After playing home matches at five stadiums between 1880 and 1887, the club settled at Hyde Road Football Stadium, its home for 36 years.[181] A fire destroyed the Main Stand in 1920, and the club moved to the 84,000 capacity Maine Road three years later. Maine Road, nicknamed the \"Wembley of the North\" by its designers, hosted the largest-ever crowd at an English club ground when 84,569 attended an FA Cup tie against Stoke City on 3 March 1934.[182] Though Maine Road was redeveloped several times over its 80-year lifespan, by 1995 its capacity was restricted to 32,000, prompting the search for a new ground which culminated in the move to the City of Manchester Stadium in 2003; it was renamed the Etihad Stadium in 2011.[183] In September 2024, Manchester City revealed plans to expand the North Stand of the Etihad Stadium, increasing the total capacity to 61,000. The expanded section is scheduled to open for the start of the 2025/26 season. The project also includes the construction of a hotel, office premises for club staff and a new fan zone .[184] Based on trophy count, Manchester City are one of the most successful teams in England – their thirty-six major domestic, European and worldwide honours rank them third on the list of most decorated sides in England, ahead of Chelsea with 34. The club's first major trophy was the 1904 FA Cup,[185] though they had previously won three regional Manchester Cups before that point.[186] Their first top division league title came in the 1936–37 season,[15] with the first Charity Shield won in the following August.[15] City's first League Cup and European trophy both came at the end of the 1969–70 season, the two trophies also constituting the team's first double of any kind.[15] In the 2018–19 season, City became the first team to claim all of the major English trophies available in a single season, winning not just the Premier League, FA Cup, and League Cup, but also the Community Shield.[187] The 1970 Cup Winners' Cup victory remained City's only European trophy until their triumph in the 2022–23 UEFA Champions League.[188][66] They have reached the semi-finals of the Champions League four times overall, losing in 2016, then winning en route to their first-ever final in 2021, losing in 2022, and winning en route to their maiden European Cup title in 2023.[189][190] Manchester City jointly held the record for most second division titles with Leicester City, both clubs having won the league on seven occasions, before Leicester clinched their eighth title in 2023–24.[191] Man City's first victory was in 1898–99, and the most recent in 2001–02.[15]",

                "content": "The Toledo Rockets football team is a college football program in Division I FBS, representing the University of Toledo. The Rockets compete in the Mid-American Conference. Toledo began playing football in 1917, although it did not field teams in 1931, 1943, 1944, and 1945. Since the inception of the AP Poll in 1936, Toledo has finished in the Top 25 four times with its highest finish coming in 1970 when it ranked No. 12 after finishing 12–0. Toledo has a 12-10 record in bowl games. The Rockets were the 2017 MAC champions. The team's head coach is Jason Candle. Toledo first fielded a football team in 1917, under the leadership of John Brandeberry. According to Toledo Rockets lore, the team began when a group of students purchased uniforms from a sporting goods store, then arranged a game against the University of Detroit in order to settle the debt. Brandeberry stepped in to coach the team, which promptly lost the game 145–0 (but settled the debt).[2] For the first few years Toledo played without a nickname, but was dubbed the \"Rockets\" after two long touchdown runs in a 1923 loss to Carnegie Tech. That season also saw Toledo win its first conference title.[2] Clarence Spears served as the Rocket's head coach and athletics director for seven seasons, from 1936 to 1942. Under his tutelage, the Rockets compiled a record of 38–26–2. which included five consecutive winning seasons.[3] In two seasons, the Rockets compiled a record of 11–10 under head coach Skip Stahley.[4] Forrest England served as Toledo's head coach for two seasons in 1954 and 1955, compiling a record of 9–7–2.[5] In April 1930, Toledo hired Jim Nicholson to become the Rockets first full-time football coach. With his upgraded schedule and organized recruiting, Nicholson helped build UT's team into a powerful and respected program. In his final season, the Rockets finished 6–2–1, including a 63–0 win over rival team Bowling Green. The huge win led to a 13-year break in the rivalry between the two schools. Nicholson help design the Glass Bowl stadium, and continued to be involved in the school's athletics following his retirement by reorganizing the Varsity 'T' Club. He finished his career as the Rocket's head coach with a 20-16-4 record.[6] Clarence Spears continued to help the UT football program grow following Nicholson, with 38 career victories that stood as a UT record for 30 years before being surpassed by Frank Lauterbur's mark of 48 wins. In 1942 when UT's football program was suspended due to WWII, Spears left to take the head coaching job at Maryland. His overall record as head coach for the Rockets was 38–26–2.[6] Although head coach for the Rockets for just two seasons, Bill Orwig established one of the best winning percentages in the program's history (.762). He is one of few coaches in UT to coach two sports at once, overseeing both the football and basketball teams. His overall record as football coach was 15–4–2.[6] Affectionately known at \"FXL\" by his team, Frank Lauterbur coached the Rockets during one of the most successful eras of the program's history. Under his leadership, Toledo won three MAC titles including the first in the school history in 1967, and won both of their two consecutive Tangerine Bowl appearances. The team's 35 consecutive game wins during Lauterbur's era ranks fifth in the longest winning streaks in NCAA Division I football. Charles \"Chuck\" Ealey led the Rockets to all 35 victories as starting quarterback, the most wins without a loss by a quarterback in FBS history. In 1970, the Rockets finished the season ranked 12th in the AP Poll and 17th in the UPI poll. After capping that season with a second Tangerine Bowl victory, Lauterbur took a head coaching job at Iowa. His overall 48–32–2 record at UT includes two perfect seasons in 1969 and 1970.[6] Jack Murphy, an assistant under Frank Lauterbur and coach of Heidelberg, took over as head coach for the Rockets in 1971. In his first season, he led the Rockets to an undefeated 12–0 record, a MAC Championship title, a third consecutive Tangerine Bowl win, and a 14th ranking in the year's final AP poll. That was also the year Toledo's famed winning streak reached 35 games, a streak begun under former coach Lauterbur. Murphy led the Rockets to a 35–32 record before his departure in 1976.[6] Chuck Stobart held the head coaching position for five seasons, rebuilding the Rockets into a stronger program and premier MAC conference contender. He earned MAC \"Coach of the Year\" honors in 1979 and 1981. In 1981, he led UT to a 9–3 record, a MAC Championship title, and a memorable 27–25 victory over San Jose State in the California Bowl that was decided on a last-second field goal by Tony Lee. Stobart left UT to become the head coach at Utah in 1981, departing with an overall 24–31–1 record with the Rockets.[6] Dan Simrell took over the UT football program after Stobart's departure, going on to coach through eight seasons with a total of 50 victories, the third-most wins of any coach in the program's history. In 1984 with a 9–2–1 record, he led UT to a Mid-American Conference title and a California Bowl appearance. A native of Toledo, Simrell was the first UT alum to coach the football team. He lettered as a quarterback from 1962 to 1964 and served as an assistant coach from 1971 to 1981. Overall, Simrell posted four winning seasons of his total eight as head coach, with an overall 50–37–2 record. He resigned following the 1989 season.[6] Nick Saban was head coach of the Rockets for one season, leading Toledo to a 9–2 record and a MAC co-championship in 1990. The two games the Rockets lost that season were by narrow margins: one point to Central Michigan, and four points to Navy.[7] While at the helm of the Rockets, Saban turned down an application of Urban Meyer, who was looking for a job on his staff as an assistant coach.[8] Saban left Toledo after the 1990 season to become the NFL's Cleveland Browns defensive coordinator under Bill Belichick,[9] and later head coaching positions at Michigan State (1995–1999), LSU (2000–2004), the NFL's Miami Dolphins (2005–2006) and Alabama. Gary Pinkel came to Toledo from his post as offensive coordinator at Washington.[10] With an overall record of 73–37–3, he has the most wins in UT history. He also has the second best winning percentage (.659) among UT coaches who led the program for at least four years. Pinkel led the 1995 Rockets to an 11–0–1 record, a Las Vegas Bowl victory, and end of season rankings in the Top 25 of both the AP poll and Coaches poll. In 1997, Pinkel's Rockets took the first-ever MAC West title and appeared in the MAC Championship game. The Rockets finished the season 9–3, with a mid-season ranking high of 18 in the AP poll. They repeated as MAC West champions in the following 1998 season. In Pinkel's final season in 2000, the Rockets went 10–1, including a 24–6 victory over the Penn State Nittany Lions[11] and a 25th-place ranking in the final regular season polls. Following that season, Pinkel took a head coaching position at Missouri.[12] He's been inducted into four college football halls of fame: Toledo, Kent State (his alma mater), the Mid-American Conference,[6] and the Missouri Hall of Fame (in two categories) Known as \"Toledo Tom\", Tom Amstutz led the Rockets to some of the greatest successes, including two MAC Championships, four MAC West titles, and four bowl game appearances. A native of Toledo and former Rocket player himself, was promoted from defensive coordinator, a post he held under Saban and Pinkel, to the Rockets head coach after Pinkel's departure.[13] During his eight seasons as head coach, Amstutz led the Rockets to impressive victories over No. 9 Pittsburgh, Minnesota, Kansas, and Iowa State. Perhaps the greatest though was a 13–10 defeat in 2008 against the Michigan Wolverines in Ann Arbor.[14] The Rockets are the first and only MAC football team to beat Michigan. Amstutz resigned as head coach following the 2008 season.[15] His final record as head coach was 58–41, including victories at the 2001 Motor City Bowl and 2005 GMAC Bowl.[6] In December 2008, Toledo hired Oklahoma State defensive coordinator Tim Beckman as the new head coach for the Rockets.[16] He revived the football program, leading the team through consecutive winning seasons with two bowl appearances and one MAC West Division co-championship. In 2011, the team earned an appearance in the Military Bowl. Beckman resigned at the end of the regular season before the bowl game to take on a head coaching position at the University of Illinois.[17] His record at Toledo is 21–16.[6] Named interim head coach following Tim Beckman's departure for Illinois, Matt Campbell made his debut as the Rockets coach with a 42–41 victory over Air Force in the 2011 Military Bowl.[18] At 32 years old, he was the youngest FBS coach at the time, and went on to enjoy four winning seasons and an overall record of 35–15. The team saw big victories along the way with a win over No. 18 Cincinnati in 2012 and a 2015 upset of No. 18 Arkansas in Little Rock, Toledo's first win over an SEC team.[19] They also went on to a bowl victory over Arkansas State in the 2015 GoDaddy Bowl. Campbell resigned as head coach at the end of the 2015 regular season to accept a head coaching job at Iowa State.[20] Initially planning to following Matt Campbell to Iowa State for an assistant coaching position, Jason Candle changed course and quickly returned to Toledo after the Rockets offered him the head coaching position.[21] Like his predecessor, his first game as head coach was a bowl victory, with the Rockets defeating No. 24 Temple in the 2015 Boca Raton Bowl.[22] In 2017, the Rockets defeated Western Michigan to become the outright MAC West Division champions for the first time since 1998, and their first trip to the MAC Championship since 2004.[23] Toledo went on to defeat Akron 45–28 and win its first MAC Championship in 13 years.[24] In 2022, the Rockets defeated Ball State and Western Michigan lost to Northern Illinois to become the MAC West Division co-champions with Eastern Michigan. Toledo beat Eastern Michigan early in the season so the Rockets had the tie-breaker. Toledo went on to defeat Ohio 17–7 in the MAC Championship. Toledo has been both independent and affiliated with multiple conferences.[25]: 192 The Rockets have won 15 conference titles, with 12 of them being during their affiliation with the Mid-American Conference.[25]: 195–204 The Rockets have won 13 division titles. † Co-champions Toledo has appeared in 22 NCAA-sanctioned post-season bowl games since 1969, and has an 12–10 record overall.[26] Other Football Facilities: Toledo and Bowling Green have a rivalry, nicknamed \"The Battle of I-75\", dating back to 1924, when BGSU challenged the participation of Toledo's captain, Gilbert Stick, after it was discovered that Stick also played for a local team in Genoa, Ohio. Conference rules did not prohibit such play, and BGSU's protest was overruled.[2] In 1950, Toledo's athletic director charged BGSU students a higher price for tickets at a basketball game than the general public, while rumors spread of a dog-napping attempt by BGSU against Toledo's mascot.[28] Another incident came in 1951, when a fight broke out after a hard hit by a BGSU player on fullback Mel Triplett. Don Greenwood, then Toledo's coach, participated, and resigned after the university failed to back him up. In Greenwood's view, the officials should have called a penalty for excessive roughness, and he had a duty to protect his players.[2] Four players in the history of the University of Toledo have had their jersey numbers retired.[6] Announced schedules as of August 11, 2024.[29]",

                "content": "Caleb Sequan Williams (born November 18, 2001) is an American professional football quarterback for the Chicago Bears of the National Football League (NFL). Following one season of college football with the Oklahoma Sooners, he played for the USC Trojans and won the Heisman Trophy in 2022 after setting single-season school records in passing yards and touchdowns. Williams was selected first overall by the Bears in the 2024 NFL draft. Williams was born on November 18, 2001, in Washington, D.C., later attending Gonzaga College High School, where he played high school football.[1][2] As a sophomore in 2018, he led Gonzaga to a WCAC Championship as the best team in the District, and was named Washington Post All-Metropolitan 1st team and Washington, D.C. Gatorade Football Player of the Year after he passed for 2,624 passing yards with 26 touchdowns and rushed for 394 yards and 10 touchdowns.[3] As a junior in 2019, he was named Washington Post All-Metropolitan 1st team for the second consecutive year after he passed for 1,770 yards with 19 touchdowns and rushed for 838 yards with 18 touchdowns. He was named the Elite 11 finals MVP the following summer.[4] In 2020, his senior season was cancelled due to COVID-19.[5] The highest-rated quarterback prospect of his class, Williams committed to play college football at the University of Oklahoma.[6][7][8] Williams entered his true freshman season with the Oklahoma Sooners in 2021 as the backup to Spencer Rattler,[9][10] before assuming the role as starting quarterback midway through the Sooners' rivalry game with the Texas Longhorns in the team's sixth game of the season.[11] In that game, Oklahoma was down 35–17 before Williams replaced Rattler and led the Sooners to a 55–48 victory.[12] He finished with 212 passing yards, two passing touchdowns, 88 yards rushing, and a rushing touchdown.[13] Williams made his first start the following week, against Texas Christian University, and threw for 295 yards, four touchdowns, and rushed for 66 yards and a rushing touchdown as Oklahoma won 52–31.[14] Williams finished his freshman year with 21 passing touchdowns, six rushing touchdowns, and four interceptions in seven games.[15] On January 3, 2022, Williams entered the transfer portal, and on February 1, he announced that he had transferred to the University of Southern California to play for the Trojans, reuniting him with head coach Lincoln Riley, who had been the head coach for the Sooners before being hired away by the Trojans the previous November.[16][17] Williams was named the starter on August 25[18] and team captain on August 31.[19] In his first start against Rice, he went 19/22 with 249 yards and two touchdowns, as USC won 66–14.[20] He became the AP College Football Player of the Year, USC's first winner since Reggie Bush in 2005,[21] and was named the 2022 Heisman Trophy winner.[22] His 42 passing touchdowns led the NCAA.[23] Williams and the Trojans went 7–5 in 2023 during the regular season, throwing for 3,333 yards with 31 passing and 11 rushing touchdowns.[24][25] He declared for the 2024 NFL draft following the season, finishing his college career throwing for nearly 10,000 yards with 120 total touchdowns.[26] As is the school's tradition for Heisman winners, his number 13 was retired by USC in 2024.[27] Williams was selected first overall by the Chicago Bears in the 2024 NFL draft. The Bears traded the previous year's first overall selection to the Carolina Panthers to acquire the pick used on Williams, also acquring D.J. Moore and several other selections in the said trade.[30] He was one of six quarterbacks taken in the first round, tied with the 1983 draft for the most in NFL history.[31] Williams was named the starter in May.[32] He signed his four-year rookie contract, worth $39.4 million fully guaranteed, on July 17, 2024.[33][34] As his college number 13 was taken by Keenan Allen, Williams switched to his high school number 18 in the NFL; the announcement was made less than half an hour after his draft selection.[35] Williams' draft night merchandise sales value broke a Fanatics record.[36] Williams was the first quarterback selected first overall to win their season-opening NFL debut since 2002, completing 14-of-29 passes for 93 yards with no touchdowns or turnovers in a 24–17 win against the Tennessee Titans.[37] Williams recorded his first two career touchdowns and set the Bears' single-game rookie passing record with 363 yards in a 21–16 loss to the Indianapolis Colts in Week 3.[38] After a 1–2 start, Williams led victories over the Los Angeles Rams and Carolina Panthers, throwing for over 300 yards and two touchdowns against Carolina, becoming the first Bears rookie quarterback with multiple 300+ yard games.[39] In Week 6 in London, Williams threw four touchdown passes in a 35–16 victory over the Jacksonville Jaguars, leading Chicago to their first three-game win streak since 2020 heading into the bye week.[40] In Week 8 against the Washington Commanders, Williams led a late go-ahead touchdown drive, but the Bears lost on a last-second Hail Mary, later dubbed the Madhouse in Maryland.[41] Chicago’s struggles continued with back-to-back losses to the Arizona Cardinals and New England Patriots. The Bears offense failed to score a touchdown and Williams was sacked 15 times, marking the first time since 2004 that Chicago did not score a touchdown in consecutive games.[42][43] Williams ended his four-game touchdown drought in a Week 12 overtime loss to the Minnesota Vikings, throwing for 340 yards, two touchdowns, and setting the Bears' rookie passing yards record.[44] On Thanksgiving against the Detroit Lions, Williams threw three touchdowns and set a rookie record for consecutive passes without an interception, but poor late-game clock management cost the Bears a chance at a comeback as they lost their sixth straight game, resulting in the firing of head coach Matt Eberflus the following day.[45][46]",

                "content": "Todd Andrew McLellan (born October 3, 1967) is a Canadian professional ice hockey coach and former player who currently serves as head coach of the Detroit Red Wings of the National Hockey League (NHL). He previously served as head coach of the San Jose Sharks, Edmonton Oilers, and Los Angeles Kings, and as an assistant coach with the Red Wings, with whom he won the Stanley Cup in 2008. He was drafted in 1986 by the New York Islanders and played five games with the major league club in the 1987–88 season before retiring in the minors the following season due to recurring injury. After living in Goodeve, Saskatchewan, and Melville, Saskatchewan, during his childhood, McLellan started his playing career with the Saskatoon Blades of the Western Hockey League (WHL) from 1983 to 1987. In the 1986 NHL Entry Draft, he was drafted by the New York Islanders in the fifth round. He played a total of five games at the NHL level, spending most of two seasons with the Islanders' American Hockey League (AHL) affiliate, the Springfield Indians. However, recurring shoulder injuries dating back to his junior hockey days ended McLellan's North American playing career after the 1988–89 season. He scored his only NHL goal on his league debut on December 28, 1987, in a 6-4 loss to the New Jersey Devils. He returned home to study at the University of Saskatchewan for a year, before resuming his playing career for S.IJ. Utrecht of the Eredivisie in the Netherlands. During his three seasons there, the team hired a new coach, who moved in with McLellan and made him a player-coach, which McLellan recognizes as why he became interested in coaching.[1] Following his stint as a player-coach with SIJ Utrecht, McLellan returned to Canada in 1992. He went into full-time coaching in 1993, being hired as the coach of the North Battleford North Stars of the Saskatchewan Junior League. In 1994, McLellan was hired as the head coach and general manager of the Swift Current Broncos of the WHL, where he succeeded Graham James. In his six seasons with Swift Current, the Broncos qualified for the WHL playoffs in all seasons. McLellan himself was named WHL Executive of the Year in 1997 and Coach of the Year in 2000.[1] Following his successes at the junior level, McLellan was hired by the expansion Minnesota Wild to coach their minor league affiliate, the Cleveland Lumberjacks of the International Hockey League (IHL). After the IHL folded in 2001, McLellan and his staff were transferred to the Wild's new minor league affiliate, the Houston Aeros of the AHL. As coach of the Aeros, McLellan led Houston to the Calder Cup in 2003.[1] In 2005, Mike Babcock selected McLellan to serve as his assistant with the Detroit Red Wings. In Detroit, McLellan was tasked with handling the Red Wings' forwards and managing the team's power play, as well as reporting player performance to head coach Babcock. Under his watch, the Red Wings had the top-ranked power play in the NHL, finishing first in power play efficiency in 2005–06 and third in 2007–08. As a member of the coaching staff, McLellan won his first Stanley Cup with the Red Wings in 2007–08.[1] On June 11, 2008, the San Jose Sharks hired McLellan to become their new head coach, replacing Ron Wilson.[2] He would end up the head coach for the Western Conference All-Star team, and lead the Sharks to their first Presidents' Trophy with an NHL-leading 117 points to finish the regular season, and finished third in voting for that season's Jack Adams Award, behind winner Claude Julien and Andy Murray. On March 14, 2013, with a 4–3 victory over the Los Angeles Kings, McLellan became the winningest coach in Sharks history with 207 victories.[3] On February 5, 2014, against the Dallas Stars, McLellan tied Darryl Sutter for the most games coached in Sharks history with 434.[4] After the team missed the playoffs in the 2014–15 season, McLellan and the Sharks agreed to mutually part ways on April 20, ending his tenure as the Sharks' winningest coach.[5] He coached the Canadian national team at the 2015 World Championship, where the team won the title for the first time since 2007 with a perfect 10–0 record.[6] On May 19, 2015, he was named head coach of the Edmonton Oilers, becoming the 14th head coach in team history. He succeeded Todd Nelson, who took over on an interim basis after Dallas Eakins was fired. At the time of his signing, McLellan became the highest-paid coach in NHL history, earning around $3 million per season.[7] However, he would hold the distinction for exactly one day, as McLellan's former colleague Mike Babcock signed an eight-year contract with the Toronto Maple Leafs worth around $6.25 million per season on May 20.[8][9] McLellan's first season in Edmonton was a rebuilding one. The Oilers finished with 70 points, the second-worst record in the league. However, the following season—the first in the team's new arena, Rogers Place—saw a dramatic turnaround. The Oilers tallied over 100 points for the first time since the 1980s dynasty years. On March 28, 2017, the Oilers defeated the Los Angeles Kings 2–1 to make the playoffs for the first time in 11 years. They also earned home-ice advantage in a playoff series for the first time since winning their last Cup in 1990. They upended McLellan's old team, the Sharks, in six games to win a playoff series for only the sixth time since 1990. On November 20, 2018, McLellan was fired by the Oilers and replaced by Ken Hitchcock after posting a record of 9–10–1.[10][11] On April 16, 2019, the Los Angeles Kings named McLellan head coach.[12] On February 2, 2024, he was fired, despite signing a one-year contract extension nearly four months prior that would have kept him behind the bench through the 2024–25 season.[13] Before his firing, Los Angeles stumbled after a strong 20–7–4 start to the season, losing 14 of McLellan's final 17 games with a 3–8–6 record.[14][15] On December 26, 2024, McLellan returned to the Red Wings, with the team hiring him as head coach after the dismissal of Derek Lalonde.[16] In 1992, McLellan married his wife Debbie. They have two sons, Tyson and Cale.[1]",

The 57-year-old, who signed a multiyear contract, replaces Derek Lalonde, who was fired after three seasons. \"I've never been in this situation before,\" McLellan said Friday. \"I've been the guy kicked out the door, unfortunately, but I've never come in at this time. I know I can't overreact, over teach and over meet with the players - it would just be too much.\" McLellan, who coached the Los Angeles Kings last season before being fired on Feb. 2, is 598-412-134 in 1,144 regular-season games with the San Jose Sharks, Edmonton Oilers and Kings, and 42-46 in 88 Stanley Cup Playoff games. He ranks sixth among active coaches in wins, behind Paul Maurice (891), Lindy Ruff (876), Peter Laviolette (823), John Tortorella (757) and Pete DeBoer (632).

McLellan was also an assistant coach with the Red Wings from 2005-08, winning the Stanley Cup with them in 2008. The Red Wings also fired associate coach Bob Boughner on Thursday and named Trent Yawney an assistant. He served in the same role under McLellan with the Kings from 2019-24. \"It's been a frustrating start to the season, we're just missing something,\" Red Wings captain Dylan Larkin said. \"This is something you don't want to happen. I really like Derek and 'Boogs' as guys, but it felt like something needed to happen.

Entering Thursday, the Red Wings ranked 29th in goals per game (2.56), 25th in goals against per game (3.26) and 31st on the penalty kill (68.8 percent). The Red Wings have not made the playoffs since the 2015-16 season. The eight-season playoff drought is the longest in team history and followed 25 straight seasons of qualifying for the postseason. Detroit finished tied in points with the Washington Capitals for the second wild card from the Eastern Conference last season but lost on a tiebreaker. \"It is never a good thing when a coach is released and a new one comes in, and the timing on this is awkward too,\" McLellan said Friday. \"Because of Christmas and stuff, we don't get a practice and we're going to play hockey tonight. Trent Yawney and Todd McLellan aren't coming in here and waving a wand to change the forecheck, the neutral zone system, the D-zone coverage and the power play. We just don't have time. What we've asked the players is to play harder, play faster and play a little bit smarter. \"It's going to take Trent and I five, six or seven games to really figure out individuals, and it will take them that long to figure us out. Everyone is going to play while we figure that out and then we can take a look and see where we are.\" Lalonde is the fourth NHL coach fired this season, joining Jim Montgomery (Boston Bruins, Nov. 19), Drew Bannister (St. Louis Blues, Nov. 24) and Luke Richardson (Chicago Blackhawks, Dec. 5).

McLellan said Yzerman finally called, and he flew from Christmas in Toronto to Los Angeles to get suits and his belongings. pic.twitter.com/Tp8UJ1MdRt \"Good coaches don't just bring their suitcases to work and force it on the players.

                "content": "Editions: En/lifestyle/us-news/personal-finance A guide for shoppers looking to make big savings from laptops to cosmetics Boxing Day, December 26, has become a major shopping event in the United States, allowing shoppers to enjoy fantastic post-holiday deals. While often associated with Canada and the United Kingdom, Boxing Day sales in the United States have gained popularity, making it a great opportunity for shoppers to find discounts in various categories. Boxing Day, held annually on December 26, is one of the biggest shopping events of the year in Australia. Originally, in the UK it was a day for employers to give gifts to their staff, but it has since become an important occasion to get discounts and amazing deals. The highly anticipated 2024 Boxing Day sales are already underway, with major retailers offering irresistible early deals. This year's sales, traditionally a post-Christmas shopping frenzy, have started early, with big names such as Amazon, Currys and John Lewis offering discounts on a wide range of products. From electronics to fashion, home appliances and beauty products, shoppers can expect incredible deals as retailers look to cash in on the holiday season frenzy. Some stores offer up to 70% off, so global shoppers can use these deals to find unique items that are not available in their home country. In recent years, retailers have stopped limiting sales to Boxing Day itself and have opted to start their discounts early. This year is no exception. With prices slashed to match or even surpass Black Friday deals, the early Boxing Day offers give shoppers the chance to bag big savings without having to wait until December 26. Popular categories like laptops, TVs, headphones and appliances are already experiencing significant price cuts, making this the perfect time to buy last-minute Christmas gifts or treat yourself to that long-awaited upgrade. Here's a summary of the best early deals from some of the most popular retailers, as mentioned in a Tech Radar report: Amazon: massive discounts across all categories, from electronics to household essentials and last-minute Christmas gifts. Currys: up to 30% off laptops, TVs and headphones, with deals on trusted brands. John Lewis: premium discounts on fashion, home decor and technology, with its renowned price matching guarantee. Boots: beauty products, fragrances and baby essentials are available at attractive prices. Dell and HP: special offers on laptops, desktops and accessories for tech enthusiasts. Samsung: price cuts on smartphones, TVs and kitchen appliances. Furniture Village: discounts on decoration, furniture and top quality furniture. Other notable participants include JD Sports, New Look and Urban Outfitters, which are offering up to 80% off clothing and accessories. Tech deals to consider Electronics remain a firm favourite category during the Boxing Day sales, and the early 2024 deals do not disappoint. Currys and Laptops Direct have slashed prices on popular laptop models, while Jessops is offering attractive discounts on cameras and drones. Gaming enthusiasts can explore CDKeys for Christmas sale deals on games, while Ebuyer and Scan cater to PC builders with reduced prices on computer components, according to Tech Radar's report. Fashion and lifestyle deals Fashion retailers such as H&M, Boohoo and Next are offering up to 80% off clothing, with a wide range of options for men, women and children. Beauty enthusiasts can head to Lush and Boots for skincare, bath products and luxury fragrances at reduced prices. © Unidad Editorial Información Deportiva, S.L.U. All rights reserved. Follow us",

                "content": "Boxing Day’s evolving role in the retail calendar underscores the broader changes sweeping the ... [+] industry. Retailers can no longer rely solely on traditional sales periods to drive footfall and revenue. Instead, they must innovate by offering seamless online experiences, meaningful collaborations, and engaging campaigns that resonate with today’s shoppers.(Photo by Mario Tama/Getty Images) Boxing Day has traditionally been synonymous with bustling high streets and eager bargain hunters, but the latest data reveals a noticeable shift. Footfall across UK retail destinations was down according to data gathered by MRI Software which showed footfall on UK high streets down 6.2% on 2023, while shopping centres saw a 4.2% fall in visitors. In contrast to previous years, many major retailers, including Next and Aldi, chose to keep their doors closed on Boxing Day. While these decisions are often framed as giving staff time off during the holidays, they also highlight deeper changes in the profitability of operating physical stores on this iconic retail day. With fewer shoppers venturing out, the costs of opening stores no longer guarantee the return they once did. At the same time, the rise of online shopping continues to reshape the festive retail landscape. Many consumers have shifted their spending habits, taking advantage of discounts that began as early as October and extended through Black Friday and December. This extended sales period has softened the traditional excitement of post-Christmas discounts, with many opting to shop from the comfort of home. Retailers have responded, with many offering Boxing Day deals online as early as Christmas Day, further reducing the need to visit physical stores. Despite the drop in footfall, total retail spending on Boxing Day is expected to reach billions this year, according to Barclays, which says it sees nearly 40% of the nation's credit and debit card transactions. It forecasts that Brits will spend a combined total of £4.6bn on Boxing Day, compared with £4.7bn spent in 2023. This growth is driven by the continued dominance of online sales, which now account for a significant portion of holiday spending. Data shows that a majority of shoppers completed a large portion of their Christmas shopping digitally, favouring convenience and accessibility over the traditional in-store experience. Consumers’ changing behaviors are also reshaping what they value in their purchases. The focus has shifted from simply finding bargains to seeking products that offer exclusivity, relevance, or sustainability. For example, partnerships and licensing deals tied to cultural phenomena—such as the enduring popularity of Wicked—have proven successful. Products that resonate emotionally with shoppers or tap into cultural moments often command full price, offering a rare antidote to the relentless discount culture. The growing popularity of recommerce also reflects these changing priorities. Shoppers are increasingly embracing resale platforms and secondhand marketplaces, drawn by their affordability, individuality, and sustainability credentials. This trend, particularly popular among younger generations, offers retailers new opportunities to engage eco-conscious consumers while extending the lifecycle of their products. Boxing Day’s evolving role in the retail calendar underscores the broader changes sweeping the industry. Retailers can no longer rely solely on traditional sales periods to drive footfall and revenue. Instead, they must innovate by offering seamless online experiences, meaningful collaborations, and engaging campaigns that resonate with today’s shoppers. As we look ahead, the challenges and opportunities for retailers are clear. The future of Boxing Day—and retail more broadly—depends on the ability to adapt to shifting consumer behaviours, embrace new trends, and balance online and in-store experiences effectively.",

Looking to scratch that post-Christmas shopping itch? Fear not, as the IndyBest team of shopping experts and I are on hand with a curated guide to the best Boxing Day discounts. Keep scrolling for the ones I’d snap up. Read more: Follow Boxing Day deals live IndyBest’s shopping experts track the price of popular products year-round and have covered Boxing Day sales and other major shopping events for years, so we know how to spot a good deal from a bad one. On top of knowing our way around a sale, we are experts in our fields. We’ve spent countless hours testing and reviewing everything from air fryers to TVs. Within our Boxing Day sale guides, we only recommend deals on products we’ve tried and tested from brands we trust. That means we bring you genuine savings on products we think you’ll love as much as we do. According to The Independent’s tech critic David Phelan, these are among the best earbuds and offer a “significant improvement over the already-splendid first-generation model”. Noise-cancelling is twice as good; you get six hours on a single charge, rather than five; there are touch controls on the buds themselves, so you can adjust the volume without having to take your phone out of your pocket, and there’s a MagSafe case with a lanyard loop for easy charging and storage. Now reduced to their lowest-ever price, trust me, you don’t want to miss this post-Christmas deal. If Santa didn’t leave a Dyson airwrap under the tree, fear not, as Boots is offering a stellar (and rare) saving on the cult tool for Boxing Day. Available in a limited edition strawberry blush hue, the airwrap boasts six attachments, from two barrels to a coanda smoothing dryer, a round volumising bristle brush, a flat brush and a diffuser. Helping you create super sleek curly styles with the barrels and a voluminous bouncy look thanks to the brushes, there are endless styling options. It’s a non-negotiable in my own routine while beauty tester Louise thought the same, with the tool earning a spot in her round-up of the best hot brushes. Since this affordable Ninja air fryer entered my kitchen, meal times have never been easier. Proving that air fryers don’t have to dominate your kitchen counter space, this design is sleek and space-saving. Better yet, it comes with a 30 per cent discount at Currys. It also received rave reviews from tester Lauren, who found that despite “using up to 75 per cent less fat than traditional frying methods, you still get a good crunch. Its generous 3.8l basket can fit a medium-sized chicken and allows you to air fry, roast, reheat and dehydrate”. What more could you want? Taking the top spot in IndyBest’s guide to the best winter duvets, this 15-tog design from Dunelm now has 20 per cent off. “Cosy and luxurious, this duvet guarantees winter-ready warmth,” said assistant eCommerce editor Sarah when she put the duvet to the test. “While it is synthetic, it is incredibly plush and soft with a down-like feel and has the classic rustle sound you’d expect from a natural filling. Plus, because it’s made with polyester, it’s suitable for anyone looking to avoid feathers.” You can also save on the design in single, king and super king sizes. Want to upgrade your cookware? Save 40 per cent on the price of this chic Le Creuset casserole dish, which is reduced in both the navy and grey mist colourways at John Lewis. Whether you’re using it in the oven, on the hob or under the grill, this dish will help you serve up mouth-watering meals in style. Even better, the sturdy cast iron design comes with Le Creuset’s lifetime guarantee – what’s not to love? While this isn’t a saving on the mattress itself, Simba is offering free items with selected mattresses. So, if you’re moving home or really want to invest in your sleep, this could be a great way to save money. For example, if you purchase the hybrid luxe, you’ll also receive two hybrid pillows, a hybrid duvet and a performance mattress protector for free, saving you £766 if you were to purchase them separately. The mattress also comes IndyBest-approved, as it took the top spot in our round-up, where sleep expert Sarah Jones praised the hybrid luxe for providing “decent support”, being “breathable” and “naturally temperature-regulating”. Treat yourself to a little pick me up with this duo of Glossier’s bestselling lip balms. The set features two limited edition flavours – biscotti and espresso, perfect for keeping your lips supple and hydrated throughout winter. One balm dotcom costs £16, so for just £2 more, you’ll get an extra to keep in your handbag. What more could you want? Our resident IndyBest electric toothbrush tester Steve named this the best model in his review, the Oral-B pro 3 combines great cleaning performance with a budget-friendly price compared to rival brushes. The Oral-B pro 3 is discounted to around £50 fairly regularly, so this Boxing Day deal might be your last chance to catch it at its cheapest price this year. One of my favourite beauty cleansers, Elemis’s pro-collagen cleansing balm has reached cult status for very good reason. It even landed a spot in beauty expert Louise’s review of the best cleansing balms, in which she noted, after she’d removed the product from her face, her skin “felt soft and smooth, with a subtle glow that you often find after having a facial. From start to finish, the experience is a luxurious treat”. I’m restocking while the formula is on sale, to give my skin some TLC ahead of the new year. Samsung’s smart ring tracks your health metrics around the clock, offering you wellness tips and insights into your activity, stress levels and sleep quality without the need to wear a watch. When tech critic Alex reviewed the Galaxy Ring review, he said it has “one of the best design choices we’ve seen for a smart ring”. Now, I’ve spotted a major £80 discount at Currys for Boxing Day. The end-of-year sales are one of the best times to upgrade your phone, particularly when there are deals like this one from iD Mobile at Carphone Warehouse. The 100GB plan on the Apple iPhone 16 has you paying just £99 up front and then £39.99 per month. That’s a total of £959.76 over the course of the 24-month plan (mid-contract price bumps not included). In The Independent’s tech editor’s review of the latest iPhone, Andrew said it “is a powerhouse of innovative technologies that is due to become even more powerful in the months to come”. One of the most-wanted gaming Christmas gifts this year, FC 25 was sure to be wrapped up under many a tree; however, if you did miss out, PlayStation has just the deal for you with more than 50 per cent off for Boxing Day. According to resident gaming wizz Alex, the latest iteration “isn’t just the same game with players donning new kits” and rather, includes everything “from a new game mode and a new FC IQ system to new player roles and better tactical options.” Wow, sign me up. The vertuo pop is Nespresso’s most affordable coffee machine – and, naturally, it’s been tried and tested by the team at IndyBest. Spoiler alert: Lauren loved it. Now, you can invest for nearly half price thanks to John Lewis. Receiving a glowing five-star review, she praised the “small but mighty” machine that will slot seamlessly into most people’s kitchen countertops. “Weighing in at just 3.5kg, if you have a large cupboard and won’t be using the machine every day, it’s also incredibly easy to store away until you need it,” she added. I love the colours available, too, with the blue and yellow brightening up your kitchen surfaces. This cult brand’s hoodies were rated highly in my review of the best blanket hoodies, where I found the oversized hoodie to be cocooning and warming. Complete with a hood, sleeves and practical front pouch, the hoodie is finished in a plush soft-to-touch flannel fleece with sherpa fleece lining the inside. Large enough to curl beneath it on the sofa but still sufficiently fitted and lightweight to move around the house while working from home, the Oodie is a saviour when temperatures plummet. Right now, you can pick one up for less than £30. “If you’re looking for a sleep tracker, activity tracker or just want to know as much as you can about your body, then the gen 3 Oura ring will tick a lot of your boxes, in one tiny package,” Kat said in her review of the fitness device. With six different coloured rings available (from silver to gold), it’s a more stylish choice than a Fitbit or Garmin. When Kat tested the device out, she was impressed with its battery life and sleep insights, as well as fertility and period tracking. Right now, the Oura gen3 ring is the cheapest I’ve ever seen at Amazon. Run, don’t walk. Apple’s nifty AirTag trackers haven’t been this cheap in years. “For any iPhone owner prone to losing things, investing in a pack of four might be one of the best decisions you ever make,” tech wizard Alex wrote in his review of the best key finders. “Precision tracking works wonderfully well when you can get a signal, and the fact it’s powered by removable batteries is a real bonus.” A must-have for travel in 2025, add these to your basket pronto. Right now, there’s up to 50 per cent off a range of jewellery at Missoma, including these molten hoop earrings. Providing a subtle twist on the classic hoop style, this pair is made with 18ct gold plated vermeil on sterling silver and comes complete with butterfly closures. Whether you’re looking to refresh your everyday ear stack or want something to complete your New Year’s Eve look, this goes-with-everything pair is now less than £60. One of the top names in coffee makers, Delonghi features in home appliance tester Zoe’s review of the best coffee machines. Here’s a deal on a more compact model at Currys, which offers a simple bean-to-cup extraction thanks to its 13-setting burr grinder and one-touch operation. I’ve just moved house, so this is the perfect choice for my smaller kitchen – it’s gone straight in my basket. IndyBest writer Lois loved Our Place’s always pan when she tested it, owing to its non-stick abilities and how it’s made from “post-consumer recycled aluminium”. She also liked the “satisfaction from cooking on such an uncannily smooth surface”. I’ve got the spice colourway in the always pan and can confirm it’s just as enjoyable to display as it is to cook with. With five hues to choose from, you can tailor it to your kitchen interiors. Here’s a £275 saving on the MacBook Air from 2020, which is still a powerful, versatile and lightweight laptop with an impressive all-day battery life. This festive deal at Laptops Direct sees Apple’s best-selling laptop reduced to just £650 for Boxing Day. The post-Christmas sales are prime time to give your interiors a refresh. Case in point, the mega Dusk sale, where you can save an extra 15 per cent right now with the code “FLASH15”. This Hampshire style secured a spot in our round-up of tried and tested corner sofas, where our reviewer named it the best traditional-style chaise sofa. “Dusk’s Hampshire chaise sofa is a triumph of both form and function – and, as with all of the brand’s offerings, it is enticingly affordable, given its high quality,” they said. Now, you can save more than £400 – and I’m sold. One of my favourite budget make-up buys, Maybelline’s New York sensational sky high mascara is even more affordable thanks to this Amazon deal. Boasting a uniquely designed brush that’s long, thin and densely packed with tiny little plastic bristles, it’s ideal for getting to hard-to-reach areas and easy to manoeuvre with minimal mess. When assistant eCommerce editor Sarah reviewed the mascara, she raved about the tiny bristles that line the wand, which she found “helped comb through each and every lash – yes, even those pesky ones right in the corner”. You can pick it up for just £7 right now. Audiobook subscription service Audible is currently just 99p per month for three months for Amazon Prime subscribers who’ve never had Audible before (or haven’t been a member in the past 12 months). Whether walking the dog or doing the washing up, you can listen to thousands of select Audible Originals, podcasts, and audiobooks (personal favourites include Miriam Margolyes’s This Much is True and Barbara Kingsolver’s Demon Copperhead). Once your trial period comes to an end, an Audible subscription will cost £7.99 each month, which will pay for one audiobook (each month) as well as the above. The offer will end on 21 January 2025, so, you’ve still got plenty of time to subscribe, even after the Boxing Day sales end. Touted as the world’s best massage device, the Theragun Pro is the brand’s most advanced massage gun – and it’s now discounted in the Boxing Day sales. With a second-generation proprietary EQ-150 motor, it’s 20 per cent quieter than its predecessors, easy to hold and looks incredibly sleek. Use it to release tension and knots, speed up your post-workout recovery and improve your mobility. Here’s to a healthier 2025. Ugg’s mini boots are now reduced in the Boxing Day sales. Made from soft sheepskin, the stacked sole style is favoured by the likes of our fashion writers, Hailey Bieber and the Hadid sisters. Perfect for cosy days indoors or out, save £50 on the classic boots while the discount lasts. Crafted from Skims’ signature modal ribbed fabric, this is the dress that goes with everything. Soft and comfortable in a minimalist full-length silhouette, it’s perfect for any occasion – whether you plan to be lounging at home, heading out for lunch or throwing a party. With a classic crew neck and slight racer back and front, it’s now 50 per cent off in the Boxing Day sales. Once upon a time, the Boxing Day sales lasted for one day only, and bargain hunters would have to get out bright and early to secure the goods. These days, however, the sale event runs through January, so there’s no need to rush. Don’t be fooled by the name, the Boxing Day sales are not really much different to the January sales that follow. The name may change when 1 January swings around, but the deals continue. From 26 December to 31 January, you’ll find the same products discounted, and often, the price will continue to drop even lower as we move through January. If you’re looking for something in particular, though, such as a piece of clothing in your size or a highly sought-after piece of tech, it may be worth making your purchase as soon as you spot a discount as sale items are not always replenished. It would be totally understandable if you believed that Boxing Day is named after the sport – we all heard the tales in our youth. But, Boxing Day’s origins couldn’t be more different to a match in the ring. Most historians today agree that Boxing Day stems back to Queen Victoria’s reign when the rich were Looking for more bargains?

                "content": "Eugene Cyril Smith III[2] (born October 10, 1990) is an American professional football quarterback for the Seattle Seahawks of the National Football League (NFL). He played college football for the West Virginia Mountaineers, leading them to multiple bowl games, breaking numerous passing records, and garnering multiple awards before being selected by the New York Jets in the second round of the 2013 NFL draft. After two inconsistent seasons as the Jets' starting quarterback, Smith eventually lost his starting position due to injuries in his final two years with the team. Smith then spent time as a backup for the New York Giants and Los Angeles Chargers before unexpectedly making a career resurgence as the Seahawks' starting quarterback in 2022, earning his first Pro Bowl selection, having his first winning record and playoff berth as a starter, leading the league in completion percentage, and ultimately winning the Comeback Player of the Year award. Smith was born to high school students Eugene Smith Jr. and Tracy Sellers in Miramar, Florida on October 10, 1990.[3][4] His family originally hails from Bimini in the Bahamas. His great-uncle, Danny Smith, was a record breaking All-American hurdler at Florida State, and his cousin Mel Bratton was a star running back at Miami in the mid-1980s.[2] Smith's nickname, Geno, came from his grandfather, who was nicknamed \"Big Geno\".[5] Smith was admitted to Norland Middle School's magnet program, which dedicated two hours per day to arts instruction.[6] He went on to attend Miramar High School, where he was coached by former Mountaineer Damon Cogdell.[7] As a junior, Smith passed for 2,200 yards, 25 touchdowns, and three interceptions, and was named second-team all-state quarterback. He was also named second-team all-Broward County as an athlete for 2007.[8] Following his junior year, Smith was invited to the prestigious Elite 11 quarterback camp in Aliso Viejo, California.[9] During Smith's senior season, he led his team to the state 6A semi-finals and completed 205 of 338 passes for 3,089 yards and 30 touchdowns while also rushing for over 300 yards. Smith was a first-team all-state selection in Florida Class 6A and a Parade All-American.[8] He was also the No. 1 rated player in Broward County according to the Miami Herald and South Florida Sun Sentinel, and finished No. 2 in the voting for Mr. Florida.[8] Smith finished his career as the third-best passer in Broward County history, and was named to the ESPN Top 150 prospects list. He chose to attend West Virginia over offers from Florida State, South Florida, Boston College, and Alabama.[10] Sources: Smith attended West Virginia University, where he played for the West Virginia Mountaineers football team from 2009 to 2012.[11] Smith was an English major during his time at West Virginia.[12] Smith saw some action his freshman year as the backup behind senior Jarrett Brown.[13] His first snap in a regular season game came against Auburn; Smith completed five of eight passes for 50 yards and an interception.[14] He would see action again against Syracuse, Marshall, Louisville, and in the Gator Bowl against Florida State.[15] In his freshman year at West Virginia University, Smith completed 32 of 49 passes for 309 yards, a touchdown, and an interception for an 81.1 quarterback rating to go along with 17 carries for seven yards as the backup to starting quarterback Brown.[16] 2010 was Smith's first year as the starting quarterback. Smith got his first start in the season opener against the Coastal Carolina Chanticleers, completing 20 of 27 passes for 216 yards, two touchdowns, and an interception in the 31–0 shutout victory.[17] With the Mountaineers down 21–6 against in-state rival, Marshall, Smith led his team to a fourth quarter comeback victory. He led the first drive from the Mountaineers' 4-yard line. With help from senior running back Noel Devine, the Mountaineers cut Marshall's lead to eight points. After the Mountaineers' defense stopped Marshall, a punt put the Mountaineers near their own end zone again, starting from the 2-yard line. After completing 9 of 13 passes and scrambling for 20 yards, Smith found tight end Will Johnson in the corner of the endzone for a touchdown. With Marshall still leading 21–19, head coach Bill Stewart elected to go for the two-point conversion. Smith completed a pass to wide receiver Jock Sanders in the back of the end zone for a two-point conversion. The Mountaineers went on to win the game in overtime by a score of 24–21. Smith finished the game completing 32 of 45 passes for 316 yards and a touchdown to go along with 14 carries for 13 yards.[18] After two games, Smith led the Big East Conference in passing yards and passing efficiency.[19] In a 31–17 victory over Maryland, Smith completed 19 of 29 pass attempts for 268 yards and four touchdowns. Two of his touchdowns were to Tavon Austin, and the other two were to Stedman Bailey.[19][20] Smith won his first Big East Offensive Player of the Week for this performance. In West Virginia's first meeting ever with LSU, the Mountaineers lost at Tiger Stadium by a score of 20–14. Smith completed 14 of 29 pass attempts for 119 yards, two touchdowns, and an interception to go along with five carries for 10 yards.[21] Smith threw for 220 yards and ran for 19 yards in West Virginia's 49–10 win over UNLV.[22] It was the most points WVU had scored since playing Connecticut in 2007.[23] During a 16–13 overtime loss to Connecticut, Smith completed 22 of 34 passes for 160 yards to go along with a season-high 64 rushing yards. This was the first game all season where Smith did not throw a touchdown pass. The loss was also the first time Connecticut had ever beaten West Virginia.[24] Smith tied his record for touchdowns in a game in a 37–10 win over Cincinnati, where he was 15 for 25, throwing for 174 yards, four touchdowns, and an interception. The win came after a two-game losing streak. It was the first time the Mountaineers beat Cincinnati since 2007.[25][26] Smith won his second Big East Offensive Player of the Week for this performance. On November 26 against Pittsburgh, Smith threw for 212 yards and three touchdowns in the 35–10 victory.[27] In the next game against Rutgers, he had 352 passing yards and a touchdown in the 35–14 victory.[28] Smith finished the 2010 season with 196 passing yards, a touchdown, and an interception in a 23–7 loss to North Carolina State in the Champs Sports Bowl.[29] Smith finished his sophomore season completing 241 of 372 passes for 2,763 yards, 24 touchdowns, and seven interceptions to go along with 106 carries for 217 yards.[30] With the arrival of new West Virginia football head coach Dana Holgorsen and a new passing-based offensive system, Smith saw his passing numbers improve drastically. In the fourth game of the season against the #2 LSU Tigers, Smith set school records for completions (38), attempts (65), and passing yards (463) in the 47–21 loss on September 24, 2011.[31] With 372 passing yards against the Cincinnati Bearcats on November 12, Smith tied a Big East record with his seventh 300-yard game of the season. He tied the record that was set in 2007 by Brian Brohm of the Louisville Cardinals.[32] Smith set single-season school records for pass completions (291), attempts (448), and yards (3,741) on November 25 in a win against the rival Pittsburgh Panthers.[33] All three records were previously held by Marc Bulger.[34] In West Virginia's 70–33 rout of the Clemson Tigers in the 2012 Orange Bowl, Smith tied three individual bowl records: most touchdown passes (six), most touchdowns overall (seven) and total points (42).[35][36] Smith's 401 passing yards broke Tom Brady's Orange Bowl record of 396 that he set in the 2000 Orange Bowl. Smith also became the Big East single-season passing leader with 4,379 yards, breaking Brian Brohm's mark that he set in 2007. As a senior, Smith put together multiple great statistical performances for the Mountaineers. In the season opening victory over Marshall, he finished 32-of-36 for 323 yards and four touchdowns.[37] In the next game, a victory over James Madison, he finished 34-of-39 for 411 yards and five touchdowns.[38] On September 29 against Baylor, Smith had a career-day, completing 45-of-51 passes for 656 yards and eight touchdowns in the 70–63 victory.[39] In the next game, a victory over Texas, he finished with 268 passing yards and four touchdowns to help lead the Mountaineers to a 5–0 record.[40] After the win over Texas, the season started to falter for the Mountaineers. Despite some solid individual results, Smith and the Mountaineers dropped the next five games. On November 23, Smith had 236 passing yards and two touchdowns in a victory over Iowa State to stop the losing streak.[41] In the regular season finale against Kansas, he finished 23-of-24 for 407 yards, three touchdowns, and an interception in the 59–10 victory.[42] In the Pinstripe Bowl against Syracuse, he finished with 201 passing yards and two touchdowns in the 38–14 loss.[43] Smith finished the season with 4,205 passing yards, 42 touchdowns, and six interceptions to go along with 66 carries for 151 yards and two touchdowns.[44] After the season, he officially announced his decision to enter the 2013 NFL draft. Smith received an invitation to the NFL Scouting Combine where his performance was well received by scouts who highlighted his athleticism and strong arm[46] but noted that his ball placement needed improvement.[47] Smith was widely regarded as one of the top prospects alongside EJ Manuel of Florida State.[48] In the days leading up to the draft, several NFL teams expressed interest in Smith including the Kansas City Chiefs (No. 1 selection), the Jacksonville Jaguars (No. 2 selection), the Oakland Raiders (No. 3 selection), the Philadelphia Eagles (No. 4 selection), the Buffalo Bills (No. 8 selection), and the New York Jets (No. 9 and No. 13 selections).[49] Smith was in attendance for the first round of the draft as many analysts and scouts expected him to be taken that night.[53] However, Smith was not selected, and EJ Manuel was the lone quarterback taken in the first round.[54] Smith declined to be interviewed by ESPN afterwards and originally planned to return home but later decided to attend the second day of the draft.[54] Several league executives alleged Smith did not handle the draft process in a professional manner, which caused him to fall out of the first round,[55] while analysts pointed to his late-season decline as a senior at West Virginia, which exposed his flaws, as the primary reason.[56] The following day, the Jets expressed interest in trading up in the second round to select Smith but could not consummate a trade.[57] Despite this, Smith remained available and the Jets selected him with the 39th overall pick.[58] Following the selection, General manager John Idzik stated that Smith would compete with incumbent Mark Sanchez in training camp to determine the starting quarterback.[59] Smith fired his agency, Select Sports Group, upon the completion of the draft and sought new representation.[60] He signed with Roc Nation Sports on May 22, 2013, with Kimberley Miale serving as his representative.[61] Smith worked out in his home state of Florida during the offseason, prompting questions as to whether or not he had spurned Sanchez by not attending Sanchez's Jets West summer camp in California.[62] Smith and Sanchez dismissed this notion with Sanchez saying that it was \"no big deal.\"[63] On July 22, 2013, Smith signed a four-year, $5 million contract with approximately $690,000 in workout bonuses.[64][65] Smith made his professional debut on August 9, 2013, in the first preseason game against the Detroit Lions.[66] He completed 6-of-7 passes for 47 yards but left the game due to an ankle injury in the second quarter.[66] X-rays showed no structural damage and Smith returned to practice on August 11.[67] Smith started the Jets' third preseason game against the New York Giants completing 16 of 30 passes for 199 yards, a touchdown, and three interceptions.[68] Smith was named the team's starting quarterback after Sanchez suffered a shoulder injury against the Giants.[69] During the season-opening 18–17 victory over the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, Smith completed 24-of-38 passes for 256 yards, a touchdown, and an interception. With only a few seconds left in the fourth quarter, he was hit out of bounds by Lavonte David, which drew a late hit penalty and the Jets went on to score the game-winning field goal.[70] In the next game against the New England Patriots, Smith struggled as he completed 15 of his 35 passes for 214 yards, a touchdown, and three interceptions as the Jets lost on the road by a score of 13–10.[71] The following week against the Bills, Smith completed 16 of 29 passes for 331 yards, rushing for a touchdown and passing for two touchdowns and two interceptions. Despite 20 penalties, the Jets powered through and won 27–20.[72] Smith became the first rookie quarterback in franchise history to throw for 300 or more yards in a game.[73] Smith struggled in the Week 4 38–13 road loss to the Tennessee Titans.[74] He completed 23 of his 34 passes for 289 yards and a touchdown while committing four turnovers—two led to Titans touchdowns as the Jets lost 13–38.[74] During a narrow Week 5 30–28 road victory over the Atlanta Falcons, Smith completed 16 of 20 passes for 199 yards and three touchdowns.[75] He completed all four of his passes on the Jets' final drive,[75] allowing Nick Folk to kick the game-winning 43-yard field goal.[76] Smith was named American Football Conference Offensive Player of the Week[77] and Pepsi NFL Rookie of the Week for his performance.[78] In the next game against the Pittsburgh Steelers, Smith threw for 201 yards and two interceptions as the Jets lost by a score of 19–6.[79] The following week against the Patriots, he completed 17 of 33 passes for 233 yards and scored two touchdowns as the Jets won by a score of 30–27 in overtime.[80] Smith struggled during the Week 8 9–49 road loss to the Cincinnati Bengals as he completed 20-of-30 passes for 159 yards and two interceptions that were returned for touchdowns before being relieved of duties by Matt Simms in the fourth quarter.[81] Smith started in the next game against the New Orleans Saints and completed eight of 19 passes for 115 yards to go along with six carries for 18 yards and a touchdown in a 26–20 upset victory.[82] The Jets returned from their bye week to lose three straight contests to the Bills, Baltimore Ravens and Miami Dolphins. Smith struggled during this stretch as he failed to score any points and committed eight turnovers;[83][84][85] he was benched in favor of Simms against Buffalo and Miami leading coach Rex Ryan to be noncommittal in starting Smith the rest of the year.[86] Smith showed gradual improvement as the Jets won three of their final four games. During a Week 14 37–27 victory over the Raiders, Smith completed 16 of his 25 passes for 219 yards, a touchdown, and an interception to go along with five carries for 50 yards, keeping the team in playoff contention.[87] In the next game against the Carolina Panthers, Smith performed well until throwing a costly pick six in the fourth quarter.

Smith finished the game completing 15 of 28 passes for 167 yards, a touchdown, and interception.[88] The following week against the Browns, Smith completing 20-of-36 passes for 214 yards and two touchdowns to go along with 10 carries for 48 yards and a touchdown as the Jets won by a score of 24–13.[89] In the regular-season finale against the Dolphins, Smith completed 17-of-27 passes for 190 yards and a touchdown to go along with 10 carries for 44 yards and a touchdown as the Jets won on the road by a score of 20–7, eliminating Miami from playoff contention.[90] Smith finished his rookie year with 3,046 yards, 12 touchdowns, and 21 interceptions to go along with 72 carries for 366 yards and six touchdowns in 16 games and starts.[91] Smith was named the starter to begin the 2014 season.[92] He began the season passing for 221 yards, a touchdown, and an interception in the 19–14 season-opening victory over the Raiders.[93] In the next game against the Green Bay Packers, he passed for 176 yards, a touchdown, and an interception to go along with seven carries for 26 yards and a touchdown in the 31–24 road loss.[94] The following week against the Chicago Bears, Smith's very first play resulted in an interception returned for a touchdown by Ryan Mundy. Smith finished the game with 316 passing yards, a touchdown, and two interceptions as the Jets lost to the Bears by a score of 27–19.[95] During a Week 4 24–17 loss to the Lions, Smith threw for 209 yards with an interception and lost fumble.[96] On October 3, 2014, he was fined $12,000 for yelling profanity at fans while walking to the locker room during halftime in Week 4. Despite this incident, Smith was allowed to start in the next game against the San Diego Chargers, in which he threw for only 27 yards with an interception and was benched for the second half in favor of Michael Vick as the Jets were shut out on the road 31–0.[97] Prior to the Week 5 game, Smith and a few of his teammates missed a team meeting, having gone to a movie theater in San Diego, unaware of the three-hour time difference between the Eastern and Pacific Time Zones.[98] Smith started in the Week 6 31–17 loss to the Denver Broncos, throwing for 190 yards, two touchdowns, and an interception.[99] During a 27–25 road loss to the Patriots in Week 7, Smith threw for 226 yards and the Jets combined for 218 rushing yards, but the potential game-winning drive fell short due to a blocked field goal.[100] In the next game, Smith lasted only ten minutes to begin regulation as he completed 2-of-8 passes for five yards and three interceptions against the Bills, and was subsequently benched in favor of Michael Vick. His passer rating for that game was 0.04.[101] In the regular-season finale against the Dolphins, Smith led the Jets to a 37–24 road victory, completing 20 of 25 passes for a career-high 358 yards, three touchdowns, no interceptions, and a perfect passer rating. This was his first perfect game, the sixth in Jets history, and the only one of the 2014 season.[102][103] Smith finished his second professional season with 2,525 passing yards, 13 touchdowns, and 13 interceptions to go along with 59 carries for 238 yards and a touchdown in 14 games and 13 starts.[104] On August 11, 2015, Smith was involved in an altercation with defensive end IK Enemkpali in the locker room over a $600 unpaid debt.[105] Smith suffered a fractured jaw after Enemkpali punched him in the face. Smith was ruled out for 6–10 weeks, and Enemkpali was released by the Jets shortly thereafter.[106][107] Two days later, Smith underwent surgery on his fractured jaw.[108] Ryan Fitzpatrick led the team to a 2–0 record while Smith was injured, so new head coach Todd Bowles decided to continue starting Fitzpatrick, even with Smith being healthy. During a Week 8 34–20 road loss to the Raiders, Smith entered the game in relief of Fitzpatrick, who left the game with an injured thumb. Smith completed 27 of 42 passes for 265 yards, two touchdowns, and an interception to go along with two carries for 34 yards.[109] This was his only appearance in 2015.[110] With Ryan Fitzpatrick re-signing with the Jets, Smith continued to remain in the backup role.[111] During a Week 6 28–3 road loss to the Arizona Cardinals, Smith came in after Fitzpatrick was benched for poor performance. Smith finished the game completing four of six passes for 31 yards and an interception.[112] Two days later, he was named starter for the following game in place of Fitzpatrick.[113] Making the start in Week 7 against the Ravens, Smith threw for 95 yards and a touchdown until leaving the eventual 24–16 victory with an apparent knee injury.[114] The next day, it was revealed that he tore his ACL, prematurely ending his 2016 season.[115] Smith was placed on injured reserve on October 26, 2016.[116] On March 28, 2017, Smith signed with the Giants.[117] During a Week 9 51–17 loss to the Los Angeles Rams, Smith came in the game in relief of Eli Manning late in the fourth quarter and finished with only two incomplete passes.[118] On November 28, 2017, the Giants named Smith the starter for the upcoming game against the Raiders, which ended Manning's 210-game starting streak with the Giants. The start made Smith the first black quarterback to start for the Giants and the first quarterback to start for both the Giants and the Jets; it also meant every NFL team had started a black player at quarterback, with the Giants being the last team to do so.[119] Making his first start with the Giants, Smith threw for 212 yards and a touchdown but had two first-half fumbles within the Raiders' 30 yard line and the Giants lost by a score of 17–24.[120] On December 5, Manning was renamed the starter.[121] On April 1, 2018, Smith signed a one-year contract with the Los Angeles Chargers.[122] During a Week 6 38–14 road victory over the Cleveland Browns, Smith made his Chargers debut, completing one pass for eight yards.[123] Overall, Smith appeared in five games in the 2018 season in relief roles.[124] Smith signed with the Seattle Seahawks on May 15, 2019.[125] Smith competed with Paxton Lynch for the backup job behind Russell Wilson. He was released on August 31, 2019, along with Lynch, but was re-signed the next day, earning the backup job.[126][127] Smith saw no action during his first season with the team. Smith re-signed with the Seahawks on May 20, 2020.[128] His only appearance came during a Week 14 40–3 victory over his former team, the Jets, as he played out the final 16:26 of the game. Smith completed four of five passes for 33 yards, leading the Seahawks to a field goal on the second of his two drives.[129] Smith re-signed with the Seahawks for a third season on April 22, 2021.[130] He made his first appearance of the 2021 season in Week 5 against the Rams after Russell Wilson left the game with a finger injury. Smith finished the 26–17 home loss with 131 passing yards, a touchdown (which was his first since 2017), and an interception.[131] Smith was announced the starter after Wilson was placed on injured reserve. In the next game against the Steelers, Smith threw for 209 yards and a touchdown, but lost a fumble in overtime in the 20–23 overtime road loss.[132] Two weeks later, against the Jaguars, Smith finished with 195 yards and two touchdowns to go along with two carries for eight yards and a touchdown.[133] Smith finished the 2021 season with 702 passing yards, five touchdowns, and an interception to go along with nine carries for 42 yards and a touchdown in four games and three starts.[134] The Seahawks re-signed Smith on April 19, 2022,[135] but the NFL disapproved Smith's new contract that same day after conducting the league's mandatory review; the issue was eventually resolved.[136] On August 26, 2022, Smith was announced as the starting quarterback for the season-opener against the Broncos, the team that former Seahawks quarterback Russell Wilson had been traded to during the offseason.[137] Smith had competed for the starting quarterback spot with Drew Lock after the Seahawks traded Wilson. During the season-opener against the Broncos, Smith completed 23 of 28 passes for 195 yards and two touchdowns as the Seahawks won, 17–16.[138] Three weeks later against the Lions, Smith threw for 320 yards and two touchdowns as well as 49 rushing yards and a touchdown, leading the Seahawks to a 48–45 road victory.[139] He was named National Football Conference Offensive Player of the Week for his performance.[140] During a Week 8 27–13 victory over his former team, the Giants, Smith threw for 212 yards and two touchdowns.[141] On December 21, 2022, Smith was selected to his first Pro Bowl.[142] During a Week 17 23–6 victory over his former team, the Jets, Smith completed 18 of 29 passes for 183 yards and two touchdowns, keeping the Seahawks alive in the playoff hunt and eliminating the team that drafted him in the process.[143] In a must-win game during the regular-season finale against the Rams, he completed 19 of 31 passes for 213 yards, a touchdown, and two interceptions in the 19–16 overtime victory. During the game, Smith became the Seahawks’ single-season passing leader, surpassing Russell Wilson's mark of 4,219 yards set back in 2016.[144] With the win and the Packers' loss to the Lions later that night, the Seahawks clinched a playoff berth as the seventh seed, marking Smith's first playoff appearance.[145] Smith finished the regular season with numerous career highs, completing 399 of 572 passes, with a league-leading 69.8% completion percentage, for 4,282 yards, 30 touchdowns, 11 interceptions, and a 100.9 passer rating in 17 games to go along with 68 carries for 366 yards and a touchdown.[146] He was also the only quarterback to take every offensive snap for his team that season.[147] Smith was named Comeback Player of the Year by the Associated Press and the Pro Football Writers of America (PFWA).[148][149] In addition, the PFWA named him as their Most Improved Player.[150] The Seahawks traveled to San Francisco to face the San Francisco 49ers in the Wild Card Round, Smith's first career postseason start. He completed 25 of 35 passes for 253 yards, two touchdowns, and an interception, while also losing a fumble, as the Seahawks lost, 41–23.[151] He was ranked 77th by his fellow players on the NFL Top 100 Players of 2023.[152] On March 14, 2023, Smith re-signed with the Seahawks on a three-year, $75 million deal.[153] In a Week 2 37–31 shootout overtime win over the Detroit Lions, Smith threw for 328 yards and two touchdowns, while also rushing for 20 yards.[154] Smith was briefly knocked out by a knee injury in Week 4 24–3 over the New York Giants, but returned finishing the game with one passing touchdown, 110 passing yards, and a reception that went for −2 yards.[155][156] In Week 10 against the Washington Commanders, Smith threw for a career-high 369 yards and two touchdowns along a rush for 13 yards. The Seahawks won 29–26 after Smith led a game-winning drive that ended with a field goal as time expired.[157] Smith was forced out of the following week's game against the Los Angeles Rams after suffering an injury to his throwing elbow in the third quarter. He returned with less than two minutes left in the fourth quarter with his team down 16–17, and led a drive into field goal range, but Jason Myers missed a 55-yard potential game-winning field goal with two seconds left, and the Seahawks lost.[158] Smith finished the game with one passing touchdown, 233 passing yards, and −1 rushing yards from a kneel down at the end of the first half.[159] In Week 13 against the Dallas Cowboys, Smith had a career-high four total touchdowns (three passing and one rushing), 334 passing yards, an interception, and six rushing yards in 35–41 shootout loss.[160] Smith missed the next two games after suffering a groin injury in practice with Drew Lock starting in his place.[161] In his return to the field in Week 16 against the Tennessee Titans, Smith led two long touchdowns drives in the second half, the second of which occurred in the final minutes of the game, that propelled the Seahawks to a 20–17 win.

                "content": "Editions: En/lifestyle/celebrity-net-worth How the Seahawks QB's comeback season changed everything Geno Smith, the Seattle Seahawks' star quarterback, has become one of the most inspiring comeback stories in the NFL. Smith's career trajectory wasn't always promising. Drafted by the New York Jets in 2013, he initially signed a four-year, $5 million contract, including a $2 million signing bonus. However, struggles on the field and injuries led to a six-year stretch as a journeyman backup quarterback. During this period, he signed modest one-year deals with teams like the New York Giants and Los Angeles Chargers, earning between $895,000 and $1.2 million annually. Smith's fortunes changed dramatically when he joined the Seahawks in 2019. Though initially a backup, he seized the starting role in 2022 and delivered a career-defining season. That year, he led the NFL in completion percentage (69.8%), threw for 4,282 yards and 30 touchdowns, and broke multiple Seahawks franchise records. His performance earned him the NFL Comeback Player of the Year Award and his first Pro Bowl selection. \"Geno Smith has shown what resilience and hard work can achieve,\" said Seahawks head coach Pete Carroll in a 2022 interview. \"He's a leader, and his commitment to improvement is unparalleled.\" Related: Smith's on-field success translated into financial rewards. In March 2023, he inked a three-year, $75 million contract, including a $25 million signing bonus. This deal averages $25 million per year, with his 2024 salary climbing to $27 million due to performance incentives and bonuses. His net worth is estimated at $30 million, largely thanks to his current $27 million annual salary, a testament to his perseverance and talent. By the end of his current deal, Smith will have earned over $90 million from NFL contracts alone, with nearly $30 million coming from signing bonuses. Despite his financial success, Smith has remained relatively low-key, with no major endorsements or publicized investments. His story serves as a reminder of the value of persistence. \"I never stopped believing in myself,\" Smith shared after his 2022 breakout season. \"No matter how tough it got, I stayed ready for the opportunity.\" Now, as one of the highest-paid quarterbacks, Smith is living proof that patience and hard work pay off-in both legacy and wealth. © Unidad Editorial Información Deportiva, S.L.U.
