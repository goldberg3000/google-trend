                <p class="article-content">The Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC) is a prominent mixed martial arts (MMA) promotion company based in Las Vegas, Nevada, owned by TKO Group Holdings, a subsidiary of Endeavor Group Holdings. As of 2023, the UFC is recognized as the largest MMA promotion globally, hosting events across various countries and featuring 11 weight divisions, adhering to the Unified Rules of Mixed Martial Arts. Since its inception in 1993, the UFC has evolved from a platform for showcasing various martial arts styles into a multi-billion-dollar enterprise under the leadership of Dana White, who has been its president since 2001 and CEO since 2023.

The UFC was founded by Art Davie and Rorion Gracie, with the first event held in Denver, Colorado. Initially, the organization aimed to determine the most effective martial art through minimal rules and no weight classes, leading to the development of modern MMA. The UFC underwent ownership changes, starting with Semaphore Entertainment Group, followed by the Fertitta brothers and Dana White in 2001, who formed Zuffa to manage the promotion. In 2016, Zuffa was sold to a group led by Endeavor for $4.025 billion, and in 2023, the UFC merged with WWE to create TKO Group Holdings.

Throughout its history, the UFC has faced challenges, including political scrutiny and public perception issues regarding violence in the sport. However, it has adapted by implementing rules, weight classes, and safety measures, leading to increased legitimacy and acceptance. The UFC has also expanded its reach through media partnerships, reality television shows like "The Ultimate Fighter," and significant pay-per-view events, contributing to its financial success and global popularity.

The organization has been involved in various controversies, including antitrust lawsuits concerning fighter pay and contractual practices. Despite these challenges, the UFC continues to grow, with an extensive roster of fighters from diverse backgrounds and ongoing efforts to enhance the sport's integrity and athlete welfare. The UFC's commitment to anti-doping measures, fighter insurance, and evolving regulations reflects its dedication to maintaining a competitive and fair environment for its athletes.</p>
