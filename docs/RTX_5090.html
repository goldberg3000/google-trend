                <h2 class="article-title">Nvidia Reveals The RTX 5090: There’s Good And Bad News</h2>
                <p class="article-content">Nvidia has revealed four of its RTX 5000-series graphics cards at the CES event in Las Vegas and there's good and bad news when it comes to pricing. The RTX 5090, 5080, 5070 Ti And 5070 pricing was revealed as well as availability, with all four cards available from this month. Nvidia has revealed the pricing of four of its new RTX 5000 graphics cards - the RTX 5090, 5080, ... [+] 5070 Ti and 5070 With the pricing some cards are a lot more expensive, while others are cheaper compared to the original RTX 4000-series models. The RTX 5090 costs $400 more than the RTX 4090 did at launch, retailing for $1,999. The RTX 5080, though, costs $200 less than the RTX 4080 did at launch while the RTX 5070 Ti also sees a lower launch price than the RTX 4070 Ti by $50. Finally, the RTX 5070 will cost $549, which is a $50 price cut. This is probably not what AMD and Intel wanted to hear as they'd been focussing on the low end and mid-range with an emphasis on value and reigning in Nvidia's enviable market share. Price cuts for the likes of the RTX 5070 compared to the RTX 4070 is probably a worst case scenario so the graphics card market will be very interesting over the course of the next few months. Nvidia's CEO Jensen Huang delivers Nvidia's Keynote at CES 2025 In short, if you want an RTX 5090, it's going to cost you more. With everything else, you'll be paying less than you did with the original RTX 4000 series. This is a far cry from recent rumors that put massive markups on the RTX 5090 and 5080 expecially. There's been no mention of any cards below the RTX 5070 yet. Starting with the RTX 5090 and 5080, these will be available on Jan. 30 while the RTX 5070 Ti and RTX 5070 will be available in February. It seems Nvidia is skipping its own Founders Edition model on the RTX 5070 Ti, but will offer it on the other models, which will be available direct from its wesbite. The RTX 5060 TI and RTX 5060 are expected to make an appearance at some point in the near future, but as I left the keynote to head to bed here in the UK at 4am, no information had been revealed on those cards. That's to be expected, though, as the RTX 4060 and 4060 Ti took a few months to appear after the initial launch of the RTX 4000-series with cards such as the RTX 4090 and RTX 4080. Nvidia's RTX 5090 There's more good news, though, as the card revealed today was the Blackwell architecture-based RTX 5090 and the most obvious feature about the beautiful, sleek new Founders Edition cooler design is how small it is. The RTX 4090 (below) was a massive triple-slot graphics card and required significant clearance in PC cases. The RTX 5090, though, appears to be a whole slot thinner, appearing to be around two slots. The RTX 4090 Founders Edition was a triple slot graphics card This likely means other models could be smaller in size and this also raises questions about existing information relating to specifications and power consumption as none of the rumors even came close to suggesting a two-slot RTX 5090. It's certainly a far cry from the enormous Inno3D model revealed earlier this week. Partner cards are often larger, but the difference here is an entire slot of depth, which is a huge difference. It will be interesting to see what other examples arrive from other board partners and whether any of those will be dual-slot too.

                <h2 class="article-title">New GeForce RTX 50 Series Graphics Cards & Laptops Powered By NVIDIA Blackwell Bring Game-Changing AI and Neural Rendering Capabilities To Gamers and Creators  | GeForce News | NVIDIA</h2>
                <p class="article-content">Powered by the NVIDIA Blackwell RTX architecture, GeForce RTX 50 Series graphics cards and GeForce RTX 50 Series laptops accelerate frame rates by up to 8X using NVIDIA DLSS 4 with Multi Frame Generation, reduce latency by up to 75% using NVIDIA Reflex 2, enable next-level graphical fidelity for gamers and creators with NVIDIA RTX Neural Shaders, and much more. GeForce RTX 50 Series GPUs and laptops deliver game-changing performance, power transformative AI experiences, and enable creators to complete workflows in record time. Rewatch the NVIDIA Keynote by NVIDIA CEO, Jensen Huang, below, and read on for all of the details. Neural rendering is the next era of computer graphics. By integrating neural networks into the rendering process, we can take dramatic leaps forward in performance, image quality, and interactivity to deliver new levels of immersion. The very first example of neural rendering was DLSS. We used lower resolution rendered frames as an input to a neural network, which was trained to output a full resolution frame. DLSS has since evolved to the point where it can generate entire frames and understand the composition of a scene including shadows, reflections, and occlusion to generate images that are better than native rendering. With the invention of DLSS 4 with Multi Frame Generation, working in unison with the complete suite of DLSS technologies, we can multiply frame rates by up to 8X over traditional brute-force rendering and provide image quality that is better than native rendering. But DLSS is just the beginning. We've integrated neural networks inside of programmable shaders to create neural shaders. RTX Neural Shaders will drive the next decade of graphics innovations. They can be used to compress textures by up to 7X, saving massive amounts of graphics memory. And be used to create cinematic-quality textures, and even more advanced lighting effects in games. RTX Neural Faces offers an innovative, new approach to improve face quality using generative AI. Instead of traditional rendering, Neural Faces takes a simple rasterized face plus 3D pose data as input and uses a real-time generative AI model to infer a more natural face. The power of neural rendering with DLSS 4 can be seen in our new Zorah tech demo. The NVIDIA RTX Blackwell architecture has been built and optimized for neural rendering. It has a massive amount of processing power, with new engines and features specifically designed to accelerate the next generation of neural rendering. With up to 92 billion transistors, Blackwell is the most powerful consumer GPU ever created. The Blackwell streaming multiprocessor (SM) has been updated with more processing throughput, and a tighter integration with the Tensor Cores in order to optimize the performance of neural shaders. Blackwell is enhanced by several hardware and software innovations to improve Shader Execution Reordering. The reorder logic is twice as efficient, increasing the speed and precision of reordering which accelerates the performance of neural shaders. New Blackwell Tensor Cores have been built with a massive amount of AI processing horsepower, and support accelerated processing of FP4 precision models. With FP4, Blackwell Tensor Cores can not only process models faster, but can do so while using less graphics memory. To help support the frame pacing requirements of next generation DLSS Multi Frame Generation, the Blackwell architecture was built with enhanced hardware flip metering capabilities to provide the speed and accuracy required for a smooth, high-quality experience. Blackwell also features brand new RT Cores designed to ray trace massive amounts of detailed geometry. The RT Cores have 2X the ray triangle intersection rate of the previous generation, and enhanced compression designed to reduce memory footprint. This allows Blackwell GPUs to ray trace levels of geometry that were never before possible. Blackwell has also been enhanced with PCIe Gen5 and DisplayPort 2.1b UHBR20, driving displays up to 8K 165Hz. For GeForce RTX 50 Series laptops, new Max-Q technologies such as Advanced Power Gating, Low Latency Sleep, and Accelerated Frequency Switching increases battery life by up to 40%, compared to the previous generation. And in order to feed all this processing power, Blackwell is equipped with the world's fastest memory - GDDR7 with speeds up to 30Gbps. With G7 memory, Blackwell GPUs can deliver up to 1.8TB/s of memory bandwidth. On January 30th, the GeForce RTX 5090 and GeForce RTX 5080 arrive on store shelves. The GeForce RTX 5070 Ti and GeForce RTX 5070 will be available starting in February. Limited NVIDIA Founders Edition models of the GeForce RTX 5090, GeForce RTX 5080, and GeForce RTX 5070 graphics cards will be available worldwide. And stock-clocked and factory-overclocked variants of all four GPUs will be available from top add-in card providers such as ASUS, Colorful, Gainward, GALAX, GIGABYTE, INNO3D, KFA2, MSI, Palit, PNY and ZOTAC. And in desktops from system builders, including Falcon Northwest, Maingear, Origin PC, and more. Thanks to the Blackwell architecture’s innovations and DLSS 4, the GeForce RTX 5090 outperforms the GeForce RTX 4090 by 2X. Cyberpunk 2077: Phantom Liberty on GeForce RTX 5090 runs two times faster than last generation with the power of DLSS 4 With 32GB of GDDR7 memory, 1792 GB/sec of total memory bandwidth, 21,760 CUDA Cores, 680 5th Generation Tensor, and 170 4th Generation Ray Tracing Cores, it is the ultimate GeForce GPU, with more hardware and power than anything we’ve made previously (see the complete list of specs here). In games, DLSS 4 with Multi Frame Generation helps multiply performance in Cyberpunk 2077, Alan Wake 2, and Black Myth: Wukong, enabling GeForce RTX 5090 owners to play at 4K 240Hz/FPS with full ray tracing and every other setting maxed out, for the definitive experience. In Generative AI applications, image generation is 2X faster with half the memory using FP4 on the GeForce RTX 5090, compared to FP16 on the GeForce RTX 4090.
