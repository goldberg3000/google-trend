                <p class="article-content">Los Angeles Wildfires Advertisement Aghast at their city burning, residents of Studio City endured harrowing moments of uncertainty when a house caught fire in the neighborhood. By Isabella Kwai Even in parts of Los Angeles that had not been touched by the multiple wildfires raging across the area, residents were on edge on Thursday. The dry and windy conditions that had helped the fires spread persisted, meaning a small blaze could quickly turn destructive. Just before 9 p.m. on Wednesday, those fears seemed to be realized in Studio City, a neighborhood north of Hollywood, when a four-story home on a hillside caught fire and sent embers swirling through the air. The Los Angeles Fire Department warned residents of a potential evacuation. Sean Ingalsbe had been anxious about that scenario all day. Mr. Ingalsbe, 24, is a caretaker for his bedridden father and lives with his siblings and several pets in Studio City. “I’ve been so stressed and so worried,” he said. “If we have to evacuate, it’s hard to get him up,” he added of his father. Earlier in the day, while loading a car in case he had to leave, he felt a panic attack overwhelm him. Several homes were caught up in the fire in Studio City, according to overhead footage broadcast by KTLA 5, a local television station. Firefighters battled the blaze, which was dubbed the Sunswept fire, and video showed a firefighting aircraft passing over the burning home. Around 10 p.m. came relief: The fire had been extinguished, the fire department said, with no injuries reported. The extent of the damage to some nearby homes was still being assessed. It was a reprieve for Mr. Ingalsbe, but sleep was still elusive. Hours later, he said, he was still shaken from his panic attack, which had sent his pulse rising and given him a headache. Many of his neighbors had already left the area, he said, and as of 1 a.m. Thursday there was still no power. “My entire neighborhood pretty much is pitch-black,” he said. A generator that he had bought for the family would not arrive until Friday, and until then he was worried about other things: power for the oxygen machine that his father used, the food in the refrigerator that could spoil and the future of the city he had grown up in. “People are never going to forget this,” he said.

                <h2 class="article-title">Video Shows Studio City Home Collapse After Being Engulfed By Wildfire - Newsweek</h2>
                <p class="article-content">A dramatic video has surfaced showing a Studio City home collapsing into flames as wildfires tear through the area. Wildfires, caused by powerful Santa Ana winds, are currently engulfing much of Los Angeles. Known for their hot, dry nature, Santa Ana winds rapidly sap moisture from vegetation, leaving grasses, shrubs and trees highly combustible. Under such conditions, any spark—whether from downed power lines, machinery or natural events such as lightning—can ignite an inferno, with containment efforts significantly hindered by the winds' ferocity. So far, at least 5 people have died as a result of the wildfires, and several have been injured, authorities said in a press conference Wednesday. At least 2,000 structures have been destroyed across the city. A large house fire erupted in the Studio City area of Los Angeles on Wednesday night. Video footage of a live broadcast of the fire showed the four-story house collapse as flames engulfed the structure. WATCH: Building collapses during new fire in Studio City, Los Angeles pic.twitter.com/wPD7gw2pZR LAFD reported the fire on the 3000 block of North Sunswept Drive at 8:52 p.m., saying the residence was "well involved in fire with exposures and vegetation." The fire reportedly engulfed the home and spread to the nearby brush and jumped to neighboring houses. Firefighters quickly shifted to a defensive strategy to contain the blaze and prevent it from spreading further into the surrounding vegetation. The flames consumed the stilts supporting the home, causing it to collapse onto the hillside. Meanwhile, embers scattered into nearby brush, prompting crews to act swiftly with water hoses to extinguish them. LAFD deployed over 50 firefighters, who brought the fire under control within two hours. No injuries were reported in the immediate aftermath of the incident. The fire took place shortly after another blaze was reported on the other side of the mountains in Hollywood Hills. The two fires were not related, LAFD said. Studio City is located in Hollywood. Notable residents have included Zac Efron, Leonardo DiCaprio, and Ryan Gosling, among others. The wildfires began on Tuesday around 11 a.m. when fire broke out in the Santa Monica mountains. The exact cause is still under investigation, but it is believed they are being fueled by strong Santa Ana winds and dry conditions after low rainfall this season. By 5 p.m. on Tuesday, the fire had burnt more than 1,260 acres, and hours later the authorities reported that it had spread to 2,900 acres. At least seven fires have occurred in Los Angeles. Those include the Palisades Fire in Pacific Palisades, which has already burned through more than 15,800 acres, as well as the Eaton Fire, which is raging inland close to Pasadena across 10,600 acres. Neither fire has been contained. The third fire, named the Hurst fire, is burning in Sylmar, in the San Fernando Valley northwest of Los Angeles. That has affected 855 acres but is now 10 percent contained. Meanwhile, the Lidia Fire began on Wednesday in Acton, to the northeast of Santa Clarita, and was at nearly 350 acres with 40 percent containment. A fifth fire, the Woodley Fire in the Sepulveda Basin, was quickly brought under control on Wednesday, burning across 30 acres. The Tyler Fire, in Coachella, was fully contained on Wednesday after spreading across 15 acres and destroying 2 structures. The Sunset fire burned across 60 acres in the Hollywood hills on Wednesday night. The wildfires have prompted the mandatory evacuation of more than 130,000 people so far. Evacuation orders are currently in place in Pasadena, Altadena and Sierra Madre, as well as in Calabasas, Malibu, parts of Los Angeles, Pacific Palisades and Topanga Canyon. Los Angeles Fire Department said: "Over 50 firefighters extinguished the fire with no injuries reported. The fire extended into the surrounding vegetation, created small spot fires and caused some (extent not known at this time) damage to exposed buildings." Adam Vangerpen, a spokesperson with LAFD, told KTLA: "We did just have the winds pick up again so we are seeing some ember casting from that four-story structure. Our hope is to hit it hard, and we're trying to keep it out of the brush right now." Firefighters and other emergency workers continue battling the major fires burning in and around Los Angeles and assisting in evacuation efforts. While the potent winds driving the fires to rapidly escalate were expected to die down by Thursday night, the initial causes of all the blazes remain under investigation.
