                <h2 class="article-title">Antonio Pierce - Wikipedia</h2>
                <p class="article-content">Antonio Durran Pierce[1] (born October 26, 1978) is an American professional football coach and former linebacker who was most recently the head coach of the Las Vegas Raiders of the National Football League (NFL) in 2024. He previously served as the linebackers coach for the Raiders from 2022 to 2023. Pierce played nine seasons as a linebacker in the National Football League (NFL) and he won a Super Bowl playing with the New York Giants in the 2007 season. He played college football for the Arizona Wildcats and was signed as an undrafted free agent by the Washington Redskins, and later played for the Giants. In 2014, Pierce began his coaching career as the head coach at Long Beach Polytechnic High School and then served as an assistant coach at Arizona State University from 2018 to 2021. Pierce played high school football at Paramount High School in Paramount, California. As a senior for the Pirates, Pierce earned All-CIF Southern Section Division 2 accolades at linebacker while also playing at the fullback position.[2][3] He then played two years of football at Mount San Antonio College in Walnut, California, before transferring to the University of Arizona. In the fall of 1997 as a sophomore, Pierce helped lead Mt. SAC to the CCCAA state title, intercepting a pass for the Mounties in the fourth quarter of a 38–35 win over San Francisco City College.[4] As a senior at Arizona, he had three sacks, 77 tackles (ten for losses), two forced fumbles, one interception, and one blocked kick, earning All-Pac-10 honorable mention.[5] Pierce was not taken in the 2001 NFL draft after his senior year because many NFL scouts considered him too undersized to play linebacker in the NFL.[6] The Washington Redskins signed him as an undrafted free agent in 2001. He played in all 16 games as a rookie, with only eight starts. He recorded 52 tackles, one sack, and one interception during his rookie campaign. The interception came against Jake Plummer. Over the next two seasons, Pierce played sporadically, recording only 18 and 15 tackles respectively, during the 2002 and 2003 seasons. It was not until the 2004 season, his fourth in the league, that he played a full season, upon replacing the injured Micheal Barrow.[7] That season, Pierce logged a career-high 114 tackles, 95 of them solo. He also had one forced fumble, one sack, and two interceptions, including a pick off Ken Dorsey returned 76 yards for a touchdown. The New York Giants signed Pierce on March 3, 2005, to start at middle linebacker. He became the captain of the defense, and in 13 games, Pierce notched 100 tackles, 80 of them solo, two interceptions, and one forced fumble returned for a touchdown. His 2005 season ended early as he suffered a leg injury, against the Philadelphia Eagles, and missed the final three regular season games as well as the Giants' only postseason game, a 23–0 loss to the Carolina Panthers. In 2006, Pierce recorded a career-high 138 tackles (109 solo), a sack, an interception, and defended eight passes. Pierce was named as a first alternate for the Pro Bowl. He was invited to play in Hawaii after Brian Urlacher suffered a toe injury in Super Bowl XLI, and withdrew from the Pro Bowl. In the 2007 season, Pierce was a central figure in the Giants' path to their third Super Bowl title. He made a key tackle in the first half of the NFC Championship game against the Green Bay Packers, stopping running back Brandon Jackson on a screen pass on 3rd and 8,[8] saving a touchdown and forcing the Packers to settle for a field goal instead. The Giants would go on to win in overtime.[9] On the early morning hours of November 9, 2008, at a night club in New York City, Plaxico Burress accidentally discharged an unlicensed gun in his pocket, injuring his thigh.[10] No one called the police, which is required by New York law when a gunshot accident occurs. Pierce helped Burress and rushed him to a nearby hospital to tend to his injury. Pierce was then sought by the NYPD for questioning as it is against New York law not to report a shooting, which Pierce or anyone else in attendance did not do. Eventually, Pierce talked to the police and did not face charges[11] in the incident, also reiterating he didn't have any regrets for how he handled the incident. Pierce was released by the team on February 11, 2010. Following his release, Pierce announced his retirement from football on July 8, 2010. He also stated that he would then begin his career as an NFL analyst for ESPN.[12] On February 7, 2014, Pierce was named the head coach at national powerhouse Long Beach Polytechnic High School, replacing Raul Lara, who stepped down as the head coach of the program after 13 seasons.[13] After an 11–2 first season, the Jackrabbits struggled under Pierce, missing the playoffs for the first time in 36 years in his second season at the helm. The struggles continued in 2016 and 2017, with the program failing to reach double digit wins in both years and getting blown out in the playoffs. On December 21, 2017, Pierce announced his resignation as head coach and was named linebackers coach at Arizona State University. After two seasons as the Sun Devils' linebackers coach, Pierce was promoted to co-defensive coordinator alongside Marvin Lewis.[14] On January 20, 2021, Pierce was elevated to be the sole defensive coordinator at ASU after sharing the role with Marvin Lewis during the 2020 season.[15] He resigned during an NCAA recruiting violation investigation prior to 2022 season.[16] In August 2023, ASU announced a self-imposed bowl ban, hoping to lessen further penalties resulting from the ongoing investigation.[17] Following Pierce's resignation, the NCAA investigation continued, eventually determining that Pierce was the, "ringleader in orchestrating the recruiting violations" at ASU, and that Pierce, "used his position of authority to pressure staff members into engaging in violations, often by instilling fear that they would lose their jobs if they did not follow his orders".[18] This included ordering an assistant to commit recruiting tampering to attempt to land a transfer not in the transfer portal, and refusing to cooperate with the investigation.[19] Pierce's actions were described as a "scheme" and involved Pierce taking individuals to a gentleman's club as part of recruiting visits.[20] The NCAA levied an 8 year show-cause penalty against Pierce; should an NCAA school hire Pierce prior to 2032, he would serve a yearlong suspension.[21] In a statement regarding the penalties, ASU president Michael M. Crow declared the university to be, "disappointed and embarrassed by the actions of certain former football staff members who took advantage of a global pandemic to hide their behavior."[22] In 2022, Pierce was hired by the Las Vegas Raiders as their linebackers coach under head coach Josh McDaniels.[23] On October 31, 2023, Pierce was named the interim head coach of the Raiders following the firing of head coach Josh McDaniels.[24] He named Aidan O'Connell as the starting quarterback for the rest of the season on November 1, benching Jimmy Garoppolo.[25] On November 5, 2023, Pierce made his head coaching debut against the New York Giants, for whom he had previously played. The Raiders won the game 30–6, a season high in points for the Raiders at that point[26] On December 14, 2023, the Raiders defeated the Los Angeles Chargers 63–21, scoring the most points in franchise history.[27] A week later, on Christmas Day, the Raiders recorded their first win over the Kansas City Chiefs since 2020.[28] The Raiders were eliminated from playoff contention on New Year's Eve, following a 23–20 loss to the Indianapolis Colts. On January 19, 2024, the Raiders officially named Pierce the 23rd head coach in franchise history.[29] On January 7, 2025, Pierce was fired by the Raiders, after finishing 4–13 in 2024.[30] Pierce finished his tenure in Las Vegas with a 9–17 (.346) record. * Interim head coach Pierce is married to Jocelyn and is the father of seven. He currently resides in Palos Verdes Estates, California. His father, Cleo Burrows, is from Bermuda. Inspired by his own experiences growing up in Compton, it has become Pierce's mission to improve the quality of life for the youth in the Long Beach/Compton area. For several years, Pierce has offered a free football camp for underprivileged youths.[citation needed] In 2006, Pierce became the spokesperson for Giants Academy—a program for inner city youth geared toward helping these children succeed despite obstacles in their life. He is also involved in the "Read Across America" program where he reads to children whose parents are undergoing treatment for chemical dependency at the Odyssey House in Harlem.[31] In 2007, Pierce received the "United Way Man of the Year" award and was honored by the Catholic Diocese for his support of the community. Pierce was honored at the 2008 ESPY awards along with the Giants. Pierce was present when teammate Plaxico Burress negligently shot himself in the thigh at the Latin Quarter Night Club in New York City on November 28, 2008.[32] Police say that Pierce drove Burress to the hospital and then returned home with the gun in the glove compartment of his car. The police impounded Pierce's SUV to search for blood and gunpowder residue.[33] Burress was charged with, and ultimately pleaded guilty to, criminal possession of a weapon; however Pierce was not indicted on any charges. On August 3, 2009, Pierce was cleared of all criminal charges stemming from the incident.[34] He was represented in the matter by notable NYC criminal defense attorney, Michael F. Bachner.[35] Pierce served as a communications intern on The Howard Stern Show on May 7, 2008. He stated he would like to pursue a career in broadcasting after his NFL career.[36] Near the end of the day's show he asked to stay for the remainder of the week, which Stern agreed to.[37] # denotes interim head coach</p>

                <h2 class="article-title">Antonio Pierce says he's proud of how Raiders finished season - ESPN</h2>
                <p class="article-content">安东尼奥·皮尔斯在球队取得4胜13负的战绩后，反思了他执教拉斯维加斯突袭者队第一个完整赛季的经历。尽管他在周一结束赛季的新闻发布会上向记者发表讲话时，还没有与球队老板马克·戴维斯和总经理汤姆·特莱斯科会面，但他表现得好像他将继续担任突袭者队的教练。“我还没有得到任何不同的消息，”皮尔斯说，他身穿一件经典款的突袭者队“Starter”夹克站在讲台上。当被问及他是否希望自己的身份“澄清”时，皮尔斯耸了耸肩。“这些猜测都是来自外界的，”他说。“这在队内并没有传出。对我来说，直到我从队内得到消息之前，就没有什么需要澄清的。”因此，皮尔斯表示，他预计不会在球队赢得比赛数量自2018年以来最少的情况下对教练组进行任何调整。这也是自2006年以来突袭者队首次在美联西区比赛中全败。突袭者队经历了10连败，这是他们自2014赛季以0胜10负开局以来最长的赛季连败，并且拥有NFL中最差的冲球进攻。但拉斯维加斯在赛季结束前确实拥有联盟第十强的总防守，他们在对阵季后赛球队洛杉矶闪电队的比赛中以20比34告负。突袭者队的球员称赞皮尔斯在艰难的赛季中让球队保持专注。“向AP致敬，因为他一直激励着球员，即使你连续输了那么多场比赛，”外接手杰克比·迈尔斯说，他取得了职业生涯首次单赛季超过1000码。“这对一名职业球员来说很难，对一名竞争者来说也同样艰难。AP在让我们继续前进并理解最终目标方面做得很好。”新秀布洛克·鲍尔斯的112次接球是NFL历史上外接紧端第三高的接球次数，他也表达了与迈尔斯相同的观点。“我真的很喜欢AP作为教练，”入选职业碗的鲍尔斯说。“我知道有些决定是由特定的人做出的，而不是由我们做出的，所以我对此没有任何控制权。但我真的喜欢为他打球，我认为他是一位很棒的教练。”四分卫艾丹·奥康奈尔补充说：“他在这方面做得很好[激励球员]，试图和那些想继续战斗的球员谈谈。“球员们继续来上班，做正确的事，只是试图一点一点地克服困难。”皮尔斯说，他本应该在本赛季更多地听从自己的“直觉”，并暗示他后悔没有选择奥康奈尔而不是加德纳·明休作为本赛季的先发四分卫。“我们需要得到更好的球员，”皮尔斯说。“我们需要更好地执教。当你的胜场只有四场时，你需要在很多方面做得更好。”</p>

                <p class="article-content">拉斯维加斯突袭者：罪恶之城的黯淡前景

再次，突袭者球迷和分析师们议论纷纷，因为拉斯维加斯突袭者决定与主教练安东尼奥·皮尔斯分道扬镳，他只执教了一个完整的赛季。这个决定是在周一晚上宣布的，并在周二得到确认。这一决定是在突袭者经历了一个动荡的 4-13 赛季之后做出的，他们在整个赛季中都难以找到立足点。皮尔斯最初在 2023 年担任临时主教练，后来被任命为全职教练，他在任期内面临着诸多挑战。突袭者在四分卫位置上经历了不稳定，表现不稳定，以及伤病，这些都阻碍了球队在竞争激烈的美式橄榄球联盟西部赛区中竞争。尽管突袭者在赛季末的比赛中取得了两场胜利，但这也无法挽救皮尔斯的职位。球队的整体表现低于预期，这导致了他们寻找新领导层的决定。

相关：总经理汤姆·泰莱斯科保留了自己的职位，但他仍然会受到所有人的关注，他的任期还剩多长时间。

突袭者在解雇了他们的前主教练后发表了一份声明，他在一年前刚刚开始担任这个职位。球队在一份声明中说：“我们感谢安东尼奥的领导，首先是作为临时主教练，然后是过去一个赛季作为主教练。安东尼奥从小就是突袭者的球迷，他的银黑血统根深蒂固。我们感谢他能够在整个组织中重新燃起成为突袭者的意义。我们祝愿安东尼奥和他的家人未来一切顺利。”

寻找新主教练的工作将立即开始，突袭者正在寻找一位能够重振球队，带领他们重返季后赛竞争的领导者。关于潜在候选人的猜测已经开始蔓延，一些知名人士在早期讨论中被提及。
