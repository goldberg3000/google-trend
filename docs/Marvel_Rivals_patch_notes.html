                <p class="article-content">It’s almost time for Marvel Rivals Season 1 – the big update arrives on January 10, 2025, and the developers from NetEase Games have already revealed the balance changes that will come with the patch. Between Vanguards, Duelists, Strategists, and team-up abilities, the devs cooked up a whole host of adjustments based on collected data as well as community feedback. “Our analysis of battle data has revealed significant shifts in team compositions within regular matches, showcasing a vibrant diversity of lineups,” the developers wrote. “However, as the skill level escalates, compositions centered around double shields and ranged have displayed considerable prowess. Despite this, players have continuously honed and experimented with new compositions and strategies, further enriching the battlefield.” The stated goal for the changes in Season 1 is “enabling a broader roster to partake in more intricate gameplay, ensuring a richer, more engaging, and diverse gaming experience for all.” Find all Marvel Rivals Season 1 balance changes in the update 20250110 patch notes below. Hawkeye + Black Widow: Hela + Thor + Loki: Luna Snow + Namor: Rocket Raccoon + The Punisher + Winter Soldier: Scarlet Witch + Magneto: Thor + Storm + Captain America: NetEase already confirmed that a more extensive look at team-up abilities will take place at the beginning of Season 2, when more data is available on their use.

                <h2 class="article-title">Marvel Rivals Version 20250110 Balance Post – Season 1 Begins! _Marvel Rivals -  The Super Hero Team-based PVP Shooter</h2>
                <p class="article-content">2025/01/09 Hello, Rivals! As Season 0 draws to a close, our analysis of battle data has revealed significant shifts in team compositions within regular matches, showcasing a vibrant diversity of lineups. However, as the skill level escalates, compositions centered around double shields and ranged have displayed considerable prowess. Despite this, players have continuously honed and experimented with new compositions and strategies, further enriching the battlefield. For example, a potent combination featuring Psylocke and Star-Lord has brought unparalleled map control through high mobility and formidable mid-range damage, while pairings like Namor and Winter Soldier emphasized defensive counterattacks, fortifying the rear lines and seizing opportunities for combat advantage. Whether formations revolved around Hulk's might or Adam Warlock's team-up abilities or a selection of heroes tailored for specific scenarios, it became clear that players are delving deeper into the world of Marvel Rivals. Hence, in the first half of Season 1, we are set to make balance adjustments to certain heroes, enabling a broader roster to partake in more intricate gameplay, ensuring a richer, more engaging, and diverse gaming experience for all. At the same time, regarding Season Bonuses and Team-Ups, we'd like to clarify that given the brief duration of Season 0 and everyone's recent acclimatization to Marvel Rivals, we will not make extensive changes to or adjust Team-Up abilities in Season 1. Instead, we will make minor adjustments to the existing Team-Up values. Fear not, for we are planning exciting redesigns and adjustments to Team-Up abilities in Season 2!

                <h2 class="article-title">Marvel Rivals Season 1 Balance Update Is Full Of Buffs And Nerfs For Each Role: Full Patch Notes - GameSpot</h2>
                <p class="article-content">GameSpot may receive revenue from affiliate and advertising partnerships for sharing this content and from purchases through links. NetEase is giving some love to underperforming heroes while nerfing some of the game's strongest damage dealers. By Cameron Koch on January 8, 2025 at 11:26AM PST Marvel Rivals will soon kick off Season 1: Eternal Night Falls on January 10, and it wouldn't be a proper season start without a wide-range of balance changes to spice up the game's still in flux meta. In a blog post, developer NetEase outlined some of its philosophy in regards to the game's upcoming buffs and nerfs, stating it looked to adjust certain heroes in the name of "enabling a broader roster to partake in more intricate gameplay, ensuring a richer, more engaging, and diverse gaming experience for all." It outlined a number of different team compositions and strategies players are employing, and overall seems happy with what it calls a "vibrant diversity of lineups." That lineup is certain to change with the addition of the Fantastic Four this season, with heroes Mr. Fantastic and the Invisible Woman joining the roster at the season's start.

By clicking 'enter', you agree to GameSpot's Terms of Use and Privacy Policy enter As for the changes themselves, there are a number of buffs and nerfs to heroes in each role, with a significant number of changes to Duelist heroes. Popular damage dealers Hawkeye and Hela are being brought down a peg, with Hela having her health slightly decreased while Hawkeye will no longer be doing quite as much damage at longer ranges. On the flipside, Black Widow (one of the game's least-picked heroes according to NetEase), is getting a number of buffs. Moon Knight's ultimate ability will be more effective in Season 1, while Psylocke's will be a little less effective as it will have to cut through enemy shields as well. Storm is getting much-needed buffs, with increased projectile speed and damage, as well as more bonus health upon finishing her ultimate ability. Winter Soldier, another popular Duelist pick, is losing a little damage but gaining more survivability. On the Vanguard front, Venom, Thor, and Captain America are receiving buffs to keep them in the fight for longer, while Hulk and Doctor Strange are receiving nerfs. NetEase states that Hulk in particular has been "dominant," and is nerfing his gamma shield value as a result. Most Strategists, Marvel Rivals' support heroes, are receiving some buffs, though Luna Snow and Mantis are seeing nerfs. Mantis is losing some movement speed from her Nature's Favor passive. Meanwhile, it will now take longer for Luna Snow to swap between damage and healing during her ultimate. Jeff the Land Shark, Rocket Raccoon, and Cloak & Dagger are all receiving buffs to their healing capabilities, as well as changes to make it easier to see who is about to be gobbled up by Jeff's ultimate. Changes are coming to many of the game's team-up abilities, though nothing too drastic. NetEase clarified that it didn't want to make extensive changes for Season 1, but is currently planning "exciting redesigns and adjustments" as part of Season 2. In addition to the balance changes, NetEase released pick and win rates for each of the game's heroes, revealing who some of its most popular characters are. Though there are some differences between competitive and ranked play, characters like Peni Parker, as well as almost every Specialist hero, sit at the top of the charts (which makes sense given how there are fewer Specialist heroes compared to Vanguard or Duelists). Sitting at the bottom of the pick rates are Wolverine, Black Widow, Namor, and Storm, all of whom are receiving some buffs in Season 1. You can read the full patch notes below. For more on Marvel Rivals Season 1, here's everything we know so far.
