                <h2 class="article-title">What is national day of mourning? Explaining the Jimmy Carter honor</h2>
                <p class="article-content">The late former President Jimmy Carter will be honored with a national day of mourning Thursday on the same day as a state funeral is planned in Washington, D.C. Services began Saturday to honor Carter, who died Dec. 29 at the age of 100. After lying in repose at the Carter Presidential Center in Georgia, Carter's remains arrived Tuesday in D.C., where he is scheduled to lie in state at the United States Capitol rotunda ahead of funeral services. President Joe Biden declared Jan. 9 as a national day of mourning for Carter, who served one term as U.S. president from 1977 to 1981 before becoming a renowned world humanitarian. Here's what to know about a national day of mourning, including the history of the honor, what it means and what federal agencies will be closed Thursday. When is Jimmy Carter's funeral?See full schedule as remains are transported to DC this week A national day of mourning is a day to honor and pay respects to a revered public figure who has died, most commonly a U.S. president. In the case of Jimmy Carter, the national day of mourning will be held on the same day as the 39th president's funeral at Washington National Cathedral. The most recent president to be honored with a national day of mourning was George H.W. Bush after his death in December 2018. The tradition began in 1865 with a one-day government shutdown six weeks after Abraham Lincoln's assassination, according to the New York Times. While several presidents have been honored with a day of mourning in the subsequent years, others have been commemorated as well. The Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. and Robert F. Kennedy were each honored with a national day of mourning after they were assassinated in 1968. President Biden, who will deliver a eulogy at the funeral, has also ordered for U.S. flags to fly at half-staff for Carter for 30 days following his death. The honor is one granted to all sitting or former presidents under a 1954 proclamation signed by President Dwight D. Eisenhower. For Carter, flags will fly at half-staff – or half-mast, in the case of ships and naval stations – until Jan. 28. That means the flags will still be at half-staff during President-elect Donald Trump’s Jan. 20 inauguration. Biden issued an executive order Dec. 30 that “all executive departments and agencies of the Federal Government shall be closed on Jan. 9,” except those necessary for “national security, defense, or other public need.” That means federal employees will have a paid day off. Here's a list of agencies and services that will briefly close for the day: Eric Lagatta covers breaking and trending news for USA TODAY. Reach him at elagatta@gannett.com</p>

                <p class="article-content">Success For Each Child & Eliminate the Opportunity Gap by Leading with Racial Equity The National Day of Mourning takes place each year on the fourth Thursday of November, and is a day that provides a respectful counterpoint to Thanksgiving by recognizing that a historical moment may have been assumed to be a joyful occasion on one side, but it was also the catalyst for tragedy on the other. This is why, for many in the Indigenous and Native American community, this date is not a celebrated beginning, but an ending of an era, and an all too brutal reminder of genocide, theft, and centuries of active violence and erasure against our country’s ancient Indigenous culture. Most of all, the day remembers the unjust treatment of the Indigenous and Native American people since that first Plymouth landing in 1620. Commemorated with events, marches, speeches, and protests, the National Day of Mourning honors the deaths of millions while also providing the catharsis of remembrance and spiritual connection – and a call to action against the continued racism and oppression experienced by Indigenous and Native Americans today.

The National School Lunch Program (NSLP) serves nearly 30 million children every school day, providing the essential basic nutrition that contributes to student success and teacher support. President John F. Kennedy created National School Lunch Week (NSLW) in 1962 to promote the importance of a healthy school lunch in a child’s life, as well as the impact a simple school lunch can have both inside and outside the classroom. We are excited to announce the selection of two new student representatives to the Puget Sound Educational Service District (PSESD) Board of Directors. We welcome Maricella Gonzalez from Puyallup High School (Pierce County) and James Young from Mercer Island High School (King County) to the Board this year. Taking place on the second Monday of October each year, Indigenous Peoples Day celebrates the culture and history of the indigenous American peoples in the United States. Former Washington state Governor Chris Gregoire once said "Show me a great school and I’ll show you a great principal," perfectly capturing the spirit of National Principals Month, which takes place each October. Happy #SignLanguagesDay and the International Day of Sign Languages! It's a timely reminder to support greater accessibility to sign language everywhere, to make the world more inclusive for the over 70 million Deaf people across the globe. September 15 marked the anniversary of the day when the last Cherokees arrived in Oklahoma in 1838, and September 16, is the Trail of Tears Remembrance Day. The new Behavior Supports in Schools Collaborative is a multidisciplinary network for Washington’s educational ecosystem. Registration for the first quarterly meeting is now OPEN! Join us virtually this September to build connections with colleagues statewide. September is Suicide Prevention Awareness Month, offering an ideal opportunity to speak out and raise awareness on this vital topic — an awareness that is urgently required, with suicide the tenth leading cause of death among adults in the U.S. — and the second leading cause of death among children and young people aged 10–24. Unfortunately, these rates are increasing, and those who are young, LGBTQ, or BIPOC are especially vulnerable. LGBTQ youth are four times more likely to attempt suicide, while transgender adults, meanwhile, are almost 12 times more likely than the general population to attempt suicide. Celebrated every August 26, Women’s Equality Day provides an essential and poignant remembrance of the passage of women’s suffrage in the U.S. It is also a reminder of the heroic women who suffered violence, torture, death and discrimination as they fought for equal rights for women, including the right to vote. Created by UNESCO to memorialize the horrors of the transatlantic slave trade, Slavery Remembrance Day, also known as International Day for the Remembrance of the Slave Trade and its Abolition, is observed on August 23 worldwide. Upon this day, it's important that we remember that this observance is not only a reminder of the horrors of slavery as we honor its victims—it's also about our dedication across the globe to ensure that slavery, and the racism that caused it, is abolished once and for all. Celebrated each August 14, Navajo Code Talkers Day honors the courageous achievements of the over 400 Navajo men who were recruited to the U.S. Marine Corps during World War II. Unfortunately today, K-12 Education is a declining state priority: Immediately following the McCleary “Solution,” more than half of Washington's general fund budget was dedicated to K-12 education. Since then, K-12 spending in the state’s general fund budget has continued to grow but K-12 education is no longer the funding priority. Commemorating the historic meeting of the first United Nations Working Group on Indigenous Populations in 1982, International Day of the World’s Indigenous People (August 9) provides us with the chance to promote the rights of Indigenous People worldwide, while also amplifying their voices, cultures, and accomplishments. In these days of increased concern over climate change, the knowledge and commitment of many indigenous peoples to sustainability and biodiversity may in fact prove crucial to protecting the earth for future generations. As a haunting reminder of the destructive power of the atomic bomb, August 6 is Hiroshima Day, when the city of Hiroshima holds the Peace Memorial Ceremony to mourn and commemorate the victims of the detonation of the atomic bomb in that city by the United States on August 6, 1945. Far too often, the history books seem to focus on the men who made the impacts, the men who made the achievements—and then men who looked to the stars. Yet throughout history, the eyes of women have focused on the stars as intensively as men, and to them belong many great achievements and discoveries as they played essential roles in a variety of scientific and astronomical breakthroughs. Which is why, every August 1, we celebrate Women Astronomers Day. © 2022 Puget Sound Educational Service District</p>

                <h2 class="article-title">National Day of Mourning (United States protest) - Wikipedia</h2>
                <p class="article-content">The National Day of Mourning is an annual demonstration, held on the fourth Thursday in November, that aims to educate the public about Native Americans in the United States, notably the Wampanoag and other tribes of the Eastern United States; dispel myths surrounding the Thanksgiving story in the United States; and raise awareness toward historical and ongoing struggles facing Native American tribes. The first National Day of Mourning demonstration was held in 1970 after Frank "Wamsutta" James's speaking invitation was rescinded from a Massachusetts Thanksgiving Day celebration commemorating the 350th anniversary of the landing of the Mayflower. James instead delivered his speech on Cole's Hill in Plymouth, Massachusetts next to a statue of Ousamequin, where he described Native American perspectives on the Thanksgiving celebrations. The gathering became an annual event organized by the United American Indians of New England (UAINE) and coincides with both Thanksgiving Day in the United States and with Unthanksgiving Day, an annual ceremony held on Alcatraz Island in California. In the fall of 1970, the Commonwealth of Massachusetts held a commemorative Thanksgiving celebration on the 350th anniversary of the first landing of the Mayflower. The event's organizers, including Governor Francis Sargent, invited Frank "Wamsutta" James to speak at the event. James was the leader of the Wampanoag Tribe of Gay Head and president of the Federated Eastern Indian League.[1][2][3][4] The event's organizers requested to review James' speech in advance of the event. Once it had been reviewed, James was informed that he would not be permitted to give the speech as written. Of particular dispute was James's depiction of the winter of 1620-21, in which Pilgrims scavenged corn and beans found in burial grounds in a desperate bid to fend off starvation; James had planned to use his speech to accuse the Pilgrims of grave robbing and theft.[5] An alternate speech, written by the event's public relations team, was provided to him.[3][2][4] A representative from the Department of Commerce and Development explained to James that According to a recollection from Tall Oak, who continues to participate in modern National Days of Mourning, the event organizers anticipated that James's accusations would have been rejected by most of those in attendance, had he been allowed to issue them: "we can’t allow you to read that (be)cause 90% of the people would walk out."[5] Wamsutta Frank James, Tall Oak Weeden, Gary Parker, Shirley Mills, Rayleen Bey, and several other people organized speakers, recruited attendees on a national scale, and arranged accommodations for out-of-town guests. The first National Day of Mourning event was held on Thanksgiving Day, November 26, 1970, on Cole's Hill in Plymouth, Massachusetts. James delivered an amended speech[1] beside a statue of Ousamequin, including You the white man are celebrating an anniversary. We the Wampanoags will help you celebrate in the concept of a beginning. It was the beginning of a new life for the Pilgrims. Now, 350 years later it is a beginning of a new determination for the original American: the American Indian."Frank "Wamsutta" James, first National Day of Mourning, November 26, 1970[2][4] The event was attended by close to 500 Native Americans from throughout the United States[1] and has been held annually on the fourth Thursday in November every year since. James' speech was one of the first public criticisms of the Thanksgiving story from Native American groups.[2] The United American Indians of New England (UAINE), founded by James in 1970, continues to organize the annual National Day of Mourning rally at Cole's Hill.[6] The event's objectives include At the 1995 event, protestors dumped sand and seaweed on Plymouth Rock as part of the demonstration. In 1997, police attacked peaceful National Day of Mourning marchers, which included the use of pepper spray. Twenty-five marchers were arrested and charged with misdemeanor as well as felony crimes. Plymouth agreed to drop the charges in a 1998 settlement with UAINE. The National Day of Mourning protest is held annually at Cole's Hill and is attended by several hundred participants.[9][4] Estimates of attendance in 2021 range from 1,000 – 2,000.[10] Frank James' son Roland Moonanum James continued to be involved in the event until his death in December 2020[11][2], and Frank's granddaughter Kisha James helps organize it in her role as UAINE youth coordinator. Mahtowin Munro has been co-leader since the 1990s.[9] During the COVID-19 pandemic, the rally was held both in-person and virtually, and over 1600 people tuned in to the livestream and more than 20,000 to the online video.[9]</p>
