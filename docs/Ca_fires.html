                <h2 class="article-title">Incidents | CAL FIRE</h2>
                <p class="article-content">Ongoing emergency responses in California, including all 10+ acre wildfires. December, 2024- Following recent rainfall that has moderated fire activity, CAL FIRE is transitioning to Winter Preparedness staffing levels statewide. This adjustment aligns with a seasonal decrease in fire activity and aims to strategically optimize resources as fire risks lessen during the cooler months. Although California experienced a higher-than-usual number of fires this year, total acreage burned remains slightly below the five-year average but exceeds last year's figures. Forecasts indicate that above-normal temperatures and below-normal precipitation will persist through February, sustaining elevated fire risk, particularly in Southern California. An increased frequency of offshore wind events may also heighten fire concerns in specific areas. Over the next several months, an active Jet Stream is expected to bring cool, moist conditions, encouraging the growth of lowland vegetation and snow in higher elevations. These conditions, combined with a shift toward greener fuels, are expected to lower the potential for significant fires over the next 2-3 months. Southern California remains the exception, where some heightened fire risk may persist. Despite these seasonal shifts, CAL FIRE remains vigilant and prepared to respond to any challenges posed by the ongoing elevated fire risk. The resources that CAL FIRE staffs year-round will spend these months engaged in fuel reduction projects and other fire prevention efforts as weather permits. Incident data is provided in raw, computer readable formats and requires further processing using specialized software. Two additional API parameters include year (values include a year in the YYYY format) and inactive (values include true and false). CAL FIRE doesn’t provide software development support at this time. Information presented on the departments website is a representation of the existing wildfire situation, based on the information readily available to CAL FIRE. We make every effort to provide accurate and complete information, however the data is subject to review and change. This site provides general information concerning an incident. All of our information comes from the firelines and must be approved by the Incident Commander in charge of managing the incident prior to release. As battling a fire, or handling any other disaster is the priority, updates to these sites cannot be guaranteed on a set time schedule. Please use the information on these pages only as a reference. The sites are not meant to provide up-to-the-minute evacuation or fire behavior information. Please refer to the fire information phone numbers provided on this site, and website links for additional information, and monitor your local radio stations for emergency broadcasts. If you live in a wildland area always have an evacuation plan in place. Fires occur throughout the State within CAL FIRE jurisdiction on a daily basis during fire season. However, the majority of those fires are contained quickly and no information will generally be provided on these incidents at this site if the fire burns less than 10 acres. If you would like to obtain information about a CAL FIRE fire burning in your area that is not included on this web site, please contact the CAL FIRE Unit that services your county.</p>

                <h2 class="article-title">California wildfires live updates: 5 killed, Palisades Fire grows as Sunset Fire spreads through Hollywood Hills, 180,000 people evacuated</h2>
                <p class="article-content">Manage your account The deadly fires roaring through Los Angeles County continued Thursday, leaving at least five people dead, over 1,000 structures destroyed and around 180,000 people forced to evacuate, and prompting thousands of firefighters to descend on the region to try to extinguish the flames. The Palisades Fire, which has burned more than 17,000 acres, has become the most destructive wildfire to ever hit L.A. “Damage assessments are ongoing at the Palisades fire. Preliminary reports estimate the damage or destroyed structures to be in the thousands,” Los Angeles city Fire Chief Kristin Crowley said during a news conference Thursday morning. According to the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection, in addition to the Palisades Fire, four other blazes are currently burning: the Eaton Fire, which has torched 10,600 acres so far; the Hurst Fire, which has burned around 855 acres but is 10% contained; the Lidia Fire, which has grown to 348 acres but has 40% containment; and the Sunset Fire, around 43 acres. Aside from the Lidia and Hurst fires, officials say these wildfires are 0% contained. The Sunset Fire erupted in the densely populated Hollywood Hills late Wednesday, prompting more evacuations in areas like Hollywood Boulevard and Runyon Canyon Park. Los Angeles Department of Water and Power (LADWP) CEO and Chief Engineer Janisse Quiñones told reporters that power to about 200,000 customers has been restored since the wind storm started, while about 95,000 customers in Los Angeles remained without power as of Thursday morning. There are about 118 DWP crews working to restore power, prioritizing downed power lines. Power restoration has been ranging between 24 to 48 hours. "If you see a wire down, please call 911," Quiñones advised. A boil water advisory is still in place for the Pacific Palisades zip code of 90272 and will remain in effect for at least 48 hours. "I have water quality engineers taking samples around the system to ensure that the water quality remains a priority for our customers," Quiñones said. In addition to another round of Santa Ana winds, relative humidity is expected to drop this afternoon throughout Southern California — potentially to as low as 5%, according to ABC7 LA. Wind, humidity and temperature all influence fire behavior, the Western Fire Chiefs Association explains. Fires spread in hot, dry and windy conditions. Low humidity levels can cause a spike in fire danger because they make wildfire fuels — anything and everything combustible — more receptive to ignite on fire. "Unfortunately I think the death toll will rise," L.A. County Sheriff Robert Luna told the press Thursday morning. "I hope I'm wrong, but I think it's going to rise." Officials have reported that at least five people have been killed by the fires over the last few days, all of those in the Eaton Fire. At least 180,000 people are under mandatory evacuation orders and thousands of homes and structures are estimated to have been destroyed. At a press conference Thursday morning, Los Angeles Fire Department Chief Kristin Crowley said the Palisades Fire has destroyed "thousands" of structures, a dramatic revision from the initial estimate of 1,000 thought to be burned. “Damage assessments are ongoing at the Palisades Fire. However, preliminary reports estimate the damage or destroyed structures to be in the thousands,” Crowley said. The Palisades Fire had already been named one of the most destructive fires in Los Angeles history, but the new estimate on the number of structures destroyed means that it could end up being one of the most destructive fires in state history. "Destructive" fires are defined by how many structures were destroyed in a given event, not by how many acres the fire covers. "Structures" specifically refer to homes and commercial properties. According to the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection, here's a list of the most destructive wildfires recorded in the state — before the Palisades and Eaton fires — including the year they occurred, the acres burned and the number of structures destroyed. A red flag warning remains in effect for L.A. County and the majority of Ventura County through Friday, fire officials said Thursday morning. "Today we expect winds to subside somewhat, which will allow fire crews to increase containment lines," said Los Angeles Fire Department Chief Kristin Crowley. "We are still under red flag warning with extreme fire behavior possibilities," she stressed. In the Pacific Palisades region, wind gusts are up to 60 mph and will continue throughout the day. The National Weather Service says, "A Red Flag Warning is issued to indicate the imminent danger of severe fire weather with a relatively high probability of occurrence. Usually the fire danger is in the very high to extreme category. A Red Flag Warning will normally be issued for potential severe fire weather events in less than 12 hours." Fire officials provided updates Thursday morning on the wildfires raging across Southern California. Los Angeles Fire Department Chief Kristin Crowley told reporters the Palisades Fire is "one of the most destructive natural disasters in the history of Los Angeles." Here are the latest updates Crowley and Los Angeles County Fire Department Chief Anthony Marrone provided: Palisades Fire: 17,234 acres with 0% containment as "extreme fire behavior" continues to challenge firefighting efforts in the area as wind gusts are up to 60 mph. Damage assessments are ongoing, but destroyed structures are estimated to be in the thousands, according to Crowley. Eaton Fire: 10,600 acres and 0% containment, but growth has been significantly stopped. There are several reported injuries and over 1,000 structures damaged and destroyed, according to Marrone. Hurst Fire: 855 acres with 0% containment and a containment perimeter has been established. Lidia Fire: 348 acres, 40% contained, forward progress has been stopped. Sunset Fire: 42.8 acres and 0% contained. Woodley Fire: 30 acres and fully contained, no current threats. Sunswept Fire: LAFD firefighters stopped forward progress at just under 1 acre. The cause of all the wildfires listed above are under active investigation. Slide the divider across the images below to see how several locations in the Pacific Palisades area have been devastated by the Palisades Fire, which has spread across more than 17,000 acres and was at 0% containment as of Thursday morning. The Los Angeles Fire Department has lifted all remaining evacuation orders for the Sunset Fire, which has covered 43 acres, and is advising residents to be careful when returning to their homes. One of the five Eaton Fire victims was identified by his family on Wednesday morning after they found him lying on the side of the road near his home holding a garden hose, KTLA reported. “It looks like he was trying to save the home that his parents had for almost 55 years,” a family friend told the outlet. The 66-year-old man lived in the house with his younger sister who said she could not convince him to evacuate the area with her on Tuesday night. Others close to the victim explained to KTLA that he had health problems that "prevented him from moving around very well." Another wave of Santa Ana winds is anticipated to enter Los Angeles tonight and continue into Friday morning, according to the National Weather Service. This includes widespread winds of 35 mph to 55 mph in mountain areas and the foothills. With the forecast of more winds, most of the Los Angeles area will continue to be under serious fire risk for the rest of the week as five wildfires keep spreading. The wildfires have led numerous school districts in Los Angeles County to close schools for the second straight day. Here's the updated list of closures as of 6:30 a.m. local time: Alhambra Unified School District Arcadia Unified School District Beverly Hills Unified School District Burbank Unified School District (closed through Jan. 10) Duarte Unified School District Garvey School District Glendale Unified School District (closed through Jan. 10) Glendora Unified School District La Canada Unified (closed through Jan. 10) LAUSD: All schools are closed on Jan. 9. View LAUSD updates on its website Monrovia Unified School District Pasadena Unified School District (closed through Jan. 10) San Gabriel Unified School District Santa Monica Malibu Unified School District South Pasadena Unified School District Temple City Unified School District The wildfires tearing through Los Angeles are creating surreal, apocalyptic scenes, including for TV reporters on the ground covering them. Robert Kovacik, a correspondent for NBC's Los Angeles affiliate, was reporting live from the Palisades Fire when a resident who was evacuating his home on a bike asked him to hold onto his paintings. "Listen, I'll take them for you, I work at NBC, I'll make sure you get them," Kovacik told the unidentified man, who rode away. If you're looking to contribute to those affected by the California wildfires, there are a host of options. GoFundMe has a centralized page of verified fundraisers related to the disasters. The Los Angeles Fire Department Foundation is requesting emergency funds to provide hydration backpacks, personal fire shelters and wildland brush tools to local firefighters. The Canine Rescue Club is seeking volunteers to temporarily foster dogs displaced by the fires. There are many more ways to help out. The Los Angeles Times has a list here. Wildfires continue to burn in Los Angeles, scorching tens of thousands of acres, destroying hundreds if not thousands of homes, forcing more than 100,000 evacuations and leaving at least five people dead, officials say. • There are five active wildfires in Los Angeles County, according to Cal Fire: Palisades Fire: 17,234 acres, 0% containment Eaton Fire: 10,600 acres, 0% containment Hurst Fire: 855 acres, 10% containment Lidia Fire: 348 acres, 40% containment Sunset Fire: 43 acres, 0% containment • More than 130,000 people are under evacuation orders. • The fires have destroyed more than 1,100 structures. • More than 250,000 customers remain without power. • The Los Angeles Unified School District announced the closure of all public schools on Thursday. • President Biden approved California Gov. Gavin Newsom's request for a major disaster declaration, pledging more federal resources to support ongoing response efforts. Another fire-scarred day in Los Angeles ended with fresh evacuations and fears that the worst might not yet be over when the Sunset Fire in the Hollywood Hills erupted in the late afternoon, sparking more evacuations and devastation. Here's a recap of what transpired Wednesday in what Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass called "the big one in magnitude”: Five of seven major wildfires burning across the region had 0% containment as of Wednesday evening At least five people were reported killed in the Eaton Fire More than 1,000 structures were destroyed, although that could be a conservative estimate More than 130,000 were forced to evacuate their homes and businesses The Los Angeles Unified School District announced the closure of all public schools on Thursday Fire crews from neighboring states began arriving to help exhausted local firefighters Power outages topped 1.5 million in the state A fast-moving fire in the Hollywood Hills erupted early Wednesday evening. I took the above photo from the Silver Lake area of Los Angeles around 5:45 p.m. local time. The Palisades Fire is to the left and the Hollywood sign is to the right. Runyon Canyon and the historic Hollywood Bowl are in the densely populated area located near where the flames broke out. They reached about two blocks north of the Chateau Marmont. Because the wind had died down from earlier in the day, helicopters were quickly deployed to the scene and about 10 could seen in the air. Within an hour, from about 7 miles away, it seemed like the fire was mostly contained. As residents heeded evacuation orders for the Sunset Fire and attempted to leave the Hollywood Hills area, traffic was snarled for miles. CBS reporter Andre Tinoco posted footage of the gridlock on Franklin and La Brea avenues about half an hour after mandatory evacuation orders were sent out. A new wildfire erupted Wednesday evening, this one in the Hollywood Hills area, Los Angeles Fire Chief Kristin Crowley said at a press conference. She noted that the fire department was already responding to the situation and excused herself from the meeting to join in the effort. Sunset Fire, which it has been named as has covered 20 acres already. Chris Christi, a helicopter reporter for ABC7 Los Angeles, shared a photo of the fire on X. The LAFD sent out an emergency alert to residents and posted mandatory evacuations for the area of the new fire. "A wildfire is burning at Runyon Canyon," the alert read. "Those nearby should get set for a potential evacuation. Monitor local news, LAFD social media, and lafd.org/alerts for updates. Evacuation preparation info here: lafd.org/ready-set-go." Eyewitnesses say the latest blaze is rapidly expanding in a densely populated area. All Los Angeles public schools and offices will be closed Thursday, Superintendent Alberto Carvalho said at a Wednesday evening press conference. A decision on whether schools and offices will remain closed on Friday will be announced Thursday at 4 p.m. PST. "The confluence of factors" from the wildfires have "created dangerous, complex situations that present unsafe conditions for our school communities," a statement posted to social media said. Some meals and mental health services will be available for Los Angeles Unified School District students despite the school closings.</p>

                <p class="article-content">Profile Sections Local tv Featured More From NBC Follow NBC News news Alerts There are no new alerts at this time This live blog has now ended — the follow the latest updates here. Phil Helsel A large house fire that erupted in the Studio City area of Los Angeles tonight, causing fears that it could spread to vegetation, has been knocked down, the Los Angeles Fire Department said. Around 50 firefighters extinguished the fire, which broke out at around 8:52 p.m. on North Sunswept Drive, the LAFD said. No injuries were reported. The fire erupted amid dry conditions that are causing a high risk of wildfires in the Los Angeles area. Firefighters placed a priority on not only defending the structure but also keeping the flames from spreading into the brush, the fire department said. Two major wildfires, the Palisades Fire and the Eaton Fire, have burned more than 26,000 acres combined and destroyed many homes. Both are still burning. Five people died in the Eaton Fire, officials said. Phil Helsel The Pasadena Humane Society said it has taken in over 300 animals, some of them injured, as people fled the Eaton Fire, which has destroyed homes and killed five people. “We are starting to see many animals coming in with burns and injuries,” the organization said on Facebook. “These animals are being treated in our ICU. We are providing them with pain medications, wound care, fluid, and oxygen as needed.” Dia DuVernet, president and CEO of the Pasadena Humane Society, said her heart goes out to all those affected. Many of the people fled with their animals. One of the members of the shelter's board of directors lost her home and her two cats, DuVernet said. Shelters in the area have been working with the group to save animals, and neighbors have been helping out by saving pets that got lost during the confusion, she said at a news conference earlier today. “It really has been heartwarming to see even our staff members who have been evacuated and who are losing their homes coming to the shelter to shelter with their pets and take care of other people’s pets,” DuVernet said. Dennis Romero A new blaze in the hills of the Studio City neighborhood of Los Angeles is drawing on firefighters already spread thin as L.A. is in the midst of multiple wildfires fanned by Santa Ana winds. The Los Angeles Fire Department reported that the focus of the fire was a four-story home on or near Sunswept Drive. The fire has since expanded and is now called the Sunswept Fire. "The Sunswept Fire is burning near Laurel Cyn [Canyon]/Mulholland/Coldwater Cyn/Ventura Blvd.," a city alert said tonight. "Those nearby should get set for a potential evacuation by gathering supplies and loved ones." The fire department said in an update that the residential fire included "exposures and vegetation." "Firefighters are in the defensive mode against the fire unit with priority of defending the exposures and preventing extension into the brush," it said. The area is northwest of the Sunset Fire in Hollywood, north of Franklin Canyon and Beverly Hills, amid the high vistas on the San Fernando Valley side of the Santa Monica Mountains. The range is also the focus of the Palisades Fire and the Sunset Fire. Anthony Correia Color infrared satellite images released by Maxar Technologies show the fires burning in Altadena on Wednesday, in stark comparison to the same location captured on Monday. The Eaton Fire has burned 10,600 acres and damaged or destroyed hundreds of homes and other buildings. Phil Helsel More than 7,500 people are fighting the wildfires in Southern California, Gov. Gavin Newsom said tonight as fires continued to burn in the Los Angeles area. Newsom this week toured the devastation wrought by the Palisades Fire and said many homes were destroyed. The Palisades Fire is the largest of the fires burning in the Los Angeles region, with more than 15,800 acres scorched, according to fire officials. The Eaton Fire, burning in the Altadena and Pasadena areas, has killed five people and burned more than 10,000 acres. Dennis Romero This week's windstorm-driven fires have put a spotlight on million-dollar family homes lost to flames, but the L.A. mayor's office says it's trying to make sure people without four walls are evacuated and sheltered. "The Los Angeles Homeless Services Authority (LAHSA) has been conducting outreach to individuals living on the streets in high fire severity zones since Friday, January 3rd, and will continue to do so in the coming days," Mayor Karen Bass' office said in an evening update on the city's wildfires. Her office said it will make vouchers for hotel stays available to homeless people, distributed through outreach workers and volunteers and the city's 211 helpline. The update said vouchers would be limited "based on capacity." Last year the city had nearly 30,000 people living outdoors and outside shelters, more than 10% fewer than in 2023, the homelessness authority said in a statement last year about the latest figures. The phenomenon, which correlates to untenable housing costs in the state, has a visible footprint on the sidewalks and streets of Hollywood, where the Sunset Fire was burning in the neighborhoods and hills north of Hollywood Boulevard. Dennis Romero The Pacific Palisades community at the center of the Palisades Fire remained under a boil water notice tonight, the Los Angeles mayor's office said in an update. The L.A. Department of Water and Power ordered the notice for the entire community and warned adjacent areas served by the utility to boil water before using it, too. It identified the Pacific Palisades ZIP code, 90272, as the focus of the notice. The ZIP code follows the community's boundaries. The department said the firefight has depleted water and the city system's usual water pressure, the latter of which thwarts contamination by keeping bacteria and foreign substances outside a water system even as it harbors some cracks and breaches. "Until adequate water pressure can be re-established, and water is tested and confirmed to be safe, this notice is in effect. It is possible that disease-causing organisms could be present," the department said in a statement. "These organisms include bacteria, viruses, and parasites that can cause symptoms such as nausea, cramps, diarrhea, and associated headaches," LADWP said. Dana Varinsky Although the ferocious winds that have fueled the Los Angeles-area fires should gradually diminish tonight, dangerous fire conditions are expected to persist through at least Friday. A high wind warning remains in effect until 10 p.m. PT for parts of greater Los Angeles, including the Malibu coast and the Santa Monica Mountains, according to the National Weather Service. Forecasts suggest wind speeds up to 40 mph in the affected areas, with gusts up to 60 mph. Red flag warnings will remain in effect across parts of Southern California through at least 6 p.m. Friday. Such warnings refer to an expected combination of warm temperatures, low humidity and strong winds that raises the risk of fire danger. Humidity levels are expected to stay low, and they could dip into single digits in some areas into Friday. “Prolonged elevated to critical fire weather is expected,” according to the fire weather outlook from the NWS Storm Prediction Center. Dennis Romero Wildfires are supposed to be wild. But the reach of this week's windstorm-driven blazes in Southern California has served as a reminder that flames don't stop at the wildland-urban interface. And if that's the case, few in this region of 25 million are truly safe from the ravages of such blazes. Mandatory evacuations for the Palisades Fire yesterday and the Sunset Fire tonight spread into century-old rectangular street grids and well-worn Main Streets seemingly insulated from fire by miles of concrete and steel structures. Authorities last night put the northern part of Santa Monica's North of Montana neighborhood under mandatory evacuation orders. The area included the city from San Vicente to the border with Los Angeles and its Pacific Palisades community. It's not in the hills, and it's not amid woods or brush. It's part of a larger Santa Monica neighborhood known for its expensive homes and Rodeo Drive-style boutiques. "This is staggering," Los Angeles Times reporter Julia Wick said on X last night, commenting on the Santa Monica part of the Palisades Fire evacuations. "For those unfamiliar with L.A. geography, the area in the evacuation warning is not in the hills." Likewise, evacuations tonight covered the western part of the Hollywood Hills, west of the 101 Freeway, from Mulholland Drive — which twists along the top of the mountains — to Hollywood Boulevard, a flatlands thoroughfare to the south that takes tourists to the El Capitan Entertainment Center, TCL Chinese Theatre, the Hollywood Walk of Fame, Madame Tussauds Hollywood and Ripley’s Believe It or Not! Some of the city's oldest multifamily structures line the boulevard in one of its densest neighborhoods. Just east of the boulevard's evacuation zone are Thai Town and its critically acclaimed eateries and Little Armenia, a location celebrating Armenian settlement in East Hollywood. The overlapping ethnic communities found life and commerce in the boulevard's vintage buildings. It's generally not a place where children learn how to hunt or fish or even about preparing for wildfires. But the lesson of wildfire crushing urban development is one told previously, when the Camp Fire in 2018 destroyed 85% of Paradise, California, 470 miles north of L.A. in the Sierra Nevada Mountains. A National Institute of Standards and Technology analysis of the Paradise Fire found that the density of the town actually made the fire worse and accelerated flames. "Propelling the Camp Fire’s structure-destroying spree were fires that spread within and between plots of land, or parcels, rather than from the fire front," said the analysis, published in 2021. "Sources such as burning sheds, plants, vehicles and neighboring houses caused many buildings to catch fire, either through direct contact with flames or embers generated in parcels." Gov. Gavin Newsom told NBC News today that the rapid devastation of the last two days in Southern California was something he could compare only to the Paradise Fire. "It's stunning," he said. "Nothing comes close." NBC News The Sunset Fire, which sparked tonight, has grown to 50 acres in the Hollywood Hills, but crews report progress in keeping it contained and are attacking it with aerial water drops. "There are active flames within the interior of the fire, but the perimeter is holding well thanks to a fire road and ground crews in place," the Los Angeles County Sheriff’s Department posted on social media this evening. "At the heel of the fire, active flames have been extinguished, though smoldering continues within the interior." An evacuation center has been set up at the Pan Pacific Recreational Center, at 7600 Beverly Blvd. Tom Llamas Marissa Hermer recalled being on a hike yesterday when she saw smoke and flames coming from behind her kids' school. That's when, she said, she raced down the mountain and picked up her kids and "got them out of there." As she tried driving into her neighborhood, Hermer said, she had to leave her car behind. "I walked into my neighborhood then — I wasn't able to drive — and got everything I could collect in my hands and walked out," she said. Since then, Hermer said, her kids have been asking her where they'll live and where they'll go to school. She doesn't have an answer for them right now. Hermer is the owner of multiple restaurants in the Los Angeles area and the founder of “You Give, We Cook, They Eat,” a program she started during the pandemic. The program will now provide food to shelters and families in need. “We’re just holding each other right now, and that’s community. So even though the Palisades is burning down, we’re here,” Hermer said. Anthony Correia Conditions tonight mean fire crews can battle the new fire in the Hollywood Hills, the Sunset Fire, by air. When the deadly Eaton Fire exploded near Paseneda last night, the extreme wind kept the air crews on the ground. Dennis Romero Alicia Victoria Lozano Los Angeles police are being enlisted in the fight against the Sunset Fire in the Hollywood Hills, Mayor Karen Bass said. Police will help fleeing evacuees, direct traffic, close roads near the flames and expand street access for firefighters, she said tonight on X. She said officers are a part of city efforts to "urgently" ease evacuations and fire response in a part of the city that includes steep hills and narrow, winding streets. "We are deploying LAPD officers to respond to Hollywood to help alleviate evacuation traffic," Bass said. Rebecca Cohen "This is the night when my house might burn down," Lawrence O’Donnell said on MSNBC tonight. "It is being threatened by fire now in a way that wasn't possible even yesterday or earlier today that we did not know about." "This situation really is happening in a way that we have never seen before," O'Donnell said. When he delivered his remarks on his show, O'Donnell said he had no idea what is happening to his house or whether it is still standing — an experience he shares with everyone who had to evacuate. But he also noted a luxury that many do not have: being able to monitor the situation in L.A. from the comfort of his second home in New York City, thousands of miles away. "If you have a home in Los Angeles, if you have an apartment, if you have anything in Los Angeles now, you do not know anymore whether you're going to see it again," O'Donnell said. Rudy Chinchilla Undergraduate classes will be canceled while graduate classes will be taught remotely tomorrow and Friday, UCLA announced. Classes for UCLA Extension, the university's continuing education division, will also be remote tomorrow and Friday, the school said. The Geffen Academy, UCLA Lab School and Early Care and Education PreK-12 programs will be closed on those days. There is no immediate fire danger to the campus, in Los Angeles' Westwood community, but the air quality in the area is likely to worsen in the hours ahead, the university said. "The first week of classes is typically a joyous occasion, and I am deeply sorry that the fires in our region have instead brought so much pain and caused so much devastation," Chancellor Julio Frenk said in a letter to the school community. Megan Lebowitz President Joe Biden has canceled his coming trip to Italy to deal with the wildfires, White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said in a statement. "After returning this evening from Los Angeles, where earlier today he had met with police, fire and emergency personnel fighting the historic fires raging in the area and approved a Major Disaster declaration for California, President Biden made the decision to cancel his upcoming trip to Italy to remain focused on directing the full federal response in the days ahead," she said. He had initially planned to meet with Pope Francis, Italian President Sergio Mattarella and Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni during the trip. Read the full story here. Rebecca Cohen The Sunset Fire, which sparked this evening in the Hollywood Hills, is under aerial assault by firefighters. Unlike last night, crews tonight are able to drop water on the blaze and the wind is less severe — advantages for firefighters. NBC Los Angeles reporters on the scene and in the air reported that it appeared as though crews were making progress in battling the blaze but warned that embers could easily spark new fires. The Sunset Fire, which has prompted evacuations, is at 20 acres. Tom Llamas Gregg Champion evacuated from the Palisades Fire with his wife and three daughters, but his house could not be saved. Awards, pictures, sports memorabilia, memories of going to the ranch and on ski trips — all went up in flames. “All the memories are gone," Champion said. Champion said he is on a text chain with about 11 other families of kids with whom his children play soccer and volleyball. All those families lost their homes, too, he said. "There's nothing left in the Palisades," Champion said. "Nothing." Rudy Chinchilla The Sunset Fire broke out shortly before 6 p.m. in the Hollywood Hills of Los Angeles near the popular Runyon Canyon. It quickly grew to 20 acres, prompting mandatory evacuations from Laurel Canyon Boulevard on the west to Mulholland Drive on the north to the 101 Freeway on the east down to Hollywood Boulevard on the south. Kalhan Rosenblatt Los Angeles residents are turning to a free nonprofit-run app to help them navigate the catastrophic fires ravaging the area. Watch Duty, which launched in 2021 and is now in 22 states, provides live updates to users about nearby wildfires and firefighting efforts. The app is powered by a team of volunteers and staff members — active and retired firefighters, dispatchers and veteran storm watchers, according to its website. Throughout yesterday and into today, many Angelenos circulated screenshots of the app across social media, encouraging others to download it and calling it a lifeline amid rapidly changing weather conditions. Read the full story here. Chloe Melas Rebecca Cohen Celebrities who live in Southern California are sharing the news that they have lost their homes in the fires. Billy and Janice Crystal said in a statement that the home they have lived in since 1979 was gone. "Words cannot describe the enormity of the devastation we are witnessing and experiencing," the Crystals said. "We ache for our friends and neighbors who have also lost their homes and businesses in this tragedy." "The Pacific Palisades is a resilient community of amazing people and we know in time it will rise again." The Crystals said they are praying for “the safety of the firefighters and first responders, and Paris Hilton, too, shared her appreciation for rescuers and her community amid the devastation. Hilton said on X that she was "heartbroken beyond words" after she watched her Malibu home burn down on live TV. She described the loss as "overwhelming" but added she is "holding onto gratitude that my family is safe." She said she is looking into how "we can best support the communities impacted by these fires" and hopes to make a "meaningful difference" as soon as possible. "We're in this together, LA," Hilton wrote. Phil Helsel A brush fire has broken out in the Hollywood Hills of Los Angeles near Runyon Canyon, the city’s fire chief said at a news conference this evening. The new fire had broken out within five minutes of Los Angeles Fire Chief Kristin Crowley's announcement around 5:50 p.m. “I don’t have a lot of information. I can tell you we’re throwing all of our available resources at it as we speak,” Crowley said before she excused herself from the news event. “I am seeing active water drops as we speak.” Phil Helsel Three smaller fires that broke out in Los Angeles and Ventura counties have been contained or had their forward progress stopped, fire officials said. The Woodley Fire in the San Fernando Valley area of Los Angeles has been controlled at around 30 acres, Los Angeles Fire Chief Kristin Crowley said at a news conference. The Lidia Fire, which broke out near the community of Acton in a region between the Sierra Pelona and San Gabriel mountains, was an estimated 80 to 100 acres but 30% contained, Los Angeles County Fire Chief Anthony Marrone said. “Thankfully, forward progress has been stopped,” he said. The fire in Ventura County, the Olivas Fire, burned 28 acres after it started today, but its forward progress was stopped and firefighters were mopping up this afternoon, the Ventura County Fire Department said. But there are still major wildfires burning in Los Angeles and Los Angeles County: the Palisades Fire in Pacific Palisades, the Hurst Fire in the Sylmar area of Los Angeles and the Eaton Fire in the Altadena and Pasadena area. Morgan Chesky Reporting from Altadena, California Kymm Snowden traveled back to Altadena after his mother fled the Eaton Fire, which erupted yesterday, to check on her home — but the fire was close by. “It’s mind-blowing. I don’t even have words for it. I’m just hoping they can put that out,” said Snowden, whose grandfather and other family members have lived in the foothills before he was born. The Eaton Fire has grown to more than 10,000 acres after it broke out at around 6:30 p.m. yesterday near Altadena, a city at the foot of the San Gabriel Mountains, officials have said. Five people have died, Los Angeles County Sheriff Robert Luna said. Hundreds of structures have been destroyed, Los Angeles County Fire Chief Anthony Marrone said. Snowden said that usually fires are in the mountains, not in the city. He was taken aback by the devastation. “Every street you go, houses on both sides are leveled,” he said. Several family members have lost homes in the fire, he said. Eric Leonard, NBC Los Angeles The Los Angeles fire chief warned in the weeks before the devastating Palisades Fire that the decision to cut the fire department’s budget by nearly $18 million would diminish its ability to prepare for and respond to large-scale emergencies. The budget reduction, which Mayor Karen Bass approved last year, was mostly absorbed by leaving many administrative jobs unfilled, but that left about $7 million that was cut from the overtime budget that was used for training, fire prevention and other key functions. “The reduction ... has severely limited the department’s capacity to prepare for, train for, and respond to large-scale emergencies, including wildfires,” Chief Kristin Crowley wrote in a memo on Dec. 4. The variable overtime hours, called “V-Hours” within the LAFD, were used to pay for Federal Aviation Administration-mandated pilot training and helicopter coordination staffing for wildfire suppression, the memo said. “Without this funding, pilot compliance and readiness are jeopardized, and aerial firefighting capabilities are diminished,” it said. “Changes to the Air Operations Section impact the Department’s ability to adhere to current automatic and mutual aid agreements, provide air ambulance service, and quickly respond to woodland fires with water dropping helicopters.” The memo also highlighted other programs that would suffer under the cuts, including the Disaster Response Section, which funds the bulldozer teams that cut breaks and control lines around wildfires, and the Critical Incident Planning and Training Section, which develops plans for major emergencies. Fanned by powerful winds, the Palisades Fire, which started yesterday, destroyed hundreds of buildings and burned about 15,800 acres. It is one of five wildfires burning in Southern California. Rebecca Cohen More than 100,000 people have been evacuated, Pasadena Mayor Victor Gordo told reporters this afternoon in discussing the Eaton Fire at a news conference, and 100,000 have been told they may need to evacuate because they live in a danger zone. Five people have died and hundreds of homes have been lost, Gordo said. The Eaton Fire is more 10,600 acres large and at 0% containment, Pasadena Fire Chief Chad Augustine said. He said 200 to 500 structures have been damaged or lost. Sixty strike teams have been requested — around 15 have arrived, and Augustine expects that to grow to 50 within 24 hours. There are 750 firefighters combating the blaze. Augustine said that wind gusts of 70-plus mph have driven the fire and that embers have been spotted 2 to 3 miles ahead of it, sparking small fires of their own. The area remains in red flag conditions, and Augustine expects it to be that way until tomorrow. But, he said, thanks to the current forecast, aircraft are now able to come in to fight the fire. Aircraft have been dropping water since about 10 a.m. PT in an attempt to limit the spread. "We expect, with favorable conditions over the next couple days, to start making good progress on this fire," Augustine said. Tonight's wind conditions will be "very mild," he said, which gives him "confidence that we're going to get a handle on this fire. He later added: "Do I expect a risk of fire spread tomorrow? Yes. Do I expect erratic fire weather like we saw last night? No." Augustine also noted the "rarity" it is to have two major brush fires in L.A. County in one day. Rudy Chinchilla Southern California’s deadly, raging wildfires are affecting the Hollywood awards season as flames and smoke put a halt to the usual glitz and glamour. The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences and the Writers Guild of America today announced that they will delay announcing their awards nominees. The academy, which hands out the Oscars, will announce nominees on Jan. 19 — two days later than originally scheduled — to give its members affected by the fires an extended window to vote for nominees, The Associated Press reported. The WGA West and the WGA East said in a statement that nominees will be announced Monday. Yesterday, the Screen Actors Guild announced that it had canceled its planned in-person awards nomination ceremony because of the extreme fire conditions. Instead, nominees were announced today on its website. Phil Helsel Pasadena has seen “a brutal 22 hours” since the Eaton Fire broke out yesterday but will rebuild, City Manager Miguel Márquez said. Winds were gusting around 80 mph after the Eaton Fire broke out in Eaton Canyon near Altadena around 6:30 p.m., he said, and first responders went door to door to get people to safety. “We will put out the fire. And then it will be time to rebuild,” Márquez said at a news conference this afternoon. The Eaton Fire has grown to more than 10,600 acres and destroyed more than 100 structures, officials said earlier today. At least five people have died. Curtis Bunn A man in Pacific Palisades captured on video how he and his elderly relative escaped nearby raging fires. Aaron Samson used his phone to record the drama. They were directed by law enforcement to leave their car on a street where traffic had stalled and a number of vehicles were abandoned. Samson's father-in-law appeared unstable for a moment when he emerged into the air, which was laden with smoke. Samson gathered his rolling walker, and they made their way up the street, where a “good Samaritan” gave them a ride to safety in Santa Monica. The video also captures a distraught women yelling into her cellphone, apparently devastated by the destruction. Antonio Planas Nearly 330,000 customers are still without power in in Southern California. The latest figures provided by the tracking website PowerOutage.us show there were 329,457 power outages at 4:15 p.m. local time (7:15 p.m. ET). That represents a significant drop. Only hours earlier in the afternoon, the website said about 1.5 million Southern California customers were without power. Steve Patterson Reporting from Altadena, Calif. Part of a home collapsed during a live report, an in-the-moment example of the wreckage that has engulfed this town. Gusting winds of up to 100 mph make it feel like a hurricane in a city. Instead of wind, it's fire you have to worry about. And because of that combination, the extent of the damage to the community, which was hit “hard and fast,” will be devastating. The stress firefighters are experiencing is substantial. They are trying to save more structures, which could lead to more embers, which could lead to more fires, which lead to more tears. Rudy Chinchilla Owners of horses and other large livestock can take their animals to the Pico Rivera Sports Arena for free emergency shelter, the city announced today. The city said owners can take their animals to the arena at any time and someone will be there to assist them. Pico Rivera is on the southern edge of the San Gabriel Valley, where the Eaton Fire is burning in the Pasadena and Altadena area, north of the city. The sports arena, on Pico Rivera’s northeast edge, is known for its concerts, rodeos and other Hispanic cultural events. “The Pico Rivera Sports Arena is uniquely equipped to provide safe, secure and accessible boarding for horses and other large animals,” Mayor John Garcia said in a statement. “It gives families peace of mind as they prioritize their safety and recovery.” Phil Helsel Three schools suffered “significant damage” in the Palisades Fire, a spokesperson for the Los Angeles school district said. Palisades Charter High School, Palisades Charter Elementary School and Marquez Elementary School were all damaged, the spokesperson for Los Angeles Unified School District said. NBC Los Angeles recorded the scene as flames roared from multiple structures at Palisades Charter High School last night. “We are currently working with local authorities and emergency response teams to assess the situation and determine next steps. Plans are being developed to minimize disruption to instruction,” the school district spokesperson said in an email. Morgan Chesky Stephanie Fuerte Reporting from Altadena, California Firefighters battling the Eaton Fire, which is burning homes in the Altadena area, say they are having issues with hydrants or low water pressure at hydrants. “Right now, we’re finding most of them are down or low-pressure, and we’re having to commit resources to provide water,” Los Angeles County Fire Capt. Josh DeJournett said as they worked to combat a fire at a home today. “If we had a hydrant for this building, we might have been able to save the back half,” he said. There have been issues with water pressure in fighting the Palisades Fire, burning on the other side of Los Angeles County by the Pacific Ocean, the Los Angeles Fire Department said. Fire spokesperson Erik Scott said fire crews on that fire did have problems with water. “Water availability was impacted at higher elevations, which affected some fire hydrants due to limited replenishment of water tanks in those areas,” Scott wrote on X today. “The extreme demand caused a slower refill rate for these tanks which created a challenge for our firefighting effort.” Rebecca Cohen Airbnb is working with 211 L.A. to offer free temporary housing for people affected by the wildfires and forced to evacuate their homes. The company said all stays will be fully funded by Airbnb and the guests who are offering their homes. To be eligible, you must have been displaced from your home, you must live in an evacuation zone, you must have an active Airbnb account, and you must be 18 years old. More information on the program can be found here. Melissa Chan Jennifer Schweitzer had to pull her husband away from staring at the burning Altadena home he had loved and lived in for decades. But even then, the two couldn’t bear to go too far away. “We didn’t even leave,” she told NBC Los Angeles reporter Lolita Lopez. The couple moved to the parking lot of a nearby supermarket, hoping for the best. “It’s gonna pass. We’re gonna still have our home,” she said she recalled thinking. But fierce winds pushed them farther away from the home her husband, 49, grew up in and inherited once his father died. As flames further engulfed the home that the couple raised their own children in, Schweitzer and her husband relocated to another parking lot that was still close by. “We still could not leave,” Schweitzer said. “You know that’s — that’s our home.” Schweitzer said that they tried to hose their house down before they left but that their efforts did not stand a chance against the sheer destruction of the Eaton fire. “It’s gone,” she said in tears. "It's all we've got." Within minutes, Schweitzer said, the fire also destroyed their children's school, their neighborhood park and as their local post office, smoke shop and hamburger stand. Now, at the Pasadena Convention Center, a stunned Schweitzer is waiting for more resources and guidance from officials about what to do next. “I’m hoping I just wake up and it’s a dream,” she said. Antonio Planas Lilia Wood The NFL is monitoring wildfires in Southern California as the wildcard playoff game between the Minnesota Vikings and the Los Angeles Rams is scheduled for Monday night. The playoff game is slated for 8 p.m. at the Rams’ home field, SoFi Stadium in Inglewood, California. “The NFL continues to closely monitor developments in the area and will remain in contact with both clubs and the NFLPA,” the league said in a statement. However, the NFL added, if the game has to be relocated, it will be moved to State Farm Stadium in Glendale, Arizona. The stadium is home to the Arizona Cardinals. The NFL also said the league’s “priority is the safety of the Los Angeles community. We are grateful for the tireless efforts of the first responders. Our hearts are with Los Angeles and everyone affected by the fires.” The Rams posted today on X about the wildfires. “Our hearts are with those affected by the Eaton Fire in Altadena/Pasadena and the first responders in our community. Be safe,” the team said. The Vikings responded to the Rams’ post with one of their own, saying, “We’re thinking of our Rams friends, their community and the first responders during this time.” Daniel Arkin Mendy Piekarski, a rabbi at a Chabad Lubavitch synagogue and cultural center in Topanga Canyon, rushed to evacuate people from the facility today. He and his colleagues called the parents of 25 preschool students there, and within an hour, all the kids had been picked up and driven out of the evacuation zone. Piekarski, 27, said he and his wife loaded the Chabad’s sacred Torah scrolls into their car before they left the building, wrapping the bundles of parchment in tallit, a fringed garment worn as a prayer shawl. “We cherish them very much, and they’re very valuable, so we made sure to bring them to a safe location outside Topanga,” he said. “We would have loved to take other holy objects, like prayer books, though we didn’t have enough time. It was about taking the most important things: our family and the Torah scrolls. “Of course, it would have been nice to also take some photo albums and pictures,” he added. “But safety is the main thing.” Antonio Planas FEMA Administrator Deanne Criswell called the roaring wildfires in the Los Angeles area a “very dynamic and dangerous situation” and said she would be in Southern California on Friday to assess the damage. She told Nicolle Wallace on “Deadline: White House” that authorities are trying to determine what the “maximum impact” could be to get victims of the wildfires the resources they need. Criswell compared the wildfires in Southern California to the 2023 wildfires in Maui that killed more than 100 and destroyed the former capital of the kingdom of Hawaii. Criswell said resources provided to California may end up topping resources provided to Hawaiians affected by the wildfires. She reflected on a recent trip to Maui to check the recovery status and said temporary schools and housing have been set up. "Those are the types of things that we’re going to have to do here, maybe even on a grander scale than what we saw in Maui. But we just don’t know yet," she said. Criswell also urged affected residents to lean on the government and their neighbors, assuring them these dark days will pass. "They can rely on their federal government to come in and support them. They can rely on their neighbors, their friends to help them. There are resources that are out there, whether it’s the federal government and our nonprofit or churches," she said. "We are going to bring all of these together to help you through this." Andrew Blankstein The number of people killed in the Eaton Fire has risen to five, Los Angeles County Sheriff Robert Luna said. Additional details about the deaths were not immediately available. Earlier today, officials said the blaze had killed two people. The Eaton Fire has burned about 10,600 acres since it started yesterday and is 0% contained, according to Cal Fire. Phil Helsel Two additional brush fires broke out today, one in a community between two mountain ranges in Los Angeles County and one in Ventura County west of Los Angeles, officials said. The fire in Ventura County, the Olivas Fire, was around 28 acres and the Ventura County Fire Department said that firefighters have stopped its forward progress. “Crews will be remaining on scene for the next few hours mopping up hotspots within the fire footprint,” the Ventura County Fire Department said on X. The Lidia Fire broke out in Los Angeles County in a region between the Sierra Pelona Mountains and San Gabriel Mountains. It has burned around 50 acres and has begun burning into the Angeles National Forest, the U.S. Forest Service said. That fire was reported off of Soledad Canyon Road in Acton, a community of around 7,000, the Angeles National Forest said. The Woodley Fire, which broke out today in the San Fernando Valley, was previously reported. That fire has burned around 30 acres, the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection said. The three fires are all zero percent contained, according to Cal Fire. Jesse Rodriguez Antonio Planas The raging wildfires in the Los Angeles area prompted the postponement of the 30th annual Critics Choice Awards in Santa Monica, organizers said today. The award ceremony that was scheduled for Sunday will now be held on Jan. 26, organizers said in a statement. The location of the event will remain at the Barker Hangar in Santa Monica and will broadcast live on E!. It will also be available on Peacock the next day, organizers said. “This unfolding tragedy has already had a profound impact on our community,” event CEO Joey Berlin said in the statement. “All our thoughts and prayers are with those battling the devastating fires and with all who have been affected.” Rebecca Cohen The Music Center in Los Angeles said in a statement it has closed its buildings to the public "out of an abundance of caution" amid the wildfire threat in the area. The Dorothy Chandler Pavilion, Mark Taper Forum, Ahmanson Theatre and Walt Disney Concert Hall have been closed, the center said. There were no performances or events on the campus today. The center said it hopes to resume normal operations tomorrow. NBC News KNBC helicopter reporter Julia Deng describes frightening turbulence and extreme winds as she provides an aerial view of California's raging Palisades Fire. Melissa Chan The city of Los Angeles needs more than 60 new fire stations to meet its average daily need and is not equipped to deal with a catastrophic wildfire emergency of this level, a local official said today. In a live interview with KNBC, Councilwoman Traci Park criticized the city’s lack of resources and manpower to fight even everyday fires, saying she was frustrated with the “chronic underinvestment in our critical infrastructure and our public safety partners.” “The demands that we are putting on our public safety resources is absolutely untenable, and we can’t continue this way,” Park told KNBC reporter Hetty Chang. A report recently found that the city needs at least 62 new fire stations, Park said, adding that there are 100 out-of-service fire engines and ambulances at the mechanics yard because “we don’t have mechanics to repair them.” “We are not staffed to deal with this level of emergency or this number of emergencies spread around a geographic footprint like we have here in the city, in the county of Los Angeles,” Park said. “And as we look forward to the World Cup in 2026 and the Olympics in 2028, this is a painful and tragic reminder of how much work we have ahead.” Antonio Planas Firefighters battling the Palisades Fire are not only fighting the roaring inferno, but also facing challenges with water pressure, an official said today. Erik Scott, a spokesperson for the Los Angeles Fire Department, posted on X about problems firefighters are facing getting water to the flames. Scott said in the post that the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power proactively filled all available water storage tanks, including three 1 million-gallon tanks in the Palisades area. "However, water availability was impacted at higher elevations, which affected some fire hydrants due to limited replenishment of water tanks in those areas," he said. "The extreme demand caused a slower refill rate for these tanks which created a challenge for our firefighting effort." Elizabeth Maline Wildfires across Los Angeles may affect clinic and outpatient appointments at Keck Medicine of USC, it said in a post on X. The Southern California medical system consists of hospitals, clinics and primary care providers. "We continue to monitor the situation to ensure the safety of our patients and staff," Keck Medicine said on X. All Keck Medicine of USC hospitals are open, and all patients with affected appointments will be contacted with additional information, the hospital system said. Jo Yurcaba Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass called the impact of the fires and winds in the city “devastating” in a statement today on X, adding that she spoke with President Biden “and discussed an urgent path forward towards recovery for the thousands of families impacted.” She thanked Gov. Gavin Newsom and Sen. Alex Padilla, D-Calif., “for your continued support for our city.” Akshay Syal Antonio Planas UCLA Health hospitals treated over 20 patients for fire-related injuries, officials said today. As of 11 a.m. local time, 21 patients were treated and released, and one patient remained hospitalized in critical condition, according to UCLA. Gadi Schwartz Curtis Bunn Reporting from Pacific Palisades, Calif. NBC News correspondent Gadi Schwartz drove through Pacific Palisades and provided an up-close view of the wildfire carnage that roars through the town. Through thick segments of ash, Schwartz points out homes and an apartment building that were engulfed in flames. Landmarks were destroyed, like the once-majestic Pacific Palisades Presbyterian Church and Gelson’s grocery store. The next mile showed utter devastation, including a prominent home that sat on a hill overlooking Sunset Boulevard. Most people had evacuated, although there were a few people riding bicycles. Liz Kreutz California Gov. Gavin Newsom told NBC News the closest thing he's seen to the fires blazing in his state was the deadly fire in Paradise, but at this stage, just 24 hours in, he said he's never seen anything like this, in size and scope. "It's stunning. Nothing comes close," he said. Newsom said they'll need to start focusing on clean-up efforts soon, but said right now "it's about keeping people safe, making sure people are heeding the evacuation orders." He said the Palisades Fire is 0% contained and noted the "great challenge" intense winds are bringing to fighting the fires. Newsom said they were as prepared as they could be. On Sunday night, he directed 110 fire engines to the area of the Palisades Fire, in addition to water tenders and helicopters among other firefighting resources. Despite that, the governor thinks this could be one of the costliest fires in history, something he said he was discussing with President Joe Biden today, pointing to the complexities of the multiple fires, the wind and humidity forecast, and that they have pulled resources from not only around California but from other states as well. "I think that says everything there is to know about the magnitude of it," Newsom said. Antonio Planas More than 1.5 million customers are without power in Southern California as wildfires burn throughout the Los Angeles area, according to PowerOutage.us. The outage numbers leapt from the 400,000 without power about two hours prior. In Los Angeles County alone, about 957,000 customers were without electricity, according to the site. Saba Hamedy Reporting from Los Angeles A handful of L.A. restaurants are preparing food for first responders in an effort to help the community amid the devastating fires. Yeastie Boys Bagels, a popular food truck known for its New York-style bagels, posted that it is going to evacuation centers in Pasadena, Pacoima, Westwood and downtown Los Angeles to provide meals. The business posted a series of images of people receiving the food. Jon & Vinnys, another L.A. staple, wrote a note on Instagram saying it is "working on ways to support you, our amazing first responders and the broader community." "At this time, all our restaurant locations are open for those seeking refuge and regular dine-ins," the Italian restaurant wrote in its post. "Wait times may be a bit longer (only a bit!) as some of our teams are preparing food for first responders." Le Great Outdoor, a restaurant in Santa Monica, wrote on its Instagram story that today it is "focusing on helping fire fighters and first responders." The business asked people to purchase a firefighter meal on the restaurant website, noting that for every meal purchased, the restaurant will provide an additional meal. NBC News The Palisades Fire put a serious “strain” on the city’s water system after three million gallons were used in just 15 hours, according to officials.

Phil Helsel The Los Angeles Kings home game against the Calgary Flames scheduled for tonight has been postponed, the NHL team said, as fires in the region continue to burn amid high winds. “Our hearts are with the entire Los Angeles community,” the team said in a statement. “We appreciate the hard working First Responders who are diligently working to contain the fire and protect our community.” A new date was not announced. Tickets for tonight’s game will be valid for the rescheduled game, the team said. Kyla Guilfoil President Joe Biden approved a major disaster declaration for California that will clear the way for federal funds and resources to be accessed in recovery efforts, according to the White House. The declaration will allow "survivors to immediately access funds and resources to jumpstart their recovery," a White House statement said. Biden is "focused on mobilizing life-saving and life-sustaining resources across the region," the statement added, as the president is "praying for those who lost loved ones, had property damaged, were injured, and for everyone affected by this and other devastating fires in the area." Alongside the president's declaration, FEMA has approved a Fire Management Assistance Grant to reimburse California for its firefighting costs overnight. The administration also said that five large air tankers, 10 federal firefighting helicopters and dozens of fire engines from the U.S. Forest Service are being deployed to the efforts in the state. Four Modular Air Firefighting System (MAFFS) are on their way from the Department of Defense, along with 10 Navy helicopters with water delivery buckets to assist with aerial suppression, the statement added. The resources will add to the two Modular Air Firefighting System units coming from the California National Guard, which expects another two to be on the way from Nevada's National Guard.

Annemarie Bonner During a briefing today with President Joe Biden and Gov. Gavin Newsom, Los Angeles County Fire Chief Tony Marrone announced that states including Arizona, Nevada and Washington are deploying their resources to assist. "We requested 250 additional engines into L.A. County with 1,000 personnel. We also are using our compacts with other states like Arizona, Nevada, Oregon and Washington. Firefighters from those regions are on their way down to Los Angeles County right now to assist us," he said. The Oregon Fire Marshall also posted that they have mobilized 12 strike teams from the Oregon fire service to the wildfires. Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis also shared that he has offered to send resources from his state, which he shared on X. "When disaster strikes, we must come together to help our fellow Americans in any way we can. The state of Florida has offered help to assist the people of California in responding to these fires and in rebuilding communities that have been devastated," he wrote. New York Gov. Kathy Hochul also shared that her state is ready to deploy resources if they are needed, saying she has been in touch with the state of California. She also called the wildfires "horrific" and said they are "praying for all who are impacted." Kyla Guilfoil At a briefing at a Santa Monica firehouse this afternoon, President Joe Biden called the ongoing wildfires in Southern California "astounding." "We're prepared to [do] anything and everything as long as it takes to contain these fires and help reconstruct, make sure that we get back to normal," the president said at the briefing. Biden said that he plans to sign a declaration today to "provide for everything the federal government can do," adding that he's directed the Department of Defense to "rapidly provide additional firefighting personnel and capabilities." "It's going to be a hell of a long way. It's going to take time, federal government is here to stay, as long as it needs," he added. Gov. Gavin Newsom, who attended the briefing, told the president he had "next level appreciation" for the federal support. Marlene Lenthang Actor and Pacific Palisades resident Steve Guttenberg is on the ground trying to offer a helping hand, attempting to move abandoned cars and help lost pets. “I’m OK … yesterday morning everything was fine. About 10 o’clock, this crazy fire was occurring,” he recalled, saying the winds were “the hardest I've ever seen in my life.” “People are really panicking and really scared right now. Most people have evacuated their homes. But the fire is really raging. These winds are terrible, the winds are so hot,” he told MSNBC’s Chris Jansing. “It was like a volcano.” He recalled trying to save a dog in the street last night and seeing grocery stores and the local high school on fire. He urged people to help each other through the devastation. “I want to use this moment to tell people in a crisis, anytime there’s a crisis and you abandon your car, leave the keys in the car so guys like me can move the car to the curb so that fire fighters can get through with fire trucks,” he said. “We should use kindness and this compassion not only during a crisis but we should remember to use it all the time,” he added. Elizabeth Maline There are over 400,000 customers without power across the state of California as of 11:15 a.m. local time (2:15 p.m. ET), according to poweroutage.us, which tracks power outages across the United States.

Marlene Lenthang President Joe Biden appeared at a Santa Monica fire station this afternoon to receive an in-person briefing on the wildfires raging across the Los Angeles area. He was joined by Gov. Gavin Newsom. Melissa Chan In a live broadcast, NBC Los Angeles photographer Alex Vasquez said he saw about 30 people who decided not to evacuate or had left the area but then came back in an attempt to save their homes. One of them was a woman who said she returned after seeing her neighbor’s home in flames while watching TV. “I’m determined to save my home,” she told NBC Los Angeles. Another neighbor told the news station he was “exhausted” after helping his neighbors douse their homes with water. “Just trying to do what I can,” he said. Vasquez said firefighters do not want homeowners to do this. He said the area is barricaded and that law enforcement has been telling people to turn around when they arrive. At the Pasadena Convention Center, people who evacuated the Eaton Fire were offered bottles of water and Gatorade, according to a woman who fled there with her husband, mother, sister and dog. The woman told NBC Los Angeles reporter Lolita Lopez that she woke up at 4 a.m. and saw texts on her phone from her loved ones asking if she was OK. She said she read about the fire and immediately jumped out of bed, ran to her closet and started packing. She and her husband picked up her mother and sister who live nearby and headed for the convention center. “The wind was blowing really hard at that point. There was just smoke everywhere,” she said. While trucks outside the convention center today were offering food, the woman, who was sitting on the floor with her family, said she had no appetite because it’s been “intense.” “I’m just waiting to see what happens,” she said. Annemarie Bonner Maria Shriver, former first lady of California and ex-wife of Arnold Schwarzenegger, posted a lengthy social media statement sharing that everything in her local community is now gone from the fires. “Heartbreaking, devastating, beyond belief. Everything is gone. Our neighborhood, our restaurants. All our friends have lost everything. We have evacuated, but are safe. But people have lost everything, “ she wrote. She also encouraged her followers and community members to “stay safe, stay out of harms way, and allow firefighters do what they can to help those who need immediate assistance.” Other celebrities have also chimed on, including actress Mandy Moore, who shared that she’s unsure whether or not her home is still standing. “Grateful for the kindness of friends that we had a place to land last night. Trying to shield the kids from the immense sadness and worry I feel,” she wrote in an Instagram story earlier today. "The Hills" actress Heidi Montag posted a Tik Tok video where she shared that she lost her house in the fire.

Marlene Lenthang The Eaton Fire, which sparked around 6:30 p.m. yesterday in the Pasadena and Altadena area, has grown to 10,600 acres as of 10 a.m. local time (1 p.m. ET). Earlier this morning it was at 2,227 acres. Meanwhile, the Hurst Fire in Sylmar stands at 505 acres with 0% containment. Steve Kopack The Los Angeles wildfires could result in $10 billion of insured losses, according to a preliminary review by J.P. Morgan’s insurance analysts. The report’s authors caution that the figure could change, but note that “the 2018 Camp fire in Butte County, CA caused economic losses of about $15 billion and insured losses of roughly $10 billion (inflation-adjusted).” They write that the Butte Fire impacted over 150,000 acres and more than 18,000 structures, compared to current industry estimates of 3,000 impacted acres and 13,000 structures for the current Palisades Fire. However, the Pacific Palisades area is a very affluent region of Los Angeles County and, according to the J.P. Morgan analysts, has a median home price of more than $3 million, compared to Butte County’s $500,000. Matt Lavietes If you’ve been told to evacuate, officials advise you do so immediately — don’t wait. If not, a small amount of preparation can make a huge difference in the event that things change. And, again, don’t wait to be ordered to evacuate if you feel you’re at risk. The California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection, also known as Cal Fire, says residents should plan on a place to meet other members of their household, know who to call and how to safely flee in the event that you’re forced to evacuate.
