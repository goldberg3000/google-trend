                <h2 class="article-title">National day of mourning - Wikipedia</h2>
                <p class="article-content">A national day of mourning is an official day designated by a country's government to commemorate and mourn significant losses, such as the death of prominent individuals, wartime events, or major disasters. These days often involve collective mourning activities and rituals intended to foster a sense of national unity and shared grief among the populace. A common symbol of such days is the flying of the national or military flag at half-mast.

The concept of national mourning is sociologically understood as a means for state authorities to create a communal space for grief, reinforcing a collective identity in the face of loss. Various countries observe these days in response to significant events, and they can be triggered by both domestic and international occurrences.

In addition to national observances, similar concepts exist at regional levels, such as the European Union and the Arab League. The European Commission first recognized a day of mourning on September 12, 2001, following the terrorist attacks in the United States, and has since observed additional days for other tragedies. The Arab League has also declared days of mourning in response to significant events.

Other international organizations, like the African Union and the Union of South American Nations, have similarly declared days of mourning. While not identical to national days of mourning, some events and protests may also be referred to as a "day of mourning," reflecting a broader cultural practice of remembrance and reflection on loss.</p>

                <h2 class="article-title">What is a national day of mourning? Why the US is honoring former President Jimmy Carter</h2>
                <p class="article-content">The late former President Jimmy Carter will be honored with a national day of mourning on Thursday, January 9, coinciding with his state funeral in Washington, D.C. Carter, who passed away on December 29 at the age of 100, was a significant figure in American history, serving as the 39th president from 1977 to 1981 and later becoming a renowned humanitarian.

### Key Details About the National Day of Mourning:

- **Purpose**: A national day of mourning is designated to honor and pay respects to a revered public figure, typically a former U.S. president. In Carter's case, it will coincide with his funeral at Washington National Cathedral.
  
- **Historical Context**: The tradition of a national day of mourning began in 1865 after the assassination of President Abraham Lincoln. Notable figures such as Martin Luther King Jr. and Robert F. Kennedy were also honored with this recognition after their assassinations in 1968.

- **Recent Examples**: The last president to receive a national day of mourning was George H.W. Bush, who passed away in December 2018.

### Federal Observances:

- **Closure of Federal Agencies**: President Biden has ordered all federal agencies to close on January 9, except for those necessary for national security or public needs. This means that federal employees will have a paid day off.

- **Impact on Services**:
  - **U.S. Postal Service**: Post offices will be closed, and regular mail delivery will be suspended, though some package deliveries may still occur.
  - **National Parks**: While most administrative offices will be closed, sites within the Jimmy Carter National Historical Park in Plains, Georgia, will have extended hours.
  - **Stock Markets**: The New York Stock Exchange and Nasdaq will be closed for the day.
  - **Supreme Court and Federal Courts**: These will also be shut down for the day.
  - **Public Schools**: Most will remain open, but military-affiliated schools under the Department of Defense Education Activity will be closed.

### Additional Honors:
President Biden will deliver a eulogy at Carter's funeral, and flags will be flown at half-staff for 30 days in honor of Carter, as per a proclamation from President Eisenhower in 1954.

For those interested in attending or paying respects, it is advisable to check specific venues or park websites for updated information regarding hours and services.</p>
