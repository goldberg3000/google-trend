                <h2 class="article-title">Barack Obama - Wikipedia</h2>
                <p class="article-content">Barack Hussein Obama II, born on August 4, 1961, is an influential American politician and lawyer who served as the 44th president of the United States from 2009 to 2017. As a member of the Democratic Party, he made history as the first African-American president in U.S. history. Prior to his presidency, Obama was a U.S. senator from Illinois from 2005 to 2008 and served in the Illinois State Senate from 1997 to 2004.

Born in Honolulu, Hawaii, Obama graduated from Columbia University in 1983 with a Bachelor of Arts in political science and later worked as a community organizer in Chicago. He attended Harvard Law School, where he became the first black president of the Harvard Law Review. After graduating, he worked as a civil rights attorney and taught constitutional law at the University of Chicago Law School.

Obama's political career began in earnest when he was elected to the Illinois State Senate in 1996. He gained national prominence during his successful campaign for the U.S. Senate in 2004, culminating in a keynote address at the Democratic National Convention that year. In 2008, he won the Democratic nomination for president after a close primary battle against Hillary Clinton. He selected Joe Biden as his running mate and won the election against Republican John McCain.

During his presidency, Obama faced significant challenges, including the 2007-2008 financial crisis. His administration implemented the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act, aimed at stimulating the economy, and passed major legislation such as the Affordable Care Act (ACA), which expanded healthcare coverage. He also appointed two women to the Supreme Court: Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan.

In foreign policy, Obama oversaw the end of the Iraq War, authorized the operation that killed Osama bin Laden, and attempted to reset U.S. relations with Russia and Cuba. His administration also faced criticism for its handling of the Syrian civil war and drone strikes in various countries.

Obama was re-elected in 2012, defeating Republican Mitt Romney. His second term was marked by continued advocacy for gun control, climate change initiatives, and immigration reform. He left office in January 2017 with high approval ratings.

Post-presidency, Obama has remained politically active, supporting Democratic candidates and engaging in various philanthropic efforts, including the establishment of the Obama Foundation. He has authored several books, including his memoir, "A Promised Land," and has received numerous accolades, including the Nobel Peace Prize in 2009. His legacy is often viewed as a blend of significant policy achievements and ongoing challenges, particularly regarding race relations and political polarization in the United States.</p>
