                "content": "Ohio (/oʊˈhaɪ.oʊ/ ⓘ oh-HY-oh)[14] is a state in the Midwestern region of the United States. It borders Lake Erie to the north, Pennsylvania to the east, West Virginia to the southeast, Kentucky to the southwest, Indiana to the west, and Michigan to the northwest. Of the 50 U.S. states, it is the 34th-largest by area. With a population of nearly 11.9 million, Ohio is the seventh-most populous and tenth-most densely populated state. Its capital and most populous city is Columbus, with the two other major metropolitan centers being Cleveland and Cincinnati, alongside Dayton, Akron, and Toledo. Ohio is nicknamed the \"Buckeye State\" after its Ohio buckeye trees, and Ohioans are also known as \"Buckeyes\".[11] Ohio derives its name from the Ohio River that forms its southern border, which, in turn, originated from the Seneca word ohiːyo', meaning \"good river\", \"great river\", or \"large creek\".[15][16] The state was home to several ancient indigenous civilizations, with humans present as early as 10,000 BCE. It arose from the lands west of the Appalachian Mountains that were contested by various native tribes and European colonists from the 17th century through the Northwest Indian Wars of the late 18th century. Ohio was partitioned from the Northwest Territory, the first frontier of the new United States, becoming the 17th state admitted to the Union on March 1, 1803, and the first under the Northwest Ordinance.[3][17] It was the first post-colonial free state admitted to the union and became one of the earliest and most influential industrial powerhouses during the 20th century. Although it has transitioned to a more information- and service-based economy in the 21st century, it remains an industrial state, ranking seventh in GDP as of 2019[update],[18] with the third-largest manufacturing sector and second-largest automobile production.[19] Modeled on its federal counterpart, Ohio's government is composed of the executive branch, led by the governor; the legislative branch, consisting of the bicameral Ohio General Assembly; and the judicial branch, led by the state Supreme Court. Ohio occupies 15 seats in the United States House of Representatives, the seventh-largest delegation.[20] Seven presidents of the United States have come from Ohio, earning it the moniker \"the Mother of Presidents\".[21] Archeological evidence of spear points of both the Folsom and Clovis types indicate that the Ohio Valley was inhabited by nomadic people as early as 13,000 BC.[22] These early nomads disappeared from Ohio by 1,000 BC.[22] Between 1,000 and 800 BC, the sedentary Adena culture emerged. The Adena established \"semi-permanent\" villages because they domesticated plants, including sunflowers, and \"grew squash and possibly corn\"; with hunting and gathering, this cultivation supported more settled, complex villages.[23] The most notable remnant of the Adena culture is the Great Serpent Mound, located in Adams County, Ohio.[23] Around 100 BC, the Adena evolved into the Hopewell people, who were also mound builders. Their complex, large and technologically sophisticated earthworks can be found in modern-day Marietta, Newark, and Circleville.[24] They were also a prolific trading society, their trading network spanning a third of the continent.[25] The Hopewell disappeared from the Ohio Valley about 600 AD. The Mississippian culture rose as the Hopewell culture declined. Many Siouan-speaking peoples from the plains and east coast claim them as ancestors and say they lived throughout the Ohio region until approximately the 13th century.[26] There were three other cultures contemporaneous with the Mississippians: the Fort Ancient people, the Whittlesey Culture[26] and the Monongahela Culture.[27] All three disappeared in the 17th century. Their origins are unknown. The Shawnees may have absorbed the Fort Ancient people.[26] It is also possible that the Monongahela held no land in Ohio during the Colonial Era. The Mississippian culture was close to and traded extensively with the Fort Ancient people. Indians in the Ohio Valley were greatly affected by the aggressive tactics of the Iroquois Confederation, based in central and western New York.[28] After the Beaver Wars in the mid-17th century, the Iroquois claimed much of the Ohio country as hunting and, more importantly, beaver-trapping ground. After the devastation of epidemics and war in the mid-17th century, which largely emptied the Ohio country of Indigenous people[dubious – discuss] by the mid-to-late 17th century, the land gradually became repopulated by the mostly Algonquian. Many of these Ohio-country nations were multiethnic (sometimes multi-linguistic) societies born out of the earlier devastation brought about by disease,[clarification needed] war, and subsequent social instability. They subsisted on agriculture (corn, sunflowers, beans, etc.) supplemented by seasonal hunts. By the 18th century, they were part of a larger global economy brought about by European entry into the fur trade.[29] Some of the Indigenous nations that historically inhabited Ohio include the Iroquoian,[c] the Algonquian,[d] and the Siouan.[e][30][31] Ohio country was also the site of Indian massacres, such as the Yellow Creek massacre and the Gnadenhutten massacre.[32] After the War of 1812, when Natives suffered serious losses such as at Tippecanoe, most Native tribes either left Ohio or had to live on only limited reservations. By 1842, all remaining Natives were forced out of the state.[33] During the 18th century, the French set up a system of trading posts to control the fur trade in the region. Beginning in 1754, the Kingdom of France and Kingdom of Great Britain fought in the French and Indian War, with various Native American tribes on each side. As a result of the Treaty of Paris, the French ceded control of Ohio and the remainder of the Old Northwest to Great Britain in 1763.[34] Before the American Revolution, Britain thinly exercised sovereignty over Ohio Country by lackadaisical garrisoning of the French forts.[f] Just beyond Ohio Country was the great Miami capital of Kekionga, which became the center of British trade and influence in Ohio Country and throughout the future Northwest Territory. By the Royal Proclamation of 1763, British lands west of Appalachia were forbidden to settlement by colonists.[35] The Treaty of Fort Stanwix in 1768 explicitly reserved lands north and west of the Ohio as Native lands.[36] British military occupation in the region contributed to the outbreak of Pontiac's War in 1763.[37] Ohio tribes participated in the war until an armed expedition in Ohio led by Brigadier General Henry Bouquet brought about a truce. Another colonial military expedition into the Ohio Country in 1774 brought Lord Dunmore's War, kicked off by the Yellow Creek massacre in Ohio, to a conclusion. In 1774, Britain passed the Quebec Act, which formally annexed Ohio and other western lands to the Province of Quebec in order to provide a civil government and to centralize British administration of the Montreal-based fur trade.[38] The prohibition of settlement west of the Appalachians remained, contributing to the American Revolution.[39] By the start of the American Revolutionary War, the movement of Natives and Americans between the Ohio Country and Thirteen Colonies had resulted in tension. Fort Pitt in Pennsylvania had become the main fort where expeditions into Ohio started. Intrusions into the area included General Edward Hand's 1778 movement of 500 Pennsylvania militiamen from Fort Pitt towards Mingo towns on the Cuyahoga River, where the British stored military supplies which they distributed to Indian raiding parties;[40] Colonel Daniel Brodhead's invasion in 1780 and destruction of the Lenape Indian capital of Coshocton;[41] a detachment of one hundred of George Rogers Clark's troops that were ambushed near the Ohio River by Indians led by Joseph Brant in the same year; a British and Native American attack on the U.S.' Fort Laurens;[42] and the 1782 detainment and murder of 96 Moravian Lenape pacifists by Pennsylvania militiamen in the Gnadenhutten massacre.[43][44] The western theatre never had a decisive victor. In the Treaty of Paris in 1783, Britain ceded all claims to Ohio Country to the new United States after its victory in the American Revolutionary War.[45][46] The United States created the Northwest Territory under the Northwest Ordinance of 1787.[47] Slavery was not permitted in the new territory. Settlement began with the founding of Marietta by the Ohio Company of Associates, which had been formed by a group of American Revolutionary War veterans. Following the Ohio Company, the Miami Company (also referred to as the \"Symmes Purchase\") claimed the southwestern section, and the Connecticut Land Company surveyed and settled the Connecticut Western Reserve in present-day Northeast Ohio. Territorial surveyors from Fort Steuben began surveying an area of eastern Ohio called the Seven Ranges at about the same time. The old Northwest Territory originally included areas previously known as Ohio Country and Illinois Country. As Ohio prepared for statehood, the Indiana Territory was created, reducing the Northwest Territory to approximately the size of present-day Ohio plus the eastern half of the Lower Peninsula of Michigan and the eastern tip of the Upper Peninsula and a sliver of southeastern Indiana called \"The Gore\". The coalition of Native American tribes, known as the Western Confederacy, was forced to cede extensive territory, including much of present-day Ohio, in the Treaty of Greenville in 1795. Under the Northwest Ordinance, areas could be defined and admitted as states once their population reached 60,000. Although Ohio's population was only 45,000 in December 1801, Congress determined that it was growing rapidly enough and accelerated the process via the Enabling Act of 1802. In regard to the Leni Lenape natives, Congress decided that 10,000 acres on the Muskingum River in the present state of Ohio would \"be set apart and the property thereof be vested in the Moravian Brethren ... or a society of the said Brethren for civilizing the Indians and promoting Christianity\".[48] Rufus Putnam served in important military capacities in both the French and Indian War and the American Revolutionary War. He was one of the most highly respected men in the early years of the United States.[49] In 1776, Putnam created a method of building portable fortifications, which enabled the Continental Army to drive the British from Boston. George Washington was so impressed that he made Putnam his chief engineer. After the war, Putnam and Manasseh Cutler were instrumental in creating the Northwest Ordinance, which opened up the Northwest Territory for settlement. This land was used to serve as compensation for what was owed to Revolutionary War veterans. Putnam organized and led the Ohio Company of Associates, who settled at Marietta, Ohio, where they built a large fort, Campus Martius.[50][51][52] He set substantial amounts of land aside for schools. In 1798, he created the plan for the construction of the Muskingum Academy (now Marietta College). In 1780, the directors of the Ohio Company appointed him superintendent of all its affairs relating to the settlement north of the Ohio River. In 1796, President George Washington commissioned him as Surveyor-General of United States Lands. In 1788, he served as a judge in the Northwest Territory's first court. In 1802, he served in the convention to form a constitution for the State of Ohio.[53][54][55] On February 19, 1803, U.S. president Thomas Jefferson signed an act of Congress that approved Ohio's boundaries and constitution.[56] But Congress had not passed a formal resolution admitting Ohio as the 17th state. Although no formal resolution of admission was required, when the oversight was discovered in 1953, as Ohio began preparations for celebrating its sesquicentennial, Ohio congressman George H. Bender introduced a bill in Congress to admit Ohio to the Union retroactive to March 1, 1803, the date on which the Ohio General Assembly first convened.[57] At a special session at the old state capital in Chillicothe, the Ohio state legislature approved a new petition for statehood, which was delivered to Washington, D.C., on horseback, and approved that August.[57][58][59] Ohio has had three capital cities: Chillicothe, Zanesville, and Columbus. Chillicothe was the capital from 1803 to 1810. The capital was then moved to Zanesville for two years as part of a state legislative compromise to get a bill passed. The capital was then moved back to Chillicothe from 1812 to 1816. Finally, the capital was moved to Columbus, to be near the state's geographic center. Although many Native Americans migrated west to evade American encroachment, others remained in the state, sometimes assimilating in part. Starting around 1809, the Shawnee pressed resistance to encroachment again. Under Chief Tecumseh, Tecumseh's War officially began in Ohio in 1811. When the War of 1812 began, the British decided to attack from Upper Canada into Ohio and merge their forces with the Shawnee. This continued until Tecumseh was killed at the Battle of the Thames in 1813. Most of the Shawnee, excluding the Pekowi in Southwest Ohio, were forcibly relocated west.[60] Ohio played a key role in the War of 1812, as it was on the front line in the Western theater and the scene of several notable battles both on land and in Lake Erie. On September 10, 1813, the Battle of Lake Erie, one of the major battles, took place near Put-in-Bay, Ohio. The British eventually surrendered to Oliver Hazard Perry. Ultimately, after the U.S. government used the Indian Removal Act of 1830 to force countless Native American tribes on the Trail of Tears, where all the southern states except for Florida were successfully emptied of Native peoples, the government panicked because most tribes did not want to be forced out of their own lands. Fearing further wars between Native tribes and American settlers, they pushed all remaining Native tribes in the East to migrate west against their will, including all remaining tribes in Ohio.[61][62] In 1835, Ohio fought with the Michigan Territory in the Toledo War, a mostly bloodless boundary war over the Toledo Strip. Only one person was injured in the conflict. Congress intervened, making Michigan's admittance as a state conditional on ending the conflict. In exchange for giving up its claim to the Toledo Strip, Michigan was given the western two-thirds of the Upper Peninsula, in addition to the eastern third, which was already considered part of the territory. Ohio's central position and its population gave it an important place in the Civil War. The Ohio River was a vital artery for troop and supply movements, as were Ohio's railroads. Ohio's industry made it one of the most important states in the Union during the war. It contributed more soldiers per capita than any other state in the Union. In 1862, the state's morale was badly shaken in the aftermath of the Battle of Shiloh, a costly victory in which Ohio forces suffered 2,000 casualties.[63] Later that year, when Confederate troops under the leadership of Stonewall Jackson threatened Washington, D.C., Ohio governor David Tod recruited 5,000 volunteers to provide three months of service.[64] From July 13 to 26, 1863, towns along the Ohio River were attacked and ransacked in Morgan's Raid, starting in Harrison in the west and culminating in the Battle of Salineville near West Point in the far east. While this raid was overall insignificant to the Confederacy, it aroused fear among people in Ohio and Indiana as it was the furthest advancement of troops from the South in the war.[65] Almost 35,000 Ohioans died in the conflict, and 30,000 were physically wounded.[66] By the end of the Civil War, the Union's top three generals—Ulysses S. Grant, William Tecumseh Sherman, and Philip Sheridan—were all from Ohio.[67] During much of the 19th century, industry was rapidly introduced to complement an existing agricultural economy. One of the first iron manufacturing plants, Hopewell Furnace, opened near Youngstown in 1804. By the mid-19th century, 48 blast furnaces were operating in Ohio, most in the southern part of the state.[68] Discovery of coal deposits aided the further development of Ohio's steel industry, and by 1853 Cleveland was the nation's third-largest iron and steel producer. The first Bessemer converter was purchased by the Cleveland Rolling Mill Company, which became part of the U.S. Steel Corporation after the merger of Federal Steel Company and Carnegie Steel, the first billion-dollar American corporation.[68] The first open-hearth furnace used for steel production was constructed by the Otis Steel Company in Cleveland, and by 1892, Ohio was the second-largest steel-producing state, behind Pennsylvania.[68] Republic Steel was founded in Youngstown in 1899 and was at one point the nation's third-largest producer. Armco, now AK Steel, was founded in Middletown in 1899. The state legislature officially adopted the flag of Ohio on May 9, 1902.[69] Dayton natives Orville and Wilbur Wright made four brief flights at Kitty Hawk, North Carolina, on December 17, 1903, inventing the first successful airplane.[70] Ohio was hit by its greatest natural disaster in the Great Flood of 1913, resulting in at least 428 fatalities and hundreds of millions of dollars in property damage, particularly around the Great Miami River basin.[71] The National Football League was originally founded in Canton, Ohio in 1920 as the American Professional Football Conference.[72] It included Ohio League teams in five Ohio cities (Akron, Canton, Cleveland, Columbus, and Dayton), none of which still exist. The first official game occurred on October 3, 1920, when the Dayton Triangles beat the Columbus Panhandles 14–0 in Dayton.[73] Canton was enshrined as the home of the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 1963.[74] During the 1930s, the Great Depression struck the state hard. By 1933, more than 40% of factory workers and 67% of construction workers were unemployed in Ohio.[75] Approximately 50% of industrial workers in Cleveland and 80% in Toledo became unemployed, with the state unemployment rate reaching a high of 37.3%.[75] American Jews watched the rise of Nazi Germany with apprehension. Cleveland residents Jerry Siegel and Joe Shuster created the Superman comic character in the spirit of the Jewish golem. Many of their comics portrayed Superman fighting and defeating the Nazis.[76][77] Approximately 839,000 Ohioans served in the U.S. armed forces during World War II, of whom over 23,000 died or were missing in action.[78] Artists, writers, musicians and actors developed in the state throughout the 20th century and often moved to other cities that were larger centers for their work. They included Zane Grey, Milton Caniff, George Bellows, Art Tatum, Roy Lichtenstein, and Roy Rogers. Alan Freed, who emerged from the swing dance culture in Cleveland, hosted the first live rock 'n roll concert in Cleveland in 1952. Famous filmmakers include Steven Spielberg, Chris Columbus and the original Warner Brothers, who set up their first movie theatre in Youngstown before the company relocated to California. The state produced many popular musicians, including Dean Martin, Doris Day, The O'Jays, Marilyn Manson, Dave Grohl, Devo, Macy Gray and The Isley Brothers. Two Ohio astronauts completed significant milestones in the space race in the 1960s: John Glenn becoming the first American to orbit the Earth, and Neil Armstrong becoming the first human to walk on the Moon. In 1967, Carl Stokes was elected mayor of Cleveland and became the first African American mayor of one of the nation's 10 most populous cities.[79] In 1970, an Ohio Army National Guard unit fired at students during an antiwar protest at Kent State University, killing four and wounding nine. The Guard had been called onto campus after several protests in and around campus became violent, including a riot in downtown Kent and the burning of an ROTC building. The main cause of the protests was the United States' invasion of Cambodia during the Vietnam War.[80] Ohio was an important state in the developing ties between the United States and the People's Republic of China in the late 1970s and early 1980s.[81]: 59 Relations between the two countries normalized in 1979, during the second term of Ohio governor Jim Rhodes.[81]: 112 Rhodes sought to encourage economic ties, viewing China as a potential market for Ohio machinery exports.[81]: 112 In July 1979, Rhodes led a State of Ohio Trade Mission to China.[81]: 112 The trip resulted in developing economic ties, a sister state-province relationship with Hubei province, long-running Chinese exhibitions at the Ohio State Fair, and major academic exchanges between Ohio State University and Wuhan University.[81]: 113 Beginning in the 1980s, the state entered into international economic and resource cooperation treaties and organizations with other Midwestern states, as well as New York, Pennsylvania, Ontario, and Quebec, including the Great Lakes Charter, Great Lakes Compact, and the Council of Great Lakes Governors. Ohio's economy has undergone significant change in the 21st century, as the trend of deindustrialization has greatly impacted the American Midwest and the Rust Belt. Manufacturing in the Midwest experienced a stark decline during the early 21st century,[82] a trend that greatly impacted Ohio. From 1990 to 2019, it lost over 300,000 manufacturing jobs, but added over 1,000,000 non-manufacturing jobs.[82] Coinciding with this decline, Ohio has seen a large decline in union membership: 17.4% of Ohioan workers were union members in 2000, while 12.8% were union members in 2022.[83] In the wake of these economic changes, Ohio's state government has looked to promoting new industries to offset manufacturing losses, such as the production of solar energy and electric vehicles.[84] One major program the state government launched was the \"Third Frontier\" program, created during the governorship of Bob Taft, which aimed to increase investment in Ohio and boost its technology sector.[85] As of 2010, the Ohio Department of Development attributes the creation of 9,500 jobs to this program, with an average salary of $65,000,[86] while having a $6.6 billion economic impact with a return on investment of 9:1.[86] In 2010 the state won the International Economic Development Council's Excellence in Economic Development Award, celebrated as a national model of success.[citation needed] Ohio's economy was also heavily afflicted by the Great Recession, as the state's unemployment rate rose from 5.6% in the first two months of 2008 up to a peak of 11.1% in December 2009 and January 2010.[87] It took until August 2014 for the unemployment rate to return to 5.6%.[87] From December 2007 to September 2010, Ohio lost 376,500 jobs.[88] In 2009, Ohio had 89,053 foreclosures filings, a then-record for the state.[89] The median household income dropped 7% from 2006–07 to 2008–09, and the poverty rate ballooned to 13.5% by 2009.[90] By 2015, Ohio gross domestic product was $608.1 billion, the seventh-largest economy among the 50 states.[91] In 2015, Ohio's total GDP accounted for 3.4% of U.S. GDP and 0.8% of world GDP.[91] Politically, Ohio has been long regarded as a swing state,[92] but the success of many Republican candidates in Ohio since the late 2000s has led many to question whether Ohio remains an electoral battleground.[92][93][94] On March 9, 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic reached Ohio, with three cases reported.[95] As of February 2023, over 41,600 Ohioans have died from COVID-19.[95][96] Ohio's economy was also heavily impacted by the pandemic, as the state saw large job losses in 2020, as well as large amounts of subsequent stimulus spending.[97] Ohio's location has proven to be an asset for economic growth and expansion. Because it links the Northeast to the Midwest, much cargo and business traffic passes through its borders along its well-developed highways. Ohio has the nation's 10th-largest highway network and is within a one-day drive of 50% of North America's population and 70% of North America's manufacturing capacity.[98] To the north, Ohio has 312 miles (502 km) of coastline with Lake Erie,[99] which allows for numerous cargo ports such as Cleveland and Toledo. Ohio's southern border is defined by the Ohio River. Ohio's neighbors are Pennsylvania to the east, Michigan to the northwest, Lake Erie to the north, Indiana to the west, Kentucky on the south, and West Virginia on the southeast. Ohio's borders were defined by metes and bounds in the Enabling Act of 1802 as follows: Bounded on the east by the Pennsylvania line, on the south by the Ohio River, to the mouth of the Great Miami River, on the west by the line drawn due north from the mouth of the Great Miami aforesaid, and on the north by an east and west line drawn through the southerly extreme of Lake Michigan, running east after intersecting the due north line aforesaid, from the mouth of the Great Miami until it shall intersect Lake Erie or the territorial line, and thence with the same through Lake Erie to the Pennsylvania line aforesaid. Ohio is bounded by the Ohio River, but nearly all of the river belongs to Kentucky and West Virginia. In 1980, the U.S. Supreme Court held that, based on the wording of the cessation of territory by Virginia (which at the time included what is now Kentucky and West Virginia), the boundary between Ohio and Kentucky (and, by implication, West Virginia) is the northern low-water mark of the river as it existed in 1792.[100] Ohio has only that portion of the river between the river's 1792 low-water mark and the present high-water mark. The border with Michigan has also changed, as a result of the Toledo War, to angle slightly northeast to the north shore of the mouth of the Maumee River. Much of Ohio features glaciated till plains, with an exceptionally flat area in the northwest being known as the Great Black Swamp. This glaciated region in the northwest and central state is bordered to the east and southeast first by a belt known as the glaciated Allegheny Plateau, and then by another belt known as the unglaciated Allegheny Plateau. Most of Ohio is of low relief, but the unglaciated Allegheny Plateau features rugged hills and forests. Ohio's rugged southeastern quadrant, stretching in an outward bow-like arc along the Ohio River from the West Virginia Panhandle to the outskirts of Cincinnati, forms a distinct socioeconomic unit. Geologically similar to parts of West Virginia and southwestern Pennsylvania, this area's coal mining legacy, dependence on small pockets of old manufacturing establishments, and distinctive regional dialect set this section off from the rest of the state. In 1965, Congress passed the Appalachian Regional Development Act, an attempt to \"address the persistent poverty and growing economic despair of the Appalachian Region\".[101] It defines 29 Ohio counties as part of Appalachia.[102] While 1/3 of Ohio's land mass is part of the federally defined Appalachian region, only 12.8% of Ohioans live there (1.476 million people.)[103] Significant Ohio rivers include the Cuyahoga River, Great Miami River, Maumee River, Muskingum River, and Scioto River. The rivers in northern Ohio drain into the northern Atlantic Ocean via Lake Erie and the St. Lawrence River, and those in southern Ohio drain into the Gulf of Mexico via the Ohio River and the Mississippi. Ohio also includes Bass Islands and Kelleys Island.[104] Grand Lake St. Marys in the west-central part of the state was constructed as a supply of water for canals in the canal-building era of 1820–1850. This body of water, over 20 square miles (52 km2), was the largest artificial lake in the world when completed in 1845.[105] Ohio's canal-building projects were not the economic fiasco that similar efforts were in other states. Some cities, such as Dayton, owe their industrial emergence to their location on canals, and as late as 1910 interior canals carried much of the bulk freight of the state. Areas under the protection of the National Park Service include Cuyahoga Valley National Park, Hopewell Culture National Historical Park, Dayton Aviation Heritage National Historical Park, First Ladies National Historic Site, James A. Garfield National Historic Site, William Howard Taft National Historic Site, and the Charles Young Buffalo Soldiers National Monument and Perry's Victory and International Peace Memorial.[106] Ohio has wide variety of unique animal species. Rare and endangered species include the Eastern Hellbender, which is found in the Southeastern Appalachian region of Ohio and is classified as state endangered.[107] The Eastern Hellbender is the 3rd largest amphibian in the world, and can grow up to 27 inches in length. It is fully aquatic and breathes almost entirely through its skin. Due to this, it is only found in pristine, cool, clear, fast flowing streams and rivers. It is highly threatened by habitat loss, water pollution, and sedimentation due to logging and other human activities.[108] The climate of Ohio is a humid continental climate (Köppen climate classification Dfa/Dfb) throughout most of the state, except in the extreme southern counties of Ohio's Bluegrass region section, which are located on the northern periphery of the humid subtropical climate (Cfa) and Upland South region of the United States. Summers are typically hot and humid throughout the state, while winters generally range from cool to cold. Precipitation in Ohio is moderate year-round. Severe weather is not uncommon in the state, although there are typically fewer tornado reports in Ohio than in states located in what is known as the Tornado Alley. Severe lake effect snowstorms are also not uncommon on the southeast shore of Lake Erie, which is located in an area designated as the Snowbelt. Although predominantly not in a subtropical climate, some warmer-climate flora and fauna do reach well into Ohio. For instance, some trees with more southern ranges, such as the blackjack oak, Quercus marilandica, are found at their northernmost in Ohio just north of the Ohio River. Also evidencing this climatic transition from a subtropical to a continental climate, several plants such as the Southern magnolia (Magnolia grandiflora), Albizia julibrissin (mimosa), Crape Myrtle, and even the occasional Needle Palm are hardy landscape materials regularly used as street, yard, and garden plantings in the Bluegrass region of Ohio; but these same plants will simply not thrive in much of the rest of the state. This interesting change may be observed while traveling through Ohio on Interstate 75 from Cincinnati to Toledo; the observant traveler of this diverse state may even catch a glimpse of Cincinnati's common wall lizard, one of the few examples of permanent \"subtropical\" fauna in Ohio. The worst weather disaster in Ohio history occurred along the Great Miami River in 1913. Known as the Great Dayton Flood, the entire Miami River watershed flooded, including the downtown business district of Dayton. As a result, the Miami Conservancy District was created as the first major floodplain engineering project in Ohio and the United States.[109] The highest recorded temperature was 113 °F (45 °C), near Gallipolis on July 21, 1934.[111] The lowest recorded temperature was −39 °F (−39 °C), at Milligan on February 10, 1899,[112] during the Great Blizzard of 1899.[113] Although few have registered as noticeable to the average resident, more than 200 earthquakes with a magnitude of 2.0 or higher have occurred in Ohio since 1776.[114] The Western Ohio Seismic Zone and a portion of the Southern Great Lakes Seismic Zone are located in the state, and numerous faults lie under the surface.[114][115] The most substantial known earthquake in Ohio history was the Anna (Shelby County) earthquake,[116] which occurred on March 9, 1937. It was centered in western Ohio, with a magnitude of 5.4, and was of intensity VIII.[117] Other significant earthquakes in Ohio include:[118] one of magnitude 4.8 near Lima on September 19, 1884;[119] one of magnitude 4.2 near Portsmouth on May 17, 1901;[120] and one of 5.0 in LeRoy Township in Lake County on January 31, 1986, which continued to trigger 13 aftershocks of magnitude 0.5 to 2.4 for two months.[121][122] Notable Ohio earthquakes in the 21st century include one occurring on December 31, 2011, approximately 4 kilometers (2.5 mi) northwest of Youngstown,[123] and one occurring on June 10, 2019, approximately 5 kilometers (3.1 mi) north-northwest of Eastlake under Lake Erie;[124] both registered a 4.0 magnitude. There are 13 metropolitan statistical areas in Ohio, anchored by 16 cities, as defined by the U.S. Office of Management and Budget. Additionally, 30 Ohio cities function as centers of micropolitan statistical areas, urban clusters smaller than that of metropolitan areas. Ohio's three largest cities are Columbus, Cleveland, and Cincinnati. Columbus is the capital of the state, near its geographic center, and is well known for Ohio State University. In 2019, the city had six corporations named to the U.S. Fortune 500 list: Alliance Data, Nationwide Mutual Insurance Company, American Electric Power, L Brands, Huntington Bancshares, and Cardinal Health in suburban Dublin.[125][126] Other major employers include hospitals (among others, Wexner Medical Center and Nationwide Children's Hospital), high tech research and development including the Battelle Memorial Institute, information-based companies such as OCLC and Chemical Abstracts Service, manufacturer Worthington Industries, and financial institutions such as JPMorgan Chase and Huntington Bancshares. Fast food chains Wendy's and White Castle are also headquartered in Columbus. Located in Northeast Ohio along the Lake Erie shore, Cleveland is characterized by its New England heritage, ethnic immigrant cultures, and history as a major American manufacturing and healthcare center. It anchors the Cleveland–Akron–Canton Combined Statistical Area, of which the industrial cities of Akron and Canton are constituent parts. Mansfield, Sandusky and Youngstown are also major cities in the region. Northeast Ohio is known for major industrial companies Goodyear Tire and Rubber and Timken, top-ranked colleges Case Western Reserve University, Oberlin College, and Kent State University, the Cleveland Clinic, and cultural attractions including the Cleveland Museum of Art, Big Five member Cleveland Orchestra, Cuyahoga Valley National Park, Playhouse Square, the Pro Football Hall of Fame, and the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. Cincinnati anchors Southwest Ohio and the Cincinnati metropolitan area, which also encompasses counties in Kentucky and Indiana. The metropolitan area is home to Miami University and the University of Cincinnati, Cincinnati Union Terminal, Cincinnati Symphony Orchestra, and various Fortune 500 companies, including Procter & Gamble, Kroger, Macy's, Inc., and Fifth Third Bank. Dayton and Springfield are in the Miami Valley, which is home to the University of Dayton, the Dayton Ballet, and the extensive Wright-Patterson Air Force Base. Toledo and Lima are the major cities in Northwest Ohio, an area known for its glass-making industry. It is home to Owens Corning and Owens-Illinois, two Fortune 500 corporations. Steubenville is the only metropolitan city in Appalachian Ohio, a region known for its mixed mesophytic forests. Other metropolitan areas that contain cities in Ohio but are primarily in other states include the Huntington, West Virginia and Wheeling, West Virginia areas. Ohio is the US state with the highest number of cities with the same name as UK cities.[127] From just over 45,000 residents in 1800, Ohio's population grew faster than 10% per decade (except for the 1940 census) until the 1970 census, which recorded just over 10.65 million Ohioans.[131] Growth then slowed for the next four decades.[132] The United States Census Bureau counted 11,808,848 in the 2020 census, a 2.4% increase since the 2010 United States census.[133] Ohio's population growth lags that of the entire United States, and whites are found in a greater density than the U.S. average. As of 2000[update], Ohio's center of population is located in Morrow County,[134] in the county seat of Mount Gilead.[135] This is approximately 6,346 feet (1,934 m) south and west of Ohio's population center in 1990.[134] As of 2011, 27.6% of Ohio's children under the age of 1 belonged to minority groups.[136] Approximately 6.2% of Ohio's population was under five years of age, 23.7% under 18 years of age, and 14.1% were 65 or older; females made up an estimated 51.2% of the population. According to HUD's 2022 Annual Homeless Assessment Report, there were an estimated 10,654 homeless people in Ohio.[137][138] Note: Births in table do not add up because Hispanics are counted both by their ethnicity and by their race, giving a higher overall number. In 2010, there were 469,700 foreign-born residents in Ohio, corresponding to 4.1% of the total population. Of these, 229,049 (2.0%) were naturalized U.S. citizens and 240,699 (2.1%) were not.[12] The largest groups were:[154] Mexico (54,166), India (50,256), China (34,901), Germany (19,219), Philippines (16,410), United Kingdom (15,917), Canada (14,223), Russia (11,763), South Korea (11,307), and Ukraine (10,681). Though predominantly white, Ohio has large black populations in all major metropolitan areas throughout the state, Ohio has a significant Hispanic population made up of Mexicans in Toledo and Columbus, and Puerto Ricans in Cleveland and Columbus, and also has a significant and diverse Asian population in Columbus. Ancestry groups (which the census defines as not including racial terms) in the state were:[12][155] 26.5% German, 14.1% Irish, 9.0% English, 6.4% Italian, 3.8% Polish, 2.5% French, 1.9% Scottish, 1.7% Hungarian, 1.6% Dutch, 1.5% Mexican, 1.2% Slovak, 1.1% Welsh, and 1.1% Scotch-Irish. Ancestries claimed by less than 1% of the population include Sub-Saharan African, Puerto Rican, Swiss, Swedish, Arab, Greek, Norwegian, Romanian, Austrian, Lithuanian, Finnish, West Indian, Portuguese and Slovene. About 6.7% of the population age 5 years and older reported speaking a language other than English, with 2.2% of the population speaking Spanish, 2.6% speaking other Indo-European languages, 1.1% speaking Asian and Austronesian languages, and 0.8% speaking other languages.[12] Numerically: 10,100,586 spoke English, 239,229 Spanish, 55,970 German, 38,990 Chinese, 33,125 Arabic, and 32,019 French. In addition, 59,881 spoke a Slavic language and 42,673 spoke another West Germanic language according to the 2010 census.[156] Ohio also had the nation's largest population of Slovene speakers, second largest of Slovak speakers, second largest of Pennsylvania Dutch (German) speakers, and the third largest of Serbian speakers.[157] Religious self-identification, per Public Religion Research Institute's 2021 American Values Survey[158] According to Public Religion Research Institute's 2021 American Values Survey, 64% of Ohioans identified as Christian. Specifically, 19% of Ohio's population identified as Mainline Protestant, 17% as Evangelical Protestant, 7% as Historically Black Protestant, and 18% as Catholic. Roughly 30% of the population were unaffiliated with any religious body. Small minorities of Jews (2%), Hindus (1%), Jehovah's Witnesses (<1%), Muslims (<1%), Buddhists (<1%), Mormons (<1%), and other faiths exist according to this study.[158] Altogether, those identifying with a religion or spiritual tradition were 70% of the state's population. Per the Association of Religion Data Archives's (ARDA) 2020 study, Christianity remained the predominant religion. Non-denominational Christianity, numbering 1,411,863, were the largest Protestant cohort, although Catholicism remained the single-largest denomination with 1,820,233 adherents.[159] According to the ARDA, in 2010 the largest Christian denominations by adherents were the Catholic Church with 1,992,567; the United Methodist Church with 496,232; the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America with 223,253, the Southern Baptist Convention with 171,000, the Christian Churches and Churches of Christ with 141,311, the United Church of Christ with 118,000, and the Presbyterian Church (USA) with 110,000.[160] With about 80,000 adherents in 2020, Ohio had the second largest Amish population of all U.S. states, only behind neighboring Pennsylvania.[161] According to a Pew Forum poll in 2014, a majority of Ohioans, 56%, felt religion was \"very important\", 25% that it was \"somewhat important\", and 19% that religion was \"not too important/not important at all\". Among them, 38% of Ohioans indicate that they attend religious services at least once weekly, 32% occasionally, and 30% seldom or never.[162] According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the total number of people employed in 2016 was 4,790,178. The total number of unique employer establishments was 252,201, while the total number of non-employer establishments was 785,833.[163] In 2010, Ohio was ranked second in the country for best business climate by Site Selection magazine, based on a business-activity database.[164] The state has also won three consecutive Governor's Cup awards from the magazine, based on business growth and developments.[165] As of 2016[update], Ohio's gross domestic product (GDP) was $626 billion.[166] This ranks Ohio's economy as the seventh-largest among all 50 states and Washington, D.C.[167] The Small Business & Entrepreneurship Council ranked the state No. 10 for best business-friendly tax systems in their Business Tax Index 2009, including a top corporate tax and capital gains rate that were both ranked No. 6 at 1.9%.[168] Ohio was ranked No. 11 by the council for best friendly-policy states according to their Small Business Survival Index 2009.[169] The Directorship's Boardroom Guide ranked the state No. 13 overall for best business climate, including No. 7 for best litigation climate.[170] Forbes ranked the state No. 8 for best regulatory environment in 2009.[171] Ohio has five of the top 115 colleges in the nation, according to U.S. News & World Report's 2010 rankings,[172] and was ranked No. 8 by the same magazine in 2008 for best high schools.[173] Ohio's unemployment rate stands at 4.5% as of February 2018,[174] down from 10.7% in May 2010.[175][176] The state still lacks 45,000 jobs compared to the pre-recession numbers of 2007.[177] The labor force participation as of April 2015 is 63%, slightly above the national average.[177] As of 2023[update], Ohio's per capita income was $60,402, ranking 38th in the U.S., and the state's median household income was $65,720.[178][179] Also in 2023, 13.4% of the population was living below the poverty line.[180] The manufacturing and financial activities sectors each compose 18.3% of Ohio's GDP, making them Ohio's largest industries by percentage of GDP.[167] Ohio has the third largest manufacturing workforce behind California and Texas.[181][182] Ohio has the largest bioscience sector in the Midwest, and is a national leader in the \"green\" economy. Ohio is the largest producer in the country of plastics, rubber, fabricated metals, electrical equipment, and appliances.[183] 5,212,000 Ohioans are currently employed by wage or salary.[167] By employment, Ohio's largest sector is trade/transportation/utilities, which employs 1,010,000 Ohioans, or 19.4% of Ohio's workforce, while the health care and education sector employs 825,000 Ohioans (15.8%).[167] Government employs 787,000 Ohioans (15.1%), manufacturing employs 669,000 Ohioans (12.9%), and professional and technical services employs 638,000 Ohioans (12.2%).[167] Ohio's manufacturing sector is the third-largest of all fifty United States states in terms of gross domestic product.[167] Fifty-nine of the United States' top 1,000 publicly traded companies (by revenue in 2008) are headquartered in Ohio, including Procter & Gamble, Goodyear Tire & Rubber, AK Steel, Timken, Abercrombie & Fitch, and Wendy's.[184] Ohio is also one of 41 states with its own lottery,[185] the Ohio Lottery.[186] As of 2020[update], the Ohio Lottery has contributed more than $26 billion to education beginning in 1974.[187] Income inequality in Ohio, both before and after taxes, has risen significantly since the 1970s.[188] Ohio's overall income grew in Ohio from 2009 to 2012, with an overall 7.1% increase in income growth. The top 1% had a 37.0% in income growth, while the bottom 99% grew their income by only 2.3%. The top 1% accounted for 71.9% of the overall shared income during this period.[189] The burden of income tax falls disproportionately on lower-income tax brackets. In 2018, the bottom 20% of earners contributed 12.3% of their income towards various taxes, while the top 1% only paid 6.5%.[190] Ohio is home to 30 art institutions, including the Columbus Museum of Art, Cincinnati Art Museum, Cleveland Museum of Art, and other entities. The full list includes: The Cincinnati Art Museum holds over 100,000 works spanning 6,000 years of human history, being among the most comprehensive collections in the Midwest. Among its notable collections are works by Master of San Baudelio, Jorge Ingles, Sandro Botticelli (Judith with Head of Holofernes), Matteo di Giovanni, Domenico Tintoretto (Portrait of Venetian dux Marino Grimani), Mattia Preti, Bernardo Strozzi, Frans Hals, Bartolomé Esteban Murillo (St. Thomas of Villanueva), Peter Paul Rubens (Samson and Delilah) and Aert van der Neer. The collection also includes works by Jean-Baptiste-Camille Corot, Pierre-Auguste Renoir, Camille Pissarro, Claude Monet (Rocks At Belle Isle), and Pablo Picasso. The museum also has a large collection of paintings by American painter Frank Duveneck (Elizabeth B. Duveneck). The Cleveland Museum of Art is internationally renowned for its substantial holdings of Asian and Egyptian art, and has a permanent collection of more than 61,000 works from around the world.[192] It is the fourth-wealthiest art museum in the United States.[193] The Columbus Museum of Art holds nineteenth and early twentieth-century American and European art, including early Cubist paintings by Pablo Picasso and Juan Gris, works by François Boucher, Paul Cézanne, Mary Cassatt, Jean Auguste Dominique Ingres, Edgar Degas, Henri Matisse, Claude Monet, Edward Hopper, and Norman Rockwell, and installations by Mel Chin, Josiah McElheny, Susan Philipsz, and Allan Sekula. Also in Columbus, the Billy Ireland Cartoon Library & Museum collection includes 450,000 original cartoons, 36,000 books, 51,000 serial titles, and 3,000 feet (910 m) of manuscript materials, plus 2.5 million comic strip clippings and tear sheets, making it the largest research library for cartoon art. Youngstown's Butler Institute of American Art was the first museum dedicated exclusively to American art.[194] Playhouse Square in downtown Cleveland is the nation's second-largest performing arts center, home to ten theaters.[195] The Columbus Association for the Performing Arts manages seven historic Columbus area theaters.[196] Buckeye candy is a local specialty, popular in the state of Ohio. The confection is a variation of standard peanut butter cups known as a 'Buckeye'. Coated in chocolate, with a partially exposed center of peanut butter fudge, the candy resembles the appearance of the nut that grows on the state tree, commonly known as the buckeye. Cincinnati-style chili is a Greek-inspired meat sauce, (ground beef seasoned with cinnamon, nutmeg, allspice, cloves, bay leaf, cumin, chili powder, and in some home recipes, chocolate), used as a topping for spaghetti or hot dogs. Additionally, red beans, chopped onions, and shredded cheese are offered as extra toppings referred to as \"ways.\"[197] The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and the Rhythm and Blues Music Hall of Fame are both located in Cleveland. Cleveland disc jockey Alan Freed is credited with coining the term and promoting rock and roll in the early 1950s. Cincinnati is home to the American Classical Music Hall of Fame and Museum. Six Ohio musicians are Rock and Roll Hall of Fame members, Dave Grohl (Nirvana and Foo Fighters), the Isley Brothers, Nine Inch Nails, Bobby Womack, Benjamin Orr (The Cars), and Chrissie Hynde (The Pretenders). Also inducted was disk jockey Alan Freed. Other popular musicians from Ohio include Mamie Smith, Dean Martin, Tyler Joseph and Josh Dun of Twenty One Pilots, Frankie Yankovic, Doris Day, the McGuire Sisters, Howard Hewett, Shirley Murdock, Boz Scaggs, John Legend, Marilyn Manson, Starset, Dan Auerbach and Patrick Carney of the Black Keys, Griffin Layne, Joe Dolce, Kid Cudi, William \"Bootsy\" Collins, Stephanie Eulinberg of Kid Rock's Twisted Brown Trucker Band, and Devo. The Cleveland Orchestra is one of the historic Big Five orchestras in the U.S. and considered among the best worldwide.[198] Many other Ohio cities are home to their own orchestras, including Akron, Blue Ash, Canton, Cincinnati, Columbus, Dayton, Toledo, and Youngstown. Cincinnati is home to its own ballet, symphony orchestra, pops orchestra, and opera, all housed at the Cincinnati Music Hall. Dayton is also home to a ballet, orchestra, and opera, collectively known as the Dayton Performing Arts Alliance. Within the marching arts, Winter Guard International has hosted national championships in performing arts at the University of Dayton 18 times between 1983 and 2003, and has permanently since 2005. The Bluecoats Drum and Bugle Corps are Ohio's highest fielding drum corps, competing in the Drum Corps International World Class circuit out of Canton. Ohio is home to eight professional sports teams across the five different major leagues in the United States. Current teams include the Cincinnati Reds and Cleveland Guardians of Major League Baseball,[199][200] the Columbus Crew and FC Cincinnati of Major League Soccer,[201] the Cleveland Cavaliers of the National Basketball Association,[202] the Cincinnati Bengals and Cleveland Browns of the National Football League,[203] and the Columbus Blue Jackets of the National Hockey League.[204] Ohio has brought home seven World Series titles (Reds 1919, 1940, 1975, 1976, 1990; Indians 1920, 1948), three MLS Cups (Crew 2008, 2020, 2023), one NBA Championship (Cavaliers 2016), and nine NFL Championships (Pros 1920; Bulldogs 1922, 1923, 1924; Rams 1945; Browns 1950, 1954, 1955, 1964). Despite this success in the NFL in the first half of the 20th century, no Ohio team has won the Super Bowl since its inception in 1967. No Ohio team has made an appearance in the Stanley Cup Finals. Ohio played a central role in the development of both Major League Baseball and the National Football League. Baseball's first fully professional team, the Cincinnati Red Stockings of 1869, were organized in Ohio.[205] An informal early-20th-century American football association, the Ohio League, was the direct predecessor of the modern NFL, although neither of Ohio's modern NFL franchises trace their roots to an Ohio League club. The NFL itself was founded in Canton in 1920 as the American Professional Football Conference.[72] The first official game occurred on October 3, 1920, when the Dayton Triangles beat the Columbus Panhandles 14–0 in Dayton.[73] Canton was enshrined as the home of the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 1963.[74] On a smaller scale, Ohio hosts minor league baseball, arena football, indoor football, mid-level hockey, and lower division soccer. The Mid-Ohio Sports Car Course has hosted several auto racing championships, including CART World Series, IndyCar Series, NASCAR Nationwide Series, Can-Am, Formula 5000, IMSA GT Championship, American Le Mans Series and Rolex Sports Car Series. The Grand Prix of Cleveland also hosted CART races from 1982 to 2007. The Eldora Speedway is a major dirt oval that hosts NASCAR Camping World Truck Series, World of Outlaws Sprint Cars and USAC Silver Crown Series races. Ohio hosts two PGA Tour events, the WGC-Bridgestone Invitational and Memorial Tournament. The Cincinnati Open is an ATP World Tour Masters 1000 and WTA 1000 tennis tournament. Ohio has eight NCAA Division I Football Bowl Subdivision college football teams, divided among three different conferences. It has also experienced considerable success in the secondary and tertiary tiers of college football divisions. There are two programs in the Power Five conferences; the Ohio State Buckeyes of the Big Ten Conference and the Cincinnati Bearcats of the Big 12 Conference. The Ohio State Buckeyes football team is second in all-time winning percentage, with a 931–327–53 overall record and a 28–29 bowl record as of 2023. The program has produced seven Heisman Trophy winners, forty conference titles, and eight undisputed national championships. The men's basketball program has appeared in the NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament 27 times. The Cincinnati Bearcats men's basketball team has over 1,800 wins and 33 March Madness appearances, whilst the Bearcats football team became the first so-called \"Group of Five\" team to qualify to the College Football Playoff in 2022.[206] In the Group of Five conferences, six teams are represented in the Mid-American Conference: the Akron Zips, Bowling Green Falcons, Kent State Golden Flashes, Miami RedHawks, Ohio Bobcats and the Toledo Rockets. The MAC headquarters are in Cleveland. The Cincinnati–Miami rivalry game has been played in southwest Ohio every year since 1888 and is the oldest current non-conference NCAA football rivalry. Other Division I schools, either part of the NCAA Division I Football Championship Subdivision or not fielding in football include the Cleveland State Vikings, Xavier Musketeers, Wright State Raiders, and Youngstown State Penguins. Xavier's men's basketball has performed particularly well, with 27 March Madness appearances. Youngstown State's football has the third most NCAA Division I Football Championship wins, with 3. There are 12 NCAA Division II universities and 22 NCAA Division III universities in Ohio. The state government of Ohio consists of the executive, legislative, and judicial branches.[207][208][209] The executive branch is headed by the governor of Ohio.[207] The current governor is Mike DeWine since 2019, a member of the Republican Party.[210] A lieutenant governor succeeds the governor in the event of any removal from office, and performs any duties assigned by the governor.[211][212] The current lieutenant governor is Jon Husted. The other elected constitutional offices in the executive branch are the secretary of state (Frank LaRose), auditor (Keith Faber), treasurer (Robert Sprague), and attorney general (Dave Yost).[207] There are 21 state administrative departments in the executive branch.[213][214] The Ohio General Assembly is a bicameral legislature consisting of the Senate and House of Representatives.[215] The Senate is composed of 33 districts, each of which is represented by one senator. Each senator represents approximately 330,000 constituents.[216] The House of Representatives has 99 members.[217] The Republican Party is the majority party in both houses as of the 2022 election cycle. In order to be enacted into law, a bill must be adopted by both houses of the General Assembly and signed by the governor. If the governor vetoes a bill, the General Assembly can override the veto with a three-fifths supermajority of both houses. A bill will also become a law if the governor fails to sign or veto it within 10 days of its being presented. The session laws are published in the official Law of Ohio.[218] These in turn have been codified in the Ohio Revised Code.[219] The General Assembly, with the approval of the governor, draws the U.S. congressional district lines for Ohio's 16 seats in the United States House of Representatives. The Ohio Apportionment Board draws state legislative district lines in Ohio. There are three levels of the Ohio state judiciary. The lowest is the court of common pleas: each county maintains its own constitutionally mandated court of common pleas, which maintain jurisdiction over \"all justiciable matters\".[220] The intermediate-level court system is the district court system.[221] Twelve courts of appeals exist, each retaining jurisdiction over appeals from common pleas, municipal, and county courts in a set geographical area.[220] A case heard in this system is decided by a three-judge panel, and each judge is elected.[220] The state's highest-ranking court is the Ohio Supreme Court.[222] A seven-justice panel composes the court, which, by its own discretion, hears appeals from the courts of appeals, and retains original jurisdiction over limited matters.[223] There are also several levels of local government in Ohio: counties, municipalities (cities and villages), townships, special districts, and school districts. Ohio is divided into 88 counties.[224] Ohio law defines a structure for county government, although they may adopt charters for home rule.[225][226] Summit County[225] and Cuyahoga County[227] have chosen an alternate form of government. The other counties have a government with a three-member board of county commissioners,[228] a sheriff,[229] coroner,[230] auditor,[231] treasurer,[232] clerk of the court of common pleas[233] prosecutor,[234] engineer,[235] and recorder.[236] There are two kinds of incorporated municipalities, 251 cities and 681 villages.[225][237][238] If a municipality has five thousand or more residents as of the last United States Census it is a city, otherwise it is a village.[225][239] Municipalities have full home rule powers, may adopt a charter, ordinances and resolutions for self-government.[240] Each municipality chooses its own form of government, but most have elected mayors and city councils or city commissions. City governments provide much more extensive services than county governments, such as police forces and paid (as opposed to volunteer) fire departments. The entire area of the state is encompassed by townships.[225] When the boundaries of a township are coterminous with the boundaries of a city or village, the township ceases to exist as a separate government (called a paper township).[225] Townships are governed by a three-member board of township trustees.[225] Townships may have limited home rule powers.[241] There are more than 600 city, local, and exempted village school districts providing K-12 education in Ohio, as well as about four dozen joint vocation school districts, which are separate from the K-12 districts. Each city school district, local school district, or exempted village school district is governed by an elected board of education.[225] A school district previously under state supervision (municipal school district) may be governed by a board whose members either are elected or appointed by the mayor of the municipality containing the greatest portion of the district's area.[225] Historian R. Douglas Hurt asserts that not since Virginia \"had a state made such a mark on national political affairs\" as Ohio.[243] The Economist notes that \"This slice of the mid-west contains a bit of everything American—part north-eastern and part southern, part urban and part rural, part hardscrabble poverty and part booming suburb\".[244] Ohio is considered a moderately Republican-leaning state politically.[92][245][246] It had been a swing state in the late 20th and early 21st centuries; this status was called into question after the state voted for Republican Donald Trump at larger margins than the nation as a whole in the 2016, 2020 and 2024 presidential elections.[247][248] It has also been considered a bellwether state.[249][250] Since 1896, Ohio has had only three misses in the general election (1944, 1960, 2020) and had the longest perfect streak of any state, voting for the winning presidential candidate in each election from 1964 to 2016 and in 34 of the 39 held since the American Civil War. No Republican has ever won the presidency without winning Ohio. As of 2024, there are more than 8 million registered Ohioan voters, of which over 70% are not affiliated with any political party. They are disproportionate in age, with a million more over 65 than there are 18- to 24-year-olds.[251] Since the 2010 midterm elections, Ohio's voter demographic has leaned towards the Republican Party.[252] The governor, Mike DeWine, is Republican, as are all other non-judicial statewide elected officials. In the Ohio State Senate the Republicans are the majority, 25–8, and in the Ohio House of Representatives the Republicans control the delegation 64–35. Following the 2020 census, Ohio has 15 seats in the U.S. House of Representatives.[253] As of the 2022 election cycle, ten federal representatives are Republicans while five are Democrats. Marcy Kaptur (D-09) is the most senior member of the Ohio delegation to the U.S. House of Representatives.[254] The senior U.S. senator is JD Vance and the junior is Bernie Moreno. Both are Republicans. Six U.S. presidents hailed from Ohio at the time of their elections, giving rise to its nickname \"mother of presidents\", a sobriquet it shares with Virginia. It is also termed \"modern mother of presidents\", in contrast to Virginia's status as the origin of presidents earlier in American history. Virginia-born William Henry Harrison lived much of his life in North Bend, Ohio, was elected from the state and is also buried there. The other five presidents are Rutherford B. Hayes, James A. Garfield, William McKinley, William Howard Taft and Warren G. Harding.[255] Seven presidents were born in Ohio, making it second to Virginia's eight; in addition to the aforementioned five, Ulysses S. Grant was elected from Illinois and Benjamin Harrison was elected from Indiana.[255] In a 2020 study, Ohio was ranked as the 17th hardest state for citizens to vote in.[256] Since 1994, the state has had a policy of purging infrequent voters from its rolls. In April 2016, a lawsuit was filed, challenging this policy on the grounds that it violated the National Voter Registration Act (NVRA) of 1993[257] and the Help America Vote Act of 2002.[258] In June, the federal district court ruled for the plaintiffs and entered a preliminary injunction applicable only to the November 2016 election. The preliminary injunction was upheld in September by the Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit. Had it not been upheld, thousands of voters would have been purged from the rolls just a few weeks before the election.[257][259] Ohio's system of public education is outlined in Article VI of the state constitution, and in Title XXXIII of the Ohio Revised Code. Substantively, Ohio's system is similar to those found in other states. At the State level, the Ohio Department of Education governs primary and secondary educational institutions. At the municipal level, there are approximately 700 school districts statewide. The Ohio Board of Regents coordinates and assists with Ohio's institutions of higher education. Ohio is home to several public and private institutions of higher learning. Prior to statehood, the Northwest Ordinance of 1787 included a provision to establish an institution of higher education in the region, resulting in the establishment of Ohio University in 1804 as Ohio's first college.[261][262][263] The University System of Ohio includes all of Ohio's public institutions of higher education. It includes 14 four-year research universities, 24 branch and regional campuses, and 23 community colleges and technical colleges. Ohio State University is the largest of the system, with over 60,000 students at its main campus in Columbus.[260] Kenyon College is the state's oldest private liberal arts college, established in 1824 by an Episcopal bishop to train clergy on the Ohio frontier. Oberlin College, established in 1833, was among the earliest colleges in the US to admit African Americans in 1835, and became the first to admit women in 1837.[264] The Carnegie Foundation classifies five of the state's institutions as tier 1 research universities: Case Western Reserve University, Kent State University, Ohio State University, Ohio University, and the University of Cincinnati.[265] Ohio is home to some of the nation's highest-ranked public libraries.[266] Major metropolitan public library systems include the Cleveland Public Library, the Cuyahoga County Public Library, the Cincinnati and Hamilton County Public Library, and the Columbus Metropolitan Library. The Ohio Public Library Information Network provides Ohio residents with internet access to their 251 public libraries. It also provides Ohioans with free home access to high-quality, subscription research databases. The OhioLINK library consortium provides Ohio's college and university libraries with mutual access to their collections. The program allows researchers access to books and other media that might not be otherwise available. CLEVNET, another major library consortium, is based at the Cleveland Public Library and includes 47 public library systems in Northeast Ohio.[267] Many major east–west transportation corridors go through Ohio. One of those pioneer routes, known in the early 20th century as \"Main Market Route 3\", was chosen in 1913 to become part of the historic Lincoln Highway which was the first road across America, connecting New York City to San Francisco. In Ohio, the Lincoln Highway linked many towns and cities together, including Canton, Mansfield, Wooster, Lima, and Van Wert. The Lincoln Highway's arrival in Ohio was a major influence on the state's development. Upon the advent of the federal numbered highway system in 1926, the Lincoln Highway through Ohio became U.S. Route 30. Ohio is home to 228 miles (367 km) of the National Road, now U.S. Route 40. Ohio has a highly developed network of roads and interstate highways. Major east-west through routes include the Ohio Turnpike (I-80/I-90) in the north, I-76 through Akron to Pennsylvania, I-70 through Columbus and Dayton, and the Appalachian Highway (State Route 32) running from West Virginia to Cincinnati. Major north–south routes include I-75 in the west through Toledo, Dayton, and Cincinnati, I-71 through the middle of the state from Cleveland through Columbus and Cincinnati into Kentucky, and I-77 in the eastern part of the state from Cleveland through Akron, Canton, New Philadelphia and Marietta south into West Virginia. Interstate 75 between Cincinnati and Dayton is one of Ohio's most heavily traveled sections of interstate. Ohio has a highly developed network of signed state bicycle routes. Many of them follow rail trails, with conversion ongoing. The Ohio to Erie Trail (route 1) connects Cincinnati, Columbus, and Cleveland. U.S. Bicycle Route 50 traverses Ohio from Steubenville to the Indiana state line outside Richmond.[268] Ohio has several long-distance hiking trails, the most prominent of which is the Buckeye Trail, which extends 1,444 mi (2,324 km) in a loop around the state. Part of it is on roads and part on wooded trail. Additionally, the North Country Trail (the longest of the 11 National Scenic Trails authorized by Congress) and the American Discovery Trail (a system of recreational trails and roads that collectively form a coast-to-coast route across the mid-tier of the United States) pass through Ohio. Much of these two trails coincide with the Buckeye Trail. Ohio has an extensive rail network, though today most lines carry only freight traffic. Three Class I freight railroads operate in Ohio: CSX Transportation, Norfolk Southern Railway, and Canadian National Railway. Many local freight carriers also exist in the state. Amtrak, the national passenger railroad, operates three long-distance rail routes through Ohio. The Lake Shore Limited serves Cleveland, Elyria, Toledo, Sandusky, and Bryan. The Capitol Limited stops in those cities as well as in Alliance. The Cardinal serves Cincinnati Union Terminal. From Ohio, passengers can ride directly to Chicago, New York, Boston, Washington, D.C., Indianapolis, Pittsburgh, Buffalo, and dozens of destinations in-between. Columbus is the largest city in the U.S. with no passenger rail. Its Union Station was last served in 1979 by the National Limited. Ohio is home to several scenic railways and museums, including the Cuyahoga Valley Scenic Railroad through Cuyahoga Valley National Park, the Age of Steam Roundhouse museum, and the Hocking Valley Scenic Railway near Hocking Hills State Park. Mass transit exists in many forms in Ohio cities, primarily through bus systems. The Greater Cleveland Regional Transit Authority (GCRTA) operates the RTA Rapid Transit system, which consists of one heavy rail line, three light rail lines, and three bus rapid transit lines. Cincinnati is served by the Southwest Ohio Regional Transit Authority (SORTA) bus network as well as a 3.6-mile (5.8 km) streetcar line, the Cincinnati Bell Connector. Other major transit agencies in Ohio include the Central Ohio Transit Authority (COTA) serving Columbus and the Greater Dayton Regional Transit Authority (GDRTA) serving Dayton. Ohio has four international airports, four commercial, and two military. The four international include Cleveland Hopkins International Airport, John Glenn Columbus International Airport, Dayton International Airport, and Rickenbacker International Airport (one of two military airfields). The other military airfield is Wright Patterson Air Force Base which is one of the largest Air Force bases in the United States. Other major airports are in Toledo and Akron. Cincinnati's main airport, Cincinnati/Northern Kentucky International Airport, is in Hebron, Kentucky, and therefore is not included in Ohio airport lists. 40°N 83°W﻿ / ﻿40°N 83°W﻿ / 40; -83﻿ (State of Ohio)",

                "content": "The Ohio State University (Ohio State or OSU) is a public land-grant research university in Columbus, Ohio, United States. A member of the University System of Ohio, it was founded in 1870. It is one of the largest universities by enrollment in the United States, with nearly 50,000 undergraduate students and nearly 15,000 graduate students. The university consists of sixteen colleges and offers over 400 degree programs at the undergraduate and graduate levels.[7] It is classified among \"R1: Doctoral Universities – Very high research activity\". As of 2024,[update] the university has an endowment of $7.9 billion. Its athletic teams compete in NCAA Division I as the Ohio State Buckeyes as a member of the Big Ten Conference for the majority of fielded sports. It is a member of the Association of American Universities. Past and present alumni and faculty include 6 Nobel Prize laureates, 9 Rhodes Scholars, 7 Churchill Scholars, 1 Fields Medalist, 7 Pulitzer Prize winners, 64 Goldwater scholars, 7 U.S. senators, 15 U.S. representatives, 104 Olympic medalists, and 1 foreign head of state. The proposal of a manufacturing and agriculture university in central Ohio was initially met in the 1870s with hostility from the state's agricultural interests and competition for resources from Ohio University, which was chartered by the Northwest Ordinance and Miami University.[8] Championed by the Republican governor Rutherford B. Hayes, the Ohio State University was founded in 1870 as a land-grant university under the Morrill Act of 1862 as the Ohio Agricultural and Mechanical College.[8] The university opened its doors to 24 students on September 17, 1873. In 1878, the first class of six men graduated. The first woman graduated the following year.[9] Also in 1878, the Ohio legislature recognized an expanded scope for the university by changing its name to \"the Ohio State University.\"[10][11] In 1906, Ohio State segregationist[12] president William Oxley Thompson, along with the university's supporters in the state legislature, put forth the Lybarger Bill with the aim of shifting virtually all higher education support to the continued development of Ohio State while funding only the \"normal school\" functions of the state's other public universities. Although the Lybarger Bill failed narrowly to gain passage, in its place the Eagleson Bill was passed as a compromise, which determined that all doctoral education and research functions would be the role of Ohio State, and that Miami University and Ohio University would not offer instruction beyond the master's degree level – an agreement that would remain in place until the 1950s. In 1916, Ohio State was elected into membership in the Association of American Universities.[13] In 1911, president Thompson wrote in a letter, \"the race problem is growing in intensity every year, and I am disposed to doubt the wisdom on the part of the colored people of taking any move that practically forces the doctrine of social equality.\"[14] At the same time, Ohio State \"practiced racial segregation\" that was widespread across the country at the time against Black students, and \"there is no known evidence [Thompson] saw benefits in addressing it\".[14] In 2024, after attempts were made to remove Thompson's statue from the Oval, university spokesperson Ben Johnson stated \"the naming review process is thoughtful and thorough and therefore could take several years\", but the statue has not been removed.[12] With the onset of the Great Depression, Ohio State would face many of the challenges affecting universities throughout America as budget support was slashed, and students without the means of paying tuition returned home to support families. By the mid-1930s, however, enrollment had stabilized due in large part to the role of the Federal Emergency Relief Administration and later the National Youth Administration.[15] By the end of the decade, enrollment had still managed to grow to over 17,500. In 1934, the Ohio State Research Foundation was founded to bring in outside funding for faculty research projects. In 1938, a development office was opened to begin raising funds privately to offset reductions in state support. In 1952, Ohio State founded the interdisciplinary Mershon Center for International Security Studies, which it still houses. The work of this program led to the United States Department of Homeland Security basing the National Academic Consortium for Homeland Security at the university in 2003. Ohio State had an open admissions policy until the late 1980s. Since the early 2000s, the college has raised standards for admission, and been increasingly cited as one of the best public universities in the United States.[16][17][18][19][20][21][22] The main campus in Columbus has grown into the fifth-largest university campus in the United States.[23] On January 12, 2015, OSU claimed the first-ever College Football Playoff National Championship by defeating Oregon 42–20.[24][25][26] On June 22, 2022, the United States Patent and Trademark Office granted the university a trademark on the word \"the\" in relation to clothing, such as T-shirts, baseball caps and hats distributed and/or sold through athletic or collegiate channels.[27][28] Ohio State and its fans, in particular those of its athletics program, frequently emphasize the word \"THE\" when referring to the school.[29] Michael V. Drake became the 15th president of Ohio State in 2014.[30] In 2020, Kristina M. Johnson took office as the 16th president.[31] And in 2023, Walter E. Carter Jr. took office as the 17th president.[32] Throughout 1969, anti-Vietnam War protest tensions grew on Ohio State's campus. What is now Bricker Hall was occupied by students, but after being told they had \"five minutes to leave, or they'd be arrested\", students departed from the building. In late April 1970, anti-war riots ensued on Ohio State campus, leading to nearly 300 arrests, over 60 injuries, and seven gunshot wounds.[33] Students began \"boycotting classes with a student strike, protesting the university's rejection of a list of demands presented the week before. Specific demands included adding black and women's studies to the university's courses.\" On April 29, 1970, five days before the Kent State shootings, students picketed buildings, but this initially peaceful protest \"started to spiral out of control\" after Ohio State Highway Patrol troopers arrived in riot gear. When a man was assaulted by three students, tear gas was deployed, in response to which protesters threw rocks at the National Guard. Seven students were struck with a shotgun blast near the Student Union. There were no casualties, and the shooter was not identified. The Ohio State University abuse scandal centered on allegations of sexual abuse that occurred between 1978 and 1998, while Richard Strauss was employed as a physician by Ohio State University (OSU) in the Athletics Department and in the Student Health Center. An independent investigation into the allegations was announced in April 2018 and was conducted by the law firm Perkins Coie. In July 2018, several former wrestlers accused former head coach Russ Hellickson and U.S. representative Jim Jordan, who was an assistant coach at OSU between 1987 and 1994, of knowing about Strauss's alleged abuse but failing to take action to stop it. Jordan has denied that he had any student-athlete report sexual abuse to him. The report, released in May 2019, concluded that Strauss abused at least 177 male student-patients and that OSU was aware of the abuse as early as 1979, but the abuse was not widely known outside of athletics or student health until 1996, when he was suspended from his duties. Strauss continued to abuse OSU students at an off-campus clinic until his retirement from the university in 1998. OSU was faulted in the report for failing to report Strauss's conduct to law enforcement. On November 28, 2016, a terrorist vehicle-ramming and stabbing attack occurred at 9:52 a.m. EST at Ohio State University's Watts Hall in Columbus, Ohio. The attacker, Somali refugee Abdul Razak Ali Artan, was shot and killed by the first responding OSU police officer, and 13 people were hospitalized for injuries. A series of protests at Ohio State University by pro-Palestinian demonstrators occurred on-campus in response to the Israel-Palestine conflict beginning on October 7, 2023. A solidarity encampment was constructed on OSU's South Oval on April 25, 2024, during which there were at least 36 arrests,[36] making for the largest en masse arrests on campus since the 1969–1970 Vietnam War protests.[37] The protester demands of OSU include \"financial divestment, academic boycott, financial disclosure, acknowledging the genocide, and ending targeted policing\".[38] Pro-Palestinian groups have been critical of the university's responses to the protests, which have included allowing state troopers to aim long-range rifles at students during the dispersal of the Gaza Solidarity Encampment,[39] suspending a pro-Palestinian student organization,[40] and suppressing the Undergraduate Student Government's attempts at passing legislation for financial divestment from Israel after receiving pressure from officials in Zionist organization Hillel International.[41] Ohio State's 1,764-acre (7.14 km2) main campus is about 2.5 miles (4.0 km) north of Columbus' downtown. The historical center of campus is the Oval, a quad of about 11 acres (4.5 ha).[43] The original campus was laid out in the English country style with University Hall overlooking what would become the Oval. From 1905 to 1913, the Olmsted brothers, who had designed New York City's Central Park, were contracted as architectural consultants. Under their leadership, a more formal landscape plan was created with its center axis through the Oval. This axis shifted the university's street grid 12.25 degrees from the City of Columbus' street grid. Construction of the main library in 1915 reinforced this grid shift.[44] Ohio State's research library system has a combined collection of over 5.8 million volumes. Along with 21 libraries on its Columbus campus, the university has eight branches at off-campus research facilities and regional campuses, and a book storage depository near campus. In all, the Ohio State library system encompasses 55 branches and specialty collections. Some more significant collections include the Byrd Polar Research Center Archival Program, which has the archives of Admiral Richard E. Byrd and other polar research materials; the Hilandar Research Library, which has the world's largest collection of medieval Slavic manuscripts on microform; the Ohio State Cartoon Library & Museum, the world's largest repository of original cartoons; the Lawrence and Lee Theatre Research Institute; and the archives of Senator John Glenn. Anchoring the traditional campus gateway at the eastern end of the Oval is the 1989 Wexner Center for the Arts. Designed by architects Peter Eisenman of New York and Richard Trott of Columbus, the center was funded in large part by Ohio State alumnus Les Wexner's gift of $25 million in the 1980s. The center was founded to encompass all aspects of visual and performing arts with a focus on new commissions and artist residencies. Part of its design was to pay tribute to the armory that formerly had the same location. Its groundbreaking deconstructivist architecture has resulted in it being lauded as one of the most important buildings of its generation. Its design has also been criticized as proving less than ideal for many of the art installations it has attempted to display. The centerpiece of the Wexner Center's permanent collection is Picasso's Nude on a Black Armchair, which was purchased by Wexner at auction for $45 million.[citation needed] To the south of the Oval is another, somewhat smaller expanse of green space commonly referred to as the South Oval. At its eastern end, it is anchored by the Ohio Union. To the west are Hale Hall, the Kuhn Honors House, Browning Amphitheatre (a traditional stone Greek theatre) and Mirror Lake. Knowlton Hall, dedicated in October 2004, is at the corner of West Woodruff Avenue and Tuttle Park Place, next to Ohio Stadium. Knowlton Hall along with the Fisher College of Business and Hitchcock Hall form an academic nucleus in the northwestern corner of North campus. Knowlton Hall was designed by Atlanta-based Mack Scogin Merrill Elam along with WSA Studio from Columbus. The Hall is home to the KSA Café, the disciplines of architecture, landscape architecture, city and regional planning, and about 550 undergraduate and graduate students. Knowlton Hall stands out from the general reddish-brown brick of Ohio State's campus with distinctive white marble tiles that cover the building's exterior. This unique wall cladding was requested by Austin E. Knowlton, the namesake of and main patron to the creation of Knowlton Hall. Knowlton also requested that five white marble columns be erected on the site, each column representing one of the classical orders of architecture.[45] The Ohio State College of Medicine is on the southern edge of the central campus. It is home to the James Cancer Hospital, a cancer research institute and one of the National Cancer Institute's 41 comprehensive cancer centers, along with the Richard M. Ross Heart Hospital, a research institute for cardiovascular disease. The campus is served by the Campus Area Bus Service. The university also operates regional campuses in five areas: Ohio State is considered a selective public university.[47] Undergraduate admissions selectivity to Ohio State is rated as 91/99 by The Princeton Review (meaning \"highly selective\")[48] and \"more selective\" by U.S. News & World Report;[49] according to the data, it is the most selective for any public university in the state of Ohio. The New York Times classifies Ohio State as a \"highly selective public college\".[47] For the Class of 2025 (enrolled fall 2021), Ohio State received 58,180 applications and accepted 33,269 (57.2%). Of those accepted, 8,423 enrolled, a yield rate (the percentage of accepted students who choose to attend the university) of 25.3%. OSU's freshman retention rate is 93.9%, with 88% going on to graduate within six years.[46] Of the 21% of the incoming freshman class who submitted SAT scores; the middle 50 percent Composite scores were 1260–1420.[50][46] Of the 64% of enrolled freshmen in 2021 who submitted ACT scores, the middle 50 percent Composite score was between 26 and 32.[46][51][52] In the 2020–2021 academic year, 26 freshman students were National Merit Scholars.[53][54] The Public Ivies: America's Flagship Public Universities (2000) by Howard and Matthew Greene listed Ohio State as one of a select number of public universities offering the highest educational quality.[17] In its 2023 edition, U.S. News & World Report ranked Ohio State as tied for 43rd among all national universities. They ranked the college's political science, audiology, sociology, speech–language pathology, finance, accounting, public affairs, nursing, social work, healthcare administration and pharmacy programs as among the top 20 programs in the country.[49] The Academic Ranking of World Universities placed Ohio State 39-51 nationally and 101–150 globally for 2023. In its 2024 rankings, Times Higher Education World University Rankings ranked it tied for 99th in the world. In 2024, QS World University Rankings ranked the university 151st in the world.[70] The Washington Monthly college rankings, which seek to evaluate colleges' contributions to American society based on factors of social mobility, research and service to the country by their graduates, placed Ohio State 61st among national universities in 2023.[71] In 1916, Ohio State became the first university in Ohio to be extended membership into the Association of American Universities, and remains the only public university in Ohio among the organization's 60 members. Ohio State is also the only public university in Ohio to be classified among \"R1: Doctoral Universities – Highest Research Activity\" and have its undergraduate admissions classified as \"more selective\".[73] Ohio State's political science program is ranked among the top programs globally. Considered to be one of the leading departments in the United States, it has played a particularly significant role in the construction and development of the constructivist and realist schools of international relations.[18][74] In 2004, it was ranked as first among public institutions and fourth overall in the world by British political scientist Simon Hix at the London School of Economics and Political Science,[75][76] while a 2007 study in the academic journal PS: Political Science & Politics ranked it ninth in the United States.[18] It is a leading producer of Fulbright Scholars.[77] Bloomberg Businessweek ranked the undergraduate business program at Ohio State's Fisher College of Business as the 14th best in the nation in its 2016 rankings.[78] The Ohio State linguistics department was recently ranked among the top 10 programs nationally, and top 20 internationally by QS World University Rankings.[79] The college is the only school in North America that offers an ABET-accredited welding engineering undergraduate degree.[80][81] The National Science Foundation ranked Ohio State University 12th among American universities for research and development expenditures in 2021 with $1.23 billion.[82][83] In a 2007 report released by the National Science Foundation, Ohio State's research expenditures for 2006 were $652 million, placing it seventh among public universities and 11th overall, also ranking third among all American universities for private industry-sponsored research. Research expenditures at Ohio State were $864 million in 2017. In 2006, Ohio State announced it would designate at least $110 million of its research efforts toward what it termed \"fundamental concerns\" such as research toward a cure for cancer, renewable energy sources and sustainable drinking water supplies.[84] In 2021, President Kristina M. Johnson announced the university would invest at least $750 million over the next 10 years toward research and researchers.[85] This was announced in conjunction with Ohio State's new Innovation District, which will be an interdisciplinary research facility and act as a hub for healthcare and technology research, serving Ohio State faculty and students as well as public and private partners.[86] Construction of the facility was completed in 2023, as one of the first buildings in the District.[87] Research facilities include Aeronautical/Astronautical Research Laboratory, Byrd Polar Research Center, Center for Automotive Research, (OSU CAR), Chadwick Arboretum, Biomedical Research Tower, Biological Sciences Building, CDME, Comprehensive Cancer Center, David Heart and Lung Research Institute, Electroscience Laboratory, Large Binocular Telescope (LBT, originally named the Columbus Project), Mershon Center for International Security Studies, Museum of Biological Diversity, National Center for the Middle Market, Stone Laboratory on Gibraltar Island, Center for Urban and Regional Analysis and Ohio Agricultural Research and Development Center. Ohio State was among the first group[88] of four public universities to raise a $1 billion endowment when it passed the $1 billion mark in 1999. At the end of 2005, Ohio State's endowment stood at $1.73 billion, ranking it seventh among public universities and 27th among all American universities.[89] In June 2006, the endowment passed the $2 billion mark. In recent decades, and in response to continually shrinking state funding, Ohio State has conducted two significant multi-year fundraising campaigns. The first concluded in 1987 and raised $460 million, a record at the time for a public university. The \"Affirm Thy Friendship Campaign\" took place between 1995 and 2000. With an initial goal of raising $850 million, the campaign's final tally was $1.23 billion, placing Ohio State among the small group of public universities to have successfully conducted a $1 billion campaign.[90] At his welcoming ceremony, returning President E. Gordon Gee announced in the fall of 2007 that Ohio State would launch a $2.5 billion fundraising campaign. In 2019, celebrating the university's 150th year, President Michael V. Drake announced the \"Time and Change Campaign\"[91] with a goal of raising $4.5 billion from 1 million individual donors.[92] The Office of Student Life has partnership affiliations with the Schottenstein Center, the Blackwell Inn and the Drake Events Center. Services supporting student wellness include the Wilce Student Health Center, named for university physician John Wilce, the Mary A. Daniels Student Wellness Center and the Counseling and Consultation Service. The RPAC is the main recreational facility on campus. The Wellness Center within the RPAC offers services such as nutrition counseling, financial coaching, HIV and STI testing, sexual assault services, and alcohol and other drug education.[93] Ohio State's \"Buckeye Bullet\" electric car broke the world record for the fastest speed by an electric vehicle on October 3, 2004, with a maximum speed of 271.737 mph (437.318 km/h) at the Bonneville Salt Flats in Utah.[94] The vehicle also holds the U.S. record for fastest electric vehicle with a speed of 314.958 mph (506.876 km/h), and peak timed mile speed of 321.834 mph (517.942 km/h). A team of engineering students from the university's \"Center for Automotive Research-Intelligent Transportation\" (CAR-IT) designed, built and managed the vehicle. In 2007, Buckeye Bullet 2 was launched. This follow-up effort was a collaboration between Ohio State engineering students and engineers from the Ford Motor Company and will seek to break the land speed record for hydrogen cell powered vehicles.[95] In June 2018, Ohio State dissolved its Sexual Civility and Empowerment unit and eliminated four positions in the unit due to concerns about mismanagement and a lack of support for survivors of sexual assault.[97] This occurred after the unit was suspended in February 2018 and following an external review.[98] The Columbus Dispatch and the school newspaper, The Lantern, reported that \"[SCE] failed to properly report students' sexual-assault complaints\" and that some victims were told that they were \"'lying', 'delusional', 'suffering from mental illness', 'have an active imagination', that they 'didn't understand their own experience', and also 'fabricated their story'\".[99][100] With help from the Philadelphia law firm Cozen O'Connor, the university will be creating[when?] a new framework to handle sexual assault cases and reevaluating its Title IX program. On July 20, 2018, BBC News reported that over 100 male students, including athletes from 14 sports, had reported sexual misconduct by a deceased university team physician, Richard Strauss.[101] The reports dated back to 1978, and included claims that he groped and took nude photographs of his patients. Four former wrestlers filed a lawsuit against Ohio State for ignoring complaints of \"rampant sexual misconduct\" by Strauss. U.S. representative Jim Jordan was named in the lawsuit and has since denied the former wrestlers' claims that he knew about the abuse while he was an assistant coach for eight years at the university.[102][better source needed] In May 2020, the university entered into a settlement and agreed to pay $40.9 million to the sexual abuse survivors.[103] The Ohio Union was the first student union built by an American public university.[72] It is dedicated to the enrichment of the student experience, on and off the university campus. The first Ohio Union, on the south edge of the South Oval, was constructed in 1909 and was later renamed Enarson Hall. The second Ohio Union was completed in 1950 and was prominently along High Street, southeast of the Oval. It was a center of student life for more than 50 years, providing facilities for student activities, organizations and events, and serving as an important meeting place for campus and community interaction. The union also housed many student services and programs, along with dining and recreational facilities. The second Ohio Union was demolished in February 2007 to make way for the new Ohio Union, which was finished in 2010. During this time, student activities were relocated to Ohio Stadium and other academic buildings.[104] The university has over 1,000 student organizations; intercollegiate, club and recreational sports programs; student media organizations and publications, fraternities and sororities; and three student governments. Student organizations at Ohio State provide students with opportunities to get involved in a wide variety of interest areas including academic, social, religious, artistic, service-based, diversity and many more. There are over 1,000 registered student organizations that involve many thousands of students.[105] The university's forensics team has won the state National Forensics Association tournament several times.[106] Block \"O\" is currently the largest student-run organization on the campus of Ohio State. With over 2,400 annual members, Block \"O\" serves as the official student cheering section at athletic events for the university. According to the Student Organization Office in the Ohio Union, Agricultural Education Society is the oldest student organization on campus. The Men's Glee Club often disputes the claim, but after consultation with Ohio Union Staff, Agricultural Education Society was named as the university's oldest organization. Each year, students may sign up to participate in BuckeyeThon, Ohio State's student-led philanthropy. The organization hosts events throughout the year to support the hematology/oncology/bone marrow transplant unit[107] at Nationwide Children's Hospital in Columbus.[108] Each February, thousands of students and community members attend BuckeyeThon's signature event, a Dance Marathon consisting of two separate 12-hour shifts. In the past 15 years, students have raised over $5 million to support treatment, research, and various therapies at the hospital.[109] Unique to BuckeyeThon is the use of an operational fund separate from the main philanthropic cancer fund. As a registered non-profit, BuckeyeThon is subject to university audit and issues gift receipts through the Foundation.[110] Ohio State has several student-managed publications and media outlets. The Makio is the official yearbook.[111] The Makio's sales plummeted by 60% during the early 1970s; the organization went bankrupt and stopped publication during the late 1970s. The book was revived from 1985 to 1994 and again in 2000, thanks to several student organizations. The Lantern is the school's daily newspaper and has operated as a laboratory newspaper[clarification needed] in the School of Communication (formerly the School of Journalism) since 1881. Mosaic is a literary magazine published by Ohio State, which features undergraduate fiction, poetry and art. The Sundial is a student-written and -published humor magazine. Founded in 1911, it is one of the oldest humor magazines in the country, but has not been published without large interruptions.[112][113] Ohio State has two improvisational comedy groups that regularly perform around campus and across the U.S.[114][115] There are two student-run radio stations: AROUSE, the music station, is home to over 100 student DJs, streaming music and independent content,[116] and Scarlet and Gray Sports Radio.[117] Students also operate a local cable TV channel known as Buckeye TV, which airs primarily on the campus closed cable system operated by the Office of the Chief Information Officer (OCIO). At the Ohio State University, three recognized student governments represent their constituents.[118] Ohio State operates 41 on-campus residence halls divided into three geographic clusters: South Campus (site of the university's original dormitories), North Campus (largely constructed during the post-war enrollment boom) and West Campus (\"The Towers\").[119] The residence hall system has 40 smaller living and learning environments defined by social or academic considerations. Separate housing for graduate and professional students is maintained on the Southern tier of campus within the Gateway Residential Complex and the William H. Hall Student Residential Complex. Family housing is maintained at Buckeye Village at the far northern edge of campus beyond the athletic complex. Student Life University Housing also administers student residential housing on the OSU Newark, OSU Mansfield and OSU Agricultural Technical Institute (ATI) campuses. The Residence Hall Advisory Council (RHAC), which is a representative body of all students living in the university's residence halls, helps evaluate and improve the living conditions of the residence halls.[120] Ohio State's intercollegiate sports teams are called the \"Buckeyes\" (derived from the colloquial term for people from the state of Ohio and after the state tree, the Ohio Buckeye, Aesculus glabra),[121] and participate in the NCAA's Division I in all sports (Division I FBS in football) and the Big Ten Conference in most sports. (The women's hockey program competes in the Western Collegiate Hockey Association.) The school colors are scarlet and gray. Brutus Buckeye is the mascot. Ohio State currently has 36 varsity teams. As of 2017, the football program is valued at $1.5 billion, the highest valuation of any such program in the country.[122] The team's rivalry against the University of Michigan has been termed as one of the greatest in North American sports.[123] Ohio State is one of six universities – the University of Michigan, the University of Florida, Stanford University, UCLA and the University of California at Berkeley being the others – to have won national championships in all three major men's sports (baseball, basketball and football).[124] Ohio State is also one of only two universities to appear in the national championship games in both football and men's basketball in the same calendar year (the other being the University of Florida). Ohio State has also won national championships in wrestling, men's volleyball, men's swimming and diving, men's outdoor track and field, men's golf, men's gymnastics, men's fencing, women's rowing, co-ed fencing and multiple synchronized swimming championships.[125] The Ohio State equestrian team has won eight Intercollegiate Horse Show Association national championships.[126] Since the inception of the Athletic Director's Cup, Ohio State has finished in the top 25 each year, including top-six finishes in three of the last five years.[127] During the 2005–2006 school year, Ohio State became the first Big Ten team to win conference championships in football, men's basketball and women's basketball. Ohio State repeated the feat during the 2006–2007 school year, winning solo championships in all three sports. In 2007, Sports Illustrated nicknamed Ohio State's athletic program as being \"The Program\" due to the unsurpassed facilities, an unparalleled number of men's and women's sports teams and their success, and the financial support of an impressive fan base.[128] The Ohio State University Marching Band is famous for \"Script Ohio\", during which the band marches single-file through the curves of the word \"Ohio\", much like a pen writes the word, all while playing the French march \"Le Regiment de Sambre et Meuse\".[129] \"Across the Field\", a fight song used by teams of all sports, has been played at events since 1915.[130] \"Buckeye Battle Cry\", the second fight song which was first performed in 1928, is played as the marching band enters via the Ohio Stadium ramp.[131] Ohio State operates a public television station, WOSU-TV (virtual channel 34/DT 16, a local PBS TV station), as well as two public radio stations, WOSU-FM 89.7(NPR/BBC news/talk) and WOSA-FM 101.1 (classical, \"Classical 101\") in Columbus. Ohio State has 580,000 living alumni around the world.[132] Past and present students and faculty include 5 Nobel Prize laureates, nine Rhodes Scholars, seven Churchill Scholars, 64 Goldwater scholars, one Fields Medalist and seven Pulitzer Prize winners, as well as Vice President-elect JD Vance, seven U.S. Senators, 15 U.S. Representatives and 104 Olympic medalists.[133][134][135] Also included are UFC champions, Medal of Honor recipients, ambassadors, Fortune 500 CEOs and members of the Forbes 400 list of the world's wealthiest individuals. Numerous graduates have gone on to become U.S. governors, senators and members of Congress. Ohio State alumni have appeared on the cover of Time magazine 12 times, with the artwork of alumnus Roy Lichtenstein featured on an additional two Time covers. George Steinbrenner, former owner of the New York Yankees who won seven World Series with the team, earned his master's degree from Ohio State. Larry Sanger, one of the founders of Wikipedia, and Steve May, chief technology officer at Pixar, both graduated from Ohio State. Roboticist James S. Albus was named a \"Hero of US Manufacturing\" by Fortune magazine in 1997.[136] Howard Tucker, who as of April 2023 was the world's oldest living practicing doctor at 100, attended for both his undergraduate work and medical school.[137] Ohio State alumni have been inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame in Cooperstown, New York, the NFL Hall of Fame and the Basketball Hall of Fame. Its athletes have won a combined 83 Olympic medals and three times have received the Sullivan Award as the nation's top amateur athlete. As of 2008, Ohio State's faculty included 21 members of the National Academy of Sciences or National Academy of Engineering, four members of the Institute of Medicine[138] and 177 elected fellows of the American Association for the Advancement of Science. In 2009, 17 Ohio State faculty members were elected as AAAS Fellows. Each year since 2002, Ohio State has either led or been second among all American universities in the number of their faculty members elected as fellows to the AAAS.[139][140] In surveys conducted in 2005 and 2006 by the Collaborative on Academic Careers in Higher Education (COACHE), Ohio State was rated as \"exemplary\" in four of the seven measured aspects of workplace satisfaction for junior faculty members at 31 universities: overall tenure practices, policy effectiveness, compensation and work-family balance.[141] 40°00′00″N 83°00′45″W﻿ / ﻿40.0000°N 83.0125°W﻿ / 40.0000; -83.0125",

                "content": "An earthquake – also called a quake, tremor, or temblor – is the shaking of the Earth's surface resulting from a sudden release of energy in the lithosphere that creates seismic waves. Earthquakes can range in intensity, from those so weak they cannot be felt, to those violent enough to propel objects and people into the air, damage critical infrastructure, and wreak destruction across entire cities. The seismic activity of an area is the frequency, type, and size of earthquakes experienced over a particular time. The seismicity at a particular location in the Earth is the average rate of seismic energy release per unit volume. In its most general sense, the word earthquake is used to describe any seismic event that generates seismic waves. Earthquakes can occur naturally or be induced by human activities, such as mining, fracking, and nuclear tests. The initial point of rupture is called the hypocenter or focus, while the ground level directly above it is the epicenter. Earthquakes are primarily caused by geological faults, but also by volcanic activity, landslides, and other seismic events. The frequency, type, and size of earthquakes in an area define its seismic activity, reflecting the average rate of seismic energy release. Significant historical earthquakes include the 1556 Shaanxi earthquake in China, with over 830,000 fatalities, and the 1960 Valdivia earthquake in Chile, the largest ever recorded at 9.5 magnitude. Earthquakes result in various effects, such as ground shaking and soil liquefaction, leading to significant damage and loss of life. When the epicenter of a large earthquake is located offshore, the seabed may be displaced sufficiently to cause a tsunami. Earthquakes can trigger landslides. Earthquakes' occurrence is influenced by tectonic movements along faults, including normal, reverse (thrust), and strike-slip faults, with energy release and rupture dynamics governed by the elastic-rebound theory. Efforts to manage earthquake risks involve prediction, forecasting, and preparedness, including seismic retrofitting and earthquake engineering to design structures that withstand shaking. The cultural impact of earthquakes spans myths, religious beliefs, and modern media, reflecting their profound influence on human societies. Similar seismic phenomena, known as marsquakes and moonquakes, have been observed on other celestial bodies, indicating the universality of such events beyond Earth. An earthquake is the shaking of the surface of Earth resulting from a sudden release of energy in the lithosphere that creates seismic waves. Earthquakes may also be referred to as quakes, tremors, or temblors. The word tremor is also used for non-earthquake seismic rumbling. In its most general sense, an earthquake is any seismic event—whether natural or caused by humans—that generates seismic waves. Earthquakes are caused mostly by the rupture of geological faults but also by other events such as volcanic activity, landslides, mine blasts, fracking and nuclear tests. An earthquake's point of initial rupture is called its hypocenter or focus. The epicenter is the point at ground level directly above the hypocenter. The seismic activity of an area is the frequency, type, and size of earthquakes experienced over a particular time. The seismicity at a particular location in the Earth is the average rate of seismic energy release per unit volume. One of the most devastating earthquakes in recorded history was the 1556 Shaanxi earthquake, which occurred on 23 January 1556 in Shaanxi, China. More than 830,000 people died.[2] Most houses in the area were yaodongs—dwellings carved out of loess hillsides—and many victims were killed when these structures collapsed. The 1976 Tangshan earthquake, which killed between 240,000 and 655,000 people, was the deadliest of the 20th century.[3] The 1960 Chilean earthquake is the largest earthquake that has been measured on a seismograph, reaching 9.5 magnitude on 22 May 1960.[4][5] Its epicenter was near Cañete, Chile. The energy released was approximately twice that of the next most powerful earthquake, the Good Friday earthquake (27 March 1964), which was centered in Prince William Sound, Alaska.[6][7] The ten largest recorded earthquakes have all been megathrust earthquakes; however, of these ten, only the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake is simultaneously one of the deadliest earthquakes in history. Earthquakes that caused the greatest loss of life, while powerful, were deadly because of their proximity to either heavily populated areas or the ocean, where earthquakes often create tsunamis that can devastate communities thousands of kilometers away. Regions most at risk for great loss of life include those where earthquakes are relatively rare but powerful, and poor regions with lax, unenforced, or nonexistent seismic building codes. Tectonic earthquakes occur anywhere on the earth where there is sufficient stored elastic strain energy to drive fracture propagation along a fault plane. The sides of a fault move past each other smoothly and aseismically only if there are no irregularities or asperities along the fault surface that increases the frictional resistance. Most fault surfaces do have such asperities, which leads to a form of stick-slip behavior. Once the fault has locked, continued relative motion between the plates leads to increasing stress and, therefore, stored strain energy in the volume around the fault surface. This continues until the stress has risen sufficiently to break through the asperity, suddenly allowing sliding over the locked portion of the fault, releasing the stored energy.[8] This energy is released as a combination of radiated elastic strain seismic waves,[9] frictional heating of the fault surface, and cracking of the rock, thus causing an earthquake. This process of gradual build-up of strain and stress punctuated by occasional sudden earthquake failure is referred to as the elastic-rebound theory. It is estimated that only 10 percent or less of an earthquake's total energy is radiated as seismic energy. Most of the earthquake's energy is used to power the earthquake fracture growth or is converted into heat generated by friction. Therefore, earthquakes lower the Earth's available elastic potential energy and raise its temperature, though these changes are negligible compared to the conductive and convective flow of heat out from the Earth's deep interior.[10] There are three main types of fault, all of which may cause an interplate earthquake: normal, reverse (thrust), and strike-slip. Normal and reverse faulting are examples of dip-slip, where the displacement along the fault is in the direction of dip and where movement on them involves a vertical component. Many earthquakes are caused by movement on faults that have components of both dip-slip and strike-slip; this is known as oblique slip. The topmost, brittle part of the Earth's crust, and the cool slabs of the tectonic plates that are descending into the hot mantle, are the only parts of our planet that can store elastic energy and release it in fault ruptures. Rocks hotter than about 300 °C (572 °F) flow in response to stress; they do not rupture in earthquakes.[11][12] The maximum observed lengths of ruptures and mapped faults (which may break in a single rupture) are approximately 1,000 km (620 mi). Examples are the earthquakes in Alaska (1957), Chile (1960), and Sumatra (2004), all in subduction zones. The longest earthquake ruptures on strike-slip faults, like the San Andreas Fault (1857, 1906), the North Anatolian Fault in Turkey (1939), and the Denali Fault in Alaska (2002), are about half to one third as long as the lengths along subducting plate margins, and those along normal faults are even shorter. Normal faults occur mainly in areas where the crust is being extended such as a divergent boundary. Earthquakes associated with normal faults are generally less than magnitude 7. Maximum magnitudes along many normal faults are even more limited because many of them are located along spreading centers, as in Iceland, where the thickness of the brittle layer is only about six kilometres (3.7 mi).[13][14] Reverse faults occur in areas where the crust is being shortened such as at a convergent boundary. Reverse faults, particularly those along convergent boundaries, are associated with the most powerful earthquakes (called megathrust earthquakes) including almost all of those of magnitude 8 or more. Megathrust earthquakes are responsible for about 90% of the total seismic moment released worldwide.[15] Strike-slip faults are steep structures where the two sides of the fault slip horizontally past each other; transform boundaries are a particular type of strike-slip fault. Strike-slip faults, particularly continental transforms, can produce major earthquakes up to about magnitude 8. Strike-slip faults tend to be oriented near vertically, resulting in an approximate width of 10 km (6.2 mi) within the brittle crust.[16] Thus, earthquakes with magnitudes much larger than 8 are not possible. In addition, there exists a hierarchy of stress levels in the three fault types. Thrust faults are generated by the highest, strike-slip by intermediate, and normal faults by the lowest stress levels.[17] This can easily be understood by considering the direction of the greatest principal stress, the direction of the force that \"pushes\" the rock mass during the faulting. In the case of normal faults, the rock mass is pushed down in a vertical direction, thus the pushing force (greatest principal stress) equals the weight of the rock mass itself. In the case of thrusting, the rock mass \"escapes\" in the direction of the least principal stress, namely upward, lifting the rock mass, and thus, the overburden equals the least principal stress. Strike-slip faulting is intermediate between the other two types described above. This difference in stress regime in the three faulting environments can contribute to differences in stress drop during faulting, which contributes to differences in the radiated energy, regardless of fault dimensions. For every unit increase in magnitude, there is a roughly thirty-fold increase in the energy released. For instance, an earthquake of magnitude 6.0 releases approximately 32 times more energy than a 5.0 magnitude earthquake and a 7.0 magnitude earthquake releases 1,000 times more energy than a 5.0 magnitude earthquake. An 8.6-magnitude earthquake releases the same amount of energy as 10,000 atomic bombs of the size used in World War II.[18] This is so because the energy released in an earthquake, and thus its magnitude, is proportional to the area of the fault that ruptures[19] and the stress drop. Therefore, the longer the length and the wider the width of the faulted area, the larger the resulting magnitude. The most important parameter controlling the maximum earthquake magnitude on a fault, however, is not the maximum available length, but the available width because the latter varies by a factor of 20. Along converging plate margins, the dip angle of the rupture plane is very shallow, typically about 10 degrees.[20] Thus, the width of the plane within the top brittle crust of the Earth can reach 50–100 km (31–62 mi) (such as in Japan, 2011, or in Alaska, 1964), making the most powerful earthquakes possible. The majority of tectonic earthquakes originate in the Ring of Fire at depths not exceeding tens of kilometers. Earthquakes occurring at a depth of less than 70 km (43 mi) are classified as \"shallow-focus\" earthquakes, while those with a focal depth between 70 and 300 km (43 and 186 mi) are commonly termed \"mid-focus\" or \"intermediate-depth\" earthquakes. In subduction zones, where older and colder oceanic crust descends beneath another tectonic plate, deep-focus earthquakes may occur at much greater depths (ranging from 300 to 700 km (190 to 430 mi)).[21] These seismically active areas of subduction are known as Wadati–Benioff zones. Deep-focus earthquakes occur at a depth where the subducted lithosphere should no longer be brittle, due to the high temperature and pressure. A possible mechanism for the generation of deep-focus earthquakes is faulting caused by olivine undergoing a phase transition into a spinel structure.[22] Earthquakes often occur in volcanic regions and are caused there, both by tectonic faults and the movement of magma in volcanoes. Such earthquakes can serve as an early warning of volcanic eruptions, as during the 1980 eruption of Mount St. Helens.[23] Earthquake swarms can serve as markers for the location of the flowing magma throughout the volcanoes. These swarms can be recorded by seismometers and tiltmeters (a device that measures ground slope) and used as sensors to predict imminent or upcoming eruptions.[24] A tectonic earthquake begins as an area of initial slip on the fault surface that forms the focus. Once the rupture has been initiated, it begins to propagate away from the focus, spreading out along the fault surface. Lateral propagation will continue until either the rupture reaches a barrier, such as the end of a fault segment, or a region on the fault where there is insufficient stress to allow continued rupture. For larger earthquakes, the depth extent of rupture will be constrained downwards by the brittle-ductile transition zone and upwards by the ground surface. The mechanics of this process are poorly understood because it is difficult either to recreate such rapid movements in a laboratory or to record seismic waves close to a nucleation zone due to strong ground motion.[25] In most cases, the rupture speed approaches, but does not exceed, the shear wave (S wave) velocity of the surrounding rock. There are a few exceptions to this: Supershear earthquake ruptures are known to have propagated at speeds greater than the S wave velocity. These have so far all been observed during large strike-slip events. The unusually wide zone of damage caused by the 2001 Kunlun earthquake has been attributed to the effects of the sonic boom developed in such earthquakes. Slow earthquake ruptures travel at unusually low velocities. A particularly dangerous form of slow earthquake is the tsunami earthquake, observed where the relatively low felt intensities, caused by the slow propagation speed of some great earthquakes, fail to alert the population of the neighboring coast, as in the 1896 Sanriku earthquake.[25] During an earthquake, high temperatures can develop at the fault plane, increasing pore pressure and consequently vaporization of the groundwater already contained within the rock.[27][28][29] In the coseismic phase, such an increase can significantly affect slip evolution and speed, in the post-seismic phase it can control the Aftershock sequence because, after the main event, pore pressure increase slowly propagates into the surrounding fracture network.[30][29] From the point of view of the Mohr-Coulomb strength theory, an increase in fluid pressure reduces the normal stress acting on the fault plane that holds it in place, and fluids can exert a lubricating effect. As thermal overpressurization may provide positive feedback between slip and strength fall at the fault plane, a common opinion is that it may enhance the faulting process instability. After the mainshock, the pressure gradient between the fault plane and the neighboring rock causes a fluid flow that increases pore pressure in the surrounding fracture networks; such an increase may trigger new faulting processes by reactivating adjacent faults, giving rise to aftershocks.[30][29] Analogously, artificial pore pressure increase, by fluid injection in Earth's crust, may induce seismicity. Tides may trigger some seismicity. Most earthquakes form part of a sequence, related to each other in terms of location and time.[31] Most earthquake clusters consist of small tremors that cause little to no damage, but there is a theory that earthquakes can recur in a regular pattern.[32] Earthquake clustering has been observed, for example, in Parkfield, California where a long-term research study is being conducted around the Parkfield earthquake cluster.[33] An aftershock is an earthquake that occurs after a previous earthquake, the mainshock. Rapid changes of stress between rocks, and the stress from the original earthquake are the main causes of these aftershocks,[34] along with the crust around the ruptured fault plane as it adjusts to the effects of the mainshock.[31] An aftershock is in the same region as the main shock but always of a smaller magnitude, however, they can still be powerful enough to cause even more damage to buildings that were already previously damaged from the mainshock.[34] If an aftershock is larger than the mainshock, the aftershock is redesignated as the mainshock and the original main shock is redesignated as a foreshock. Aftershocks are formed as the crust around the displaced fault plane adjusts to the effects of the mainshock.[31] Earthquake swarms are sequences of earthquakes striking in a specific area within a short period. They are different from earthquakes followed by a series of aftershocks by the fact that no single earthquake in the sequence is the main shock, so none has a notably higher magnitude than another. An example of an earthquake swarm is the 2004 activity at Yellowstone National Park.[35] In August 2012, a swarm of earthquakes shook Southern California's Imperial Valley, showing the most recorded activity in the area since the 1970s.[36] Sometimes a series of earthquakes occur in what has been called an earthquake storm, where the earthquakes strike a fault in clusters, each triggered by the shaking or stress redistribution of the previous earthquakes. Similar to aftershocks but on adjacent segments of fault, these storms occur over the course of years, with some of the later earthquakes as damaging as the early ones. Such a pattern was observed in the sequence of about a dozen earthquakes that struck the North Anatolian Fault in Turkey in the 20th century and has been inferred for older anomalous clusters of large earthquakes in the Middle East.[37][38] It is estimated that around 500,000 earthquakes occur each year, detectable with current instrumentation. About 100,000 of these can be felt.[4][5] Minor earthquakes occur very frequently around the world in places like California and Alaska in the U.S., as well as in El Salvador, Mexico, Guatemala, Chile, Peru, Indonesia, the Philippines, Iran, Pakistan, the Azores in Portugal, Turkey, New Zealand, Greece, Italy, India, Nepal, and Japan.[40] Larger earthquakes occur less frequently, the relationship being exponential; for example, roughly ten times as many earthquakes larger than magnitude 4 occur than earthquakes larger than magnitude 5.[41] In the (low seismicity) United Kingdom, for example, it has been calculated that the average recurrences are: an earthquake of 3.7–4.6 every year, an earthquake of 4.7–5.5 every 10 years, and an earthquake of 5.6 or larger every 100 years.[42] This is an example of the Gutenberg–Richter law. The number of seismic stations has increased from about 350 in 1931 to many thousands today. As a result, many more earthquakes are reported than in the past, but this is because of the vast improvement in instrumentation, rather than an increase in the number of earthquakes. The United States Geological Survey (USGS) estimates that, since 1900, there have been an average of 18 major earthquakes (magnitude 7.0–7.9) and one great earthquake (magnitude 8.0 or greater) per year, and that this average has been relatively stable.[43] In recent years, the number of major earthquakes per year has decreased, though this is probably a statistical fluctuation rather than a systematic trend.[44] More detailed statistics on the size and frequency of earthquakes is available from the United States Geological Survey.[45] A recent increase in the number of major earthquakes has been noted, which could be explained by a cyclical pattern of periods of intense tectonic activity, interspersed with longer periods of low intensity. However, accurate recordings of earthquakes only began in the early 1900s, so it is too early to categorically state that this is the case.[46] Most of the world's earthquakes (90%, and 81% of the largest) take place in the 40,000-kilometre-long (25,000 mi), horseshoe-shaped zone called the circum-Pacific seismic belt, known as the Pacific Ring of Fire, which for the most part bounds the Pacific plate.[47][48] Massive earthquakes tend to occur along other plate boundaries too, such as along the Himalayan Mountains.[49] With the rapid growth of mega-cities such as Mexico City, Tokyo, and Tehran in areas of high seismic risk, some seismologists are warning that a single earthquake may claim the lives of up to three million people.[50] While most earthquakes are caused by the movement of the Earth's tectonic plates, human activity can also produce earthquakes. Activities both above ground and below may change the stresses and strains on the crust, including building reservoirs, extracting resources such as coal or oil, and injecting fluids underground for waste disposal or fracking.[51] Most of these earthquakes have small magnitudes. The 5.7 magnitude 2011 Oklahoma earthquake is thought to have been caused by disposing wastewater from oil production into injection wells,[52] and studies point to the state's oil industry as the cause of other earthquakes in the past century.[53] A Columbia University paper suggested that the 8.0 magnitude 2008 Sichuan earthquake was induced by loading from the Zipingpu Dam,[54] though the link has not been conclusively proved.[55] The instrumental scales used to describe the size of an earthquake began with the Richter scale in the 1930s. It is a relatively simple measurement of an event's amplitude, and its use has become minimal in the 21st century. Seismic waves travel through the Earth's interior and can be recorded by seismometers at great distances. The surface-wave magnitude was developed in the 1950s as a means to measure remote earthquakes and to improve the accuracy for larger events. The moment magnitude scale not only measures the amplitude of the shock but also takes into account the seismic moment (total rupture area, average slip of the fault, and rigidity of the rock). The Japan Meteorological Agency seismic intensity scale, the Medvedev–Sponheuer–Karnik scale, and the Mercalli intensity scale are based on the observed effects and are related to the intensity of shaking. The shaking of the earth is a common phenomenon that has been experienced by humans from the earliest of times. Before the development of strong-motion accelerometers, the intensity of a seismic event was estimated based on the observed effects. Magnitude and intensity are not directly related and calculated using different methods. The magnitude of an earthquake is a single value that describes the size of the earthquake at its source. Intensity is the measure of shaking at different locations around the earthquake. Intensity values vary from place to place, depending on the distance from the earthquake and the underlying rock or soil makeup.[56] The first scale for measuring earthquake magnitudes was developed by Charles Francis Richter in 1935. Subsequent scales (seismic magnitude scales) have retained a key feature, where each unit represents a ten-fold difference in the amplitude of the ground shaking and a 32-fold difference in energy. Subsequent scales are also adjusted to have approximately the same numeric value within the limits of the scale.[57] Although the mass media commonly reports earthquake magnitudes as \"Richter magnitude\" or \"Richter scale\", standard practice by most seismological authorities is to express an earthquake's strength on the moment magnitude scale, which is based on the actual energy released by an earthquake, the static seismic moment.[58][59] Every earthquake produces different types of seismic waves, which travel through rock with different velocities: Propagation velocity of the seismic waves through solid rock ranges from approx. 3 km/s (1.9 mi/s) up to 13 km/s (8.1 mi/s), depending on the density and elasticity of the medium. In the Earth's interior, the shock- or P waves travel much faster than the S waves (approx. relation 1.7:1). The differences in travel time from the epicenter to the observatory are a measure of the distance and can be used to image both sources of earthquakes and structures within the Earth. Also, the depth of the hypocenter can be computed roughly. P wave speed S waves speed As a consequence, the first waves of a distant earthquake arrive at an observatory via the Earth's mantle. On average, the kilometer distance to the earthquake is the number of seconds between the P- and S wave times 8.[60] Slight deviations are caused by inhomogeneities of subsurface structure. By such analysis of seismograms, the Earth's core was located in 1913 by Beno Gutenberg. S waves and later arriving surface waves do most of the damage compared to P waves. P waves squeeze and expand the material in the same direction they are traveling, whereas S waves shake the ground up and down and back and forth.[61] Earthquakes are not only categorized by their magnitude but also by the place where they occur. The world is divided into 754 Flinn–Engdahl regions (F-E regions), which are based on political and geographical boundaries as well as seismic activity. More active zones are divided into smaller F-E regions whereas less active zones belong to larger F-E regions. Standard reporting of earthquakes includes its magnitude, date and time of occurrence, geographic coordinates of its epicenter, depth of the epicenter, geographical region, distances to population centers, location uncertainty, several parameters that are included in USGS earthquake reports (number of stations reporting, number of observations, etc.), and a unique event ID.[62] Although relatively slow seismic waves have traditionally been used to detect earthquakes, scientists realized in 2016 that gravitational measurement could provide instantaneous detection of earthquakes, and confirmed this by analyzing gravitational records associated with the 2011 Tohoku-Oki (\"Fukushima\") earthquake.[63][64] The effects of earthquakes include, but are not limited to, the following: Shaking and ground rupture are the main effects created by earthquakes, principally resulting in more or less severe damage to buildings and other rigid structures. The severity of the local effects depends on the complex combination of the earthquake magnitude, the distance from the epicenter, and the local geological and geomorphological conditions, which may amplify or reduce wave propagation.[65] The ground-shaking is measured by ground acceleration. Specific local geological, geomorphological, and geostructural features can induce high levels of shaking on the ground surface even from low-intensity earthquakes. This effect is called site or local amplification. It is principally due to the transfer of the seismic motion from hard deep soils to soft superficial soils and the effects of seismic energy focalization owing to the typical geometrical setting of such deposits. Ground rupture is a visible breaking and displacement of the Earth's surface along the trace of the fault, which may be of the order of several meters in the case of major earthquakes. Ground rupture is a major risk for large engineering structures such as dams, bridges, and nuclear power stations and requires careful mapping of existing faults to identify any that are likely to break the ground surface within the life of the structure.[66] Soil liquefaction occurs when, because of the shaking, water-saturated granular material (such as sand) temporarily loses its strength and transforms from a solid to a liquid. Soil liquefaction may cause rigid structures, like buildings and bridges, to tilt or sink into the liquefied deposits. For example, in the 1964 Alaska earthquake, soil liquefaction caused many buildings to sink into the ground, eventually collapsing upon themselves.[67] Physical damage from an earthquake will vary depending on the intensity of shaking in a given area and the type of population. Underserved and developing communities frequently experience more severe impacts (and longer lasting) from a seismic event compared to well-developed communities.[68] Impacts may include: With these impacts and others, the aftermath may bring disease, a lack of basic necessities, mental consequences such as panic attacks and depression to survivors,[69] and higher insurance premiums. Recovery times will vary based on the level of damage and the socioeconomic status of the impacted community. Earthquakes can produce slope instability leading to landslides, a major geological hazard. Landslide danger may persist while emergency personnel is attempting rescue work.[70] Earthquakes can cause fires by damaging electrical power or gas lines. In the event of water mains rupturing and a loss of pressure, it may also become difficult to stop the spread of a fire once it has started. For example, more deaths in the 1906 San Francisco earthquake were caused by fire than by the earthquake itself.[71] Tsunamis are long-wavelength, long-period sea waves produced by the sudden or abrupt movement of large volumes of water—including when an earthquake occurs at sea. In the open ocean, the distance between wave crests can surpass 100 kilometres (62 mi), and the wave periods can vary from five minutes to one hour. Such tsunamis travel 600–800 kilometers per hour (373–497 miles per hour), depending on water depth. Large waves produced by an earthquake or a submarine landslide can overrun nearby coastal areas in a matter of minutes. Tsunamis can also travel thousands of kilometers across open ocean and wreak destruction on far shores hours after the earthquake that generated them.[72] Ordinarily, subduction earthquakes under magnitude 7.5 do not cause tsunamis, although some instances of this have been recorded. Most destructive tsunamis are caused by earthquakes of magnitude 7.5 or more.[72] Floods may be secondary effects of earthquakes if dams are damaged. Earthquakes may cause landslips to dam rivers, which collapse and cause floods.[73] The terrain below the Sarez Lake in Tajikistan is in danger of catastrophic flooding if the landslide dam formed by the earthquake, known as the Usoi Dam, were to fail during a future earthquake. Impact projections suggest the flood could affect roughly five million people.[74] Earthquake prediction is a branch of the science of seismology concerned with the specification of the time, location, and magnitude of future earthquakes within stated limits.[75] Many methods have been developed for predicting the time and place in which earthquakes will occur. Despite considerable research efforts by seismologists, scientifically reproducible predictions cannot yet be made to a specific day or month.[76] Popular belief holds earthquakes are preceded by earthquake weather, in the early morning.[77][78] While forecasting is usually considered to be a type of prediction, earthquake forecasting is often differentiated from earthquake prediction. Earthquake forecasting is concerned with the probabilistic assessment of general earthquake hazards, including the frequency and magnitude of damaging earthquakes in a given area over years or decades.[79] For well-understood faults the probability that a segment may rupture during the next few decades can be estimated.[80][81] Earthquake warning systems have been developed that can provide regional notification of an earthquake in progress, but before the ground surface has begun to move, potentially allowing people within the system's range to seek shelter before the earthquake's impact is felt. The objective of earthquake engineering is to foresee the impact of earthquakes on buildings, bridges, tunnels, roadways, and other structures, and to design such structures to minimize the risk of damage. Existing structures can be modified by seismic retrofitting to improve their resistance to earthquakes. Earthquake insurance can provide building owners with financial protection against losses resulting from earthquakes. Emergency management strategies can be employed by a government or organization to mitigate risks and prepare for consequences. Artificial intelligence may help to assess buildings and plan precautionary operations. The Igor expert system is part of a mobile laboratory that supports the procedures leading to the seismic assessment of masonry buildings and the planning of retrofitting operations on them. It has been applied to assess buildings in Lisbon, Rhodes, and Naples.[82] Individuals can also take preparedness steps like securing water heaters and heavy items that could injure someone, locating shutoffs for utilities, and being educated about what to do when the shaking starts. For areas near large bodies of water, earthquake preparedness encompasses the possibility of a tsunami caused by a large earthquake. From the lifetime of the Greek philosopher Anaxagoras in the 5th century BCE to the 14th century CE, earthquakes were usually attributed to \"air (vapors) in the cavities of the Earth.\"[83] Thales of Miletus (625–547 BCE) was the only documented person who believed that earthquakes were caused by tension between the earth and water.[83] Other theories existed, including the Greek philosopher Anaxamines' (585–526 BCE) beliefs that short incline episodes of dryness and wetness caused seismic activity. The Greek philosopher Democritus (460–371 BCE) blamed water in general for earthquakes.[83] Pliny the Elder called earthquakes \"underground thunderstorms\".[83] In Norse mythology, earthquakes were explained as the violent struggle of the god Loki. When Loki, god of mischief and strife, murdered Baldr, god of beauty and light, he was punished by being bound in a cave with a poisonous serpent placed above his head dripping venom. Loki's wife Sigyn stood by him with a bowl to catch the poison, but whenever she had to empty the bowl, the poison dripped on Loki's face, forcing him to jerk his head away and thrash against his bonds, which caused the earth to tremble.[84] In Greek mythology, Poseidon was the cause and god of earthquakes. When he was in a bad mood, he struck the ground with a trident, causing earthquakes and other calamities. He also used earthquakes to punish and inflict fear upon people as revenge.[85] In Japanese mythology, Namazu (鯰) is a giant catfish who causes earthquakes. Namazu lives in the mud beneath the earth and is guarded by the god Kashima, who restrains the fish with a stone. When Kashima lets his guard fall, Namazu thrashes about, causing violent earthquakes.[86] In the New Testament, Matthew's Gospel refers to earthquakes occurring both after the death of Jesus (Matthew 27:51, 54) and at his resurrection (Matthew 28:2).[87] Earthquakes form part of the picture through which Jesus portrays the beginning of the end of time.[88] In modern popular culture, the portrayal of earthquakes is shaped by the memory of great cities laid waste, such as Kobe in 1995 or San Francisco in 1906.[89] Fictional earthquakes tend to strike suddenly and without warning.[89] For this reason, stories about earthquakes generally begin with the disaster and focus on its immediate aftermath, as in Short Walk to Daylight (1972), The Ragged Edge (1968) or Aftershock: Earthquake in New York (1999).[89] A notable example is Heinrich von Kleist's classic novella, The Earthquake in Chile, which describes the destruction of Santiago in 1647. Haruki Murakami's short fiction collection After the Quake depicts the consequences of the Kobe earthquake of 1995. The most popular single earthquake in fiction is the hypothetical \"Big One\" expected of California's San Andreas Fault someday, as depicted in the novels Richter 10 (1996), Goodbye California (1977), 2012 (2009), and San Andreas (2015), among other works.[89] Jacob M. Appel's widely anthologized short story, A Comparative Seismology, features a con artist who convinces an elderly woman that an apocalyptic earthquake is imminent.[90] Contemporary depictions of earthquakes in film are variable in the manner in which they reflect human psychological reactions to the actual trauma that can be caused to directly afflicted families and their loved ones.[91] Disaster mental health response research emphasizes the need to be aware of the different roles of loss of family and key community members, loss of home and familiar surroundings, and loss of essential supplies and services to maintain survival.[92][93] Particularly for children, the clear availability of caregiving adults who can protect, nourish, and clothe them in the aftermath of the earthquake and help them make sense of what has befallen them is more important to their emotional and physical health than the simple giving of provisions.[94] As was observed after other disasters involving destruction and loss of life and their media depictions, recently observed in the 2010 Haiti earthquake, it is also believed to be important not to pathologize the reactions to loss and displacement or disruption of governmental administration and services, but rather to validate the reactions to support constructive problem-solving and reflection.[95] Phenomena similar to earthquakes have been observed on other planets (e.g., marsquakes on Mars) and on the Moon (e.g., moonquakes).",

                "content": "Our editors will review what you’ve submitted and determine whether to revise the article. Over the centuries, earthquakes have been responsible for millions of deaths and an incalculable amount of damage to property. Depending on their intensity, earthquakes (specifically, the degree to which they cause the ground’s surface to shake) can topple buildings and bridges, rupture gas pipelines and other infrastructure, and trigger landslides, tsunamis, and volcanoes. These phenomena are primarily responsible for deaths and injuries. Very great earthquakes occur on average about once per year. Earthquake waves, more commonly known as seismic waves, are vibrations generated by an earthquake and propagated within Earth or along its surface. There are four principal types of elastic waves: two, primary and secondary waves, travel within Earth, whereas the other two, Rayleigh and Love waves, called surface waves, travel along its surface. In addition, seismic waves can be produced artificially by explosions. Magnitude is a measure of the amplitude (height) of the seismic waves an earthquake’s source produces as recorded by seismographs. Seismologist Charles F. Richter created an earthquake magnitude scale using the logarithm of the largest seismic wave’s amplitude to base 10. Richter’s scale was originally for measuring the magnitude of earthquakes from magnitudes 3 to 7, limiting its usefulness. Today the moment magnitude scale, a closer measure of an earthquake’s total energy release, is preferred. Earthquakes can occur anywhere, but they occur mainly along fault lines (planar or curved fractures in the rocks of Earth’s crust), where compressional or tensional forces move rocks on opposite sides of a fracture. Faults extend from a few centimetres to many hundreds of kilometres. In addition, most of the world’s earthquakes occur within the Ring of Fire, a long horseshoe-shaped belt of earthquake epicentres, volcanoes, and tectonic plate boundaries fringing the Pacific basin. earthquake, any sudden shaking of the ground caused by the passage of seismic waves through Earth’s rocks. Seismic waves are produced when some form of energy stored in Earth’s crust is suddenly released, usually when masses of rock straining against one another suddenly fracture and “slip.” Earthquakes occur most often along geologic faults, narrow zones where rock masses move in relation to one another. The major fault lines of the world are located at the fringes of the huge tectonic plates that make up Earth’s crust. (See the table of major earthquakes.) Little was understood about earthquakes until the emergence of seismology at the beginning of the 20th century. Seismology, which involves the scientific study of all aspects of earthquakes, has yielded answers to such long-standing questions as why and how earthquakes occur. About 50,000 earthquakes large enough to be noticed without the aid of instruments occur annually over the entire Earth. Of these, approximately 100 are of sufficient size to produce substantial damage if their centres are near areas of habitation. Very great earthquakes occur on average about once per year. Over the centuries they have been responsible for millions of deaths and an incalculable amount of damage to property. Earth’s major earthquakes occur mainly in belts coinciding with the margins of tectonic plates. This has long been apparent from early catalogs of felt earthquakes and is even more readily discernible in modern seismicity maps, which show instrumentally determined epicentres. The most important earthquake belt is the Circum-Pacific Belt, which affects many populated coastal regions around the Pacific Ocean—for example, those of New Zealand, New Guinea, Japan, the Aleutian Islands, Alaska, and the western coasts of North and South America. It is estimated that 80 percent of the energy presently released in earthquakes comes from those whose epicentres are in this belt. The seismic activity is by no means uniform throughout the belt, and there are a number of branches at various points. Because at many places the Circum-Pacific Belt is associated with volcanic activity, it has been popularly dubbed the “Pacific Ring of Fire.” A second belt, known as the Alpide Belt, passes through the Mediterranean region eastward through Asia and joins the Circum-Pacific Belt in the East Indies. The energy released in earthquakes from this belt is about 15 percent of the world total. There also are striking connected belts of seismic activity, mainly along oceanic ridges—including those in the Arctic Ocean, the Atlantic Ocean, and the western Indian Ocean—and along the rift valleys of East Africa. This global seismicity distribution is best understood in terms of its plate tectonic setting. Earthquakes are caused by the sudden release of energy within some limited region of the rocks of the Earth. The energy can be released by elastic strain, gravity, chemical reactions, or even the motion of massive bodies. Of all these the release of elastic strain is the most important cause, because this form of energy is the only kind that can be stored in sufficient quantity in the Earth to produce major disturbances. Earthquakes associated with this type of energy release are called tectonic earthquakes.",

Latest Earthquakes | Chat Share Social Media Originally written by Lisa Wald (U.S. Geological Survey) for “The Green Frog News” An earthquake is what happens when two blocks of the earth suddenly slip past one another. The surface where they slip is called the fault or fault plane. The location below the earth’s surface where the earthquake starts is called the hypocenter, and the location directly above it on the surface of the earth is called the epicenter. Sometimes an earthquake has foreshocks. These are smaller earthquakes that happen in the same place as the larger earthquake that follows. Scientists can’t tell that an earthquake is a foreshock until the larger earthquake happens. The largest, main earthquake is called the mainshock. Mainshocks always have aftershocks that follow. These are smaller earthquakes that occur afterwards in the same place as the mainshock. Depending on the size of the mainshock, aftershocks can continue for weeks, months, and even years after the mainshock! The earth has four major layers: the inner core, outer core, mantle and crust. The crust and the top of the mantle make up a thin skin on the surface of our planet. But this skin is not all in one piece – it is made up of many pieces like a puzzle covering the surface of the earth. Not only that, but these puzzle pieces keep slowly moving around, sliding past one another and bumping into each other. We call these puzzle pieces tectonic plates, and the edges of the plates are called the plate boundaries. The plate boundaries are made up of many faults, and most of the earthquakes around the world occur on these faults. Since the edges of the plates are rough, they get stuck while the rest of the plate keeps moving. Finally, when the plate has moved far enough, the edges unstick on one of the faults and there is an earthquake. While the edges of faults are stuck together, and the rest of the block is moving, the energy that would normally cause the blocks to slide past one another is being stored up. When the force of the moving blocks finally overcomes the friction of the jagged edges of the fault and it unsticks, all that stored up energy is released. The energy radiates outward from the fault in all directions in the form of seismic waves like ripples on a pond. The seismic waves shake the earth as they move through it, and when the waves reach the earth’s surface, they shake the ground and anything on it, like our houses and us! Earthquakes are recorded by instruments called seismographs. The recording they make is called a seismogram. The seismograph has a base that sets firmly in the ground, and a heavy weight that hangs free. When an earthquake causes the ground to shake, the base of the seismograph shakes too, but the hanging weight does not. Instead the spring or string that it is hanging from absorbs all the movement. The difference in position between the shaking part of the seismograph and the motionless part is what is recorded. The size of an earthquake depends on the size of the fault and the amount of slip on the fault, but that’s not something scientists can simply measure with a measuring tape since faults are many kilometers deep beneath the earth’s surface. So how do they measure an earthquake? They use the seismogram recordings made on the seismographs at the surface of the earth to determine how large the earthquake was (figure 5). A short wiggly line that doesn’t wiggle very much means a small earthquake, and a long wiggly line that wiggles a lot means a large earthquake. The length of the wiggle depends on the size of the fault, and the size of the wiggle depends on the amount of slip. The size of the earthquake is called its magnitude. There is one magnitude for each earthquake. Scientists also talk about theintensity of shaking from an earthquake, and this varies depending on where you are during the earthquake. Seismograms come in handy for locating earthquakes too, and being able to see the P wave and the S wave is important. You learned how P & S waves each shake the ground in different ways as they travel through it. P waves are also faster than S waves, and this fact is what allows us to tell where an earthquake was. To understand how this works, let’s compare P and S waves to lightning and thunder. Light travels faster than sound, so during a thunderstorm you will first see the lightning and then you will hear the thunder. If you are close to the lightning, the thunder will boom right after the lightning, but if you are far away from the lightning, you can count several seconds before you hear the thunder. The further you are from the storm, the longer it will take between the lightning and the thunder. P waves are like the lightning, and S waves are like the thunder. The P waves travel faster and shake the ground where you are first. Then the S waves follow and shake the ground also. If you are close to the earthquake, the P and S wave will come one right after the other, but if you are far away, there will be more time between the two. By looking at the amount of time between the P and S wave on a seismogram recorded on a seismograph, scientists can tell how far away the earthquake was from that location. However, they can’t tell in what direction from the seismograph the earthquake was, only how far away it was. If they draw a circle on a map around the station where the radius of the circle is the determined distance to the earthquake, they know the earthquake lies somewhere on the circle. But where? Scientists then use a method called triangulation to determine exactly where the earthquake was (see image below). It is called triangulation because a triangle has three sides, and it takes three seismographs to locate an earthquake. If you draw a circle on a map around three different seismographs where the radius of each is the distance from that station to the earthquake, the intersection of those three circles is the epicenter! No, and it is unlikely they will ever be able to predict them. Scientists have tried many different ways of predicting earthquakes, but none have been successful. On any particular fault, scientists know there will be another earthquake sometime in the future, but they have no way of telling when it will happen. These are two questions that do not yet have definite answers. If weather does affect earthquake occurrence, or if some animals or people can tell when an earthquake is coming, we do not yet understand how it works. Children's Privacy Policy",

                "content": "Archibald Charles Manning[2] (born April 27, 2005) is an American football quarterback for the Texas Longhorns. He is a member of the Manning family. Manning played high school football at Isidore Newman School in New Orleans. In his freshman year, Manning was the varsity starter at quarterback, the first freshman quarterback to start Newman's season opener in at least 40 years.[3] He shined in his debut, leading Newman to a 26-point victory.[4] In the final game of the season against Dunham, Manning threw for only 71 yards on 20 attempts and 10 completions. They would lose, 22–20.[5] Manning completed his freshman season with 2,509 yards and 34 touchdowns, earning MaxPreps National Freshman of the Year honors.[6] Manning opened his sophomore season by having six touchdowns against East Jefferson.[7] On October 15, 2020, he made his national television debut in a game against Booker T. Washington, throwing for two touchdowns and rushing for two more.[8] In a game where Newman beat Cohen, 76–0, Manning passed for 169 yards and five touchdowns in the first quarter of action before being pulled from the game.[9] In the first round of the Division III playoffs, Newman received a bye and played Catholic - N.I. in the second round. Manning would throw for 127 yards and a touchdown in the 14–7 win.[10] In the final game of the season in the semifinals, Manning completed less than 50 percent of his passes and threw an interception to lose to Lafayette Christian Academy, 21–7.[11] Manning was again named the starting quarterback for Newman for his junior season in 2021. In Newman's first game against Vandebilt Catholic, Manning passed for 258 yards and accounted for all four touchdowns in the 28-point shutout victory.[12] Weeks later, Manning went a perfect 11-of-11 for 179 yards and five total touchdowns in the first half of their 70–0 win over Fisher.[13] Manning had another perfect night against Cohen, going 9-of-9 for 153 yards and five passing touchdowns in the 34-point shutout win.[14] In the second round of the playoffs, Manning played Episcopal and threw for 164 yards and accounted for three touchdowns in the 37–6 win.[15] The following week, Lafayette Christian would blow out Newman, 49–7. In 2021, Manning threw for 1,841 yards, 26 touchdowns, and four interceptions while having six rushing touchdowns. Manning was the captain of the Newman football team for his senior season in 2022. In their matchup against Pearl River, Manning threw for 356 yards and seven touchdowns in a 59–7 victory, breaking his uncle Eli's Newman record of 7,268 career passing yards and his uncle Peyton's Newman record of 93 career touchdowns.[16] To avoid a media frenzy, Manning's family withheld him from media interviews and also declined premature college scholarship offers. He ran a private account on Instagram, allowing only friends and coaches to follow him, including Ole Miss head coach Lane Kiffin. \"They've shut down everything,\" said one member of the local media, \"but the attention is going to come.\"[2] In his college search he visited SMU, Clemson, LSU,[17] Alabama, Texas,[18] Georgia,[19] and Virginia,[20] as well as Ole Miss, his grandfather's, father's, and uncle's former team.[21][22] On December 21, 2022, Manning signed a letter of intent to play for the University of Texas and committed on June 23, 2022; only then did he make his account public.[23][24] After playing in the spring game for Team Orange, Manning was named the team's third-string quarterback behind Quinn Ewers and Maalik Murphy.[25] Manning made his collegiate debut on November 24, during the third quarter of a blowout win against Texas Tech, completing 2-of-5 passing attempts for 30 yards.[26] After the season, Manning was redshirted.[27] Manning made his 2024 season debut against Colorado State when he entered the game in relief of Ewers during the third quarter while the Longhorns had a 38–0 lead. Manning finished with five completions for 95 yards and a touchdown. He also added a rushing touchdown.[28] Against UTSA, Ewers left with an abdominal injury in the second quarter forcing Manning to come into the game with a 14–0 lead. On his first play of the game, Manning threw a 19-yard touchdown to DeAndre Moore. Two plays later, he rushed for a 67-yard touchdown to put the Longhorns ahead 28–7. After Manning threw a 75-yard strike to freshman wide receiver Ryan Wingo to go up 42–7, he added another passing touchdown in the fourth quarter to go up 49–7 before being relieved by freshman Trey Owens. Manning finished the game with 223 passing yards, 53 rushing yards, and five total touchdowns (four passing, one rushing) as Texas blew out UTSA, 56–7.[29][30] On September 19, head coach Steve Sarkisian announced that Manning would be the starting quarterback the following week against Louisiana–Monroe.[31] This announcement came after Manning shared the title of SEC Freshman of the Week with Texas A&M quarterback Marcel Reed for Week 3.[32] He was also named Earl Campbell Tyler Rose Award National Player of the Week and was tabbed to the Davey O'Brien Award Great 8 list.[33][34] A member of the Manning family, he is the oldest son of Cooper Manning, himself the eldest son of Archie Manning, and nephew to Cooper's NFL quarterback brothers, Peyton and Eli.[36] His younger brother, Heid, was the center for the football team and played lacrosse at Isidore Newman School.[37]",

                "content": "Editions: En/ncaa Controversy surrounds a key moment in the Texas Longhorns' victory over Ohio State, sparking debate about officiating fairness. The Texas Longhorns' star quarterback, Arch Manning, is at the center of a heated debate following a crucial play during their dramatic win against Ohio State. Fans and analysts alike are questioning whether a favorable call from the referees tipped the scales in Texas' favor during a pivotal moment late in the game. With just under two minutes left in the fourth quarter, Texas was trailing by three points and faced a critical third-and-long situation. Manning, hailed as one of college football's brightest stars, scrambled under pressure before releasing a deep pass. The play resulted in a controversial pass interference flag against Ohio State's cornerback, giving Texas a fresh set of downs and setting up their game-winning touchdown. Related: Replays show minimal contact between the defender and Texas' receiver, leading to widespread claims that the referees may have been overly generous with the call. \"It looked like clean coverage to me,\" said one former referee during a post-game analysis. \"That's a call you don't make unless it's egregious, and in this case, it wasn't.\" The Ohio State coaching staff also voiced their concerns during the post-game press conference. \"We play hard, clean football, and we expect the same standard from officiating,\" said head coach Ryan Day. \"It's disappointing to see a game of this magnitude influenced by questionable decisions.\" Despite the controversy, Manning remained poised in his post-game interviews, choosing to focus on his team's performance rather than the officiating. \"We played our hearts out and stayed resilient through all four quarters,\" Manning said. \"That's what matters most.\" The 20-year-old quarterback, who carries the weight of his family's storied football legacy, continues to shine in his freshman season. Manning has consistently delivered clutch performances, leading Texas to an impressive 9-1 record so far this year. The play has reignited discussions about the need for more consistent officiating in college football, with some calling for additional reviews for judgment calls like pass interference. Others argue that controversial moments like these are simply part of the game. As Texas prepares for its next matchup, the spotlight will remain on Arch Manning and the Longhorns. Whether the call was fair or not, Texas' dramatic win has solidified their position as serious playoff contenders this season. © Unidad Editorial Información Deportiva, S.L.U. All rights reserved.

                "title": "Year 1 of Arch Manning - The frustrations and lessons the QB encountered at Texas - ESPN",
                "content": "NEW ORLEANS -- As soon as Arch Manning made his way toward the metal benches lining the sideline inside the Superdome for Texas media day, one cameraman gave an unintentional signal to the gathered media when he said simply, \"Let's go!\" Immediately, as soon as Manning took his seat, a group of reporters circled him, lined up three deep to hear what the true freshman had to say about his first year at Texas. The scene had Manning ask lightheartedly, \"I don't see y'all giving this attention to the other backups.\" The other backups are not named Manning. But neither are the starters, and the truth is, nobody gave that much attention to them, either. Many sat at their own podiums or tables across the football field with a smattering of reporters nearby. At one point, starting quarterback Quinn Ewers sat alone at his podium, turning behind him to see the scrum of reporters surrounding Manning. Down the sideline, co-offensive coordinator and quarterbacks coach AJ Milwee turned to the other assistants near him to watch the scene unfold, hardly surprised. Manning arrived at Texas in January as not only one of the highest-rated recruits in the country but certainly the most famous one -- his name synonymous with quarterback greatness. He had done zero interviews in the year since he had made the decision to come to Texas, as the No. 2 overall prospect in the ESPN 300 in 2022. So naturally, inquiring minds had to know ... well, everything. At first, Manning looked at the assembled group with surprise, unsure whether he was allowed to answer questions. But media day for the College Football Playoff at the Allstate Sugar Bowl meant every player was available for interviews, including him. So Manning spoke for about 40 minutes and gave mostly stock answers about being the backup QB against Washington (\"I've been preparing like I'm the starter); the role his uncles Peyton and Eli have played (\"They don't overstep. Whenever I want advice, I can go to them\"); and how great it felt to be back home in New Orleans (\"It feels good to be back.\") He was guarded but friendly, following a mantra drilled into him going back to his prep days: \"My grandfather always likes to say in interviews less is best.\" But there was one brief moment when Arch let down his guard, if only for a moment, offering a small window into what this year truly has been like for him. If the outside world had great expectations for him to come in and wrest the starting job from Ewers right away, Manning knew what reality said. Ewers himself arrived at Texas in 2022 with the fanfare reserved for elite quarterback prospects, and he seemed firmly entrenched as QB1. There came lesson No. 1 in the days after enrolling in school. For the first time in his football life, Manning would have to be patient. \"There were a lot of tough days, I'm not going to lie,\" Manning said. \"I was never a backup in high school. So there are some days when you graduate early, you're alone in your dorm room, you're like, just another day of fighting for the third-string job. Some days it's tough. There's hard workouts, hard practices, they expect a lot out of you. I'm glad I went through that to help me grow.\" Milwee said he and coach Steve Sarkisian were strategic in their approach with Manning, making sure to be as honest as possible about what this season would hold for him and to remind him what he was working toward. \"I told him that this is going to be one of the tougher years that you've ever experienced as a football player because it's going to be drastically different than anything you've really ever experienced,\" Milwee said. \"You're working every day so that when that time comes for you, you're ready.\" Manning said he got some advice on staying patient from his uncle Eli, who redshirted his first season at Ole Miss in 1999 and had to wait his turn, too. \"Yeah, you need a lot of patience, especially nowadays,\" Arch Manning said. \"There's a bunch of old quarterbacks around college, so yeah, he's stressed that to me.\" Lesson No. 2 also came in his first days on campus. Manning would never just be another guy on campus no matter how hard he tried. First came the students who asked for pictures on the way to class. But that realization truly hit when Sarkisian FaceTimed him on the second day of class. Manning was sitting in his dorm room when he answered. Sarkisian had Manning's student ID card in his hand. Manning had unknowingly left it behind in English class, and the student who found it dropped it off at the football facility -- but not before taking to social media to let the whole world know Manning had already lost his ID card. Manning sheepishly admitted he lost it a second time. \"I think people that know me just know that I'm a regular guy,\" Manning said. \"I'm not some superhero. I'm just a normal 19-year-old guy just trying to work hard and play football. That's really all it is.\" Lesson No. 3 came in the preparation it would take to one day start at Texas. His teammates and coaches universally say that Manning has no ego. Offensive lineman Christian Jones recalls the first time he had a conversation with Manning, the two were getting breakfast and Manning patted him on the shoulder and told him, \"'I appreciate you coming back. That's a big thing.\" Jones said that stuck with him. \"He's that type of person.\" They also say he works just as hard as everyone else on the team. \"Oh, I know he's going to be a great quarterback. For one, He's got that Manning blood in him. And then for two, he comes in and puts the work in every day,\" said tight end Ja'Tavion Sanders. \"He's not one of those big-headed guys who thinks the world revolves around him. He's a real humble guy.\" That includes in the quarterback room, where Manning and Ewers room together on road trips. While their relationship could have started off in an awkward spot -- ballyhooed freshman looking to push the entrenched starter -- both knew and understood their roles. Manning made sure to ask Ewers a lot of questions. Ewers made sure to help Manning as much as possible. \"We're both really good buddies with each other,\" Ewers said. \"We have the same buddies around this team. You know, we hang out. The quarterbacks, during the season, we go to dinner every Tuesday. So I mean, I'm not lying about how close we really are. We're a super close group and it's rare to see that, especially nowadays in college football.\" As Manning grew as a player, he started to slowly move up the depth chart. He began the season as the scout team quarterback -- and even played Jalen Milroe in practice a few times to give the defense a good look headed into their September game against Alabama. Eventually, he started sharing second-team reps with Maalik Murphy. Finally, his time to see the field came in the regular-season finale against Texas Tech. Texas had built a 50-7 lead when Manning entered. The crowd cheered so loudly that Manning waved his arms to get the fans to pipe down. He did not want his first collegiate snap to be a pre-snap penalty. Of the crowd ovation, Manning said, \"It surprised me because I hadn't really done anything yet.\" Manning ended up leading a touchdown drive. Now comes Lesson No. 4, which is honestly a blend of all his previous learnings. Staying patient, learning how to prepare, understanding the spotlight will always be on him has led him here: back home in New Orleans, with a chance to play for a national championship. Manning enters the game as the backup quarterback behind Ewers and sums up his role this way, \"I've been preparing all year to play. I think when my name is called, I'm going to go out there and be ready to roll.\" Of course, there will be many more questions to answer when this season comes to an end. The first one has already been asked -- if Ewers decides to come back to Texas for one more season, how would Manning feel about waiting one more year to start? \"It's never fun being a backup and sitting, but each person's journey is different, and I'm going to work hard and not blink an eye and help Quinn be the best quarterback he can be and try to get better along the way,\" Manning said. \"It takes some time, but I think it'll be worth it one day.\"",

        "Tesla Model Y Juniper": [
            {
                "title": "Tesla reveals its long-awaited Model Y 'Juniper' refresh, but the EV isn’t the trailblazer it once was | TechRadar",
                "content": "Raft of updates will roll out to global markets in 2025 When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works. Tesla has responded to leaked images of the updated Model Y surfacing on Chinese social media recently by revealing full details of the refreshed EV, which has long been codenamed ‘Juniper’. As with the Model 3 last year, the new Model Y receives a fairly major exterior overhaul, complete with front and rear full-width light bars, as well as a subtle but easily spotted refresh to the front and rear bumpers. The sleeker exterior has improved the vehicle’s drag co-efficiency that, alongside improved sound-proofing, new acoustic glass, greater insulation and the latest casting methods, has reduced the number of body gaps and will lead to a quieter cabin. It will also have a positive effect on battery range. Inside, Tesla has introduced ventilated seats and myriad ambient interior lighting extras to the refreshed Model Y, while the turn signals are now activated via a traditional stalk on Asia-Pacific models, rather than buttons on the steering wheel. However, it is yet to be seen whether the controversial button controls will remain on vehicles that make their way to other markets. There is also a new eight-inch touchscreen in the rear, in addition to the 15.4in touchscreen on the dash, which allows occupants to play games and binge their favorite movies and television while on the move. Currently, only the Rear Wheel Drive (RWD) and Long Range All Wheel Drive (LR AWD) models have received the ‘Juniper’ updates and, as a result, have also received reworked estimated range and acceleration specification. Sign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more. But bear in mind that the WLTP cycle tests are typically more generous in their range estimations than the EPA figures used in North America. The 2025 Long Range AWD model is said to be capable of 551km / 342 miles on a single charge, while 0.7 seconds has been shaved off the 0-60mph sprint time, so it can now manage it in just 4.3 seconds. Tesla claims it also charges slightly faster. A cheaper Rear Wheel Drive model (RWD) is also on offer, which can manage 466km / 289 miles on a single charge and a 0-60mph acceleration time of 5.9 seconds. Customers will likely have to wait for a Long Range RWD model, as well as the top spec Performance versions to arrive. Currently, customers in China can order a Launch Series Model Y in either a RWD or Long Range AWD variant, with the former costing ¥263,500 – or around $36,000 / £29,000 / AU$58,000. The more expensive AWD model costs ¥303,500, which converts to around $41,300 / £33,600 / AU$66,900 at the current exchange rates. There has been no word on European and North America specification and pricing, but with the outgoing Model Y starting at $31,490 in the US and £46,990 in the UK, it is likely to be more expensive than the aging model. Electrek claims the figures equate to a 5% increase on the previous Chinese pricing, for example. It is highly likely that Australia will be the next market to receive the refreshed Model Y, with key European markets likely following soon thereafter. However, current uncertainty around tariffs on Chinese-made vehicles in the US will impact the speed at which the North American market receives refreshed cars. Arguably, the updated model can’t be rolled out fast enough for Tesla, seeing as the company posted its first sales drop since 2011 at its recent Q4 2024 earnings call, according to CNBC. Musk predicted earlier in the year that this would likely happen, citing ageing models as one of the key reasons for slowing sales. The recent refresh of Model 3 has highlighted just how staid Model X and Model Y now look, while the range offered by their respective battery packs, which was once the talk of the EV industry, now lags behind rivals from the Volkswagen Group, Hyundai, Kia and Peugeot. Leon has been navigating a world where automotive and tech collide for almost 20 years, reporting on everything from in-car entertainment to robotised manufacturing plants. Currently, EVs are the focus of his attentions, but give it a few years and it will be electric vertical take-off and landing craft. Outside of work hours, he can be found tinkering with distinctly analogue motorcycles, because electric motors are no replacement for an old Honda inline four. The next big EV trend could be these special-edition E Ink dashboards – and I'm all for it Honda's new Series 0 prototypes suggest it's back on exciting and pioneering EV form Leaked Nvidia RTX 5090 laptop GPU benchmarks are weird - but there's no need to panic TechRadar is part of Future US Inc, an international media group and leading digital publisher.

                "title": "10 Things We Have Learnt About The 2025 Tesla Model Y Juniper",
                "content": "After what seems like an eternity, Tesla has finally taken the cover off its Model Y Juniper update in a true-to-its-nature discrete and under-the-cover nature. The heavily revised EV makes its inaugural appearance via an overnight addition to the brand's Chinese configurator, which is a region where the model performs incredibly well despite aggressive competition from the likes of BYD and the Geely Group. This may look like an all-new model, but there are very few mechanical changes under all of those cosmetic revisions. Tesla has continually stated that it only applies functional updates as it sees fit , which is a strategy that clearly plays in its favor just based on the brand's quarterly sales figure results alone. Official information is yet to be released to the public, but this unofficial launch has taught us some things regarding what we can expect when this product arrives in the U.S. In order to give you the most up-to-date and accurate information possible, the data used to compile this article was sourced from Tesla's websites and other authoritative sources, including Consumer Reports and the EPA. This is the 2025 Tesla Model Y \"Juniper\" update, and it's now on sale in the Asian region before heading to North America. To no one's surprise, the Tesla Model Y Juniper adopts some of the Cybertruck and Robotaxi 's design cues in a bid to elevate the midsize crossover's aesthetic to the brand's updated design language. Initially, many believed that it would adopt some of the Model 3 Highland's refreshed design cues, but this more visually striking approach makes more sense. Fundamental aspects of the redesign include sleek LED lightbars at both the front and rear, with some revisions made to the bumpers. Beyond this, it maintains pretty much the same liftback crossover silhouette, making it almost indistinguishable from the now previous design when looking at the profile. A heightened level of aggression comes in the shape of a more prominent rear diffuser and ducktail spoiler. Another surprising introduction to the Model Y Juniper is the retention of some physical controls in the minimalist interior design , namely a turn signal stork located behind the steering wheel. The Highland introduces turn signal buttons on the wheel, which has generated quite a bit of criticism from existing users. Additional alterations include an ambient light strip that stretches across the cabin's circumference and an entertainment screen for the rear passengers. Tesla also notes that substantial quality improvements were made to its upholstery and trimmings, meaning the new Juniper should hold up a lot better when subjected to extended use. Beyond this, there are not many alterations to note. Black vegan leather remains the standard upholstery option, with the choice to upgrade to the more aesthetically aspirational black and white color scheme . China's configurator only displays a five-seat layout, but we expect the seven-seater option to be available when it arrives in the U.S. We don't have official performance specifications, but the Chinese configurator highlights a 5.9-second 0-62 MPH time for the rear-wheel drive and 4.3-second 0-60 MPH time for the dual-motor configuration, which is noticeably faster than what the existing range achieves. It also quotes a 347-mile range claim for the rear-wheel drive model and 411-mile range for the dual-motor, which gives reason to suggest that the base derivative reintroduces Tesla's smaller 62 kWh LFP battery . For reference, the EPA estimates the current generation model covers between 277 and 337 miles on a single charge, depending on your configuration. There's no information regarding what we can expect from the flagship Performance derivative, as Tesla usually introduces this a few months after the rest of the range. Based on the Highland's strategy and performance improvements for the rest of the range, it's likely that we'll see some improved performance figures. The website highlights that efficiency improvements are one of the most noteworthy changes made to the Juniper range. Tesla's Model Y \"Juniper\" refresh is rumored to bring subtle design updates, new tech features, and possibly even interior upgrades. While some fans are excited for the potential changes, others feel it might not be enough to compete with newer EV rivals that are stepping up in style and features, like the Ford Mustang Mach-E, Rivian R1S, Kia EV6, Audi Q4 e-tron, and others. What do you think? Is the Juniper refresh enough to keep the popular Model Y at the top, or is it time for Tesla to bring something more groundbreaking to the table? The Tesla Model Y has been subject to some noteworthy price increases over the last few months, but it remains a highly competitively priced product , which is one of the main reasons why it continues to outsell its rivals by a monumental margin. Tesla will want to maintain this reputation, so we can expect pricing to remain highly competitive. For reference, the existing range starts at $44,990 for the Long Range Rear-Wheel Drive derivative, followed by the $47,990 Dual-Motor and $51,490 Performance configuration. Some of these models benefit from the $7,500 Inflation Reduction Act tax credit , depending on how you specify it. The Chinese configurator reveals that the Standard Range Rear-Wheel Drive configuration starts at just under $36,000, while the Long-Range Dual-Motor costs a little bit more than $41,300. Optional paints cost a little more than $1,000, which is also what you'll pay for the larger 20-inch wheel option and the aforementioned black-and-white interior upholstery. As we've mentioned, the Chinese market benefits from the new Tesla Model Y Juniper range before anyone else sometime in March. Tesla confirms that it will roll out this product to Australia, Thailand, Philippines, and Hong Kong shortly after. There's no information regarding American and European introductions whatsoever, but we're certain that it will take place very shortly after this. Standard Range RWD Long Range AWD Price PHP 2,369,000 ($40,610) PHP 2,689,000 ($46,095) Powertrain (Rear) Single permanent magnet synchronous motor (Rear) Single permanent magnet synchronous motor (Front) Single permanent magnet synchronous motor Transmission Single-Speed Automatic Horsepower TBA TBA Torque TBA TBA Drivetrain Layout RWD AWD Battery TBA Range (WLTP) 466 km (289 miles) 551 km (342 miles) Fast Charging Time TBA TBA 0-100 KM/H (62 MPH) 5.9 sec. 4.3 sec. Top Speed 124 mph The U.S. in particular has a very strict homologation process, which could explain why it's being introduced to its domestic market at a late date. We're sure that a lot of American Tesla fans are frustrated by the fact that they don't get access to the revised model first. Your changes have been saved Email is sent Email has already been sent Add TopSpeed to your Google News feed. Google News The current Tesla Model Y gets a lot of criticism for its overly firm ride. Tesla's Chinese site clarifies that it has resolved this issue by softening up the front double wishbone and rear multilink suspension without any compromise to the overall handling characteristics. Tesla's new tire and wheel package is certain to improve comfort and handling levels even more. There's no word on any other changes to the Tesla Model Y's suspension configuration. Again, the aforementioned changes are inline with what we saw with the Model 3 Highland option, which resulted in highly preferable comments from both reviewers and owners . These changes are certain to improve the Model Y's quality and reliability ratings. For reference, the 2025 model year currently features a 41/100 predicted reliability and 4/5 predicted owner satisfaction rating from Consumer Reports. The Tesla Model Y is the most successful EV ever, but it's not the most reliable one. If you're planning to buy a new or used one, here's what to know Tesla faces challenges in outselling EVs from BYD and Geely due to the competitive pricing, diverse product offerings, and strong local market dominance of Chinese automakers. BYD and Geely leverage extensive supply chain control, government support, and cost-efficient manufacturing to produce high-quality EVs at lower prices. They also cater to a broader customer base with varied models, from affordable compact cars to premium sedans, providing options Tesla’s limited lineup lacks. These factors allow BYD to consistently outsell Tesla in key markets, including China, which remains the largest EV market globally. Geely’s rapid advancements in EV technology and partnerships, such as Polestar and Zeekr, further solidify its competitive edge. Ford’s CEO, Jim Farley, recently expressed concern over the growing dominance of Chinese EV makers and their ability to disrupt the global market with highly competitive pricing and innovation. Farley highlighted that Chinese manufacturers, led by BYD, have a significant cost advantage, potentially undercutting Western automakers in international markets . This sentiment reflects broader concerns about how the rise of China’s EV industry could reshape the global automotive landscape, challenging established players like Tesla, Ford, and other traditional automakers to adapt or risk losing market share to increasingly aggressive Chinese competitors. The Chinese market gets access to the new Model Y in a choice of five different colors, four of which are $1,000 to $1,600 options. Black is the standard color, but you'll have to pay extra for Pearl White, Glacier Blue, Flame Red, and Quicksilver. Interestingly, Deep Blue and Solid Black are nowhere to be found. Additionally, Tesla introduces a brand new 19-inch black Interactive Storm wheel option as standard with the choice to upgrade to the 20-inch dual-tone Spiral Storm set for $1,000. We're not certain about whether this will replace the existing Gemini and Induction wheel designs applied to the existing model here in the U.S. Tesla's Full-Self Driving technology offers advanced driver-assistance features aimed at enabling autonomous driving, though it remains classified as Level Two autonomy. The system uses Tesla's in-house neural network and relies on a suite of cameras, ultrasonic sensors, and radar to navigate roads, detect hazards, and manage tasks like lane changes, traffic light recognition, and parking. Despite its promise, FSD has faced criticism for inconsistent performance, requiring constant driver supervision and raising safety concerns. Tesla regularly updates its software via over-the-air updates, but these improvements often focus on incremental changes rather than transformative leaps in capability. The upcoming Model Y Juniper update is expected to bring design and interior refreshes, yet it's unlikely to significantly alter FSD functionality. Tesla’s hardware and software limitations, coupled with regulatory hurdles, constrain the system’s progress toward full autonomy. The reliance on vision-based technology without LiDAR , a staple in competitors' systems, further narrows its scope. The Juniper refresh may introduce Hardware 4.0 with enhanced cameras and sensors, but even these updates are unlikely to fundamentally shift FSD's performance. The Tesla Model Y is the best-selling electric SUV in America, and here's why it's been such a revelation since its launch. The Juniper update will increase the Tesla Model Y's global appeal by addressing design, interior, and technological elements that align with consumer expectations in key markets. The exterior refresh is expected to modernize the SUV’s appearance, potentially introducing sleeker headlights, a refined grille, and new aerodynamic wheel designs. These updates can attract buyers in regions where styling plays a significant role in purchasing decisions. Enhanced interior features, such as upgraded materials, a redesigned dashboard, or improved infotainment systems, cater to markets that prioritize comfort and advanced technology. Potential integration of Tesla’s Hardware 4.0, including improved cameras and sensors, could elevate safety and driver-assistance features, appealing to safety-conscious buyers globally. Improved manufacturing efficiency, hinted at in this update, could reduce production costs and allow Tesla to price the Model Y more competitively in regions like Europe and Asia, where affordability is a key factor. Expanding production in localized markets, such as the Berlin Gigafactory, will also reduce delivery times and import tariffs, making the Model Y more accessible. We want to hear from you!

Tesla's breadwinning Model Y is getting some updates, and here's why this matters so much to Tesla as well as its potential customers. 2025 kicks off with a highly attractive lease deal on this compelling EV crossover. This electric SUV demonstrates what a modest take on luxury should look like. Come explore the designs, tech, and safety features of a brand-new EV. Paying homage to Japanese legend \"Drift King\", the Ioniq 5 N DK Edition is heading to the Tokyo Auto Salon. There are lots of reasons to buy a three-year-old hybrid rather than the 2025 model, including depreciation, performance, and the environment.

                "content": "Derrick Deshaun Watson (born September 14, 1995) is an American professional football quarterback for the Cleveland Browns of the National Football League (NFL). He played college football for the Clemson Tigers, leading the team to a national championship in 2016. Watson was selected in the first round of the 2017 NFL draft by the Houston Texans. After having a productive rookie season cut short by injury, Watson guided the Texans to consecutive division titles in 2018 and 2019 and led the league in passing yards in 2020. He also received Pro Bowl honors in each of his three seasons as Houston's primary starter. He is currently tenth in career completion percentage (minimum 1,500 attempts) and is sixth in all-time career passer rating.[1][2] In 2021, Watson was sued by more than two dozen female massage therapists for sexual harassment and sexual assault.[3][4] Watson has denied any wrongdoing while settling 20 claims of sexual misconduct.[5] Disagreements with the Texans' front office, and multiple sexual-misconduct lawsuits, kept Watson out for the entire 2021 season and eventually led to a trade to the Browns in 2022. With Cleveland, Watson signed a five-year contract worth $230 million, one of the largest contracts in NFL history.[6][7] Watson was born in Gainesville, Georgia, on September 14, 1995, to Deann Watson and Don Richardson. He attended Gainesville High School from the fall of 2010 and played for the school's Red Elephants football team.[8] Gainesville head coach Bruce Miller had planned to start a rising junior at quarterback to execute his spread offense, but Watson won the starting spot, becoming Miller's first-ever freshman starting quarterback.[9] During his high-school career, Watson set numerous state records, including those for total yards (17,134), total touchdowns (218), career passing yards (13,077) and career passing touchdowns (155).[10] He rushed for 4,057 yards and 63 touchdowns. Watson excelled in his junior year, winning a state championship and earning accolades such as Junior All-American, 2014 Player to Watch and 2014 Top 100 Recruit.[11] During his sophomore and senior years, Watson led Gainesville to the state semifinals.[12][13] Watson received offers from numerous colleges before verbally committing to Clemson University on February 1, 2012.[14] He was ranked as the top quarterback recruit for the 2014 class by ESPN 300.[11] Watson enrolled at Clemson in January 2014. During his high-school career, Watson had worn #4, but at Clemson, that number had been retired after quarterback Steve Fuller graduated. However, Fuller allowed Watson to wear the number.[15] Watson entered his true freshman season as the backup to starter Cole Stoudt, but still received extensive playing time.[16] Through three games, he completed 29 of 41 passes for 479 yards with four touchdowns and no interceptions, outperforming Stoudt. Watson was named the Tigers' starter on September 21.[17][18] In Watson's first career start against the North Carolina Tar Heels, he set a school record with six touchdown passes and threw for 435 yards en route to a 50–35 victory.[19] On October 11, 2014, Watson broke a bone in his right hand in the first quarter of a game against the Louisville Cardinals.[20][21] As a result of the injury, he missed games against Boston College, Syracuse and Wake Forest. He returned for a game against Georgia Tech only to suffer an LCL strain, missing most of the game.[22] He did not play against Georgia State the following week, but led Clemson to a victory over state rival South Carolina the following week.[23] It was revealed that Watson had played the game with a torn ACL in his left knee.[24] He underwent surgery the Friday before Clemson's bowl game against Oklahoma.[25] In 2015, Watson led Clemson to an undefeated 12–0 regular season and a #1 ranking in the polls.[26] After the regular season, the Tigers qualified for the ACC Championship Game, facing off against #10 North Carolina. Watson threw for 289 yards and three touchdowns and ran for 131 yards and two touchdowns to lead the Tigers to a 45–37 win, Clemson's first ACC championship since 2011.[27] Watson was also named the ACC Championship Game MVP.[28] The Tigers were selected to participate in the 2016 College Football Playoff as the #1 seed. They faced the #4 seed Oklahoma Sooners in the Orange Bowl, one of the two College Football Playoff semifinal games. Watson threw for 189 yards and a touchdown and ran for 145 yards and a touchdown as he led Clemson to a 37–17 victory, earning game MVP honors.[29][30] With the win, the Tigers advanced to the 2016 College Football Playoff National Championship game against the #2 Alabama Crimson Tide, but Clemson lost 45–40. Watson threw for 405 yards and four touchdowns in the game and ran for 73 yards in the losing effort,[31] though he surpassed the 4,000-yard passing mark.[32] He set the record for most total yards in national championship game history, with 478 yards (405 passing / 73 rushing) against the nation's best defense. In addition to throwing for over 4,000 yards, he also rushed for over 1,000 yards to complete his true sophomore season. Watson was the first player to accomplish this feat in the history of college football.[33] For his accomplishments during the 2015 season, Watson was named a finalist for the Heisman Trophy, the first time that a Clemson player had been invited to the Heisman Trophy presentation. He finished third in the balloting after Heisman winner Derrick Henry, an Alabama running back, and Stanford running back Christian McCaffrey.[34] Watson's third-place finish was the highest in Clemson football history. He won the Davey O'Brien Award, which is awarded annually to the top college quarterback.[35] He was also named the 2015 ACC Player of the Year and ACC Offensive Player of the Year.[36][37] Watson started his junior season positively with 248 passing yards, one touchdown, and one interception in a narrow 19–13 victory over the Auburn Tigers.[38] On October 1, Watson threw for 306 passing yards, five touchdowns, and three interceptions in a 42–36 victory over Louisville.[39] He totaled 378 passing yards and two touchdowns against Florida State on October 29, rallying to a 37–34 win.[40] Against Syracuse on November 5, he threw for 169 passing yards with two touchdowns but left the game with an apparent shoulder injury.[41][42] On November 26, he passed for 347 yards, six touchdowns and one interception in a 56–7 victory over South Carolina.[43] In the fall of 2016, Watson became the first player since Jason White in 2003–2004 to win the Davey O'Brien Award in consecutive years. He was also named winner of the Johnny Unitas Golden Arm Award and was the first repeat winner of the Manning Award.[44] For the second consecutive year, Watson was named one of the five Heisman Trophy candidates, along with Michigan's Jabrill Peppers, Oklahoma's Baker Mayfield and Dede Westbrook and Louisville's Lamar Jackson. He again came up short, as Louisville's Lamar Jackson was awarded the Heisman Trophy, finishing with nearly twice as many first-place votes as had Watson.[45][46] After defeating Ohio State 31–0 in the CFP semifinal in the Fiesta Bowl and receiving the offensive MVP award, Clemson defeated No. 1 Alabama 35–31 in the 2017 College Football Playoff National Championship.[47] Watson completed 36 of 56 passes for 420 yards and three touchdowns against the nation's top-ranked defense, including the last-second game-winning pass to wide receiver Hunter Renfrow. He also rushed for 43 yards and a touchdown.[48] The win marked Clemson's second national championship, ending a three-decade national-championship drought. Watson was named the game's offensive MVP.[49] On November 8, 2016, Watson, along with three other Clemson players, Wayne Gallman, Artavis Scott and Mike Williams,[50] declared for the NFL draft.[51] In December, Watson graduated with a degree in communications after three years at Clemson.[52] Watson was projected as a first-round pick by the majority of scouts and analysts. He was ranked as the top quarterback available in the draft by Sports Illustrated, Pro Football Focus and ESPN.[53][54][55] He was ranked the second-best quarterback by NFLDraftScout.com.[56] The Houston Texans drafted Watson in the first round (12th overall) of the 2017 NFL draft.[62] The Texans had acquired the pick from the Cleveland Browns, trading their 25th overall pick in the 2017 NFL Draft and their first round pick in the 2018 NFL draft. Houston had already traded quarterback Brock Osweiler to Cleveland for draft picks earlier that year as part of what was widely considered the NFL's first major \"salary dump.\" Watson was the third quarterback taken in the draft behind Mitchell Trubisky, who went second overall to the Chicago Bears, and Patrick Mahomes, who went tenth overall to the Kansas City Chiefs.[63][64][65][66] On May 12, 2017, the Texans signed Watson to a four-year, $13.84 million contract featuring an $8.21 million signing bonus.[67] Watson made his first regular-season appearance on September 10, 2017, against the Jacksonville Jaguars. He entered the game after Tom Savage was benched at halftime and played for the remainder of the game. In the third quarter, he threw his first NFL touchdown, a four-yard pass to wide receiver DeAndre Hopkins. He finished with 102 passing yards, a touchdown and an interception as the Texans lost 29–7.[68][69] Watson made his first career start on September 14, his 22nd birthday, in an away game against the Cincinnati Bengals. He finished with 125 passing yards, 67 rushing yards and a 49-yard rushing touchdown as the Texans won 13–9.[70] In Week 4 against the Tennessee Titans, he completed 25 of 34 passes for 283 yards, four touchdowns, and an interception while also rushing for 24 yards and a touchdown as the Texans won 57–14. His five total scores tied the NFL rookie touchdown record.[71] He also became the first rookie to pass for at least four touchdowns and rush for one touchdown in a game since Hall of Famer Fran Tarkenton in 1961.[72] His performance earned him AFC Offensive Player of the Week honors.[73] Watson followed up his Week 4 performance with another great outing against the Kansas City Chiefs. In the 42–34 loss, Watson finished 16-of-31 for 261 yards and five touchdown passes, tying an NFL rookie record for touchdown passes thrown in a single game. He also rushed for 31 yards.[74] In Week 8 against the Seattle Seahawks, Watson posted his first game with over 400 passing yards. He finished with 402 passing yards, four touchdowns, three interceptions and 67 rushing yards, though the Texans lost 41–38. Watson threw 16 touchdowns in the month of October, setting the NFL record for touchdown passes by a rookie in a calendar month. He was named AFC Offensive Player of the Month and the NFL Offensive Rookie of the Month for October.[75] On November 2, Watson tore his ACL on a non-contact play during practice, prematurely ending his rookie season.[76] In seven games (six starts) during his rookie year, Watson amassed 1,699 passing yards, 19 touchdowns and eight interceptions while rushing for 269 yards and two touchdowns.[77][78] On November 8, Watson underwent successful surgery on his right knee to repair his ACL, and no further damage was reported.[79] Watson was ranked 50th by his peers on the NFL Top 100 Players of 2018 list.[80] He was named to the PFWA All-Rookie Team, becoming the second Texans quarterback to receive the award since David Carr had done so in 2002.[81] In the season opener on September 9 against the New England Patriots, Watson returned from injury and threw for 176 yards with a touchdown and an interception and rushed for 40 yards as the Texans lost 27–20.[82] After suffering broken ribs and a partially collapsed lung, Watson took a 12-hour bus ride from Houston to Jacksonville for a Week 7 game against the Jaguars rather than flying because of fears about the effects of air pressure on his chest.[83] He passed for 139 yards and a touchdown in the 20–7 victory.[84] The next week, Watson tied his career high with five touchdowns in a 42–23 victory over the Miami Dolphins.[85] Watson finished the regular season with a career-high 4,165 passing yards, 26 touchdowns, 9 interceptions, 551 rushing yards and 5 rushing touchdowns, as Houston went 11–5 and won the AFC South title.[86] Watson led the league in average time spent in the pocket and was second in average time before throwing.[87] Watson faced the most dropbacks under pressure (281) and tied for the fifth-most times sacked in a single season with 62.[88] In Watson's first postseason appearance, the Texans hosted the Indianapolis Colts in the Wild Card round. Watson completed 29 of 49 passes for 235 yards as the Texans lost 21–7.[89] On January 21, 2019, Watson was named to his first Pro Bowl, replacing the Super Bowl-bound Tom Brady.[90] He was ranked 51st by his fellow players on the NFL Top 100 Players of 2019 list.[91] In the season opener against the New Orleans Saints, Watson completed 20 of 30 passes for 268 yards, three touchdowns, and an interception while also rushing for 40 yards and a touchdown as the Texans lost 28–30.[92][93] In a Week 3 27–20 road victory against the Los Angeles Chargers, he threw for 351 yards and three touchdowns, including a 53-yard touchdown to tight end Jordan Akins. Watson was named AFC Offensive Player of the Week.[94][95] Two weeks later against the Atlanta Falcons, Watson threw for 426 yards and five touchdowns with no interceptions for a perfect passer rating in a 53–32 victory, earning him his second AFC Offensive Player of the Week award.[96][97] In the next game against the Chiefs, Watson threw for 280 yards, a touchdown, and two interceptions. He also rushed 10 times for 42 yards and two touchdowns in the 31–24 road victory.[98] During Week 8 against the Oakland Raiders, he threw for 279 yards and three touchdowns in a 27–24 victory.[99] During a play near the end of the fourth quarter, Watson was kicked in the eye by defensive end Arden Key's cleat while escaping a sack but managed to blindly throw a touchdown pass to tight end Darren Fells.[100] During Week 13 against the Patriots, he threw for 234 yards and three touchdowns and caught a six-yard touchdown pass from wide receiver DeAndre Hopkins in a 28–22 victory[101] en route to his third AFC Offensive Player of the Week award of the season.[102] Watson helped lead the Texans to a 10–6 record and an AFC South title.[103] He finished the season with 3,852 passing yards, 26 passing touchdowns and 12 interceptions along with 413 rushing yards and seven rushing touchdowns.[104] In the Wild Card Round against the Buffalo Bills, Watson led the Texans back from a 16–0 deficit to win 22–19 in overtime, his first NFL playoff victory, despite being sacked seven times. He sealed the game by spinning out of a potential sack by two Bills defenders and finding Taiwan Jones, who ran to the Buffalo 10-yard line to set up the game-winning field goal in overtime.[105] He finished the game with 247 passing yards and a touchdown along with 55 rushing yards and a rushing touchdown.[106] In the divisional round against the Chiefs, Watson threw for 388 yards and two touchdowns and rushed for 37 yards and a touchdown as the Texans lost on the road 51–31 after having blown a 24–0 second-quarter lead.[107] On April 28, 2020, the Texans exercised the fifth-year option on Watson's contract.[108] On September 5, Watson signed a four-year, $177.5 million contract extension with $111 million in guarantees, keeping him under contract through the 2025 season.[109] This marked the second-most lucrative contract in NFL history after that of Aaron Rodgers.[110] In the Week 1 NFL Kickoff Game against the Chiefs, Watson threw for 253 yards, one touchdown and one interception and rushed for 27 yards and a touchdown during a 34–20 loss.[111] In Week 4 against the Minnesota Vikings, Watson threw for 300 yards and two touchdowns as the Texans lost 23–31.[112] In Week 11 against the Patriots, Watson threw for 344 yards and two touchdowns and rushed for 36 yards and another touchdown during a 27–20 win, earning the AFC Offensive Player of the Week award.[113][114] In Week 12, a 41–25 win over the Detroit Lions, Watson passed for 318 yards and four passing touchdowns.[115] With his Week 12 performance, Watson briefly became the NFL's all-time regular-season career passer-rating leader before being surpassed five days later by Patrick Mahomes.[116] Watson was fined $7,500 by the Texans in December 2020 for violating the league's COVID-19 protocols after he and several teammates gathered at the opening of his new restaurant without wearing face masks.[117] Watson finished the season with a pair of three-touchdown performances against the Bengals in Week 16[118] and the Titans in Week 18, but Houston lost both games.[119] In spite of the team's 4-12 record, Watson finished the 2020 season with a league-leading 4,823 passing yards, as well as 33 touchdowns to only seven interceptions.[120] His season was, by all major statistical measures, the best in franchise history, leading in passing touchdowns, passing yards and passer rating.[121] He became the first player to lead the league in passing yards on a team with at least 12 losses since Jeff George of the Oakland Raiders in 1997.[122] Following the 2020 season, Watson requested a trade by the Texans after becoming disgruntled with changes in the front office and coaching staff.[123] The Texans were not willing to negotiate with other teams regarding trade offers, leading to a standoff with Watson until the emergence of sexual-harassment allegations. Despite the off-field controversies and Watson's situation with the team, he participated in OTA activities and training camp, albeit on a limited basis.[124] Watson was named to the Texans' 53-man roster to start the season along with free-agent signing Tyrod Taylor and rookie Davis Mills. Texans general manager Nick Caserio stated that he would handle Watson's situation \"one day at a time.\"[125] Despite not being officially suspended or placed on any reserve list, Watson was ruled out for every Texans game played in 2021 for \"non-injury reasons/personal matter.\"[126] On March 18, 2022, Watson and the Texans' 2024 sixth-round draft pick were traded to the Browns in exchange for the Browns' first-round draft picks in 2022, 2023, and 2024, as well as the Browns' third-round pick in 2023 and fourth-round picks in 2022 and 2024.[127][128] As part of the trade, Watson signed a new, fully guaranteed, five-year, $230 million deal with the Browns, making it the largest contract and most guaranteed money in NFL history.[129] As a result of his sexual harassment allegations, Watson was suspended for six regular season games to start the 2022 season by arbiter Sue Lewis Robinson.[130] He was allowed to participate in preseason activities, including preseason games.[131] Two days later the NFL filed an appeal of the suspension, seeking to extend the suspension to at least a full season (17 regular season games), as well as seeking a fine and establishing a clause in which Watson would seek treatment for his conduct.[132] NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell confirmed that the NFL would seek a full-year suspension including the postseason, calling Watson's conduct \"egregious\" and \"predatory behavior\".[133] The appeal was reviewed by former New Jersey Attorney General Peter C. Harvey.[134][135] On August 18, 2022, after the NFL and the NFLPA reached a settlement, Watson was suspended for the first 11 games of the 2022 regular season and was fined $5 million.[136] On November 28, 2022, Watson was reinstated from his suspension and was officially added to the 53-man roster.[137] In Week 13, Watson started against his former team, the Texans. In his first game in 700 days, Watson posted the worst passer rating of his NFL career at 53.4, throwing for 131 yards and one interception in the 27–14 win.[138] Watson finished the 2022 season with a 3–3 record as starting quarterback, with 1,102 passing yards, 7 touchdowns, and 5 interceptions as he closed out the last six games of the season.[139] The Browns finished with a 7–10 record, and Watson's passer rating of 79.1 for the season was the lowest of his career.[140] In week 10 against the Baltimore Ravens, Watson suffered a displaced fracture to the glenoid in his right shoulder during the first half, but he was able to finish the game. Three days later, on November 15, the Browns announced that Watson would undergo season-ending surgery to repair a broken bone in his throwing shoulder.[141] Watson finished the season starting in six games, finishing with seven touchdowns and four interceptions and 1,115 passing yards.[142] Watson underwent surgery on November 21, with the expectation to be fully recovered before the 2024 NFL season.[143] In Week 1 against the Cowboys, Watson threw for 169 yards, one touchdown, two interceptions, and was sacked six times in a 33–17 loss.[144] Watson was also 0-for-10 on passes thrown 15+ yards downfield, becoming the first quarterback to have 10+ passes thrown 15 or more yards downfield with zero completions since Sportradar began tracking air yards in 2006.[145] Through five games, Watson posted a league-low 23.9 total QBR and failed to achieve over 200 passing yards in a game as the Browns dropped to 1–4. Despite the struggles, head coach Kevin Stefanski stated that Watson would continue to start for Cleveland.[146] On October 20, during the Browns' Week 7 matchup against the Cincinnati Bengals, Watson was carted off the field after suffering a non-contact leg injury.[147] The following day, it was confirmed to be an Achilles tear, which forced him to miss the rest of the 2024 season.[148] Watson underwent Achilles surgery on October 25.[149] With Watson at quarterback, the Browns went 1–6 and ranked last in the NFL with 253.9 yards of offense per game.[150] On January 9, 2025, Watson underwent surgery after he suffered a re-rupture to his right Achilles tendon, potentially keeping him out for the entire 2025 season.[151] On March 16, 2021, a Houston massage therapist filed a civil lawsuit delivered by attorney Tony Buzbee against Watson, claiming that Watson had touched her with the tip of his erect penis while asking her for sex during a visit to her home for treatment in March 2020. Watson vehemently denied Buzbee's claims, stating that \"I have never treated any woman with anything other than the utmost respect.\" According to the suit, the massage therapist immediately ended the session and cried after the incident. Two additional NFL players contacted the massage therapist several weeks later on Watson's recommendation. The suit also claims that Watson later reached out to the massage therapist and apologized for his actions.[152] The next day, another massage therapist represented by Buzbee claimed that Watson had met her at the Houstonian Hotel in August 2020 and completely undressed and refused to cover up, directing her to massage his anus and penis and making a movement that caused her to touch his penis. The therapist also claims that Watson had only paid half of the charges due for her services.[153] On March 18, a third civil lawsuit was filed against Watson, alleging that he had forced a massage therapist to perform oral sex on him before she blacked out in an office building in December 2020. The therapist claims that after Watson left, she was shaken and defecated on herself. Also, on March 18, the NFL announced that it would investigate the sexual assault allegations made against Watson.[154] On March 19, Buzbee claimed that nine more civil suits had been filed against Watson (for a total of 12) and that 22 women contacted his office regarding Watson's conduct while receiving massages. Buzbee requested that the Houston Police Department and the Harris County, Texas, district attorney investigate the situation and pursue criminal charges against Watson. One of the nine new civil suits alleges that Watson attempted to kiss a woman forcibly, and another suit alleges that he had attempted to assault the same woman on two separate occasions.[155] On March 22, a 14th lawsuit was filed by a woman who called Watson a \"serial predator\". The incident allegedly occurred in California, just the second of the 14 allegations to occur outside the Houston area. The traveling massage therapist alleged that when she arrived at the address that Watson had provided, he led her to a room and \"locked the doors behind him\". After Watson allegedly \"forced Plaintiff's hand onto his penis\" during the massage, he allegedly told her, \"I will not have you sign an NDA, but don't ever talk about this.\" The plaintiff also alleges that Watson reached out on Instagram in December, \"acting as if nothing had happened\".[156] By April 5, 22 lawsuits were filed against Watson.[157] 18 professional massage therapists have since expressed support of his character, saying that the allegations contradict their experiences with Watson.[158] Tony Buzbee has stated that he was hesitant to send evidence to the Houston Police Department because Watson's lawyer Rusty Hardin has a son in the police force, instead alleging to send evidence from his clients \"elsewhere\" while also criticizing outgoing HPD chief Art Acevedo.[159] Hardin and Acevedo have since criticized Buzbee's statements, with Hardin saying that he and his client would \"always remain available to any law enforcement or regulatory agency who desires our cooperation\".[160][161] On April 2, the HPD announced an investigation of Watson after a complainant filed an official report.[162] On April 6, two of the 22 women who had filed lawsuits against Watson publicly identified themselves at a press conference.[162] Ashley Solis, the first of the women to identify herself, claimed that during a massage appointment at her home, Watson exposed himself and touched her hand with his erect penis before she ended the session and asked him to leave. At a press conference, Solis said that she suffers from panic attacks, anxiety and depression resulting from the sexual assault. She stated: \"People say that I'm doing this just for money. That is false. I come forward now so that Deshaun Watson does not assault another woman.\"[163] On April 9, Hardin claimed that some of Watson's massages did lead to some \"sexual activity\" but that it was consensual.[164] That same day, two judges ruled that 13 of the 22 lawsuits must be refiled within two business days or risk dismissal and that four of the accusers must refile using their current names. Attorneys announced that 9 of the 12 women would reveal their names voluntarily. The judge granted Watson's attorneys' emergency motion requiring the release of the other accusers' names.[165][166][167] On September 9, 2024, Watson was sued for sexual assault and battery by a new accuser in Houston, who alleged that Watson penetrated her vagina without consent in several positions during a date in 2020.[168] On April 7, 2021, Nike and Beats By Dre suspended endorsement deals with Watson. Reliant Energy and H-E-B stated that they did not plan on engaging with Watson in the future.[169] On March 11, 2022, a grand jury declined to indict Watson on criminal charges related to \"harassment and sexual misconduct\". On that date he still faced 22 civil lawsuits, many alleging sexual misconduct, and assault.[170] As of August 1, 2022, all but one of the pending civil cases had been settled.[171] As a result of these accusations, the NFL announced on August 18, 2022, that Watson would be suspended for 11 games, pay a record $5 million fine, undergo evaluation by behavioral experts, and complete a treatment program. His fine and an additional $2 million will be donated to agencies that work to prevent sexual assault.[172] Watson is a Christian.[181][182] In 2006, when Watson was 11, Atlanta Falcons running back Warrick Dunn donated a home to Watson's family through Dunn's charity Homes for the Holidays, in partnership with Habitat for Humanity.[183] In 2017, Watson donated his first NFL game check of approximately $27,000 to three NRG Stadium cafeteria employees affected by Hurricane Harvey.[184][185]",

                "title": "The road to Browns QB Deshaun Watson's season-ending injury - ESPN",
                "content": "Adam Schefter joined Pat McAfee in October and discussed Deshaun Watson's future with the Browns after the quarterback ruptured his right Achilles tendon. (1:55) FOUR DAYS BEFORE the Cleveland Browns' 2024 season opener at Huntington Bank Field, Deshaun Watson was asked if he still considered himself one of the league's elite quarterbacks. Watson, for whom Cleveland traded three first-round draft picks to the Houston Texans and guaranteed $230 million for five years in 2022, had played 12 games since the 2020 season. He'd led the NFL in passing yards, yards per attempt and yards per completion in 2020. But, hoping to be traded, he sat out the 2021 season. During that time, he was accused by more than two dozen women of sexual assault and sexual misconduct during massage sessions -- allegations which eventually led to an 11-game suspension for violating the league's personal conduct policy to start his Browns career in 2022. Heading into the 2024 season, Watson's 41.9 QBR since making his Browns debut was the sixth-worst mark in the league during that span. But the quarterback was confident he could return to his status as one of the best at his position. \"Of course. No doubt,\" Watson answered. Seven games into the 2024 season, Watson ruptured his right Achilles on a noncontact play in a 21-14 loss to the Cincinnati Bengals, ending his season. He finished with a league-worst 23.5 QBR with five touchdowns and three interceptions. Watson's injury capped a tumultuous two months for the 29-year-old. He produced the worst statistical season of his career, failing to settle into an offense adjusted to better suit him. He went through the deaths of his father and a former college teammate. He was booed during Sunday's player introductions by home fans. All the while, his confidence on the field and status as Cleveland's starter were constantly questioned as the poor performances -- and losses -- piled up. And in September, a fresh lawsuit accusing him of sexual assault in 2020 was filed and later settled. In Watson's absence, the Browns will start 10-year veteran Jameis Winston at quarterback in Sunday's game against the Baltimore Ravens (1 p.m. ET, CBS). Watson, scheduled for surgery on Friday, has two more years of fully guaranteed money on his deal. But the Browns' actions over the next several months could reveal what they think about his time in Cleveland. At 1-6, the franchise is trending toward a high draft pick and opportunity to select a top quarterback in the 2025 draft. The lasting image of Watson's 2024 -- the quarterback writhing in pain on the ground and then weeping under a towel while being carted off -- ended the latest chapter of his Browns career, and another season in which he failed to capture his peak form. \"I'm disappointed that it's only X number of games that he's able to play this season,\" coach Kevin Stefanski said. \"But I do think we know what he's about. I know what he brings to the table for this football team.\" AFTER THE BROWNS' 33-17 loss to Dallas in Week 1, Watson, hunching over in a seat at his locker, slowly got dressed as he listened to Winston, one of Watson's most vocal advocates this season. Soon after, Browns general manager Andrew Berry entered the room. He went over to Watson's locker and had a brief conversation with the quarterback. When he was done, Watson smiled at Berry, who gave him a pat on the back before leaving. In his postgame news conference, Watson told reporters he received encouraging words from Berry and Winston. Watson's father, as well as his former Clemson teammate, Diondre Overton, had died earlier that week. It was the first time Berry had spoken to Watson since. \"It's been a long week, and [the team] gave me the opportunity to go back home, but I told them I wanted to be here with my guys,\" Watson said. \"So it wasn't even really about football. It was really just kind of [Berry's] first time seeing me over the weekend, kind of, you know, let me know he's here with me.\" Watson had one of the worst performances of his career in the game. The 8.4 QBR was the lowest of his career with at least 10 passing attempts. (He registered an 8.2 QBR against the Washington Commanders the next month). Watson was asked afterward whether the performance shook his confidence. \"Hell no,\" he answered. \"I'll always be Deshaun Watson, regardless of whoever else says otherwise.\" WATSON HELPED LEAD the Browns to their first -- and lone -- victory of the season in an 18-13 road win over the Jacksonville Jaguars in Week 2. His performance -- 22-of-34 passing for 186 yards and a rushing touchdown -- marked one of the better games of his Browns tenure. \"Deshaun got a game ball,\" Stefanski said. \"I mean, he played well. He helped us win that game.\" But six days before the game, a new civil lawsuit was filed in Harris County, Texas, accusing Watson of sexual assault and battery in October 2020, when he was a member of the Texans. The suit was unrelated to the two lawsuits remaining from the women who accused Watson of sexual misconduct during massage sessions. The NFL opened an investigation into the newest lawsuit but did not put Watson on the commissioner's exempt list, which allowed him to continue to play. Watson denied the allegations and said he did not know of the accusations or lawsuit until it surfaced. When asked, Stefanski said he was not previously aware of the lawsuit either and Watson would continue to start. A month later, lawyers for both sides announced the dispute had been resolved. At the league's fall meetings last week, commissioner Roger Goodell said the league was still investigating. DAYS AFTER A 21-15 home loss to the New York Giants in Week 3, Watson faced scrutiny over a late fourth-and-1 play in which he missed tight end Jordan Akins wide open in the flat. Watson seemed to be locked in on another pass catcher, who was covered, and was eventually sacked. Watson defended the play, saying that Akins was a \"decoy\" and never was supposed to get the ball. Akins, as well as offensive coordinator Ken Dorsey, when asked about the play, were tightlipped about whether Watson made the correct read or not. It was one of many times teammates and coaches declined to criticize or question Watson's play, even as metrics and film suggested he was lacking feel in the pocket and missing targets on routine plays. On multiple occasions throughout the first half of the season, teammates and coaches pointed to the Browns' issues on offense as a collective problem, not singularly tied to Watson. IN A WEEK 4 game against the Las Vegas Raiders, cameras caught Watson on the ground at Allegiant Stadium, yelling and clapping his hands at right tackle Dawand Jones after a missed block led to a quarterback hit and errant pass. An incensed Winston was also held back while trying to address Jones on the sideline. In the 20-16 road loss, the Browns' second straight defeat, it was one of many miscues that loomed large. On the play, wide receiver Amari Cooper had broken free from coverage downfield. But with Raiders defensive end Tyree Wilson given a free path to rush Watson, the pass fell aimlessly along the sideline. All involved later downplayed the exchange. Jones, a 2023 fourth-round pick who excelled as a rookie before tearing his right MCL, has struggled this season, and lost his starting spot weeks later. \"Just trying to be great, that's it,\" Watson said after the game. \"We just all got to get on the same page, so we can execute and try to win and be explosive. That was it. We all knew [the play would have been a touchdown]. We've just got to execute and be on the same page to make those big plays.\" IN WEEK 5 at the Washington Commanders, Watson left his teammates in the huddle and headed off the field as a bewildered Stefanski watched from the sidelines. The Browns were trying to overcome a 24-3 third-quarter deficit and had moved the ball to the 2-yard line after recovering a fumble. What followed was a false-start penalty, a timeout, a sack, a dropped pass in the end zone and a Watson throwaway. Then, with 12 players in the huddle on fourth down, the play clock winding down and another flag looming, Watson made his exit to the sideline. \"We had the wrong amount of people in the huddle and then at that point, we were just going to kick the field goal,\" Stefanski explained after a 34-13 loss. Watson's performance against the Commanders marked the third time he registered a QBR under 10 since joining the Browns. Cooper later defended criticism that Watson was the primary reason for the offense's struggles. \"To be honest, I don't think Deshaun is the problem at all,\" said Cooper, who was traded to the Buffalo Bills on Oct. 15. \"We can all play better for him.\" The day after the loss, Commanders defensive lineman Jonathan Allen told Washington-based radio station 106.7 The Fan that he believed Watson's confidence had been shaken. \"He looks like a player who's had stuff going on above his shoulder,\" Allen said. \"There's definitely a confidence thing going on. ... I still think he has that potential. I don't know. Football is a weird game. If mentally you're not good up top, you're not going to be confident.\" When asked for a response, Watson said: \"Every time I step on the field, I've just got to be able to go out there and play confident football and just go out there and do my job at the highest ability. ... When I step on the field, I am confident and I just want to go out there and just try to play the best football I can play.\" Winston replaced Watson for the final drive, and for the first time all season Stefanski was asked about Watson's standing as the starting quarterback. Stefanski stood by Watson, saying he would remain in the lineup. A week later, he and Dorsey said Watson gave the Browns the best opportunity to win. \"This is not a one-person issue on offense,\" Stefanski said. \"We have the guys. We have the coaches. We will get it fixed.\" ONE DAY AFTER the loss to the Commanders, Stefanski was peppered with questions about who held the authority to bench Watson. \"I make decisions for our football team,\" Stefanski said, \"but I obviously consult with Andrew. We talk about everything that goes on with our football team, but ultimately it's my decision.\" Stefanski, though, declined to say if ownership had a say in keeping Watson as the starter. \"I wouldn't get into all the specifics,\" Stefanski said. \"I think you guys know that we make great decisions together. I obviously talk to Andrew about everything we do. We talk to ownership about everything we do. That's just how we operate.\" Multiple team sources told ESPN the decision to continue playing Watson was agreed upon throughout the organization. But by the next week, Watson seemed out of answers for the Browns' problems. He tilted his head, looked into the distance and paused for several seconds when asked how to correct the latest mistakes in the aftermath of a 20-16 loss to the Philadelphia Eagles. \"[Me] being the quarterback of this offense with Kevin and Ken, we have to do something a little bit -- I don't know what we have to do, but we need to do something to lock in, so we don't cost ourselves any more games,\" Watson said. \"Because we've got to really turn this around.\" AS HE ENTERED Cleveland's Huntington Bank Field ahead of the Browns' Week 7 game against the Bengals, Watson was met by boos from the home crowd, which were quickly followed by cheers for running back Nick Chubb, who was making his season debut after suffering a severe left knee injury in September 2023. Ninety minutes later, Watson was in tears as he was being carted off the field with the Achilles injury. He ended the game with a 41 QBR, a season-best mark. In the aftermath, several fans cheered the injury and booed Watson, which drew rebuke from his teammates. \"We don't boo the guys that are injured on the field, especially with the extent where the cart comes out,\" defensive end Myles Garrett said. \"We should be ashamed of ourselves as Browns and as fans to boo anyone and their downfall.\" The long-term future of the quarterback position in Cleveland remains murky. This Sunday, Winston will become the 38th quarterback to start for the franchise since 2000, most in the league. The Browns still owe Watson $46 million in each of the next two seasons. The financial implications of cutting Watson -- a record $172 million dead cap hit -- would make roster-building in 2025 difficult. The day after Watson's injury, Stefanski avoided answering questions about his standing as the starter when healthy. It was a stark contrast from a coach who just weeks ago had championed Watson as the franchise's best option at quarterback. \"This is a tough break for him, but I know he will bounce back,\" Stefanski said. \"He's been a great contributor to this football team, both in the locker room, on the practice field, on the game field, and we'll just support him as he rehabs from that injury.\" ESPN senior writer Kalyn Kahler contributed to this report.",

The Buckeyes countered by landing former Kansas State quarterback Will Howard, a decision that seemed to benefit both the school and team. With Howard, a fifth-year senior, leading the offense, Ohio State won 10 regular season games, followed by two College Football Playoff games to enter the semifinals. Howard turned out to be the perfect player to help head coach Ryan Day, new offensive coordinator Chip Kelly, and star freshman wide receiver Jeremiah Smith. The Sporting News examines why Will Howard chose to join the Buckeyes. SN's PLAYOFF HQ: Live CFP scores | Updated CFP bracket | Full CFP schedule Howard started for Kansas State in 2022 and 2023 but chose enter the portal as a graduate transfer following the 2023 season. When Howard transferred from Kansas State to Ohio State, he did so with a title in mind. The fifth-year senior chose the Buckeyes in large part due to their path to winning the National Championship. \"When I started talking to Ohio State, everything kind of lined up,\" Howard said last year, via ESPN's Pete Thamel. \"I had a list of things I was looking for, in terms of needing to go somewhere where there was a lot of talent around me and somewhere I could compete for a national championship.\" With that goal in mind, Howard certainly made a strong choice, as Ohio State is now one of four teams left with a chance to win the National Championship. Kansas State, meanwhile, finished at a respectable 9-4 on the season for the second-straight year, but it wasn't good enough for the Playoff. However, that's not the only reason Howard is now at Ohio State, as the quarterback also believes this team gives him the best chance to make it in the NFL. \"At the end of the day, I want to go be a starting quarterback in the NFL,\" Howard added. \"I feel like the best place to stick as a quarterback in the NFL is as a first- or second-round pick in the NFL draft. Going to Ohio State gives me a chance to make a jump and leap into that conversation.\" It is still too early to tell whether Ohio State helped Howard get into the first or second round of the NFL draft, just like the team helped him play for a title. COLLEGE FOOTBALL AWARDS After a tough freshman season, and a quiet sophomore year, Howard improved in each of the past three seasons, culminating in this year's breakout performance for the Buckeyes. Howard led the Big Ten in touchdown passes and set career-highs across the board while playing for the explosive Ohio State offense. Howard is the seventh-ranked quarterback in this year's NFL draft according to the NFL Mock Draft Database, which puts him as a Day-3 pick. This season should help Howard's stock, as the Buckeyes quarterback put up career-best numbers in multiple areas. Additionally, he played on the biggest stage with one of the biggest brands in the country and most recently led the Buckeyes' to a blowout over the then-undefeated Oregon powerhouse.

Fire crews battle the Kenneth Fire in the West Hills section of Los Angeles, Thursday, Jan. 9, 2025. Ethan Swope / AP On Thursday afternoon, the Kenneth Fire started in the San Fernando Valley. It moved into neighboring Ventura County, but a large and aggressive response by firefighters stopped the flames from spreading. The fires have burned more than 10,000 homes and other structures since Tuesday, when they first began popping up around a densely populated, 25-mile (40-kilometer) expanse north of downtown Los Angeles. No cause has been identified yet for the largest fires.

Gavin Newsom ordered the investigation over the loss of water pressure as firefighters struggled to contain multiple, fierce fires that burned down neighborhoods across the Los Angeles area. “We need answers to how that happened,” Newsom said in a statement, calling ongoing reports of the lack of water “deeply troubling.” Los Angeles County officials will hold a news conference at 1 p.m. Pacific Time to provide an update on the Eaton Fire in the Pasadena area.

Several organizations are also helping support animals and pet owners impacted by the Los Angeles wildfires, including: Other organizations are focused on long-term recovery efforts, including: The Los Angeles Fire Department has downgraded the evacuation order for a fire in the Granada Hills area to an evacuation warning.

Flames were already attacking the campus of Pasadena Jewish Temple and Center when the cantor, Ruth Berman Harris, and three companions rushed in to rescue its sacred Torah scrolls. Physically, that’s now all that is left of the 80-year-old synagogue, destroyed by wildfires that also destroyed a mosque, a Catholic parish and a half-dozen Protestant churches. Many members of these congregations were among the thousands of Angelenos who lost their homes this week. As the threat of new fires persisted, clergy were left with the huge challenges of offering comfort and pondering paths toward rebuilding and recovery. “There’s absolutely nothing except for a few walls and the empty space,” said the Pasadena Jewish Center’s executive director, Melissa Levy. ▶ Read more on congregants and places of worship affected by the wildfires Friends and family who lost property may need cash, temporary housing, or emotional support. But it’s important to reach out delicately and to not have expectations for how or whether they will respond, said Dr. Adrienne Heinz, a clinical research psychologist at the Department of Veterans Affairs National Center for PTSD. Here are some tips she has: It can be helpful to check in. An example: “I’m so sorry for what has happened to your community. There aren’t really words to describe how sad this is. Can I send your family a meal tonight? I’m here for you and will keep checking in. No pressure to respond.” Offer concrete ways of helping like lodging, gift cards, meals, child care. Give them grace. They may not be able to respond for various reasons. Refrain from phrases that minimize or invalidate their experience, like “At least you’re alive,” or “Everything happens for a reason.” Just because someone didn’t lose their home, doesn’t mean they aren’t hurting. Margaret Stewart, a spokeswoman with the Los Angeles Fire Department, said firefighters on the ground and in the air were able to tackle the Archer Fire quickly and that the evacuation order is expected to be downgraded soon. “We still have some winds and that’s why we have not yet lifted the evacuation order,” Stewart told KTLA. The brush fire sparked in the Granada Hills area. The Los Angeles Fire Department issued an evacuation order on Friday due to a brush fire in the Granada Hills area. The area is just west of the Hurst Fire. Firefighters have spent the past few days battling major fires across the Los Angeles area with fierce winds hampering their efforts. Here are a couple of organizations that are working to support firefighters, first responders, and their families. California Fire Foundation: California Professional Firefighters founded the nonprofit in 1987 to support families of fallen firefighters, firefighters and communities impacted by fires. The foundation is supporting both firefighters responding to the Los Angeles fires as well as people affected. Watch Duty: The nonprofit service provides real-time updates on wildfire activity, evacuations, shelters and more via its free app, which more than 1.4 million people downloaded in the 48 hours since the fires began. The organization relies on donations and a team of 200 volunteers, gathering and vetting information from radio scanners and official sources, to do its work. “They know every single thing we’re doing about this response,” President Joe Biden said on Friday. However, Biden took a shot at President-elect Donald Trump, who he referred to as “someone from the other team,” by mocking his call to sweep the forest floors to reduce fire dangers. “C’mon man,” he said. Biden said it would be a better idea to bury electricity transmission wires, which would be “a hell of a lot safer” but would cost “a hell of a lot of money” to do. “There’s clear evidence that there’s looting,” he said at the briefing. Biden said that’s why they’ve deployed police and National Guard to improve security in the areas affected by the wildfires. “I know you’re getting a bad rap regarding fire hydrants that aren’t working,” he said to Mayor Karen Bass during the briefing on Friday. “Give me a break.” Biden pegged the problem to utilities cutting power because they’re worried about sparking more fires, which has hampered the ability to pump water. “This is complicated stuff, and you’re going to have a lot of demagogues out there trying to take advantage of it.” Bass appeared virtually at the briefing alongside California Gov. Gavin Newsom. During the Oval Office briefing, California Gov. Gavin Newsom said he expects firefighters to “make a lot of progress” on Friday. Local leaders have faced sharp criticism for their handling of the fires, some of it coming from right-wing sources. Newsom said, “We’ve got to deal with this misinformation.” “People want to divide this country and we’re going to have to address this as well,” he added. President Joe Biden hosted a briefing on the wildfires in the Oval Office on Friday. Vice President Kamala Harris was also there, and California Gov. Gavin Newsom and Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass appeared virtually. Biden described the fires as the “worst in California history” and “we still got a long way to go.” Although progress has been made, the winds that have fanned the flames could remain a threat for days. Harris said people responding to the fires are showing “the best of the American spirit.” “There are moments where we should find optimism in the heroism of people, who are taking in strangers, taking in friends,” she said. “The nature center is gone ... the wildflowers, the shrubs are gone,” said Richard Smart, Superintendent of the Eaton Canyon Natural Area in Pasadena, in an interview on Thursday. He said that only a few exterior walls of the Eaton Canyon Nature Center were left standing after wildfires tore through the area. The nature center burned down before, in 1993, and did not reopen until 1997. “The park is such a touchstone for people in the community, and so to lose that is just — devastating is not even the right word. It feels indescribable,” he said. Staffers were unable to reach the center in time to evacuate the animals. Around 15 reptiles died. Two desert tortoises survived because they were hibernating for the winter at a volunteer’s home. The park has over 150 volunteers, many of whom have lost their homes. Palisades: 8% Eaton: 3% Kenneth: 35% Hurst: 37% Lidia: 75% The causes of the fires are still under investigation. A reporter pointed out there is a forecast for strong winds to return to the LA area next week and people may deactivate the alerts because of the frustration with all the false alarms. “We know that we’re going to have a possible increase in the force of the winds at the beginning of next week and we’re getting Los Angeles prepared, doing everything we can to save lives, that is our number one job to protect people’s homes, to protect people’s businesses and to prepare to rebuild Los Angeles in a much better way,” she said. When questioned about the false alerts that have been going on Mayor Karen Bass said officials are working to figure out why that is happening and turned to a message of uniting Angelenos. “I’m going to spend every moment that I can making sure that I’m in as many areas as possible, meeting and talking to residents to see what is needed in the recovery,” Bass said. “We’re moving at recovery mode at the same time, meaning, we want the city rebuilt. We want to see Los Angeles come together,” she added. Los Angeles District Attorney Nathan Hochman said he would prosecute anyone looting, those flying drones in the wildfire zones, and those breaking the curfew “to the full extent of the law.” “Looting is a despicable crime,” he said. “For the people who have already been arrested, please know this is not going to end well.” Los Angeles Sheriff Robert Luna said a curfew on all mandatory evacuation zones will start again at 6 p.m. Friday for houses left standing. Officials imposed a curfew overnight after arresting several people looting in the burned areas. “You can’t not be in these affected areas. If you are, you are subject to arrest,” he said. Los Angeles Fire Chief Kristin Crowley said all evacuation orders and warnings in LA County for the Kenneth Fire have been lifted. Overall evacuation orders have dipped to 153,000 from more than 180,000. Los Angeles County Fire Chief Anthony Perrone said the super scooper that was damaged by a drone should be back in the air by Monday. “Flying a drone in the fire traffic area is not only dangerous but it’s illegal,” he said, adding that those who fly them over the wildfire area will be prosecuted. Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass said officials are working around the clock and that firefighters have extinguished fires in Pacoima, Hollywood, Studio City and other places. “To all Angelenos, we’re fighting hard for each of you,” she said. “I don’t believe there is anything Angelenos can’t do if we stand together,” she added. “There is an extreme amount of frustration, anger, fear with regards to the erroneous messages that have been sent out through the wireless emergency Alert System across L.A County. I can’t express enough how sorry I am for this experience,” L.A. County Office of Emergency Management Director Kevin McGowan said at a news conference on Friday. McGowan said the alerts are not being sent by a person and his office is trying to find the root cause. Several organizations are working to support people, families and households affected by the wildfires in the Los Angeles area. Among those are: GoFundMe.org: The crowdfunding platform’s nonprofit arm uses its Wildfire Recovery Fund to give emergency grants to verified people and families fundraising for themselves or others, as well as small businesses and nonprofits. Global Empowerment Mission (GEM) and BStrong: In partnership with Bethenny Frankel’s bstrong disaster relief fund, GEM will distribute cash cards to evacuated residents to help with immediate needs like accommodation, gas and food. The organizations are accepting cash donations. Los Angeles Regional Food Bank: The food bank is supporting a network of more than 600 partner agencies to make sure impacted households are fed. It’s accepting cash donations, food donations at two sites, and volunteers. If your household needs assistance, you can find a food bank here. Major fires across the Los Angeles area this week have killed at least 10 people, destroyed thousands of structures and forced 180,000 to flee their homes — including children. Here are a couple of organizations accepting support specifically for kids and families: Project Camp: The Los Angeles-based organization runs trauma-informed pop-up day camps for children displaced or out of school due to natural disasters. It’s in the process of setting up multiple sites to help families impacted by the Palisades and Eaton fires. It is accepting monetary donations as well as volunteers to staff the camps. Impacted families can also find out how to sign up for a camp here. Boys and Girls Clubs of Malibu: Informed by its experience helping kids and families after the 2018 Woolsey fire, the organization is offering free counseling, case management and resource referrals for area families. It’s collecting donations to provide emergency grants and, when its facilities can safely reopen, it will create an emergency relief distribution center. Those looking for help can fill out intake forms in English and Spanish.

Hong / AP A firefighting plane had to be grounded Thursday after it was struck by a drone flown by a civilian, the Los Angeles County Fire Department said. Nobody was injured. It’s a federal crime to fly a drone during firefighting. NBC News reporter Jacob Soboroff didn’t know what to expect when he turned his SUV onto the Pacific Palisades street where he grew up. What he found on Wednesday were smoldering ruins where his childhood home had stood. Only the remnants of a chimney and brick wall remained. It was among the countless number of buildings destroyed by the wildfires in the Los Angeles area, where Soboroff is one of many journalists covering the story — and living it. His own tale, told across several NBC News platforms Wednesday and Thursday, broke the so-called “fourth wall” and gave viewers an intimate experience of what the tragedy felt like. ▶ Read more on how the wildfires have impacted Soboroff and other National Guard troops were patrolling the streets of Altadena before dawn on Friday after being called in to help protect property in the fire evacuation zone. Troops in camouflage were posted at intersections in the city hard-hit by the Eaton Fire near Jeeps, Humvees and other military vehicles. At least 20 arrests have been made for looting and other thefts in areas where the fire raged. Los Angeles County officials say they plan to put an overnight curfew in place that would make it easier to make arrests. “We haven’t had any requests for further support. But Australia always stands ready to provide support to our friends in times of need,” Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese Albanese told Australian Broadcasting Corp. in the west coast city of Perth on Friday. “One of the issues that we have, of course, is we do need to be cognizant of the fact that this is our fire season as well,” he added. The California fires come at the peak of Australia’s fire season. Earth recorded its hottest year ever in 2024, with such a big jump that the planet temporarily passed a major climate threshold, several weather monitoring agencies announced on Friday. Last year’s global average temperature easily passed 2023’s record heat and kept pushing even higher. It surpassed the long-term warming limit of 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit ) since the late 1800s that was called for by the 2015 Paris climate pact, according to the European Commission’s Copernicus Climate Service, the United Kingdom’s Meteorology Office and Japan’s weather agency. The European team calculated 1.6 degrees Celsius (2.89 degrees Fahrenheit) of warming. Japan found 1.57 degrees Celsius (2.83 degrees Fahrenheit) and the British 1.53 degrees Celsius (2.75 degrees Fahrenheit) in releases of data coordinated to early Friday morning European time. ▶ Read more about what this could mean for the climate in the future Investigators are considering an array of possible ignition sources for the huge fires that have killed at least 10 people and destroyed thousands of homes and businesses in the Los Angeles area. While lightning is the most common source of fires in the U.S., according to the National Fire Protection Association, investigators were able to rule that out quickly. There were no reports of lightning in the Palisades area or the terrain around the Eaton fire, which started in east Los Angeles County and has also destroyed hundreds of homes. The next two most common causes: fires intentionally set, and those sparked by utility lines. ▶ Read more about what may have caused the fires Tags: Wildfires, California, News Streaming Now BBC Discussion & Documentary",

                "content": "Nation Firefighters are hoping for a break Friday from the fierce winds that have fueled massive blazes in the Los Angeles area, killing 10 people, obliterating whole neighborhoods and setting the nation's second-largest city on edge. By The Associated Press Firefighters are hoping for a break Friday from the fierce winds that have fueled massive blazes in the Los Angeles area, killing 10 people, obliterating whole neighborhoods and setting the nation's second-largest city on edge. On Thursday afternoon, the Kenneth Fire started in the San Fernando Valley. It moved into neighboring Ventura County, but a large and aggressive response by firefighters stopped the flames from spreading. The fires have burned more than 10,000 homes and other structures since Tuesday, when they first began popping up around a densely populated, 25-mile (40-kilometer) expanse north of downtown Los Angeles. No cause has been identified yet for the largest fires. Here's the latest: Red flag warning set to expire Los Angeles Fire Chief Anthony Marrone said the current red flag warning will expire at 6 p.m. Pacific on Friday but a new warning is expected to be issued Monday, when windy conditions in the Los Angeles area are forecast to return. Lakers' head coach confirms his family lost their home in the Palisades fire Los Angeles Lakers head coach JJ Redick became emotional when he spoke about the fire's impact for the first time on Friday after practice with the Lakers, who are currently scheduled to return to action Saturday against San Antonio. ''I'm not sure I've wept or wailed like that in several years,'' Redick said. Redick said the rented home in Pacific Palisades burned down Tuesday while the Lakers were on the road in Dallas. Redick's wife, Chelsea, and their two sons were safely away from the neighborhood. Firefighters from Mexico will help fight the Eaton Fire, Newsom says ''California is deeply grateful for President @ClaudiaShein's support as we work to suppress the Los Angeles wildfires,'' he wrote on Friday in a post on the social platform X. ''Our partnership and shared commitment to helping communities in need is greatly valued.'' Newsom orders investigation of the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power Gov. Gavin Newsom ordered the investigation over the loss of water pressure as firefighters struggled to contain multiple, fierce fires that burned down neighborhoods across the Los Angeles area. ''We need answers to how that happened,'' Newsom said in a statement, calling ongoing reports of the lack of water ''deeply troubling.'' A public update on the Eaton Fire is expected Friday afternoon Los Angeles County officials will hold a news conference at 1 p.m. Pacific Time to provide an update on the Eaton Fire in the Pasadena area. County Supervisor Kathryn Barger will be joined by fire and law enforcement officials. Other ways to help those affected by the wildfires Several organizations are also helping support animals and pet owners impacted by the Los Angeles wildfires, including: 1. Pasadena Humane Society: The animal rescue had taken in over 300 animals due to evacuations as of Wednesday night, including some with burns and injuries. Its officers are also on the ground finding animals that need help. It is accepting monetary donations as well as goods from its Amazon wishlist. Other organizations are focused on long-term recovery efforts, including: 2. California Community Foundation: The 110-year-old Los Angeles-based foundation's Wildfire Recovery Fund addresses long-term recovery needs like temporary housing, rebuilding homes, mental health and medical care. It also provides updated equipment to firefighters and helps rebuild emergency communications systems. It is accepting cash donations and helps company-match employees' gifts as well. 3. Team Rubicon and Samaritan's Purse: Both organizations will help people who lost homes with debris removal once cleanup begins, among other work related to rebuilding. Team Rubicon is currently helping local agencies with tasks like clearing roads and Samaritan's Purse has deployed 20 chaplains from the Billy Graham Rapid Response Team to provide spiritual support. Archer Fire evacuation order downgraded The Los Angeles Fire Department has downgraded the evacuation order for a fire in the Granada Hills area to an evacuation warning. The department puts the Archer Fire at 31 acres (13 hectares). Los Angeles fires leave congregants without worship spaces Flames were already attacking the campus of Pasadena Jewish Temple and Center when the cantor, Ruth Berman Harris, and three companions rushed in to rescue its sacred Torah scrolls. Physically, that's now all that is left of the 80-year-old synagogue, destroyed by wildfires that also destroyed a mosque, a Catholic parish and a half-dozen Protestant churches. Many members of these congregations were among the thousands of Angelenos who lost their homes this week. As the threat of new fires persisted, clergy were left with the huge challenges of offering comfort and pondering paths toward rebuilding and recovery. ''There's absolutely nothing except for a few walls and the empty space,'' said the Pasadena Jewish Center's executive director, Melissa Levy. ▶ Read more on congregants and places of worship affected by the wildfires How to help people you know who are affected by the fires Friends and family who lost property may need cash, temporary housing, or emotional support. But it's important to reach out delicately and to not have expectations for how or whether they will respond, said Dr. Adrienne Heinz, a clinical research psychologist at the Department of Veterans Affairs National Center for PTSD. Here are some tips she has: It can be helpful to check in. An example: ''I'm so sorry for what has happened to your community. There aren't really words to describe how sad this is. Can I send your family a meal tonight? I'm here for you and will keep checking in. No pressure to respond.'' Offer concrete ways of helping like lodging, gift cards, meals, child care. Give them grace. They may not be able to respond for various reasons. Refrain from phrases that minimize or invalidate their experience, like ''At least you're alive,'' or ''Everything happens for a reason.'' Just because someone didn't lose their home, doesn't mean they aren't hurting. Officials expect to downgrade new evacuation order soon Margaret Stewart, a spokeswoman with the Los Angeles Fire Department, said firefighters on the ground and in the air were able to tackle the Archer Fire quickly and that the evacuation order is expected to be downgraded soon. ''We still have some winds and that's why we have not yet lifted the evacuation order,'' Stewart told KTLA. The brush fire sparked in the Granada Hills area. New evacuation order issued The Los Angeles Fire Department issued an evacuation order on Friday due to a brush fire in the Granada Hills area. The area is just west of the Hurst Fire. How to help firefighters and other first responders Firefighters have spent the past few days battling major fires across the Los Angeles area with fierce winds hampering their efforts. Here are a couple of organizations that are working to support firefighters, first responders, and their families. California Fire Foundation: California Professional Firefighters founded the nonprofit in 1987 to support families of fallen firefighters, firefighters and communities impacted by fires. The foundation is supporting both firefighters responding to the Los Angeles fires as well as people affected. Watch Duty: The nonprofit service provides real-time updates on wildfire activity, evacuations, shelters and more via its free app, which more than 1.4 million people downloaded in the 48 hours since the fires began. The organization relies on donations and a team of 200 volunteers, gathering and vetting information from radio scanners and official sources, to do its work. The Biden administration is working with Trump's team on the fires ''They know every single thing we're doing about this response,'' President Joe Biden said on Friday. However, Biden took a shot at President-elect Donald Trump, who he referred to as ''someone from the other team,'' by mocking his call to sweep the forest floors to reduce fire dangers. ''C'mon man,'' he said. Biden said it would be a better idea to bury electricity transmission wires, which would be ''a hell of a lot safer'' but would cost ''a hell of a lot of money'' to do. Biden says looting during the wildfires is a problem ''There's clear evidence that there's looting,'' he said at the briefing. Biden said that's why they've deployed police and National Guard to improve security in the areas affected by the wildfires. Biden defends LA mayor over criticism about water supplies ''I know you're getting a bad rap regarding fire hydrants that aren't working,'' he said to Mayor Karen Bass during the briefing on Friday. ''Give me a break.'' Biden pegged the problem to utilities cutting power because they're worried about sparking more fires, which has hampered the ability to pump water. ''This is complicated stuff, and you're going to have a lot of demagogues out there trying to take advantage of it.'' Bass appeared virtually at the briefing alongside California Gov. Gavin Newsom. Newsom: ‘We've got to deal with this misinformation' around handling of the fires During the Oval Office briefing, California Gov. Gavin Newsom said he expects firefighters to ''make a lot of progress'' on Friday. Local leaders have faced sharp criticism for their handling of the fires, some of it coming from right-wing sources. Newsom said, ''We've got to deal with this misinformation.'' ''People want to divide this country and we're going to have to address this as well,'' he added. Biden and Harris convene for wildfire briefing President Joe Biden hosted a briefing on the wildfires in the Oval Office on Friday. Vice President Kamala Harris was also there, and California Gov. Gavin Newsom and Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass appeared virtually. Biden described the fires as the ''worst in California history'' and ''we still got a long way to go.'' Although progress has been made, the winds that have fanned the flames could remain a threat for days. Harris said people responding to the fires are showing ''the best of the American spirit.'' ''There are moments where we should find optimism in the heroism of people, who are taking in strangers, taking in friends,'' she said. Several reptiles die after Eaton Canyon Nature Center burns down ''The nature center is gone ... the wildflowers, the shrubs are gone,'' said Richard Smart, Superintendent of the Eaton Canyon Natural Area in Pasadena, in an interview on Thursday.

He was the top ranked recruit in the 2024 recruiting class, and the highest-rated wide receiver recruit in modern recruiting history. Smith was born on November 29, 2005, in Miami Gardens, Florida,[1] He grew up in Hollywood, Florida. At 7 years old, Smith tried out for the Miami Gardens Ravens youth football team, but did not make it, an event hailed as a defining moment for Smith and his father, Chris, regarding his football career. The event caused Smith to begin taking training more seriously. The following year, Smith made the league and won its own version of the Heisman Trophy.[2][3] Smith later attended Chaminade-Madonna College Preparatory School.[4] He had 31 receptions for 667 yards and seven touchdowns in his sophomore season.[5][6] Smith caught 58 passes for 1,073 yards and 20 touchdowns as a junior.[7] He also won the FHSAA Class 2A state championship in the 110 and the 400-meter hurdles during his junior year.[8] During his senior season, Smith was named All-American, and won the All-American Bowl Player of the Year Award.[9] Smith was rated a five-star recruit and the top ranked prospect of the incoming 2024 college football class.[10][11][12] Smith was the highest ranked wide receiver recruit in the modern recruiting era (2000-present), surpassing Dorial Green-Beckham and Julio Jones.[13] Smith committed to play at Ohio State over offers from Florida, Florida State, Georgia, Miami, and USC.[14][15] In his college debut against the Akron Zips, Smith recorded six receptions for 92 yards and two touchdowns, leading the team in yardage for that game in a 52–6 win for Ohio State.[16] Smith was named Big Ten Conference Freshman of the Week after recording six touches for 102 yards and two touchdowns in a win against Michigan State.[17] On January 1, 2025, Jeremiah had 7 catches for 187 yards and 2 receiving touchdowns in an MVP performance against the Oregon Ducks in the 2025 Rose Bowl. Smith is the cousin of NFL quarterback Geno Smith.[18]",

                "title": "Jeremiah Smith NFL Draft outlook: Ranking Ohio State freshman superstar among recent Buckeyes WR prospects - CBSSports.com",
                "content": "If not listed, please contact your TV provider. Some think of LSU as \"Wide Receiver University.\" while others say it's Ohio State. The Tigers can claim Justin Jefferson, Ja'Marr Chase, Malik Nabers and Brian Thomas Jr. over the past five years. Ohio State has had 12 wideouts drafted in the past decade, including Michael Thomas, Terry McLaurin, Chris Olave, Garrett Wilson, Jaxon Smith-Njigba and Marvin Harrison Jr. And Buckeyes super freshman Jeremiah Smith is next in line. His 2024-25 season has allowed him to enter the pantheon of best true freshman years in college football history with the likes of Adrian Peterson, Herschel Walker, and Trevor Lawrence. The No. 1 overall recruit in the class of 2024 has played like a polished redshirt senior for the Buckeyes this season. So right now, where does Smith stack up among recent Buckeyes wideout prospects? Let's rank them. Important to remember here: This is how these players were universally viewed as prospects, factoring in off-field and maturity issues. Their NFL careers had no bearing on these rankings. Let's go! McLaurin's journey to where he is today -- a stud on a cusp of being a superstar at the receiver position -- is fascinating and unique. He was an \"old,\" minimally productive player on a loaded Ohio State roster. His best season came as a 23-year-old senior, and it was a good one with 35 grabs for 701 yards and 11 touchdowns. In the three years before that, McLaurin caught a grand total of 40 passes for 550 yards with eight scores. But McLaurin represents why traits, not productivity, are prioritized in the draft process. And there's an argument no one has crushed that process quite like McLaurin. He was uncoverable at the Senior Bowl that January in Mobile, Alabama, then ran a 4.35-second 40-yard dash at over 6-foot and nearly 210 pounds at the NFL Scouting Combine. There were still plenty of reservations about his one-year wonder status, and if he was simply a practice/workout warrior. Typing those reservations feels foolish now, but they represented legitimate concerns, which is why McLaurin wasn't picked earlier than the third round. However, him going that early was the culmination of a meteoric rise. Campbell was part of the track team the Buckeyes sent out there at receiver each week during the J.T. Barrett/Dwayne Haskins era. His career in Columbus swelled gradually, ending with a 90-grab, 1,063-yard, 11-score season in 2018. The true junior ran 4.31 with a 40-inch vertical at the combine and that was that. He was destined for the second round, and there thoughts he could sneak into the first. Decently raw in his routes and when it came to the finer details of playing the position, Campbell was viewed as simply too productive and too explosive to land in the third round and was generally liked by the masses. The 40th pick in the 2017 draft was a gadget, do-whatever-is-needed offensive weapon at Ohio State, with over 1,200 career receiving and 1,200 rushing yards in his three-year stint playing his home games inside The Horseshoe. While Samuel was a few years ahead of the \"wide back\" era we're seemingly in the thick of in today's NFL, there was plenty to be excited about regarding his potential as a multidimensional weapon. Far from incredibly polished as a receiver, Samuel's sheer speed -- another 4.31 guy! -- at 5-foot-11 and nearly 200 pounds made him a minimal-criticism selection by the Panthers early in Round 2 that year. Thomas' time as a prospect predates my time at CBS Sports, but I vividly remember him being widely viewed as underrated during the 2016 cycle, which looking back is interesting because he was initially dubbed as a second-round talent, so if many people thought he was being undervalued, it's strange he wasn't selected sooner. Ezekiel Elliott was the dude in Ohio State's offense for both of Thomas' seasons as a full-time player, but the 6-foot-3 wideout still managed more than 50 catches for at least 700 yards in each season, and he caught 18 total touchdowns. And the 2016 draft class of receivers was weird, man. The vast majority of us were wrong at the top. I mean, Corey Coleman then Will Fuller then Josh Doctson, Laquon Treadwell, Sterling Shepard and then Michael Thomas? Whoops. Even though he was the sixth receiver off the board in 2016, Thomas was seen as a safe selection. Good prospect. Olave's pedestrian yards-after-the-catch ability was the lone, consensus knock on him as a prospect. He flashed as early as his freshman season for the Buckeyes and rose to being a clear-cut, top-tier prospect by his junior campaign when he decided to return for one more go in Columbus. Blessed with impeccable ball-tracking skills and savvy route maneuverability, Olave was adored by the masses during his draft. When he was done at Ohio State, Olave's routes were viewed as more crisp than Smith-Njigba's are right now, but the latter was more explosive after the catch when the two were on the field together, there's no doubting that. And Smith-Njigba is nearly two years younger than Olave. It was Smith-Njigba who led the Buckeyes in receiving yards last year by more than 500 total yards. Now, he wasn't an elite athletic specimen with low 4.3 speed, but he played with serious suddenness, almost always reaching top speed faster than everyone else. Wilson was a conglomeration of Olave and Smith-Njigba -- he ran routes close to as sharp as Olave and played with comparable explosiveness to his younger counterpart with and without the football in his hands. And like Olave, everyone knew Wilson was destined for the first round after watching him in his freshman season for the Buckeyes. From dynamic run-after-the-catch splash plays to contested catches that appeared as though Wilson was afforded the luxury of bouncing off a trampoline, to scintillatingly fast go-route touchdowns, Wilson had it all from a skill and talent perspective, which is why he went ahead of Olave and secured a top-three spot in these rankings. Harrison looked like a future first-rounder as a freshman at Ohio State. He looked like an NFL veteran at 18 years old. Even with only 11 grabs for 139 yards with three touchdowns playing behind Wilson and Olave, it was reasonably obvious. Then he erupted as a true sophomore, with 77 catches for 1,263 yards and 14 touchdowns. And Harrison's status as an elite-level prospect wasn't simply a byproduct of stat accumulation. At his size -- 6-foot-3 and around 220 pounds -- with his long-striding speed and tremendous ball-tracking capabilities, he was tantalizing from a traits and skill perspective, which is why he was the No. 3 overall pick in last April's draft. The biggest difference between Smith -- as a true freshman -- and Harrison trait-wise is flexibility and smoothness running routes. Harrison moved outstandingly for a receiver his size but didn't have high-level fluidity when gliding at all levels of the field to routinely generate separation. On the vertical route tree, Harrison could run by most collegiate defensive backs then reel the ball in like an all-star center fielder. On intricate routes that asked him to throttle down and quickly change directions, there were labored movements. And after the catch, Harrison wasn't a superstar. Smith is. I'll just use the numbers to explain the disparity. In 2023, Harrison forced five missed tackles on 67 receptions (7.4%). Entering the College Football Playoff semifinal against Texas, Smith has forced 13 missed tackles on 70 receptions (18.5%). Smith is Harrison-sized, with clearly more fluidity as a full route-tree route runner, and is more of a weapon after the catch. He also tracks the football like a dominant upperclassmen, as he's won on 12 of 21 contested-catch opportunities to date this season. Smith, right now, is the best receiver prospect Ohio State has had in its recently ridiculously stacked history at the position. © 2004-2024 CBS Interactive. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.

                "content": "Every so often, there’s a college football player whose otherworldly excellence is apparent from the moment they first step on a field. This year, fans across the country have gotten to enjoy that kind of phenom. In his first season of college football, Ohio State wide receiver Jeremiah Smith has been a revelation. A top-ranked recruit in the 2024 class, Smith arrived in Columbus with enormous expectations and has not only matched them, but perhaps exceeded them. REQUIRED READING:How star safety Caleb Downs' role is evolving in Ohio State football defense He has been a crucial player for the Buckeyes throughout the season, but his biggest impact has come in recent weeks as his team has played in its most important games. In College Football Playoff victories against Tennessee and Oregon, he has 290 receiving yards and four touchdowns while routinely making highlight-reel-worthy plays. NFL STATS CENTRAL: The latest NFL scores, schedules, odds, stats and more. In Ohio State’s game against Texas Friday in the Cotton Bowl, perhaps no player will be more closely watched than Smith. His prodigious success has naturally drawn attention from those outside college football. Given what he has been able to accomplish at such an early stage of his college career, what might await him at the NFL level? And when will he be able to get there? Heading into Friday night’s College Football Playoff semifinal, here’s a closer look at Smith and when he can leave for the NFL: REQUIRED READING:Ohio State football winter transfer tracker 2024: Latest portal news, updates No, Smith is not eligible for the 2025 NFL Draft. Unlike college basketball, in which the top prospects can bounce for the NBA after a single season, freshmen in college football are not eligible to move on to the NFL, meaning Smith will remain at Ohio State beyond this season. Smith will be eligible to enter the NFL draft after his third season of college football, which will mean he can declare for the 2027 NFL Draft at the earliest. The NFL stipulates that in order to be eligible for the draft, a prospect must have been out of high school for at least three years and used up their eligibility before the start of the next college football season. Underclassmen and players who have graduated before exhausting all of their college eligibility “may request the league’s approval to enter the draft early.” Here are the full requirements and benchmarks that a player must reach in order to be eligible for the NFL draft, according to the NFL: REQUIRED READING:Texas QB Quinn Ewers has no regrets about his brief stay with Ohio State football team Born on Nov. 29, 2005, Smith is 19 years old. In his just freshman season, Smith has been one of the most productive players on a loaded Ohio State team this season. Heading into Friday’s game against Texas, Smith has 70 catches for 1,224 yards and 14 touchdowns while averaging 17.5 yards per reception. Smith additionally has five carries for 52 yards and a rushing touchdown. His receiving yardage and touchdown totals are not only team highs, but the most among Big Ten players. He’s sixth among all FBS players in receiving yards and tied for third in touchdown receptions. Coming out of Chaminade-Madonna Prep in Hollywood, Florida, Smith was rated as a five-star recruit and the No. 1 overall player nationally in the 2024 class, according to 247Sports’ composite rankings. He was the first player since 2012 listed by the website as a wide receiver to earn the No. 1 national ranking in his class. Travis Hunter, who went on to play wide receiver in college, was the No. 1 player in the 2022 class, but was listed as a cornerback.",

While his early-season highlights certainly put him higher on the national radar, Smith has stood out since high school. Entering this season, he already stood out as one of the most talented players of any position set to debut this year. A post shared by The Sporting News (@sportingnews) Smith has met expectations so far and clearly has a bright future ahead of him. But who is he? Here's everything to know about Smith, the Ohio State true freshman pass-catcher who is the Buckeyes' 2024 breakout star. MORE: College football scores and results from every Week 5 game Growing up in South Florida, Smith made a name for himself as a member of the Chaminade-Madonna Prep varsity football team. He was named the Maxwell Award High School Player of the Year and MaxPreps Florida Player of the Year his senior season, and he also won the Nat Moore Trophy—an honor given to the top high school player in Miami-Dade, Broward and Monroe counties. In his final two seasons with the Lions, Smith caught 151 passes for 2,474 yards and 39 touchdowns while playing 28 games. In 2023, Chaminade-Madonna Prep was the nation’s No. 2-ranked team and finished the season undefeated as state champions. Oh, and Smith also ran track, qualifying for the 110- and 400-meter hurdles at states three times and capturing gold medals in both races at Florida's 1A meet his junior year. A rare talent, Smith became the first wide receiver to earn a No. 1 overall ranking in the 247Sports composite in over a decade. The last pass-catcher to do so was Dorial Green-Beckham in 2012, who eventually had a short career in the NFL. Naturally, Smith was a five-star prospect on every major recruiting service, too. Drawing comparisons to Julio Jones, Smith accumulated 40 offers and ended up visiting five schools throughout his recruiting process. Eventually, he narrowed it down to two: Miami and Ohio State. The 6-3, 215 pound wide receiver committed to be a Buckeye in 2022 but did not sign his letter of intent until the following December, giving him time to pay the Canes a visit. But he stuck with Ohio State, enrolling in February and becoming integral member of the team's offense in 2024. \"The way they care about their players on and off the field,\" Smith said. \"They're one of the best for their players. It's a family up there in Ohio. Thanksgiving, you know, they'll have their players come over and eat with them, stuff like that. So, I mean, it's definitely a brotherhood up there in Columbus for sure.\" MORE: ESPN ranks Ohio State's Jeremiah Smith top college football freshman An established threat through the air, Smith has enjoyed an impressive start to his true freshman season. Here's a look at how Smith has performed so far through his first six games. Smith started the College Football Playoff with a bang, hauling in a 37-yard touchdown pass from Will Howard before adding an 18-yard grab on the following drive. Sarah Effress is an editorial intern for The Sporting News. She is a recent graduate of Northwestern University, and loves to talk soccer and women's college sports.",

                "content": "If not listed, please contact your TV provider. Only one more quarter stands between the Pacers and the win they were favored to collect coming into this evening. They have jumped out to a 80-70 lead against the Warriors. The Pacers entered the contest having won four straight and they're just one quarter away from another. Will they make it five, or will the Warriors step up and spoil it? We'll know soon. Golden State Warriors @ Indiana Pacers Current Records: Golden State 19-18, Indiana 20-18 Having just played yesterday, the Golden State Warriors will head out on the road to face off against the Indiana Pacers at 7:00 p.m. ET on Friday at Gainbridge Fieldhouse. The Warriors are expected to lose this one by 7.5 points, so we'll see if that gives them a bit of motivation. The Warriors are headed into this one after the oddsmakers set last week's over/under low at 221.5, but even that wound up being too high. They skirted past the Pistons 107-104. Having forecasted a close victory for Golden State, the oddsmakers were right on the money. The Warriors were working as a unit and finished the game with 32 assists. They easily outclassed their opponents in that department as the Pistons only posted 25. Meanwhile, the Pacers had already won three in a row (a stretch where they outscored their opponents by an average of 15 points) and they went ahead and made it four on Wednesday. They enjoyed a cozy 129-113 win over Chicago. Indiana pushed the score to 100-76 by the end of the third, a deficit Chicago cut but never quite recovered from. Multiple players turned in solid performances to lead the Pacers to victory, but perhaps none more so than Thomas Bryant, who went 9 for 16 en route to 22 points plus eight rebounds and two steals. Bryant continues to roll, besting his previous point total in each of the last three games he's played. Another player making a difference was Pascal Siakam, who went 11 for 17 en route to 26 points plus six rebounds. Golden State now has a winning record of 19-18. As for Indiana, they have been performing well recently as they've won five of their last six matches, which provided a massive bump to their 20-18 record this season. Friday's matchup is shaping up to be a scrappy game: The Warriors have crashing the boards this season, having averaged 46.6 rebounds per game (they're ranked third in rebounds per game overall). It's a different story for the Pacers, though, as they've been averaging only 41.4. Given the Warriors' sizable advantage in that area, the Pacers will need to find a way to close that gap. The Warriors came up short against the Pacers in their previous matchup back in December of 2024, falling 111-105. Can the Warriors avenge their defeat or is history doomed to repeat itself? We'll find out soon enough. Indiana is a big 7.5-point favorite against Golden State, according to the latest NBA odds. The oddsmakers had a good feel for the line for this one, as the game opened with the Pacers as a 6.5-point favorite. The over/under is 224 points.

                "content": "Zion Lateef Williamson (born July 6, 2000) is an American professional basketball player for the New Orleans Pelicans of the National Basketball Association (NBA). He plays the power forward position.[1] Following a freshman-year stint with the Duke Blue Devils, Williamson was selected by the Pelicans with the first overall pick in the 2019 NBA draft. He was named to the NBA All-Rookie First Team in 2020. In 2021, he became the fourth youngest NBA player to be selected to an All-Star game.[2] Born in Salisbury, North Carolina, Williamson attended Spartanburg Day School, where he was a consensus five-star recruit and was ranked among the top five players in the 2018 class. He led his team to three straight state championships and earned South Carolina Mr. Basketball recognition in his senior season. Williamson also left high school as a McDonald's All-American, runner-up for Mr. Basketball USA, and USA Today All-USA first team honoree. In high school, he drew national attention for his slam dunks. In his freshman and only season with Duke, Williamson was named ACC Player of the Year, ACC Athlete of the Year and ACC Rookie of the Year. He set the single-game school scoring record for freshmen in January 2019, claimed ACC Rookie of the Week accolades five times, earned AP Player of the Year, Sporting News College Player of the Year recognition, and won the Wayman Tisdale Award. On July 6, 2000,[1] Williamson was born in Salisbury, North Carolina to Lateef Williamson and Sharonda Sampson.[3] Lateef Williamson was a football defensive lineman at Mayo High School in Darlington, South Carolina, who was a High School All-American in 1993 and had committed to NC State before transferring to Livingstone College.[4][3] Sampson was a sprinter at Livingstone and became a middle school health and physical education teacher.[3] She named Williamson after the biblical location Mount Zion near Jerusalem, taking her grandmother's advice to name him \"something extra special.\"[5] When Williamson reached two years of age, following the death of his maternal grandmother, his family moved to Florence, South Carolina.[4][3] By the time he was five years old, his parents had divorced. His mother later married Lee Anderson, a former Clemson college basketball player.[6][4] Williamson is Baptist.[7] Besides basketball, Williamson played soccer and the quarterback position in football.[5] When he was five years old, he set sights on becoming a college basketball star. At age nine, Williamson began waking up every morning at 5 a.m. to train.[6] He competed in youth leagues with his mother Sharonda Sampson coaching and played for the Sumter Falcons on the Amateur Athletic Union (AAU) circuit, facing opponents four years older than he was.[4] Williamson later began working with his stepfather to improve his skills as a point guard.[6] He joined the basketball team at Johnakin Middle School in Marion, South Carolina, where he was again coached by his mother and averaged 20 points per game. In middle school, Williamson was a point guard and lost only three games in two years.[6] In 2013, he guided Johnakin to an 8–1 record and a conference title.[8] Williamson attended Spartanburg Day School, a small K–12 private school in Spartanburg, South Carolina, where he played basketball for the Griffins.[5] Between eighth and ninth grade, he grew from 5 ft 9 in (1.75 m) to 6 ft 3 in (1.91 m).[4] In the summer leading up to his first season, Williamson practiced in the school gym and developed the ability to dunk.[9] At the time, he competed for the South Carolina Hornets AAU team as well, where he was teammates with Ja Morant.[10] As a freshman, Williamson averaged 24.4 points, 9.4 rebounds, 2.8 assists, 3.3 steals and 3.0 blocks, earning All-State and All-Region honors.[11] He also led Spartanburg Day to a South Carolina Independent School Association (SCISA) state championship game appearance.[12] In March 2015, Williamson took part in the SCISA North-South All-Star Game in Sumter, South Carolina.[13] By his second year in high school, he stood 6 ft 6 in (1.98 m).[12] In his sophomore season, Williamson averaged 28.3 points, 10.4 rebounds, 3.9 blocks, and 2.7 steals per game and was named SCISA Region I-2A Player of the Year.[14] He led the Griffins to their first SCISA Region I-2A title in program history.[5] In June 2016, Williamson participated in the National Basketball Players Association (NBPA) Top 100 camp and was its leading scorer.[15] In August, he won the Under Armour Elite 24 showcase dunk contest in New York City.[16] As a junior, Williamson averaged 36.8 points, 13 rebounds, 3 steals, and 2.5 blocks per game.[17] Starting in the 2016–17 season, Williamson was propelled into the national spotlight for his viral highlight videos.[18] In a 73–53 victory over Gray Collegiate Academy at the Chick-fil-A Classic on December 21, he posted a tournament-record 53 points and 16 rebounds, shooting 25-of-28 from the field.[19] On December 30, Williamson recorded 31 points and 14 rebounds to win most valuable player (MVP) at the Farm Bureau Insurance Classic.[20] On January 15, 2017, he received nationwide publicity after rapper Drake wore his jersey in an Instagram post.[21] Williamson surpassed the 2,000-point barrier on January 20, when he tallied 48 points against Oakbrook Preparatory School.[22] On February 14, he led Spartanburg Day past Oakbrook Prep for their first SCISA Region I-2A title, chipping in a game-high 37 points in a 105–49 rout. Williamson broke the state record for most 30-point games in a season, with 27 by the end of the regular season.[23] He repeated as SCISA Region I-2A Player of the Year.[17] High school sports website MaxPreps named him National Junior of the Year and to the High School All-American first team, while USA Today High School Sports gave him All-USA first team recognition.[24][25][26] In June, he appeared on the cover of basketball magazine Slam.[27] In his senior season, Williamson averaged 36.4 points, 11.4 rebounds and 3.5 assists per game.[28] On January 13, 2018, in a nationally televised game at the Hoophall Classic, he scored 36 points as his team lost to Chino Hills High School.[29] On February 17, he posted 37 points, 10 rebounds, and 5 steals, while scoring his 3,000th career point, versus Spartanburg Christian Academy at the SCISA Region I-2A tournament.[30] One week later, Williamson guided Spartanburg Day to its third consecutive SCISA Region I-2A championship after recording 38 points against Trinity Collegiate School.[31] On March 28, Williamson played in the 2018 McDonald's All-American Game, where he scored 8 points in 17 minutes before leaving with a thumb injury.[32][33] The injury also forced him to miss the Jordan Brand Classic and Nike Hoop Summit in the following month.[34] For his 2017–18 high school season, Williamson was named to the USA Today All-USA first team and MaxPreps All-American second team.[35][36] He additionally earned South Carolina Mr. Basketball recognition and was runner-up for Mr. Basketball USA.[37][38] Wofford offered Williamson his first college basketball scholarship when he was a freshman in high school.[39] By the end of his sophomore season, he had received offers from 16 NCAA Division I programs, including Clemson, Florida, and South Carolina.[14] On August 30, 2016, he received a scholarship offer from Duke.[40] Entering his junior season, he was a consensus five-star recruit and was ranked the number one player in the 2018 class by recruiting service 247Sports.[41] In a live ESPN telecast on January 20, 2018, Williamson committed to Duke.[42][43] He explained the decision, stating: \"Duke stood out because the brotherhood represents a family. (Mike Krzyzewski) is just the most legendary coach that ever coached college basketball. I feel like going to Duke University, I can learn a lot from him.\"[43] Duke, who had landed RJ Barrett and Cam Reddish in addition to Williamson, became the first team to land the top three recruits in a class since modern recruiting rankings began.[44] Williamson's stepfather, Lee Anderson, remarked that Clemson lost a \"mile-and-a-half lead\" in recruiting Williamson.[45] Sources: On November 6, 2018, in his first regular season game with Duke, Williamson scored 28 points on 11-of-13 shooting in 23 minutes in a 118–84 win over Kentucky at the Champions Classic.[46] In that game, he and teammate RJ Barrett each broke the Duke freshman debut scoring record set by Marvin Bagley III.[47] In his following game, a 94–72 victory over Army, Williamson tallied 27 points, 16 rebounds, and six blocks.[48] He became the second player in school history to record at least 25 points, 15 rebounds, and 5 blocks in a game.[49] Williamson was subsequently named both player and freshman of the week in the Atlantic Coast Conference (ACC).[49] On January 5, 2019, he had another strong performance versus Clemson, with 25 points, 10 rebounds, and a 360-degree dunk in 22 minutes.[50] Two days later, Williamson earned ACC Freshman of the Week honors for a second time.[51] On January 12, against Florida State, he was poked in the left eye by an opposing player towards the second half and missed the remainder of the game.[52] Williamson returned in Duke's next game, a 95–91 overtime loss to Syracuse, and erupted for 35 points, 10 rebounds, and 4 blocks.[53] He eclipsed the Duke freshman record for single-game points previously held by Marvin Bagley III and JJ Redick.[54] On January 21, Williamson collected his third ACC Freshman of the Week accolade.[55] One week later, he scored 26 points and grabbed 9 rebounds in an 81–63 victory over Notre Dame.[56] By recording nine 25-point games in the season, Williamson set a new Duke freshman record.[57] On February 4, 2019, Williamson was named ACC Freshman of the Week on his fourth occasion, while earning a National Player of the Week distinction from the Naismith Trophy.[58] He had his third 30-point game of the season on February 16, scoring 32 points in a 94–78 victory over NC State.[59] The performance helped him claim his second ACC Player of the Week and fifth ACC Freshman of the Week accolades.[60] In a February 20 game versus North Carolina, Williamson suffered a Grade 1 knee sprain 36 seconds into the contest after his foot ripped through his Nike shoe, causing him to slip.[61][62] He did not return to the game, which Duke lost, 88–72.[63] Nike saw the value of its stock drop by $1.1 billion the following day as a result of the incident.[64][65] The injury resulted in criticism of the NCAA for not paying student-athletes.[66][67][68] Williamson was held out from the final six games of the regular season.[69] When the regular season concluded, Williamson earned Player of the Year and Rookie of the Year honors in the ACC, joining former Duke players Jahlil Okafor and Marvin Bagley III as the only recipients of both awards. Williamson was also named ACC Athlete of the Year, becoming the 10th Duke player to win the Award.[70] He additionally made the ACC All-Defensive and All-Freshman teams.[71] Sporting News named Williamson as its Player of the Year and Freshman of the Year.[72] Williamson returned from injury on March 14, posting 29 points, 14 rebounds, and 5 steals in an 84–72 win over Syracuse in the quarterfinals of the ACC tournament.[73] He shot 13-of-13 from the field, marking the best shooting performance in school and tournament history, while tying the record for the best shooting performance in ACC history.[74] Williamson also became the first Duke player to record at least 25 points, 10 rebounds, and 5 steals in a game since Christian Laettner did so in 1992.[75] The next day, he scored 31 points (including the game-winning shot) to help Duke defeat North Carolina, 74–73, in the ACC Tournament semifinals.[76] After posting 21 points in a 73–63 victory over Florida State in the championship game, Williamson was named ACC Tournament MVP, becoming the sixth freshman to win the honor.[77] For the 2019 NCAA tournament, official broadcast partner CBS specifically devoted a camera—called the \"Zion Cam\"—to record Williamson throughout the tournament.[78] In his NCAA Tournament debut on March 22, he scored 25 points in an 85–62 win over 16th-seeded North Dakota State.[79] On March 24, Williamson erupted for 32 points, 11 rebounds, and four assists in a 77–76 second-round victory over UCF.[80] Williamson led all scorers on March 31, with 24 points and 14 rebounds in a season-ending 68–67 loss to Michigan State in the Elite 8.[81] In 33 appearances in his freshman season, he averaged 22.6 points, 8.9 rebounds, 2.1 steals, and 1.8 blocks per game.[82] He shot 68% from the field, which led the ACC, ranked second in the NCAA Division I, and was the highest-ever field goal percentage by a freshman.[83][84] In addition, Williamson joined Kevin Durant and Anthony Davis as one of the only freshmen in history to collect 500 points, 50 steals, and 50 blocks in a season.[84] On April 15, 2019, Williamson declared his eligibility for the 2019 NBA draft.[85] On June 20, 2019, the New Orleans Pelicans drafted Williamson with the first pick in the 2019 NBA draft.[86][87][88] On July 1, 2019, Williamson officially signed with the Pelicans.[89] Williamson tore his meniscus on October 13, 2019, during the preseason of his rookie campaign.[90] Williamson made his professional debut three months later on January 22, 2020, in a 121–117 loss to the San Antonio Spurs. He played 18 minutes and finished with 22 points and 7 rebounds, scoring 17 consecutive points in 3:08 minutes during the fourth quarter.[91] In his first eight games, Williamson scored at least 20 points in four consecutive games, the longest streak by any rookie of the season; he also tied the longest streak in the Pelicans franchise history, scoring at least 20 points in six of his eight games, and tying the record for the seventh-most among all rookies (fellow rookie Ja Morant had the most with 19) after a 125–119 win over the Chicago Bulls on February 7.[92] On February 24, he led the Pelicans to a 115–101 win over the Golden State Warriors. With 28 points on 13/20 shooting in a season-high 33 minutes of play, Williamson was just one game behind Carmelo Anthony for most consecutive 20-point games as a teenager at 8.[93] He would later become the first teenager in NBA history to score at least 20 points in 10 consecutive games.[94] On March 1, Williamson scored then career-high 35 points, along with 7 rebounds, in a 122–114 loss to the Los Angeles Lakers.[95] Williamson finished his rookie season averaging 22.5 points on 58.3 percent shooting from the floor, 6.3 rebounds, and 2.1 assists per game. He ranked first among all rookies in points per game, second in rebounds per game and first in offensive rebounds per game. He became the first rookie since Michael Jordan to post 16 20-point games within their first 20 contests while also logging the highest scoring average through his first 24 career NBA games since Jordan in 1983.[96] On September 15, Williamson was named to the NBA All-Rookie First Team.[96][97][98] On February 12, 2021, Williamson scored a then career high 36 points in a 143–130 defeat against the Dallas Mavericks; he finished the game on 14-of-15 shooting from the field, making him the youngest player in NBA history with 30 points on 90 percent shooting.[99] On February 23, 2021, Williamson was selected into his first NBA All-Star Game.[2] On March 21, 2021, Williamson scored 30 points and 6 rebounds in a 113–108 win over the Denver Nuggets.[100] During the season, Williamson tied Kareem Abdul-Jabbar's record for the longest streak of at least 20-point games on 50-percent shooting within his first two seasons since the shot clock era in 1954–55. The streak eventually grew to 25 consecutive games, surpassing Hall-of-Famers Wilt Chamberlain and Karl Malone[101][102] while tying Shaquille O'Neal's record of 25 consecutive such games,[103] with no other player having had a longer streak since the three-point era in 1980; his streak of 20-points games on 50-percent shooting and attempt to surpass O'Neal's record ended in a 139–111 loss to the Brooklyn Nets on April 7.[104] During the off-season, Williamson suffered a Jones fracture in his right foot and underwent a subsequent surgery. In late-September, team officials were hopeful that he would be ready to return by the start of the season.[105] By mid-October, the timeline for his expected return was extended until December.[106] In mid-December, it was announced that the injury was slow to heal and he would most likely be out another four to six weeks with a possible return to action around the all-star break.[107] In mid-March, it was announced that Williamson would not play that season.[108] On July 6, 2022, Williamson signed a five-year rookie extension with the New Orleans Pelicans worth $193 million guaranteed, increasing to $231 million if he made an All-NBA team in the 2022–2023 season.[109] Williamson made his return from injury on October 4, 2022, putting up 13 points, four rebounds, one assist, and one steal in a 129–125 preseason win over the Chicago Bulls.[110] On October 19, Williamson made his regular season return, putting up 25 points, nine rebounds, three assists, and four steals in a 130–108 win over the Brooklyn Nets.[111] On December 2, Williamson scored 30 points and matched career highs with 15 rebounds and eight assists in an 117–99 win over the San Antonio Spurs.[112] On December 9, Zion put up a then season-high 35 points, along with seven rebounds, four steals, and one block in a 126–117 win against the Phoenix Suns. A final dunk he made in the last seconds of the game caused an altercation between the Pelicans and Suns.[113] On December 12, Williamson was named the NBA Western Conference Player of the Week for Week 8 (December 5–11), his first NBA Player of the Week award. He led New Orleans to an undefeated 3–0 week with averages of 33.0 points and 8.3 rebounds on 70.4% shooting from the field.[114] On December 28, Williamson put up a career-high 43 points in a 119–118 win over the Minnesota Timberwolves.[115] Williamson was sidelined on January 2, 2023, with a hamstring injury. At first, team officials were hopeful that he would be ready to return by the end of January.[116] On January 26, 2023, Williamson was selected for his second NBA All-Star appearance.[117] However, due to his unavailability, Williamson was replaced by Anthony Edwards.[118] On February 13, team officials indicated that Williamson would miss multiple weeks after the All-Star break.[119] Subsequently, team officials confirmed in early April that Williamson would miss the remainder of the regular season.[120] Subsequently, Williamson sat out the Pelicans appearance in their play-in game against the Oklahoma City Thunder, which New Orleans lost, ending their season.[121] On November 29, 2023, Wiliamson recorded 33 points on 11-of-12 shooting from the field, 11-of-12 from the free throw line along with eight rebounds, six assists, and three steals in a 124–114 win over the Philadelphia 76ers.[122] On February 2, 2024, Williamson put up 33 points, eight rebounds, and a game-winning layup in a 114–113 win over the San Antonio Spurs.[123] On April 16, Wiliamson in his first play-in appearance scored 40 points, grabbed 11 rebounds and dished out 5 assists in a 110–106 loss against the Los Angeles Lakers. His NBA postseason debut was cut short by an injury in the final minutes of the game.[124] Williamson is listed at 6 ft 6 in (1.98 m) tall and weighs 284 pounds (129 kg).[125][126] Despite his heavy weight for a basketball player, he is known for his speed and leaping ability.[127][128] NBA player Kevin Durant described him as a \"once-in-a-generation type athlete\" while an anonymous college basketball coach labeled him a \"freak of nature.\"[129][130] Williamson plays the power forward position but is also capable of being a small-ball center.[131] He has been described as not fitting a specific basketball position.[132] His physical attributes have drawn comparisons to former NBA stars Charles Barkley, Anthony Mason, and Larry Johnson.[133][134] In addition, according to different analysts, he resembles NBA players LeBron James and Julius Randle.[132] Lee Sartor, Williamson's high school coach, reported that basketball coach Roy Williams told Williamson \"that he was probably one of the best high school players he's seen since Michael Jordan.\"[135] Williamson, who is left-handed, is almost ambidextrous.[132] While in high school, Williamson drew national attention for his slam dunks.[136] The Charlotte Observer remarked that he \"could be the best high-school dunker in history.\"[137] NBA point guard John Wall has likened Williamson's in-game dunking ability to that of Vince Carter.[138] Williamson's outside shooting has been considered a point of concern, and he has unorthodox shot mechanics.[4][9][139] Recruiting service 247Sports has praised his ball handling and passing skills for his size, commenting that they are \"overshadowed by [his] athletic plays.\"[140] Williamson has the ability to defend multiple positions well due to his speed and length, although his defensive effort has been questioned.[141] He is a skilled shot-blocker and rebounder.[142] At various points during his NBA career, Williamson has received criticism in the media from basketball observers who perceive him to be overweight.[143][144][145][146] Prior to the start of the 2021–2022 season, Williamson's weight increased to over 300 lbs.[145] Williamson lost weight in 2022.[147] In 2023, however, retired basketball players Charles Barkley and Shaquille O'Neal each expressed concerns about Williamson's weight.[148][149] Williamson's 2022 contract extension with the New Orleans Pelicans provides for salary reductions in the event that Williamson fails to maintain his weight and body fat percentage at specified levels.[150] Since the inaugural In-Season Tournament during the 2023 season, Williamson has seen significant improvements to his physique, losing 25 lbs.[151] On July 23, 2019, Williamson signed a five-year, $75 million shoe deal with Jordan brand.[152] Williamson's deal is the second-largest rookie shoe deal in history, trailing only LeBron James's $90 million rookie deal signed in 2003.[153] On March 13, 2020, Williamson pledged to pay for the salaries of all the employees of the Smoothie King Center for 30 days during the suspension of the 2019–20 NBA season, which was caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. He was one of several basketball players to help the arena workers.[154] In June 2023, Williamson announced his girlfriend's pregnancy in a baby shower YouTube video with the couple expecting a daughter due in November.[155] This announcement led adult film star Moriah Mills to claim on Twitter that she had a recent affair with Williamson.[156]",

                "content": "Editions: En/basketball/nba/new-orleans-pelicans The Pelicans forward missed 27 games due to injury but now faces a one-game suspension for violating team policies. Zion Williamson's much-anticipated return to basketball has been met with unexpected hurdles. Less than a week after rejoining the New Orleans Pelicans following a 27-game absence due to a hamstring injury, the 24-year-old forward has been suspended for one game for violating team policies. The Pelicans announced on Friday that Williamson would sit out the team's game against the Philadelphia 76ers that evening. He is expected to rejoin the roster over the weekend. According to Shams Charania of ESPN, the suspension stems from Williamson arriving late for the team's flight to Philadelphia. Tuesday marked Williamson's first game since his extended injury hiatus, and he delivered an impressive performance against the Minnesota Timberwolves. The two-time All-Star recorded 22 points, six rebounds, four assists, three steals, and one block in 28 minutes on the court. However, his momentum was interrupted when he sat out Wednesday's game due to team protocol for back-to-back matchups. Despite having played only seven games this season, Williamson has shown flashes of his All-Star potential. He's currently averaging 22.6 points, 7.7 rebounds, and 5.1 assists per game, along with notable defensive stats. His contributions on both ends of the floor remain vital for the Pelicans, who are striving for playoff contention. Williamson's journey back to full form has been marred by both injuries and off-court challenges. The Pelicans, who selected him first overall in the 2019 NBA Draft, continue to depend on his leadership and athleticism. However, the recent suspension raises questions about his commitment and focus as he works to solidify his presence on the court. Fans and analysts alike are watching closely to see how Williamson bounces back from this setback. While his suspension is a minor hiccup in the grand scheme, it adds to the narrative of an already tumultuous season. With his immense talent and potential, the hope remains that Williamson will overcome these challenges and lead the Pelicans to success. As the weekend approaches, all eyes will be on his return to the lineup and his ability to maintain consistency both on and off the court. © Unidad Editorial Información Deportiva, S.L.U.

                "title": "What's next for Zion Williamson? The 'hardest question in the NBA' - ESPN",
                "content": "Ramona Shelburne and Tim Bontemps discuss Zion Williamson being ranked No. 16 on ESPN's NBA top 25 under 25 list. (1:23) With a driving floater over Los Angeles Lakers big man Anthony Davis, Zion Williamson tied the score with just over three minutes remaining in the New Orleans Pelicans' first-round play-in game and sent the fans at the Smoothie King Center into a frenzy. Williamson's fourth basket in four minutes marked a team-high 40 points, giving fans what they hoped to see since the Pelicans drafted him No. 1 overall in 2019. But Williamson landed awkwardly and limped off the floor with a towel over his head during the next timeout. He didn't play the rest of the game and ultimately the remainder of the postseason, the familiar pain in his left hamstring prematurely ending another Pelicans season. Williamson could only watch as the top-seeded Oklahoma City Thunder swept New Orleans in the first round. Williamson played in a career-high 70 games last season, but it was the second playoff trip he missed due to injury. Six seasons into his career, he has yet to play in a playoff game. \"He's dominant when he plays,\" a rival general manager told ESPN. \"But when's the last time you've seen him play?\" The answer: Nov. 6, when Williamson scored 29 points in 29 minutes in a loss to the Cleveland Cavaliers. He missed the previous two games because of left hamstring tightness and has been sidelined since due to a strain in that muscle. At this point, Williamson's career has been defined more by his durability issues -- and conditioning concerns -- than his sensational drives and dunks. He has played only 190 games (plus the one abbreviated play-in outing) in 5½ seasons since arriving in New Orleans with hope and hype of being a franchise savior. Williamson's extensive injury history is why he agreed to one of the rarest contracts in NBA history: a maximum deal that requires him to earn guaranteed money as he goes, which could factor into Williamson's trade value if New Orleans explores the market for him. His $36.2 million salary for this season becomes fully guaranteed Jan. 7. As a result, Williamson and the Pelicans could be approaching a crossroads. Should the Pelicans continue to build around an incredible talent who has proven thus far to be a poor foundation for a franchise? Are there better alternatives? Right now, the 5-28 Pelicans, whose playoff hopes have been destroyed by a series of injuries to the rotation, are focused on moving one of Williamson's teammates ahead of the Feb. 6 trade deadline. Finding a trade for injured forward Brandon Ingram, a one-time All-Star in a contract year whose extension talks have repeatedly fizzled, is the priority for the Pelicans' front office, sources told ESPN. Williamson changed representation after suffering the latest injury, hiring WME's Bill Duffy, a longtime agent who also represents stars such as Luka Doncic, Anthony Edwards and Chet Holmgren. Sources told ESPN that Duffy has no intention to push for the Pelicans to trade Williamson before the deadline. The team announced Dec. 24 that Williamson will be \"week-to-week going forward\" after his expected return to practice in the final days of December. The focus -- for all parties involved -- is to get Williamson back on the floor without further injury interruption. \"Let's ramp him up and create value for him,\" a source said, \"whether that's with the Pelicans or another team.\" The Pelicans wrote multiple escape clauses into the five-year, $197 million extension Williamson signed after missing the 2021-22 season. New Orleans paid Williamson as a franchise player but included language that protected the franchise if Williamson missed more than 22 games in the 2022-23 or 2023-24 season. He missed 53 in 2022-23, meaning Williamson's salaries in the remaining three seasons ($38.9 million in 2025-26, $41.5 million in 2026-27 and $44.2 million in 2027-28) are non-guaranteed. \"It is one the best contracts in the NBA,\" an Eastern Conference executive told ESPN. \"But looking back, it is hard to argue that any team would have guaranteed Zion $197 million without conditions in the extension.\" There are mechanisms for the non-guaranteed seasons to become fully or partially protected if Williamson satisfies weigh-in criteria set by New Orleans -- there are seven such dates during the season, with Williamson needing a combined weight and body fat percentage below 295 -- and plays in a certain number of games in the previous season. He would have to meet these criteria in the prior season for his contract to become partially or fully protected in the next season: 20% if Williamson satisfies the weigh-in criteria 40% if he plays in 41 games 20% if he plays in 51 games 20% if he plays in 61 games For example, if Williamson played in 61 games this season and meets the weigh-in criteria, his $38.9 million salary in 2025-26 would be guaranteed. The remaining two seasons, however, would remain non-guaranteed. Sources told ESPN that Williamson is on track to reach the weight benchmarks, however, he has already missed 26 games this season, making it impossible for him to hit the 61-game mark. Once the weight clause criteria is met, the guaranteed portion for next season increases from $0 to $7.8 million. The non-guaranteed portion of his salary becomes guaranteed if Williamson is on the roster after 5 p.m. ET on July 15. But missing the benchmarks doesn't reduce Williamson's salary -- just the amount that is guaranteed. To receive any financial benefit, New Orleans would have to take the unprecedented step of waiving Williamson. However, the Pelicans do not consider releasing Williamson to create financial flexibility to be a feasible option, according to sources with knowledge of the franchise's thinking. The small-market Pelicans know they never have been considered an attractive destination for free agents, so they don't believe slicing payroll by releasing Williamson would be a realistic path to improving the roster. In the unlikely scenario that New Orleans waives Williamson before July 15, when $38.9 million of his salary for 2025-26 becomes guaranteed, the Pelicans could have up to $30 million in cap space -- but would have to replace both Williamson and Ingram, who account for a combined 45 points per game when healthy. Still, even without releasing Williamson, the unique structure of his contract could be a valuable tool for the Pelicans. Kendrick Perkins explains why he would like to see Zion Williamson traded to the Warriors. If the Pelicans and Williamson eventually part ways, it probably would be much different from the previous two times New Orleans traded its face of the franchise. Chris Paul and Anthony Davis succeeded in forcing their way out of town despite the franchise's desire to keep the future Hall of Famers. This time, it could be the Pelicans who reach the conclusion that it's in the franchise's best interests to move on from Williamson. One East executive, however, called gauging Williamson's trade value \"the hardest question to answer in the NBA right now.\" \"It's really hard to see anybody paying a ton for him right now, but there are a very limited number of players in the league when healthy who are at or near the franchise-player tier,\" the East executive said. \"The only way you win at the highest level is to have a guy who can do the type of things he can do if he's healthy. \"I would probably do something stupid to get him if it were me making decisions.\" One executive suggested that the Pelicans could benefit by trading Williamson as a contract, not a talent. Such a deal would require finding a trade partner, likely a team that has crossed into the harsh second apron of the salary cap, that is desperate for financial relief. There's still time to join or create a league in the No. 1 Fantasy basketball game. Your league starts fresh on the first scoring period following your draft. Create or join a fantasy basketball league on ESPN. Your championship run starts today! Sign up today! In this scenario, the Pelicans could flip Williamson's cuttable contract into a quality player (or two). Perhaps the Pelicans could even squeeze some draft capital out of the deal. \"That makes sense,\" one general manager said when asked about the possibility. \"But who are they going to get? Khris Middleton?\" There could also be a middle ground for a trade suitor. Willamson's contract would allow a team to acquire a superstar on a trial basis. Several executives polled agreed that Williamson's talent -- as rarely as it has been on display -- would still generate some interest in the trade market. As one general manager said, \"We've seen worse players have value despite injuries.\" Added another: \"It's a risk, but some team might take the risk.\" ESPN talked to two team executives at the recent G-League showcase in Orlando and both pointed to Golden State as a logical fit for Williamson. The Warriors have $40 million in expiring contracts, up to three first-round picks to trade, young players in Jonathan Kuminga, Brandin Podziemski and the $26.2 million salary of Andrew Wiggins. As ESPN's Shams Charania reported in December, the Warriors are exploring the market for an All-Star to pair next to Stephen Curry. After winning the title in 2022, the Warriors failed to reach the playoffs in 2023. They are currently fighting for a play-in spot and have just four wins this month. A GM brainstorming potential Williamson deals mentioned the Chicago Bulls, who have been shopping guard Zach LaVine for several months, as a possible fit. LaVine, 29, has his own durability issues and a contract due to pay him $95 million over the next two seasons. But he has reminded the league of his talent level by averaging 22.0 points per game with a 63.4% true shooting percentage this season. \"I bet Chicago would do that,\" the general manager said of a hypothetical deal built around swapping Williamson for LaVine. After pondering it for a few seconds, the GM said he'd decline such an offer if he were running the Pelicans. An executive for another team speculated that the market for Williamson at this point would be a late first-round pick and salary filler for a good team willing to gamble that he could vault it into contender status. \"Take a swing and work on his body,\" the executive said. \"It would be complicated with his salary, but I think it would be doable.\" Other league sources believed that if the Pelicans moved Williamson, their best bet would be reaching out to rebuilding teams. \"Maybe there's a bad team that needs a star,\" another West executive said. \"I don't think he's getting a premium picks package, but the guy has proven that when he's healthy, he's a star.\"",

(Photo by Billie Weiss/Getty Images) (Photo by Billie Weiss/Getty Images) BY BRENDEN NUNES Sactown Sports writer Riding a five-game win streak and 5-1 record since naming Doug Christie interim head coach, the Sacramento Kings looked to continue streaking as they began a three-game road trip in TD Garden against the Boston Celtics. They did just that, holding the high-powered Celtics offense to double-digits en route to their 114-97 victory. Without De’Aaron Fox for the third straight night, the Kings got notable contributions from across the board. Domantas Sabonis led the way with an absurd statline, recording 23 points, 28 rebounds, and three assists on 10/15 shooting, including 3/4 from three. DeMar DeRozan scored half of his 24 points in the fourth quarter. Malik Monk added 22 of his own while Keegan Murray (19) and Devin Carter (11) helped from the perimeter. 16 offensive rebounds, winning the turnover battle, and holding a Boston team that averages a league-high 49.8 three-point attempts per game to 11/41 from distance made all the difference. Playing in their third straight games without De’Aaron Fox, the Sacramento Kings hoped to extend their winning streak to six on the road against the defending champions. The Boston Celtics shoot more triples (49.8) than any other NBA team, but it was the Kings who came out hot. With no Fox, Keon Ellis got his third consecutive start alongside Malik Monk. Monk and Domantas Sabonis controlled the pace early while finding and creating spray triples for their teammates. By the end of the first quarter, Sacramento was 8/18 from three compared to Boston’s 4/14. Keegan Murray (2/2), Sabonis (2/3), and Monk (2/4) each had a pair of made threes. Keegan “back-to-back threes” Murray 🏹 pic.twitter.com/UBwSrgwT2p — Sacramento Kings (@SacramentoKings) January 11, 2025 That stellar offensive production left the Kings with a 34-27 lead at the end of the opening frame. Of course, there was plenty of time remaining for the Celtics high-powered offense to find a rhythm. With no Fox, larger creation responsibility is placed on DeRozan, Monk, and Sabonis. Sacramento’s lineup at the start of the second quarter — Carter/Huerter/DeRozan/Murray/Lyles — played with a significantly slower pace compared to their eccentric start. It’s understandable with DeRozan being the featured guy, but it’s still a jarring difference. That group allowed most of a big 16-3 run in Boston’s favor. It was the worst stretch of a poor entire second quarter, where the Kings were outscored 28-19. They followed up a red-hot first quarter from three by shooting 1/12 from deep in the second quarter. Jayson Tatum, Jaylen Brown, and Kristaps Porzingis, hunted favorable mismatches against Sacramento’s switching defense, leading their team to a narrow 55-53 advantage at the midway point. Monk had a game-high 14 points and four assists on 6/12 from the field, getting more opportunity without Fox next to him. Trey Lyles had four of the Kings’ seven offensive rebounds, speaking to his effort levels in 15 minutes of action. As usual, Sabonis also made his impact felt on the glass. He had 20 rebounds by midway through the third. It’s his fifth time recording 20 or more rebounds in a game this season, which is the most in the NBA. Both sides seemed to be crawling along to start the second half, with a lack of pace that favored the Celtics. A stretch of forcing turnovers and securing more offensive rebounds allowed the Kings to stick around despite DeRozan’s inability to get rolling. Tied at 76 going into the final frame, it had been somewhat of a defensive battle. Rookie Devin Carter started to get going in the fourth. The 2024 lottery pick scored eight points in the first few minutes of the quarter of his fourth NBA game, including back-to-back triples over Porzingis.

Crazy arc on his jumper. pic.twitter.com/8zWc8jwQN2 — Brenden Nunes (@BrendenNunesNBA) January 11, 2025 His efforts and the continued greatness of Sabonis propelled Sacramento to a 16-5 run to start the fourth. Those two were the original late-game energy creators, but Murray kept the momentum rolling in their favor. Before they left for this three-game road trip, the third-year forward said he finally felt like himself again, and it’s showing. His fourth triple of the night gave the Kings a 97-83 lead with six and a half minutes of action remaining. Providence head coach Kim English was in the building to watch Carter, who got a chance to play big minutes alongside the four other starters late until Lyles eventually replaced him around the 4:30 mark. Dealing with a notable advantage down the stretch, the clock played in Sacramento’s favor. Hitting occasional shots, forcing turnovers, and securing offensive rebounds allowed them to maintain that lead until the final buzzer in TD Garden. Despite a slow start, DeRozan turned it on in the fourth quarter with 12 points and four assists on 4/6 shooting in the quarter. It was a team-wide effort and probably Sacramento’s best win of the season, extending their streak to six straight. Thank you for reading SactownSports.com.

BOSTON (AP) Domantas Sabonis had 23 points and a career-high 28 rebounds and the Sacramento Kings used a fourth quarter rally to beat the Boston Celtics 114-97 on Friday night. The victory extended Sacramento's season-high win streak to six games. It was Sabonis’ 33rd double-double of the season and 24th game of his career with 20 or more rebounds. Entering Friday, the NBA’s previous high for rebounds in a game this season was 23 by San Antonio's Victor Wembanyama. DeMar DeRozan added 24 points and nine assists, and Malik Monk finished with 22 points and eight assists. Boston has lost two of its last three. Jaylen Brown led the Celtics with 28 points, Kristaps Porzingis added 22 points and 10 rebounds, and Jayson Tatum had 15 points and 12 rebounds. The game was tied at 76 after three quarters. Sacramento then took command, opening the fourth on a 24-9 run to take a 100-85 lead with 6:03 to play. Kings: Another strong effort by Sacramento, which outscored Boston 48-40 in the paint and held a 56-43 rebounding edge. And they did it without De’Aaron Fox, who missed his third straight game with a bruised glute. Celtics: After a 3-1 road trip that included wins over Minnesota and Denver, Boston dropped to 13-7 at TD Garden this season. With the Kings leading 84-79, Sabonis grabbed his 24th rebound of the game and stepped back for an uncontested 3-pointer as part of Sacramento’s run to open the fourth quarter. It was a microcosm of a night in which the Kings outhustled the Celtics to loose balls. Sacramento outscored Boston 38-21 in the final period. Tatum’s eight turnovers are most by a Celtics player this season.

                "title": "Ben Jonson - Wikipedia",
                "content": "Benjamin Jonson (c. 11 June 1572 – 18 August [O.S. 6 August] 1637) was an English playwright and poet. Jonson's artistry exerted a lasting influence on English poetry and stage comedy. He popularised the comedy of humours; he is best known for the satirical plays Every Man in His Humour (1598), Volpone, or The Fox (c. 1606), The Alchemist (1610) and Bartholomew Fair (1614) and for his lyric and epigrammatic poetry.[1] He is regarded as \"the second most important English dramatist, after William Shakespeare, during the reign of James I.\"[2] Jonson was a classically educated, well-read and cultured man of the English Renaissance with an appetite for controversy (personal and political, artistic and intellectual) whose cultural influence was of unparalleled breadth upon the playwrights and the poets of the Jacobean era (1603–1625) and of the Caroline era (1625–1642).[3][4] Jonson was born in June 1572[5]—possibly on the 11th[2][6][7]—in or near London. In midlife, Jonson said his paternal grandfather, who \"served King Henry 8 and was a gentleman\",[7] was a member of the extended Johnston family of Annandale in the Dumfries and Galloway, a genealogy that is attested by the three spindles (rhombi) in the Jonson family coat of arms: one spindle is a diamond-shaped heraldic device used by the Johnston family. His ancestors spelt the family name with a letter \"t\" (Johnstone or Johnstoun). While the spelling had eventually changed to the more common \"Johnson\", the playwright's own particular preference became \"Jonson\".[8] Jonson's father lost his property, was imprisoned, and, as a Protestant, suffered forfeiture under Queen Mary. Becoming a clergyman upon his release, he died a month before his son's birth.[7] His widow married a master bricklayer two years later.[9][10] Jonson attended school in St Martin's Lane in London.[1] Later, a family friend paid for his studies at Westminster School, where the antiquarian, historian, topographer and officer of arms William Camden (1551–1623) was one of his masters. The pupil and master became friends, and the intellectual influence of Camden's broad-ranging scholarship upon Jonson's art and literary style remained notable, until Camden's death in 1623. At Westminster School he met the Welsh poet Hugh Holland, with whom he established an \"enduring relationship\".[11] Both of them would write preliminary poems for William Shakespeare's First Folio (1623). On leaving Westminster School in 1589, Jonson attended St John's College, Cambridge, to continue his book learning. However, because of his unwilled apprenticeship to his bricklayer stepfather, he returned after a month.[3][9] According to the churchman and historian Thomas Fuller (1608–61), Jonson at this time built a garden wall in Lincoln's Inn. After having been an apprentice bricklayer, Jonson went to the Netherlands and volunteered to soldier with the English regiments of Sir Francis Vere (1560–1609) in Flanders. England was allied with the Dutch in their fight for independence as well as the ongoing war with Spain. The Hawthornden Manuscripts (1619), of the conversations between Ben Jonson and the poet William Drummond of Hawthornden[1] (1585–1649), report that, when in Flanders, Jonson engaged, fought and killed an enemy soldier in single combat, and took for trophies the weapons of the vanquished soldier.[12] Johnson is reputed to have visited the antiquary Sir Robert Cotton at a residence of his in Chester early in the 17th century.[13] After his military activity on the Continent, Jonson returned to England and worked as an actor and as a playwright. As an actor, he was the protagonist \"Hieronimo\" (Geronimo) in the play The Spanish Tragedy (c. 1586), by Thomas Kyd (1558–94), the first revenge tragedy in English literature. By 1597, he was a working playwright employed by Philip Henslowe, the leading producer for the English public theatre; by the next year, the production of Every Man in His Humour (1598) had established Jonson's reputation as a dramatist.[14][15] Jonson described his wife to William Drummond as \"a shrew, yet honest\". The identity of Jonson's wife is obscure, though she sometimes is identified as \"Ann Lewis\", the woman who married a Benjamin Jonson in 1594, at the church of St Magnus-the-Martyr, near London Bridge.[16] The registers of St Martin-in-the-Fields record that Mary Jonson, their eldest daughter, died in November 1593, at six months of age. A decade later, in 1603, Benjamin Jonson, their eldest son, died of bubonic plague when he was seven years old, upon which Jonson wrote the elegiac \"On My First Sonne\" (1603). A second son, also named Benjamin Jonson, died in 1635.[17] During that period[clarification needed], Jonson and his wife lived separate lives for five years; Jonson enjoyed the residential hospitality of his patrons, Esme Stuart, 3rd Duke of Lennox and 7th Seigneur d'Aubigny and Sir Robert Townshend.[16] By summer 1597, Jonson had a fixed engagement in the Admiral's Men, then performing under Philip Henslowe's management at The Rose.[1] John Aubrey reports, on uncertain authority, that Jonson was not successful as an actor; whatever his skills as an actor, he was more valuable to the company as a writer.[18] By this time Jonson had begun to write original plays for the Admiral's Men; in 1598 he was mentioned by Francis Meres in his Palladis Tamia as one of \"the best for tragedy.\"[1] None of his early tragedies survive, however. An undated comedy, The Case is Altered, may be his earliest surviving play.[19] In 1597, a play which he co-wrote with Thomas Nashe, The Isle of Dogs, was suppressed after causing great offence. Arrest warrants for Jonson and Nashe were issued by Queen Elizabeth I's so-called interrogator, Richard Topcliffe. Jonson was jailed in Marshalsea Prison and charged with \"Leude and mutynous behaviour\", while Nashe managed to escape to Great Yarmouth. Two of the actors, Gabriel Spenser and Robert Shaw, were also imprisoned. A year later, Jonson was again briefly imprisoned, this time in Newgate Prison, for killing Gabriel Spenser in a duel on 22 September 1598 in Hogsden Fields[12] (today part of Hoxton). Tried on a charge of manslaughter, Jonson pleaded guilty but was released by benefit of clergy,[1] a legal ploy through which he gained leniency by reciting a brief Bible verse (the neck-verse), forfeiting his \"goods and chattels\" and being branded with the so-called Tyburn T on his left thumb.[1] While in jail Jonson converted to Catholicism, possibly through the influence of fellow-prisoner Father Thomas Wright, a Jesuit priest.[7] In 1598 Jonson produced his first great success, Every Man in His Humour, capitalising on the vogue for humorous plays which George Chapman had begun with An Humorous Day's Mirth. William Shakespeare was among the first actors to be cast. Jonson followed this in 1599 with Every Man out of His Humour, a pedantic attempt to imitate Aristophanes.[non sequitur] It is not known whether this was a success on stage, but when published it proved popular and went through several editions.[citation needed] Jonson's other work for the theatre in the last years of Elizabeth I's reign was marked by fighting and controversy. Cynthia's Revels was produced by the Children of the Chapel Royal at Blackfriars Theatre in 1600. It satirised both John Marston, who Jonson believed had accused him of lustfulness in Histriomastix, and Thomas Dekker. Jonson attacked the two poets again in Poetaster (1601). Dekker responded with Satiromastix, subtitled \"the untrussing of the humorous poet\".[1] The final scene of this play, while certainly not to be taken at face value as a portrait of Jonson, offers a caricature that is recognisable from Drummond's report – boasting about himself and condemning other poets, criticising performances of his plays and calling attention to himself in any available way.[citation needed] This \"War of the Theatres\" appears to have ended with reconciliation on all sides. Jonson collaborated with Dekker on a pageant welcoming James I to England in 1603 although Drummond reports that Jonson called Dekker a rogue. Marston dedicated The Malcontent to Jonson and the two collaborated with Chapman on Eastward Ho!, a 1605 play whose anti-Scottish sentiment briefly landed both Jonson and Chapman in jail.[20] At the beginning of the English reign of James VI and I in 1603 Jonson joined other poets and playwrights in welcoming the new king. Jonson quickly adapted himself to the additional demand for masques and entertainments introduced with the new reign and fostered by both the king and his consort[1] Anne of Denmark. In addition to his popularity on the public stage and in the royal hall, he enjoyed the patronage of aristocrats such as Elizabeth Sidney (daughter of Sir Philip Sidney) and Lady Mary Wroth. This connection with the Sidney family provided the impetus for one of Jonson's most famous lyrics, the country house poem To Penshurst. In February 1603 John Manningham reported that Jonson was living on Robert Townsend, son of Sir Roger Townshend, and \"scorns the world.\"[21] Perhaps this explains why his trouble with English authorities continued. That same year he was questioned by the Privy Council about Sejanus, a politically themed play about corruption in the Roman Empire. He was again in trouble for topical allusions in a play, now lost, in which he took part. Shortly after his release from a brief spell of imprisonment imposed to mark the authorities' displeasure at the work, in the second week of October 1605, he was present at a supper party attended by most of the Gunpowder Plot conspirators. After the plot's discovery, he appears to have avoided further imprisonment; he volunteered what he knew of the affair to the investigator Robert Cecil and the Privy Council. Father Thomas Wright, who heard Fawkes's confession, was known to Jonson from prison in 1598 and Cecil may have directed him to bring the priest before the council, as a witness.[7] At the same time, Jonson pursued a more prestigious career, writing masques for James's court. The Satyr (1603) and The Masque of Blackness (1605) are two of about two dozen masques which Jonson wrote for James or for Queen Anne, some of them performed at Apethorpe Palace when the King was in residence. The Masque of Blackness was praised by Algernon Charles Swinburne as the consummate example of this now-extinct genre, which mingled speech, dancing and spectacle. On many of these projects, he collaborated, not always peacefully, with designer Inigo Jones. For example, Jones designed the scenery for Jonson's masque Oberon, the Faery Prince performed at Whitehall on 1 January 1611 in which Prince Henry, eldest son of James I, appeared in the title role. Perhaps partly as a result of this new career, Jonson gave up writing plays for the public theatres for a decade. He later told Drummond that he had made less than two hundred pounds on all his plays together. In 1616 Jonson received a yearly pension of 100 marks (about £60), leading some to identify him as England's first Poet Laureate. This sign of royal favour may have encouraged him to publish the first volume of the folio-collected edition of his works that year.[1] Other volumes followed in 1640–41 and 1692. (See: Ben Jonson folios) On 8 July 1618 Jonson set out from Bishopsgate in London to walk to Edinburgh, arriving in Scotland's capital on 17 September. For the most part he followed the Great North Road, and was treated to lavish and enthusiastic welcomes in both towns and country houses.[22] On his arrival he lodged initially with John Stuart, a cousin of King James, in Leith, and was made an honorary burgess of Edinburgh at a dinner laid on by the city on 26 September.[22] He stayed in Scotland until late January 1619, and the best-remembered hospitality he enjoyed was that of the Scottish poet, William Drummond of Hawthornden,[1] sited on the River Esk. Drummond undertook to record as much of Jonson's conversation as he could in his diary, and thus recorded aspects of Jonson's personality that would otherwise have been less clearly seen. Jonson delivers his opinions, in Drummond's terse reporting, in an expansive and even magisterial mood. Drummond noted he was \"a great lover and praiser of himself, a contemner and scorner of others\".[1] On returning to England, he was awarded an honorary Master of Arts degree from Oxford University. The period between 1605 and 1620 may be viewed as Jonson's heyday. By 1616 he had produced all the plays on which his present reputation as a dramatist is based, including the tragedy Catiline (acted and printed 1611), which achieved limited success[1] and the comedies Volpone (acted 1605 and printed in 1607), Epicoene, or the Silent Woman (1609), The Alchemist (1610), Bartholomew Fair (1614) and The Devil Is an Ass (1616).[1] The Alchemist and Volpone were immediately successful. Of Epicoene, Jonson told Drummond of a satirical verse which reported that the play's subtitle was appropriate since its audience had refused to applaud the play (i.e., remained silent). Yet Epicoene, along with Bartholomew Fair and (to a lesser extent) The Devil is an Ass have in modern times achieved a certain degree of recognition. While his life during this period was apparently more settled than it had been in the 1590s, his financial security was still not assured. Jonson recounted that his father had been a prosperous Protestant landowner until the reign of \"Bloody Mary\" and had suffered imprisonment and the forfeiture of his wealth during that monarch's attempt to restore England to Catholicism. On Elizabeth's accession, he had been freed and had been able to travel to London to become a clergyman.[23][24] (All that is known of Jonson's father, who died a month before his son was born, comes from the poet's own narrative.) Jonson's elementary education was in a small church school attached to St Martin-in-the-Fields parish, and at the age of about seven he secured a place at Westminster School, then part of Westminster Abbey. Notwithstanding this emphatically Protestant grounding, Jonson maintained an interest in Catholic doctrine throughout his adult life and, at a particularly perilous time while a religious war with Spain was widely expected and persecution of Catholics was intensifying, he converted to the faith.[25][26] This took place in October 1598, while Jonson was on remand in Newgate Gaol charged with manslaughter. Jonson's biographer Ian Donaldson is among those who suggest that the conversion was instigated by Father Thomas Wright, a Jesuit priest who had resigned from the order over his acceptance of Queen Elizabeth's right to rule in England.[27][28] Wright, although placed under house arrest on the orders of Lord Burghley, was permitted to minister to the inmates of London prisons.[27] It may have been that Jonson, fearing that his trial would go against him, was seeking the unequivocal absolution that Catholicism could offer if he were sentenced to death.[26] Alternatively, he could have been looking to personal advantage from accepting conversion since Father Wright's protector, the Earl of Essex, was among those who might hope to rise to influence after the succession of a new monarch.[29] Jonson's conversion came at a weighty time in affairs of state; the royal succession, from the childless Elizabeth, had not been settled and Essex's Catholic allies were hopeful that a sympathetic ruler might attain the throne. Conviction, and certainly not expedience alone, sustained Jonson's faith during the troublesome twelve years he remained a Catholic. His stance received attention beyond the low-level intolerance to which most followers of that faith were exposed. The first draft of his play Sejanus His Fall was banned for \"popery\", and did not re-appear until some offending passages were cut.[7] In January 1606 he (with Anne, his wife) appeared before the Consistory Court in London to answer a charge of recusancy, with Jonson alone additionally accused of allowing his fame as a Catholic to \"seduce\" citizens to the cause.[30] This was a serious matter (the Gunpowder Plot was still fresh in people's minds) but he explained that his failure to take communion was only because he had not found sound theological endorsement for the practice, and by paying a fine of thirteen shillings (156 pence) he escaped the more serious penalties at the authorities' disposal. His habit was to slip outside during the sacrament, a common routine at the time—indeed it was one followed by the royal consort, Queen Anne of Denmark, herself—to show political loyalty while not offending the conscience.[31] Leading church figures, including John Overall, Dean of St Paul's, were tasked with winning Jonson back to Protestantism, but these overtures were resisted.[32] In May 1610 Henry IV of France was assassinated, purportedly in the name of the Pope; he had been a Catholic monarch respected in England for tolerance towards Protestants, and his murder seems to have been the immediate cause of Jonson's decision to rejoin the Church of England.[33][34] He did this in flamboyant style, pointedly drinking a full chalice of communion wine at the eucharist to demonstrate his renunciation of the Catholic rite, in which the priest alone drinks the wine.[35][36] The exact date of the ceremony is unknown.[34] However, his interest in Catholic belief and practice remained with him until his death.[37] Jonson's productivity began to decline in the 1620s, but he remained well-known. In that time, the Sons of Ben or the \"Tribe of Ben\", those younger poets such as Robert Herrick, Richard Lovelace, and Sir John Suckling who took their bearing in verse from Jonson, rose to prominence. However, a series of setbacks drained his strength and damaged his reputation. He resumed writing regular plays in the 1620s, but these are not considered among his best. They are of significant interest, however, for their portrayal of Charles I's England. The Staple of News, for example, offers a remarkable look at the earliest stage of English journalism. The lukewarm reception given that play was, however, nothing compared to the dismal failure of The New Inn; the cold reception given this play prompted Jonson to write a poem condemning his audience (An Ode to Himself), which in turn prompted Thomas Carew, one of the \"Tribe of Ben\", to respond in a poem that asks Jonson to recognise his own decline.[38] The principal factor in Jonson's partial eclipse was, however, the death of James and the accession of King Charles I in 1625. Jonson felt neglected by the new court. A decisive quarrel with Jones harmed his career as a writer of court masques, although he continued to entertain the court on an irregular basis. For his part, Charles displayed a certain degree of care for the great poet of his father's day: he increased Jonson's annual pension to £100 and included a tierce of wine and beer. Despite the strokes that he suffered in the 1620s, Jonson continued to write. At his death in 1637 he seems to have been working on another play, The Sad Shepherd. Though only two acts are extant, this represents a remarkable new direction for Jonson: a move into pastoral drama. During the early 1630s, he also conducted a correspondence with James Howell, who warned him about disfavour at court in the wake of his dispute with Jones. According to a contemporary letter written by Edward Thelwall of Gray's Inn, Jonson died on 18 August 1637[39] (O.S. 6 August).[40] He died in London.[6] His funeral was held the next day. It was attended by \"all or the greatest part of the nobility then in town\".[21][7] He is buried in the north aisle of the nave in Westminster Abbey, with the inscription \"O Rare Ben Johnson [sic]\" set in the slab over his grave.[1][41] John Aubrey, in a more meticulous record than usual, notes that a passer-by, John Young of Great Milton, Oxfordshire, saw the bare grave marker and on impulse paid a workman eighteen pence to make the inscription. Another theory suggests that the tribute came from William Davenant, Jonson's successor as Poet Laureate (and card-playing companion of Young), as the same phrase appears on Davenant's nearby gravestone, but essayist Leigh Hunt contends that Davenant's wording represented no more than Young's coinage, cheaply re-used.[41][42] The fact that Jonson was buried in an upright position was an indication of his reduced circumstances at the time of his death,[43] although it has also been written that he asked for a grave exactly 18 inches square from the monarch and received an upright grave to fit in the requested space.[44][45] It has been pointed out that the inscription could be read \"Orare Ben Jonson\" (pray for Ben Jonson), possibly in an allusion to Jonson's acceptance of Catholic doctrine during his lifetime (although he had returned to the Church of England); the carving shows a distinct space between \"O\" and \"rare\".[7][46][47] A monument to Jonson was erected in about 1723 by the Earl of Oxford and is in the eastern aisle of Westminster Abbey's Poets' Corner.[48] It includes a portrait medallion and the same inscription as on the gravestone. It seems Jonson was to have had a monument erected by subscription soon after his death but the English Civil War intervened.[49] Apart from two tragedies, Sejanus and Catiline, that largely failed to impress Renaissance audiences, Jonson's work for the public theatres was in comedy. These plays vary in some respects. The minor early plays, particularly those written for boy players, present somewhat looser plots and less-developed characters than those written later, for adult companies. Already in the plays which were his salvos in the Poets' War, he displays the keen eye for absurdity and hypocrisy that marks his best-known plays; in these early efforts, however, the plot mostly takes second place to a variety of incident and comic set-pieces. They are, also, notably ill-tempered. Thomas Davies called Poetaster \"a contemptible mixture of the serio-comic, where the names of Augustus Caesar, Maecenas, Virgil, Horace, Ovid and Tibullus, are all sacrificed upon the altar of private resentment\". Another early comedy in a different vein, The Case is Altered, is markedly similar to Shakespeare's romantic comedies in its foreign setting, emphasis on genial wit and love-plot. Henslowe's diary indicates that Jonson had a hand in numerous other plays, including many in genres such as English history with which he is not otherwise associated. The comedies of his middle career, from Eastward Hoe to The Devil Is an Ass are for the most part city comedy, with a London setting, themes of trickery and money, and a distinct moral ambiguity, despite Jonson's professed aim in the Prologue to Volpone to \"mix profit with your pleasure\". His late plays or \"dotages\", particularly The Magnetic Lady and The Sad Shepherd, exhibit signs of an accommodation with the romantic tendencies of Elizabethan comedy. Within this general progression, however, Jonson's comic style remained constant and easily recognisable. He announces his programme in the prologue to the folio version of Every Man in His Humour: he promises to represent \"deeds, and language, such as men do use\". He planned to write comedies that revived the classical premises of Elizabethan dramatic theory—or rather, since all but the loosest English comedies could claim some descent from Plautus and Terence, he intended to apply those premises with rigour.[50] This commitment entailed negations: after The Case is Altered, Jonson eschewed distant locations, noble characters, romantic plots and other staples of Elizabethan comedy, focusing instead on the satiric and realistic inheritance of new comedy. He set his plays in contemporary settings, peopled them with recognisable types, and set them to actions that, if not strictly realistic, involved everyday motives such as greed and jealousy. In accordance with the temper of his age, he was often so broad in his characterisation that many of his most famous scenes border on the farcical (as William Congreve, for example, judged Epicoene). He was more diligent in adhering to the classical unities than many of his peers—although as Margaret Cavendish noted, the unity of action in the major comedies was rather compromised by Jonson's abundance of incident. To this classical model, Jonson applied the two features of his style which save his classical imitations from mere pedantry: the vividness with which he depicted the lives of his characters and the intricacy of his plots. Coleridge, for instance, claimed that The Alchemist had one of the three most perfect plots in literature. Jonson's poetry, like his drama, is informed by his classical learning. Some of his better-known poems are close translations of Greek or Roman models; all display the careful attention to form and style that often came naturally to those trained in classics in the humanist manner. Jonson largely avoided the debates about rhyme and meter that had consumed Elizabethan classicists such as Thomas Campion and Gabriel Harvey. Accepting both rhyme and stress, Jonson used them to mimic the classical qualities of simplicity, restraint and precision. \"Epigrams\" (published in the 1616 folio) is an entry in a genre that was popular among late-Elizabethan and Jacobean audiences, although Jonson was perhaps the only poet of his time to work in its full classical range. The epigrams explore various attitudes, most from the satiric stock of the day: complaints against women, courtiers and spies abound. The condemnatory poems are short and anonymous; Jonson's epigrams of praise, including a famous poem to Camden and lines to Lucy Harington, are longer and are mostly addressed to specific individuals. Although it is included among the epigrams, \"On My First Sonne\" is neither satirical nor very short; the poem, intensely personal and deeply felt, typifies a genre that would come to be called \"lyric poetry.\" It is possible that the spelling of 'son' as 'Sonne' is meant to allude to the sonnet form, with which it shares some features. A few other so-called epigrams share this quality. Jonson's poems of \"The Forest\" also appeared in the first folio. Most of the fifteen poems are addressed to Jonson's aristocratic supporters, but the most famous are his country-house poem \"To Penshurst\" and the poem \"To Celia\" (\"Come, my Celia, let us prove\") that appears also in Volpone. Underwood, published in the expanded folio of 1640, is a larger and more heterogeneous group of poems. It contains A Celebration of Charis, Jonson's most extended effort at love poetry; various religious pieces; encomiastic poems including the poem to Shakespeare and a sonnet on Mary Wroth; the Execration against Vulcan[51] and others. The 1640 volume also contains three elegies which have often been ascribed to Donne (one of them appeared in Donne's posthumous collected poems). There are many legends about Jonson's rivalry with Shakespeare. William Drummond reports that during their conversation, Jonson scoffed at two apparent absurdities in Shakespeare's plays: a nonsensical line in Julius Caesar and the setting of The Winter's Tale on the non-existent seacoast of Bohemia. Drummond also reported Jonson as saying that Shakespeare \"wanted art\" (i.e., lacked skill).[52] In \"De Shakespeare Nostrat\" in Timber, which was published posthumously and reflects his lifetime of practical experience, Jonson offers a fuller and more conciliatory comment. He recalls being told by certain actors that Shakespeare never blotted (i.e., crossed out) a line when he wrote. His own claimed response was \"Would he had blotted a thousand!\"[a] However, Jonson explains, \"Hee was (indeed) honest, and of an open, and free nature: had an excellent Phantsie; brave notions and gentle expressions: wherein hee flow'd with that facility, that sometime it was necessary he should be stopp'd\".[54] Jonson concludes that \"there was ever more in him to be praised than to be pardoned.\" When Shakespeare died, he said, \"He was not of an age, but for all time.\"[55] Thomas Fuller relates stories of Jonson and Shakespeare engaging in debates in the Mermaid Tavern; Fuller imagines conversations in which Shakespeare would run rings around the more learned but more ponderous Jonson. That the two men knew each other personally is beyond doubt, not only because of the tone of Jonson's references to him but because Shakespeare's company produced a number of Jonson's plays, at least two of which (Every Man in His Humour and Sejanus His Fall) Shakespeare certainly acted in. However, it is now impossible to tell how much personal communication they had, and tales of their friendship cannot be substantiated.[citation needed] Jonson's most influential and revealing commentary on Shakespeare is the second of the two poems that he contributed to the prefatory verse that opens Shakespeare's First Folio. This poem, \"To the Memory of My Beloved the Author, Mr. William Shakespeare and What He Hath Left Us\", did a good deal to create the traditional view of Shakespeare as a poet who, despite \"small Latine, and lesse Greeke\",[56] had a natural genius. The poem has traditionally been thought to exemplify the contrast which Jonson perceived between himself, the disciplined and erudite classicist, scornful of ignorance and sceptical of the masses, and Shakespeare, represented in the poem as a kind of natural wonder whose genius was not subject to any rules except those of the audiences for which he wrote. But the poem itself qualifies this view: Some view this elegy as a conventional exercise, but others see it as a heartfelt tribute to the \"Sweet Swan of Avon\", the \"Soul of the Age!\" It has been argued that Jonson helped to edit the First Folio, and he may have been inspired to write this poem by reading his fellow playwright's works, a number of which had been previously either unpublished or available in less satisfactory versions, in a relatively complete form.[citation needed] Jonson was a towering literary figure, and his influence was enormous for he has been described as \"One of the most vigorous minds that ever added to the strength of English literature\".[57] Before the English Civil War, the \"Tribe of Ben\" touted his importance, and during the Restoration Jonson's satirical comedies and his theory and practice of \"humour characters\" (which are often misunderstood; see William Congreve's letters for clarification) was extremely influential, providing the blueprint for many Restoration comedies. John Aubrey wrote of Jonson in Brief Lives. By 1700, Jonson's status began to decline. In the Romantic era, Jonson suffered the fate of being unfairly compared and contrasted to Shakespeare, as the taste for Jonson's type of satirical comedy decreased. Jonson was at times greatly appreciated by the Romantics, but overall he was denigrated for not writing in a Shakespearean vein. In 2012, after more than two decades of research, Cambridge University Press published the first new edition of Jonson's complete works for 60 years.[58] As G. E. Bentley notes in Shakespeare and Jonson: Their Reputations in the Seventeenth Century Compared, Jonson's reputation was in some respects equal to Shakespeare's in the 17th century. After the English theatres were reopened on the Restoration of Charles II, Jonson's work, along with Shakespeare's and Fletcher's, formed the initial core of the Restoration repertory. It was not until after 1710 that Shakespeare's plays (ordinarily in heavily revised forms) were more frequently performed than those of his Renaissance contemporaries. Many critics since the 18th century have ranked Jonson below only Shakespeare among English Renaissance dramatists. Critical judgment has tended to emphasise the very qualities that Jonson himself lauds in his prefaces, in Timber, and in his scattered prefaces and dedications: the realism and propriety of his language, the bite of his satire, and the care with which he plotted his comedies. For some critics, the temptation to contrast Jonson (representing art or craft) with Shakespeare (representing nature, or untutored genius) has seemed natural; Jonson himself may be said to have initiated this interpretation in the second folio, and Samuel Butler drew the same comparison in his commonplace book later in the century. At the Restoration, this sensed difference became a kind of critical dogma. Charles de Saint-Évremond placed Jonson's comedies above all else in English drama, and Charles Gildon called Jonson the father of English comedy. John Dryden offered a more common assessment in the \"Essay of Dramatic Poesie,\" in which his Avatar Neander compares Shakespeare to Homer and Jonson to Virgil: the former represented profound creativity, the latter polished artifice. But \"artifice\" was in the 17th century almost synonymous with \"art\"; Jonson, for instance, used \"artificer\" as a synonym for \"artist\" (Discoveries, 33). For Lewis Theobald, too, Jonson \"ow[ed] all his Excellence to his Art,\" in contrast to Shakespeare, the natural genius. Nicholas Rowe, to whom may be traced the legend that Jonson owed the production of Every Man in his Humour to Shakespeare's intercession, likewise attributed Jonson's excellence to learning, which did not raise him quite to the level of genius. A consensus formed: Jonson was the first English poet to understand classical precepts with any accuracy, and he was the first to apply those precepts successfully to contemporary life. But there were also more negative spins on Jonson's learned art; for instance, in the 1750s, Edward Young casually remarked on the way in which Jonson's learning worked, like Samson's strength, to his own detriment. Earlier, Aphra Behn, writing in defence of female playwrights, had pointed to Jonson as a writer whose learning did not make him popular; unsurprisingly, she compares him unfavourably to Shakespeare. Particularly in the tragedies, with their lengthy speeches abstracted from Sallust and Cicero, Augustan critics saw a writer whose learning had swamped his aesthetic judgment. In this period, Alexander Pope is exceptional in that he noted the tendency to exaggeration in these competing critical portraits: \"It is ever the nature of Parties to be in extremes; and nothing is so probable, as that because Ben Jonson had much the most learning, it was said on the one hand that Shakespear had none at all; and because Shakespear had much the most wit and fancy, it was retorted on the other, that Jonson wanted both.\"[59] For the most part, the 18th century consensus remained committed to the division that Pope doubted; as late as the 1750s, Sarah Fielding could put a brief recapitulation of this analysis in the mouth of a \"man of sense\" encountered by David Simple. Though his stature declined during the 18th century, Jonson was still read and commented on throughout the century, generally in the kind of comparative and dismissive terms just described. Heinrich Wilhelm von Gerstenberg translated parts of Peter Whalley's edition into German in 1765. Shortly before the Romantic revolution, Edward Capell offered an almost unqualified rejection of Jonson as a dramatic poet, who (he writes) \"has very poor pretensions to the high place he holds among the English Bards, as there is no original manner to distinguish him and the tedious sameness visible in his plots indicates a defect of Genius.\"[60] The disastrous failures of productions of Volpone and Epicoene in the early 1770s no doubt bolstered a widespread sense that Jonson had at last grown too antiquated for the contemporary public; if he still attracted enthusiasts such as Earl Camden and William Gifford, he all but disappeared from the stage in the last quarter of the century. The romantic revolution in criticism brought about an overall decline in the critical estimation of Jonson. Hazlitt refers dismissively to Jonson's \"laborious caution.\" Coleridge, while more respectful, describes Jonson as psychologically superficial: \"He was a very accurately observing man; but he cared only to observe what was open to, and likely to impress, the senses.\" Coleridge placed Jonson second only to Shakespeare; other romantic critics were less approving. The early 19th century was the great age for recovering Renaissance drama. Jonson, whose reputation had survived, appears to have been less interesting to some readers than writers such as Thomas Middleton or John Heywood, who were in some senses \"discoveries\" of the 19th century. Moreover, the emphasis which the romantic writers placed on imagination, and their concomitant tendency to distrust studied art, lowered Jonson's status, if it also sharpened their awareness of the difference traditionally noted between Jonson and Shakespeare. This trend was by no means universal, however; William Gifford, Jonson's first editor of the 19th century, did a great deal to defend Jonson's reputation during this period of general decline. In the next era, Swinburne, who was more interested in Jonson than most Victorians, wrote, \"The flowers of his growing have every quality but one which belongs to the rarest and finest among flowers: they have colour, form, variety, fertility, vigour: the one thing they want is fragrance\" – by \"fragrance,\" Swinburne means spontaneity. In the 20th century, Jonson's body of work has been subject to a more varied set of analyses, broadly consistent with the interests and programmes of modern literary criticism. In an essay printed in The Sacred Wood, T. S. Eliot attempted to repudiate the charge that Jonson was an arid classicist by analysing the role of imagination in his dialogue. Eliot was appreciative of Jonson's overall conception and his \"surface\", a view consonant with the modernist reaction against Romantic criticism, which tended to denigrate playwrights who did not concentrate on representations of psychological depth. Around mid-century, a number of critics and scholars followed Eliot's lead, producing detailed studies of Jonson's verbal style. At the same time, study of Elizabethan themes and conventions, such as those by E. E. Stoll and M. C. Bradbrook, provided a more vivid sense of how Jonson's work was shaped by the expectations of his time. The proliferation of new critical perspectives after mid-century touched on Jonson inconsistently. Jonas Barish was the leading figure among critics who appreciated Jonson's artistry. On the other hand, Jonson received less attention from the new critics than did some other playwrights and his work was not of programmatic interest to psychoanalytic critics. But Jonson's career eventually made him a focal point for the revived sociopolitical criticism. Jonson's works, particularly his masques and pageants, offer significant information regarding the relations of literary production and political power, as do his contacts with and poems for aristocratic patrons; moreover, his career at the centre of London's emerging literary world has been seen as exemplifying the development of a fully commodified literary culture. In this respect he is seen as a transitional figure, an author whose skills and ambition led him to a leading role both in the declining culture of patronage and in the rising culture of mass media. Jonson has been called \"the first poet laureate\".[61] If Jonson's reputation as a playwright has traditionally been linked to Shakespeare, his reputation as a poet has, since the early 20th century, been linked to that of John Donne. In this comparison, Jonson represents the cavalier strain of poetry, emphasising grace and clarity of expression; Donne, by contrast, epitomised the metaphysical school of poetry, with its reliance on strained, baroque metaphors and often vague phrasing. Since the critics who made this comparison (Herbert Grierson for example), were to varying extents rediscovering Donne, this comparison often worked to the detriment of Jonson's reputation. In his time Jonson was at least as influential as Donne. In 1623, historian Edmund Bolton named him the best and most polished English poet. That this judgment was widely shared is indicated by the admitted influence he had on younger poets. The grounds for describing Jonson as the \"father\" of cavalier poets are clear: many of the cavalier poets described themselves as his \"sons\" or his \"tribe\". For some of this tribe, the connection was as much social as poetic; Herrick described meetings at \"the Sun, the Dog, the Triple Tunne\".[1] All of them, including those like Herrick whose accomplishments in verse are generally regarded as superior to Jonson's, took inspiration from Jonson's revival of classical forms and themes, his subtle melodies, and his disciplined use of wit. In these respects, Jonson may be regarded as among the most important figures in the prehistory of English neoclassicism. Popular Culture - His \"Queen and Huntress\" was used, in slightly amended form, by Mike Oldfield on side 4 of his multi Album set, Incantations.The lyrics can be found on his website, confirming its the same poem. The best of Jonson's lyrics have remained current since his time; periodically, they experience a brief vogue, as after the publication of Peter Whalley's edition of 1756. Jonson's poetry continues to interest scholars for the light which it sheds on English literary history, such as politics, systems of patronage and intellectual attitudes. For the general reader, Jonson's reputation rests on a few lyrics that, though brief, are surpassed for grace and precision by very few Renaissance poems: \"On My First Sonne\"; \"To Celia\"; \"To Penshurst\"; and the epitaph on Salomon Pavy, a boy player abducted from his parents who acted in Jonson's plays. It is in Jonson's Timber, or Discoveries... that he famously quipped on the manner in which language became a measure of the speaker or writer: Language most shows a man: Speak, that I may see thee. It springs out of the most retired and inmost parts of us, and is the image of the parent of it, the mind. No glass renders a man’s form or likeness so true as his speech. Nay, it is likened to a man; and as we consider feature and composition in a man, so words in language; in the greatness, aptness, sound structure, and harmony of it. As with other English Renaissance dramatists, a portion of Ben Jonson's literary output has not survived. In addition to The Isle of Dogs (1597), the records suggest these lost plays as wholly or partially Jonson's work: Richard Crookback (1602); Hot Anger Soon Cold (1598), with Porter and Henry Chettle; Page of Plymouth (1599), with Dekker; and Robert II, King of Scots (1599), with Chettle and Dekker. Several of Jonson's masques and entertainments also are not extant: The Entertainment at Merchant Taylors (1607); The Entertainment at Salisbury House for James I (1608); and The May Lord (1613–19). Finally, there are questionable or borderline attributions. Jonson may have had a hand in Rollo, Duke of Normandy, or The Bloody Brother, a play in the canon of John Fletcher and his collaborators. The comedy The Widow was printed in 1652 as the work of Thomas Middleton, Fletcher and Jonson, though scholars have been intensely sceptical about Jonson's presence in the play. A few attributions of anonymous plays, such as The London Prodigal, have been ventured by individual researchers, but have met with cool responses.[64] Ben Johnson features as a character in Jean Findlay's historical novel, The Queen's Lender (2022).[65]",

                "content": "Our editors will review what you’ve submitted and determine whether to revise the article. Ben Jonson (born June 11?, 1572, London, England—died August 6, 1637, London) was an English Stuart dramatist, lyric poet, and literary critic. He is generally regarded as the second most important English dramatist, after William Shakespeare, during the reign of James I. Among his major plays are the comedies Every Man in His Humour (1598), Volpone (1605), Epicoene; or, The Silent Woman (1609), The Alchemist (1610), and Bartholomew Fair (1614). Jonson was born two months after his father died. His stepfather was a bricklayer, but by good fortune the boy was able to attend Westminster School. His formal education, however, ended early, and he at first followed his stepfather’s trade, then fought with some success with the English forces in the Netherlands. On returning to England, he became an actor and playwright, experiencing the life of a strolling player. He apparently played the leading role of Hieronimo in Thomas Kyd’s The Spanish Tragedy. By 1597 he was writing plays for Philip Henslowe, the leading impresario for the public theatre. With one exception (The Case Is Altered), these early plays are known, if at all, only by their titles. Jonson apparently wrote tragedies as well as comedies in these years, but his extant writings include only two tragedies, Sejanus (1603) and Catiline (1611). The year 1598 marked an abrupt change in Jonson’s status, when Every Man in His Humour was successfully presented by the Lord Chamberlain’s theatrical company (a legend has it that Shakespeare himself recommended it to them), and his reputation was established. In this play Jonson tried to bring the spirit and manner of Latin comedy to the English popular stage by presenting the story of a young man with an eye for a girl, who has difficulty with a phlegmatic father, is dependent on a clever servant, and is ultimately successful—in fact, the standard plot of the Latin dramatist Plautus. But at the same time Jonson sought to embody in four of the main characters the four “humours” of medieval and Renaissance medicine—choler, melancholy, phlegm, and blood—which were thought to determine human physical and mental makeup. That same year Jonson killed a fellow actor in a duel, and, though he escaped capital punishment by pleading “benefit of clergy” (the ability to read from the Latin Bible), he could not escape branding. During his brief imprisonment over the affair he became a Roman Catholic. Following the success of Every Man in His Humour, the same theatrical company acted Jonson’s Every Man Out of His Humour (1599), which was even more ambitious. It was the longest play ever written for the Elizabethan public theatre, and it strove to provide an equivalent of the Greek comedy of Aristophanes; “induction,” or “prelude,” and regular between-act comment explicated the author’s views on what the drama should be. The play, however, proved a disaster, and Jonson had to look elsewhere for a theatre to present his work. The obvious place was the “private” theatres, in which only young boys acted (see children’s company). The high price of admission they charged meant a select audience, and they were willing to try strong satire and formal experiment; for them Jonson wrote Cynthia’s Revels (c. 1600) and Poetaster (1601). Even in these, however, there is the paradox of contempt for human behaviour hand in hand with a longing for human order. From 1605 to 1634 he regularly contributed masques for the courts of James I and Charles I, collaborating with the architect and designer Inigo Jones. This marked his favour with the court and led to his post as poet laureate. It appears that Jonson won royal attention by his Entertainment at Althorpe, given before James I’s queen as she journeyed down from Scotland in 1603, and in 1605 The Masque of Blackness was presented at court. The “masque” was a quasi-dramatic entertainment, primarily providing a pretense for a group of strangers to dance and sing before an audience of guests and attendants in a royal court or nobleman’s house. This elementary pattern was much elaborated during the reign of James I, when Jones provided increasingly magnificent costumes and scenic effects for masques at court. The few spoken words that the masque had demanded in Elizabethan days expanded into a “text” of a few hundred lines and a number of set songs. Thus the author became important as well as the designer: he was to provide not only the necessary words but also a special “allegorical” meaning underlying the whole entertainment. It was Jonson, in collaboration with Jones, who gave the Jacobean masque its characteristic shape and style. He did this primarily by introducing the suggestion of a “dramatic” action. It was thus the poet who provided the informing idea and dictated the fashion of the whole night’s assembly. Jonson’s early masques were clearly successful, for during the following years he was repeatedly called upon to function as poet at court. Among his masques were Hymenaei (1606), Hue and Cry After Cupid (1608), The Masque of Beauty (1608), and The Masque of Queens (1609). In his masques Jonson was fertile in inventing new motives for the arrival of the strangers. But this was not enough: he also invented the “antimasque,” which preceded the masque proper and which featured grotesques or comics who were primarily actors rather than dancers or musicians. Important though Jonson was at the court in Whitehall, it was undoubtedly Jones’s contributions that caused the most stir. That tension should arise between the two men was inevitable, and eventually friction led to a complete break: Jonson wrote the Twelfth Night masque for the court in 1625 but then had to wait five years before the court again asked for his services. In 1606 Jonson and his wife (whom he had married in 1594) were brought before the consistory court in London to explain their lack of participation in the Anglican church. He denied that his wife was guilty but admitted that his own religious opinions held him aloof from attendance. The matter was patched up through his agreement to confer with learned men, who might persuade him if they could. Apparently it took six years for him to decide to conform. For some time before this he and his wife had lived apart, Jonson taking refuge in turn with his patrons Sir Robert Townshend and Esmé Stuart, Lord Aubigny. During this period, nevertheless, he made a mark second only to Shakespeare’s in the public theatre. His comedies Volpone; or, the Foxe (1606) and The Alchemist (1610) were among the most popular and esteemed plays of the time. Each exhibited man’s folly in the pursuit of gold. Set respectively in Italy and London, they demonstrate Jonson’s enthusiasm both for the typical Renaissance setting and for his own town on Europe’s fringe. Both plays are eloquent and compact, sharp-tongued and controlled. The comedies Epicoene (1609) and Bartholomew Fair (1614) were also successful. Jonson embarked on a walking tour in 1618–19, which took him to Scotland. During the visit the city of Edinburgh made him an honorary burgess and guild brother. On his return to England he received an honorary Master of Arts degree from Oxford University, a most signal honour in his time. Jonson’s life was a life of talk as well as of writing. He engaged in “wit-combats” with Shakespeare and reigned supreme. It was a young man’s ultimate honour to be regarded as a “son of Ben.” In 1623 his personal library was destroyed by fire. By this time his services were seldom called on for the entertainment of Charles I’s court, and his last plays failed to please. In 1628 he suffered what was apparently a stroke and, as a result, was confined to his room and chair, ultimately to his bed. That same year he was made city chronologer (thus theoretically responsible for the city’s pageants), though in 1634 his salary for the post was made into a pension. Jonson died in 1637 and was buried in Westminster Abbey. The first folio edition of his works had appeared in 1616; posthumously, in a second Jonson folio (1640), appeared Timber: or, Discoveries, a series of observations on life and letters. Here Jonson held forth on the nature of poetry and drama and paid his final tribute to Shakespeare: in spite of acknowledging a belief that his great contemporary was, on occasion, “full of wind”—sufflaminandus erat—he declared that “I loved the man, and do honour his memory, on this side idolatry, as much as any.”",

                "content": "Poems & Poets Poems & Poets Ben Jonson is among the best-known writers and theorists of English Renaissance literature, second in reputation only to Shakespeare. A prolific dramatist and a man of letters highly learned in the classics, he profoundly influenced the Augustan age through his emphasis on the precepts of Horace, Aristotle, and other classical Greek and Latin thinkers. While he is now remembered primarily for his satirical comedies, he also distinguished himself as a poet, preeminent writer of masques, erudite defender of his work, and the originator of English literary criticism. Jonson’s pro­fessional reputation is often obscured by that of the man himself: bold, independent and aggressive. He fashioned for himself an image as the sole arbiter of taste, standing for erudition and the supremacy of clas­sical models against what he perceived as the general populace’s ignorant preference for the sensational. While his direct influence can be seen in each genre he undertook, his ultimate legacy is considered to be his literary craftsmanship, his strong sense of artistic form and control, and his role in bringing, as Alex­ander Pope noted, “critical learning into vogue.” Jonson was born in London shortly after the death of his father, a minister who claimed descent from the Scottish gentry. Despite a poor upbringing, he was educated at Westminster School under the renowned antiquary William Camden. He apparently left his schooling unwillingly to work with his stepfather as a bricklayer. He then served as a volunteer in the Low Countries in the Dutch war against Spain, and the sto­ry is told that he defeated a challenger in single com­bat between the opposing armies, stripping his van­quished opponent of his arms in the classical fashion. Returning to England by 1592, Jonson married Anne Lewis in 1594. Although the union was unhappy, it produced several children, all of whom Jonson out­lived. In the years following his marriage, he became an actor and also wrote numerous “get-penny” enter­tainments—financially motivated and quickly com­posed plays. He also provided respected emendations and additions to Thomas Kyd’s The Spanish Tragedy (1592). By 1597 he was writing for Philip Henslowe’s theatrical company. That year, Henslowe employed Jonson to finish Thomas Nashe’s satire The Isle of Dogs (now lost), but the play was suppressed for al­leged seditious content and Jonson was jailed for a short time. In 1598 the earliest of his extant works, Every Man in His Humour, was produced by the Lord Chamberlain’s Men with William Shakespeare—who became close friends with Jonson—in the cast. That same year, Jonson fell into further trouble after killing actor Gabriel Spencer in a duel, narrowly escaping the gallows by claiming benefit of clergy (meaning he was shown leniency for proving that he was literate and educated). While incarcerated at Newgate prison, Jon­son converted to Catholicism. Shortly thereafter, writing for the Children of the Queen’s Chapel, Jonson became embroiled in a public feud with playwrights John Marston and Thomas Dekker. In Cynthia’s Revells and Poetaster (both 1601), Jonson portrayed himself as the impartial, well informed judge of art and society and wrote unflattering portraits of the two dramatists. Marston and Dekker counterat­tacked with a satiric portrayal of Jonson in the play Satiromastix; or, The Untrussing of the Humorous Poet (1602). Interestingly, scholars speculate that the dis­pute, which became known as the “War of the The­atres,” was mutually contrived in order to further the authors’ careers. In any event, Jonson later reconciled with Marston, and collaborated with him and George Chapman in writing Eastward Ho! (1605). A joke at the King’s expense in this play landed him once again, along with his coauthors, in prison. Once freed, how­ever, Jonson entered a period of good fortune and productivity. He had many friends at court, and James I valued his learning highly. His abilities thus did not go unrecognized, and he was frequently called upon to write his popular, elegant masques, such as The Mas­que of Blacknesse (1605). During this period, Jonson also produced his most successful comedies, begin­ning in 1606 with Volpone and following with The Silent Woman (1609), The Alchemist (1610), and Bar­tholomew Fayre (1614). Jonson’s remaining tragedies, Sejanus His Fall (1603) and Catiline His Conspiracy (1611), though monuments to his scholarship, were not well received due to their rigid imitation of classical tragic forms and their pedantic tone. In 1616 Jonson published his Workes, becoming the first English writer to dignify his dramas by terming them “works,” and for this perceived presumption he was soundly ridiculed. In that year Jonson assumed the responsibilities and privileges of Poet Laureate, though without formal appointment. From 1616 to 1625 he primarily wrote masques for presentation at court. He had already collaborated with poet, architect, and stage designer Inigo Jones one several court masques, and the two continued their joint efforts, establishing the reign of James I as the period of the consummate masque. For his achievements, the University of Ox­ford honored him in 1619 with a master of arts degree. Misfortune, however, marked Jonson’s later years. A fire destroyed his library in 1623, and when James I died in 1625, Jonson lost much of his influence at court, though he was named City Chronologer in 1628. Later that year, he suffered the first of several strokes which left him bedridden. Jonson produced four plays during the reign of Charles I, and was eventually grant­ed a new pension in 1634. None of these later plays was successful. The rest of his life, spent in retirement, he filled primarily with study and writing; at his death, on August 6, 1637, two unfinished plays were discov­ered among his mass of papers and manuscripts. Jon­son left a financially depleted estate, but was neverthe­less buried with honor in Westminster Abbey. Jonson’s earliest comedies, such as Every Man in His Humour, derive from Roman comedy in form and structure and are noteworthy as models of the comedy of “humours,” in which each character represents a type dominated by a particular obsession. Although Jonson was not the first to employ the comedy of humours, his use of the form in Every Man in His Humour and Every Man out of His Humour is considered exempla­ry, and such characterization continued to be a feature of his work. Of particular significance in appraisals of Jonson are the four comical satires produced between 1606 and 1614: Volpone, The Silent Woman, The Al­chemist, and Bartholomew Fayre. Each exposes some aberration of human appetite through comic exagger­ation and periodic moralisms while evincing Jonson’s interest in the variety of life and in the villain as a cunning, imaginative artist. Volpone, his most famous and most frequently staged work, is also his harshest attack on human vice, specifically targeting greed. Like The Silent Woman and The Alchemist, it mixes didac­tic intent with scenes of tightly constructed comic coun­terpoise. The last of Jonson’s great dramas is the pan­oramic Bartholomew Fayre. Softening the didacticism that characterized his earlier work, Jonson expressed the classical moralist’s views of wisdom and folly through a multiplicity of layered, interrelated plots in a colorfully portrayed and loosely structured form. All four comedies exhibit careful planning executed with classical precision, a command of low speech and col­loquial usage, and a movement toward more realistic, three-dimensional character depiction. Critics note that Jonson’s later plays, beginning with The Divell is an Asse in 1616, betray the dramatist’s diminishing artistry. These later dramas were dismissed by John Dryden, who undertook the first extensive anal­ysis of Jonson, as mere “dotages.” While generously likening him to Virgil and calling him “the most learned and judicious writer which any theatre ever had,” Dryden’s comments also signaled the start of a decline in Jonson’s reputation, for his observations included a comparison of Jonson and Shakespeare, one which nodded admiringly toward Jonson, but bowed adoring­ly before Shakespeare. This telling comparison col­ored Jonson’s reputation for more than 200 years, fueled by such 19th-century Romantic critics as Samuel Taylor Coleridge (1818), and Will­iam Hazlitt (1819), who found Jonson lacking in imag­ination, delicacy, and soul. His “greatest defect,” ac­cording to George Saintsbury, was the “want of pas­sion.” “Yet,” he conceded, “his merits are extraordi­nary.” Most 19th-century critics agreed with the assessment of John Addington Symonds that the “higher gifts of poetry, with which Shakespeare—‘nature’s child’—was so richly endowed, are almost absolutely wanting in Ben Jonson.” T.S. Eliot, writing in 1919, focused attention on Jonson’s reputation as “the most deadly kind that can be compelled upon the memory of a great poet. To be universally accepted; to be damned by the praise that quenches all desire to read the book; to be afflicted by the imputation of the virtues which excite the least pleasure; and to be read only by historians and anti­quaries—this is the most perfect conspiracy of approv­al.” With this began a reevaluation of Jonson, whose reputation benefited from modernist reaction against Romanticist sensibility, and who began to be appreciated on his own terms. English critic L.C. Knights, in 1937, considered Jonson “a very great poet”; and while Edmund Wilson, in 1948, still found none of Shakespeare’s “immense range” in Jonson, he thought him “a great man of letters” and acknowl­edged his influence on writers as diverse as Milton, Congreve, Swift, and Huxley. Recent scholarship has sought to place Jonson in the theatrical and political milieu of London, addressing his relationship with his audience and the monarchy. This focus on historical context has also produced an emphasis on the former bricklayer’s “self-fashioning” into dramatist, critic, and finally the first poet laureate. Many critics now regard him as a fore-runner in the 17th-century move­ment toward classicism, and his plays are often ad­mired for their accurate depictions of the men and women of his day, their mastery of form, and their successful blend of the serious and the comic, the top­ical, and the timeless.

                "title": "Bronx fire leaves 7 injured as 200 firefighters respond to five-alarm blaze",
                "content": "A massive blaze ripped through a Bronx apartment building owned by a man who once was named the city’s “worst landlord” Friday, leaving at least seven people injured and hundreds forced to find other shelter, officials said. Some 200 FDNY firefighters responded to the 1:40 a.m. inferno at the six-story 2910 Wallace Ave. in the East Bronx — where alarming video showed huge plumes of fire billowing from the roof. “I know my apartment is done. I lost everything,” Vanessa 0., 34, told The Post as firefighters continued to fight the smoldering blaze before noon Friday. “My husband works from home, he has computers, electronics … everything we need. I need clothes to go to work. I wear suits to work. This is all I have,” she continued, pointing to the sweatpants and light coat she was wearing. Vanessa, a tenant of five years, was alerted to the flames by the sound of fire engines early this morning. No smoke or fire alarms were set off, she said. “We opened our doors and we saw them bringing in the hose upstairs. We didn’t run out. The fire department was so busy trying to get the hose to the top floor, they didn’t even tell us to leave,” Vanessa said. “The electricity went off in the building and that’s when they moved everybody to the lobby. I’m guessing they evacuated maybe four or five in the morning but initially everybody was there.” Multiple tenants told The Post that the building has been suffering from numerous problems over the last few months — and alleged that the landlord, Parkash Management, had done little to quell their concerns. The company’s owner, Ved Parkash, made headlines one decade ago after being named the city’s “worst landlord” by then-Public Advocate Letitia James for allowing his buildings to fall into squalor. Fire officials said Friday’s blaze started in the cockloft — the space between the ceiling and the underside of the roof — though they could not say the cause as the fire continued to burn until it was finally brought under control around 3 p.m. Within an hour, “heavy wind conditions” elevated the fire to five alarms — the highest alarm level indicating a severe fire, according to the FDNY. “The fire had too much headway. It was extremely dangerous for our firefighters,” said John Esposito, the FDNY’s Chief of Department. The seven injured include five firefighters and two civilians, the FDNY said. One of the civilians was treated at the scene and declined to be taken to a hospital. The seven injured include five firefighters and two civilians, the FDNY said. None of the injuries were life-threatening. One of the civilians was treated at the scene and declined to be taken to a hospital. The roof was completely burned off, and all the apartments on the top floor were destroyed. The lower levels were flooded, according to Vanessa. At least 66 families were displaced by the blaze. Officials opened a temporary relief zone at P.S. 76, the Bennington School, down the corner from the scorched apartment building. Gluendy Disz, 28, and her mother had only been living in the East Bronx apartment building for a few months when the fire tore through the building Friday. “Everything is destroyed but I’m hanging in there,” Diaz told The Post while clutching Dexter, her three-year-old black Labrador. “He was the first thing I grabbed,” she said. The surgical coordinator and her mother had been sleeping when the chaos erupted. “The firefighters were just coming up the stairs. We had just woken up and it was already going on,” Diaz recalled. “I was nervous, I was frightened.” Luz Gonzalez, 65, has lived in a third-floor apartment for over 20 years, said broken heaters, water leaking through light fixtures and collapsed ceilings have been among the complaints she and her neighbors have filed in recent months. “We’ve been telling them that something was going through our ceilings, water was going through our lightbulbs and everything was horrible, but they didn’t listen to us,” Gonzalez told The Post. “Water is coming through my lightbulb. Do you know what he had the nerve to tell me? To wait until after the holidays,” she continued. “I lost everything. I don’t have nothing, nothing at all, but he sure wants his rent.” Lilia Elva Gonzalez, a ground-floor tenant of 17 years, complained that the electricity in her apartment was not up to standard. “Do you think this is fair? No! I pay my rent. I have my record, each month I pay my rent. I always complain. They don’t listen to me,” she told The Post. “This is about the owners, they do nothing. Why did they wait for this to happen when they could’ve fixed it before but didn’t do it, right?” Various 311 reports back up the displaced tenants’ allegations — particularly that the building had been suffering heating issues for months. Roughly 70 complaints stretching back to November claim there was no heat in the building — an issue some residents may have tried to remedy themselves with space heaters and ovens. “From the FDNY’s perspective, we would ask people not to do that. It’s cold weather. Obviously, that’s a very dangerous situation. It can cause fires to happen, and we hope that we are sending the message that fire safety in the cold weather is super important, and to report any situations like that to 3-1-1 immediately,” said Fire Commissioner Robert Tucker. While it is still unclear what caused the massive blaze, Parkash has a storied history of allegedly neglecting his numerous buildings, which mostly pepper the Bronx. In 2017, Parkash made headlines for allowing conditions in another Bronx building to deteriorate so severely that it bred a deadly rat-borne bacterial disease to flourish. Three people caught leptospirosis, which is linked to rat urine — one of whom succumbed to the infection. Parkash has also been accused of illegally dividing apartment basements into additional units. He was dubbed the city’s “worst landlord” two years before the rat infestation, though Parkash managed to avoid the city’s dishonor list in 2023. When reached for comment, a spokesperson for the landlord, Parkash Management said, “We are withholding comment because this is an active fire investigation.” Advertisement",

By Isabella KwaiLola Fadulu and Bernard Mokam Dozens of families were looking for shelter after a large fire broke out at an apartment building in the Bronx early Friday, injuring at least seven people, the Fire Department said. There were no fatalities or life-threatening injuries, according to officials. The Red Cross was at the scene helping residents who were displaced, and a temporary shelter had been set up nearby at the Bennington School on Adee Avenue. The organization provided food throughout the day and was working to connect people with temporary lodging in hotels, said Frederic Klein, a spokesman. By Friday afternoon, 254 people from 93 households had registered to receive help, according to the Red Cross, including more than 55 households who needed lodging. “Not everybody will register with us if they have the ability to recover on their own,” Mr. Klein said. In the short term, he said, people would be put in hotels, where they would meet with a caseworker who could help them transition into the city’s shelter system. The Red Cross was also working to provide people with mental health support and to help them replace any prescription medications that they couldn’t retrieve from their homes. Earlier on Friday, about 250 firefighters and emergency medical workers rushed to the six-story residential building on Wallace Avenue near Arnow Avenue after a fire was reported there just before 2 a.m., the Fire Department said. The blaze on the top floor was elevated to a five-alarm fire about an hour later, it said. We are having trouble retrieving the article content. Please enable JavaScript in your browser settings.

                "content": "Watch CBS News By Elijah Westbrook, Tony Aiello, Jennifer Bisram Updated on: January 11, 2025 / 12:22 AM EST / CBS New York NEW YORK -- A five-alarm fire broke out early Friday morning in the Bronx, leaving seven people hurt and more than 200 others displaced. Firefighters responded around 1:45 a.m. to a six-story apartment building at 2910 Wallace Avenue in the Allerton section of the borough. Once crews arrived, they determined the fire was coming from the top floor of the building. Within an hour, it quickly grew to five alarms. Crews spent hours trying to get the intense flames and smoke under control, but officials said the roof and all the apartments on the top floor were destroyed, and water damaged every other unit. \"Initially, we had fire companies inside conducting searches, removing people and attempting to fight the fire. The fire had too much headway, extremely dangerous for our firefighters. We removed them from the building and, you can see behind us, we're using tower ladders to extinguish the rest of the building, and we're continuing with that operation,\" one fire official said. Officials said the cold and windy conditions made it more difficult to fight the stubborn flames. \"This was a massive fire, and the wind played a major role in the conditions that we are facing,\" New York City Mayor Eric Adams told reporters on the scene. \"It's been a very long and cold morning here in the Bronx,\" FDNY Commissioner Ben Tucker added. \"This was a very, very large fire, wind-driven, as the mayor said. Very difficult fire for our firefighters to fight under conditions that caused us to have to have lots of relief.\" Five firefighters and two residents suffered minor injuries, and five of the victims were taken to area hospitals for treatment, according to the FDNY. \"Please pray for your neighbors here in Allerton. We know that these fires are happening far too often across our city, and we will do our very best to make sure that we protect New Yorkers during their time of need,\" said Bronx Borough President Vanessa Gibson. The Department of Buildings has issued a full vacate order and ordered the construction of a sidewalk shed around the building. Residents who lost everything are now trying to figure out what they will do for food and shelter. Many ran out of their apartments in the cold with nothing but the clothes on their backs. \"This is like hitting rock bottom, to be honest. It's starting from zero,\" said Jarixa Guzman, a mother of four whose family lost their cats in the fire. \"It was just one place, it was one apartment, it was very small in front of the building. Then out of nowhere, it became a nightmare. I didn't see everything that was happening, I just saw a lot of black smoke,\" resident Nicole Novoa said. \"I don't even know how to feel right now, it's just so many different emotions. Thank God I'm alive, honestly, and I'm in one piece.\" The city's Office of Emergency Management directed residents to P.S. 76 on Adee Avenue, where the Red Cross was ready to help those displaced. So far, the organization says it registered 81 families, a total of 202 people. Friday night, neighbors stopped by the school to drop off donations. \"I just felt like it was right in my heart to donate to these people, and I feel so bad, you know. After the holidays and settling in after the new year, this is just an awful thing that happened to the community,\" neighbor Kayla Ravagnan said. The Red Cross will be back at P.S. 76 from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. Saturday to help any families that may still need assistance. \"We got more help from them in a couple of hours than we ever did with our landlord,\" fire victim Ricardine Bernard said. Novoa said there has been little-to-no heat at the apartment building for about three years. \"There's days that you wake up and there's no hot water or there's no heating. I work from home and I work with a coat on, it's freezing,\" she said. \"We have a lot of electricity problems and we also don't have no heating. So a lot of us do have space heaters on, so I'm sure that's part of the reason that it triggered it.\" Guzman said wiring was an issue, too. \"'Cause there's not even a breaker box. It's a fuse, like the little screw-in types,\" she said. The mayor and fire commissioner told reporters they were not aware of the complaints about the heat, but vowed to get answers for the residents. \"We are going to have DOB and other city agencies look into if there's a chronic issue. Going to look at if there are 311 calls that were made, what follow-up was conducted. And we're going to find out what the cause of this fire is,\" said Adams. \"But we will look into if those were some of the concerns.\" CBS News New York has learned there have been about 70 complaints made to 311 about lack of heat and hot water since October 2024. All were resolved except a complaint made on Jan. 8, two days before the fire. \"The landlord was a slumlord. He didn't do nothing for the building,\" neighbor John Walker said. Through a spokesperson, landlord Ved Parkash said, \"We are withholding comment because this is an active fire investigation.\" We've reported on tenant complaints involving his buildings many times, dating back to 2013. He was named by the public advocate one of the city's worst landlords in 2015. The official cause of the fire remains under investigation. Alecia Reid contributed to this report.

                "content": "Texan English is the array of American English dialects spoken in Texas, primarily falling under Southern U.S. English. As one nationwide study states, the typical Texan accent is a \"Southern accent with a twist\".[1] The \"twist\" refers to inland Southern U.S., older coastal Southern U.S., and South Midland U.S. accents mixing together, due to Texas's settlement history, as well as some lexical (vocabulary) influences from Mexican Spanish.[1] In fact, there is no single accent that covers all of Texas and few dialect features are unique to Texas alone. The newest and most innovative Southern U.S. accent features are best reported in Lubbock, Odessa, somewhat Houston and variably Dallas, though general features of this same dialect are found throughout the state, with several exceptions:[2] Abilene and somewhat Austin, Corpus Christi, and El Paso appear to align more with Midland U.S. accents than Southern ones. After Mexico gained independence in 1821, Mexican Texas legally permitted an influx of American settlers mainly from the Southern United States,[3] who within a decade outnumbered Hispanics in Texas,[4] making English as common as Spanish in central and north Texas. After Texas became an independent republic in 1836, English, with its distinct Southern influences, became the predominant language. After the Mexican Revolution of 1910–1920, a great number of Spanish-speaking Mexicans immigrated to Texas,[5][6] slowing down in the mid-20th century only to increase massively since 1990,[4] driving the development of a young Spanish-influenced dialect of Texan English: Tejano English. Some linguists draw dialect boundaries based upon phonological (sound-pattern) differences and others on lexical (word-usage) differences, leading to various views on how to classify dialects in Texas, often by dividing the state into an eastern versus a western dialect region.[7] 20th-century lexical research delimited Texas into two \"layers\": a southern Texas layer along the Mexican border with several Spanish loanwords and a central Texas layer settled by speakers of German and other European languages amidst a dominant Anglo-American settlement.[8][9] 21st-century phonological research reveals accents in Texas grouped in a way not easy to demarcate in terms of simple geographical boundaries,[10] and ongoing research reveals an urban–rural divide within Texas becoming more significant than a region-wide divide. Some linguists propose that urbanization, geographic and social mobility, and the mass media have homogenized the speech of the United States to a national norm.[11] Due to rapid urbanization, increasing dominance of high tech industries, and massive migrations, Texan speech has been reshaped as well, especially since 1990.[4] The general tendency in the phonology of Texas English is that mergers expand at the expense of distinctions, although traditional Southern-style Texan English preserved older phonemic distinctions.[11] Since much of the traditional regional vocabulary concerned farming and rural life, these terms are now disappearing or being replaced by technical terms.[11] As stated above, an internal rural–urban split is emerging within Texan English, meaning that most traditionally Southern (or stereotypically Texan) features remain strong in rural areas but tend to disappear in large urban areas and small cities.[4] The urban-rural linguistic split mainly affects Southern-style phonological phenomena like the pen-pin merger, the loss of the offglide in /aɪ/, and upgliding diphthongs, all of which are now recessive in metropolitan areas.[4] Meanwhile, some traditional grammatical features like y'all and fixin' to are expanding to non-natives in metropolitan areas as well as to the Hispanic population.[4] Essentially all Texas English phonologically falls under the Southeastern super-dialect region of the United States and often specifically the Southern dialect region, though noticeably not the cities of El Paso, Abilene, and Austin, and not particularly Houston and Corpus Christi.[2] Moreover, as of 21st-century research, the accents of Dallas show enormous variability.[10] Texas English may use many grammatical constructions typically associated with Southern U.S. English, including fixin' to,[19] multiple modals like might could and should oughta (reportedly used by every social class and, as of the 1980s Linguistic Atlas of the Gulf States, predominately in Upper and Lower East Texas), and plural verbal -s as in Our father and mother helps used by both Black and (somewhat less commonly) white Texans.[20] Many of these lexical terms are shared with the Midland and Southern dialects generally: Due to Spain's past influence in Texas, the vocabulary of Texas is much more influenced by Spanish than the vocabulary of other states. Some of the Texan terms that originated from Spanish are listed below.[22] Texan English frequently shows up in the media. In the 1950s and 1960s, many Hollywood western movies like Giant, Hud, and The Alamo were set in Texas. In those movies, Hollywood stars like James Dean, Rock Hudson, Dennis Hopper, Paul Newman, and Patricia Neal first had to learn how to speak Texan English and were instructed by native Texans. Also the famous TV series Dallas was often characterized by Texan English. Texas Instruments sometimes uses Texan English in its products. The TIFORM software for its TI-990 minicomputer sometimes displayed \"Shut 'er Down Clancey She's a-Pumping Mud\" as a humorous error message.[28] The Texan accent gained nationwide fame with the presidency of native Texan Lyndon B. Johnson. A lifelong resident of the Texas Hill Country, Johnson's thick accent was a large part of his personality and brought attention and fame to the dialect.[4][29] The Texan dialect gained fame again when George W. Bush started to serve as president. He had moved to West Texas at the age of two and has since retained the Texan dialect. In his speech, words like \"America\" sometimes sound like \"Amur-kah\" or even just like \"Mur-kah\".[4][30] Former U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson also speaks with a distinctively Texan accent.[31][32] Due to hundreds of years of Spanish and later Mexican intermingling, around 6 million (ca. 29%) people in Texas speak Spanish as the first language.[33] Recent data shows that Spanish is still increasing.[34] Since there are so many Spanish speakers in Texas, Spanish has a high impact on the English dialect spoken in Texas.[35] Many Mexican Americans in Texas speak their own variety of English which has many Spanish features (terms, phonology, etc.), Tejano English, a Chicano English dialect mostly spoken by working-class Mexican Americans. A very distinctive feature of that dialect is the /-t,d/-deletion in words which contain a /t/ or /d/ in the final position.[36]",

The numbers have fluctuated overnight as new trouble spots emerged as quickly as others were repaired. It seems as soon as crews restore power to one area, another trouble spot pops up. The situation will likely worsen throughout the day as winds intensify. In a post on X, formerly known as Twitter, Georgia Power acknowledged the challenges crews are facing due to icy conditions. \"As our crews anticipated based on the forecast, additional freezing rain and falling trees have caused power outages as the sun has gone down.

                "title": "How many inches of snow did Atlanta get? Internet in disbelief as city finds itself in the midst of another 'snowpocalypse'",
                "content": "A major snowstorm is reportedly heading towards areas in north Georgia, including Atlanta and the Upstate of South Carolina. The winter storm began affecting the Southern region on Friday morning (January 10, 2025) before heading towards the northern parts. According to FOX Weather, a third inch of ice has accumulated in Atlanta and South Carolina regions in Georgia. The northern part of metro Atlanta witnessed two to four inches of snow. Ice-cold rains and freezing weather are also expected. The winter storm alerts have been indicated in areas including Texas, the Virginias, the Midwest, and the Great Lakes in the north. The snowstorm has left multiple netizens in shock as the weather conditions heavily resemble the January 2014 'snowpocalypse' or 'snowmageddon.' The dangerous snow storms affected traffic across Atlanta and other areas of Georgia. According to the Arkansas Department of Transportation, windy road conditions and the snow have caused multiple traffic accidents and spinouts since January 10 morning. There have been statewide reports of weather-related accidents across the state of Georgia, including on interstates 30, 40, and 555. FOX Weather meteorologist Jane Minar reported on Friday, January 10, that around seven inches of snow has already fallen in Little Rock, Arkansas. As much as a foot of snow is expected in certain parts of Arkansas by the end of the storm, per FOX Weather. Meanwhile, five to eight inches of snow is expected in Tennessee and Kentucky. Five states, namely Georgia, Arkansas, Alabama, Tennessee, and North Carolina, have declared a state of emergency due to the weather. On January 28 and 29, 2014, Atlanta was affected by a major snowstorm, often dubbed by locals as a snowpocalypse or snowmageddon. The city experienced one to three inches of snowfall, with traffic disrupted, roads shut down, and weather alerts put forward in various regions. In an interview with Weather.com, some citizens who witnessed the 2014 snowpocalypse in the city shared their memories of the weather. One such witness, Chris Dolce, who worked as a meteorologist with The Weather Channel at that time, recalled the conditions. He added: According to 11Alive, multiple children across the city remained stuck for hours during the snowstorm. The precarious weather conditions also halted traffic across the city. The situation had worsened because the emergency management team in Atlanta did not take the weather warnings seriously. Schools remained open on January 28, and the then-Governer, Nathan Deal, also attended a meeting that morning. The National Weather Service had notably issued a warning nine hours before the snowstorm hit the city. Nathan Deal's deputy chief of staff, Brian Robinson, recalled the reasons behind the decision to keep public places open back in 2014 in an interview with 11alive. He said: Robinson added that a shutdown order was not an automatic call they took and explained: After the snowstorm took a turn for the worse, affecting multiple citizens, Nathan Deal apologized, and the emergency management director resigned. A similar forecast arrived two weeks later, but Deal immediately shut down the government as a precautionary measure. Since then, serious weather alerts have always led to similar precautionary measures. The current snowstorm affecting Georgia has also led to strong precautions, with schools shut down and alerts overseen well in advance. Multiple flights heading to Atlanta or taking off from the city have been canceled. More than 400 flights scheduled to take off from the Hartsfield-Jackson airport, considered the nation's busiest, have been canceled. The storm is expected to move off to the East Coast by Friday (January 10) evening.",

                "title": "Ohio State holds off Texas in electric Cotton Bowl semifinal seeking first national championship in a decade - CBSSports.com",
                "content": "If not listed, please contact your TV provider. ARLINGTON, Texas -- Ohio State outlasted Texas 28-14 to win the Cotton Bowl and clinch their first trip to the College Football Playoff National Championship since 2014. The Buckeyes will face 7-seed Notre Dame at Mercedes-Benz Stadium in Atlanta on Jan. 20 in search of their first national championship in a decade. Texas got the ball to the edge of the goal line with only minutes remaining in the fourth quarter and had five plays to get it into the end zone. On a pivotal fourth down Texas quarterback Quinn Ewers dropped back to pass, but Ohio State defensive end Jack Sawyer strip-sacked Ewers and returned it more than 80 yards for a touchdown. The Longhorns had one more drive, but Ewers threw an interception to safety Caleb Downs to end the game and send Ohio State to the national title game. Despite the offensive talent between these two programs, the defenses dominated the matchup. Texas forced an interception off quarterback Will Howard and sacked him twice. Ohio State posted nine tackles for loss and four sacks in the big win, including three tackles for loss from linebacker Sonny Styles. Texas blanketed wide receiver Jeremiah Smith and held him to only three yards on three targets. In his place, Carnell Tate stepped up with seven catches for 87 yards. Three first half drives were derailed by penalties, but the Buckeyes made just enough plays to step up and win. Ewers threw for 283 yards and two touchdowns in what is expected to be his final career game at Texas. Ultimately, the Longhorns leave for the second year in a row wondering what could have been. CBS Sports was here throughout with updates, highlights and analysis. Read on below for takeaways from Ohio State's dramatic win over Texas. Texas managed to take away Jeremiah Smith. The Buckeyes are down two starting linemen for the season. At one point, defensive end J.T. Tuimoloau went out with an injury. None of it mattered. Ohio State's championship depth shone through. With Smith blanketed, the Buckeyes simply looked to No. 2 receiver Emeka Egbuka, who finished with five catches for 51 yards. When he faced pressure, No. 3 receiver Carnell Tate stepped up and had one of the biggest games of his young career with seven catches for 87 yards. Even when Ohio State gave up the first touchdown of the game, running back TreVeyon Henderson took a screen pass 75 yards for a touchdown. Ultimately, that's the challenge that comes with playing Ohio State. It has a roster filled with players who can change the game in an instant. Even in the semifinal round of the College Football Playoff, no one can seriously match the Buckeyes depth. Ohio State defensive end Jack Sawyer was a top-five national recruit, but never quite lived up to national-caliber ability -- until the College Football Playoff. With a game-deciding strip-sack, Sawyer's legendary CFP added yet another chapter. Sawyer finished with three tackles, a sack, two pass breakups, two quarterback hurries and the strip-sack for a touchdown in the win. In the playoff alone, Sawyer is up to 4.5 sacks. He has emerged as the physical and emotional leader of the defense as the Buckeyes prepare to play for a national championship. Texas was rated among the best defenses in college football all season, but the Longhorns flexed their muscles against Ohio State's highly-ranked offense. The Longhorns blanketed wide receiver Jeremiah Smith from the start and held him to only three targets and one catch. From an aerial view, defensive coordinator Pete Kwiatkowski passed off coverages and used pass rushers to block passing lanes and make the quick passing game ineffective. The Longhorns' defensive line also had real success against a high-powered Ohio State offense, holding the Buckeyes to only 3.4 yards per carry and 78 yards from the running backs. The performance will get lost to history, but the Texas unit was one of the best in the sport. Ohio State outlasted Texas 28-14 to win the Cotton Bowl and clinch their first trip to the College Football Playoff National Championship since 2014. The Buckeyes will face 7-seed Notre Dame at Mercedes-Benz Stadium in Atlanta on Jan. 20 in search of their first national championship in a decade.

Ewers threw for 283 yards and two touchdowns in what is expected to be his final career game at Texas. Ultimately, the Longhorns leave for the second year in a row wondering what could have been. Jack Sawyer's fumble recovery and fumble recovery for a touchdown are the longest in College Football Playoff history, eclipsing the 58-yard fumble return touchdown by Oregon's Tony Washington against Florida State in the Rose Bowl in 2014-15. Ohio State defensive end Jack Sawyer got the pressure on Quinn Ewers on 4th and Goal, and when the Texas quarterback dropped the ball he picked it up and ran it 83 yards the other way for a lead-extending touchdown for the Buckeyes. The Longhorns had moved the ball effectively thanks to a long Gunner Helm reception and a big throw from Ewers to Golden, but with the season on the line and the ball at the 2-yard line the Buckeyes not only get a stop but extend their lead with 2:13 remaining. We have seen some epic endings in this first year of the expanded College Football Playoff, but Sawyer's pressure, scoop and score will be one that's remembered for a long time. Ohio State coach Ryan Day made one of his first risky calls of the game by going for it on a lengthy fourth-and-two against a Texas defensive line that was dominating. Chip Kelly dialed up a quarterback draw that went for 18 yards and helped set up a two-yard touchdown run by Quinshon Judkins. Ohio State recommitted to the run on the drive and traveled 87 yards in 12 plays. The Buckeyes have been bogged down by penalties, but the unit was able to withstand a false start by Josh Fryar. Now, they're seven minutes away from heading to the national championship game. Texas has tied the game entering the fourth quarter after a legendary drive from quarterback Quinn Ewers got the Longhorns into the end zone for the second time. Ewers led four third-down conversions, including a toss to Quintrevion Wisner on third down for a miraculous third-and-10 conversion. Ohio State continued to shoot itself in the foot with penalties and mistakes. On the most recent drive, an offensive lineman committed an unsportsmanlike conduct penalty on a run to push the Buckeyes back. Four drives have been stifled by penalties, erasing the Buckeyes' yards and yards per play advantage. The defenses have owned the game with 10 combined tackles for loss and five sacks. The winner of the Cotton Bowl will face off against Notre Dame in the College Football Playoff National Championship on Jan. 20. Texas hasn't run the ball consistently all night, but the running backs took a starring role thanks to a mix of check downs and downhill rushes to get back into the end zone for the second time. Quinn Ewers' third down toss to Quintrevion Wisner for a first down was a game-changing play. Fourteen yards rushing from Wisner didn't change the game, but it made the Buckeyes think. The rushing success helped set up a 26-yard pass to Jaydon Blue, his second score of the game. The Buckeyes have dominated third quarters this season. The Longhorns have struggled. In this moment, Texas flipped the script and tied the game. Facing a key third-and-10, Texas quarterback Quinn Ewers pulled off a silly conversion to keep the drive alive. Ewers was pressured immediately and while being dragged down, tossed the ball to running back Quintrevion Wisner, who rumbled forward for a first down. The play was reviewed to see if Ewers' knee was down, but he got it off just in time. Ohio State quarterback Will Howard tried to force the ball to Jeremiah Smith in triple-coverage and the Texas defense made them pay. Linebacker David Gbenda stepped up and pulled down a pivotal interception to give Texas the ball in great position. In an instant, Texas stole momentum back. Ohio State took a 14-7 lead against Texas into the half after running back TreVeyon Henderson took a well-placed screen pass 75 yards for a game-changing touchdown. The score was the first for Ohio State since the opening drive of the game and is a dagger for the Longhorns as the Buckeyes get the ball to start the second half. Texas cut the Ohio State lead after a pair of key plays late in the first half helped set up points. Backup quarterback Arch Manning entered the game on fourth-and-1 and delivered an 8-yard speed option, and receiver Silas Bolden broke a tackle to key off a 24-yard reception to set up a field goal before the end of the half. The plays helped set up an 18-yard touchdown pass from Quinn Ewers to Jaydon Blue. The Buckeyes dominated much of the first half, but offensive penalties loomed large. Three Ohio State drives were extinguished by them, including two holding calls and an unsportsmanlike conduct by Henderson. Texas looked to have captured momentum right before the break, but Henderson's big play wrestled control back to the Buckeyes. Texas running back Quintreveon Wisner posted 33 yards rushing on 4.1 yards per carry in the half, but Ewers was sacked three times. The Texas defense forced the first sack of Ohio State in the College Football Playoff and held the Buckeyes to only 36 yards on the ground. After missing two field goals in the final minutes of regulation against Arizona State to force overtime in the Peach Bowl, longtime Texas kicker Bert Auburn appears to be benched. Instead, backup Will Stone came into the game to kick the extra point on the Texas touchdown. After a much maligned first half, the Texas offense delivered in the biggest spot near the end of the first half. Quarterback Quinn Ewers delivered a perfectly-placed 18-yard touchdown pass over the top to Jaydon Blue to put up the first points of the game, a much-needed swing as Ohio State gets the ball to start the second half. Texas quarterback Arch Manning entered the game for the first time on first-and-one. Manning ran a speed option and broke through for a key first down with less than a minute remaining in the half. The Longhorns have only 31 yards rushing in the first half, making Manning's eight-yard scamper even more vital. Frankly, Ohio State has dominated Texas. They've nearly doubled them in yardage and are averaging 6.5 yards per play to Texas's 4.2. And yet, the score remains only 7-0 because Ohio State penalties are killing them offensively. There was the unsportsmanlike conduct by TreVeyon Henderson. Gee Scott was called for holding. Josh Fryar held. Each killed a drive and put the Buckeyes behind the chains. In total, Ohio State has been called for four penalties for 40 yards. Texas has only committed two for 17. The penalties hang large. Ohio State defensive end J.T. Tuimoloau went out with an apparent injury in the second quarter. Tuimoloau was shaken up on the field and had to go to the injury tent. Early in the game, Tuimoloau has already been dominant with 1.5 sacks and several other quarterback pressures against an overmatched Texas front. Texas wide receiver Matthew Golden returned to the sideline without his helmet and does not appear likely to return to the game. Golden went to the injury tent and came back with his ankles retaped. After returning briefly, he went to the locker room with trainers. With Golden out, expect Texas to try and target freshman Ryan Wingo more. He's one of the only healthy pass-catchers remaining. Texas's offensive line is getting whipped and Ohio State is bringing pressure from everywhere. The Longhorns have given up four tackles for loss and there sacks in the early going, including two tackles for loss from linebacker Sonny Styles. Texas has coughed up three fumbles and is lucky that all were recovered by the offense. After the most recent drive, top receiver Matthew Golden went to the locker room. Golden previously needed to get his ankles retaped. If Golden is hurt, a banged up Isaiah Bond is the only receiver on the roster with more than 500 yards receiving. Ohio State leads Texas 7-0 at the end of the first quarter as the Longhorns have missed opportunities. The Buckeyes have moved down the field at will, posting 117 yards and averaging 6.9 yards per play against the top defense in college football. With Jeremiah Smith blanketed, second and third receivers Emeka Egbuka and Carnell Tate have combined for 57 yards on five catches. Texas had chances to push its way into the game, including a 22-yard reception from receiver Ryan Wingo that was only stopped with a shoestring tackle. However, the Longhorns allowed two early sacks as Ohio State dominated the trenches on both sides. Ohio State outscored opponents by a combined 35-0 in the first two rounds of the College Football Playoff. A 7-0 advantage is manageable, especially after the Longhorns got a third down stop to end the period. Still, Texas has work to do. Texas will look back on a 22-yard reception to Ryan Wingo as a moment that the game could have gone differently. Wingo caught the ball with plenty of space and seemed to be able to take off for a potential touchdown. Instead, Ohio State safety Caleb Downs came down and narrowly caught him by the shoelaces for a tackle. Texas ultimately had a false start and allowed a sack to kill what was a promising drive in plus territory. That's two drives for Texas. Quinn Ewers has 65 yards. Neither ended with points. The Buckeyes are using motion to force adjustments by the Texas secondary to cover Jeremiah Smith. Ohio State used to to open up the complementary receivers and running game and march down the field with ease for a 64-yard touchdown drive in 10 plays. Receiver Emeka Egbuka had 30 yards on the play and running back Quinshon Judkins broke through for a nine-yard touchdown run. Ohio State had two serious receiving touchdown opportunities -- a missed throw by Will Howard to Jeremiah Smith and a drop by Carnell Tate. It didn't matter. Texas is arguably the best defense in college football, and the Buckeyes put them in the blender. Texas had some solid plays on their opening script, including a nasty play action that freed up a 4-yard pass to Juan Davis. However, facing third-and-4, Texas ran once and passed once before turning it over on downs. Texas quarterback Quinn Ewers tried to force a tight pass to DeAndre Moore, but it fell incomplete. Texas will get first crack at the game on offense and the Longhorns need to start fast. Ohio State jumped out to a 34-0 lead against Oregon and 21-0 lead against Tennessee, both of which proved fatal in games that were decided by a combined 45 points. The Longhorns scored 14 points after one drive against Arizona State; they similarly need to throw the first punch. Texas has put together a solid season and is surely one of the best teams in the country. But if Ohio State's transformation over the last two weeks is permanent, the Buckeyes are the best team in the country. The Longhorns will be able to cause problems for Ohio State's passing game, but their offense simply won't be able to put up points in a battle of two elite defenses. The Buckeyes will outlast the 'Horns and move on to the CFP National Championship. Pick: Ohio State -5.5 Texas vs. Ohio State game prediction, picks, 2025 Cotton Bowl odds, spread, where to watch, TV channel There's always a lot on the line when Ohio State and Texas take the field, and Friday evening is no exception. The (8) Buckeyes and (5) Longhorns are set to face off in the Cotton Bowl, with a trip to the College Football Playoff National Championship on the line. There's no denying that Texas and Ohio State boast two of the top rosters in college football, but which one actually has the edge when analyzing specific positions? 2025 Cotton Bowl, Ohio State vs. Texas: Who has the edge in College Football Playoff semifinal game? Four months isn't a long time. But that won't stop Quinn Ewers' four months in Columbus from being an overarching storyline of the 2025 Cotton Bowl, which will pit No. 8-seed Ohio State against (5) Texas in the semifinals of the College Football Playoffs. Ewers, if you aren't aware by now, reclassified from the 2022 class to the 2021 class in August of 2021 to enroll at Ohio State. He had an uneventful few months on the field, but, in many ways, became a transformational trendsetter in the NIL space with the move. Ahead of the Cotton Bowl, let's revisit Ewers' time in Columbus and what led to that brief marriage in the first place. A million-dollar spread of NIL deals spurred Quinn Ewers to Ohio State early, but staying never made sense The Cotton Bowl pits two of college football's most iconic brands against each other as Ohio State and Texas will tangle Friday night for a spot in the College Football Playoff National Championship. Texas claims four national championships and Ohio State claims eight. But the historic powers have only met three times previously and never in a postseason game with such high stakes. The CFP semifinal showdown will mark the first meeting since the 2009 Fiesta Bowl. Ohio State vs. Texas history is limited, but College Football Playoff foes have played for high stakes before It's easy to be a Batman in college football, getting all the targets and attention. It's much more difficult to be Robin, to put aside your own production for the good of the team. Ohio State wide receiver Emeka Egbuka ranks among the best Robins ever, and has the Buckeyes on the precipice of a national title. \"When culture is strong through the leaders, it permeates throughout the rest of the team,\" Egbuka said. \"When you see it from the top down to the younger guys, it speaks volumes and reflects the character of the leaders.\" Not everyone can be Batman: Ohio State's crew of overqualified Robins, like Emeka Egbuka, embrace their role Texas doesn't spend much time as an underdog in college football as one of the most historic blue bloods in the sport. But on Friday at the Cotton Bowl, the Longhorns are heavy underdogs against Ohio State. CBS Sports' Dennis Dodd spoke to the legendary Mack Brown about how to manage underdog status. \"You latch onto anything you can to find an edge,\" Brown said. \"I mean, the least bit you can get. At Texas, one of the keys to that job is trying to get your guys every week because it's hard to do, because everybody is telling you how great you are. You're usually the pick. You have to just motivate yourself.\" In rare underdog role vs. Ohio State in Cotton Bowl, Texas embraces type of edge Mack Brown once perfected © 2004-2024 CBS Interactive. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.

                "content": "The Longhorns would respond driving down the field and getting a 1st and Goal at the 1 yard line after back to back pass interference penalties, but a seven yard loss on a pitch play to Quintrevion Wisner back Texas up and on 4th down, Captain Jack Sawyer comes up with one of the biggest plays in Ohio State football history. He sacked his old roommate and scooped the fumble before taking it 82 yards for the TD to punch the Buckeye's ticket to the National Championship. Judkins punched the go ahead touchdown in from a yard out after a 13 play, 88 yard drive that took over half of the final quarter. Judkins had just 9 carries but he took those nine carries for 36 yard and two TDs as the Buckeyes totaled 82 yards on the ground. The Longhorns would tie the game up eventually with Quinn Ewers 26 yard pass to Jaydon Blue for their second TD connection of the night. The former Ohio State Buckeye went for 283 yards and two TDs on 23/39 passing but he was on the wrong side of the play of the night with just minutes to go. The Buckeyes had all the wind in their sails coming out of the break, but David Gbenda came up with an interception that turned the tides early in the third quarter. The Longhorns couldn't covert that turnover into points but that kept OSU from stretching the lead out to a two possession advantage. On the next play from scrimmage the Buckeyes were probably looking to play conservatively with under 30 seconds to go. The play wasn't too risky, but TreVeyon Henderson found a hole and broke it for a 75 yard run to take the momentum into the halftime break. Howard had 289 yards and 1 TD with one INT on 24/33 passing to lift his team over the Longhorns and punch their ticket to the National Championship. The Longhorns offense took a little while to wake up and they were battling bad field position for the first two quarters but they finally got the ball around midfield late in the second quarter. With a short field Quinn Ewers hit Jaydon Blue for the first of his two TDs to draw level with Ohio State right before the halftime break. The Ohio State Buckeyes are heading to the College Football Playoff National Championship after taking down the Texans Longhorns in the Cotton Bowl from Arlington. Jack Sawyer had the game winning scoop and score late in the fourth quarter to give his team the 28-14 semifinal win. Ohio State started the game doing what they had done in the first two playoff games, starting out strong and looking for a knock out punch early. They stopped Texas on the opening drive of the game and then marched down the field and put the first points on the board with Quishon Judkins's 9 yard run. IT'S ALL OVER!!!

The Buckeyes won the toss and differed to the second half so here comes Quinn Ewers and the Longhorns starting the game from their 25. WE ARE UNDERWAY FROM DALLAS TEXAS!!!! Remember, this is just one of two CFP semifinals this week. After Notre Dame’s big win over Penn State the Texas Longhorns and the Ohio State Buckeyes match up tonight in the Cotton Bowl from Dallas. That will lead us into a two game NFL playoff slate on Saturday featuring the Chargers vs. Texans and Steeles vs. Ravens. Sunday we have the Broncos vs. Bills, Packers vs. Eagles and Commanders vs. Buccaneers. We will finish the football frenzy with a Monday Night match up between the Vikings and the Rams and remember you can follow all the action right here on AS English. This is the first time we have seen the 12 team playoff, and there is a lot to digest after the first few weeks. It’s tough for the NCAA to get everything right on the first attempt, and heading into the semifinals we see no teams that had a first round bye still alive in the CFP. The teams that were supposed to be favorites and have the advantage of getting the BYE week, looked rusty and were eventually knocked out. This will be Notre Dame and Penn State’s third game since the end of their “season” and it seems like these teams are back in midseason form after basically starting a new season three weeks ago. These playoffs have shown us rust is winning in the rust vs. rest debate. Since Will Howard’s nightmare ending to the loss against Oregon in the regular season, he has been one of the best QBs in the nation. He’s beaten two top five teams, throwing 18 TDs and just six INTs and in the last two games playoff games he has thrown for 630 yards with five TDs and one INTs. This season he has 3,490 yards and 32 TDs with just 9 INTs, but he always shows up when his team needs him. He is the leader of this team and they will need him to lead the Buckeyes into the National Championship tonight in Dallas. The Longhorns have been one of the top teams in the country all season long, and in their first year in a new conference it’s been Drew Ewers leading the way for Texas. He has had to deal with a couple injuries throughout the year so his numbers aren’t up there with the top QBs in the nation, but when the big games come around he always shows up. He had 322 yards and three TDs in the last game against ASU, and went for 358 and a TD in the SEC Championship game. Ewers had thrown for 3,189 yards, 29 TDs and 11 INTs and tonight the Longhorns are going to need him to be at his best in the biggest game of the season. The Longhorns, like the Buckeyes entered the season in the top 5 in the preseason polls, and they rolled through the regular season in their first year in the SEC, except when they had to play the Georgia Bulldogs. The Bulldogs beat them in Texas during the regular season and then Texas met Georgia again in the SEC Championship and they would end lose to the Bulldogs in overtime. They controlled Clemson in the first of their playoff games, but barley survived the overtime scare against Arizona State. Now they are a win away from returning to the title game for the first time since 2009. The Ohio State Buckeyes came into the season as the No. 2 ranked team in the preseason polls and rattled off five straight wins to start the season as Will Howard led his team to blow out win after blow out win, but they would lose a heart breaker to No. 3 ranked Oregon and suffered their first defeat of the season after Howard made a costly time management mistake at the end of the game. They would win their next five games including two wins against top 5 opponents, but inexplicably lost to their bitter rivals Michigan on the final game of the regular season. They got into the playoff off, and met Clemson first before getting their revenge against Oregon in the Rose Bowl. Now they have a chance to get back to the National Championship for the first time for the second time in five years. This time they will look to win it all. The Ohio State Buckeyes took on an Oregon team that came into the College Football Playoffs as the Big Ten Champions and the No. 1 ranked team in the country, but the Buckeyes jumped all over them from the start. They scored on six of their first seven possessions, and took a 34-0 lead in the second quarter as Will Howard tossed all of his three TDs passes in the opening three minutes. Oregon scored TDs on each of their drives on both sides of the halftime break to cut into the lead but TreVeyon Henderson stretch the lead out with a TD run late in the 3rd quarter to make it 41-15 and the Buckeyes downed the top team in the playoff to set up this semifinal match up against the Longhorns. It was a New Year’s Day showdown between the Texas Longhorns and the Arizona State Sun Devils and it was an overtime thriller in the Chik-Fil-A Peach Bowl. The Longhorns got off to a 17-3 lead as the Arizona State offense struggled to move the ball. Quinn Ewers hit DeAndre Moore with an early first quarter touchdown and then Silas Bolden took a 75 yard punt return to the house, but ASU would battle back on the shoulders of their running back Cam Skattebo who passed and ran for a TD in the fourth quarter to tie the game up at 24-24. After Bert Auburn missed a 38 yard field goal to win the game at the last second of regulation, Scattebow scored a three yard TD in OT, but Ewers answered back with a deep pass to Matthew Golden to even up the score. In the second OT session Ewers put the Longhorns ahead with a 25 yard TD pass to Gunnar Helm and that was enough to close the Sun Devils and stamp their ticket to the Semifinal. Hello everyone and welcome to Dallas, Texas where to teams who were ranked in the top five of the preseason polls have delivered all year long, and are now one game away from the National Championship. Both of these two teams had to go through the first two rounds of the new 12 team College Football Playoff after finishing outside of the top four, and both teams have used their high flying offenses to get them to this point of the season. Expect fireworks tonight as Will Howard and the Buckeyes take on Drew Ewers and the Longhorns in a highly anticipated semifinal from the Lone Star State. The second and final spot in the College Football Playoff National Championship is up for grabs tonight from Dallas. Two perennial power houses meet in a clash of titans from AT&T Stadium as the Texas Longhorns and the Ohio State Buckeyes square off in the Goodyear Cotton Bowl Classic and AS English will be with you all night long providing live coverage, stats, highlights and analysis of tonight’s semifinal match up.",

                "content": "If not listed, please contact your TV provider. For the first time since 2012, Notre Dame will play for a national title. The (7) Fighting Irish advanced to the College Football Playoff National Championship with a 27-24 win against (6) Penn State in Thursday evening's Orange Bowl. Fittingly, in a game that saw four lead changes, it came down to some last-second heroics. Penn State had a chance to win the game. The Nittany Lions took possession on their own 15-yard line with 52 seconds to play and two timeouts. Needing yardage to get into field goal range, they decided to lean on the arm of quarterback Drew Allar, who hopped around in the pocket and tried the middle of the field, where Notre Dame defensive back Christian Gray made a diving interception to give his team possession in Penn State territory. After a couple of runs and a 10-yard connection between quarterback Riley Leonard and wide receiver Jaden Greathouse, Notre Dame worked the ball into field goal range. Kicker Mitch Jeter -- who is now 7 of 8 during Notre Dame's College Football Playoff run -- nailed a 41-yard field goal to send his team to Atlanta. Penn State tried to lateral its way to a miraculous win on one final possession, but Notre Dame's defense was up to the task. This loss especially stings for Penn State, given that it led 10-0 late into the first half. The Nittany Lions also scored 14 unanswered points early in the fourth quarter to take a 24-17 lead -- stoning a 17-0 run from Notre Dame in the process -- and, of course, possessed the ball with less than a minute to play. CBS Sports was here throughout with updates, highlights and analysis. Read on below for takeaways from Notre Dame's win over Penn State. Penn State edge rusher Abdul Carter's status was up in the air ahead of the Orange Bowl. He suffered a left shoulder injury in the quarterfinal round against Boise State that caused him to miss a majority of the game, and most of his left arm was wrapped tonight. Still, he suited up and made his presence felt. Carter finished the game with five total tackles, two for a loss, and one sack. He also collected several quarterback pressures while moving all over the field in Penn State's pass-rush packages. One of those pressured forced Notre Dame quarterback Riley Leonard into throwing an interception. Carter did all that in spite of the fact his left shoulder was still bothering him. Now he's likely off to the NFL Draft, where most projections have him going off the board early in the first round. Penn State running back Nick Singleton deserves special mention for his Herculean efforts. The Nittany Lions star carried the ball 15 times for 84 yards and scored all three of his team's offensive touchdowns. Penn State tight end Tyler Warren also did a lot for the Nittany Lions and finished the game with 96 total yards. But those efforts underscored a serious problem for Penn State, one that tanked its hopes as the game wore on: the Nittany Lions seriously lack in playmakers on the outside. Penn State's wide receivers did not record a single catch on just five targets. Though Warren and Singleton are excellent options, the lack of a threat elsewhere allowed Notre Dame's defense to focus on stopping that dynamic duo. Penn State's final drive was an example: no one was able to get open deep or break a big play. Compare that to Notre Dame, which had a star emerge in sophomore wide receiver Jaden Greathouse. He was a safety valve with the biggest play of the night -- a 54-yard score with a pair of ankle breakers that tied the game at 24 with just under five minutes left to play in the fourth quarter. Third down is the money down for a reason. In a game where Penn State and Notre Dame traded blows and finished with relatively comparable stats (though the Nittany Lions did have a significant rushing advantage) third downs made all the difference. Penn State did almost everything wrong in third-down situations. The Nittany Lions were 3 of 11 and coverted just one in the second half. Notre Dame went 11 of 17 despite some long-to-go situations, gaining an average of seven yards and converting all eight attempts on third-and-short (4 yards or fewer). This is the same Notre Dame team that lost to Northern Illinois early in the year. This is the same Notre Dame team that has lost several of its top players, including a potential first-round cornerback in Benjamin Morrison and its leading sack artist in defensive lineman Rylie Mills, to injury. Through it all, the Fighting Irish have displayed a tremendous amount of grit and determination. That grit was on full display in the Orange Bowl. Quarterback Riley Leonard left the game late in the first half with an apparent head injury. He returned for the first drive in the third quarter, completed a 36 yard pass to Aneyas Williams and then rushed for a 3-yard touchdown to tie the game at 10. One of the key blockers on that play? Offensive lineman Charles Jagusah, who tore his pectoral muscle less than a month before the 2024 season began and only recently started playing again. Early in the fourth quarter, Notre Dame running back Jeremiyah Love -- who has been limited with a knee injury throughout the College Football Playoff -- plowed through three Penn State defenders and bullied his way into the end zone to give Notre Dame its first lead of the game. Then, with less than a minute to play, Notre Dame cornerback Christian Gray -- who has stepped into an increased role this year due to Morrison's injury -- was the one that intercepted Penn State quarterback Drew Allar. Notre Dame keeps finding a way, and now it's one win from a national title. Notre Dame kicker Mitch Jeter just nailed a 41-yard field goal to give Notre Dame a late lead with less than 10 seconds to play. Penn State will get chance to either tie the game or win, but it's going to take some real heroics since the Nittany Lions are out of timeouts. That was an inexcusable mistake from Penn State quarterback Drew Allar. Trying to lead the Nittany Lions on a potential game-winning drive, he instead threw an ill-advised interception to Notre Dame defensive back Christian Gray. Now Fighting Irish take over in Penn State territory with three timeouts. This after Notre Dame fumbled its own opportunity to potentially walk the game off. On third-and-5 from Penn State's 44-yard line -- not far from field goal range -- quarterback Riley Leonard dropped back to pass. He came under immediate pressure and sacked by Coziah Izzard, forcing the Fighting Irish to punt instead. Penn State will take over at its own 15-yard line with 47 seconds and two timeouts left. As they always say, football is a game of runs. Penn State appeared to be in firm control after ripping off a 14-0 scoring streak, but Notre Dame just swung momentum right back in its favor with a huge touchdown play. Wide receiver Jaden Greathouse got open in Penn State's secondary after a defensive back slipped and fell. Fighting Irish quarterback Riley Leonard hit Greathouse in stride, which allowed him to dance around another Penn State defender in the open field and finish the play by sprinting into the end zone. It's the first passing touchdown for either team and, at 54 yards, is also the longest play all evening. Might want to change Penn State's mascot to the Nick Singletons, because he is literally carrying the offense in the Orange Bowl. The Nittany Lions got the ball inside Notre Dame's 10-yard line thanks to a pass interference penalty on Notre Dame's Adon Shuler. There, Singleton took another handoff and dragged a Notre Dame defender into the end zone for his third touchdown of the night. Penn State was granted that scoring opportunity after Notre Dame quarterback Riley Leonard threw his second interception of the game. This is just Leonard's second multi-interception game of his career; the other was the NIU loss. That was a back-breaking mistake from Notre Dame quarterback Riley Leonard. One play after Notre Dame tied the game with a big touchdown, Leonard stared tight end Mitchell Evans down and thew an interception to Penn State's Dani Dennis-Sutton, who did a good job of undercutting Evans' route and reading Leonard's eyes. It's Penn State's second interception of the night, and it gives the Nittany Lions possession just outside field goal range. Not to be outdone, Penn State running back Nick Singleton just had an incredibly tough run of his own. On second-and-goal from Notre Dame's 7-yard line, Singleton took a handoff, changed direction, made one Notre Dame defender missed and then plowed through another would-be tackler near the goal line to score his second touchdown of the evening. That capped a huge drive for Penn State, which moved the ball down the field -- largely without star tight end Tyler Warren, who missed a chunk in the injury tent after a hard landing -- thanks to some solid play from quarterback Drew Allar. The Nittany Lions needed that answer after allowing 17 straight points to Notre Dame. Notre Dame running back Jeremiyah Love's knee looks alright. It certainly didn't keep him plowing through Penn State's defense for a crucial touchdown to open the fourth quarter. Love took an inside handoff and bounced off one Penn State defender. As he got near the line of scrimmage, he met a crowd of would-be tacklers, bowled through them and stretched the ball to break into the end zone. It's Notre Dame's second rushing touchdown of the night, and it gives the Irish their first lead. Penn State's offense, which managed just 25 yards in the third quarter, has to find its footing. Entering halftime, it appeared as if Notre Dame was taking on water. But a last-second field goal, and then a hot start to the third quarter, have momentum on the Fighting Irish's side as they enter the fourth quarter of their Orange Bowl showdown against Penn State. Key to Notre Dame's turnaround has been its play in the trenches on both sides of the ball. Though the offensive line has still allowed some leaks, it has done a much better job of opening lanes in the running game and keeping a clean pocket for quarterback Riley Leonard, who scored on a rushing touchdown early in the third quarter to tie the game at 10-all. He also had a big 36-yard completion to Aneyas Williams to put the Irish in scoring range. Defensively, Notre Dame allowed just 25 yards -- including -3 yards rushing -- in the third quarter. The Fighting Irish also got their first sack of the game, courtesy of Rod Heard II, to force a punt near the end of the third frame. Notre Dame will open the fourth quarter with the ball and a chance to take its first lead of the evening. Penn State has had some problems fielding punts in the Orange Bowl. Thus far, none of the decisions have ended in disaster, but it has made things more difficult for the Nittany Lions. After allowing a touchdown on the opening drive in the third quarter, Penn State's defense buckled down and just forced a punt. Return man Zion Tracy, instead of calling for a fair catch in the face of Notre Dame's punt coverage unit, decided to field the kick at the 15-yard line. He was blasted by a Notre Dame gunner and just held on to the ball. Earlier in the first quarter, Tracy called for a fair catch at Penn State's 2-yard line, so he's having some trouble making decisions on the fly. Game on. At one point near the end of the first half, this one seemed to be slipping away from Notre Dame. But a last-second field goal in the second quarter apparently gave the Fighting Irish the momentum they needed to swing the Orange Bowl right back. Riley Leonard looks fine. After exiting the game late in the first half, he led Notre Dame's offense onto the field in the third quarter and looked dialed in. He delivered a perfect 36-yard pass to Aneyas Williams to put Notre Dame in striking distance, and then finished the scoring drive a couple of plays later by rushing into the end zone from three yards out. Notre Dame's offensive line needed that drive. The Irish did a good job creating space in the run game and keeping the pocket clean after a rough first half. The pressure is back on Penn State now. Notre Dame will receive the second half's opening kickoff. There's plenty to keep an eye on as the Fighting Irish take the field. Top of the list is the status of quarterback Riley Leonard, who exited late in the first half with an apparent head injury. Backup Steve Angeli did well to get Notre Dame in field goal range as time expired, but Notre Dame has crafted its offense around Leonard this year. Notre Dame also has a couple of offensive linemen, including starting left tackle Anthonie Knapp, that have been dealing with injuries. Penn State leads Notre Dame 10-3 after the first half of play in the Orange Bowl. The Nittany Lions scored all 10 of their points in the second quarter thanks to a renewed focus on the run game and a pair of lengthy drives that took plenty of time off of the clock. Penn State took 14 plays to kick a 20-yard field goal near the start of the second quarter, and then embarked on a 17-play, 90-yard drive that ended in a 5-yard touchdown with just over two minutes left in the half. The Nittany Lions got 81 of those 90 yards running the ball thanks to an offensive linethat imposed its will. Penn State averaged a brisk 5.4 yards per carry in the first half. Tight end Tyler Warren, who also had 17 yards receiving, contributed 21 yards to Penn State's rushing attack. Penn State's defense also deserves plenty of credit. Notre Dame averaged 22.3 points per game in the first half over its 12-game winning streak entering the Orange Bowl but scored just three points on a last-second field goal in the second quarter. This is also just the second time this season that Notre Dame has trailed at the half. Like the offense, Penn State's defense did a lot of its work in the trenches. Despite having his left arm heavily wrapped, Penn State edge rusher Abdul Carter was a consistent presence in Notre Dame's backfield. He was one of five Penn State players with at least a half tackle for loss and also contributed one of Penn State's three sacks in the first half. To make matters worse for Notre Dame, more key injuries starting to mount. Quarterback Riley Leonard left the game late in the second quarter with an apparent head injury and his status for the second half is up in the air. Notre Dame also lost left tackle Anthonie Knapp and starting guard Rocco Spindler, which undoubtedly contributed to Penn State's dominance at the line of scrimmage. The blows keep mounting for Notre Dame, which is in a 10-0 hole near the end of the first half. Starting quarterback Riley Leonard just took another hit and went to Notre Dame's medical tent at the behest of the game officials. Backup quarterback Steve Angeli entered the game for Leonard, who was able to walk off the field under his own power. What a drive for Penn State. The Nittany Lions moved Notre Dame off of the ball to embark on a 15-play, 90-yard drive that took 7:17 off of the clock and ended with a 5-yard rushing touchdown from running back Nick Singleton. Penn State gathered 81 of those 90 yards on the ground, as Singleton and Kaytron Allen consistently carried the ball for gains of at least five yards. Tight end Tyler Warren also rushed for 21 yards and caught a screen pass for a first down on fourth-and-2 in the red zone. Penn State is in the midst of a dominant drive. The Nittany Lions have worked the ball all the way to the red zone behind a strong rushing effort. They are winning at the point of attack thus far, as running backs Kaytron Allen and Nick Singleton are consistently getting chunk gains to keep the chains moving. Tight end Tyler Warren has also factored heavily into the game plan. He converted a fourth-and-2 with a quick screen catch and also had an athletic run earlier in the drive that turned what looked like a big loss into a gain of nine. Notre Dame starting left tackle Anthonie Knapp was injured following a first-down run from quarterback Riley Leonard. It appeared as if Leonard fell on Knapp's legs as he was getting tackled. Knapp was slow to get up after the play and eventually fell to the turf before making it back to the huddle. He was taken to the locker room with the help of trainers. The Fighting Irish can hardly afford anymore injuries -- especially along the offensive line, where they entered the 2024 season shorthanded. Penn State just took an early lead off of a 20-yard field goal from kicker Ryan Barker, but the Nittany Lions definitely left points on the board. On third-and-goal from Notre Dame's 1-yard line, quarterback Drew Allar short-armed an easy throw in the flats to running back Nick Singleton, who was unable to make the catch. A better throw from Allar and Singleton would have walked into the end zone. Settling for the points was a smart move, though there may have been temptation to go for it. Penn State and Notre Dame are locked in a defensive battle after one quarter of play in the Orange Bowl. Moving the ball hasn't necessarily been an issue -- both teams have at least made it around midfield, and each has had decent chunk gains on offense -- but finishing drives has been an issue. It is a testament to the defensive strength in this matchup. Penn State has been especially impressive. The Nittany Lions forced a crucial turnover, courtesy of a Zakee Wheatley interception, near the end of the first quarter to set up a prime scoring opportunity. Though he has a heavy wrap on his left arm, Penn State edge rusher Abdul Carter is dominating the game early on. He already has one tackle and a couple of quick quarterback pressures -- one of which led to Penn State's interception -- as Notre Dame does not have an answer for him. In spite of the slug fest thus far, Penn State will have a prime scoring opportunity when the second quarter starts. The Nittany Lions face third-and-goal from Notre Dame's 1-yard line. Penn State is going to have favorable field position after the defense forced yet another turnover. On third-and-12 from Notre Dame's 33-yard line, Irish quarterback Riley Leonard tried to hit a wide receiver on a deep crossing route. But the ball sailed well over the intended receiver's head and Penn State defensive back Zakee Wheatley jumped into the air to snag the overthrow. The Nittany Lions will take over on their own 42-yard line with a premium chance to break the scoring seal. Penn State edge rusher Abdul Carter has been favoring his heavily wrapped left arm, but that hasn't stopped him from having a big impact on this game thus far. On Notre Dame's first offensive drive, he cut a quarterback run short with a quick tackle. Then, on the first play of the Irish's second drive, he ripped into the backfield and applied immediate pressure on Riley Leonard, who was forced to throw the ball away before Carter could meet him. He also got pressure on Leonard a couple plays later in the same drive, which resulted in Leonard throwing an interception. Carter still has explosiveness off the edge, even if one of his arms is clipped. Both Notre Dame and Penn State have had an opportunity to make an offensive impression, and each has achieved a nice chunk gain. For the Nittany Lions, quarterback Drew Allar completed a short pass to running back Nick Singleton for a gain of 23 yards. Notre Dame's explosive play came on a 32-yard connection between quarterback Riley Leonard and tight end Mitchell Evans, who made a nice catch with a defensive back draped all over him and picked up extra yardage while tip-toeing the sidelines. But in both instances, the drives stalled around midfield and ended with a punt. It could take a while for a breakthrough to happen. Penn State looked like it was building some early momentum, especially after a 23-yard completion to running back Nick Singleton out of the backfield, but Notre Dame's defense locked things down near midfield. A false start on Penn State gave the Nittany Lions third-and-14 and a short pass to Kaytron Allen came up well short of the sticks. It's worth watching how Notre Dame running back Jeremiyah Love looks when the Fighting Irish's offense takes the field. He's been dealing with a nagging knee injury, and he was sporting a brace as Notre Dame went through its pregame warm ups. Notre Dame won the toss and deferred its selection to the second half, which means that Penn State will start with the ball. In what's expected to be a low scoring, defensive battle, the Nittany Lions have an opportunity to set the tone with their scripted drive. Expect offensive coordinator Andy Kotelnicki to get creative with his play-calling to try and find weaknesses against an excellent Notre Dame defense. It seems like, at some point, all of the injuries will catch up to Notre Dame. The Irish are in an especially precarious position if Love can't play given what he means to the offense. Yet, Notre Dame has more than made do with its lot as the Irish have continued carving a path of dominance all the way through the postseason against teams deemed by the selection committee as worthy of playing for a national championship. Notre Dame's played dominant along the lines of scrimmage, and it has a proven winner at quarterback in Riley Leonard, who has literally put his body on the line to keep his team's hopes alive. I'm not going to pick against the Irish at this point; they've shown no signs of slowing down. Pick: Notre Dame -2.5 (-105) Notre Dame players and staff members are dealing with a \"flu or a virus\" ahead of Thursday night's College Football Playoff semifinal against Penn State, a school official confirmed in a statement to CBS Sports' Brandon Marcello. The statement downplayed the severity of the outbreak, which it says occurred over the past 10 days to two weeks, and maintains that it will not impact any availability for the Orange Bowl. \"It will have no impact on the game,\" Notre Dame's statement read. \"Beaux Collins was impacted in the Sugar Bowl, but still played and was on the mend during the game.\" © 2004-2024 CBS Interactive.

                "content": "When Mitch Jeter went out with injury earlier this season, Notre Dame was statistically the worst field goal kicking team in the nation. Let's just say the Irish will be kissing their clovers they have their kicker back. He drilled the 41 yarder to call game and send Notre Dame back to the National Championship. They will be looking to return the title back to South Bend for the first time since 1988, but before they set their sights either Texas or Ohio State, they will celebrate this Orange Bowl win. Penn States defense made a stop and gave Drew Allar and the offense a chance to win it late in the fourth quarter, but the Jr. QB who has thrown 53 touchdown and just 9 INTs in his career made the worst mistake you could possibly make in this situation and the rest is history. Allar went 12/23 for 135 yards, but his last throw was the biggest one of the game as Christian Gray set up ND in perfect position to win it. As always their fearless leader, Riley Leonard, rallied his guys and tied the game up with this 54 yard pass to Jaden Greathouse to took it all the way into the end zone and tied the game with under five minutes to go. Leonard ended the game with 223 yards 1 TD and 2 INTs on 15/23 passing, but he made the big plays when he needed to, and they needed this bomb to Greathouse to level things up late in the game. Allar was picked off in the end zone just a few played after the Leonard interception, but a pass interference penalty against the Irish gave Penn State a first down inside the 10 yard line and Singleton completed his hat trick of touchdowns as the Nittany Lions retook the lead. On the next play from scrimmage following Singleton's second TD run, Riley Leonard was picked off by Dani Dennis-Sutton and momentum completely shifted for Penn State who had a short field to work with after forcing the turnover. Losing the lead seemed to ignite the Nittany Lions as Drew Allar had a couple of long pass plays to set up this Singleton touchdown to set up a do or die last 10 minutes from Miami. ND seemingly had all the momentum ending the first half and starting the second. They scored 17 unanswered points to take the lead with this tough Jeremiyah Love TD run early in the fourth quarter. The Irish would finish the game with 115 yards rushing, and Love led the way with 45 yards on 11 carries. Notre Dame saw their starting QB and leader Riley Leonard take a big hit and get knocked out of the game for a drive and Steve Angeli came in and lead the team down the field and set up a field goal to get ND on the board. Coming out of the break, the Irish started to use the ground game, after having just 15 yards rushing in the first half. They ran it for 44 yards on this drive alone and that seemed to open up the passing game for the rest of the way. Leonard came back in the game after half and he tied the game up with a TD run to start the third quarter. The Nittany Lions offense went to the hurry up after taking the field goal lead and marched down the field on the shoulders of Nick Singleton who punched in his first of three TDs. The Notre Dame Fighting Irish are heading to the College Football Playoff National Championship after a dramatic ending from Miami as they took down the Penn State Nittany Lions in the Orange Bowl. Mitch Jeter kicked the winning field goal in a 27-24 game that went down to the wire. We didn't expect many fireworks between these two teams but that's exactly what we got. It took a little while for the offense to kick in, and what ignited it was a defensive play made by Penn State. That led to a Nittany Lion field goal after getting down to the one yard line but getting stopped on a goal to go situation. We'll get to the rest of the highlights in a second. But first, Mitch Jeter with the biggest kick of his life, and he drills it. Penn State made a big stop and had a chance to take the lead, but Allar's pass was picked by Christian Gray and that set up the Fighting Irish with a chance to win it in the last minute.

As always the pre kickoff festivities are taking a little longer than usual, but it's coin flip time and the Fighting Irish win the toss and they differ to the second half. Penn State will start the CFP Semifinal with the ball. It all comes down to next Monday. The winner of tonight’s game and the winner of tomorrow’s Cotton Bowl will meet at Mercedes Benz Stadium for a chance at the CFP Nation Championship. The last time this game was played here in Atlanta was back in 2018 when the Alabama Crimson Tide beat the Georgia Bulldogs. Notre Dame has 11 titles, Penn State has two, Texas has four and Ohio State has eight. These are teams with massive championship pedigrees. Remember, this is just one of two CFP semifinals this week. After Notre Dame and Penn State duke it out tonight in Miami, the Texas Longhorns and the Ohio State Buckeyes will play tomorrow in the Cotton Bowl from Dallas. That will lead us into a two game NFL playoff slate on Saturday featuring the Chargers vs. Texans and Steeles vs. Ravens. Sunday we have the Broncos vs. Bills, Packers vs. Eagles and Commanders vs. Buccaneers. We will finish the football frenzy with a Monday Night match up between the Vikings and the Rams and remember you can follow all the action right here on AS English. This is the first time we have seen the 12 team playoff, and there is a lot to digest after the first few weeks. It’s tough for the NCAA to get everything right on the first attempt, and heading into the semifinals we see no teams that had a first round bye still alive in the CFP. The teams that were supposed to be favorites and have the advantage of getting the BYE week, looked rusty and were eventually knocked out. This will be Notre Dame and Penn State’s third game since the end of their “season” and it seems like these teams are back in midseason form after basically starting a new season three weeks ago. These playoffs have shown us rust is winning in the rust vs. rest debate. Penn State have one of the best one-two punches in the league with Kaytron Allen and Nicholas Singleton in their backfield. Both RBs have run for 1,000+ yards, with Allen rising for 10 yards more (1,026) but he has almost 50 carries more than Allen. Singleton is more of a dual threat back, having caught 39 passes fo 342 yards and five TDs through the air. Together they have 17 TDs on the ground and another 7 TDs receiving. This is a team that’ has a nice balance of their run and pass game, but over the last two games their defense has stepped up and allowed just 24 points in two games. There has been a lot of talk about Riley Leonard and his ability to lead his team and his will to win. The senior QB wasn’t up for any end of season awards for his quarterbacking play, but he is a winner. He threw for just 2,383 yards, 18 TDs and 6 INTs this season, but he is equally or even more dangerous with his feet. He’s got 831 yards rushing on the season and scored another 15 TDs with his feet, but the question is can he lead this offense tonight if Penn State stops the run and he has to pass the ball? He had just 90 yards passing against Georgia last week, but did throw a TD pass right before the half to swing the momentum in favor of ND, and ran for 80 yards. If the Irish are going to win, it’s going to come down to how their QB plays. The question coming into this game, and really all of head coach James Franklin’s time in South Bend is can he win the big one? After coming into the season ranked in the Top 10 in the nation, they won their first seven games but only one of them was against a ranked team, and that was No. 19 Illinois. They lost their first game to 4th ranked Ohio State 20-13 at the beginning of November, but then they won four straight to set up a meeting with the Oregon Ducks in the Big 10 Championship. They lost that game by a TD, and again the questions around Franklin started to surface. Wins over SMU and Boise State have given their coach a little leeway but now come the big big games. Notre Dame came into the season ranked in the top 10 in the preseason polls, but suffered a heartbreaking defeat to the Norther Illinois Huskies in their second game of the season after Mitch Jeter had his 62 yard game-winning field goal blocked as time ran out. Since then the Fighting Irish have been perfect. They have won 12 straight including but the question remains? Who have the Fighting Irish beat this year? They beat three ranked teams in the regular season none higher than 15th and beat an over achieving Indiana team in the first round of the playoffs before beating a Georgia team with a back up who had only thrown a handful of passes in his college career before last week’s game. After taking down SMU in the opening game of their playoff schedule, the Penn State Nittany Lions met Ashton Jenty and the Boise State Broncos. They contained the leading rusher in the country to just 104 yards on 30 carries, meanwhile Drew Allar threw two of his three TDs in the first quarter to take a 14-0 lead. Kaytron Allen and 134 yards on a day that Penn State ran for over 200 total yards and Nicholas Singleton capped the game with a 58 yard TD run to take a 31-14 lead with under 5:00 to go in the fourth quarter to set State up with a massive match up against Notre Dame in the Orange Bowl from Miami. After winning the battle for Indiana in a frigid South Bend to open their College Football Playoff slate, the fighting Irish met the Georgia Bulldogs who had won two of the last three CFP National Championships. With the Bulldogs’ starting QB Carson Beck out with injury they went to their back up Gunner Stockton and the Fighting Irish defense shut him down for most of the game. It was a low scoring first half until the final minute of the second quarter. Mitch Jeter kicked a field goal to put ND up 6-3, on the next play from scrimmage, Stockton was strip sacked by RJ Oben which led to a 13 yard TD pass from Riley Leonard to Beaux Collins to end the first half. The Fighting Irish got the ball to start the second half and Jayden Harrison took the kick off 98 yards for a TD and the Irish went from a 3-3 game with 43 seconds left in the first half to leading 20-3 fifteen seconds into the third quarter. They would hold off the Bulldogs and win 23-10 to reach the CFP semifinal tonight against Penn State. Hello everyone and welcome to Miami where two legendary teams are back fighting for the top prize in college football after years trying to keep up with the top dogs in the game. They have advanced through the first two games of the expanded college football playoff and now they are just a game away from the National Championship. Notre Dame has only lost one game all season and that was back in early September. If they want to get to the big game, they will have to extend either win streak tonight against a Penn State team that has dominated both of their playoff games after losing their Big Ten Championship to Oregon to end the regular season. The stage it set. Two of the best teams in the history of the college football, with a chance to get to the title game here from Miami. Sit back, relax and enjoy. We’ve got a throwback battle of two of the most historic, prolific schools in college football history tonight in the Capital One Orange Bowl. It’s been a long time since either of these two schools have been in the running for a National Championship but they have turned back the clock tonight one of them will punch their ticket to the College Football Playoff National Championship. It’s the Notre Dame Fighting Irish taking on the Penn State Nittany Lions in the CFP semifinal, and AS English will be with you all night providing live coverage, stats, highlights and analysis of tonight’s game form Hard Rock Stadium.",

In a game between two of the most storied college football programs in the country, this game absolutely delivered. Mitch Jeter hit a 41-yard field goal with eight seconds left and Notre Dame advanced to the College Football Playoff championship game with a 27-24 win over Penn State in the Orange Bowl. With the game tied at 24-all, Penn State quarterback Drew Allar threw a pick to Chistian Gray in the final minute, giving Notre Dame the ball back on Penn State's 42. Quarterback Riley Leonard, who left the game for a series in the second quarter after taking a big hit, led Notre Dame into field goal range. He hit his receiver Jaden Greathouse for 10 yards to the Penn State 25 to set up a manageable 41-yard field goal for Jeter. NOTRE DAME'S KICK IS GOOD ‼️pic.twitter.com/gcawT95nAQ Leonard was the Orange Bowl MVP after going 15 for 23 for 223 yards, one touchdown and two interceptions. He also rushed for 35 yards and a touchdown. For Penn State, Nick Singleton had 15 carries for 84 yards and three touchdowns. Allar was 11-for-22 for 138 yards and one intererception. Now, Notre Dame will play the Texas-Ohio State winner for a national title for the first time in over a decade. It was a huge come-from-behind victory for the Irish, and a ton of credit has to go to head coach Marcus Freeman for this one.

                "title": "Restrictions on TikTok in the United States - Wikipedia",
                "content": "TikTok has sparked concerns over potential user data collection and influence operations by the Chinese government, leading to restrictions and bans in the United States. In January 2020, the United States Army and Navy banned TikTok on government devices after the Defense Department labeled it a security risk. Before the policy change, army recruiters had been using the platform to attract young people. Unofficial promotional videos continue to be posted on TikTok under personal accounts, drawing the ire of government officials, but they have also helped boost the number of enlistees; several accounts have millions of views and followers.[1][2][3] In 2020, the United States government announced that it was considering banning the Chinese social media platform TikTok upon a request from then-president Donald Trump, who viewed the app as a national security threat. The result was that TikTok owner ByteDance—which initially planned on selling a small portion of TikTok to an American company—agreed to divest TikTok to prevent a ban in the United States and in other countries where restrictions are also being considered due to privacy concerns, which themselves are mostly related to its ownership by a firm based in China. TikTok later announced plans to file legal action challenging the order's transactional prohibitions with U.S. companies. The lawsuit against the Trump Administration's order was filed on August 24, 2020, with TikTok arguing that the order was motivated by Trump's efforts to boost re-election support through protectionist trade policies aimed at China. A separate suit filed the same day by TikTok's U.S. technical program manager Patrick Ryan against Trump and Secretary of Commerce Wilbur Ross sought a temporary restraining order, arguing that his due process rights were violated and the ban was an \"unconstitutional taking\" of Ryan's property under the Fifth Amendment; the suit also claimed Trump's action was likely a retaliation because of TikTok videos organizing pranks against a recent Trump campaign rally. On June 9, 2021, the Biden Administration issued Executive Order 14034, \"Protecting Americans' Sensitive Data from Foreign Adversaries\" (\"EO 14034\"). EO 14034, overturning three Executive Orders signed by Donald Trump: Executive Order 13942, Executive Order 13943, and Executive Order 13971. Despite revoking these Executive Orders, the Biden Administration's EO 14304 has called upon other federal agencies to continue a broad review of foreign-owned applications set to continuously inform the President of the risk that the applications pose to personal data and national security.[4] The White House said that, \"The Biden Administration is committed to promoting an open, interoperable, reliable, and secure Internet; protecting human rights online and offline; and supporting a vibrant, global digital economy.\"[5] In December 2022, Senator Marco Rubio and representatives Mike Gallagher and Raja Krishnamoorthi introduced the Averting the National Threat of Internet Surveillance, Oppressive Censorship and Influence, and Algorithmic Learning by the Chinese Communist Party Act (ANTI-SOCIAL CCP Act), which would prohibit Chinese- and Russian-owned social networks from doing business in the United States.[6][7] On December 30, 2022, President Joe Biden signed the No TikTok on Government Devices Act, prohibiting the use of the app on devices owned by the federal government, with some exceptions.[8] Days after the Biden administration called on ByteDance, which owns TikTok, to sell the platform or face a ban, law enforcement officials disclosed that an investigation into TikTok was taking place. On March 17, 2023, the United States Department of Justice (DOJ) and the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) officially launched an investigation of TikTok, including allegations that the company spied on American journalists.[9] On January 25, 2023, Missouri Senator Josh Hawley introduced a bill to ban the platform nationwide. That bill was blocked by a forced vote in the Senate on 29 March 2023.[10] In February and March 2023, the DATA Act and the RESTRICT Act were both introduced in the House of Representatives and Senate, respectively. The DATA Act, introduced on February 24 by Michael McCaul, aimed to ban selling non-public personal data to third-party buyers.[11] On March 7, Senator Mark Warner introduced the RESTRICT Act: if passed, it would give the Secretary of Commerce authority to review business transactions made by IT service and product vendors tied to designated \"foreign adversaries\" if they present an undue threat to national security, and have more than one million active users in the United States. The legislation would allow for the enforcement of orders and other mitigation measures, which could include mandatory divestment, or being prohibited from doing business in the United States.[12] On March 13, 2024, the United States House of Representatives passed the Protecting Americans from Foreign Adversary Controlled Applications Act (H.R. 7521) with largely bipartisan support from Democrat and Republican-party representatives.[13][14] It would ban operations related to the app completely within the country unless ByteDance makes a qualified divestiture as determined by the US president.[15] After modifications, the act passed the House again[16][17] and the United States Senate[18] before it was signed into law by Joe Biden on April 24, 2024. The earliest the ban could go into effect if not sold would be January 19, 2025. An additional 90 days could be issued on the deadline.[19] TikTok, Inc. v. Garland is a lawsuit brought by social media company TikTok against the United States government. Chinese internet technology company ByteDance Ltd. and its subsidiary TikTok, Inc. claim that the Protecting Americans from Foreign Adversary Controlled Applications Act (PAFACA) violates the Freedom of Speech Clause of the First Amendment, the Bill of Attainder Clause of Article One, Section Nine, and the Due Process Clause and Takings Clause of the Fifth Amendment.[20][21][22] The law bans or requires divestment of social media apps meeting specified criteria that are owned by foreign corporations from, or by corporations owned by foreign nationals from, countries designated as U.S. foreign adversaries and that have been determined by the President to present a significant national security threat, and explicitly defines TikTok and any application operated by a ByteDance subsidiary as a \"foreign adversary controlled application\" under the law.[23] Trump campaigned on promises of not banning TikTok, despite his original opposition.[34][35] Trump's cabinet picks for the FCC, as well as most Republicans, remain in favor of banning the app.[34] As of April 2023,[36][37] at least 34 out of 50 states have announced or enacted bans on state government agencies, employees, and contractors using TikTok on government-issued devices. State bans only affect government employees and do not prohibit civilians from having or using the app on their personal devices. Some public universities have also banned TikTok on campus Wi-Fi and university-owned computers. These include, but are not limited to: On April 14, 2023, Montana became the first state to pass legislation banning TikTok on all personal devices operating within state lines, and barring app stores from offering TikTok for download.[86][87][88] Governor Greg Gianforte signed the bill, Senate Bill (SB) 419, into law on May 17,[89][90] claiming he had banned TikTok \"to protect Montanans’ personal and private data from the Chinese Communist Party.\"[91] The law was scheduled to take effect in January 2024.[89] However, Montana content creators filed suit against the state once the bill was signed.[92][93] The creators' lawsuit is financed and directed by TikTok, with law firm Davis Wright Tremaine representing them.[94] The ban was blocked by US District Judge Donald W. Molloy on December 1, 2023, as he stated the ban \"infringes on the Constitutional right of users and businesses\". Due to the block, the ban did not come into effect as planned.[95] On January 2, 2024, Montana filed a notice to appeal the ruling to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit.[96] Groups such as the ACLU and the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) opposed the ban, stating it constituted \"censorship\" and \"would set an alarming precedent for excessive government control over how Montanans use the internet.\"[97] Lobbying group NetChoice argued that the ban is an unconstitutional bill of attainder and also violates the freedom of speech clause of the First Amendment.[98] Hours after the bill was signed into law, five TikTok creators filed a lawsuit in the United States District Court for the District of Montana against the state. A spokeswoman for Montana Attorney General Austin Knudsen said that the state is \"fully prepared to defend the law\".[99] In a preliminary ruling November 30, 2023, federal judge Donald Molloy blocked the law citing constitutional concerns.[100] Specifically, Judge Molloy wrote that \"the State fails to show how SB 419 is constitutionally permissible.\"[101][102] The law faces technical restrictions. The App Store and Google Play Store track users by country, not by state, and would need to define the behavior when a user crosses state lines. While Apple and Google may be able to use IP addresses to track device locations, users may be able to use a virtual private network (VPN) to circumvent the restriction. If these app stores are found to be hosting TikTok for Montana users, violators could face fines of $10,000 per day.[103] TikTok has stated that it would need to collect data from users in order to comply with the bill.[104] In July 2020, Wells Fargo banned the app from company devices due to privacy and security concerns.[105] In August 2023, New York City banned TikTok on government-owned devices for security reasons.[106] A July 2020 poll from Morning Consult, with 2,200 surveyed, found that 29% of American adults supported a TikTok ban, 33% opposed one, and 38% had no opinion.[107] An August 2020 poll from Reuters/Ipsos, surveying 1,349, had 40% supporting Trump's move to ban the app, 30% opposed, and 30% uncertain.[108] A December 2022 poll from Rasmussen Reports, surveying 1,000 likely U.S. voters, found that 68% supported proposals to federally ban TikTok, with 43% strongly supporting a ban. Conversely, 24% surveyed were opposed, including 12% who strongly opposed.[109] A March 2023 poll from The Washington Post, surveying 1,027 American adults, found that 41% supported the federal government banning TikTok, while 25% remain opposed to a ban.[110] Another March poll, from Pew Research Center, found twice as many adult Americans support the U.S. government's ban on TikTok as oppose it (50% vs. 22%), though a significant portion (28%) remain unsure.[111] A December 2023 poll from Pew Research Center found 38% in favor of a ban, reflecting a decrease among Republicans even amid renewed efforts by their party leaders to ban the app.[112] A February 2024 poll by the Associated Press and NORC Center for Public Affairs Research found 31% of the respondents were in favor of a nationwide ban of TikTok, while 35% said they were opposed to it. Overall 56% said they supported a limited ban on government devices.[113] An April 2024 poll by Reuters/Ipsos found that a majority of Americans believe that TikTok is used by the Chinese government to influence public opinion.[114] TikTok began working on Project Texas after 2020 to address data concerns from the US government.[115] From 2019 to 2024, TikTok and ByteDance combined spent $27 million on lobbying in the United States, including their hire of SKDK, a public affairs firm, in 2023 according to Politico.[116][117] Reuters reported that according to its sources, if all legal methods to block the April 2024 ban are exhausted, ByteDance would prefer to shut down TikTok than sell it with its core algorithm, which is also subject to China's export control.[118] On May 7, 2024, ByteDance and TikTok filed a lawsuit in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia to overturn the Protecting Americans from Foreign Adversary Controlled Applications Act.[119][120] Some advertisers increased their spending on TikTok in 2023. Edward East, CEO of marketing agency Billion Dollar Boy, stated that instead of being intimidated by a potential ban, the industry is seeing an increase in brand investment through TikTok.[121] In May 2024, trade association NetChoice removed TikTok as a member after facing pressures and potential investigations by US lawmakers. NetChoice had previously defended TikTok.[122] Following the passing of the Protecting Americans from Foreign Adversary Controlled Applications Act, eight TikTok content creators sued the United States government on May 14, 2024, in United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit in an effort to overturn the act; the choice of venue was due to a provision in the act making it the \"exclusive jurisdiction\" for legal challenges of the act.[123] In March 2024, a spokesperson for Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the People's Republic of China said the Protecting Americans from Foreign Adversary Controlled Applications Act was putting the U.S. on \"the opposite side of the principle of fair competition and international economic and trade rules.\"[124] Representatives from the Embassy of China in Washington, D.C. met with U.S. congressional staffers to lobby against the bill.[125] The Central Propaganda Department of the Chinese Communist Party also instructed the country's state media outlets to increase positive coverage of ByteDance, although overall Beijing's response seems to be muted so far.[126] Bans and attempted bans in the United States have drawn objections citing hypocrisy, protectionism, and not addressing user data privacy in general. Lawmakers making allegations against TikTok fail to mention that the United States itself surveils non-US nationals under Section 702 of FISA.[127] The types of data collected by TikTok are also collected by other social media platforms and sold through brokers to private buyers and reportedly government agencies as well, without oversight.[127][128] A researcher at Georgia Tech's Internet Governance Project is concerned that Washington's attempt to protect the US market could backfire.[127] Some researchers from the Citizen Lab and the Center for Strategic and International Studies stated that user information in general should be protected, not just focusing on one platform.[128][129] There has been no public evidence of American TikTok user data being accessed by the Chinese government.[130][131][132] Critics have also labeled a potential ban on the app an assault on freedom of speech, including congressmen Rand Paul and Thomas Massie.[133][134]",

                "title": "TikTok Ban Heads to the Supreme Court. Here’s What to Know. - The New York Times",
                "content": "Advertisement Supported by TikTok made its case to the Supreme Court on Friday after losing a challenge to a federal law that could ban the short-form video app. By Sapna Maheshwari and Amanda Holpuch TikTok made its case before the Supreme Court on Friday, challenging a law that seeks to ban the short-form video app in the United States. Concerns that the Chinese government could manipulate content and gain access to sensitive user data through the app, which is owned by the Chinese company ByteDance, prompted Congress to pass legislation that would ban the social media platform unless it was sold to a government-approved buyer. President Biden signed the legislation into law in April, giving ByteDance until Jan. 19 to divest from TikTok. The company lost its first legal effort to overturn the law on Dec. 6 when a panel of three federal judges unanimously rejected TikTok’s argument that the law violated the First Amendment. There is a chance that President-elect Donald J. Trump will try to rescue the app, which boasts 170 million users in the United States, but the law is scheduled to go into effect the day before his inauguration. Here’s why the pressure has been ratcheted up on TikTok and what it means for users. Lawmakers and regulators in the West have increasingly expressed concern that TikTok and its parent company, ByteDance, may put sensitive user data, like location information, into the hands of the Chinese government. They have pointed to laws that allow the Chinese government to secretly demand data from Chinese companies and citizens for intelligence-gathering operations. They are also worried that China could use TikTok’s content recommendations to fuel misinformation, a concern that escalated in the United States after the start of the Israeli-Hamas war and during the presidential election. Critics say TikTok has fueled the spread of antisemitism. We are having trouble retrieving the article content. Please enable JavaScript in your browser settings.
