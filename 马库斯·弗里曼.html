                <p class="article-content">The article highlights Notre Dame's historic achievement in advancing to the College Football Playoff National Championship under head coach Marcus Freeman. The Fighting Irish secured their spot with a narrow 27-24 victory over Penn State in the 2025 Orange Bowl semifinal. This marks the first time since 2012 that Notre Dame will compete for a national title, and they are the first team in college football history to win two bowl games in a single postseason.

Freeman is breaking barriers as he becomes the first Black coach and the first coach of Asian descent to lead a team into a Division I college football national title game. He emphasized the importance of team success over personal accolades, expressing hope that his achievement would inspire coaches of all backgrounds to pursue leadership roles.

Freeman has an impressive record of 34-9 in his three seasons at Notre Dame, including a remarkable nine consecutive wins against ranked opponents and a perfect 3-0 record in College Football Playoff games. His counterpart in the Orange Bowl, Penn State's James Franklin, also noted the significance of having Black coaches reach such prominent positions, drawing parallels to the impact of the first Super Bowl featuring Black head coaches.

As the anticipation builds for the national championship game on January 20 in Atlanta, the focus remains on the teams and their journeys to this pivotal moment in college football history.</p>

                <p class="article-content">**Notre Dame to Compete for National Championship for First Time Since 2013**

Notre Dame's thrilling 27-24 victory over Penn State has secured the Fighting Irish their first trip to the national championship game since 2013, when they faced Alabama and lost 42-14. This win marks Notre Dame's most significant achievement since their 1988 national championship triumph against West Virginia.

Under the leadership of head coach Marcus Freeman, Notre Dame has been on an impressive run, remaining undefeated since September and winning 13 consecutive games. The semifinal match against Penn State was their closest contest since a narrow 31-24 victory over Louisville on September 28. Following that game, the Irish dominated their opponents, winning by at least 10 points in every match, solidifying their status as a powerhouse and the surprise team of the season.

Today is particularly special for Freeman, who is not only celebrating his team's historic accomplishment but also his 39th birthday. Freeman, who began his tenure at Notre Dame as the defensive coordinator, took over as head coach after Brian Kelly's departure to LSU. He made his head coaching debut at age 36 during the 2021 Fiesta Bowl, which ended in a loss for Notre Dame. The following season saw Freeman start with two additional losses, making him the first head coach in Notre Dame history to begin his career 0-3. However, he has since turned the program around spectacularly, achieving 33 wins against just six losses. His impressive resume now includes five consecutive bowl game victories, with three of those coming in this season's playoffs against Indiana, Georgia, and Penn State.

This latest victory is undoubtedly the highlight of Freeman's young career, surpassing last week's triumph over Georgia. He also made history as the first Black head coach to lead a team to a national championship. When asked by ESPN about this milestone, Freeman humbly redirected the focus to his team, stating, "I don't want to take any attention away from the team. It's an honor, and I hope all coaches—minorities, Black, Asian, white—get the opportunity to lead young men like this."

Freeman's passion, dedication, and commitment to his players and the university are evident, qualities that a powerhouse like Notre Dame needs. Known for producing NFL talent, the Fighting Irish began the season with 52 active players in the league, ranking sixth among all schools.

As for the upcoming national championship, it is anticipated that the winner of the other semifinal between Ohio State and Texas will likely be favored. However, Freeman has demonstrated that he is unfazed by the underdog status. His ability to make crucial adjustments was evident in the semifinal win over Penn State, where his halftime changes turned the game around after trailing 10-3 at the half and 24-17 in the fourth quarter. A pivotal moment came in the final 30 seconds when Drew Allar's interception allowed Notre Dame to set up a game-winning field goal, sealing their spot in the national championship.

Freeman's remarkable tenure at Notre Dame has not gone unnoticed by NFL teams. If he leads the Irish to a national championship, he could be a prime candidate for an NFL head coaching position as early as next season, with six teams—Jets, Patriots, Raiders, Jaguars, Saints, and Bears—currently seeking a head coach. Freeman's age and proven leadership make him an attractive option.

For now, Freeman can enjoy his birthday and focus on preparing his team for the biggest game of the year, the National Championship, set to take place on January 20 at Mercedes-Benz Stadium, home of the Atlanta Falcons.</p>
