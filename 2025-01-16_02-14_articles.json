NOTE: Local area indexes are byproducts of the national CPI program. Each local index has a smaller sample size than the national index and is, therefore, subject to substantially more sampling and other measurement error. As a result, local area indexes show greater volatility than the national index, although their long-term trends are similar. Therefore, the Bureau of Labor Statistics strongly urges users to consider adopting the national average CPI for use in their escalator clauses.

Since the expenditure data required for the calculation of the C-CPI-U are available only with a time lag, the C-CPI-U is issued first in preliminary form using the latest available expenditure data at that time and is subject to four revisions. Indexes are issued as initial estimates. Indexes are revised each quarter with the publication of January, April, July, and October data as updated expenditure estimates become available. The C-CPI-U indexes are updated quarterly until they become final. January-March indexes are final in January of the following year; April-June indexes are final in April of the following year; July-September indexes are final in July of the following year; October-December indexes are final in October of the following year.

'effect' of an item category is a measure of that item's contribution to the All items price change. For example, if the Food index had an effect of 0.40, and the All items index rose 1.2 percent, then the increase in food prices contributed 0.40 / 1.2, or 33.3 percent, to that All items increase. Said another way, had food prices been unchanged for that month the change in the All items index would have been 1.2 percent minus 0.40, or 0.8 percent. Effects can be negative as well. For example, if the effect of food was a negative 0.1, and the All items index rose 0.5 percent, the All items index actually would have been 0.1 percent higher (or 0.6 percent) had food prices been unchanged. Since food prices fell while prices overall were rising, the contribution of food to the All items price change was negative (in this case, -0.1 / 0.5, or minus 20 percent). (2) A statistic's margin of error is often expressed as its point estimate plus or minus two standard errors. For example, if a CPI category rose 0.6 percent, and its standard error was 0.15 percent, the margin of error on this item's 1-month percent change would be 0.6 percent, plus or minus 0.3 percent. (3) If the current seasonally adjusted 1-month percent change is greater than the previous published 1-month percent change, then this column identifies the closest prior month with a 1-month percent change as (L)arge as or (L)arger than the current 1-month change. If the current 1-month percent change is smaller than the previous published 1-month percent change, the most recent month with a change as (S)mall or (S)maller than the current month change is identified. If the current and previous published 1-month percent changes are equal, a dash will appear. Standard numerical comparisons are used. For example, 0.8% is greater than 0.6%, -0.4% is less than -0.2%, and -0.2% is less than 0.0%. Note that a (L)arger change can be a smaller decline, for example, a -0.2% change is larger than a -0.4% change, but still represents a decline in the price index. Likewise, (S)maller changes can be increases, for example, a 0.6% change is smaller than 0.8%, but still represents an increase in the price index. In this context, a -0.2% change is considered to be smaller than a 0.0% change. (4) Not seasonally adjusted. (5) Indexes on a December 1997=100 base.

                "content": "Erythrosine, also known as Red No. 3, is an organoiodine compound, specifically a derivative of fluorone. It is a pink dye which is primarily used for food coloring.[2] It is the disodium salt of 2,4,5,7-tetraiodofluorescein. Its maximum absorbance is at 530 nm[3] in an aqueous solution, and it is subject to photodegradation. It is used as a food coloring,[4] printing ink,[5] biological stain,[6] dental plaque disclosing agent,[7] radiopaque medium,[6] sensitizer for orthochromatic photographic films, and visible light photoredox catalyst.[8] Erythrosine is commonly used in sweets such as some candies and ice pops, and even more widely used in cake-decorating gels. It was also used to color pistachio shells.[9] As a food additive, it has the E number E127. A 1990 study concluded that \"chronic erythrosine ingestion may promote thyroid tumor formation in rats via chronic stimulation of the thyroid by TSH.\" with 4% of total daily dietary intake consisting of erythrosine B.[10] A series of toxicology tests combined with a review of other reported studies concluded that erythrosine is non-genotoxic and any increase in tumors is caused by a non-genotoxic mechanism.[11] Erythrosine is restricted as a food additive in the European Union, China, United States, and the United Kingdom.[12] Its usage is limited in Australia, and New Zealand.[13] The European Food Safety Authority only allows erythrosine in processed cherries[14] and pet foods.[15][16] Erythrosine can be used in some colored foods and ingested drugs in the United States.[17] However, its use in cosmetics, topical drugs, some foods, and in all uses as its lake variant have been banned since 1990,[18] and it will be banned in food beginning on January 15, 2027, and in ingested drugs beginning January 18, 2028.[19][20] It is less commonly used in the United States because Allura Red AC (Red #40) is generally used instead.[21] As a result of efforts begun in the 1970s, in 1990, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) instituted a partial ban on erythrosine, citing research that high doses cause cancer in rats. That ban applied to many topical drugs, cosmetics, and some foods.[18] In June 2008, the Center for Science in the Public Interest (CSPI) petitioned the FDA for a complete ban on erythrosine in the United States,[22] but the FDA did not take any immediate further action. As of May 2023, the U.S. state of New York is considering banning the use of Red Dye No. 3 in foods (it was already banned from cosmetics as of 1990) because it has been shown to cause cancer in animals and because of claims that it, and other synthetic food dyes, may contribute to child behavioral problems such as hyperactivity.[23] California plans to ban the manufacture, sale, and distribution of foods containing Red Dye No. 3 starting in 2027, following a bill signed into law in October 2023 that also bans three other food additives: propylparaben, potassium bromate, and brominated vegetable oil.[24][25][26] In December 2024, the FDA was nearing a decision on whether to ban Red No. 3.[27] According to Jim Jones, the FDA's deputy commissioner for human foods, an announcement was expected within the next few weeks.[28] In January 2025, the FDA announced a ban of Red No. 3, due to the evidence of its carcinogenicity. It gave food manufacturers until January 15, 2027, to reformulate products, with an additional year given to companies that manufacture ingested drugs like dietary supplements.[19] Erythrosine B; Erythrosin B; Acid Red 51; C.I. 45430; FD&C Red No. 3; E127; 2',4',5',7'-Tetraiodo-3',6'-dihydroxy-spiro[3H-isobenzofuran-1,9'-xanthen]-3-one disodium salt; Tetraiodofluorescein sodium salt; Calcoid Erythrosine N; 2,4,5,7-Tetraiodo-3,6-dihydroxyxanthene-9-spiro-1'-3H-isobenzofuran-3'-one disodium salt; 2',4',5',7'-Tetraiodofluorescein, disodium salt; C.I.

On Oct. 1, 2024, the FDA began implementing a reorganization impacting many parts of the agency. We are in the process of updating FDA.gov content to reflect these changes. FD&C Red No. 3, also referred to as Red Dye No. 3, Red Dye 3, and erythrosine, is a synthetic food dye that gives certain foods and drinks a bright, cherry-red color, and is found in certain candy, cakes and cupcakes, cookies, frozen desserts, and frostings and icings, and ingested drugs. Like other color additives, its uses must be approved by the FDA, and it is used in small amounts. The FDA requires manufacturers to list FD&C Red No. 3 in the statement of ingredients when added to food. The FDA will no longer allow for the use of FD&C Red No. 3 in food and ingested drugs. On January 15, 2025, the FDA issued an order to revoke these authorizations. Manufacturers who use FD&C Red No. 3 in food and ingested drugs will have until January 15, 2027 or January 18, 2028, respectively, to reformulate their products. Consumers could see FD&C Red No. 3 as an ingredient in a food or drug product on the market past the effective date in the order if that product was manufactured before the effective date. The FDA is revoking the authorization for the use of FD&C Red No. 3 based on the Delaney Clause of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FD&C Act). The Delaney Clause, enacted in 1960 as part of the Color Additives Amendment to the FD&C Act, prohibits FDA authorization of a food additive or color additive if it has been found to induce cancer in humans or animals. The FDA determined that the data presented in a 2022 color additive petition show that this ingredient causes cancer in male laboratory rats exposed to high levels of FD&C Red No. 3 because of a hormonal mechanism that occurs in male rats. Studies in other animals or in humans did not show the same effect and there is no evidence showing FD&C Red No. 3 causes cancer in humans. Under the FD&C Act (Chapter VII, section 721), color additives, including FD&C Red No. 3 are subject to FDA approval before they may be used in food, drugs, or cosmetics, or in medical devices that come into direct contact with the bodies of people or animals for a significant period of time. Color additives, including FD&C Red No. 3, require pre-market review and approval by the FDA. The law requires evidence that a color additive is safe under its intended conditions of use before it may be added to foods. Learn more about how we regulate color additives in the food supply. In the case of color additives, manufacturers submit data and information to the FDA as a petition requesting approval of the intended use. The FDA evaluates the petition, and other existing data and information, and if the data available demonstrates that the substance is safe under the proposed conditions of use, the agency issues a regulation authorizing the use of the color additive. When evaluating the safety of a new color additive or a new use for a listed color additive, the FDA considers factors, including likely amount of consumption, intended use, the manufacturing process, and its physical and chemical properties, among others. When the FDA approves the use of a color additive, the regulations specify the products in which it can be used, any maximum amounts allowed to be used, its identity and specifications, and whether it must be certified by the FDA. In cases where data demonstrates that a color additive intended for ingestion can induce cancer in human or animal based on appropriate tests, the Delaney Clause directs the FDA to find such uses of the color additive unsafe. Under the FDA’s food labeling regulations, certified colors must be declared in the statement of ingredients on food labels by “FD&C Red No. 3” or without the “FD&C” prefix or the term “No.”– “FD&C Red 3” or “Red 3”. Other countries allow the use of FD&C Red No. 3 under a different name, such as in Canada and Europe under the name erythrosine. Past Regulatory Actions on FD&C Red No. 3 In 1969, FD&C Red No. 3 had already been in use in foods and ingested drugs and these uses were permanently listed under the FDA’s color additive regulations. In 1990, the FDA responded to a petition requesting that the FDA permanently authorize the use of FD&C Red No. 3 in cosmetics and topical drugs. Before that time, the use of FD&C Red No. 3 in cosmetics and topical drugs was provisionally listed. As part of the process to request authorization, the petitioner needed to provide data that supported the safe use of the color additive. Due to the existence of data demonstrating that the use of FD&C Red No. 3 caused cancer in rats, the FDA denied the petition based on the Delaney Clause. In 1992, the FDA announced its intention to revoke the permanent listings for the uses of FD&C Red No. 3 in food and ingested drugs (57 FR 16702) based on the Delaney Clause due to effects observed in male rats. The agency decided not to take action at that time, given the resources required to remove this authorization. However, available data does not raise safety concerns for humans. The FDA is committed to continuing its evaluation of all relevant scientific information and data when considering if changes that could impact the food supply are warranted. The food industry is responsible for ensuring the food it markets is safe and meets all applicable FDA requirements. FDA scientists continue to review available information about the safety and toxicology of color additives to determine whether the use continues to be safe under the FD&C Act. 01/15/2025",

The same California legislation that bans this dye also targets: Potassium bromate – a flour additive that’s linked to cancer. Brominated vegetable oil – which prevents separation of juice elements in citrus drinks, which may cause behavioral or reproductive issues. Propylparaben – a preservative that is connected to arthritic inflammation, reproductive issues and breast cancer. But Dr. Wong says these are just the “tip of the iceberg” when it comes to identifying and removing unhealthy additives in food. “Rates of almost all cancers are higher today than they were 30 years ago. I believe the addition of chemicals as preservatives and coloring in foods is a primary reason,” he says. “Most processed foods are composed of more artificial flavoring and chemicals than natural ingredients.

Also, make sure fresher and affordable options are more readily available,” he says. But beware, not all foods labeled “healthy” or “natural” live up to their name. Though federal law mandates ingredients used in a food product must be listed on the label, many listed ingredients can be misleading and some described as natural are, in fact, unhealthy. “We need more clarity on ingredient labelling so we can learn how to eat and live more healthfully.” “Taste the rainbow” is a good idea when it comes to filling our plate with fruits and vegetables, but not so much when it comes to artificial food dyes.

                "title": "FDA says it causes cancer. Yet it’s in hundreds of candies. | Center for Science in the Public Interest",
                "content": "Updated: October 25, 2022 Scientists urge FDA to ban Red 3—already illegal in cosmetics—from foods, ingested drugs, and supplements It’s illegal to use the carcinogenic color additive Red 3 in cosmetics, such as lipsticks or blush, or externally applied drugs. Yet the discredited chemical is lurking in common varieties of candy corn, Nerds, Peeps, Pez, SweeTarts, and hundreds of candies, cakes, and other foods, including dozens of seasonal Halloween items. That’s why the Center for Science in the Public Interest and 23 other organizations and prominent scientists are today urging the Food and Drug Administration to formally remove Red 3 from the list of approved color additives in foods, dietary supplements, and oral medicines. Since the early 1980s FDA had evidence that Red 3 caused cancer in laboratory animals. The National Toxicology Program considered the evidence “convincing.” As a result, in 1990, the agency eliminated certain “provisionally listed” uses of the chemical—meaning cosmetics and externally applied drugs. In 1990, FDA also said it would “take steps” to ban its use in foods, ingested drugs, and supplements. But those steps were never taken. “Halloween has never been the healthiest holiday, but few parents would believe that the FDA permits the use of a dye it acknowledges as a carcinogen to be used as a common ingredient in candy,” said CSPI consultant Lisa Y. Lefferts. “Fewer still would believe that the FDA prohibits this carcinogen in makeup but allows it in food.” Despite the fact that the government concluded that Red 3 causes cancer, food companies continue to use it widely. A search of Food Scores, a database maintained by the Environmental Working Group, generated 2,876 brand-name food products that contain Red 3—including hundreds of foods made by the country’s biggest food companies. Candy company Brach’s alone sells more than 100 different candies with the dye. Besides showing up in Pez and Peeps, Red 3 is used in some varieties of Betty Crocker’s Fruit by the Foot, Dubble Bubble chewing gum, Entenmann’s Little Bites, and Hostess’ Ding Dongs. Albertson’s, Kroger, Meijer’s, Target, and Walmart all use Red 3 in some of their house-brand products. And even some non-candy foods that one would think wouldn’t need artificial color contain Red 3, such as Betty Crocker’s Loaded Mashed Potatoes. And sometimes Red 3 can act to simulate the presence of a desirable ingredient: While Vigo Saffron Yellow Rice does indeed have some famously expensive saffron, it gets at least some of its color from Red 3. Even PediaSure Grow & Gain Kids’ Ready-to-Drink strawberry shake contains Red 3—but no strawberries. Long term animal feeding studies show that Red 3 causes adenomas and carcinomas of the thyroid gland. When a substance is shown to cause cancer in animals, it is presumed to cause cancer in humans. Amendments to the nation’s food laws passed in 1958 and 1960 included a provision called the Delaney Clause which prohibits the approval of any food and color additive if it is shown to cause cancer in people or animals. For that reason, the petition filed today by CSPI and other groups and scientists says that the FDA is statutorily obligated to delist Red 3. “It's outrageous that the Food and Drug Administration has known since the 1980s that Red 3 has the potential to cause cancer, but still allows it to be used in the food we eat,” said Melanie Benesh, vice president of government affairs at EWG, which is one of the groups petitioning FDA today. “This is yet another glaring example of how the FDA has failed consumers when it comes to food safety.” If the data were strong enough to ban Red 3 in cosmetics and external drugs 30 years ago, they’re surely strong enough to ban it today in foods, oral drugs, and dietary supplements, –CSPI president Dr. Peter Lurie. CSPI’s advice to parents is to avoid not just Red 3, but all numbered dyes, such as Yellow 5 and Red 40. Besides the risk of cancer posed by Red 3, concerns have mounted about the adverse impacts on children’s behavior. In 2008, CSPI petitioned the FDA to remove those from the food supply as well. Since then, California’s Office of Environmental Health Hazard Assessment has confirmed those dyes cause neurobehavioral problems in some children. Despite the risks, some prescription drugs still contain Red 3. Vyvanse, billed as the “#1 prescribed branded ADHD medication,” contains it. That’s somewhat ironic, according to CSPI, since the behavioral problems associated with food dyes are often described as similar to the symptoms associated with ADHD. “FDA has had more than 30 years to ban carcinogenic Red 3​—an artificial food color used in many products, including the candy people will be giving out this Halloween,” said Tom Neltner of the Environmental Defense Funds. “Is the agency red in the face? Not at all. With this color additive petition, we are ​formally demanding that the agency do its job. The law gives the agency 180 days to make a final decision. Let’s hope that when kids go trick-or-treating next year, FDA will have done its part to make the holiday safer for all.” Besides CSPI, EDF, EWG, and Lefferts, the petition was submitted by Breast Cancer Prevention Partners, Center for Environmental Health, Center for Food Safety, Chef Ann Foundation, Children’s Advocacy Institute, Consumer Federation of America, Consumer Reports, Defend our Health, Feingold Association, Food & Water Watch, Healthy Babies Bright Futures, Life Time Foundation, Moms Rising, Prevention Institute, Public Citizen, Public Health Institute, Public Interest Research Group, and Real Food for Kids. Individual scientists signing the petition include Linda S. Birnbaum, former head of both the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences and the National Toxicology Program; and pediatrician and epidemiologist Philip J. Landrigan of Boston College, who directs both the Program for Global Public Health and the Common Good and the Global Observatory on Planetary Health. The food and drug industries used more than 200,000 pounds of Red 3 in 2021 alone. “The primary purpose of food dyes is generally to make junk food look more attractive, especially to kids, or to trick their parents into thinking a food contains a healthy fruit like strawberries,” said Lurie. “When the purpose is purely cosmetic, why is any level of risk acceptable?” Tags Topics Donate to CSPI More on food & health Stay in the know Stay informed Get the latest news on nutrition, food safety, and health.

                "title": "Is Red Dye No. 3 in Food Bad for You? A Dietician's Take",
                "content": "From juice to jelly beans and baby food to baking decorations, synthetic food dyes are ubiquitous. How enticing would some foods appear, after all, without the vivid colors provided by dyes? But many dyes pose health risks. Perhaps none has aroused such concern as red dye 3, which the FDA banned in cosmetics more than 30 years ago because research showed high doses could cause cancer in lab animals. Despite pressure from public interest groups, the agency has never extended the ban to the dye's use in food. But the pressure only figures to increase. Several countries — including the European Union, United Kingdom Australia, China, Japan, New Zealand and the United Kingdom — have all banned red dye 3 in foods. In October 2023, California became the first U.S. state to ban its use in food, superseding the FDA's current rule that allows small amounts in foods as a color additive. A number of U.S. states have introduced legislation to follow suit. It all begs the question: If we can't put red dye 3 on our skin, but it's still allowed in foods and ingestible medicine, what impact might it be having on our health? \"Fear is a very powerful motivator for attracting views and reads, so many influencers will pick out ingredients in products for shock and fear to draw us in,\" says Amanda Beaver, a wellness dietician at Houston Methodist. \"Sometimes these are warranted, but many times they are not.\" \"Dyes do serve a fun function as they make foods and desserts look fun and tasty,\" adds Beaver. \"However, there is convincing evidence for the removal of red dye 3 from our food supply based on our laws.\" Red dye 3, also known as erythrosine, is a synthetic dye made from petroleum that gives popular food and drinks a bright red cherry color. It was first approved more than a century ago in 1907 when little research had been conducted on the coloring agent. For context, this occurred decades before we knew that smoking causes cancer, back in the days when cigarettes were \"physician-approved.\" In response to several color additives causing \"serious adverse effects,\" according to the FDA, the agency re-evaluated their approval process with the Color Additive Amendments of 1960, which listed red dye 3 along with 200 other color additives as provisionally approved, meaning they could still be used temporarily until scientific data established unconditionally that they were safe enough to consume or potentially harmful until to ban. In 1969, red dye 3 was unconditionally approved for food and ingestible medication. But in 1990, the FDA banned its use in cosmetics based on lab animal research that invoked the Delaney Clause — a provision that requires the FDA to ban food additives found to cause or induce cancer in humans or animals as indicated by testing. However, despite the FDA's claim it would work to ban red dye 3 in food and drugs, it did not. \"Studies now show that red dye 3 is associated with hyperactivity in children and that high doses can cause thyroid cancer in male rats,\" says Beaver. \"There have not been studies showing that it causes thyroid cancer in humans, but the FDA now lists red dye 3 as an animal carcinogen.\" \"Because the Delaney Clause states food additives must not cause cancer in humans or animals, many consumer advocacy groups say that red dye 3 should be banned,\" says Beaver. (Related: Is Your Thyroid Trying to Tell You Something?) The best way to know if a product contains red dye 3 is to read the nutrition label. Law requires the dye be listed there. \"Many people are aware that red dye 3 and other dyes are in candies which give them their bright flashy colors, but many people are not aware that it can also be found in savory foods,\" says Beaver. \"You can be confident the food does not have one of these dyes by checking the ingredients label.\" Food manufacturers are required by law to disclose the ingredients found in packaged foods. Red dye 3 will be listed as either red dye 3 (or FD&C Red Dye No. 3) or erythrosine. According to Beaver, foods that may contain red dye 3 include: (Related: How Ultra-Processed Foods Harm Your Health) Any food additive, including synthetic dyes, is required by the FDA to have pre-market approval before it can be added to foods. However, that hasn't stopped other current FDA-approved dyes from being subject to scrutiny — merited or not — from the public over health concerns. Those dyes include: Two of those, red 40 and yellow 5, stand out as being linked to hyperactivity in children. According to Beaver, if you're concerned about your intake of red dye 3, rather than focusing on avoiding certain ingredients, it's more sustainable to focus on your overall eating pattern. \"I don't recommend that my patients routinely check the ingredient list unless they have food allergies, food sensitivities or gastrointestinal issues,\" says Beaver. \"Instead, I have them focus on adding nutritious foods to their diet or making healthier swaps that they enjoy.\" \"A nutritious diet will be low in dyes regardless. I don't think it is reasonable to avoid all dyes in foods as they are found in so many celebration foods.\" With respect to red dye 3, here are some nutritious swaps that Beaver recommends: In addition to California banning red dye 3, many household food brands have moved away or are moving away from the use of such synthetic dyes. The trend is toward naturally derived colors, such as: \"People can make the personal choice to include these in their diet once in a while,\" says Beaver. \"By eating a diet with a foundation rooted in veggies, fruits, proteins, nuts, legumes and grains, people don't have to worry so much about having a colorful candy once in a while.\" \"The good thing is that brands may start removing this dye from their products due to the ban in California.\" (Related: 5 Nutrition Misconceptions Debunked by a Dietitian) With your support, Houston Methodist provides exceptional research, education and care that is truly leading medicine.",

                "content": "Cori Dionne \"Coco\" Gauff (/ˈɡɔːf/ GAWF; born March 13, 2004) is an American professional tennis player. Gauff has career-high WTA rankings of world No. 2 in singles and of world No. 1 in doubles. She has won nine WTA Tour singles titles, including the 2023 US Open and 2024 WTA Finals, and nine doubles titles, including the 2024 French Open. Gauff made her WTA Tour debut in March 2019 at the Miami Open at the age of 15. She received a wildcard into the qualifying draw at the 2019 Wimbledon Championships, where she became the youngest player in the tournament's history to qualify for the main draw. There, she won over Venus Williams and reached the fourth round. Gauff won her first WTA Tour singles title at the 2019 Linz Open. She reached her first major final in women's doubles at the 2021 US Open and reached her first Grand Slam singles final at the 2022 French Open. In 2023, Gauff won her first WTA 1000 title at the Cincinnati Open and her first Major singles title at the US Open. Gauff was born in Atlanta, Georgia[3] on March 13, 2004, to Candi (née Odom)[4] and Corey Gauff, both from Delray Beach, Florida.[5][6] She has two younger brothers.[7] Her father played college basketball at Georgia State University and later worked as a health care executive. Her mother was a track and field athlete at Florida State University and worked as an educator.[8] Gauff lived her early years in Atlanta.[9] She began playing tennis at the age of six. When she was seven, her family moved back to Delray Beach to have better training opportunities.[10][11] She worked with Gerard Loglo at the New Generation Tennis Academy starting from the age of eight.[12][13] Gauff recalled, \"I wasn't much of a team person. I loved tennis. I was so-so about it in the beginning because when I was younger I didn't want to practice at all. I just wanted to play with my friends. When I turned eight, that was when I played 'Little Mo' and after that I decided to do that for the rest of my life.\"[12][14] Gauff's parents gave up their careers to focus on training their daughter. Her father later became her primary coach, while her mother oversaw her homeschooling. Her father had limited experience playing tennis growing up.[8][12] At the age of 10, Gauff began to train at the Mouratoglou Tennis Academy in France run by Patrick Mouratoglou, longtime coach of Serena Williams. Mouratoglou commented, \"I'll always remember the first time I saw Coco. She came over to the Mouratoglou Academy in 2014 to try out and she impressed me with her determination, athleticism and fighting spirit.... When she looks at you and tells you she will be number one, you can only believe it.\"[15] He helped sponsor Gauff through his Champ'Seed foundation, which he created to provide funding for talented juniors who did not have the financial resources to afford high-level training.[16] Gauff won the USTA Clay Court National 12-and-under title at the age of 10 years and three months to become the youngest champion in the tournament's history.[12] Gauff is a former world No. 1 junior.[17] She entered the prestigious Les Petits As 14-and-under tournament in 2016 at age 12 and made it to the semifinals.[18] Gauff began playing on the ITF Junior Circuit at the age of 13, skipping directly to the highest-level Grade A and Grade 1 tournaments. She finished runner-up to Jaimee Fourlis in her third career event, the Grade 1 Prince George's County Junior Tennis Championships in Maryland.[19] At her next event, Gauff made her junior Grand Slam debut at the 2017 US Open and finished runner-up to Amanda Anisimova.[20] Gauff did not drop a set before the final in either tournament. She became the youngest girls' singles finalist in US Open history.[21] After beginning 2018 with a semifinal at the Grade 1 Traralgon Junior International in Australia, Gauff lost her opening round match at the Australian Open.[17] She did not enter another tournament in singles until the French, where she won her first career junior Grand Slam tournament title at the 2018 French Open.[22] She did not drop a set until the final, where she came from behind to defeat McNally in three sets. With the title, Gauff became the fifth youngest girls' singles champion in French Open history.[23] A month later, following another final win against McNally at the Grade 1 Junior International Roehampton, she became the No. 1 junior in the world.[24][25] Gauff reached the quarterfinals in singles at the final two Grand Slam tournaments of the year. She fared better in doubles at both tournaments, reaching the semifinals at Wimbledon with partner María Lourdes Carlé and winning her first junior Grand Slam doubles title at the 2018 US Open with McNally.[17] Gauff and McNally defeated compatriots Hailey Baptiste and Dalayna Hewitt in the final, all in straight sets.[26] In September 2018, Gauff represented the United States at the Junior Fed Cup with Alexa Noel and Connie Ma. The team reached the final against Ukraine. After Gauff won her singles rubber and Noel lost hers, Gauff and Noel won the Junior Fed Cup by defeating Lyubov Kostenko and Dasha Lopatetskaya 11–9 in a match tiebreak.[27] Gauff finished the year with another Grade A title in singles at the Orange Bowl.[28] She ended the season ranked world No. 2 behind Clara Burel.[29] Gauff made her debut on the ITF Women's Circuit in May 2018 at the age of 14 as a qualifier in the $25k event at Osprey, where she won her first professional match.[30] She received a wild card into qualifying at the US Open, but lost her opening match five months after turning 14 years old.[31][32] In her first 2019 tournament, she finished runner-up in doubles at the $100k Midland Tennis Classic alongside Ann Li.[33] Two weeks later, Gauff played her next event at the $25k level in Surprise and reached the finals in both singles and doubles. She finished runner-up in singles and won her first WTA Tour title in doubles alongside Paige Hourigan.[34] In March, at the Miami Open, she recorded her first WTA Tour match win against Caty McNally.[35] Gauff lost the second round of qualifying at the French Open. At Wimbledon, she defeated Aliona Bolsova and Greet Minnen. Gauff became the youngest player to reach the main draw at Wimbledon by qualifying in the Open Era at the age of 15 years and three months.[36] In her main-draw debut, she upset five-time Wimbledon champion Venus Williams in straight sets.[37] Gauff won over Magdaléna Rybáriková and No. 60 Polona Hercog, saving two match points against Hercog. The hype surrounding Gauff's first-round match win led to her third rounder moving to Centre Court.[38][39] She was eliminated with a fourth-round loss to eventual champion Simona Halep.[40] All four of Gauff's matches were most-watched matches on ESPN on their respective days during the first week of coverage.[41] With this performance, she rose to world No. 141.[42] Gauff played in one US Open Series tournament at the Washington Open, where she qualified for the main draw but lost in the first round.[43] She entered the doubles event with McNally and defeated Fanny Stollár and Maria Sanchez in the final for their first career WTA title in their first joint WTA.[44] At the US Open, Gauff wild-carded into the singles and doubles main draws. She continued her Grand Slam success in singles with two three-set wins over Anastasia Potapova and Tímea Babos, both on Louis Armstrong.[45][46] She was defeated in the third round by world No. 1 and defending champion Naomi Osaka.[47] In doubles, Gauff and McNally won two matches, including an upset over ninth seeds Nicole Melichar and Květa Peschke.[48] They lost in the third round to eventual runners-up Ashleigh Barty and Victoria Azarenka.[49] Although Gauff lost in qualifying at the Linz Open, she entered the main draw as a lucky loser and won the title, notably upsetting top seed Kiki Bertens in the quarterfinals for her first top-10 victory.[50] She defeated Jeļena Ostapenko in the final to become the youngest WTA player, at age 15, to win a singles title since 2004.[51] With this title as well as a semifinal in doubles with McNally, Gauff made her top-100 debuts in both the WTA singles and doubles rankings.[52] Gauff and McNally ended their year with a second WTA doubles title at the Luxembourg Open over Kaitlyn Christian and Alexa Guarachi.[53] Starting 2020 at the Auckland Open ranked No. 67 in the world, Gauff defeated Viktória Kužmová before losing to Laura Siegemund in the second round.[54] Playing doubles with McNally, Gauff reached the semifinals. At the Australian Open, Gauff defeated Venus Williams in straight sets in the first round[55] and Sorana Cîrstea in the second round, making it three straight Grand Slams where she reached the third round.[56] She defeated defending champion Osaka[57][58] in the third, becoming the youngest player to defeat a top-5 player since Jennifer Capriati beat Gabriela Sabatini at the 1991 US Open. In the fourth round, she lost to the eventual champion, Sofia Kenin. In doubles, Gauff and McNally recorded their best result in a Grand Slam championship to date, reaching the quarterfinals before falling to second seeds and eventual champions, Kristina Mladenovic and Tímea Babos.[59] Gauff beat two top-50 players at the Lexington Challenger, before losing in straight sets to world No. 49, Jennifer Brady. At the Western and Southern Open, played in New York, Gauff lost in the first round to world No. 21, Maria Sakkari. At the US Open, Gauff was defeated in the first round by Anastasija Sevastova.[60] Gauff, ranked 53, beat world No. 34, Ons Jabeur, in the first round of the Italian Open before losing to two-time Grand Slam champion Garbiñe Muguruza. At the French Open, Gauff defeated the ninth seed and world No. 13, Johanna Konta, in the first round, but went on to lose to eventual quarterfinalist Martina Trevisan in a second-round match in which Gauff hit 19 double faults. At the Ostrava Open, she qualified for the main draw and was defeated by world No. 12, Aryna Sabalenka, in the second round. Starting the year ranked No. 48, in the Abu Dhabi Open, she beat Norwegian Ulrikke Eikeri before falling in the next round to Maria Sakkari.[61] At the Australian Open, in singles, Gauff again beat Teichmann in the first round, but fell in the round of 64 to the fifth-seeded Elina Svitolina, in straight sets.[62] In doubles, she and McNally failed to Demi Schuurs and Nicole Melichar in the quarterfinals.[61] At Adelaide, she failed to second seeded Belinda Bencic.[63] In doubles, she partnered with Canadian Sharon Fichman, and they bowed out in the first round to Duan Yingying and Zheng Saisai.[63] This run brought her to a then-career-high of No. 38 in singles.[64][65] After the Dubai Championships, she reaches a career high of No. 35 in singles.[66] In the Miami Open, she played her first WTA 1000 event while seeded (as the 31st). In May, Gauff reached the first semifinal at a WTA 1000 in her career at the Italian Open due to then-No. 1, Barty, retiring with a right arm injury in their quarterfinal match.[67] As a result, she entered top 30 for the first time. She then lost to the eventual champion, Iga Świątek. Gauff won her second singles and third doubles (with McNally) titles at the Emilia-Romagna Open in Parma. She became the youngest player to win both the singles and doubles titles at an event since Maria Sharapova won both titles at the 2004 Birmingham Classic.[68] Gauff thus rose to new career-high rankings of world No. 25 in singles and No. 41 in doubles. She became the youngest American to make her top 25 debut in nearly 23 years (since Serena Williams, June 8, 1998).[69] Seeded 24th at the French Open (her first time being seeded at a Grand Slam), she beat Aleksandra Krunić and Wang Qiang in straight sets, received a walkover when leading one set to love against 13th seed and Australian Open runner-up Jennifer Brady, and beat 25th seed Ons Jabeur in just 53 minutes to reach her first Grand Slam quarterfinal. As a result, she became the youngest female player (17 years, three months) to reach a Grand Slam quarterfinal since Nicole Vaidišová at the 2006 French Open, the youngest American to reach a quarterfinal at Roland Garros since Jennifer Capriati in 1993 and the youngest American to reach the quarterfinals of any Grand Slam since Venus Williams reached the 1997 US Open final.[70] Subsequently, Gauff was eliminated after losing in straight sets to the eventual champion, unseeded Barbora Krejčíková.[71] As a result, she reached a new career-high of No. 23. At Wimbledon, Gauff reached the fourth round for a second consecutive time defeating Elena Vesnina in straight sets in 70 minutes,[72] and Kaja Juvan in straight sets in the third round.[73][74] Gauff lost her next match to Angelique Kerber in straight sets, eliminating her from the tournament.[75] She also reached the third round in doubles with Caty McNally and as a result entered the top 40 in the doubles rankings at No. 38 on 12 July. At 17 years old, she was selected for the 2020 Summer Olympics in Tokyo, becoming the second youngest American player after Jennifer Capriati competed at 16 in 1992 and the youngest Olympic tennis player of any gender since Mario Ančić in 2000.[76] However, she tested positive for COVID-19 and was forced to withdraw.[77] At the Cincinnati Open, Gauff reached the second round and lost to second seed, and world No. 2, Naomi Osaka. At the US Open, Gauff beat Magda Linette in the first round, before falling to Sloane Stephens in the next. In the women's doubles, Gauff and McNally stormed into their first Grand Slam semifinal without dropping a set and in the finals, they lost to Sam Stosur and Zhang Shuai.[78] Seeded 18th at the Australian Open, Gauff lost in the first round against Wang Qiang in straight sets.[79] In February, Gauff reached the quarterfinals at the Qatar Open by defeating Shelby Rogers, Caroline Garcia and third seed Paula Badosa. In the quarterfinals, Gauff lost to sixth seed Maria Sakkari. In doubles, Gauff paired with Jessica Pegula to win her first WTA 1000 doubles title, beating third-seeded pair of Veronika Kudermetova and Elise Mertens in the final.[80] With the win, she climbed to a career-high No. 10 in the doubles rankings on February 28, 2022. Gauff reached her first Grand Slam singles final at the French Open, defeating Rebecca Marino, Alison Van Uytvanck, Kaia Kanepi, 31st seed Elise Mertens, Sloane Stephens, and Martina Trevisan, before losing to Iga Świątek in straight sets.[81][82] She reached the final in doubles with Jessica Pegula where they were defeated by Caroline Garcia and Kristina Mladenovic.[83][84][85] As a result, she secured a new career-high of world No. 13 in singles and the top 5 in doubles. After winning her first two matches at Wimbledon Championships as the 11th seed against unseeded Romanians Elena-Gabriela Ruse and Mihaela Buzărnescu, Gauff lost in the third round to 20th Amanda Anisimova in three sets.[86][87] As a result, she reached a new career-high ranking of world No. 11, on 11 July. Seeded sixth at the Silicon Valley Classic, she reached the quarterfinals defeating Anhelina Kalinina in the first round, and next Naomi Osaka who saved seven match points.[88] In her quarterfinal match, she struggled with her serve and lost in straight sets to Paula Badosa.[89] At the Canadian Open, she became the youngest player to reach back-to-back quarterfinals in Canada since Jennifer Capriati in 1990 and 1991. She beat sixth seed Aryna Sabalenka, a day after ousting Wimbledon champion Elena Rybakina, winning both matches in a third-set tiebreak. She lost to eventual champion Simona Halep, in straight sets.[90][91] Seeded third in doubles at the same tournament she reached the semifinals with Pegula defeating fifth seeds Desirae Krawczyk and Demi Schuurs. Next they defeated Madison Keys/Sania Mirza in the semifinals and Nicole Melichar/Ellen Perez in the final to win their second WTA 1000 title together. As a result, Gauff became the No. 1 doubles player in the world.[92] At the US Open, she reached the quarterfinals of this major for the first time with wins over 20th seed Madison Keys and Zhang Shuai becoming the youngest American woman to achieve this feat since 2009, when Melanie Oudin was 17.[93] As a result, she guaranteed herself a top 10 debut in the singles rankings at world No. 8 after the tournament.[94] Subsequently, Gauff was defeated by Caroline Garcia, in straight sets.[95] Seeded second in doubles, Gauff and partner Pegula were defeated in the first round by Leylah Fernandez and Daria Saville.[96] In October, Gauff became the youngest player in singles since Maria Sharapova in 2005 to qualify for the year-end WTA Finals championships. She and partner Jessica Pegula also both qualified for the doubles' championships. Gauff and Pegula were the first Americans since Serena and Venus Williams in 2009 to qualify for both the singles and doubles year-end championships.[97] Gauff started her 2023 season at the Auckland Open, where she defeated Rebeka Masarova in the final in straight sets. At the Australian Open, Gauff advanced to the fourth round, where she lost to Jeļena Ostapenko in straight sets.[98] At the Qatar Ladies Open, Gauff reached the quarterfinals after defeating two-time champion Petra Kvitová in the second round.[99] At the same tournament in doubles, Gauff and Jessica Pegula defended their title, defeating Lyudmyla Kichenok and Jeļena Ostapenko in a three-set match.[100] At Dubai, Gauff reached the semifinals by defeating Madison Keys in the quarterfinals, before losing to Iga Świątek.[101] At Indian Wells, Gauff lost in the quarterfinals to second seed and eventual runner-up, Aryna Sabalenka. In Miami, Gauff lost against 27th seed Anastasia Potapova in the third round. In doubles at the same tournament, Gauff won her fifth overall and third WTA 1000 team title with her partner Jessica Pegula. They became the first all-American duo to win the Miami Open doubles title in 22 years, defeating Leylah Fernandez and Taylor Townsend in the final.[102] In August, Gauff won the Washington Open title, beating Maria Sakkari in the final.[103] It was Gauff's first WTA 500 singles title, and her biggest singles title to date. She became the first teenager to win the tournament.[104] Gauff won her first WTA 1000 title at the 2023 Cincinnati Open, defeating world No. 1 Iga Świątek in the semifinals and world No. 10, Karolína Muchová, in the final.[105] In September, Gauff won the US Open, her first major singles title, beating world No. 2 Aryna Sabalenka in three sets and becoming the first American teenager to win the US Open since Serena Williams in 1999.[106] As a result, she reached world No. 3 in the rankings on 11 September 2023 and was nominated at the Laureus World Sports Awards for Breakthrough of the Year.[107][108] Gauff and Pegula returned to the world No. 1 doubles ranking on 23 October 2023, after qualifying for the 2023 WTA Finals as a pair and also individually, becoming the first players to qualify in both disciplines in back-to-back years since Sara Errani in 2012–13.[109] At the Italian Open she reached the semifinal for the second time at this tournament and second at the WTA 1000 level for the season defeating Magdalena Fręch, Jaqueline Cristian, Paula Badosa and seventh seed Zheng Qinwen.[110] With the win, she passed Caroline Wozniacki for the most WTA 1000 wins before turning 21. She lost to world No. 1 Iga Świątek, in straight sets.[111] At the same tournament, partnering Erin Routliffe, she reached a consecutive final in doubles.[112] At the 2024 French Open with new partner Katerina Siniaková, she lifted her first Grand Slam tournament doubles trophy defeating 11th seeds Sara Errani and Jasmine Paolini in the final.[113] In singles, also at Roland Garros, she reached the semifinals and was defeated by eventual champion Iga Swiatek, but despite the loss reached a new career-high ranking of world No. 2 in singles on 10 June 2024.[114] At the 2024 Wimbledon Championships, Gauff went out in the fourth round to Emma Navarro.[115] Gauff was chosen by her Olympic teammates to be the female flag-bearer for the United States at the opening ceremony of the 2024 Summer Olympics in Paris, alongside LeBron James. She became the youngest athlete to be so honored.[116][117] In singles, she lost in the third round to Donna Vekić in straight sets.[118][119] On November 9, 2024, Gauff won the 2024 WTA Finals singles champion,[120] becoming the youngest player to win the WTA Finals since Maria Sharapova in 2004[121] and the first American to win the finals since Serena Williams in 2014.[122] She beat Iga Swiatek, the No. 2 seed and defending champion of the WTA final in Riyadh.[123] She then defeated Sabalenka in the semis and Zheng Qinwen in the finals to capture her first year-end singles championship title.[124] To begin the WTA Tour, Gauff participated in the United Cup, where the United States team won gold against Poland. In the final, Gauff defeated world number 2 Iga Świątek in straight sets. Gauff was undefeated across the tournament.[125] Gauff's favorite surface is hard, and she describes her playing style as aggressive as possible with a big serve. She depends on her quickness and athleticism to keep her in any point, and describes herself as a \"fighter\".[126] From July 2023 to September 2024 her coach was Brad Gilbert.[127] Gilbert encouraged Gauff to put high, heavy topspin on her ball and to chase down balls in every corner of the court. [128] In September 2024 Gauff hired coach Matt Daly,[129] who has focused on improving her serve and forehand with a grip on her racket that is closer to the eastern backhand style rather than the more frequently used continental style. [130] Gauff uses a Head Boom MP 2022[131] with 16 main and 19 cross strings. She wears New Balance clothing and tennis shoes.[132] In October 2018, Gauff signed her first multi-year sponsorship contract, with New Balance.[133] At the 2021 French Open, Gauff wore a New Balance outfit of bold mismatched color splotches to contrast with the all-white ensemble of doubles partner Venus Williams.[134] In March 2019, Gauff announced a multi-year sponsorship agreement with Italian food company Barilla, which also sponsors Roger Federer.[133][135] In January 2023, Gauff was announced as a brand ambassador for advisory CPA firm Baker Tilly US, LLP.[136] In January 2024 at the Australian Open, Gauff debuted a new New Balance pair of shoes with geographical coordinates specially inscribed on the soles. She revealed in a post-match interview that the coordinates (26 28 0.75” N 80 5’ 1.4” W) pointed to public tennis courts in Delray Beach where she grew up and trained.[137] Gauff is a Christian. Since she was eight years old, she has prayed with her father before every match that she and her opponent would be safe. After winning the Cincinnati Open in August 2023, she said: \"… I'd like to thank my Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ. I spent a lot of nights alone, crying trying to figure it out. I still have a lot to figure out, but I thank Him for covering me.\" After winning her first Grand Slam title in September 2023, she said: \"… I don't pray for results, I just ask that I get the strength to give it my all and whatever happens happens. I'm so blessed in this life.\"[138] Gauff's tennis idols are Serena and Venus Williams. \"Serena Williams has always been my idol...and Venus,\" she has said. \"They are the reason why I wanted to pick up a tennis racquet.\"[15] Gauff first met Serena when she won the Little Mo national tournament at the age of eight, and later met her again to film a commercial for Delta Air Lines and at the Mouratoglou Academy.[12] After defeating Venus Williams at Wimbledon in 2019, Gauff expressed her respect when they shook hands at the net. \"I was just telling her thank you for everything she's done for the sport,\" Gauff said. \"She's been an inspiration for many people. I was just really telling her thank you.\"[37] Gauff stated in 2020 that she had experienced depression and stress related to her sporting career, though her parents clarified that she was not diagnosed with depression in the clinical sense, and had not sought medical attention relating to her psychological well-being.[139] Gauff is a fan of anime, including My Hero Academia.[140] In July 2023, Gauff and actress Storm Reid helped fund a new playground and purple-painted tennis courts in East Atlanta's Brownwood Park.[141]",

                "title": "New perspective fuels Coco Gauff: Embracing the uncomfortable",
                "content": "The world No. 3 says she’s had to get comfortable with being uncomfortable after hiring Matt Daly following a disappointing 2024 U.S. Open run. A new year has brought a new Coco Gauff. The American tennis superstar, who captured the 2023 U.S. Open title, has made several significant changes since her home slam title defense ended in her fourth-round exit in September. Chief among those changes: hiring coach Matt Daly. So far, the partnership appears to be paying off. Gauff rolled into this week’s Australian Open with momentum, coming off big wins at the WTA Finals in Riyadh last November and the recent United Cup, where she defeated world No. 2 Iga Swiatek. In her Melbourne opener on Monday (13 January), she overcame a few hurdles - most notably issues with her serve that resulted in nine double faults - to dismiss fellow American Sofia Kenin 6-3, 6-3. Gauff's serve remains an issue but she is attacking it head on. She even changed her grip. “I feel like, you know, I have a bit more tools to work with,” Gauff said during a press conference ahead of the Aussie Grand Slam. But Gauff’s evolution isn’t just about changes in her game, it’s also about a new perspective on competition. “I feel more comfortable now than ever,” she said. “I just realize the unimportance of winning or losing a match. As athletes, sometimes we get caught up, and losing feels like the end of the world, while winning feels like something we’re expected to do, not something to be grateful for. “No one makes us feel that way except ourselves,” she added. “I’ve just realized that it’s never ever that important. If I can step off the court and say, ‘Okay, I tried my best,’ that’s all I can ask for. Every time I go out there, I remind myself to do just that. Whether I win or lose, most matches are decided by a few points, and sometimes they’ll go my way, and sometimes they won’t.” On the court, Gauff admits she’s had to embrace discomfort as she works with Daly to develop new habits and shed old ones. “In Beijing, I won that tournament, but I felt uncomfortable on the court every match,” she said with a laugh. “I didn’t show it because I knew I wasn’t going to allow myself to get frustrated. But that’s part of working on your game… feeling uncomfortable in a good way, trying things you’re not used to.” For the world No. 3, that discomfort is part of a process she’s trusting her coaching team to guide her through. “Matt and [Jean-Christophe ‘JC’ Faurel]… first of all, they’re very good people, and they instill a lot of confidence in me. When you step on the court with confidence, it makes a big difference in your game,” Gauff explained. This “new Gauff” isn’t just aiming for success in Melbourne - her focus is on the bigger picture. “It’s just a reminder to keep improving,” she said, “and even if it’s uncomfortable, to stay focused on the long-term path. The goal is to keep making those adjustments so I can have a good career over time.” With a fresh mindset and a willingness to embrace the uncomfortable, Gauff is ready to continue her rise - one step, one match, one season at a time.",

                "content": "From dancing in the US Open stands at the age of eight to lifting the trophy in Arthur Ashe Stadium 11 years later, Cori \"Coco\" Gauff's rise in the tennis world has been meteoric. In 2023, she fulfilled her destiny by winning her home Grand Slam event, showcasing the immense potential that had been evident since her teenage years. Born Cori Dionne Gauff on March 13, 2004, in Delray Beach, Florida, USA, she hails from a family of accomplished collegiate athletes. Her father, Corey Gauff, played basketball for Georgia State University, while her mother, Candi Odom Gauff, was a track athlete for Florida State University. Gauff's talent for tennis became apparent early on, and aged 10, she went to France to train under Patrick Mouratoglou, the long-time coach of tennis superstar Serena Williams. The youngster gained widespread recognition in 2019 when she received a wildcard entry to Wimbledon. In a stunning debut, the then 15-year-old defeated her childhood idol, Venus Williams, in the first round of the competition. Gauff's became the youngest player to reach the fourth round of the grass-court Slam since Jennifer Capriati in 1991. She further solidified her reputation as a future star by reaching the third round of the US Open later that year. While she steadily climbed the WTA rankings with wins at the 2019 Linz Open and the 2021 Emilia-Romagna Open, a Grand Slam title remained elusive. In 2022, she reached the final of the French Open but succumbed to fellow rising star Iga Swiatek in straight sets, experiencing her first Grand Slam final loss. Gauff opened 2023 with victory in the Auckland Open, but her form dipped considerably after that. Bringing Pere Riba and Brad Gilbert into her coaching set-up proved a master stroke with the American teenager going on to win the Washington Open and her first WTA 1000 title in Cincinnati - where she defeated Swiatek for the first time in eight meetings - in quick succession. Then came the US Open, and despite the pressure of being the home favorite, the 19-year-old came from behind to defeat Aryna Sabalenka in the final. That made her the youngest American women's singles champion since Serena Williams in 1999. She was selected by the U.S. Committee in June 2021 for the delayed Tokyo Games but had to pull out after testing positive for COVID-19. Coco Gauff kicked off her 2024 Olympic year with a standout performance at the French Open, reaching the singles semifinals and achieving a career-high ranking of World No. 2. She also claimed her first Grand Slam doubles title at Roland Garros, partnering with Katerina Siniaková. Later that year, Gauff made her long-awaited Olympic debut at Paris 2024, where she made history as the youngest athlete to serve as the U.S. flag-bearer. Competing in both singles and doubles with her regular partner, Jessica Pegula, she took to the same court where she had competed at Roland Garros, losing in the third and second rounds for singles and doubles, respectively. Gauff’s year continued with her second WTA 1000 title at the China Open, where she became the youngest champion in 14 years. She also set a record for the most WTA 1000 wins before turning 21. The cherry on top came when she capped off the year by winning the WTA Finals singles title. At 20 years old, Gauff became the youngest WTA Finals Champion since Maria Sharapova in 2004 at just 17. She was also the first American to win the title since Serena Williams in 2014. Beyond her tennis prowess, Gauff is a passionate advocate for social justice causes. She has used her platform to address significant issues, particularly focusing on racial equality, climate change, and racial injustice. Her activism, both on and off the court, underscores her commitment to making a positive impact on the world. Athlete Olympic Results Content You may like",

                "content": "The English Premier League is a professional association football league in England and the highest level of the English football league system. Contested by 20 clubs, it operates on a system of promotion and relegation with the English Football League (EFL). Seasons usually run from August to May, with each team playing 38 matches: two against each other team, one home and one away.[1] Most games are played on weekend afternoons, with occasional weekday evening fixtures.[2] The competition was founded as the FA Premier League on 20 February 1992, following the decision of First Division (the top-tier league from 1888 until 1992) clubs to break away from the English Football League. However, teams may still be relegated to and promoted from the EFL Championship. The Premier League is a corporation managed by a chief executive, with member clubs acting as shareholders.[3] The Premier League takes advantage of a £5 billion television rights deal, with Sky and BT Group securing the domestic rights to broadcast 128 and 32 games, respectively.[4][5] This deal will rise to £6.7 billion for the four seasons from 2025 to 2029.[6] The league is projected to earn $7.2 billion in overseas TV rights from 2022 to 2025.[7] Clubs were apportioned central payment revenues of £2.4 billion in 2016–17, with a further £343 million in solidarity payments to EFL clubs.[8] The Premier League is the most-watched sports league in the world, broadcast in 212 territories to 643 million homes, with a potential TV audience of 4.7 billion people.[9][10] For the 2023–24 season, the average Premier League match attendance was 38,375,[11] second to the German Bundesliga's 39,512,[12] whilst aggregated attendance across all matches in a 38-game season is the highest of any association football league.[13] Most stadium occupancies are near capacity.[14] As of 2023[update], the Premier League is ranked first in the UEFA coefficient rankings based on performances in European competitions over the past five seasons, ahead of Spain's La Liga.[15] The English top-flight has produced the second-highest number of European Cup / UEFA Champions League titles, with a record six English clubs having won fifteen European championships in total.[16] Fifty-one clubs have competed in the Premier League since its inception in 1992: 49 from England and 2 from Wales. Seven of them have won the title: Manchester United (13), Manchester City (8), Chelsea (5), Arsenal (3), Blackburn Rovers (1), Leicester City (1), and Liverpool (1).[17] Only six clubs have played in every season to date: Arsenal, Chelsea, Everton, Liverpool, Manchester United, and Tottenham Hotspur.[18] Despite significant European success in the 1970s and early 1980s, the late 1980s marked a low point for English football. Stadiums were deteriorating, supporters endured poor facilities, hooliganism was rife, and English clubs had been banned from European competition for five years following the Heysel Stadium disaster between the fans of Liverpool Football Club and the fans of Juventus in 1985.[19] The Football League First Division, the top level of English football since 1888, was behind leagues such as Italy's Serie A and Spain's La Liga in attendance and revenues, and several top English players had moved abroad.[20] By the turn of the 1990s, the downward trend was starting to reverse. At the 1990 FIFA World Cup, England reached the semi-finals; UEFA, European football's governing body, lifted the five-year ban on English clubs playing in European competitions in 1990, resulting in Manchester United lifting the Cup Winners' Cup in 1991. The Taylor Report on stadium safety standards, which proposed expensive upgrades to create all-seater stadiums in the aftermath of the Hillsborough disaster; between the fans of Liverpool and the fans of Nottingham Forest at Hillsborough Stadium, Sheffield, Yorkshire on 15 April 1989, was published in January 1990.[21] During the 1980s, major English clubs began to transform into business ventures, applying commercial principles to club administration to maximise revenue. Martin Edwards of Manchester United, Irving Scholar of Tottenham Hotspur, and David Dein of Arsenal were among the leaders in this transformation.[22] The commercial imperative led to the top clubs seeking to increase their power and revenue: the clubs in Division One threatened to break away from the Football League, and in doing so, they managed to increase their voting power and gain a more favourable financial arrangement, taking a 50% share of all television and sponsorship income in 1986.[22] They demanded that television companies should pay more for their coverage of football matches,[23] and revenue from television grew in importance. The Football League received £6.3 million for a two-year agreement in 1986, but by 1988, in a deal agreed with ITV, the price rose to £44 million over four years, with the leading clubs taking 75% of the cash.[24][25] According to Scholar, who was involved in the negotiations of television deals, each of the First Division clubs received only around £25,000 per year from television rights before 1986, this increased to around £50,000 in the 1986 negotiation, then to £600,000 in 1988.[26] The 1988 negotiations were conducted under the threat of ten clubs leaving to form a \"super league\", but they were eventually persuaded to stay, with the top clubs taking the lion's share of the deal.[24][27][28] The negotiations also convinced the bigger clubs that, in order to receive enough votes, they needed to take the whole of the First Division with them instead of a smaller \"super league\".[29] By the beginning of the 1990s, the big clubs again considered breaking away, especially now that they had to fund the cost of stadium upgrades as proposed by the Taylor Report.[30] In 1990, the managing director of London Weekend Television (LWT), Greg Dyke, met with the representatives of the \"big five\" football clubs in England (Manchester United, Liverpool, Tottenham Hotspur, Everton, and Arsenal) over a dinner.[31] The meeting was to pave the way for a breakaway from the Football League.[32] Dyke believed that it would be more lucrative for LWT if only the larger clubs in the country were featured on national television and wanted to establish whether the clubs would be interested in a larger share of television rights money.[33] The five clubs agreed with the suggestion and decided to press ahead with it; however, the league would have no credibility without the backing of the Football Association, and so David Dein of Arsenal held talks to see whether the FA were receptive to the idea. The FA did not have an amicable relationship with the Football League at the time and considered it a way to weaken the Football League's position.[34] The FA released a report in June 1991, Blueprint for the Future of Football, that supported the plan for the Premier League, with the FA as the ultimate authority that would oversee the breakaway league.[29] At the close of the 1990–1991 season, a proposal was tabled for the establishment of a new league that would bring more money into the game overall. The Founder Members Agreement, signed on 17 July 1991, by the game's top-flight clubs, established the basic principles for setting up the FA Premier League.[35] The newly formed top division was to have commercial independence from the Football Association and the Football League, giving the FA Premier League licence to negotiate its own broadcast and sponsorship agreements. The argument given at the time was that the extra income would allow English clubs to compete with teams across Europe.[20] Although Dyke played a significant role in the creation of the Premier League, he and ITV (of which LWT was part) lost out in the bidding for broadcast rights: BSkyB won with a bid of £304 million over five years, with the BBC awarded the highlights package broadcast on Match of the Day.[31][33] Luton Town, Notts County, and West Ham United were the three teams relegated from the old First Division at the end of the 1991–92 season, and did not take part in the inaugural Premier League season. They were replaced by Ipswich Town, Middlesbrough, and Blackburn Rovers, promoted from the old Second Division.[36] The 22 First Division clubs resigned en masse from the Football League in 1992, and on 27 May that year, the FA Premier League was formed as a limited company, working out of an office at the Football Association's then headquarters in Lancaster Gate.[20] The 22 inaugural members of the new Premier League were:[37] This meant a break-up of the 104-year-old Football League that had operated until then with four divisions; the Premier League would operate with a single division and the Football League with three. There was no change in competition format; the same number of teams competed in the top flight, and promotion and relegation between the Premier League and the new First Division remained the same as the old First and Second Divisions, with three teams relegated from the league and three promoted.[28] The league held its first season in 1992–93. It was composed of 22 clubs for that season (reduced to 20 in the 1995–96 season). The first Premier League goal was scored by Brian Deane of Sheffield United in a 2–1 win against Manchester United.[38] Manchester United won the inaugural edition of the new league, ending a twenty-six year wait to be crowned champions of England. Bolstered by this breakthrough, United immediately became the competition's dominant team, winning seven of the first nine trophies, two League and FA Cup 'doubles' and a European treble, initially under a team of hardened veterans such as Bryan Robson, Steve Bruce, Paul Ince, Mark Hughes, and Eric Cantona, before Cantona, Bruce, and Roy Keane led a young, dynamic new team filled with the Class of 92, a group of young players including David Beckham who came through the Manchester United Academy. Between 1993 and 1997, Blackburn Rovers and Newcastle United came close to challenging Manchester United's early dominance; Blackburn won the 1994–95 FA Premier League and Newcastle led the title charge over United for much of the 1995–96 season. As the decade closed, Arsenal replicated Manchester United's dominance by winning the League and FA Cup double in 1997–98, and together they would form a duopoly over the league between 1997 and 2003. The 2000s saw the rise of Liverpool alongside the \"Big 2\", followed by Chelsea finally breaking the Arsenal–Man United duopoly by winning the league in 2004–05. The dominance of the so-called \"Big Four\" clubs – Arsenal, Chelsea, Liverpool, and Manchester United[39][40] – saw them finish at the top of the table for most of the decade, thereby guaranteeing qualification for the UEFA Champions League. Only three other clubs managed to qualify for the competition during this period: Newcastle United (2001–02 and 2002–03), Everton (2004–05), and Tottenham Hotspur (2009–10) – each occupying the final Champions League spot, with the exception of Newcastle in the 2002–03 season, who finished third. Following the 2003–04 season, Arsenal acquired the nickname \"The Invincibles\" as they became the first and, to date, only club to complete a Premier League campaign without losing a single game.[41][42] In May 2008, Kevin Keegan stated that \"Big Four\" dominance threatened the division: \"This league is in danger of becoming one of the most boring but great leagues in the world.\"[43] Premier League chief executive Richard Scudamore said in defence: \"There are a lot of different tussles that go on in the Premier League depending on whether you're at the top, in the middle, or at the bottom that make it interesting.\"[44] Between 2005 and 2012, there was a Premier League representative in seven of the eight Champions League finals, with only the \"Big Four\" clubs reaching that stage. Liverpool (2005), Manchester United (2008), and Chelsea (2012) won the competition during this period, with Arsenal (2006), Liverpool (2007), Chelsea (2008), and Manchester United (2009 and 2011) all losing Champions League finals.[45] Leeds United were the only non-\"Big Four\" side to reach the semi-finals of the Champions League, in the 2000–01 season. There were three Premier League teams in the Champions League semi-finals in 2006–07, 2007–08, and 2008–09, a feat only ever achieved five times (along with Serie A in 2002–03 and La Liga in 1999–2000). Additionally, between the 1999–2000 and 2009–10 seasons, four Premier League sides reached the UEFA Cup or Europa League finals, with only Liverpool managing to win the competition in 2001. Arsenal (2000), Middlesbrough (2006), and Fulham (2010) all lost their finals.[46] Although the group's dominance was reduced to a degree after this period with the emergence of Manchester City and Tottenham, in terms of all-time Premier League points won, they remain clear by some margin. As of the end of the 2021–22 season – the 30th season of the Premier League – Liverpool, in fourth place in the all-time points table, were over 300 points ahead of the next team, Tottenham Hotspur. They are also the only teams to maintain a winning average of over 50% throughout their entire Premier League tenures.[47] The years following 2009 marked a shift from the \"Big Four\" with Tottenham Hotspur and Manchester City breaking into the top four places on a regular basis, turning the \"Big Four\" into the \"Big Six\".[48] In the 2009–10 season, Tottenham finished fourth and became the first new team to finish in the top four since Everton five years prior.[49] Criticism of the gap between an elite group of \"super clubs\" and the majority of the Premier League has continued, nevertheless, due to their increasing ability to spend more than the other Premier League clubs.[50] Manchester City won the title in the 2011–12 season, becoming the first club outside the \"Big Four\" to win since Blackburn Rovers in the 1994–95 season. That season also saw two of the \"Big Four\" (Chelsea and Liverpool) finish outside the top four places for the first time since that season.[48] With only four UEFA Champions League qualifying places available in the league, greater competition for qualification now exists, albeit from a narrow base of six clubs. In the five seasons following the 2011–12 campaign, Manchester United and Liverpool both found themselves outside of the top four three times, whilst Chelsea finished 10th in the 2015–16 season. Arsenal finished 5th in 2016–17, ending their record run of 20 consecutive top-four finishes.[51] In the 2015–16 season, underdogs Leicester City won the Premier League. With 5000/1 odds of winning the league at the beginning of the season, Leicester became the first club outside the \"Big Six\" to win the Premier League since Blackburn Rovers in the 1994–95 season.[52] Off the pitch, the \"Big Six\" wield significant financial power and influence, with these clubs arguing that they should be entitled to a greater share of revenue due to the greater stature of their clubs globally and the attractive football they aim to play.[53] Objectors argue that the egalitarian revenue structure in the Premier League helps to maintain a competitive league which is vital for its future success.[54] The 2016–17 Deloitte Football Money League report showed the financial disparity between the \"Big Six\" and the rest of the division. All of the \"Big Six\" had revenues greater than €350 million, with Manchester United having the largest revenue in the league at €676.3 million. Leicester City was the closest club to the \"Big Six\" in terms of revenue, recording a figure of €271.1 million for that season – helped by participation in the Champions League. The eighth-largest revenue generator, West Ham – who did not play in European competition – had revenues of €213.3 million, less than half of those of the club with the fifth-largest revenue, Liverpool (€424.2 million).[55] A substantial part of the clubs' revenue by then came from television broadcast deals, with the biggest clubs each taking from around £150 million to nearly £200 million in the 2016–17 season from such deals.[56] In Deloitte's 2019 report, all the \"Big Six\" were in the top ten of the world's richest clubs.[57] From the 2019–20 season, video assistant referees were used in the league.[58] The 2019–20 season saw Liverpool win their first Premier League trophy, their first top-flight trophy in 30 years.[59] Project Big Picture was announced in October 2020 that described a plan to reunite the top Premier League clubs with the English Football League, proposed by leading Premier League clubs Manchester United and Liverpool.[60] It has been criticised by the Premier League leadership and the UK government's Department for Culture, Media and Sport.[61] On 26 April 2021, play was stopped during a match between Leicester City and Crystal Palace to allow players Wesley Fofana and Cheikhou Kouyaté to break Ramadan fast. It is believed to be the first time in Premier League history that a game was paused to allow Muslim players to eat and drink after the sun had set in accordance with the rules of the faith.[62] The 2022–23 season was the first to take a six-week break between November and December 2022 to allow for the first winter World Cup,[63] with a return for the Boxing Day fixtures.[64] The Premier League players decided to take the knee at selected \"significant moments\". They assured to \"remain resolutely committed to eradicate racial prejudice\".[65] That season was notable for Newcastle United and Brighton & Hove Albion breaking the traditional \"Big Six\" as they finished fourth and sixth, respectively, whilst \"Big Six\" teams Tottenham and Chelsea finished eighth and twelfth.[66][67] Meanwhile, 2015–16 champions Leicester City were relegated, becoming the second league-winning club to suffer relegation since 1992, after Blackburn Rovers in the 2011–12 season.[68] In the 2023–24 season, Manchester City won the Premier League for the sixth time in seven years to become the first top-flight team to win four consecutive league titles in English football history.[69] Meanwhile, non-Big Six club Aston Villa finished fourth and qualified for the 2024–25 UEFA Champions League.[70] The Football Association Premier League Ltd (FAPL)[71][72][73] is operated as a corporation and is owned by the 20 member clubs. Each club is a shareholder, with one vote each on issues such as rule changes and contracts. The clubs select a chairman, chief executive, and board of directors to oversee the daily operations of the league.[74] The Football Association is not directly involved in the day-to-day operations of the Premier League, but has veto power as a special shareholder during the election of the chairman and chief executive and when new rules are adopted by the league.[75] The current chief executive is Richard Masters, who was appointed in December 2019.[76] The chair is currently Alison Brittain, who took over the role in early 2023.[77] The Premier League sends representatives to UEFA's European Club Association, the number of clubs and the clubs themselves chosen according to UEFA coefficients. For the 2023–24 season, the Premier League has 13 representatives in the Association: Arsenal, Aston Villa, Brighton & Hove Albion, Chelsea, Everton, Liverpool, Manchester City, Manchester United, Newcastle United, Nottingham Forest, Tottenham Hotspur, West Ham United, and Wolverhampton Wanderers.[78] The European Club Association is responsible for electing three members to UEFA's Club Competitions Committee, which is involved in the operations of UEFA competitions such as the Champions League and UEFA Europa League.[79] The Premier League has faced criticism of its governance due to an alleged lack of transparency and accountability. Following the Premier League's blocking of the attempted takeover of Newcastle United by a PIF-backed consortium through the league's Owners' and Directors' test, many MPs, Newcastle United fans and related parties to the deal denounced the Premier League for its perceived lack of transparency and accountability throughout the process.[80][81][82] On 6 July 2021, consortium member Amanda Staveley of PCP Capital Partners said that \"fans surely deserve absolute transparency from the regulators across all their processes – to best ensure that they act responsibly. They (the Premier League) are performing a function like that of a government regulator – but without the same systems for accountability.\"[82] On 22 July 2021, Tracey Crouch MP – chair of the fan-led review into the UK's football governance – announced in the review's interim findings that the Premier League had \"lost the trust and confidence\" of fans. The review also recommended that a new independent regulator be created to oversee matters such as club takeovers.[83][84] Premier League chief executive Richard Masters had earlier spoken out against the implementation of an independent regulator, saying in May 2021, \"I don't think that the independent regulator is the answer to the question. I would defend the Premier League's role as regulator of its clubs over the past 30 years.\"[85] [The Premier League] is very tough and is different. If you compare this league to another league, it's like playing another sport. In [The Premier League] you never really know what is going to happen, there is very little between the teams. There are 20 clubs in the Premier League. During the course of a season (from August to May) each club plays the others twice (a double round-robin system), once at their home stadium and once at that of their opponents, for 38 games. Teams receive three points for a win and one point for a draw. No points are awarded for a loss. Teams are ranked by total points, then goal difference, and then goals scored. If still equal, teams are deemed to occupy the same position. If there is a tie for the championship, for relegation, or for qualification to other competitions, the head-to-head record between the tied teams is taken into consideration (points scored in the matches between the teams, followed by away goals in those matches.) If two teams are still tied, a play-off match at a neutral venue decides rank.[88] A system of promotion and relegation exists between the Premier League and the EFL Championship. The three lowest placed teams in the Premier League are relegated to the Championship, and the top two teams from the Championship promoted to the Premier League,[89] with an additional team promoted after a series of play-offs involving the third, fourth, fifth and sixth placed clubs.[90] The number of clubs was reduced from 22 to 20 in 1995, when four teams were relegated from the league and only two teams promoted.[91][92] The top flight had only been expanded to 22 teams at the start of the 1991–92 season – the year prior to the formation of the Premier League.[92] On 8 June 2006, FIFA requested that all major European leagues, including Italy's Serie A and Spain's La Liga, be reduced to 18 teams by the start of the 2007–08 season. The Premier League responded by announcing their intention to resist such a reduction.[93] Ultimately, the 2007–08 season kicked off again with 20 teams.[94] Video assistant referee (VAR), was introduced to the Premier League at the beginning of the 2019–20 season. It uses technology and officials to assist the referee in making decisions on the pitch.[95] However, its use has been met with mixed receptions from fans and pundits, with some praising its accuracy whilst others criticise its impact on the flow of the game and consistency of decision-making. The on-field referee still makes the final decision, but VAR can assist the referee in the decision-making process. VAR can only be used for four types of decisions: goals, penalty decisions, direct red card incidents, and cases of mistaken identity. VAR officials review the video footage and communicate with the on-field referee via a headset. The VAR officials are located in a central control room, which is equipped with multiple camera angles and the ability to replay footage at various speeds. A study evaluating fan reception of VAR in the Premier League was made by Otto Kolbinger and Melanie Knopp and was done by analysing Twitter data.[96] The researchers used sentiment analysis to measure the overall positive or negative attitudes towards VAR, as well as topic modelling to identify specific issues that fans are discussing related to VAR. The study found that the reception of VAR on Twitter is largely negative, with fans expressing frustration and criticism of the technology's impact on the flow of the game and the inconsistency of decisions. The researchers also identified specific issues, such as handball and offside decisions, that fans are particularly critical of. The study concludes that VAR has not been well received by fans in the Premier League, and that efforts to improve the technology and increase transparency in decision-making are needed to address these concerns. Fifty-one clubs have played in the Premier League from its inception in 1992, up to and including the 2023–24 season.[97] Titles won by club (%) Italics indicate former Premier League champions that are currently outside the Premier League. Twenty clubs are competing in the 2024–25 season – top seventeen from the previous season and three promoted from the Championship. In 2011, after Swansea City gained promotion, a Welsh club participated in the Premier League for the first time.[98][99] The first Premier League match to be played outside England was Swansea City's home match at Liberty Stadium against Wigan Athletic on 20 August 2011.[100] The number of Welsh clubs in the Premier League increased to two in 2013–14, as Cardiff City gained promotion,[101] but they were relegated after their maiden season.[102] Cardiff were promoted again in 2017–18 but the number of Welsh clubs remained the same for the 2018–19 Premier League season, as Swansea City had been relegated from the Premier League in 2017–18.[103] Following Cardiff City's relegation after the 2018–19 season, there are currently no Welsh clubs participating in the Premier League.[104] Because they are members of the Football Association of Wales (FAW), the question of whether clubs like Swansea should represent England or Wales in European competitions has caused long-running discussions in UEFA. Swansea took one of England's three available places in the Europa League in 2013–14 by winning the League Cup in 2012–13.[105] The right of Welsh clubs to take up such English places was in doubt until UEFA clarified the matter in March 2012, allowing them to participate.[106] Participation in the Premier League by some Scottish or Irish clubs has sometimes been discussed, but without result. The idea came closest to reality in 1998, when Wimbledon received Premier League approval to relocate to Dublin, Ireland, but the move was blocked by the Football Association of Ireland.[107][108][109][110] Additionally, the media occasionally discusses the idea that Scotland's two biggest teams, Celtic and Rangers, should or will take part in the Premier League, but nothing has come of these discussions.[111] The top four teams in the Premier League qualify automatically for the subsequent season's UEFA Champions League league phase. The champions of the Champions League and UEFA Europa League may earn an additional qualification for the subsequent season's Champions League league phase if did not finish in the top four. If this means six Premier League teams qualify, then the fourth-placed team in the Premier League is instead entered in the Europa League, as any single nation is limited to a maximum of five teams in the Champions League. However, starting from the 2024–25 UEFA Champions League there are additional berths for the two best associations in the previous season's ranking, which may result in a maximum of six teams from one association in the Champions League. The fifth-placed team in the Premier League, as well as the winners of the FA Cup, qualify for the subsequent season's Europa League league phase, but if the winner of the FA Cup also finishes in the top five places in the Premier League or has won one of UEFA's major tournaments, then this place reverts to the team that finished sixth. The winner of the EFL Cup qualifies for the subsequent season's UEFA Conference League, but if the winner had already qualified for a UEFA competition via their performance in another competition, then this place reverts to the team that finished sixth in the Premier League, or seventh if the FA Cup result had already caused the sixth-placed team to qualify.[112] The number of places allocated to English clubs in UEFA competitions is dependent upon the position the country holds in the UEFA coefficient rankings, which are calculated based on the performance of teams in UEFA competitions over the previous five years. Currently, England is ranked first, ahead of Spain. As of 26 September 2024, the coefficients for are as follows (only top five European leagues are shown):[113][114] An exception to the usual European qualification system happened in 2005, after Liverpool won the Champions League the season before, but did not finish in a Champions League qualification place in the Premier League. UEFA gave special dispensation for Liverpool to enter the Champions League, giving England five qualifiers.[115] The governing body subsequently ruled that the defending champions qualify for the competition the following year regardless of their domestic league placing. However, for those leagues with four entrants in the Champions League, this meant that if the Champions League winners finished outside the top four in its domestic league, it would qualify at the expense of the fourth-placed team. At that time, no association could have more than four entrants in the Champions League.[116] This occurred in 2012, when Chelsea – who had won the Champions League that summer, but finished sixth in the league – qualified for the 2012–13 Champions League in place of Tottenham Hotspur, who went into the Europa League.[117] From 2015–16, the Europa League champions qualify for the Champions League, increasing the maximum number of participants per country to five.[118] This took effect in England in 2016–17, when Manchester United finished sixth in the Premier League and won the Europa League, giving England five Champions League entrants for 2017–18.[119] In these instances, any Europa League berth vacated is not handed down to the next-best Premier League finisher outside of a qualifying place. If both Champions League and Europa League winners are of the same association and both finish outside the top four, then the fourth-placed team is transferred to the Europa League. With 48 continental trophies won, English clubs are the third-most successful in European football, behind Italy (50) and Spain (67). In the top-tier UEFA Champions League, a record six English clubs have won a total of 15 titles and lost a further 11 finals, behind Spanish clubs with 20 and 11, respectively.[120] In the second-tier UEFA Europa League, English clubs are third, with nine victories and eight losses in the finals.[121] In the former second-tier UEFA Cup Winners' Cup, English teams won a record eight titles and had a further five finalists.[122] In the non-UEFA organised Inter-Cities Fairs Cup, English clubs provided four winners and four runners-up, the second-most behind Spain with six and three, respectively.[123] In the newly created third-tier UEFA Conference League, English clubs have won a joint-record one title so far.[124] In the former fourth-tier UEFA Intertoto Cup, England won four titles and had a further final appearance, placing it fifth in the rankings, although English clubs were notorious for treating the tournament with disdain, either sending \"B\" squads or withdrawing from it altogether.[125][126][127] In the one-off UEFA Super Cup, England has ten winners and ten runners-up, the second-most behind Spain with 17 and 15, respectively.[128] Similarly to the Intertoto Cup, English teams did not take the former Intercontinental Cup seriously enough, despite its international status of the Club World Championship. They a made a total of six appearances in the one-off competition, winning only one of them, and withdrew a further three times.[129] English clubs have won the FIFA-organised Club World Cup four times, tied for the second-most with Brazil, and behind only Spain, with eight.[130][127] After an inaugural season with no sponsorship, the Premier League was sponsored by Carling from 1993 until 2001, during which time it was known as the FA Carling Premiership. In 2001, a new sponsorship deal with Barclaycard saw the league rebranded the FA Barclaycard Premiership, which was changed to the FA Barclays Premiership in time for the 2004–05 season. For the 2007–08 season, the league was rebranded the Barclays Premier League.[131][132] Barclays' deal with the Premier League expired at the end of the 2015–16 season. The organisation announced on 4 June 2015 that it would not pursue any further title sponsorship deals for the Premier League, arguing that they wanted to build a \"clean\" brand for the competition more in line with those of major U.S. sports leagues.[134] As well as sponsorship for the league itself, the Premier League has a number of official partners and suppliers.[135] The official ball supplier for the league is Nike who have had the contract since the 2000–01 season when they took over from Mitre.[136] Under its Merlin brand, Topps held the licence to produce collectables for the Premier League between 1994 and 2019 including stickers (for their sticker album) and trading cards.[137] Launched in the 2007–08 season, Topps' Match Attax, the official Premier League trading card game, is the best selling boys collectable in the UK, and is also the biggest selling sports trading card game in the world.[137][138] In October 2018, Panini were awarded the licence to produce collectables from the 2019–20 season.[139] The chocolate company Cadbury has been the official snack partner of the Premier League since 2017, and sponsored the Golden Boot, Golden Glove and Playmaker of the Season awards from the 2017–18 season to 2019–20 season.[140][141] The Coca-Cola Company (under its Coca-Cola Zero Sugar product line) sponsored these awards during the 2020–21 season with Castrol being the current sponsor as of the 2021–22 season.[142] The Premier League has the highest revenue of any association football league in the world, with total club revenues of €2.48 billion in 2009–10.[143][144] In 2013–14, due to improved television revenues and cost controls, the Premier League clubs collectively made a net profit in excess of £78 million, exceeding all other football leagues.[145] In 2010 the Premier League was awarded the Queen's Award for Enterprise in the International Trade category for its outstanding contribution to international trade and the value it brings to English football and the United Kingdom's broadcasting industry.[146] The Premier League includes some of the richest football clubs in the world. Deloitte's \"Football Money League\" listed seven Premier League clubs in the top 20 for the 2009–10 season,[147] and all 20 clubs were in the top 40 globally by the end of the 2013–14 season, largely as a result of increased broadcasting revenue.[148] In 2019, the league generated around £3.1 billion per year in domestic and international television rights.[4] Premier League clubs agreed in principle in December 2012, to radical new cost controls. The two proposals consist of a break-even rule and a cap on the amount clubs can increase their wage bill by each season. With the new television deals on the horizon, momentum has been growing to find ways of preventing the majority of the cash going straight to players and agents.[149] Central payments for the 2016–17 season amounted to £2,398,515,773 across the 20 clubs, with each team receiving a flat participation fee of £35,301,989 and additional payments for TV broadcasts (£1,016,690 for general UK rights to match highlights, £1,136,083 for each live UK broadcast of their games and £39,090,596 for all overseas rights), commercial rights (a flat fee of £4,759,404) and a notional measure of \"merit\" which was based upon final league position.[8] The merit component was a nominal sum of £1,941,609 multiplied by each finishing place, counted from the foot of the table (e.g., Burnley finished 16th in May 2017, five places counting upwards, and received 5 × £1,941,609 = £9,708,045 merit payment).[8] Since its split with the Football League, established clubs in the Premier League have a funding disparity from counterparts in lower leagues. Revenue from television rights between the leagues has played a part in this.[150] Promoted teams have found it difficult to avoid relegation in their first Premier League season. One Premier League newcomer has been relegated back to the Football League every season, save the 2001–02, 2011–12, 2017–18 & 2022–23 seasons. In the 1997–98 and 2023–24 seasons, all three promoted clubs were relegated by the season's end.[151] The Premier League distributes a portion of its television revenue as \"parachute payments\" to relegated clubs for adjustment to television revenue loss. The average Premier League team receives £41 million[152] whilst the average Championship club receives £2 million.[153] Starting with the 2013–14 season, these payments are in excess of £60 million over four seasons.[154] Critics maintain that the payments widen the gap between teams that have reached the Premier League and those that have not,[155] leading to the common occurrence of teams \"bouncing back\" soon after their relegation. Clubs which have failed to win immediate promotion back to the Premier League have seen financial problems, in some cases administration or liquidation. Further relegations down the footballing ladder have occurred for multiple clubs unable to cope with the gap.[156][157] Television has played a major role in the history of the Premier League. The League's decision to assign broadcasting rights to Sky in 1992 was at the time a radical decision, but one that has paid off. At the time, paid television was an almost untested proposition in the UK market as was charging fans to watch live televised football. However, a combination of Sky's strategy, the quality of Premier League football and the public's appetite for the game has seen the value of the Premier League's TV rights soar.[25] The Premier League sells its television rights on a collective basis. This is in contrast to some other European leagues, including La Liga, in which each club sells its rights individually, leading to a much higher share of the total income going to the top few clubs.[159] The money is divided into three parts:[160] half is divided equally between the clubs; one quarter is awarded on a merit basis based on final league position, the top club getting twenty times as much as the bottom club, and equal steps all the way down the table; the final quarter is paid out as facilities fees for games that are shown on television, with the top clubs generally receiving the largest shares of this. The income from overseas rights is divided equally between the twenty clubs.[161] Not all Premier League matches are televised in the United Kingdom, as the league upholds the long-standing prohibition on telecasts of any association football match (domestic or otherwise) that kicks off between 2:45 p.m. and 5:15 p.m. on Saturday matchdays.[162][163][164] The first Sky television rights agreement was worth £304 million over five seasons.[165] The next contract, negotiated to start from the 1997–98 season, rose to £670 million over four seasons.[165] The third contract was a £1.024 billion deal with BSkyB for the three seasons from 2001 to 2004. The league brought in £320 million from the sale of its international rights for the three-year period from 2004 to 2007. It sold the rights itself on a territory-by-territory basis.[166] Sky's monopoly was broken from August 2006 when Setanta Sports was awarded rights to show two out of the six packages of matches available. This occurred following an insistence by the European Commission that exclusive rights should not be sold to one television company. Sky and Setanta paid £1.7 billion, a two-thirds increase which took many commentators by surprise as it had been widely assumed that the value of the rights had levelled off following many years of rapid growth. Setanta also hold rights to a live 3 pm match solely for Irish viewers. The BBC retained the rights to show highlights for the same three seasons (on Match of the Day) for £171.6 million, a 63 per cent increase on the £105 million it paid for the previous three-year period.[167] Sky and BT Group (via its new channel BT Sport, now TNT Sports) agreed to jointly pay £84.3 million for delayed television rights to 242 games (that is the right to broadcast them in full on television and over the internet) in most cases for a period of 50 hours after 10 p.m. on matchday.[168] Overseas television rights fetched £625 million, nearly double the previous contract.[169] The total raised from those deals was more than £2.7 billion, giving Premier League clubs an average media income from league games of around £40 million-a-year from 2007 to 2010.[170] The TV rights agreement between the Premier League and Sky faced accusations of being a cartel, and a number of court cases arose as a result.[171] An investigation by the Office of Fair Trading in 2002 found BSkyB to be dominant within the pay TV sports market, but concluded that there were insufficient grounds for the claim that BSkyB had abused its dominant position.[172] In July 1999 the Premier League's method of selling rights collectively for all member clubs was investigated by the UK Restrictive Practices Court, which concluded that the agreement was not contrary to the public interest.[173] The BBC's highlights package on Saturday and Sunday nights, as well as other evenings when fixtures justify, ran until 2016.[174] Television rights alone for the period 2010 to 2013 were purchased for £1.782 billion.[175] On 22 June 2009, due to troubles encountered by Setanta Sports after it failed to meet a final deadline over a £30 million payment to the Premier League, ESPN was awarded two packages of UK rights containing 46 matches that were available for the 2009–10 season as well as a package of 23 matches per season from 2010 to 2013.[176] On 13 June 2012, the Premier League announced that BT had been awarded 38 games a season for the 2013–14, 2014–15 and 2015–16 seasons at £246 million-a-year. The remaining 116 games were retained by Sky, which paid £760 million-a-year. The total domestic rights raised £3.018 billion, an increase of 70.2% over the 2010–11 to 2012–13 rights.[177] The value of the licensing deal rose by another 70.2% in 2015, when Sky and BT paid £5.136 billion to renew their contracts with the Premier League for another three years up to the 2018–19 season.[178] A new rights cycle began in the 2019–20 season, with the domestic package increasing to 200 matches overall; in February 2018, BT were awarded the package of 32 lunchtime fixtures on Saturdays, whilst Sky was awarded four of the seven packages, covering the majority of weekend fixtures (including eight new prime time fixtures on Saturdays), as well as Monday and Friday matches. Two remaining packages of 20 fixtures each were to be sold at a later date, including three rounds of mid-week fixtures and a bank holiday round. As Sky already owned the maximum number of matches it could hold without breaching a 148-match cap, it was speculated that at least one of the new packages could go to a new entrant, such as a streaming service. The five packages sold to BT and Sky were valued at £4.464 billion.[179] In June 2018, it was announced that Amazon Prime Video and BT had acquired the remaining two packages; Amazon acquired rights to 20 matches per-season, covering a mid-week round in December, and all Boxing Day fixtures.[180] The Amazon telecasts are produced in association with Sunset + Vine and BT Sport.[181] With the resumption of play in the 2019–20 Premier League due to the COVID-19 pandemic in the United Kingdom, the Premier League announced that all remaining matches would be carried on British television, split primarily across Sky, BT, and Amazon. A large number of these matches were also scheduled for free-to-air broadcasts, with Sky airing 25 on Pick, Amazon streaming its four matches on Twitch, and the BBC – for the first time in league history – carrying four live matches.[182][183][184][185] As matches would continue to be played without spectators upon the start of the 2020–21 Premier League, its clubs voted on 8 September to continue broadcasting all matches through at least September (with the BBC and Amazon each holding one additional match), and \"appropriate arrangements\" being made for October.[186][187] It was later announced that matches not selected for broadcast would be carried on pay-per-view via BT Sport Box Office and Sky Box Office at a cost of £14.95 per-match. The PPV scheme was poorly received; the Football Supporters' Federation felt that the price was too high, and there were concerns that it could encourage piracy. There were calls from supporters to boycott the pay-per-views, and make donations to support charitable causes instead (with Newcastle's \"Charity Not PPV\" campaign raising £20,000 for a local food bank, and Arsenal fans raising £34,000 for Islington Giving). On 13 November, amid the reintroduction of measures across the UK, the Premier League officially announced that the non-televised matches would be assigned to its main broadcast partners, and again including additional matches for the BBC and Amazon Prime.[188][189][190][191] The next cycle of rights between 2022–23 and 2024–25 season was renewed without tender due to compelling and exceptional circumstances in light of the COVID-19 pandemic. Therefore, rights remained as they were since the 2019–20 season.[192] UK highlights In August 2016, it was announced the BBC would be creating a new magazine-style show for the Premier League entitled The Premier League Show.[193] The Premier League is the most-watched football league in the world, broadcast in 212 territories to 643 million homes and a potential TV audience of 4.7 billion people.[9] The Premier League's production arm, Premier League Productions, is operated by IMG Productions and produces content for its international television partners.[194] On 22 November 2024, the Premier League announced plans to end its agreement with IMG and take Premier League Productions in-house beginning in 2026–27.[195] The Premier League is the most widely distributed sports programme in Asia.[196] In the Indian subcontinent, the matches are broadcast live on STAR Sports.[197] In MENA region, BeIN Sports holds exclusive rights to the Premier League.[198] In China, the broadcast rights were awarded to iQiyi, Migu and CCTV that began in the 2021–22 season.[199][200][201] SCTV broadcast the matches for Indonesia, and Astro for Malaysia. In Australia, Optus telecommunications holds exclusive rights to the Premier League, providing live broadcasts and online access (Fox Sports formerly held rights).[202] As of the 2022–23 season, Canadian media rights to the Premier League are owned by FuboTV,[203] after having been jointly owned by Sportsnet and TSN, and most recently DAZN.[204] The Premier League is broadcast in the United States by NBC Sports, a division of Sky parent Comcast.[205] Acquiring the rights to the Premier League in 2013 (replacing Fox Soccer and ESPN), NBC Sports has been widely praised for its coverage.[206][207][208] NBC Sports reached a six-year extension with the Premier League in 2015 to broadcast the league until the end of the 2021–22 season in a deal valued at $1 billion (£640 million).[209][210] In November 2021, NBC reached another six-year extension through 2028 in a deal valued at $2.76 billion (£2 billion).[211][212] The Premier League is broadcast by SuperSport across sub-Saharan Africa.[213] Broadcasters to continental Europe until 2025 include Canal+ for France,[214] Sky Sport Germany for Germany and Austria,[215] Match TV for Russia,[216] Sky Sport Italy for Italy,[217] Eleven Sports for Portugal,[218] DAZN for Spain,[219] beIN Sports Turkey to Turkey,[220] Digi Sport for Romania,[221] and NENT to Nordic countries (Sweden, Denmark and Norway),[222] Poland and the Netherlands.[223] In South America, ESPN covers much of the continent,[224] with coverage in Brazil shared between ESPN Brasil and ESPN4.[225][226] Paramount+ broadcasts the league in Central America.[227] As of the 2023–24 season, Premier League football has been played in 61 stadiums since the formation of the division.[228] The Hillsborough disaster in 1989 and the subsequent Taylor Report saw a recommendation that standing terraces should be abolished. As a result, all stadiums in the Premier League are all-seater.[229][230] Since the formation of the Premier League, football grounds in England have seen constant improvements to capacity and facilities, with some clubs moving to new-build stadiums.[231] Eleven stadiums that have seen Premier League football have now been demolished. The stadiums for the 2023–24 season show a large disparity in capacity. For example, Old Trafford, the home of Manchester United, has a capacity of 74,031 whilst Dean Court, the home of Bournemouth, has a capacity of 11,307. The combined total capacity of the Premier League in the 2023–24 season is 787,002 with an average capacity of 39,350. Stadium attendances are a significant source of regular income for Premier League clubs.[232] For the 2022–23 season, average attendances across the league clubs were 40,235 for Premier League matches with an aggregate attendance of 15,289,340.[233] This represents an increase of 19,109 from the average attendance of 21,126 recorded in the Premier League's first season (1992–93).[234] However, during the 1992–93 season, the capacities of most stadiums were reduced as clubs replaced terraces with seats in order to meet the Taylor Report's 1994–95 deadline for all-seater stadiums.[235][236] The 2022–23 season also set a competition record for total attendance with more than 15 million spectators, with average attendance also reaching record levels, surpassing the previous record of 39,989 set in the 2021–22 season, which in turn broke an over 70-year-old record set in the 1948–49 season.[237] In October 2024 it was reported that the government is planning to grant the independent regulator authority to stop Premier League clubs from selling their stadiums to affiliated or third-party companies.[238] I have never known this level before. Of course, there are managers in Germany, Italy, and Spain, but in the Premier League, these are the best managers, the elite managers. The quality, the preparation. The level is so high. Managers in the Premier League are involved in the day-to-day running of the team, including the training, team selection and player acquisition. Their influence varies from club-to-club and is related to the ownership of the club and the relationship of the manager with fans.[240] Managers are required to have a UEFA Pro Licence which is the final coaching qualification available, and follows the completion of the UEFA 'B' and 'A' Licences.[241] The UEFA Pro Licence is required by every person who wishes to manage a club in the Premier League on a permanent basis (i.e., more than 12 weeks, the amount of time an unqualified caretaker manager is allowed to take control).[242] Caretaker appointments are managers that fill the gap between a managerial departure and a new appointment. Several caretaker managers have gone on to secure a permanent managerial post after performing well as a caretaker, including Paul Hart at Portsmouth, David Pleat at Tottenham Hotspur and Ole Gunnar Solskjær at Manchester United. Arsène Wenger is the longest-serving manager, having been in charge of Arsenal in the Premier League from 1996 to his departure at the conclusion of the 2017–18 season, and holds the record for most matches managed in the Premier League with 828, all with Arsenal. He broke the record set by Alex Ferguson, who had managed 810 matches with Manchester United from the Premier League's inception to his retirement at the end of the 2012–13 season. Ferguson was in charge of Manchester United from November 1986 until his retirement at the end of the 2012–13 season, meaning he was manager for the last five years of the old Football League First Division and all of the first 21 seasons of the Premier League.[243] Notably, since its creation the Premier League has never been won by an English manager. There have been several studies into the reasoning behind, and effects of, managerial sackings. Most famously, Sue Bridgewater of the University of Liverpool and Bas ter Weel of the University of Amsterdam, performed two separate studies which helped to explain the statistics behind managerial sackings. Bridgewater's study found clubs generally sack their managers upon dropping below an average of one point per match.[244] Player transfers may only take place within transfer windows set by the Football Association. The two transfer windows run from the last day of the season to 31 August and from 31 December to 31 January. Player registrations cannot be exchanged outside these windows except under specific licence from the FA, usually on an emergency basis.[246] As of the 2010–11 season, the Premier League introduced new rules mandating that each club must register a maximum 25-man squad of players aged over 21, with the squad list only allowed to be changed in transfer windows or in exceptional circumstances.[247][248] This was to enable the \"home grown\" rule to be enacted, whereby the Premier League would also from 2010 require at least eight members of the named 25-man squad to be \"home-grown players\".[247] At the inception of the Premier League in 1992–93, just 11 players named in the starting line-ups for the first round of matches hailed from outside of the United Kingdom or Ireland.[249] By 2000–01, the number of foreign players participating in the Premier League was 36% of the total. In the 2004–05 season, the figure had increased to 45%. On 26 December 1999, Chelsea became the first Premier League side to field an entirely foreign starting line-up,[250] and on 14 February 2005, Arsenal were the first to name a completely foreign 16-man squad for a match.[251] By 2009, under 40% of the players in the Premier League were English.[252] By February 2020, 117 different nationalities had played in the Premier League, and 101 nationalities had scored in the competition.[253] In 1999, in response to concerns that clubs were increasingly passing over young English players in favour of foreign players, the Home Office tightened its rules for granting work permits to players from countries outside of the European Union.[254] A non-EU player applying for the permit must have played for his country in at least 75 per cent of its competitive 'A' team matches for which he was available for selection during the previous two years, and his country must have averaged at least 70th place in the official FIFA world rankings over the previous two years. If a player does not meet those criteria, the club wishing to sign him may appeal.[255] Following the implementation of Brexit in January 2021, new regulations were introduced which require all foreign players to obtain a Governing Body Endorsement (GBE) in order to play football in the United Kingdom, regardless of EU status.[256] Italics denotes players still playing professional football,Bold denotes players still playing in the Premier League. The Premier League Golden Boot is awarded each season to the top scorer in the division. Former Blackburn Rovers and Newcastle United striker Alan Shearer holds the record for most Premier League goals with 260.[258] Thirty-three players have reached the 100-goal mark.[259] Since the first Premier League season in 1992–93, 23 players from 11 clubs have won or shared the top scorer title.[260] Thierry Henry won his fourth overall scoring title by scoring 27 goals in the 2005–06 season. Erling Haaland holds the record for most goals in a Premier League season (38 matches) with 36 goals as of 15 May 2023.[261] Ryan Giggs of Manchester United holds the record for scoring goals in consecutive seasons, having scored in the first 21 seasons of the league.[262] Giggs also holds the record for the most Premier League assists, with 162.[263] There is no team or individual salary cap in the Premier League. As a result of the increasingly lucrative television deals, player wages rose sharply following the formation of the Premier League, when the average player wage was £75,000 per year.[264] In the 2018–19 season the average annual salary stood at £2.99 million. The total salary bill for the 20 Premier League clubs in the 2018–19 season was £1.62 billion; this compares to £1.05 billion in La Liga, £0.83 billion in Serie A, £0.72 billion in Bundesliga, and £0.54 billion in Ligue 1. The club with the highest average wage is Manchester United at £6.5 million. This is smaller than the club with the highest wage bill in Spain (Barcelona £10.5 million) and Italy (Juventus £6.7 million), but higher than in Germany (Bayern Munich £6.4 million) and France (Paris Saint-Germain £6.1 million). For the 2018–19 season, the ratio of the wages of the highest-paid team to lowest-paid in the Premier League is 6.82 to 1. This is much lower than in La Liga (19.1 to 1), Serie A (16 to 1), Bundesliga (20.5 to 1), and Ligue 1 (26.6 to 1). Because of the lower differential between team wage bills in the Premier League, it is often regarded as being more competitive than other top European leagues.[265] The record transfer fee for a Premier League player has risen steadily over the lifetime of the competition. Before the start of the first Premier League season, Alan Shearer became the first British player to command a transfer fee of more than £3 million.[266] The record has increased steadily and Enzo Fernández is now the most expensive transfer fee paid by a Premier League club at £106.8 million, whilst Philippe Coutinho is the biggest transfer involving a Premier League club at £105 million. The Premier League maintains two trophies – the genuine trophy (held by the reigning champions) and a spare replica. Two trophies are held for the purpose of making the award within minutes of the title being secured, in the event that on the final day of the season two clubs are still within reach of winning the League.[293] In the rare event that more than two clubs are vying for the title on the final day of the season, a replica won by a previous club is used.[294] The current Premier League trophy was created by Royal Jewellers Garrard & Co/Asprey of London and was designed in house at Garrard & Co by Trevor Brown and Paul Marsden. It consists of a trophy with a golden crown and a malachite plinth base. The plinth weighs 33 pounds (15 kg) and the trophy weighs 22 pounds (10.0 kg).[295] The trophy and plinth are 76 cm (30 in) tall, 43 cm (17 in) wide and 25 cm (9.8 in) deep.[296] Its main body is solid sterling silver and silver gilt, whilst its plinth is made of malachite, a semi-precious stone. The plinth has a silver band around its circumference, upon which the names of the title-winning clubs are listed. The green of the malachite represents the green field of play.[296] The design of the trophy is based on the heraldry of Three Lions that is associated with English football. Two of the lions are found above the handles on either side of the trophy – the third is symbolised by the captain of the title-winning team as he raises the trophy, and its gold crown, above his head at the end of the season.[297] The ribbons that drape the handles are presented in the team colours of the league champions that year. In 2004, a special gold version of the trophy was commissioned to commemorate Arsenal winning the title without a single defeat.[298] In addition to the winner's trophy and the individual winner's medals awarded to players who win the title, the Premier League also issues other awards throughout the season. A man-of-the-match award is awarded to the player who has the greatest impact in an individual match. Monthly awards are also given for the Manager of the Month, Player of the Month and Goal of the Month.[299] These are also issued annually for Manager of the Season,[300] Player of the Season[301] and Goal of the Season. The Young Player of the Season award is given to the most outstanding U-23 player starting from the 2019–20 season.[302] The Golden Boot award is given to the top goalscorer of every season, the Playmaker of the Season award is given to the player who makes the most assists of every season,[141] and the Golden Glove award is given to the goalkeeper with the most clean sheets at the end of the season.[303] Starting with the 2021–22 season, four new awards are given. The Save of the Season is awarded to the goalkeeper deemed to have made the most impressive save.[304] The Game Changer of the Season is earned by the player with the single most game-changing performance over the course of the campaign.[305] The Most Powerful Goal is given to the player whose goal-scoring shot had the highest average velocity from the time it was struck to the time it crossed the goal line, and the Most Improbable Comeback award is meant for the team that, based on calculations performed by Oracle Corporation, goes behind and overcomes a deficit to win their respective match.[306] From the 2017–18 season, players receive a milestone award for 100 appearances and every century there after and also players who score 50 goals and multiples thereof. Each player to reach these milestones is to receive a presentation box from the Premier League containing a special medallion and a plaque commemorating their achievement.[307] In 2012, the Premier League celebrated its second decade by holding the 20 Seasons Awards:[308] Bibliography",

                "content": "The Association of Southeast Asian Nations,[d] commonly abbreviated as ASEAN,[e] is a political and economic union of 10 states in Southeast Asia. Together, its member states represent a population of more than 600 million people and land area of over 4.5 million km2 (1.7 million sq mi).[14] The bloc generated a purchasing power parity (PPP) gross domestic product (GDP) of around US$10.2 trillion in 2022, constituting approximately 6.5% of global GDP (PPP).[10] ASEAN member states include some of the fastest growing economies in the world, and the institution plays an integral role in East Asian regionalism.[15] The primary objectives of ASEAN, as stated by the association, are \"to accelerate economic growth, social progress and cultural development in the region\", and \"to promote regional peace and stability through abiding respect for justice and the rule of law in the relationship among countries in the region and adherence to the principles of the United Nations Charter.\"[16] In recent years, the bloc has broadened its objectives beyond economic and social spheres. ASEAN engages with other supranational entities in the Asia-Pacific region and other parts of the world. It is a major partner of the UN, SCO, PA, GCC, MERCOSUR, CELAC, and ECO.[17] It also hosts diplomatic missions throughout the world, maintaining a global network of relationships that is widely regarded as the central forum for cooperation in the region.[18] Its success has become the driving force of some of the largest trade blocs in history, including APEC and RCEP.[19][20][21][22] The predecessor of ASEAN was the Association of Southeast Asia (ASA), formed on 31 July 1961 and consisting of Thailand, the Philippines, and Malaya.[23][24] ASEAN itself was created on 8 August 1967, when the foreign ministers of five countries—Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore, and Thailand—signed the ASEAN Declaration.[25] According to the Declaration, ASEAN aims to accelerate economic, social, and cultural development in the region, as well as promoting regional peace, to collaborate on matters of shared interest, and to promote Southeast Asian studies and maintain close cooperation with existing international organisations.[26][27] The creation of ASEAN was initially motivated by the desire to contain communism,[28][29] which had taken a foothold in mainland Asia after World War II, with the formation of communist governments in North Korea, China, and Vietnam, accompanied by the so-called communist \"emergency\" in British Malaya, and unrest in the recently decolonized Philippines. These events also encouraged the earlier formation of the South East Asia Treaty Organization (SEATO), led by the United States, United Kingdom, and Australia, with several Southeast Asian partners in 1954 as an extension of \"containment\" policy, seeking to create an Eastern version of NATO.[30] However, the local member states of ASEAN group achieved greater cohesion in the mid-1970s following a change in the balance of power after the Fall of Saigon and the end of the Vietnam War in April 1975 and the decline of SEATO.[31][32] ASEAN's first summit meeting, held in Bali, Indonesia, in 1976, resulted in an agreement on several industrial projects and the signing of a Treaty of Amity and Cooperation, and a Declaration of Concord. The end of the Cold War allowed ASEAN countries to exercise greater political independence in the region, and in the 1990s, ASEAN emerged as a leading voice on regional trade and security issues.[33] On 15 December 1995, the Southeast Asian Nuclear-Weapon-Free Zone Treaty was signed to turn Southeast Asia into a nuclear-weapon-free zone. The treaty took effect on 28 March 1997 after all but one of the member states had ratified it. It became fully effective on 21 June 2001 after the Philippines ratified it, effectively banning all nuclear weapons in the region.[34] On 7 January 1984, Brunei became ASEAN's sixth member[35] and on 28 July 1995, following the end of the Cold War, Vietnam joined as the seventh member.[36] Laos and Myanmar (formerly Burma) joined two years later on 23 July 1997.[37] Cambodia was to join at the same time as Laos and Myanmar, but a Cambodian coup in 1997 and other internal instability delayed its entry.[38] It then joined on 30 April 1999 following the stabilization of its government.[37][39] In 2006, ASEAN was given observer status at the United Nations General Assembly.[40] In response, the organization awarded the status of \"dialogue partner\" to the UN.[41] Besides their close geographic proximity, political scholars consider Southeast Asian nations a cultural crossroads between East Asia and South Asia, located at critical junctions of the South China Sea as well as the Indian Ocean, and as a result received much influence from Islamic and Persian influences prior to the European colonial ages.[42][43] Since around 100 BCE, the Southeast Asian archipelago occupied a central position at the crossroads of the Indian Ocean and the South China Sea trading routes, which stimulated the economy and the influx of ideas.[44] This included the introduction of abugida scripts to Southeast Asia as well as the Chinese script to Vietnam. Besides various indigenous scripts, various abugida Brahmic scripts were widespread in both continental and insular Southeast Asia. Historically, scripts such as Pallava, Kawi (from ancient Tamil script) and Rencong or Surat Ulu were used to write Old Malay, until they were replaced by Jawi during Islamic missionary missions in the Malay Archipelago.[45] European colonialism influenced most ASEAN countries, including French Indochina (present-day Vietnam, Laos & Cambodia), British Burma, Malaya and Borneo (present-day Myanmar, Malaysia & Singapore, and Brunei), Dutch East Indies (present day Indonesia), Spanish East Indies (present-day Philippines and various other colonies), and Portuguese Timor (present-day Timor-Leste), with only Thailand (then Siam) not formed from a prior European colony.[46] Siam served as a convenient buffer state, sandwiched between British Burma and French Indochina, but its kings had to contend with unequal treaties as well as British and French political interference and territorial losses after the Franco-Siamese conflict of 1893 and the Anglo-Siamese Treaty of 1909.[47] Under European colonization, Southeast Asian nations were introduced to European religions and technologies, as well as the Latin alphabet. The Japanese Empire, in the vein of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere concept, sought to unite and create a pan-Asian identity against Western colonial occupation, but Japan's alliance with the Axis powers in World War II soured relations between many colonies of Europe and the United States.[citation needed] Defeat of Imperial Japan eventuated in decolonization movements throughout Southeast Asia, resulting in the independent ASEAN states of today. On 15 December 2008, the member states met in Jakarta to launch the charter signed in November 2007, to move closer to \"an EU-style community\".[48] The charter formally established ASEAN as a legal entity, aiming to create a single trade bloc for a region encompassing 500 million people. Indonesian president Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono stated: \"This is a momentous development when ASEAN is consolidating, integrating, and transforming itself into a community. It is achieved while ASEAN seeks a more vigorous role in Asian and global affairs at a time when the international system is experiencing a seismic shift\". Referring to climate change and economic upheaval, he concluded: \"Southeast Asia is no longer the bitterly divided, war-torn region it was in the 1960s and 1970s\". The financial crisis of 2007–2008 was seen as a threat to the charter's goals,[49] and also set forth the idea of a proposed human rights body to be discussed at a future summit in February 2009. This proposition caused controversy, as the body would not have the power to impose sanctions or punish countries which violated citizens' rights and would, therefore, be limited in effectiveness.[50] The body was established later in 2009 as the ASEAN Intergovernmental Commission on Human Rights (AICHR). In November 2012, the commission adopted the ASEAN Human Rights Declaration.[51] However, their human rights declaration has been critiqued widely by the international community, with the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights stating that the declaration was worded in problematic ways that do not easily align with international norms. Likewise, the Human Rights Watch in the United States noted several important fundamental rights were omitted or not clearly established.[52] The chairmanship of ASEAN rotates among the member states. Malaysia holds the position for 2025. Recent ASEAN chairs are as follows:[53] In response to pandemics, ASEAN has coordinated with ASEAN+3 and other actors to create a regional public health response.[54] During the SARS outbreak, ASEAN and ASEAN+3 worked together to devise a response to the outbreak. Immediate and short-to-medium term measures were devised. The parties agreed to enhance sharing of best practices against the disease while also agreeing to bolster collaboration between their respective health authorities and harmonize travel procedures to ensure that proper health screening would occur. In addition, China offered to contribute $1.2 million to the ASEAN SARS fund, made both to show that it was willing to cooperate with the rest of the region and make amends for its withholding of information during the initial stages of the outbreak.[55] ASEAN held a special meeting between ASEAN and ASEAN+3 health ministers on 8 May 2009, on responding to the H1N1 pandemic.[56] At this meeting, it was agreed that hotlines would be established between public health authorities, joint response teams would be formed, and ongoing research efforts would be bolstered. Since 2017, political, military and ethnic affairs in Myanmar have posed unusual challenges for ASEAN, creating precedent-breaking situations and threatening the traditions and unity of the group, and its global standing[57][58][59][60][61]—with ASEAN responses indicating possible fundamental change in the nature of the organization.[62][63][64][65][66] The Rohingya genocide erupting in Myanmar in August 2017—killing thousands of Rohingya people in Myanmar,[67][68][69] driving most into neighboring Bangladesh, and continuing for months[70][71][72][73]—created a global outcry demanding ASEAN take action against the civilian-military coalition government of Myanmar, which had long discriminated against the Rohingya, and had launched the 2017 attacks upon them.[62][74][75][76][77] On 1 February 2021, the day before a newly elected slate of civilian leaders was to take office in Myanmar, a military junta overthrew Myanmar's civilian government in a coup d'etat, declaring a national state of emergency, imposing martial law, arresting elected civilian leaders, violently clamping down on dissent, and replacing civilian government with the military's appointees.[78][79][80][81] Widespread protests and resistance erupted, and elements of the civilian leadership formed an underground \"National Unity Government\" (NUG). Global opposition to the coup emerged, and global pressure was brought on ASEAN to take action.[82][83][81][84][85] There are currently two states seeking accession to ASEAN: East Timor[87] and Papua New Guinea.[88][89] As of 1 July 2019[update], the population of the ASEAN was about 655 million people (8.5% of the world population).[91][92][needs update] In ASEAN in 2019, 55.2 million children were age 0–4 and 46.3 million people were older than 65. This corresponds to 8.4% and 7.1% of the total ASEAN population. The region's population growth is 1.1% per year. Thailand is the lowest at 0.2% per year, and Cambodia is the highest at 1.9% per year. ASEAN's sex ratio is 0.996 males per female, with 326.4 million males and 327.8 million females.[citation needed] The 20 largest metropolitan areas within ASEAN are as follows. The \"ASEAN Way\" refers to a methodology or approach to solving issues that respect Southeast Asia's cultural norms. Masilamani and Peterson summarise it as \"a working process or style that is informal and personal. Policymakers constantly utilise compromise, consensus, and consultation in the informal decision-making process... it above all prioritises a consensus-based, non-conflictual way of addressing problems. Quiet diplomacy allows ASEAN leaders to communicate without bringing the discussions into the public view. Members avoid the embarrassment that may lead to further conflict.\"[102] It has been said that the merits of the ASEAN Way might \"be usefully applied to global conflict management\". However, critics have argued that such an approach can be only applied to Asian countries, to specific cultural norms and understandings notably, due to a difference in mindset and level of tension.[103]: pp113-118 Critics object, claiming that the ASEAN Way's emphasis on consultation, consensus, and non-interference forces the organization to adopt only those policies which satisfy the lowest common denominator. Decision-making by consensus requires members to see eye-to-eye before ASEAN can move forward on an issue. Members may not have a common conception of the meaning of the ASEAN Way. Myanmar, Cambodia, and Laos emphasize non-interference while older member countries focus on co-operation and co-ordination. These differences hinder efforts to find common solutions to particular issues, but also make it difficult to determine when collective action is appropriate in a given situation.[104]: 161–163 Beginning in 1997, heads of each member state adopted the ASEAN Vision 2020 during the group's 30th anniversary meeting held in Kuala Lumpur. As a means for the realization of a single ASEAN community, this vision provides provisions on peace and stability, a nuclear-free region, closer economic integration, human development, sustainable development, cultural heritage, being a drug-free region, environment among others. The vision also aimed to \"see an outward-looking ASEAN playing a pivotal role in the international fora, and advancing ASEAN's common interests\".[105][106] ASEAN Vision 2020 was formalized and made comprehensive through the Bali Concord II in 2003. Three major pillars of a single ASEAN community were established: Political-Security Community (APSC), Economic Community (AEC) and Socio-Cultural Community (ASCC).[107][108][109][110][111] To fully embody the three pillars as part of the 2015 integration, blueprints for APSC and ASCC were subsequently adopted in 2009 in Cha-am, Thailand.[112] The ASEAN Community, initially planned to commence by 2020, was accelerated to begin by 31 December 2015.[113] It was decided during the 12th ASEAN Summit in Cebu in 2007.[114] The AEC aims to \"implement economic integration initiatives\" to create a single market for member states.[115][116] The blueprint that serves as a comprehensive guide for the establishment of the community was adopted on 20 November 2007 at the 13th ASEAN Summit in Singapore.[115][117] Its characteristics include a single market and production base, a highly competitive economic region, a region of fair economic development, and a region fully integrated into the global economy. The areas of cooperation include human resources development, recognition of professional qualifications, closer consultation economic policies, enhanced infrastructure and communications connectivity, integrating industries for regional sourcing, and strengthening private sector involvement. Through the free movement of skilled labor, goods, services and investment, ASEAN would rise globally as one market, thus increasing its competitiveness and opportunities for development.[118] During the 14th ASEAN Summit, the group adopted the APSC Blueprint.[119] This document is aimed at creating a robust political-security environment within ASEAN, with programs and activities outlined to establish the APSC by 2016. It is based on the ASEAN Charter, the ASEAN Security Community Plan of Action, and the Vientiane Action Program. The APSC aims to create a sense of responsibility toward comprehensive security and a dynamic, outward-looking region in an increasingly integrated and interdependent world. The ASEAN Defense Industry Collaboration (ADIC) was proposed at the 4th ASEAN Defense Ministers' Meeting (ADMM) on 11 May 2010 in Hanoi.[120] It has the purpose, among others, to reduce defense imports from non-ASEAN countries by half and to further develop the defense industry in the region.[121] It was formally adopted on the next ADMM on 19 May 2011, in Jakarta, Indonesia.[122] The main focus is to industrially and technologically boost the security capability of ASEAN,[123][124] consistent with the principles of flexibility and non-binding and voluntary participation among the member states.[125][126] The concept revolves around education and capability-building programs to develop the skills and capabilities of the workforce, production of capital for defense products, and the provision of numerous services to address the security needs of each member state. It also aims to develop an intra-ASEAN defense trade.[120] ADIC aims to establish a strong defense industry relying on the local capabilities of each member state and limit annual procurement from external original equipment manufacturers (OEMs).[120] Countries like the US, Germany, Russia, France, Italy, UK, China, South Korea, Israel, and the Netherlands are among the major suppliers to ASEAN.[127] ASEAN defense budget rose by 147% from 2004 to 2013 and is expected to rise further in the future.[128] Factors affecting the increase include economic growth, ageing equipment, and the plan to strengthen the establishment of the defense industry.[129] ASEANAPOL is also established to enhance cooperation on law enforcement and crime control among police forces of member states.[130] The ASEAN Socio-Cultural Community (ASCC) was also adopted during the 14th ASEAN Summit.[131] It envisions an \"ASEAN Community that is people-centered and socially responsible with a view to achieving enduring solidarity and unity among the countries and peoples of ASEAN by forging a common identity and building a caring and sharing society which is inclusive and harmonious where the well-being, livelihood, and welfare of the peoples are enhanced\". Among its focus areas include human development, social welfare and protection, social justice and rights, environmental sustainability, building the ASEAN identity, and narrowing the development gap. To track the progress of the AEC, a compliance tool called the AEC Scorecard was developed based on the EU Internal Market Scorecard.[132] It is the only one in effect[133] and is expected to serve as an unbiased assessment tool to measure the extent of integration and the economic health of the region. It is expected to provide relevant information about regional priorities, and thus foster productive, inclusive, and sustainable growth.[134] It makes it possible to monitor the implementation of ASEAN agreements, and the achievement of milestones indicated in the AEC Strategic Schedule. The scorecard outlines specific actions that must be undertaken collectively and individually to establish AEC by 2015.[134] To date, two official scorecards have been published, one in 2010,[135] and the other in 2012.[136][132] However, the scorecard is purely quantitative, as it only examines whether a member state has performed the AEC task or not. The more \"yes\" answers, the higher the score.[133] Part of the work towards the ASEAN Economic Community is the integration of the energy systems of the ASEAN member states. The blueprint for this integration is provided by the ASEAN Plan of Action for Energy Cooperation (APAEC).[137] APAEC is managed by the ASEAN Center for Energy. As trade is liberalized with the integration in 2015, the need arises for ASEAN banking institutions to accommodate and expand their services to an intra-ASEAN market. Experts, however, have already forecast a shaky economic transition, especially for smaller players in the banking and financial services industry. Two separate reports by Standard & Poor's (S&P) outline the challenges that ASEAN financial institutions face as they prepare for the 2020 banking integration.[f] The reports point out that overcrowded banking sector in the Philippines is expected to feel the most pressure as the integration welcomes tighter competition with bigger and more established foreign banks.[138] As a result, there needs to be a regional expansion by countries with a small banking sector to lessen the impact of the post-integration environment. In a follow-up report, S&P recently cited the Philippines for \"shoring up its network bases and building up capital ahead of the banking integration – playing defense and strengthening their domestic networks\".[138] The roadmap for financial integration is the latest regional initiative that aims to strengthen local self-help and support mechanisms. The roadmap's implementation would contribute to the realization of the AEC. Adoption of a common currency, when conditions are ripe, could be the final stage of the AEC. The roadmap identifies approaches and milestones in capital market development, capital account and financial services liberalization, and ASEAN currency cooperation. Capital market development entails promoting institutional capacity as well as the facilitation of greater cross-border collaboration, linkages, and harmonization between capital markets. Orderly capital account liberalization would be promoted with adequate safeguards against volatility and systemic risks. To expedite the process of financial services liberalization, ASEAN has agreed on a positive list modality and adopted milestones to facilitate negotiations. Currency cooperation would involve the exploration of possible currency arrangements, including an ASEAN currency payment system for trade in local goods to reduce the demand for US dollars and to help promote stability of regional currencies, such as by settling intra-ASEAN trade using regional currencies.[139] Member states recognize the importance of strengthening food security to maintain stability and prosperity in the region.[140] As ASEAN moves towards AEC and beyond, food security would be an integral part of the community-building agenda.[141] Strengthened food security is even more relevant in light of potentially severe risks from climate change with agriculture and fisheries being the most affected industries.[142] Part of the aim of ASEAN integration is to achieve food security collectively via trade in rice and maize. Trade facilitation measures and the harmonization/equivalency of food regulation and control standards would reduce the cost of trade in food products. While specialization and revealed comparative and competitive indices point to complementarities between trade patterns among the member states, intra-ASEAN trade in agriculture is quite small, something that integration could address.[143] The MARKET project would provide flexible and demand-driven support to the ASEAN Secretariat while bringing more private-sector and civil-society input into regional agriculture policy dialogue. By building an environment that reduces barriers to trade, ASEAN trade would increase, thereby decreasing the risk of food price crisis.[144] The group sought economic integration by creating the AEC by the end of 2015 that established a single market.[146] The average economic growth of member states from 1989 to 2009 was between 3.8% and 7%. This was greater than the average growth of APEC, which was 2.8%.[147] The ASEAN Free Trade Area (AFTA), established on 28 January 1992,[148] includes a Common Effective Preferential Tariff (CEPT) to promote the free flow of goods between member states.[146] ASEAN had only six members when it was signed. The new member states (Vietnam, Laos, Myanmar, and Cambodia) have not fully met AFTA's obligations, but are officially considered part of the agreement as they were required to sign it upon entry into ASEAN, and were given longer time frames to meet AFTA's tariff reduction obligations.[149] The next steps are to create a single market and production base, a competitive economic region, a region of equitable economic development, and a region that is fully integrated into the global economy. Since 2007, ASEAN countries have gradually lowered their import duties to member states, with a target of zero import duties by 2016.[150] ASEAN countries have many economic zones (industrial parks, eco-industrial parks, special economic zones, technology parks, and innovation districts) (see reference for comprehensive list from 2015).[151] In 2018, eight of the ASEAN members are among the world's outperforming economies, with positive long-term prospect for the region.[152] ASEAN's Secretariat projects that the regional body will grow to become the world's fourth largest economy by 2030.[153] The ASEAN Centre for Energy publishes the ASEAN Energy Outlook every five years, analysing and promoting the integration of national energy systems across the region. The sixth edition was published in 2020.[154] ASEAN planned to establish a single market based upon the four freedoms by the end of 2015, with the goal of ensuring free flow of goods, services, skilled labour, and capital. The ASEAN Economic Community was formed in 2015,[155] but the group deferred about 20% of the harmonization provisions needed to create a common market and set a new deadline of 2025.[156] Until the end of 2010, intra-ASEAN trade was still low as trade involved mainly exports to countries outside the region, with the exception of Laos and Myanmar, whose foreign trade was ASEAN-oriented.[157] In 2009, realised foreign direct investment (FDI) was US$37.9 billion and increased two-fold in 2010 to US$75.8 billion. 22% of FDI came from the European Union, followed by ASEAN countries (16%), and by Japan and the United States. The ASEAN Framework Agreement on Trade in Services (AFAS) was adopted at the ASEAN Summit in Bangkok in December 1995.[158] Under the agreement, member states enter into successive rounds of negotiations to liberalise trade in services with the aim of submitting increasingly higher levels of commitment. ASEAN has concluded seven packages of commitments under AFAS.[159] Mutual Recognition Agreements (MRAs) have been agreed upon by ASEAN for eight professions: physicians, dentists, nurses, architects, engineers, accountants, surveyors, and tourism professionals. Individuals in these professions will be free to work in any ASEAN states effective 31 December 2015.[160][161][162] In addition, six member states (Malaysia, Vietnam (2 exchanges), Indonesia, Philippines, Thailand, and Singapore) have collaborated on integrating their stock exchanges, which includes 70% of its transaction values with the goal to compete with international exchanges.[163] Single market will also include the ASEAN Single Aviation Market (ASEAN-SAM), the region's aviation policy geared towards the development of a unified and single aviation market in Southeast Asia. It was proposed by the ASEAN Air Transport Working Group, supported by the ASEAN Senior Transport Officials Meeting, and endorsed by the ASEAN Transport Ministers.[164] It is expected to liberalise air travel between member states allowing ASEAN airlines to benefit directly from the growth in air travel, and also free up tourism, trade, investment, and service flows.[164][165] Since 1 December 2008, restrictions on the third and fourth freedoms of the air between capital cities of member states for air passenger services have been removed,[166] while from 1 January 2009, full liberalisation of air freight services in the region took effect.[164][165] On 1 January 2011, full liberalisation on fifth freedom traffic rights between all capital cities took effect.[167] This policy supersedes existing unilateral, bilateral, and multilateral air services agreements among member states which are inconsistent with its provisions. The concept of an Asian Currency Unit (ACU) started in the middle of the 1990s, prior to the 1997 Asian financial crisis.[168] It is a proposed basket of Asian currencies, similar to the European Currency Unit, which was the precursor of the Euro. The Asian Development Bank is responsible for exploring the feasibility and construction of the basket.[168][169] Since the ACU is being considered to be a precursor to a common currency, it has a dynamic outlook of the region.[clarification needed][170] The overall goal of a common currency is to contribute to the financial stability of a regional economy, including price stability. It means lower cost of cross-border business through the elimination of currency risk. Greater flows of intra-trade would put pressure on prices, resulting in cheaper goods and services. Individuals benefit not only from the lowering of prices, they save by not having to change money when travelling, by being able to compare prices more readily, and by the reduced cost of transferring money across borders. However, there are conditions for a common currency: the intensity of intra-regional trade and the convergence of macroeconomic conditions. Substantial intra-ASEAN trade (which is growing, partly as a result of the ASEAN Free Trade Area (AFTA) and the ASEAN Economic Community.) and economic integration is an incentive for a monetary union. Member states currently trade more with other countries (80%) than among themselves (20%). Therefore, their economies are more concerned about currency stability against major international currencies, like the US dollar. On macroeconomic conditions, member states have different levels of economic development, capacity, and priorities that translate into different levels of interest and readiness. Monetary integration, however, implies less control over national monetary and fiscal policy to stimulate the economy. Therefore, greater convergence in macroeconomic conditions is being enacted to improve conditions and confidence in a common currency.[139] Other concerns include weaknesses in the financial sectors, inadequacy of regional-level resource pooling mechanisms and institutions required to form and manage a currency union, and lack of political preconditions for monetary co-operation and a common currency.[171] In 1992, the Common Effective Preferential Tariff (CEPT) scheme was adopted as a schedule for phasing out tariffs to increase the \"region's competitive advantage as a production base geared for the world market\". This law would act as the framework for the ASEAN Free Trade Area (AFTA), which is an agreement by member states concerning local manufacturing in ASEAN. It was signed on 28 January 1992 in Singapore.[148] Free trade initiatives in ASEAN are spearheaded by the implementation of the ASEAN Trade in Goods Agreement (ATIGA) and the Agreement on Customs. These agreements are supported by several sector bodies to plan and to execute free trade measures, guided by the provisions and the requirements of ATIGA and the Agreement on Customs. They form a backbone for achieving targets of the AEC Blueprint and establishing the ASEAN Economic Community by the end of 2015.[172] On 26 August 2007, ASEAN stated its aim of completing free trade agreements (FTA) with China, Japan, South Korea, India, Australia, and New Zealand by 2013, which is in line with the start of the ASEAN Economic Community by 2015.[173][174] In November 2007, ASEAN states signed the ASEAN Charter, a constitution governing relations among member states and establishing the group itself as an international legal entity.[175] During the same year, the Cebu Declaration on East Asian Energy Security was signed by ASEAN and the other members of the EAS (Australia, China, India, Japan, New Zealand, South Korea), which pursues energy security by finding energy alternatives to fossil fuels.[176] On 27 February 2009, an FTA with Australia and New Zealand was signed. It is believed that this FTA would boost combined GDP across the 12 countries by more than US$48 billion over the period between 2000 and 2020.[177][178] The agreement with China created the ASEAN–China Free Trade Area (ACFTA), which went into full effect on 1 January 2010. In addition, ASEAN was noted to be negotiating an FTA with the European Union.[179] Bilateral trade with India crossed the US$70 billion target in 2012 (target was to reach the level by 2015).[180] Taiwan has also expressed interest in an agreement with ASEAN but needs to overcome diplomatic objections from China.[181] ASEAN, together with its six major trading partners (Australia, China, India, Japan, New Zealand, South Korea), began the first round of negotiations on 26–28 February 2013, in Bali, Indonesia on the establishment of the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP),[182] which is an extension of ASEAN Plus Three and Six that covers 45% of the world's population and about a third of the world's total GDP.[183][184][185] In 2019, Reuters highlighted a mechanism used by traders to avoid the 70% tariff on ethanol imported into China from the United States, involving importing the fuel into Malaysia, mixing it with at least 40% ASEAN-produced fuel, and re-exporting it to China tariff-free under ACFTA rules.[186] Cross-border electricity trade in ASEAN has been limited, despite efforts since 1997 to establish an ASEAN Power Grid and associated trade. Electricity trade accounts for only about 5% of the generation, whereas trades in coal and gas are 86% and 53% respectively.[187][188] With the institutionalisation of visa-free travel between ASEAN member states, intra-ASEAN travel has escalated. In 2010, 47% or 34 million out of 73 million tourists in ASEAN member-states were from other ASEAN countries.[189] Cooperation in tourism was formalised in 1976, following the formation of the Sub-Committee on Tourism (SCOT) under the ASEAN Committee on Trade and Tourism. The 1st ASEAN Tourism Forum was held on 18–26 October 1981 in Kuala Lumpur. In 1986, ASEAN Promotional Chapters for Tourism (APCT) were established in Hong Kong, West Germany, the United Kingdom, Australia/New Zealand, Japan, and North America.[190] Tourism has been one of the key growth sectors in ASEAN and has proven resilient amid global economic challenges. The wide array of tourist attractions across the region drew 109 million tourists to ASEAN in 2015, up by 34% compared to 81 million tourists in 2011. As of 2012, tourism was estimated to account for 4.6% of ASEAN GDP—10.9% when taking into account all indirect contributions. It directly employed 9.3 million people, or 3.2% of total employment, and indirectly supported some 25 million jobs.[191][192] In addition, the sector accounted for an estimated 8% of total capital investment in the region.[193] In January 2012, ASEAN tourism ministers called for the development of a marketing strategy. The strategy represents the consensus of ASEAN National Tourism Organisations (NTOs) on marketing directions for ASEAN moving forward to 2015.[194] In the 2013 Travel and Tourism Competitiveness Index (TTCI) report, Singapore placed 1st, Malaysia placed 8th, Thailand placed 9th, Indonesia placed 12th, Brunei placed 13th, Vietnam placed 16th, Philippines placed 17th, and Cambodia placed 20th as the top destinations of travellers in the Asia Pacific region.[195] 1981 The ASEAN Tourism Forum (ATF) was established. It is a regional meeting of NGOs, Ministers, sellers, buyers and journalists to promote the ASEAN countries as a single one tourist destination. The annual event 2019 in Ha Long marks the 38th anniversary and involves all the tourism industry sectors of the 10 member states of ASEAN: Brunei Darussalam, Cambodia, Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia, Myanmar, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam. It was organized by TTG Events from Singapore. The establishment of the China-ASEAN Investment Cooperation Fund was announced in 2009 by Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao began operations in 2010.[196] The fund, which is sponsored by the Export-Import Bank of China, among other institutional investors, became the first Southeast Asia-focused private equity fund approved by China's State Council and the National Development and Reform Commission.[197] The Export-Import Bank of China is the \"anchor sponsor\" with a \"seed investment\" of US$300 million.[198] Three other Chinese institutions invested a combined US$500 million.[198] The International Finance Corporation of the World Bank invested US$100 million.[198] In November 2011, the China-ASEAN Maritime Cooperation fund was established.[199]: 160 China underwrote the fund, which is valued at RMB 3 billion.[199]: 160 ASEAN maintains a global network of alliances, dialogue partners and diplomatic missions, and is involved in numerous international affairs.[200][201][202][203] The organisation maintains good relationships on an international scale, particularly towards Asia-Pacific nations, and upholds itself as a neutral party in politics. It holds ASEAN Summits, where heads of government of each member states meet to discuss and resolve regional issues, as well as to conduct other meetings with countries outside the bloc to promote external relations and deal with international affairs. The first summit was held in Bali in 1976. The third summit was in Manila in 1987, and during this meeting, it was decided that the leaders would meet every five years.[204] The fourth meeting was held in Singapore in 1992 where the leaders decided to meet more frequently, every three years.[204] In 2001, it was decided that the organisation will meet annually to address urgent issues affecting the region. In December 2008, the ASEAN Charter came into force and with it, the ASEAN Summit will be held twice a year. The formal summit meets for three days, and usually includes internal organisation meeting, a conference with foreign ministers of the ASEAN Regional Forum, an ASEAN Plus Three meeting and ASEAN-CER, a meeting of member states with Australia and New Zealand.[205] ASEAN is a major partner of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation, developing cooperation model with the organisation in the field of security, economy, finance, tourism, culture, environmental protection, development and sustainability.[206][207][208][209] Additionally, the grouping has been closely aligned with China, cooperating across numerous areas, including economy, security, education, culture, technology, agriculture, human resource, society, development, investment, energy, transport, public health, tourism, media, environment, and sustainability.[210][211][212] It is also the linchpin in the foreign policy of Australia and New Zealand, with the three sides being integrated into an essential alliance.[213][214][215][216] ASEAN also participates in the East Asia Summit (EAS), a pan-Asian forum held annually by the leaders of eighteen countries in the East Asian region, with ASEAN in a leadership position. Initially, membership included all member states of ASEAN plus China, Japan, South Korea, India, Australia, and New Zealand, but was expanded to include the United States and Russia at the Sixth EAS in 2011, as they were also important players having dominance and influence over the region. The first summit was held in Kuala Lumpur on 14 December 2005, and subsequent meetings have been held after the annual ASEAN Leaders' Meeting. The summit has discussed issues including trade, energy, and security and the summit has a role in regional community building. Other meetings include the ASEAN Ministerial Meeting[217][218] that focus mostly on specific topics, such as defence or the environment,[219] and are attended by ministers. The ASEAN Regional Forum (ARF), which met for the first time in 1994, fosters dialogue and consultation, and to promote confidence-building and preventive diplomacy in the region.[220] As of July 2007, it consists of twenty-seven participants that include all ASEAN member states, Australia, Bangladesh, Canada, China, the EU, India, Japan, North and South Korea, Mongolia, New Zealand, Pakistan, Papua New Guinea, Russia, East Timor, the United States, and Sri Lanka.[221] Taiwan has been excluded since the establishment of the ARF, and issues regarding the Taiwan Strait are neither discussed at ARF meetings nor stated in the ARF Chairman's Statements. ASEAN also holds meetings with Europe during the Asia–Europe Meeting (ASEM), an informal dialogue process initiated in 1996 with the intention of strengthening co-operation between the countries of Europe and Asia, especially members of the European Union and ASEAN in particular.[222] ASEAN, represented by its secretariat, is one of the forty-five ASEM partners. It also appoints a representative to sit on the governing board of Asia-Europe Foundation (ASEF), a socio-cultural organisation associated with the meeting. Annual bilateral meetings between ASEAN and India, Russia and the United States are also held. Prior to 2012, ASEAN foreign ministerial statements were not typically contentious.[199]: 90 Particularly as international disagreements over the South China Sea increased, the wording of ASEAN foreign ministerial statements became more politically contended.[199]: 90–91 Following the 2022 visit by United States Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi to Taiwan, ASEAN and individual member states reiterated their support of the One China policy.[199]: 89 On 12 November 2022, Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba urged ASEAN countries to abandon their neutrality and condemn Russia's invasion of Ukraine.[223] With perceptions that there have been multiple incursions into the South China Sea by the PRC (China) and ROC (Taiwan), with land, islands and resources all having had previous overlapping claims between Vietnam, Philippines, Malaysia, Brunei, Indonesia, and various other countries, the PRC and ROC's claim into the region is seen as intrusive by many Southeast Asian countries as of 2022, potentially a reflection of the threat of Chinese expansionism into the region.[224][225][226] Shortly after the conclusion of the South China Sea Arbitration, at the 24 July 2016 China-ASEAN Foreign Ministers summit, China assured ASEAN that it would not conduct land reclamation on the Scarborough Shoal.[227]: 129 The joint statement at the conclusion of the summit emphasized the implementation of the Declaration on the Conduct of Parties in the South China Sea and urged the parties to refrain from inhabiting currently unoccupied islands, reefs, shoals, cays, and other features.[227]: 129 Within ASEAN, Cambodia is often supportive of the PRC's positions, including on the South China Sea issue.[228]: 211 There have been territorial disputes between ASEAN member states such as the Cambodian–Thai border dispute between Cambodia and Thailand, Cambodian–Vietnamese border dispute between Cambodia and Vietnam,[229] and the North Borneo dispute between the Philippines and Malaysia.[230][231][232][233] The Vietnamese invasion of Cambodia in 1978, backed by the Soviet Union, was not accepted by ASEAN. They rejected it as a violation of the principles of regional integration. ASEAN cooperated with US and Australia to oppose Vietnam's move and it sponsored a Cambodian resolution in the United Nations General Assembly. ASEAN played a major role starting in 1980 in the peace process, leading to the 1991 Paris Agreement. In 1990, Malaysia proposed the creation of an East Asia Economic Caucus[234] composed of the members of ASEAN, China, Japan, and South Korea. It intended to counterbalance the growing US influence in Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) and Asia as a whole.[235][236] However, the proposal failed because of strong opposition from the US and Japan.[235][237] Work for further integration continued, and the ASEAN Plus Three,[238] consisting of ASEAN, China, Japan, and South Korea, was created in 1997. ASEAN Plus Three[238] is a forum that functions as a coordinator of co-operation between the ASEAN and the three East Asian nations of China, South Korea, and Japan. Government leaders, ministers, and senior officials from the ten members of the ASEAN and the three East Asian states consult on an increasing range of issues.[239] The ASEAN Plus Three is the latest development of Southeast Asia-East Asia regional co-operation. In the past, proposals, such as South Korea's call for an Asian Common Market in 1970 and Japan's 1988 suggestion for an Asian Network, have been made to bring closer regional co-operation.[240] The first leaders' meetings were held in 1996, and 1997 to deal with Asia–Europe Meeting issues, and China and Japan each wanted regular summit meetings with ASEAN members afterwards. The group's significance and importance were strengthened by the Asian Financial Crisis. In response to the crisis, ASEAN closely cooperated with China, South Korea, and Japan. Since the implementation of the Joint Statement on East Asia Cooperation in 1999 at the Manila Summit, ASEAN Plus Three finance ministers have been holding periodic consultations.[241] ASEAN Plus Three, in establishing the Chiang Mai Initiative, has been credited as forming the basis for financial stability in Asia,[242] the lack of such stability having contributed to the Asian Financial Crisis. Since the process began in 1997, ASEAN Plus Three has also focused on subjects other than finance such as the areas of food and energy security, financial co-operation, trade facilitation, disaster management, people-to-people contacts, narrowing the development gap, rural development, and poverty alleviation, human trafficking, labour movement, communicable diseases, environment and sustainable development, and transnational crime, including counter-terrorism. With the aim of further strengthening the nations' co-operation, East Asia Vision Group (EAVG) II was established at the 13th ASEAN Plus Three Summit on 29 October 2010 in Hanoi to stock-take, review, and identify the future direction of the co-operation. The ASEAN Plus Three framework also serves as a platform for the ASEAN affiliated intergovernmental organizations in China, Korea, and Japan to meet and cooperate. The ASEAN-China Centre, the ASEAN-Japan Centre, and ASEAN-Korea Centre currently convene annually to discuss ongoing projects and to discuss possible areas of cooperation vis-a-vis ASEAN.[243] ASEAN Plus Three was the first of attempts for further integration to improve existing ties of Southeast Asia with East Asian countries of China, Japan and South Korea. This was followed by the even larger East Asia Summit (EAS), which included ASEAN Plus Three as well as India, Australia, and New Zealand. This group acted as a prerequisite for the planned East Asia Community which was supposedly patterned after the European Community (now transformed into the European Union). The ASEAN Eminent Persons Group was created to study this policy's possible successes and failures. The group became ASEAN Plus Six with Australia, New Zealand, and India, and stands as the linchpin of Asia Pacific's economic, political, security, socio-cultural architecture, as well as the global economy.[244][245][246][247] Codification of the relations between these countries has seen progress through the development of the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership, a free-trade agreement involving the 15 countries of ASEAN Plus Six (excluding India). RCEP would, in part, allow the members to protect local sectors and give more time to comply with the aim for developed country members.[248] India temporarily does not join the RCEP for the protection of its own market, but Japan, China, and ASEAN welcomes India's participation.[249] Taiwan has been excluded from participating with the organization owing to China's influence on the Asia Pacific through its economic and diplomatic influence.[250] At the turn of the 21st century, ASEAN began to discuss environmental agreements. These included the signing of the ASEAN Agreement on Transboundary Haze Pollution in 2002 as an attempt to control haze pollution in Southeast Asia, arguably the region's most high-profile environmental issue.[251] Unfortunately, this was unsuccessful due to the outbreaks of haze in 2005, 2006, 2009, 2013, and 2015. As of 2015, thirteen years after signing the ASEAN Agreement on Transboundary Haze Pollution, the situation with respect to the long term issue of Southeast Asian haze had not changed for 50% of the ASEAN member states, and still remained as a crisis every two years during summer and fall.[252][253][254] Trash dumping from foreign countries (such as Japan and Canada) to ASEAN has yet to be discussed and resolved.[255] Important issues include deforestation (with Indonesia recorded the largest loss of forest in the region, more than other member states combined in the 2001–2013 period[256]), plastic waste dumping (5 member states were among the top 10 out of 192 countries based on 2010 data, with Indonesia ranked as second worst polluter[257]), threatened mammal species (Indonesia ranked the worst in the region with 184 species under threat[258]), threatened fish species (Indonesia ranked the worst in the region[259]), threatened (higher) plant species (Malaysia ranked the worst in the region[260]). ASEAN's aggregate economy is one of the fastest growing in the world. It is expected to grow by 4.6% in 2019, and 4.8% in 2020, but at the cost of the release about 1.5 billion tonnes of CO2 to the atmosphere every year. That makes ASEAN a greater source of greenhouse gas emissions than Japan (1.3 billion tonnes per year) or Germany (796 million tonnes per year). It is the only region in the world where coal is expected to increase its share of the energy mix.[137] According to the International Energy Agency (IEA), \"Since 2000 [ASEAN's] overall energy demand has grown by more than 80% and the lion's share of this growth has been met by a doubling in fossil fuel use,... Oil is the largest element in the regional energy mix and coal, largely for power generation, has been the fastest growing.\"[153] ASEAN has been criticized for not doing enough to mitigate climate change although it is the world's most vulnerable region in terms of climate impact.[137] ASEAN has many opportunities for renewable energy.[261][262] With solar and wind power plus off river pumped hydro storage, ASEAN electricity industry could achieve very high penetration (78%–97%) of domestic solar and wind energy resources at a competitive levelised costs of electricity range from 55 to 115 U.S. dollars per megawatt-hour based on 2020 technology costs.[261] Vietnam's experience in solar and wind power development provides relevant implications for the other ASEAN countries.[262] The proposed ASEAN Power Grid could allow for renewable energy transmission from large producers like Vietnam to others within ASEAN. The ASEAN has initiated its transition to cleaner energy sources. This transition is characterized as Demanding, Doable, and Dependent.[263] With approximately 679 million inhabitants, the region is witnessing a substantial surge in energy demand, projected to triple by 2050. However, transitioning energy sources requires significant resources. Southeast Asia would need to invest US$27 billion annually in renewable energy to achieve the target of 23% renewables in the primary energy supply by 2025. Nevertheless, this goal is attainable with the implementation of appropriate policies.[263] Vietnam serves as a compelling example of rapid adoption of solar and wind energy.[264] Since 2019, Vietnam has emerged as a regional leader, with solar and wind energy accounting for 13% of its electricity mix in 2022, a remarkable increase from nearly zero in 2017. The region requires international assistance to meet its net-zero emission targets.[263] Phasing out coal remains a daunting task, although countries such as Indonesia and Vietnam have pledged to phasing out coal power by 2040s.[265] Several high-profile leaders such as the head of the Indonesian national energy company PLN, Darmawan Prasodjo, have stated that the ASEAN Power Grid proposal is key to unlocking the potential for green energy in southeast Asia.[266] To enhance the region's status in education, ASEAN education ministers have agreed four priorities for education at all levels, promoting ASEAN awareness among ASEAN citizens, particularly youth, strengthening ASEAN identity through education, building ASEAN human resources in the field of education strengthening the ASEAN University Network.[267] At the 11th ASEAN Summit in December 2005, leaders set new direction for regional education collaboration when they welcomed the decision of the ASEAN education ministers to convene meetings on a regular basis. The annual ASEAN Education Ministers Meeting oversees co-operation efforts on education at the ministerial level. With regard to implementation, programs, and activities are carried out by the ASEAN Senior Officials on Education (SOM-ED). SOM-ED also manages co-operation on higher education through the ASEAN University Network (AUN).[268] It is a consortium of Southeast Asian tertiary institutions of which 30 currently belong as participating universities.[269] Founded in November 1995 by 11 universities,[270] the AUN was established to:[267] promote co-operation among ASEAN scholars, academics, and scientists, develop academic and professional human resources, promote information dissemination among the ASEAN academic community, enhance awareness of a regional identity and the sense of \"ASEAN-ness\" among member states. In November 2011, ten vocational schools and centers were established in China to help develop human resources to assist in the economic and social development of the ASEAN countries.[199]: 160 ASEAN also has a scholarship program offered by Singapore to the 9 other member states for secondary school, junior college, and university education. It covers accommodation, food, medical benefits and accident insurance, school fees, and examination fees. Its recipients, who perform well on the GCE Advanced Level Examination, may apply for ASEAN undergraduate scholarships, which are tailored specifically to undergraduate institutions in Singapore and other ASEAN member countries.[271][272] 'Australia for ASEAN' scholarships are also offered by the Australian Government to the 'next generation of leaders' from ASEAN member states. By undertaking a Master's degree, recipients are to develop the skills and knowledge to drive change, help build links with Australia, and also participate in the Indo-Pacific Emerging Leaders Program to help develop the ASEAN Outlook for the Indo-Pacific. Each ASEAN member state is able to receive ten 'Australia for ASEAN' scholarships.[273] The organization hosts cultural activities in an attempt to further integrate the region. These include sports and educational activities as well as writing awards. Examples of these include the ASEAN Centre for Biodiversity, ASEAN Heritage Parks[274] and the ASEAN Outstanding Scientist and Technologist Award. In addition, the ASEAN region has been recognized as one of the world's most diverse regions ethnically, religiously and linguistically.[275][276] Member states have promoted co-operation in information to help build an ASEAN identity. One of the main bodies in ASEAN co-operation in information is the ASEAN Committee on Culture and Information (COCI). Established in 1978, its mission is to promote effective co-operation in the fields of information, as well as culture, through its various projects and activities. It includes representatives from national institutions like the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Ministries of Culture and Information, national radio and television networks, museums, archives and libraries, among others. Together, they meet once a year to formulate and agree on projects to fulfil their mission.[277] On 14 November 2014, foreign ministers of member states launched the ASEAN Communication Master Plan (ACPM).[278] It provides a framework for communicating the character, structure, and overall vision of ASEAN and the ASEAN community to key audiences within the region and globally.[279] ASEAN Media Cooperation (AMC) sets digital television standards and policies in preparation for broadcasters to transition from analogue to digital broadcasting. This collaboration was conceptualised during the 11th ASEAN Ministers Responsible for Information (AMRI) Conference in Malaysia on 1 March 2012 where a consensus declared that both new and traditional media were keys to connecting ASEAN peoples and bridging cultural gaps in the region.[280] Several key initiatives under the AMC include:[281] Music plays a significant role in ASEAN affairs, as evidenced by the new music composed for, and to be performed at, the 34th ASEAN Summit in Bangkok in June 2019.[286] Since ASEAN's founding, a number of songs have been written for the regional alliance: The main sporting event of ASEAN is the Southeast Asian Games, a biennial meet of athletes from the ten member-states. A non-member state Timor-Leste (also known as East Timor) is now participating the SEA Games. ASEAN has been credited by many as among the world's most influential organisations and a global powerhouse.[287][288] The organisation plays a prominent role in regional and international diplomacy, politics, security, economy and trade.[289][290][291][292][293][294][295][296][297][298][299][300][excessive citations] The ASEAN Free Trade Area also stands as one of the largest and most important free trade areas in the world, and together with its network of dialogue partners, drove some of the world's largest multilateral forums and blocs, including APEC, EAS and RCEP.[299][301][302][303][298][304][excessive citations] Being one of the world's forefront political, economic and security meetings, the ASEAN Summit serves as a prominent regional (Asia) and international (worldwide) conference, with world leaders attending its related summits and meetings to discuss about various problems and global issues, strengthening cooperation, and making decisions.[305][306] Critics have charged ASEAN with weakly promoting human rights and democracy, particularly in junta-led Myanmar.[307] Some scholars think that non-interference has hindered ASEAN efforts to handle the Myanmar issue, human rights abuse, and haze pollution in the area. Despite global outrage at the military crack-down on unarmed protesters in Yangon, ASEAN has refused to suspend Myanmar as a member and also rejects proposals for economic sanctions.[308] This has caused concern as the European Union has refused to conduct free trade negotiations at a regional level for these political reasons.[309] During a UN vote against the ethnic cleansing of Rohingya, most member states voted to either abstain or against the condemnation. Only the Muslim-majority countries Malaysia, Indonesia, and Brunei voted to condemn the cleansing of Rohingya.[310] Some international observers view ASEAN as a \"talk shop\",[311] stating that the organisation is: \"big on words, but small on action\".[312] \"ASEAN policies have proven to be mostly rhetoric, rather than actual implementation\", according to Pokpong Lawansiri, a Bangkok-based independent analyst of ASEAN. \"It has been noted that less than 50% of ASEAN agreements are actually implemented, while ASEAN holds more than six hundred meetings annually\".[313] The head of the International Institute of Strategic Studies, Tim Huxley, cites the diverse political systems present in the grouping, including many young states, as a barrier to far-reaching co-operation beyond economics. He also asserts that, without an external threat to rally against after the Cold War ended, ASEAN has less successfully restrained its members and resolved such border disputes as those between Myanmar and Thailand or Indonesia and Malaysia.[314] During the 12th ASEAN Summit in Cebu, several activist groups staged anti-globalisation protests,[315] arguing that the agenda of economic integration would negatively affect industries in the Philippines and would deprive thousands of Filipinos of their jobs.[316] Corruption remains a widespread issue, as \"tea money\" remains an important requirement to grease business transactions and to receive public services. Following the release of the Corruption Perceptions Index 2015 by Berlin-based graft watchdog Transparency International on 27 January, its Asia Pacific director, Srirak Plipat, noted that: \"if there was one common challenge to unite the Asia-Pacific region, it would be corruption\", noting that: \"from campaign pledges to media coverage to civil society forums, corruption dominates the discussion. Yet despite all this talk, there's little sign of action.\"[317] The group's integration plan has raised concerns, in particular, the 2015 deadline. Business and economy experts who attended the Lippo-UPH Dialogue in Naypyidaw cited unresolved issues relating to aviation, agriculture, and human resources.[318] Some panelists, among them, Kishore Mahbubani, warned against high expectations at the onset. He stated: \"Please do not expect a big bang event in 2015 where everything is going to happen overnight when the ASEAN Economic Community comes into being. We've made progress in some areas and unfortunately regressed in some areas.\"[319] Some panelists enumerated other matters to be dealt with for a successful launch. Among them were the communications issues involving the 600 million citizens living in the region, increasing understanding in business, current visa arrangements, demand for specific skills, banking connections, and economic differences. Former Philippine National Statistical Coordination Board (NSCB) Secretary General Romulo A. Virola, said in 2012 that the Philippines seems unready to benefit from the integration due to its \"wobbly\" economic performance compared to other member states. According to Virola, the Philippines continues to lag behind in terms of employment rate, tourism, life expectancy, and cellular subscriptions.[320] Nestor Tan, head of BDO Unibank Inc., said that while some businesses see the Asian Economic Blueprint (AEC) as an opportunity, the integration would be more of a threat to local firms. Tan added that protecting the Philippines' agricultural and financial services sectors, as well as the labour sector, would be necessary for the implementation of AEC by 2015.[321] Standard & Poor's also believed that banks in the Philippines are not yet prepared for the tougher competition that would result from the integration. In one of its latest publications, S&P said banks in the country, although profitable and stable, operate on a much smaller scale than their counterparts in the region.[321] The US Chamber of Commerce has highlighted widespread concern that the much-anticipated AEC could not be launched by the 2015 deadline.[322] In January 2014, former ASEAN Secretary-General Rodolfo C. Severino, wrote: \"while ASEAN should not be condemned for its members' failure to make good on their commitments, any failure to deliver will likely lead to a loss of credibility and could mean that member states fall further behind in the global competition for export markets and foreign direct investment (FDI)\".[323] In 2012, the commencement of the AEC was postponed to 31 December 2015 from the original plan of 1 January. Despite Secretary-General Surin Pitsuwan's firm reassurance that \"[t]here will be no more delays and that all ten ASEAN countries will participate\", even the most fervent proponents of AEC worried that AEC would not be delivered on time as December 2015 neared.[132] An article published by Vietnam News echoed some of the challenges and opportunities that Vietnam faces in preparation for the AEC. The article said that the deputy head of the Ministry of Industry and Trade, Tran Thanh Hai, was concerned about local enterprises' lack of knowledge of the AEC. It was said that 80% of local enterprises surveyed acknowledged that they have little information about the interests and challenges available for them in the ASEAN market. The article also noted that the general secretary of the Vietnam Steel Association, Chu Duc Khai, said that most of the local steel making enterprises lack information about doing business in the ASEAN market; they have not had a chance to study it, and have only exported small amounts of steel to ASEAN countries.[324] Another challenge is the need to compete with other countries in the ASEAN market to export raw products since the country had mainly exported raw products.[325] The Asian Development Bank also has doubts about Cambodia's ability to meet the AEC deadline. The leading economist of ADB, Jayant Menon, said that Cambodia needs to speed up its customs reform and to press ahead with automating processes to reduce trade costs and minimise the opportunities for corruption and be ready for the implementation of its National Single Window by 2015.[326] Despite an ASEAN Economic Community goal of significant economic integration as laid out in the AEC Blueprint 2025, ASEAN continues to face challenges towards integration.[327] A report published by the Asian Trade Centre in 2019 identified multiple sectors that face challenges towards integration due to non-tariff barriers that still exist in the region. The report stated that the goals of the AEC 2025 would not be accomplished if ASEAN fails to address the issues of non-tariff measures and eliminate non-tariff barriers in the region.[328][329] ASEAN is recognized by its members to be one of the main forums to discuss security issues; based on the principles in its charter, its main aim is to provide an environment of common understanding and cooperation between the member states to \"respond effectively to all forms of threats, transitional crimes and transboundary challenges\".[330] Accordingly, ASEAN has embraced the idea of cooperative security[331] which means that ASEAN's approach to security issues is through confidence-building measures and transparency for reducing the tension and conflict between its members. Security policies and plans are concerted by the ASEAN Political-Security Community to envision \"a concert of Southeast Asian nations, outward looking, living in peace, stability and prosperity, bonded together in partnership in dynamic development and in a community of caring societies.\"[332] Piracy in the strait of Malacca and in the Sulu and Celebes Sea is one of the main non-traditional security threats for the region, it has challenged the capacity of its members to ensure coordination of effective policy actions to reduce this phenomenon. As highlighted by the ReCAAP report of 2020: \"The increase of incidents (in Asia) during January–June 2020 occurred in Bangladesh, India, Indonesia, the Philippines, Vietnam, South China Sea and Singapore Strait.\"[333] The increment of incidents during 2020, have raised alerts in the region as the phenomenon of piracy could be fostered by the social consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic, in their Fourteenth Asean Ministerial Meeting On Transnational Crime[334] the ministers agreed that ASEAN should embrace a greater commitment to strengthen the measures in combating transnational crime in the context of the pandemic. Despite this statement, ASEAN has not updated their plans for combating piracy, although member states created and enforced the Maritime Security Plan of Action 2018-2020, to address the national legal enforcement capacities and creating a common protocol of action to counter piracy allowing the region to cooperate for ensuring the security of the Pacific Ocean, new discussions and agendas for new measures has not been enforced yet. Accordingly, this plan reinforces the necessity to secure the seas due to the importance of this region geographical and economically, its strategic position as the main link between the Indian and the Pacific Ocean and the region serving as the main passage that connects middle east economies and India with China, Japan, South Korea and Australia. This plan is mainly focused in three priorities:[335] In this sense, spread all over the countries of Southeast Asia, criminal organizations with complex structures pose a challenge to ASEAN's coordination capacity to solve the problem despite the plans created within its institutional framework. Although some measures have been implemented by ASEAN,[336] still the complexity of the problem requires deep solutions of cooperation that might alter the balance of its framework. The maritime security plans for the region are based on the ASEAN idea of political-security community; the two main objectives of the APSC are: \"to accelerate the economic growth, social progress and cultural development by promoting an identity of equality and partnership as the main foundations of peace and prosperity\".[336] Additionally, the APSC promotes \"regional peace and stability through abiding respect for justice and the rule of law in the relationship among countries of the region and adherence to the principles of the United Nations Charter\".[337] Nonetheless, the institutional framework and decision-making procedures in ASEAN make difficult to reach agreements on piracy. ASEAN has struggled to deliver a coordinated response to solve this problem in the region mainly by two reasons: the first one, could be related to the focalized nature of the problem in subregions rather than the whole region. Consequently, this focalization generates that the discussions in the main forums (The ASEAN maritime forum (AMF) and Maritime Security Expert Working Group (MSEWG)) have not resulted in actual measures that tackle piracy and involve all member states as major consensus should be reached to enforce them. One example of this, is the possibility discussed by the 10 ASEAN member states to create a joint ASEAN navy in 2015 to carry on operations in one of the piracy hotspots in the region,[338] the strait of Malacca, this proposal ended up being enforced by bilateral/sub-regional efforts rather than in the ASEAN framework (see ReCAAP for further information).[339][340][341] The second one, consensus on non-traditional security issues has been difficult to reach due to contradictory interest between member states, particularly in joint operations between navies and the reach of these joint operations. These issues are generated mainly by unresolved territorial disputes, specially in the maritime domain, at some extent they pose a challenge to ASEAN members in their capacity to cooperate in regards to the maritime security approach.[342] Consequently, a greater multilateral cooperation has been pushed by the members to solve the piracy challenges on economy, trading and security. Members of the ASEAN, have addressed the necessity for the regional organization to make some concessions and rearrangements to respond to the challenges that non-traditional security (specifically piracy) issues posse to the security of the ASEAN members. Despite the efforts and plans made by the ASEAN, this organization is expected to overcome the image of being regarded solely as a forum to discuss security issues. Two possible solutions has been proposed by some member states for this purpose: 1. Promoting relationships with other major actors regionally to overcome the short-time challenges and 2. Rearrange the institutional framework to \"avoid contention and seek cooperation to maximize the aggregate ability in order to benefit from making the sea fulfil its economic, security and other goals\".[342] In addition to piracy, there are several significant issues facing ASEAN today, including human rights violations, repression, and democratic backsliding. Across the region, various political leaders are known human rights abusers, however there is no proper accountability process, and often human rights violations are sidelined by economic or political interests.[343] Myanmar is in the midst of a devastating civil war, during which the military government that was installed following a coup d’état, has carried out horrendous human rights violations against the Rohingya population.[344] Organisations ASEAN Summits ASEAN organisations ASEAN related websites",

Faskianos April 12, 2023 United States A Conversation With Secretary Antony J. Blinken Event with Antony J. Blinken and Michael Froman December 18, 2024 The Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) is a regional grouping that aims to promote economic and security cooperation among its ten members: Brunei, Cambodia, Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia, Myanmar, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand, and Vietnam. ASEAN countries have a total population of 662 million people and a combined gross domestic product (GDP) of $3.2 trillion. The group has played a central role in Asian economic integration, joining negotiations to form the world’s largest free trade agreement and signing six free trade deals with other economies in the region. Yet experts say ASEAN’s impact is limited by a lack of strategic vision, diverging priorities among member states, and weak leadership. The bloc’s biggest challenges, they say, are developing a unified approach to China, particularly in response to territorial disputes in the South China Sea, and responding to Myanmar’s civil war. More on: Southeast Asia Asia Regional Organizations Defense and Security Trade ASEAN is headed by a chair—a position that rotates annually among leaders of member states—and is assisted by a secretariat based in Jakarta, Indonesia. Important decisions are usually reached through consultation and consensus guided by the principles of noninterference in internal affairs and peaceful resolution of conflicts. Many experts see this approach to decision-making as a drawback of the organization. “These norms of consensus and noninterference have increasingly become outdated, and they have hindered ASEAN’s influence on issues such as dealing with China and crises in particular ASEAN states,” says CFR's senior fellow for Southeast Asian studies, Joshua Kurlantzick. Supporters of ASEAN, such as Kishore Mahbubani, who served as Singapore’s permanent representative to the United Nations, say the grouping has improved previously hostile regional relations. “[ASEAN’s] culture of consultations and consensus generated geopolitical miracles, some so stealthy that few outside the region have noticed them,” says Mahbubani.

Formed in 1967, ASEAN united Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore, and Thailand, who sought to create a common front against the spread of communism. In 1976, the members signed the Treaty of Amity and Cooperation in Southeast Asia, which emphasizes mutual respect and noninterference in other countries’ affairs. Membership doubled by the end of the 1990s. The resolution of Cambodia’s civil war in 1991, the end of the Cold War, and the normalization of relations between the United States and Vietnam in 1995 brought relative peace to mainland Southeast Asia, paving the way for more states to join ASEAN. With the addition of Brunei (1984), Vietnam (1995), Laos and Myanmar (1997), and Cambodia (1999), the group started to launch initiatives to boost regional cooperation. For example, the members signed a treaty in 1995 to refrain from developing, acquiring, or possessing nuclear weapons. Timor-Leste is the latest country to join ASEAN: after the country applied for membership in 2011, the group granted it observer status in 2022, and it is on track for full membership by 2025. Faced with the 1997 Asian financial crisis, which started in Thailand, ASEAN members pushed to further integrate their economies. For instance, the Chiang Mai Initiative was a currency swap arrangement initiated in 2000 among ASEAN members, China, Japan, and South Korea to provide financial support to one another and fight currency speculation. More on: Southeast Asia Asia Regional Organizations Defense and Security Trade In 2007, the ten members adopted the ASEAN Charter, a constitutional document that provided the grouping with legal status and an institutional framework. The charter enshrines core principles and delineates requirements for membership. (Timor-Leste submitted an application for membership in 2011, but some members oppose its accession.) The charter laid out a blueprint for a community made up of three branches: the ASEAN Economic Community (AEC), the ASEAN Political-Security Community, and the ASEAN Socio-Cultural Community. ASEAN brings together countries with significant differences. Singapore has the highest GDP per capita in the group, at around $83,000, according to 2022 World Bank figures; Myanmar’s is the lowest, at around $1,100. Demographics differ across the region, too, with many religious and ethnic groups represented. For example, Singapore and Vietnam are among the world’s most religiously diverse countries, according to a 2014 Pew Research Center report, while Buddhist-majority Cambodia and Muslim-majority Indonesia are relatively homogeneous. ASEAN’s geography includes archipelagos and continental land masses with low plains and mountainous terrain. The members’ political systems include flawed democracies, authoritarian states, and hybrid regimes. The past decade has seen previously some semi-democratic governments, like Indonesia and Cambodia, grow increasingly authoritarian. Today, Timor-Leste remains the only fully free democracy in Southeast Asia, according to research and advocacy group Freedom House. ASEAN has made some progress toward economic integration and free trade. In 1992, members created the ASEAN Free Trade Area (AFTA) with the goals of creating a single market, increasing intra-ASEAN trade and investments, and attracting foreign investment. In 1996, the average tariff rate across the bloc was around 7 percent [PDF]; today, intra-ASEAN tariffs are effectively zero. The bloc has prioritized eleven sectors for integration, including: electronics, automotives, rubber-based products, textiles and apparels, agro-based products, and tourism. In November 2020, all ASEAN members joined Australia, China, Japan, New Zealand, and South Korea in signing the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP), a free trade agreement in the works since 2012. Although the RCEP doesn’t cut tariffs drastically, it covers more of the world’s population—30 percent—than any other trade agreement and promotes economic integration between Northeast and Southeast Asia. ASEAN is also party to six free trade agreements with countries outside of the grouping, including India. However, there remain major challenges to economic integration within ASEAN, such as non-tariff barriers, government-mandated investment prohibition areas, and massive differences in GDP per capita. Intra-ASEAN trade as a share of the bloc’s overall trade remains low, at 21 percent [PDF] in 2020. Domestic issues, such as instability and corruption in certain countries, have also hurt trade within the bloc. Moreover, the COVID-19 pandemic was severely disruptive to economic growth. ASEAN attempted to coordinate a regional response in 2020 to address economic and health-care challenges, but successful pandemic management ultimately hinged on individual states’ policy decisions. Member states agreed to coordinate economic recovery plans and keep trade open. However, prolonged lockdowns severely reduced industrial production, construction, and consumer spending. Additionally, travel restrictions hampered intra-bloc trade and tourism, which contributed almost $400 billion to ASEAN member economies in 2019. ASEAN remains divided over how to address security challenges. These include China’s claims in the South China Sea, human rights abuses, political repression by member states, narcotics trafficking, refugee flows, natural disasters, and terrorism. A primary challenge for ASEAN has been developing a response to the February 2021 coup in Myanmar. The junta has violently suppressed protests, and the conflict with opposition forces has escalated into civil war. Timor-Leste sided with Myanmar’s exiled government, leading to Myanmar’s military junta expelling Timor-Leste’s top diplomat from Myanmar. During the 2023 ASEAN Summit held in Jakarta, Indonesia, ASEAN nations decided to suspend Myanmar’s role as rotating chair for the 2026 summit, substituting the Philippines instead. Another long-standing challenge has been forming a joint response to China, particularly to maritime disputes with Beijing in the South China Sea. Brunei, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, and Vietnam claim features in waters contested with China. For those countries, China’s moves to reclaim land and build artificial islands are seen as violations of their national sovereignty. In response, some have invested in modernizing their militaries. For other ASEAN members, tensions in the South China Sea are geographically distant and not a priority. A few, such as Cambodia, even tend to support China’s claims and block joint ASEAN statements on the South China Sea. In 2002, ASEAN and China signed the nonbinding Declaration of Conduct of Parties in the South China Sea, though they have not yet negotiated a legally binding code and it is unlikely they will negotiate one anytime in the near future. The United States, which has a strong interest in preventing China from controlling access to the South China Sea, has continued military cooperation with ASEAN members, including the Philippines, Thailand, Singapore, Indonesia, and Vietnam, and has increased its maritime presence in regional areas to enforce freedom of navigation in international waters. ASEAN members are divided over their ties to China and to the United States. The region is in need of investment, trade, and infrastructure development. Beijing has moved to meet these needs primarily through becoming the leading trading partner of ASEAN, as well as through its sweeping Belt and Road Initiative. Its dominant trade relationship with most Southeast Asian states, and its massive investment in Southeast Asia, gives it enormous leverage in the region. For instance, China invested $7.3 billion in Indonesia’s first high-speed railway, which began construction in 2015 and is set to expand throughout the main island of Java, despite delays, cost overruns, and anger among people whose land was expropriated. Most ASEAN countries now believe that China has more overall influence in the region compared to the United States, measured by economic relationships, defense networks, and diplomatic and cultural influence. But some member states are anxious about becoming economically dependent on China and seek defense cooperation with the United States to hedge against China’s growing military power. The United States is ASEAN’s fourth-largest trading partner in terms of goods, trailing China, the European Union, and Japan. In 2022, the United States’ total trade in goods and services with ASEAN was an estimated $505.8 billion. The United States has launched subregional and bilateral initiatives to boost ties, including the Mekong-U.S. Partnership, which aims to deepen cooperation between the United States and Cambodia, Laos, Myanmar, Thailand, and Vietnam on issues related to the environment, health, education, and infrastructure development. U.S. presidents have also met Southeast Asian leaders during ASEAN summits and the annual East Asia Summit, which is hosted by ASEAN and also attended by the heads of state of Australia, China, India, Japan, New Zealand, Russia, and South Korea. In 2023, President Joe Biden skipped the ASEAN summit to attend the Group of Twenty (G20) Summit in New Delhi, India, sending Vice President Kamala Harris in his place. Some ASEAN members viewed Biden's absence as a disappointment and diplomatic snub. The Barack Obama administration, as part of its so-called “pivot” or “rebalance” to Asia, increased U.S. participation in activities with ASEAN. President Obama and other senior officials attended some ASEAN summits. The administration also named the first resident ambassador to ASEAN, joined the Treaty of Amity and Cooperation, and established an annual U.S.-ASEAN summit. In 2015, the United States and ASEAN elevated their relationship to a strategic partnership. The following year, Obama hosted the first U.S.-ASEAN leaders’ summit in California. The Donald Trump administration sent high-ranking officials to Southeast Asia, including Vice President Mike Pence and secretaries of state and defense. But President Trump attended just one meeting with ASEAN leaders, in 2017. Some experts in Southeast Asia say the Trump administration’s inconsistent engagement with the region caused U.S.-ASEAN relations to deteriorate. The U.S. withdrawal in 2017 from the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTPP), a free trade agreement formerly known as the TPP, set back broader U.S. efforts to demonstrate commitment to the region’s trade integration, they say. The United States is not part of the RCEP trade deal. President Biden has promised to boost ties with ASEAN by collaborating on issues such as climate change, global supply chains, and the COVID-19 pandemic. However, CFR’s Kurlantzick says the administration has yet to deliver on its promise to strengthen economic ties with the region. The Indo-Pacific Economic Framework (IPEF) for regional economic cooperation, launched in 2022 and which entered its fourth round of negotiations in July 2023, falls short of an actual trade deal. The United States offers no market access to countries involved, alienating many of them. Many Southeast Asian states are disappointed with the IPEF, as compared to regional trade deals led by China and Japan that successfully improve trade across Asia. CFR’s Joshua Kurlantzick discusses democratic backsliding and the revival of military rule in Southeast Asia. In this 2021 report [PDF], the East-West Center, the U.S.-ASEAN Business Council, and the ISEAS–Yusof Ishak Institute take stock of U.S.-ASEAN ties.

Deployed in 2012, the XRPL supports enterprises and Python, Java and JavaScript developers with powerful utility and flexibility. On the XRP website, developers can access different tutorials to help them get started using different coding languages, building apps, managing accounts and more. Alongside its native coin, XRP, the XRP Ledger is used by developers to create solutions that solve inefficiencies, including remittance and asset tokenization. Currently, the five main applications of the XRP Ledger are payments, tokenization, DeFi, CBDCs and stablecoins. Unlike Bitcoin or Ethereum, the XRPL uses a unique Federated Consensus mechanism as its method of validating transactions. Transactions are confirmed on the XRPL through a consensus protocol, in which designated independent servers called validators come to an agreement on the order and outcome of XRP transactions. All servers in the network process each transaction according to the same rules, and any transaction that follows the protocol is confirmed right away. All transactions are public and transparent, and anyone can operate a validator. There are currently over 150 validators on the ledger, operated by universities, exchanges, businesses, and individuals around the world. Through the Federated Consensus mechanism, all verified transactions can be processed without a single point of failure as no single participant makes a decision independently. XRP is listed on many CeFi exchanges globally, including Binance, Huobi and Bitstamp. To learn more about this project, check out our deep dive of XRP. Since late 2020, Ripple Labs, which uses the XRP token in its products, has been locked in a legal battle with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission. The big question is whether or not XRP is a security. On Dec. 22, 2020, the SEC filed a lawsuit against Ripple Labs and two of its executives on the grounds that they traded $1.3 billion in their XRP token as security without registering it with the commission. There have been arguments for and against the lawsuit. However, Ripple has strongly countered the claims, arguing that the SEC has been biased in its assessment. The SEC uses the “Howey test,” based on the Supreme Court ruling on SEC v. W.J. Howey Co in 1946, to determine whether a cryptocurrency is a security. An asset is considered a security if it is sold with the expectation of getting profits from the efforts of other parties. Based on the commission’s definition of XRP in its lawsuit, the cryptocurrency would pass the Howey test, and according to SEC regulations, all securities must be registered. While most companies targeted by the SEC in a similar matter chose to settle, Ripple decided to fight. The outcome of the lawsuit will undoubtedly have far-reaching implications in the crypto space. If Ripple prevails, the SEC could lose some of its credibility, giving other crypto-based companies the confidence to revolt. On the flip side, if the SEC wins the case, it could upend the way crypto firms operate and usher in a new wave of registration rules that apply to securities.

                "content": "Unlike most cryptocurrencies, which are decentralised and therefore not run by a single entity, the cryptocurrency XRP is controlled by a company called Ripple. Ripple positions itself as an updated version to the SWIFT system and is already being used by banks and other financial institutions. The native currency of the Ripple network is the XRP coin Ripple’s open source protocol and network is already being used by banks and other institutions Ripple network is positioning itself not as a direct rival to cryptocurrencies, but more as an updated version to the SWIFT system There is no mining process involved to mint new units of XRP The pre-mined amount of XRP is 100 billion units but only a fraction of that is currently in circulation The all-time-high of the XRP price was €3.18, reached in early 2018 New to Bitpanda? Get started today! The Ripple network and its cryptocurrency XRP were launched in 2012. XRP is different from other cryptocurrencies in that it is owned by a single company and not run by a decentralised community. It also does not position itself as an alternative to traditional currencies. Instead, XRP wants to be a kind of middleman currency to allow global trade between any unit of value, like from cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin to euro or other fiat currencies. Ripple already works closely with banks and financial institutions. The main goal of Ripple is to establish a network that allows as many transactions as possible to simultaneously run as fast as possible. Ripple aims to attract companies like large banks, remittance services and payment providers who are interested in the technology. Keeping this in mind, it’s easy to see that Ripple is more of a competitor to established financial infrastructure services such as SWIFT than to other cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin or Ethereum. Ripple is the name of the company that issues its own cryptocurrency. The exchange code for that currency is XRP. Even in the technology department, Ripple differs greatly from other cryptocurrencies. First, the Ripple network doesn’t run on a blockchain. Second, XRP doesn’t rely on mining to mint new units of XRP or to validate transactions. Instead, transactions on the Ripple network run through validating servers, which constantly compare the information they receive and process with a common ledger. For this reason, Ripple doesn’t expend as much energy and computing power while still allowing for faster transaction speeds. Ripple’s validating servers use a consensus mechanism called HashTree. The main difference between the Ripple network and a Proof-of-Work blockchain is that consensus is reached by comparing not all the data, but only a single value, which is derived by summarising the ledger’s data. These independent validating servers are either run by individuals or by banks and institutions. To buy Ripple (XRP), one must go through a cryptocurrency exchange like Bitpanda and use fiat currencies, e.g. euros or U.S. dollars, to purchase XRP. It’s recommended to first get familiar with the Ripple price history and the current exchange rate. After purchase, you can view and access your Ripple in a digital wallet that acts similarly to a banking app. You then have the option to hold on to your XRP or sell it again via the exchange. Just like any other cryptocurrency, Ripple is considered to be a highly volatile asset and the Ripple price tends to fluctuate in response to events happening in the market. Ripple reached its all-time high in January 2018 when the XRP price reached €3,18. It has dropped significantly since then and has currently been experiencing a daily high of €0.3479 and a daily low of €0.3321. The purpose of Ripple is to utilise the internet, blockchain technology and the XRP currency to allow value transfers across borders in a quick, cost-efficient and reliable way. In that sense, Ripple is primarily geared towards offering solutions to businesses, governments and institutions. Cross border payments to enable global money transfers, crypto liquidity to source digital assets, and CBDC services are Ripple’s primary use cases. Some invest in XRP like they would stocks, buying the currency on a crypto exchange and then holding it or selling it on. Ripple is used as a payment solution by banks, governments and institutions. Ripple’s primary use cases are cross border payments, crypto liquidity and CBDC. XRP can be bought as an investment on a cryptocurrency stock exchange and held in a digital wallet. The XRP Ledger 1.6 was released in August 2020 and included several updates that aim to improve overall performance. Along with bug fixes and optimisations, the consensus mechanism became more robust by setting offline validators aside while they are not connected to the network. Furthermore, the hardened validations that were introduced allowed servers to detect Byzantine behaviour more easily - a significant problem in the XRP space. In 2020, allegations by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission against Ripple caused some turmoil. According to the SEC, XRP is a security and was not declared as such. The reasoning behind the claim is that about 50% of the total XRP tokens are owned by Ripple. In its official reply, Ripple defended itself by stating that the XRP network is completely decentralised and that holding XRP does not mean receiving a portion of Ripple’s revenues or profits. Ripple Xpring is an ecosystem initiative for investing in, incubating, acquiring and providing grants to projects and companies that could help realise use cases for XRP outside of international transactions, such as crypto solutions for debt and derivatives.

                "content": "• Firefighters are in a critical stage of their six-day battle against deadly Los Angeles wildfires. Crews report progress but officials say the fire threat will remain very high as dangerous winds return this week. • At least 24 people have died, and dozens are missing, but officials say it’s not yet safe to assess the true total. Here’s what we know about the victims. • Questions over LA’s preparedness for the firestorm have led to political finger-pointing. Experts tell CNN the region faced a devastating combination of circumstances. • The Eaton and Palisades Fires are likely the second and fourth most destructive in California history, according to Cal Fire. Wildfires are fueled by a knot of factors but scientists say global warming is loading the dice in favor of more severe blazes. And California is uniquely susceptible to climate change. • How to help: For ways to help Los Angeles County residents, visit CNN Impact Your World. Our live coverage of the Los Angeles County wildfires has moved here. The total area burned by the Palisades, Eaton and Hurst fires is approximately 38,629 acres as of 2:30 a.m. ET, according to figures released by Cal Fire. That roughly equates to 60 square miles. The city of Paris is 40 square miles, meaning the fires have burned through an area of land bigger than the capital of France. The Palisades Fire alone is approximately 37 square miles (23,713 acres) according to Cal Fire, so is nearing the size of Paris. Utility companies are still working to restore power to tens of thousands of customers, with many areas experiencing deliberate electricity shutoffs for safety reasons. As of Sunday evening, about 18,500 customers in the city of Los Angeles are still without power, according to the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power (LADWP). Utility giant Southern California Edison (SCE) on Sunday said it had about 63,000 customers without power — an increase from the previous day, mostly due to the deliberate shutoffs “implemented in response to weather conditions.” SCE and LAPWP have already restored power to hundreds of thousands of customers since the fires began last week, and have crews on the ground assessing fire-affected areas to prepare for restoration efforts. “Once fire agencies release areas for restoration, damage assessment crews inspect areas and remove safety hazards,” said SCE. This includes clearing debris and vegetation to support crews restoring power lines; once those repairs are complete, power is restored first to essential services, then to customers. Wind forecast: Southern California Edison warned that dangerous conditions — such as the powerful Santa Ana winds forecast to come early this week — could impact that progress, and even prompt more pre-emptive safety power shutoffs. Water shortages: The power shutoffs are important to protect firefighters from falling power lines — but also posed a problem last week when crews faced water shortages from hydrants. In Altadena, where the Eaton Fire broke out, issues with dry hydrants were traced back to a lack of electricity, said Bob Gomperz, a board member at a utility company that provides water to the western region of Altadena. In foothill communities like Altadena, he said, water needs to be pumped into tanks at higher elevations so the water can flow downhill when needed relying on gravity. But after those tanks were drained by firefighters, they couldn’t be refilled - the power shutoffs meant they couldn’t pump water to where it was needed. President Joe Biden also pointed to the same issue last week, saying fire officials brought generators into those areas to facilitate water pumping. Los Angeles County Fire Department Section Chief Ken Haskett urged “patience” and “grace” when asked when people should expect to return home to assess what remains from the wreckage. The damage inspection is far from over, he told CNN. “We estimate that well over 5,000 homes have been destroyed just in the Palisades,” Haskett said. “It’s devastating.” “Infrastructure is destroyed. We are in a disaster,” he said. “This is something … at least in my history … I haven’t seen since I was born. These are fuels that haven’t burned since the 50s.” Haskett says that the city and state will hopefully “get some reform” that will make buildings stronger and more resilient to such disasters. “I ask for people’s grace, please, and patience – we’re doing this as quick as possible” The Eaton Fire has left countless families displaced, each with their own story to tell. For residents like Derek Russell Jr., the pain is compounded, CNN affiliate KABC reported. Just a month after burying his father, Derek Russell Sr., on December 6, Russell Jr. faced another heartbreaking blow when their Altadena home was consumed by flames on Tuesday. “I didn’t even go through his stuff yet because I wasn’t ready. I was just trying to learn how to grieve for myself for that,” he told the outlet, reflecting on the weight of his loss. “This means everything. This is his legacy,” Russell Jr. told KABC, clutching his father’s American flag, the only remnant of him. Building codes and land use planning have been “extraordinarily useful” for minimizing damage and loss of life from natural disasters like earthquakes across California, Jay Lund, a professor of Civil and Environmental Engineering at University of California, Davis, told CNN. The same could be done for wildfires, but fire codes for many buildings in Southern California are outdated and were likely implemented around 2007, the most recent 2010, Lund said. Los Angeles’ unique typography of slopes and hills means that storing water locally for wildfire mitigation will prove to be challenging as houses are usually elevated, the professor added. “There are quite a few communities in southern California where before you can build a development, you have to basically build the structures so that a fire can come through and not kill people,” he said. A continued and persistent Santa Ana Wind event is ongoing across Southern California, where red flag warnings are in effect through Wednesday including the Palisades, Hurst and Eaton Fires. On Monday: Winds are expected to slightly increase through the day and could gust between 45-55 mph. The possible gusts have put nearly eight million people under critical fire weather, per the Storm Prediction Center. On Tuesday: Winds are expected to peak from the morning through to Wednesday at noon, where the National Weather Service has issued “Particularly Dangerous Situation” red flag warnings for parts of Ventura and Los Angeles counties. These warnings include the Hurst Fire and are nearby but not including the Palisades and Eaton Fires. Although not as severe as last week, winds could still gust between 45-70 mph. What does that mean for the fires? These gusty winds will combine with very dry air and ongoing drought to exacerbate conditions for firefighters desperately battling to increase containment. There is a chance of “extremely critical” fire weather, the highest level, to be issued by the prediction center for parts of Ventura County on Tuesday. These locations fall into the “Particularly Dangerous Situation” red flag warnings: Western San Gabriel Mountains along the I-5 Corridor, Santa Susana Mountains, southern Ventura County Mountains, Ventura Valleys (mainly near Simi, Moorpark, South Mountain and Piru to Santa Paula), Northern San Fernando Valley along Highways 118 and 210 from Porter Ranch to San Fernando, western Santa Monica Mountains and the Ventura County Coastal Plain (mainly hills above Camarillo/Oxnard westward to Ventura). Kim Kardashian has called for higher pay for incarcerated firefighters battling the blazes in Los Angeles County, according to multiple US media reports. In several posts on her Instagram stories, Kardashian thanked the LA Fire Department and the state’s Cal Fire agency for “using every ounce of their strength to save our community.” “On all 5 fires in Los Angeles, there are hundreds of incarcerated firefighters, risking their lives to save us,” according to screenshots of the posts shared by several media outlets. “I see them as heroes,” she wrote, adding that they “get paid almost nothing.” “I am urging (Gov. Gavin Newsom) to do what no Governor has done in 4 decades, and raise the incarcerated firefighter pay to a rate (that) honors a human being risking their life to save our lives and homes.” Some context: The California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation told CNN that, as of Friday, nearly 1,000 inmates have been working to stop the fires. Depending on skill, these inmates earn between $5.80 and $10.24 per day in an emergency. Cal Fire also pays the crew members an additional $1 per hour. They work a 24-hour shift, and the least skilled crew member earns at least $26.90 per day. Royal Ramey, who worked as a firefighter while incarcerated and was pardoned by Newsom in 2022, told CNN last week the inmates perform the same work as regular firefighters. “We’re out there. We’re in the front lines. We’re utilizing tools. We’re going out and we’re out there cutting line and doing our thing,” he said. Beyoncé’s BeyGOOD Foundation has pledged $2.5 million to support wildfire relief efforts in Southern California, according to a social media post. The contribution to the newly established LA Fire Relief Fund is earmarked to assist families in the Altadena and Pasadena areas, which have been severely impacted by the wildfires. The donation, according to the post, aims to address the immediate needs of those impacted, extending support not only to families but also to churches and community centers in other affected regions. The initiative, the foundation says, underscores its commitment to addressing immediate community needs. Firefighters made good progress on Sunday, with milder winds allowing them to fully contain some smaller blazes such as the Lidia, Kenneth and Sunset Fires. But winds are picking up again Sunday night — and expected to stay strong over the next few days, posing a challenge as fire crews battle the ongoing Palisades and Eaton Fires. Here’s where the fires stand: The toll: At least 24 people have died due to the fires. LA County Sheriff Robert G. Luna said his office has received “dozens and dozens” of missing person reports. More than 12,000 structures have been destroyed by the Eaton and Palisades Fires alone, making them likely the second and fourth most destructive fires in California’s history respectively, according to Cal Fire. The forecast: Stronger winds are expected to resurge Sunday night heading into Monday, bringing “critical fire weather conditions” through mid-week, according to the National Weather Service. These gusts could reach up to 60 miles per hour, in areas already impacted by severe drought. Much of Southern California, stretching from Ventura County to San Diego, are now under red flag warnings, which signify high fire danger. Firefighting efforts: On Sunday, there were more than 14,000 emergency personnel battling the fires on the ground and in the air, according to Cal Fire. States near California, as well as countries including Mexico and Canada, have also sent help. The LAFD sought to reassure citizens that it is ready to tackle the challenges ahead. “We are ready. Mayor (Karen) Bass, Chief (Jim) McDonnell, myself, our city leaders, are fully fully committed to ensure that we’re ready for this next event,” said LAFD Chief Kristin M. Crowley, who is facing criticism for prioritizing diversity, equity and inclusion in the department. The possible causes: Fire agencies are investigating whether Edison electrical equipment contributed to the Hurst Fire. The fire was reported at around 10:10 p.m. and a circuit experienced a relay a minute later, according to Edison International. Evacuations: About 105,000 residents are still under mandatory evacuation orders. If weather and fire conditions permit, authorities will begin trying to get people from evacuation zones back to their communities starting Thursday, the Los Angeles County Fire Chief said. California Governor Gavin Newsom said that “tremendous prepositioned resources” are in place in Mandeville Canyon ahead of “potentially dangerous winds” from Monday through Wednesday night. “I’m up here in Mandeville Canyon, which was the site in the last two nights of tremendous investment and resources. Firefighters working the lines - a lot on those assets still here not only in anticipation of a potential flareup here in the Palisades Fire, but also prepositioned,” Newsom said in a video published on social media on Sunday night. CNN Meteorologist Allison Chinchar earlier said wind speeds had begun increasing from single digits into the teens and are predicted to continue rising through Wednesday. “We’re not going to really get a break for several more days,” she says, with some wind gusts as high as 60 miles per hour expected in areas already impacted by severe drought. More than 40,300 acres across California have been burned by 105 fires in the first 11 days of the year, Cal Fire spokesperson Brice Bennett said in a video update posted Sunday night. The Eaton and Palisades Fires –– which have, combined, burned nearly 38,000 acres –– are likely the second and fourth most destructive fires in California history, he said. The Eaton Fire, which saw minimal growth on Saturday, is currently at 27% containment, Bennett said, after searing through more than 14,000 acres. Roughly 7,081 structures were destroyed by the fire, the Los Angeles County Fire Department noted in a Sunday update, though damage inspection reporting is only 24% complete. The Palisades Fire, which burned more than 23,700 acres, is at 13% containment, according to Cal Fire. More than 14,000 emergency personnel on land and in the air are battling the multiple blazes spread across Southern California, with the Kenneth Fire now at 100% containment and the Hurst Fire at near total containment, according to Benett. Red flag warnings remain in effect in Ventura, Los Angeles and Orange Counties, as well as parts of San Bernardino, Riverside and San Diego Counties until Wednesday. The role of climate change: Wildfires are fueled by a knot of factors, both natural and human-caused, but scientists say that global warming is loading the dice in favor of more intense and severe blazes. Here’s why California is uniquely susceptible to the worst of human-caused climate change. Los Angeles police are warning of scammers who are “actively targeting vulnerable individuals and families, exploiting their distress” in the aftermath of the devastating fires. According to a community alert issued Sunday, some common scams include: To avoid these scams, police advised the public to always verify the authenticity of the callers or individuals — for instance, hanging up and calling back the agency through their official number, or checking so-called job offers directly on the agency’s official website. Legitimate organizations will not ask for payment using unusual platforms like cryptocurrency, police said. Other warnings: On Saturday, California Attorney General Rob Bonta urged people to be cautious of scams, some of which have targeted elderly people and immigrants who may not speak English as a first language. An LA County supervisor also warned on Saturday of fundraising scams appearing on GoFundMe, saying that those who are caught running these scams will be prosecuted by the district attorney’s office. Firefighters with the Orange City Fire Department found a ring amongst the rubble of a home lost in the Palisades Fire and were able to return the heirloom to the family it belonged to. “While battling the flames, Fire Engineer Garrett received a message about a family who had to evacuate without taking their belongings,” the department said on Facebook. One of those belongings was a ring that was “a treasured heirloom passed down through three generations.” The crews went back to where the house was and after sifting through debris, found a safe. Inside was the ring. “It was truly a miraculous moment for our family. We didn’t lose everything,” the family told the fire department. “It was a glimmer of hope that came at the hands of an incredible group of men that I am eternally grateful for. It was a moment of joy and tears that we will never forget. Thank you.” Mandatory evacuation orders are now lifted for the Hurst, Kenneth, Lidia and Sunset Fires, according to California Gov. Gavin Newsom – but remain in place for the Palisades and Eaton Fires. The Eaton Fire is now 27% contained, while the Palisades Fire is 13% contained, according to Cal Fire. The Hurst Fire stands at 89% contained, and the rest have been fully contained. However, Newsom warned, “Residents are strongly encouraged to continue heeding evacuation warnings still covering these affected areas.” If weather and fire conditions permit, authorities will begin trying to get people from evacuation zones back to their communities starting Thursday, Los Angeles County Fire Chief Anthony C. Marrone said Sunday. The Los Angeles Unified School District will reopen almost all schools and offices Monday. Seven of the district’s 1,302 schools will remain closed, Superintendent Alberto M. Carvalho said in a Sunday evening press conference. Carvalho said that two of the district’s schools that are not reopening Monday were “victims of the destructive power of the fire in the Palisades.” “These schools will not reopen, they need to be rebuilt before anything happens in that area,” he explained. The reopened schools will operate on an inclement weather schedule which limits outdoor activities and athletics, and masks will be available for students and employees, the district said in a release. The remaining schools “will reopen as soon as conditions allow, at which time, we will notify families,” reads the release. The district will continue to monitor conditions overnight and notify families of any changes to the plan by 5:30 a.m. PT on Monday. LA Unified is the second largest school district in the United States, and the largest in the state of California, serving more than 600,000 K-12 students. A total of 24 people have died due to the California wildfires, according to an updated death toll from the County of Los Angeles Department of Medical Examiner. The cases are still under investigation by the department. Wildfire survivors forced from their homes might be able to access up-front reimbursement of their evacuation costs from insurers, Consumer Watchdog executive director Carmen Balber told CNN. “If you’re in an evacuation area – and especially if you already know you lost your home – contact your insurance company right away. You can get an advance on your policy limits.” Balber said residents should get copies of their insurance policy, start collecting receipts and document every conversation with their insurer in order to get claims paid quickly. It was also crucial not to begin clearing debris from homes until an inspection had taken place, she said, so insurers could see the full extent of the damage. Balber warned the financial impact of the fires on consumers could be great, with some uninsured after being dropped by insurance companies, others unable to get adequate insurance “and, critically, consumers who are going to have to fight to get every dollar of insurance benefit that they’re entitled to.” Some homeowners in increasingly fire-prone areas of California have been unable to get insurance or to have existing policies renewed in recent years. The state’s California FAIR Plan has provided an insurance option for those unable to access private insurance but with higher premiums and less coverage. The California Department of Insurance recently announced new regulations designed to get private insurers to start writing policies in fire-prone parts of the state. However, Balber has previously criticized the new policy for “lack of teeth,” saying it may drive up rates rather than coverage. Consumer Watchdog is a nonprofit, nonpartisan Consumer Advocacy Group focusing on the insurance market in California. The Los Angeles Fire Department does not have any information that the Palisades Fire is linked to a fire that broke out nearby on New Year’s Eve, Los Angeles City Fire Chief Kristin Crowley told reporters today. At a news conference on the fire Sunday afternoon, officials were asked if the earlier blaze, which was declared contained within a day, was being considered in the investigation. We do not have any information that there’s any connections but that’s the good thing when we bring in an outside resource that is going to look into every single detail … LA City Fire Chief Kristin Crowley LA Police Chief Jim McDonnell responded that the LA Fire Department, LA County Fire, LA Police Department, LA County Sheriff’s Department, the federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives and the Federal Bureau of Investigation were “working together in taskforce configuration to try and find source and origin of this fire and all of the fires we’ve experienced.” He said once the investigation was complete “you’ll be made aware.” Crowley added: “We do not have any information that there’s any connections but that’s the good thing when we bring in an outside resource that is going to look into every single detail to make sure that Fire Service knows, the community knows, exactly where and how and when all of this occurred – and that’s across the region in regard to all the other fires that occurred, even outside of the Palisades.” The LAFD reported early New Year’s Day that a brush fire had broken out in Pacific Palisades, north of Palisades Drive – an area now within the current Palisade Fire. That fire was eventually contained the same day after growing to 8 acres. “Some resources will be released as the mop up operation continues to ensure no flare ups. No structures damaged and no injuries reported,” the LAFD said in its final alert on the blaze. Hundreds of wildfire evacuees and volunteers have gathered for free food and other resources at a grassroots donation center outside Santa Anita Park in Arcadia, according to CNN affiliate KABC. The ad-hoc donation center emerged after a group of street-vendor friends joined forces to feed people, KABC reported. A portion of the park has been blocked off for the donation center and donations will be accepted through Sunday evening. Aerial video of the scene showed large crowds assembled at the park, with volunteers moving stacks of donated goods. The park canceled racing for the weekend due to the ongoing fires. A total of 931 inmates are currently working around the clock, cutting fire lines and removing fuel from behind structures to slow the spread of California’s devastating wildfires, according to the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation. The group includes 114 incarcerated people working as support staff, the department said. Participants are paid by the department between $5.80 and $10.24 per day depending on skill level and they can earn an additional $1 per hour from Cal Fire when assigned to an active emergency, according to a fact sheet from the department. Most of them receive 2-for-1 credits – meaning they receive two additional days off their sentence for each day they work. Support staff receive 1-for-1 credits. “Wildfires are a constant and formidable challenge for California, and CDCR conservation fire camps remain dedicated to supporting the state’s response,” said California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation Secretary Jeff Macomber. “The work of our incarcerated firefighters and staff is an essential part of this effort, and their commitment to protecting lives and property during these emergencies cannot be overstated.” Participants who complete the program can seek record expungement and many former participants go on to work for Cal Fire, the U.S. Forest Service and interagency hotshot crews, according to the department. More on incarcerated firefighters: CNN previously reported on incarcerated California firefighters and a training program that helps them transition to firefighting jobs after their release. Former inmates can join a free, 18-month program at the Ventura Training Center that trains them to work as professional firefighters. Rising winds in the Los Angeles area are expected to complicate firefighting efforts over the next few days, with little respite from the weather until later in the week. CNN Meteorologist Allison Chinchar says wind speeds have begun increasing from single digits into the teens and are predicted to continue rising through Wednesday. “We’re not going to really get a break for several more days,” she says, with some wind gusts as high as 60 miles per hour expected in areas already impacted by severe drought. January is usually the area’s second wettest month but since October 1 the Los Angeles area has had only 0.03 inches of rain compared to its usual 4.6 inches. “This is not the time of year you normally see fires this large, especially spreading so quickly,” Chinchar said. “But it’s because that brush, that vegetation that’s on the ground, is so dry it’s able to spread those fires so quickly. “ In six or seven days, humidity is expected to increase, Chinchar says, but the changing conditions may have limited impact. “It doesn’t necessarily mean it’s going to result in a tremendous amount of rain, but at least even a little bit of some higher humidity levels would allow these firefighters at least a better opportunity to get some of those containment numbers up as well.” Los Angeles County Fire Chief Anthony C. Marrone said on Sunday that efforts to start getting people from evacuation zones back to their communities will begin on Thursday. “Before I end I just wanted to talk about the repopulation of areas that were under evacaution order or evacuation warning. This is a priority for the unified incident command. Not only for the Palisades Fire, but also the Eaton Fire. Unfortunately, those conversations are not going to begin until the next predicted red flag ends on Wednesday,” Marrone said, adding that officials will begin talks about repopulation “first thing Thursday.” The forecast: Winds are expected to pick back up this week after a brief reprieve, with a red flag warning in place in Los Angeles and Ventura counties through Wednesday. Combined with dry vegetation, the winds “will support rapid spread and erratic behavior of any new or existing fires,” the warning said. Teams of undercover federal and local law enforcement officers are patrolling Los Angeles County fire evacuation areas, a law enforcement source involved in the response tells CNN. Undercover personnel in civilian clothes and driving unmarked vehicles are searching for potential looters scouting out evacuated areas, as well as keeping an eye on the skies for drones flying in violation of flight restrictions, the source said. Al Hugo, an Altadena-based firefighter, who lost his home in the Eaton Fire, told CNN on Sunday he never thought his home would be hit. “It’s kind of surreal, I mean it’s something that really hits home, you know, you do this for a living, but, you know, you invest your-your life to try to, you know, protect life and property. But when it’s your own, it’s just a different feeling,” Al Hugo said He said he and his wife were vigilant in keeping an eye on the fire throughout the night and “we evacuated just when the fire got to the point where we. we had to.” His wife Carmen Hugo said, “It was really hard. I didn’t know what to do. I just said, ‘It smells like the smoke is right here in the house’ and then we got the alarm to evacuate. And then that’s when we left.” She said they didn’t have time “to get anything from the house because we never thought it was going to burn.” Al and Carmen Hugo were able to evacuate their dogs from the house. “I have two big dogs, one’s a senior, 13 years old, can hardly walk and then the other dogs and the two rescues,” Carmen Hugo said. Al Hugo said he was supposed to report to duty the following morning but he stayed home to help his wife who raised concerns about the fire. “I’ve never in-in my wildest dreams ever think it was going to hit as close as it did to my house,” he said. California Gov. Gavin Newsom announced he will deploy 1,000 more service members with the National Guard to Los Angeles. The service members will help fight the fires and assist with public safety efforts, Newsom said in a news release. The addition brings the total number of National Guard members deployed to Los Angeles to around 2,500, according to the release. “The men and women of the California National Guard have been on the ground since day one – not only fighting fires, but also assisting with public safety efforts in communities devastated by these fires,” said Newsom in the release. “We thank them for their efforts to keep our communities safe.” Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelensky says firefighters from his country are on standby to help fight the California wildfires. “Today, I instructed Ukraine’s Minister of Internal Affairs and our diplomats to prepare for the possible participation of our rescuers in combating the wildfires in California,” Zelensky said Sunday in a post on X. “The situation there is extremely difficult, and Ukrainians can help Americans save lives,” he said. “… we have offered our assistance to the American side through the relevant channels. 150 of our firefighters are already prepared.” Canada’s Prime Minister Justin Trudeau earlier announced that 60 Canadian firefighters were being deployed to help in California. They would join 70 firefighters from Mexico who were due to arrive in California Saturday afternoon. In an X post Saturday, California Governor Gavin Newsom said the firefighters from Mexico would be joining more than 14,000 personnel already on the ground. “California is immensely grateful to our neighbors’ support in the fight against the wildfires in Los Angeles,” Newsom said on X. Zelenksy’s offer of Ukrainian help comes as his country prepares for the transfer of power from US President Joe Biden to Donald Trump. Ukraine’s President had been due to meet Biden in Rome last Friday, but the White House announced it was cancelling the meeting to focus on the California wildfires. On Thursday, the Biden administration announced it was giving Ukraine a final tranche of military aid amounting to about $500 million. The US has given Ukraine more than $65 billion in aid since the country’s war with Russia began in late February 2022 but it is unclear whether military assistance will continue once President Trump returns to office. Trump has said he wants to end the war but has questioned the value of aid to Ukraine and the US commitment to NATO. Kaye Young’s mother’s home was destroyed in one of the wildfires that have rapidly spread in Los Angeles this week, hitting historic communities where families have had ties for generations. Young told CNN on Sunday that she was able to walk into the burn area to see her mother’s Altadena home on Thursday. Altadena, a neighborhood that lies below the Angeles National Forest in northeast LA, was the center of the devastation from the Eaton Fire, which has destroyed thousands of structures and left at least 11 people dead. Young found all the homes on her mother’s street had burned — to the point that you could see from one block straight across to another — and that the middle school she had attended was also razed. She says her kids, nieces and nephews all have history in her mother’s home. Now, “It’s not there anymore.” Young’s son, Aarron Flowers, told CNN his grandmother bought the home in 1959: “She’s a retired nurse. My mom’s a retired nurse. There’s a lot, a lot of pride in our community.” CNN’s Fredricka Whitfield noted the significant history in Altadena, a neighborhood known as a bastion of Black home ownership and a refuge from discriminatory redlining practices. She asked the mother and son whether they were concerned about the community maintaining that legacy. Flowers said the reality that he will not be able to bring his child to see his grandmother’s home is “shocking.” “There’s always the fear that, you know, the people who are here won’t be able to rebuild and, you know, you’ll see those certain pillars of the community not be there anymore,” Flowers said. “I’m hoping that the younger generations will stay. I’m hoping there are resources available for the ones that are still here.” Flowers also noted that they are unsure of the status of Young’s own home, which — last they saw on news reports — was still standing. Fire agencies are investigating whether Edison electrical equipment contributed to the Hurst Fire, according to a Sunday news release from Edison International. The fire was reported at around 10:10 p.m. local time, and a circuit experienced a relay a minute later, says the release. A downed power line connected to the circuit was also found, but Edison says they don’t know “whether the damage observed occurred before or after the start of the fire.” The utility says they have submitted Electric Safety Incident Reports related to both the Hurst and Eaton fires. Edison says the reports are often submitted to the California Public Utilities Commission before the company “can determine whether its electric facilities are associated with an ignition.” CNN has reached out to the Los Angeles Fire Department for comment. Director of the California Department of Public Health (CDPH) Dr. Tomas Aragon told CNN that it was important that people take care of their mental wellbeing. “The most important thing during any time of traumatic event is to have positive social connections,” Aragon said. Emotions prompted by the fires could feel overwhelming, he said. “It’s natural to feel this way. Please, please connect with folks,” Aragon said. He directed residents needing professional services to mentalhealth.ca.gov. Aragon also warned Californians to be conscious of the hazards of wildfire smoke, regardless of whether they were close to the fires. “This smoke can travel hundreds – hundreds – of miles away,” he said. “Recognize that when you smell smoke, you’re being exposed, but if you don’t smell it, you could still be exposed. “ He encouraged residents to keep across air quality in their neighborhood and in affected areas to recirculate air inside and try to maintain a clean room with an air purifier. Wearing a N95 mask was also key, Aragon said. “It reduces the amount of particulates you’re going to breathe in. And it could really help — help for acute symptoms, but also long term symptoms, because those particulates get deep into your lung, they get into your blood, they cause inflammation, and you can have symptoms weeks later, related to an exposure you have today.” California Governor Gavin Newsom says 53 teams of inspectors are working to complete inspections on all structures damaged by the wildfires – with the hope of completing inspections within two weeks. Inspectors will assess and document each property, paving the way for property owners to begin dealing with insurance and rebuilding, Newsom explained in an interview with CNN’s Kyung Lah. The inspectors’ findings will also be available online so property owners can assess the damage remotely. The inspections will encompass thousands of homes. “Whatever resources they need, we said we’re going to provide it,” the governor said. Once inspections are complete, the “Herculean effort” of removing debris will begin, Newsom said. Removing all the debris and toxic material left behind as homes and buildings burned will likely take between six and nine months, according to the governor. The process is complicated by toxic waste, as well as the need to remove debris in a way which will be compatible with the rebuilding effort, he said. “I’m for efficiency, transparency, moving forward in a cost-efficient manner,” he said. “And then being accountable to the next step again, which is not just scraping, cleaning things up, but getting the rebuild going.” President Joe Biden will convene “key officials” in a virtual briefing on the wildfires in Southern California on Sunday, the White House said. The president will be briefed on “efforts to suppress the wildfires across Los Angeles and how the federal resources he has directed are supporting the State and local response,” an official said. Vice President Kamala Harris is also expected to attend, the official added. The following officials will also attend the briefing, according to the White House: Homeland Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas, FEMA Administrator Deanne Criswell, White House Chief of Staff Jeff Zients, FEMA Region 9 Administrator Bob Fenton, US Forest Service Chief Randy Moore, Homeland Security adviser Liz Sherwood-Randall and deputy Homeland Security adviser for Resilience and Response Caitlin Durkovich. California Governor Gavin Newsom signed an executive order Sunday suspending some requirements to build under state environmental laws in an effort to help fire victims rebuild faster. Newsom’s order suspends some permit and review requirements under the California Environmental Quality Act and the California Coastal Act for people impacted by the wildfires. “We want you to come back, rebuild – and rebuild with higher quality building standards, more modern standards; we want to make sure that associated costs with that are not disproportionate, especially in a middle-class community like this,” Newsom said in an appearance on NBC’s Meet the Press in Altadena, California. The order also directs state agencies to identify other permitting requirements that can be suspended to allow faster, more affordable rebuilding. “California leads the nation in environmental stewardship. I’m not going to give that up, but one thing I won’t give into is delay,” Newsom said on Meet the Press. Newsom also extended protections against price gouging on building materials and other essential goods for the next year. Photos released by the FBI show the damage done to the wing of a Canadian “Super Scooper” plane when it collided with a civilian drone Thursday, forcing it to be temporarily grounded. The specifically designed CL-415 firefighting plane, used to scoop up more than 1,500 gallons of ocean water, was helping to fight the devastating Palisades Fire. The collision caused a three-by-six-inch hole in the plane’s wing, according to the FBI. The FBI said it is seeking the public’s help to identify a suspect. “These fire suppression efforts using aircraft is probably the most effective tool that our firefighters have against fighting these fires to help contain them,” Akil Davis, FBI assistant director in charge of the Los Angeles field office, told CNN on Saturday. “When you take one plane out of commission like that, it’s going to impact the speed in which the fire grows, it’s going to cause loss of property, potentially loss of life, and it’s a danger to everybody all around.” Authorities were able to recover some pieces of the privately-owned drone, said Davis. The damaged plane, Quebec 1, should be back up flying by Monday, L.A. County Fire Chief Anthony C. Marrone said Friday. Authorities have vowed to prosecute all drone flights in areas over the wildfires, which they say are illegal and may interfere with firefighting efforts. The total number of people arrested during the wildfires in Los Angeles has climbed to approximately 29, Los Angeles County Sheriff Robert Luna said Sunday. “Yesterday in Palisades, we had one arrest for curfew violation. Unfortunately, they resisted arrest,” Luna said. “And Eaton, we had six arrests last night, three for curfew violations and three for additional charges, including carrying a concealed firearm and narcotics-related charges.” According to Luna, 25 people have been arrested in the area of the Eaton Fire and four in the area of the Palisades Fire. Luna recalled the LAPD arrests of individuals who were posing as firefighters to walk freely in and out of houses. “…He was dressed like a fireman, and he was not. He’d just got caught burglarizing a home,” the sheriff said. Luna said the individuals that authorities were running into in the fire zones do not live in those areas. “The individuals that we’re contacting do not live in the areas where we’re arresting them; we’re finding out they have zero business being in these areas,” Luna said. “So I do want to reiterate to our communities: if you do not belong in these affected areas, do not go there. You are subject to arrest.” Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass said Sunday there is no animosity or lack of communication between the city and President-elect Donald Trump, adding she has spoken to representatives of his incoming administration. “I joined in the invitation to the incoming president to come to Los Angeles. I joined with the supervisor and the governor. Spoke directly with the incoming administration yesterday. It was a fine call,” Bass said. Los Angeles County Supervisor Kathryn Barger said she has sent a letter to Trump inviting him “to see the devastation of these wildfires firsthand,” and meet with impacted residents. Barger and Bass said they thought Trump would visit the city soon. Trump was less cordial in a Truth Social post Sunday. “The fires are still raging in L.A. The incompetent pols have no idea how to put them out. Thousands of magnificent houses are gone, and many more will soon be lost,” Trump said. “There is death all over the place. This is one of the worst catastrophes in the history of our Country. They just can’t put out the fires. What’s wrong with them?” Donald Trump, Truth Social Bass said she had not had a direct conversation with Trump, but has spoken to people in his incoming administration, noting some of her former congressional colleagues will soon be joining the administration. California is counting on outside resources to bolster its response to the wildfires burning across Los Angeles County, Democratic Sen. Alex Padilla said Sunday on NBC’s Meet the Press. “Now the whole world knows what we mean when we say ‘red flag warnings,’” Padilla said. “When it’s dry, when it’s warm and the winds kick up, regardless of the cause of a fire, it has the chance to spread much more quickly,” he continued. When asked whether he has faith in Gov. Gavin Newsom and Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass, the senator said, “I do have faith in our leaders, and not just as individuals, but especially because we — after disaster, after disaster, after disaster — have gotten really good at working together.” Padilla said the state could always use more resources, but the mutual aid assistance program has helped provide some relief. Crews have come in from Central and Northern California, as well as a number of other states including Oregon, Washington, New Mexico, Arizona, Colorado and Utah, to help fight the fires, he said. “Collectively, we’re putting all the resources we can towards fighting these fires,” he said. When asked whether he believes incoming President Donald Trump will uphold President Joe Biden’s promise to have the federal government cover 100% of California’s recovery costs for at least six months, Padilla cited an invitation for Trump to tour the impacted areas. “Just as Californians have been there for other regions of the country in their times of crisis, it’s time for the country to unite behind California, and that includes incoming President Trump,” he said. Editor’s Note: A new episode of “The Whole Story: LA Burning” premieres tonight at 8 p.m. ET on CNN. Anderson Cooper examines the conditions that led to this outbreak and the stories of those who have lost everything. “All of the reports that I’ve received is that the L.A. County water system is ready and it will be prepared to assist us in fighting a wildland fire,” Los Angeles County Fire Chief Anthony Marrone said during a news conference Sunday. Seventy water tenders previously requested by Cal Fire have arrived, Marrone said. High winds are expected to make the battle to get the fires under control even tougher. “The more resources that are flooding in to help us with our current fires, the better we are prepared to pre-deploy, knowing that this wind event is coming,” Los Angeles Fire Department Chief Kristin M. Crowley added. Officials started a grid search and rescue operation in the Eaton area Saturday, Los Angeles County Sheriff Robert Luna said during a news conference Sunday. “Unfortunately, during that search, we did locate three deceased,” Luna said. “As these searches continue, I unfortunately anticipate that those numbers will increase.” Luna said they plan a similar search operation on the north side of the county soon. At least 16 deaths connected to the wildfires have been reported: 11 from the Eaton Fire and five from Palisades, the Los Angeles County medical examiner said Saturday. Luna urged residents to report anyone they suspect is missing. The sheriff’s department currently has at least 16 missing person reports, 12 in Eaton and four in the Palisades, Luna said, citing one bit of “good news”: none of those missing are juveniles. However, he said the department has already received “dozens and dozens more” reports that have yet to be counted. “If you believe somebody is missing, please report it to your local law enforcement agency,” Luna said. More than 13,000 people have so far donated over $6 million to the California Community Foundation’s Wildlife Recovery Fund, which will support Los Angeles residents affected by the wildfires, Mayor Karen Bass said at Sunday’s news conference. “People are coming from everywhere to help us and make sure that we are ready for the days ahead,” said Bass. “So to them, I want to say thank you.” Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors Chair Kathryn Barger on Sunday committed to helping those impacted by wildfires in the short and long term, including providing access to every resource available. “While fighting the fires remains our top priority, we are rapidly deploying resources to ensure that the displaced residents have access to the resources that they need in the short and the long term,” Barger said. “My commitment to these that are impacted is simple: I’m going to see this through with you. We will not let up using every resource to fight existing fires. Displaced residents will be served to the highest level as we address your housing, welfare, health care and economic needs.” Barger shared a story of a couple she met on Saturday who lost their home “and the business burned down and he lost his job and they have no insurance. People are suffering.” Evacuation orders in Los Angeles County due to the Palisades and Eaton fires are down over the past few days, but continue to impact over 100,000 people, according to the Los Angeles County Sheriff. Approximately 105,000 residents are under evacuation orders and approximately 87,000 residents are under evacuation warnings, LA County Sheriff Robert G. Luna said at a news conference Sunday. “If you are asked to leave, and you’re in an evacuation order area – your life is in danger. You need to leave,” Luna said. The sheriff acknowledged how difficult it must be for residents to stay away, but said the affected areas remained unsafe. “Driving around some of these areas, they literally look like war zones. There are downed power poles, electric wires. There are still some smoldering fires. It is not safe…” Luna said. “We want to get you back into your homes, but we can’t allow that until it is safe for you to do so.” The Eaton Fire is 14,117 acres and 15% contained, while the Palisades Fire is 23,707 acres and only 11% contained, according to Cal Fire. Los Angeles City Fire Chief Kristin Crowley on Sunday urged residents who fled the Palisades Fire to be patient, saying evacuation orders and warnings remain in place because the conditions still present a threat. Crowley acknowledged the frustration of residents who want to return home. But first responders are still “working as quickly as possible” to make sure things are safe before allowing people back into the community. “There are still active fires that are burning within the Palisades area, making it extremely, extremely dangerous for the public,” Crowley said. “There’s no power, there’s no water there’s broken gas lines, and we have unstable structures.” Firefighters overnight were met with “favorable wind conditions,” Crowley said, which helped prevent the fire from spreading further into the Mandeville Canyon area. The fire has so far burned more than 23,700 acres, and it’s 11% contained. Los Angeles County Fire Chief Anthony C. Marrone said Sunday that the threat of fire remains high, asking residents for patience with power shutoffs. “These winds, combined with low relative humidities and low fuel moistures, will keep the fire threat in Los Angeles County very high. I asked our county residents in wildfire-prone areas to understand that the necessary public safety power shut-offs are important for our collective safety in preventing the next wildfire natural disaster,” Marrone said. The Eaton Fire burning at the edge of the Angeles National Forest in the Altadena, California, area has been over a quarter contained since it began five days ago. The fire has charred 14,117 acres so far and is 27% contained, according to the latest data from Cal Fire. The Eaton Fire has destroyed many homes and businesses, and quickly become one of California’s deadliest fires, responsible for 11 of the deaths reported so far. The Los Angeles area wildfires remain “dangerous,” FEMA Director Deanne Criswell told CNN’s Jake Tapper Sunday, as the federal government braces for what is likely to be a lengthy and complex response heading into the next administration. “The winds are potentially getting dangerous and strong again. I believe the red flag warnings have been put back in place, and so I think the biggest thing that people need to know is that this is still dangerous, and they still need to make sure they’re listening to their local officials so they can keep themselves safe,” Criswell said on CNN’s “State of the Union.” With just eight days until President-elect Donald Trump takes office, Criswell said her agency would work through the transition like it has every other, delivering needed services to those eligible for them. Tapper also pressed Criswell on recent comments by Trump going after California Gov. Gavin Newsom, asking if she is concerned politics could get in the way of disaster relief. “We need to make sure that they are never politicized, right,” Criswell said. “It doesn’t matter if you are Democrat or Republican, these types of weather events, they do not discriminate.” At least 16 people have been confirmed dead as four major wildfires continue to burn in and around Los Angeles, with officials scrambling to contain the blazes ahead of high winds that threaten to undo progress made in the fight against the flames. In the meantime, tens of thousands of people remain under evacuation orders. Others, having returned home to find they’ve lost everything, face a “long road to rebuilding” their lives. Here’s the latest: This post has been updated to reflect the latest containment numbers for the Eaton and Hurst fires. More than 150,000 people in Los Angeles County were under evacuation orders Saturday night, Michael Traum, an official with the California Office of Emergency Services, said in a briefing posted online. More than 700 people were staying in nine available shelters, Traum said. An expanded evacuation order was issued for the Palisades Fire on Friday, and the University of California, Los Angeles, has told students to be prepared for a potential evacuation, as evacuation warnings get closer to the campus. Nearly 180,000 residents in the county were under evacuation orders Thursday, according to Sheriff Robert Luna, with close to 200,000 residents under evacuation warnings. An evacuation order is mandatory, while a warning prepares residents that they may soon need to leave. As firefighters continue to battle raging fires across Los Angeles County, a cut to the Los Angeles Fire Department 2025 budget and its commitment to recruiting a more diverse force have come under attack. Four major fires across the LA area have killed 16 people, scorched over 38,000 acres and damaged at least 10,000 structures. More than 150,000 people are under evacuation orders, according to the California Office of Emergency Services. As crews work to contain multiple infernos, LAFD Chief Kristin Crowley is facing criticism for prioritizing diversity, equity and inclusion within the department. Meanwhile, Crowley has expressed concerns about a $17.4 million cut to the department’s 2025 budget, which included reductions in overtime staffing. The finger-pointing has politicized what’s being described as the most destructive fire in LA history. Los Angeles Fire Commission President Genethia Hudley-Hayes says it’s “out of line” to blame any local official for the magnitude of the fires, saying the focus should be on helping the residents who have lost everything. The commission is composed of a five-person civilian board appointed by the mayor, and affirmed by the city council that oversees the fire department. “This is not the time to demonize people,” Hudley-Hayes said. The fire department budget has grown steadily year-over-year from $674.27 million in 2019 to $819.64 million in 2025, but it is down from $837.19 million in 2024. However, Hudley-Hayes stated that it has been underfunded for at least a decade. Read more about the scrutiny facing LAFD. CNN Chris Boyette, Elise Hammond and Emma Tucker contributed to this report. At least four wildfires continue to burn through Los Angeles County, but as each fire is more and more contained, firefighters and other resources are becoming freed up to join the continuing efforts to get the largest and least-contained Palisades Fire under control. The Kenneth Fire in Los Angeles and Ventura Counties is 90% contained and the Hurst Fire in the City of Los Angeles is 76% contained, according to CalFire. “You’re going to see crews that will be released from those incidents that can then be deployed to the Palisades Fire,” CalFire spokesperson Chris Harvey told CNN’s Amara Walker and Victor Blackwell Sunday. The Palisades Fire, which has been raging since January 7, is currently 23,654 acres and only 11% contained, according to CalFire. The Eaton Fire has killed at least 11 people, ranking it among California’s deadliest wildfires. There have been at least 16 deaths from the wildfires raging across Los Angeles County: 11 from the Eaton Fire and five from Palisades, the Los Angeles County Medical Examiner said Saturday. And officials say that likely isn’t the final count. The deadliest blaze in the state’s history was the Camp Fire, which killed 85 people in Butte County, according to CalFire. The top ten fires on the agency’s list of most deadly have killed between 11 and 85 people per fire, with one incident dating back to 1933. That fire, the Griffith Park Fire, also took place in Los Angeles. It burned 47 acres in October 1933 and killed 29 people, according to CalFire. First-time homeowners Brent and Tasia Callum watched as their home in Altadena burned in a raging wildfire. “It was unreal. It was literally a nightmare,” Tasia Callum told CNN. “I was hoping that our house would still be standing, and just to pull up, to see our house just fully engulfed in flames is heartbreaking, you know? All the work we put in and it’s just gone.” The couple evacuated with their two young children as the flames burned toward Altadena. “It was scary,” Tasia Callum told CNN’s Amara Walker and Victor Blackwell on Sunday. “Initially seeing the flames on top of the mountain, and then as we left, the flames had come all the way down the mountain by that time.” She called the couple’s house a “fixer-upper,” but said they had put their “all into it.” “We turned it all the way over. It was very nice and beautiful, and we loved it. It was home,” she said. The mother of two said she doesn’t think their 8-year-old son and 6-year-old daughter have completely grasped what happened to their home. The Callums represent the third and fourth generations of their family to live in the traditionally Black neighborhood. “Altadena is very important to myself and my family,” Brent Callum said. “My grandparents lived in Altadena, my wife’s grandparents lived in Altadena. Both of our parents live in Altadena. We live in Altadena and our children obviously live in Altadena. So, it’s four generations of people living in Atadena. This is home to us. We love it.” Brent Callum said the family could not imagine leaving Altadena, and despite the tragedy, they will rebuild once the time is right. “A lot of southern California was redlined. This was the only place that African Americans could stay, so it’s very important to us,” he said. The next few days will prove critical to the firefighting effort, with dry weather and strong winds expected to continue before temperatures cool toward the end of the week, according to the National Weather Service. A Red Flag Warning, which means there are likely “critical fire weather conditions,” is in place for Los Angeles and Ventura counties through 6 p.m. local time Wednesday. The more extreme conditions are due to “moderate to locally strong Santa Ana winds,” according to the weather service. The strongest winds are expected to come Sunday morning, easing through the day before picking back up late Monday going into Tuesday. “The very dry vegetation combined with the prolonged extreme fire weather conditions will support rapid spread and erratic behavior of any new or existing fires,” the warning said. Red Flag Warnings are also in place for other parts of Southern California, including inland Orange County and the Inland Empire, the areas just south and east of Los Angeles. Earlier on Saturday, firefighters and experts told CNN the Santa Ana winds could blow westward toward the coast — which could cause the Palisades fire, which had been shifting east, to blow back on itself — helping tame the fire by forcing it onto land that’s already been burned with little fuel left. Possible rain: Relief could come by the end of the week, when temperatures cool, humidity rises, and winds ease — with even a chance of light rain next weekend, according to the weather service. The California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection (Cal Fire) thanked on social media the number of partners — locally, federally and internationally — who have helped fight the Los Angeles wildfires in the past week. “CAL FIRE extends our heartfelt gratitude to the extraordinary departments, states, and countries that have stepped up to support California in this time of need. Whether by land, air, or sea, your dedication and effort have been invaluable,” the state agency wrote Saturday. “Together, we are stronger,” Cal Fire said. Canada and Mexico have both provided aid to California’s firefighting efforts, as well as crews from Nevada, Arizona, Utah, Colorado, New Mexico, Texas, Idaho, Oregon and Washington, according to Cal Fire. On Saturday, Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors Chair Kathryn Barger invited President-elect Donald Trump to visit the region and see firsthand the damage inflicted by multiple catastrophic wildfires since Jan. 7. Officials have confirmed at least 16 deaths from the devastation, with the ongoing Eaton, Hurst, Kenneth and Palisades fires spreading to more than 38,000 acres combined. The overall death toll, however, remains unclear — many areas are still unable to be searched by emergency personnel. The invitation comes on the heels of California Gov. Gavin Newsom inviting Trump to survey the damage on Friday. Trump previously visited California in 2018 to see the toll in Paradise caused by the Camp Fire, the deadliest wildfire in state history. “By accepting this invitation, Mr. President-Elect, you will join us in supporting our citizenry and thanking our heroic first responder, who have risked their own lives to save others,” Barger said in an open letter posted on X. “We would also ask you, as our President, to stand with the people of Los Angeles County as we set our course to rebuild. Your presence would be deeply felt and appreciated.” President Joe Biden said Thursday that the federal government will cover 100% of the costs for the initial response to the fires. He has also authorized the FEMA Serious Needs Assistance program, which includes offers of up to $770 to victims of the devastation as an upfront payment for essential items. The White House said on Saturday that Biden was briefed on “efforts to suppress” the wildfires, and spoke with Los Angeles County Supervisor Lindsey Horvath and Ventura County Supervisor Kelly Long on separate calls. Firefighters had a productive day Saturday, with favorable wind conditions helping crews contain the edges of major blazes and create firelines that prevent further spread. But winds could pick back up heading into the new week, potentially bringing new challenges that firefighters are now gearing up for. Here’s the latest on the size and containment of the major fires: Largest fire pushes inland: The Palisades fire’s eastern flank was brought into further focus Saturday as additional responders and resources combated growing flames. Across two fronts, the communities of Brentwood, Encino, Bel Air, Sherman Oaks and West Los Angeles remain at risk, among others. Malibu has lost a third of its eastern edge to the Palisades fire, its mayor said Saturday. The forecast: Winds are expected to pick up into the week, with a possible Santa Ana wind event that brings hot, dry gusts from the mountains west toward the coast. But that could push the Palisades fire – which had been traveling east – back onto itself, onto already-burned land with little fuel left, helping firefighters contain its edge, a battalion chief told CNN late Saturday. For Giorgi and Leonardo Antinori, the most devastating part of losing their home to the Palisades fire wasn’t just the displacement and material damage — it was losing the cremains of their late daughter, who had died as a baby more than a decade ago. “Her ashes were in our home, and they’re gone,” said Giorgi, speaking to CNN Saturday night. “Every memory, every piece of physical evidence of her life is just gone, and that hurts.” The couple and their second daughter, aged 2, had lived in the Palisades Bowl, a mobile home community that housed “a lot of singles, young families and older residents who were priced out of Santa Monica and Venice, or who have just lived there since the ‘70s,” Giorgi said. “It was very, very modest.” They evacuated on the first morning of the fires, and “by 5 o’clock, everything was up in flames,” she said. By the next morning, “our park was gone.” Making things worse, they didn’t have home insurance — though fires are common in Los Angeles, they had never reached that far into the Palisades before, typically staying contained in the canyons, the couple said. “The prices of insurance just got so high, and we were still trying to recover from the last four years of everything changing after Covid,” Giorgi said. They’d planned to pick up insurance after recovering economically — never thinking “in a hundred million years … that our house would go up in flames.” Thankfully, many friends and loved ones have reached out offering the family a place to stay — but it’ll still be a long road to rebuilding. “I never realized how loved we were by our community, and it’s just been overwhelming to see people help us,” Giorgi said. Winds could pick back up in the coming days after a brief reprieve — posing a potential threat as firefighters work to contain four major fires still burning across Los Angeles — but it could also offer an unexpected boon by changing the direction of the blaze, said Cal Fire Battalion Chief Brent Pascua. Speaking to CNN Saturday night, Pascua said fire crews had worked “24/7, all night” to reinforce the firelines they’d created — which are boundaries created by clearing away fuels like vegetation, and digging down to the soil level, to help prevent fires and embers from spreading. “Today was a very productive day. We used all our aircraft, our air tankers, our helicopters, in conjunction with our hand crews, hose lays,” he said. There is a risk the next few days bring Santa Ana winds, which are hot, dry gusts that flow down the sides of mountains toward the California coast — and could jeopardize those firelines. However, Pascua said, it could also change the direction of the fires. The Palisades fire has been moving east in the past day, pushing toward Interstate 405 — but Santa Ana winds can blow to the west. So if the winds do arrive, “it’s actually going to move (the fire) away from the freeway and head back towards the coast … it will blow this fire pretty much back onto itself,” he said. That’s what happened in the Encino area on Saturday — shifting wind directions pushed the fire back “where there’s already (land) burned and there’s no fuel to burn,” helping crews contain the fire edge, he said. As Santa Ana winds propelled a series of raging wildfires that wiped out homes and businesses across once-picturesque swaths of Southern California — killing at least 11 people — tens of thousands have been forced from their homes this week in a haze of uncertainty: What to pack? How long will they be gone? What will they return to? A vintage green-leather Rolex watch case. An Alekos Fassianos painting. A hard drive and albums with family photos. These are some of the cherished items they took. Read what California evacuees saved and what they were forced to leave behind. Tens of thousands of California residents will decide whether to permanently relocate or rebuild their homes after the most destructive fires in Los Angeles’ history. Insurance companies may cover thousands of dollars in temporary housing and living expenses — unless homeowners are underinsured or not covered. “The policy is generally going to cover the cost of additional living expenses while you are out of your home, to maintain what is kind of your usual standard of living,” said Karen Collins, the vice president of American Property Casualty Insurance Association’s property and environmental division. For example, if someone’s insurance covers $100,000 for a property, the insurance company might cover another $20,000 — or 20% — in additional living expenses, Collins said. Peter Vanek, president of PVRK, a Southern California-based real estate consulting company, said his home was destroyed by a battery fire in 2023. His insurance initially estimated $350,000 for the house. After Vanek provided evidence of what was lost, his insurance paid twice as much, including living expenses while he relocated, and the house was rebuilt. Leave or build again? Insurance coverage plays an outsized role in the decision to move or invest resources into reconstruction. For some with insurance, it could boil down to having pictures of the property before the damages and updating insurers with home estimates. “(Homeowners) might not have disposable income to cover the difference between whatever their insurance is going to cover and what their cost is to rebuild their home, replace all of their items,” Vanek said. The current wildfires in Los Angeles County are the costliest and most destructive in its history. The insured losses could exceed $20 billion, according to a report by JPMorgan Chase. Read more about the difficult choices facing California homeowners here. A new investigative task force is being created in response to the wildfires, Los Angeles Police Department Chief Jim McDonnell announced Saturday. The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives will be taking over as the lead investigator on the task force, he said. The ATF will be working to determine the origin and cause of the Palisades Fire, the agency’s Los Angeles office said in a tweet. “Certified fire investigators have been on scene and will continue to work in conjunction with state and local investigators to determine the cause of this tragic event,” the agency said. The same national response team that investigated the Maui wildfire is expected to join the investigation of the Palisades Fire, two people briefed on the matter told CNN. Their assistance was requested by Los Angeles fire officials. The team can determine whether power line failures, arson, or other causes were involved in starting the blaze. © 2025 Cable News Network. A Warner Bros. Discovery Company. All Rights Reserved.

                "title": "LA fires: What's happening in Los Angeles, and what caused the wildfires?",
                "content": "At least 25 people have died in the Los Angeles fires as two major blazes continue to burn across the sprawling US city. Firefighters made progress over the weekend in containing the Palisades and Eaton fires but warn that the return of high winds - forecast until Wednesday - could see these two spread again, or fuel new ones. The fires are already among the most destructive in LA's history when measured by the number of buildings destroyed. Rebuilding work will cost \"tens of billions\" of dollars, US President Joe Biden has said. An area to the north-west of the city centre is described by officials as \"particularly dangerous\". A red flag warning - indicating a high level of fire danger - is in place until 18:00 (02:00 GMT) on Wednesday, with the strongest Santa Ana winds expected on Tuesday. Nearby, the largest fire is in the Palisades area, and has burnt through more than 23,000 acres. It is still only about 14% contained, despite the efforts of thousands of firefighters. The blaze is moving east, threatening the exclusive neighbourhood of Brentwood, home to the Getty Center, a world-famous art museum that has evacuated its staff. Another fire, Eaton, is more deadly than Palisades so far - responsible for 16 of the deaths. The overall destruction is immense, with more than 12,000 structures - homes, outbuildings, sheds, mobile homes and cars - destroyed. Celebrities Mel Gibson and Paris Hilton are among those who have lost their homes. Tens of thousands of homes are also without power. The fires could turn out to be the costliest in US history, with damage projected at up to $150bn, according to a preliminary estimate by AccuWeather. There are three active fires in the wider area, while a smaller fire is nearly contained, say California fire officials: The earlier Kenneth, Archer, Sunset, Lidia, Woodley and Olivas fires have been contained. Containment describes the progress firefighters make in controlling the spread of flames. It is often listed as a percentage. For example, if a fire is 14% contained, that means fire crews have established barriers around 14% of the fire's perimeter. Natural barriers include roads, rivers and oceans. Firefighters can also create barriers using equipment such as bulldozers, hoses and shovels to remove vegetation down to the bare soil, meaning there is nothing for the fire to burn. A fire being 100% contained doesn't mean it has been extinguished, but rather that the flames have been fully encircled and the spread has been effectively stopped. Detectives continue to investigate the possible causes. Lightning - the most common source of fires in the US - has been ruled out as a cause for the Palisades and Eaton fires. There has been no official indication so far that arson or utility lines - the next two biggest culprits in sparking fires - caused any of the conflagrations. However, in the case of the Eaton fire, legal cases have been filed against the electrical company, Southern California Edison Company (SCE), claiming there is evidence that the blaze - one of the largest - was ignited due to negligence of the firm's overhead wires. SCE has vowed to \"review the complaint when it is received\", pointing out that \"the cause of the fire continues to be under investigation\". A spokeswoman added that the company \"remains committed\" to supporting communities affected by the fires. On Friday, SCE said authorities were investigating whether its infrastructure was involved in the ignition of the separate Hurst fire. California's very wet years of 2022-23 brought about a huge growth of vegetation, which dried out in the drought of last year, creating abundant kindling. Conditions have been ripe for wildfires thanks to a combination of an exceptionally dry period - downtown LA has only received 0.16 inches (0.4cm) of rain since October - and powerful offshore gusts known as the Santa Ana winds. A political row about the city's preparedness has erupted after it emerged some fire crews' hoses ran dry. California Governor Gavin Newsom has called for an independent investigation into the loss of water pressure to hydrants and why the Santa Ynez Reservoir was closed for maintenance and empty when the fire broke out. \"Losing supplies from fire hydrants likely impaired the effort to protect some homes and evacuation corridors,\" he wrote. LA Mayor Karen Bass, who was on a previously arranged trip to Ghana when the fires began, has faced intense questions about the region's preparedness and the water issues. On Saturday, she deflected questions about her handling of the emergency. Before the fires broke out, the city of LA's fire chief warned in a memo that budget cuts were hampering the department's ability to respond to emergencies. But another official, the LA County fire chief, denied his department had been unprepared. Although strong winds and lack of rain are driving the blazes, experts say climate change is altering the background conditions and increasing the likelihood of such fires. Much of the western United States including California experienced a decades-long drought that ended just two years ago, making the region vulnerable. \"Whiplash\" swings between dry and wet periods in recent years created a massive amount of tinder-dry vegetation that was ready to burn. US government research is unequivocal in linking climate change to larger and more severe wildfires in the western US. \"Climate change, including increased heat, extended drought, and a thirsty atmosphere, has been a key driver in increasing the risk and extent of wildfires in the western United States,\" the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration says. Fire season in southern California is generally thought to stretch from May to October - but the Governor Newsom has pointed out earlier that blazes are now a perennial issue. \"There's no fire season,\" he said. \"It's fire year.\" No one can say when the Los Angeles fires will finally go out. The city is bracing for continued burning and a possible spread amid the latest wind warnings. The Santa Ana winds that fanned the flames are set to strengthen, with strong gusts on Tuesday before the severity is expected to drop. There are now new red flag warnings for dangerous wind storms. The other conditions that fed the fire - dry brush and lack of precipitation - continue as well. Have you been affected by the fires in California? Get in touch here.

                "content": "Jessica Ann Johnson (née Simpson; born July 10, 1980)[1] is an American singer, actress, and fashion designer. After performing in church choirs as a child, Simpson signed with Columbia Records in 1997, aged seventeen. Her debut studio album, Sweet Kisses (1999), sold two million copies in the United States and was led by the Billboard Hot 100-top three single \"I Wanna Love You Forever\". Simpson adopted a more mature image for her second studio album, Irresistible (2001), and its title track peaked within the top 20 of the chart. The album received gold certification by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). Simpson's third studio album, In This Skin (2003), sold three million copies in the United States. During her earlier career, Simpson became known for her relationship with and later marriage to Nick Lachey, with whom she also appeared on the MTV reality television series Newlyweds: Nick and Jessica (2003–2005). Following the release of her first Christmas album ReJoyce: The Christmas Album (2004), which was certified gold, Simpson made her film debut as Daisy Duke in The Dukes of Hazzard (2005). She also recorded a cover of \"These Boots Are Made for Walkin'\" for the film's soundtrack. In 2006, she released her fifth studio album, A Public Affair and appeared in the romantic comedy film Employee of the Month. With the release of her sixth studio album Do You Know (2008), she moved into the country music genre. A second Christmas album titled Happy Christmas followed in 2010. Simpson has sold 20 million albums worldwide.[2] Aside from her musical pursuits, Simpson launched The Jessica Simpson Collection in 2005, a fashion-focused line with 34 product categories which has earned over US$1 billion in revenue. She also starred in the reality television series The Price of Beauty in 2010 and judged clothing designs on two seasons of Fashion Star from 2012 to 2013. Jessica Ann Simpson was born on July 10, 1980, in Abilene, Texas.[1] She is the first child of Tina Ann Simpson (née Drew), a homemaker,[3] and Joseph Simpson, a minister. Simpson's parents married in 1978; they divorced in 2013.[4][5][6][7] Simpson has stated that she grew up in Dallas and Waco, but her parents now live in McGregor, Texas.[8] Simpson has a younger sister, Ashlee.[9] In her preteens she briefly attended Amelia Middle School while her father did outreach in Cincinnati, Ohio. After moving back to Texas 20 months later, she attended J. J. Pearce High School in Richardson during her teenage years, though she had to drop out in 1997 as her career began to take off; a year later she earned her GED via distance learning through Texas Tech High School.[10][11][12] Simpson was raised in the Christian faith, and was given a purity ring by her father when she was twelve years old.[13] Jessica and her family moved frequently due to her father's job as a minister, though they remained in Texas for the most part; however, they did live in the Midwest for a few years.[14] She began singing in the church choir as a child. When she was eleven, she dreamed of success as a singer while at a church retreat.[14] Simpson auditioned for The Mickey Mouse Club at the age of twelve, auditioning with a performance of \"Amazing Grace\" and dancing to \"Ice Ice Baby\" (1990).[14] She advanced through multiple rounds, eventually being a semi-finalist for the show alongside artists such as Britney Spears, Christina Aguilera, and Justin Timberlake.[14] Simpson claimed that she became nervous about her final audition after seeing Aguilera perform, and she was ultimately not selected for the show.[14] Simpson resumed performing in her church choir, being discovered by the head of a Christian music label eventually.[14] He asked her for an audition initially and signed her immediately after she performed \"I Will Always Love You\" (1973) by Dolly Parton.[14] She began working on her debut album with Proclaim Records and touring to promote the project.[14] Simpson's father later claimed that she had to quit touring as the size of her breasts led to her being deemed too \"sexual\" for the genre.[14] Her debut album, Jessica, remained unreleased after Proclaim Records went bankrupt; despite this, her grandmother funded a limited pressing of the album personally.[15][16] Shortly after this, Simpson landed several auditions as Jessica was sent to numerous labels and producers.[14] Ultimately, she caught the attention of Tommy Mottola, then married to Mariah Carey and the head of Columbia Records.[14] He went on to sign her to the label at the behest of Columbia talent scout Teresa LaBarbera Whites, claiming \"She had a great little look and a great attitude, a fresh new face, and something a bit different than Britney and all of them; she could actually sing.\"[14] Simpson began working on her debut album in Orlando, Florida.[14] Mottola hoped to market Simpson as a contrast to Spears and Aguilera, both of whom had launched successful careers focused on dancing and sexuality.[14] While working on her musical debut, Simpson enlisted her father Joe as her manager; her mother became her stylist.[17] While at a Christmas party in 1998, Simpson met 98 Degrees singer Nick Lachey, and the two began dating; Lachey claimed that he left the party and told his mother that he would marry Simpson someday.[14] Simpson began working on her debut studio album in 1998. Her debut single, \"I Wanna Love You Forever\", was released on September 28, 1999.[18][19] The single became a success, reaching number three on the Billboard Hot 100 chart in the United States.[20] The song earned a platinum certification from the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) for sales exceeding one million copies in the country.[21] Simpson's debut studio album, Sweet Kisses, was released on November 23, 1999.[22] The album sold 65,000 copies in its first week of release, debuting at number sixty-five on the Billboard 200 chart in the United States.[23] The album also saw success in several European countries.[24][25] The following year, \"Where You Are\" was released as the second single from the album; Simpson's boyfriend Nick Lachey was featured on the track.[26] Simpson went on to announce her plans to remain abstinent until marriage.[27] \"I Think I'm in Love with You\" served as the album's third and final single and achieved success in the United States.[28] With the success of the album's third single, Sweet Kisses rose to a new peak of number twenty-five on the Billboard 200 in August 2000.[28] The album sold over two million copies in the United States, earning a double platinum certification from the RIAA.[29] Simpson embarked on the Heat It Up Tour with her boyfriend's band, 98 Degrees, as their opening act to promote Sweet Kisses throughout 2000.[30] Work on her second album began in 2000; during the recording of the album, Simpson adopted a more mature public image.[31] In a July 2001, Simpson explained \"I recorded [Sweet Kisses] when I was seventeen years old and I'm twenty-one [this month] so there is four years of growth involved.\"[32] While working on the record, Simpson ended her relationship with Lachey to focus on furthering her career; however, the two reconciled romantically that September.[30] Simpson released the record's title track, \"Irresistible\" as the lead single from the project in April 2001.[33] The single became her second top twenty hit on the Billboard Hot 100 chart.[34][35] Simpson released her second studio album, Irresistible, on May 25, 2001.[36] The album sold 127,000 copies in the United States during its first week of release, debuting at number six on the Billboard 200 chart.[37] Though the album's first week sales nearly doubled those of her previous effort, Irresistible failed to match the success of her debut album; the record earned a gold certification from the RIAA for sales of 500,000 copies.[29] \"A Little Bit\", the album's second and final single, failed to achieve significant success. In July, Simpson began performing as a co-headliner on the Total Request Live Tour for the tour's first 14 dates, alongside artists such as Destiny's Child and Nelly.[38][39] On August 7, Simpson embarked on the DreamChaser Tour, a 15-date tour of North America.[40] Simpson announced her engagement to Nick Lachey in February 2002,[41] with the two holding their wedding ceremony on October 26 in Austin, Texas.[42] Simpson also began working on her third studio album in 2002. On July 14, 2003, she released the album's lead single, \"Sweetest Sin\", but the song failed to achieve commercial success. Beginning in 2003, Simpson and Lachey began appearing in the MTV show Newlyweds: Nick and Jessica.[43] The show premiered on August 19, 2003 and focused on the couple's marriage and the recording of Simpson's third studio album.[44][45] The show became a pop culture phenomenon instantly, with Simpson's perceived \"dumb blonde\" antics on the show helping to make the couple a household name.[46][47] The series was a ratings success for MTV and aired for three seasons until 2005.[47] Simpson released her third studio album, In This Skin on August 19, 2003. It was released the day that Newlyweds: Nick and Jessica premiered, with the show serving as a promotional tool for the record. In This Skin debuted at number ten on the Billboard 200, selling 64,000 copies in its first week of release.[48] The album's opening numbers served as the lowest of Simpson's career at the time, and by December 2003 had sold over 565,000 copies in the United States.[48] Simpson released \"With You\" as the second single from the album in October.[49] The single became a hit, reaching the top twenty of the Billboard Hot 100 and topping the Mainstream Top 40 chart based on radio airplay.[28] Simpson appeared in the halftime show of the Super Bowl XXXVIII. She recorded new material for a re-release of In This Skin, which was released in March 2004.[50][51][52] The re-release aided in album sales dramatically; In This Skin went on to sell three million copies in the United States.[53] In 2004 \"Take My Breath Away\" and \"Angels\" were released as singles from the re-release.[54] Simpson and Lachey starred in the ABC special The Nick and Jessica Variety Hour in April, which featured guest appearances by celebrities such as Jewel and Mr. T, among others.[55] That same month, with Randi Shinder, she launched the cosmetics line Jessica Simpson Dessert Beauty; all of the products in the line were edible.[56][57] Simpson embarked on the North American Reality Tour beginning in June through October; the tour was a financial success.[58] During this time, Simpson and her husband began making guest appearances on The Ashlee Simpson Show, chronicling the start of Jessica's sister's music career.[59] Simpson's fourth studio album, a collection of Christmas-themed songs titled ReJoyce: The Christmas Album, was released on November 23, 2004.[60] The album reached a peak of number fourteen on the Billboard 200, and was certified gold by the RIAA for sales exceeding 500,000 copies.[61] Also in 2004, Simpson filmed a sitcom pilot for ABC, which the network did not pick up.[62] In February 2005, Simpson and Shinder launched the Dessert Treats edible cosmetics line, similar to their prior line but targeted towards a younger audience. Following two lawsuits regarding copyright and accounting, both lines were discontinued.[56][63] Simpson performed \"The Star-Spangled Banner\" at the Indy 500 in 2005.[64] Simpson launched The Jessica Simpson Collection in 2005, initially partnering with Tarrant Apparel Group to release the Princy and JS by Jessica Simpson clothing lines.[65] The company has continued to grow throughout the years, and in 2014 was reported to earn $1 billion in annual sales.[66] Simpson made her film debut as Daisy Duke in the film adaption of The Dukes of Hazzard (2005).[67] While the film was met with negative reviews from film critics generally, it grossed over $111 million worldwide.[68] To promote the film, Simpson recorded \"These Boots Are Made For Walkin'\", a cover of the Nancy Sinatra song with additional lyrics.[69] The song entered the top twenty of the Billboard Hot 100, becoming one Simpson's most successful singles to date.[70] The music video, which featured Simpson in character as Daisy Duke, was controversial for featuring Simpson in \"revealing\" outfits and washing the General Lee car in her bikini.[71] In November 2005, Simpson and Lachey announced they were separating.[72] Simpson filed for divorce in December 2005, citing \"irreconcilable differences.\"[73] Their divorce was publicized worldwide and finalized on June 30, 2006.[74] Simpson began working on her fifth studio album in 2005.

It debuted at number five on the Billboard 200 with first-week sales of 101,000 copies.[28] The album failed to match the success of In This Skin (2003), selling just over 500,000 copies in the United States.[29] The empowerment anthem \"I Belong to Me\", which served as the album's second and final single, failed to achieve commercial success.[78] Simpson starred alongside Dane Cook and Dax Shepard in the comedy film Employee of the Month, released that October.[79] The film received a negative critical reaction and failed to achieve commercial success.[80] Simpson performed a cover of the Dolly Parton song \"9 to 5\" as a tribute to the artist at the Kennedy Center Awards in December 2006, though her performance was cut from the broadcast.[81][82] Simpson had an on-again, off-again relationship with singer-songwriter John Mayer from August 2006 to May 2007.[83][84] Simpson described her relationship with Mayer in her 2020 memoir, Open Book.[83] In November 2007, Simpson began dating Dallas Cowboys quarterback Tony Romo. Cowboys fans considered the relationship controversial, as some blamed Simpson for Romo's poor performance in games after the pair got together. Some fans dubbed Simpson \"Yoko Romo,\" a reference to Yoko Ono, to whom many fans of The Beatles attributed the quartet disbanding in 1970.[85] Even then-president George W. Bush commented on the pair's relationship, blaming Simpson implicitly for Romo's lackluster performances.[86] Simpson and Romo ended their relationship in July 2009.[87] Simpson also appeared alongside Luke Wilson in the film Blonde Ambition (2007); it had a limited release in Texas before being released on home media.[88] Later, she starred in the direct-to-video film Private Valentine: Blonde & Dangerous (2008), portraying an actress who joins the military. The film received a negative reaction overwhelmingly upon its release.[89] Simpson collaborated with Parlux Fragrances to launch her first scent, Fancy, in 2008. The fragrance received a positive commercial reaction.[90] Simpson began working on her sixth studio album, a country music inspired record, in 2007.[91] Simpson claimed to have grown up around country music, and wanted to \"give something back.\"[92] She released \"Come On Over\" as the project's lead single on June 20, 2008.[93] The song debuted at number forty-one on the Billboard Hot Country Songs chart, making it the highest debut for an artist's first entry on that chart.[94] Do You Know was released on September 9, 2008.[95] The project sold 65,000 copies in its first week of release, debuting at number four on the Billboard 200 chart.[96] The album has sold just over 200,000 copies in the United States as of 2012.[97] Simpson opened for country music group Rascal Flatts on their Bob That Head Tour from January to March 2009.[98] Simpson's VH1 documentary series, The Price of Beauty, began airing in March 2010. The series followed Simpson around the world, introducing viewers to the different perceptions of beauty in different cultures.[99][100][101] The premiere episode attracted one million viewers.[102][103] Simpson revealed that the series would return in 2011 with a format change, but these plans never came to fruition.[104] On October 12, 2010, Epic Records released the compilation Playlist: The Very Best of Jessica Simpson, the final release of her three-album contract with the label.[105] Simpson signed a new recording contract with eleveneleven and Primary Wave Music and released her Christmas-themed seventh studio album.

Numerous songs on her fifth studio album feature elements of dance and disco music, including \"A Public Affair\" and her cover of \"You Spin Me Round (Like a Record)\".[143][144] Inspired by artists such as Faith Hill, Shania Twain, and Martina McBride, Simpson recorded a country music album titled Do You Know (2008).[145] Throughout her career, Simpson has delved into other genres as well, releasing Christmas-themed albums in 2004 and 2010, respectively.[146] Simpson came to prominence as a teen idol in the late 1990s and the media described her as Columbia Records's \"blond response to Britney Spears and Christina Aguilera\", who had achieved recent success with their respective debut albums.[147][135] Her debut album, Sweet Kisses (1999) mostly explores themes such as love,[135] and Simpson announced that she would remain abstinent until marriage.[1][148] She went through a \"carefully orchestrated sexy makeover\" while she promoted her second album, Irresistible (2001).[148] Simpson later described Columbia's record executive Tommy Mottola as abusive, as he attempted to control her image and told her to \"lose fifteen pounds\" after she signed her contract in 1997.[147] Upon Simpson's rise to stardom with the success of Newlyweds: Nick and Jessica in 2003, media critics and the public perceived her as a \"ditzy blonde\" based on her antics and comments on the show.[149][150][151] The Washington Post's Emily Yahr called her \"one of our first reality TV stars, before anyone could absorb the psychological damage it could cause.\"[147] Simpson recalled her time in the show in her 2020 memoir Open Book, saying: \"Nowadays, I see so many people performing their identities on social media, but I feel like I was a guinea pig for that. How was I supposed to live a real, healthy life filtered through the lens of a reality show? If my personal life was my work, and my work required me to play a certain role, who even was I anymore?\"[147] The media also described her as a sex symbol.[152] Simpson's portrayal of Daisy Duke furthered her sex symbol image,[153] and she portrayed the character in her \"These Boots Are Made For Walkin\" music video, which presents \"footage of Simpson writhing suggestively against a suds-soaked motor vehicle.\"[154] The scene was parodied in Pink's \"Stupid Girls\" music video.[155] Simpson also appeared as Daisy Duke in several television commercials for Pizza Hut airing during[156] the Super Bowl in 2006 and 2007.[157] Simpson claimed that the \"[Daisy Duke] role created a \"gold standard\" that she would be judged by in the years that followed\",[153] and the media scrutinized her intensely following her weight gain in 2009.[158][159] Simpson endorsed George W. Bush during his presidential campaign in 2004,[160] though she canceled an appearance at a 2006 Republican fundraiser as she felt it was not \"appropriate\".[161] Simpson praised former First Lady Michelle Obama during her husband's time in office, stating, \"She's such an incredible woman, and she's with such a powerful man...Everything she does she exudes confidence.\"[162] In April 2004, Simpson performed in VH1's benefit concert Divas Live 2004 alongside Ashanti, Cyndi Lauper, Gladys Knight, Joss Stone and Patti LaBelle to support the Save the Music Foundation.[163] In May 2004, Simpson did a benefit concert to aid the Skin Care Foundation.[164] In March 2007, Simpson donated a new Chrysler minivan to the Elim orphanage in Nuevo Laredo. Simpson is Soles4Souls's Ambassador and participated in autographing shoes to donate the money from communities across the United States.[165] Simpson also works with Make-A-Wish Foundation.[166] Headlining Co-headlining Opening act",

                "content": "If not listed, please contact your TV provider. The Diontae Johnson experiment is over in Houston. The Texans announced Tuesday they had waived the former Pro Bowl wideout ahead of their divisional-round matchup vs. the Kansas City Chiefs. Johnson played in two total games for the Texans, catching two passes for 12 yards in the regular-season finale against the Tennessee Titans, and one catch for 12 yards in the wild-card win over the Los Angeles Chargers. The 28-year-old was claimed by the Texans on Dec. 23 after being waived by the Baltimore Ravens. \"With Diontae, unfortunately it didn't work out and we're on to the Chiefs,\" Texans head coach DeMeco Ryans said Tuesday after the news was announced. Johnson, according to KPRC2 Houston, was visibly frustrated after the Texans' playoff win over the Chargers, as teammates tried to calm the veteran down. He caught his only target thrown his way, and played just 16 snaps on offense, good for 22 percent of the playing time, per Aaron Wilson. Baltimore sent the Carolina Panthers a fifth-round pick in exchange for Johnson and a sixth-rounder in October, but Johnson was unhappy with his role in the offense. The wideout was even suspended for the Week 15 matchup against the New York Giants for conduct detrimental to the team before being cut. In the last calendar year, Johnson has suited up for the Pittsburgh Steelers, Panthers, Ravens and Texans. He's been traded twice and waived twice. Johnson now again hits the waiver wire, but it remains to be seen if there will be interest in him from one of the other five teams. He was viewed by some as a potential \"X-factor\" for a Texans playoff run since Houston found itself without Stefon Diggs and Tank Dell at wide receiver, but the team quickly came to the conclusion he was expendable. Houston will rely on John Metchie III, Robert Woods and Xavier Hutchinson behind Nico Collins at receiver. Johnson has caught 391 passes for 4,363 yards and 25 touchdowns in 77 career games played. He made the Pro Bowl with Pittsburgh in 2021 after catching 107 passes for 1,161 yards and eight touchdowns. © 2004-2024 CBS Interactive. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.

                "content": "Michelle LaVaughn Robinson Obama[1] (née Robinson; born January 17, 1964) is an American attorney and author who served as the first lady of the United States from 2009 to 2017, being married to Barack Obama, the 44th president of the United States. Raised on the South Side of Chicago, Obama is a graduate of Princeton University and Harvard Law School. In her early legal career, she worked at the law firm Sidley Austin where she met her future husband. She subsequently worked in nonprofits and as the associate dean of Student Services at the University of Chicago. Later, she served as vice president for community and external affairs of the University of Chicago Medical Center. Michelle married Barack in 1992, and they have two daughters. Obama campaigned for her husband's 2008 and 2012 presidential campaigns. She was the first African-American woman to serve as first lady. As first lady, Obama worked as an advocate for poverty awareness, education, nutrition, physical activity, and healthy eating. She has written three books including her The New York Times best selling memoir Becoming (2018) and The Light We Carry (2022). Michelle LaVaughn Robinson was born on January 17, 1964, in Chicago, Illinois, to Fraser Robinson III (1935–1991),[2] a city water plant employee and Democratic precinct captain, and Marian Shields Robinson (1937–2024), a secretary at Spiegel's catalog store.[3] Her mother was a full-time homemaker until Michelle entered high school.[4] The Robinson and Shields families trace their roots to pre-Civil War African Americans in the American South.[2] On her father's side, she is descended from the Gullah people of South Carolina's Lowcountry region.[5] Her paternal great-great-grandfather, Jim Robinson, was born into slavery in 1850 on Friendfield Plantation, near Georgetown, South Carolina.[6][7] He became a freedman at age 15 after the war. Some of Obama's paternal family still reside in the Georgetown area.[8][9] Her grandfather, Fraser Robinson Jr., built his own house in South Carolina. He and his wife LaVaughn (née Johnson) returned to the Lowcountry from Chicago after retirement.[6] Among her maternal ancestors was her great-great-great-grandmother, Melvinia Dosey Shields,[10] born into slavery in South Carolina but sold to Henry Walls Shields, who had a 200-acre farm in Clayton County, Georgia, near Atlanta. Melvinia's first son, Adolphus T. Shields, was biracial and born into slavery around 1860. Based on DNA and other evidence, in 2012, researchers said his father was likely 20-year-old Charles Marion Shields, son of Melvinia's master. They may have had a continuing relationship, as she had two more mixed-race children and lived near Shields after emancipation, taking his surname (she later changed her surname).[11] As was often the case, Melvinia did not talk to relatives about Dolphus's father.[12] Dolphus Shields, with his wife Alice, moved to Birmingham, Alabama, after the Civil War. They were great-great-grandparents of Robinson, whose grandparents had moved to Chicago.[12] Other of their children's lines migrated to Cleveland, Ohio, in the 20th century.[11] All four of Robinson's grandparents had multiracial ancestors, reflecting the complex history of the United States. Her extended family has said that people did not talk about the era of slavery when they were growing up.[11] Her distant ancestry includes Irish, English, and Native American roots.[13] Among her contemporary extended family is Rabbi Capers Funnye, her first cousin once removed born in Georgetown, South Carolina. Funnye is the son of her paternal grandfather's sister and her husband, and he is about 12 years older than Michelle. He converted to Judaism after college.[14][15] Robinson's childhood home was on the upper floor of 7436 South Euclid Avenue in Chicago's South Shore community area, which her parents rented from her great-aunt, who had the first floor.[3][16][17][18] She was raised in what she describes as a \"conventional\" home, with \"the mother at home, the father works, you have dinner around the table\".[19] Her elementary school was down the street. She and her family enjoyed playing games such as Monopoly, reading, and frequently saw extended family on both sides.[20] She played piano,[21] learning from her great-aunt, who was a piano teacher.[22] The Robinsons attended services at nearby South Shore United Methodist Church.[16] They used to vacation in a rustic cabin in White Cloud, Michigan.[16] She and her 21-month-older brother, Craig, skipped the second grade.[3][23] Robinson's father suffered from multiple sclerosis, which had a profound effect on her. Subsequently, she was determined to stay out of trouble and perform well in school.[24] By sixth grade, Michelle joined a gifted class at Bryn Mawr Elementary School (later renamed Bouchet Academy).[25] She attended Whitney Young High School,[26] Chicago's first magnet high school, established as a selective enrollment school, where she was a classmate of Jesse Jackson's daughter Santita.[20] The round-trip commute from the Robinsons' South Side home to the Near West Side, where the school was located, took three hours.[27] Michelle recalled being fearful of how others would perceive her, but disregarded any negativity around her and used it \"to fuel me, to keep me going\".[28][29] She recalled facing gender discrimination growing up, saying, for example, that rather than asking her for her opinion on a given subject, people commonly tended to ask what her older brother thought.[30] She was on the honor roll for four years, took advanced placement classes, was a member of the National Honor Society, and served as student council treasurer.[3] She graduated in 1981 as the salutatorian of her class.[27] Robinson was inspired to follow her brother to Princeton University, which she entered in 1981.[31][4] She majored in sociology and minored in African-American studies, graduating cum laude with a Bachelor of Arts in 1985 after completing a 99-page senior thesis titled Princeton-Educated Blacks and the Black Community under the supervision of Walter Wallace.[32][3][33] Robinson recalls that some of her teachers in high school tried to dissuade her from applying, and that she had been warned against \"setting my sights too high\".[34][35] She believed her brother's status as a student in good standing (he graduated in 1983) might have helped her during the admission process,[36] but she was resolved to demonstrate her own worth.[37] She has said she was overwhelmed during her first year, attributing this to the fact that neither of her parents had graduated from college,[38] and that she had never spent time on a college campus.[39] The mother of a white roommate reportedly tried to get her daughter reassigned because of Michelle's race.[31] Robinson said being at Princeton was the first time she became more aware of her ethnicity and, despite the willingness of her classmates and teachers to reach out to her, she still felt \"like a visitor on campus\".[40][41] There were also issues of economic class. \"I remember being shocked,\" she says, \"by college students who drove BMWs. I didn't even know parents who drove BMWs.\"[27] While at Princeton, Robinson became involved with the Third World Center (now known as the Carl A. Fields Center), an academic and cultural group who supported minority students. She ran their daycare center, which also offered after-school tutoring for older children.[42] She challenged the teaching methodology for French because she felt it should be more conversational.[43] As part of her requirements for graduation, she wrote a sociology thesis, entitled Princeton-Educated Blacks and the Black Community.[44][45] She researched her thesis by sending a questionnaire to African-American graduates, asking that they specify when and how comfortable they were with their race prior to their enrollment at Princeton and how they felt about it when they were a student and since then. Of the 400 alumni to whom she sent the survey, fewer than 90 responded. Her findings did not support her hope that the black alumni would still identify with the African-American community, even though they had attended an elite university and had the advantages that accrue to its graduates.[46] Robinson pursued professional study, earning her Juris Doctor (J.D.) degree from Harvard Law School in 1988.[47] By the time she applied for Harvard Law, biographer Bond wrote, her confidence had increased: \"This time around, there was no doubt in her mind that she had earned her place\".[46] Her faculty mentor at Harvard Law was Charles Ogletree, who has said she had answered the question that had plagued her throughout Princeton by the time she arrived at Harvard Law: whether she would remain the product of her parents or keep the identity she had acquired at Princeton; she had concluded she could be \"both brilliant and black\".[48] At Harvard, Robinson participated in demonstrations advocating the hiring of professors who were members of minority groups.[49] She worked for the Harvard Legal Aid Bureau, assisting low-income tenants with housing cases.[50] She is the third first lady with a postgraduate degree, after her two immediate predecessors, Hillary Clinton and Laura Bush.[51] She later said her education gave her opportunities beyond what she had ever imagined.[52] Michelle's mother, Marian Robinson, was a stay-at-home mother.[53] Her father was Fraser C. Robinson III, who worked at the city's water purification plant.[53] Robinson's father, Fraser, died from complications from his illness in March 1991.[54] She would later say that although he was the \"hole in my heart\" and \"loss in my scar\", the memory of her father has motivated her each day since.[39] Her friend Suzanne Alele died from cancer around this time as well. These losses made her think of her contributions toward society and how well she was influencing the world from her law firm in her first job after law school. She considered this a turning point.[55] Robinson met Barack Obama when they were among the few African Americans at their law firm, Sidley Austin LLP (she has sometimes said only two, although others have noted that there were others in different departments).[56] She was assigned to mentor him while he was a summer associate.[57] Their relationship started with a business lunch and then a community organization meeting where he first impressed her.[58] Before meeting Obama, Michelle had told her mother she intended to focus solely on her career.[59] The couple's first date was to Spike Lee's movie Do the Right Thing (1989).[60] Barack Obama has said the couple had an \"opposites attract\" scenario in their initial interest in each other since Michelle had stability from her two-parent home while he was \"adventurous\".[61] They married on October 3, 1992.[58] After suffering a miscarriage, Michelle underwent in vitro fertilisation[62] to conceive their daughters Malia Ann (born 1998) and Natasha (known as Sasha, born 2001).[63] The Obama family lived on Chicago's South Side, where Barack taught at the University of Chicago Law School. He was elected to the state senate in 1996 and to the U.S. Senate in 2004. They chose to keep their residence in Chicago after Barack's election rather than to move to Washington, DC, as they felt it was better for their daughters. Throughout her husband's 2008 campaign for U.S. president, Obama made a \"commitment to be away overnight only once a week – to campaign only two days a week and be home by the end of the second day\" for their two daughters.[64] She once requested that her then-fiancé meet her prospective boss, Valerie Jarrett, when considering her first career move;[19] Jarrett became one of her husband's closest advisors.[65][66] The marital relationship has had its ebbs and flows; the combination of an evolving family life and beginning political career led to many arguments about balancing work and family. Barack Obama wrote in his second book, The Audacity of Hope: Thoughts on Reclaiming the American Dream, that \"Tired and stressed, we had little time for conversation, much less romance.\"[67] Despite their family obligations and careers, they continued to try to schedule \"date nights\" while they lived in Chicago.[68] The Obamas' daughters attended the University of Chicago Laboratory Schools, a private school.[69] As a member of the school's board, Michelle fought to maintain diversity in the school when other board members connected with the University of Chicago tried to reserve more slots for children of the university faculty. This resulted in a plan to expand the school to increase enrollment.[4] In Washington, DC, Malia and Sasha attended Sidwell Friends School, after also considering Georgetown Day School.[70][71] In 2008, Michelle said in an interview on The Ellen DeGeneres Show that they did not intend to have any more children.[72] The Obamas received advice from past first ladies Laura Bush, Rosalynn Carter, and Hillary Clinton about raising children in the White House.[71] Marian Robinson, Michelle's mother, moved in to the White House to assist with child care.[73] Obama was raised United Methodist and joined the Trinity United Church of Christ, a mostly black congregation of the Reformed denomination known as the United Church of Christ. She and Barack Obama were married there by Rev. Jeremiah Wright. On May 31, 2008, Barack and Michelle Obama announced that they had withdrawn their membership in Trinity United Church of Christ saying: \"Our relations with Trinity have been strained by the divisive statements of Reverend Wright, which sharply conflict with our own views.\"[74] The Obama family attended several different Protestant churches after moving to Washington D.C. in 2009, including Shiloh Baptist Church and St. John's Episcopal Church on Lafayette Square, known as the Presidents' Church. At the 49th African Methodist Episcopal Church's general conference, Michelle Obama encouraged the attendees to advocate for political awareness, saying, \"To anyone who says that church is no place to talk about these issues, you tell them there is no place better – no place better, because ultimately, these are not just political issues – they are moral issues, they're issues that have to do with human dignity and human potential, and the future we want for our kids and our grandkids.\"[75] Following law school, Obama became an associate at the Chicago office of the law firm Sidley & Austin, where she met her future husband Barack. At the firm, she worked on marketing and intellectual property law.[3] She continues to hold her law license, but as she no longer needs it for her work, she has kept it on a voluntary inactive status since 1993.[76][77] In 1991, she held public sector positions in the Chicago city government as an assistant to the mayor and as the assistant commissioner of planning and development. In 1993, she became executive director for the Chicago office of Public Allies, a non-profit organization encouraging young people to work on social issues in nonprofit groups and government agencies.[26] She worked there nearly four years and set fundraising records for the organization that stood twelve years after she had left.[20] Obama later said she had never been happier in her life prior to working \"to build Public Allies\".[78] In 1996, Obama served as the associate dean of student services at the University of Chicago, where she developed the university's Community Service Center.[79] In 2002, she began working for the University of Chicago Hospitals, first as executive director for community affairs and, beginning May 2005, as vice president for community and external affairs.[80] She continued to hold the University of Chicago Hospitals position during the primary campaign of 2008 but cut back to part-time in order to spend time with her daughters as well as work for her husband's election.[81] She subsequently took a leave of absence from her job.[82] According to the couple's 2006 income tax return, her salary was $273,618 from the University of Chicago Hospitals, while her husband had a salary of $157,082 from the United States Senate. The Obamas' total income was $991,296, which included $51,200 that she earned as a member of the board of directors of TreeHouse Foods and investments and royalties from his books.[83] Obama served as a salaried board member of TreeHouse Foods, Inc. (NYSE: THS),[84] a major Wal-Mart supplier from shortly after her husband was seated in the Senate until she cut ties shortly after her husband announced his candidacy for the presidency; he criticized Wal-Mart labor policies at an AFL–CIO forum in Trenton, New Jersey, on May 14, 2007.[85] She also served on the board of directors of the Chicago Council on Global Affairs.[86] In 2021, the former first lady announced that she has been \"moving toward retirement\".[87] Though she continues to be active in political campaigns, the former first lady has said she is reducing the amount of work to spend more time with her husband.[87] During an interview in 1996, Michelle Obama acknowledged there was a \"strong possibility\" her husband would begin a political career, but said she was \"wary\" of the process. She knew it meant their lives would be subject to scrutiny and she was intensely private.[88] Although she campaigned on her husband's behalf since early in his political career by handshaking and fund-raising, she did not relish the activity at first. When she campaigned during her husband's 2000 run for United States House of Representatives, her boss at the University of Chicago asked if there was any single thing about campaigning that she enjoyed; after some thought, she replied that visiting so many living rooms had given her some new decorating ideas.[89][90] Obama opposed her husband's run for the congressional seat, and, after his defeat, she preferred he tend to the financial needs of the family in what she deemed a more practical way.[91] At first, Obama had reservations about her husband's presidential campaign, due to fears about a possible negative effect on their daughters.[92] She says that she negotiated an agreement in which her husband was to quit smoking in exchange for her support of his decision to run.[93] About her role in her husband's presidential campaign, she has said: \"My job is not a senior adviser\".[65][94][95] During the campaign, she discussed race and education by using motherhood as a framework.[43] In May 2007, three months after her husband declared his presidential candidacy, Obama reduced her professional responsibilities by 80 percent to support his presidential campaign.[19] Early in the campaign, she had limited involvement, traveling to political events only two days a week and rarely traveling overnight;[96] by early February 2008, her participation had increased significantly. She attended thirty-three events in eight days.[66] She made several campaign appearances with Oprah Winfrey.[97][98] She wrote her own stump speeches for her husband's presidential campaign and generally spoke without notes.[27] During the campaign, columnist Cal Thomas on Fox News described Michelle Obama as an \"Angry Black Woman\"[99][100][101] and some websites attempted to promote this image.[102] Obama said: \"Barack and I have been in the public eye for many years now, and we've developed a thick skin along the way. When you're out campaigning, there will always be criticism. I just take it in stride, and at the end of the day, I know that it comes with the territory.\"[103] By the time of the 2008 Democratic National Convention in August, media outlets observed that her presence on the campaign trail had grown softer than at the start of the race, focusing on soliciting concerns and empathizing with the audience rather than throwing down challenges to them, and giving interviews to shows such as The View and publications like Ladies' Home Journal rather than appearing on news programs. The change was reflected in her fashion choices, as she wore clothes that were more informal clothes than her earlier designer pieces.[89] Partly intended to help soften her public image,[99] her appearance on The View was widely covered in the press.[104] The presidential campaign was Obama's first exposure to the national political scene; she was considered the least famous of the candidates' spouses.[94] Early in the campaign, she told anecdotes about Obama family life; however, as the press began to emphasize her sarcasm, she toned it down.[83][93] New York Times op-ed columnist Maureen Dowd wrote: I wince a bit when Michelle Obama chides her husband as a mere mortal – a comic routine that rests on the presumption that we see him as a god ... But it may not be smart politics to mock him in a way that turns him from the glam JFK into the mundane Gerald Ford, toasting his own English muffin. If all Senator Obama is peddling is the Camelot mystique, why debunk this mystique?[94][105] On the first night of the 2008 Democratic National Convention, Craig Robinson introduced his younger sister.[106] She delivered her speech, during which she sought to portray herself and her family as the embodiment of the American Dream.[107] Obama said she and her husband believe \"that you work hard for what you want in life, that your word is your bond, and you do what you say you're going to do, that you treat people with dignity and respect, even if you don't know them, and even if you don't agree with them.\"[108] She also emphasized loving her country, likely responding to criticism for having said that she felt \"proud of her country for the first time\".[107][109][110] The first statement was seen as a gaffe.[111] Her keynote address was largely well-received and drew mostly positive reviews.[112] A Rasmussen Reports poll found that her favorability among Americans reached 55%, the highest for her.[113] On an October 6, 2008, broadcast, Larry King asked Obama if the American electorate was past the Bradley effect. She said her husband's winning the nomination was a fairly strong indicator that it was.[114] The same night she was interviewed by Jon Stewart on The Daily Show, where she deflected criticism of her husband and his campaign.[115] On Fox News' America's Pulse, E. D. Hill referred to the fist bump shared by the Obamas the night he clinched the Democratic presidential nomination, describing it as a \"terrorist fist jab\". Hill was taken off air, and the show was canceled.[116][117] Obama campaigned for her husband's re-election in 2012. Beginning in 2011, Obama became more politically active than she had been since the 2008 election, though avoided discussions about the re-election bid.[118] By the time of the election cycle, she had developed a more open public image.[119][120] Some commentators viewed her as the most popular member of the Obama administration,[121] noting that her poll approval numbers had not dropped below 60% since she entered the White House.[122] An Obama senior campaign official said she was \"the most popular political figure in America\".[123] The positive assessment was reasoned to have contributed to her active role in the re-election campaign, but it was noted that the challenge for the Obama campaign was to use her without tarnishing her popularity. Obama was considered a polarizing figure, having aroused both \"sharp enmity and deep loyalty\" from Americans, but she was also seen as having improved her image since 2008 when her husband first ran for the presidency.[121] Isabel Wilkinson of The Daily Beast said Obama's fashion style changed over the course of the campaign to be sensitive and economical.[124] Prior to the first debate of the election cycle, Obama expressed confidence in her husband's debating skills.[125] He was later criticized for appearing detached and for looking down when addressing Romney.[126][127] Consensus among uncommitted voters was that the latter had won the debate.[128] After Obama's speech at the 2012 Democratic National Convention, the first lady was found through a CBS News/New York Times poll conducted in September to have a 61% favorably rating with registered voters, the highest percentage she had polled since April 2009.[129] Obama aimed to humanize her husband by relating stories about him, attempting to appeal to female voters in swing states. Paul Harris of The Guardian said the same tactic was being used by Ann Romney, wife of 2012 Republican candidate Mitt Romney. Polls in October showed their husbands tied at 47% for the female vote. However, Michelle Obama's favorability ratings remained higher than Ann Romney's at 69% to 52%.[130] Despite Obama's higher poll numbers, comparisons between Obama and Romney were repeatedly made by the media until the election.[131][132] But, as Michelle Cottle of Newsweek wrote, \"... nobody votes for first lady.\"[133] During her early months as First Lady, Obama visited homeless shelters and soup kitchens.[134] She also sent representatives to schools and advocated public service.[134][135] Obama advocated for her husband's policy priorities by promoting bills that support it. She hosted a White House reception for women's rights advocates in celebration of the enactment of the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act of 2009 Pay equity law. She supported the economic stimulus bill in visits to the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development and United States Department of Education. Some observers looked favorably upon her legislative activities, while others said she should be less involved in politics. According to her representatives, she intended to visit all United States Cabinet-level agencies in order to get acquainted with Washington.[136] On June 5, 2009, the White House announced that Michelle Obama was replacing her then chief of staff, Jackie Norris, with Susan Sher, a longtime friend and adviser. Norris became a senior adviser to the Corporation for National and Community Service.[137] Another key aide, Spelman College alumna Kristen Jarvis, served from 2008 until 2015, when she left to become chief of staff to the Ford Foundation president Darren Walker. In 2009, Obama was named Barbara Walters's Most Fascinating Person of the year.[138] In her memoir, Becoming, Obama describes her four primary initiatives as first lady: Let's Move!, Reach Higher,[139] Let Girls Learn,[140] and Joining Forces.[141] Some initiatives of First Lady Michelle Obama included advocating on behalf of military families, helping working women balance career and family, encouraging national service, and promoting the arts and arts education.[142][143] Obama made supporting military families and spouses a personal mission and increasingly bonded with military families. According to her aides, stories of the sacrifice these families make moved her to tears.[143] In April 2012, Obama and her husband were awarded the Jerald Washington Memorial Founders' Award by the National Coalition for Homeless Veterans (NCHV). The award is the highest honor given to homeless veteran advocates.[144] Obama was again honored with the award in May 2015, accepting with Jill Biden.[145] In November 2013, a Politico article by Michelle Cottle accusing Obama of being a \"feminist nightmare\" for not using her position and education to advocate for women's issues was sharply criticized across the political spectrum.[146][147][148] Cottle quoted Linda Hirshman saying of Obama's trendy styles, promotion of gardening and healthy eating, and support of military families that \"She essentially became the English lady of the manor, Tory Party, circa 1830s.\"[146] A prominent critic of Cottle was MSNBC host Melissa Harris-Perry, who rhetorically asked \"Are you serious?\"[147][148] Supporters of Obama note that the first lady had been one of the only people in the administration to address obesity, through promoting good eating habits, which is one of the leading U.S. public health crises.[149] In May 2014, Obama joined the campaign to bring back school girls who had been kidnapped in Nigeria. The first lady tweeted a picture of herself holding a poster with the #bringbackourgirls campaign hashtag.[150] Obama writes in her book about enlisting help for her initiative Let Girls Learn to produce and sing the song \"This is for My Girls\".[151] Over the course of the Obama presidency, particularly during the second term, Michelle Obama was subject to speculation over whether she would run for the presidency herself, similarly to predecessor Hillary Clinton.[152] A May 2015 Rasmussen poll found Obama had 22% of support to Clinton's 56% of winning the Democratic nomination, higher than that of potential candidates Elizabeth Warren, Martin O'Malley, and Bernie Sanders.[153][154] Another poll that month found that 71% of Americans believed Obama should not run for the presidency, only 14% approving.[154] On January 14, 2016, during a town-hall meeting, President Obama was asked if the first lady could be talked into running. He responded, \"There are three things that are certain in life: death, taxes, and Michelle is not running for president. That I can tell you.\"[155][156] On March 16, 2016, while speaking in Austin, Texas, Obama denied that she would ever run for the office, citing a desire to \"impact as many people as possible in an unbiased way\".[157] In the epilogue to Becoming, Obama writes, \"I have no intention of running for office, ever,\"[158] recognizing that \"politics can be a means for positive change, but this arena is just not for me.\"[159] Obama's predecessors Hillary Clinton and Laura Bush supported the organic movement by instructing the White House kitchens to buy organic food. Obama extended their support of healthy eating by planting the White House Kitchen Garden, an organic garden, the first White House vegetable garden since Eleanor Roosevelt served as First Lady. She also had bee hives installed on the South Lawn of the White House. The garden supplied organic produce and honey for the meals of the First Family and for state dinners and other official gatherings.[160][161][162][163] In January 2010, Obama undertook her first lead role in an administration-wide initiative, which she named \"Let's Move!\", to make progress in reversing the 21st-century trend of childhood obesity.[162][164] On February 9, 2010, the first lady announced Let's Move! and President Barack Obama created the Task Force on Childhood Obesity to review all current programs and create a national plan for change.[165] Michelle Obama said her goal was to make this effort her legacy: \"I want to leave something behind that we can say, 'Because of this time that this person spent here, this thing has changed.' And my hope is that that's going to be in the area of childhood obesity.\"[162] Her 2012 book American Grown: The Story of the White House Kitchen Garden and Gardens Across America is based on her experiences with the garden and promotes healthy eating.[166] Her call for action on healthy eating was repeated by the United States Department of Defense, which has been facing an ever-expanding problem of obesity among recruits.[167] Several Republicans have critiqued or lampooned Obama's initiative. In October 2014, senator Rand Paul linked to Michelle Obama's Twitter account when announcing on the website that he was going to Dunkin' Donuts.[168] In January 2016, Chris Christie, Republican governor of New Jersey and presidential candidate, criticized the first lady's involvement with healthy eating while he was campaigning in Iowa, arguing that she was using the government to exercise her views on eating.[169][170] Obama had previously cited Christie as an example of an adult who struggled with obesity, a demographic that she sought to diminish by targeting children since Let's Move! was \"working with kids when they're young, so that they don't have these direct challenges when they get older.\"[171] In February, Senator Ted Cruz said that he would end Obama's health policies and return french fries to school cafeterias if his wife were first lady.[172] In the 2008 U.S. presidential campaign, Obama boasted to gay Democratic groups of her husband's record on LGBT rights: his support of the Illinois Human Rights Act, the Illinois gender violence act, the Employment Non-Discrimination Act, repealing the \"Don't Ask Don't Tell\" policy, and full repeal of the Defense of Marriage Act, civil unions; along with hate crimes protection for sexual orientation and gender identity and renewed effort to fight HIV and AIDS. They have both opposed amendments proposed to ban same-sex marriage in the federal, California, and Florida constitutions. She said that the U.S. Supreme Court delivered justice in the Lawrence v. Texas case, and she drew a connection between the struggles for gay rights and civil rights by saying, \"We are all only here because of those who marched and bled and died, from Selma to Stonewall, in the pursuit of a more perfect union.\"[173][174][175] After the repeal of Don't Ask Don't Tell on September 20, 2011, Obama included openly gay service members in her national military families initiative.[176] On May 9, 2012, Barack and Michelle Obama came out publicly in favor of same-sex marriage. Prior to this, Michelle Obama had never publicly stated her position on this issue. Senior White House officials said Michelle Obama and Senior Adviser Valerie Jarrett had been the two most consistent advocates for same-sex marriage in Barack Obama's life.[177] Michelle said: This is an important issue for millions of Americans, and for Barack and me, it really comes down to the values of fairness and equality we want to pass down to our girls. These are basic values that kids learn at a very young age and that we encourage them to apply in all areas of their lives. And in a country where we teach our children that everyone is equal under the law, discriminating against same-sex couples just isn't right. It's as simple as that.[178] At the 2012 DNC, Michelle said, \"Barack knows the American Dream because he's lived it ... and he wants everyone in this country to have that same opportunity, no matter who we are, or where we're from, or what we look like, or who we love.\"[179] In May 2009, Obama delivered the commencement speech at a graduating ceremony at UC Merced in Merced County, California, the address being praised afterward by students who found her relatable. Kevin Fagan of the San Francisco Chronicle wrote that there was chemistry between Obama and the students.[180] In August 2013, Obama attended the 50th anniversary ceremony for the March on Washington at the Lincoln Memorial. Positive attention was brought to Obama's attire, a black sleeveless dress with red flowers, designed by Tracy Reese.[181][182] Reese reacted by releasing a public statement that she was honored the first lady \"would choose to wear one of our designs during the celebration of such a deeply significant historical moment\".[183][184] In March 2015, Obama traveled to Selma, Alabama, with her family to commemorate the fiftieth anniversary of the Selma to Montgomery marches.[185] After President Obama's remarks there, the Obamas joined original marchers, including John Lewis, in crossing the Edmund Pettus Bridge.[186][187] In July 2015, Obama journeyed to Coachella Valley while coming to Los Angeles for that year's Special Olympics World Games.[188] In October 2015, Obama was joined by Jill Biden and Prince Harry in visiting a military base in Fort Belvoir, Virginia, in an attempt on the prince's part to raise awareness to programs supporting harmed service members.[189] In December 2015, Obama traveled with her husband to San Bernardino, California, to meet with families of the victims of a terrorist attack that occurred two weeks earlier.[190] On April 1, 2009, Obama met with Queen Elizabeth II in Buckingham Palace. Obama embraced her before attending an event with world leaders.[191] Obama praised her, though the hug generated controversy for being out of protocol when greeting Elizabeth.[192][193] In April 2010, Obama traveled to Mexico, her first solo visit to a nation.[194] In Mexico, Obama spoke to students, encouraging them to take responsibility for their futures.[195][196] Referring to the underprivileged children, Obama argued that \"potential can be found in some of the most unlikely places,\" citing herself and her husband as examples.[197][198] Obama traveled to Africa for the second official trip in June 2011, touring Johannesburg, Cape Town and Botswana and meeting with Graça Machel. Obama was also involved with community events in the foreign countries.[199] It was commented by White House staff that her trip to Africa would advance the foreign policy of her husband.[200][201] In March 2014, Obama visited China along with her two daughters Malia and Sasha, and her mother Marian Robinson. She met with Peng Liyuan, the wife of Chinese president Xi Jinping, visited historic and cultural sites, as well as a university and two high schools.[202][203] Deputy National Security Adviser Ben Rhodes said the visit and intent in Obama journeying there was to symbolize \"the relationship between the United States and China is not just between leaders, it's a relationship between peoples.\"[204][205] In January 2015, Obama traveled to Saudi Arabia alongside her husband, following the death of King Abdullah. She received criticism for not covering her head in a nation where women are forbidden from publicly not doing so,[206][207] though Obama was defended for being a foreigner and thus not having to submit to Saudi Arabia's customs,[208] even being praised in some corners.[209] Obama was neither greeted nor acknowledged by King Salman during the encounter.[210] In June 2015, Obama undertook a weeklong trip to London and three Italian cities. In London, she spoke with students about international education for adolescent girls and met with both British prime minister David Cameron and Prince Harry. She was joined by her two daughters and mother.[211] In November, she spent a week in Qatar, her first official visit to the Middle East. She continued advancing her initiative for international education for women by speaking at the 2015 World Innovation Summit for Education for her \"Let Girls Learn\" initiative in Doha, Qatar, and touring a school in Amman, Jordan, where she met with female students.[30][212][213] During the Qatar trip, Obama had intended to visit Jordan as well, but the trip was canceled due to weather conditions. In Jordan, Obama had intended to visit an Amman school that had been constructed with assistance from U.S. funds.[214] In March 2016, Obama accompanied her husband and children to Cuba in a trip that was seen by the administration as having the possibility of positively impacting relations between the country and America.[215][216] Later that month, the first couple and their daughters traveled to Argentina,[217] meeting with Argentine president Mauricio Macri.[218][219] Obama campaigned for Democratic candidates in the 2010 midterm elections,[220][221] making her debut on the campaign trail in Milwaukee, Wisconsin.[222][223] By the time she began campaigning, Obama's approval rating was 20 percentage points higher than her husband's.[224] Though Obama indicated in January 2010 that a consensus had not been made about whether she would campaign,[225] speculation of her involvement came from her large approval rating as well as reports that she had been invited to speak at events with Democrats such as Barbara Boxer, Mary Jo Kilroy and Joe Sestak.[226] She toured seven states in two weeks within October 2010.[227] Aides reported that, though viewed as essential by the White House, she would not become deeply involved with political discussions nor engage Republicans in public disputes.[228] After the elections, only six of the thirteen Democratic candidates Obama had campaigned for won. The Los Angeles Times concluded that while Obama was indeed more popular than her husband, her \"election scorecard proved no better than his, particularly in her home state\".[229] Obama was a participant in the 2014 midterm elections, held at a time where her popularity superseded her husband's to such an extent that it was theorized she would receive a much larger outpour of support in campaigning. Reporting her travel to Denver, Colorado, David Lightman wrote that while Democrats did not want President Obama to campaign for them, \"the first lady is very popular.\"[230] In May 2014, Obama was found to have a 61% favorable approval rating from a CNN poll, her husband coming in at 43%.[231] In a video released in July, as part of an effort to encourage voter turnout, she called on voters to be \"hungry as you were back in 2008 and 2012\".[232] Obama appeared at a fundraiser in Georgia in September for Democratic senate candidate Michelle Nunn. Obama's approach to campaigning in Georgia strayed from discussing current events and instead broadly stressed the importance of registering to vote and turning out during the elections.[231] Obama's infrequent appearances came from her dislike of being away from her children and Washington politics as well as her distaste for the opposition by Republicans to her husband's agenda and her view that Democrats in the U.S. Senate had not sufficiently been supporters of her initiatives to end childhood obesity.[233] Obama raised her profile in October,[234][235] touring three states in four days.[233] Obama called the elections her husband's \"last campaign\".[236][237] Obama endorsed Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton and made several high-profile speeches in favor of her, including an address at the 2016 Democratic National Convention in Philadelphia.[238] She also appeared multiple times on the campaign trail in either solo or joint appearances with Clinton.[239] On October 13, 2016, Obama heavily criticized Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump for the statements he made in a 2005 audio recording while at a Clinton rally in Manchester, New Hampshire.[240] A week later, Trump attempted to revive past comments Obama made in regard to Clinton during the 2008 presidential election.[241][242] With the ascent of her husband as a prominent national politician, Obama became a part of popular culture. In May 2006, Essence listed her among \"25 of the World's Most Inspiring Women\".[243][244] In July 2007, Vanity Fair listed her among \"10 of the World's Best Dressed People\". She was an honorary guest at Oprah Winfrey's Legends Ball as a \"young'un\" paying tribute to the \"Legends\" who helped pave the way for African-American women. In September 2007, 02138 magazine listed her 58th of \"The Harvard 100\"; a list of the prior year's most influential Harvard alumni. Her husband was ranked fourth.[243][245] In July 2008, she made a repeat appearance on the Vanity Fair international best dressed list.[246] She also appeared on the 2008 People list of best-dressed women and was praised by the magazine for her \"classic and confident\" look.[247][248] At the time of her husband's election, some sources anticipated that as a high-profile African-American woman in a stable marriage Obama would be a positive role model who would influence the view the world has of African Americans.[249][250] Her fashion choices were part of the 2009 Fashion week,[251] but Obama's influence in the field did not have the impact on the paucity of African-American models who participate, that some thought it might.[252][253] Obama's public support grew in her early months as First Lady,[134][254] as she was accepted as a role model.[134] On her first trip abroad in April 2009, she toured a cancer ward with Sarah Brown, wife of British prime minister Gordon Brown.[255] Newsweek described her first trip abroad as an exhibition of her so-called \"star power\"[254] and MSN described it as a display of sartorial elegance.[244] Questions were raised by some in the American and British media regarding protocol when the Obamas met Queen Elizabeth II[256] and Michelle reciprocated a touch on her back by the Queen during a reception, purportedly against traditional royal etiquette.[256][257] Palace sources denied that any breach in etiquette had occurred.[258] Obama has been compared to Jacqueline Kennedy due to her sense of style[246] and also to Barbara Bush for her discipline and decorum.[259][260] Obama's style has been described as \"fashion populist\".[51] In 2010, she wore clothes, many high end, from more than fifty design companies with less expensive pieces from J.Crew and Target, and the same year a study found that her patronage was worth an average of $14 million to a company.[261] She became a fashion trendsetter, in particular favoring sleeveless dresses, including her first-term official portrait in a dress by Michael Kors and her ball gowns designed by Jason Wu for both inaugurals.[262] She has also been known for wearing clothes by African designers such as Mimi Plange, Duro Olowu, Maki Oh, and Osei Duro, and styles such as the Adire fabric.[263][264] Obama appeared on the cover and in a photo spread in the March 2009 issue of Vogue.[265][266] Every first lady since Lou Hoover (except Bess Truman) has been in Vogue,[265] but only Hillary Clinton had previously appeared on the cover.[267] Obama later appeared two more times on the cover of Vogue, while First Lady, the last time in December 2016, with photographs by Annie Leibovitz.[268] In August 2011, she became the first woman ever to appear on the cover of Better Homes and Gardens magazine, and the first person in 48 years.[269] In 2013, during the 85th Academy Awards, she became the first first lady to announce the winner of an Oscar (Best Picture, which went to Argo).[270] The media have been criticized for focusing more on the first lady's fashion sense than her serious contributions.[51][271] She said after the 2008 election that she would like to focus attention as First Lady on issues of concern to military and working families.[249][272][273] In 2008, U.S. News & World Report blogger, PBS host and Scripps Howard columnist Bonnie Erbé argued that Obama's own publicists seemed to be feeding the emphasis on style over substance,[274] and said Obama was miscasting herself by overemphasizing style.[73][275] For three straight years – 2018, 2019, and 2020 – Obama topped the Gallup poll asking who is the \"most admired woman\" in the U.S.[276][277] Time magazine features an annual \"Person of the Year\" cover story in which Time recognizes the individual or group of individuals who have had the biggest impact on news headlines over the previous twelve months. In 2020, the magazine decided to retroactively choose a historically deserving woman for each year in which a man had been named Person of the Year, reflecting the fact that a woman or women had been named Person of the Year only eleven times in the preceding hundred. As part of this review, Michelle Obama was named the Woman of the Year for 2008.[278] In May 2017, during an appearance at the Partnership for a Healthier America conference, Obama rebuked the Trump administration for its delay of a federal requirement designed to increase the nutritional standards for school lunches.[279] In June, while attending the WWDC in Silicon Valley, California, Obama called for tech companies to add women for the diversifying of their ranks.[280] In July, Obama honored Eunice Shriver at the 2017 ESPY Awards.[281] In September, Obama delivered an address at the tech conference in Utah charging the Trump administration with having a fearful White House,[282] appeared in a video for the Global Citizens Festival advocating more attention to giving young girls an education,[283] and attended the Inbound 2017 conference in Boston.[284] During an October 3 appearance at the Philadelphia Conference for Women, Obama cited a lack of diversity in politics with contributing to lawmakers being distrusted by other groups.[285] In November, Obama discussed gender disparity in attitudes with Elizabeth Alexander while attending the Obama Foundation Summit in Chicago,[286] and spoke at the Bushnell Center for the Performing Arts in Hartford, Connecticut.[287] In April 2018, Obama responded to speculation that she might be running for president by saying she has \"never had the passion for politics\" and that \"there are millions of women who are inclined and do have the passion for politics.\"[288] On January 2, 2021, Obama encouraged Georgia residents to vote in the state's runoff in the U.S. Senate election and to contact VoteRiders, a non-profit voter ID education organization, to make sure they have the necessary ID to vote.[289] On January 20, 2021, Obama and her husband attended the inauguration of Joe Biden. Michelle Obama wore a matching plum coat, sweater, pants, and belt designed by Sergio Hudson to the inauguration.[290] In 2021, she was inducted into the National Women's Hall of Fame.[291] On April 28, 2023, Obama, along with actress Kate Capshaw, joined Bruce Springsteen on stage during his show in Barcelona where they provided backing vocals and tambourine on Springsteen's song \"Glory Days\".[292] Amid media speculation over the candidacy of President Biden, Obama's office announced in March 2024 that she would not be running for president in the 2024 United States presidential election.[293] According to a Reuters/Ipsos public opinion poll among 892 registered voters released on July 2, 2024, Michelle Obama was the only listed Democrat option who would defeat Trump in a confrontation, with 50% of the votes for Obama versus 39% for Trump. 55% of the voters also had a favourable view of Obama versus 42% toward Trump.[294][295] On August 20, 2024, Obama gave the next-to-last address on the second night of the 2024 Democratic National Convention and then introduced the final speaker, her husband, former president Barack Obama. The New York Times called her speech \"electrifying\" and suggested she had outshone her husband.[296] Obama's memoir, Becoming, was released in November 2018.[297] By November 2019, it had sold 11.5 million copies.[298] A documentary titled Becoming, which chronicles Obama's book tour promoting the memoir, was released on Netflix on May 6, 2020.[299][300] She received the Grammy Award for Best Audio Book, Narration & Storytelling Recording in 2020.[301] In July 2020, she premiered a podcast titled The Michelle Obama Podcast.[302][303] In February 2021, Obama was announced as an executive producer and presenter on a children's cooking show, Waffles + Mochi.[304] It was released by Netflix on March 16, 2021.[305][306] On September 11, 2021, the Obamas attended a 9/11 memorial to commemorate the 20th anniversary of the attacks.[307] More recently, Regina Hicks had signed a deal with Netflix alongside her and Barack's Higher Ground production company to develop comedies.[308] She received two Children's and Family Emmy Awards at the 1st Children's and Family Emmy Awards: for Outstanding Short Form Program (We the People) and Outstanding Preschool Animated Series (Ada Twist, Scientist).[309] Obama has made occasional guest appearances on TV shows, often portraying herself: iCarly in 2012, Parks and Recreation in 2014, NCIS in 2016, and Black-ish in 2022. She received a Black Reel Awards for Television nomination for Outstanding Guest Actress, Comedy Series for her role in Black-ish.[310] She produced the documentary film Crip Camp (2020) and the biographical drama film Rustin (2023). On July 21, 2022, it was announced that Obama's next book, The Light We Carry: Overcoming in Uncertain Times, would be published in November 2022.[311] The book was published by Penguin Random House.[312] In 2023, Obama received Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Hosted Nonfiction Series or Special nomination at the 75th Primetime Creative Arts Emmy Awards for the Netflix documentary film The Light We Carry: Michelle Obama and Oprah Winfrey.[313] In November 2023, Obama was named to the BBC's 100 Women list.[314]",

She is the first African-American First Lady of the United States. Through her four main initiatives, she became a role model for women and an advocate for healthy families, service members and their families, higher education, and international adolescent girls education. Each of us also comes here tonight,” Michelle Obama told the Democratic National Convention in 2008, “by way of our own improbable journey” and “driven by a simple belief that . . . we have an obligation to fight for the world as it should be.” Michelle Obama’s journey began in the South Side of Chicago, where Fraser and Marian Robinson instilled in their daughter a heartfelt commitment to family, hard work, and education. Her father was a pump operator for the Chicago Water Department, while her mother stayed at home to care for Michelle and her older brother Craig. As she watched her father refuse to give in to multiple sclerosis, use two canes to get to his job, and save money to send her to college, she learned that “the only limit to the height of your achievements is the reach of your dreams and your willingness to work hard for them.” Michelle earned a bachelor’s degree from Princeton University and a juris doctor degree from Harvard Law School. In 1988, she returned to Chicago to join the firm of Sidley Austin. It was there that she met Barack Obama, a summer associate she was assigned to advise. They were married in 1992. By that time Michelle had turned her energies to public service. She was assistant commissioner of planning and development in Chicago’s City Hall before becoming the founding executive director of the Chicago chapter of Public Allies, an AmeriCorps program that prepares young people for public service. In 1996, she joined the University of Chicago as associate dean of student services, where she developed the university’s first community service program. In 2002, she went to work for the University of Chicago Medical Center, where in 2005 she became the vice president of community and external affairs. During these years the Obamas’ daughters Malia and Sasha were born. As first lady, Michelle Obama initiated Let’s Move! a program aiming to end childhood obesity within a generation. Through it, elected officials, business leaders, educators, parents, and faith leaders worked together to provide more nutritious food in schools, bring healthy and affordable food into underserved communities, plant vegetable gardens across America, and provide new opportunities for kids to be more active. Each year local schoolchildren helped plant and harvest the garden she started on the White House South Lawn. Its vegetables and fruits were served at the White House and donated to soup kitchens and food banks. During Barack Obama’s second term Michelle spearheaded the Reach Higher Initiative to help students understand job opportunities and the education and skills they need for those jobs. She encouraged young people to continue their education past high school in technical schools and community colleges as well as at colleges and universities. Worldwide, she championed the education of girls and women. In a commencement address at the City College of New York she told graduates, “Never view your challenges as obstacles.” It is a lesson she has embodied all her life. Throughout her time in the White House Mrs. Obama worked to support veterans and military families. She also focused her energies on what she calls her most important role: MominChief to her daughters, who grew into accomplished young women during their eight years in the White House.

She is the first African-American First Lady of the United States. Through her four main initiatives, she has become a role model for women and an advocate for healthy families, service members and their families, higher education, and international adolescent girls education. When people ask First Lady Michelle Obama to describe herself, she doesn't hesitate to say that first and foremost, she is Malia and Sasha's mom. But before she was a mother — or a wife, lawyer, or public servant — she was Fraser and Marian Robinson's daughter. The Robinsons lived in a brick bungalow on the South Side of Chicago. Fraser was a pump operator for the Chicago Water Department, and despite being diagnosed with multiple sclerosis at a young age, he hardly ever missed a day of work. Marian stayed home to raise Michelle and her older brother Craig, skillfully managing a busy household filled with love, laughter, and important life lessons. A product of Chicago public schools, Michelle Robinson studied sociology and African-American studies at Princeton University. After graduating from Harvard Law School in 1988, she joined the Chicago law firm Sidley & Austin, where she later met Barack Obama, the man who would become the love of her life. After a few years, Mrs. Obama decided her true calling was working with people to serve their communities and their neighbors. She served as assistant commissioner of planning and development in Chicago's City Hall before becoming the founding executive director of the Chicago chapter of Public Allies, an AmeriCorps program that prepares youth for public service. In 1996, Mrs. Obama joined the University of Chicago with a vision of bringing campus and community together. As Associate Dean of Student Services, she developed the university's first community service program, and under her leadership as Vice President of Community and External Affairs for the University of Chicago Medical Center, volunteerism skyrocketed. Mrs. Obama has continued her efforts to support and inspire young people during her time as First Lady. In 2010, she launched Let’s Move!, bringing together community leaders, educators, medical professionals, parents, and others in a nationwide effort to address the challenge of childhood obesity. Let’s Move! has an ambitious goal: to solve the epidemic of childhood obesity within a generation. Whether it's providing healthier food in our schools, helping kids be more physically active, or urging companies to market healthier foods to our children, Let’s Move! is focused on giving parents the support they need to make healthier choices for their kids. In 2011, Mrs. Obama and Dr. Jill Biden came together to launch Joining Forces, a nationwide initiative calling all Americans to rally around service members, veterans, and their families and support them through wellness, education, and employment opportunities. Joining Forces works hand in hand with the public and private sector to ensure that service members, veterans, and their families have the tools they need to succeed throughout their lives. In 2014, Mrs. Obama launched the Reach Higher Initiative, an effort to inspire young people across America to take charge of their future by completing their education past high school, whether at a professional training program, a community college, or a four-year college or university. Reach Higher aims to ensure that all students understand what they need to complete their education by working to expose students to college and career opportunities; helping them understand financial aid eligibility; encouraging academic planning and summer learning opportunities; and supporting high school counselors who do essential work to help students get into college. In 2015, Mrs. Obama joined President Obama to launch Let Girls Learn, a U.S. government-wide initiative to help girls around the world go to school and stay in school. As part of this effort, Mrs. Obama is calling on countries across the globe to help educate and empower young women, and she is sharing the stories and struggles of these young women with young people here at home to inspire them to commit to their own education. As First Lady, Mrs. Obama looks forward to continuing her work on the issues close to her heart — supporting military families, helping children lead healthier lives, and encouraging all our young people to fulfill their boundless promise.",

She became the first African-American first lady in American history. As first lady, Obama visited homeless shelters and soup kitchens.[28] She also sent representatives to schools and advocated public service.[28][29] Obama's initiatives as first lady were: Let's Move!, Reach Higher,[30] Let Girls Learn,[31] and Joining Forces.[32] Some initiatives included advocating for military families.[33][34] She made supporting military families and spouses a personal mission and increasingly bonded with military families.[34] In January 2010, Obama started an initiative, which she named \"Let's Move!\", to make progress in reversing the 21st-century trend of childhood obesity.[35][36] On February 9, 2010, President Barack Obama created the Task Force on Childhood Obesity to review all current programs and create a national plan for change.[37] In 2010, she wore clothes, many high end, from more than fifty designer companies.[38] She wore sleeveless dresses by Michael Kors, and her ball gowns designed by Jason Wu for both inaugurals.[39] She has also been known for wearing clothes by African designers such as Mimi Plange, Duro Olowu, Maki Oh, and Osei Duro.[40][41] Obama appeared on the cover in the March 2009 issue of Vogue.[42][43] She later appeared two more times on the cover of Vogue, while first lady, the last time in December 2016, with photographs by Annie Leibovitz.[44] In August 2011, she became the first woman ever to appear on the cover of Better Homes and Gardens magazine.[45] In 2021, she was inducted into the National Women's Hall of Fame.[46] Obama's memoir, Becoming, was released in November 2018.[47] By November 2019, it had sold 11.5 million copies.[48] A documentary titled Becoming, which chronicles Obama's book tour promoting the memoir, was released on Netflix on May 6, 2020.[49][50] She received Grammy Award for Best Audio Book, Narration & Storytelling Recording in 2020 for audio book.[51] In July 2020, she premiered a podcast titled The Michelle Obama Podcast.[52][53] In February 2021, Obama was announced as an executive producer and presenter on a children's cooking show, Waffles + Mochi.[54] It was released by Netflix on March 16, 2021.[55][56] On July 21, 2022, it was announced that Obama's next book, The Light We Carry: Overcoming in Uncertain Times, would be published in November 2022.[57] The book was published by Penguin Random House.[58] In 2023, Obama received a Emmy Award for the Netflix documentary film The Light We Carry: Michelle Obama and Oprah Winfrey.[59] In November 2023, Obama was named to the BBC's 100 Women list.[60] Time magazine features an annual \"Person of the Year\" cover story in which Time recognizes the individual or group of individuals who have had the biggest impact on news headlines over the previous twelve months.

                "content": "The Cleveland Cavaliers, often referred to as the Cavs, are an American professional basketball team based in Cleveland. The Cavaliers compete in the National Basketball Association (NBA) as a member of the Central Division of the Eastern Conference. The team began play as an expansion team in 1970, along with the Portland Trail Blazers and Buffalo Braves. Home games were first held at Cleveland Arena from 1970 to 1974, followed by the Richfield Coliseum from 1974 to 1994. Since 1994, the Cavs have played home games at Rocket Mortgage FieldHouse in downtown Cleveland, which is shared with the Cleveland Monsters of the American Hockey League. Dan Gilbert has owned the team since March 2005. The Cavaliers opened their inaugural season by losing their first 15 games and struggled in their early years, placing no better than sixth in the Eastern Conference during their first five seasons. The team won their first Central Division title in 1976, which also marked the first winning season and playoff appearance in franchise history, where they advanced to the Eastern Conference Finals. The franchise was purchased by Ted Stepien in 1980. Stepien's tenure as owner was marked by six coaching changes, questionable trades and draft decisions, and poor attendance, leading to $15 million in financial losses. The Cavs went 66–180 over the course of those three seasons and endured a 24-game losing streak spanning the 1981–82 and 1982–83 seasons. George and Gordon Gund purchased the franchise in 1983. During the latter half of the 1980s and through much of the 1990s, the Cavs were a regular playoff contender – led by players such as Mark Price and Brad Daugherty – and advanced to the Eastern Conference Finals in 1992. After the team's playoff appearance in the 1997–98 season, however, the Cavs had six consecutive losing seasons with no playoff action. Cleveland was awarded with the top overall pick in the 2003 draft, and they selected LeBron James. Behind James and Zydrunas Ilgauskas, the Cavaliers again became a regular playoff contender by 2005. They made their first appearance in the NBA Finals in 2007 after winning the first Eastern Conference championship in franchise history. After failing to return to the NBA Finals in the ensuing three seasons, James joined the Miami Heat in 2010. As a result, the Cavaliers finished the 2010–11 season last in the conference, enduring a 26-game losing streak, the third-longest in NBA history. Between 2010 and 2014, however, the team won the top pick in the NBA draft lottery three times – first in 2011 where they selected Kyrie Irving, and again in 2013 and 2014. After four seasons with the Heat and having won back-to-back titles in the 2011–12 and 2012–13 seasons, James returned to the Cavs in 2014 and led the team to four straight NBA Finals appearances. In 2016, the Cavaliers won their first NBA Championship, marking Cleveland's first major sports title since 1964. The 2016 NBA Finals victory over the Golden State Warriors marked the first time in Finals history a team had come back to win the series after trailing, 3–1. The Cavaliers have 23 playoff appearances and have won seven Central Division titles, five Eastern Conference titles and one NBA title. The Cavaliers began play in the 1970–71 season as an expansion team.[9] They set losing records in each of their first five seasons before winning their first division title in 1976.[10][11][12][13][14][15][16] The 1976 team was led by Austin Carr, Bobby \"Bingo\" Smith, Jim Chones, Dick Snyder, Nate Thurmond and head coach Bill Fitch.[17] It was remembered for the \"Miracle at Richfield\", in which the Cavaliers defeated the Washington Bullets, 4–3, in the Eastern Conference Semifinals.[18] They won Game 7, 87–85, on a shot by Snyder with four seconds to go.[18] The Cavaliers moved on to the Eastern Conference Finals for the first time,[18] but were without Chones after he broke his toe before the series opener.[19] As a result, the Cavaliers went on to lose, 4–2, to the Boston Celtics.[20] They made playoff appearances in the following two seasons before a six-year playoff drought.[21][22][23][24][25][26][27][28] The early 1980s were marked by Ted Stepien's ownership. During Stepien's tenure, the Cavaliers made a practice of trading future draft picks for marginal veteran players.[29] His most notable deal sent a 1982 first-round pick to the Los Angeles Lakers in exchange for Don Ford and the 22nd overall pick in 1980.[30] As a result of Stepien's dealings, the NBA introduced the \"Stepien Rule\", which prohibits teams from trading first-round draft picks in successive seasons.[29][31] The Cavaliers went 66–180, dropped to the bottom of the league in attendance and lost $15 million during Stepien's three years as the owner.[29] The Cavs went through six coaches during this span, including four during the 1981–82 season.[29] The team finished 15–67, and between March and November 1982, the team had a 24-game losing streak, which, at the time, was the NBA's longest losing streak.[32][33][34][35][36] George and Gordon Gund purchased the Cavaliers from Stepien in 1983.[31][37] The Cavaliers made the playoffs 10 times between 1985 and 1998.[38] The 1988–89 seasons was the Cavaliers' best season to date, finishing the regular season at 57–25 with a team that included Brad Daugherty, Mark Price, Ron Harper and Larry Nance, and head coach Lenny Wilkens.[38][39] They had their second 57-win season in 1991–92 and reached the Eastern Conference Finals that year.[38][40] However, between 1999 and 2005, the Cavaliers failed to make a playoff appearance.[38] The Cavaliers finished the 2002–03 season 17–65, tied for the worst record in the NBA.[41] The Cavaliers had the No. 1 pick in the 2003 NBA draft, selecting future NBA MVP LeBron James, a native of nearby Akron.[42] On January 3, 2005, the team was sold to businessman Dan Gilbert for $375 million,[43][44][45] and the deal was finalized on March 1, 2005.[46] That year, the team also hired head coach Mike Brown and general manager Danny Ferry.[47] The Cavaliers built a team around James and Žydrūnas Ilgauskas by adding players such as Drew Gooden, Larry Hughes and Anderson Varajao.[48][49] Under this new leadership, the Cavaliers made five straight playoffs from 2006 to 2010, advancing to at least the second round each time.[38] The 2006–07 Cavaliers advanced to the franchise's first NBA Finals, but were swept by the San Antonio Spurs.[50][51] The 2008–09 Cavaliers won a franchise-record 66 games, including a franchise-best 39–2 record at home, but lost the Eastern Conference Finals to the Orlando Magic.[38] Despite the addition of four-time NBA champion Shaquille O'Neal,[52] the 2009–10 Cavaliers were unable to return to the Eastern Conference Finals after losing to the Boston Celtics in the second round.[38] With the Cavaliers out of the playoffs, the focus turned to James' impending free agency.[53] On July 8, 2010, James announced in a nationally televised one-hour special titled The Decision that he would be signing with the Miami Heat.[54] The repercussions of this announcement left many in the city of Cleveland infuriated and feeling betrayed.[55] After a 19–win season in 2010–11, the Cavaliers began a rebuild around Kyrie Irving, whom they selected first overall in the 2011 NBA draft.[38][56] In 2014, James returned to the Cavaliers after four seasons in Miami. While the Heat had a 224–88 record during James' four-year tenure and won NBA titles in 2012 and 2013, the Cavaliers went 97–215 and missed the playoffs each season.[57] The Cavaliers made several moves to build a championship-contending team around James, most notably acquiring power forward Kevin Love from the Minnesota Timberwolves, which created what many fans and media referred to as a \"Big Three\" with James, Love and Irving.[58] The Lebron-led Cavaliers made four consecutive Finals appearances from 2015 to 2018 – all against the Golden State Warriors – winning in 2016.[38][59] The 2016 NBA Championship marked the Cavaliers' first title in franchise history, as they became the first team to come back from a 3–1 deficit to win the Finals.[59] It was also Cleveland's first championship in major professional sports since the 1964 Browns, signaling the end of the so-called Cleveland sports curse.[60] The Cavaliers' roster went through many changes in the 2017–18 season, most notably the trade of Irving to the Boston Celtics in exchange for Isaiah Thomas and other assets.[61][62] Thomas was later traded to the Los Angeles Lakers as part of a trade deadline overhaul that saw the Cavaliers add Jordan Clarkson, Larry Nance Jr. (son of Cavs legend Larry Nance) and others.[63] The following offseason, James declined his player option to rejoin the team, instead signing with the Lakers.[64] In the following two seasons, the team recorded only 19 wins and failed to make the playoffs.[38] In the first three seasons since James left the second time, the Cavaliers won a total of 60 games, missed the playoffs each season and have had four different head coaches: Tyronn Lue, Larry Drew, John Beilein and by this time, J.B. Bickerstaff, who was promoted to head coach for the 2020–21 season after he had been an assistant on Belien's staff the previous season.[38][65][66] In the 2021–22 season, the Cavs finished 44–38 and eighth in the Eastern Conference, and qualified for the NBA play-in tournament, marking the first time the team played in the event. This also marks the team's first postseason basketball since 2017–18 and the first time a non-LeBron-led team qualified for postseason play since 1997–98. The team, however, did not make it out of the play-in tournament, losing the game to the Brooklyn Nets and then to the Atlanta Hawks, ending their season. On March 26, 2023, the Cavaliers clinched a spot in the NBA playoffs, making this the first time since 2018 that the team entered the playoffs, with a 108–91 win over the Houston Rockets. This was also the first time since 1998 that the team entered the playoffs without LeBron James.[67] They wound up losing their first round playoff series to the New York Knicks four games to one.[68] On October 25, 2023, it was announced that defensive end Myles Garrett of the Cleveland Browns had purchased a minority ownership stake in the Cavaliers. Along with his ownership stake, Garrett would serve as an ambassador for the team.[69] The Cavaliers qualified the 2024 NBA Playoffs as the 4th seed in the Eastern Conference, defeating the Orlando Magic 4–3 in the first round, but losing to the Boston Celtics 4–1 in the Conference semifinals.[70] On November 6th, 2024 the Cavaliers beat their all-time franchise \"season start\" win-streak, beating the New Orleans Pelicans 131-122 for a season record of 9-0. [71] After a 128-114 win against the Charlotte Hornets on November 17, 2024, the Cavaliers achieved a 15-0 start, which is tied for the second-best start in franchise history, and the Cavaliers are the fourth team to achieve this milestone, after the 2015-2016 Golden State Warriors team, the 1993-1994 Houston Rockets team, and the 1948-1949 Washington Capitols team. [72][73] The 15-0 start is also the Cavaliers’ longest winning streak in franchise history. [74] On November 19, 2024, the Boston Celtics ended the Cavaliers 15–0 start and 15 game winning streak when they won 120–117, giving the Cavaliers their first loss of the season.

Note: GP = Games played, W = Wins, L = Losses, W–L% = Winning percentage When the Cleveland Cavaliers debuted in the NBA in 1970, the team's original jersey colors were wine and gold. The first jerseys featured the feathered treatment of the letter \"C\" in \"Cavaliers\". In 1974, they changed into the classic block lettering and checkerboard pattern that was synonymous to the \"Miracle of Richfield\" team of 1976. In 1980, the gold shade was changed from yellowish to metallic, and the uniforms removed the checkerboard pattern and placed the stripes above \"Cleveland\" and below the uniform number, the only time the city name was featured in both home and away jerseys. The original logo was that of a swashbuckling cavalier looking right with a sword pointing, surrounded by the team name and a basketball. A modernized swashbuckling cavalier logo was later used by the Cavaliers' NBA Development League affiliate, the Canton Charge. The gold checkerboard uniforms were used as throwbacks in the 2004–05 season to commemorate the 30th anniversary of the \"Miracle of Richfield\" team, while the gold \"feathered C\" uniforms were used again in the 2008–09 season as a buildup to the then-upcoming 40th season of the Cavaliers. The \"Miracle of Richfield\" gold uniforms were used again in the 2015–16 season on special \"Hardwood Classic\" nights to commemorate the Miracle of Richfield team's 40th-anniversary celebration. In the 1983–84 season, the colors were changed to burnt orange, blue and white. The first Cavaliers uniform under the new scheme featured the Cavaliers logo (with a \"V\" in the shape of a hoop and circle above as basketball) in an arched pattern and the player name sewn onto the back shoulder as a patch, with orange being the primary color in both the away and home uniforms. However, in the 1987–88 season, orange was relegated as a secondary color, and blue was used instead as the primary for the away and home uniforms; minor changes in the 1989–90 season include the city name on the blue away uniforms. The drop shadows were also removed. The orange version of the uniform was used again in the 2006–07 and 2016–17 seasons, as part of the respective 20th and 30th anniversaries of the 1986–87 team.[78] The blue versions were worn in the 2009–10 season as part of the franchise's 40th anniversary and as a tribute to the 1988–89 team. Coinciding with the move to Gund Arena in the 1994–95 season, the Cavaliers changed logos and uniforms, adding black in addition to the already existing blue, orange and white colors. The uniforms feature a blue splash in the abdomen area in front. From 1994 to 1997, the word \"CAVS\" on the home uniforms was orange with black lines, while the numbers are in black with white lines; \"CLEVELAND\" on the road uniforms was also orange with black lines, while the numbers are in white with a black line. From 1997 to 1999, the numbers and lettering were slightly tweaked: The word \"CAVS\" and the numbers on the home uniforms were black with orange lines, while the word \"CLEVELAND\" and the numbers on the road uniforms were white with orange lines. In the latter iteration, the blue splash was moved from the right leg to the left leg, surrounding \"CLEVELAND\" on the home uniforms and \"CAVS\" on the road uniforms, with a minor change in striping. In the 1999–2000 season, the Cavaliers opted to go for a cleaner look, eliminating the splash and adding an orange and blue line that runs through the shorts. The home jerseys feature the team nickname and the uniform numbers are in blue with black lines, while the away jerseys featured the city name and the uniform numbers in white with blue lines; these jerseys were used until the 2002–03 season. The logo used in this period was of a basketball on its way down a net, surrounded by a black square and the word \"CAVS\" in blue with black line below. The 1994–1996 black uniforms were revived for the 2019–20 season as part of the Cavaliers' 50th season, as well as the 25th anniversary of the move to Gund Arena (now Rocket Mortgage Fieldhouse).[79] The Cavaliers switched to a modified version of the team's classic wine-and-gold scheme in the 2003–04 season: metallic gold and a crimson shade of wine with navy blue added. The home uniform was white, with the word \"Cavaliers\" in wine lettering with gold trim on the front, the player's name in wine lettering with gold trim on the back, the player's numbers in navy blue, and wine-and-gold trim on the sides. The team's standard road uniform was wine-colored, with the word \"Cleveland\", the player's name and the player's numbers all in white lettering with gold trim, as well as white and gold trim on the sides. The team's alternate jersey was navy blue with the word \"Cleveland\", the player's name and the player's numbers all in white lettering with gold trim, as well as a wine, gold and navy blue checkerboard trim. The checkerboard trim was a tribute to the original Cavaliers uniforms from the 1970s. The logo used was a gold sword piercing through the words \"Cleveland Cavaliers\" in white and navy trim, with a wine basketball surrounding it. The Cavaliers debuted new uniforms before the start of the 2010–11 NBA season to coincide with the team returning to the original shades of wine and gold used from 1970 to 1983.[80] The home uniform is white with a wine-and-gold horizontal stripe trim on the collar, sleeves, waistband and pant legs, the word \"CAVALIERS\" (in block style lettering) in wine on the front of the jersey with wine lettering for the name and number, and white shoes and socks. The road uniform is wine-colored with the same stripe trim, \"Cleveland\" in gold on the front of the jersey, gold lettering on the name and number, and black shoes and socks. An alternate jersey – gold with \"CAVS\" in wine on the front of the jersey, wine lettering on the name and number, white socks and shoes, and the same stripe trim as the other uniforms[81] – was added for the 2012–13 season. All uniforms have the team motto – \"All for one. One for all.\" – stitched on the inside of the collar and the secondary \"Sword C\" logo on the side of the pant legs. The logo used is the same piercing sword logo, updated to the classic wine-and-gold scheme. For the 2014–15 season, a second alternate jersey – and fourth uniform overall – was added, which is navy blue (a callback to the 1987–1994 style) with \"CAVS\" and the player's number in wine with gold trim, the player's name on the back of the jersey in gold and the \"Sword C\" logo on the side of the pant legs.[82] Two alternate jerseys were unveiled prior to the start of the 2015–16 season.[83] The second wine uniform is similar to their regular road jersey, except that it features the arched mid-1980s Cavs logo and white numerals in gold trim. A black sleeved uniform features the wine \"C\" logo in front and was famously worn in the title-clinching Game 7 of the 2016 NBA Finals.[84][85] Their logos for the 2017–18 season newly included the color black to commemorate the victory.[86][87] Beginning in the 2017–18 season, all NBA teams switched to Nike-designed white \"Association\" uniforms and \"Icon\" uniforms in the respective team's primary color. The Cavaliers' Icon uniforms were wine-colored with \"Cleveland\" across the front and the player's name in gold lettering with navy blue numerals both in the front and in the back. The white Association uniforms have \"Cavs\" across the front, with wine color letters and numbers both front and back. All teams have the choice of which uniform to wear for any home game. Also included on the Cavs' jerseys is a small Goodyear \"Wingfoot\" logo, as part of a sponsorship deal with the team.[88][89] Nike also provides a third, alternate uniform called the \"Statement\" uniform. The Cavaliers' Statement uniform is black with dark gray pinstripes, a wine-colored \"C\" trimmed in gold on the front, names in gold letters on the back, wine-colored/gold-trimmed numbers on the front and back, and gold-colored Nike and Goodyear logos on the front. In the same vein as the logo on their 2017–18 jerseys, the black jersey is a nod to the team's former black-sleeved jerseys that they wore when they won Game 7 of the 2016 Finals.[90] For the 2022–23 NBA season, the Cavaliers unveiled an updated logo and color scheme, removing navy blue while reverting to the metallic gold first used from 1980 to 1983, and from 2003 to 2010. The \"C-sword\" alternate logo was retired, and an updated \"V-net\" logo, merging the styles of the 1983–1994 and 1994–2003 logos with the current typeface, was also unveiled.[3][4] With the new logo, the team also introduced three coinciding new uniforms. The white Association uniform features a wine-colored \"V-net\" logo trimmed in gold across the front, wine names and numbers trimmed in gold, and a wine primary \"Cavs C\" logo (outlined in gold) on left leg of the shorts. The wine Icon uniform features \"Cleveland\" in gold lettering on the chest, gold names and numbers, and the \"Cavs C\" logo in wine with a gold outline on the left leg of the shorts. The black Statement uniform – a nod to the black uniforms worn during the team's 2016 NBA championship run – displays a wine \"Cavs C\" logo outlined in gold on the front of the jersey, gold names and numbers, and a gold \"V-net\" logo on the left leg of the shorts.[91][92] From the 2008–09 to the 2011–12 season, the Cavaliers wore special \"mash-up\" uniforms – combining the style from one era with the color scheme of another – on select \"CavFanatic Nights\". Nike also provides a fourth uniform known as the \"City Edition\", which honors the city of Cleveland as well as the state of Ohio: Cleveland Clinic Courts, the team's practice facility and team headquarters, is located in suburban Independence. The 50,000-square-foot (4,600 m2) building opened in 2007 and includes two full-size basketball courts, a weight room, a team room, offices, medical facilities, and kitchen and dining facilities. Naming rights are held by the Cleveland Clinic, which is the team's official healthcare partner. Prior to the opening of Cleveland Clinic Courts, the team used the practice court located on the club level of Rocket Mortgage FieldHouse.[104][105][106] In honor of the Cavs winning the NBA Championship, the city of Independence renamed the section of Brecksville Road leading to the team's practice facility \"Cavaliers Way\" in November 2016.[107] Roster Last transaction: January 12, 2025 The Cavaliers hold the draft rights to the following unsigned draft picks who have been playing outside the NBA. A drafted player – either an international draftee or a college draftee who is not signed by the team that drafted him – is allowed to sign with any non-NBA teams. In this case, the team retains the player's draft rights in the NBA until one year after the player's contract with the non-NBA team ends.[108] This list includes draft rights that were acquired from trades with other teams. The following is a list of past Cavaliers players and other personnel who have been honored as \"Cavs Legends\" – either by retiring their number or having commemorative banners placed in the rafters at Rocket Mortgage FieldHouse.[112][113][114] In 2019, the Cavaliers introduced the Wall of Honor, which honors former players and other personnel, and is located in the newly added North Atrium of the renovated Rocket Mortgage FieldHouse.[118] Note - All personnel who have had their numbers retired or have a similar banner in the rafters are also inducted into the Wall of Honor The following is a list of players and other personnel who have spent at least part of their careers with the Cavaliers that have been inducted into the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame.

TRAILER Locked On Cavs podcast is your daily ticket to stay ahead of the game and the first to know the latest news, analysis, and sports insider info for the Cleveland Cavaliers and the NBA. 04/23/2024 Host 03/09/2023 Cory Darrow As I don’t live in the land anymore, I enjoy tuning into the Pod to get some daily Cavs info. Generally decent discussion, if not somewhat formulaic. Biggest complaint is the constant phrases used by one of the hosts, like “at the end of the day”. Please avoid these sorts of verbal hang-ups, show will come across as more professional that way. Jan 1 Yendoggy So I don’t wanna write a bad review because of the actual content it’s really good, but I’ve literally written into them as someone who doesn’t even really have a particularly sensitive mind for this but the main host has to get a pop filter or something because he is constantly clearing his mouth directly into his microphone, so it is impossible to listen to on EarPods or something because it will just make you insane, even if you’re not sensitive to that thing If you are sensitive to that run away from this because unfortunately it will ruin your day. It’s really as bad as anyone I’ve ever heard and I like the podcast and I’ve written in with the suggestion, but that was months ago and nothing has happened, so I guess he doesn’t think it’s a problem. At times if I have other sounds going, and I don’t use my EarPods, I can listen to it, but it is bad. I mean really bad. He’s constantly pausing to swirl his tongue around his mouth and it is directly into the microphone he does not lean back at all. It seems like he leans in 😆 Please please please a little bit of music underneath your voice would solve it. There’s tons of ways to cover it up. People do it all the time, but they seem to refuse to do it. 11/12/2024 Binglebop22 Hey guys- love the content here. It just sounds like the hosts mic sensitivity is turned up way too high. I want to hear the words without it sounding like he’s chewing gum or eating with his mouth open. So much smacking of the lips , etc,’ makes it harder to listen to. 02/27/2024 True Cavs Fan I know I have been rough on you guys in the past and a little bit in the present but I hope you can at least understand we’re I and a lot of fans of the Cavaliers come from. We are like that dog that has been kicked around all our life and then people look at us crazy when we mess around and bite someone. All I ask is that you treat every episode as if ESPN or FOX sports was listening to your every word. Imagine how much more time energy and effort you would put in compared to what you do now. You didn’t intend this but you are a reflection of me and all other Cleveland Cavaliers fans. And we want you to be the best. So yes I’m harsh at times because I at least want great production and information and it is clear to me that you guys have stepped your game.

                "title": "Manchester City F.C. - Wikipedia",
                "content": "Manchester City Football Club is a professional football club based in Manchester, England, that competes in the Premier League, the top flight of English football. Founded in 1880 as St. Mark's (West Gorton), they became Ardwick Association Football Club in 1887 and Manchester City in 1894. The club's home ground is the Etihad Stadium in east Manchester, to which they moved in 2003, having played at Maine Road since 1923. Manchester City adopted their sky blue home shirts in 1894, the first season with the current name.[4] Over the course of its history, the club has won ten league titles, seven FA Cups, eight League Cups, seven FA Community Shields, one UEFA Champions League, one European Cup Winners' Cup, one UEFA Super Cup and one FIFA Club World Cup. The club joined the Football League in 1892, and won their first major honour, the FA Cup, in 1904. Manchester City had its first major period of success in the late 1960s and early 1970s, winning the league title, FA Cup, League Cup, and European Cup Winners Cup under the management of Joe Mercer and Malcolm Allison. After losing the 1981 FA Cup final, Manchester City went through a period of decline, culminating in relegation to the third tier of English football for the only time in their history in 1998. They since regained promotion to the top tier in 2001–02 and have remained a fixture in the Premier League since 2002–03. Manchester City received considerable financial investment both in playing staff and facilities following its takeover by Sheikh Mansour bin Zayed Al Nahyan through the Abu Dhabi United Group in August 2008.[5] This started a new era of unprecedented success, with the club winning the FA Cup in 2011 and the Premier League in 2012, both their first since the 1960s, followed by another league title in 2014. Under the management of Pep Guardiola, Manchester City won the Premier League in 2018, becoming the only team in the competition history to attain 100 points in a single season. In 2018–19, they won four trophies, completing an unprecedented sweep of all domestic titles in England and becoming the first English men's team to win the domestic treble.[6] This was followed by four consecutive Premier League titles in 2020–21, 2021–22, 2022–23 and 2023–24, as well as the club's first Champions League final in 2021, which they lost to Chelsea. The 2022–23 season saw Manchester City win their maiden European Cup and complete the continental treble in the process, becoming the second English club to do so.[7] The club was ranked first in the UEFA coefficient standings in 2023.[8] Manchester City topped the Deloitte Football Money League at the end of the 2021–22 season, making it the football club with the highest revenue in the world, approximated at €731 million.[9] In 2022, Forbes estimated the club was the sixth-most valuable in the world, worth $4.250 billion.[10][11] Manchester City are owned by City Football Group Limited, a holding company valued at £3.73 ($4.8) billion in November 2019 and majority-owned by the Abu Dhabi United Group.[12][13] City gained their first honours by winning the Second Division in 1899; with it came promotion to the highest level in English football, the First Division. They went on to claim their first major honour on 23 April 1904, beating Bolton Wanderers 1–0 at Crystal Palace to win the FA Cup; the Blues narrowly missed out on a League and Cup double that season after finishing runners-up in the league campaign, but they still became the first club in Manchester to win a major honour.[15] In the seasons following the FA Cup triumph, the club was dogged by allegations of financial irregularities, culminating in the suspension of seventeen players in 1906, including captain Billy Meredith, who subsequently moved across town to Manchester United.[16] A fire at Hyde Road destroyed the main stand in 1920, and in 1923 the club moved to their new purpose-built stadium at Maine Road in Moss Side.[17] In the 1930s, Manchester City reached two consecutive FA Cup finals, losing to Everton in 1933, before claiming the Cup by beating Portsmouth in 1934.[18] During the 1934 run, the club broke the record for the highest home attendance of any club in English football history, as 84,569 fans packed Maine Road for a sixth-round FA Cup tie against Stoke City – a record which stood until 2016.[19][20] The club won the First Division title for the first time in 1937, but were relegated the following season, despite scoring more goals than any other team in the division.[21] Twenty years later, a City team inspired by a tactical system known as the Revie Plan reached consecutive FA Cup finals again, in 1955 and 1956; just as in the 1930s, they lost the first one, to Newcastle United, and won the second. The 1956 final, in which the Blues defeated Birmingham City 3–1, saw City goalkeeper Bert Trautmann continuing to play on after unknowingly breaking his neck.[22] After being relegated to the Second Division in 1963, the future looked bleak with a record low home attendance of 8,015 against Swindon Town in January 1965.[23] In the summer of 1965, the management team of Joe Mercer and Malcolm Allison was appointed. In the first season under Mercer, Manchester City won the Second Division title and made important signings in Mike Summerbee and Colin Bell.[24] Two seasons later, in 1967–68, City claimed the league championship for the second time, beating their close neighbours Manchester United to the title on the final day of the season with a 4–3 victory at Newcastle United.[25] Further trophies followed: City won the FA Cup in 1969 and a year later triumphed in the European Cup Winners' Cup, defeating Górnik Zabrze 2–1 in the 1970 final. This was the club's only European honour until their triumph in the 2022–23 UEFA Champions League.[26] The Blues also won the League Cup that year, becoming the second English team to win a European trophy and a domestic trophy in the same season. The club continued to challenge for honours throughout the 1970s, finishing one point behind the league champions on two occasions and reaching the final of the 1974 League Cup.[27] One of the matches from this period that is most fondly remembered by supporters of Manchester City is the final match of the 1973–74 season against arch-rivals Manchester United, who needed to win to have any hope of avoiding relegation. Former United player Denis Law scored with a backheel to give City a 1–0 win at Old Trafford and confirm the relegation of their rivals.[28][29] The final trophy of the club's most successful period of the 20th century was won in 1976, when Newcastle United were beaten 2–1 in the League Cup final. A long period of decline followed the success of the 1960s and 1970s. Malcolm Allison rejoined the club to become manager for the second time in 1979, but squandered large sums of money on several unsuccessful signings, such as Steve Daley.[30] A succession of managers then followed – seven in the 1980s alone. Under John Bond, City reached the 1981 FA Cup final but lost in a replay to Tottenham Hotspur. The club were twice relegated from the top flight in the 1980s (in 1983 and 1987), but returned to the top flight again in 1989 under Mel Machin. Howard Kendall guided the club to top flight safety in 1990 and the club finished fifth in 1991 and 1992 under the management of active player Peter Reid.[31] However, this was only a temporary respite, and following Reid's departure Manchester City's fortunes continued to fade. City were co-founders of the Premier League upon its creation in 1992, but after finishing ninth in its first season, Peter Swales, club chairman since 1973, was replaced by club legend Francis Lee in February 1994 in a movement supported by fans. Despite this, they endured three years of struggle under Brian Horton and Alan Ball Jr. before being relegated in dramatic fashion in 1996. After two seasons in the First Division[a] and four different permanent managers, Lee resigned from his role as chairman midway through the 1998 season, although remained as a shareholder, as City fell to the lowest point in their history, becoming the second ever European trophy winners to be relegated to their country's third-tier league after 1. FC Magdeburg of Germany. After relegation, the club underwent off-the-field upheaval, with new chairman David Bernstein introducing greater fiscal discipline.[32] Under manager Joe Royle, City were promoted at the first attempt, achieved in dramatic fashion in the Second Division play-off final against Gillingham.[33] A second successive promotion saw City return to the top division, but this proved to have been a step too far for the recovering club, and in 2001 City were relegated once more. Kevin Keegan replaced Royle as manager in the close season, and achieved an immediate return to the top division as the club won the 2001–02 First Division championship, breaking club records for the number of points gained and goals scored in a single season in the process.[34] The 2002–03 season was the last at Maine Road and included a 3–1 derby victory over rivals Manchester United, ending a 13-year run without a derby win.[35] Additionally, City qualified for European competition for the first time in 25 years via UEFA fair play ranking. In the close 2003–04 season, the club moved to the new City of Manchester Stadium. The first four seasons at the stadium all resulted in mid-table finishes. Former England manager Sven-Göran Eriksson became the club's first foreign manager when appointed in 2007.[36] After a bright start, performances faded in the second half of the season, and Eriksson was sacked on 2 June 2008;[37] he was replaced by Mark Hughes two days later.[38] By 2008, Manchester City were in a financially precarious position. Thaksin Shinawatra had taken control of the club the year before, but his political travails saw his assets frozen.[39] Then, in August 2008, City were purchased by the Abu Dhabi United Group. The takeover was immediately followed by a flurry of bids for high-profile players; the club broke the British transfer record by signing Brazilian international Robinho from Real Madrid for £32.5 million.[40] There was not a huge improvement in performance compared to the previous season despite the influx of money however, with the team finishing tenth, although they did well to reach the quarter-finals of the UEFA Cup. During the summer of 2009, the club took transfer spending to an unprecedented level, with an outlay of over £100 million on players Gareth Barry, Roque Santa Cruz, Kolo Touré, Emmanuel Adebayor, Carlos Tevez, and Joleon Lescott.[41] In December 2009, Mark Hughes – who had been hired shortly before the change in ownership but was originally retained by the new board – was replaced as manager by Roberto Mancini.[42] City finished the season in fifth position in the Premier League, narrowly missing out on a place in the Champions League but qualifying for the UEFA Europa League.[43] Continued investment in players followed in successive seasons, and results began to match the upturn in player quality. City reached the FA Cup final in 2011, their first major final in over 30 years, after defeating derby rivals Manchester United in the semi-finals,[44] the first time they had knocked their rival out of a cup competition since 1975. The Blues defeated Stoke City 1–0 in the final, securing their fifth FA Cup and the club's first major trophy since winning the 1976 League Cup. On the last day of the 2010–11 season, City beat out Arsenal for the third place, thereby securing qualification directly into the Champions League group stage.[45] Strong performances continued to follow in the 2011–12 season, including a 5–1 victory over Tottenham at White Hart Lane and a record-equalling 6–1 win over Manchester United at Old Trafford, but a poor run of form in the second half of the season left City in second place, eight points behind United with only six games left to play. At this point, United suffered their own loss of form, dropping eight points in the space of four games, while City began a run of successive wins which saw both teams level on points with two games to go. Despite the Blues only needing a home win against Queens Park Rangers, a team in the relegation zone, they fell 1–2 behind by the end of normal time. However, two goals in injury time – the second by Sergio Agüero in the fourth added minute – settled the title in City's favour, making them the first team to win the Premier League on goal difference alone.[46] The following season, City were unable to replicate the previous year's success. After finishing second in the league, eleven points behind Manchester United, and losing the FA Cup final 0–1 to relegated Wigan Athletic,[47] Mancini was sacked.[48] He was replaced by Chilean manager Manuel Pellegrini.[49] In Pellegrini's first year in charge, City won the League Cup and regained the Premier League title on the last matchday of the season.[50][51] The team's league form then slowly declined over the next couple of years, as the Blues finished second in 2014–15 and then dropped to fourth in 2015–16, although the 2015–16 season would see City win another League Cup title and reach the Champions League semi-finals for the first time.[52] Pep Guardiola, former head coach of Barcelona and Bayern Munich, was confirmed to become Manchester City's new manager on 1 February 2016,[53] with the announcement having been made several months before Manuel Pellegrini left his position. Guardiola's first season in Manchester would end trophyless, with the Blues placing third in the league standings,[54] but the following season proved far more successful, as City won the Premier League title with the highest points total in history and broke numerous other club and English league records along the way.[55] This would prove to be the start of a period of unprecedented success for Manchester City under Guardiola. Between the 2017–18 and 2023–24 Premier League seasons, City won six out of possible seven league titles, only finishing second behind Liverpool in the 2019–20 season.[56] Guardiola also guided the Blues to silverware in domestic cup competitions, highlighted by four consecutive League Cup triumphs in 2018–2021.[57] During the 2018–19 season, City completed an unprecedented domestic treble of English men's titles.[58] Apart from winning all three of the major English football tournaments, they also won the Community Shield, the first time any team has ever held all four of England's primary football trophies at the same time.[59] On the continental stage, the club achieved breakthrough in 2020–21, reaching their first-ever Champions League final.[60] In an all-English affair, City lost 0–1 to Chelsea at the Estádio do Dragão in Porto.[61] The 2022–23 season turned out to be the greatest in the club's history, as Manchester City won their third consecutive Premier League title, the FA Cup final against rivals Manchester United, and their maiden Champions League title at the Atatürk Olympic Stadium in Istanbul against Inter Milan, thereby assembling a rare feat – the continental treble. The road to the Champions League victory included wins over European giants Bayern Munich, who were defeated 4–1 on aggregate,[62] and Real Madrid, who suffered a 1–5 aggregate loss at the hands of City.[63][64][65] The following season saw considerably less success for the Blues, as they won the UEFA Super Cup and FIFA Club World Cup for the first time and became the first English men's club to win four consecutive league titles.[66] City also advanced to the FA Cup final for the second straight year but lost in a rematch to rivals Manchester United. Manchester City's era of sustained competitive excellence coincided with charges of breaching Financial Fair Play (FFP) regulations. In 2020, the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) ruled that sanctions placed on the club by UEFA were not justified, overturning City's two-year European ban.[67] In 2023, the Premier League announced its own investigation of the allegations levied against Manchester City, charging the club with 115 breaches of its FFP rules up to the 2017–18 season.[68][69] Manchester City's home colours are sky blue and white. Traditional away kit colours have been either maroon or (from the 1960s) red and black; however, in recent years several colours have been used. The origins of the club's home colours are unclear, but there is evidence that the club has worn blue since 1892 or earlier. A booklet entitled Famous Football Clubs – Manchester City published in the 1940s indicates that West Gorton (St. Marks) originally played in scarlet and black, and reports dating from 1884 describe the team wearing black jerseys bearing a white cross, showing the club's origins as a church side.[70]: 14–15 The infrequent yet recurrent use of red and black away colours comes from former assistant manager Malcolm Allison's belief that adopting the colours of AC Milan would inspire City to glory.[71] Allison's theory seemingly took effect, with City winning the 1969 FA Cup final, 1970 League Cup final, and 1970 Cup Winners' Cup final in red and black stripes as opposed to the club's home kit of sky blue. City had previously worn three other badges on their shirts, prior to their current badge being implemented in 2016. The first, introduced in 1970, was based on designs which had been used on official club documentation since the mid-1960s. It consisted of a circular badge which used the same shield as the present badge (including a ship, based on the City of Manchester coat of arms), inside a circle bearing the name of the club. In 1972, this was replaced by a variation which replaced the lower half of the shield with the red rose of Lancashire. In 1976, a heraldic badge was granted by the College of Arms to the English Football League for use by City. The badge consisted of the familiar ship above a red rose but on a circular device instead of a shield (blazoned as \"A roundel per fess azure and argent in chief a three masted ship sails set pennons flying or in base a rose gules barbed and seeded proper\").[72] On occasions when Manchester City played in a major cup final, the club wore shirts bearing the City of Manchester coat of arms, as a symbol of pride in representing the city at a major event. This practice originated from a time when the players' shirts did not normally bear a badge of any kind.[73]: 21 The club has since abandoned the practice; for the 2011 FA Cup final, its first in the 21st century, City used the usual badge with a special legend, but the Manchester coat of arms was included as a small monochrome logo in the numbers on the back of players' shirts.[74] A new club badge was adopted in 1997, as a result of the previous badge being ineligible for registration as a trademark. This badge was based on the arms of the city of Manchester, and consisted of a shield in front of a golden eagle. The eagle is an old heraldic symbol of the city of Manchester; a golden eagle was added to the city's badge in 1958 (but had since been removed), representing the growing aviation industry. The shield featured a ship on its upper half representing the Manchester Ship Canal, and three diagonal stripes in the lower half symbolised the city's three rivers – the Irwell, the Irk and the Medlock. The bottom of the badge bore the motto \"Superbia in Proelio\", which translates as \"Pride in Battle\" in Latin. Above the eagle and shield were the three stars, added for decorative purposes. On 15 October 2015, following years of criticism from the fans over the design of the 1997 badge,[75] the club announced they intended to carry out a fan consultation on whether to discontinue the current badge and institute a new design.[75] After the consultation, the club announced in late November 2015 the badge would be replaced in due course by a new version which would be designed in the style of the older, circular variants.[76] A design purporting to be the new badge was unintentionally leaked two days early prior to the official unveiling on 26 December 2015 by the IPO when the design was trademarked on 22 December.[77] The new badge was officially unveiled at Manchester City's home match against Sunderland on 26 December.[78] Note: Flags indicate national team as defined under FIFA eligibility rules; some limited exceptions apply.

It was retired in memory of Marc-Vivien Foé, who was on loan to the club from Lyon at the time of his death on the field of play while playing for Cameroon in the 2003 FIFA Confederations Cup.[86] Note: Flags indicate national team as defined under FIFA eligibility rules; some limited exceptions apply. Players may hold more than one non-FIFA nationality. This is a list of City's official club captains, who are currently appointed via a vote of players and staff. Other players (vice-captains) have led the team on the pitch when the club captain is not playing or not available. Some players have been made captain on a one-off basis to celebrate or commemorate an event, e.g. Oleksandr Zinchenko captained the team in their 2021–22 FA Cup fifth round tie at Peterborough United in support of his country during the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine.[87] Each season since the end of the 1966–67 season, the members of the Manchester City Official Supporters Club have voted by ballot to choose the player on the team they feel is the most worthy of recognition for his performances during that season.

Even in the late 1990s, when City were relegated twice in three seasons and playing in the third tier of English football (then the Second Division, now the EFL League One), home attendances were in the region of 30,000, compared to an average of fewer than 8,000 for the division.[125] Research carried out by Manchester City in 2005 estimated a fanbase of 886,000 in the United Kingdom and a total in excess of 2 million worldwide, although since the purchase of the club by Sheikh Mansour, and City's recent achievements, that figure has since ballooned to many times that size.[126] Manchester City's officially recognised supporters club is the Manchester City F.C. Supporters Club (1949), formed by a merger of two existing organisations in 2010: the Official Supporters Club (OSC) and the Centenary Supporters Association (CSA).[127] City fans' song of choice is a rendition of \"Blue Moon\", which despite its melancholic theme is belted out with gusto as though it were a heroic anthem. City supporters tend to believe that unpredictability is an inherent trait of their team, and label unexpected results \"typical City\".[128][129] Events that fans regard as \"typical City\" include the club being the only reigning English champions ever to be relegated (in 1938), the only team to score and concede over 100 goals in the same season (1957–58),[130] or the more recent example where Manchester City were the only team to beat Chelsea in the latter's record-breaking 2004–05 Premier League season, yet in the same season City were knocked out of the FA Cup by Oldham Athletic, a team two divisions lower. In the late 1980s, City fans started a craze of bringing inflatable objects to matches, primarily oversized bananas. One disputed explanation for the phenomenon is that in a match against West Bromwich Albion, chants from fans calling for the introduction of Imre Varadi as a substitute mutated into \"Imre Banana\". Terraces packed with inflatable-waving supporters became a frequent sight in the 1988–89 season, as the craze spread to other clubs (inflatable fish were seen at Grimsby Town), with the craze reaching its peak at City's match at Stoke City on 26 December 1988, a game declared by fanzines as a fancy dress party.[131] In 2010, Manchester City supporters adopted an exuberant dance, dubbed The Poznań, from fans of Polish club Lech Poznań that they played in the Europa League.[132] In 2022, Manchester City proposed the release of the Connected Scarf, that would contain a sensor tracking physiological and emotional data of the wearer, for supporters in 2023.[133] Manchester City's biggest rivalry is with neighbours Manchester United, against whom they contest the Manchester derby. Before the Second World War, when travel to away games was rare, many Mancunian football fans regularly watched both teams even if considering themselves \"supporters\" of only one. This practice continued into the early 1960s but as travel became easier, and the cost of entry to matches rose, watching both teams became unusual and the rivalry intensified. A common stereotype is that City fans come from Manchester proper, while United fans come from elsewhere. A 2002 report by a researcher at Manchester Metropolitan University found that while it was true that a higher proportion of City season ticket holders came from Manchester postcode areas (40% compared to United's 29%), there were more United season ticket holders, the lower percentage being due to United's higher overall number of season ticket holders (27,667 compared to City's 16,481). The report noted that since the compiling of data in 2001, the number of both City and United season ticket holders had risen; expansion of United's ground and City's move to the City of Manchester Stadium have caused season ticket sales to increase further.[134] Over the last few years, Manchester City has also developed a notable rivalry with Liverpool,[135] currently considered one of the biggest in association football.[136][137] Though the two clubs had been involved in a title race in the 1976–77 season, Liverpool and City's modern rivalry began in the 2010s, with the Blues beating Liverpool to the 2013–14 title by just two points on the final day of the season.[138] In the final of the 2015–16 League Cup, City defeated Liverpool on penalties after a 1–1 draw. The two clubs met in European competition for the first time in the 2017–18 Champions League quarter-finals, where Liverpool won 5–1 on aggregate, ultimately reaching the final and then winning the competition a year later.[139][140] In the 2018–19 season, City again won the title on the final day, with the Blues' 98 points and Liverpool's 97 being the third- and fourth-highest Premier League points totals ever.[141] The following season, Liverpool clinched the title, recording 99 points (the second-highest Premier League total ever after Manchester City's 100 in 2017–18) to finish 18 points above runners-up City. The Blues then regained the title in 2020–21 and outgunned Liverpool in another closely-fought title race in 2021–22, to finish with 93 points to Liverpool's 92. The success of the two teams in the 2010s and 2020s has led to the development of a rivalry between Jürgen Klopp and Pep Guardiola, the managers of Liverpool and Manchester City, with the two previously having been the respective managers of Der Klassiker rivals Borussia Dortmund and Bayern Munich in the Bundesliga.[142] At the end of the 2018–19 season, Guardiola described his relationship with Klopp as a \"beautiful rivalry\" and called Klopp's Liverpool team \"the strongest opponents I have faced in my career as a manager\".[143][144] In September 2019, Klopp hailed Guardiola for being his 'greatest rival ever', after both were nominated for the FIFA Men's Coach of the Year award in 2019, which Klopp ultimately won.[145][146] In a 2019 survey, City fans answered that Liverpool, and not Manchester United, are the club's biggest rivals.[147] Manchester City also have long established local rivalries with Bolton Wanderers, Oldham Athletic, and Stockport County, and more recent competitive Premier League rivalries with Tottenham Hotspur, Chelsea and Arsenal.[148][149][150] The holding company of Manchester City F.C., Manchester City Limited, is a private limited company, with approximately 54 million shares in issue. The club has been in private hands since 2007, when the major shareholders agreed to sell their holdings to UK Sports Investments Limited (UKSIL), a company controlled by former Thailand prime minister Thaksin Shinawatra. UKSIL then made a formal offer to buy the shares held by several thousands of small shareholders. Prior to the Thaksin takeover, the club was listed on the specialist independent equity market PLUS (formerly OFEX),[151] where it had been listed since 1995. On 6 July 2007, having acquired 75% of the shares, Thaksin de-listed the club and re-registered it as a private company.[152] By August, UKSIL had acquired over 90% of the shares and exercised its rights under the Companies Act to \"squeeze out\" the remaining shareholders, and acquire the entire shareholding. Thaksin Shinawatra became chairman of the club and two of Thaksin's children, Pintongta and Oak Chinnawat became directors. Former chairman John Wardle stayed on the board for a year, but resigned in July 2008 following Nike executive Garry Cook's appointment as executive chairman in May.[153] The club made a pre-tax loss of £11m in the fiscal year ending 31 May 2007, the final year for which the club published accounts as a public company.[154] Thaksin's purchase prompted a period of transfer spending at the club,[155] in total around £30 million,[156] whereas over the several previous seasons Manchester City's net spending had been among the lowest in the Premier League. A year later, this investment was dwarfed by an influx of money derived from the club's takeover. On 1 September 2008, Abu Dhabi-based Abu Dhabi United Group Investment and Development Limited completed the takeover of Manchester City. The deal, worth a reported £200 million, was announced on the morning of 1 September. It sparked various transfer \"deadline-day\" rumours and bids such as the club's attempt to gazump Manchester United's protracted bid to sign Dimitar Berbatov from Tottenham Hotspur for a fee in excess of £30 million.[157][158] Minutes before the transfer window closed, the club signed Robinho from Real Madrid for a British record transfer fee of £32.5 million.[159] The wealth of the new owners meant that, in the summer of 2009, City were able to finance the purchase of experienced international players prior to the new season, spending more than any other club in the Premier League.[160] Created in the 2013–14 season to manage the global footballing interests of the Abu Dhabi United Group, City Football Group (CFG) is an umbrella corporation owning stakes in a network of global clubs for the purposes of resource sharing, academy networking and marketing. In addition to Manchester City, City Football Group owns stakes in a number of clubs: The City of Manchester Stadium in east Manchester, known as the Etihad Stadium since 2011 for sponsorship reasons, is on a 200-year lease from Manchester City Council to Manchester City. It has been the club's home since the end of the 2002–03 season, when City moved from Maine Road.[175] Before moving to the stadium, the club spent in excess of £30 million to convert it to football use: the pitch was lowered, adding another tier of seating around it, and a new North Stand was constructed.[176] The inaugural match at the new stadium was a 2–1 win over Barcelona in a friendly match.[177] A 7,000-seat third tier on the South Stand was completed in time for the start of the 2015–16 football season, increasing the stadium's capacity to 55,097. A North Stand third tier is in development, potentially increasing capacity to around 61,000.[178] After playing home matches at five stadiums between 1880 and 1887, the club settled at Hyde Road Football Stadium, its home for 36 years.[179] A fire destroyed the Main Stand in 1920, and the club moved to the 84,000 capacity Maine Road three years later. Maine Road, nicknamed the \"Wembley of the North\" by its designers, hosted the largest-ever crowd at an English club ground when 84,569 attended an FA Cup tie against Stoke City on 3 March 1934.[180] Though Maine Road was redeveloped several times over its 80-year lifespan, by 1995 its capacity was restricted to 32,000, prompting the search for a new ground which culminated in the move to the City of Manchester Stadium in 2003; it was renamed the Etihad Stadium in 2011.[181] In September 2024, Manchester City revealed plans to expand the North Stand of the Etihad Stadium, increasing the total capacity to 61,000. The expanded section is scheduled to open for the start of the 2025–26 season. The project also includes the construction of a hotel, office premises for club staff and a new fan zone.[182] Based on trophy count, Manchester City are one of the most successful teams in England – their thirty-six major domestic, European and worldwide honours rank them third on the list of most decorated sides in England, ahead of Chelsea with 34. The club's first major trophy was the 1904 FA Cup,[183] though they had previously won three regional Manchester Cups before that point.[184] Their first top division league title came in the 1936–37 season,[14] with the first Charity Shield won in the following August.[14] City's first League Cup and European trophy both came at the end of the 1969–70 season, the two trophies also constituting the team's first double of any kind.[14] In the 2018–19 season, City became the first team to claim all of the major English trophies available in a single season, winning not just the Premier League, FA Cup, and League Cup, but also the Community Shield.[185] The 1970 Cup Winners' Cup victory remained City's only European trophy until their triumph in the 2022–23 UEFA Champions League.[186][65] They have reached the semi-finals of the Champions League four times overall, losing in 2016, then winning en route to their first-ever final in 2021, losing in 2022, and winning en route to their maiden European Cup title in 2023.[187][188] Manchester City jointly held the record for most second division titles with Leicester City, both clubs having won the league on seven occasions, before Leicester clinched their eigth title in 2023–24.[189] Man City's first victory was in 1898–99, and the most recent in 2001–02.[14]",

                "content": "The Alabama Crimson Tide men's basketball team represents the University of Alabama in NCAA Division I men's basketball. The program plays in the Southeastern Conference (SEC). Among SEC teams it trails only long-time basketball powerhouse Kentucky in SEC tournament titles, is third behind Kentucky and Tennessee in SEC regular season conference titles, and is fourth behind Kentucky, Texas, and Arkansas in total wins. Alabama was retroactively recognized as the pre-NCAA tournament national champion for the 1929–30 season by the Premo-Porretta Power Poll.[3] The team has appeared in the NCAA tournament 24 times, most recently in 2024, and has made ten Sweet Sixteens, two Elite Eights, and one Final Four in the tournament. Alabama's current head coach is Nate Oats. The men's basketball program has spent most of its history in the shadow of Alabama's football team, but has risen in stature over the past several decades. The program was notable as a regular conference basketball contender in the 1980s and early 1990s under the direction of coach Wimp Sanderson and in the 1970s under coach C. M. Newton. Under former coach Mark Gottfried, the team achieved a No. 1 national ranking briefly in 2003. In the 2003–04 season, the team defeated #1-seeded Stanford in the NCAA tournament, and reached the Elite Eight round for the first time where they lost to the eventual national champion, Connecticut. Under Nate Oats, the team earned SEC titles in 2021 and 2023. In the latter year, the Crimson Tide achieved their best-ever season in program history to that point, earning the No. 1 overall seed in the NCAA tournament. They fell to the eventual runner-up, San Diego State, in the Sweet Sixteen. In the 2024 NCAA tournament, they defeated #1-seeded North Carolina in the Sweet Sixteen, and defeated #6-seeded Clemson in the Elite Eight to advance to their first Final Four appearance in the school's history where they lost to the eventual national champion, UConn. Former coaches with at least five years with the Crimson Tide include the following: Hank Crisp (1923–1942, 1945–1946), Hayden Riley (1960–1968), C. M. Newton (1968–1980), Wimp Sanderson (1980–1992) – Alabama's winningest coach (.692), David Hobbs (1992–1998), Mark Gottfried (1998–2009), and Anthony Grant (2009–2015).[4][5] Other coaches include John Dee, D.V. Graves, Floyd Burdette, and Charles A. Bernier.[5] In 1968, legendary Alabama football coach Paul \"Bear\" Bryant, who was also Alabama's athletic director, called Kentucky men's basketball coach Adolph Rupp looking for someone to turn around Alabama's basketball program. Rupp recommended C. M. Newton, a former backup player at Kentucky who had been at Transylvania University for 12 years.[6] In 12 seasons at Alabama, Newton led the Tide to a record of 211–123. The Crimson Tide won three straight SEC titles under Newton (1974, 1975, and 1976), the only program besides Kentucky to accomplish this feat.[6] Newton also guided Alabama to four NIT and two NCAA Men's Division I Championship tournament berths, prompting the school to name a recruiting suite in his honor in 2006.[7] Just as he did at Transylvania, Newton recruited Alabama's first black player, Wendell Hudson, in 1969, integrating his second team in as many coaching stops.[8] Newton resigned as head coach after the 1980–81 season to become assistant commissioner of the SEC. He was succeeded by his top assistant, Wimp Sanderson. He had been at Alabama since 1960 as a graduate assistant to Newton's predecessor, Hayden Riley; he was named a full-fledged assistant in 1961. In 12 years as head coach his teams averaged 21.8 wins a year, with a 267–119 record, and they won 4 SEC tournaments. They played in one NIT and eight NCAA tournaments making the \"Sweet 16\" five times. Sanderson is the only coach in Alabama history to win 200 or more games in his first 10 years. He was the SEC Coach of the Year in 1987, 1989 and 1990, and was the National Coach of the Year in 1987.[9] Sanderson was best known for wearing garish plaid sports jackets on the sidelines. At one point, Coleman Coliseum was known as the \"Plaid Palace\", and the mid-court logo was painted in a crimson-and-white plaid pattern. Hobbs was hired at Alabama as an assistant coach for Wimp Sanderson in 1985 and spent seven years as an assistant in Tuscaloosa helping the Crimson Tide win one SEC Championship and four SEC Tournament crowns while the Tide made four appearances in the NCAA tournament's Sweet 16. As an assistant, he had the opportunity to coach such All-SEC performers as Robert Horry, James \"Hollywood\" Robinson and Latrell Sprewell. When Sanderson left Alabama following the 1992 season, Hobbs was named head coach. In his first season, the Tide finished 16–13 and advanced to the NIT. In 1994 and 1995, Alabama recorded 20-win seasons and advanced to the NCAA tournament behind the play of future NBA All-Star Antonio McDyess. In 1996, Hobbs led UA to a 19–13 mark and a berth in the NIT Final Four. He resigned his post following the 1998 season after compiling a 110–76 (.594) career record and producing nine All-SEC players. Mark Gottfried served as the Crimson Tide's head coach from the 1998–99 season until midway through the 2008–09 season.[4] Gottfried played 3 seasons of basketball at Alabama under Wimp Sanderson, and the Crimson Tide advanced to the Sweet Sixteen in each of those seasons. He was hired by Alabama in March 1998 after coaching at Murray State for three seasons. The Crimson Tide achieved the highest pinnacle ever for the school in both the NCAA Championship tournament and the Associated Press Poll reaching the Elite Eight in the tournament in 2004 and reaching the No. 1 spot in the nation in the AP poll in 2002, both under Mark Gottfried's command. Gottfried led the Tide to its only SEC Championship under his watch during the 2001–02 season, although the team never won a conference tournament championship during his tenure. For his efforts in 2002, Gottfried was named SEC Coach of the Year by both the Associated Press and his fellow Southeastern Conference coaches. Perhaps his biggest accomplishment as coach at Alabama was leading the Crimson Tide to five consecutive NCAA tournaments from 2002 to 2006, another first for the school that occurred under his watch. Gottfried resigned on January 26, 2009, with 11 regular season games still remaining on the team's schedule. Then Athletic Director Mal Moore named long-time Alabama assistant and former player, Philip Pearson as interim head coach for the remainder of the 2008–09 season. On March 27, 2009 Anthony Grant agreed in principle to become the 20th Crimson Tide head men's basketball coach.[11] Grant came to Alabama after serving as the head coach at VCU from 2006 to 2009. After a mediocre first season, Grant led the veteran 2010–11 team to a SEC West title and a 2nd-place finish in the 2011 NIT. The 2011–12 team endured the suspensions of several star players to finish with a 21–12 record and a berth in the 2012 NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament, where they lost in the round of 64 to Creighton. This was the Crimson Tide's first trip to the NCAA tournament since 2006. In March 2015, Grant was fired by Alabama after six seasons. Assistant coach John Brannen served as interim head coach for the 2015 NIT tournament.[12] On April 5, 2015, Avery Johnson agreed to become Alabama's next head coach.[13] The former NBA coach said he was attracted to the position because he perceived it as \"a big challenge\" in that Alabama is not a \"perennial favorite\" and has never won a championship before.[14] Johnson's 2017–18 team finished with a 20–16 (8–10) record and was invited to the NCAA tournament. The next season, the Tide finished 18–16 (8–10) and Johnson was let go at the end of the campaign.[15] On March 27, 2019, Nate Oats was named Alabama's next head coach.[16] Oats was previously the coach for the Buffalo Bulls, and had led them to three NCAA tournament appearances in the past four years. After a 16–15 record in his first season in 2019–20, Oats' second season brought Alabama the first SEC regular-season title since 2002 and the first SEC tournament title since 1991. The Tide were a No. 2 seed in the 2021 tournament, where they fell to UCLA in overtime in the Sweet Sixteen. Then in 2023, Oats coached Alabama to their second SEC regular season and tournament championship in three years. Alabama returned as the No. 1 overall seed in the 2023 NCAA tournament where they advanced to the Sweet Sixteen for the second time under Oats tenure before falling to San Diego State who advanced to the National Championship game. In 2024, Alabama once again made the NCAA tournament and advanced to their second Elite Eight in program history after defeating North Carolina in the Sweet Sixteen. Bama beat Clemson in the West Region finals to advance to the Final Four for the first time in program history. Oats also holds the best record against AP top 10 teams in Alabama history.[citation needed] Roster The Crimson Tide basketball team practices and plays in Coleman Coliseum, a multi-purpose arena on the UA campus in Tuscaloosa. The arena was built for $4.2 million and opened in 1968 as a replacement for the aging Foster Auditorium. In 2005, the building underwent a renovation in which more seats were added. The arena officially seats 15,314 people. Coleman Coliseum was named for Jefferson Jackson Coleman, a prominent alumnus and longtime supporter of the University of Alabama. Until his death in 1995, he was the only person that had attended every Alabama football bowl game, starting with the Rose Bowl Game on January 1, 1926. Prior to 1990, the building was known as Memorial Coliseum. \"Mark's Madness\" was a student organization named after former Crimson Tide coach Mark Gottfried, which is also a play on the nickname for the NCAA basketball tournament, \"March Madness\".[17] It was created by a group of Alabama students in January 2000 in an attempt to create a more exciting atmosphere in Coleman Coliseum.[18] During the Gottfried era, the Crimson Tide was an impressive 137-27 (.835) in Coleman Coliseum.[17] Mark's Madness was the largest student organization on campus during its time.[17] The end of Mark Gottfried's tenure in early 2009 also meant the end of the Mark's Madness name. After Coach Anthony Grant was hired, a group of senior students approached the UA Marketing Department in the summer 2009 about resurrecting the student section organization. During the first exhibition game of the 2009 season, it was announced that the new name of the student organization for supporting Alabama basketball would be \"Crimson Chaos\". As Crimson Chaos entered its second year, it officially registered as a University of Alabama student group and adopted a new format. In addition to supporting men's basketball, Crimson Chaos expanded to support all University of Alabama sports, becoming the official student group of athletics at the university.[19] The group also tried new things to make the atmosphere in Coleman Coliseum as intimidating as it was in previous years, including adding the \"Roll Tide Roller Coaster\".[20] The newly energized environment Crimson Chaos created in Coleman Coliseum helped the Tide complete an undefeated season at home (for the 2010–11 season) with a 19–0 record, including wins over then #12 Kentucky, Georgia, Mississippi State. The group's popularity garnered even more attention and praise thanks to the late superfan Luke “Fluff” Ratliff. He became the Crimson Chaos president and wore a plaid jacket to almost every game. He was loved by many for his light hearted humor and happy-go-lucky attitude. He inspired many people to follow and share in his passion for the tide hoops program and also other athletic teams around campus. He sparked the basketball program under Coach Nate Oats and continues to be an inspiration to so many.

                "content": "Timothy Richard Tebow (/ˈtiːboʊ/; born August 14, 1987) is an American former professional football quarterback who played in the National Football League (NFL) for three seasons, primarily with the Denver Broncos. Tebow played college football for the Florida Gators, where he became the first underclassman to win the Heisman Trophy and helped lead the team to two BCS National Championship titles in 2006 and 2008.[3] At the conclusion of his collegiate career, he held the Southeastern Conference's records for career passing efficiency and rushing touchdowns.[4] He was selected by the Broncos in the first round of the 2010 NFL draft. Tebow became the Broncos' starter during the 2011 season and revitalized a struggling team, bringing them to the franchise's first division title and playoff victory since 2005.[5] His frequent comeback victories and outspoken Christian faith made him a cultural phenomenon, with his habit of dropping to one knee in prayer on the field becoming known as \"Tebowing\". Due to questions over Tebow's potential as an NFL quarterback, he was traded after the season to the New York Jets, where he spent one year as a backup.[6] After failing to make the regular season roster of the New England Patriots and Philadelphia Eagles, Tebow pursued a minor league baseball career with the New York Mets organization from 2016 to 2021.[7] The same year he retired from baseball, he returned to the NFL as a tight end for the Jacksonville Jaguars, but was released after one preseason game. Since 2017, he has been a regular contributor and co-host for college football programming on SEC Network and ESPN. Tebow was inducted in the College Football Hall of Fame in 2023. Tebow was born in the Philippines to American parents. In the late 1960s, Tebow's parents – Pamela Elaine (née Pemberton) and Robert Ramsey Tebow II – met while attending the University of Florida.[8][9] During that time, his mother was a freshman and his father was a sophomore. The couple married on June 12, 1971, before Pamela's graduation from the university.[10] In 1985, the family moved to the Philippines where they served as Baptist missionaries and built a ministry.[10] During the Tebows' stay, Pamela contracted amoebic dysentery and fell into a coma. While recovering, she discovered that she was pregnant. The medications used to treat Pamela caused a severe placental abruption.[10] Doctors expected a stillbirth and recommended an abortion, which was illegal in the Philippines even in severe cases; the Tebows decided against it. On August 14, 1987, Pamela Tebow gave birth to Tim Tebow in Manila.[10] When Tim was three years old, his family moved from the Philippines to Jacksonville, Florida.[11] Tebow is the youngest of five children.[10] He is of Belgian (Walloon) origin. His ancestor Andries Tebow sailed to America from Bruges in the 1680s.[12][13] He and his siblings were all homeschooled by their parents, who instilled the family's Christian beliefs.[14] Tebow is dyslexic and believes in his uniqueness as a gift from God.[15] He began his high school football career as a tight end for Trinity Christian Academy in Jacksonville. Before the 2003 season, he moved to nearby St. Johns County, making him eligible to play for the struggling football program at Allen D. Nease High School where he could play quarterback. He never enrolled at either school, however: his parents chose to home-school him. Florida law allows homeschooled students to participate on the team of the local high school in the school district in which they live, and private schools such as Trinity Christian Academy are also allowed to let homeschooled students play on their teams.[16][17] Tebow came to national prominence as a junior at Nease, known for his running and throwing abilities, as well as an intense competitiveness. Later that year, he suffered an injury to his right leg late in the first half of a game. At first believed to be suffering from a bad cramp, he actually played the entire second half with a broken fibula, at one point rushing for a 29-yard touchdown. After the game the extent of the injury was discovered and he was held out for the remainder of his junior season.[18] Nevertheless, he was named Florida's Player of the Year and became a major college football quarterback prospect.[19] During his senior season, he led the Nease Panthers to a state title, earned All-State honors, was named Florida's Mr. Football and a Parade magazine high school All-American, and repeated as Florida's Player of the Year.[19][20] He played in the U.S. Army All-American Bowl in San Antonio, Texas which featured the top 78 senior high school football players in the nation and was shown nationally on NBC television.[21] Tebow was the subject of an ESPN Faces in Sports documentary. The segment was titled \"Tim Tebow: The Chosen One\", and focused on Tebow's home schooling and missionary work in the Philippines, his athletic exploits, and the college recruiting process.[22] Tebow was also featured in Sports Illustrated on the \"Faces in the Crowd\" page.[23] In 2007, he was named to the Florida State Athletic Association's All-Century Team that listed the Top 33 football players in the state of Florida's 100-year history of high school football.[24] Despite family ties to the University of Florida, where his parents met as students,[14] Tebow considered other schools, including the University of Alabama.[25] On January 7, 2007, Tebow was featured prominently in an ESPN Outside The Lines feature on home-schooled athletes seeking equal access to high school athletics in other states. Because a home-schooler's access to public and private school athletic functions varies by state, Tebow and former defensive end Jason Taylor (who was allowed to play at his local high school in Pennsylvania) argued in favor of extending the right to play for local teams to more states.[26] Upon becoming the first home-schooled athlete to be nominated for the Heisman Trophy, he remarked, \"That's really cool. A lot of times people have this stereotype of home-schoolers as not very athletic – it's like, go win a spelling bee or something like that – it's an honor for me to be the first one to do that.\"[27] Tebow received the 2008 Quaqua Protégé Award as outstanding home-education graduate.[28] Tebow was heavily recruited by many college programs and almost accepted a scholarship offer from Mike Shula, then coach at Alabama.[29] Instead, he chose to attend the University of Florida and play for coach Urban Meyer's Florida Gators.[30] He was a key backup on Florida's 2006 national championship team, won the starting quarterback job and the Heisman Trophy in 2007, led the Gators to another BCS championship in 2008, and quarterbacked them to a 13–1 season in 2009. He served as team captain in 2008 and 2009, and he is the only three-time recipient of the Florida's most valuable player award, having been chosen by his teammates in 2007, 2008, and 2009.[31] Despite a strong showing in his first inter-squad scrimmage, head coach Urban Meyer named Tebow second-string behind Chris Leak.[32] A backup throughout the season, Tebow was a significant contributor to the Gators' 2006 success. He made his college debut coming off the bench in a goal line situation against Southern Miss. He rushed for a touchdown on a designed quarterback scramble on his first play.[33] In his next game, he led the team in rushing yards against UCF.[34] Tebow's biggest game in the season came against LSU on October 7, where he accounted for all three of the Gators' touchdowns, passing for two and rushing for another.[35] Tebow played a role in the Gators' victory in the 2007 BCS National Championship Game against Ohio State. He threw for one touchdown and rushed for another, finishing with 39 rushing yards.[36] He finished 2006 with the second-most rushing yards on the Gator team.[37][38] Although questions about his passing skill loomed, Tebow was named the Florida Gators starting quarterback for the 2007 season.[39] He opened the year 13-of-17 for 300 yards and three touchdowns in his starting debut against Western Kentucky.[40] Tebow finished the regular season with the second highest passing efficiency in the nation with 177.8. Additionally, he averaged 4.3 yards per carry on the ground.[41] Tebow set numerous personal, school, and national records in the 2007 season, including: On November 24, against Florida State, Tebow threw for three touchdowns and rushed for two in a 45–12 rout of the Seminoles. It was later revealed that Tebow fractured his right hand during the third quarter but played the rest of the game. He had to wear a cast for the next three weeks.[45] He led the SEC in pass completion percentage and rushing touchdowns.[46] After the 2007 season, Tebow was recognized as a first-team All-SEC selection and a consensus first-team All-American.[47][48] He won the Heisman Trophy, given to the most outstanding college football player of the year. Tebow also received the Davey O'Brien Award, annually given to the best quarterback in the nation, on February 18 in Fort Worth, Texas.[49] In addition, he won the Maxwell Award and AP Player of the Year.[50][51] On December 8, 2007, Tebow was awarded the Heisman Trophy, finishing ahead of Arkansas's Darren McFadden, Hawaii's Colt Brennan, and Missouri's Chase Daniel. He was the first sophomore to win the Heisman Trophy.[18] He garnered 462 first-place votes and 1,957 points, 254 points ahead of the runner-up, Arkansas running back Darren McFadden.[52][53] He finished the regular season as the only player in FBS history to rush and pass for at least 20 touchdowns in both categories in the same season.[54] He had 32 passing touchdowns, 23 rushing touchdowns, and became the third Florida player to win the Heisman Trophy, joining Steve Spurrier and Danny Wuerffel.[55] Before the 2007 season had even come to a close, Florida coach Urban Meyer stated that he would likely use two quarterbacks during the 2008 season to take some of the workload off of Tebow's shoulders.[57] Tebow led the Gators in rushing in 2007[58] but also had to play through a bruised shoulder and broken non-throwing hand.[57] Before the 2008 season even started, Tebow had his name pulled from consideration for the Playboy Preseason All-American team because it conflicted with his Christian beliefs.[59] On September 27, 2008, in the fourth week of the season, the undefeated No. 4 Gators lost to unranked Ole Miss at home, despite being 22-point favorites. After the game, Tebow delivered a speech to the media, later known as \"The Promise\" and later regarded as one of the most iconic speeches in college football history. In this speech, Tebow apologized for the loss and promised he and the team would do better. He would keep good on this promise, as the Gators would not lose another game for the rest of the season.[60][61][62][63] On November 1, 2008, playing against Georgia, Tebow ran for his 37th rushing touchdown, breaking the school record previously held by former Florida running back Emmitt Smith. Tebow helped lead the Gators to a 12–1 record in 2008. After clinching the SEC East title, the team played for and won the SEC title in the 2008 SEC Championship Game against Alabama. The win secured the #2 ranking in the final BCS standings, which earned the Gators the chance to play #1 ranked Oklahoma in the 2009 BCS National Championship Game, which they won 24–14.[64] He led the SEC in pass completion percentage and passing touchdowns.[65] Tebow finished third in the 2008 Heisman Trophy voting, with Oklahoma quarterback Sam Bradford taking the top spot followed by Texas quarterback Colt McCoy, despite Tebow receiving the most first-place votes.[66][67] He won the Maxwell Award in 2008, only the second player to ever win the award twice.[68] He won the Manning Award, Maxwell Award, and SEC Offensive Player of the Year.[69][70][71] On January 11, 2009, at a national championship celebration held at Ben Hill Griffin Stadium,[72] Tebow announced that he would not make himself eligible for the 2009 NFL draft, but would instead return for his senior season at Florida.[73] A day later, he had surgery on his right shoulder to remove a bone spur in an effort to reduce chronic inflammation.[74] Tebow opened the 2009 season continuing a streak of throwing and running for a touchdown in blowout wins over Charleston Southern and Troy.[76][77] He ran for a touchdown in the third game, a win against Tennessee, but failed to throw for a touchdown for the first time since his freshman season.[78] In answer to an interview question, Tebow stated he was a virgin.[79] The statement was subject to much discussion about whether the question was necessary, including criticism of the reporter who originally asked.[80][81][82] Tebow started against Kentucky despite suffering from a respiratory illness and taking two bags of intravenous fluids before the game.[83] He ran for two touchdowns to put him in 2nd place on the all-time SEC touchdown list and he also threw for a touchdown.[84] Late in the third quarter, he was hit in the chest by Kentucky defensive end Taylor Wyndham, fell backwards, and hit the back of his head on the knee of Florida tackle Marcus Gilbert.[83] He lay motionless for several minutes before being helped to the sidelines, where he appeared to vomit.[85] He was taken by ambulance to the University of Kentucky Chandler Medical Center.[85][83] A CT scan showed no bleeding in the brain, with the injury described as a mild concussion.[86] Coach Urban Meyer stayed the night in the hospital with Tebow, who was discharged in the morning.[87] Coincidentally, Florida did not have a game scheduled for the following Saturday, and Tebow was cleared to play in the Gators' next contest at LSU on October 10, two weeks after the incident.[88] On October 31, 2009, while playing against Georgia, Tebow ran for his 50th and 51st rushing touchdowns, breaking the SEC career record previously held by former Georgia running back Herschel Walker.[89] His penultimate collegiate game, the 2009 SEC Championship, saw him once again facing the University of Alabama. Tebow threw for 245 yards and a touchdown and led the team with 63 yards rushing, but the Gators fell 32–13 and lost their chance to play for a second consecutive national title.[90] Florida beat Cincinnati 51–24 in the 2010 Sugar Bowl the following January. In what was Tebow's last college game, he completed 31-of-35 passes for 482 yards and three touchdowns and accounted for four total touchdowns and 533 yards of total offense, which set a record for a Bowl Championship Series game.[91] He graduated from the University of Florida in December 2009.[92] At the end of his college career, Tebow held five National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA), 14 Southeastern Conference (SEC), and 28 University of Florida statistical records.[93] He was the SEC's all-time leader in career passing efficiency (170.8), completion percentage (67.1%), passing touchdown to interception ratio (5.5 to 1), rushing yards by a quarterback (2,947), rushing touchdowns (any position) (57), and total touchdowns responsible for (145).[4][94] Among many mentions in the NCAA Division-I record book, Tebow is ranked second in career passing efficiency, third in career yards per attempt (9.33), 8th in career rushing touchdowns, and also owns the record for most consecutive games in which he both threw at least one touchdown pass and scored at least one rushing touchdown (14).[95] In 2010, a new rule for the next NCAA football season banned messages on eye paint. This rule was dubbed \"The Tebow Rule\"[117][118][119] by media.[119] During his college football career, Tebow frequently wore references to biblical verses on his eye black. In the 2009 BCS Championship Game, he wore John 3:16 on his eye black; the verse was the highest-ranked Google search term over the next 24 hours, generating over 90 million searches.[120][121][122][123] Additionally, later, when Tebow switched to another verse, there were 3.43 million searches of \"Tim Tebow\" and \"Proverbs 3:5–6\" together.[124] Tebow stated of the searches \"It just goes to show you the influence and the platform that you have as a student-athlete and as a quarterback at Florida\".[124] Despite the media labeling it as the Tebow rule, the NCAA denies the rule was influenced by Tebow in particular, since many other notable players (Reggie Bush and Terrelle Pryor for example) wore messages on eye black.[125][126] An NCAA spokesman said: \"When this rule was proposed, the committee did not focus on any one team or student athlete. That measure reinforces what the intended use of eye black is, which is to shade the eyes from the sun.\"[126] The NFL already had a rule prohibiting players from wearing messages on eye black dating back to Jim McMahon's time with the Chicago Bears, so Tebow could not have continued the practice in the NFL.[119] After passing on the 2009 NFL draft for his senior season at Florida, Tebow went on to enter the 2010 NFL draft. Despite his college success, Tebow's NFL potential was much debated. At the time, Jon Gruden said Tebow was \"the strongest human being that's ever played the position\" and \"is the kind of guy who could revolutionize the game\".[127] Former Indianapolis Colts coach Tony Dungy said he would pick Tebow with a top 10 pick over any quarterback in the 2010 Draft.[128] However, NFL analyst Mel Kiper Jr. believed Tebow did not have the intangibles to play quarterback in the NFL. \"I don't think he can be a fulltime quarterback. I don't think he can be the quarterback of the future for you, but I do think in the third round, maybe the second round, he'll be the same as Pat White\", said Kiper.[129] Tebow was particularly mentioned as a potential third-round pick of the Jacksonville Jaguars, his hometown team. Some, including Florida governor Charlie Crist, suggested that Tebow could be the remedy for dwindling Jaguars ticket sales at EverBank Field.[130] Early in the 2009 season, Jaguars owner Wayne Weaver stated: \"He (Tebow) clearly is an outstanding football player and would be an asset to any football organization. Clearly there's going to be a groundswell for Tebow, and we'll have to make that evaluation if we have a draft pick that's going to be anywhere near him.\"[131] Not everyone in the organization agreed, as Jaguar lineman Uche Nwaneri posted doubts about Tebow's potential NFL success on his team's website message board.[132] Tebow was selected by the Denver Broncos in the first round (25th overall) of the 2010 NFL draft.[135] The Broncos had acquired the pick in a trade with the Baltimore Ravens on the first night of the draft for the Broncos' second, third and fourth round picks.[136] Broncos head coach Josh McDaniels said about drafting Tebow, \"He has all the traits you look for. It's a good pick.\"[137] When asked how Tebow will be used, McDaniels commented that Tebow probably wouldn't start at quarterback as a rookie, and that he'll, \"Play when he's ready.\" The Denver Post columnist Woody Paige praised the pick, saying \"Tim Tremendous may be high risk, but he will be a Mile High Reward.\"[138] He set an NFL Draft record for jersey sales and continued to have the top selling jersey through the 2010 season.[139] On July 29, Tebow signed a five-year contract with the Broncos that had a base value of $11.25 million (he could make as much as $33 million through certain performance-based incentives). The contract included $8.7 million guaranteed.[140] On October 17, Tebow scored his first NFL touchdown, which was a five-yard running play against the New York Jets.[141] On November 14, Tebow threw a three-yard touchdown pass to fullback Spencer Larsen on his first career NFL pass attempt, as part of a 49–29 home victory over the Kansas City Chiefs. He also added a one-yard rushing touchdown in the game.[142] Tebow started his first NFL game on December 19, which was a 39–23 road loss to the Oakland Raiders.[143] He completed 8-of-16 passes for 138 yards, including a 33-yard touchdown pass. He also rushed for 78 yards, 40 of which came on a touchdown run in the first quarter of the game.[144] It was the longest touchdown run for a quarterback in Broncos history and the longest touchdown run in NFL history for a quarterback in his first start.[citation needed] Tebow's first career victory came in his second start on December 26. The Broncos defeated the Houston Texans, 24–23, in Denver.[145] He helped rally the Broncos from a 17–0 deficit at halftime, as he finished the game with 308 passing yards and one touchdown pass. He also added a fourth-quarter rushing touchdown, which capped the comeback.[146] Tebow finished his rookie season playing sparingly in six games as a back-up (primarily on plays involving the wild horse formation, which is Denver's variation of the wildcat formation) before starting the last three games of the Broncos' season. He passed for a total of 654 yards, five touchdowns and three interceptions. He also rushed for 227 yards and six touchdowns.[147] He became the first quarterback in NFL history to rush for a touchdown in each of his first three career starts.[citation needed] Tebow began the 2011 season as the Denver Broncos' backup quarterback, behind Kyle Orton.[148][149] After the Broncos started 1–3, Tebow replaced Orton at halftime during a home game against the San Diego Chargers in week five.[150][151] Tebow passed and ran for a touchdown in the fourth quarter, narrowing a 16-point difference to an ultimate 29–24 loss.[152] Shortly afterward, Broncos' head coach John Fox announced Tebow would start in the following game on the road against the Miami Dolphins.[153] Tebow struggled for three-and-a-half quarters against the Dolphins, taking six sacks, but rallied from a 15–0 deficit in the last three minutes to win the game 18–15 in overtime.[154][155] The next week, Tebow took seven sacks in a 45–10 loss to the Detroit Lions.[156] On November 6, Tebow rushed for 118 yards, along with passing for 124 yards and two touchdowns, as part of a 38–24 road victory over the Oakland Raiders, second only to Norris Weese in Broncos history for rushing by a quarterback.[157] The Broncos followed with another road win over the Kansas City Chiefs. Tebow completed two passes on eight attempts for 69 yards and a touchdown.[158] His second completion, a 56-yard touchdown pass in the fourth quarter to wide receiver Eric Decker, sealed the game for Denver.[159] Four days later, Tebow was 9-for-20 with 104 yards in a Thursday Night Football home game against the New York Jets.[160] He led a 95-yard, game-winning touchdown drive with less than six minutes to play, capped by a 20-yard touchdown run on third-and-four with less than one minute remaining.[161] Tebow guided the Broncos to another comeback victory the next week—a 16–13 overtime road win over the San Diego Chargers, where he ran the ball 22 times for 67 yards.[162] In the tenth start of his NFL career, Tebow led the Broncos to their third consecutive come-from-behind win at the Minnesota Vikings, 35–32;[163] followed by a fourth comeback win, this time 13–10 in overtime at home over the Chicago Bears after being shut out for almost 58 minutes.[164] It was the last regular-season win of Tebow's career. In week 15, Tebow rushed for two touchdowns and completed 11-of-22 passes against the New England Patriots in a 41–23 loss. He was sacked four times in the game and had one fumble.[165] In the Broncos' 40–14 loss to the Buffalo Bills the following week, he had one passing and one rushing touchdown but also threw three interceptions, two of which were returned for touchdowns, and two fumbles.[166] He struggled for a third straight game the following week in a 7–3 loss to the Kansas City Chiefs, completing only 6-of-22 passes and finishing with a career-low quarterback rating of 20.6, but a loss by the Oakland Raiders clinched a playoff spot for the Broncos in the AFC West.[167][168] After the three consecutive losses, Broncos vice president and former quarterback John Elway said Tebow was playing tentatively and needed to \"pull the trigger\".[169][170] On January 8, Denver hosted the Pittsburgh Steelers during the Wild Card Round of the NFL playoffs. Tebow completed 10-of-21 passes for a career-high 316 yards and two touchdowns, including an 80-yard touchdown to Demaryius Thomas on the first play of overtime, as the Broncos won 29–23.[170] Media sources noted Tebow's passing yards (316) and yards per completion (31.6) evoked the Bible's John 3:16. The Nielsen ratings for the game also peaked at 31.6. John 3:16 was the top search item on Google the next morning, followed by Tebow and Tim Tebow.[171][172] The next week, Tebow completed just nine of 26 passes and took five sacks in a 45–10 defeat at the hands of the New England Patriots in the Divisional Round.[173][174] After the season, Elway confirmed that Tebow would be the Broncos' starting quarterback going into training camp in 2012.[175] Despite on-field successes by the Broncos under Tebow, he finished the season with the lowest passing completion rate in the NFL (reaching 50% in just four of his 14 games) which led many to question his potential as a quarterback at the professional level.[176] Tebow's persistent fumbles also created uncertainty about his future as a quarterback.[177][178][179] After the Broncos signed free agent Peyton Manning,[180] Tebow was traded to the New York Jets on March 21, 2012, along with the Broncos' 2012 seventh round draft pick, in exchange for the Jets' fourth and sixth round picks.[181] Jets special teams coordinator Mike Westhoff stated that Tebow would be used on special teams,[182] while head coach Rex Ryan and offensive coordinator Tony Sparano stated that he would also be used in the wildcat formation on offense.[183] The presence of Tebow throughout the season, in which the Jets struggled, created a controversy as the fans and media called for Ryan to bench the inconsistent Mark Sanchez in favor of Tebow.[184] Tebow suffered two broken ribs during a road game against the Seattle Seahawks, but his injury was not confirmed until two days before the Jets' Thanksgiving game against the New England Patriots. He was active despite the injury, which was publicly revealed after the game.[185] Tebow was inactive during the Jets' subsequent game against the Arizona Cardinals in which Sanchez was benched in favor of Greg McElroy.[186] On April 29, 2013, Tebow was released by the Jets. He had thrown only eight passes and rushed 32 times in his one season with the team.[187] The New England Patriots signed Tebow on June 10, 2013, the day before the team's mandatory minicamp;[188][189][190] Tebow signed a two-year contract with no guaranteed money, although it did have playing time-based incentives in 2014. The move reunited him with Josh McDaniels, who had resumed his positions as Patriots offensive coordinator and quarterbacks coach.[191] Tebow played in the first two of New England's preseason games, against the Philadelphia Eagles and the Tampa Bay Buccaneers; he completed just five passes in both games, was sacked several times and intercepted once, intensifying criticism of his football acumen.[192] He went 6-for-11 for 91 yards, throwing a pair of touchdown passes and one interception, and gained 30 yards on six carries against the New York Giants, but he also was sacked four times. He threw a total of two touchdown passes and two interceptions in the preseason and had a passer rating of 47.2 and completed 36.7% of his passes.[193] He was released from the Patriots on August 31, 2013, the day NFL teams were required to cut their rosters to 53. After being cut, he publicly thanked the Patriots organization for the opportunity and stated: \"I will remain in relentless pursuit of continuing my lifelong dream of being an NFL quarterback.\"[194] Though he began his broadcasting career in December 2013 on the SEC Network, Tebow continued to seek opportunities to resume his career as an NFL quarterback.[195] Tebow signed a one-year contract with the Philadelphia Eagles on April 20, 2015, and was in competition with Matt Barkley for the Eagles third-string quarterback job.[196] Tebow played all four games in the preseason with no starts, going 21-of-36 for 286 yards, two touchdowns, and one interception, while rushing for 82 yards and a touchdown.[197] He was released by the team on September 5, following the fourth preseason game.[198] On May 20, 2021, after spending six years out of football, Tebow contacted his former college coach, Urban Meyer, then coach of the Jacksonville Jaguars, about returning to the sport.[199] The Jaguars signed him as a tight end to a one-year contract for the veteran minimum of $920,000, none of which was guaranteed.[200] The Jaguars released Tebow on August 17, 2021. He had not caught any passes or played on special teams during limited playing time in the preseason.[199] Tebow's football background combined with his outspoken views on Christianity led some media pundits to label him as a 'cultural phenomenon',[201][202][203][204][205][206] while some Denver Broncos teammates and team management reportedly described him as 'self-centered' and a hypocrite.[207] A nationwide controversy surrounded Tebow's decision to appear in an ad funded by the socially conservative organization Focus on the Family that was broadcast on February 7, 2010, during Super Bowl XLIV on CBS.[208][209] There were two 30-second commercials which included Tebow's personal story as part of a pro-life stance. The abortion issue was not specifically mentioned in the ad.[210] Pro-choice groups criticized the ad,[211] while pro-life groups supported Tebow.[212] In 2011, Tebow was the first quarterback to be featured in ESPN's \"Year of the Quarterback\" series. The documentary, titled Tim Tebow: Everything in Between, followed him from the 2010 Sugar Bowl to the 2010 NFL draft. It premiered on January 6, 2011.[213] On November 8, 2011, the documentary was released on DVD. On May 31, 2011, HarperCollins released Through My Eyes, an autobiography that Tebow co-wrote with author Nathan Whitaker. Tebow details his early life growing up in Jacksonville and the Philippines, as well as his experiences as a college football quarterback.[214] By March 4, 2012, it had spent 24 weeks on the New York Times best seller list.[215] It was named the #1 sports book of 2011.[216] Tim followed his memoir with a young readers' edition titled Through My Eyes: A Quarterback's Journey, also co-written with Whitaker.[217] Tebow was the subject of a 2012 documentary on NFL Network's A Football Life entitled The Faces of Tebow.[218] He is a spokesperson for Nike, Jockey International, FRS Health Energy, and TiVo.[219][220][221][222] In 2013, Tebow collaborated with headphone maker Soul Electronics to create his own signature line of headphones. He launched a line which he called the 'Jet'.[223] In an episode that aired on February 4, 2016, Tebow competed against The Vampire Diaries actress Nina Dobrev on Spike's Lip Sync Battle. Tebow won the lip-sync contest with performances of \"Take Your Time\" by Sam Hunt and \"Eye of the Tiger\" by Survivor.[224] On December 30, 2013, Tebow was hired by ESPN as a college football analyst. He appears mainly on the SEC Network as co-host of SEC Nation, a travelling pre-game show, and contributed to ESPN's other platforms as well; Tebow made his debut on ESPN during the 2014 BCS National Championship Game. He did not give up on playing in the NFL, however, as his contract allowed him to continue to pursue opportunities as a player.[225] Tebow signed a multi-year extension of his contract with ESPN in 2017. His new contract allowed him to continue to pursue his pro baseball career.[226] Tebow was asked to co-host ABC News' Good Morning America on January 31, 2014, two days before Super Bowl XLVIII, and was joined on the morning show by Eli Manning.[227][228][229][230][231] Tebow also hosted two television shows, the second season of Home Free, a reality show about home renovation on Fox in 2016,[232] and Million Dollar Mile, an obstacle course competition show in 2019 on CBS.[233] On September 2, 2021, shortly after his release from the Jaguars, Tebow joined First Take, a talk show run by Stephen A. Smith.[234] Tim Tebow was executive producer[235] along with his older brother Robby Tebow, and actor in his first movie Run the Race which was released on February 22, 2019, in the U.S. This film is an inspirational sports drama with a football theme.[236] In early August 2016, Tebow made announcements that he was interested in pursuing a career in professional baseball and invited all 30 Major League Baseball teams to his open tryout at the end of August.[237] Tebow had not played baseball full-time since 2005, his junior year in high school, when he was an all-state player and the Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim expressed interest in drafting him had he played his senior year.[238] Additionally, he had a tryout with and received interest from the Los Angeles Dodgers prior to the 2016 Major League Baseball season.[239] On August 9, Tebow received contract offers (without tryouts) from two minor independent professional teams: the Schaumburg Boomers of the Frontier League and the Southern Maryland Blue Crabs of the Atlantic League of Professional Baseball.[240][241][242] On the day before his tryout, Tebow was also offered a contract by Águilas del Zulia, a team in the Venezuelan Professional Baseball League that plays winter baseball.[243] Tebow held his tryout on August 30 at Dedeaux Field in front of 40 MLB scouts (from 28 of the 30 MLB teams), Dodgers scouting director Billy Gasparino, and 50 members of the media.[244] On September 8, 2016, Tebow signed a minor league contract with the New York Mets and participated in the Mets' instructional league.[245][246][247] In his first at bat with the organization, on September 28, 2016, Tebow hit a home run on the first pitch.[248] The Mets assigned him to the Scottsdale Scorpions of the Arizona Fall League,[249] where he batted .194 in 70 plate appearances, with 20 strikeouts in 62 at bats.[250] Tebow spent most of 2017 spring training in the Mets' minor league camp, with a few appearances in major league camp.[251][252] He began the 2017 regular season with the Columbia Fireflies of the Class A South Atlantic League.[253] On April 6, 2017, Tebow hit a home run in his first at bat for the Fireflies, playing against the Augusta GreenJackets.[254] He batted .222 with three home runs and 23 runs batted in for Columbia. On June 25, the Mets promoted Tebow to the St. Lucie Mets of the Class A-Advanced Florida State League.[255] Once again he homered in his first day with his new club, St. Lucie, on June 28.[256] Tebow had a 12-game hitting streak between July 3 and 14.[257] Tebow finished the year at St. Lucie hitting .231, with 5 home runs and 57 strikeouts, in 216 at bats. Tebow expressed interest in returning for another season in 2018.[258] On January 19, 2018, the Mets announced that they would invite Tebow to major league camp.[259] Despite a poor showing in spring training (1-for-18 with 11 strikeouts), the Mets organization promoted Tebow to their Double-A team, the Binghamton Rumble Ponies of the Eastern League. On April 5, Tebow again hit a home run in his first at bat for a new team; with two men on base, he hit the first pitch over the right-field wall.[260] On June 29, Tebow was named to the Eastern League All-Star Game; at the time, he was batting .261 for the season and .323 in his last 21 games.[261] In the All-Star Game, held on July 11, Tebow went 1-for-4 as the East team's designated hitter.[262] On July 23, the Mets organization announced that Tebow had broken the hamate bone in his right hand, which required surgery and led him to miss the remainder of the season.[263] In November 2018, the Mets assigned Tebow to the Syracuse Mets of the Class AAA International League.[264] He spent spring training in 2019 with the New York Mets, and returned to Syracuse to start the 2019 season.[265] On May 18, 2019, the Syracuse Mets held a Tebow bobblehead giveaway for the first 1,000 fans in attendance.[266] Between June 28 and July 5, 2019, Tebow hit three home runs over an AAA six game stretch for the Syracuse Mets, his best performance as a professional baseball player.[267] On July 21, 2019, Tebow injured his left pinky fielding a ball in the outfield, requiring eight stitches. As a result, he missed the remainder of the 2019 season.[268] On February 25, Tebow hit his first major league spring training home run,[269] a two-run home run against Detroit Tigers' reliever Alex Wilson.[270] On February 17, Tebow and the Mets formally announced his retirement from professional baseball.[271][272] [273] Tebow accepted an invitation by the Philippines national team to play on their 2021 World Baseball Classic team. He was eligible to play for the Philippines as he was born there. He was scheduled to play in the qualifying round in March 2020 in Arizona, but the tournament was cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic.[269][274] In July 2023, Tebow was announced as a co-owner of an ECHL expansion team to be based in the Lake Tahoe area, later named the Tahoe Knight Monsters. Tebow was also previously a minor partner in the ECHL's Jacksonville Icemen and Savannah Ghost Pirates.[275] Tebow is also an investor in USL Championship and USL Super League soccer club Sporting Club Jacksonville.[276] \"Tebowing\" is a neologism for the act of kneeling on one knee in prayer specifically with one's head bowed and an arm resting on the one bent knee, a form of genuflecting.[277][278] It is derived from Tebow's propensity for kneeling and praying. The origin of the phrase is credited to fan Jared Kleinstein, who posted a picture with friends on Facebook, in which they mimicked a pose of Tebow following the Broncos' comeback overtime victory over the Dolphins on October 23, 2011.[279] The popularity of the picture led Kleinstein to set up a website showing pictures submitted by people depicting various interpretations of \"Tebowing\" all over the world.[279] After two-and-a-half months, the site received 20,000 photograph submissions and 20 million page views from 2 million unique visitors.[280] The New York Times wrote \"it can be hard to tell whether [people Tebowing] are celebrating or mocking [Tebow] for his virtuous ways.\"[278] Pittsburgh mayor Luke Ravenstahl Tebowed as part of a bet with the mayor of Denver following the Broncos playoff victory over the Steelers in 2012.[281] On October 9, 2012, Tebow was awarded the trademark to \"Tebowing\" after winning a legal battle with two fans who had expressed interest in trademarking the name.[282] \"Tebowing\" was included as a feature in the Madden NFL 13 video game.[283] On January 10, 2019, Tebow announced his engagement to Miss Universe 2017 and South African model Demi-Leigh Nel-Peters.[284] The couple were married during a 30-minute ceremony in South Africa on January 20, 2020.[285][286] On January 14 2025, they announced that they are expecting their first baby.[287] Tebow has appeared repeatedly at events in opposition to abortion, including the 2021 March for Life, where he was a featured speaker. He has been described as \"staunch pro-life activist\", which he in part attributes to his mother's decision to carry him.[288] Tebow was elected to the College Football Hall of Fame on January 9, 2023, and was inducted on December 5, 2023.[289][290] Tebow is known for his outspoken Christian faith.[291][292] In the Philippines, he preached at schools and villages, and assisted with medical care.[293][294] Tebow supports more than 40 national evangelists working in that nation.[294] In the United States, Tebow has shared his Christian faith in prisons and schools, to church and youth groups, and at meetings and conferences.[291][293] Tebow is a strong advocate for faith-based abstinence, and has publicly stated that he had maintained his virginity before marriage.[295][296] Tebow has spoken multiple times at events presented by the Fellowship of Christian Athletes.[297][298] An Easter Sunday crowd of roughly 20,000 in Florida listened to Tebow on April 8, 2012. He only briefly mentioned his move from Denver to New York, saying, \"Kind of got traded. I'm on another team—excited to be a Jet. Regardless of what happens, I still honor my Lord and Savior Jesus Christ, because at the end of the day, that's what's important, win or lose. ... We need to get back to one nation under God, and be role models for kids.\"[299][300] Honoring his commitment to his religious beliefs and his humanitarian work, Liberty University awarded an honorary Doctorate of Humanities to Tebow on May 15, 2021.[301] Tebow envisioned a foundation to give back to others during his college career, and he, along with other University of Florida students, created \"First and 15\", raising funds for Uncle Dick's Orphanage[302] [clarification needed] in the Philippines, founded by his father's nonprofit association, the Bob Tebow Evangelistic Association.[293] He also raised money for Shands Hospital pediatric cancer center in Gainesville and a Disney trip for disadvantaged children. Upon graduation from University of Florida, Tebow launched the Tim Tebow Foundation in January 2010.[303] In 2013, Tebow was designated a Great Floridian by Florida Governor Rick Scott in recognition of his \"major contributions to the progress and welfare\" of Florida.[304] CURE and the Tebow Foundation announced plans to build a children's hospital in the fall of 2011 in the Philippines, the country where Tebow was born. The Tebow CURE Hospital in Davao City, on the island of Mindanao, holds 30 beds and specializes in orthopedics. CURE's 12th hospital worldwide, they hoped to heal deformities such as clubfoot, untreated burns, hydrocephalus and other conditions correctable with surgery. The cost of the project, $3 million, came from donations from CURE and the Tebow Foundation. The hospital includes a \"Timmy's Playroom\".[305] The Tim Tebow Foundation includes Night to Shine, an event geared to providing those with special needs a safe space to have a prom.[306]",

                "title": "Takeaways from special counsel Jack Smith’s report on January 6 and Trump’s efforts to overturn the 2020 election | CNN Politics",
                "content": "Follow: The evidence was there to convict Donald Trump. That’s the simple and powerful conclusion from former special counsel Jack Smith in his final report on Trump’s effort to overturn the 2020 presidential election culminating in the January 6, 2021, attack on the US Capitol. Smith’s 137-page report, released overnight less than one week before Trump is sworn in for a second term as president, is a full-throated justification of his investigation and defense against his myriad critics. And while he faced substantial political and legal headwinds — especially from the Supreme Court — Smith said his ultimate defeat was at the ballot box when Trump was reelected. With Trump about to be shielded from prosecution as the sitting president, per Justice Department policy, Smith wrote, it was all over. A second volume, summing up the other half of Smith’s work, on what’s been assessed to be a strong but now-closed case against Trump over the retention of classified records after his presidency and obstruction of justice, is still not public. As with all of the legal battles Trump won over the past couple of years, it’s part of the ultimate “what if?” question of the 2024 election. Here’s what to know from Smith’s report: This is the second time a special counsel investigating Trump has pointed to the fact that Justice Department policy means the former and future president won’t face a jury. “The Department’s view that the Constitution prohibits the continued indictment and prosecution of a President is categorical and does not tum on the gravity of the crimes charged, the strength of the Government’s proof, or the merits of the prosecution, which the Office stands fully behind,” Smith wrote. Related article The lost year: How Merrick Garland’s Justice Department ran out of time prosecuting Trump for January 6 “Indeed, but for Mr. Trump’s election and imminent return to the Presidency, the Office assessed that the admissible evidence was sufficient to obtain and sustain a conviction at trial.” Attorney General Merrick Garland has faced criticism from the left for not appointing a special counsel to investigate Trump until November 2022 — and Smith didn’t begin his work until early the next year. And it wasn’t an open-and-shut legal case. However, the special counsel indicated the 2024 election meant he was out of time and options. Smith, however, didn’t guarantee a conviction — he just said there’s enough evidence. “It’s the same conclusion any prosecutor must reach before bringing any indictment, that there’s enough there so a jury will convict,” said CNN senior legal analyst Elie Honig. “He’s not making some boastful prediction about what a hypothetical jury would’ve done.” Trump, who from January 6, 2021, has insisted he did nothing wrong and now plans to pardon many of those arrested, charged and convicted of rioting at the Capitol that day, has repeatedly said he was exonerated since the charges were dropped. Trump’s lawyers even included his “fully exonerated” line in a letter to the attorney general, trying to block the release of the report. But Smith said that’s absolutely not the case. “Mr. Trump’s letter claims that dismissal of his criminal cases signifies Mr. Trump’s ‘complete exoneration,’” Smith wrote. “That is false.” Trump and the public have seen this language before. Former special counsel Robert Muller, in his report on alleged collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia in the 2016 election, said there was more than enough evidence to charge Trump with obstruction of justice but didn’t. “While this report does not conclude that the president committed a crime, it also does not exonerate him,” Mueller wrote in 2019, during Trump’s first term. “If we had confidence after a thorough investigation of the facts that the president clearly did not commit obstruction of justice, we would so state,” Mueller stated. And while Trump pleaded not guilty to the federal charges and consistently called the investigation a “witch hunt,” his lawyers didn’t have any pushback to the facts of Smith’s report, the special counsel said. A letter from Trump’s attorneys to Garland, Smith wrote, “fails to identify any specific factual objections to the draft” report they reviewed ahead of its public release. While Smith claims he could have obtained a conviction, he acknowledges the obvious: The Supreme Court was a deciding factor. “Because of the unprecedented facts and the variety of legal issues that would be litigated in this case, the Office was aware that the case would involve litigation risks, as would any case of this scope and complexity,” Smith wrote. “However, after an exhaustive and detailed review of the law, the Office concluded that the charges were well supported and would survive any legal challenges absent a change in the law as it existed at the time of indictment,” he added. Related article Special counsel report condemns Trump’s ‘criminal efforts to retain power’ in 2020 But the law changed. Slowly. And in Trump’s favor. Smith had attempted to speed things up, asking the Supreme Court in December 2023 to jump in and consider the presidential immunity question. The court, however, wasn’t in a hurry. It declined the request, waited for an appeals court ruling (which Trump lost) and didn’t hear oral arguments in the case until April. When the court’s conservative majority said in July that presidents enjoyed wide immunity for their official actions in the White House, it wasn’t until August that the special counsel was able to try again with a superseding indictment that limited the evidence Smith could use. Unsaid by Smith: Three of the justices in the 6-3 majority were appointed by Trump during the same term for which he now enjoyed immunity. Trump was also able to leverage the immunity ruling to delay being sentenced before the presidential election after being convicted in New York on fraud charges relating to hush money payments to adult-film star Stormy Daniels. Smith said his office would not have charged Trump if he was merely exercising his free speech rights by engaging in “exaggeration or rough-and-tumble politics.” Trump and the unindicted co-conspirators in the case “went well beyond speaking their minds or contesting the election results though our legal system,” Smith said, regarding the efforts to overturn Joe Biden’s election win. Over the course of more than 20 pages, Smith laid out why he believed the unprecedented prosecution was justified and that there was no alternative, citing the need of “protecting the integrity of the United States’ electoral process” and the “federal interest defending from future harm the United States exceptional tradition of peaceful transitions of presidential power.” Impeachment — even if Trump had been convicted by the Senate — is a political process, not a legal one, Smith wrote. Trump was impeached for his role in inciting the riot on January 6, 2021, but was acquitted by the Senate. “Thus, even if Mr. Trump had been convicted by the Senate, political accountability, in the form of impeachment, would not have been an adequate alternative for criminal accountability, especially considering the scope of Mr. Trump’s offenses and the substantial federal interests they targeted,” the report stated. The special counsel noted that more than 1,500 people have been charged for their actions at the US Capitol on January 6, so Trump shouldn’t have gotten off the hook: “Mr. Trump’s relative culpability weighed heavily in favor of charging him, as the individual most responsible for what occurred at the Capitol on January 6.” Nevertheless, there are others who also will avoid federal charges thanks to Trump’s win: the unindicted co-conspirators. At least one subject of the investigation, who was not named, may have committed unrelated crimes, and that person was referred to a US attorney’s office, according to the report. Smith’s report has an entire section contemplating how the Justice Department should approach investigations in election years, something that’s been a constant source of controversy, especially over the past decade. He stated that given the timing of the investigation and Trump’s concurrent reelection bid, the former president’s “actions would be criticized by one constituency or another, regardless of which path the investigations took.” Related article READ: Jack Smith’s report on efforts to overturn the 2020 election The special counsel said he leaned on DOJ policy and his own experience in the department’s Criminal Division’s Public Integrity Section and moved “swiftly.” DOJ policy is to not bring charges in the months before an election, he wrote, but it does not apply to cases already in court, as his were. “Whether it is during an election year or any other time, the duty of prosecutors after indictment is to litigate their cases fully and zealously,” the report states. Smith is essentially giving future prosecutors a roadmap. There has never been as fulsome of an articulation of this, especially in writing, so what Smith and his team wrote here will probably become relatively important in future elections. Smith had choice words for Trump’s attorneys, saying they peddled a “variety of false, misleading, or otherwise unfounded claims” to attack the integrity of his indictments and investigation. This searing rebuke is all the more notable, considering that one of the people Smith criticized was Trump attorney Todd Blanche, the president-elect’s pick to serve as deputy attorney general. It’s not out of the question that Blanche, in that role, could help supervise special counsel investigations in the future. Smith’s condemnations came in a January 7 letter to Garland and made public in the report. Smith sent the letter last week in response to a vitriolic letter from Trump’s team arguing the report should never be released because he is an “out-of-control private citizen unconstitutionally posing as a prosecutor.” It’s all the more jarring to see Smith condemn the incoming president’s lawyers on the same day that a separate special counsel condemned the outgoing president, too. Special counsel David Weiss, who investigated and successfully prosecuted Hunter Biden, said in his own final report on Monday that President Joe Biden made “false” and “wrong” accusations about the probe to justify pardoning his son. (Biden had said the investigation was unfair and tainted by politics.) But here’s the reality: For the first time since 2016, there are no active special counsels at the Justice Department.

                "content": "Trump said on social media that the new department would be created on his first day when he takes office on January 20. United States President-elect Donald Trump has announced his intention to create a new department called the “External Revenue Service”, designed to collect “tariffs, duties, and all revenue” from foreign sources. In a post on his platform Truth Social, Trump said that he would establish the new department as soon as he takes office on January 20. “Through soft and pathetically weak Trade agreements, the American Economy has delivered growth and prosperity to the World, while taxing ourselves. It is time for that to change,” Trump wrote on Tuesday. “We will begin charging those that make money off of us with Trade, and they will start paying, FINALLY, their fair share.” Trump compared the proposed department to the Internal Revenue Service, which is the US’s domestic tax collector. The establishment of a new agency requires congressional approval, but Trump enjoys strong support in Congress, as Republicans hold majorities in both the House of Representatives and the Senate. Critics have pointed out that the proposed department would essentially oversee the same functions handled by existing agencies, including the US Department of Commerce and US Customs and Border Protection, the latter of which collects duties and revenues from other nations. In his race to serve as president for a second term, Trump also pledged to shrink the size of the federal government, though he has since proposed several new agencies and advisory boards. For example, Trump has already declared his intention to establish a Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), a nongovernmental group that would advise on how to streamline bureaucracy and slash federal spending. That proposal has likewise raised scepticism that it would replicate the functions of existing government bodies and advisory boards. Trump has tapped entrepreneurs Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy to lead the planned efficiency group. His new proposal to establish a “External Revenue Service” follows repeated pledges to impose stiff tariffs on three of the US’s largest trading partners: Canada, Mexico and China. Shortly after his election in November, for instance, Trump called for Canada and Mexico to pay a 25-percent tariff on their exports to the US, as a way of forcing the two countries to clamp down on the cross-border trafficking of drugs and migrants. He has also pledged to impose tariffs of 10 percent on global imports into the US, along with a 60-percent tariff on Chinese goods — duties that experts say would raise consumer costs and prompt retaliation against US exports. The US imports more than it exports from Mexico, Canada and China. Last year, the trade deficit stood at $67.9bn for Canada, $152.4bn for Mexico, and $279.4bn for China, according to the US Bureau of Economic Analysis. The fact that the US has a trade deficit with many of its trading partners has preoccupied Trump since his first term in office and was cited as part of his rationale for initiating a trade war with China in 2018. “Trump views relationships based on whether the US has a trade deficit or a trade surplus with a given country,” Steve Okun, the CEO of Singapore-based consultancy firm APAC Advisors, told Al Jazeera last year. “If the US has a trade deficit with a country, you address the deficit, typically through tariffs.” Some critics argued that the announcement of a new agency to collect tariffs was a branding exercise more than a substantial policy solution. “This is clever marketing,” Heather Long, an economic columnist at the Washington Post, wrote on the social media platform X. “But it doesn’t change the fact that American consumers will end up paying these higher tariffs.” Democratic lawmakers were also quick to criticise the “External Revenue Service” plan. “No amount of silly rebranding will hide the fact that Trump is planning a multi-trillion-dollar tax hike on American families and small businesses to pay for another round of tax handouts to the rich,” Ron Wyden, the top Democrat on the Senate Finance Committee, said in a statement.

                "content": "Print President-elect Donald Trump on Tuesday announced plans to create a new agency called the External Revenue Service to collect tariffs and other revenues from foreign nations. \"We will begin charging those that make money off of us with Trade, and they will start paying,\" Trump said Tuesday on his social media site, Truth Social. He compared his planned creation to the Internal Revenue Service, which is the nation's domestic tax collector. The creation of a new agency requires an act of Congress, and Republicans hold the majority of both the House and the Senate. Trump, who has vowed to shrink the size of government, would be creating a new agency to perform functions already handled by existing agencies, including the Commerce Department and the Customs and Border Patrol, which collect duties and revenues from other nations. The president-elect has tapped two business titans to lead his Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, a nongovernmental task force assigned to find ways to fire federal workers, cut programs and slash federal regulations, all part of what he calls his \"Save America\" agenda for a second term in the White House. Billionaire Elon Musk and fellow entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy are leading the DOGE's ambitious efforts to reduce the size and scope of the federal government. Tariffs, with the threat of a potential 25% levy on all goods from allies like Canada and Mexico and 60% on goods from China, have become a benchmark of Trump's economic agenda as he heads into his second term. Economists have said the cost of the tariffs will be passed on to consumers, and are generally skeptical of them, considering them a mostly inefficient way for governments to raise money and promote prosperity. Democratic lawmakers were quick to criticize the External Revenue Service plan. \"No amount of silly rebranding will hide the fact that Trump is planning a multi-trillion-dollar tax hike on American families and small businesses to pay for another round of tax handouts to the rich,\" Oregon Sen.

                "title": "Trump announces creation of External Revenue Service — here's what new agency will collect",
                "content": "President-elect Donald Trump announced Tuesday he will create an external revenue office upon his return to the White House that will collect all foreign-sourced revenue, such as tariffs. “For far too long, we have relied on taxing our Great People using the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). Through soft and pathetically weak Trade agreements, the American Economy has delivered growth and prosperity to the World, while taxing ourselves,” Trump wrote on Truth Social. “I am today announcing that I will create the EXTERNAL REVENUE SERVICE [ERS] to collect our Tariffs, Duties, and all Revenue that come from Foreign sources.” The incoming president added that the ERS would be established on Jan. 20 to “begin charging those that make money off of us with Trade, and they will start paying, FINALLY, their fair share.” Trump, 78, has already threatened to raise tariffs on foreign countries that do not comply with his hardline immigration policies. The president-elect has singled out Mexico and Canada with threats of a 25% tariff, and has also said he will stop “business” with countries that refuse to take back illegal migrants who have been deported. The Republican has also said he will levy a 10% to 20% tariff on all foreign goods and up to a 60% tariff on Chinese imports. Trump also vowed on the campaign trail to upend the current tax structure, promising no taxes on tips, overtime or Social Security — even floating the elimination of federal income tax due to the revenue that his tariff policy theoretically would generate. Tariff collection currently falls under the authority of US Customs and Border Protection, which is part of the Department of Homeland Security. The creation of a separate ERS agency will in theory need congressional support, though Trump could try to establish the department within a different existing agency. Trump ally Steve Bannon told Politico earlier Tuesday that the ERS should be established under the Treasury Department to take the burden off the IRS. But Bryan Riley from the National Taxpayers Union pointed out that the “federal government collects duties from US importers,” raising questions about how the proposed agency would even work. “It does not collect duty revenue from foreign sources, so it is not clear what the point of a new External Revenue Service would be,” Riley told The Post. “A better priority would be to improve the operation of the Internal Revenue Service to better serve US taxpayers.” Alternatively, economist EJ Antoni of the Heritage Foundation told The Post that “I really, really love this idea.” “Anything that gets us away from income taxes and towards tariffs is a great idea,” added Antoni, saying that the ERS will likely come about through the “transformation” of a current agency into one that “would better serve” the American people. The Trump team did not immediately respond to questions about specifics of the new agency. Advertisement",

                "title": "Donald Trump Wants an 'External Revenue Service': What to Know - Newsweek",
                "content": "President-elect Donald Trump said on Tuesday he wants to create an \"External Revenue Service\" to collect \"tariffs, duties and all revenue\" from foreign sources. Newsweek reached out to Trump's transition team via email for comment. Trump centered his presidential campaign on his strong economic policies, often calling into question the Biden administration's impact on the United States economy and high inflation. Trump has since repeatedly threatened to impose substantial tariffs on key trading partners like China, Canada and Mexico in recent months, including a 25 percent tariff on imports from Canada and Mexico until they clamped down on drugs and migrants crossing the border. However, economists have warned that his plans to implement tariffs on different countries could hurt the U.S. economy and cause prices to rise across various sectors. Trump announced in a post on Truth Social on Tuesday that he will create an \"External Revenue Service,\" comparing it to the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), which collects taxes from Americans. According to Trump, who condemned the existing U.S. trade agreements and the country's reliance on income taxes for revenue, the new department will oversee tariffs and foreign revenue. \"For far too long, we have relied on taxing our Great People using the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). Through soft and pathetically weak Trade agreements, the American Economy has delivered growth and prosperity to the World, while taxing ourselves. It is time for that to change. I am today announcing that I will create the EXTERNAL REVENUE SERVICE to collect our Tariffs, Duties, and all Revenue that come from Foreign sources,\" Trump wrote on Truth Social. He added: \"We will begin charging those that make money off of us with Trade, and they will start paying, FINALLY, their fair share. January 20, 2025, will be the birth date of the External Revenue Service.\" It is unclear how the External Revenue Service will work. The secretary of the Treasury is charged with establishing regulations on collecting tariffs. U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) administers those regulations at U.S. ports of entry. Trump's remarks come as the president-elect looks at ramping up tariffs on Canada, Mexico and China. He said he would enact tariffs of 25 percent on all Canadian and Mexican goods and add another 10 percent tariff to all Chinese goods through an executive order on his first day in office. Alex Beene, a financial literacy instructor for the University of Tennessee at Martin, told Newsweek: \"The primary fear—and rightfully so—is any tariff added to particular countries and industries would result in those costs being passed on to the consumer.\" He added: \"So far, Trump has simply warned of tariffs being imposed on countries that didn't make adjustments based on his demands, but if they're enacted, it certainly could impact the wallets of millions of Americans. I think the hope right now is cooler heads will prevail, and the proposed tariffs will remain just that, a proposal.\" Kevin Thompson, a finance expert and the founder and CEO of 9i Capital Group, told Newsweek: \"This is basic economics. When companies face higher prices for imports, they pass those costs onto consumers in the form of increased prices, which contributes to inflation on goods.\" Thompson said the high number of Americans who think Trump's policies could lead to worse inflation and economic realities is unsurprising, even amid Trump's strong Republican voting base. \"It is not surprising when tribalism takes hold, emotions often override logic, particularly when it comes to economics. Many people voted for change—what felt good—without fully considering how that change would play out in reality,\" he said. Billionaire hedge fund manager and Trump supporter Bill Ackman described Trump's tariff proposalson X, formerly Twitter, \"as a weapon to achieve economic and political outcomes which are in the best interest of America, fulfilling his America first policy.\" \"To be clear,\" Ackman said. \"According to Trump, the 25 percent tariffs will not be implemented, or if implemented will be removed, once Mexico and Canada stop the flow of illegal immigrants and fentanyl into the U.S.\" Trump said he would create the department on January 20, the day he will be inaugurated as president for a second term. While Trump has continued to be vocal in his plans to enforce the new tariffs once he returns to office in January, not all analysts expect the tariffs would get approved that quickly. \"Approval will depend on whether a bipartisan consensus can be reached in the House of Representatives,\" Thompson previously told Newsweek. \"During his administration, many of Trump's campaign promises were blocked, even when his party controlled both chambers of Congress. Whether this plan succeeds will depend on the political climate and the priorities of Congress.\" Newsweek is committed to journalism that's factual and fair.
