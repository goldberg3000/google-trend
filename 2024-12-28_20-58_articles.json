                "content": "Dayle Haddon (May 26, 1948 – December 27, 2024) was a Canadian model and actress, known for promoting anti-aging products manufactured by L'Oréal.[1] Additionally, she was credited as the author of Ageless Beauty: A Woman's Guide to Lifelong Beauty and Well-Being.[2] During the earlier part of her career as a model, Haddon appeared on the covers of many top fashion and beauty magazines, as well as the cover of the Sports Illustrated Swimsuit Issue in 1973.[3] Haddon also served as a wellness contributor to CBS News where she appeared regularly on The Early Show from 2005 to 2008.[4] Born and raised in Montreal, Quebec, Canada, Haddon spoke English and French. As a child, she was enrolled in dancing classes to develop her physique, and she performed well enough to become a member of Les Grands Ballets Canadiens at 13, and was chosen as Miss Montreal at 18. As a model in the 1970s and 1980s, Haddon represented Max Factor, Revlon, Estée Lauder, and L'Oréal. She appeared on the cover of the Sports Illustrated Swimsuit Issue in 1973 (January 29)[3] and was twice named to Harper's Bazaar's \"Ten Most Beautiful Women.\" She also appeared nude in the April 1973 issue of Playboy. Haddon worked as an actress, appearing in the Disney movie The World's Greatest Athlete (1973) with Jan-Michael Vincent. She moved to Europe, continued modeling and acting, and appeared in a number of film roles in French and English,[5] as well as occasional small parts in American movies. Her best known roles were in Madame Claude (1977), and North Dallas Forty (1979) opposite actor Nick Nolte. Haddon was originally cast for the role of Dale Arden in the 1980 film version of Flash Gordon, but producer Dino De Laurentiis replaced her with Melody Anderson just before filming commenced.[6] During Haddon's tenure as a main face for L'Oréal, sales for the Age Perfect line had increased by 50%.[7] According to The New York Times, Dayle had \"shattered age taboos\" with her multiyear contracts with L'Oréal and Estée Lauder, among other companies.[8] Clairol selected her as a spokesperson, and she later broke barriers for women over the age of 35 when she became the global face of a new anti-aging line for Estée Lauder, a first in the beauty industry. On the day that her Estée Lauder contract expired, L'Oréal signed her. She then had her own company, Dayle Haddon Concepts Inc. In early 2008 she was named a UNICEF ambassador.[9] Haddon was also the founder of a non-profit called WomenOne. The organization's motto is \"changing the world one woman at a time.\"[10] Through WomenOne, Haddon had partnered with Free The Children, an international charity, to provide scholarships for girls’ education in Kenya. Through her organization, she had raised and donated more than $150,000 for one of Free The Children's all-girls secondary schools.[11] Haddon also appeared as the face of a line of socially and environmentally responsible accessories launched by Me to We, Free The Children's partner organization.[12] She was the mother of Ryan Haddon.[13] On December 27, 2024, first responders found her unresponsive in a carriage house in Solebury Township, Pennsylvania just outside New Hope. She was declared dead at the scene, and the cause was announced as accidental carbon monoxide poisoning caused by a defective boiler.[14]",

                "content": "Dayle Haddon, the Canadian supermodel who rose to fame for her work representing various cosmetic and magazine companies, died Friday from suspected carbon monoxide poisoning. She was 76. Haddon was found dead in a second-floor bedroom of a detached in-law suite at a home on the 6900 block of Phillips Mill Road in Solebury Township, Pa. The million-dollar home is owned by Haddon’s journalist daughter Ryan Haddon and son-in-law Hallmark actor Marc Blucas, according to 6ABC News. “The bright light that is Dayle has dimmed in this Earthly realm,” Ryan posted in a tribute on Friday. “Shining somewhere as radiantly as ever where it’s most needed, I have no doubt. “She was a woman in her power, yet soft and attentive to all. Deeply creative and curious, gifted with beauty inside and out. Always kind and thoughtful.” First responders were called to the property just after 6:30 a.m. Friday after receiving reports of a 76-year-old man lying unconscious on the first floor of the suite, the Solebury Township Police Department said. The unidentified man was removed from the building and brought to a nearby hospital before rescuers learned that the woman, later identified as Haddon, was still inside. The model was discovered inside and pronounced dead at the scene. Blucas and Ryan Haddon purchased the “old farmhouse” in 2012 for $1 million, and completely restored the property that dated back to 1711, Blucas told Wide Open Country. The New Hope Eagle Volunteer Fire Company detected a “high level of carbon monoxide” on the property. Two medics were hospitalized due to exposure to the poisonous gas and a police officer was treated at the scene for injuries with all three in stable condition, the police department said. No one in the main home was injured, with police believing a heating unit malfunctioned causing the high levels of carbon monoxide, CBS reported. During her modeling career, Haddon signed four contracts with major cosmetic companies Revlon, Max Factor, Estée Lauder and L’Oréal, according to her website. She’s been featured on the covers of Vogue, Elle, and Cosmopolitan. The longtime spokeswoman for L’Oréal is credited for representing the brand throughout Europe, China and North America during her over 15-year campaign. She appeared on the cover of Sports Illustrated in 1973. “She held so many up, saw their greatness sometimes hidden to them, and always built bridges with her own connections to help them ascend,” Ryan said. She was everyone’s greatest champion. An inspiration to many. “I always trust the timing of things. There are no accidents and certainly how we enter and exit this world is mystical and unknowable. She was a high-hearted spiritual being that put value on her soul’s evolution, so I know her journey here in this dimension must have been complete.” Haddon was a UNICEF Ambassador and founded the New York-based WomenOne charity focused on delivering access to quality education to every girl in the world. She has authored two books, “Ageless Beauty” and “The 5 Principles of Ageless Living.” Haddon’s final Instagram post on Dec. 19, promoted her appearance on the “Shift Happens” podcast with Claudia Mahler where they discussed “How to Gracefully Beat Ageism in Fashion.” Advertisement",

Records show the home is owned by Haddon's daughter, former journalist Ryan Haddon, and Ryan's husband, actor Marc Blucas. Solebury Township police say authorities were investigating a property on the 6900 block of Phillips Mill Road after a resident called 911 at around 6:30 a.m. to report a 76-year-old man had passed out on the first floor of a detached office or in-law suite on the property. The Lambertville-New Hope Ambulance and Rescue Squad was first on the scene and removed the man from the building. He was taken to Robert Wood Johnson University Hospital in New Jersey and his condition was not immediately available. A second victim, a 76-year-old woman, later identified by the Bucks County Coroner's Office as Dayle Haddon was found dead in a second-floor bedroom in the in-law suite. Haddon rose to fame in the 1970s and '80s as a supermodel and later became an ambassador for the humanitarian aid organization, UNICEF. She is also the founder of WomenOne, a 501(c)3 organization based in New York, focused on creating educational opportunities for girls and women, according to her website. Officials did not immediately identify the 76-year-old man or say if Blucas or Ryan Haddon were in the home at the time. The New Hope Eagle Volunteer Fire Company detected high levels of carbon monoxide in the building, police said. \"Preliminary investigation is showing that a heating unit malfunctioned exposing a large amount of carbon monoxide within the carriage house,\" said Detective Sgt. Jonathan Koretzky. Two medics were taken to Doylestown Hospital for treatment after the exposure and a Solebury Township police officer was treated at the scene. All three are said to be stable, according to officials. According to public records, Ryan Haddon and Blucas purchased the home in 2012 for just over $1 million. Blucas has said in multiple interviews that he is restoring the home, which was built in 1711. The former Wake Forest University basketball player pursued a career in Hollywood and eventually appeared in \"Buffy the Vampire Slayer\" as Riley, one of Buffy's love interests. He's also appeared in \"Blue Bloods\" and \"CSI: Crime Scene Investigation,\" with lead roles in the TV series \"Necessary Roughness\" and \"Killer Women.\" He once played Katie Holmes' love interest in the movie \"First Daughter,\" where Holmes plays the daughter of the president of the United States. Michael Keaton plays the president in the film. In an appearance on the Hallmark Channel promoting the 2016 movie \"Operation Christmas,\" Blucas spoke about restoring the centuries-old property with his wife and kids. \"It was before George Washington was born... it's pretty amazing, and it's a way to stay creatively stimulated when I'm not out filming,\" he told hosts Mark Steines and Debbie Matenopoulos. The Butler, Pennsylvania, native said he wanted to be closer to family so they moved back to the East Coast. \"It's the only part of the United States that has that kind of architecture with old stone barns and old stone houses,\" Blucas said. \"And so I knew it would be projects for life, which it is.\" The family lived in the guest house on the property while the main house was being renovated and then started getting animals like chickens and rabbits, he said in the interview. Ryan Haddon now works as a life coach and hypnotherapist, according to her social media profiles. She was married to actor Christian Slater for several years and they had two children together.

                "content": "Greg Gumbel (May 3, 1946 – December 27, 2024) was an American television sportscaster. He was best known for his various assignments for CBS Sports (most notably, the National Football League and NCAA basketball). He became the first African-American announcer to call play-by-play of a major sports championship in the United States when he announced Super Bowl XXXV for the CBS network in 2001. Until 2023, Gumbel was the studio host for CBS' men's college basketball coverage and was a play-by-play broadcaster for the NFL on CBS. Gumbel was born in New Orleans, Louisiana, the first child of Rhea Alice (LeCesne) and Richard Dunbar Gumbel, a judge.[1] As a young man, Gumbel grew up on Chicago's South Side, where he was raised Catholic, attending and graduating from De La Salle Institute.[2] In 1967, Gumbel graduated with a Bachelor of Arts in English from Loras College,[3] where he also played on the baseball team. He had two sisters, Renee Gumbel-Farrahi and Rhonda Gumbel-Thomas, and a younger brother, Bryant Gumbel, who also pursued a network television broadcasting career.[4][5] In 1973, Greg's brother Bryant, then working as a television sportscaster at KNBC in Los Angeles, informed him that another NBC owned-and-operated station, WMAQ-TV in Chicago, was auditioning for a sports announcer. At the time, Greg was selling hospital supplies in Detroit. He ultimately got the job, returned to Chicago and worked at WMAQ-TV for seven years. The sportscaster he replaced, Dennis Swanson, went on to become president of ABC Sports.[citation needed] Prior to his rising to prominence at CBS, Gumbel worked for MSG, ESPN, and WFAN radio in New York City. At ESPN, he anchored the show SportsCenter and did play-by-play for early NBA games. On MSG, Gumbel served as a backup announcer for Marv Albert on New York Knicks broadcasts as well as providing coverage for college basketball. When MSG signed a huge contract to broadcast New York Yankees games in 1989, Gumbel served as host of the pregame and postgame shows. In addition to his MSG duties, he was the host of the first radio morning show on radio station WFAN. However, station management replaced him with WNBC Radio personality Don Imus once WFAN took over WNBC's AM 660 frequency.[6] Gumbel's CBS career began with part-time work as an NFL announcer in 1988. In 1989, Gumbel began announcing college basketball as well. He became host of The NFL Today (alongside Terry Bradshaw) for the 1990 to 1993 seasons.[7] He also anchored CBS' coverage of Major League Baseball, college football, and, in 1999, CBS' coverage for the Daytona 500 and Pepsi 400.[8] Besides his hosting duties, Gumbel provided play-by-play for the NBA (alongside Quinn Buckner), Major League Baseball including the 1993 American League Championship Series (alongside Jim Kaat), and College World Series baseball.[9] He was the prime time anchor for the 1994 Winter Olympic Games from Lillehammer, Norway,[10] and co-anchor for the weekday morning broadcasts of the 1992 Winter Olympics from Albertville, France.[11] Gumbel moved to NBC in 1994 following CBS' losses of the NFL and Major League Baseball broadcasting contracts (Gumbel's last on-air assignment for CBS was providing play-by-play for the College World Series[12]). While at NBC, Gumbel hosted NBC's coverage of the 1994 Major League Baseball All-Star Game. He also did play-by-play for the 1995 Major League Baseball National League Division Series and National League Championship Series (on both occasions, teaming with Joe Morgan), did play-by-play for The NBA on NBC, hosted NBC's daytime coverage of the 1996 Summer Olympics from Atlanta, Georgia, hosted the 1995 World Championships of Figure Skating, and served as the studio host for The NFL on NBC.[citation needed] Gumbel left NBC after the network broadcast of Super Bowl XXXII to return to CBS. His first major assignment was to serve as studio host for the network's coverage of college basketball, including the NCAA men's basketball tournament.[13] As CBS had just acquired the rights to NBC's previous NFL package, Gumbel joined the broadcast team as the lead announcer with fellow NBC alumnus Phil Simms as his color man. Gumbel was the lead announcer for the NFL on CBS between 1998 and 2003, calling Super Bowls XXXV[14] and XXXVIII.[15] For the 2004 NFL season, Gumbel traded positions with Jim Nantz as host of The NFL Today with Nantz taking over as lead announcer.[16] At the end of the 2005 NFL season, Gumbel was replaced as studio host of The NFL Today by James Brown.[17] Gumbel returned to the broadcast booth as the #2 play-by-play man, replacing Dick Enberg, alongside color man Dan Dierdorf until Dierdorf retired after the 2013–14 NFL season. Gumbel also worked alongside Trent Green in the #3 team from 2014 until 2019. He worked in a three-man booth with Green and Bruce Arians for the 2018 NFL season. Gumbel then traded spots with Kevin Harlan in 2020, teaming with Rich Gannon. Adam Archuleta became Gumbel's partner in the #4 slot the following year after CBS declined to renew Gannon's contract.[18] CBS Sports extended its contract with Gumbel on March 15, 2023, which allowed him to continue hosting college basketball while stepping back from NFL coverage.[19] However, Gumbel was absent from March Madness coverage in 2024 due to family health issues.[20] Gumbel resided in the Fort Lauderdale, Florida, area.[citation needed] In 1999, Gumbel refused to attend a NASCAR banquet honoring Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas, on the basis that he disagreed with Thomas' positions on political issues.[21] He regularly appeared on Howard Stern's radio show.[22] Along similar lines, Gumbel said of Rush Limbaugh, \"I find him someone whose words and opinions I can do without.\"[23] Gumbel died of cancer on December 27, 2024, at the age of 78.[3][24][25] He was married to wife Marcy, and they had a daughter, Michelle.[3][26] Gumbel is one of a few sports announcers to work on pre-game, play-by-play, and radio Super Bowl broadcast teams. He hosted the television pre-game show for Super Bowl XXVI (CBS); Super Bowl XXX (NBC); Super Bowl XXXII (NBC); Super Bowl XLVII (CBS); and Super Bowl L (CBS); provided tv play-by-play for Super Bowl XXXV (CBS) and Super Bowl XXXVIII (CBS); hosted the radio pre-game show for Super Bowl XXV (CBS); Super Bowl XXVI (CBS); Super Bowl XXVII (CBS); and Super Bowl XXVIII (CBS).[3] During his tenure as the chief anchor of The NFL Today, he served alongside co-anchors Dan Marino, Shannon Sharpe, and Boomer Esiason. He was nicknamed \"Gumby\" by some of his colleagues.[27]",

Eric Gay/AP hide caption NEW YORK — Greg Gumbel, a longtime CBS sportscaster, has died from cancer, according to a statement from family released by CBS on Friday. He was 78. \"He leaves behind a legacy of love, inspiration and dedication to over 50 extraordinary years in the sports broadcast industry; and his iconic voice will never be forgotten,\" his wife Marcy Gumbel and daughter Michelle Gumbel said in a statement. In March, Gumbel missed his first NCAA Tournament since 1997 due to what he said at the time were family health issues. Gumbel was the studio host for CBS since returning to the network from NBC in 1998. Gumbel signed an extension with CBS last year that allowed him to continue hosting college basketball while stepping back from NFL announcing duties. In 2001, he announced Super Bowl XXXV for CBS, becoming the first Black announcer in the U.S. to call play-by-play of a major sports championship. David Berson, president and CEO of CBS Sports, described Gumbel as breaking barriers and setting standards for others during his years as a voice for fans in sports, including in the NFL and March Madness. \"A tremendous broadcaster and gifted storyteller, Greg led one of the most remarkable and groundbreaking sports broadcasting careers of all time,\" said Berson. Gumbel had two stints at CBS, leaving the network for NBC when it lost football in 1994 and returning when it regained the contract in 1998. He hosted CBS' coverage of the 1992 and 1994 Winter Olympics and called Major League Baseball games during its four-year run broadcasting the national pastime. In 1995, he hosted the World Figure Skating Championships and the following year hosted NBC's daytime coverage of the Olympic Summer Games in Atlanta.

Ron Heflin/AP hide caption But it was football and basketball where he was best known and made his biggest impact. Gumbel hosted CBS' NFL studio show, \"The NFL Today\" from 1990 to 1993 and again in 2004. He also called NFL games as the network's lead play-by-play announcer from 1998 to 2003, including Super Bowl XXXV and XXXVIII. He returned to the NFL booth in 2005, leaving that role after the 2022 season. \"Like all who knew and loved him, I too am saddened by his death, yet also so very grateful to have known him in my life,\" Clark Kellogg, a CBS Sports college basketball game and studio analyst, said in a statement. \"What a gift to be touched by such a good man and partner.\" Gumbel, the older brother of sportscaster Bryant Gumbel, grew up in Chicago and graduated from Loras College in Dubuque, Iowa, in 1967 with a degree in English. He won local Emmy Awards during his long career and was the recipient of the 2007 Pat Summerall Award for excellence in sports broadcasting. Outside of his career as a sportscaster, he was affiliated with the March of Dimes for three decades, including as a member of its board of trustees. He also was a member of the Sports Council for St Jude's Children's Research Hospital for 16 years. Sponsor Message Become an NPR sponsor",

Gumbel was the older brother of Bryant Gumbel, the host of NBC’s “Today” show and “Real Sports with Bryant Gumbel” on HBO. Bryant Gumbel received a lifetime achievement award at the Sports Emmys in 2003. Greg Gumbel grew up in Chicago and graduated from Loras College in Dubuque, Iowa, in 1967 with a degree in English. He had plans to become an English teacher, but after his brother got into sportscasting, he auditioned at WMAQ-TV, an NBC affiliate in Chicago in 1973, according to the book \"You Are Looking Live!: How The NFL Today Revolutionized Sports Broadcasting.\" He was soon offered a position as weekend sports anchor. “I’m kind of surprised I got the job. I certainly wasn’t anyone who was polished,\" he said in the book. \"By my own reckoning, it took me a good year to start to feel comfortable in front of a camera.\" Gumbel also worked for ESPN and the Madison Square Garden network. Veteran NBC 5 anchor and reporter Art Norman first met Gumbel decades ago - and the two remained great friends. \"This was a guy that when I was going through my cancer battle, he was a big supporter of me, and I'm still a big supporter of him,\" Norman said.

Veteran NBC 5 anchor and political reporter Carol Marin said Gumbel called it like it is - but he did it with dignity and without animosity. \"He was a sports guy who could talk about anything else,\" she said. \"The mark of a really great sports guy is he's literate on a lot of subjects and knows how to weed through them.\" Marin said when Gumbel was a friend of yours - he was a friend of yours forever. \"When you're talking about somebody like Greg Gumbel, he had a big heart, and he shared it,\" she said.",

FORT WORTH, Texas — For the first time in its history, OU football will take on a service academy in a bowl matchup. The Sooners will square off with Navy in the Armed Forces Bowl at 11 a.m. Friday in a game that will be televised on ESPN. OU will be without linebacker Danny Stutsman and safety Billy Bowman, who have opted out of the bowl to prepare for the NFL Draft, while plenty of other players who are transferring will also be out. The transfer portal losses include quarterback Jackson Arnold, tight end Bauer Sharp and a slew of wide receivers. The Sooners will be looking for their first bowl victory of the Brent Venables era and to avoid their second losing season in their last three. They'll have a tough matchup, though. Navy, coached by Westmoore grad Brian Newberry, runs a unique triple-option offense that stresses defenses. The Midshipmen are looking for just the sixth 10-win season in Navy history.

OU can't convert on the onside kick. Navy wraps up a 10-win season. The Sooners end up 6-7 for their second losing season in three years. —Jeff Patterson, Staff writer More:OU football crumbles in Armed Forces Bowl loss vs Navy after hot start | 5 takeaways Brent Venables went for the win, but Navy was ready. Justin Reid sacked Michael Hawkins Jr. as the Sooners went for a go-ahead, 2-point try with six seconds left. It was a wild drive that gave the Sooners a shot at the win, going 65 yards in 13 plays. OU overcame a controversial incompletion ruling on a third-down pass to Jake Roberts, converting on a fourth-down pass to Roberts. A defensive holding penalty on third-and-17 gave OU the ball at the 21 with 20 seconds left. Then Hawkins connected on an 11-yard pass to Jacob Jordan before hitting a wide open Roberts for a 10-yard score. —Jeff Patterson, Staff writer More:OU football suffers 'humiliating' Armed Forces Bowl loss to Navy: Social media reacts Brent Venables and the Sooners only had to use one timeout, holding Navy to a quick three-and-out. A block-in-the-back penalty on the punt backed up OU to the 35-yard line. OU has two timeouts and 1:47 to go 65 yards for the tying score. —Jeff Patterson, Staff writer More:Zac Alley addresses rumors linking OU football defensive coordinator to West Virginia job It's the same old song and dance for the OU offense, which only moved the ball 13 yards in five plays and featured another crucial dropped pass. The Sooners opted to punt on fourth-and-9 after Jake Roberts couldn't corral Michael Hawkins' third-down pass. Navy takes over at its 5-yard line. The Sooners still have all three timeouts left. —Jeff Patterson, Staff writer More:R Mason Thomas still weighing decision to return to OU football team in 2025 Blake Horvath capped a 12-play, 66-yard drive with a 6-yard touchdown run to give Navy its first lead of the day. One play earlier, Horvath converted a fourth-and-3 pass to Eli Heidenreich for 16 yards. —Jeff Patterson, Staff writer Another five-minute drive ended with no points for the Sooners. After Gavin Sawchuk bobbled a third-down pass, the Sooners settled for a 52-yard field-goal attempt, but Zach Schmit hooked it right. The Sooners are still outgaining the Midshipmen 365-244, but the momentum has shifted to Navy's side. —Jeff Patterson, Staff writer Michael Hawkins looked like he’d made up for his fumble. Hawkins ripped off an apparent 56-yard touchdown run that would’ve put the Sooners back in front. Hawkins danced as he was surrounded by teammates in the back of the end zone. But more than 60 yards behind Hawkins, a flag was on the ground. OU lineman Febechi Nwaiwu was called for holding, bringing the ball back to the OU 34. Heading into the fourth quarter, the Sooners are outgaining Navy 343-244. —Ryan Aber, Staff writer OU avoided disaster. After a turnover the ball deep in Sooners’ territory, OU’s defense came up with a big stop, and Midshipmen kicker Nathan Kirkwood pushed a 38-yard field goal attempt just right right to keep the score tied. —Ryan Aber, Staff writer All of the momentum is going Navy’s way. On the first play after Blake Horvath’s 95-yard touchdown run, OU quarterback Michael Hawkins fumbled, giving the Midshipmen the ball at the Sooners 26. It was the first turnover of the day for either team. —Ryan Aber, Staff writer Blake Horvath’s 95-yard touchdown run tied it late in the third quarter. The run set a Navy record for the longest touchdown run and set an Armed Forces Bowl record for longest play. Horvath’s run was the longest offensive play allowed by the Sooners since Texas’ Major Applewhite’s 97-yard pass to Wayne McGarity in 1998. —Ryan Aber, Staff writer Luke Elzinga bounced back from an 11-yard punt, pinning Navy inside their own 5 on a pooch punt. OU drove to the Navy 45 before the drive stalled there. The Sooners’ drive lasted nearly five minutes. Navy holds a narrow 18:38-16:28 edge in time of possessions. Neither team has completed a pass in the second half so far. —Ryan Aber, Staff writer OU’s defense bent once again but then bowed up to hold the Midshipmen near midfield on the first drive of the second half. The drive took more than five minutes off the clock. OU is outgaining Navy 273-142, including 163-55 through the air. Navy’s punt gave OU the ball at the Sooners' 20. —Ryan Aber, Staff writer Zion Kearney dropped what would’ve been a massive gain on second-and-10 from the OU 21, virtually ending the Sooners hopes of extending their lead before halftime. Michael Hawkins Jr. scrambled for a bit before finding a wide open Kearney inside Navy territory. But the throw was slightly underthrown but Kearney still had a great chance to catch the ball. Kearney couldn’t haul it in, though, staying on his knees for a few moments, frustrated by his drop. Without any timeouts, the Sooners ultimately played conservatively and took a touchdown lead into the break. OU is outgaining Navy 265-121 at the break. The Sooners have 14 first downs compared to Navy’s four. —Ryan Aber, Staff writer OU’s defense came up with a stop after a rare bad punt from Luke Elzinga gave Navy strong field position in the final three minutes. The Sooners held Navy to a three-and-out to get the ball back with 1:39 remaining in the half. Kip Lewis leads OU so far with four tackles. —Ryan Aber, Staff writer The momentum continues to go Navy’s way. After holding the Sooners to a three-and-out, the Midshipmen will get the ball back with less than three minutes left — and in OU territory. OU punter Luke Elzinga had a rare shank, with just an 11-yard punt after Michael Hawkins’ pass on third-and-16 fell incomplete. —Ryan Aber, Staff writer With a short field, Navy finally took advantage against the Sooners’ defense. The Midshipmen drove 45 yards on six plays, capped by an 11-yard touchdown run by fullback Alex Tecza. OU had a chance to bring down Tecza two short of the first-down marker on third-and-6 but Tecza bounced through the tackles and finished off the run into the end zone. The big play on the drive was a 21-yard pass after Navy lined up on third-and-1 looking like Blake Horvath was going to try a keeper. Horvath instead pulled up and found Cody Howard for a 21-yard gain to set up Tecza’s touchdown run three plays later. —Ryan Aber, Staff writer Once again, OU couldn’t convey on short yardage. The Sooners were stopped twice at their own 45, with Gavin Sawchuk stopped for no gain on third down and Michael Hawkins Jr. stopped short of the line-to-gain on fourth down for OU’s second consecutive turnover on downs to give Navy the ball inside Sooners territory. OU is outgaining the Midshipmen 227-79. —Ryan Aber, Staff writer OU finally went a defensive drive without allowing a big play. But the Sooners will start inside their own 10 after a 70-yard punt pinned the Sooners at the 8. OU’s defense held Navy to a three-and-out after turning the ball over on downs at the Navy 20. —Ryan Aber, Staff writer In his final game in a long Sooners career, Woodi Washington has his first career reception. Washington caught a 28-yard pass on a fake punt to keep the Sooners’ drive alive. Punter Luke Elzinga, a former high school quarterback, completed the pass and is now 3 for 3 for 68 yards on fake punts this season. The Sooners faced fourth-and-3 from their own 44. But OU still came up empty on the drive, after Navy’s Kyle Jacob stopped Xavier Robinson for no gain on fourth-and-1 from the Navy 20. —Ryan Aber, Staff writer OU’s defense once again had one busted play but once again, the Sooners’ tightened down after that. A play after Ethan Downs hit Blake Horvath for a 4-yard loss, the Navy quarterback broke off a 37-yard run. But then the Sooners stopped the Midshipmen, including forcing an incomplete pass on fourth-and-5 from the 25 to put the ball back in the hands of their offense. —Ryan Aber, Staff writer Michael Hawkins Jr. scrambled from one side of the field to the other. But instead of taking off running with plenty of space in front of him, Hawkins floated a pass downfield to freshman wide receiver Zion Kearney for a 56-yard touchdown pass. The touchdown reception was the first of Kearney’s career and the first touchdown pass for Hawkins since Sept. 21 against Tennessee. OU is outgaining Navy 140-39. —Ryan Aber, Staff writer OU’s first look at the triple option mostly went smoothly. Navy did burn the Sooners for a 32-yard pass on third down to start, but then OU forced a punt a few plays later to put the ball back in its defense’s hands. The Midshipmen gained seven yards on four running plays on the drive. —Ryan Aber, Staff writer Gavin Sawchuk already has more yards than he did in any game this season. Sawchuk had four carries for 37 yards on the Sooners’ first drive of the game, including a 21-yard touchdown run to cap off OU’s nine-play, 65-yard scoring drive. Freshman quarterback Michael Hawkins Jr. was 3 for 3 for 19 yards with two carries for nine yards on the opening drive. Sawchuk hadn’t had a run of longer than eight yards this season entering the game but had a nine-yard run on his second carry of the game and then four plays later, took it 21 yards for the score. He hadn’t had more than 16 yards in any game coming in. Sawchuk made his first start since Sept. 14 against Tulane. —Ryan Aber, Staff writer More:Navy football coach Brian Newberry shares 'pretty neat' bond with Oklahoma father and son OU wide receiver Deion Burks is not suited up during warmups ahead of the Armed Forces Bowl against Navy on Friday. Burks missed seven regular-season games this season due to injury and finished with 31 catches for 245 yards and three touchdowns. Burks said last Monday he was practicing with the team during bowl prep and hoped to play. The former Purdue standout announced earlier this month he intends to return to the Sooners in 2025. With Nic Anderson, Andrel Anthony, Jalil Farooq, J.J. Hester, Jaquaize Pettaway and Brenen Thompson gone, Burks is expected to be the leader in the room in 2025. “Easy decision, man,” Burks said of his decision. “Just want to come back. ...

                "content": "The Navy Midshipmen recovered from a 14-0 deficit and won the Armed Force Bowl over the Oklahoma Sooners 21-20. The Sooners scored a touchdown with six seconds remaining and opted to go for two and take the lead, but quarterback Michael Hawkins Jr. was sacked on the attempt, and Navy held onto the lead. The Midshipmen were led by quarterback Blake Horvath, who also had a 95-yard rushing touchdown, which broke the program record for the longest rushing attempt. He ran in a pair of touchdowns to help give Navy the victory here. Oklahoma (6-7) saw that true freshman quarterback Michael Hawkins Jr. could be special in the future and should lead the program going forward. Navy (10-3) secured a double-digit win season and now has some changes coming with its upperclassmen. Let’s dive deeper into the box scores and discuss how this game played out.

They kept drives alive by going 11-of-19 on third downs but went 2-of-4 on fourth down attempts. The team ran the ball 40 times and averaged 4.0 yards per carry while also passing for 6.3 yards per pass. The Navy Midshipmen only recorded 11 first downs and 318 total yards of offense but were able to do well. Their calling card is the ability to run the football and they had 40 rushing attempts but averaged 5.7 yards per carry (226 rushing yards). The passing game was not as crisp as usual but they managed 7-of-13 for 92 yards (7.1 yards per attempt). The Midshipmen only committed four penalties in the game for 40 yards and that's a key factor that might get overlooked. Below are the scoring plays that occurred throughout the game.

                "content": "If not listed, please contact your TV provider. FORT WORTH, Texas (AP) Blake Horvath set a Navy record with a 95-yard touchdown run and then scored a go-ahead 6-yarder with 4:34 left as the Midshipmen overcame an early two-touchdown deficit and stopped a late 2-point conversion attempt to beat Oklahoma 21-20 in the Armed Forces Bowl on Friday. The Sooners (6-7) got a 10-yard touchdown pass from Michael Hawkins Jr. to Jake Roberts with six seconds left. They then went for the win, but Hawkins was sacked by Justin Reed on the conversion try. “It was a great play that I was able to make,” Reed said, quickly crediting the rest of the defense. “We just made sure that we stayed composed after them just getting that touchdown.” Just two weeks after a dominating win over Army for the Commander-in-Chief's Trophy, the Midshipmen (10-3) reached 10 wins for the sixth time. The last 10-win season had been in 2019, which had been their last winning season. “Well, it’s the perfect ending,” second-year Navy head coach Brian Newberry said. “You’re down 14-0, I think it kind of symbolizes everything that these guys have been through, especially the seniors, symbolizes how things started. Things looked bleak, things weren’t going great, adversity and they kept scratching and clawing and fighting.” Horvath's record run on a sprint down the middle of the field tied the game at 14 late in third quarter. He then put Navy ahead for the first time on his 6-yard TD run, one play after he converted a fourth-and-3 with a 16-yard pass to Eli Heidenrich. “I thought if we go score right there, that might be the difference in the game. And it was,” Newberry said of going for it on fourth down in that 12-play, 66-yard drive that took 7 1/2 minutes. Horvath ran 18 times for 155 yards, and completed 7 of 12 passes for 92 yards. Alex Tecza had an 11-yard TD run for the Midshipmen. Oklahoma went up after Gavin Sawchuk’s 21-yard TD on the opening drive, when he had 37 yards after only 61 in his other eight games this season. It was 14-0 with 5:56 left in the first quarter after Hawkins rolled left, reversed field and got almost to the other side of the field before throwing to Zion Kearney for a 56-yard catch-and-run TD. “Came out pretty strong, but second quarter I think we got a little relaxed ... we weren't together as a team,” Hawkins said. “We got back on track after that, but going into a game like this, you have to stay on track the whole game.” Oklahoma wrapped up its first season in the Southeastern Conference with their second 6-7 record in coach Brent Venables' three seasons. The Sooners had a much different-looking roster than the regular season. More than two dozen players went into the transfer portal, and the Sooners were also without standout linebacker Danny Stutsman and safety Billy Bowman, who bypassed playing to begin preparation for the NFL draft. “Obviously not the year we wanted to have, but although there’s a lot of disappointment, there’s been a ton of growth,” Sooners hometown tight end Jake Roberts said. “You learn how to fight through adversity.” Oklahoma: While the Sooners played in a bowl for the 26th consecutive season, they had 23 winning seasons in a row before Venables took over as head coach. ... Hawkins was hampered by at least six dropped passes while throwing to a group whose only scholarship receivers were freshmen. Navy: The Midshipmen are 2-0 against Oklahoma, the only other meeting a 10-0 win at Norman in 1965. They beat an SEC team for the first time since a 21-0 win over Mississippi in the Sugar Bowl on New Year’s Day 1955. Oklahoma opens Venables’ fourth season at home Aug. 30 against FCS team Illinois State. Venables has a 22-17 record. Navy returns Horvath and all of its offensive skill starters next season, which begins Aug. 30 at home against VMI. --- Get poll alerts and updates on the AP Top 25 throughout the season.

                "title": "USC Trojans football - Wikipedia",
                "content": "The USC Trojans football program represents the University of Southern California in the sport of American football. The Trojans compete in the Football Bowl Subdivision (FBS) of the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) and the Big Ten Conference (Big Ten). Formed in 1888, the program has over 860 wins and claims 11 national championships, including 7 from the major wire-service: AP Poll and/or Coaches Poll.[3] USC has had 13 undefeated seasons including 8 perfect seasons, and 37 conference championships. The Trojans have produced eight Heisman Trophy winners and 531 NFL draft picks, with the Heismans being the most all-time by a university, and NFL draft picks 1 behind Notre Dame's 532[4] USC alumni include 84 first-team Consensus All-Americans, including 27 unanimous selections, and 35 College Football Hall of Fame members, including former players Matt Leinart, O. J. Simpson, and Ronnie Lott and former coaches John McKay and Howard Jones. The Trojans boast 14 inductees in the Pro Football Hall of Fame, tied with Notre Dame for most of any school, including Junior Seau, Bruce Matthews, Marcus Allen, and Ron Yary.[5] Among all colleges and universities, as of 2022, USC holds the all-time record for the most quarterbacks (17) and is tied with the University of Miami for the most wide receivers (40) to play in the NFL.[6] The Trojans have 55 bowl appearances, 39 of which are among the New Year's Six Bowls. With a record of 35–20, USC has the second highest all-time post-season winning percentage of schools with 50 or more bowl appearances.[7] The Trojans play their home games in the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum, which is located in Exposition Park adjacent to USC's University Park, Los Angeles campus.[8][9] USC first fielded a football team in 1888. Playing its first game on November 14 of that year against the Alliance Athletic Club, USC achieved a 16–0 victory. Frank Suffel and Henry H. Goddard were playing coaches for the first team which was put together by quarterback Arthur Carroll, who in turn volunteered to make the pants for the team and later became a tailor.[10] USC faced its first collegiate opponent the following year in fall 1889, playing St. Vincent's College to a 40–0 victory.[10] In 1893, USC joined the Intercollegiate Football Association of Southern California (the forerunner of the SCIAC), which was composed of USC, Occidental College, Throop Polytechnic Institute (Cal Tech), and Chaffey College. Pomona College was invited to enter, but declined to do so. An invitation was also extended to Los Angeles High School.[11] Before they were named Trojans in 1912, USC athletic teams were called the Methodists (occasionally the \"Fighting Methodists\"), as well as the Wesleyans. During the early years, limitations in travel and the scarcity of major football-playing colleges on the West Coast limited its rivalries to local Southern Californian colleges and universities. During this period USC played regular series against Occidental, Caltech, Whittier, Pomona and Loyola. The first USC team to play outside of Southern California went to Stanford University on November 4, 1905, where they were trampled 16–0 by the traditional West Coast powerhouse. While the teams would not meet again until 1918 (Stanford dropped football for rugby union during the intervening years), this was also USC's first game against a future Pac-12 conference opponent and the beginning of its oldest rivalry. During this period USC also played its first games against other future Pac-12 rivals, including Oregon State (1914), California (1915), Oregon (1915), Arizona (1916) and Utah (1915-1917, 1919). Between 1911 and 1913, USC followed the example of California and Stanford and dropped football in favor of rugby union. The results were disastrous, as USC was soundly defeated by more experienced programs while the school itself experienced financial reverses; it was during this period that Owen R. Bird, a sportswriter for the Los Angeles Times, coined the nickname \"Trojans\", which he wrote was \"owing to the terrific handicaps under which the athletes, coaches and managers of the university were laboring and against the overwhelming odds of larger and better equipped rivals, the name 'Trojan' suitably fitted the players.\"[10] After several decades of competition, USC first achieved national prominence under head coach \"Gloomy\" Gus Henderson in the early 1920s. Another milestone came under Henderson in 1922, when USC joined the Pacific Coast Conference (PCC), the forerunner of the modern Pac-12. Success continued under coach Howard Jones from 1925 to 1940, when the Trojans were just one of a few nationally dominant teams. It was during this era that the team achieved renown as the \"Thundering Herd\", earning its first four national titles. USC achieved intermittent success in the years following Jones' tenure. Jeff Cravath, who coached from 1942 to 1950, won the Rose Bowl in 1943 and 1945. Jess Hill, who coached from 1951 to 1956, won the Rose Bowl in 1953. From 1957 to 1959, the Trojans were coached by Don Clark. Future Hall of Famer Ron Mix was an All American for the Trojans in 1959. The program entered a new golden age upon the arrival of head coach John McKay (1960–1975). During this period the Trojans produced two Heisman Trophy winners (Mike Garrett and O. J. Simpson) and won four national championships (1962, 1967, 1972 and 1974). McKay's influence continued even after he departed for the NFL when an assistant coach, John Robinson (1976–1982), took over as head coach. Under Robinson, USC won another national championship in 1978 (shared with Alabama; ironically, USC defeated Alabama, 24–14, that same season) and USC produced two more running-back Heisman Trophy winners in Charles White and Marcus Allen On September 12, 1970, USC opened the season visiting the University of Alabama under legendary coach Paul \"Bear\" Bryant and became the first fully integrated team to play in the state of Alabama.[12] The game, scheduled by Bryant, resulted in a dominating 42–21 win by the Trojans. More importantly, all six touchdowns scored by USC team were by black players, two by USC running back Sam \"Bam\" Cunningham, against an all-white Crimson Tide team.[13] After the game, Bryant was able to persuade the university to allow black players to play, hastening the racial integration of football at Alabama and in the Deep South.[12][14] In the 1980s, USC football did not realize a national championship, though it continued to experience relative success, with top-20 AP rankings and Pac-10 Conference championships under head coaches Ted Tollner (1983–1986) and Larry Smith (1987–1992) Each coach led the team to a win in the Rose Bowl and USC was recognized among the nation's top-ten teams three times. Despite the moderate success of team during these years, some alumni had grown accustomed to the program's stature as a perennial national championship contender. In 1993, Robinson was named head coach a second time, leading the Trojans to a victory in the 1996 Rose Bowl over Northwestern. It was during this time that the Trojans were unable to defeat their rivals. They suffered winless streaks of 13 years (1983–1995, including the 1994 17–17 tie) to rival Notre Dame and 8 years (1991–1998) to crosstown rival UCLA which were unacceptable to many USC supporters. Under Robinson the Trojans were 2–2–1 against Notre Dame, but unable to beat UCLA. After posting a 6–6 record in 1996, and a 6–5 record in 1997, Robinson was fired. In 1998, head coach Paul Hackett took over the team, but posted an even more disappointing 19–18 record in three seasons than any of his recent predecessors. By 2000, some observers surmised that USC football's days of national dominance were fading; the football team's record of 37–35 from 1996 to 2001 was their second-worst over any five-year span in history (only the mark of 29–29–2 from 1956 to 1961 was worse), and the period marked the first and only time USC had been out of the final top 20 teams for four straight years. In 2001, athletic director Mike Garrett released Hackett and hired Pete Carroll, a former NFL head coach. Carroll went 6–6 in his first year, losing to Utah in the Las Vegas Bowl, 10–6. After that, his teams became highly successful, ranking among the top ten teams in the country, with the exception of 2009 in which the team lost four regular season games. USC opened 3–2 in 2002, suffering losses to Kansas State and Washington State. However, the Trojans went on to win the rest of their games, completing the regular season 11–2 on the strength of senior quarterback Carson Palmer's breakout performance. After struggling for most of his collegiate career, Palmer excelled in the Pro Style offense installed by new offensive coordinator Norm Chow. In fact, Palmer's performance, particularly in the season-ending rivalry games against Notre Dame and UCLA, impressed so many pundits that he went on to win the Heisman Trophy, carrying every region of voting and becoming the first USC quarterback to be so honored. Despite tying for the Pac-10 title (with Washington State), having the highest BCS \"strength of schedule\" rating, and fielding the nation's top defense led by safety Troy Polamalu, USC finished the season ranked No. 5 in the BCS rankings. Facing off against BCS No. 3 Iowa in the Orange Bowl, USC defeated the Hawkeyes 38–17. In 2003, highly touted but unproven redshirt sophomore Matt Leinart took over the quarterback position from Palmer. Although his first pass went for a touchdown in a win over Auburn, the Trojans suffered an early season triple-overtime loss to their conference rival the California Golden Bears in Berkeley. After the Loss to California, USC went on a 10-game winning streak and finished the season with a record of 11–1. Before the postseason, both the coaches' poll and the AP Poll ranked USC number 1, but the BCS—which also gave consideration to computer rankings—ranked Oklahoma first, another one-loss team but one that had lost its own Big 12 Conference title game 35–7, with USC ranked third. In the 2003 BCS National Championship Game, the Sugar Bowl, BCS No. 2 LSU defeated BCS No. 1 Oklahoma 21–14. Meanwhile, BCS No. 3 USC defeated BCS No. 4 Michigan 28–14 in the Rose Bowl. USC finished the season ranked No. 1 in the AP poll and was awarded the AP National Championship; LSU, however, won the BCS National Championship title for that year, prompting a split national title between LSU and USC. In the wake of the controversy, corporate sponsors emerged who were willing to organize an LSU-USC game to settle the matter; nevertheless, the NCAA refused to permit the matchup. In 2004, USC was picked preseason No. 1 by the Associated Press, thanks to the return of Leinart as well as sophomore running backs LenDale White and Reggie Bush. The defense—led by All-American defensive tackles Shaun Cody and Mike Patterson, as well as All-American linebackers Lofa Tatupu and Matt Grootegoed—was considered to be among the finest in the nation. Key questions included the offensive line, with few returning starters, and the receiving corps, which had lost previous year's senior Keary Colbert and the breakout star of 2003, Mike Williams. Williams had tried to enter the NFL draft a year early during the Maurice Clarett trial when it was ruled that the NFL could not deny them entering the draft. The decision was appealed and overturned leaving Williams unable to enter the draft. When he applied to the NCAA for reinstatement of his eligibility, it was denied. Despite close calls against Stanford and California, the Trojans finished the regular season undefeated and headed for the 2004 BCS Championship Game at the Orange Bowl. USC was the second team in NCAA football history to have gone wire-to-wire (ranked first place from preseason to postseason since the AP began releasing preseason rankings); the first was Florida State in 1999 (two other schools went wire-to-wire before the existence of preseason polls - Notre Dame in 1943 and Army in 1945). Quarterback Leinart won the Heisman Trophy, with running back Bush placing fifth in the vote tally. The Trojans' opponent in the Orange Bowl, Oklahoma, were themselves undefeated and captained by sixth-year quarterback Jason White, who had won the Heisman in 2003; the game marked the first time in NCAA history that two players who had already won the Heisman played against each other. Most analysts expected the game to be close—as USC matched its speed and defense against the Oklahoma running game and skilled offensive line—but the reality proved to be far different. USC scored 38 points in the first half, and won the BCS National Championship Game by the score of 55–19, making them the BCS Champions and earning the team the AP National Championship as well. In June 2010, after a four-year investigation, the NCAA imposed sanctions against the Trojan football program for a \"lack of institutional control,\" including a public reprimand and censure, a two-year postseason ban, a loss of 30 scholarships over three years, and vacating all games in which Reggie Bush participated as an ineligible player (14 wins, 1 loss), including the 2005 Orange Bowl, in which the Trojans won the BCS National Championship.[15] These sanctions have been criticized by some NCAA football writers,[16][17][18][19][20] including ESPN's Ted Miller, who wrote, \"It's become an accepted fact among informed college football observers that the NCAA sanctions against USC were a travesty of justice, and the NCAA's refusal to revisit that travesty are a massive act of cowardice on the part of the organization.\"[21] Following the NCAA sanctions, BCS Executive Director Bill Hancock stated that a committee would decide whether to vacate USC's 2004 BCS Championship, but the final decision would be delayed until after the NCAA had heard USC's appeals against some of the sanctions.[22] On July 20, 2010, incoming USC president Max Nikias stated that the school would remove jerseys and murals displayed in Bush's honor from its facilities, and would return the school's copy of Bush's Heisman Trophy.[23] On September 14, Bush announced that he would forfeit the Heisman and return his copy of the trophy.[24] On May 26, 2011, the NCAA upheld all findings and penalties against USC. The team did not participate in the Pac-12 Football Championship Game or a bowl game during the 2011–12 season.[25] The BCS announced June 6, 2011, that it had stripped USC of the 2004 title,[26] but the Associated Press still recognizes USC as the 2004 AP National Champion.[27] The 2005 regular season witnessed a resuscitation of the rivalry with Notre Dame, after a last-second play in which senior quarterback Matt Leinart scored the winning touchdown with help from a controversial push from behind by running back Reggie Bush, nicknamed the \"Bush Push\". The year climaxed with a 66–19 USC defeat of cross-town rival UCLA. Running back Reggie Bush finished his stellar year by winning the Heisman Trophy (later returned by USC and reclaimed by the Heisman Trophy Trust considering Bush accepted improper benefits while at USC and was ineligible during the 2005 season),[24][28] while Leinart finished third in the Heisman voting. Several other players also earned accolades, being named All-Americans (AP, Football Coaches, Football Writers, Walter Camp, ESPN.com, SI.com, CBS Sportsline.com, Rivals.com, Collegefootballnews.com). These include QB Matt Leinart, RB Reggie Bush, RB LenDale White, S Darnell Bing, OT Taitusi Lutui, OT Sam Baker, WR Dwayne Jarrett, C Ryan Kalil, OG Fred Matua, and DE Lawrence Jackson. Additionally, OL Winston Justice did well enough to forgo his senior year and enter the NFL draft. The regular season ended with two clear-cut contenders facing off in the Rose Bowl to decide the national championship. Both USC and Texas were 12–0 entering the game; although USC was the slight favorite,[29] USC lost to Texas 41–38.[30] As with the 2004 season, later NCAA investigations into alleged improper benefits given to Reggie Bush altered the official record of the 2005 Trojan season. All twelve wins from the 2005 season were officially vacated. Reggie Bush would eventually manage to have his USC statistics and 2005 Heisman Trophy reinstated.[31] Despite this, anything which USC lost as a result of what the NCAA imposed against the team for the 2004 and 2005 seasons has still not been recovered, including a national title win.[32] For the 2006 football season, USC tried to rebuild its strength following the loss of offensive stalwarts Leinart, Bush, and White, defensive leader Bing, and offensive linemen Matua, Justice, and Lutui. The Trojans developed their offense using unproven QB John David Booty and returning star receivers Dwayne Jarrett and Steve Smith along with second-year wide-out Patrick Turner. Mark Sanchez, the highly touted QB of the recruiting class of 2005 (Mission Viejo High School) was widely viewed as a dark horse to win the starting job from Booty, although Booty was named the starter at the end of fall training camp. The starting tailback position was initially a battle between returning players Chauncey Washington and Desmond Reed (both recovering from injuries) and heralded recruits Stafon Johnson (Dorsey High School in Los Angeles), C.J. Gable, Allen Bradford and Emmanuel Moody. USC had many experienced players as well, including linebacker Dallas Sartz and wide receiver Chris McFoy, who had already graduated with their bachelor's degrees and were pursuing master's degrees. Fullback Brandon Hancock would have been part of that group as well until an injury ended his collegiate career. Additionally, fifth-year (redshirt) senior linebacker Oscar Lua, running back Ryan Powdrell and offensive lineman Kyle Williams were expected to either start or play frequently in 2006. The 2006 Trojans came out strong, easily defending their top 10 status throughout the year. As the season progressed, USC began to display marked inconsistencies, as their margins of victory began to slip. The first setback proved to be a 31–33 loss to unranked Oregon State, in which the Beavers were able to repeatedly capitalize on several Trojan turnovers.[33] Even though USC dropped initially in the polls, they worked their way back up. After defeating both Cal and Notre Dame, they held the number 2 spot heading into the final week of the season. The Trojans were considered to be a virtual lock for the BCS National Championship Game against Ohio State and just needed to beat UCLA. USC was shocked in the final game of the season, losing to crosstown rival UCLA 13–9. This eliminated the Trojans from championship contention and opened the door for Florida to become Ohio State's opponent. The Trojans did earn a Rose Bowl bid and defeated Michigan 32–18. It was the Trojans' fifth straight BCS Bowl appearance. On January 6, 2007, six days after the Rose Bowl Game, USC kicker Mario Danelo was found dead at the bottom of the White Point Cliff near Point Fermin Lighthouse in San Pedro, California.[34] In July 2007, ESPN.com named USC its No. 1 team of the decade for the period between 1996 and 2006, citing the Trojans' renaissance and dominance under Carroll.[35][36] The 2007 Trojans were the presumptive No. 1 pick before the season.[37][38] However, they lost two games, including a major upset to 41-point underdog Stanford, and they did not get into the national championship game. However, the Trojans did win their sixth conference championship and defeated Illinois in the 2008 Rose Bowl Game. Under Carroll, USC was known to attract numerous celebrities to its practices, including USC alumni Will Ferrell, George Lucas, LeVar Burton, and Sophia Bush as well as Snoop Dogg, Henry Winkler, Kirsten Dunst, Nick Lachey, Dr. Dre, Spike Lee, Alyssa Milano, Flea, Wilmer Valderrama, Jake Gyllenhaal and Andre 3000.[39] The Trojans benefited from Los Angeles's lack of NFL teams (with the Los Angeles Rams and Raiders having left in the early 1990s), combined with the Trojans' 21st century success, leading them to sometimes be called LA's \"de facto NFL team.\"[40] During Pete Carroll's first eight years as head coach, USC lost only one game by more than seven points, a 27–16 loss at Notre Dame in his first season, until the second half of the 2009 season. The early part of the 2000s also saw the rise of USC football's popularity in the Los Angeles market: without any stadium expansions, USC broke its average home attendance record four times in a row: reaching 77,804 in 2003, 85,229 in 2004, 90,812 in 2005 and over 91,416 with one game to go in 2006 (the capacity of the Coliseum is 92,000). As of 2022, USC is one of only two of the 131 Football Bowl Subdivision (formerly Division I-A) teams to have never played a Football Championship Subdivision (formerly Division I-AA) team since the split of Division I football in 1978.[41] After beating Penn State in the Rose Bowl, USC finished the season 12–1, and ranked No. 2 in the Coaches' Poll and No. 3 in the AP Poll. The 2008 season culminated in USC's seventh straight Pac-10 Championship, seventh straight BCS bowl appearance and seventh straight finish in the top 4 of the AP Poll. This also marked seven consecutive seasons where USC has not lost a game by more than 7 points. Their only loss was on the road against Oregon State, which was mentioned in the preseason as a possible upset.[42][43] After beating Boston College in the Emerald Bowl, USC finished the season 9–4, and ranked No. 20 in the Coaches' Poll and No. 22 in the AP Poll. USC ended its seven-year streak of Pac-10 Championship, BCS bowl appearance and top 4 finish of the AP Poll. The Trojans started the season strong beating No. 8 Ohio State at The Horseshoe. But they would lose to four Pac-10 teams (Washington, Oregon, Stanford, and Arizona). Blowout losses to Oregon 47–20 and Stanford 55–21 marked a turning point in USC's season and sparked debate in the media about the future dominance of USC football. After the season concluded, head coach Pete Carroll resigned to accept a head coaching position with the Seattle Seahawks. In 2009, USC was named \"Team of the Decade\" by both CBSSports.com and Football.com, as well as the \"Program of the Decade\" by SI.com, plus was No. 1 in CollegeFootballNews.com's \"5-Year Program Rankings\" and was ranked No. 2 in ESPN.com's \"Prestige Rankings\" among all schools since 1936 (behind Oklahoma).[44] Additionally, in 2009, ESPN.com ranked USC the second-best program in college football history. On January 12, 2010, Lane Kiffin was hired as the head coach. This came following Pete Carroll's departure from USC to become the head coach of the Seattle Seahawks.[45] In June 2010, after a prolonged four-year investigation into whether former USC running back Reggie Bush and his family had accepted financial benefits and housing from two sports agents in San Diego while he was a student athlete at USC, the NCAA imposed sanctions against the Trojan football program for a \"lack of institutional control,\" including a two-year postseason ban, the loss of 30 scholarships over three years, and the vacation of all wins in which Bush participated as an \"ineligible\" player, including the 2005 Orange Bowl, in which the Trojans won the BCS National Championship.[15] These sanctions have been criticized by many NCAA football writers,[16][17][18][19][20] including ESPN's Ted Miller, who wrote, \"It's become an accepted fact among informed college football observers that the NCAA sanctions against USC were a travesty of justice, and the NCAA's refusal to revisit that travesty are a massive act of cowardice on the part of the organization.\"[21] The 2010 team finished 8–5 (5–4 in the Pac-10) and was ineligible for post-season play. On February 9, 2010, Commissioner Larry Scott announced that the Pac-10 would be considering expanding to twelve schools.[46] The Pac-10 Conference officially became the Pac-12 Conference following the addition of Colorado and Utah on July 1, 2011. In 2011, although USC finished in first place in its conference division with a 7–2 record, due to their ineligibility to participate in a bowl game, the UCLA Bruins became champions of the inaugural Pac-12 South Division.[47] In the final regular-season game, USC's 50–0 win over UCLA was the largest margin of victory in the rivalry since 1930. The release of the December 4, 2011, final regular-season Associated Press college football poll marked USC's return to national prominence with the No. 5 ranking.[48] The Trojans were not eligible for postseason play and did not participate in any Bowl game. When the final AP Football Poll was released, USC dropped one spot to the No. 6 ranking. USC was ranked number one in The Associated Press' preseason college football poll for the seventh time in school history and the first time in five seasons, edging out No. 2 Alabama and No. 3 LSU.[49] However, the early season expectations would backfire as the Trojans would eventually finish 7–5 (5–4 versus Pac-12 opponents), including losses to all three of their major rivals (Notre Dame, UCLA, and Stanford) all in the same year for the first time since 1992. The team finished second in the Pac-12 South standings and unranked in any poll. The 2013 USC Trojans football team finished the season 10–4, 6–3 in Pac-12 play to finish in a tie for second place in the South Division. They were invited to the Las Vegas Bowl where they defeated Fresno State. Head coach Lane Kiffin, who was in his fourth year, was fired on September 29 after a 3–2 start to the season. He was replaced by interim head coach Ed Orgeron. At the end of the regular season, Washington head coach Steve Sarkisian was hired as the new head coach beginning in 2014. This prompted Orgeron to resign before the bowl game. Clay Helton led the Trojans in the Las Vegas Bowl. Steve Sarkisian, in his first year as head coach at USC, led the Trojans to a 9–4 season (6–3 in the Pac-12) to finish in a three-way tie for second place in the South Division. They were invited to the Holiday Bowl where they defeated Nebraska 45-42.[50] On September 8, 2014, Sarkisian and athletic director Pat Haden were reprimanded by Pac-12 Conference commissioner Larry Scott for attempting \"to influence the officiating, and ultimately the outcome of a contest\" during the game against Stanford two days earlier.[51] The 2015 season was a tumultuous one for the Trojans with a season record of 8–4 overall and 6–3 in Pac-12 play to finish as Pac-12 Southern Conference champions. Mid-season, coach Steve Sarkisian was fired to deal with personal issues, and Clay Helton was again named the interim head coach. ESPN later reported that Sarkisian came to a pre-practice meeting, appearing to be intoxicated. According to Scott Wolf, the USC beat writer for the Los Angeles Daily News, several players smelled alcohol on Sarkisian's breath.[52] The Trojans had lost to Stanford and Washington under Sarkisian. Under Helton, USC lost to Notre Dame, but then rallied to win the next four games. A loss to Oregon left the South Division conference championship to be decided by the USC-UCLA game; USC won 40–21. USC played in its first-ever Pac-12 Conference championship game, losing to Stanford (41–22) after the Cardinal (8-1 in Pac-12, 9-2 overall) locked up the North Division title, its third in four years, with its victory over California. USC went on to lose the 2015 Holiday Bowl 23–21 to the Wisconsin Badgers. Zach Banner started all 14 games at tackle, was First Team All-Pac-12, and won USC's Offensive Lineman of the Year Award after allowing only nine total pressures on 426 pass attempts, according to Pro Football Focus, which graded him as the season's top pass-blocking right tackle.[53][54][55] On December 7, Sarkisian filed a $30 million termination lawsuit against USC.[25] The 2016 USC Trojans football season marked Clay Helton's first full season as USC head coach. The team finished the season 10–3, (7–2 Pac-12), finishing as the runner-up of the South Division title and as Rose Bowl champions. After a 1–3 start during the month of September that featured losses to teams such as No. 1 Alabama, No. 7 Stanford, and No. 24 Utah, the Trojans began a nine-game winning streak to end their season. Some notable wins include victories over No. 21 Colorado, No. 4 Washington, and No. 5 Penn State in the Rose Bowl. Sam Darnold, a redshirt freshman quarterback, became the starter over Max Browne (1–2 record as starting QB) a few days before the Utah game. With that, the Trojans received much-needed stability after years of turmoil and coaching changes. The season was capped off with a dramatic 52–49 win in the Rose Bowl over Penn State, their first Rose Bowl victory in 8 years. USC finished No. 3 in the final AP polls for the season. Zach Banner, captain of the team, was again All-Pac-12 first-team, was CollegeSportsMadness.com All American first-team, Senior CLASS Award All-American first-team, Phil Steele All-Pac-12 first-team, a finalist for the Senior CLASS Award (given to the nation's top senior excelling in community/classroom/character/competition), and was the team's Co-Offensive Lineman of the Year.[54][56] Entering the season, the Trojans were ranked No. 4 in the AP Poll's preseason rankings. They finished the season 11–3, 8–1 in Pac-12, to be champions of the South Division. They represented the South Division in the Pac-12 Championship Game where they defeated Stanford to become Pac-12 Champions.[57] They were invited to play in the Cotton Bowl against Ohio State, but lost 24–7. In the final AP poll, they were ranked No. 12.[58] Notable players to depart to the NFL include Sam Darnold and Ronald Jones II.[59] Darnold is the 5th USC quarterback to be drafted in the first round of the NFL since 1967.[59] Though ranked No. 15 in the AP Poll's preseason rankings, the Trojans finished the season 5–7, (4–5 Pac-12), the program's first losing record since 2000 where they held the same record.[60] USC lost to both of its major rivals, UCLA and Notre Dame, in the same season for the first time since 2013, and it also lost to all other California Pac-12 schools (UCLA, California, and Stanford) in the same season for the first time since 1996.[60] They tied Arizona for third place in the Pac-12 South Division.[60] On November 25, USC athletic director Lynn Swann announced that head coach Clay Helton would return in 2019.[61] The Trojans finished the regular season 8–4, (7–2 Pac-12), holding second place in the Pac-12's South Division. USC was 2–3 against ranked teams. Following the regular season, they lost to the Iowa Hawkeyes in the Holiday Bowl 24–49.[62] On September 24, the conference announced that a six-game conference-only season would begin on November 6 with the conference's championship game to be played on December 18 after initially announcing in August that all fall sports competitions were cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic.[63] Teams not selected for the championship game would be seeded to play a seventh game.[64] The Trojans finished the regular season with a 5–0 record, and qualified for the Pac-12 Championship Game, which they lost to Oregon 24–31. The following day, USC announced that it would not play in any bowl game, ending the season with an overall 5–1 record.[65] The Trojans were led by sixth-year head coach Clay Helton in the first two games. Helton was subsequently fired on September 13 following the team's 42–28 loss to Stanford.[66] Associate head coach Donte Williams took over as the team's interim head coach.[66] They finished the 2021 season with 4–8, their worst record since 1991 where they went 3–8.[67] They were not bowl eligible for the second time in 4 years (they were not bowl eligible the 2018 season after finishing with a 5-7 record). On November 28, 2021, Lincoln Riley was named the 30th head coach coming off of a five year stint at Oklahoma. First-year offensive coordinator Josh Henson and first-year defensive coordinator Alex Grinch[68] are both intended to coach alongside him for the season. As of February 28, USC's recruiting class was ranked 65th among NCAA D1 schools.[69] A notable incoming transfer is QB Caleb Williams, who reunites with Lincoln Riley from Oklahoma.[70] The Trojans went on to improve dramatically over their 2021 season, going from finishing 4-8, to 10-1, and being ranked #5 in the AP poll as of Week 12. During Lincoln Riley's inaugural season, the Trojans racked up wins against Rice 66-14, Stanford 41-28, Fresno State 45-17, Oregon State 17-14, Arizona State 42-25, and Washington State 30-14 before losing a close match to #20 ranked Utah 43-42. After this setback, the Trojans would bounce back and go on to beat Arizona 45-37, California 41-35, Colorado 55-17, and #16 ranked UCLA 48-45, clinching them a spot in the Pac-12 Championship. USC football started their last year in the Pac-12 ranked #6 in the pre-season AP Poll.[71] The team, under the coaching guidance of Lincoln Riley, and with the second year of on field leadership by quarterback Caleb Williams won four games (San Jose State, Nevada, Stanford, and Arizona State) by impressive margins with over 40 offensive points on the board resulting in a bump in the polls to #5.[72] USC won its next two games against Colorado and Arizona, scoring 40 offensive points. But the winning margins were squashed to only 7 and 2 points, respectively, with the Trojans' 43-41 3OT win against Arizona on October 7, 2023.[73] These close results dropped USC's ranking to #10.[74] USC lost five of its six next games, ending the season outside the top 25 with an overall record of 7-5 and a conference record of 5-4.[75] Entering the season Williams was the favorite to win the Heisman Trophy for the second year in a row, but after a disappointing second half of the season he was eliminated from contention leading into the December ceremony.[76] USC played the #16 Louisville Cardinals in the 2023 Holiday Bowl without Williams, who instead turned his focus to the NFL draft.[77] The Trojans ended up winning the game 42-28, with Miller Moss throwing a record 6 touchdown passes in the process.[78] USC has won 17 national championships from NCAA-designated major selectors.[79]: 112–115 USC claims 11 national championships,[80] including 7 from the major wire-service: AP Poll and/or Coaches' Poll. Two of USC's championships, 1928 and 1939, are based on the Dickinson System, a formula devised by a University of Illinois professor that awarded national championships between 1926 and 1940. The Dickinson System is cited in the Official 2010 NCAA FBS Record Book as a legitimate national title selector.[81] USC's claim is consistent with other FBS programs that won the Dickinson title. In 2004, USC recognized the 1939 squad as one of their national championship teams.[82][83][84] The 2004 team was forced to vacate the final two games of its season, including the 2005 Orange Bowl due to NCAA sanctions incurred as a result of loss of institutional control, and namely, in connection with Reggie Bush. USC appealed the sanctions, delaying consideration of vacating USC's 2004 championship by the BCS. Ultimately, USC lost the appeals and forfeited the 2004 BCS championship.[85] The AP did not vacate its 2004 championship, hence the Trojans retain a share of the national title.[85] ^Claimed national championships - USC claims the 1928, 1931, 1932, 1939, 1962, 1967, 1972, 1974, 1978, 2003, and 2004 championships.[80] † The FWAA stripped USC of its 2004 Grantland Rice Trophy and vacated the selection of its national champion for 2004. The BCS also vacated USC's participation in the 2005 Orange Bowl and USC's 2004 BCS National Championship, and the AFCA Coaches' Poll Trophy was returned.[88][89] In addition to the Orange Bowl victory over Oklahoma, the 2004 regular season finale win against UCLA was also vacated, making the official record of 2004 USC Trojans 11-0. USC has won 39 conference championships, all within the Pac-12 Conference or its predecessors. The 2004 and 2005 championships were vacated.[90] † Co-championship ^ Vacated due to NCAA penalty USC has won 4 division championships, all in the South division of the Pac-12.[90] † Co-championship USC has a bowl game record of 35–20 through the 2023 season.[93] The Trojans appeared in 34 Rose Bowls, winning 25, both records for the bowl. These are also the most times a team has appeared in or won any bowl game. USC was banned from entering a bowl during either the 2010 or 2011 seasons as part of the extremely extensive sanctions resulting from the University of Southern California athletics scandal. Below is the list of USC's ten most recent bowl appearances. USC head coaches from 1888 to present.[94] † Does not include 14 wins and 1 loss vacated due to NCAA penalty[94]In 2013, Kiffin was fired after first 5 games, Orgeron served as interim head coach for next 8 games before resigning and Helton was interim head coach for bowl game. In 2015, Sarkisian was fired after first 5 games and Helton was interim head coach for next 7 games before becoming permanent head coach. In 2021, Helton was fired after first 2 games and Williams will serve as interim head coach for next 10 games. USC is sometimes called \"Tailback U\" (Tailback University) because a number of running backs who played for the Trojans won the Heisman Trophy.[96] These running backs include Mike Garrett (1965), O. J. Simpson (1968), Charles White (1979), Marcus Allen (1981), and Reggie Bush (2005). \"Fight On\" is the fight song of the USC Trojans. The term \"Fight On\" is also used as a battle cry, often with the two finger \"V\" salute for Victory given in accompaniment.[97] The V gesture has its origins with the ancient Trojans, who would cut off the index and middle finger of soldiers they conquered so the conquered could no longer wield a sword in battle.[98] \"Tradition surrounds certain numbers at USC, most notably 55,\" wrote Gary Klein of the Los Angeles Times.[99] \"Junior Seau, Willie McGinest, Chris Claiborne and Keith Rivers,\" he added, \"are among the linebackers who have worn a number that Trojans coaches have been careful to distribute.\" Wrote Andy Kamenetzky of ESPN.com in an article titled \"Tradition of elite linebackers alive in 55,\" \"Membership, along with the hallowed No. 55 jersey, has been offered to a select few over the past few decades. Names such as Junior Seau. Keith Rivers. Willie McGinest. Chris Claiborne. Names forever etched in USC lore.\"[100] In the first 30 years of USC football, the school maintained rivalries with local Southern California schools like Occidental and Pomona, but these ended by the 1920s when USC joined the PCC and grew into a national caliber team.[101] A \"Perfect Day\" (a phrase created by the school's football announcer Pete Arbogast) to any USC fan is a USC win coupled with losses by UCLA and Notre Dame.[102] There have been 64 \"Perfect Days\" since the first one occurred in 1921. Perfect days have been possible since 1919, when UCLA began playing football. The most recent perfect day occurred on September 23, 2023, when USC defeated Arizona State, UCLA lost to Utah, and Notre Dame lost to Ohio State. USC has a rivalry with California.[103][104][105] While not as significant as the Stanford or UCLA rivalries, for either school, USC and Cal played an annual game, and met more than 100 times. The game was often called The Weekender, referring to the weekend trip to the Bay Area; although, this term also applied to the Stanford game, as each series (USC/Cal and USC/Stanford) would alternate home and away. As of the 2023 season, USC had played Cal more than any other opponent,[106] with the 2023 game marking the 112th meeting, according to Cal,[107] and the 108th meeting according to USC,[107] with discrepancies in the game record before 1920. The last Weekender was played on October 28, 2023, with Cal losing to USC 49-50.[108] USC's record in the series was 72-32-4, as of 2023.[107] In 2024, USC will join the Big Ten Conference[109][110] while Cal will join the Atlantic Coast Conference.[111][112] This will put the rivalry between the Bears and Trojans on hiatus with no future meetings scheduled as of March 2024.[113] USC plays Notre Dame each year, with the winner keeping the Jeweled Shillelagh. The inter-sectional game has featured more national championship teams, Heisman trophy winners, All-Americans, and future NFL hall-of-famers than any other collegiate match-up. The two schools have played the game annually since 1926 (except for years 1943–1945 when World War II travel restrictions kept the game from being played or 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic). Unlike most rivalry games, the game enjoys neither the possibility of acquiring regional \"bragging rights\" nor the import of intra-league play. The game has been referred to as the greatest inter-sectional rivalry in college football.[114][115][116][117][118] Notre Dame leads the series 51–37–5 through the 2023 season.[119] Stanford is USC's oldest rival,[120] in a series that dates to 1905. In the early years of football on the West Coast, the power sat in the Bay Area with the Stanford-Cal rivalry and USC rose to challenge the two established programs. During the early and mid-20th century Stanford football occasionally enjoyed periods of great regional success on the gridiron. USC and Stanford, being the two private universities with major football teams on the west coast, naturally drew the ire of one another. During the early 2000s, however, Stanford had not maintained their earlier success and the rivalry had faded to many USC fans.[120] The rivalry was renewed with the arrival of Jim Harbaugh at Stanford in 2007. Harbaugh defeated Carroll 2–1 in their three matchups with both victories occurring in the Coliseum. In the 2009 meeting, USC sustained their worst loss in 43 years and surrendered the most points to an opponent, a record that would stand for three seasons. The game led the Los Angeles Times to declare that Stanford was \"at the top of the USC 'Must Kill' list.\"[121][122] Harbaugh added another win in 2010 against Carroll's successor Lane Kiffin before leaving after that season to become head coach of the San Francisco 49ers. USC leads the series 65–34–3 through the 2023 season.[123] USC's rivalry with UCLA is unusual in that they are one of a few pairs of Division I FBS programs that share a major city, as well as conference. Both are located within the Los Angeles city limits, approximately 10 miles (16 km) apart. Until 1982, the two schools also shared the same stadium: the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum. The crosstown rivals play each year for city bragging rights and the Victory Bell; and often for the right to go to the Rose Bowl as representative for the Pac-12. The UCLA rivalry tends to draw the focus of student supporters since many USC students have friends or family members attending \"that other school\" (of course, many UCLA students refer to their USC friends in the same manner) and many Southern California families are divided between Trojan Cardinal and Bruin Blue. The annual matchup always has both teams wearing their traditional home uniforms, featuring a Cardinal vs Blue matchup. USC leads the all-time series 50–33–7 through the 2022 season.[124] Prior to the construction of the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum in 1923, the Trojans played football in a number of facilities.[125] Before 1893, the Trojans played football in a vacant lot on Jefferson Boulevard before the lot was developed as residences. In the 1890s, USC's primary home field was Athletic Park. Several games in the 1890s and all games in 1916 were played in Fiesta Park in downtown Los Angeles. The 1900 homestand was played at Chutes Park, a facility located within a Los Angeles pleasure park shared with the Los Angeles Angels baseball team, while the 1903 season was played at nearby Prager Park. Three games in the 1910s were played at Washington Park, the successor to Chutes Park. From 1904 to 1910, 1914–15, and 1917–22, most of USC's home games were played at the on-campus Bovard Field. USC also played home games in Pasadena, at Sportsman's Park, Tournament Park, and the Rose Bowl. The Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum is one of the largest stadiums in the United States. USC has played football in the Coliseum ever since the grand stadium was built in 1923. In fact, the Trojans played in the first varsity football game ever held there (beating Pomona College 23–7 on October 6, 1923). The Coliseum hosted the opening and closing ceremonies and track events of the 1932 and 1984 Summer Olympics, and is slated to be a venue for the 2028 Summer Olympics. Over the years, the Coliseum has been home to many sports teams besides the Trojans, including UCLA football, the NFL's Los Angeles Rams and Raiders, the Los Angeles Chargers in 1960 of the AFL, and Los Angeles Dodgers baseball, including the 1959 World Series. The Coliseum has hosted various other events, from concerts and speeches to track meets and motorcycle races. The Coliseum is located on 17 acres (69,000 m2) in Exposition Park, which also houses museums, gardens and Banc of California Stadium.[126] It has also earned the nickname, “The Grand Old Lady.” The Coliseum is both managed and operated by USC[9] under a master lease agreement with the LA Memorial Coliseum Commission, as was the Los Angeles Memorial Sports Arena for a number of years prior to its 2016 demolition.[127] The Coliseum has a present full-capacity of 77,500 seats after USC completed a major $315 million renovation of the stadium in 2019 that added a new seven-story Tower on the stadium’s south side housing luxury suites, loge boxes, club seats, a new concourse with concession stands, a new press box, and rooftop club lounge.[128][129] Opened in 2012, the $70 Million, 110,000-square-foot athletic and academic center named after legendary football coach John McKay is home to the USC Trojan Football Department. The building houses meeting rooms, coaches' offices and a locker room for the football program, as well as the Stevens Academic Center (including space for tutoring, counseling, study and computer rooms for student-athletes), a weight room, an athletic training room and a state-of-the-art digital media production facility for all of USC's 21 sports.[130] The centerpiece of the McKay Center is the two-story video board in the Parker Hughes atrium, which can display six big-screen televisions at once as well as promotional videos and graphics. The building's 60,000-square-foot basement includes a weight room, athletic training room, locker rooms and a players lounge, a 25,000-square-foot ground floor with Student-Athlete Academic Services center, a reception area and outdoor courtyard, and a 25,000-square-foot second floor with football coaches' offices, football team meeting rooms, outdoor patio and a state-of-the-art video production facility. The John McKay Center is adjacent to Heritage Hall, the Galen Dining Center, Brittingham Field and the Howard Jones Field/Brian Kennedy Field practice facility.[130] The USC football team practices on campus at Howard Jones Field/Brian Kennedy Field. The facility originally known as Howard Jones Field was expanded in the fall of 1998 to include Brian Kennedy Field. In early 1999, Goux's Gate, named for the player and popular long-time assistant coach Marv Goux, was erected at the entrance to the practice field.[131] In June 2023 USC President Carl Folt announced that USC football will receive a new performance center that includes three levels dedicated to football team operations. The new 163,000 square foot complex is being built on the site of the current Brian Kennedy Field and includes two adjacent full-length outdoor practice fields – one turf and one natural grass – which players will access directly from the performance center and its three-story building. It will feature student-athlete-centric spaces - including a new locker room, multiple player lounges, a recovery hub, nutritional support, sports sciences services, a weight room, a training room and an equipment room - a team auditorium, position meeting rooms, recruiting areas, staff offices, a rooftop hospitality deck, and flexible space for future growth. Construction on the $200 million center began in 2024 and is scheduled for completion by summer 2026.[132] [133] Individual players have won numerous accolades with seven officially recognized Heisman Trophy winners, 38 College Football Hall of Fame inductees, and 157 All-Americans.[when?] USC's first consensus All-American was offensive guard Brice Taylor in 1925, who notably excelled despite missing his left hand, and who was one of USC's first black players. Eight USC players have been awarded the Heisman Trophy. All of them have also had their numbers retired by the Trojans.[134][135] In 2010, Bush's Heisman was forfeited after an NCAA investigation ruled him ineligible to participate as a student-athlete during his Trophy season. In 2024, Bush’s Heisman was reinstated and his number retired.[136][137] Chosen by Athlon Sports in 2001[139] Offense WR: Lynn Swann 71-73 WR: Keyshawn Johnson 92-95 TE: Hal Bedsole 61-63 OL: Ron Yary 65-67 OL: Tay Brown 30-32 OL: Tony Boselli 91-94 OL: John Baker 29-31 OL: Brad Budde 76-79 OL: Anthony Muñoz 76-79 OL: Bruce Matthews 80-82 QB: Pat Haden 72-74 RB: Mike Garrett 63-65 RB: O.

Sideline announcers have been Arbogast, Jackson, Tony Femino, Tim Ryan, Petros Papadakis, Lindsey Soto, Mark Willard and Brandon Hancock. Radio station KNX AM-1070 in Los Angeles has had the most years as the team's flagship station, holding that honor from 1956 to 1968 and again from 1977 to 1994. KFI AM-640 was the flagship from 1969 to 1972, KLSX FM-97.1 held the flag in 1998, followed by XTRA AM-690 in 1999 and 2000. From 2001 to 2005, KMPC AM-1540 was the Trojans' flagship station.

The Yellow Jackets struggled with a pair of turnovers and the Commodores quarterback was responsible for five touchdowns (three passing, two rushing). Georgia Tech (7-6) was able to play well but their mistakes were just too much to overcome late in the game. Vanderbilt (7-6) was able to take advantage of the mistakes they forced and look forward to Diego Pavia next season as he sued the NCAA for another season of eligibility.

                "content": "Estimated read time: 3-4 minutes BIRMINGHAM, Ala. — Diego Pavia and Vanderbilt delivered another victory to end a surprising season. Pavia threw three touchdown passes and ran for two more scores and Vanderbilt secured its first winning season since 2013 with a 35-27 victory over Georgia Tech on Friday in the Birmingham Bowl. The Commodores (7-6) capped the year with another big game from Pavia, a New Mexico State transfer whose gritty play helped lead a huge turnaround from a 2-10 season. \"This is just a stepping stone of what we want to do here at Vanderbilt,\" Pavia said. \"We've got bigger dreams.\" Pavia accounted for three of his scores in a six-minute span starting late in the third quarter before Georgia Tech (7-6) rallied. A lightning delay with 7:17 left only pushed back the celebration of the Commodores' first bowl win since that 9-4 season 11 years ago. \"That was a tough fight and I knew it wasn't going to be easy and the weather delay added a layer that we had to overcome,\" Vandy coach Clark Lea said. Pavia, the game MVP, completed 13 of 21 passes for 160 yards and gained 84 yards on 17 rushes. He had a 7-yard touchdown pass to Quincy Skinner Jr. and a 6-yard scoring run in the fourth quarter. Afterward, he announced his plans to return to Vandy next season, with the caveat that Lea and staffers like Jerry Kill come back. Georgia Tech's Haynes King tried to bring his team back from a 35-13 deficit with a 9-yard touchdown pass to Jamal Haynes with 5:03 left and a 2-yarder to Bailey Stockton at the 1:30 mark. Both onside kick attempts failed. \"I thought the character of our team showed with the final seven minutes of the game, how they fought through adversity and continued to play until the end of the game,\" Georgia Tech coach Brent Key said. King was 25-of-33 passing for 204 yards with three touchdowns and an interception. Haynes carried 17 times for 136 yards and had five catches for 32 yards. The Commodores went ahead 21-13 on Pavia's 3-yard touchdown pass to Eli Stowers with 56 seconds left in the third quarter in a drive filled with fireworks. Key was flagged for unsportsmanlike conduct protesting a pass interference call on the drive. It came after a non-call on what he thought was a kick catch interference that had buried the Yellow Jackets at their 2. \"There was dialogue and we have to control what we can control as a football team,\" Key said. Then, Tech was flagged for defensive holding and both teams were penalized for unsportsmanlike conduct after a scuffle on Vandy's sideline. The Yellow Jackets also had a roughing the kicker call on the extra point. King then threw only his second interception of the season and CJ Taylor returned it 22 yards to the 11. Pavia was called for unsportsmanlike conduct after flipping the ball into the stands following a run but still produced a 3-yard touchdown to Eli Stowers. \"I don't know that there was a more perfect person to quarterback this team and to quarterback this program,\" Lea said. \"This is a chip on the shoulder program.\" Georgia Tech: Had eight penalties for 90 yards and two turnovers that both led to touchdowns. The Yellow Jackets had already lost two key players to the transfer portal, edge rusher Romello Heights (Texas Tech) and leading receiver Eric Singleton Jr. (Auburn) Vanderbilt: Staged a big turnaround in Lea's fourth season a year after going 0-8 in Southeastern Conference games last season. Lea retooled the staff and brought in players like Pavia, and it paid off. \"We've come a long way in 12 months,\" Lea said. Vandy's prospects for next season got brighter when a federal judge cleared the way for Pavia to return for another season, pending an NCAA appeal. Georgia Tech's King also can come back. ___ Get poll alerts and updates on the AP Top 25 throughout the season. Sign up here.

                "content": "Vanderbilt emerged victorious against Georgia Tech with a 35-27 win in the Birmingham Bowl, securing their first postseason victory in over a decade. Vanderbilt quarterback Diego Pavia showcased an exceptional performance, throwing three touchdown passes and running for an additional two scores. This win marks Vanderbilt’s first winning season since 2013. The Commodores ended the season with a record of 7-6, a notable turnaround from their previous 2-10 season, largely credited to Pavia’s leadership and skill. Pavia’s dynamic play was evident during a critical six-minute stretch in the third quarter where he contributed three scores. Despite a spirited comeback attempt by Georgia Tech, Pavia secured the victory for Vanderbilt. A lightning delay near the end of the game briefly paused the Commodores’ celebrations, but did not detract from their accomplishment. As the game MVP, Pavia completed 13 of 21 passes for 160 yards and rushed for 84 yards on 17 carries. His performance included a 7-yard touchdown pass to Quincy Skinner Jr. and a 6-yard run in the fourth quarter. Post-game, Pavia announced he would return to Vanderbilt next season, bringing optimism for the team’s future prospects. Georgia Tech’s quarterback, Haynes King, also had a significant outing with 25 completions on 33 attempts, totaling 204 yards and three touchdowns. King’s efforts to rally his team from a 35-13 deficit included a late 9-yard touchdown pass to Jamal Haynes and a 2-yarder to Bailey Stockton. However, an onside kick attempt failed, sealing their fate. During one pivotal drive, Vanderbilt moved ahead 21-13, aided by a pass interference call against Georgia Tech that incited tension on the field. The Yellow Jackets faced multiple penalties, including unsportsmanlike conduct, that ultimately hindered their comeback efforts. Additionally, Georgia Tech’s defensive lapses and turnovers were key factors in their defeat. The Commodores’ victory highlighted a successful season under head coach Clark Lea, who revamped the team just a year after a dismal Southeastern Conference campaign. The addition of players like Pavia has been instrumental in turning around Vanderbilt’s fortunes. Looking ahead, both teams have potential future challenges and opportunities. Pavia’s return to Vanderbilt is expected to strengthen the team’s competitive edge, while Georgia Tech hopes to recover from this setback and possibly regain form with quarterback Haynes King’s eligibility for another season. Vanderbilt’s triumph in the Birmingham Bowl represents a significant achievement and a hopeful outlook for their future seasons. With key players returning and a renewed team spirit, they are poised for continued success.

We have scoured our database for pangram solutions so you can uplevel to QB status (Queen Bee) without relying on Hivemind. Use our NYT Connections hint page to get help when you need it! Here are a few how-tos for using it. Say you want to search for a quick hint but don't want to know exactly which categories the 16 words go into; tap on the first flashcard labeled SEE HINT. This button will give you a short clue to help you guess the category title. We've color-coded them to help you out using the NYT Connections colors, and they're ordered from easy to most difficult. (Yellow to Purple) If you need the category title, we've got that too. Simply tap the flashcard labeled SEE GROUP, and the name of each category will come up. You might use this if you're stuck on a particular guess and unsure which category you want. If you're completely stuck, we have all of today's Connections answers. We've left this until the end, partially for suspense and also to help those who want to solve the daily puzzle themselves. Tap SEE WORD to see which of the 16 words go into which group. Again this is color-coded so you can see how difficult each group was to guess, according to The New York Times. NYT Connections is pretty similar to a game you might have played as a child called Categories. However, instead of having a certain starting letter (like in categories), you start with 16 words on your grid. Each group has four words that share a common thread. You have to place these words into one of the four categories or groups without making four mistakes. You make a mistake when you group the wrong words in a category. Every time you guess a correct group NYT Connections will tell you which color group you guessed correctly. Each of the four groups has a color associated with it, and they each mean a slightly different thing. 🟡 Yellow Simple or easy answer. 🟢 Green Fairly easy to guess. 🔵 Blue It is an unfamiliar answer or trivia. 🟣 Purple The most difficult to guess. It could be anything from slang to trivia. Once you've made all your guesses, you can share your NYT Connections solution grid with your friends. Solving the daily puzzle is fairly straightforward, but you'll have to know about categorizations before you start; being good with trivia also helps! Here’s our tips to get started. Like any good word game puzzle, there are a few skills you can brush up on before you start playing, and with time these skills will get stronger the more you play. NYT Connections' current editor Wyna Liu says the blue and green groups are medium-difficult. That's because words grouped into blue or green are often based on trivia questions like FILE EXTENSIONS or SYNONYMS FOR..... So, get that board game out or that book about useless information and start swatting up on trivial facts (because they may help you!). Before you make any guesses, assess which words could be categorized. Once you see one, get it out of the way as soon as possible. That way, you narrow down your word choices for your next guess.

Plus, the editors often include words that seem like they could have a connection to throw players off their game. Here are some tips and tricks to help you solve NYT Connections puzzles more effectively: Start with the easiest connections, these are usually the most straightforward categories. Scan for synonyms or similar items: Sometimes connections are made up of obvious relationships like synonyms, homophones, or word forms. Once you've solved an easier group, those words will be removed from the grid. The remaining words may seem less random and give clues to other groups. Narrow down tricky groups by focusing on what’s left and seeing if they share more abstract traits. Beware of misleading overlaps. Some words may seem to fit into multiple categories, like \"CRASH\" fitting into both \"car accidents\" and \"loud noises\". Try multiple ideas, but keep in mind you only have four mistakes. Focus on the less obvious words after the easiest groups are cleared. Many groups have more abstract relationships (e.g., \"things that spin\" or \"words with double meanings\"). Keep your mind open to less tangible connections. Connections may also involve wordplay, including homophones, abbreviations, or puns. For example, “SLIP” and “SNEAK” may refer to types of shoes. Think about themes like time periods, shapes, word endings, or even cultural references like games, movies, musical genres, sports, geography, science, or historical events. Try grouping words by their part of speech. For example, all verbs (e.g., run, jump, swim) might form a group. Identify plural or singular forms and group similar grammatical forms together. Some groups may be tied together by shared prefixes and suffixes like “-tion,” “-able,” or “re-.” This can help identify a connection between words that otherwise seem unrelated. Look for words that can form familiar phrases or compound words by adding the same word before or after them. For example, if you see \"JUICE,\" \"ORCHARD,\" \"CIDER,\" and \"SAUCE,\" think of \"APPLE __.\" Try both directions to find hidden connections, focusing on common categories like food (\"__ PEPPER\") or places (\"NEW __\"). This quick check often reveals less obvious groupings and helps solve the most challenging parts of the puzzle. Avoid guessing wildly. You only have four chances to make mistakes. If you start seeing connections that seem plausible, try grouping them before submitting. This is a game that rewards both observation and patience. Don’t rush through your guesses! If there’s a word that could belong with a couple others, use our tool to identify which color group it belongs to. Or if you’re completely stuck, reveal the topic of one of the groups – this will open up the grid for you. Download the App Follow Us: © 1996-2024 LoveToKnow Media, except where otherwise noted.

                "content": "The Texas Tech Red Raiders football program is a college football team that represents Texas Tech University (variously \"TTU\"). The team competes as a member of the Big 12 Conference, which is a Division I Football Bowl Subdivision (formerly Division I-A) of the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA). The program began in 1925 and has an overall winning record, including a total of 11 conference titles and one division title. On November 8, 2021, Joey McGuire was hired as the team's 17th head football coach, replacing Matt Wells, who was fired in the middle of the 2021 season.[6] Home games are played at Jones AT&T Stadium in Lubbock, Texas.[7] Texas Tech (then known as Texas Technological College) fielded its first intercollegiate football team during the 1925 season. The team was known as the \"Matadors\" from 1925 to 1936, a name suggested by the wife of E. Y. Freeland, the first football coach, to reflect the influence of the Spanish Renaissance architecture on campus. In 1932, Texas Tech joined the Border Intercollegiate Athletic Conference, also known as the Border Conference. The school's short-lived Matadors moniker was replaced officially in 1937 with \"Red Raiders\", a nickname bestowed upon them by a sportswriter impressed by their bright scarlet uniforms that remains to this day. That same year, the team won its first conference championship and was invited to the Sun Bowl. The game was played on January 1, 1938, and resulted in a 7–6 loss to the West Virginia Mountaineers. Texas Tech suffered four more bowl losses before their first postseason win in the 1952 Sun Bowl.[8] Before withdrawing from the Border Conference in 1956, the Red Raiders won eight conference championships and one co-championship, the most held by a Border Conference member. In 1956, Texas Tech was admitted to the Southwest Conference (SWC), but was ineligible for any title during a four-year probationary period. It gained full SWC membership and began official conference play in 1960. The Red Raiders won conference co-championships in 1976 and 1994. The team remained in the SWC until the conference dissolved in 1996.[9] The university was invited and became a charter member in the South Division of the Big 12 Conference. Texas Tech was the only member of the Big 12 to boast a winning record every year from the conference's formation in 1996 through end 2010.[9][A 1] In 2003, Texas Tech was the only team to ever have 5 or more players with at least 60 receptions in a single season. In 2008, the Red Raiders were one of three football teams involved in the first three way conference division tie. Texas Tech has competed as a member of three different conferences since 1925.[citation needed] The Red Raiders have won 11 conference championships, eight outright and three shared. † Co-championship The Red Raiders were previously members of the Big 12 between its inception in 1996 and the dissolution of conference divisions within the Big 12 in 2011. They won one division championship during that span, sharing it with Oklahoma and Texas in 2008. † Co-championship Texas Tech has had 17 head coaches, and three-interim head coaches. Five coaches have won conference championships with the Red Raiders: Pete Cawthon, Dell Morgan, DeWitt Weaver, Steve Sloan, and Spike Dykes. Mike Leach is the only head Texas Tech football coach to win a division title. Dykes is the all-time leader in games and years coached, while Leach is the all-time leader in overall wins. Higginbotham is, in terms of winning percentage, the worst coach the Red Raiders have had; winning only one game while losing seven, and tying two, giving him a .200 winning percentage.[21] Cawthon's .693 winning percent ranks as the highest among the coaches.[A 2] Morgan, Weaver, Dykes, and Leach have each received Coach of the Year honors from at least one organization. Morgan was named Border Conference Coach of the Year in 1949.[22] Twice—in 1951 and 1953—Weaver was named the Border Conference's Coach of the Year.[23] Dykes was named Southwest Conference Coach of the Year in 1989 and two other years.[24] Dykes was also named the first Big 12 Conference Coach of the Year in 1996. In 2008, Leach was the second Texas Tech head coach to be named Big 12 Conference Coach of the Year. The same season, Leach was also named the FieldTurf/Howie Long Coach of the Year and was awarded the Woody Hayes Trophy and George Munger Award; all three awards recognize the top collegiate coach of the season.[25] Kliff Kingsbury became the first Big 12 Conference coach to begin his career with 7 wins in 2013. Texas Tech has played in 40 postseason bowl games with an all-time record of 16 wins, 23 losses, and 1 tie.[26] The Red Raiders rank third among current Big 12 Conference programs in bowl game appearances, and also boasted the distinction of being the only program in the conference to be bowl eligible every season from its formation in 1996 through the 2010 season.[27] The 40 bowl game appearances by the Red Raiders tie the program at 20th in all-time in bowl games played and 31st in all-time bowl wins. Only 4 head coaches, E. Y. Freeland, Grady Higginbotham, Rex Dockery, and Jerry Moore, did not lead Texas Tech to a postseason bowl game.[A 3] Although both Pete Cawthon and Dell Morgan had led the program to previous bowl games, neither posted wins in their five combined appearances.[29] The Red Raiders' fans have set attendance records at 10 bowl games, including the team's first bowl game appearance in the 1938 Sun Bowl.[30] Although eight of the 10 attendance records were eventually broken, attendance records from 2 bowl game appearances, the 2004 Pacific Life Holiday Bowl and 2009 AT&T Cotton Bowl Classic, remain unbroken. The 2009 AT&T Cotton Bowl Classic's attendance record of 88,175 was the second-most attended bowl game of the 2008–09 bowl game season.[30][31] Texas Tech's first bowl game was at the conclusion of the 1937 season, only 13 years after the program was established.[32] The Red Raiders played in the 1938 Sun Bowl in El Paso, Texas, against the West Virginia Mountaineers on New Year's Day.[33] Nine of Texas Tech's 39 bowl game bids have been to the Sun Bowl,[33] the most appearances by any team to the second-oldest college football bowl game.[A 4] In the 1952 Sun Bowl, DeWitt Weaver coached the Red Raiders to their first bowl victory, defeating the Pacific Tigers 25–14 .[29] The 2011 TicketCity Bowl occurred on January 1, 2011, when the Red Raiders won, 45–38, against the Northwestern Wildcats.[36] The game was the team's 11th consecutive bowl appearance that began with the 2000 Galleryfurniture.com Bowl, in former head coach Mike Leach's first season.[29] In 10 seasons, Mike Leach's 9 bowl game appearances and five wins are the most of any of the program's head coaches.[29] The 2012 Meineke Car Care Bowl of Texas occurred on December 28, 2012, when the Red Raiders won, 34–31, against the Minnesota Golden Gophers. The last time the two teams had met was during the 2006 Insight Bowl, in which Texas Tech completed the biggest comeback in bowl history. After falling behind 38–7 with 7:47 remaining in the third quarter, rallied to score 31 unanswered points to send the game to overtime. In the 2006 game, the Gophers scored a field goal in overtime, but the Red Raiders responded with a touchdown to win. The 2013 National University Holiday Bowl occurred on December 30, 2013. This was Kliff Kingsbury's first season as head coach at Texas Tech. The Red Raiders won, 37–23, against the Arizona State Sun Devils. The last, and only other, time these two teams met was in 1999, in both teams' preseason opener despite both teams having been members of the Border Conference. In this Holiday Bowl meeting, the Red Raiders led the entire game, with the smallest lead of 7 points only lasting 11 seconds on the game clock, as Reginald Davis III returned a 90-yard kickoff for a touchdown, to answer the Sun Devils' Taylor Kelly's 44-yard touchdown run, early in the third quarter. Texas Tech's most recent bowl victory is the 2022 TaxAct Texas Bowl. On December 28, 2022, the Red Raiders, led by head coach Joey McGuire, won 42–25 versus the former No. 9 Ole Miss Rebels led by coach Lane Kiffin. In 2012, Texas Tech introduced the creation of a ring of Honor to honor former Tech players. The names are etched onto the west stadium building that faces the surface of the stadium, screen by a selection committee that makes formal recommendation to the athletic director of suitable candidates. Seven members are listed, three of whom already had their numbers retired. Many of Texas Tech's players have been recognized for their accomplishments while with the program. Seven Red Raider players, Donny Anderson, Hub Bechtol, Byron Hanspard, E. J. Holub, Dave Parks, Gabriel Rivera, and Zach Thomas, have been inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame.[37] Anderson, Holub, and Parks are the only three players at Texas Tech to have had their numbers retired.[38] Two Red Raiders, Anderson in 1965 and Graham Harrell in 2008, have been named Sporting News College Football Player of the Year, which is bestowed upon the most outstanding college football player of that season by Sporting News.[39][40] While no Texas Tech player has ever received the Heisman Trophy, seven Red Raiders have received votes by the award's selection committee.[41] Donny Anderson and Graham Harrell both finished fourth in the voting in 1965 and 2008, respectively, the highest ranking a Red Raider has received from voters.[42][43] Additionally, Michael Crabtree, Byron Hanspard, E. J. Holub, Kliff Kingsbury, and B. J. Symons were Heisman candidates, receiving enough votes to finish in the top 10.[42][43] Texas Tech football players have won several individual awards based on their positions.[44] At the end of the 1993 season, Bam Morris received the Doak Walker Award, and in 1996, Byron Hanspard became the second Red Raider to receive the award.[45] Michael Crabtree became the first two-time winner of both the Fred Biletnikoff Award and Paul Warfield Trophy in back-to-back seasons.[46][47] Four Texas Tech quarterbacks, Kliff Kingsbury, B.J. Symons, Graham Harrell, and Patrick Mahomes have been awarded the Sammy Baugh Trophy.[48] Harrell received the Johnny Unitas Golden Arm Award.[46][49] In 2003, Wes Welker won the Mosi Tatupu Award, given annually to the best special teams player.[50] In 1935, Herschel Ramsey was the first football player from Texas Tech to be named an All-American. Since then, a total of 49 players have been named to an All-American team, 30 were selected as first-team All-Americans.[51] Twelve Red Raiders have been named consensus All-Americans, players who were awarded a majority of votes at their positions by the selectors, with the most recent selection being tight end Jace Amaro in 2013.[52] Michael Crabtree was named as a consensus All-Americans in 2007 and 2008, and is the only Red Raider to receive the honor twice.[52] Ten Red Raiders have been named academic All-Americans.[53] The Red Raiders play their home games on campus at Jones AT&T Stadium. The stadium opened in 1947 as Clifford B. and Audrey Jones Stadium. In 2000, Jones Stadium was renamed, Jones SBC Stadium, in recognition of a $30 million donation from SBC Communications. Reflecting SBC Communications' rebranding as AT&T, Inc., the stadium's name was renamed in 2005 as Jones AT&T Stadium.[54] Then known as the Matadors, Texas Tech's first home field was a makeshift stadium at the South Plains Fairgrounds in Lubbock, for the 1925 season and first game of the 1926 season. In 1926, Tech Stadium, a wooden horseshoe shaped 12,000 seat stadium, was built on campus.[55][56] Twenty-years later, Jones Stadium as was completed for the 1947 season. Two years prior to the stadium's opening, Clifford B. Jones, former Texas Tech University president, established a $100,000 trust toward construction for a new football stadium. The Texas Tech Board of Directors voted to name the new facility in honor of the former president and his wife's contribution.[57] Since opening with a seating capacity of 18,000, the stadium has been continuously expanded and renovated. In 1960, the addition of a lower bowl doubled the seating capacity to 41,500, an expansion in 1972 added over 10,000 seats, during the 1990s, 2,000 seats were added, and additions in the 2000s brought a seating capacity to 60,454.[58] In 2003, a seven-story building including 47 suites, a club seat level and new press box replaced the former press box constructed in 1959.[59][60] In 2010, expansion to the east side of the stadium included a five-story addition that includes 1,000 general-admission seats, 542 club seats, 30 suites, a dining club, and pro shop. Also, ticket and athletic offices relocated to the East Side Building.[61] In 2013, the stadium was once again renovated with 368 seats being added, an upgraded video board and sound system installed, a colonnade and connecting concourse in the north endzone, and a 40-person observation deck. When Jones AT&T Stadium opened in 1947, the playing surface was originally natural grass. However, at the beginning of the 1972 season, the stadium's natural grass was replaced with AstroTurf. Jones AT&T Stadium has had a FieldTurf playing surface since 2006.[58] Jones AT&T Stadium set an attendance record of 61,836 spectators November 2, 2013, when the Red Raiders hosted the 2013 Oklahoma State Cowboys football team, and the student attendance record was set during the same season. The student section has been named as the best in the Big 12 by ESPN.[62] The stadium has played host to 14 seasons in which the Red Raiders went undefeated at home. In July 2014, the athletic department announced that all season tickets had sold out for the first time in school history with a record 38,502 tickets sold.[63] In 2014, Texas Tech announced a substantially sized stadium renovation to Jones AT&T Stadium. The total cost of the renovations totals to roughly around $185 million, and will add new things to the Jones like club seating, more suites, and a hall of fame for the heroes and champions of Texas Tech Football. The south-end zone is also getting a renovation, creating more student-section seating and a press box.[64] Texas Tech's football team was originally known as the \"Matadors\" from 1925 to 1936, a name suggested by the wife of E. Y. Freeland, the first football coach, to reflect the Spanish Renaissance architecture on campus.[65] The students followed the suggestion, and later chose scarlet and black as the school colors inspired by a matador's traditional red cape and black outfit.[66] In 1934, head coach Pete Cawthon ordered scarlet satin uniforms for the football team. He said that if the team did not attract attention by their playing, they would at least be noticed because of the flashy uniforms.[67] The football team, wearing its new outfit, defeated heavily favored Loyola Marymount in Los Angeles on October 26, 1934.[68] A Los Angeles sports writer called the Matadors a \"red raiding team\", coining the moniker Texas Tech's athletics teams use today.[67] Texas Tech's uniform consists of any combination of scarlet, black, and white. Since 2006, Under Armour has been the team's outfitter.[69] In 2013, head coach Kliff Kingsbury was given creative control over the team's uniforms and equipment design via a contract clause.[70] Starting in 2024, Adidas has taken over as the uniform partner of the Red Raiders.[71] The 2010 team was the first to wear white helmets since 1974. The white helmets were similar in design to the ones worn during the Jim Carlen era from 1970–1974 featuring a one-inch scarlet stripe in the middle bordered by two half inch black stripes. The helmets used in 2010 feature a black face mask instead of scarlet and the current version of the Double T.[72] The helmets were worn for away games against the New Mexico Lobos, Iowa State Cyclones, and Oklahoma Sooners.[73][74] The 2013 team saw a great expansion of uniform combinations and designs coinciding with Kingsbury's creative control over the uniforms.[75] In 2019, Texas Tech would wear the College Football 150 patch, a patch worn by every FBS program to recognize the invention of college football in 1869, above the Big 12 logo on all their uniforms worn that season. The Goin' Band from Raiderland, originally known as The Matador Band, is as old as Texas Tech itself. The band performed at the team's first game in October 1925, fielding between 21 and 25 members.[76][77] The following year, the band earned its name when it became the first collegiate band to travel to an away game.[77] American humorist Will Rogers once aided in financing a trip to Fort Worth, Texas, so the band could perform at a game against the TCU Horned Frogs.[78] Today, in keeping with the campus' Spanish Renaissance architecture, the uniforms of the Goin' Band are styled after the trajes of matadors, complete with cape and a flat-brimmed \"gaucho\" hat. The 450-member band, which was awarded the Sudler Trophy – an award only allowed to be awarded once – in 1999, performs at all home football games and at various other events.[79] The Masked Rider is Texas Tech University's oldest mascot, and was the first official mounted mascot in the country. The tradition began in 1936, when \"ghost riders\" were dared to circle the field prior to home football games. The Masked Rider became an official mascot in 1954, when Joe Kirk Fulton led the team onto the field at the Gator Bowl. According to reports from those present at the game, the crowd sat in stunned silence as they watched Fulton and his horse Blackie rush onto the football field, followed by the team. After a few moments, the silent crowd burst into cheers. Ed Danforth, a writer for the Atlanta Journal who witnessed the event, later wrote, \"No team in any bowl game ever made a more sensational entrance.\"[80][81] In 2000, The Masked Rider tradition was commemorated with the unveiling of a statue outside of the university's Frazier Alumni Pavilion. The sculpture, created by artist Grant Speed, is 25 percent larger than life.[82] Today the Masked Rider, with guns up, leads the team onto the field for all home games. This mascot, adorned in a distinctive gaucho hat like the ones worn by members of the marching band, is one of the most visible figures at Texas Tech. Texas Tech's other mascot, Raider Red, is a more recent creation. Beginning with the 1971 football season, the Southwest Conference forbade the inclusion of live animal mascots to away games unless the host school consented. For situations where the host school did not want to allow the Masked Rider's horse, an alternate mascot was needed. Jim Gaspard, a member of the Saddle Tramps student spirit organization, created the original design for the Raider Red costume, basing it on a character created by cartoonist Dirk West, a Texas Tech alumnus and former Lubbock mayor.[83] Though the Masked Rider's identity is public knowledge, it has always been tradition that Raider Red's student alter ego is kept secret until the end of his or her tenure.[84] The student serving as Raider Red is a member of the Saddle Tramps or High Riders. Ordered in terms of historical, active rivalries. The Texas Tech Red Raiders have played more games against the Baylor Bears than any other opponent. The rivalry began in 1929. The game has been played every year since 1956 despite the fact that Texas Tech was a member of the Border Intercollegiate Athletic Conference. In 1960, Texas Tech joined the Southwest Conference, ensuring the rivalry would continue. In 1996, the Southwest Conference dissolved, and both teams were invited, along with the Texas Longhorns and Texas A&M Aggies, with former members of the Big Eight Conference to form the Big 12 Conference. From 1947–64, Baylor won 14 of the 15 games. From 1996–2010, Texas Tech won 15 straight games. Baylor then won 5 straight meetings. Baylor leads the series, 41–39–1.[85] The winner of the annual game is presented with the Saddle Trophy, a traveling icon which bears plaques marking the score of each meeting between the rival schools. The teams have met on the gridiron in 63 games since 1926. The \"West Texas Championship - Saddle Trophy\" was first awarded, from 1961 through 1970. During this ten-year stretch, the schools split the series 5–5. The trophy was lost and the rivalry name disappeared for decades until the moniker and trophy were reintroduced in 2017. This football game is known as the West Texas Championship - Battle for the Saddle Trophy. Texas Tech leads the series 32–30–3 through the 2022 season. During the history of the Southwest Conference, Texas Tech University was one of Houston's original rivals, playing every year from 1976 to 1995 when both schools were part of the now-defunct Southwest Conference. The two teams have had some very close games over their history that came down to the wire, with 16 out of the first 34 matchups being decided by single digits and a tie game in 1987. On September 4, 2021, the two met again to play the Texas Kickoff game at NRG Stadium. After the game, several fans broke out into a fight in the stands. With the Texas Longhorns leaving the Big XII for the SEC and the Houston Cougars joining the Big XII, Texas Tech and Houston will be the only two Texas public universities in the conference. Texas Tech also played the Houston Cougars in 2022 at Jones AT&T Stadium with the final score being 33–30 in double overtime, led by Donavan Smith who later transferred to Houston. Since the 1996 season, the Chancellor's Spurs, a traveling trophy, has been exchanged between the two university system chancellors, in honor of the two universities' rivalry.[86] It is common for Texas Tech students to camp out a few days prior to home football games against the Texas Longhorns and the Oklahoma Sooners.[87] The 2008 game was one of three games that led to a three-way tie controversy in the Big 12 Conference South Division, the first three-way tie in a collegiate conference division.[A 5] The Texas Longhorns lead the all-time series 54–18 and have won 20 of 26 games since the Chancellor's Spurs were first exchanged.[88][89] After the 2022 contest where the Texas Longhorns team lost in overtime to the Red Raiders 37–34 in Lubbock,[90] it is unknown if the rivalry will continue with the Longhorns move to the SEC in 2024.[91] The Longhorns will host the Red Raiders for the final time as conference mates in 2023.[92] Texas leads the series 54–18 through the 2022 season. Texas Tech first played the Aggies in 1927 and the teams played annually from 1957 to 2011. The Texas A&M–Texas Tech football rivalry has experienced multiple altercations off the playing field between coaches, players and fans.[93] Since both teams joined the Big 12 Conference in 1996, Texas Tech has won 10, while Texas A&M has won 6, of these last 16 meetings. Texas A&M has a three-game winning streak against Texas Tech following their 2011 victory against Texas Tech in Lubbock.[94] The rivalry has been dormant since Texas A&M departed the Big 12 for the SEC in 2012. The Texas A&M Aggies lead the all-time series 37–32–1. The two schools first met in 1957, with Arkansas defeating Texas Tech by a score of 47–26 in Little Rock, Arkansas. Arkansas won the first nine games in the rivalry before Texas Tech broke through with a 21–16 victory in 1966. The Red Raiders also defeated the Razorbacks the following year, winning 31–27. After a 30–7 Texas Tech victory in 1976, Arkansas embarked on another nine-game winning streak, winning every year until 1986. Arkansas and Texas Tech played every year from 1957–1991, when the teams were members of the Southwest Conference. In 1992, Arkansas joined the Southeastern Conference, and the two schools have only played twice since: a 49–28 Arkansas victory in 2014 and a 35–24 Texas Tech victory in 2015. The teams are scheduled to meet in the 2024 Liberty Bowl, and have a regular season home-and-home series scheduled for 2030 and 2031. Arkansas leads the series 29–8 through the 2022 season. On November 1, 2023, Texas Tech's Big 12 opponents from 2024 through 2027 were revealed.[95]",

                "content": "The History of Texas Tech Red Raiders football covers 95 seasons since the team began play as the \"Matadors\" in 1925. Texas Tech played its first intercollegiate football game on October 3, 1925. The contest, against McMurry University, ended in a controversial scoreless tie during the Panhandle South Plains Fair.[1] Tech's Elson Archibald seemed to have kicked a game-winning 20-yard field goal but the referee ruled that the clock had run out before the score. It was later reported that the referee made the call to get revenge because he wanted to be the team's first head coach but the job was instead given to Ewing Y. Freeland.[2] Over his four years, Freeland coached the team, known at the time as the Matadors, to 21–10–6 before handing the reins to Grady Higginbotham. The freshman team was named the Picadors.[3] Higgenbotham coached for one year, 1929, which saw only one win and two ties to seven losses. His winning percentage of .200 is the worst of any Texas Tech football coach. Pete W. Cawthon replaced Higginbotham in 1930 and led the team for the next eleven seasons. His winning percentage of .693 has not been surpassed at Texas Tech.[4][5] For its first seven years, the program was independent, not belonging to an athletic conference. It was during Cawthon's service—in 1932—that Tech first joined a conference, the Border Intercollegiate Athletic Association, which included five other schools at the time. Several other firsts occurred during Cawthon's tenure. In 1934, the team was first referred to as the \"Red Raiders\".[6] Three years later, the 1937 squad became the first team in college football to fly to a game.[7] Later that year, they received their first postseason invite—to the 1937 Sun Bowl, where they were defeated by West Virginia, 7–6. The following year, Cawthon led the team, which is the only one in the program's history to have an undefeated regular season, to the Cotton Bowl Classic where they lost to St. Mary's, 20–13.[8] Cawthon's 1939 team set a still-unbroken NCAA record for most punts during a single game. Playing in a driving rainstorm, Texas Tech punted 39 times, while their opponent, Centenary punted 38 times. The combined punt total of 77 is also an unbroken NCAA record.[9] The next two coaches after Cawthon each held the position for a decade. Dell Morgan started in 1941, garnering a 55–49–3 record which included three bowl appearances that ended in losses. In 1951, DeWitt T. Weaver started his run. At the end of it, he held a record of 49–51–5. During his time, Weaver coached the Red Raiders to their initial bowl victories. The first came against Pacific in 1952 Sun Bowl. The next came two years later in the Gator Bowl. The 1953 Gator Bowl, a 35–13 win over Auburn, is most memorable for the first official public appearance of The Masked Rider: According to reports from those present at the 1954 Gator Bowl, the crowd sat in stunned silence as they watched [student Joe Kirk] Fulton and Blackie rush onto the football field, followed by the team. After a few moments of stunned disbelief, the silent crowd burst into cheers. Ed Danforth, a writer for the Atlanta Journal and a press box spectator later wrote, \"No team in any bowl game ever made a more sensational entrance.\"[10] Texas Tech withdrew from the Border Intercollegiate Athletic Association in 1956 and was independent for the ensuing three years. The school had tried eight times to gain admittance to the Southwest Conference and had been denied. After the 1952 rejection, many Tech fans cut up their Neiman Marcus charge cards and mailed them back to the Dallas-based retailer. Legend holds that, in response, Stanley Marcus helped sway SMU's vote in Tech's favor.[2][11] J. T. King became the coach of the Red Raiders in 1961. In his nine years, he fared no better nor worse than the man he replaced. With 44 wins, 45 losses, and three ties, his winning percentage of .495 was very close to Weaver's .490. One of the wins under King was on September 18, 1965, when the Red Raiders beat Kansas, 26–7, in the first intercollegiate football game to use instant video replay.[12] King led the team to two bowl games but they were both losses. The win column saw an upswing under coach Jim Carlen (1970–74) who finished his five years with a winning record of .644. The team's second postseason win came under Carlen when Tech beat Tennessee in the 1973 Gator Bowl. The Texas Tech University athletic department offered Steve Sloan the head football coaching position in January 1975. Though Sloan originally declined,[13][14] he took the job on January 2, 1975.[15] Texas Tech was believed to have offered him a US$30,000 per year contract, as well as $11,000 from television show income.[14] He took five of his assistant coaches with him to the Red Raiders program, including defensive coordinator Bill Parcells.[16] In his three seasons with Texas Tech, Sloan compiled a 23–12 record.[17] The only bowl tie in the program's history came the following year in the Peach Bowl, 6–6 vs. Vanderbilt. The Red Raiders were not invited to a bowl in 1975 but returned to postseason play in 1976, losing to Nebraska by three in the Bluebonnet Bowl. Tech's appearance in 1977 Tangerine Bowl, where they lost 40–17 to Florida State, was to be the last time the team saw postseason play for nearly a decade. Rex Dockery was promoted from offensive coordinator to head coach following Sloan's departure, the program would, for the second time in its history, enter into a period of two successive coaches who would return overall losing records. This led to Dockery's firing as Texas Tech's head coach.[18] In three years, Dockery coached the Red Raiders to 15–16–2.[19] Jerry Moore took the position in 1981. During his five years, he posted the second-worst record of any Texas Tech football coach, only .309. The final tally, though, only tells part of the story since many of the losses came in close games. In 1982, #1 Washington, playing at home, beat the Red Raiders by only a single touchdown. Later in the season, #2 SMU was also only able to squeak by on a single touchdown. In Moore's final season, four of Tech's seven losses were by a combined six points.[20] Upon Moore's release, the job was given to David McWilliams. In spite of not even staying an entire season, he was able to garner a record of .636 and return the team to postseason play. McWilliams departed to become the head coach at Texas. Spike Dykes took over at Tech just before the 1986 Independence Bowl where the Red Raiders were edged out, 20–17, by Ole Miss. Dykes' bowl game and the 13 complete seasons that followed set a record as the longest stay for any Texas Tech football coach. Although tallying 67 losses and a tie, his 82 wins also set a record as the most victories for a single Tech football coach. It was in 1996, during Dykes's tenure, that Texas Tech joined the Big 12 Conference. The team had the distinction of being the only one in the Big 12 to have a winning season each year since the conference was created, suffering their first losing season in 2011.[21] When Dykes departed in 2000, Texas Tech hired Mike Leach, who eventually became the winningest coach in school history. He is also the school's all-time winningest coach in postseason play, competing in a bowl game each year during his stay and garnering a 5–3 record. Behind only the Texas Longhorns, the Red Raiders are second in the Big 12 for postseason wins since 2000, having won six of their last ten bowl games. In the 2006 Insight Bowl, the team defeated the Minnesota Golden Gophers, overcoming a 31-point deficit in the third quarter to beat their opponent by three in overtime.[22] This made NCAA Division I FBS (formerly I-A) history as the largest come-from-behind bowl victory ever recorded. Each year since 2001, the American Football Coaches Association has recognized Texas Tech for having a team graduation rate of at least 70 percent. The Graduation Success Rate figures released by the NCAA in October 2008 showed that Tech graduated 79% of its players during the period from 1998 to 2001. This placed it third among the 25 teams ranked in the USA Today Coaches' Poll at the time the data was released. Only No. 23 Vanderbilt and No. 19 Wake Forest ranked higher. It also placed Texas Tech at the top of the Big 12, followed by Nebraska (78%), Baylor (78%), Colorado (75%), Kansas State (67%), Oklahoma State (62%), Missouri (59%), Texas A&M (56%), Iowa State (55%), Kansas (53%), Texas (50%), and Oklahoma (46%).[23] In July 2007, ESPN ranked all 119 FBS (formerly 1-A) football programs on performance from 1997 to 2006 and placed Texas Tech at number 32.[24] Also, with 13, the Red Raiders rank fourth nationally in consecutive winning seasons, trailing only Florida State (30), Florida (19), and Virginia Tech (14).[25] Described as a program on the rise, the Red Raiders earned 56 wins from the 2000 season through the 2006 season. During the same period, only three other Big 12 teams had more victories—Oklahoma, Texas, and Nebraska.[26] The Red Raiders, with returning quarterback Graham Harrell and redshirt freshman wide receiver Michael Crabtree opened the 2007 season in Dallas on September 3, 2007, with a televised game against SMU.[27] Texas Tech defeated the Mustangs, 49–9.[28] After a 45–49 loss to the Oklahoma State Cowboys in the fourth game of the season, defensive coordinator Lyle Setencich resigned and was replaced by Ruffin McNeill, who took the position on an interim basis.[29] The season ended with a 34–27 upset of the #3 Oklahoma Sooners, an 8–4 record, and an invitation to the Gator Bowl, where Tech defeated the Virginia Cavaliers, 31–28, on an Alex Trlica field goal with seven seconds remaining. Prior to the 2008 season, Ruffin McNeill was made the Red Raider's full-time defensive coordinator. The team remained undefeated for the first 10 games of the season and, on November 1, 2008, the Red Raiders (ranked #5 in the Coaches' Poll, #6 in the AP Poll, and #7 in the BCS Rankings defeated the #1 (in all polls) Texas Longhorns.[30] A pass from Graham Harrell to All-American wide receiver Michael Crabtree with 8 seconds remaining in the game led Tech to a 39–33 victory. This marked the 500th win in program history and the first win over a #1 ranked team. Billed as the most significant game in Texas Tech history, the game was broadcast nationwide on ABC. It was the fifth-most viewed telecast of any regular-season game in ABC history, drawing a 7.5 rating, meaning an average of 8.59 million households tuned into the contest during each measurable segment.[31] It also attracted the largest home crowd in school history.[32][33] The win also catapulted the Red Raiders to the number-two spot in both major polls, as well as the BCS rankings (and as high as number one in some computer rankings). They also became the second Red Raider team to win eleven games in the regular season. However, Tech would go on to lose two games—a conference matchup at Oklahoma and the Cotton Bowl Classic versus Ole Miss. A March 2009 announcement stated that Texas Tech and Baylor would move their next two games to the Dallas metropolitan area. The schools played November 28, 2009, at Cowboys Stadium in Arlington and will play again on October 9, 2010, at the Cotton Bowl Stadium during the State Fair of Texas.[34] There is also an option to extend the arrangement for an additional two years.[35] On December 30, 2009, Texas Tech fired head coach Mike Leach for allegedly mistreating Adam James, an injured player.[36] Leach's record at Tech stands at 84–43. Following Leach's departure, Defensive Coordinator Ruffin McNeill was named the interim head coach and led the team to a 41–31 victory over the Michigan State Spartans at the 2010 Alamo Bowl. Texas Tech finished the 2009 season ranked #21 in the AP poll, and #23 in the USA Today poll.[37] On January 9, 2010, former Auburn head football coach Tommy Tuberville was named the new head coach for the Red Raiders.[38] On January 12, 2010, Neal Brown, from Troy was selected as the new offensive coordinator.[39] On January 1, 2011, Tuberville became the second head coach in Texas Tech football history to win a bowl game in his first season—an accomplishment unmatched since DeWitt Weaver's first season in 1951–52.[40] On January 18, 2011, Texas Tech announced that Tuberville received a one-year contract extension and a $500,000 per year raise.[41] The extension and raise gave Tuberville a $2 million per-year salary through the 2015 season. At the beginning of Tuberville's first year at Texas Tech, season ticket sales increased from the previous record of 30,092 to 46,546.[42] Additionally, Tuberville is responsible for the highest-rated recruiting class in Texas Tech history, securing the 18th-ranked recruiting class in 2011 according to Rivals.com and the 14th-ranked class in the country according to Scout.com. On November 10, 2012, during a game against the Kansas Jayhawks, Tuberville became involved in a dispute with graduate assistant Kevin Oliver. Tuberville touched him and knocked off both Oliver's hat and his headset.[43] After the game, Tuberville initially explained the incident by stating that he was aiming for Oliver's shirt in an attempt to pull him off the field.[44] Two days later in his weekly press conference Tuberville apologized, citing his desire to set a better example for his two sons, one of whom was on the team.[45] Although Tuberville continued to run Leach's wide-open \"Air Raid\" spread offense, he was never really embraced by a fan base still smarting over the popular Leach's ouster.[46] After 3 seasons and a 21–17 record, 9–17 in Big 12 play,[47] Tuberville departed Tech to become head coach at Cincinnati Bearcats.[48] Kliff Kingsbury, a former Texas Tech quarterback who was serving as the offensive coordinator at Texas A&M, was hired to replace Tuberville as Tech's next head coach.[49] Kingsbury completed his first season as Head Coach in 2013 with an 8–5 record and a Holiday Bowl Victory.[50] Kingsbury became the first Big 12 Conference coach to begin his career with 7 straight wins.[51] The season saw the departure of assistant coach/ Co-Offensive Coordinator and former Texas Tech quarterback Sonny Cumbie, as he would become the next Offensive Coordinator for the Horned Frogs at TCU. Tight end Jace Amaro was also named as a Consensus All-American, and the first Red Raider to be selected as such since Michael Crabtree in 2008. Kingsbury made his head coaching debut August 30, 2013 with a 41–23 victory over the SMU Mustangs. Kingsbury chose walk-on true freshman quarterback Baker Mayfield for the starting role at the position, and Mayfield was named Big 12 Offensive Player of the Week for his performance. Mayfield is believed to be the first walk-on true freshman to start a season opener for a BCS school. Baker Mayfield was later supplanted by Davis Webb, another true freshman quarterback, due to a knee injury during the Kansas game. Following Webb's first start against Iowa State, Webb was also named Big 12 Offensive Player of the Week. Texas Tech became the only school in the Big 12 Conference to have had three different freshman quarterbacks win the award, with the first being Kingsbury himself in 1999.[52] The Red Raiders made their first Associated Press Top 25 debut in the Kingsbury era following a win over TCU on September 12, 2013.[53] It was the earliest a first year coach at Texas Tech achieved a spot in the rankings. Kingsbury also became the first coach in Texas Tech history to start the season 6–0 in their debut season after the Red Raiders defeated Iowa State on October 12, 2013. Following a victory against West Virginia on October 19, 2013, Kingsbury led the Red Raiders to a 7–0 start for only the fourth time in program history. The 10th-place ranking the team received in the BCS also marked the highest the program had been ranked since the 2008 season. With the win over West Virginia, Kingsbury became the first Big 12 coach to start his career 7–0.[51] The Texas Tech Red Raiders finished Kliff Kingsbury's first year at Texas Tech by losing the last 5 games of the season, finishing the rookie coach's first regular season at 7–5. Tight end Jace Amaro was also named as a Consensus All-American, the first Red Raider to be selected as such since Michael Crabtree in 2008.[54] Kingsbury and the Red Raiders capped off the season with a 37–23 upset over the #14 ranked Arizona State in the 2013 Holiday Bowl following an impressive performance by quarterback Davis Webb.[55] Two of Kingsbury's players would be selected in the 2014 NFL draft, Amaro and Will Smith. On August 29, 2014, Kingsbury received a $1 million raise to $3.5 million and a contract extension through 2020. The extension will see Kingsbury's salary rise by $200,000 a year to a maximum of $5.5 million in 2020.[56] The extension was given following an announcement for a $185 million athletic fundraising campaign.[57] Under Kingsbury's leadership Texas Tech sold out 2014 season tickets for the first time since Texas Tech's inaugural 1925 season.[citation needed] The 2014 team struggled with numerous injuries, finishing 4–8 on the season.[58] The Red Raiders made numerous changes heading into the 2015 season. Kingsbury added defensive coordinator David Gibbs hoping to bolster a defense that ranked amongst the worst in the country. The Red Raiders rebounded with a strong season as running back DeAndré Washington finished with 1,492 yards and 16 touchdowns and Patrick Mahomes finished with 4,653 yards and 36 passing touchdowns. Although the offense rebounded quite nicely and finished the season in the top 3 nationally, the defense finished 2nd to last only better than Kansas. Kingsbury finished his 3rd season with signature wins at Arkansas and at Texas showing promise heading into 2016. The 2015 season concluded at 7–6, 4–5 in Big 12 play good for a 5th-place finish.[59] Tech lost in the Texas Bowl to LSU. Three of Kingsbury's players were selected in the 2016 NFL draft, Le'Raven Clark, DeAndré Washington, and Jakeem Grant.[60] The Red Raiders finished 2016 5–7, 3–6 in Big 12 play.[61] The team disappointed with a conference wins against Kansas, TCU, and Baylor and finished in 8th place in the Big 12. The Red Raiders finished the 2016 season with a 55–34 victory over Baylor, snapping a 5-game losing streak they had against the Bears, that spanned from prior to Kingsbury's days in Lubbock. The 2016 team finished with the 6th best offense and the worst defense in Division I FBS.[62] Patrick Mahomes was the lone Red Raider drafted after a disappointing campaign going in the first round #10 overall to the Kansas City Chiefs. The Red Raiders entered a make or break season in 2017 for coach Kingsbury. The team responded positively finishing the 2017 season improved from the prior season finishing 6–7, 3–6 in Big 12 play.[63] The team showed signs of improvement as the offense finishing #16 in the country overcoming the loss of first round pick Patrick Mahomes. The defense also showed signs of improvement jumping up to #59 overall, a vast improvement for a defense that was the worst in the NCAA the prior season.[64] At the conclusion of the season Athletic Director Kirby Hocutt confirmed that Kingsbury would be returning for his 6th season as the Red Raiders coach.[65] However, after suffering a third straight losing season in 2018, Hocutt announced that Kingsbury would not be returning for a seventh season.[66] Texas Tech named Matt Wells as the Head Football Coach of the Red Raiders beginning with the 2019 season. Wells came to Texas Tech from Utah State, where he had been Head Football Coach for six seasons (2013-2018), compiling a 44–34 record including two bowl wins, one division championship, and two 10-win seasons. In his inaugural game at the helm of the Red Raiders program on August 31, 2019, Wells led Texas Tech to a 45–10 victory over Montana State in the season opener at Jones AT&T Stadium.",

                "content": "The Syracuse Orange football team represents Syracuse University in the sport of American football. The Orange compete in the Football Bowl Subdivision (FBS) of the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) as members of the Atlantic Coast Conference (ACC). Syracuse is the only Division I FBS school in New York to compete in one of the Power Four conferences. The Orange play their home games in the JMA Wireless Dome, referred to as the JMA Dome on the university's campus in Syracuse, New York.[5] The stadium is also known as \"The Loud House.\" Formed in 1889, the program has amassed over 740 wins and has achieved one consensus national championship in 1959, defeating the Texas Longhorns in that season's Cotton Bowl. Syracuse has had 2 undefeated seasons, 5 conference championships since 1991, and has produced a Heisman Trophy winner, over 60 first team All-Americans, 18 Academic All-Americans and over 240 NFL players.[6] Syracuse has had 18 members inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame, 2nd-most in the ACC, including former players Ernie Davis, Tim Green, Don McPherson, Art Monk and former coaches Vic Hanson, Ben Schwartzwalder, and Dick MacPherson.[7] The Orange boast 8 inductees in the Pro Football Hall Of Fame, tied for the 4th-most of any school, including Jim Brown, Marvin Harrison, Larry Csonka, and Floyd Little.[8] The Orange have 28 bowl appearances, 10 of which are among the New Year's Six Bowls. Syracuse has finished in the Final Top 25 rankings 21 times in the national polls, and finished in either the AP or Coaches Polls a combined 35 times since 1952. Syracuse has appeared in over 200 AP Polls including 7 weeks at AP number one. Syracuse played its first football game on November 23, 1889,[9][10] and achieved its first success in the 1890s and 1900s. With the construction of \"state-of-the-art\" Archbold Stadium in 1907, Syracuse rose to national prominence under College Football Hall of Fame coach Frank \"Buck\" O'Neill. The 1915 squad garnered a Rose Bowl invitation that the school declined, having already played on the West Coast that season. In 1918, John Barsha (born Abraham Barshofsky) was co‐captain of the 1918 Walter Camp All‐America football team.[11] The 1920s had continued success with teams featuring two-time All American Doc Alexander and star end Vic Hanson. Vic Hanson was an American football player and coach, basketball player, and baseball player. A three-sport college athlete, he played football, basketball, and baseball at Syracuse in the 1920s, serving as team captain in all three sports. The Watertown, New York native was named a Basketball All-American three times—in 1925, 1926, and 1927—was named the Helms Foundation College Basketball Player of the Year and was a consensus selection to both 1925 and 1926 College Football All-America Teams. Hanson is one of only two individuals who are members (Amos Alonzo Stagg being the other) of both the Basketball Hall of Fame and the College Football Hall of Fame and the only one inducted into the Basketball Hall of Fame, the College Basketball Hall of Fame and the College Football Hall of Fame. He later coached the team from 1930 to 1936. In the 1930s, Syracuse and nearby Cornell University were among the first collegiate football teams to include African-American players as starting backfield players. Wilmeth Sidat-Singh was an African-American basketball star player for DeWitt Clinton High School. He received an offer of a basketball scholarship from Syracuse University and enrolled in 1935. While playing an intramural football game, an assistant football coach noticed his talent and asked him to join the football team. Sidat-Singh starred for Syracuse, playing a position equivalent to modern-day quarterback. In that era, when games were played in Southern segregation states, African-American players from Northern schools were banned from the field. Because of his light complexion and name, Sidat-Singh was sometimes assumed to be a \"Hindu\" (as people from India were often called by Americans during this time). However. shortly before a game against Maryland, a black sportswriter, Sam Lacy wrote an article in the Baltimore Afro-American, revealing Sidat-Singh's true racial identity. Wilmeth Sidat-Singh was held out of the game and Syracuse lost that game 0–13. Olympic track athlete Marty Glickman, who played football for Syracuse, believed athletic director Lew Andreas was a bigot who occasionally used a disparaging term for Blacks; the 18-year-old Glickman thought Andreas should have stood up for Sidat-Singh (Glickman also faulted himself for not standing up for Sidat-Singh).[12] In a rematch the following year at Syracuse, Sidat-Singh led the Orange to a lopsided victory (53–0) over Maryland. In 2005, Syracuse University honored Wilmeth Sidat-Singh by retiring his basketball jersey number.[13] On Saturday, Nov. 9, 2013, the University of Maryland publicly apologized to surviving relatives from the Webb family at a ceremony during a football game with Syracuse University.[14] Ossie Solem coached at Syracuse from 1937 to 1945. During his tenure at Syracuse, he tutored a young assistant coach named Bud Wilkinson, who went on to lead the Oklahoma Sooners to win three national championships. The late 1930s and 1940s had a decline in fortunes that began to reverse when Ben Schwartzwalder took over as head coach in 1949.[15] Syracuse made its first bowl appearance in the 1953 Orange Bowl,[16] followed by appearances in the 1957 Cotton Bowl[17] and the 1959 Orange Bowl.[18] Jim Brown (a high school standout from Manhasset, New York),[19][20] considered to be one of the greatest running backs of all time, as well as one of the greatest players in NFL history,[21] was a consensus first-team All-American in 1956, finished fifth in the Heisman Trophy voting and set school records for highest season rush average (6.2) and most rushing touchdowns in a single game (6). In the Cotton Bowl, Brown rushed for 132 yards, scored three touchdowns, and kicked three extra points, but a blocked extra point after Syracuse's third touchdown was the difference as TCU won 28–27.[22] In 1959, Syracuse earned its first consensus national championship, finishing No. 1 in both the AP and Coaches' Polls, following an undefeated season (11–0) and Cotton Bowl Classic victory over No. 4 Texas. The team featured sophomore running back Ernie Davis of Elmira, New York, who went on to become the first African American to win the Heisman Trophy in 1961,[23] and All-American tackle Ron Luciano, who eventually become a prominent Major League Baseball umpire. Davis was slated to play for the Cleveland Browns in the same backfield as Jim Brown, but died of leukemia before being able to play professionally. Syracuse remained competitive through the 1960s with a series of All-American running backs, including Floyd Little and Larry Csonka (both inductees in the Pro Football Hall of Fame).[24][25] Schwartzwalder produced 22 straight years of non-losing football, took the Orange to seven bowls, won the Lambert-Meadowlands Trophy (to recognize the Eastern champion in Division I FBS) four times: 1952, 1956, 1959, 1966; and won the national championship in 1959. He developed some of the most impressive running backs the game has ever seen - Jim Brown, Ernie Davis, Jim Nance, Floyd Little and Larry Csonka. Orange teams outrushed opponents by more than 22,000 yards under Schwartzwalder. He retired as Syracuse's head coach after the 1973 season, which was Syracuse's third consecutive losing season.[26] Schwartzwalder left Syracuse with a 153–91–3 record.[27] In 1969, a group of nine African American student-athletes boycotted Syracuse University's football program to demand change and promote racial equality. Popularized erroneously in 1970 by the media as the “Syracuse 8,” the nine students behind the boycott were Gregory Allen, Richard Bulls, Dana Harrell, John Godbolt, John Lobon, Clarence “Bucky” McGill, A. Alif Muhammad (then known as Al Newton), Duane Walker, and Ron Womack.[28] The student athletes drafted a list of four demands, three of which were advocating for the betterment for all student athletes at the university, were access to the same academic tutoring as their white teammates; better medical care for all team members; starting assignments based on merit; and racially integrating the coaching staff, which had been all white since 1898.[29] Michigan assistant coach Frank Maloney was hired as Schwartzwalder's replacement.[30] Maloney's tenure at Syracuse was marked by inconsistency.[31] The fan base turned on him as the Orange failed to achieve the national status they had enjoyed under Schwartzwalder. Maloney's program was also limited by archaic facilities.[32] Archbold Stadium, Syracuse's home field since 1907, was in need of replacement.[32] Nonetheless, Maloney did recruit a number of future NFL stars such as Joe Morris and Pro Football Hall of Fame member Art Monk.[33] Maloney was the subject of criticism, not only from the fans and alumni, but also from the 1959 national championship team, members of which started a campaign calling for his ouster.[34] Ironically enough, this call from program alumni came during the 1979 season, Maloney's best at Syracuse, when the Orangemen qualified for the Independence Bowl, beating McNeese State. After coaching the Orangemen for seven seasons and presiding over the opening of a new stadium, the Carrier Dome (renamed in 2022 the JMA Wireless Dome), in 1980, Maloney resigned.[35] Dick MacPherson was hired as the head coach in 1981[36] and after several mediocre seasons, fans wanted MacPherson fired, coining the phrase, \"Sack Mac\".[37] However, the fans' opinion of Coach MacPherson changed when the program returned suddenly to national prominence in 1987 with an undefeated 11–0 regular season record.[38] The team featured Maxwell Award-winning quarterback Don McPherson and fullback Daryl Johnston.[39] The team missed an opportunity to play for the NCAA Division I-A national football championship, because both Oklahoma and Miami also finished undefeated that year and finished higher in the polls.[40] Instead, the team faced Southeastern Conference champion Auburn University in the Sugar Bowl.[41] The game ended in a 16–16 tie when Auburn kicked a late field goal rather than trying for a game-winning touchdown.[42] MacPherson left Syracuse after the 1990 season to accept the position of head coach for the NFL's New England Patriots.[43] McPherson is credited with building a strong recruiting pipeline in the northeast area.[44] Syracuse continued to experience success under MacPherson's successor, Paul Pasqualoni, previously the team's linebackers coach,[45] appearing in 11 bowl games (including three major bowls) and winning 9.[46] The team also captured or shared three Big East football championships during this period. Prominent players of the period included Donovan McNabb, Marvin Harrison, Dwight Freeney, Keith Bulluck, Rob Moore, Donovin Darius, Qadry Ismail, Kevin Johnson, Rob Konrad, Tebucky Jones, and Marvin Graves.[47][48] Rivalries shifted in the early 1990s as Penn State ended its series with Syracuse and joined the Big Ten.[49] Syracuse, meanwhile, joined the newly formed Big East football conference with traditional rival West Virginia University, and national power Miami.[50] In 2004, Miami and Virginia Tech left the Big East to join the Atlantic Coast Conference,[51] followed by Boston College in 2005,[52] threatening the stature of the Big East. Syracuse was originally invited to leave the Big East and join the ACC, but under pressure from the Governor of Virginia, the ACC decided to invite Virginia Tech to join the conference, instead.[53] Thus, Syracuse remained in the Big East. Syracuse's streak of winning seasons ended in 2002 when they went 4–8.[54] This was followed by consecutive 6–6 seasons.[55][56] Although they won a share of the Big East title in 2004 and competed in the Champs Sports Bowl,[57] the teams from 2002 to 2004 were considered mediocre by Syracuse standards. This prompted new athletic director Dr. Daryl Gross to fire Pasqualoni after 14 years at the helm.[58] In 2005, the university hired Greg Robinson, defensive coordinator for Texas, as head coach.[59] Robinson installed a new West Coast offense scheme, replacing the option run style of offense previously run by Pasqualoni, and new defensive schemes.[60] The 2005 season started on a high note as Syracuse nearly upset eventual Big East and Sugar Bowl champion West Virginia, forcing five turnovers in the 15–7 loss.[61] They followed it up with a 31–0 thrashing of Buffalo[62] and another near-upset, this time against #25 Virginia, falling 27–24 on a last-second field goal.[63] The squad lost its final eight games of the season. Syracuse finished the year 1–10, the worst on-field season in school history and won only 10 games with Robinson running the program.[64] Robinson's Orange improved to 4–8 in 2006[65] but fell to 2–10 in 2007.[66] The 2007 season included a road upset of number-18 Louisville.[67] When the struggles continued in 2008, Syracuse fired Robinson[68] following a 3–9 season[69] where the high point was a 24–23 upset of Notre Dame.[70] At the other end of the spectrum, in a game that exemplified the Robinson era, the Orange lost 55–13 to Penn State.[71] Robinson's .213 winning percentage on the field is the worst for a non-interim coach in school history. He has been criticized for abandoning the traditional northeast recruiting pipeline.[44] In 2015, Syracuse vacated all of its wins from 2005 and 2006 due to ineligible players, dropping Robinson's \"official\" winning percentage to .119. On December 12, 2008, Doug Marrone, a Bronx, New York native and former Orange player, was announced as the replacement for Robinson as head coach.[72][73][74] Marrone was the first Syracuse alumnus to serve as head football coach since Reaves H. Baysinger in 1948.[75] Reportedly, alumni such as Tim Green and Floyd Little wanted Marrone from the moment the previous coach Greg Robinson was fired, and when interviewed by Green, Marrone was found to have kept a folder of current high-school players in the Syracuse area to get a head start in recruiting.[76][77][78] Improvement throughout the program was noticed immediately, as the Orange, despite only a marginal improvement in their win–loss record, going 4–8 under Marrone for his first year,[79] played many much more closely, including a 28–7 loss at number-seven Penn State.[80] In 2010, the Orange finished the regular season with a winning record for the first time since the 2001 season at 7–5, including road wins against number-19 West Virginia and two-time defending conference champion Cincinnati.[81] The team earned its first bowl bid since 2004 and along with second-ranked Oregon and 10th-ranked Boise State, the five road wins were the best in 2010 of all FBS teams.[82] December 30, 2010, Syracuse defeated Kansas State in the inaugural Pinstripe Bowl at Yankee Stadium. The game was televised live on ESPN.[83] Two years later, the Orange defeated West Virginia in the 2012 Pinstripe Bowl.[84] On January 7, 2013, Marrone left Syracuse, accepting the head-coaching position of the NFL's Buffalo Bills.[85] The day after Marrone's departure, Syracuse promoted defensive coordinator Scott Shafer to head coach.[86] Coach Shafer's first season was marked by inconsistency from the team in spite of the bowl eligibility for the third time in four years. Syracuse capped off the season with a 21–17 victory over Minnesota in the 2013 Texas Bowl to finish the year 7–6.[87][88] The first season for the Orange in the ACC was 2013.[89] The 2014 season brought about a noticeable drop in quality. Syracuse finished the season a disappointing 3–9.[90] In 2015, after they started the season 3–0, the Orange collapsed, losing 8 of their final 9 games to finish the season 4–8,[91] and on November 23, 2015, it was announced that Shafer would be fired after the last game of the 2015 campaign.[92] After an extensive coaching search, Syracuse announced the hiring of Bowling Green head coach Dino Babers as the new Orange head football coach.[93] Babers was the first African-American head coach in school history.[94] Babers brought with him an exciting, up-tempo offense he employed both as a head coach and as an assistant coach.[95] In Babers' first season in charge, Syracuse started the year at 4–4, with the highlight of the first eight games being a 31–17 upset of number-17 Virginia Tech at home.[96] Syracuse kept the momentum from the upset going and beat rival Boston College on the road, 28–20.[97] However, they were blown out 54–0 in their next game by No. 3 Clemson.[98] In the final game of the season, Syracuse lost to ACC rival Pittsburgh by a score of 76–61.[99] The game was the highest scoring in FBS history with a combined score of 137.[100] Syracuse finished 4–8 for the second consecutive year.[101] In 2017, the Orange started 4–3, including a win over No. 2 Clemson,[102] but they lost their final five games to finish 4–8 for the third straight year.[103] In 2018, Syracuse earned its first bowl bid under Babers, going 10–3 with a bowl victory over West Virginia.[104] In 2022, Syracuse started 6–0, earning a No. 14 ranking in the AP and Coaches' Polls. However, the team squandered a 21–10 halftime lead to Clemson, falling 27–21. The Orange lost their next four games before finishing the season with a win at Boston College to end the year 7–5.[105] Syracuse earned a trip to the Pinstripe Bowl where it lost to Minnesota, 28–20.[106] After a 4–0 start to the 2023 season, Syracuse lost 6 of the next 7 games, leading to Babers' firing with one game remaining in the 2023 season.[107] On November 28, 2023, Brown was named the 31st head coach in program history.[108] His deep recruiting ties in South Jersey, one of Syracuse's primary recruiting grounds, were cited as a major reason for his hiring.[109] Less than a month later, Fran Brown signed Syracuse's best recruiting class in the \"modern era\" according to the Syracuse Post-Standard.[110] The class included several high-profile transfers, including five-star recruit Kyle McCord, the starting quarterback from the Ohio State Buckeyes.[111] The Brown era begun with a 38-22 win over Ohio, and he led the Orange to their first 9 win season since 2018. It included ranked wins over Georgia Tech, UNLV, and then beating then CFP ranked Miami.[112][113][114][115] McCord broke several of Syracuse's single-season passing records, including the single-season passing record against UConn, as well as leading FBS in passing yards in 2024.[116] Syracuse entered the AP, Coaches, and CFP rankings after the Miami game. On 27 December, Syracuse traveled to San Diego to play in the Holiday Bowl against Washington State.[117]. They won 52-35. Syracuse has been independent and affiliated with two conferences.[118] Syracuse finished their undefeated 1959 season with a 23–14 victory over the No. 4 Texas Longhorns in the Cotton Bowl, and were named the national champions by all major selectors, including the major wire-service: AP and Coaches' Poll.[119] For much of its history, Syracuse played as an independent, as did the majority of what are now labeled as Division I FBS football-playing schools located in the Northeast and Mid-Atlantic regions. During this time, Eastern Championships were named by independent third-party selectors and awarded of various trophies. The process of picking an Eastern Champion eventually came to be symbolized by the Lambert-Meadowlands Trophy awarded by the New Jersey Sports and Exposition Authority beginning in 1936. As a result, the Lambert-Meadowlands Trophy, voted on by a panel of sports writers in New York, became the de facto conference championship for those schools.[120] In 1991, the majority of football independents in the East (including Syracuse) aligned themselves together in the Big East Football Conference. The Big East first crowned an official champion in 1993. In 2013, Syracuse joined the Atlantic Coast Conference (ACC). † Co-champions There have been 31 head coaches at Syracuse.[121] Fran Brown became the most recent head coach in 2024. 1913–1915 1917–1919 1944–1945 The No. 44 at Syracuse is one of the most legendary numbers ever associated with a college football program. Like tailbacks at USC or quarterbacks at Purdue, the running back position at Syracuse has a rich tradition of greatness. Much of that greatness has revolved around one jersey number — 44. Syracuse University officially retired #44 on Saturday, November 12, 2005. Since 1954, 11 players have worn the number and three of the most famous #44s — Jim Brown, Ernie Davis, and Floyd Little — are in the College Football Hall of Fame. Jim Brown played at SU from 1954 to 1956. Brown earned numerous honors as Orange playing college football, basketball, track and field and lacrosse. In his senior year in 1956 Brown was a consensus first-team All-American and led the team to a Cotton Bowl. He finished fifth in the Heisman Trophy voting and set school records for highest season rush average (6.2), most rushing touchdowns in a single game (6), and an NCAA single-game record of 43 points.[122] After his successful college career, Brown went on to become one of the greatest football players of all time.[123] Jim Brown was an All Pro and a Pro Bowl invitee every season he was in the league, was recognized as the AP NFL Most Valuable Player three times, and won an NFL championship with the Browns in 1964. He led the league in rushing yards in eight out of his nine seasons, and by the time he retired, he had shattered most major rushing records. Brown's memorable professional career led to his induction into the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 1971. His football accomplishments at Syracuse garnered him a berth in the College Football Hall of Fame. Jim Brown also earned a spot in the Lacrosse Hall of Fame, giving him a rare triple crown of sorts. Today, he is recognized as the greatest football player ever[124] by most professional football writers.[125] But Brown's legacy goes beyond sports. Brown was one of the NFL's earliest social issues activists along with a group of top African American athletes from different sporting disciplines such as Bill Russell, Muhammad Ali and Kareem Abdul Jabbar. In the 1960s, Brown co-founded the Black Economic Union to support the growth of black-owned businesses. In the 1980s he also started the Amer-I-Can program which mentors youth in both inner cities and prisons. Ernie Davis, the only Orange player to win the Heisman Trophy, played at Syracuse from 1959 to 1961, and went on to national fame in each of those three seasons, winning first-team All-American honors twice. Davis led the 1959 Syracuse team to a national championship, capping an 11–0 season with a 23–14 win over the Texas Longhorns in the 1960 Cotton Bowl Classic, where Davis was named Most Valuable Player. That same season, Elmira Star-Gazette sports writer Al Mallette coined the nickname for Davis, the \"Elmira Express\". During his Cotton Bowl visit to host city Dallas, Texas, Ernie and his black teammates found discrimination prevalent in the American South. Author Jocelyn Selim writes that at the banquet following the 1960 game, Davis was told he could only accept his award and then would be required to leave the segregated facility when the doors were opened to the public for a dance. Despite the racial issues, Davis became the first black athlete to be awarded the Heisman Trophy (the highest individual honor in collegiate football) and he also won the Walter Camp Memorial Trophy following his 1961 season at Syracuse University. President John F. Kennedy had followed Davis' career and requested to meet him while he was in New York to receive the trophy. Later in 1963, when Elmira chose February 3 to celebrate Davis' achievements, Kennedy sent a telegram, reading: Seldom has an athlete been more deserving of such a tribute. Your high standards of performance on the field and off the field, reflect the finest qualities of competition, sportsmanship and citizenship. The nation has bestowed upon you its highest awards for your athletic achievements. It's a privilege for me to address you tonight as an outstanding American, and as a worthy example of our youth. I salute you.[126] Davis was the number-one pick in the 1962 NFL draft. He was bound to go to the Cleveland Browns where he would be teammates with Jim Brown. Davis signed a three-year contract with the Browns in late December 1961. It was the most lucrative contract for an NFL rookie up to that time.[127] However, Davis' dream of pairing with Jim Brown took a tragic turn when Davis was diagnosed with leukemia. The disease was incurable and Davis died at age 23 at Cleveland Lakeside Hospital on May 18, 1963.[128] Following his death, the Browns retired his number 45 jersey. A motion picture biography, The Express: The Ernie Davis Story, directed by Gary Fleder and based on the non-fiction book The Elmira Express: the Story of Ernie Davis by Robert C. Gallagher, began production in April 2007[129] and was released on October 10, 2008. His commemorative statue now stands in front of the school named in his honor, Ernie Davis Academy. Another statue of Davis stands on the campus of Syracuse University, near the steps of Hendricks Chapel and the Shaw Quad where pre-game pep rallies are held. He was inducted to the College Football Hall of Fame in the fall of 1979. Floyd Little played for Syracuse from 1964 to 1966. He is the only three-time All-American running back to compete for the Syracuse University Orangemen. He finished 5th in Heisman Trophy voting in both 1965 and 1966. Floyd was the leading force behind teams that earned tickets to the Sugar Bowl in 1964 and the Gator Bowl in 1966 (teaming with another great tailback Larry Csonka in the latter). In addition to breaking the running records of Brown and Davis, Little became the greatest kick returner in Orange history. He led the country in all-purpose yardage, averaging 199 yards per game in 1965.[130] Floyd Little was the first ever first-round draft pick to sign with the American Football League's Denver Broncos. During his rookie year, Little led the NFL in punt returns with a 16.9-yard average. He led the NFL in combined yards in 1967 and 1968 and was the first ever Bronco to win a rushing title, leading the AFC in rushing in 1970 and the following year he became the first Bronco to eclipse 1,000 yards, gaining 1,133 to lead the NFL.[131] Little was Denver Broncos team captain all 9 seasons, including his rookie season and he was known as \"The Franchise\". Floyd Little retired as the NFL's 7th all-time leading rusher with 6,323 yards. He later was inducted both in the College and Pro Football Hall of Fame. To honor his achievements Denver Broncos retired his #44 jersey. Statues of Davis (second on campus), Brown and Little are at Syracuse University's Plaza 44, commemorating the number the running backs wore while playing football. No. 44 has become so associated with Syracuse that all university phone numbers begin with 44 and the university's ZIP code, 13244, was requested by university officials to remember those who wore 44 for the Orange. “Number 44 not only has come to represent greatness on the football field, it has become a part of the university's and the community's identity”.[130] The Syracuse University Marching Band (SUMB), also known as the \"Pride of the Orange\", is the collegiate marching band of Syracuse University. The SUMB performs at all home football games throughout the season, and also makes several local parades and other performances throughout the year. It is one of the largest student organizations at Syracuse University, consisting of approximately 200 members. Founded in 1901, it is one of the oldest collegiate bands in the nation. Over the course of almost 120 years, the \"Pride of the Orange\" has played a huge role in university history and has been a constant source of pride for the university.[132] The rivalry with fellow ACC conference member Pittsburgh began in 1916, and has been played annually since 1955. The Panthers and Orange were both Eastern football independents for most of their history but have shared the same football conference since 1991 when the Big East Football Conference was formed from Eastern football independents. Pitt is tied as the most played opponent for Syracuse and Syracuse is the third most played opponent for Pitt. Sharing membership in the Atlantic Coast Conference (ACC) since 2013, the Panthers and Orange have played a total of 74 times. Pittsburgh leads the series 44–32–3 through the 2018 season.[135] Pittsburgh and Syracuse will play every season as part of an ACC scheduling agreement. Syracuse and West Virginia have played 60 times. Often, these games have had a bearing on which collegiate program was the best in the East. In much of the '80s and '90s, Syracuse and West Virginia made for one of the Big East's best head-to-head match-ups on a yearly basis. West Virginia then left the Big East for the Big 12 Conference in 2012.[136] The Ben Schwartzwalder Trophy goes to the winner of the West Virginia and Syracuse football game. The trophy was introduced in 1993 and is named after former WVU football player and Syracuse head coach Ben Schwartzwalder, who had died in March of that year.[137] The trophy weighs 55 pounds and was sculpted by Syracuse player Jimmy Ridlon. West Virginia won the first trophy game at Syracuse and has gone on to win 11.[138] Syracuse has won the trophy eight times and currently holds it.[139] Syracuse leads the series 34–27 with the last two games played in 2012 Pinstripe Bowl and 2018 Camping World Bowl.[140] Syracuse is currently on the 4 game winning streak. There are no future matchups scheduled. The \"heyday\" of the Syracuse Penn State rivalry took place during the 1950s and 1960s when the teams battled back and forth in a competitive and often controversial string of contests. Syracuse football was led by legendary coach Ben Schwartzwalder, and Penn State by Rip Engle from 1950 to 1966 and Joe Paterno from 1967 to 2011. From 1950 to 1970, Syracuse won 11 to Penn State's 10 games. Unfortunately conference realignment and scheduling disagreements have dampened the intensity of the rivalry between the teams in recent years. The teams first met on October 28, 1922, at the New York Polo Grounds battling to a scoreless[citation needed] tie kick-starting an East coast rivalry that has seen 71 total match-ups with the teams meeting almost every season from 1922 to 1990. The only exception was during the 1943 season, when Syracuse did not field team in light of World War II.[citation needed] From 1922 to 1940 Syracuse held a 10–4–4 advantage over the Nittany Lions, before Penn State would win 8 straight from 1941 to 1949. In the 1947 match-up, Penn State prevailed 40–0 in State College behind a staunch defense that held the Orange to (-47) total yards which is an NCAA record. (-107 rushing, 60 passing, in 49 plays)[141] From 1956 to 1966 the Orange regained command winning 8 out of 11. Since 1967, the Nittany Lions have dominated winning 24 of 27 match-ups including 16 straight from 1971 to 1986. In 1987, Dick MacPherson coached Syracuse to a 48–21 victory over the Nittany Lions in the JMA Wireless Dome. Syracuse won again the following year at Penn State, but lost the final two games before the suspension of the series in 1991.[142] Penn State leads the all-time series 43–23–5, and have won 5 straight. The most recent match-up was played at Metlife Stadium in East Rutherford, NJ; a 23–17 win for Penn State.[143] The teams are scheduled to play in State College in 2027 and in Syracuse in 2028.[144] For many years, Syracuse's main football rivals were the nearby Colgate Red Raiders. Colgate and Syracuse first played each other in football in 1891, with Colgate recording a 22–16 victory. The Red Raiders would go on the win 12 of the first 16 games in the series. Colgate's early dominance in the series quickly gave rise to the legend of the Hoodoo (a play on a corruption of the word Voodoo). The schools have played each other a total of 67 times, with the series tied at 31–31–5. By the late 1950s, Syracuse had established itself as a major power in Eastern college football, and the games became increasingly one-sided. Following the 1961 contest, Colgate terminated the series, in order to focus on playing smaller, peer institutions. Following the NCAA's I-A/I-AA split in 1978, the rivalry was intermittently renewed in the 1980s, with Syracuse comfortably winning all three games played in the decade. In 2010, the rivalry was renewed again after a 23-year absence, with Syracuse recording a 42–7 victory.[145][146] The series resumed again in 2016, when Syracuse hosted Colgate in a game played in the Carrier Dome,[147] which Syracuse won 33–7. Syracuse has won all of the meetings since then, and are next scheduled to play in 2025. Syracuse University adopted orange color as its official color in 1890. The color was selected after a vote by students, alumni, faculty, and trustees, who noted it was a strong, bright color not claimed by any other school. Syracuse University was the first school to adopt only one primary color. It was chosen to \"represent the golden apples of Hesperia, as well as the story of the sunrise and hope for a golden future.\"[148] The first uniforms of the Orange were classic white sweaters and dark pants. Syracuse football wore these from 1889 to 1919. Orange color was first worn in the 1920s. A blue number was stitched on the back of orange jerseys, and the dark pants were replaced with Khaki moleskin. Blue began to be generally recognized as a secondary color of Syracuse.[149] During its glory years beginning with the first bowl game appearance in 1952, Syracuse football used to wear white jerseys and orange pants at home at Archbold stadium. From 1952 to 1966, coach Ben Schwartzwalder, with his military background and always looking for an edge, thought white jerseys made his players look bigger, faster and stronger. During his first three seasons (1949–51) and in 1958, he also experimented with an all orange look to camouflage the football.[150] Blue jerseys were rarely seen during that era as Syracuse wore them only three times. The switch to blue and orange combination at home came in 1967. Since then, it was blue jersey and orange pants at home until the first three Frank Maloney seasons (1974–76) when the newly assigned coach wanted to move away from the Schwartzwalder era with orange jerseys and unusually designed white helmets, before bringing blue jerseys and orange helmets back for essentially the next 28 seasons. Syracuse started wearing white jerseys and orange jerseys (and pants) at home again in the 2000s. Three colors (orange, white and blue) have been used in several combinations throughout the years. Since the establishment of the team in 1890, Syracuse has appeared in 29 bowl games. Included in these games are 10 combined appearances in the \"New Year's Six\" bowl games (the Rose, Sugar, Cotton, Orange, Fiesta and Peach) and 1 Bowl Championship Series (BCS) game appearances. The New Year's Six represent six of the ten oldest bowl games played at the FBS level (missing the Sun, Gator, Citrus and Liberty bowls), continuing their original history of putting the very best teams in the country against each other. Syracuse's all-time bowl record is 17 wins, 11 losses and 1 tie (17–11–1). Syracuse has finished in the Final Top 25 rankings 21 times in the national polls, and finished in either the AP or Coaches Polls a combined 35 times since 1952. Syracuse has appeared in over 200 AP Polls including 7 weeks at AP No.1.[151] † AP Poll began selecting the nation's Top 20 teams in 1936. Only the Top 10 teams were recognized from 1962 to 1967. The AP Poll expanded back to the Top 20 teams in 1968. In 1989, it began recognizing the Top 25 teams. ‡ UPI/Coaches Poll began selecting its Top 20 teams on a weekly basis in 1950 before expanding to the nations's Top 25 teams in 1990. ^ College Football Playoff (CFP) committee began selecting the Top 25 teams in 2014. Syracuse University retired eight jersey numbers1 and hung them in the JMA Wireless Dome rafters.[152][153] 1Syracuse doesn't retire numbers, instead retiring individual players' jerseys by hanging their number in the JMA Dome.[152] 2 The complete list of players who wore number 44 (by chronological order): Gifford Zimmerman, Charles Roberts, Clarence Taylor, Don Baldwin, Richard Fishel, Henry Merz, Hamilton Watt, Francis Mullins, Stanley Stanislay, Benjamin DeYoung, Francis Mazejko, Richard Ransom, J. O'Brien, Robert Eberling, Jim Brown, Thomas Stephens, Ernie Davis, William Schoonover, Floyd Little, Richard Panczyszyn, Mandel Robinson, Glenn Moore, Michael Owens, Terry Richardson, and Rob Konrad. Jim Brown is named as the greatest player in college football history. ESPN unveiled college football's 150 greatest players of the first 150 years of history of college football. ESPN's top 150 players were determined by a blue-ribbon panel of current and former writers, broadcasters, administrators, sports information directors and ESPN personalities.[154][155] † Finalist Syracuse football players have earned All-America honors over 130 times since 1908. Among those selections, 20 have achieved Consensus All-American status. Of those consensus All-Americans, 9 are unanimous selections.

The best players of the decade and the team, which includes 29 players, was selected by Big East media members to celebrate the 10th year of Big East football.[156] † co-winner Syracuse football players in All-ACC teams since 2013. Syracuse is one of the most represented schools in the National Football Foundation's College Hall of Fame. The Orange have 18 enshrinees, second-most among ACC programs behind Pittsburgh (25). Syracuse has had 11 players and 7 former coaches inducted into the Hall of Fame.[157] Syracuse's legacy in the Pro Football Hall of Fame ranks among the finest of any college football program. The Orange boast eight inductees, tied for the eight-most of any school. Only Notre Dame (13), USC (13), Michigan (11), Ohio State (10), Miami (9), and Pittsburgh (9) have more representatives in the Pro Football Hall of Fame than Syracuse.[158] The National Football League 100th Anniversary All-Time Team was revealed in 2019 after being voted on by a panel consisting of media members, former players and league personnel. It honored the best players of the first 100 years of the National Football League (NFL). The team was chosen by a panel of 26 voters made up of coaches, team and front office executives, former players and members of the media between April and June 2018. Players were selected at each position group, and were voted in no order. There will be 10 quarterbacks, 12 running backs, 10 wide receivers, 5 tight ends, 7 tackles, 7 guards, 4 centers, 7 defensive ends, 7 defensive tackles, 6 outside linebackers, 6 middle/inside linebackers, 7 cornerbacks, 6 safeties, 2 kickers, 2 punters, 2 kick/punt returners, and 10 coaches.

Archbold, who donated $600,000 for the project. The Orange battled for victory inside the walls of Archbold Stadium from 1907 until 1978. Orange fans of the early 1900s were astonished by Archbold's unique design. The stadium's front entrance defined the character of Archbold, which consisted of an impressive cement arch and two epic towers, which extended high above the archway. In addition to providing the university and the fans with an aesthetically beautiful stadium, Archbold gave the Orange football team a distinct home field advantage for all 71 years of its existence. The Orange went 265–112–20 all-time at Archbold, and at times were nearly unbeatable. From 1915 to 1927, Syracuse achieved a remarkable home record of 61–10–6. Then, during the 11-year stretch from 1958 to 1968, the team in Orange won 47 and lost only 6 games played at Archbold Stadium.[169] Toward the end of the 1970s, Syracuse University was under pressure to improve its football facilities in order to remain a Division I-A football school. Archbold Stadium could not be expanded; earlier in the decade it had been reduced from 40,000 seats to 26,000 due to fire codes. Therefore, Syracuse University decided to build a new stadium on the site of Archbold, which, appropriately for Syracuse's often cold weather, was to have a domed Teflon-coated, fiberglass inflatable roof. While the JMA Wireless Dome was being built during the 1979 season, Syracuse played \"home\" games at three different locations—Giants Stadium, home of the NFL's New York Giants; Rich Stadium (now known as New Era Field), home of the NFL's Buffalo Bills; and Schoellkopf Field, home of the Cornell Big Red. The Syracuse Orange football team plays their games at the JMA Wireless Dome, referred to as the JMA Dome. The stadium is also known as \"The Loud House\", when it opened in September 1980, it was made clear just how loud it was inside; soon famous nickname was coined. It is the largest domed stadium of any college campus and the largest domed stadium in the Northeastern United States. The JMA Wireless Dome is used for several sports at the university and seats 49,250 for football.[1] The field was dedicated in 2009 to Ernie Davis, the first African American Heisman Trophy winner. The field now reads \"Ernie Davis Legends Field\" between the 45 yard lines on the home side. Davis's number forty-four was also placed along that yard line. The dedication took place at the Syracuse vs. West Virginia game October 10, 2009.[170] In May 2018, the university announced the first phase of a major renovation to the JMA Wireless Dome as the central portion of a larger campus update. The most significant changes were the replacement of the current air-supported roof with a fixed roof, two-thirds of which will be translucent, the installation of air conditioning and the largest centerhung videoboard in college sports.[171] The upgrade also included a new lighting and sound systems, Wi-Fi improvements, accessibility upgrades, improved restrooms, and new concession spaces.[172] The high-profile renovation project by Geiger Engineers - the same firm that was the structural engineer for the original stadium, was named a winner of NCSEA's 2021 Excellence in Structural Engineering Award for Forensic/Renovation/Retrofit/Rehabilitation Structures.[173] The school announced the next phase of its work to enhance, elevate and expand the stadium experience in April, 2022. This includes a complete replacement of benches with individual seats; a construction of a new publicly accessible event facility adjacent to the Dome; and an upgrade of the entire digital infrastructure, including latest 5G technology and wireless connectivity.[174] The renovation of both phases, estimated to cost $165 million, was completed in 2024. Announced schedules as of November 14, 2024.[175]",

The Orange played their home games at the JMA Wireless Dome, competing as members of the Atlantic Coast Conference. They were led by first-year head coach Fran Brown. The Orange were in their 123rd season overall and their twelfth as a member of the ACC.[1] On November 2, the Orange defeated Virginia Tech for their sixth win, securing bowl eligibility for the third season in a row. This is the first time the Orange have been bowl eligible for three consecutive seasons since the program played in five straight bowls from 1995 through 1999.[2] For the first time since 1998, Syracuse beat three AP top 25 teams (Miami (FL), UNLV, and Georgia Tech) in the same season.[3] In the regular season finale on November 30, the Orange defeated Miami to secure their ninth win, which is the most regular season wins for the program since the 2018 season and just the third time since 2000 (2001, 2018). Syracuse erased a 21-point first half deficit and won 42–38, which marked the largest comeback win in program history.[3][4] Dino Babers, who coached the team from 2016 to 2023, was fired from his role as head coach at Syracuse on November 19, 2023, one game before the end of the 2023 regular season. Babers had just two winning seasons during his eight years at Syracuse.[7] He moved to become the offensive coordinator at the University of Arizona. First year offensive coordinator Jason Beck took the same position at New Mexico.[8] First year defensive coordinator Rocky Long was hired as a defensive analyst at Fort Lewis College.[9] On November 28, 2023, Fran Brown was named the 31st head coach of the Orange.[10][11] Brown was named #1 national recruiter by 247Sports in 2023,[12] and previously served as the defensive backs coach at Georgia, Baylor, Rutgers, and Temple. His deep recruiting ties in South Jersey, one of Syracuse's primary recruiting grounds, were cited as a major reason for his hiring.[13][14] Jeff Nixon and Elijah Robinson were hired as OC and DC, respectively.[15][16] The Syracuse Orange were ranked 16th nationally with 77% of their production returning, according to data compiled by ESPN’s Bill Connelly.[17] Over the course of the off-season, Syracuse lost over 35 players to graduation and to the transfer portal (29). No Orange players were selected in the 2024 NFL draft,[18] but three former Orange were selected in the first round of the 2024 CFL Draft.[19] Syracuse's 2024 class consisted of 25 signees.[20] The class was ranked eighth in the ACC and 37th best overall by the 247Sports Composite.[21] Sources: 2024 Overall class rankings Syracuse had 29 departures with an average 247Sports rating of 85, and welcomed 23 transfer players with an average rating of 87.17.

He was chosen as part of XXL magazine's 2015 annual Freshman Class.[4] He was also the founder of the hip hop collective OGG, through which he discovered then-unknown producer OG Parker. In 2016, he released an extended play titled For Scott… as a tribute to his biggest influence, American rapper Kid Cudi, whose real name is Scott Mescudi. Benedict Chiajulam Ihesiba Jr. was born on April 23, 1992, in College Park, Georgia. He grew up with friends in a band named Dr. Doctor, in which he was a guitarist and singer.[5] Maco cited Black Sabbath, Kid Cudi, and Currensy as major influences.[6][7][8] Ihesiba was seriously injured in a traffic collision on July 28, 2016. He suffered multiple skull fractures, cracked vertebrae, a broken orbital, and heart palpitations, and nearly lost his right eye.[9][10] In 2019, he was diagnosed with the flesh-eating disease necrotizing fasciitis, causing an improperly treated minor skin rash to leave much of his facial skin disfigured.[11][12] Ihesiba struggled with depression from his battle with the condition,[13] and on December 12, 2024, he was hospitalized after a self-inflicted gunshot wound to the head.[14][15] He spent the next two weeks in a coma before dying from his injuries on December 27, 2024.[16][17]",

                "content": "Rapper OG Maco has died at the age of 32, his family announced Friday on Instagram, reportedly two weeks after suffering a self-inflicted gunshot wound. \"With heavy hearts, we share the heartbreaking news of the passing of our beloved Ben, known to the world as OG Maco,\" the post read about the rapper, whose legal name was Benedict Chiajulam Ihesiba Jr. \"His life was a testament to resilience, creativity, and boundless love. Through his music, passion, and unwavering spirit, he touched so many lives and left a lasting impact.\" OG Maco's family did not reveal his official cause of death but told fans on December 16 that the Georgia native was \"in critical, but stable condition\" while receiving \"the best possible care.\" TMZ reported on December 12 that OG Maco had been taken to the hospital in Los Angeles with a gunshot wound to the head. Newsweek reached out to representatives for OG Maco via email for comment. In March 2019, OG Maco revealed on Instagram that he had developed necrotizing fasciitis after being \"improperly treated for a minor rash.\" Necrotizing fasciitis, commonly known as flesh-eating disease, is a rare but severe bacterial infection that rapidly destroys soft tissue. \"I was improperly treated for a minor rash and ended up with a skin-eating disease for the last few months,\" he shared in a since-deleted Instagram post of his face, according to Complex. \"This is the best it's looked. I hope it gives someone hope. I've been going through this alone 90 percent of the time, without the support of the person I love, without most of my 'friends,' without anything but my own strength and God.\" According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the disease is caused by Group A Streptococcus bacteria, which are contagious. While most cases occur randomly, less severe group A strep infections can develop into this serious condition. Early symptoms of necrotizing fasciitis include a red, warm, or swollen area of skin that spreads quickly, severe pain beyond the affected area, and fever. As the condition progresses, symptoms may include changes in skin color, ulcers, blisters, black spots, pus or oozing from the infected area, fatigue, dizziness, and diarrhea or nausea. Immediate medical attention is crucial, as the infection can lead to organ failure, sepsis, shock, and even death. Treatment typically involves prompt surgical removal of infected tissue and intravenous antibiotics. People with weakened immune systems or chronic health conditions, such as diabetes or cancer, are at higher risk, especially if they have open wounds or recent injuries. A post shared by DJ Akademiks (@akademiks) OG Maco also told fans in an Instagram video that he became depressed after receiving his necrotizing fasciitis diagnosis. \"Everybody I really thought would be here, who I really thought I could depend on, weren't there,\" he said. \"I was scared; I didn't know what was going to happen; I didn't know if I was going to lose my entire face...I almost did. My friend told me the other day that maybe I should share what I've been going through instead of beating myself down for feeling how I felt about it, which I wanted to die a bunch of days.\" In 2015, Doja Cat briefly signed with OG Maco's label, OGG (Originality Gains Greatness). They later collaborated on the song \"Monster,\" featured on Maco's 2017 mixtape Children of The Rage. \"I made another rock song,\" OG Maco tweeted at the time of the song's release, according to XXL. \"It's not rap at all but the blogs gonna say it is because I'm supposed to be a 'rapper.'\" \"Monster is one of those records that's built for arenas. It's made for you to enjoy that song with 20,000 other people with some lighters and cellphones. It's real rock star s***,\" he said in a 2015 interview with DJBooth. Newsweek reached out to representatives for Doja Cat via email for comment. No, OG Maco's record label, OGG, no longer exists. Born in College Park, Georgia, Maco began recording music in high school and cofounded OGG. He gained fame in 2014 with his mixtape Live Life and the hit single \"U Guessed It,\" which peaked at No. 90 on the Billboard Hot 100 after a remix with 2 Chainz. Later that year, OG Maco signed with Quality Control Music, which became an imprint of Capitol Music Group/Motown in 2015. DJ Paul of Three 6 Mafia commented on OG Maco's Instagram post on Friday: \"F–k bro!!!! Man i had a batch ready for u! Take it back to us sleeping in the studio on the floor n s–t in Noho 2015 trying to get them records right! U always had them hooks for any beat i had! We was a team the world never gota chance to witness... we was too early. Now was the time, the people want the hard s–t now!

                "content": "Rapper OG Maco has died two weeks after suffering a self-inflicted gunshot wound. He was 32. Maco, best known for his song “U Guessed It,” passed away surrounded by his family Thursday night at a Los Angeles hospital, according to TMZ. Maco’s family later confirmed his death in a post shared on the rapper’s Instagram account Friday. “With heavy hearts, we share the heartbreaking news of the passing of our beloved Ben, known to the world as OG Maco,” the family’s statement began. “His life was a testament to resilience, creativity, and boundless love. Through his music, passion, and unwavering spirit, he touched so many lives and left a lasting impact.” “While we grieve this immense loss, we also celebrate the extraordinary life he lived – one that will continue to inspire and uplift others,” the family added. “Maco’s influence, both as an artist and as a person, will remain forever etched in our hearts.” “For those who wish to offer condolences, share memories, or connect with the family, please reach out through this account. Your support means more than words can express.” The statement concluded, “To all of Maco’s fans, friends, and supporters: thank you for standing by him throughout his journey. Today, we celebrate a life that was extraordinary in every way.” Born Benedict Chiajulam Ihesiba Jr., OG Maco had been hospitalized since sustaining a self-inflicted gunshot wound to the head on Dec. 12. Sources claimed Maco was in a coma as of Thursday and recently took a turn for the worse, which sent him into critical condition. The hospital staff were reportedly unable to revive him. Before his passing, doctors supposedly struggled to obtain a proper brain scan as they attempted to flush out toxins from Maco’s body. Maco was found by police at his Los Angeles area home with a firearm close by after a neighbor called 911 and reported hearing a gunshot go off in the star’s house on the morning of Dec. 12, according to TMZ. He was unresponsive, rushed to a local hospital and immediately went into surgery. The rapper’s family reportedly flew to LA to be by his side. Three days after being admitted to the hospital, Maco’s family released a statement on the rapper’s Instagram. “We want to inform OG Maco’s fans, friends, and supporters that he is currently in critical but stable condition,” they wrote at the time. “He is receiving the best possible care, and we are staying hopeful as he continues to fight.” They continued, “We thank you for your understanding, support, and continued prayers during this difficult time.” Before his hospitalization, rumors had circulated online that Maco was dead. The Atlanta-born rapper broke onto the music scene in 2014 after becoming one of hip-hop label Quality Control’s first signees and releasing his debut single “U Guessed It.” A remix featuring 2 Chainz reached the 90 spot on the Billboard Hot 100. Maco was included in XXL’s 2015 Freshman Class, the outlet’s annual list of 10 up-and-coming rappers who they feel are defining the new wave of hip-hop. Just three years later, however, he announced he was retiring from music. Not long after, he revealed he had been diagnosed with a “skin-eating disease.” But by 2019, he was on the mend. Maco ended up continuing to make music, releasing a self-titled album last year and a new single, “Shawty,” featuring Fnx in November. The Post has reached out to reps for OG Maco.

                "content": "The Vanderbilt Commodores football program represents Vanderbilt University in the sport of American football. The Commodores compete in the Football Bowl Subdivision (FBS) of the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) within the Southeastern Conference (SEC). They are led by head coach Clark Lea. Vanderbilt plays their home games at FirstBank Stadium, located on the university's Nashville, Tennessee campus. Vanderbilt has a winning percentage of .464, the average among all members in the Southeastern Conference. They have had no seasons with ten wins, but 10 with ten losses. Adopting the nickname the Commodores after the 1897 season, the team has played in 1,250 games over 126 seasons. In that time, seven coaches have led the Commodores to a postseason bowl appearance: Art Guepe, Ethan Halbert, George MacIntyre, Bobby Johnson, James Franklin, Derek Mason, and Clark Lea. Four have led them to a conference championship: R. G. Acton, W. H. Watkins, James R. Henry, and Dan McGugin. McGugin is the leader in seasons coached and games won, with 198 victories during his 30 years at Vanderbilt. He was awarded two National Championships retroactively by Clyde Berryman. Of the 29 different head coaches who have led the Commodores, McGugin,[3] Ray Morrison,[4] Red Sanders,[5] and Bill Edwards[6] have been inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame. The head coach is Clark Lea, who was hired on December 14, 2020. Vanderbilt has been affiliated with the following conferences.[citation needed] Vanderbilt has won 14 conference championships, with six shared and eight won outright. † Co-champions Vanderbilt has been awarded 6 national championships for the years 1906, 1910, 1911, 1918, 1921, and 1922. The school does not claim any of these national titles. Vanderbilt has had 8 undefeated seasons in the years 1890, 1897, 1904, 1910, 1921, 1922, 1943, and 1944. Vanderbilt has been invited to nine bowl games, with the Commodores garnering a record of 5–4–1 in bowl games. Having started in 1893, the Georgia-Vanderbilt football series was played annually from 1968 to 2023. The two were divisional opponents in the SEC East from 1992 to 2023. The series, which rotates between Nashville, Tennessee, and Athens, Georgia, stands with Georgia leading 61-20–2 through the 2023 season.[18] Under the new SEC format, they are not scheduled to play each other again in the regular season until at least 2026.[19] Having started in 1896, the Kentucky-Vanderbilt football series has been played annually since 1953.[20] The two were divisional opponents in the SEC East. The series, which rotates between Nashville, Tennessee and Lexington, Kentucky, is led by Kentucky at 48-44-4 with the average score being Vanderbilt 17.2-Kentucky 16.9[21] Ole Miss was Vanderbilt's cross-divisional rival in the SEC from 1992 to 2023. Vanderbilt and Ole Miss have played 98 times since 1894.[22] Ole Miss leads the series 56-40-2.[22] The largest margin of victory was by 91 points won by Vanderbilt in 1915. Vanderbilt also holds the longest win streak in the series (18) from 1894 to 1938. Under the new SEC format, they are not scheduled to play again in the regular season until at least 2026.[23] Vanderbilt and Tennessee have played 117 times since 1892 , Tennessee leads the series 79–33-5.[24] When the rivalry first started Vanderbilt dominated by taking 19 of the first 24 with 3 ties. But from 1928 to 2022 however, Tennessee has dominated going 77–14–2 against Vanderbilt. The largest margin of victory for Vanderbilt was by 76 points in 1918 at Old Dudley Field in Nashville. (Vanderbilt 76, Tennessee 0) The largest defeat was 65 points in 1994 at Vanderbilt Stadium (Tennessee 65, Vanderbilt 0). The longest win streaks for Vanderbilt is (9) from 1901 to 1913. The longest win streak for Tennessee is 22, from 1983 to 2004.[25] The Commodores first met the Georgia Tech Yellow Jackets in 1892 in Atlanta, Georgia with Vanderbilt winning 20–10.[26] Since 1924, the winning team in the series has received a silver-plated cowbell with the year and final score of each game engraved on it. The trophy was created by Ed F. Cavaleri, who was described by the Atlanta Constitution as “a faithful Georgia Tech supporter though he did not attend the Jacket institution,” according to Georgia Tech's website. Cavaleri purchased a cowbell at an Atlanta hardware store to use as a noise-maker while on his way to a game in 1924. The Commodores defeated Georgia Tech 3–0, however another fan in attendance suggested that Cavaleri award the bell to the winning team. The tradition was born and Cavaleri attended every game between the two teams from 1924 to 1967.[27] The cowbell has a gold plate screwed into each side, with “GEORGIA TECH-VANDERBILT FOOTBALL TROPHY” inscribed at the top. Three columns list the year of each game, Vanderbilt’s points scored and Georgia Tech’s points scored. The results of the games from 1924 to 1967 are engraved on one side; the results from 2002, 2003, 2009 and 2016 are on the other.[28] Vanderbilt is 16–20-3 against Georgia Tech in 39 games. The Commodores won the most recent matchup 35–27 in the 2024 Birmingham Bowl. Vanderbilt and the Sewanee Tigers were both founding members of the Southern Intercollegiate Athletic Association (SIAA), the Southern Conference, and the Southeastern Conference (SEC). It is the oldest of Vanderbilt's rivalries;[29] dating back to 1891 when Vanderbilt played its second football game. Vanderbilt leads the series 40–8–4.[30] The largest margin of victory was in 1905 when Vanderbilt won 68–4. Usually played towards the end of the season on Thanksgiving Day, the two teams have not met again since 1944 and are unlikely to anytime soon as Sewanee plays in NCAA Division III. Traditionally, Vanderbilt has featured differing designs of gold helmets, black jerseys, and gold or black pants at home, and gold helmets, white jerseys and gold, or white pants on the road. Meanwhile, the traditional alternate uniform saw gold helmets and jerseys matched with white pants.[31] The James Franklin (2011–2013), and Derek Mason (2014–2020) eras saw the introduction of several new combinations- including \"blackout” (i.e. all black), and \"whiteout\" (i.e. all white) uniforms. The team's gold alternate jerseys were also re-designed with the addition of black shoulders and a more muted gold.[32] Eventually, battleship gray was incorporated as well.[33] The Clark Lea (2021–Present) era has seen a return to traditional gold helmets (note: featuring a modernized “V” logo), black jerseys, and gold pants at home, and gold helmets, white jerseys, and gold (or white) pants on the road.[34] More recently, Vanderbilt introduced new all white (\"whiteout\"),[35] and all black (\"blackout\") uniforms[36] for the 2024 season opening up the possiblity of several different combinations. Vanderbilt Commodore football personnel have been inducted into the National Football Foundation's National College Football Hall of Fame.[37] Vanderbilt has had seven consensus All-Americans in their history. In 2016, Zach Cunningham became the first unanimous All-American in Vanderbilt's history.[38] Vanderbilt Commodores personnel, including coaches and players, have received recognition from the Southeastern Conference for their performances on the football field.[37] Five Vanderbilt players have been awarded Most Valuable Player, with three of them being awarded over a six year span to Commodores. One Vanderbilt player has won Offensive Player of the Year honors. Two players have won Freshman of the Year while at Vanderbilt. One Commodore has won Best Blocker, doing so twice. Five Vanderbilt coaches have won Coach of the Year honors over the past century. From 1992 to 2023, Vanderbilt played in the East Division of the SEC and played each opponent in the division each year along with several teams from the West Division. The SEC will expand the conference to 16 teams and will eliminate its two divisions in 2024, causing a new scheduling format for the Commodores to play against the other members of the conference.[39] Only the 2024 conference schedule was announced on June 14, 2023, while the conference still considers a new format for the future.[40] Announced schedules as of December 12, 2024[41] Seifried, C.S., & Pfleegor, A.

The Commodores were led by Clark Lea in his fourth year as their head coach. On October 5, 2024, Vanderbilt beat No. 1 Alabama 40–35, not only gaining their first victory over the Crimson Tide in 40 years,[1] but also gaining their first ever win over an AP top 5 opponent after going 0–60 all time against them prior to that matchup.[2] Their fans carried the South end zone goalposts 2.9 miles through downtown Nashville and Broadway before dumping them in the Cumberland River across from Nissan Stadium. Fans made it past many road blocks by the Nashville Metropolitan PD, and even took a detour around Bridgestone Arena to avoid police. They were fined $100,000 by the SEC. The following week, Vanderbilt achieved another upset against double digit spread by beating the Kentucky Wildcats for their first win on the road of the season.[3] On October 20, The Commodores achieved their first AP Top 25 ranking for the first time since the end of the 2013 season, at No. 25.[3] The Commodores faced their historic rival Georgia Tech in the 2024 Birmingham Bowl. With the win over Georgia Tech, the Commodores won their first bowl game and secured their first winning season since 2013. The SEC media poll was released on July 19, 2024. The Commodores were predicted to finish 16th (last) in the conference, but also received two first-place votes.[4] [9][10] Roster Last update: September 3, 2024 at FirstBank Stadium, Nashville, Tennessee Second quarter Third quarter Fourth quarter Overtime at FirstBank Stadium, Nashville, Tennessee Second quarter Third quarter Fourth quarter at Center Parc Stadium, Atlanta, Georgia Second quarter Third quarter Fourth quarter at Faurot Field, Columbia, Missouri Second quarter Third quarter Fourth quarter Overtime Second overtime at FirstBank Stadium, Nashville, Tennessee Second quarter Third quarter Fourth quarter This was Vanderbilt's first win over Alabama since 1984[1] and its first win against the Crimson Tide in Nashville since 1969.[11] This was also the Commodores first win over a AP Top 5 opponent in program history.[2] at Kroger Field, Lexington, Kentucky Second quarter Third quarter Fourth quarter at FirstBank Stadium, Nashville, Tennessee Second quarter Third quarter Fourth quarter at FirstBank Stadium, Nashville, Tennessee Second quarter Third quarter Fourth quarter at Jordan–Hare Stadium, Auburn, Alabama Second quarter Third quarter Fourth quarter at FirstBank Stadium, Nashville, Tennessee Second quarter Third quarter Fourth quarter at Tiger Stadium, Baton Rouge, Louisiana Second quarter Third quarter Fourth quarter at FirstBank Stadium, Nashville, Tennessee Second quarter Third quarter Fourth quarter at Protective Stadium • Birmingham, Alabama",

                "content": "Michael Burton Brown[1] (born March 5, 1970) is an American basketball coach who most recently served as the head coach for the Sacramento Kings of the National Basketball Association (NBA). Brown was previously the head coach of the Cleveland Cavaliers, the Los Angeles Lakers, and most recently an assistant coach for the Golden State Warriors. He is also the head coach of the Nigerian national team. Brown began coaching the Cleveland Cavaliers in 2005. The team reached the 2007 NBA Finals, where they were swept by the San Antonio Spurs. Brown was honored as NBA Coach of the Year for leading the Cavaliers to a team-record and league-best 66 wins in 2009. The Cavaliers won 61 games, again a league-best, in 2010. However, after the Cavaliers lost to the Boston Celtics in the 2010 Eastern Conference semifinals, Brown was fired. Brown succeeded Phil Jackson as the head coach of the Los Angeles Lakers in 2011 before being dismissed five games into the 2012–13 season. He returned to the Cavaliers in 2013, but was fired after one season. Brown then joined the Golden State Warriors as associate head coach in 2016; the team went on to defeat the Cavaliers in the 2017 and 2018 NBA Finals, and the Boston Celtics in the 2022 NBA Finals. He departed from the Warriors in 2022 to become the head coach of the Sacramento Kings. In his first year as head coach, Brown led the Kings to their first playoff appearance in 17 years, snapping the longest playoff drought in NBA history. For his efforts, Brown became the first-ever unanimous NBA Coach of the Year award winner and was named to the NBCA Coach of the Year award in 2023. Brown was born on March 5, 1970, in Columbus, Ohio,[2] to a father who served in the US Air Force.[3] He moved with his family to military bases where his father was stationed and spent time in the United States, Japan and Germany during his childhood.[3][4] Brown graduated in 1988 from Würzburg American High School in Würzburg, Germany, where he excelled in basketball and football.[5] After studying and playing basketball for two years at Mesa Community College, Brown went on to the University of San Diego, where he played two seasons of college basketball for the San Diego Toreros and graduated in 1992 with a Bachelor of Business Administration degree.[6] Brown began his NBA career in 1992 with the Denver Nuggets, where he was a video coordinator and scout for five seasons. In 1997, Brown moved to Washington for two seasons, working as an assistant coach under Bernie Bickerstaff.[7] In 2000, Brown was hired by Gregg Popovich as an assistant coach with the San Antonio Spurs.[8] He also was the head coach for the Spurs' summer league teams in Boston and Salt Lake City.[9] The Spurs won an NBA championship in 2003 while Brown was on their coaching staff.[10] In 2003, Brown was hired as associate head coach under Rick Carlisle with the Indiana Pacers.[8] He helped lead Indiana to consecutive playoff appearances, including a trip to the Eastern Conference finals in 2004.[11] Brown followed Ron Artest into the stands and was instrumental in getting him back to the locker room during the massive brawl between the Pacers, Detroit Pistons, and Pistons fans at the Palace at Auburn Hills on November 19, 2004.[12] Brown remained with the Pacers for two seasons.[10] In June 2005, Brown replaced Brendan Malone as head coach of the Cleveland Cavaliers. It was his first NBA head coaching position. Brown became the second-youngest coach in the league (trailing only Lawrence Frank).[6] When Brown arrived in Cleveland, the Cavs had missed the playoffs in emerging superstar LeBron James's first two NBA seasons and had not made the playoffs since 1998. Under Brown, they won 50 games, made the 2005–06 playoffs, and won their first-round series.[13] On June 2, 2007, Brown's Cavaliers defeated the Detroit Pistons in the Eastern Conference finals and advanced to the NBA Finals for the first time in franchise history.[14] However, they were swept in four games by his former team, the San Antonio Spurs.[15] On February 1, 2008, Brown was named the Eastern Conference Coach of the Month for January 2008.[16] In 2009, Brown was named coach of the Eastern Conference All-Star team.[17] On April 20, 2009, Brown was named NBA Coach of the Year after guiding the Cavaliers to a league-high[18] and franchise-best 66–16 record.[17] The Cavs won a league-high 61 games in the 2009–10 season.[19] However, the team was eliminated by the Boston Celtics in the Eastern Conference semifinals on May 13, 2010. With this loss, the Cavaliers became the first team in NBA history to win 60 games in back-to-back seasons without advancing to the NBA Finals.[20] Brown was fired on May 24, 2010, due to the owner Dan Gilbert wanting to lure LeBron James back to Cleveland.[21][22] Under Brown's leadership, the Cavs made it past the first round of the NBA playoffs for five consecutive seasons.[23] On May 25, 2011, Brown agreed to succeed Phil Jackson as head coach of the Los Angeles Lakers. He reportedly agreed to a three-year deal with a team option to renew his contract for a fourth year.[24] On May 31, 2011, he was officially named the Lakers' new head coach.[25] The 2011–12 season was shortened to 66 games by the lockout that season, and the Lakers were eliminated in the second round of the playoffs.[26] Before the 2012–13 season, Brown decided that the Lakers would use a version of the Princeton offense.[27] Shortly afterward, the Lakers acquired All-Stars Steve Nash and Dwight Howard, giving them a starting lineup of five former All-Stars with a combined 33 All-Star game appearances (the other former All-Stars were Kobe Bryant, Pau Gasol, and Metta World Peace, respectively).[28] Although immediately considered top title contenders, the Lakers struggled to adjust to the changes in both system and personnel and were winless in eight preseason games.[29] The team's travails continued into the start of the regular season, with the team losing four of its first five games.[30] Nash had played just 1+1⁄2 games due to injury, Howard was playing but recovering from back surgery, and Bryant had been playing with an injured foot and was unable to practice. On November 9, 2012, Brown was fired.[31] The Lakers felt an urgency to win given their aging stars, Howard's pending free agency, and owner Jerry Buss's deteriorating health.[31][32] Brown's dismissal after five games was the third-fastest coaching change in NBA history.[33] On April 24, 2013, Brown was rehired by the Cavaliers, replacing Byron Scott as head coach.[34] Cavaliers owner Dan Gilbert said that firing Brown the first time was a \"mistake\".[35] For the first time as a head coach, Brown's team posted a losing record over an 82-game season as his team was marred by injuries and reported infighting in the locker room.[36] On May 12, 2014, he was fired by Gilbert a second time.[37] On July 6, 2016, the Golden State Warriors hired Brown as an assistant coach; he replaced Luke Walton, who departed for a head coaching position with the Los Angeles Lakers.[38] Brown served as acting head coach during periods in which head coach Steve Kerr was unable to do so due to chronic back pain. Brown led the Warriors to a 12–0 record in the 2016–17 NBA playoffs while Kerr was absent;[39] the Warriors went on to win the championship in five games that year, defeating the Cleveland Cavaliers.[40] The Warriors finished the playoffs with a 16–1 record, the best postseason winning percentage in NBA history.[41] The Warriors went back to the Finals in 2018 and defeated the Cleveland Cavaliers in the Finals for the second straight year. During these two finals he faced off against LeBron James, whom he had coached for five years in Cleveland.[40] On May 9, 2022, he was the Warriors' acting head coach for Game 4 of the Western Conference semifinals against the Memphis Grizzlies after Kerr tested positive for COVID-19. The team won the game to take a 3–1 lead in the series.[42] The Warriors made it to the 2022 NBA Finals where they defeated the Boston Celtics in six games to give Brown his fourth NBA championship as an assistant coach and third championship with the Warriors overall. On May 9, 2022, Brown was named the head coach of the Sacramento Kings.[43][44] In his inaugural season, he coached the Kings to a 48–34 record and the team's first playoff appearance since 2006. He was subsequently named NBA Coach of the Year for the 2022–23 season, receiving 100 votes and becoming the first coach in history to win the award by a unanimous vote.[45][46] On December 27, 2024, the Kings fired Brown.[47][48] The previous day, Sacramento fell at home to the Detroit Pistons despite holding a ten-point lead with under three minutes remaining in regulation, as Jaden Ivey converted on a four-point play in the final seconds for a 114–113 Detroit victory.[49] On February 5, 2020, Brown was announced as the new head coach of Nigeria's men's national basketball team.[50][51] Brown's brother Anthony Brown played in the NFL.[52] Media related to Mike Brown (basketball, born 1970) at Wikimedia Commons # denotes interim head coach # denotes interim head coach # denotes interim head coach",

                "content": "On August 9, 2014, 18-year-old Michael Brown was shot and killed by police officer Darren Wilson in Ferguson, Missouri, a suburb of St. Louis.[2] Brown was accompanied by his 22-year-old male friend Dorian Johnson.[3] Wilson, a white male Ferguson police officer, said that an altercation ensued when Brown attacked him in his police vehicle for control of Wilson's service pistol. The struggle continued until the pistol fired.[4] Johnson said that Wilson initiated a confrontation by grabbing Brown by the neck through Wilson's patrol car window, threatening him and then shooting at him.[5] At this point, both Wilson and Johnson state that Brown and Johnson fled, with Wilson pursuing Brown shortly thereafter. Wilson stated that Brown stopped and charged him after a short pursuit. Johnson contradicted this account, stating that Brown turned around with his hands raised after Wilson shot at his back. According to Johnson, Wilson then shot Brown multiple times until Brown fell to the ground. In the entire altercation, Wilson fired a total of twelve bullets, including twice during the struggle in the car.[6] Brown was struck six times, all in the front of his body.[7][8][9] This event ignited unrest in Ferguson. Witnesses to the shooting claimed Brown had his hands up in surrender or said \"don't shoot\", so protesters later used the slogan \"Hands up, don't shoot\".[10] A subsequent FBI investigation said that there was no evidence that Brown had done so.[11] Peaceful protests and violent riots continued for more than a week in Ferguson; police later established a nightly curfew. The response of area police agencies in dealing with the protests was strongly criticized by both the media and politicians. Concerns were raised over insensitivity, tactics, and a militarized response. A grand jury was called and given evidence from Robert McCulloch, the St. Louis County Prosecutor. On November 24, 2014, McCulloch announced the St. Louis County grand jury had decided not to indict Wilson.[12] In March 2015, the U.S. Department of Justice reported the conclusion of its own investigation and cleared Wilson of civil rights violations in the shooting. It claimed that Wilson's account was \"corroborated by bruising on Wilson's jaw and scratches on his neck, the presence of Brown's DNA on Wilson's collar, shirt and pants, and Wilson's DNA on Brown's palm\", and claimed that witnesses who corroborated the officer's account were credible.[13][14] The U.S. Department of Justice concluded that Wilson shot Brown in self-defense.[15][16] In 2020, St. Louis County prosecutor Wesley Bell spent five months reviewing the case with an eye to charge Wilson with either manslaughter or murder. In July, Bell announced Wilson would not be charged.[17] Michael Orlandus Darrion Brown[18] (May 20, 1996[19] – August 9, 2014) graduated from Normandy High School in St. Louis County eight days before his death, completing an alternative education program.[20] At the time of his death, he was 18 years old, 6 feet 4 inches (1.93 meters) tall, and weighed 292 pounds (132 kilograms).[9] He was an amateur rap musician who posted his songs on the popular music-sharing site SoundCloud under the handle \"Big'Mike.\"[21] He was two days from starting a training program for heating and air conditioning repair at Vatterott College technical school.[22] Darren Dean Wilson[23] (born May 14, 1986, in Fort Worth, Texas)[24] is 6 ft 4 in (1.93 m) tall and at the time weighed about 210 lb (95 kg).[25][26] Wilson's first police job was in the town of Jennings, Missouri, where he began working in 2009.[26][27] With respect to this job, Wilson said to The New Yorker in 2015, \"I'd never been in an area where there was that much poverty.\"[27] The police force in Jennings was shut down by the town's city council in March 2011.[26] In October 2011, Wilson began working for the Ferguson Police Department.[28] In February 2013, Wilson won a commendation from the Ferguson Police Department after he apprehended a suspect who was later charged with possession of marijuana with intent to distribute and resisting arrest.[28] Surveillance video which was publicly released in the 2017 documentary film Stranger Fruit shows Michael Brown walking into Ferguson Market and Liquor at 1:13 a.m., ten-and-a-half hours before he entered the store for the final time. The footage shows Brown handing a young clerk a brown package, believed by the filmmaker to be marijuana, and then receiving an unpurchased package of cigarillos from the store. After the video was rediscovered and made public in 2017, some, including Brown's family, said they believed Brown had left the package there for safekeeping and later returned to retrieve it. The store owner disputed this through an attorney who dismissed claims that the store traded him \"cigarillos for pot.\" The lawyer claimed \"[t]he reason he [Brown] gave it back is he was walking out the door with unpaid merchandise and they [the staff] wanted it back.\"[29] The store's attorney said the video had been in the hands of Brown's family and law enforcement since the initial investigation, and said the video had been edited to remove the portion where the store clerk returned Brown's package to him.[30] Following this, on March 13, 2017, unedited footage from the store was released by the St. Louis County prosecutor to try to settle questions.[31] At 11:47 a.m., Officer Wilson responded to a call about a baby with breathing problems and drove to Glenark Drive in Ferguson, east of Canfield Drive.[32] About three minutes later and several blocks away, Brown was recorded on camera stealing a box of Swisher Sweets cigars and forcefully shoving a Ferguson Market clerk. At 11:53, a police dispatcher reported \"stealing in progress\" at the Ferguson Market and described the suspect as a black male wearing a white T-shirt running toward QuikTrip. The suspect was reported as having stolen a box of Swisher cigars.[32] Brown and his friend, Dorian Johnson, left the market at about 11:54 a.m.[33] At 11:57, the dispatch described the suspect as wearing a red St. Louis Cardinals hat, a white T-shirt, yellow socks, and khaki shorts, and that he was accompanied by another male.[32] Ferguson Police Chief Thomas Jackson said that the incident with Brown stealing cigars had \"nothing to do\" with why Brown was stopped by Wilson prior to the shooting, and that the reason Brown and Johnson were stopped was because \"they were walking down the middle of the street, blocking traffic.\"[34] At 12:00 p.m., Wilson reported he was back in service and radioed units 25 and 22 to ask if they needed his assistance in searching for the suspects.[32] Seven seconds later, an unidentified officer said the suspects had disappeared.[32] Wilson called for backup at 12:02, saying \"[Unit] 21. Put me on Canfield with two. And send me another car.\"[32] Initial reports of what happened next differed widely among sources and witnesses, particularly with regard to whether Brown was moving towards Wilson when the shots were fired. At noon on August 9, Wilson drove up to Brown and Johnson as they were walking in the middle of Canfield Drive and ordered them to move off the street. Wilson continued driving past the two men, but then backed up and stopped close to them.[35][9][36][37] A struggle took place between Brown and Wilson after Brown reached through the window of Wilson's police SUV, a Chevrolet Tahoe.[38] Wilson was armed with a SIG Sauer P229[39] pistol, which was fired twice during the struggle from inside the vehicle, with one bullet hitting Brown's right hand.[38][39] Brown and Johnson fled and Johnson hid behind a car.[40] Wilson got out of the vehicle and pursued Brown.[41] At some point, Wilson fired his pistol again, while facing Brown, and hit him with at least six shots, all in the front of his body.[9] Brown was unarmed and died on the street.[38][42] Less than 90 seconds passed from the time Wilson encountered Brown to the time of Brown's death.[43][44] An unidentified officer arrived on the scene and, 73 seconds after Wilson's call, asked where the second suspect was. Thirty-one seconds later, a supervisor was requested by Unit 25. At 12:07 p.m., an officer on scene radioed to dispatch for more units.[32] Also at 12:07, the St. Louis County police were notified and county officers began arriving on scene at around 12:15 p.m. The St. Louis County detectives were notified at 12:43 p.m. and arrived about 1:30 p.m., with the forensic investigator arriving at about 2:30 p.m.[45] Police dispatched 12 units to the scene by 1:00 p.m. with another 12, including two canine units, by 2:00 p.m. Gunshots were recorded in Ferguson police logs at 2:11 p.m., and by the ambulance dispatch again at 2:14 p.m., which led to the response of 20 more units from eight different municipal forces in the next 20 minutes. As the situation deteriorated, the police commanders had investigators seek cover and detectives assisted in crowd control. At 2:45, four canine units arrived on scene, and the SWAT team arrived at 3:20 p.m.[46] The medical examiner began his examination of Brown at approximately 3:30 p.m. and concluded about half an hour later, with Brown's body being cleared to be taken to the morgue.[46][47] At 4:37 p.m., Brown's body was signed in at the morgue by workers.[46] Michael Brown was fatally shot by Officer Wilson at about 12:02 p.m. The Ferguson Police Department was on the scene within minutes, as were crowds of residents, some expressing hostility toward the police. Paramedics covered the body with sheets. About 20 minutes after the shooting, the Ferguson police chief turned over the homicide investigation to the St. Louis County Police Department (SLCPD). The arrival of SLCPD detectives took about 70 minutes, as they were occupied with another crime scene 37 minutes away. On arrival at 1:30 p.m., they put up privacy screens around the body. Their investigation was slowed due to safety concerns regarding the sound of gunfire in the area and some hostile members of the crowd encroaching on the crime scene. An investigator from the St. Louis County Medical Examiner's office arrived at 2:30 p.m. Brown's body was removed at 4:00 p.m.[48] Local residents criticized authorities for leaving Brown's body in the street for four hours in an action seen as demeaning and disrespectful.[46] On August 11, 2014, the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) opened a civil rights investigation into the incident.[49] A spokeswoman for the FBI's St. Louis field office said the decision to open an investigation was not motivated by the protests and riots which had ensued.[50] Forty FBI agents went door-to-door looking for potential witnesses who may have had information about the shooting.[51] Additionally, attorneys from the Civil Rights Division and from the United States Attorney's Office were participating in the investigation.[52] On March 4, 2015, the federal investigation cleared Wilson of civil rights violations in the shooting. The investigation concluded there was no evidence upon which prosecutors could rely to disprove Wilson's asserted belief that he feared for his safety, that witnesses who contradicted Wilson were not credible, that forensic evidence and credible witnesses corroborated Wilson's account, and that the facts did not support the filing of criminal charges against Wilson.[14][53][54] Credible witnesses did not support accounts that Brown had his hands up in surrender. He was not shot in the back. Forensic evidence showed he was moving toward Wilson. Numerous witnesses were found to have given accounts of actions they were unable to see from their vantage points, or to be recounting others' accounts.[14][53][54] A new St. Louis County prosecutor, Wesley Bell, spent five months in 2020 reviewing the case with an eye to charging Wilson with either manslaughter or murder.[55][56] In July, Bell announced he would not charge Wilson with any crime;[57] Bell said he didn't \"have the evidence to ethically bring a charge against Darren Wilson.\"[58] The grand jury was made up of members who had been impaneled in May 2014 for a regularly scheduled term, to hear all cases put forward by the prosecuting attorney's office. There were three black jury members (one man and two women) and nine white jury members (six men and three women), an ethnic breakdown that roughly reflects the racial makeup of St. Louis County,[59] which is about 30% black, and 70% white.[60] On August 20, 2014, the grand jury started hearing evidence in the case State of Missouri v. Darren Wilson, in order to decide whether a crime was committed and if there was probable cause to believe Wilson committed it.[61] There was intense interest focused on the grand jury. Robert P. McCulloch, the elected prosecuting attorney for St. Louis County, was in charge of the prosecution but did not participate in the direct handling of the grand jury hearing.[62][63][64] It was handled by two Assistant Prosecuting Attorneys of McCulloch's office: Kathi Alizadeh and Sheila Whirley.[63] McCulloch announced an unusual process: the grand jury would hear all the evidence, the proceedings would be transcribed, and the materials would be made public if the grand jury did not indict.[65] The grand jury took 25 days, over the span of three months, to hear more than 5,000 pages of testimony from 60 witnesses and then deliberate on whether or not to indict Wilson.[65][66] Most grand juries complete their work in a matter of days.[65] The grand jury was not sequestered during the process.[67] On the night of November 24, Prosecutor McCulloch reported in a 20-minute press conference that the grand jury had reached a decision in the case and would not indict Wilson.[68] Following his announcement, McCulloch released thousands of pages of grand jury documents, with materials published on the internet for public perusal.[69] The documents include transcripts of the proceedings, expert statements, and the testimony of some witnesses.[70] On December 8, more witness interviews and more than 50 brief audio recordings between the police dispatchers and responding police officers were released.[71] On December 13, a third release included the transcripts of witness interviews, including one with Dorian Johnson.[72] A video of the two-hour interview of Johnson by FBI and county police was withheld.[73][74] Robert P. McCulloch was the main focus of much of the criticism throughout the process and well into its aftermath. Attorney Raul Reyes characterized McCulloch as not being impartial, as his father was a police officer killed in an incident with a black suspect and other members of his family served with the St. Louis Police Department.[75] A petition calling for McCulloch to recuse himself gained 70,000 signatures.[76][77][78][79] Governor Jay Nixon declined to remove McCulloch and said doing so would potentially jeopardize the prosecution.[80] McCulloch dismissed the claims of bias, and later said he regretted not speaking publicly about his background at the time.[63][81] Legal analysts raised concerns over McCulloch's unorthodox approach, saying this process could have influenced the grand jury to decide against indictment and that they were given too much material to assess.[82][83] The analysts highlighted the significant differences between a typical grand jury proceeding in Missouri and how Wilson's case was handled.[41] Evidence presented to the grand jury showed that the shooting scene extended approximately 184 feet (56 m) along Canfield Drive, near where it intersects Copper Creek Court. The two-lane street runs east to west, and has sidewalks and curbs on both sides. Immediately prior to the incident, Brown was walking eastbound on Canfield and Officer Wilson was driving westbound. Evidence at the scene was generally clustered around Wilson's patrol SUV on the western side of the scene and near Brown's body, which was in the eastern part of the area. The 30-foot (9.1 m) western area included Wilson's SUV, which was angled slightly toward the right curb with its left-rear corner on the center line. Evidence included two bracelets,[note 1] a baseball cap, and two .40 caliber spent casings. One of these casings was found at the western edge of the scene and the other was located near the rear driver's side of the police vehicle. There were two groups of red stains near the driver's side of the vehicle and a left sandal was also located in the vicinity. The right sandal was approximately 44 feet (13 m) east of the western area. The eastern area, which was approximately 124 feet (38 m) east of the western area, was about 29 feet (8.8 m) wide. Brown's body was situated along the center-line of the road with his head oriented in a westerly direction. The distance from the driver's door of Wilson's SUV to Brown's head was about 153 feet (47 m). Two groups of red stains were located at the extreme eastern edge of the scene, with the furthest under 22 feet (6.7 m) from Brown's feet. One apparent projectile was found near the body. There were ten spent .40-caliber casings scattered on the south side of the road near Brown's body. The distribution of the casings, combined with most of the casings being east of the body, was consistent with Officer Wilson moving backward while firing.[1] Blood spatter approximately 25 feet (7.6 m) behind Brown's body suggested Brown was moving toward Wilson when Brown was killed.[41][86] Brown's DNA was found on Wilson's gun. His DNA was also found on the left thigh of Officer Wilson's pants and on the inside driver's door handle of Wilson's police SUV,[39] the result of Brown's spilled blood staining Wilson's pants and the door handle.[87] Wilson's DNA was found on Brown's left palm but was not found under Brown's fingernails or on his right hand.[39] Michael Graham, the St. Louis medical examiner, said blood was found on Wilson's gun and inside the car, and tissue from Brown was found on the exterior of the driver's side of Wilson's vehicle; this evidence was consistent with a struggle at that location. According to Judy Melinek, a San Francisco pathologist who commented on the case as an expert, the official autopsy, which said Brown's hand had foreign matter consistent with a gun discharge on it, supported Wilson's testimony that Brown was reaching for the weapon,[88] or indicated the gun was inches away from Brown's hand when it went off.[39] According to the detective who performed tests on the gun, he had to decide whether to perform a DNA test or dust for fingerprints, because only one test can be performed without affecting the other.[39] He found the gun stored in an unsealed envelope, contrary to the customary evidence-handling protocol.[89] Documents released after the grand jury proceedings show Wilson washed blood from his hands and checked his own gun into an evidence bag, both actions described by media outlets as unorthodox procedures for such a case.[90][91] Three autopsies[note 2] were performed on Brown's body, with all three noting Brown had been shot at least six times, including twice in the head. He received no shots in his back.[92] The county autopsy report described gunshot entry and exit wounds to Brown's right arm coming from both the front (ventral, palms facing forward) and the back (dorsal, palms facing backward).[93] The local medical examiner autopsy report released to state prosecutors said Brown was shot in the front part of his body. When Mary Case, the St. Louis County medical examiner, was asked to provide details, she declined to comment further, citing the ongoing investigation into Brown's death.[94][95] The official county autopsy was later leaked to the St. Louis Post-Dispatch.[96][88] The narrative report of investigation from the office of the medical examiner of St. Louis agreed with Wilson's testimony.[88] It noted Brown had sustained multiple gunshot wounds to the head, torso, and right arm, as well as a single gunshot wound to the inside of his right hand near his thumb and palm; it also noted Brown's body had abrasions to the right side of his face and on the back of his left hand.[88] The autopsy noted the absence of stippling, powder burns around a wound that indicate a shot was fired at a relatively short range. Michael Graham notes gunshot wounds within an inch of the body do not always cause stippling. Microscopic examination of tissue taken from Brown's thumb wound detected the presence of a foreign material consistent with the material which is ejected from a gun while firing.[88] The gunshot wound to the top of Brown's head was consistent with Brown either falling forward or being in a lunging position; the shot was instantly fatal.[88] A toxicology test performed by a St. Louis University laboratory revealed the presence of THC, the active ingredient in marijuana, in Brown's blood and urine. This indicated he used marijuana within a few hours of his death, but not whether he was impaired when he died.[88] At the request of Brown's family, on August 17 a preliminary autopsy was conducted by Michael Baden, a former chief medical examiner for the City of New York (1978–1979). This autopsy was limited because the previous county autopsy had washed, embalmed, and taken evidence off the body.[97][98][99][100] According to Baden's report, Brown was shot six times into his front: four of the bullets entered his right arm, one entered his right eye on a downward trajectory, and one entered the top of his skull.[9] All of the rounds were fired from a distance of at least one foot.[101] One of the shots shattered Brown's right eye, traveled through his face, then exited his jaw and reentered his collarbone. Brown could have survived the first bullet wounds, but the bullet that entered the top of his head resulted in a fatal injury.[102][9] Baden had no access to the clothing of the victim, and had not yet seen the x-rays showing where bullets were in the body. He could not determine if any gunpowder residue was on that clothing. Baden concluded there was too little information to forensically reconstruct the shooting.[9] At least two commentators noted the results of both autopsies contradicted some aspects of some eyewitness accounts, which had reported Wilson shot Brown in the back[9] and that Wilson shot Brown while holding Brown's neck.[103] In later analysis, Baden reclassified one of Brown's chest wounds as an entry wound.[104] Baden was assisted by Shawn Parcells, who did not have a degree or credentials in medicine or pathology.[105][106] Thomas Young, former Jackson County Medical Examiner, said Parcells gave out forensic pathology opinions when Parcells is not qualified to do so.[105] Mary Case, who performed the initial autopsy, said Parcells' involvement could cause issues with the second autopsy.[107] Parcells said all he did was assist Baden.[107] In 2021, Parcells was convicted of six criminal charges relating to autopsies he illegally performed.[108] Attorney General Eric Holder ordered a third autopsy of Brown's body.[109][110] Its findings matched the other two autopsies, but its detailed findings were initially withheld from the public due to the ongoing investigation.[94][111] The federal autopsy report was among a group of documents released by the St. Louis County Prosecutor's Office on December 8, two weeks after the grand jury chose not to indict Wilson.[111][112] On August 27, CNN released an audio recording purported to contain the sounds of the shooting.[113][114] The recording was made by an anonymous third-party who happened to be recording a video-text message at the time of the incident.[115] Glide, a video messaging service, confirmed the audio had been recorded on their site at 12:02 p.m. on the day of the shooting.[116][117] The twelve-second recording contains a series of shots, a short pause, and then a second series of shots.[115] Forensic audio expert Paul Ginsberg says he heard six shots, a pause, and then four additional shots. Ginsberg said, \"I was very concerned about that pause ... because it's not just the number of gunshots, it's how they're fired. And that has a huge relevance on how this case might finally end up.\"[114] CNN's law enforcement analyst Tom Fuentes noted most accounts of the shooting say there was a single shot earlier in the incident near the vehicle that is not audible in the recording.[118][119] The recording was also analyzed by SST, Inc., a company specializing in gunfire locator technology. That analysis found the sound of ten gunshots and seven gunshot echoes within seven seconds, with a three-second pause after the sixth shot. The company's analysis also said all ten rounds were fired from within a radius of 3 feet (0.91 m), indicating the shooter was not moving.[120] The Washington Post said there were unorthodox forensic practices shown in the published testimony of Officer Wilson and other law enforcement officials. The article said Wilson washed blood off of his hands without photographing them first. It also said Wilson submitted his gun to evidence by himself, and that initial interviews of Wilson were conducted with other personnel present and were not taped. It described Wilson's face injuries after the shooting as photographed by a local detective at the Fraternal Order of Police building, instead of at Ferguson Police headquarters. An investigator with the St. Louis County Medical Examiner's office testified he decided not to take measurements at the crime scene nor did he photograph the scene, instead relying on photographs taken by the St. Louis County Police Department.[121] Multiple witnesses saw part or all of the event and have given interviews to the media, testified to the grand jury, and were interviewed by the U.S. Department of Justice. The witness accounts were conflicting on various points.[94][122][123][124][125][126] David A. Klinger, a criminologist at the University of Missouri–St. Louis, said eyewitness testimony often differs from witness to witness, a phenomenon commonly known as the Rashomon effect.[127] An Associated Press review of the grand jury found numerous problems in the witness testimony, including statements that were \"inconsistent, fabricated, or provably wrong\". Several of the witnesses admitted changing their testimony to fit released evidence, or other witness statements.[128] Prosecuting attorney Robert McCulloch said, \"I thought it was important to present anybody and everybody, and some that were, yes, clearly not telling the truth, no question about it.\"[129] The Department of Justice investigation into the shooting determined witnesses who corroborated Wilson's account were credible while those who contradicted Wilson's account were not. The witnesses that claimed Brown was surrendering or did not move toward Wilson were not credible; the report said their claims were inconsistent with the physical evidence, other witness statements, and in some cases prior statements from the same witness. No witness statements that pointed to Wilson's guilt were determined to be credible. Twenty-four statements were determined to lack any credibility, while eight which were found credible corroborated Wilson's account. Nine did not completely contradict nor corroborate Wilson's account.[53] Several witnesses reported fear of reprisals from the community for providing evidence that corroborated Wilson's account.[53] Officer Wilson gave his account of the incident in an interview with a detective on August 10, and in testimony before the grand jury in September. Wilson said he had just left a call involving a sick person when he heard on his radio that there was a theft in progress at a local convenience store. Wilson heard the description of the suspects and soon after observed two black males walking down the middle of the street. Wilson pulled up to them and told the two to walk on the sidewalk, and Johnson replied, \"we're almost to our destination\". As they passed Wilson's patrol SUV window, Brown said \"fuck what you have to say\".[130] Wilson then backed up about ten feet to where they were[note 3] and attempted to open his door. After backing up, Wilson told the two to \"come here\", and Brown told him in reply, \"what the fuck are you gonna do\". Wilson shut the door and Brown approached him and he opened the door again \"trying to push him back\", while telling him to get back. Brown \"started swinging and punching at me from outside the vehicle\", and Brown had his body against the door. Wilson said the first strike from Brown was a \"glancing blow\", and at that point he was trying to get Brown's arms out of his face. This was when Brown turned to his left and handed Johnson several packs of the stolen cigarillos he had been holding.[130] Wilson then grabbed Brown's right arm trying to get control, but Brown hit him in the face. Wilson said he \"felt like a 5-year-old holding onto Hulk Hogan\" while he attempted to restrain Brown when he reached through his police car window.[25] Wilson said it \"jarred\" him back and he yelled at Brown numerous times to stop and get back. Wilson said he thought about using his mace and his baton, but he was unable to reach either of them. He then drew his weapon and pointed it at Brown and told him to stop or he would shoot him, while ordering him to the ground.[130] According to Wilson, Brown then said \"you're too much of a fucking pussy to shoot me\" and grabbed for his gun and twisted it, pointing it at him, into his hip area. Wilson placed his left hand against Brown's hand and his other hand on the gun and pushed forward with both his arms. The gun was somewhat lined up with Brown, and Wilson pulled the trigger twice, but the weapon failed to discharge. On the next try, the gun fired and Brown then attempted to hit him multiple times inside his vehicle. Wilson shot at Brown again, but missed, and Brown took off running east, while Wilson exited his vehicle and radioed for backup. Wilson followed Brown, yelling for him to stop and get on the ground, but he kept running. Brown eventually stopped and turned and made a \"grunting noise\" and started running at him with his right hand under his shirt in his waistband. Brown ignored Wilson's commands to stop and get on the ground, so Wilson fired multiple shots at him, paused, and yelled at him to get on the ground again, but Brown was still charging at him and had not slowed down. Wilson then fired another set of shots, but Brown was still running at him. When Brown was about eight to ten feet away, Wilson fired more shots, with one of those hitting Brown in the head, which brought him down with his hand still in his waistband. Wilson said two patrol cars showed up approximately fifteen to twenty seconds after the final shot. When his supervisor arrived, he was sent to the police station.[130] Wilson told detectives Brown had reached his right hand into his waistband and that the hand still appeared to be in the waistband after Brown was shot. The medical investigator at the scene of the shooting did not take any photographs and testified to the grand jury that Brown's left hand was under his dead body, near the waistband, and the right hand was extended outwards.[131] On November 26, Wilson gave his first public interview about the shooting to ABC News' George Stephanopoulos.[132] Numerous witness accounts were consistent with Wilson's account and also agreed with the physical evidence at hand. Many witnesses corroborated that Wilson acted in self-defense during the event. A number of the witnesses who corroborated Wilson's account of events expressed fear and apprehension in testifying, saying they had been harassed or threatened by individuals from the Ferguson community.[13]: pp.27–34 The following are a sample of the witnesses whose accounts aligned with Wilson's testimony. Witness 102 was a 27-year-old biracial male. He said he saw Wilson chase Brown until Brown abruptly turned around. Brown did not put his hands up in surrender but made some type of movement similar to pulling his pants up or a shoulder shrug and then made a full charge at Wilson. Witness 102 thought Wilson's life was threatened and he only fired shots when Brown was coming toward him.[13]: pp.27–28 After the shooting, Witness 102 remained in the neighborhood for a short period of time, and corrected a couple of people who claimed Wilson \"stood over [Brown] and shot while [he was] on the ground\". In response, Witness 102 said Wilson shot Brown because Brown came back toward Wilson. Witness 102 \"kept thinking\" Wilson's shots were \"missing\" Brown because Brown kept moving.[13]: p.28 Witness 102 did not stay in the neighborhood for long, and left the area shortly afterward because he felt uncomfortable. According to the witness, \"crowds of people had begun to gather, wrongly claiming the police shot Brown for no reason and that he had his hands up in surrender.” Two black women approached Witness 102, mobile phones set to record, asking him to recount what he had witnessed. Witness 102 responded that they would not like what he had to say. The women responded with racial slurs, calling him names like 'white motherfucker'.\"[13]: p.28 Witness 103, a 58-year-old black male, testified that from his parked truck he saw \"Brown punching Wilson at least three times in the facial area, through the open driver's window of the SUV... Wilson and Brown [had] hold of each other's shirts, but Brown was 'getting in a couple of blows [on Wilson]'.\"[13]: p.29 Wilson was leaning back toward the passenger seat with his forearm up, in an effort to block the blows. Then Witness 103 heard a gunshot and Brown took off running. Wilson exited the SUV, appeared to be using his shoulder microphone to call into his radio, and chased Brown with his gun held low ... Brown came to a stop near a car, put his hand down on the car, and turned around to face Wilson. Brown's hands were then down at his sides. Witness 103 did not see Brown's hands up. Wanting to leave, Witness 103 began to turn his car around in the opposite direction that Brown had been running when he heard additional shots. Witness 103 turned to his right, and saw Brown \"moving fast\" toward Wilson. Witness 103 then drove away.\"[13]: p.29 Witness 104, a 26-year-old biracial female, witnessed the end of the altercation from a minivan: [Witness 104] saw Brown run from the SUV, followed by Wilson, who \"hopped\" out of the SUV and ran after him while yelling \"stop, stop, stop\". Wilson did not fire his gun as Brown ran from him. Brown then turned around and \"for a second\" began to raise his hands as though he may have considered surrendering, but then quickly \"balled up in fists\" in a running position and \"charged\" at Wilson. Witness 104 described it as a \"tackle run\", explaining Brown \"wasn't going to stop\". Wilson fired his gun only as Brown charged at him, backing up as Brown came toward him. Witness 104 explained there were three separate volleys of shots. Each time, Brown ran toward Wilson, Wilson fired, Brown paused, Wilson stopped firing, and then Brown charged again. The pattern continued until Brown fell to the ground, \"smashing\" his face upon impact. Wilson did not fire while Brown momentarily had his hands up. Witness 104 explained it took some time for Wilson to fire, adding that she \"would have fired sooner\". Wilson did not go near Brown's body after Brown fell to his death.[13]: p.30 Witness 108, a 74-year-old black male, told detectives the police officer was \"in the right\" and \"did what he had to do\", and that statements made by people in the apartment complex about Brown surrendering were inaccurate. Witness 108 later told investigators he \"would have fucking shot that boy, too\", and mimicked the aggressive stance Brown made while charging Wilson. He explained Wilson told Brown to \"stop\" or \"get down\" at least ten times, but instead Brown \"charged\" at Wilson. Witness 108 also told detectives there were other witnesses on Canfield Drive who saw what he saw.[13]: p.32 Witness 109, a 53-year-old black male, said he decided to come forward after seeing Dorian Johnson \"lie\" about the events on television.[13]: p.32 He said when Wilson asked the two boys to get out of the street, Brown responded something to the effect of \"Fuck the police.\" Afterward, Wilson got out of his car and Brown hit him in the face. Witness 109 said he saw Wilson reach for his taser but dropped it and then grabbed a gun, after which Brown grabbed for Wilson's gun. According to 109, at one point Brown ran away from Wilson, but turned around and charged toward the officer. He said Wilson fired in self-defense, and did not appear to be shooting to kill at first.[13]: p.33 Witness 113, a 31-year-old black female, made statements that corroborated Wilson's account. She said she was afraid of the \"neighborhood backlash\" that might come from her testimony, and feared offering an account contrary to the narrative reported by the media that Brown held his hands up in surrender.[13]: pp.33–34 She also told investigators she thought Wilson's life was in danger. Witness 136 was in his apartment using a video chat application on his mobile phone while the shooting occurred. After hearing the first few shots, he recorded the remainder of his chat on his phone and turned it over to the FBI. The recording is about 12 seconds long and captured a total of 10 gunshots. The gunshots begin after the first four seconds. The recording captured six gunshots in two seconds. After a three-second pause, a seventh gunshot is heard. A pause of less than one second gave way to the final three-shot volley within two seconds. The recording was not time-stamped. As detailed below, this recording is consistent with several credible witness accounts as well as Wilson's account, that he fired several volleys of shots, briefly pausing between each one.[13]: pp.24–25 Several witnesses who originally testified against Wilson were also interviewed by the prosecution. They admitted to lying under oath as to the truthfulness of their testimony.[133][134] At least one witness took an account from a newspaper; this witness was later discredited by investigators during the process.[134] Witness 22, who originally claimed she saw Wilson kill Brown in cold blood, admitted she lied to investigators and never saw the incident at all. She said she was just passing along information which her boyfriend told her he saw.[133][135][136] The court transcript reads: Prosecution: You gave two statements, were both of those statements true? Witness 22: No. I just felt like I want to be part of something... I didn't see what I told the FBI what [sic] I saw. Prosecutors also played the grand jury a 10-minute police interview with a man who claimed to have witnessed the shooting. They then played a phone call in which that man admitted he actually had not seen the incident at all.[135] Another witness insisted another officer was with Wilson at the time of the shooting. By all other accounts, Wilson was the only officer present when he shot Brown. This witness described having a clear view of what transpired despite there being a building between the witness' location and where the incident took place.[135] Witness 35 said Brown was \"on his knees\" when Wilson shot him in the head. Under questioning, his testimony fell apart, and he admitted fabricating it.[135] Prosecution: What you are saying you saw isn't forensically possible based on the evidence. Are you telling us that the only thing that's true about all of your statements before this is that you saw that police officer shoot him at point blank range? Witness 35: Yes.[135] Another witness described Brown on his hands and knees pleading for his life. After a prosecutor confronted the witness and told them what they had seen was not forensically possible based on the evidence, the witness later asked to leave.[135] Another witness—number 37—testified that, during a confrontation at Wilson's vehicle, Wilson shot Brown point blank in the chest—but Brown did not fall over and was not clearly bleeding as he ran away. This witness gave several different accounts of how many shots were fired. While he was further pressed for answers as to the truthfulness of his statements, he instead posed questions in return, refusing to elaborate on his statements. Prosecution: You told three different stories in the time we've been here today. So I want to know which one is really your memory or did you see this at all? Witness 37: If none of my stuff is making any sense, like why do y'all keep contacting me?[135] Johnson, a friend of Brown, who was with him that day, gave his account of the incident to media outlets in August. In media interviews, Johnson said Wilson pulled up beside them and said, \"Get the fuck on the sidewalk.\"[137][138][139] The young men replied they were \"not but a minute away from [their] destination, and [they] would shortly be out of the street\".[139][note 4] Wilson drove forward without saying anything further and abruptly backed up, positioning his vehicle crosswise in their path. Wilson then allegedly tried to open his door aggressively and the door ricocheted off Brown and Johnson's bodies and closed back on Wilson.[40] Wilson, still in his vehicle, purportedly grabbed Brown around his neck using his left hand[13] through the open window, and Brown tried to pull away, but Wilson is said to have continued to pull Brown toward him \"like tug of war\".[125][142] Johnson noted that Brown had the upper hand over Wilson owing to his position relative to the seated Wilson, his size advantage and because Wilson was only grabbing him with one hand.[13] Johnson said Brown \"did not reach for the officer's weapon at all\", and was attempting to get free, when Wilson drew his weapon and said, \"I'll shoot you\" or \"I'm going to shoot\", and fired his weapon hitting Brown.[138][143][144][145][146] Following the initial gunshot, Brown freed himself, and the two are said to have fled. Wilson exited the vehicle, and allegedly fired several rounds at the fleeing Brown, hitting him once in the back.[40][139] Johnson said Brown then turned around with his hands raised and said, \"I don't have a gun. Stop shooting!\" Wilson is said to have then shot Brown several more times, killing him.[40][147] In his testimony in September to the grand jury, Johnson said he and Brown had walked to a convenience store to buy cigarillos, but Brown instead reached over the counter and took them and shoved a clerk on his way out the door.[148] Johnson testified that on their walk back home, Brown had the cigarillos in his hands in plain sight and two Ferguson police cars passed them, but did not stop.[148] When Wilson encountered them, he told the two to \"get the fuck on the sidewalk\" and Johnson told him they would be off the street shortly as they were close to their destination.[149] Johnson testified Wilson was the aggressor from the beginning and that for no apparent reason, he backed his vehicle up and tried to open his door, but Brown shut it, preventing him from getting out.[149] Johnson said Wilson then reached out and grabbed Brown by the neck and the two were engaged in a \"tug of war\", Wilson's left hand progressively slipping from Brown's neck to his right arm.[13] Brown braced himself on the vehicle's door with his left arm, which Johnson believed Wilson may have grabbed with his right arm at one point.[13] Wilson drew his gun with his right hand[13] and said \"I'll shoot\". Johnson said he never saw Brown hit Wilson and did not think Brown grabbed for Wilson's gun,[149][150] although he admitted the possibility that Brown's left arm could have been inside the vehicle while Johnson wasn't looking.[13] Following a gunshot, Johnson said they both ran[note 5] and Wilson fired while Brown was running away, Brown turned around and \"at that time Big Mike's hands was up, but not so much in the air, because he had been struck\".[150] Johnson told the jurors Brown said \"I don't have a gun\", was mad and tried to say again \"I don't have a gun\", but \"before he can say the second sentence or before he can even get it out, that's when the several more shots came.\" In his testimony, Johnson maintained Brown did not run at Wilson prior to the fatal shots.[150] The Department of Justice concluded that Johnson's testimony was not credible due to its inconsistencies with evidence, internal inconsistencies and lack of corroboration by credible witness accounts. The DOJ was also skeptical that Johnson would have been in a position to witness the final shots, and believed that Johnson may have fled the scene prior or had his back to the shooting while seeking cover.[13] Nine witness testimonies were judged by the Department of Justice as neither fully supportive nor inculpating of Wilson.[13]: pp.36–43 One, that of witness 107, who was seated in the same minivan as witness 104, reported that Wilson was standing outside the passenger side of his vehicle at the time that Brown started to run away.[note 1] Unlike witness 104, witness 107 was uncertain whether Brown subsequently charged at Wilson. Witness 107 reported that Wilson shot Brown while Brown was running away, and that the last shots were fired while Wilson was 10 to 15 feet away from Brown. The investigators reported that witness 107 was visibly shaken at what she had witnessed, which may have contributed to inconsistencies in her testimony.[13] Witness 106, the driver of the minivan, disagreed with witness 107 that Brown had put his hands up before moving toward Wilson. Brown's gesture was instead characterized by this witness as Brown having \"briefly flung\" out his arms. However, the view witness 106 had of Brown was partially obstructed by Wilson's body.[13] Witnesses 110 and 111 were interviewed on the evening of the incident and were shaken; witness 111 was crying. Witnesses 110 and 111 both witnessed the shooting, first from a driveway and then a balcony. They had passed Brown and Johnson walking on the street while in a vehicle en route to the house. They saw Wilson backing his vehicle up to block Brown and Johnson, but could not see what went on in the vehicle because they were watching from the passenger side. Johnson disappeared at the first shot, and Brown and Wilson continued to grapple until a second shot was fired and Brown ran away. Witness 110 observed Brown stopping, looking at his bloodied left hand, putting his arms out to his sides in a \"what the heck\" gesture and turning and going toward Wilson with his hands in the same posture. Witness 110 initially stated that Brown moved \"quickly\" back toward Wilson, though witness 110 later denied that Brown had been charging or running at Wilson to the grand jury and could not provide a characterization of Brown's movement. According to witness 111, it seemed that Brown was moving \"in slow motion\" toward Wilson.[13] Witness 115 recorded on their cell phone video of the incident that \"dude [Brown] was all up in his [Wilson's] car, dude [Brown] was punching on him.\" Witness 115 believed that Brown was winning in the fight, and from the vantage point of witness 115, was likely striking Wilson. There was a gap in witness 115's testimony as the shooting stopped, witness 115 went out onto their balcony, then went back inside to retrieve the phone, which they inadvertently left on their dresser, called out to family members and reemerged on the balcony. At this point, they saw Brown, whose arms were folded on his stomach,[note 6] walking back toward Wilson. Brown was reportedly not surrendering and did not have his hands up, but was falling to the ground as he approached Wilson. Wilson fired a series of shots, and Brown fell to the ground over one arm, with the other at his side. Wilson did not touch Brown's body and was speaking on a radio with his gun drawn.[13] Witness 114 saw Wilson stop his vehicle and lean out of the driver's window, perhaps to say something to Brown. Brown made a hand gesture. Wilson's vehicle continued on initially, but then was jerked back and parked at an angle. Witness 129 stated that this was to cut off Brown and Johnson.[13] Witness 116 looked out their blinds in response to screams. They saw Brown with his hands inside Wilson's vehicle. Witness 116 reported seeing Wilson use what they thought was a taser, but miss.[note 7] They then heard or saw Wilson fire a gun once or twice. Witness 116 saw Brown run away, and assumed that he had been apprehended. However, after hearing five or six additional gunshots, they looked out again to see Brown dead on the ground.[13] Witness 110 and 141 reported that Wilson only shot at Brown while Brown moved toward him, not while Brown was fleeing.[13] The DOJ concluded that they had identified no testimony that could inculpate Wilson that was consistent with other inculpating witness testimony, consistent with the prior statements of the witness and with the physical evidence.[13]: p.36 Peaceful protests and civil disorder broke out the day following Brown's shooting and lasted for several days. This was in part due to the belief among many that Brown was surrendering, as well as longstanding racial tensions between the minority-black population and the majority-white city government and police.[151] As the details of the original shooting event emerged from investigators, police grappled with establishing curfews and maintaining order, while members of the Ferguson community demonstrated in various ways in the vicinity of the original shooting. On August 10, a day of memorials began peacefully, but some crowd members became unruly after an evening candlelight vigil.[152] Local police stations assembled approximately 150 officers in riot gear.[153] Some people began looting businesses, vandalizing vehicles, and confronting police officers who sought to block off access to several areas of the city.[152] Widespread media coverage examined the post-9/11 trend of local police departments arming themselves with military-grade weapons when dealing with protests.[154][155] In the days following the shooting, state and federal officials weighed in on the matter. On August 12, President Barack Obama offered his condolences to Brown's family and community.[156] On August 14, Senator Rand Paul of Kentucky said in an op-ed in Time Magazine, that the event was a tragedy and that police forces need to be demilitarized.[157] On August 15, a report and video showing the robbery of a convenience store by Brown was released by the Ferguson Police Department. Brown was accompanied by his friend Dorian Johnson. The report and video were part of a packet that included information about the shooting afterward.[158][159][160] The report containing frames of the surveillance footage showed Brown grabbing a box of cigarillos, followed by an apparent struggle or confrontation between Brown and a store clerk.[161][162] The statutory deadline in the Sunshine Law, Missouri's equivalent of the federal Freedom of Information Act, was the cited reason for the release following requests by St. Louis Post-Dispatch, Judicial Watch and others.[163][164][165] The Department of Justice had urged the video not be released, saying a release would inflame tension.[166] Missouri Governor Jay Nixon identified the release as an attempt to disparage Brown during the investigation that would inflame the community.[167][168] Brown's family released a statement in which they condemn the way the police chief chose to disseminate information, calling it character assassination following the \"execution-style murder\" of their son.[169] The August 15 release of information was criticized as part of an erratic and infrequent release of information by the police.[170] Previously, the police withheld the name of the officer involved in the shooting, citing safety concerns following death threats against the unnamed officer.[158] The St Louis County Police incident report lacked details.[171] The Ferguson Police incident report was obtained by the ACLU after a request and subsequent lawsuit.[172] Wilson did not file an incident report[171] and there was no Ferguson Police use-of-force report related to the incident.[173] The Ferguson Police Department refused to commit to a deadline for releasing a full autopsy report.[147] When the report and video were released, the police said Wilson had known Brown was a suspect in the robbery.[174] In a media conference, Ferguson's chief of police Tom Jackson said the robbery was unrelated to the initial contact, and had nothing to do with Wilson stopping Brown and Johnson.[158][174] Jackson later clarified Wilson recognized Brown as a suspect because he saw a box of cigars in his hand.[37][175] Eugene O'Donnell, a former district attorney in New York City who now serves as a professor at the John Jay College of Criminal Justice, said, while the police officer may have stopped Brown for jaywalking, Brown may have been thinking the officer knew about the robbery: \"Obviously the cop's reaction is not affected, but what could be affected is [Brown's] reaction to the cop.\"[176] A Pew Research Center Survey published on August 18 suggested differences in American public opinion between whites and blacks. It indicated 80% of blacks and 37% of whites believed the shooting \"raises important issues about race\".[177] On August 24, St. Louis held their annual Peace Fest, which had a particular focus on Mike Brown. In attendance was Mike Brown's father, Mike Brown Sr., as well as the parents of Trayvon Martin (an unarmed black teen who was shot and killed in Florida in 2012).[178] In August, Chief Jackson said Wilson had been injured in the incident.[179] Wilson's medical record shows his injuries were diagnosed as a facial contusion or bruise.[180] Brown's funeral was held on August 25 and was attended by an estimated 4,500 people.[181][182] Al Sharpton delivered one of two eulogies.[183][184] On October 22, anonymous sources leaked to the St. Louis Post-Dispatch what they described as Wilson's grand jury testimony.[185] The Justice Department issued a statement that it \"considers the selective release of information in this investigation to be irresponsible and highly troubling. Since the release of the convenience-store footage, there seems to be an inappropriate effort to influence public opinion about this case.\"[185] Wilson's defense team denied they were behind the leaks, saying they \"[were] not in possession of any of the disclosed reports or the investigative report\".[185] The St. Louis County prosecutor spokesperson said his office would not investigate the leaks because they could not force journalists to divulge their sources, and \"you can tell by the information they have that the leaks are not coming from the grand jury or the prosecutor's office.\"[186] The leaks concerning grand jury testimony were condemned by the Justice Department as inappropriate effort to influence public opinion about this case.[185] The leaks referred to evidence supporting Wilson's testimony and decreased the likelihood of an indictment whilst fanning the flames of angry protesters.[187] Following the grand jury announcement, protests, some of them violent, broke out in Ferguson and other cities across the United States. Several Ferguson businesses were looted and fires set by protesters. Protests erupted in 170 cities across the U.S., including[188] St Louis, Philadelphia, Seattle, Albuquerque, New York City, Cleveland, Los Angeles, Oakland, Minneapolis, Atlanta, Chicago, and Boston.[189] Numerous media reports and legal experts criticized the process for failing to return an indictment in cases concerning law enforcement officers.[190][191] A December 2014 opinion poll by Washington Post-ABC News showed a majority of blacks do not believe that they receive treatment equal to whites by the police or the criminal justice system. Six out of ten white Americans believe the police treat races equally with roughly half of white Americans believing the criminal justice provides equal treatment, but there is a sharp partisan divide between white Americans. Conservative or Republican white Americans are far more likely to say whites and blacks receive equal treatment in the justice system than the liberal or Democratic white Americans.[192][note 8] On March 4, the U.S. Department of Justice announced Wilson would not be charged in the shooting. Its report said \"[t]here is no evidence upon which prosecutors can rely to disprove Wilson's stated subjective belief that he feared for his safety,\" and that accounts that Brown put his hands up are \"inaccurate because they are inconsistent with the physical and forensic evidence\".[193] President Obama reacted to the announcement, stating, \"The finding that was made [by the Department of Justice] was that it was not unreasonable to determine that there was not sufficient evidence to charge Officer Wilson. That was an objective, thorough, independent federal investigation.\" He further added, \"We may never know exactly what happened. But Officer Wilson like anybody else who is charged with a crime benefits from due process and a reasonable doubt standard.\"[194] In a Gallup Poll taken in June and July 2015, 8% of black respondents answered that local police treat racial minorities \"very fairly\" while 44% of black respondents answered \"fairly\". In contrast, 29% of non-Hispanic white respondents answered that local police treat racial minorities \"very fairly\" while 49% of non-Hispanic white respondents answered \"fairly\". In the same poll, 38% of black respondents and 18% of non-Hispanic white respondents indicated a preference for \"greater police presence in their local communities.\"[195][196] Various heads of state and foreign news organizations have commented on the shooting and subsequent protests including the Chinese Xinhua News Agency, Germany's Der Spiegel,[197] Egypt's Ministry of Foreign affairs,[198] the Iranian Islamic Republic News Agency,[197] protesters throughout the Middle East,[199] the Russian Foreign Ministry,[197] Spain's El Mundo,[200] the British Metro,[201] and others.[197] Amnesty International (AI) sent a team of human rights observers, trainers, and researchers to Ferguson. It was the first time the organization deployed such a team in the United States.[202][203] In a press release, AI USA director Steven W. Hawkins said, \"The U.S. cannot continue to allow those obligated and duty-bound to protect to become those who their community fears most.\"[204][205] On October 24, AI published a report declaring human rights abuses in Ferguson. The report cited the use of lethal force in Brown's death, racial discrimination and excessive use of police force, imposition of restrictions on the rights to protest, intimidation of protesters, the use of tear gas, rubber bullets, and long range acoustic devices, restrictions imposed on the media covering the protests, and lack of accountability for law enforcement policing protests.[206][207] The grand jury process was atypical because of significant and numerous departures from other normal grand jury proceedings. The American grand jury process operates in secret, with the proceedings, evidence and testimony rarely being released to the public in cases of no indictment. From the beginning, McCulloch desired to provide transparency to the process and had the proceeding transcribed with the intention of releasing the materials to the public if there was no indictment. Paul Cassell, former U.S. federal judge, said the investigative grand jury was unique because they were investigating with no assurance that any criminal conduct was present, in contrast to normal grand jury proceedings which have been screened for probable cause by a prosecutor. McCulloch's intentions to present all the evidence resulted in the proceedings which took far longer than regular grand juries which decide within days.[65] Earlier in the hearing, the prosecution presented a 1979 Missouri statute allowing officers to use deadly force \"to effect the arrest or prevent the escape from custody [of a person]\". Before the grand jury deliberated, jurors were told to disregard the previous instructions and use case law from the Tennessee v Garner ruling, which said it was unconstitutional for police officers to use deadly force to apprehend non-dangerous fleeing suspects.[208] Missouri Attorney General Chris Koster, acknowledged the grand jury was given information based on the state law before being informed that deadly force cannot be used merely to prevent the escape of an unarmed suspect.[208][209] MSNBC's Lawrence O'Donnell argued that this change amounted to a deliberate attempt by the prosecution to make it impossible to indict Wilson.[209] Andrew F. Branca, a Massachusetts lawyer focusing on self-defense law, attributed O'Donnell's comments as a straw man because self-defense is a completely independent and sufficient justification for the use of deadly force.[210] The St. Louis Public Radio later clarified that even if Wilson was indicted and convicted at trial based on the Garner ruling, the conviction could be challenged on the basis that Missouri law permitted the use of deadly force.[208] The prosecution's handling of the case received particular attention. Roger Parloff said prosecutors do not usually exclude truly exculpatory evidence and that prosecutors do not typically indict if they believe the accused is not guilty, disagreeing with the notion that McCulloch should have presented evidence with the purpose of obtaining an indictment.[211] Jay Sterling Silver said the grand jury case indicated a conflict of interest between local prosecutors and police, as the former needs to maintain a good relationship with law enforcement.[212] Mark O'Mara said the unusual process was to avoid arguments that the presentation was to effect a particular result, yet despite this McCulloch was still criticized for the decision. Paul Callan, former deputy chief of homicide in the Brooklyn District Attorney's Office, gave a layered response which asserted the choice to present all the evidence was unusual, but not unprecedented in controversial cases. Callan said some prosecutors use the grand jury process as political cover in cases which would not succeed at trial, and in cases in which subsequent investigations and civil lawsuits would raise further criticism.[135] William Fitzpatrick, of the National District Attorneys Association, said it was not strange for prosecutors in police-involved cases to provide all available evidence and not ask for a specific charge and defended McCulloch's inclusion of evidence.[83] Jeffrey Toobin agreed the exoneration may have been well-justified because a conviction would have been very unlikely at a trial, but the process that was used does not inspire confidence in the legal system.[135] In a later interview, McCulloch defended the choice to include all evidence and not skew the presentation just for the sake of getting an indictment.[81] The New York Times described prosecutors' questioning of Wilson as \"gentle\" and said it contrasted with the sharp challenges to witnesses whose accounts seemed to contradict Wilson's, and reported this had led some to question whether the process was as objective as McCulloch had claimed. The Times reported prosecutors asked witness after witness if Brown appeared to be reaching for a weapon when confronting Wilson, though few of them said this. Furthermore, contradictions in testimony by Wilson and other law-enforcement officers were left unchallenged by prosecutors.[86] CNN legal analyst Sunny Hostin criticized the prosecutors for asking softball questions during the cross examination of Wilson's testimony, and referred particularly to the fact that no witness could corroborate Wilson's story that he had warned Brown twice to lie down on the ground, and when asked, witnesses said they did not hear him say that.[213] After the grand jury's decision was announced, Brown's stepfather, Louis Head, turned to a crowd of demonstrators who had gathered, and yelled \"Burn this bitch down\", according to a New York Times video.[214] Moments before, he had said \"If I get up [on the platform] I'm gonna start a riot.\"[215] He later apologized for the outburst.[216] By September 24, Ferguson Police Chief Thomas Jackson publicly apologized to the family of Michael Brown.[217] By March 12, five months later, Thomas Jackson resigned from the Ferguson Police Department.[218] On November 29, Wilson resigned from the Ferguson police force with no severance, citing security concerns.[219][220] Wilson's lawyer said Wilson \"will never be a police officer again\" as he does not want to put other officers at risk due to his presence.[221] The National Bar Association, an organization of African American lawyers and judges, made a complaint to the Missouri Department of Public Safety demanding Wilson's police officer license be revoked.[222] Wilson's attempts to obtain employment as a police officer have been unsuccessful.[223] President Barack Obama announced the federal government would spend $75 million on body cameras for law enforcement officers, as one of the measures taken in response to the shooting.[224][225] According to the Associated Press' annual poll of United States news directors and editors, the top news story of 2014 was police killings of unarmed black people—including the shooting of Brown—as well as their investigations and the protests in their aftermath.[226][227] Roger Goldman, emeritus professor at Saint Louis University Law School, Flanders, a Saint Louis University law professor, and Senator Jamilah Nasheed seek the updating of Missouri state law to comply with the 1985 U.S. Supreme Court decision, Tennessee v. Garner.[208] The cover of The New Yorker's January 26, 2015, issue depicted Martin Luther King Jr. linking arms with Eric Garner and Wenjian Liu, and joined by Trayvon Martin and Brown.[228] Funds for the Brown family and for Wilson were solicited on the internet,[229][230] each accumulating hundreds of thousands of dollars in donations.[231] In August 2018, Prosecuting Attorney Bob McCulloch lost re-election to reformist Wesley Bell by double-digit margins, ending McCulloch's 28-year incumbency.[232] The QuikTrip where Michael Brown had a confrontation with a clerk (which led to the police call)[233] was looted and burned the next day,[234] along with other stores in the neighborhood. Rather than rebuilding, the corporation donated the site to the Urban League of Metropolitan St. Louis and the Salvation Army. The organizations built the Ferguson Community Empowerment Center on the site, which opened in 2017.[234] The Urban League began suburban street outreach for the first time, and is also redeveloping other vacant lots.[233] The Ferguson effect is an increase in violent crime rates in a community caused by reduced proactive policing due to the community's distrust and hostility towards police.[235] The Ferguson effect was first proposed after police saw an increase in violence following the shooting of Brown in Ferguson, Missouri. The term was coined by Doyle Sam Dotson III, the chief of the St. Louis police, to account for an increased murder rate in some U.S. cities following the Ferguson unrest.[236] \"Hands up, don't shoot\", or simply \"hands up\", is a slogan and gesture originating from the incident and was seen in demonstrations in Ferguson and throughout the United States.[237] The gesture became a rallying cry against police violence.[238][239][240] On March 4, 2015, the U.S. Department of Justice issued a report on the shooting,[13] which said, \"There is no witness who has stated that Brown had his hands up in surrender whose statement is otherwise consistent with the physical evidence\" and \"our investigation did not reveal any eyewitness who stated that Brown said 'don't shoot'.\"[241][242] On December 20, two NYPD officers were shot and killed in their police car in Bedford–Stuyvesant, Brooklyn. The suspected gunman, Ismaaiyl Brinsley, posted days earlier on Instagram his intention to kill police officers in response to the killings of Brown and Eric Garner.[243] The suspect, who had a long criminal record and had shot his girlfriend in the stomach a few hours earlier, entered the New York City Subway and committed suicide.[244][245][246] On March 12, 2015, two police officers were wounded by gunfire outside the Ferguson police headquarters. The officers, one from nearby Webster Groves, the other from the St. Louis County Police, were providing security at a protest being staged outside the station.[247] Two days later, 20-year-old Jeffrey L. Williams was arrested in connection with the shooting.[248] Williams' attorney said, although Williams fired the shots, he was not aiming at the officers.[249] Eighteen-year-old Tyrone Harris (friend of Brown) was shot by police in Ferguson on August 9, 2015, one year after the shooting of Michael Brown.[250][251] That same day, the Columbia (Missouri) Police Officers' Association (CPOA) proclaimed \"Darren Wilson Day\", calling Wilson an \"innocent, but persecuted, officer\" and insisted his ethnicity had nothing to do with their support of him.[252] An ABC affiliate reported the post was shared nearly 60 times on the site before being removed. The CPOA then posted its support for Wilson and \"all law enforcement officers who endure similar situations.\"[253] In December 2014, president Barack Obama created a commission to make recommendations for broad police reform in the United States. The commission created by Obama released an interim report on March 2, 2015, with numerous recommendations, including the recommendation that policy be created mandating \"external and independent criminal investigations in cases of police use of force resulting in death, officer-involved shootings resulting in injury or death, or in-custody deaths\".[254] On September 5, 2014, the U.S. Department of Justice began an investigation of the Ferguson, Missouri, police force to examine whether officers routinely engaged in racial profiling or showed a pattern of excessive force. The investigation was separate from the Department's other investigation of the shooting of Brown.[255] The results of the investigation were released in a March 4, 2015, report, which concluded officers in Ferguson routinely violated the constitutional rights of the city's residents, by discriminating against African Americans and applying racial stereotypes, in a \"pattern or practice of unlawful conduct within the Ferguson Police Department that violates the First, Fourth, and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution, and federal statutory law.\"[256][257] The report focused on the problem of issuing warrants for sometimes minor offenses. In many states, a chief cause for warrants is unpaid traffic tickets.[258] On April 23, 2015, the Brown family filed a wrongful death lawsuit in state court against Wilson, Jackson, and the City of Ferguson, asking for damages in excess of $75,000 as well as attorney's fees.[259][260] On May 27, 2015, the lawsuit was moved from state court to federal court.[261] On July 14, 2015, U.S. District Judge E. Richard Webber responded to defense motions by dismissing four of the seven counts of the lawsuit and declining to dismiss two other counts.[262][263] On June 20, 2017, Webber approved a settlement between Brown's parents and the city of Ferguson. Terms of the agreement, including the settlement amount, were sealed from the public.[264][265] A Ferguson city attorney revealed the city's insurance company paid $1.5 million.[266] On April 29, 2015, Johnson filed a lawsuit in state court against Wilson, Jackson, and the City of Ferguson for being stopped by Wilson without probable cause, reasonable suspicion or legal justification to detain him. The lawsuit claimed that, according to the findings of the § DOJ investigation into the Ferguson Police Department, law enforcement efforts focused on generating revenue rather than protecting the town's citizens. Johnson sought US$25,000 in damages.[267][268][269] On May 27, 2015, the lawsuit was moved from state court to federal court.[270] The court denied the defendants' motion to dismiss the case; they appealed, and a three-judge panel of the Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed the district court on July 25, 2017,[271] allowing the lawsuit to go forward. The en banc Eighth Circuit reviewed and reversed the panel's decision on June 17, 2019, directing the district court to dismiss the case.[272] On May 9, 2016, Delrish Moss, a Miami law enforcement veteran and expert in community relations,[273] was sworn in as the first permanent African American chief in Ferguson. He said his challenges would include diversifying the police force and dramatically improving community relations.[274] Moss resigned and returned to Miami in October 2018. In 2023, Troy Doyle became the new police chief. According to Doyle, as a teenager growing up in northern St. Louis County, he was pulled over so many times on his commute that he bought a radar detector to avoid police. He says while he was stopped in a parking lot, a police officer pulled up and demanded identification for no apparent reason, noticed the radar detector, and took it without compensation after falsely stating it had shown up as stolen. Doyle says the incident is what inspired him to public service.[233] The police department went from having three African-American officers in 2014 to roughly half in 2024, with only four officers still on board who had been serving at the time of the Brown shooting.[233] On April 25, 2018, Brown's mother, Lezley McSpadden, announced to a Harvard University forum on police violence that she would run for City Council of Ferguson.[275] She did not win.[276] The same month Brown was shot dead, American rappers The Game, Rick Ross, 2 Chainz, Diddy, Fabolous, Wale, DJ Khaled, Swizz Beatz, Yo Gotti, Curren$y, Problem, King Pharoah and recording group TGT released the song \"Don't Shoot\" as a tribute to Brown.[277] On De L'Amour — his final studio album released before his death in 2017 — the French rock and roll singer Johnny Hallyday sings \"Dans la peau de Mike Brown\", a song against racial crimes and in memory of Mike Brown.[278] On November 28, 2014, musician and filmmaker Richard Rossi was in the news regarding the controversy over the shooting of Michael Brown. Rossi wrote and recorded a protest song expressing his feelings about a grand jury's decision not to charge a white police officer in the death of the unarmed black teen in Ferguson, Missouri. \"I wrote the song in five minutes as a way to express my emotions about the danger of trigger-happy police,\" Rossi said. \"I filmed it on my laptop at my kitchen table and uploaded it to YouTube.\" Rossi uploaded the video on November 26, and provided the song's lyrics in the video description. Here is a sample from the song's beginning, printed in the Los Angeles Daily News: \"Down at the courthouse on a Monday afternoon/Justice was thrown right out the window when a young white cop entered the room.\"[279] In Prince's song about the 2015 Baltimore protests, \"Baltimore\", he sings \"does anybody hear us pray for Michael Brown or Freddie Gray?\".[280][281] In 2015, actor Ezra Miller directed a short film titled The Truth According to Darren Wilson. In the film, Wilson recounts his version of events, ending in him being called into a room to tell it to investigators, implying that Wilson unlawfully murdered Brown, and that he later lied about the events of that day.[282][283] Brown's death is the subject of the song \"What It Means\" by Drive-By Truckers on their 2016 album American Band.[284][285] Iconographer Mark Dukes created the icon Our Lady of Ferguson in response to the shooting.[286] Poet Danez Smith published a poem entitled \"not an Elegy for Mike Brown\", written the night of the incident.[287][288] Seattle based rapper Macklemore mentions Wilson in the song \"White Privilege II\" from his second collaborative effort with producer Ryan Lewis, 2016's This Unruly Mess I've Made: \"My success is the product of the same system that let off Darren Wilson – guilty\"[289] In 2016, a chapter about Black Lives Matter memorials to Brown and others was included in the book, \"The Sustainers: Being, Building and Doing Good through the Sacred Spaces of Civil Rights, Human Rights and Social Movements,\" by preservationist Catherine Fleming Bruce. The book won the 2017 University of Mary Washington Historic Preservation Book Prize.[290] English folk singer Reg Meuross included a song called \"The Lonesome Death of Michael Brown\" on his 2017 album Faraway People.[291] The song's title acknowledges Bob Dylan's song against racism in the 1960s, \"The Lonesome Death of Hattie Carroll\", which describes the death in Baltimore of a bartender at the hands of a drunk patron, who struck her with a cane causing her to die of a brain hemorrhage. Poet Nicole Sealey wrote The Ferguson Report: An Erasure, a book length erasure[292] of the Ferguson Report [293] which comments on the Killing of Michael Brown and the subsequent Ferguson unrest. Her poem \"Pages 22–29\", an excerpt from the book, won a Forward Prize for Poetry in October 2021.[294]",

On Friday, ESPN's Shams Charania first reported that the Kings were moving on from head coach Mike Brown less than 24 hours after the Kings' 114-113 home loss to the Detroit Pistons. Sacramento has had a tough start to the season as they're in the middle of a 5-game losing streak and sit at 13-16 overall, including a 6-12 record at home. But Brown is coming off two straight winning season including a Coach of the Year performance (his second) in the 2022-23 season, his first with the Kings. That year also marked the end of a 16-season NBA Playoffs drought. Here's everything you need to know about the Kings' decision to fire Brown. Although it's early in the season, the Kings' disastrous start to the 2024-25 season left ownership searching for answers, especially of late. Sacramento started out the season consistently staying above -.500 until mid-November. The Kings fell to 9-12 on Dec. 1, and lost six out of their last 10 games. Currently, Sacramento is 13-18 and 12th in the Western Conference. According to various reports, Sacramento's home record may be a big reason. Say what you want about Vivek, he just ate 30 plus million to try and right the ship.Mike Brown may in fact be the unnecessary scapegoat, but you don’t lose games like that at home with these expectations and survive.You knew it was coming, and you pretty much knew if they… Sacramento lost 114-113 to the Pistons the night before Brown was fired. As Detriot trailed by three, Jaden Ivey hit a three-pointer and was fouled by Kings guard De'Aaron Fox. Ivey hit the free throw to give Detroit the win, capping off a 19-point rally in the second half. After the game, Brown appeared to call out Fox postgame, albeit not by name: Mike Brown got himself fired after he threw De'Aaron Fox under the bus after the loss last night. pic.twitter.com/FJOZPko6DL On Friday, this video of Brown and Fox made the rounds on social media and had many speculating this was the two saying goodbye, which was apparently taken shortly before Brown's firing: This moment between Kings head coach Mike Brown and De'Aaron Fox at today's practice will certainly be dissected and analyzed. pic.twitter.com/x6dYwZ1zf8 The Kings opened the season with +3500 odds to win the NBA Championship. But with stars like Fox, DeMar DeRozan and Domantas Sabonis, the Kings seemingly had a shot to at least make it to the playoffs. Brown led the Kings to the first-round of the playoffs for the first time since 2006 in the 2022-23 season. Sacramento surprisingly went up 2-0 in the series against Golden State, but ultimately lost in seven games. Sacramento is no stranger to cycling through coaches. Since Rick Adelman was the head coach from 1998-2006, there have been zero Kings coaches who have lasted longer than three seasons. Sacramento has hired 10 coaches since 2006. The timing of Brown's firing is particularly interesting, given that the head coach signed a multiyear extension with the Kings in June. Brown's contract extension paid him $8.5 million annually through the 2026-27 season, making it a 3-year, $25.5 million deal that can be worth up to $30 million if incentives are hit. Brown's original 4-year contract with the Kings was slated to expire after the 2024-25 season. It sounds like the Kings fired Brown on Friday after he led the team through a full practice, and as it was set to board a plane to Los Angeles. The Sacramento Kings just fired Mike Brown right before the team boarded a flight to LA. He just ran a full practice and spent 15 minutes talking to the media.Just bad man. Bad bad bad. Brown even went through media availability shortly before his firing: Again, just minutes ago we spoke with Mike Brown for 15 minutes. Part of what he talked about was handling the pressure as the head coach of an underperforming team.Here was his answer minutes before being fired: pic.twitter.com/LvcZmUmeIN Per Charania, current Kings assistant Doug Christie and former Sacramento guard will serve as the interim head coach for the rest of the season.

                "content": "If not listed, please contact your TV provider. The Sacramento Kings fired Mike Brown on Friday. He was just 31 games into his third season as head coach, and just two years removed from being named Coach of the Year after ending Sacramento's 16-season playoff drought -- as a No. 3 seed, no less -- in 2022-23. The Kings, after adding DeMar DeRozan this summer, as well as the heightened expectations a player of that caliber brings, have gotten off to a 13-18 start and have lost five straight, with the latest being a gut punch against Detroit when they coughed up a three-point lead in the closing seconds on a four-point play. That wound up being the straw that broke Brown's back, as ESPN reported that Brown was informed on a phone call as he was on his way to the airport to leave for Los Angeles, where the Kings are scheduled to play the Lakers on Saturday. Many of Brown's coaching compatriots expressed genuine shock in Sacramento's decision to fire Brown. Pacers coach Rick Carlisle, who described Brown as \"one of the standard bearers for integrity for our profession,\" and Warriors coach Steve Kerr both called the Kings' decision to fire Brown \"shocking,\" and it was clear in comments made by fellow coaches Tom Thibodeau, Jamahl Mosley and Jordi Fernandez, who called Brown \"one of the best,\" that pretty much nobody agrees with this decision. But none of them went as far as Nuggets coach Mike Malone, who was fired by the Kings in 2014 just 24 games into his second season as the team's coach and went full scorched earth on his former employer (particularly Kings owner Vivek Ranadive, though he didn't name him directly) when he was asked about Brown's firing. \"We're going into a [Nuggets coaches] meeting this afternoon ... I'm not on social media. I'm not aware of what's going on outside these walls sometimes. It'll probably take off six years of my life,\" Malone began. \"I go into the meeting and the coaches say, 'you hear about Mike Brown?' I said, 'why, what happened?' They said he got fired. \"At first I was really shocked and surprised,\" Malone continued. \"Then I caught myself. I said, why am I shocked and surprised? [I'm not] for two reasons. One, because as an NBA head coach, ultimately, you're going to get the blame. When [the Kings' win, [the credit is] gonna go to [De'Aaron] Fox and [Domantas] Sabonis, and when [they] lose, the [blame] is gonna go to Mike Brown. That's the way it works. \"And two, who [Brown] works for,\" Malone concluded as he launched his shot at the Kings. \"So I'm not surprised that Mike Brown got fired, because I got fired by the same person. And what really pissed me off about it was the fact that [the Kings] lost last night, fifth game in a row, I believe. Tough loss, fouling a jump shooter. They had practiced this morning. He does his media, and he's in his car going to the airport to fly to L.A. and they call him on the phone [and tell him he's fired]. No class. No balls. That's what I'll say about that.\" Michael Malone blasts the Kings for firing Mike Brown: \"No balls. No class.\"Malone says Brown was fired over the phone on his way to the airport for the Kings' next game.\"I'm not surprised that Mike Brown got fired, because I got fired by the same person.\" pic.twitter.com/LoE4XKsvzQ Malone clearly has some hard feelings about his time, and the way it ended, in Sacramento, and he has a point. Yes, NBA coaches are, for the most part, hired with the expectation that they will one day, probably fairly soon, be fired. It's not fair, but it's the way it works. The coach is the easiest variable to change when things are going poorly. You can't just get rid of players. But there's a classier way to do it than on the phone, especially after you let the guy go through a practice and head off to the airport to fly to the next game. The Kings were a mess before Brown showed up. You can, if you'd like, blame him for the fact that Kevin Huerter and Keegan Murray have seemingly forgotten how to shoot for the bulk of this season, or that the Kings have gone 3-11 in games decided by five or fewer points, but Brown deserved to be talked to face to face. Through that lens, it's hard to argue with Malone's point. © 2004-2024 CBS Interactive. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED. CBS Sports is a registered trademark of CBS Broadcasting Inc.

                "title": "Kessler syndrome - Wikipedia",
                "content": "The Kessler syndrome (also called the Kessler effect,[1][2] collisional cascading, or ablation cascade), proposed by NASA scientists Donald J. Kessler and Burton G. Cour-Palais in 1978, is a scenario in which the density of objects in low Earth orbit (LEO) due to space pollution is numerous enough that collisions between objects could cause a cascade in which each collision generates space debris that increases the likelihood of further collisions.[3] In 2009, Kessler wrote that modeling results had concluded that the debris environment was already unstable, \"such that any attempt to achieve a growth-free small debris environment by eliminating sources of past debris will likely fail because fragments from future collisions will be generated faster than atmospheric drag will remove them\".[4] One implication is that the distribution of debris in orbit could render space activities and the use of satellites in specific orbital ranges difficult for many generations.[3] Willy Ley predicted in 1960 that \"In time, a number of such accidentally too-lucky shots will accumulate in space and will have to be removed when the era of manned space flight arrives\".[5] After the launch of Sputnik 1 in 1957, the North American Aerospace Defense Command (NORAD) began compiling a database (the Space Object Catalog) of all known rocket launches and objects reaching orbit: satellites, protective shields and upper- and lower-stage booster rockets. NASA later published[when?] modified versions of the database in two-line element set,[6] and during the early 1980s the CelesTrak bulletin board system re-published them.[7] The trackers who fed the database were aware of other objects in orbit, many of which were the result of in-orbit explosions.[8] Some were deliberately caused during the 1960s anti-satellite weapon (ASAT) testing, and others were the result of rocket stages blowing up in orbit as leftover propellant expanded and ruptured their tanks. To improve tracking, NORAD employee John Gabbard kept a separate database. Studying the explosions, Gabbard developed a technique for predicting the orbital paths of their products, and Gabbard diagrams (or plots) are now widely used. These studies were used to improve the modeling of orbital evolution and decay.[9] When the NORAD database became publicly available during the 1970s, NASA scientist Donald J. Kessler applied the technique developed for the asteroid-belt study to the database of known objects. In June 1978, Kessler and Burton Cour-Palais co-authored \"Collision Frequency of Artificial Satellites: The Creation of a Debris Belt\",[3] demonstrating that the process controlling asteroid evolution would cause a similar collision process in LEO in decades rather than billions of years. They concluded that by about 2000, space debris would outpace micrometeoroids as the primary ablative risk to orbiting spacecraft.[4] At the time, it was widely thought that drag from the upper atmosphere would de-orbit debris faster than it was created.[citation needed] However, Gabbard was aware that the number and type of objects in space were under-represented in the NORAD data and was familiar with their behavior. In an interview shortly after the publication of the 1978 paper, Gabbard coined the term Kessler syndrome to refer to the accumulation of debris;[4] it became widely used after its appearance in a 1982 Popular Science article,[10] which won the Aviation-Space Writers Association 1982 National Journalism Award.[4] The lack of hard data about space debris prompted a series of studies to better characterize the LEO environment. In October 1979, NASA provided Kessler with funding for further studies.[4] Several approaches were used by these studies. Optical telescopes and short-wavelength radar were used to measure the number and size of space objects, and these measurements demonstrated that the published population count was at least 50% too low.[11] Before this, it was believed that the NORAD database accounted for the majority of large objects in orbit. Some objects (typically, US military spacecraft) were found to be omitted from the NORAD list, and others were not included because they were considered unimportant. The list could not easily account for objects under 20 cm (8 in) in size—in particular, debris from exploding rocket stages and several 1960s anti-satellite tests.[4] Returned spacecraft were microscopically examined for small impacts, and sections of Skylab and the Apollo Command/Service Module which were recovered were found to be pitted. Each study indicated that the debris flux was higher than expected and debris was the primary source of micrometeoroids and orbital debris collisions in space. LEO already demonstrated the Kessler syndrome.[4] In 1978, Kessler found that 42 percent of cataloged debris was the result of 19 events, primarily explosions of spent rocket stages (especially US Delta rockets).[12] He discovered this by first identifying those launches that were described as having a large number of objects associated with a payload, then researching the literature to determine the rockets used in the launch. In 1979, this finding resulted in establishment of the NASA Orbital Debris Program after a briefing to NASA senior management, overturning the previously held belief that most unknown debris was from old ASAT tests, not from US upper stage rocket explosions that could seemingly be easily managed by depleting the unused fuel from the upper stage Delta rocket following the payload injection. Beginning in 1986, when it was discovered that other international agencies were possibly experiencing the same type of problem, NASA expanded its program to include international agencies, the first being the European Space Agency.[13]: 2 A number of other Delta components in orbit (Delta was a workhorse of the US space program) had not yet exploded.[citation needed] During the 1980s, the United States Air Force (USAF) conducted an experimental program to determine what would happen if debris collided with satellites or other debris. The study demonstrated that the process differed from micrometeoroid collisions, with large chunks of debris created which would become collision threats.[4] In 1991, Kessler published \"Collisional cascading: The limits of population growth in low Earth orbit\"[14] with the best data then available. Citing the USAF conclusions about creation of debris, he wrote that although almost all debris objects (such as paint flecks) were lightweight, most of its mass was in debris about 1 kg (2 lb 3 oz) or heavier. This mass could destroy a spacecraft on impact, creating more debris in the critical-mass area.[15] According to the National Academy of Sciences: A 1 kg object impacting at 10 km/s, for example, is probably capable of catastrophically breaking up a 1,000 kg spacecraft if it strikes a high-density element in the spacecraft. In such a breakup, numerous fragments larger than 1 kg would be created.[16] Kessler's analysis divided the problem into three parts. With a low-enough density, the addition of debris by impacts is slower than their decay rate and the problem is not significant. Beyond that is a critical density, where additional debris leads to additional collisions. At densities beyond this critical mass production exceeds decay, leading to a cascading chain reaction reducing the orbiting population to small objects (several centimeters in size) and increasing the hazard of space activity.[15] This chain reaction is known as the Kessler syndrome.[4] In an early 2009 historical overview, Kessler summed up the situation: Aggressive space activities without adequate safeguards could significantly shorten the time between collisions and produce an intolerable hazard to future spacecraft. Some of the most environmentally dangerous activities in space include large constellations such as those initially proposed by the Strategic Defense Initiative in the mid-1980s, large structures such as those considered in the late-1970s for building solar power stations in Earth orbit, and anti-satellite warfare using systems tested by the USSR, the US, and China over the past 30 years. Such aggressive activities could set up a situation where a single satellite failure could lead to cascading failures of many satellites in a period much shorter than years.[4] In 1985, the first anti-satellite (ASAT) missile was used in the destruction of a satellite. The American 1985 ASM-135 ASAT test was carried out, in which the Solwind P78-1 satellite flying at an altitude of 555 kilometres (345 mi) was struck by the 14-kilogram (31 lb) payload at a velocity of 24,000 kilometres per hour (15,000 mph; 6.7 km/s). When NASA learned of U.S. Air Force plans for the Solwind ASAT test, they modeled the effects of the test and determined that debris produced by the collision would still be in orbit late into the 1990s. It would force NASA to enhance debris shielding for its planned space station.[17] On 11 January 2007, China conducted an anti-satellite missile test in which one of their FY-1C weather satellites was chosen as the target. The collision occurred at an altitude of 865 kilometres (537 mi), when the satellite with a mass of 750 kilograms (1,650 lb) was struck in a head-on-collision by a kinetic payload traveling with a speed of 8 km/s (18,000 mph) in the opposite direction. The resulting debris orbits the Earth with a mean altitude above 850 kilometres (530 mi), and will likely remain in orbit for decades or centuries.[18] The destruction of the Kosmos 1408 satellite by a Russian ASAT missile on November 15, 2021, has created a large debris cloud, with 1500 pieces of debris being tracked and an estimated hundreds of thousands of pieces too small to track. Since the satellite was in a polar orbit, and its debris has spread out between the altitudes of 300 and 1,000 kilometres (190 and 620 mi), it could potentially collide with any LEO satellite, including the International Space Station and the Chinese Space Station (Tiangong).[19][20][21] A significant event related to the Kessler Syndrome occurred on August 9, 2024, when a Chinese Long March 6A rocket broke apart in low-Earth orbit, creating a cloud of hundreds of debris fragments. The US Space Command confirmed this breakup, and it has been tracked by multiple space debris-tracking organizations. The event resulted in at least 700 fragments, with the potential for more than 900. The debris poses a substantial risk to low-Earth orbit constellations, particularly those orbiting below 800 kilometers, and may remain in orbit for years, increasing the likelihood of collisions. This incident highlights ongoing concerns about space debris and the increasing risk of a cascading effect as more objects are launched into orbit. [22] Every satellite, space probe, and crewed mission has the potential to produce space debris. The theoretical cascading Kessler syndrome becomes more likely as satellites in orbit increase in number. As of 2014, there were about 2,000 commercial and government satellites orbiting the Earth,[23] and as of 2021[update] more than 4,000.[24] It is estimated that there are 600,000 pieces of space junk ranging from 1 to 10 cm (1⁄2 to 4 in), and 23,000 larger than that.[24] On average, every year, one satellite is destroyed by collision with other satellites or space junk.[23][25] As of 2009[update], there had been four collisions between catalogued objects, including a collision between two satellites in 2009.[4] Orbital decay is much slower at altitudes where atmospheric drag is insignificant. Slight atmospheric drag, lunar perturbation, and solar wind drag can gradually bring debris down to lower altitudes where fragments finally re-enter, but this process can take millennia at very high altitudes.[26] The Kessler syndrome is troublesome because of the domino effect and feedback runaway wherein impacts between objects of sizable mass spall off debris from the force of the collision. The fragments can then hit other objects, producing even more space debris: if a large enough collision or explosion were to occur, such as between a space station and a defunct satellite, or as the result of hostile actions in space, then the resulting debris cascade could make prospects for long-term viability of satellites in particular low Earth orbits extremely low.[27][28] However, even a catastrophic Kessler scenario at LEO would pose minimal risk for launches continuing past LEO, or satellites travelling at medium Earth orbit (MEO) or geosynchronous orbit (GEO). The catastrophic scenarios predict an increase in the number of collisions per year, as opposed to a physically impassable barrier to space exploration that occurs in higher orbits.[citation needed] Some astronomers have hypothesized Kessler syndrome as a possible or likely solution to the Fermi paradox, the lack of any sign of alien life in the universe. Any intelligent civilization which becomes spacefaring could eventually extinguish any safe orbits via Kessler syndrome, trapping itself within its home planet.[29] Such a result could happen even with robust space pollution controls, as a lone malicious actor on a planet could cause a Kessler syndrome scenario.[30] Humanity could be on the path to a similar fate, soon to trap itself on Earth with no future as a spacefaring civilization.[31] Some exoplanet researchers have attempted to survey other planets for signs of a Kessler syndrome cascade as a sign of intelligent life.[32] Designers of a new vehicle or satellite are frequently required by the ITU[33] to demonstrate that it can be safely disposed of at the end of its life, for example by use of a controlled atmospheric reentry system or a boost into a graveyard orbit.[34] For US launches or satellites that will have broadcast to US territories—in order to obtain a license to provide telecommunications services in the United States—the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) required all geostationary satellites launched after 18 March 2002 to commit to moving to a graveyard orbit at the end of their operational life.[34] US government regulations similarly require a plan to dispose of satellites after the end of their mission: atmospheric re-entry,[clarification needed] movement to a storage orbit, or direct retrieval.[35] A proposed energy-efficient means of deorbiting a spacecraft from Medium Earth Orbit is to shift it to an orbit in an unstable resonance with the Sun or Moon that speeds up orbital decay.[36][37] One technology proposed to help deal with fragments from 1 to 10 cm (1⁄2 to 4 in) in size is the laser broom, a proposed multimegawatt land-based laser that could deorbit debris: the side of the debris hit by the laser would ablate and create a thrust that would change the eccentricity of the remains of the fragment until it would re-enter and be destroyed harmlessly.[38] ESA and the Swiss startup ClearSpace plans a mission to remove the PROBA-1 satellite from orbit.[39] The Envisat satellite is a large, inactive satellite with a mass of 8,211 kg (18,102 lb) that orbits at 785 km (488 mi), an altitude where the debris environment is the greatest—two catalogued objects can be expected to pass within about 200 m (660 ft) of Envisat every year[40]—and likely to increase. Don Kessler predicted in 2012 that it could easily become a major debris contributor from a collision during the next 150 years that it will remain in orbit.[40] SpaceX's Starlink program raises concerns about significantly worsening the possibility of Kessler syndrome due to the large number of satellites the program aims to place in LEO, as the program's goal will more than double the satellites currently in LEO.[39][41] In response to these concerns, SpaceX said that a large part of Starlink satellites are launched at a lower altitude of 550 km (340 mi) to achieve lower latency (versus 1,150 km (710 mi) as originally planned), and failed satellites or debris are thus expected to deorbit within five years even without propulsion, due to atmospheric drag.[42] In 2024, Jon Kelvey noted in an overview article that \"the scientific community hasn’t yet reached a consensus about whether the Kessler Syndrome has begun, or, if it has not begun, how bad it will be when it starts. There is consensus, however, that the basic concept is sound and that the space community needs to clean up its act.\"[39]",

                "content": "This feared space-junk cascade called Kessler Syndrome may have already begun. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works. The Kessler Syndrome is a phenomenon in which the amount of junk in orbit around Earth reaches a point where it just creates more and more space debris, causing big problems for satellites, astronauts and mission planners. Consider this scenario: The destruction of a dead spy satellite spawns a swarm of debris in Earth orbit, which wreaks ever-increasing havoc as it zooms around our planet. The cloud destroys a number of communications satellites, generating more and more debris with every violent collision. It takes out the iconic Hubble Space Telescope and a NASA space shuttle, killing several crewmembers aboard the winged vehicle. It then lines the International Space Station (ISS) up in its crosshairs, destroying the $100 billion orbiting lab with a hail of fast-flying shrapnel. This dramatic scene is fictional, of course; it's pulled from the award-winning 2013 sci-fi film \"Gravity.\" But many satellite operators, mission planners and exploration advocates worry that it could be a dark window into a future that's all too real, thanks to the Kessler Syndrome. Read on to learn more about this feared phenomenon, which describes a snowballing cascade of space junk. Related: The worst space debris events of all time The Kessler Syndrome is named after former NASA scientist Donald Kessler, who laid out the basic idea in a seminal 1978 paper. In that study, titled \"Collision Frequency of Artificial Satellites: The Creation of a Debris Belt,\" Kessler and co-author Burton Cour-Palais noted that the likelihood of satellite collisions increases as more and more spacecraft are lofted to orbit. And each such smashup would have an outsized impact on the orbital environment. \"Satellite collisions would produce orbiting fragments, each of which would increase the probability of further collisions, leading to the growth of a belt of debris around the Earth,\" the duo wrote. \"The debris flux in such an Earth-orbiting belt could exceed the natural meteoroid flux, affecting future spacecraft designs.\" The Kessler Syndrome describes, and warns of, a cascade of orbital debris that could potentially hinder humanity's space ambitions and activities down the road. The original paper predicted that satellite collisions would become a source of space junk by the year 2000, if not sooner, unless humanity changed how it lofted payloads to orbit. But a timeline is not essential to the core idea. \"It was never intended to mean that the cascading would occur over a period of time as short as days or months. Nor was it a prediction that the current environment was above some critical threshold,\" Kessler wrote in a 2009 paper that clarified the definition of the Kessler Syndrome and discussed its implications. \"The 'Kessler Syndrome' was meant to describe the phenomenon that random collisions between objects large enough to catalogue would produce a hazard to spacecraft from small debris that is greater than the natural meteoroid environment,\" he added. \"In addition, because the random collision frequency is non-linear with debris accumulation rates, the phenomenon will eventually become the most important long-term source of debris, unless the accumulation rate of larger, non-operational objects (e.g., non-operational payloads and upper-stage rocket bodies) in Earth orbit were significantly reduced.\" And Kessler didn't name this scenario after himself. In that 2009 paper, he explained that \"Kessler Syndrome\" apparently originated with John Gabbard, a scientist with the North American Aerospace Defense Command (NORAD) who kept an unofficial record of big satellite breakups in orbit. Gabbard used the term when talking to a reporter shortly after the 1978 study came out. The Kessler Syndrome then worked its way into the public consciousness, \"becoming part of the storyline in some science fiction, and a three-word summary describing orbital debris issues,\" Kessler wrote in the 2009 paper. To give you another idea of how influential the 1978 study was: A year later, NASA established the Orbital Debris Program Office at Johnson Space Center in Houston and made Kessler its head. (Kessler, who was born in 1940, retired from NASA in 1996 with the title of senior scientist for orbital debris research. But he remains active in the debris research community today.) Earth orbit is getting more and more crowded as the years go by. Humanity has launched about 12,170 satellites since the dawn of the space age in 1957, according to the European Space Agency (ESA), and 7,630 of them remain in orbit today — but only about 4,700 are still operational. That means there are nearly 3,000 defunct spacecraft zooming around Earth at tremendous speeds, along with other big, dangerous pieces of debris like upper-stage rocket bodies. For example, orbital velocity at 250 miles (400 kilometers) up, the altitude at which the ISS flies, is about 17,100 mph (27,500 kph). At such speeds, even a tiny shard of debris can do serious damage to a spacecraft — and there are huge numbers of such fragmentary bullets zipping around our planet. ESA estimates that Earth orbit harbors at least 36,500 debris objects that are more than 4 inches (10 centimeters) wide, 1 million between 0.4 inches and 4 inches (1 to 10 cm) across, and a staggering 330 million that are smaller than 0.4 inches (1 cm) but bigger than 0.04 inches (1 millimeter). These objects pose more than just a hypothetical threat. From 1999 to May 2021, for example, the ISS conducted 29 debris-avoiding maneuvers, including three in 2020 alone, according to NASA officials. And that number continues to grow; the station performed another such move in November 2021, for example. Many of the smaller pieces of space junk were spawned by the explosion of spent rocket bodies in orbit, but others were more actively emplaced. In January 2007, for instance, China intentionally destroyed one of its defunct weather satellites in a much-criticized test of anti-satellite technology that generated more than 3,000 tracked debris objects and perhaps 32,000 others too small to be detected. The vast majority of that junk remains in orbit today, experts say. Spacecraft have also collided with each other on orbit. The most famous such incident occurred in February 2009, when Russia's defunct Kosmos 2251 satellite slammed into the operational communications craft Iridium 33, producing nearly 2,000 pieces of debris bigger than a softball. That 2009 smashup might be evidence that the Kessler Syndrome is already upon us, though a cataclysm of \"Gravity\" proportions is still a long way off. \"The cascade process can be more accurately thought of as continuous and as already started, where each collision or explosion in orbit slowly results in an increase in the frequency of future collisions,\" Kessler told Space Safety Magazine in 2012.

Multiple satellite \"megaconstellations\" are in the works, making space traffic management and space-junk mitigation more pressing issues than they've ever been. (Such networks could also transform the night sky for professional and amateur astronomers, a separate but also important issue.) For instance, SpaceX has already launched more than 1,700 satellites for its Starlink broadband constellation, which could eventually consist of more than 40,000 craft. OneWeb has lofted more than half of the satellites for its planned 648-member constellation, which may also grow beyond that initial number as time goes on. Amazon aims to assemble its own internet-satellite network, which will consist of more than 3,200 spacecraft. And in November 2021, Bay Area launch startup Astra filed an application with the U.S. Federal Communications Commission for its own 13,600-satellite broadband constellation. In addition, launch and satellite construction costs continue to fall, allowing more and more people to get satellites up and operate them — including folks with very little experience in the field. This opening of the final frontier is generally a good thing, most experts say, but it further highlights the need for forethought and responsible action when it comes to satellite operation. In 2019, for example, the Space Safety Coalition (SSC) laid out a set of proposed voluntary guidelines designed to keep the Kessler Syndrome, and space junk in general, at bay over the coming years. One recommendation is that all satellites operating above 250 miles (400 km) be equipped with propulsion systems allowing them to maneuver away from possible collisions. Drawing the line there makes sense for multiple reasons, according to the SSC: It's the altitude at which the ISS flies, and satellites that circle below this boundary tend to encounter enough atmospheric drag to fall out of orbit relatively soon after their operational lives come to an end. The SSC also recommends that satellite designers consider building encryption systems into the command systems of their craft, so they'll be harder for chaos-seeking hackers to hijack. And operators who control satellites in low Earth orbit should include in their launch contracts a requirement that rocket upper stages be disposed of in the atmosphere shortly after liftoff. Related: 7 wild ways to destroy orbital debris More active debris-fighting strategies could also be part of the solution. Removing just a handful of rocket bodies or big, dead satellites every year could help us keep our space-junk problem under control, according to some studies. And researchers around the world are developing and testing ways to do just that, using nets, harpoons and other methods. Such activities would have to be carefully coordinated and thought out. Space objects, including junk such as spent rocket bodies, belong to the nation that launched them, so the U.S. government or a U.S. company couldn't just unilaterally de-orbit a bunch of spent Russian rocket bodies (or vice versa). Such action might spark an international incident, not least because debris-removing tech might also be viewed as a potential space weapon that could take out operational satellites. But the space-junk issue is a global one, so governments around the world should already be having meaty conversations about how to deal with it. Let's hope the talks, the decisions and the tech end up outpacing the problem, for all of our sakes.

                "title": "Frontiers | Kessler’s syndrome: a challenge to humanity",
                "content": "Kessler’s Syndrome is a global phenomenon characterized by the presence of tens of millions of debris pieces of various sizes that disrupt satellite operations. This article delves into the potential outcomes of a Kessler’s Syndrome occurrence and its implications on satellite operations. The potential threats posed by this scenario are discussed, including the implications of minimal to no satellite function on human impacts, including crashes and minimized or disrupted functions in essential utility services, as these sectors heavily rely on satellites. In addition, we discuss how the loss of satellite communications could gradually or rapidly affect global affairs. As humans are a dominant force on Earth, their endangerment would reverberate throughout the ecological system, potentially leading to the demise of other species. It is crucial for policymakers and relevant stakeholders to recognize these implications and work towards safeguarding satellite communication to mitigate potential negative outcomes for humanity’s wellbeing and progress. The recycling of space debris emerges as a promising and long-term sustainable solution to the mitigation of space debris. By repurposing decommissioned satellites and debris into useful materials to support other space missions, this recycling strategy presents a win-win scenario, promoting environmental sustainability and resource efficiency in space exploration. Space has emerged as a key domain since the historic launch of Sputnik 1, the first man-made satellite, in 1957 Dickson (2011). Since then, there has been an exponential proliferation of artificial objects in space Anz-Meador (2020) and Bastida Virgili et al. (2016). These satellites serve diverse purposes, from military and commercial applications to navigation and communication systems. Satellite communication has revolutionized global connectivity, becoming indispensable in the modern world. With more than 8,000 active and defunct satellites orbiting Earth Cowardin (2022), satellite systems have become integral to the daily lives of individuals, businesses, and organizations around the world. The significance of satellite communication is evident from the fact that, as of April 2022, there were 5.03 billion internet users, representing 63.1% of the world’s population, highlighting the massive dependence on satellite communication for various activities Petrosyan, (2023). However, this escalating presence of satellites in space has led to a growing concern: space debris. In particular, the collision of the Iridium 33 and Kosmos-2251 satellites in 2009 generated a cloud of debris that continues to pose a threat to other satellites Oleksyn (2009) and Garcia (2021). Additionally, India’s antisatellite missile test in 2019 resulted in approximately 400 pieces of orbital debris, increasing the risk to the International Space Station (ISS) Molayath and Sanal Kumar (2010) and Mariappan et al. (Mariappan et al., 2019; Mariappan et al., 2020). Low Earth and geostationary (GEO) orbits, where many operational satellites are located, have become cluttered with space debris, some traveling at hypervelocity speeds of 7 km/s to 15 km/s Sample (2016). Even minuscule debris particles possess significant kinetic energy, posing threats to satellites and spacecraft. The risk of collision-induced chain reactions, as theorized by Donald J. Kessler in 1978, has gained traction and is now known as “Kessler’s Syndrome” Kessler and Cour-Palais (1978). This syndrome predicts an escalating space debris population that leads to an increased likelihood of collisions and further debris creation, resulting in a cascade of detrimental impacts. Such collisions, even minor ones, can set off a catastrophic chain reaction, jeopardizing all existing satellites and filling orbits with high-velocity debris. Accessing space orbits would become immensely challenging, and the prospect of exploring outer space might be compromised. Computer-generated future scenarios indicate that the space debris population may reach saturation and collisions will persist even without new spacecraft launches Liou and Johnson (2006) and National Research Council (2011). This article delves into the potential outcomes of the occurrence of Kessler’s Syndrome. While space exploration has propelled humanity’s understanding of the cosmos, it is essential to recognize and address the potential threats posed by space debris. Collaborative efforts, innovative mitigation techniques, and proactive measures are essential to safeguard the future of satellite communication and space exploration. The responsibility falls on all nations to work together, akin to global agreements addressing environmental issues, to protect our collective interests and ensure the long-term sustainability of space activities. As we navigate the complexities of space, it is vital to preserve the integrity of our endeavors and protect against the adverse impacts of space debris on humanity’s future. In the contemporary era, the accessibility of an array of conveniences within arm’s reach has become a hallmark of modern civilization, primarily enabled by the vast network of thousands of Earth-orbiting satellites facilitating real-time data collection and transmission. However, it is imperative to consider the potential consequences should we encounter a sudden loss of control or communication with all satellite systems within a compressed time frame Hollingham (2013). In this article, “satellite communication” pertains to the retrieval of satellite data from ground stations in the event of satellite damage, whether partial or complete. This section delves into the prospective ramifications of Kessler’s Syndrome, envisioning a scenario where satellite communication is entirely compromised over the span of two to three decades, and explores its profound implications on humans. The authors highlight the increasing risk of collisions between active space vehicles and space debris, an effect attributed to the increase in the affordability of satellite launches and the commercialization of the space industry Tao et al. (2022). Understanding the gravity of such a prospect is vital for informed decision-making and robust contingency planning. The present investigation examines the potential threats posed by Kessler’s Syndrome to the space industry and its implications on satellite operations and access to space. Current data suggest that, at this point, the probability of an abrupt occurrence of this syndrome over a short period remains relatively low Kessler (2009). It is estimated that destructive collisions below 1,000 km altitude occur approximately every 3.9 years over the span of 1,000 years, considering certain assumptions such as debris size being greater than or equal to 10 cm, controlled launch rates, and absence of explosions Lewis (2020). The amount of space debris in orbit by size is shown in Table 1. However, it is essential to recognize that unforeseen factors, such as the launch of additional satellites in the coming years, anti-satellite missile tests, and satellite collisions, could escalate these risks. Even tiny debris measuring 1 mm, carrying an energy equivalent to 71 J or 0.0003 TNT/kg, could trigger catastrophic collisions and generate more fragments The Aerospace Corporation (2023). A collision with a 10 cm single of debris, possessing high kinetic energy, can further exacerbate the situation. Additionally, the presence of tens of millions of tiny debris pieces, below or equal to 1 cm in size, presents tracking challenges, hindering the efficacy of current mitigation techniques that involve maneuvering spacecraft to avoid potential impacts. TABLE 1. Size distribution of man-made space debris. Based on data from The Aerospace Corporation (2023). The lack of an active removal system in space could lead to an exponential increase in objects in low-Earth orbit (LEO), impeding spacecraft launches and maneuvering. Consequently, loss of control within LEO or significant communication disruptions with satellites could severely limit access to space for future missions. Furthermore, with the appearance of Kessler’s Syndrome, the launch of satellites would be a higher risk, as the orbits could be densely populated with debris clouds exhibiting varying kinetic energies The Aerospace Corporation (2023). Such an eventuality may necessitate a shutdown of global space programs until viable solutions are devised, potentially leading to economic imbalances and job losses within the space industry. The ensuing section delves into the cascading effects on other industries resulting from space program limitations due to the inaccessibility of space. The Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) is a critical satellite-based navigation system that provides essential guidance to humans and vehicles navigating various terrains. Its uses are widespread, with essential industries such as defense, aviation, space exploration, maritime, rail transportation, and road networks benefiting from it Pistoia (2009) and The Aerospace Corporation (2021). GNSS satellites operate primarily in Medium Earth Orbit (MEO), at altitudes ranging from 2,000 km to 31,570 km above the Earth’s surface. MEO, which is located between GEO and LEO, has the advantage of having a lower population of space junk than its counterparts, LEO and GEO European Space Agency (ESA) (2023). Because of the increasing worldwide competitiveness in space activities, the LEO, an ever-increasing concentration of space objects, is attained the saturation. The increase in debris in LEO poses a serious threat to current and future space operations, compromising our ability to launch and maintain spacecraft in this important region Colvin et al. (2023). If LEO becomes overcrowded with orbital debris and effective mitigation techniques remain undeveloped, the chances of putting a spacecraft into orbit will diminish dramatically. It is important to think on long-term scales, which would take LEO problems to other orbits, such as MEO and GEO. Thus, looking at the effect of GPS operations in MEO orbits is crucial for future debris mitigation. Figure 1 shows the number of trackable objects in each orbital domain. FIGURE 1. Count of objects in various orbital regimes. Based on data from European Space Agency (ESA) (2023). This section explores the potential consequences of a GNSS disruption on many sectors, particularly if our ability to launch new satellites into orbit is jeopardized. It is critical to fully appreciate the implications in order to identify vulnerabilities and build contingency plans to reduce the impact of GNSS unavailability across these varied businesses. At the moment, Earth’s orbit is home to a constellation of 31 active Global Positioning Satellites (GPS) United States Space Force (2022a), 35 active BeiDou satellites, 24+ Galileo satellites, 24+ GLONASS (Globalnaya Navigazionnaya Sputnikovaya Sistema, or Global Navigation Satellite System), 7 Indian Regional Navigation Satellite System (IRNSS)/Navigation Indian Constellation (NavIC), and 7 Quasi-Zenith Satellite System (QZSS) United States Space Force (2021d). The defense sector is heavily dependent on satellite communication (SATCOM) for critical military operations, including communication, missile guidance, search and rescue missions, and the piloting of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), among other essential functions United States Space Force (United States Space Force, 2021b; United States Space Force, 2022a). Loss of satellite communication systems would significantly impede the sector’s ability to operate at full capacity. Without reliable communication systems, transmitting messages would become difficult for military personnel. Although an analog system serves as a backup mode of communication United States Space Force (2019), its limited operational range poses challenges for effective communication. Relying solely on analog systems for extensive military operations would prove impractical. Currently, the defense sector worldwide exhibits an average reliance of 70%–80% on satellite communication, and this figure is expected to increase in the future, although the exact percentage remains classified for security reasons Weeden and Samson (2018). The airline industry relies extensively on the Flight Management System (FMS) to automate various in-flight operations that were previously performed manually, thus facilitating smoother flight operations Spitzer (2018). FMS uses multiple sensors, including GPS, to calculate the position of the aircraft and fuel levels, among other critical parameters Stössel (2015). A breakdown in the satellite communication system would disrupt the transmission of GPS data, potentially compromising the FMS functionality. Although modern aircrafts are equipped with backup sensors to facilitate landing in case of technical failures Stössel (2015), relying solely on analog communication for flight operations midst the multitude of flights poses significant risks. In such an event, communication between Air Traffic Control (ATC) and flights could be severely hampered, affecting effective flight management and response to emergencies European Space Agency (2022) and Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) (2022). Without access to satellite communication systems, pilots and ATC would not be able to receive real-time weather updates, leading to potential risks of navigate under hazardous weather conditions Norton and Omberg (1947). Given the projected future increase in global air passenger traffic Statista Research Department (2022a), the implications of disrupted satellite communication in the airline industry could be far-reaching. The industry plays a vital role in various sectors, including medical tourism, vaccine distribution, and air cargo delivery International Air Transport Association (2022) and Dalen and Alpert (2019). A loss of effective satellite communication could hinder the seamless functioning of these critical services, potentially jeopardizing lives and putting off urgent medical care. In addition, the airline industry maintains a considerable workforce, with nearly 87.7 million people employed directly and indirectly Salas (2022a). In the event of reduced or unavailable satellite communication, the industry may face temporary or permanent downsizing, leading to job losses and economic instability for numerous individuals and families. Modern ships rely heavily on sophisticated systems, such as Automatic Identification Systems (AIS) and GNSS, among others, to ensure safe navigation and collision avoidance during their voyages Tetreault (2005) and Coast Guard—Office of Navigation Systems and Code of Federal Regulations (2019). Satellite communication systems play a crucial role in facilitating seamless communication and weather monitoring, helping ships reach their destinations safely. In the event of satellite communication failure, ships would be forced to resort to radar and analog communication systems. However, the maximum range of a ship radar for object detection is limited to 200 nautical miles Jenn (2019). Without proper communication with the Vessel Traffic Services, ships can be forced to suspend shipping operations until a viable communication solution is established or resort to navigating through analog means. As ocean shipping serves as the primary mode of transport for global trade Placek (2022), disruptions in satellite communication would have far-reaching effects on various industries relying on shipping services. The shipping industry provides essential logistical support for numerous sectors, and any disruption could lead to supply chain disruptions and economic repercussions. According to estimates for 2011, the global marine fishery industry employs more than 260 million people Teh and Sumaila (2011). The potential reduction in shipping operations due to communication system failures would put these jobs at risk, leading to economic challenges for the workforce and affecting local communities dependent on the maritime sector. The global railway network, which comprises an extensive route length of more than 1.3 million kilometers, is heavily dependent on GNSS technology for numerous indispensable functions Salas (2022b). Modern railway systems around the world are equipped with GNSS-based Positive Train Control systems, which play a critical role in preventing train collisions and ensuring safe operations United States Space Force (2021a). GNSS serves as a crucial tool for tracking locomotives, rail cars and wayside equipment, facilitating the synchronization of communication systems and enabling seamless communication among locomotive engineers, dispatchers, trains, airports, rail stations, and ports. Passengers also benefit from accurate train location information, allowing them to predict arrival times with precision. Given the paramount importance of GNSS for navigation and signaling, the uninterrupted operation of current rails depends on this indispensable technology. A potential reduction in GNSS availability could lead to the curtailment of railway operations, affecting millions of passengers who rely heavily on train commutes for transportation Hughes (2020). By 2022, the rail freight industry in the United States provided employment to approximately 135,000 individuals Statista Research Department (2022c). Similarly, Indian railways employ an estimated 1.54 million individuals, while the Chinese railway industry boasts nearly 2 million employees The Economic Times (ET) (2017) and Statista Research Department (2021b). These statistics underscore the significant contribution of the railway sector to the economy on a global scale, and any potential minimization of the railways due to GNSS disruptions would jeopardize these jobs. In addition, the railway industry plays a crucial role in transporting cargo to various locations. In the United States, rail freight volumes reached 2.53 trillion tonnes kilometer in 2018, but the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic saw this figure decrease to 2.1 trillion tonnes kilometer by 2020 Statista Research Department (2022b). In India, Indian Railways transported more than 1.42 billion metric tons of freight in fiscal year 2022 Sun (2023). In China, the rail industry transported an impressive 4.77 billion tons of rail cargo in 2021 Statista Research Department (2023c). In 2015, global road freight activity reached approximately 19,000 billion tonne-kilometers, and projections indicate that this figure will more than double by 2050. It is expected that the volume of road freight will increase by 91% in 2050 compared to 2020 Statista Research Department (2021c). However, the efficient functioning of road transport is highly dependent on GNSS technology. GNSS plays an essential role in improving vehicle efficiency and safety on roads, streets and mass transit networks by mitigating routing and dispatch challenges for commercial vehicles, as well as for mass transit, road maintenance, and emergency vehicles United States Space Force (2021e). The global installed base of Global Navigation Satellite System devices was 6.5 billion units in 2021, with forecasts predicting an increase to 10.6 billion devices by 2031 Alsop (2022). In addition, numerous nations use GNSS to inspect highway and road networks, enabling the detection of various features such as service stations, emergency services, entry and exit ramps, and road damage. The data collected feed into Geographic Information Systems, contributing to reduced maintenance and repair expenses and improved driver safety. GNSS technology also facilitates the automation of traffic lights Munoz-Organero et al. (2018). Taking into account the immense scale of road travel, statistics indicate that Americans engage in 1.1 billion travel activities daily, each person taking approximately four trips within the country Bureau of Transportation Statistics (2017). Additionally, an average of 236 billion vehicles travel on the road in the United States every month Bureau of Transportation Statistics (2022). With such high vehicle traffic, GNSS monitoring is crucial for accident prevention, especially as we move towards automated driving. The absence of GNSS would present significant challenges to vehicle monitoring and navigation in a world increasingly dependent on transportation systems. This disruption would profoundly affect various industries, as nearly every sector depends on efficient transportation systems to take care of the commute of workers and deliver products to customers. GNSS plays a critical role in providing accurate determination of time, longitude, latitude and altitude, making it a crucial fourth dimension for various industries and economic activities United States Space Force (2022b). GNSS satellites are equipped with highly precise atomic clocks, enabling the dissemination of real-time GNSS signals with exceptional accuracy. Access to time within 100 billionths of a second eliminates the need for costly investments in maintaining atomic clocks, benefiting industries that heavily rely on precise timing. Numerous sectors, such as electrical power grids, financial networks, and communication systems, depend on precise timing to achieve synchronization and operational efficiency. GNSS time enables companies to optimize operations, reduce costs, and improve capabilities. In wireless telephone and data networks, perfectly synchronized base stations improve spectrum usage and improve mobile phone performance. Digital radio broadcasting services also take advantage of GNSS time to ensure simultaneous bit transmission from all radio stations, minimizing listener delays during station switching. The financial sector benefits from GNSS time for accurate time-stamping of transactions, ensuring precise record-keeping and traceability. Furthermore, integration of GNSS time into seismic monitoring networks enables rapid pinpointing of epicenters of earthquakes and other seismic phenomena. The utility and power industries have specific time and frequency requirements to ensure reliable power transmission and distribution. GNSS time plays a crucial role in meeting these demands United States Space Force (2022b). However, the potential risks to satellite communication systems pose threats to the global economy, potentially leading to crashes and minimized or disrupted functions in essential utility services, as these sectors heavily rely on GNSS timing. Such economic downturns could result in widespread job losses that affect billions of people worldwide. Further discussions on the implications of losing GNSS time in the energy and utility sectors are presented later in this article. As technology continues to advance rapidly, the reliance on GNSS timing is expected to grow significantly in the future. Therefore, protecting and fortifying the GNSS infrastructure becomes imperative to support global economic stability and ensure the continued operation of essential utility services. From 1990 to 2012, agricultural activities occupied a significant proportion of the global land area, accounting for 35.79% in 2011 Statista Research Department (2015). The implementation of precision agriculture has revolutionized agricultural practices through the utilization of GNSS-based applications United States Space Force (2021c). Precision agriculture encompasses a diverse range of tasks, including farm planning, tractor guidance, variable rate applications, and yield mapping, among others. The integration of GNSS technology has proven invaluable to farmers, allowing seamless operations even in challenging conditions such as poor visibility caused by rain, dust, fog or darkness. Precision agriculture, powered by GNSS, facilitates the application and distribution of precise pesticides, herbicides, and fertilizers, leading to cost reduction, increased production, and enhanced ecological sustainability. Manufacturers of GNSS equipment have developed various tools to improve productivity and efficiency in precision agricultural practices. Farmers worldwide use GNSS services to optimize their operations Katz and Murphy (1997), and weather forecasts, accessible through satellite communication systems Ritchie (2021), play an essential role in guiding their farming decisions. The minimization or loss of satellite communication systems would profoundly impact agriculture, directly affecting food production. The indispensable role of GNSS in modern farming practices makes it challenging for farmers to revert to traditional methods without its support. Ensuring the continued operation of satellite communication systems is crucial for maintaining efficient and sustainable agricultural practices and securing global food production. Further discussions on the implications of losing satellite communication on the agricultural sector are presented in subsequent sections of this article. The energy and utility sector plays a vital role in society and is highly dependent on GNSS time to efficiently distribute and transmit power United States Space Force (2022b). However, the sector faces significant risks when satellite communication systems are reduced or completely lost. Additionally, the energy and utility sector’s operations depend on various interlinked services, including banking for financial transactions, the transportation sector for the delivery of essential goods and the distribution of utilities such as gas. The global usage of electricity is substantial, with nearly 7 billion out of 7.67 billion people worldwide using electricity daily Ritchie (2021). In 2019, global electricity consumption reached approximately 23,900 TWh Statista Research Department (2022d). The availability of electricity is crucial for individuals, communities, and organizations alike, and any disruption would significantly impact their functioning. In a testimonial report released by a congressional committee in 2015 House and Senate (2015), it was stated that the absence of electricity could potentially lead to a 90% mortality rate among Americans. This assertion may hold true not only for Americans but for a significant portion of the global population, given the indispensable role that electricity plays in everyday survival for people worldwide. The energy sector relies on various sources, such as renewable energy, nuclear reactors, coal, natural gas, and liquid fuels, for electricity generation Statista Research Department (2021a). Figure 2 displays the distribution of energy sources used to generate electricity. However, this sector is highly dependent on the transportation sector to ensure the supply of resources and the distribution of electricity. In the absence of proper transportation functioning, sectors depending on energy and utility, including banking and hospitality, would stop working or face significant limitations. FIGURE 2. Worldwide Power Generation in 2022 by energy source. Based on data from Statista Research Department (2021a). As satellite communication systems contribute substantially to the efficiency and reliability of the energy and utility sector, any potential loss of this technology could have far-reaching consequences. Further discussions on the implications of the loss of satellite communication systems on the energy and utility sector and associated industries will be discussed in later sections of this article. The protection of satellite communication stability is imperative to ensure uninterrupted energy and utility services and the smooth functioning of numerous interconnected sectors in the modern world. Renewable energy plays a significant role in global electricity generation, contributing approximately 6.99 TW-hours Statista Research Department (2021a). Among various renewable energy sources, biomass, hydroelectric, geothermal, wind, and solar energy are the main contributors United States Energy Information Administration (U.S. Energy Information Administration, 2023b and U.S. Energy Information Administration, 2022). Hydropower is based on the water cycle, and electricity is generated through dams utilizing elevation differences. During major power outages, many countries depend heavily on this energy source. Large dams employ numerous sensors, which rely on satellite communication, for crucial tasks such as opening and closing gates, dam assessment, power generation and monitoring Coombs and Braithwaite (2021). Although manual gate operation is possible, efficiently controlling the water allowance without an effective satellite communication system may prove challenging. Geothermal energy Heasler et al. (2009) requires precise location mapping, a task facilitated by GNSS technology. Satellite communication enables complete monitoring of entire geothermal plants with fewer human resources, ensuring timely reporting of any failures Morgan (2020). The development and management of solar and wind farms also benefit from satellite technology. Consequently, the dependence on satellite communication becomes crucial for the efficient operation of these renewable energy facilities. Countries that rely on other nations for resources to generate electricity, such as biomass and fuel, may face significant challenges, as importation of goods would be hindered without a properly functioning transportation sector. The interconnected nature of the generation and distribution of renewable energy underscores the importance of preserving satellite communication systems to ensure a stable and sustainable global energy landscape. Coal is the dominant resource for electricity generation, with approximately 35.8% of global coal usage dedicated to energy production Statista Research Department (2023d). In 2022, worldwide coal power generation reached approximately 10,191 TWh Statista Research Department (2023a). The coal industry is highly dependent on satellite technology, covering various stages from mining Xie et al. (2018) to coal processing for fuel and gas production. The modern equipment utilized in these processes benefits from the support of satellite technology. In particular, China and India are the largest exporters of coal. Any disruption in transportation means for exporting coal would significantly impact countries that rely on coal for electricity generation. The interconnectedness of the coal industry with satellite communication highlights the critical role that this technology plays in the smooth functioning of coal-related operations and its importance in supporting electricity generation worldwide. Further exploration of the potential implications of minimal to no satellite communication on the coal industry and the subsequent impact on electricity generation will be elaborated upon in subsequent sections of this article. Safeguarding satellite communication systems becomes imperative to ensure the continued stability and reliability of coal-related processes and power generation in an increasingly energy-dependent global landscape. The combined production of energy from nuclear reactors, natural gas and liquid fuels represents a significant portion of total energy, approximately 33.8% Statista Research Department (2023d). Nuclear reactors heavily rely on computer systems to monitor crucial parameters, such as pressure levels, especially in the event of a failure. These monitoring systems depend on satellite communication systems to process and store critical data. Given the potential risks associated with nuclear reactors, including scenarios such as coolant loss and water supply failure Nuclear Energy Agency (2020), effective communication systems are essential for timely response and mitigation efforts in nuclear emergencies. The absence of reliable satellite communication could pose challenges in responding to such emergencies, and in severe cases, it could necessitate permanent reactor shutdowns to prevent meltdowns. Currently, the world has over 400 nuclear reactors Statista Research Department (2023b), making their safety and efficient operation paramount to global energy stability. In addition to nuclear power, natural gas and liquid fuels are crucial energy resources, with numerous countries relying on their import for electricity generation and various other applications. These resources also depend on satellite communication systems for tasks such as mining, efficient operations, and transportation. Any disruption in satellite communication would hinder the prompt and smooth transportation of these gases and fuels, potentially leading to electrical generation constraints in various regions. The interdependence of nuclear reactors, natural gas, and liquid fuels with satellite communication systems underscores the critical role that this technology plays in ensuring reliable energy production and supply. The possibility of a nuclear meltdown due to the minimization or loss of satellite function is an exceptionally rare occurrence. It is vital to emphasize that the nuclear power industry is committed to ensuring the utmost safety and adheres to strict disaster prevention measures. Although we are considering potential risks in this article, it is equally essential to acknowledge the continuous efforts made by the nuclear industry to improve safety and prevent catastrophic events. In the case of a nuclear meltdown, where water supply and essential systems might be affected by a scenario such as Kessler’s Syndrome, nuclear power plants are equipped with 30-day emergency water supplies known as Ultimate Heat Sinks (UHS). These UHS play a critical role in cooling the reactor, even after it has been turned off Union of Concerned Scientists (2010). Although the absence of electricity and communication could make implementing these emergency measures challenging, it is essential to remember that the occurrence of Kessler’s Syndrome is an unlikely event with a low probability of impacting multiple nuclear reactors simultaneously. If, hypothetically, multiple reactors collapse in a short time frame, the release of radiation into the environment could potentially affect a significant portion of the Earth’s surface Lelieveld et al. (2012). However, it is crucial to reiterate that such a scenario is extremely improbable and is based on multiple simultaneous nuclear accidents. In the event of an emergency, nuclear reactors have two systems in place: active and passive Xing et al. (2016). While the active system requires electricity to operate, the passive system operates independently, providing a safety measure even in situations of power loss. The passive system would eventually shut down within a specified time frame, typically between 72 h and 10 days, depending on the facility Giges (2014). As a last resort, submerging nuclear rods in seawater might be considered to cool the reactor. However, such a measure is expensive and would render the nuclear facility temporarily unusable, requiring significant financial investment to rebuild World Nuclear Association (2022). To reiterate, the risk of a global nuclear meltdown simultaneously affecting multiple reactors is remarkably low due to the stringent safety protocols and disaster prevention measures upheld by the nuclear power industry. This section has been included to raise awareness of potential risks and to underscore the industry’s ongoing commitment to safety and the pursuit of alternative forms of energy that could be less hazardous in the event of rare occurrences. The essential services of water, gas and waste disposal are vital for the maintenance of human life and the maintenance of a healthy living environment American Geosciences Institute (2016), U.S. Energy Information Administration (2023a) and The World Counts (2022). Water is a fundamental necessity for every living being on Earth, while gas serves crucial functions in cooking, heating, and various other activities. Water and gas are generally delivered through pipelines to homes, businesses, and industries, while in remote areas, gas can be supplied using containers transported by vehicles American Geosciences Institute (2016) and U.S. Energy Information Administration (2023a). Delivery systems often rely on electric pumps, which, in turn, require electricity to operate efficiently United States Space Force (2022b). Some regions also utilize GNSS time to optimize water and gas distribution to ensure equitable access United States Space Force (2022b). However, in the absence of electricity and a reliable satellite communication system, the supply of water and gas to many households would be severely disrupted. Global statistics indicate that approximately 71% of the population has access to clean water, while approximately 60% has access to clean fuel for cooking Ritchie and Roser (2019) and Ritchie et al. (2022). The loss of supply would significantly affect people’s daily lives and wellbeing. The waste disposal industry is highly dependent on the transportation sector to collect waste from homes and industries and transfer it to waste processing sites. Electricity is essential for waste processing, and in 2022 alone more than 1 billion tons of waste were collected worldwide The World Counts (2022). Without adequate transportation facilities, many households would face difficulties disposing of waste, leading to potential health hazards and environmental concerns Ann (2023). The interruption of these critical services due to the loss of satellite communication systems and electricity highlights the need to protect these technological infrastructures to ensure the smooth functioning of essential utilities. Aside from navigation satellites, there are several other prominent types of satellites, such as communication satellites, Earth observation satellites, and astronomical satellites Sergieieva (2023). Communication satellites aid in long-distance communication by filling the void left by traditional ground-based networks, which primarily support short-distance communication. These communication satellites act as conduits for a variety of media transmissions, including radio, television, phone, and internet services. Earth observation satellites, on the other hand, are divided into two categories: weather satellites and remote sensing satellites. Weather satellites play an important role in a variety of industries, including agriculture, fisheries, and transportation, by predicting and mitigating the effects of adverse weather conditions. Remote sensing satellites Emery and Camps (2017), in turn, make significant contributions to resource exploration and monitoring of phenomena such as floods, droughts, soil moisture, wildfires, vegetation health, forest degradation, road infrastructure surveillance, etc.,. Remote sensing satellites are used in the military to capture high-resolution images of strategic locations, monitor enemy activities, and assess potential threats. Astronomical satellites serve a unique purpose in that they aid in the identification of potential threats to Earth, such as asteroid impacts and solar storms. Modern medicine is heavily dependent on satellite communication for efficient storage and retrieval of patient data, electricity to power medical devices, and transportation for patient and drug mobility. The global burden of disease is significant, with more than 95% of the population affected by various diseases and many individuals experiencing multiple chronic or acute conditions. In Australia, low back pain and depression are prevalent health problems with a substantial impact on individuals Vos (2015). In particular, several major health challenges continue to pose significant threats to global wellbeing. The worldwide prevalence of diabetes is over 500 million people International Diabetes Federation (2021), with approximately 19.3 million people facing cancer Sung (2021) and about 38.4 million living with HIV HIV.gov (2022). Managing these conditions requires meticulous care, and in 2017, more than 50% of patients use health apps to help with their medical management Stewart (2017). Furthermore, an estimated 310 million people undergo surgery annually International Surgical Outcomes Study group (2016). Many other health issues, not mentioned here, can be fatal if not properly treated in a timely manner. The efficient functioning of medical facilities worldwide requires reliable access to electricity and transportation facilities. Without these essential resources, it would be impossible to provide adequate medical treatment to patients, leading to potentially millions or billions of deaths. The rapid advancement of technology has significantly enriched human life, fostering learning and growth while driving progress and prosperity. In recent decades, technological innovations have brought about transformative changes in how our minds and bodies adapt to the modern world Clark (2007). In particular during the COVID-19 lockdown, people turned to technology for entertainment and information, leading to increased dependence on technological means Verbanas (2021). In the United States alone, approximately 30% of adults are active online, highlighting the widespread influence of technology on modern society Verbanas (2021). While technology has facilitated various aspects of life, concerns arise regarding the potential addiction to technology, warranting a critical examination of its impact. It is critical to recognize that the Kessler’s Syndrome has primarily indirect consequences due to modern society’s intricate interdependence. As a result, it is critical to emphasize the potential environmental consequences, including impacts on mankind, if Kessler’s Syndrome event occurs, resulting in partial or complete loss of satellite access. This analysis must also consider how human interventions, or their absence, may alter the environmental landscape and circumstances. As this article progresses, we will explore the implications of minimal to no satellite function on human lifestyle, delving into how the loss of satellite communication systems could gradually or rapidly affect global affairs. The impact of minimizing satellite functions on the digital communication system is a critical concern that demands attention. While the exact timeline of the consequences is uncertain, gradual restrictions on communication services can escalate to the point where effective communication becomes impossible. Such restrictions could trigger panic among people as they experience the effects of reduced satellite communication. Reduction in banking services due to the diminishing capabilities of satellites may exacerbate panic, leading people to rush to stores to buy essential items and stock up with cash, displaying anxiety and panic buying behaviors Leung et al. (2021). The situation could escalate further if complete loss of satellite communication occurs on a global scale. Governments would also face challenges in carrying out special operations effectively without adequate satellite support and might struggle to collaborate with allies to find solutions. Shortfalls in government services and aid could create uncertainty and panic among the population. With limited resources, essential needs such as food, water, and shelter could become scarce, leading to increased crime and unsafe living conditions. The heavy reliance of the modern world on technology could exacerbate mental health concerns, as a significant number of people experience nomophobia and Internet addiction Humood et al. (2021) and Longstreet and Brooks (2017). The occurrence of mental disorders could increase, given the substantial prevalence of such conditions worldwide World Health Organization (WHO) (2022). Basic needs, such as water, food, and shelter, could face significant challenges due to the impacts of minimizing satellite functions. The lack or minimized availability of electricity could also be catastrophic, as demonstrated by studies suggesting that a large proportion of people are not prepared with emergency supplies Bedard (2019) and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (2012). Inadequate healthcare services due to the loss of satellite-dependent technology could lead to a significant increase in fatalities related to poor healthcare quality Kruk (2018). The exact extent and duration of these effects depend on the speed of loss of satellite communication systems and the potential adoption of alternative systems. It is crucial for policymakers and relevant stakeholders to recognize these implications and work towards safeguarding satellite communication to mitigate potential negative outcomes for humanity’s wellbeing and progress. Kessler’s Syndrome, at its extremes, poses a potential threat to humanity and can lead to ecological imbalances in the global ecosystem Weisman (2007). The continuous existence of numerous plant and animal species on Earth is intricately connected to human activities. Human interventions, such as the domestication and genetic modification of various plant species to serve our needs, have shaped the current biodiversity Daru et al. (2021). However, in the event of severe disruptions caused by Kessler’s Syndrome, certain plant species that rely heavily on artificial herbicides and fertilizers for their survival could face rapid extinction without the assistance of humans in delivering those to plants. The sudden removal of insecticides, which are commonly used in agricultural practices, could also trigger a surge in population among insect species. Consequently, this population increase may lead to a corresponding increase in the numbers of insects that eat in the ecosystem, including birds, rodents, reptiles, and others, causing a cascade effect throughout the food chain. The potential consequences of these disruptions on biodiversity and ecological balance are concerning. The loss of certain plant species could have far-reaching impacts on the organisms dependent on them for food and habitat. Furthermore, changes in insect populations could alter the dynamics of predator-prey relationships, leading to unforeseen changes in the composition of ecosystems UF Thompson Earth Systems Institute (2020). As explored earlier in this article, the possibility that Kessler’s Syndrome will occur within the next few decades is a matter of concern. While it may seem improbable, the potential consequences demand our attention, prompting us to consider the scenarios that could unfold if preventive measures are not taken. This section aims to shed light on the likely outcomes if we lack viable solutions to mitigate space debris and prevent Kessler’s Syndrome. Drawing insights from “The Beginner’s Guide to Nation-Building,” a 2007 book Dobbins et al. (2007), a hypothetical concept was introduced to estimate the cost of rebuilding a nation from scratch. Conceptual estimation suggested that rebuilding a nation with a population of 5 million and a per capita GDP of $500 would require $15,000 million. However, it is crucial to acknowledge that this estimate was made in 2007, and such figures are subject to change over the subsequent decades. Furthermore, the idea of rebuilding the entire world from scratch appears daunting and nearly insurmountable given the rapid progress in technology and societal advancements. As the population of space debris grows, it becomes clear that properly addressing this global concern requires a united effort from all nations. Similarly to the global agreement reached on addressing climate change, governments must put aside their differences and work together to find effective solutions to protect our celestial environment Maizland (2022). It is critical for states to choose experts capable of functioning as unbiased facilitators in international negotiations in order to ensure impartial decision-making and prioritize the protection of lives in our planet and its space assets. The allocation of specialized funds for space conservation projects is a critical step in this collaborative effort. These financial commitments should be used to develop space debris mitigation techniques and proactive efforts to avoid the uncontrolled spread of space debris. The formation of a specialized council dedicated to space protection, comprised of representatives from various states, can act as a driving force in the development of international regulations that control space activity. Once these regulations are in place, rigorous enforcement procedures should be put in place that are globally applicable to all space agencies, regardless of national origin or affiliation. Strict sanctions for violators will establish responsibility and serve as a deterrent. The Inter-Agency Space Debris Coordination Committee (IADC) now serves as a policy-making organization aiming to prevent Kessler’s Syndrome. The role and actions of the IADC must be strengthened in order to create worldwide cooperation and collaboration in the reduction of space debris. Nations can actively collaborate with the IADC and other relevant international bodies to adopt more stringent legislation and best practices for space protection. Furthermore, the United Nations (UN) United Nation (UA) (2010) and the 2018 White House Presidential Memorandum The White House (2018) set critical guidelines for space organizations to follow to promote peaceful operation in space and mitigate the problem of rising space debris. These principles include measures such as responsible spacecraft reentry following missions and avoiding space weapons testing, such as Anti-Satellite tests, to mitigate the growing population of space debris. International cooperation is critical to guaranteeing the long-term viability of space activities and the preservation of our future in space. Countries may establish a harmonious and secure environment for space exploration by transcending geopolitical boundaries and taking the role of responsible global citizens. Only through joint dedication and teamwork will we be able to protect the enormous benefits and opportunities that space provides humanity while also limiting the considerable threats posed by space debris and the approaching threat of Kessler’s Syndrome. In addition to policy measures, the implementation of mitigation techniques is crucial to address the current space debris orbiting Earth. These techniques can be categorized into the following. In an effort to address the immediate threat posed by space debris, short-term solutions should prioritize the removal of hazardous debris. Various research efforts have proposed the deorbiting of debris into the Earth’s atmosphere, allowing them to burn upon reentry. Although this approach shows promise as a viable mitigation technique in the short term, it cannot be considered a long-term sustainable solution. The widespread use of lightweight aluminum in spacecraft construction poses a significant concern in this context Mariappan et al. (2020). During reentry, aluminum is converted to aluminum oxide, known as alumina, which could accidently trigger an accidental geoengineering experiment, potentially altering regional climate patterns. Additionally, the presence of aluminum oxide in the atmosphere may have detrimental effects on the ozone layer, possibly causing further depletion Delbert (2021). Given the complexities and limitations of de-orbiting techniques, it is evident that a comprehensive long-term solution is imperative to effectively address the challenge of space debris. The recycling of space debris emerges as a promising long-term sustainable solution to the mitigation of space debris. A conceptual approach proposed by Mariappan et al. (Mariappan et al,. 2019; Mariappan et al., 2020) suggests the recycling of space debris into functional powder by atomizing water. These powders can serve as valuable resources to produce fuel and artificial soil, facilitating the cultivation of plants in space McDowell (2020). By repurposing decommissioned satellites and debris into useful materials to support other space missions, this recycling strategy presents a win-win scenario, promoting environmental sustainability and resource efficiency in space exploration. The scenario of Kessler’s Syndrome, while mostly fictional at this time, represents a potential real threat to humanity if space debris accumulates and disrupts satellite systems in a short time frame. Despite the challenges in accurately predicting the occurrence of such an event, it is essential to consider the potential consequences and the lack of viable solutions at the time. The loss of satellite communication would have far-reaching impacts on various industries, including transportation, banking, energy, and military operations. Furthermore, disruption of the ecological balance, with humans at the top of the food chain, poses serious concerns for our survival. Although humans can attempt to adapt mentally, sudden environmental changes would prove challenging for our physical wellbeing. Therefore, a global effort, similar to the global warming agreement, is necessary to mitigate space debris. Two categories of solutions emerge: short-term and long-term. In the short term, emphasis is placed on deorbiting and burning debris posing immediate threats. Although this technique may address immediate risks, it is not a long-term sustainable solution. The burning of debris could have unintended consequences, such as depletion of the ozone layer, potentially triggering new threats to humanity and the environment. As such, a long-term approach, focusing on recycling, is crucial. Researchers have proposed innovative methods to recycle space debris into useful powders that serve as fuel, artificial soil, and other resources for space missions. By reusing materials from decommissioned satellites, we can achieve cost-effective and sustainable solutions, avoiding further harm to our environment. To safeguard humanity’s future and prevent the potentially catastrophic space-debris apocalypse, the launch of the first space-debris mitigation mission should be a priority. Collaboration between countries and the implementation of effective recycling techniques are vital steps toward ensuring the long-term sustainability and safety of our activities in space. Proactive measures today will determine the course of our future in space exploration and will protect the delicate balance of life on Earth.

                "title": "Understanding the misunderstood Kessler Syndrome - Aerospace America",
                "content": "Irony isn’t just limited to life in 1-g. Last year, a discarded payload adapter from a European Space Agency Vega rocket was orbiting Earth as it had for the past 10 years, when radars showed it had company — a small number of new objects traveling with it. ESA concluded that a “hypervelocity impact” with a piece of debris had broken fragments from the adapter. Here’s the irony: ESA was preparing to dispatch a spacecraft to the adapter to demonstrate a technique for removing such debris, the goal being to reduce the odds of collisions that would make the trash problem worse. The collision “actually shows how much we are running against the clock here,” says Portuguese engineer Tiago Soares. He’s the lead engineer at ESA’s Clean Space office, which helped conceive the planned cleanup demonstration, ClearSpace-1. “We need to have reactive removal services available,” he says. Otherwise, debris could continue colliding with the growing number of spacecraft in orbit, producing more hazardous debris, and “it’s going to be much harder in the future to operate in space. There’ll be a lot more risks of losing satellites or losing a mission.” Soares is referring to the Kessler Syndrome, a term inspired by the 1978 paper, “Collision frequency of artificial satellites: The creation of a debris belt,” in the Journal of Geophysical Research. It was written by Donald Kessler, a researcher in NASA’s Environmental Effects Office at Johnson Space Center in Houston, and a colleague at NASA Johnson, space scientist Burton Cour-Palais. They devised equations to model the distribution of known objects in orbit, predicting how likely they were to collide and create orbital debris over time. My review of the literature and interviews with seven experts ranging from aerospace engineers to planetary scientists to astrodynamacists show that the scientific community hasn’t yet reached a consensus about whether the Kessler Syndrome has begun, or, if it has not begun, how bad it will be when it starts. There is consensus, however, that the basic concept is sound and that the space community needs to clean up its act. For the moment, even the definition of “Kessler Syndrome” is open to debate. As Kessler, who retired decades ago, pointed out in a 2010 paper, it is “an orbital debris term that has become popular outside the professional orbital debris community without ever having a strict definition.” In 2013, the term went mainstream in dramatic fashion in the film “Gravity.” A Russian missile destroys a satellite, spewing debris that collides with a space shuttle orbiter and the International Space Station, causing a cascade of collisions that take out all communications satellites in about 90 minutes. That depiction was “Kessler Syndrome on steroids that defies physics,”says Abhishek Tripathi, director of mission operations at the UC Berkeley Space Sciences Lab. That was one thing that all experts I spoke with agreed on: A Kessler Syndrome cascade is something that, whether it has begun or not, would play out over the course of decades if not centuries, rather than fitting into the runtime of a Hollywood drama. For Tripathi’s part, he doesn’t think the syndrome has begun, and he doubts peaceful space operations will change that. “A lot of things have to go wrong for us to end up in a Kessler Syndrome situation by slowly boiling the frog,” he says, referring to predictions of a slowly unfolding cascade. But: “We have the launch capacity to intentionally cause a Kessler Syndrome if we wanted to.” Specifically, he worries about a nation-state kicking off a space war by knocking out satellites with missiles. As for accidental collisions, meet physicist Mark Matney, whose first boss at NASA was none other than Kessler. Matney works in the Orbital Debris Program Office at NASA Johnson, and perhaps not surprisingly, he can rattle off the worst collisions to date. The most recent serious incident came in 2009 when an Iridium communications satellite and a Russian Cosmos satellite collided, generating some 2,000 pieces of debris at least 10 centimeters in diameter. “I tell people that’s a harbinger of things to come,” Matney says. In his view, Iridium-Cosmos was “the opening move” of the Kessler Syndrome: It is one of several unplanned collisions that have occurred, as Kessler predicted, and debris from Iridium-Cosmos could cause future collisions that grow debris, he warns. It’s difficult, Matney says, to look at orbit right now and say for certain that a cascade is in motion, because of the long time frame over which Kessler Syndrome would play out. “I don’t think it’s acute yet,” he says, but “we’re on a timescale of something like a one in 10 chance each year of another major collision.” He does not take comfort that it’s been 15 years and counting since the last big smashup — even if the gap might seem surprising, considering that today there are some 8,000 operational satellites in space compared to around 1,000 in 2009 and 300 in 1978. There’s also much more debris, in part because of the nation-state actions that Tripathi worries about. India destroyed a satellite with a missile in 2019 to demonstrate an antisatellite weapon, and Russia conducted a similar demonstration in 2021. Together, the two tests generated a little over 1,500 pieces of debris. Following the Russian shootdown, the seven crew members aboard ISS had to temporarily take shelter in their Crew Dragon and Soyuz capsules, in case the station was struck. Regarding satellite proliferation, while there are many more satellites, the company responsible for most of them, SpaceX, places its Starlink satellites in a low orbit so they can naturally deorbit relatively soon — within five or six years, per SpaceX — if they fail. A long gap in time between collisions is not unique. Thirteen years before the Iridium-Cosmos collision, the French CERISE satellite broke up after colliding with a piece of debris from an Ariane 1 rocket. In 1991, the Russian Cosmos 1934 satellite collided with debris and broke up in orbit. Somewhere in the middle in terms of views about Kessler Syndrome is Vishnu Reddy, an Earth and space scientist at the University of Arizona, where he also directs Space4, the university’s space safety, security and sustainability center. He questions the timing, not the plausibility of the Kessler Syndrome. “I think we’re not there yet, but we’re approaching the situation very quickly,” he says. “The debate is about when it will happen, whether it is five years from now, 10 years from now or 20 years from now.” Rather than relying on Kessler’s original mathematics and analysis, the experts are applying newer mathematics and models to simulate how debris and spacecraft interact in orbit — colliding or passing by each other — and how the debris created by collisions or events like the spontaneous explosion of an old rocket motor may increase the odds of further collisions and debris growth. In Massachusetts, Richard Linares, an astrodynamicist and professor at MIT, and his colleagues load the masses, volumes and velocities of known spacecraft and debris into the MIT Orbital Capacity Assessment Tool. MOCAT then calculates the motions of orbital objects forward in time. “We can calculate how many objects are generated from a breakup event” — when an object explodes or disintegrates due to a collision — “and each object will have a size and a mass,” Linares says. “We can probably go up to 20 million objects in our simulation.” MOCAT also runs Monte Carlo algorithms that take the positions and velocities of thousands of objects in orbit, among other information, and create myriad random simulations to show a range of potential future debris scenarios based on various parameters entered by the scientists. These include the number of rockets projected to reach orbit in a given year and a hypothetical number of major collisions between satellites occurring in the next 20 years. “In those models, we see that we could have exponential growth [of debris] if the space traffic is too large,” Linares says. That exponential growth is what could make accessing space a more risky and expensive affair, where certain orbital lanes could become so clogged they are no longer worth trying to operate within. ESA and NASA use similar analytical approaches, ESA with its Debris Environment Long-Term Analysis software and NASA with its LEO-to-GEO Environment Debris software. Soares says ESA’s calculations suggest that orbital debris will continue to grow over the next two centuries even if all rocket launches stopped today. “It would more than double the number of debris in orbit without us sending anything else up there,” he says. In contrast, NASA’s modeling doesn’t predict exponential debris growth, according to Matney, but rather linear growth over the next 200 years — even if launches continue. But things get more complicated when you factor in that LEO isn’t a monolithic expanse, he says, and “in some altitude regions [debris growth] is exponential, some linear.” At around 400 kilometers and into the 500-km realm — home to ISS and the SpaceX Starlink satellites among others — atmospheric drag plays a major role. Dead satellites and debris usually slow and burn up in the atmosphere in just a few years. This natural cleansing process accelerates when the sun becomes more active and solar coronal mass ejections strike Earth and cause the atmosphere to swell. “In those altitudes, we can probably do a lot and we will be forgiven,” Linares says. But this atmospheric drag drops off quickly as one goes higher. By the time you get around 600 km, the altitude of the Hubble Space Telescope, “now you’re talking about decades for things to drag down,” Matney says. “When you get up to 800 or 900 km, we’re now talking about centuries for things to drag down,” he adds. “When we get up to 1,000 km, you’re talking about millennia.” A lot of satellites fly in those higher altitudes already, including some 70 Iridium communications satellites, at least 600 OneWeb broadband internet satellites and NASA’s Earth-observation spacecraft, including Landsat 8 and 9. “If there are collision events,” Linares says, “those altitudes can very quickly turn into a Kessler type of scenario where they grow very rapidly into millions upon millions [of pieces] of debris.” However, humanity would not be “locked in” on Earth in such an event, he says, given that crewed spacecraft headed for deep space would cross the problematic altitudes so quickly. But there are still plausible scenarios that are far from ideal. Linares sees a potential future where “humans probably don’t have any incentive to launch satellites, because we’re losing 50% of them” to collisions with debris, he says. Matney puts it like this: Kessler Syndrome “won’t cause orbital altitudes to be unusable. It’s more like a gradual degradation that’s going to cost everybody more money.” The prospect of losing money leads naturally to the question of just what should be done about orbital debris, and there are two generally agreed-upon major actions to take. “The first step is to make sure that new junk doesn’t get added,” says Reddy, the University of Arizona professor. “The second step is to remove large pieces of junk that have the potential to be the sources of cascading debris events in a Kessler Syndrome scenario.” Not creating new debris is largely a matter of adhering to the rule in the United States and Europe that satellites must not stay in orbit longer than five years after their mission is completed. “It’s the stuff you learn in kindergarten: You clean up your messes; don’t hurt your neighbor,” Matney says. Removing existing space junk could have the biggest impact on the debris curve. “It depends on how much remediation you do, but in principle, it actually flattens it out and starts letting it go down,” he says. That’s why ESA isn’t giving up on ClearSpace-1, or the idea behind the mission. Soares, the lead engineer, notes that ESA had its Copernicus satellites built with interfaces so they can be grabbed and redirected to deorbit should they fail. Eventually, he says, the goal is to build spacecraft that can grapple and remove large objects that pose a major debris hazard, such as ESA’s multiton Envisat, which died in 2012. “It’s not easy because the satellite was not at all designed to be removed,” Soares says. No matter which view of the Kessler Syndrome one adheres to, the risk it describes might not be a fait accompli. “This is a problem that we have the capability and, hopefully, the willpower to solve,” says Matney.

As a piece of spaceborne garbage veered toward the International Space Station in November, the seven astronauts on board braced themselves. A Russian spacecraft attached to the space station lit its engines for five minutes, slightly tweaking the station’s trajectory and moving the football field-size laboratory out of harm’s way. If the space station had not changed course, the debris could have passed within 2 ½ miles (4 kilometers) of its orbital path, according to NASA. Related article ‘Possibility of a catastrophic failure’: Inside the space station leak problem that has NASA worried Debris striking the space station could have spelled disaster. An impact might have depressurized segments of the station and left the astronauts scrambling to return home. What’s more concerning: The potential strike was not all that rare of an occurrence. The International Space Station has had to make similar maneuvers dozens of times since it was first occupied in November 2000, and collision risks are growing every year as the number of objects in orbit around Earth proliferate. For years, space traffic experts have raised alarm bells about the increasing congestion. Earlier collisions, explosions and weapons tests have resulted in tens of thousands of pieces of debris that experts are tracking and possibly millions more that cannot be seen with current technology. And while risks to astronauts may be a top concern, congestion in orbit is also hazardous to satellites and space-based technologies that power our everyday lives — including GPS tools as well as some broadband, high-speed internet and television services. “The number of objects in space that we have launched in the last four years has increased exponentially,” said Dr. Vishnu Reddy, a professor of planetary sciences at the University of Arizona in Tucson. “So we are heading towards the situation that we are always dreading.” The event Reddy referred to is a hypothetical phenomenon called Kessler Syndrome. Named for American astrophysicist Donald Kessler and based on his 1978 academic paper, Kessler Syndrome — as the term is used today — has a muddy definition. But the phrase broadly describes a scenario in which debris in space sets off a chain reaction: One explosion sends out a plume of fragments that in turn smash into other spaceborne objects, creating more detritus. The cascading effect may continue until Earth’s orbit is so clogged with junk that satellites become inoperable and space exploration must come to a grinding halt. Researchers disagree about the current level of risk and when, exactly, congestion in space may reach the point of no return. But there is widespread consensus about one thing: Traffic in space is a serious problem in desperate need of addressing, according to CNN interviews with scientists and space traffic experts. Since the dawn of spaceflight in 1957, there have been more than 650 “break-ups, explosions, collisions, or anomalous events resulting in fragmentation,” according to the European Space Agency. Those incidents have included satellites that have accidentally collided with each other, rocket parts and spacecraft that have unexpectedly exploded, and weapons tests from nations including the United States, Russia, India and China that have spewed detritus across various altitudes in orbit. Russia, for example, launched a missile at one of its own satellites as part of a weapons test in 2021, creating more than 1,500 traceable pieces of debris. The last major accidental collision between two spaceborne objects occurred in February 2009 when a dead Russian military satellite, called Kosmos 2251, rammed into Iridium 33, an active communications satellite operated by US-based telecommunications firm Iridium. That event produced a massive cloud of nearly 2,000 pieces of debris that were nearly 4 inches (10 centimeters) in diameter and thousands of even smaller pieces. Similar events on a smaller scale are also common: a US Air Force weather satellite, for example, broke apart in orbit on December 19, creating at least 50 new pieces of debris, LeoLabs, a company that tracks objects in space, said on Monday. It was only the latest in a string of four “fragmentation” events over the past few months that created more than 300 new pieces of litter. For those managing satellites, congestion in space can be a nightmare. It’s common for a satellite operator to receive a dozen or more alerts per day about potential collisions. The process of tracking objects in orbit — called space situational awareness — involves tracing possible “conjunctions,” or close approaches between two entities. In one incident this year, for example, a NASA weather satellite narrowly missed colliding with a defunct Russian rocket by less than 65 feet (20 meters), according to LeoLabs. Related article Scientists have fiercely debated the existence of ‘Planet 9’ for a decade. Some say evidence is piling up But the risks may be even higher than what space situational awareness can predict. For the most part, an object must be larger than a tennis ball to be tracked. The remaining objects are too small to reflect light or in distant areas of orbit that are difficult to observe directly. “Even with today’s best sensors, there are limits to what can be reliably ‘seen’ or tracked, and smaller space debris is often untrackable,” said Bob Hall, director of special projects at COMSPOC Corp., a space traffic software company. But small objects can still pose significant threats. In orbit, objects whirl around so fast that even a fleck of paint is capable of smashing through metal, according to NASA. That means any piece of junk left in space is deeply concerning — and potentially catastrophic. Exactly how a chain reaction of collisions in space might play out is not clear. Different regions of Earth’s orbit have their own levels of congestion and risk. Low-Earth orbit, which extends to around 1,200 miles (2,000 kilometers ) above the planet’s surface, is by far the most crowded. This area is home to two crewed space stations and massive constellations of satellites that beam internet — such as SpaceX’s network of nearly 7,000 Starlink satellites — monitor weather, observe crop production or analyze the climate. If a ripple of explosions happened in low-Earth orbit, it could threaten astronauts’ lives, halt rocket launches and lead to the destruction of all the satellite technology present there. The good news in this scenario, if there is any, is that disastrous conditions may not last for generations to come: “We still have remnants of atmosphere in the low-Earth orbit, so we have a natural cleaning mechanism,” said Carolin Frueh, an associate professor of aeronautics and astronautics at Purdue University in Indiana. At an altitude of around 300 miles (500 kilometers), objects in orbit will naturally fall back to Earth or disintegrate in the atmosphere within about 25 years, Frueh said, indicating that a debris field at this distance likely would not threaten access to space for generations to come. But the picture changes rapidly at higher orbits. At nearly 500 miles (800 kilometers), it would take at least a century for a piece of debris to be naturally dragged out of space. At more than 621 miles (1,000 kilometers), the process would take thousands of years. Related article Why scientists say we need to send clocks to the moon — soon That’s bad news for geosynchronous orbit — a region about 22,236 miles (35,786 kilometers) from Earth’s surface — which is home to quarter-billion-dollar communications satellites that beam TV and other services to broad swaths of the globe. “The most dangerous place where this (Kessler Syndrome-like event) could happen is in GEO,” said Reddy, the University of Arizona researcher. “Because we have no way of cleaning it up in a quick way.” The 2013 movie “Gravity” brought the idea of Kessler Syndrome to the big screen: A Russian missile strike on a dead satellite initiates a cascade of collisions, generating a cloud of junk that devastates other satellites and spacecraft. But while the drama in “Gravity” unfolded over an hour and a half, a real-life Kessler Syndrome scenario would likely take years — or decades — to play out, experts said. And since the film’s release more than a decade ago, congestion in orbit has rapidly increased: The US military was tracking about 23,000 objects then compared with 47,000 objects today. Though there are ongoing efforts to calculate where, when and how a ripple effect might kick off, it’s an impossible task, Purdue’s Frueh said. “As soon as we’re predicting into the future, we have to make assumptions,” Frueh said. “Every model is wrong — (but) some are useful.” Models are inaccurate because even experts do not have a pristine picture of where objects are in orbit. Objects smaller than about 4 inches (10 centimeters) are largely invisible. What’s more, space weather can change orbital trajectories — so it’s difficult to predict exactly how and where debris is traveling, according to Dr. Thomas Berger, director of the University of Colorado’s Space Weather Technology, Research, and Education Center. Berger spoke on the topic on December 11 at the American Geophysical Union’s annual meeting in Washington, DC. The size and shape of spaceborne garbage pieces are also a mystery. So, to model a single Kessler Syndrome effect, analysts would have to guess exactly how a satellite would break apart, how each piece of that debris would look, where it would travel and what other object it might hit next. “What keeps me up,” said Dan Oltrogge, chief scientist and director of COMSPOC Corp.’s Center for Space Standards and Innovation, “is that the data is not accurate enough to allow you to actually avoid the thing you think you’re avoiding.” Given that “Kessler Syndrome” is not an instantaneous event, scientists are debating whether the phenomenon could already be in motion. Kessler’s thought experiment asks researchers to consider whether — even if all rocket launches ceased — collisions in space would still escalate the number of objects in orbit. And it’s not clear if that point has been reached. The researchers interviewed for this story offered differing perspectives on whether events indicative of Kessler Syndrome had already kicked off. But Frueh said that’s why she no longer believes Kessler Syndrome is a useful term. “I think it’s confusing for the public that different entities do not agree,” she said. “The concept itself is just not as clean and crisp as you would think.” Related article Chinese rocket breaks apart in low-Earth orbit, creating a cloud of space debris, US Space Command says What experts do seem to agree on is that the situation in orbit is problematic. None said that they believed disaster could certainly be avoided. More likely, they said, the garbage in orbit will continue to proliferate. Frueh said, “I’m pessimistic … that we will act timely enough to not have economic damage in the process.” Dr. Nilton Renno, a professor of climate and space sciences and engineering at the University of Michigan, said that he is optimistic by nature. But the situation in Earth orbit reminds him of the ecological woes underway here on our home planet. “The analogy that I like to think about space debris is plastic in the oceans,” he said. “We used to think that the oceans are infinite, and we throw in trash and plastic, and now we realize — no, those are finite resources. And we are causing huge damage if we are not careful about what we do.” There are two big considerations when talking about preventing the proliferation of debris in Earth’s orbit. One is cleanup technology: Companies and government initiatives are seeking to develop ways to drag debris out of orbit, such as the Drag Augmentation Deorbiting Subsystem, or ADEO, developed by the European Space Agency and tech company High Performance Space Structure Systems, or HPS GmbH. The prototype braking sail was successfully deployed from the ION satellite in December 2022, according to ESA. The sail technology “provides a passive method of deorbiting by increasing the atmospheric surface drag effect,” an ESA release said, with the aim of causing a defunct satellite to descend more quickly and burn up in Earth’s atmosphere debris-free. These methods, however, are experimental and exceedingly expensive, Renno noted. And it’s not clear who would be willing to pay for them. The second consideration is regulation. Space policy experts have for years traced efforts to adopt new international guidelines or national laws aimed at preventing space companies or bad actors from acting irresponsibly. There are some efforts in the works. In September, the United Nations adopted the Pact for the Future. The document, adopted by member states, includes an intention for nations to “discuss the establishment of new frameworks for space traffic, space debris and space resources through the Committee on the Peaceful Uses of Outer Space.” The language appears nebulous, and space policy experts point out that the United Nations has no means of enforcement. Perhaps more practical, Renno said, is for individual nations to adopt laws for space stakeholders. And he believes the United States should take a leadership role in that process. The University of Arizona’s Reddy agreed. “I think the biggest concern is the lack of regulation,” he said. “I think having some norms and guidelines that (are) put forward by the industry will help a lot.” Enable Javascript to view this content This is usually found in your web browser's settings © 2024 Cable News Network.

                "content": "The Arkansas Razorbacks football program represents the University of Arkansas in the sport of American football. The Razorbacks compete in the Football Bowl Subdivision (FBS) of the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) and is a member of the Southeastern Conference (SEC). Home games are played at stadiums on or near the two largest campuses of the University of Arkansas System: Donald W. Reynolds Razorback Stadium in Fayetteville and War Memorial Stadium in Little Rock. Sam Pittman is the head coach and has served since 2020. The program began in 1894 and has compiled an all-time record of 740–539–40, for a .576 winning percentage. The Razorbacks have won 13 conference championships and have had 58 players honored as All-Americans. Arkansas claims one national championship (1964) awarded by the Football Writers Association of America (FWAA). The first University of Arkansas football team was formed in 1894 and coached by John Futrall, who was a Latin professor at the university.[3] That team played three games: two against Fort Smith High School and one against Texas.[3] Before the 1909 season, the teams were called the Arkansas Cardinals and a bird was the school's mascot.[4] The name and mascot changed following the 1909 season when the football team, coached by Hugo Bezdek, finished 7–0.[5] The Cardinals became the Razorbacks after Arkansas defeated LSU 7–0, and coach Bezdek told a group of reporters after the game that his team played like a \"wild band of Razorback hogs\". The name stuck, and the student body voted to change the mascot.[6][7] The \"Wooo Pig Sooie\" or \"Calling The Hogs\" became a tradition and the official school cheer in the 1920s when farmers rushing out to meet the bus returning from an away game called the hogs as a greeting.[8][9][10] Arkansas prevailed over powerhouses Oklahoma, LSU and Washington University in St. Louis in 1909, and was declared unofficial champions of the South and Southwest.[3] It was with the help of Steve Creekmore that this was accomplished. Creekmore became perhaps the first Razorback star, a quarterback from Van Buren who initially played only intramurals.[3] Bezdek used Creekmore to install a very early edition of the hurry-up offense, as the team never huddled and chased the ball after every play.[3] Creekmore was also known for \"fast and slippery running, blocking, and passing\" and could also return punts and tackle well.[3] There are differing stories about the origins of the 'Razorbacks' mascot, however. The Texarkana Arkansas High School mascot and athletic emblem is the Razorback with red and white serving as the school colors. The Razorback mascot was selected in 1910 to replace the Cardinal as the University of Arkansas mascot. In exchange for its use, the university provided used athletic gear to Texarkana Arkansas High; this practice is no longer used. With the new name and mascot, the Hogs defeated LSU 51–0 and gave Texas A&M their only loss in 1910, but fell short of another perfect season, losing 5–0 to Kansas State.[11] In 1913, Arkansas quarterback J. L. Carter and the Razorbacks lost to Ole Miss, and took a fateful train to Arkadelphia to play Ouachita Baptist. While Carter was eating, he was invited to a meeting of Ouachita boosters. He transferred (which took place immediately, this being permissible at the time) and defeated Arkansas 15–9 in 1914.[3] The Hogs would be contacted by L. Theo Bellmont in 1913 in his attempt to create an intercollegiate conference to regulate use of ringers.[12] Hugo Bezdek, since replaced by E. T. Pickering, had recommended that the Hogs join a conference before he left to coach at Oregon.[13] The Razorbacks joined the Southwest Conference (SWC) as charter members in 1915.[14] The conference also included teams from Texas (Baylor, Rice, Texas, Texas A&M) and Oklahoma (Oklahoma, Oklahoma A&M).[15] Southwestern (TX) would also join, but leave the following year.[16] The 1916, 1917, and 1919 teams were led at quarterback by \"Arkansas' greatest athlete\" Gene Davidson.[17] The Razorbacks didn't have a winning conference record until 1920, and didn't win the conference championship until 1936. Arkansas had the best record during the 1933 season, but had to forfeit the SWC Championship because Ulysses \"Heine\" Schleuter, who had no eligibility remaining, played on the team.[18] Schleuter had told coach Fred Thomsen that he was eligible, but he was recognized by an SMU player during the game as a former Cornhusker.[18] The Hogs did accept an invitation to the 1934 Dixie Classic, a precursor to today's Cotton Bowl Classic.[19] Arkansas became rivals with Ole Miss due to proximity. Although not SWC members, Ole Miss played Arkansas intermittently until a yearly series began from 1952–1961. During the 1938 season, the Razorbacks replaced their 300-seat stadium known as The Hill with Bailey Stadium, named after Arkansas governor Carl Bailey.[20] It was known as University Stadium for one game before being changed to honor the governor.[21] This stadium still exists today, although heavily renovated, as Donald W. Reynolds Razorback Stadium, the current home of the Razorbacks.[21] Arkansas won the conference championship in 1946,[22] earning a bid in the 1947 Cotton Bowl Classic with LSU.[23] The game would become known as the Ice Bowl, as a winter storm hit Dallas before the game.[24] The two rivals battled to a scoreless tie, with Razorback great Clyde Scott tackling an LSU Tiger at the one yard-line to preserve the tie on the second-to-last play of the game.[23] LSU would fail to complete the field goal attempt on the next play.[24] The Razorbacks defeated William & Mary the next year in the 1948 Dixie Bowl.[25] In 1954, the Ole Miss rivalry would catch fire. The Hogs played the Rebels in War Memorial Stadium on October 23, 1954.[26] The Rebels were ranked No. 5 by the AP Poll entering the game, and Arkansas was picked to finish last in the SWC.[27] The contest would be decided by a 66-yard halfback pass from tailback Buddy Bob Benson to blocking back Preston Carpenter, the only score of the game. This is referred to as the Powder River Play, and \"perhaps the most important in Arkansas football history to that time\" by Orville Henry, a member of the 1954 team.[28] The Hogs would get back to the Cotton Bowl Classic in 1954, only to be defeated by Georgia Tech.[29] Future Arkansas head coach Frank Broyles was an assistant under Yellowjackets head coach Bobby Dodd in the game.[30] The 1954 season was all the more impressive when it is considered that the team only had twenty-five players on the squad. That team, dubbed the \"25 Little Pigs\" and coached by Bowden Wyatt, finished 8-3 and won the Southwest Conference championship. During this period, Arkansas developed rivalries with Texas and Texas A&M because of their intense conference match-ups.[31][32][33][34] Missouri head coach Frank Broyles was hired as the Razorbacks head football coach in 1957 and served in that position for 19 years.[35] Arkansas would grow into a national power with Broyles at the helm, including several conference championships and a national title.[36] Arkansas would earn a share of the 1959 SWC Championship, splitting with Texas.[37] Arkansas lost only to No. 3 Texas and No. 6 Ole Miss during the season.[38] The Hogs went to Jacksonville and defeated Georgia Tech in the 1960 Gator Bowl 14–7, avenging an earlier Cotton Bowl Classic defeat.[39] Barry Switzer was a co-captain on the team.[40] Some, including University Chancellor and student during 1958, John White,[41] view the Razorback football team during this period as a revival of Arkansas, which was recovering from the Little Rock Nine and racial segregation problems.[41] The 1960s was the best decade in Arkansas football history.[42] 1960 brought another SWC crown, and a Cotton Bowl Classic invitation for the Hogs, who were ranked as high as 7th during the season.[43] The Razorbacks lost to No. 2 Ole Miss and No. 20 Baylor, but defeated No. 11 Texas in Austin, bringing the championship to Fayetteville.[44] The Hogs lost to Duke, 7–6, because of a blocked extra point.[45] The following season brought another shared SWC championship with Texas.[46] The Hogs were defeated by the Longhorns 33–7,[31][47][48] as well as the No. 9 Ole Miss Rebels,[49] warranting an invitation to New Orleans, Louisiana, for the Sugar Bowl.[50] No. 1 Alabama defeated the Razorbacks 10–3.[51] The Crimson Tide had been declared national champions before the game, which was the procedure at the time. The Hogs would fight this system in 1964, when the same Alabama team would claim the 1964 AP crown before losing the Orange Bowl to the Texas Longhorns, a team Arkansas defeated in Austin, Texas, during the regular season.[52] Arkansas won the Cotton Bowl Classic over Nebraska, 10–7.[53] Broyles' team was awarded the 1964 National Championship by the Football Writers Association of America and the Helms Athletic Foundation.[54][55] The FWAA and HAF awarded their national championships to Arkansas, who was the only team to go undefeated through the bowl games that year. At the time, the Associated Press (AP) and UPI awarded their national titles before the bowl games, and gave their trophies to the Alabama team that would lose in the Orange Bowl game a few days later.[56] The next season, 1965, the Razorbacks were 10–0 in the regular season, and were once again the Southwest Conference Champions.[57] That sent the Razorbacks back to the Cotton Bowl Classic on New Year's Day, this time to play against LSU.[58] Because of the controversy in determining the national champions in 1964, the AP poll would wait until after the bowl games to announce its champion. With top-ranked Michigan State losing in the Rose Bowl,[59] the No. 2 Razorbacks had a chance to become national champions, but were defeated 14–7 by the Tigers.[60] Arkansas would return to the field in 1966 ranked fifth, but losses against unranked Baylor and Texas Tech would prevent the 8–2 Hogs from playing in a bowl game.[61] Loyd Phillips was a consensus All-American defensive tackle on the team.[62] Phillips also took home the Outland Trophy.[63] After struggling to a 4–5–1 record in 1967,[64] the Hogs went 10–1 and returned to the postseason in 1968.[65] No. 9 Arkansas defeated No. 2 Georgia in the Sugar Bowl, 16–2.[66] Sophomore receiver Chuck Dicus scored the only touchdown of the game for the Razorbacks.[67][68] In 1969, the Razorbacks had another chance to claim the national title, when No. 2 Arkansas played the No. 1 Texas Longhorns, coached by Darrell Royal, at Razorback Stadium in Fayetteville, Arkansas.[69] The game, known as \"The Big Shootout\" or the Game of the Century, is perhaps the most notable football game in Razorbacks history.[70] Arkansas led 14–0 at after three quarters, but Texas stormed back and took a 15–14 lead on a two-point conversion, after a questionable passing play was called late in the game by then coach Frank Broyles, which was intercepted by Texas.[71] President Richard Nixon was in attendance, and proclaimed Texas the national champions, even though they had a bowl game to play, and Penn State was also undefeated.[69][72] Arkansas lost to Ole Miss in the Sugar Bowl, 27–22, and Texas beat Notre Dame in the Cotton Bowl Classic for the national title.[73] The 1970s brought more success for Broyles, led by Razorback standouts Chuck Dicus and Ben Cowins.[74][75][76] The 1970 Razorbacks would go 9–2, with the nine consecutive wins bookended by losses in the opener to No. 10 Stanford and the finale to No. 1 Texas.[77] The 1971 Razorbacks went 8–3–1, including upset wins over No. 7 Cal and No. 10 Texas.[78] They were invited to the Liberty Bowl, but lost to No. 9 Tennessee 14–13.[79] The 1972–1974 seasons would be mediocre, as Arkansas struggled to defeat the Texas teams.[80][81][82] The Hogs went 11–8–2 against schools in Texas, but failed to beat the University of Texas during the span. The highlight of the period was an upset of No. 5 USC in War Memorial Stadium in 1974.[83] Broyles would win his seventh and final Southwest Conference championship in 1975. The contest with Texas A&M was moved until the end of the year, as it was expected to decide the Southwest Conference championship. The Razorbacks did not disappoint, as Arkansas defeated No. 2 Texas A&M, 31–6, in War Memorial Stadium. The win forced the Aggies to share the conference championship with Texas and Arkansas. However, the tie-breaker went to Arkansas, thus Arkansas received the invitation to the Cotton Bowl Classic. The Cotton Bowl Classic berth would also be Broyles' last appearance. Arkansas would fall behind Georgia early on in that game, but came roaring back to beat the Bulldogs easily, 31–10. Arkansas finished with a 10–2 record and finished ranked No. 7 in the AP and No. 6 in the UPI that season.[84] Broyles coached the Razorbacks in 1976, but with limited success, compiling a 5–5–1 record.[85] Broyles retired as Arkansas head coach following the 1976 season,[86] but served as the university's athletics director until December 31, 2007.[87][88] He is now arguably one of the best college football coaches to coach Arkansas. After Broyles left coaching and became athletic director at Arkansas, he hired New York Jets head coach Lou Holtz to take his former position.[89] Holtz served as head football coach from 1977 through the 1983 season. Holtz led the Razorbacks through a 10–1 regular season in 1977, losing only to No. 2 Texas.[90] The No. 6 Hogs were invited to play in the Orange Bowl against No. 2 Oklahoma.[91] The Sooners had a chance to become national champions with a win over the shorthanded Razorbacks, who had suffered a season-long rash of injuries and player suspensions. Prior to Christmas, the university announced that star running back Ben Cowins, leading receiver Donny Bobo, and back-up running back Michael Forrest would all be sent back to Fayetteville.[92][93] Following the suspensions, numerous African-American players on the team threatened to boycott the game.[94][95] The always-quotable Holtz said two days before the game, \"I'm one step short of suicide\".[93] The Razorbacks found an unlikely hero in Roland Sales, who rushed for 205 yards on 23 carries and two scores.[96] Sales also led the Hogs in receiving in the contest.[97] In addition, Holtz used third-string running back Randy Richey, who added 98 rushing yards and a touchdown on only 5 carries. The Hogs ended the Sooners' hope with a 31–6 victory.[60] This game is notable as one of the biggest upsets in Razorback football history. Ironically, University of Arkansas alumnus Barry Switzer coached the Sooners in the contest, and late in the game, future Arkansas head coach Houston Nutt played quarterback for Holtz.[98] Arkansas finished the season 11-1 and was selected as a co-national champion for the 1977 season by the Rothman Foundation for the Analysis of Competitions and Tournaments (Rothman (FACT)), along with Notre Dame and Texas, but the university does not claim this title.[99][100][101] In 1978, the Razorbacks went 9–2 during the regular season, losing back-to-back games at No. 8 Texas and No. 11 Houston.[102] A 49–7 win over No. 16 Texas A&M did give the Hogs a Fiesta Bowl berth,[103] but the Razorbacks and UCLA Bruins would battle to a 10–10 tie, as the Razorbacks finished 9–2–1.[104] In 1979, Holtz's Razorbacks won a share of the Southwest Conference (sharing with Houston). The 10–2 Hogs[105] defeated nemesis No. 2 Texas in Little Rock,[106] but lost an outright conference title to No. 6 Houston in Fayetteville.[107] Earning a bid to the Sugar Bowl, the No. 6 Hogs were set to play No. 2 Alabama with a chance at the national championship.[108] Instead, Alabama defeated the Razorbacks 24–9, winning their sixth claimed national title.[60] The Razorbacks would continue to succeed under Holtz, winning the 1980 Hall of Fame Classic following the 1980 regular season[109] and defeating No. 1 Texas by a score of 42–11 in 1981.[110] Despite winning the 1982 Bluebonnet Bowl over the Florida Gators and finishing 9–2–1 in 1982,[111] a 6–5 season in 1983[112] would be the end of the Holtz era.[113] At the time, athletic director Frank Broyles stated that Holtz had resigned and was not fired, but two decades later Broyles acknowledged that Holtz was indeed fired because his actions were negatively affecting the fan base.[114] Holtz would subsequently be hired by Minnesota.[115] Reports also cited his political involvement as a major reason for his firing: controversy arose over his having taped two television advertisements from his coach's office endorsing the re-election of Jesse Helms as Senator from North Carolina at a time when Helms was leading the effort to block Martin Luther King Day from becoming a national holiday.[116][117] Holtz left the program with a mark of 60–21–2.[118] His teams reached six consecutive bowls (1977–1982), but only won one split conference championship. Holtz used a very conservative option offense.[119] Ken Hatfield replaced Holtz in 1984. Hatfield played defensive back for Broyles on the 1964 national championship team, and was an All-American punt returner. It was Hatfield's punt return for a touchdown that beat No. 1 Texas in Austin in 1964 that propelled that team to finish undefeated. Hatfield finished his six-year tenure at Arkansas with a record of 55–17–1 and won back-to-back Southwest Conference titles in 1988 and 1989, Hatfield's last two years, and to date the Razorbacks' most recent conference championships. Hatfield would win seventy-six percent of his games at Arkansas, which is still a record today. He coached three teams to ten-win seasons in 1985, 1988, and 1989, and his 1986 and 1987 teams won nine games. But Hatfield was not successful in bowl games, only winning one (1985 Holiday Bowl) out of six. Hatfield was also criticized for being too conservative in the play-calling of his flexbone offense, with many fans noting that the team only threw three passes the entire game in a 16–14 loss to Texas in 1987, when the Longhorns scored a touchdown on the last play of the game to upset Arkansas. The Hatfield-led Razorbacks also lost to Texas in 1985 by a score of 15–13, when the Texas placekicker successfully made all five of his field goal attempts, but the Arkansas kicker missed two of four attempts. Hatfield would switch to the option-I formation prior to the 1989 season. Hatfield was also criticized for finishing with a losing record against Texas, going 2–4, with both victories on the road in Austin, Texas. Despite this success, Hatfield had a somewhat frosty relationship with Broyles, and lost out on several key recruits when other coaches spread rumors that he was in Broyles' doghouse. When Broyles signed a new five-year contract as athletic director, Hatfield abruptly resigned less than two weeks after losing the 1990 Cotton Bowl Classic with a ten-win team to accept the head coaching post at Clemson without ever visiting the Clemson campus before taking the job.[120][121] Hatfield would go on to coach Clemson for four years, winning two bowl games and an ACC championship in 1991, before leaving to coach the Rice Owls for twelve seasons and winning a share of the SWC championship in 1994. During this period, Broyles engineered Arkansas' move from the Southwest Conference to the Southeastern Conference (SEC), effective with the 1992 season.[122] When Hatfield announced he was leaving for Clemson, Broyles was in a difficult situation. Not only was there nowhere near enough time to find a big-name coach, but National Signing Day was only three weeks away. Broyles persuaded Jack Crowe, who had just come to Fayetteville as offensive coordinator, to drop his initial plans to follow Hatfield to Clemson and take over as head coach of the Razorbacks. The decision came as something of a surprise, since Crowe had only won five games in two seasons at Livingston University in the late 1970s. By the start of the season, the Razorbacks had seen Barry Foster give up his senior season to enter the 1990 NFL draft and had lost numerous other players to disciplinary and academic problems. Under the circumstances, the Razorbacks struggled to a 3–8 record–their first losing season since 1967, and only their fifth sub-.500 record since the 1950s. They barely qualified for a bowl in 1991.[121] The Razorbacks opened the 1992 season—their first in the Southeastern Conference—with an upset loss to a Division I-AA team, The Citadel. The next day, Broyles announced that Crowe had resigned and that defensive coordinator Joe Kines would coach the Razorbacks for the rest of the season.[123] However, Crowe's lawyer subsequently told Sports Illustrated that Crowe had been fired, and Broyles admitted that he'd fired Crowe due to concern that the fans no longer had confidence in him.[121] He finished 9–15 in two seasons and one game in Fayetteville.[124] Joe Kines brought Danny Ford to Arkansas in 1992 to help with the clean-up following Frank Broyles' firing of Jack Crowe (Ford's former offensive coordinator at Clemson) after a loss to the Citadel. This immediately led to speculation that Ford would be named head coach on a permanent basis. The speculation bore fruit after the season, when Ford was named head coach. He led Arkansas to its first SEC West championship in 1995 on the legs of Madre Hill and the defensive genius of Joe Lee Dunn, after emerging from two years under Crowe. However, this was one of only two winning seasons the Razorbacks notched during Ford's tenure. Broyles fired Ford following back-to-back 4–7 campaigns. Ford finished 26–30–1 in five seasons with the Razorbacks.[125] It was ironic that Ford ended up at Arkansas, since his replacement at Clemson was former Razorback head coach Ken Hatfield, who had had his own falling out with Arkansas athletic director Frank Broyles. Hatfield took the Clemson job in January 1990, less than a week after Ford resigned, without even visiting the campus. Ford proved to be a solid recruiter, as his replacement at Arkansas, Houston Nutt, went on to win 17 games in the 1998 (9–3) and 1999 (8–4) seasons combined, to include a 1998 SEC West co-championship and a Cotton Bowl championship on January 1, 2000, with a victory over Texas. Both of those squads were made up primarily of players Ford had recruited to Arkansas. On December 10, 1997, Boise State head coach Houston Nutt was hired by the University of Arkansas to succeed Danny Ford.[126] Upon his arrival at Arkansas, Nutt invigorated the Hog fan base with his enthusiasm and high energy.[127] Under Nutt, the Razorbacks were one of three SEC schools to play in three New Year's Day bowls within five years. Nutt's teams were noted for a series of overtime games, including the two longest overtime games in NCAA history. Off the field, some of Nutt's players were named to the SEC Academic Honor Roll 145 times[128] and he has established a reputation as a responsible coach academically.[129] Nutt received some criticism for a SEC win–loss record that was just barely over .500 and because he calls his own offensive plays during a game instead of relying on an offensive coordinator.[130] In his first six seasons, Nutt led the team to a bowl game each year and averaged eight wins per season.[130] Nutt's Razorbacks were picked to finish last in the Southeastern Conference Western Division in 1998 but ended up with a 9–3 record and a share of the division title.[131] The Razorbacks lost to the eventual national champion Tennessee Volunteers on Tennessee's home field after quarterback Clint Stoerner fumbled while trying to run out the clock. For their efforts, the Razorbacks received their first-ever invitation to the Citrus Bowl and ended the season ranked No. 16 after losing to Michigan.[132][133][134] Nutt was selected as the Football News' National Coach of the Year.[135] In 1999, Nutt's Razorbacks were picked to win the SEC Western Division, but suffered a series of setbacks during the season. They recovered to defeat nationally ranked Tennessee and Mississippi State to earn a Cotton Bowl Classic bid versus arch-rival Texas.[136] The Razorbacks defeated Texas 27–6,[137] becoming the first team to ever hold Texas to negative rushing yards in a game.[138] The Cotton Bowl victory propelled Arkansas into the top 20 to end the season. The 2000 season saw the Razorbacks lose the core of their team and suffer a string of injuries, including season-ending injuries to all of the starting running backs. The Razorbacks struggled throughout the season until the final two games when they defeated ranked Mississippi State and LSU teams to pull out another winning record and a Las Vegas Bowl appearance.[139] In the 2001 season, the Razorbacks started off with three straight losses in SEC play. On November 3, 2001, Arkansas defeated Ole Miss 58–56 in 7 overtimes, a record for the longest college football game at the time.[140] The Rebels, led by freshman quarterback Eli Manning, took their second loss of the 2001 season after failing to complete a 4-yard Two-point conversion in the seventh OT period.[141] \"It was gladiator-like,\" Nutt said after the game. \"TD after TD. Two points after two points.\"[142] They then came back to win six of the last seven including victories over ranked South Carolina and Auburn teams. Based on this performance, the Razorbacks were selected to return to the Cotton Bowl Classic to face the defending national champion Oklahoma Sooners. Arkansas lost, gaining only 50 yards of total offense and just six first downs. Nutt was named SEC coach of the year by the Associated Press and by the SEC coaches.[143] In 2002, Nutt's Razorbacks stumbled midway through the season but pulled together five straight wins, including a last second touchdown pass against LSU,[144] often referred to as the \"Miracle on Markham\"[145] to pull out a share of a Western Division title. Arkansas was defeated by the Georgia Bulldogs in the SEC Championship Game[146] and ended the season with a loss to Minnesota in the Music City Bowl.[147][148] In 2003, Nutt's team started off with a 4–0 record including a win against No. 5 Texas on their home field. The early season success raised fan expectations sky-high and put Nutt under intense pressure when the Razorbacks lost their next three games, putting them out of contention for the national championship or even the SEC Western Division crown. The Razorbacks won four of their final five games and defeated Missouri in the Independence Bowl.[149] After the 2003 season, Nebraska was rumored to be courting Nutt to be their head coach, after the firing of Frank Solich.[150] The 2004 and 2005 campaigns were widely expected to be rebuilding years due to young teams. The 2004 season ended with a 5–6 record and without a bowl invitation for the first time under Nutt.[151] The 2005 season was also a rebuilding year as expected.[152] Tough losses to USC (70–17) as well as to Vanderbilt and South Carolina showed that the season had been predicted accurately. The team was ineligible for a bowl for the second season in a row (and the second season overall under coach Nutt). This led to Razorback fans calling for coaching changes. After meeting with Frank Broyles (athletic director) at the conclusion of the season, coaching changes were made by Nutt in the offseason at the risk of being fired, the most notable of which was the forced addition of Gus Malzahn, previously the head coach at Springdale High School in Springdale, Arkansas, as offensive coordinator.[153] The hiring of Malzahn allowed Nutt to sign several highly recruited Springdale players, including Springdale High School quarterback Mitch Mustain and wide receiver Damian Williams who eventually transferred to USC.[154][155] The 2006 season began with a new offensive coordinator in Malzahn. The Razorbacks started the season losing 50–14, at a home game in Fayetteville, to USC. Following the loss to the Trojans, Nutt announced that Mustain would replace Robert Johnson as the Hogs' starting quarterback. Mustain led Arkansas to eight straight wins, including wins against No. 22 Alabama at home and No. 2 Auburn at Auburn, before losing the starting job to Casey Dick. Dick had been slotted to start at the beginning of the season but was unable to do so due to a back injury suffered in the spring. Dick led the Razorbacks to two victories out of four for a total of 10 wins, including a win over No. 13 Tennessee. The Razorbacks moved to No. 7 in the BCS standings. However, the Hogs lost their last regular season game to the No. 8 LSU Tigers, 31–26. Despite the loss, the Hogs were still Western Division Champions of the SEC, and played the 11–1, fourth-ranked Florida Gators for the SEC Championship. Florida won, 38–28. The Razorbacks then lost to the No. 5 Wisconsin Badgers on New Year's Day, 2007 in the Capital One Bowl. A highlight of the season was the second-place finish of sophomore tailback Darren McFadden in the Heisman Trophy voting. Nutt was named SEC coach of the year by the Associated Press and by the SEC coaches for the second time. The Razorbacks finished the season at 10–4.[156] The 2007 season began with the Razorbacks ranked No. 21 by the AP Poll. The Hogs opened at home with a victory over Troy. However, early losses to Alabama and Kentucky knocked Arkansas out of the rankings and made the remaining SEC schedule an uphill struggle, even with Darren McFadden, Felix Jones, and Peyton Hillis in the Razorback backfield.[157] Fan frustration boiled over to some fans wearing all black T-shirts with anti-Nutt statements and buying an entire page in a local Little Rock newspaper calling for Nutt to be fired. A non-official flyover was made hours before the Auburn home game with a small airplane holding a banner, which read: \"Fire Houston Nutt. Players and fans deserve better.\" On November 23, 2007, in Baton Rouge, Nutt's Razorbacks beat the top-ranked football team in the nation on the road.[158][159] In a game that lasted three overtimes, Arkansas defeated eventual national champion LSU Tigers, 50–48, returning the Golden Boot back to Arkansas.[160] Arkansas finished the season with an 8–5 record.[161] Three days later, Nutt resigned as head coach of the Arkansas Razorbacks amid several controversies and rumors,[162] which had come prior to and throughout the 2007 season.[163][164] He left the school with a 75–48 record,[165] which is second on the school's all-time win list, behind only Frank Broyles.[166] On December 11, 2007, former Louisville head coach Bobby Petrino came to Arkansas from the NFL's Atlanta Falcons to become the Razorbacks' 31st head coach.[167][168] Petrino was regarded as an up-and-coming college coach who, despite his failed 11-month stint with the Falcons, had led Louisville to 41 wins in 50 games and was regarded as one of the nation's brilliant offensive minds, employing a spread hybrid offense.[169][170][171] Hired by newly hired athletic director Jeff Long, Petrino signed a five-year contract worth $2.85 million per year with the university administration.[172] The 2008 season was expected to be a transition year for the team and Petrino.[173] Though eliminated from bowl contention, Petrino led the Razorbacks to a last-second victory over rival and defending national champions LSU[174] (nicknamed the Miracle on Markham II)[175] to finish the season 5–7 and a conference mark of 2–6.[176] Petrino's 2009 Razorbacks made dramatic improvement.[177][178] Led by Michigan transfer Ryan Mallett at quarterback,[179] the Razorbacks nearly defeated the Tim Tebow-led Florida Gators, who were ranked No. 1 in the country at that time, in Gainesville, Florida.[180] The Hogs went on to win the 2010 Liberty Bowl against East Carolina[181] and finish with a record of 8–5.[182] The 2010 Arkansas Razorbacks improved on their 2009 record and won six in a row to end the year after earlier losses to Alabama and Auburn.[183][184] Arkansas finished the season 10–2 overall and earned a BCS bowl berth,[185] the first in Arkansas history.[186][187] The Razorbacks lost the Sugar Bowl in New Orleans against the sixth ranked Ohio State Buckeyes by a score of 31–26.[188] Though the result was later vacated by the NCAA as a result of sanctions against Ohio State,[189] the game was the first game ever played between the two teams.[190] Under Petrino's tutelage, quarterback Ryan Mallett broke numerous school passing records in 2010 as well.[191][192] On December 11, 2010, Petrino received a seven-year contract extension from the University of Arkansas administration.[193][194] In 2011, the reins were handed to Tyler Wilson after Mallett went to the NFL.[195] Wilson picked up where Mallett left off, and Arkansas spent more than half the season ranked in the top ten.[196] After beating Kansas State in the Cotton Bowl Classic by a score of 29–16,[197] the Razorbacks finished with an 11–2 record and a No. 5 final ranking in the AP poll,[198] the school's highest ranking since 1977. The eleven wins also tied a school record.[199][200] The only two teams to beat the Hogs that year were Alabama[201] and LSU,[202] the two teams that played each other for the national championship.[203] On April 1, 2012, Petrino was involved in a single-vehicle motorcycle crash in rural Madison County, near Crosses.[204] After initially stating publicly that he was alone, both in a written press release and during a press conference, it was discovered in the police report of the accident that Petrino had been riding with a passenger, former Arkansas All-SEC volleyball player Jessica Dorrell.[205] In his acknowledgement of the report, Petrino admitted to having engaged in a \"previous inappropriate relationship\" with Dorrell.[206] As a result of this information, athletics director Jeff Long placed Petrino on paid administrative leave, pending an investigation.[207][208] On April 10, 2012, after his investigation, Long announced that he had fired Petrino with cause, saying that Petrino \"engaged in a pattern of misleading and manipulative behavior designed to deceive me and members of the athletic staff, both before and after the motorcycle accident.\"[209] He also revealed that in addition to his previously undisclosed personal relationship, Petrino had secretly paid Dorrell $20,000 and had used his influence to ensure that she was selected from an applicant pool of 159 people for a position on the football coaching staff.[210] Long believed the payment could expose Arkansas to a sexual harassment suit if Petrino were retained.[211][212][213] Petrino left Arkansas with a 34–17 record.[214] On April 23, 2012, Petrino's coaching mentor, John L. Smith, was announced as Arkansas' 32nd head football coach.[215] Smith signed a 10-month contract worth $850,000.[216] While the length of the contract made it appear that Smith was merely an interim hire, Arkansas' official announcement described Smith as \"head coach,\" without any qualifier. School officials did announce that the 10-month contract would give them a chance to \"identify a head coach for the future of the program.\"[217] Smith's hiring was ironic, as Petrino had succeeded Smith as head coach at Louisville. Just four months earlier, Smith had accepted the head coaching position at his alma mater Weber State after serving under Petrino as special teams coordinator for the Razorbacks. Smith's hiring was met both with approval and some controversy. A significant number of current players expressed their strong approval for the Smith hire.[218] However, some critics argued that he had abandoned his previous post at Weber State after only 4+1⁄2 months. ESPN's Gene Wojciechowski claimed Smith was merely \"leasing himself to the Razorbacks for a year.\"[219] The Razorbacks struggled to a 4–8 record in 2012[220] despite starting the season with high expectations and being ranked in the Top 10 nationally. Smith was not retained after the season. On December 4, 2012, it was announced that Bret Bielema would leave the Wisconsin Badgers to become the 33rd head coach in Arkansas history.[221][222] Bielema's first season at Arkansas resulted in an overall record of 3–9, 0–8 in the SEC.[223] It was the Razorbacks' worst SEC mark since entering the league in 1992 and their first winless in-conference season since 1942, when they were a member of the Southwest Conference.[224] Bielema's second season saw him improve on his first, as Arkansas finished 7–6.[225] Bielema won his first two SEC games in dominating fashion in November, beating No. 17 LSU 17–0 on November 15, 2014, and No. 8 Ole Miss 30–0 on November 22, 2014, to achieve bowl eligibility. Though Arkansas lost its remaining conference game against Missouri, they still achieved a Texas Bowl victory in the postseason, defeating Texas 31–7.[226] In Bielema's third season, the Razorbacks got off to a slow start, losing to Toledo and Texas Tech and starting 2–4. The Hogs then caught fire in the second half of the season, going 5–1 over the final six games, with the only loss coming to Mississippi State on a blocked field goal. Arkansas ended the year by beating Kansas State 45–23 in the Liberty Bowl, to finish the season with a record of 8–5.[227] Bielema's fourth season was a topsy-turvy 7–6[228] campaign that ended with two embarrassing defeats at the hands of Missouri in the regular season finale and Virginia Tech in the Belk Bowl.[229][230] The former saw his team blow a 17–point halftime lead and the latter was a 24–point blown halftime lead, the largest for Arkansas since at least 1952.[231] Following the 2016 season, Bielema hired Central Michigan head coach Dan Enos as the team's offensive coordinator.[232] The Hogs went downhill in their 2017 season, finishing 4–8. Bielema was fired on the field by interim athletic director Julie Cromer minutes after concluding his fifth season with a 48–45 loss to Missouri on November 24, 2017.[233] After Bielema's firing, Arkansas initially pursued Auburn head coach and former Razorbacks offensive coordinator Gus Malzahn with a lucrative contract offer to become the Razorbacks head coach, but Malzahn opted to remain at Auburn and signed an extension with the Tigers.[234][235][236] On December 6, 2017, SMU head coach Chad Morris was formally introduced as the 34th head coach of the Arkansas Razorbacks.[237][238] Prior to turning around a dismal SMU program in his three years as head coach, Morris solidified himself as one of the nation's best offensive minds during his stint as offensive coordinator at Clemson under Dabo Swinney, instituting a fast-paced spread offense that set school records.[239][240] The University of Arkansas administration signed Morris to a six-year contract worth $3.5 million annually.[241] In 2018, the Razorbacks finished last in the SEC conference with a 0–8 standing and 2–10 overall win-loss record.[242] In 2019, Coach Morris failed to improve upon Arkansas' disappointing 2018 result. Once again, the Hogs wound up last in the SEC with a 0–8 conference record and another 2–10 overall standing.[243] Chad Morris was fired on November 10, 2019, concluding his tenure with a 4–18 (0–14 in the SEC) record.[244] On December 8, 2019, Georgia's offensive line and associate head coach Sam Pittman was announced as the new head coach for the University of Arkansas. It was his first head coaching job.[245] On October 3, 2020, he led the Razorbacks to their first SEC win since they beat Ole Miss in 2017. The Razorbacks finished the season with a 3–7 record in an all SEC schedule due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Arkansas was invited to play in the Mercari Texas Bowl against Texas Christian University. However, due to COVID-19 issues on TCU, the game was canceled.[246] In 2021, he coached the Razorbacks to a 9–4 record and a 24–10 victory over the Penn State Nittany Lions in the 2022 Outback Bowl in Tampa, Florida on New Year's Day. The season included victories over the Texas Longhorns (Arkansas' first win over Texas in Fayetteville since 1981), the Texas A&M Aggies (which ended a 9-game losing streak to A&M), the LSU Tigers and the Missouri Tigers (ending 5-game losing streaks to both schools). The wins over Texas A&M, LSU, and Missouri also meant Arkansas was in possession of all three rivalry trophies (Southwest Classic Trophy, Golden Boot Trophy, Battle Line Rivalry Trophy) in the same season. Pittman was named the 2021 AFCA Region 2 Coach of the Year. Pittman's team started off strong in 2022, winning its first three games and eventually reached No. 10 in the polls before losing a close contest to Texas A&M, which was highlighted by a fumble on the goal line by KJ Jefferson and a field goal miss off the goalpost by kicker Cam Little. They would then lose in consecutive weeks to No. 2 Alabama 49–26 and No. 23 Mississippi State 40–17. They rebounded by defeating BYU and Auburn on the road, but suffered close home losses to Liberty and rival No. 7 LSU. In the Liberty game, they did not get the potential game-tying two-point conversion due to Jefferson's knee being down before he reached the end zone. They beat No. 14 Ole Miss 42–27 the following week and achieved bowl eligibility heading into their rivalry game with Missouri. The team would successfully defeat the Kansas Jayhawks 55–53 in triple overtime in the 2022 Liberty Bowl. 2023 saw the team limp to a 4–8 record, the worst record in a non-COVID season since Pittman took over for Morris after the 2019 campaign, although it did see the Hogs beat Florida in Gainesville for the first time in program history[247]. Pittman had fired offensive coordinator Dan Enos after eight games in 2023, and after the year concluded, Pittman announced they would be hiring former head coach Bobby Petrino as offensive coordinator. Petrino's offense, which included bringing in transfer quarterback Taylen Green, helped the team finish a little better in 2024, as they ended up 6-6 and made the 2024 Liberty Bowl. Arkansas has been affiliated with the following conferences.[248]: 189–190 Arkansas has been named national champion twice by NCAA-designated major selectors.[54][249]: 113–114 Arkansas claims the 1964 championship but does not claim the co-national championship the program was awarded in 1977 by the Rothman (FACT) poll after the Razorbacks finished the season with an 11–1 record and defeated #2 Oklahoma in the Orange Bowl, 31–6.[248]: 156 In 1964, the Razorbacks finished the season as the only major team with an undefeated and untied record (11–0) after No. 1 Alabama lost to Texas in the Orange Bowl (and after Arkansas previously defeated Texas in Austin, TX that season). However, the AP and Coaches Polls became final before the bowl games were played, leaving one-loss Alabama as the AP and UPI national champion. The Football Writers Association of America (FWAA) and Helms Athletic Foundation (Helms) conducted their final polling after the bowl games and selected Arkansas as the national champion.[250][251][252] Arkansas has won 13 conference championships, all during their tenure in the Southwest Conference.[248]: 16 † Co-champions Arkansas has won four division championships, all within the SEC Western Division.[248]: 16 Arkansas has made three appearances in the SEC Championship Game as winner of the SEC Western Division but are 0–3 in those appearances.[253] Arkansas was also the SEC Western Division co-champions in 1998 with Mississippi State but lost to the Bulldogs during the regular season, resulting in Mississippi State representing the West in the SEC Championship Game. In 2002, Alabama had the best conference record in the West with a 6–2 mark, but was on probation by the NCAA and was barred from post season play. Arkansas played in the SEC Championship Game due to winning the tiebreaker for a three-way tie with Auburn and LSU, both of whom Arkansas defeated during the regular season. † - Co-champions There have been 36 head coaches of Arkansas.[254][248]: 190 [255] Barry Lunney Jr. became the interim head coach on November 11, 2019, after the firing of Chad Morris.[256] † Interim head coach The Razorbacks have appeared in 45 bowl games with an overall record of 18–24–3.[248]: 206 [257] Arkansas has been invited to multiple Cotton Bowl Classics (12 games, 4–7–1 record), Sugar Bowls (6 games, 1–5 record), and Liberty Bowls (6 games, 3–3 record). Arkansas has faced current or future fellow SEC members in multiple bowl games as follows: Georgia (4 times); Oklahoma (3 times); and Alabama, LSU, Ole Miss, Missouri, Tennessee, Texas (2 times each). Arkansas has faced current or future out of conference opponents Georgia Tech, Kansas State, North Carolina, and UCLA in two bowl games each. Since joining the Southeastern Conference in 1992, the Razorbacks have developed a rivalry with the LSU Tigers. The game was played annually the day after Thanksgiving and was televised on CBS until 2014 when LSU played Texas A&M on Thanksgiving and Arkansas played Missouri that week. The winner of the game has taken home the \"Golden Boot\", which is a 24-karat gold trophy in the shape of the two states, since its creation in 1996.[258] In 2002, the rivalry gained some momentum as the game winner would represent the Western Division in the SEC Championship Game. The game (called \"Miracle on Markham\") was won by Arkansas on a last second touchdown pass by Matt Jones.[259] In 2006, the Tigers snapped the SEC West champion Razorbacks' 10-game winning streak when they beat Arkansas in Little Rock, 31–26.[260] In 2007, Arkansas stunned top-ranked LSU in triple overtime, 50–48, giving them their first win in Baton Rouge since 1993, and their first victory over a top-ranked team since beating Texas in 1981, winning back the Golden Boot trophy (after 4 consecutive seasons in the hands of LSU) in the process.[261] In 2008, the Razorbacks defended the trophy, winning 31–30 on a last minute touchdown drive. As of 2023, LSU leads the series 42–23–2.[262] Arkansas and Missouri first met in 1906 in Columbia, Missouri, and played each other a total of five times prior to Missouri joining the SEC in 2012, and then becoming Arkansas' permanent cross-division rival in 2014. The annual meeting was dubbed the Battle Line Rivalry by the SEC. On November 23, 2015, a new rivalry trophy was unveiled for the annual game. Missouri leads the series 10–4 as of the conclusion of the 2022 season. The Razorbacks first played the Rebels in 1908. In addition to several occasional years of playing each other, the two teams played each other from 1940 to 1947 and 1952–62 on an annual basis. The Razorbacks and Rebels also met twice in the Sugar Bowl, played in New Orleans, in 1963 and 1970 (both won by Ole Miss). Since 1981, the two teams have played each other annually in football. In 2001, Arkansas and Ole Miss played a then-NCAA record seven-overtime game in Oxford, Mississippi; Arkansas won by a final score of 58–56. When Houston Nutt resigned in 2007 after ten years as Arkansas' head coach to take the same job at Ole Miss, it only added to and heightened the long-standing rivalry between the schools. Nutt was at Ole Miss for four years and went 2–2 versus Arkansas. Arkansas had played Ole Miss more total times than any other SEC opponent until Texas A&M joined the conference in 2012. Arkansas leads the series, 37–29–1, per its records, but only leads 36–30–1 per Ole Miss.[263][264] The Arkansas-Texas game has not been regularly played since Arkansas's departure from the Southwest Conference in 1991, and this has dulled the intensity of the rivalry. There were many classic games, including the result of the 1969 Game of the Century (also known as \"The Big Shootout\"), which eventually led to the Longhorns' 1969 national championship.[265] One of Arkansas' biggest victories over Texas came in 1981, when the Razorbacks defeated the No. 1 ranked Longhorns in Fayetteville, 42–11. Arkansas and Texas have played only six times since 1991, with the Razorbacks winning the 2000 Cotton Bowl, a 2003 game in Austin, and the 2014 Texas Bowl. The Longhorns won the 2004 meeting in Fayetteville and a game in Austin in 2008. However, these games have not served to reignite the once intense rivalry between the two schools. The teams played again in Fayetteville in 2021 (a return game for the 2008 contest in Austin), where the game ended with the Arkansas Razorbacks winning by a score of 40–21; this victory put them in the AP Poll for the first time in 5 years.[266] As of the end of the 2021 season, Texas leads the series 56–23.[267] Beginning in the 2024 season, Texas and Oklahoma will become members of the SEC. Arkansas and Texas are scheduled to play in Fayetteville for the 2024 season. Many Razorback fans are hopeful that an annual game versus the Longhorns will become a reality once more. The Razorbacks first played the Texas A&M Aggies in 1903. From 1934 to 1991, the two had played annually as Southwest Conference members. However, the series ceased in 1991 when Arkansas left the SWC to join the Southeastern Conference. Two of the biggest victories for Arkansas over A&M came in 1975 and 1986. Arkansas manhandled undefeated #2 Texas A&M 31–6 in Little Rock in 1975 to win a share of that year's SWC championship and earn the right to play in the 1976 Cotton Bowl Classic. In 1986, Arkansas again beat Texas A&M in Little Rock, this time 14–10, handing the #7 Aggies their only conference loss of the season. The series resumed in 2009 played at AT&T Stadium in Arlington, TX, a neutral field, with Arkansas winning 47–19.[268] The initial agreement between the two schools allowed the game to be played for at least 10 years, followed by 5 consecutive, 4-year rollover options, allowing the game to be played for a total of 30 consecutive seasons.[269][270][271] Following A&M's move to the SEC, the 2012 game was played at Kyle Field, and the 2013 game was played at Arkansas, and thereafter resumed at AT&T Stadium in Arlington, Texas. Beginning in the 2025 season, the series will move back to each team's home-field stadiums. Arkansas' 20–10 victory during the 2021 season broke a 9-game A&M win streak against Arkansas. The Aggies won the 2022 matchup 23–21. As of the end of the 2022 season, the Razorbacks lead the all-time series 42–34–3.[272] Records as of December 28, 2023[264] Every year, players are selected by several publications to be placed on their All-American team for that season. The NCAA officially recognizes five All-American lists which include AP (Associated Press), American Football Coaches Association (AFCA), Football Writers Association of America (FWAA), Sporting News (TSN), and the Walter Camp Football Foundation (WCFF). A consensus All-American is determined using a point system; three points if the player was selected for the first team, two points for the second team, and one point for the third team. Arkansas has had 58 All-Americans (21 consensus) in its history.[285][286][287] † Consensus All-American Donald W. Reynolds Razorback Stadium (formerly Razorback Stadium) is the on-campus and primary home stadium for the Razorbacks located in Fayetteville, Arkansas. The Razorbacks began playing football at Razorback Stadium in 1938, where they beat Oklahoma A&M 27–7.[289] The stadium was dedicated to Donald W. Reynolds for the $20 million donation from the Donald W. Reynolds Foundation to help finance the major expansion in 2001, which raised the seating capacity from 51,000 to 76,000. The playing field was dedicated to former head coach and athletic director Frank Broyles in 2007 and is now called the Frank Broyles Field at Donald W. Reynolds Razorback Stadium.[290] War Memorial Stadium is the secondary home stadium for the Razorbacks. War Memorial Stadium is located in Little Rock, Arkansas, with a seating capacity of 53,727. War Memorial Stadium used to host either two or three Razorback football games per season. Beginning in 2014, Arkansas will only play one home game per season in Little Rock. The Willard and Pat Walker Pavilion was built in 1998 and is the indoor practice facility for the Arkansas Razorbacks.[289] Arkansas has 15 inductees to the College Football Hall of Fame with ties to the school. Arkansas has five inductees to the Pro Football Hall of Fame as of 2020.[306] From 1992 to 2023, Arkansas played in the West Division of the SEC and played each opponent in the division each year along with several teams from the East Division. The SEC will expand the conference to 16 teams and will eliminate its two divisions in 2024, causing a new scheduling format for the Razorbacks to play against the other members of the conference.[312] Only the 2024 conference schedule was announced on June 14, 2023, while the conference still considers a new format for the future.[313] Announced non-conference schedules as of August 19, 2024.[314]",

The Mavericks came into the contest with some extra motivation after the loss they were dealt the last time these two teams faced off. We'll see if they're able to flip the script or if it'll just be more of the same. Dallas Mavericks @ Phoenix Suns Current Records: Dallas 19-11, Phoenix 15-14 The Mavericks have enjoyed a four-game homestand but will soon have to dust off their road jerseys. They and the Phoenix Suns will round out the year against one another at 9:00 p.m. ET on Friday at at Footprint Center. Coming off a loss in a game the Mavericks were expected to win, they now face the more daunting task of proving themselves against unfavorable odds. The Mavericks are headed into this one after the oddsmakers set last week's over/under low at 222.5, but even that wound up being too high. They fell to the Timberwolves 105-99. Having soared to a lofty 132 points in the game before, Dallas' point total in this one was quite the letdown. The losing side was boosted by Kyrie Irving, who posted 39 points. The Mavericks are 14-3 when Irving posts 25 or more points, but 5-8 otherwise. The Mavericks struggled to work together and finished the game with only 15 assists. That's the fewest assists they've posted since back in June. Meanwhile, the Suns had to suffer through a three-game losing streak, but that streak is no more. They came out on top against the Nuggets by a score of 110-100 on Wednesday. The Suns' win was the result of several impressive offensive performances. One of the most notable came from Kevin Durant, who scored 27 points along with six assists and two steals. Dallas' loss dropped their record down to 19-11. As for Phoenix, they now have a winning record of 15-14. The Mavericks and the Suns were neck-and-neck in their previous meeting back in November, but the Mavericks came up empty-handed after a 114-113 defeat. Can the Mavericks avenge their loss or is history doomed to repeat itself? We'll find out soon enough. Phoenix is a slight 1.5-point favorite against Dallas, according to the latest NBA odds. The oddsmakers had a good feel for the line for this one, as the game opened with the Suns as a 1-point favorite. The over/under is 225.5 points.

                "content": "If not listed, please contact your TV provider. Things got heated between the Phoenix Suns and Dallas Mavericks on Friday night. Specifically, Suns center Jusuf Nurkic and Mavs wing Naji Marshall threw actual blows. Well, Nurkic's was more of a slap, though it still far exceeded the standard of what we refer to as a \"fight\" in NBA parlance. It happened after Nurkic was whistled for an offensive foul early in the third quarter. It wasn't your typical offensive foul. Nurkic led with his elbow into the face area of Daniel Gafford, and Marshall wasn't about to let that fly. The two came together, and Nurkic slapped Marshall in the head. Marshall fired back with a full-on punch, though he mostly missed Nurkic. P.J. Washington then shoved Nurkic to the ground as Marshall was quickly separated from the fracas by officials. Jusuf Nurkic, Naji Marshall and P.J. Washington were all ejected after this scuffle in Mavs-Suns. pic.twitter.com/A3Gk7eBYlI Nurkic, Marshall and Washington were all ejected from the game, and you have to imagine that fines and probably suspensions will be following for at least Nurkic and Marshall. When all was said and done, Dallas was able to come out with a 98-89 victory despite the absence of Luka Doncic, who is going to be out at least a month after sustaining a calf strain in Dallas' loss to Minnesota on Christmas. © 2004-2024 CBS Interactive.

By Aaron Couch, Pamela McClintock December 27, 2024 9:04am Alejandro González Iñárritu and Tom Cruise are flying into the fall 2026 movie season. Their untitled feature will arrive on Oct. 2, 2026, Warner Bros. announced Friday. That slides into the date previously occupied by Matt Reeves’ The Batman sequel, which is currently untitled (it was previously called The Batman: Part II). The DC Studios film is expected to go into production in the third quarter of 2025, and is now set for Oct. 1, 2027. The Batman sequel has sported multiple release dates since it was announced in 2022, with the methodical Reeves working to perfect the script.

Jordan’s Sinners. Mickey 17 now opens March 7, 2025, while Sinners bows on April 18, 2025. Cruise and Iñárritu’s movie, from Warners and Legendary, marks Iñárritu’s first English-language film since the Leonardo DiCaprio starrer The Revenant nearly a decade ago. It is also the first film to emerge from Cruise’s new deal with Warners. The untitled pic stars Cruise as the most powerful man in the world, who embarks on a frantic mission to prove he is humanity’s savior before the disaster he’s unleashed destroys everything. Iñárritu will direct from a script he wrote with Sabina Berman, Alexander Dinelaris and Nicolás Giacobone. Legendary’s Mary Parent is producing alongside Iñárritu and Cruise. Sandra Hüller, John Goodman, Michael Stuhlbarg, Jesse Plemons, Sophie Wilde and Riz Ahmed co-star. The decision to switch Mickey 17 and Sinners is due to delays in finishing Sinners because of Coogler’s desire to use film to shoot the movie, and the scarcity of labs that can assist in production and postproduction work, according to insiders.

Production isn’t scheduled to get started until late summer and with a VFX heavy sequel such as this one, a fall 2026 theatrical release is within reach. The Reeves’ movie will have Imax screens. Funny enough, Warner Bros always had the first weekend of October 2027 staked out for a DC title. Reeves’ The Batman was the first fire-breathing theatrical release for Warner Bros. post Covid after implementing a day-and-date release strategy on Max; the movie making $369.3M domestic, $772M WW.

A trailer for Sinners was attached to that of Focus Features’ Nosferatu sold-out 7PM showtime last night at the Yonkers, NY Alamo Drafthouse. Sinners was shot on film and post-production is taking longer due to the scarcity of labs to do the work on the Ryan Coogler and Michael B. Jordan reteam.

Sinners is the major Easter major motion picture studio release and is booked alongside Neon’s Hell of a Summer, Bleecker Street’s Sundance premiere The Wedding Banquet, and Briarcliff Entertainment’s animated title Sneaks.

                "content": "Pontic Steppe Caucasus East Asia Eastern Europe Northern Europe Pontic Steppe Northern/Eastern Steppe Europe South Asia Steppe Europe Caucasus India Indo-Aryans Iranians East Asia Europe East Asia Europe Indo-Aryan Iranian Indo-Aryan Iranian Others European The Celts (/kɛlts/ KELTS, see pronunciation for different usages) or Celtic peoples (/ˈkɛltɪk/ KEL-tik) were a collection of Indo-European peoples[1] in Europe and Anatolia, identified by their use of Celtic languages and other cultural similarities.[2][3][4][5] Major Celtic groups included the Gauls; the Celtiberians and Gallaeci[6][7] of Iberia; the Britons, Picts, and Gaels of Britain and Ireland; the Boii; and the Galatians. The interrelationships of ethnicity, language and culture in the Celtic world are unclear and debated;[8] for example over the ways in which the Iron Age people of Britain and Ireland should be called Celts.[5][8][9][10] In current scholarship, 'Celt' primarily refers to 'speakers of Celtic languages' rather than to a single ethnic group.[11] The history of pre-Celtic Europe and Celtic origins is debated. The traditional \"Celtic from the East\" theory, says the proto-Celtic language arose in the late Bronze Age Urnfield culture of central Europe, named after grave sites in southern Germany,[12][13] which flourished from around 1200 BC.[14] This theory links the Celts with the Iron Age Hallstatt culture which followed it (c. 1200–500 BC), named for the rich grave finds in Hallstatt, Austria,[14][15] and with the following La Tène culture (c. 450 BC onward), named after the La Tène site in Switzerland. It proposes that Celtic culture spread westward and southward from these areas by diffusion or migration.[16] A newer theory, \"Celtic from the West\", suggests proto-Celtic arose earlier, was a lingua franca in the Atlantic Bronze Age coastal zone, and spread eastward.[17] Another newer theory, \"Celtic from the Centre\", suggests proto-Celtic arose between these two zones, in Bronze Age Gaul, then spread in various directions.[11] After the Celtic settlement of Southeast Europe in the 3rd century BC, Celtic culture reached as far east as central Anatolia, Turkey. The earliest undisputed examples of Celtic language are the Lepontic inscriptions from the 6th century BC.[18] Continental Celtic languages are attested almost exclusively through inscriptions and place-names. Insular Celtic languages are attested from the 4th century AD in Ogham inscriptions, though they were being spoken much earlier. Celtic literary tradition begins with Old Irish texts around the 8th century AD. Elements of Celtic mythology are recorded in early Irish and early Welsh literature. Most written evidence of the early Celts comes from Greco-Roman writers, who often grouped the Celts as barbarian tribes. They followed an ancient Celtic religion overseen by druids. The Celts were often in conflict with the Romans, such as in the Roman–Gallic wars, the Celtiberian Wars, the conquest of Gaul and conquest of Britain. By the 1st century AD, most Celtic territories had become part of the Roman Empire. By c. 500, due to Romanisation and the migration of Germanic tribes, Celtic culture had mostly become restricted to Ireland, western and northern Britain, and Brittany. Between the 5th and 8th centuries, the Celtic-speaking communities in these Atlantic regions emerged as a reasonably cohesive cultural entity. They had a common linguistic, religious and artistic heritage that distinguished them from surrounding cultures.[19] Insular Celtic culture diversified into that of the Gaels (Irish, Scots and Manx) and the Celtic Britons (Welsh, Cornish, and Bretons) of the medieval and modern periods.[2][20][21] A modern Celtic identity[22] was constructed as part of the Romanticist Celtic Revival in Britain, Ireland, and other European territories such as Galicia.[23] Today, Irish, Scottish Gaelic, Welsh, and Breton are still spoken in parts of their former territories, while Cornish and Manx are undergoing a revival. The first recorded use of the name 'Celts' – as Κελτοί (Keltoi) in Ancient Greek – was by Greek geographer Hecataeus of Miletus in 517 BC,[24] when writing about a people living near Massilia (modern Marseille), southern Gaul.[25] In the fifth century BC, Herodotus referred to Keltoi living around the source of the Danube and in the far west of Europe.[26] The etymology of Keltoi is unclear. Possible roots include Indo-European *kʲel 'to hide' (seen also in Old Irish ceilid, and Modern Welsh celu), *kʲel 'to heat' or *kel 'to impel'.[27] It may come from the Celtic language. Linguist Kim McCone supports this view and notes that Celt- is found in the names of several ancient Gauls such as Celtillus, father of Vercingetorix. He suggests it meant the people or descendants of \"the hidden one\", noting the Gauls claimed descent from an underworld god (according to Commentarii de Bello Gallico), and linking it with the Germanic Hel.[28] Others view it as a name coined by Greeks; among them linguist Patrizia de Bernardo Stempel, who suggests it meant \"the tall ones\".[29] In the first century BC, Roman leader Julius Caesar reported that the Gauls called themselves 'Celts', Latin: Celtae, in their own tongue.[30] Thus whether it was given to them by others or not, it was used by the Celts themselves. Greek geographer Strabo, writing about Gaul towards the end of the first century BC, refers to the \"race which is now called both Gallic and Galatic\", though he also uses Celtica as another name for Gaul. He reports Celtic peoples in Iberia too, calling them Celtiberi and Celtici.[31] Pliny the Elder noted the use of Celtici in Lusitania as a tribal surname,[32] which epigraphic findings have confirmed.[33][34] A Latin name for the Gauls, Galli (pl.), may come from a Celtic ethnic name, perhaps borrowed into Latin during the Celtic expansion into Italy from the early fifth century BC. Its root may be Proto-Celtic *galno, meaning \"power, strength\" (whence Old Irish gal \"boldness, ferocity\", Welsh gallu \"to be able, power\"). The Greek name Γαλάται (Galatai, Latinized Galatae) most likely has the same origin, referring to the Gauls who invaded southeast Europe and settled in Galatia.[35] The suffix -atai might be a Greek inflection.[36] Linguist Kim McCone suggests it comes from Proto-Celtic *galatis (\"ferocious, furious\"), and was not originally an ethnic name but a name for young warrior bands. He says \"If the Gauls' initial impact on the Mediterranean world was primarily a military one typically involving fierce young *galatīs, it would have been natural for the Greeks to apply this name for the type of Keltoi that they usually encountered\".[28] Because Classical writers did not call the inhabitants of Britain and Ireland Κελτοί (Keltoi) or Celtae,[5][8][9] some scholars prefer not to use the term for the Iron Age inhabitants of those islands.[5][8][9][10] However, they spoke Celtic languages, shared other cultural traits, and Roman historian Tacitus says the Britons resembled the Gauls in customs and religion.[11] For at least 1,000 years the name Celt was not used at all, and nobody called themselves Celts or Celtic, until from about 1700, after the word 'Celtic' was rediscovered in classical texts, it was applied for the first time to the distinctive culture, history, traditions, language of the modern Celtic nations – Ireland, Scotland, Wales, Cornwall, Brittany, and the Isle of Man.[37] 'Celt' is a modern English word, first attested in 1707 in the writing of Edward Lhuyd, whose work, along with that of other late 17th-century scholars, brought academic attention to the languages and history of the early Celtic inhabitants of Great Britain.[38] The English words Gaul, Gauls (pl.) and Gaulish (first recorded in the 16–17th centuries) come from French Gaule and Gaulois, a borrowing from Frankish *Walholant, 'Roman-land' (see Gaul: Name), the root of which is Proto-Germanic *walha-, 'foreigner, Roman, Celt', whence the English word Welsh (Old English wælisċ). Proto-Germanic *walha comes from the name of the Volcae,[39] a Celtic tribe who lived first in southern Germany and central Europe, then migrated to Gaul.[40] This means that English Gaul, despite its superficial similarity, is not actually derived from Latin Gallia (which should have produced *Jaille in French),[citation needed] though it does refer to the same ancient region. Celtic refers to a language family and, more generally, means 'of the Celts' or 'in the style of the Celts'. Several archaeological cultures are considered Celtic, based on unique sets of artefacts. The link between language and artefact is aided by the presence of inscriptions.[41] The modern idea of a Celtic cultural identity or \"Celticity\" focuses on similarities among languages, works of art, and classical texts,[42] and sometimes also among material artefacts, social organisation, homeland and mythology.[43] Earlier theories held that these similarities suggest a common \"racial\" (race is now a contested concept) origin for the various Celtic peoples, but more recent theories hold that they reflect a common cultural and linguistic heritage more than a genetic one. Celtic cultures seem to have been diverse, with the use of a Celtic language being the main thing they had in common.[5] Today, the term 'Celtic' generally refers to the languages and cultures of Ireland, Scotland, Wales, Cornwall, the Isle of Man, and Brittany; also called the Celtic nations. These are the regions where Celtic languages are still spoken to some extent. The four are Irish, Scottish Gaelic, Welsh, and Breton; plus two recent revivals, Cornish (a Brittonic language) and Manx (a Goidelic language). There are also attempts to reconstruct Cumbric, a Brittonic language of northern Britain. Celtic regions of mainland Europe are those whose residents claim a Celtic heritage, but where no Celtic language survives; these include western Iberia, i.e. Portugal and north-central Spain (Galicia, Asturias, Cantabria, Castile and León, Extremadura).[44] Continental Celts are the Celtic-speaking people of mainland Europe and Insular Celts are the Celtic-speaking people of the British and Irish islands, and their descendants. The Celts of Brittany derive their language from migrating Insular Celts from Britain and so are grouped accordingly.[45] The Celtic languages are a branch of the Indo-European languages. By the time Celts are first mentioned in written records around 400 BC, they were already split into several language groups, and spread over much of western mainland Europe, the Iberian Peninsula, Ireland and Britain. The languages developed into Celtiberian, Goidelic and Brittonic branches, among others.[46][47] The mainstream view during most of the twentieth century is that the Celts and the proto-Celtic language arose out of the Urnfield culture of central Europe around 1000 BC, spreading westward and southward over the following few hundred years.[14][48][49][50] The Urnfield culture was preeminent in central Europe during the late Bronze Age, circa 1200 BC to 700 BC. The spread of iron-working led to the Hallstatt culture (c. 800 to 500 BC) developing out of the Urnfield culture in a wide region north of the Alps. The Hallstatt culture developed into the La Tène culture from about 450 BC, which came to be identified with Celtic art.[citation needed] In 1846, Johann Georg Ramsauer unearthed an ancient grave field with distinctive grave goods at Hallstatt, Austria. Because the burials \"dated to roughly the time when Celts are mentioned near the Danube by Herodotus, Ramsauer concluded that the graves were Celtic\".[51] Similar sites and artifacts were found over a wide area, which were named the 'Hallstatt culture'. In 1857, the archaeological site of La Tène was discovered in Switzerland.[51] The huge collection of artifacts had a distinctive style. Artifacts of this 'La Tène style' were found elsewhere in Europe, \"particularly in places where people called Celts were known to have lived and early Celtic languages are attested. As a result, these items quickly became associated with the Celts, so much so that by the 1870s scholars began to regard finds of the La Tène as 'the archaeological expression of the Celts'\".[51] This cultural network was overrun by the Roman Empire, though traces of La Tène style were still seen in Gallo-Roman artifacts. In Britain and Ireland, the La Tène style survived precariously to re-emerge in Insular art.[citation needed] The Urnfield-Hallstatt theory began to be challenged in the latter 20th century, when it was accepted that the oldest known Celtic-language inscriptions were those of Lepontic from the 6th century BC and Celtiberian from the 2nd century BC. These were found in northern Italy and Iberia, neither of which were part of the 'Hallstatt' nor 'La Tène' cultures at the time.[11] The Urnfield-Hallstatt theory was partly based on ancient Greco-Roman writings, such as the Histories of Herodotus, which placed the Celts at the source of the Danube. However, Stephen Oppenheimer shows that Herodotus seemed to believe the Danube rose near the Pyrenees, which would place the Ancient Celts in a region which is more in agreement with later classical writers and historians (i.e. in Gaul and Iberia).[52] The theory was also partly based on the abundance of inscriptions bearing Celtic personal names in the Eastern Hallstatt region (Noricum). However, Patrick Sims-Williams notes that these date to the later Roman era, and says they suggest \"relatively late settlement by a Celtic-speaking elite\".[11] In the late 20th century, the Urnfield-Hallstatt theory began to fall out of favour with some scholars, which was influenced by new archaeological finds. 'Celtic' began to refer primarily to 'speakers of Celtic languages' rather than to a single culture or ethnic group.[11] A new theory suggested that Celtic languages arose earlier, along the Atlantic coast (including Britain, Ireland, Armorica and Iberia), long before evidence of 'Celtic' culture is found in archaeology. Myles Dillon and Nora Kershaw Chadwick argued that \"Celtic settlement of the British Isles\" might date to the Bell Beaker culture of the Copper and Bronze Age (from c. 2750 BC).[53][54] Martín Almagro Gorbea (2001) also proposed that Celtic arose in the 3rd millennium BC, suggesting that the spread of the Bell Beaker culture explained the wide dispersion of the Celts throughout western Europe, as well as the variability of the Celtic peoples.[55] Using a multidisciplinary approach, Alberto J. Lorrio and Gonzalo Ruiz Zapatero reviewed and built on Almagro Gorbea's work to present a model for the origin of Celtic archaeological groups in Iberia and proposing a rethinking of the meaning of \"Celtic\".[56] John T. Koch[57] and Barry Cunliffe[58] have developed this 'Celtic from the West' theory. It proposes that the proto-Celtic language arose along the Atlantic coast and was the lingua franca of the Atlantic Bronze Age cultural network, later spreading inland and eastward.[11] More recently, Cunliffe proposes that proto-Celtic had arisen in the Atlantic zone even earlier, by 3000 BC, and spread eastwards with the Bell Beaker culture over the following millennium. His theory is partly based on glottochronology, the spread of ancient Celtic-looking placenames, and thesis that the Tartessian language was Celtic.[11] However, the proposal that Tartessian was Celtic is widely rejected by linguists, many of whom regard it as unclassified.[59][60] Celticist Patrick Sims-Williams (2020) notes that in current scholarship, 'Celt' is primarily a linguistic label. In his 'Celtic from the Centre' theory, he argues that the proto-Celtic language did not originate in central Europe nor the Atlantic, but in-between these two regions. He suggests that it \"emerged as a distinct Indo-European dialect around the second millennium BC, probably somewhere in Gaul [centered in modern France] ... whence it spread in various directions and at various speeds in the first millennium BC\". Sims-Williams says this avoids the problematic idea \"that Celtic was spoken over a vast area for a very long time yet somehow avoided major dialectal splits\", and \"it keeps Celtic fairly close to Italy, which suits the view that Italic and Celtic were in some way linked\".[11] The Proto-Celtic language is usually dated to the Late Bronze Age.[14] The earliest records of a Celtic language are the Lepontic inscriptions of Cisalpine Gaul (Northern Italy), the oldest of which pre-date the La Tène period. Other early inscriptions, appearing from the early La Tène period in the area of Massilia, are in Gaulish, which was written in the Greek alphabet until the Roman conquest. Celtiberian inscriptions, using their own Iberian script, appear later, after about 200 BC. Evidence of Insular Celtic is available only from about 400 AD, in the form of Primitive Irish Ogham inscriptions.[citation needed] Besides epigraphic evidence, an important source of information on early Celtic is toponymy (place names).[61] Arnaiz-Villena et al. (2017) demonstrated that Celtic-related populations of the European Atlantic (Orkney Islands, Scottish, Irish, British, Bretons, Basques, Galicians) shared a common HLA system.[clarification needed][62] Other genetic research does not support the notion of a significant genetic link between these populations, beyond the fact that they are all West Europeans. Early European Farmers did settle Britain (and all of Northern Europe) in the Neolithic; however, recent genetics research has found that, between 2400 and 2000 BC, over 90% of British DNA was overturned by European Steppe Herders in a migration that brought large amounts of Steppe DNA (including the R1b haplogroup) to western Europe.[63] Modern autosomal genetic clustering is testament to this fact, as both modern and Iron Age British and Irish samples cluster genetically very closely with other North Europeans, and less so with Galicians, Basques or those from the south of France.[64][65] The concept that the Hallstatt and La Tène cultures could be seen not just as chronological periods but as \"Culture Groups\", entities composed of people of the same ethnicity and language, had started to grow by the end of the 19th century. At the beginning of the 20th century the belief that these \"Culture Groups\" could be thought of in racial or ethnic terms was held by Gordon Childe, whose theory was influenced by the writings of Gustaf Kossinna.[66] As the 20th century progressed, the ethnic interpretation of La Tène culture became more strongly rooted, and any findings of La Tène culture and flat inhumation cemeteries were linked to the Celts and the Celtic language.[67] In various[clarification needed] academic disciplines the Celts were considered a Central European Iron Age phenomenon, through the cultures of Hallstatt and La Tène. However, archaeological finds from the Halstatt and La Tène culture were rare in Iberia, southwestern France, northern and western Britain, southern Ireland and Galatia[68][69] and did not provide enough evidence for a culture like that of Central Europe. It is equally difficult to maintain that the origin of the Iberian Celts can be linked to the preceding Urnfield culture. This has resulted in a newer theory that introduces a 'proto-Celtic' substratum and a process of Celticisation, having its initial roots in the Bronze Age Bell Beaker culture.[70] The La Tène culture developed and flourished during the late Iron Age (from 450 BC to the Roman conquest in the 1st century BC) in eastern France, Switzerland, Austria, southwest Germany, the Czech Republic, Slovakia and Hungary. It developed out of the Hallstatt culture without any definite cultural break, under the impetus of considerable Mediterranean influence from Greek, and later Etruscan civilisations. A shift of settlement centres took place in the 4th century. The western La Tène culture corresponds to historical Celtic Gaul. Whether this means that the whole of La Tène culture can be attributed to a unified Celtic people is difficult to assess; archaeologists have repeatedly concluded that language and material culture do not necessarily run parallel. Frey notes that in the 5th century, \"burial customs in the Celtic world were not uniform; rather, localised groups had their own beliefs, which, in consequence, also gave rise to distinct artistic expressions\".[71] Thus, while the La Tène culture is certainly associated with the Gauls, the presence of La Tène artefacts may be due to cultural contact and does not imply the permanent presence of Celtic speakers.[citation needed] The Greek historian Ephorus of Cyme in Asia Minor, writing in the 4th century BC, believed the Celts came from the islands off the mouth of the Rhine and were \"driven from their homes by the frequency of wars and the violent rising of the sea\". Polybius published a history of Rome about 150 BC in which he describes the Gauls of Italy and their conflict with Rome. Pausanias in the 2nd century AD says that the Gauls \"originally called Celts\", \"live on the remotest region of Europe on the coast of an enormous tidal sea\". Posidonius described the southern Gauls about 100 BC. Though his original work is lost, later writers such as Strabo used it. The latter, writing in the early 1st century AD, deals with Britain and Gaul as well as Hispania, Italy, and Galatia. Caesar wrote extensively about his Gallic Wars in 58–51 BC. Diodorus Siculus wrote about the Celts of Gaul and Britain in his 1st-century history.[citation needed] Diodorus Siculus and Strabo both suggest that the heartland of the people they call Celts was in southern Gaul. The former says that the Gauls were to the north of the Celts, but that the Romans referred to both as Gauls (linguistically the Gauls were certainly Celts). Before the discoveries at Hallstatt and La Tène, it was generally considered that the Celtic heartland was southern Gaul, see Encyclopædia Britannica for 1813.[citation needed] The Romans knew the Celts then living in present-day France as Gauls. The territory of these peoples probably included the Low Countries, the Alps and present-day northern Italy. Julius Caesar in his Gallic Wars described the 1st-century BC descendants of those Gauls.[citation needed] Eastern Gaul became the centre of the western La Tène culture. In later Iron Age Gaul, the social organisation resembled that of the Romans, with large towns. From the 3rd century BC the Gauls adopted coinage. Texts with Greek characters from southern Gaul have survived from the 2nd century BC.[72] Greek traders founded Massalia about 600 BC, with some objects (mostly drinking ceramic vessels) being traded up the Rhône valley. But trade became disrupted soon after 500 BC and re-oriented over the Alps to the Po valley in the Italian peninsula. The Romans arrived in the Rhone valley in the 2nd century BC and encountered a mostly Celtic-speaking Gaul. Rome wanted land communications with its Iberian provinces and fought a major battle with the Saluvii at Entremont in 124–123 BC. Gradually Roman control extended, and the Roman province of Gallia Transalpina developed along the Mediterranean coast.[73][74] The Romans knew the remainder of Gaul as Gallia Comata, 'Long-haired Gaul'.[75] In 58 BC, the Helvetii planned to migrate westward but Julius Caesar forced them back. He then became involved in fighting the various tribes in Gaul, and by 55 BC had overrun most of Gaul. In 52 BC, Vercingetorix led a revolt against Roman occupation but was defeated at the Battle of Alesia and surrendered.[76] Following the Gallic Wars of 58–51 BC, Caesar's Celtica formed the main part of Roman Gaul, becoming the province of Gallia Lugdunensis. This territory of the Celtic tribes was bounded on the south by the Garonne and on the north by the Seine and the Marne.[77] The Romans attached large swathes of this region to neighbouring provinces Belgica and Aquitania, particularly under Augustus.[78] Place- and personal-name analysis and inscriptions suggest that Gaulish was spoken over most of what is now France.[79][80] Until the end of the 19th century, traditional scholarship dealing with the Celts did acknowledge their presence in the Iberian Peninsula[81][82] as a material culture relatable to the Hallstatt and La Tène cultures. However, since according to the definition of the Iron Age in the 19th century Celtic populations were supposedly rare in Iberia and did not provide a cultural scenario that could easily be linked to that of Central Europe, the presence of Celtic culture in that region was generally not fully recognised. Modern scholarship, however, has proven that Celtic presence and influences were most substantial in what is today Spain and Portugal (with perhaps the highest settlement saturation in Western Europe), particularly in the central, western and northern regions.[83][84] In addition to Gauls infiltrating from the north of the Pyrenees, the Roman and Greek sources mention Celtic populations in three parts of the Iberian Peninsula: the eastern part of the Meseta (inhabited by the Celtiberians), the southwest (Celtici, in modern-day Alentejo) and the northwest (Gallaecia and Asturias).[85] A modern scholarly review[86] found several archaeological groups of Celts in Spain: The origins of the Celtiberians might provide a key to understanding the Celticisation process in the rest of the Peninsula. The process of Celticisation of the southwestern area of the peninsula by the Keltoi and of the northwestern area is, however, not a simple Celtiberian question. Recent investigations about the Callaici[91] and Bracari[92] in northwestern Portugal are providing new approaches to understanding Celtic culture (language, art and religion) in western Iberia.[93] John T. Koch of Aberystwyth University suggested that Tartessian inscriptions of the 8th century BC might be classified as Celtic. This would mean that Tartessian is the earliest attested trace of Celtic by a margin of more than a century.[94] In Germany by the late Bronze Age, the Urnfield culture (c. 1300 BC – c. 750 BC) had replaced the Bell Beaker, Unetice and Tumulus cultures in central Europe,[97] whilst the Nordic Bronze Age had developed in Scandinavia and northern Germany. The Hallstatt culture, which had developed from the Urnfield culture, was the predominant Western and Central European culture from the 12th to 8th centuries BC and during the early Iron Age (8th to 6th centuries BC). It was followed by the La Tène culture (5th to 1st centuries BC). The people who had adopted these cultural characteristics in central and southern Germany are regarded as Celts. Celtic cultural centres developed in central Europe during the late Bronze Age (c. 1200 BC until 700 BC). Some, like the Heuneburg, the oldest city north of the Alps,[98] grew to become important cultural centres of the Iron Age in Central Europe, that maintained trade routes to the Mediterranean. In the 5th century BC the Greek historian Herodotus mentioned a Celtic city at the Danube – Pyrene, that historians attribute to the Heuneburg. Beginning around 700 BC (or later), Germanic peoples (Germanic tribes) from southern Scandinavia and northern Germany expanded south and gradually replaced the Celtic peoples in Central Europe.[99][100][101][102][103][104] The Canegrate culture represented the first migratory wave of the proto-Celtic[105][106] population from the northwest part of the Alps that, through the Alpine passes, had already penetrated and settled in the western Po valley between Lake Maggiore and Lake Como (Scamozzina culture). It has also been proposed that a more ancient proto-Celtic presence can be traced back to the beginning of the Middle Bronze Age, when North Westwern Italy appears closely linked regarding the production of bronze artefacts, including ornaments, to the western groups of the Tumulus culture.[107] La Tène cultural material appeared over a large area of mainland Italy,[108] the southernmost example being the Celtic helmet from Canosa di Puglia.[109] Italy is home to Lepontic, the oldest attested Celtic language (from the 6th century BC).[110] Anciently spoken in Switzerland and in Northern-Central Italy, from the Alps to Umbria.[111][112][113][114] According to the Recueil des Inscriptions Gauloises, more than 760 Gaulish inscriptions have been found throughout present-day France – with the notable exception of Aquitaine – and in Italy,[115][116] which testifies the importance of Celtic heritage in the peninsula.[citation needed] In 391 BC, Celts \"who had their homes beyond the Alps streamed through the passes in great strength and seized the territory that lay between the Apennine Mountains and the Alps\" according to Diodorus Siculus. The Po Valley and the rest of northern Italy (known to the Romans as Cisalpine Gaul) was inhabited by Celtic-speakers who founded cities such as Milan.[117] Later the Roman army was routed at the battle of Allia and Rome was sacked in 390 BC by the Senones.[118] At the battle of Telamon in 225 BC, a large Celtic army was trapped between two Roman forces and crushed.[119] The defeat of the combined Samnite, Celtic and Etruscan alliance by the Romans in the Third Samnite War sounded the beginning of the end of the Celtic domination in mainland Europe, but it was not until 192 BC that the Roman armies conquered the last remaining independent Celtic kingdoms in Italy.[citation needed] The Celts also expanded down the Danube river and its tributaries. One of the most influential tribes, the Scordisci, established their capital at Singidunum (present-day Belgrade, Serbia) in the 3rd century BC. The concentration of hill-forts and cemeteries shows a dense population in the Tisza valley of modern-day Vojvodina, Serbia, Hungary and into Ukraine. Expansion into Romania was however blocked by the Dacians.[citation needed] The Serdi were a Celtic tribe[120] inhabiting Thrace. They were located around and founded Serdika (Bulgarian: Сердика, Latin: Ulpia Serdica, Greek: Σαρδῶν πόλις), now Sofia in Bulgaria,[121] which reflects their ethnonym. They would have established themselves in this area during the Celtic migrations at the end of the 4th century BC, though there is no evidence for their existence before the 1st century BC. Serdi are among traditional tribal names reported into the Roman era.[122] They were gradually Thracianized over the centuries but retained their Celtic character in material culture up to a late date.[when?][citation needed] According to other sources they may have been simply of Thracian origin,[123] according to others they may have become of mixed Thraco-Celtic origin. Further south, Celts settled in Thrace (Bulgaria), which they ruled for over a century, and Anatolia, where they settled as the Galatians (see also: Gallic Invasion of Greece). Despite their geographical isolation from the rest of the Celtic world, the Galatians maintained their Celtic language for at least 700 years. St Jerome, who visited Ancyra (modern-day Ankara) in 373 AD, likened their language to that of the Treveri of northern Gaul.[citation needed] For Venceslas Kruta, Galatia in central Turkey was an area of dense Celtic settlement.[citation needed] The Boii tribe gave their name to Bohemia, Bologna and possibly Bavaria, and Celtic artefacts and cemeteries have been discovered further east in what is now Poland and Slovakia. A Celtic coin (Biatec) from Bratislava's mint was displayed on the old Slovak 5-crown coin.[citation needed] As there is no archaeological evidence for large-scale invasions in some of the other areas, one current school of thought holds that Celtic language and culture spread to those areas by contact rather than invasion.[124] However, the Celtic invasions of Italy and the expedition in Greece and western Anatolia, are well documented in Greek and Latin history.[125][126] There are records of Celtic mercenaries in Egypt serving the Ptolemies. Thousands were employed in 283–246 BC and they were also in service around 186 BC. They attempted to overthrow Ptolemy II.[127] All living Celtic languages today belong to the Insular Celtic languages, derived from the Celtic languages spoken in Iron Age Britain and Ireland.[128] They separated into a Goidelic and a Brittonic branch early on. By the time of the Roman conquest of Britain in the 1st century AD, the Insular Celts were made up of the Celtic Britons, the Gaels (or Scoti), and the Picts (or Caledonians).[citation needed] The renown of insular Celts has caused a popular belief that Celtic clans only lived in the British Isles.[129] Linguists have debated whether a Celtic language came to the British Isles and then split, or whether the two branches arrived separately. The older view was that Celtic influence in the Isles was the result of successive migrations or invasions from the European mainland by diverse Celtic-speaking peoples over several centuries, accounting for the P-Celtic vs. Q-Celtic isogloss. This view has been challenged by the hypothesis that the islands' Celtic languages form an Insular Celtic dialect group.[130] In the 19th and 20th centuries, scholars often dated the \"arrival\" of Celtic culture in Britain (via an invasion model) to the 6th century BC, corresponding to archaeological evidence of Hallstatt influence and the appearance of chariot burials in what is now England. Cunliffe and Koch propose in their newer 'Celtic from the West' theory that Celtic languages reached the Isles earlier, with the Bell Beaker culture c.2500 BC, or even before this.[131][132] More recently, a major archaeogenetics study uncovered a migration into southern Britain in the Bronze Age from 1300 to 800 BC.[133] The newcomers were genetically most similar to ancient individuals from Gaul.[133] From 1000 BC, their genetic marker swiftly spread through southern Britain,[134] but not northern Britain.[133] The authors see this as a \"plausible vector for the spread of early Celtic languages into Britain\".[133] There was much less immigration during the Iron Age, so it is likely that Celtic reached Britain before then.[133] Cunliffe suggests that a branch of Celtic was already spoken in Britain, and the Bronze Age migration introduced the Brittonic branch.[135] Like many Celtic peoples on the mainland, the Insular Celts followed an Ancient Celtic religion overseen by druids. Some of the southern British tribes had strong links with Gaul and Belgica, and minted their own coins. During the Roman occupation of Britain, a Romano-British culture emerged in the southeast. The Britons and Picts in the north, and the Gaels of Ireland, remained outside the empire. During the end of Roman rule in Britain in the 400s AD, there was significant Anglo-Saxon settlement of eastern and southern Britain, and some Gaelic settlement of its western coast. During this time, some Britons migrated to the Armorican peninsula, where their culture became dominant. Meanwhile, much of northern Britain (Scotland) became Gaelic. By the 10th century AD, the Insular Celtic peoples had diversified into the Brittonic-speaking Welsh (in Wales), Cornish (in Cornwall), Bretons (in Brittany) and Cumbrians (in the Old North); and the Gaelic-speaking Irish (in Ireland), Scots (in Scotland) and Manx (on the Isle of Man).[citation needed] Classical writers did not call the inhabitants of Britain and Ireland Celtae or Κελτοί (Keltoi),[5][8][9] leading some scholars to question the use of the term 'Celt' for the Iron Age inhabitants of those islands.[5][8][9][10] The first historical account of the islands was by the Greek geographer Pytheas, who sailed around what he called the \"Pretannikai nesoi\" (the \"Pretannic isles\") around 310–306 BC.[136] In general, classical writers referred to the Britons as Pretannoi (in Greek) or Britanni (in Latin).[137] Strabo, writing in Roman times, distinguished between the Celts and Britons.[138] However, Roman historian Tacitus says the Britons resembled the Celts of Gaul in customs and religion.[11] Under Caesar the Romans conquered Celtic Gaul, and from Claudius onward the Roman empire absorbed parts of Britain. Roman local government of these regions closely mirrored pre-Roman tribal boundaries, and archaeological finds suggest native involvement in local government.[citation needed] The native peoples under Roman rule became Romanised and keen to adopt Roman ways. Celtic art had already incorporated classical influences, and surviving Gallo-Roman pieces interpret classical subjects or keep faith with old traditions despite a Roman overlay.[citation needed] The Roman occupation of Gaul, and to a lesser extent of Britain, led to Roman-Celtic syncretism. In the case of the continental Celts, this eventually resulted in a language shift to Vulgar Latin, while the Insular Celts retained their language.[citation needed] There was also considerable cultural influence exerted by Gaul on Rome, particularly in military matters and horsemanship, as the Gauls often served in the Roman cavalry. The Romans adopted the Celtic cavalry sword, the spatha, and Epona, the Celtic horse goddess.[139][140] To the extent that sources are available, they depict a pre-Christian Iron Age Celtic social structure based formally on class and kingship, although this may only have been a particular late phase of organisation in Celtic societies. Patron-client relationships similar to those of Roman society are also described by Caesar and others in the Gaul of the 1st century BC.[citation needed] In the main, the evidence is of tribes being led by kings, although some argue that there is also evidence of oligarchical republican forms of government eventually emerging in areas which had close contact with Rome. Most descriptions of Celtic societies portray them as being divided into three groups: a warrior aristocracy; an intellectual class including professions such as druid, poet, and jurist; and everyone else. In historical times, the offices of high and low kings in Ireland and Scotland were filled by election under the system of tanistry, which eventually came into conflict with the feudal principle of primogeniture in which succession goes to the first-born son.[citation needed] Little is known of family structure among the Celts. Patterns of settlement varied from decentralised to urban. The popular stereotype of non-urbanised societies settled in hillforts and duns,[141] drawn from Britain and Ireland (there are about 3,000 hill forts known in Britain)[142] contrasts with the urban settlements present in the core Hallstatt and La Tène areas, with the many significant oppida of Gaul late in the first millennium BC, and with the towns of Gallia Cisalpina.[citation needed] Slavery, as practised by the Celts, was very likely similar to the better documented practice in ancient Greece and Rome.[143] Slaves were acquired from war, raids, and penal and debt servitude.[143] Slavery was hereditary,[144] though manumission was possible. The Old Irish and Welsh words for 'slave', cacht and caeth respectively, are cognate with Latin captus 'captive' suggesting that the slave trade was an early means of contact between Latin and Celtic societies.[143] In the Middle Ages, slavery was especially prevalent in the Celtic countries.[145] Manumissions were discouraged by law and the word for 'female slave', cumal, was used as a general unit of value in Ireland.[146] There are only very limited records from pre-Christian times written in Celtic languages. These are mostly inscriptions in the Roman and sometimes Greek alphabets. The ogham script, an Early Medieval alphabet, was mostly used in early Christian times in Ireland and Scotland (but also in Wales and England), and was only used for ceremonial purposes such as inscriptions on gravestones. The available evidence is of a strong oral tradition, such as that preserved by bards in Ireland, and eventually recorded by monasteries. Celtic art also produced a great deal of intricate and beautiful metalwork, examples of which have been preserved by their distinctive burial rites.[147] In some regards the Atlantic Celts were conservative: for example, they still used chariots in combat long after they had been reduced to ceremonial roles by the Greeks and Romans. However, despite being outdated, Celtic chariot tactics were able to repel the invasions of Britain attempted by Julius Caesar.[148] According to Diodorus Siculus: The Gauls are tall of body with rippling muscles and white of skin and their hair is blond, and not only naturally so for they also make it their practice by artificial means to increase the distinguishing colour which nature has given it. For they are always washing their hair in limewater and they pull it back from the forehead to the nape of the neck, with the result that their appearance is like that of Satyrs and Pans since the treatment of their hair makes it so heavy and coarse that it differs in no respect from the mane of horses. Some of them shave the beard but others let it grow a little; and the nobles shave their cheeks but they let the moustache grow until it covers the mouth. During the later Iron Age the Gauls generally wore long-sleeved shirts or tunics and long trousers (called braccae by the Romans).[149] Clothes were made of wool or linen, with some silk being used by the rich. Cloaks were worn in the winter. Brooches[150] and armlets were used, but the most famous item of jewellery was the torc, a neck collar of metal, sometimes gold. The horned Waterloo Helmet in the British Museum, which long set the standard for modern images of Celtic warriors, is in fact a unique survival, and may have been a piece for ceremonial rather than military wear.[151] Archaeological evidence suggests that the pre-Roman Celtic societies were linked to the network of overland trade routes that spanned Eurasia. Archaeologists have discovered large prehistoric trackways crossing bogs in Ireland and Germany. Due to their substantial nature, these are believed to have been created for wheeled transport as part of an extensive roadway system that facilitated trade.[152] The territory held by the Celts contained tin, lead, iron, silver and gold.[153] Celtic smiths and metalworkers created weapons and jewellery for international trade, particularly with the Romans.[154] The myth that the Celtic monetary system consisted of wholly barter is a common one, but is in part false. The monetary system was complex and is still not understood (much like the late Roman coinages), and due to the absence of large numbers of coin items, it is assumed that \"proto-money\" was used. This included bronze items made from the early La Tène period and onwards, which were often in the shape of axeheads, rings, or bells. Due to the large number of these present in some burials, it is thought they had a relatively high monetary value, and could be used for \"day to day\" purchases. Low-value coinages of potin, a bronze alloy with high tin content, were minted in most Celtic areas of the continent and in South-East Britain prior to the Roman conquest of these lands. Higher-value coinages, suitable for use in trade, were minted in gold, silver, and high-quality bronze. Gold coinage was much more common than silver coinage, despite being worth substantially more, as while there were around 100 mines in Southern Britain and Central France, silver was more rarely mined. This was due partly to the relative sparsity of mines and the amount of effort needed for extraction compared to the profit gained. As the Roman civilisation grew in importance and expanded its trade with the Celtic world, silver and bronze coinage became more common. This coincided with a major increase in gold production in Celtic areas to meet the Roman demand, due to the high value Romans put on the metal. The large number of gold mines in France is thought to be a major reason why Caesar invaded.[155] Very few reliable sources exist regarding Celtic views on gender roles, though some archaeological evidence suggests their views may have differed from those of the Greco-Roman world, which tended to be less egalitarian.[156][157] Some Iron Age burials in northeastern Gaul suggest women may have had roles in warfare during the earlier La Tène period, but the evidence is far from conclusive.[158] Celtic individuals buried with both female jewellery and weaponry have been found, such as the Vix Grave in northeastern Gaul, and there are questions about the gender of some individuals buried with weaponry. However, it has been suggested that the weapons indicate high social rank rather than masculinity.[159] Most written accounts of the Ancient Celts are from the Romans and Greeks, though it is not clear how accurate these are. Roman historians Ammianus Marcellinus and Tacitus mentioned Celtic women inciting, participating in, and leading battles.[160] Plutarch reports that Celtic women acted as ambassadors to avoid a war among Celtic chiefdoms in the Po valley during the 4th century BC.[161] Posidonius' anthropological comments on the Celts had common themes, primarily primitivism, extreme ferocity, cruel sacrificial practices, and the strength and courage of their women.[162] Cassius Dio suggests there was great sexual freedom among women in Celtic Britain:[163] ... a very witty remark is reported to have been made by the wife of Argentocoxus, a Caledonian, to Julia Augusta. When the empress was jesting with her, after the treaty, about the free intercourse of her sex with men in Britain, she replied: \"We fulfill the demands of nature in a much better way than do you Roman women; for we consort openly with the best men, whereas you let yourselves be debauched in secret by the vilest\". Such was the retort of the British woman. Barry Cunliffe writes that such references are \"likely to be ill-observed\" and meant to portray the Celts as outlandish \"barbarians\".[164] Historian Lisa Bitel argues the descriptions of Celtic women warriors are not credible. She says some Roman and Greek writers wanted to show that the barbarian Celts lived in \"an upside-down world ... and a standard ingredient in such a world was the manly warrior woman\".[165] The Greek philosopher Aristotle wrote in his Politics that the Celts of southeastern Europe approved of male homosexuality. Greek historian Diodorus Siculus wrote in his Bibliotheca historica that although Gaulish women were beautiful, the men had \"little to do with them\" and it was a custom for men to sleep on animal skins with two younger males. He further claimed that \"the young men will offer themselves to strangers and are insulted if the offer is refused\". His claim was later repeated by Greco-Roman writers Athenaeus and Ammianus.[166] H. David Rankin, in Celts and the Classical World, suggests some of these claims refer to bonding rituals in warrior groups, which required abstinence from women at certain times,[167] and says it probably reflects \"the warlike character of early contacts between the Celts and the Greeks\".[168] Under Brehon Law, which was written down in early Medieval Ireland after conversion to Christianity, a woman had the right to divorce her husband and gain his property if he was unable to perform his marital duties due to impotence, obesity, homosexual inclination or preference for other women.[169][170][failed verification] Celtic art is generally used by art historians to refer to art of the La Tène period across Europe, while the Early Medieval art of Britain and Ireland, that is what \"Celtic art\" evokes for much of the general public, is called Insular art in art history. Both styles absorbed considerable influences from non-Celtic sources, but retained a preference for geometrical decoration over figurative subjects, which are often extremely stylised when they do appear; narrative scenes only appear under outside influence. Energetic circular forms, triskeles and spirals are characteristic. Much of the surviving material is in precious metal, which no doubt gives a very unrepresentative picture, but apart from Pictish stones and the Insular high crosses, large monumental sculpture, even with decorative carving, is very rare; possibly it was originally common in wood. Celts were also able to create developed musical instruments such as the carnyces, these famous war trumpets used before the battle to frighten the enemy, as the best preserved found in Tintignac (Gaul) in 2004 and which were decorated with a boar head or a snake head.[171] The interlace patterns that are often regarded as typical of \"Celtic art\" were characteristic of the whole of the British Isles, a style referred to as Insular art, or Hiberno-Saxon art. This artistic style incorporated elements of La Tène, Late Roman, and, most importantly, animal Style II of Germanic Migration Period art. The style was taken up with great skill and enthusiasm by Celtic artists in metalwork and illuminated manuscripts. Equally, the forms used for the finest Insular art were all adopted from the Roman world: Gospel books like the Book of Kells and Book of Lindisfarne, chalices like the Ardagh Chalice and Derrynaflan Chalice, and penannular brooches like the Tara Brooch and Roscrea Brooch. These works are from the period of peak achievement of Insular art, which lasted from the 7th to the 9th centuries, before the Viking attacks sharply set back cultural life.[citation needed] In contrast the less well known but often spectacular art of the richest earlier Continental Celts, before they were conquered by the Romans, often adopted elements of Roman, Greek and other \"foreign\" styles (and possibly used imported craftsmen) to decorate objects that were distinctively Celtic. After the Roman conquests, some Celtic elements remained in popular art, especially Ancient Roman pottery, of which Gaul was actually the largest producer, mostly in Italian styles, but also producing work in local taste, including figurines of deities and wares painted with animals and other subjects in highly formalised styles. Roman Britain also took more interest in enamel than most of the Empire, and its development of champlevé technique was probably important to the later Medieval art of the whole of Europe, of which the energy and freedom of Insular decoration was an important element. Rising nationalism brought Celtic revivals from the 19th century.[citation needed] The Coligny calendar, which was found in 1897 in Coligny, Ain, was engraved on a bronze tablet, preserved in 73 fragments, that originally was 1.48 metres (4 feet 10 inches) wide and 0.9 metres (2 feet 11 inches) high (Lambert p. 111). Based on the style of lettering and the accompanying objects, it probably dates to the end of the 2nd century.[172] It is written in Latin inscriptional capitals, and is in Gaulish. The restored tablet contains 16 vertical columns, with 62 months distributed over 5 years.[citation needed] French archaeologist J. Monard speculated that it was recorded by druids wishing to preserve their tradition of timekeeping in a time when the Julian calendar was imposed throughout the Roman Empire. However, the general form of the calendar suggests the public peg calendars (or parapegmata) found throughout the Greek and Roman world.[173] Tribal warfare appears to have been a regular feature of Celtic societies. While epic literature depicts this as more of a sport focused on raids and hunting rather than organised territorial conquest, the historical record is more of tribes using warfare to exert political control and harass rivals, for economic advantage, and in some instances to conquer territory.[citation needed] The Celts were described by classical writers such as Strabo, Livy, Pausanias, and Florus as fighting like \"wild beasts\", and as hordes. Dionysius said that their:[174] [175] manner of fighting, being in large measure that of wild beasts and frenzied, was an erratic procedure, quite lacking in military science. Thus, at one moment they would raise their swords aloft and smite after the manner of wild boars, throwing the whole weight of their bodies into the blow like hewers of wood or men digging with mattocks, and again they would deliver crosswise blows aimed at no target, as if they intended to cut to pieces the entire bodies of their adversaries, protective armour and all. Polybius (2.33) indicates that the principal Celtic weapon was a long bladed sword which was used for hacking edgewise rather than stabbing. Celtic warriors are described by Polybius and Plutarch as frequently having to cease fighting in order to straighten their sword blades. This claim has been questioned by some archaeologists, who note that Noric steel, steel produced in Celtic Noricum, was famous in the Roman Empire period and was used to equip the Roman military.[176][177] However, Radomir Pleiner, in The Celtic Sword (1993) argues that \"the metallographic evidence shows that Polybius was right up to a point\", as around one third of surviving swords from the period might well have behaved as he describes.[178] In addition to these long bladed slashing swords, spears and specialized javelins were also used.[179] Polybius also asserts that certain of the Celts fought naked: \"The appearance of these naked warriors was a terrifying spectacle, for they were all men of splendid physique and in the prime of life.\"[180] According to Livy, this was also true of the Celts of Asia Minor.[181] Celts had a reputation as head hunters.[182] Paul Jacobsthal says: \"Amongst the Celts the human head was venerated above all else, since the head was to the Celt the soul, centre of the emotions as well as of life itself, a symbol of divinity and of the powers of the other-world.\"[183] Writing in the first century BC, Greek historians Posidonius and Diodorus Siculus said Celtic warriors cut off the heads of enemies slain in battle, hung them from the necks of their horses, then nailed them up outside their homes.[182] Strabo wrote in the same century that Celts embalmed the heads of their most esteemed enemies in cedar oil and put them on display.[182] Roman historian Livy wrote that the Boii beheaded a defeated Roman general after the Battle of Silva Litana, covered his skull in gold, and used it as a ritual cup.[182] Archaeologists have found evidence that heads were embalmed and displayed by the southern Gauls.[184][185] In another example, at the southern Gaulish site of Entremont, there stood a pillar carved with skulls, within which were niches where human skulls were kept, nailed into position.[186] Roquepertuse nearby has similar carved heads and skull niches. Many lone carved heads have been found in Celtic regions, some with two or three faces.[187] Examples include the Mšecké Žehrovice Head and the Corleck Head. Severed heads are a common motif in Insular Celtic myths, and there are many tales in which 'living heads' preside over feasts or speak prophecies.[182][187] The beheading game is a motif in Irish myth and Arthurian legend, most famously in the tale Sir Gawain and the Green Knight, where the Green Knight picks up his own severed head after Gawain has struck it off. There are also many legends in Celtic regions of saints who carry their own severed heads. In Irish myth, the severed heads of warriors are called the mast or nuts of the goddess Macha.[188] Like other European Iron Age societies, the Celts practised a polytheistic religion and believed in an afterlife.[189][190][unreliable source] Celtic religion varied by region and over time, but had \"broad structural similarities\",[189] and there was \"a basic religious homogeneity\" among the Celtic peoples.[191] Because the ancient Celts did not have writing, evidence about their religion is gleaned from archaeology, Greco-Roman accounts, and literature from the early Christian period.[192] The names of over two hundred Celtic deities have survived (see list of Celtic deities), although it is likely that many of these were alternative names, regional names or titles for the same deity.[189] Some deities were venerated only in one region, but others were more widely known.[189] According to Miranda Aldhouse-Green, the Celts were also animists, believing that every part of the natural world had a spirit.[192] The Celts seem to have had a father god, who was often a god of the tribe and of the dead (Toutatis probably being one name for him); and a mother goddess who was associated with the land, earth and fertility[193] (Dea Matrona probably being one name for her). The mother goddess could also take the form of a war goddess as protectress of her tribe and its land.[193] There also seems to have been a male celestial god—identified with Taranis—associated with thunder, the wheel, and the bull.[193] There were gods of skill and craft, such as the pan-regional god Lugus, and the smith god Gobannos.[193] Celtic healing deities were often associated with sacred springs,[193] such as Sirona and Borvo. Other pan-regional deities include the horned god Cernunnos, the horse and fertility goddess Epona, the divine son Maponos, as well as Belenos, Ogmios, and Sucellos.[189][192] Caesar says the Gauls believed they all descended from a god of the dead and underworld.[189] Triplicity is a common theme in Celtic cosmology, and a number of deities were seen as threefold,[194] for example the Three Mothers.[195] Celtic religious ceremonies were overseen by priests known as druids, who also served as judges, teachers, and lore-keepers. Other classes of druids performed sacrifices for the perceived benefit of the community.[196] There is evidence that ancient Celtic peoples sacrificed animals, almost always livestock or working animals. It appears some were offered wholly to the gods (by burying or burning), while some were shared between gods and humans (part eaten and part offered).[197] There is also some evidence that ancient Celts sacrificed humans, and some Greco-Roman sources claim the Gauls sacrificed criminals by burning them in a wicker man.[198] The Romans said the Celts held ceremonies in sacred groves and other natural shrines, called nemetons.[189] Some Celtic peoples built temples or ritual enclosures of varying shapes (such as the Romano-Celtic temple and viereckschanze), though they also maintained shrines at natural sites.[189] Celtic peoples often made votive offerings: treasured items deposited in water and wetlands, or in ritual shafts and wells, often in the same place over generations.[189] Modern clootie wells might be a continuation of this.[199] Most surviving Celtic mythology belongs to the Insular Celtic peoples: Irish mythology has the largest written body of myths, followed by Welsh mythology. These were written down in the early Middle Ages, mainly by Christian scribes. The supernatural race called the Tuatha Dé Danann are believed to represent the main Celtic gods of Ireland. Their traditional rivals are the Fomóire, whom they defeat in the Battle of Mag Tuired.[200] Barry Cunliffe says the underlying structure in Irish myth was a dualism between the male tribal god and the female goddess of the land.[189] The Dagda seems to have been the chief god and the Morrígan his consort, each of whom had other names.[189] One common motif is the sovereignty goddess, who represents the land and bestows sovereignty on a king by marrying him. The goddess Brigid was linked with nature as well as poetry, healing and smithing.[194] Some figures in medieval Insular Celtic myth have ancient continental parallels: Irish Lugh and Welsh Lleu are cognate with Lugus, Goibniu and Gofannon with Gobannos, Macán and Mabon with Maponos, while Macha and Rhiannon may be counterparts of Epona.[201] In Insular Celtic myth, the Otherworld is a parallel realm where the gods dwell. Some mythical heroes visit it by entering ancient burial mounds or caves, by going under water or across the western sea, or after being offered a silver apple branch by an Otherworld resident.[202] Irish myth says that the spirits of the dead travel to the house of Donn (Tech Duinn), a legendary ancestor; this echoes Caesar's comment that the Gauls believed they all descended from a god of the dead and underworld.[189] Insular Celtic peoples celebrated four seasonal festivals, known to the Gaels as Beltaine (1 May), Lughnasa (1 August), Samhain (1 November) and Imbolc (1 February).[189] The Roman invasion of Gaul brought a great deal of Celtic peoples into the Roman Empire. Roman culture had a profound effect on the Celtic tribes which came under the empire's control. Roman influence led to many changes in Celtic religion, the most noticeable of which was the weakening of the druid class, especially religiously; the druids were to eventually disappear altogether. Romano-Celtic deities also began to appear: these deities often had both Roman and Celtic attributes, combined the names of Roman and Celtic deities, or included couples with one Roman and one Celtic deity. Other changes included the adaptation of the Jupiter Column, a sacred column set up in many Celtic regions of the empire, primarily in northern and eastern Gaul. Another major change in religious practice was the use of stone monuments to represent gods and goddesses. The Celts had probably only created wooden cult images (including monuments carved into trees, which were known as sacred poles) before the Roman conquest.[195] While the regions under Roman rule adopted Christianity along with the rest of the Roman empire, unconquered areas of Ireland and Scotland began to move from Celtic polytheism to Christianity in the 5th century. Ireland was converted by missionaries from Britain, such as Saint Patrick. Later missionaries from Ireland were a major source of missionary work in Scotland, Anglo-Saxon parts of Britain, and central Europe (see Hiberno-Scottish mission). Celtic Christianity, the forms of Christianity that took hold in Britain and Ireland at this time, had for some centuries only limited and intermittent contact with Rome and continental Christianity, as well as some contacts with Coptic Christianity. Some elements of Celtic Christianity developed, or retained, features that made them distinct from the rest of Western Christianity, most famously their conservative method of calculating the date of Easter. In 664, the Synod of Whitby began to resolve these differences, mostly by adopting the current Roman practices, which the Gregorian Mission from Rome had introduced to Anglo-Saxon England.[citation needed] Genetic studies on the limited amount of material available suggest continuity between Iron Age people from areas considered Celtic and the earlier Bell Beaker culture of Bronze Age Western Europe.[206][207][208] Like the Bell Beakers, ancient Celts carried a substantial amount of Western Steppe Herders ancestry, which is derived from Yamnaya pastoralists who expanded westwards from the Pontic–Caspian steppe during the late Neolithic and the early Bronze Age and associated with the initial spread of Indo-European languages.[209] This ancestry was particularly prevalent among Celts of Northwest Europe.[208] Examined individuals overwhelmingly carry types of the paternal haplogroup R-M269,[203][204][205] while the maternal haplogroups H and U are frequent.[210][211] These lineages are associated with steppe ancestry.[203][210] The spread of Celts into Iberia and the emergence of the Celtiberians is associated with an increase in north-central European ancestry in Iberia, and may be connected to the expansion of the Urnfield culture.[212] The paternal haplogroup haplogroup I2a1a1a has been detected among Celtiberians.[213] There appears to have been significant gene flow among Celtic peoples of Western Europe during the Iron Age.[214][208] While the Gauls of southern France display genetic links with the Celtiberians, the Gauls of northern France display links with Great Britain and Sweden.[215] Modern populations of Western Europe, particularly those who still speak Celtic languages, display substantial genetic continuity with the Iron Age populations of the same areas.[216][217][218] Geography Organisations",

                "content": "Celtic refers to Irish culture and heritage, along with the historical people who migrated from the British Isles throughout much of Europe. While the early pronunciation was with an /s/ sound, reflecting its nearest origin in French, the modern standard is a hard \"c\" sound like /k/. This is because language historians desired the word to better reflect its Greek and Classical Latin origins. The soft \"c\" sound is usually reserved for sports teams now, like the Boston Celtics. Be it in the pub or in the halls of academia, whenever the topic of Irish culture, language, music, literature—basically, anything Irish—is brought up, the words Celt and Celtic are bound to be heard. In modern-day English, those words are commonly used in reference to the Irish people and their widely-accepted traditions (of course everybody is Irish on St. Patrick's Day; the Celtic cross or knot is a popular tattoo; the Claddagh ring makes a nice gift). The \\k\\ pronunciation for Celt and Celtic dates to the 18th century. The \\k\\ pronunciation for Celt and Celtic dates to the 18th century. The \\k\\ pronunciation for Celt and Celtic dates to the 18th century. The etymology of the noun Celt—from which the adjective Celtic is derived—is straightforward. It's a 16th-century borrowing of the French word Celte, which itself is from Latin Celta, the singular of Celtae, which is the name for a member of an early Indo-European people from antiquity who spread over much of Europe from the British Isles and Spain to Asia Minor. The Latin name is derived from Greek Keltoi, and both the Latin and Greek words referred to the Gauls, the Celtic people who occupied the region that is now France and Belgium. See? Straightforward. With that history laid out, we're wondering how you pronounced all the capital 'c' and 'k' words, especially if you're unfamiliar with French, Latin, Greek, and even English Celt and Celtic, for that matter. The question: is the 'c' sounded \\s\\ or \\k\\? Following its French and Latin predecessors, early pronunciation of Celt was actually \\SELT\\. (In French and Latin, the 'c' is pronounced \\s\\, as in the last name of the French painter Paul Cézanne and in Latin century.) The pronunciation \\KELT\\ started being heard as early as the 18th century, which, in time, ushered in the variant spelling Kelt. The variants were introduced by language and history academics who believed that the pronunciation of Celt should reflect the initial \\k\\ sound in the ancient Greek Keltoi and the Classical Latin Celtae. (It wasn't until the Middle Ages that the letter 'c' in Latin began being pronounced before vowels as the combination \\ts\\—prior, it was pronounced \\k\\; English speakers subsequently reduced the Latin 'c' to a simple \\s\\.) Outside of academia, the variant Kelt never caught on, and it is rarely if ever used today; however, the \\k\\ pronunciation for Celt and Celtic has since flourished. Another influence on pronouncing Celt and Celtic with a soft 'c' is English's phonetic rule for 'c' when followed by 'e' (or 'i,' as in circus or Cicero), which says that, in such cases, the 'c' is usually pronounced as \\s\\. Think cell, cereal, ceiling, and dance. Nevertheless, English speakers, especially those who wanted to sound knowledgeable about things Celtic, grew to prefer the hard 'c' pronunciation, which harkened back to the words' ancient roots. From the 18th century onward, more and more people began sounding the words with an initial \\k\\. By the mid-20th century, \\k\\ became the norm, which is fitting since the pronunciation is in line with that of the Celtic family of languages that include Irish, Scottish Gaelic, Welsh, Breton, and the now-extinct (or, depending on who you talk to, nearly extinct) languages Manx and Cornish. Apparently, people appreciated the ethnic pronunciation. This shift in the pronunciation of Celt is fully evinced when comparing H. W. Fowler's 1926 Dictionary of Modern English with Robert Burchfield's 1996 revised edition. Here's what Fowler had to say about Celt(ic): \"The spelling C-, & the pronunciation s-, are the established ones, & no useful purpose seems to be served by the substitution of k-.\" Decades later, Burchfield observes a different trend: \"Except for the football club Celtic (in Glasgow), which is pronounced [SEL-tik], both Celt and Celtic are pronounced with initial \\k\\ in standard English.\" Burchfield is referring to the Scottish Celtic Football Club, founded in 1887. In America, there is basketball's Boston Celtics, founded in 1946, whose name is also pronounced with an initial \\s\\. The European away support that Celtic enjoys is phenomenal. Few clubs have a fanbase that travels in such numbers or makes as much noise, all the more remarkable when you consider the poor record that the club has away from home in recent times.— Liam Kelly, The Celtic Star, 20 Feb. 2020 Aside from this use of the initial soft 'c' in sports teams' names, Celtic with a hard 'c' is the standard; however, you might still sometimes hear the 'c' softly sounded by those who are uninitiated in the history and etymology of Celt and Celtic as well as those who are unfamiliar with the words and resort to the phonetic rules of English. (And, as happens so often in English, those phonetic rules let them down.) See Definitions and Examples » Get Word of the Day daily email! Learn a new word every day.

                "content": "Watch CBS News By Mark Prussin, John Dias Updated on: December 27, 2024 / 6:40 PM EST / CBS New York NEW YORK -- A fire erupted at the Bryant Park holiday market in Manhattan and damaged several shops just before it opened Friday morning. The fire at the New York City winter tourist attraction was accidentally caused by \"cooking oil coming in contact with combustibles,\" FDNY said on X. Further details from the investigation were not provided, but no injuries were reported and officials said earlier nothing suggested the fire was intentional. Cellphone video shows the terrifying moments the fire inside the Bryant Park Winter Village destroyed at least four shops. People who were working in booths nearby said the flames took over within minutes. \"I hear, 'Fire! Fire!' and some people running down, and then I looked out and the booth just bursted into flames,\" said Delicia Paisley-Smith, with Tribal Home. The fire spread to Criollas Empanadas next door. \"We're used to resilience. We opened during the pandemic,\" said owner Mario Vivas. \"It's still the high season for us. Between Christmas and New Year's, we get a lot of tourists here.\" It took dozens of firefighters about 30 minutes to get the fire under control. The nearby ice rink was also damaged in the fire, authorities said. But most shops were open all day Friday, while the tourist hot spots still attracted large crowds. \"We are grateful for the FDNY's quick response to the incident that occurred earlier today. The Rink and The Lodge are currently open. Most of The Holiday Shops have reopened, and we expect all the Holiday Shops that were not affected by the fire to reopen later today,\" a Bryant Park spokesperson said in a statement to CBS News New York. In the meantime, traffic around Bryant Park was being disrupted due to the emergency response, primarily on West 40th Street between Fifth Avenue and Sixth. This is the second fire at a Manhattan holiday market this month. Last week, a fire tore through booths at the Herald Square Holiday Market, leaving at least one firefighter injured. FDNY does not believe the fires are connected. Mark Prussin is a digital producer at CBS New York.

Please enter a valid zipcode. Save Crews Friday morning responded to a fire at the Bryant Park Winter Village, officials said. Flames erupted just before 9:30 a.m. at a kiosk near 40th Street, between Fifth and Sixth avenues, the FDNY reported. According to FDNY Battalion Chief Joe Castellano, the kiosk, which housed cooking instruments, measured 6 feet by 40 feet and was divided into four separate storefronts. The fire was contained in less than an hour, around 10 a.m., Castellano said. The entire kiosk was destroyed, with slight damage to a neighboring kiosk and some heat damage to the roof of the nearby ice skating rink, he said. No injuries were reported in connection with the blaze, and Castellano said there are no ongoing concerns about fires at other holiday markets across the city. The FDNY ruled the fire accidental late Friday afternoon, saying it was caused by cooking oil coming in contact with combustibles. In a statement provided to NY1, a Bryant Park spokesperson said the park was \"grateful for the FDNY's quick response to the incident that occurred earlier today.\" \"The Rink and The Lodge are currently open. Most of The Holiday Shops have reopened, and we expect all the Holiday Shops that were not affected by the fire to reopen later today,\" the spokesperson said. The Winter Village is set to run through Jan. 5.",
