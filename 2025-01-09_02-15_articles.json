                "content": "Samuel Harris Altman (born April 22, 1985) is an American entrepreneur and investor best known as the chief executive officer of OpenAI since 2019 (he was briefly fired and reinstated in November 2023).[1] He is also the chairman of clean energy companies Oklo Inc. and Helion Energy.[2] Altman is considered to be one of the leading figures of the AI boom.[3][4][5] He dropped out of Stanford University after two years and founded Loopt, a mobile social networking service, raising more than $30 million in venture capital. In 2011, Altman joined Y Combinator, a startup accelerator, and was its president from 2014 to 2019.[6] Altman was born on April 22, 1985, in Chicago, Illinois,[7][8] into a Jewish family,[9] and grew up in St. Louis, Missouri. His mother is a dermatologist, while his father was a real estate broker. Altman is the eldest of four siblings.[10] At the age of eight, he received his first computer, an Apple Macintosh, and began to learn how to code and take apart computer hardware.[11][12] He attended John Burroughs School, a private school in Ladue, Missouri.[13] In 2005, after two years at Stanford University studying computer science, he dropped out without earning a bachelor's degree.[14][15] In 2005, at the age of 19,[16] Sam Altman co-founded Loopt,[17] a location-based social networking mobile application. As CEO, he raised more than $30 million in venture capital for the company, including an initial investment of $5 million from Patrick Chung of Xfund and his team at New Enterprise Associates, followed by investments from Sequoia Capital and Y Combinator.[18] In March 2012, after Loopt failed to gain significant user traction, the company was acquired by the Green Dot Corporation for $43.4 million.[19] In April 2012, Altman co-founded Hydrazine Capital with his brother, Jack Altman.[20][21] The venture capital firm is still in operation and focuses on early-stage tech investments.[22] In 2011, Altman became a partner at Y Combinator (YC), a startup accelerator that invests in a wide range of startups, initially working on a part-time basis.[23] In February 2014, he was named president of YC by co-founder Paul Graham.[24] In a 2014 blog post, Altman stated that the total valuation of YC companies had surpassed $65 billion, including Airbnb, Dropbox, Zenefits, and Stripe.[25] He aimed to expand YC to fund 1,000 new companies per year and sought to broaden the types of companies funded, particularly focusing on \"hard technology\" startups.[26] In October 2015, Altman announced YC Continuity, a $700 million equity fund designed to invest in YC companies as they matured.[27][28] A week earlier, he had introduced Y Combinator Research, a non-profit research lab, donating $10 million of his own funds to establish it.[29] In December 2015, Altman co-founded OpenAI, an artificial intelligence research organization, alongside notable figures such as Elon Musk, Jessica Livingston, and Peter Thiel. OpenAI was established with the goal of promoting and developing friendly AI for the benefit of humanity.[30][31] The organization was initially funded with $1 billion in commitments from its founders and other investors, including Microsoft and Amazon Web Services. In September 2016, Altman announced his expanded role as president of YC Group, which included Y Combinator and other units.[32] In March 2019, YC announced Altman's transition from president to a less hands-on role as chairman of the board, allowing him to focus on OpenAI.[33][34] This decision came shortly after YC announced it would be moving its headquarters to San Francisco.[35] As of early 2020, he was no longer affiliated with YC.[36] In 2019, Altman co-founded Tools For Humanity,[37] a company that builds and distributes systems designed to scan people's eyes to provide authentication and verify proof of personhood to counter fraud. Participants who agree to have their eyes scanned are compensated with a cryptocurrency called Worldcoin.[38][39][40][41] Tools For Humanity describes its cryptocurrency as similar to universal basic income.[42][43] A Hong Kong regulator directed Worldcoin to cease operations there, stating that scanning and collecting iris and face images was \"unnecessary and excessive\".[44] Altman has several other investments in companies including Humane, which is developing a wearable AI-powered device; Retro Biosciences, a research company aiming to extend human life by 10 years;[45] and Helion Energy, an American fusion research company. OpenAI was initially funded by Altman, Greg Brockman, Elon Musk, Jessica Livingston, Peter Thiel, Microsoft, Amazon Web Services, Infosys and YC Research. When OpenAI launched in 2015, it had raised $1 billion.[46] In March 2019, Altman left Y Combinator to focus full-time on OpenAI as CEO.[47][1] By the summer of 2019, he had helped raise $1 billion from Microsoft.[48] Altman testified before the United States Senate Judiciary Subcommittee on Privacy, Technology and the Law on May 16, 2023, about issues of AI oversight.[49] After the success of ChatGPT, the company's chatbot application, Altman made a world tour in May 2023, during which he visited 22 countries and met multiple leaders and diplomats, including British prime minister Rishi Sunak, French president Emmanuel Macron, Spanish prime minister Pedro SÃ¡nchez, German chancellor Olaf Scholz, Indian prime minister Narendra Modi, South Korean president Yoon Suk-yeol and Israeli president Isaac Herzog. He stood for a photo with European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen.[10] On Friday, November 17, 2023, OpenAI's board, composed of researcher Helen Toner, Quora CEO Adam D'Angelo, AI governance advocate Tasha McCauley, and most prominently in the firing, OpenAI co-founder and chief scientist Ilya Sutskever, announced that they had made the decision to remove Altman as CEO and Greg Brockman from the board, both of whom were co-founders.[50] The announcement cited that Altman \"was not consistently candid in his communications\" in a public announcement on the OpenAI blog.[51][50] In response, Brockman resigned from his role as President of OpenAI.[52] The day after Altman was removed, The Verge reported that Altman and the board were in talks to bring him back to OpenAI.[53] On November 20, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella announced that Altman would be joining Microsoft to lead a new advanced AI research team.[54] Two days later, OpenAI employees published an open letter to the board threatening to leave OpenAI and join Microsoft, where all employees had been promised jobs, unless all board members step down and reinstate Altman as CEO. 505 employees initially signed, which later grew to over 700 out of 770 total employees.[55] This included Ilya Sutskever, who had previously advocated for firing Altman, but now had apologized stating on Twitter, \"I regret my participation in the board's actions.\" Late in the night on November 20, OpenAI announced that they had reached an \"agreement in principle\" for Altman to return as CEO and Brockman to return as president.[56][57] The current board was to resign, other than D'Angelo, who was kept to represent the views of the previous board.[56] On March 8, 2024, OpenAI announced that Altman would rejoin the board of directors after a review by law firm WilmerHale.[58] In May 2024, after OpenAI's non-disparagement agreements were exposed, Altman was accused of lying when claiming to have been unaware of the equity cancellation provision for departing employees that don't sign the agreement.[59] Also in May, former board member Helen Toner explained the board's rationale for firing Altman in November 2023. She stated that Altman had withheld information, for example about the release of ChatGPT and his ownership of OpenAI's startup fund. She also alleged that two executives in OpenAI had reported to the board \"psychological abuse\" from Altman, and provided screenshots and documentation to support their claims. She said that many employees feared retaliation if they didn't support Altman, and that when Altman was Loopt's CEO, the management team asked twice to fire him for what they called \"deceptive and chaotic behavior\".[60][61] For eight days in 2014, Altman was the CEO of Reddit, a social media company, after CEO Yishan Wong resigned.[62][63] He announced the return of Steve Huffman as CEO on July 10, 2015.[64] He remained on its board until 2022.[65] Altman invested in multiple rounds of funding Reddit, in 2014, 2015, and 2021.[65][66] Prior to Reddit's initial public offering in 2024, Altman was listed as its third-largest shareholder, with around nine percent ownership.[67] During the COVID-19 pandemic, Altman helped fund and create Project Covalence to help researchers rapidly launch clinical trials in partnership with TrialSpark, a clinical trial startup.[68] During the depositor run on Silicon Valley Bank in mid-March 2023, Altman provided capital to multiple startups.[69] Altman invests in technology startups and nuclear energy companies. Some of his portfolio companies include Airbnb, Stripe and Retro Biosciences.[70] He is also chairman of the board for Helion Energy, a company focused on developing nuclear fusion, and Oklo Inc., a nuclear fission company.[71][72] In March 2021, Altman and investment banker Michael Klein co-founded AltC Acquisition Corp, a special-purpose acquisition company (SPAC), where he is also the CEO.[2][73] In May 2024, Oklo Inc. completed a merger with the SPAC to become a public company. Altman remained as chairman of Oklo following the merger.[74] Altman debuted on the Bloomberg Billionaires Index in March 2024 with an estimated net worth of $2 billion, primarily from his venture capital funds related to Hydrazine Capital.[75] Sam Altman has recently expanded his investment portfolio to include stakes in over 400 companies, valued at around $2.8 billion. Some of these investments intersect with companies doing business with OpenAI, which has raised questions about potential conflicts of interest, though Altman and OpenAI maintain that these are managed transparently. Additionally, Altman has been involved in discussions about the future of AI, focusing on ethical challenges and the role of AI in scientific discovery.[citation needed] In 2017, Altman received an honorary Doctor of Engineering degree from the University of Waterloo in Canada for supporting companies through its Velocity entrepreneurship program.[76] The government of Indonesia issued the country's first \"golden visa\", a 10-year border pass, to Altman in September 2023.[77] In 2024, Xfund awarded Altman the annual Experiment Cup at an event at Harvard University.[78] In 2023, Altman was named one of the 100 most influential people in the world[79] and CEO of the Year by Time magazine.[80] He was also on the Time's list of the 100 most influential people in AI in 2023[81] and in 2024.[82] He was one of the \"Best Young Entrepreneurs in Technology\" by Businessweek in 2008,[83] and the top investor under 30 by Forbes magazine in 2015.[84] Altman was invited to attend the Bilderberg Meeting in 2016,[85] 2022,[86] and 2023.[87][88] Walter Isaacson opined that Altman had \"Musk-like intensity\" and that it had been instrumental in the founding of OpenAI in partnership with Elon Musk.[89] In late February 2024 Musk sued OpenAI and Altman, alleging they broke the companyâs founding agreement by giving priority to profit over benefit to humanity.[90] A few days later OpenAI executives, including Altman, dismissed these claims in a blog post.[91] The post said that the startup received only $45 million from Musk instead of his commitment of $1 billion and that Musk proposed to merge it with Tesla.[92] Altman has been a vegetarian since childhood.[93] Altman is openly gay.[94][95][96] He disclosed his sexuality at the age of 17[94] in high school,[95][96] where he spoke out after some students objected to a National Coming Out Day speaker.[94][97] He dated Loopt co-founder Nick Sivo for nine years. They broke up shortly after the company was acquired in 2012.[95] Altman married engineer Oliver Mulherin in January 2024,[98] at their estate in Hawaii;[99] the pair also live in San Francisco's Russian Hill neighborhood and often spend weekends in Napa, California.[96][100] They committed to giving away most of their wealth by signing the Giving Pledge in May 2024.[101] Altman is an apocalypse preparer.[8][102] He said in 2016: \"I have guns, gold, potassium iodide, antibiotics, batteries, water, gas masks from the Israel Defense Forces, and a big patch of land in Big Sur I can fly to.\"[8] In January 2025, Altmanâs sister Ann filed a lawsuit alleging sexual abuse by Altman in the U.S. District Court in the Eastern District of Missouri. The lawsuit alleges that the abuse started when Ann Altman was 3 and Sam Altman was 12. Altman was reported as denying the allegations.[103] Altman had contemplated running for governor of California in the 2018 election, but later decided not to enter.[104] In 2018, Altman announced \"the United Slate\", a political project to improve U.S. housing and healthcare policy.[105] In 2019, Altman held a fundraiser at his home in San Francisco for 2020 Democratic presidential candidate and fellow tech entrepreneur Andrew Yang.[106] In May 2020, Altman donated $250,000 to American Bridge 21st Century, a super PAC supporting Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden.[107] Altman is a supporter of land value taxation[108] and the payment of universal basic income (UBI).[109] In 2021, he wrote a blog post titled, \"Moore's Law for Everything,\" which stated his belief that within ten years' time, AI could generate $13,500 of yearly UBI in the United States.[110] In 2024, he suggested a new kind of UBI called \"universal basic compute\" to give everyone a \"slice\" of ChatGPT's computing power.[109] On November 18, 2024, San Francisco Mayor-Elect Daniel Lurie named him to his transition team.[111] In December 2024, it was reported that Altman would donate $1 million to the Inaugural Fund for President-elect Donald Trump.[112]",

                "content": "The second birthday of ChatGPT was only a little over a month ago, and now we have transitioned into the next paradigm of models that can do complex reasoning. New years get people in a reflective mood, and I wanted to share some personal thoughts about how it has gone so far, and some of the things Iâve learned along the way. As we get closer to AGI, it feels like an important time to look at the progress of our company. There is still so much to understand, still so much we donât know, and itâs still so early. But we know a lot more than we did when we started. We started OpenAI almost nine years ago because we believed that AGI was possible, and that it could be the most impactful technology in human history. We wanted to figure out how to build it and make it broadly beneficial; we were excited to try to make our mark on history. Our ambitions were extraordinarily high and so was our belief that the work might benefit society in an equally extraordinary way. At the time, very few people cared, and if they did, it was mostly because they thought we had no chance of success. In 2022, OpenAI was a quiet research lab working on something temporarily called âChat With GPT-3.5â. (We are much better at research than we are at naming things.) We had been watching people use the playground feature of our API and knew that developers were really enjoying talking to the model. We thought building a demo around that experience would show people something important about the future and help us make our models better and safer. We ended up mercifully calling it ChatGPT instead, and launched it on November 30th of 2022. We always knew, abstractly, that at some point we would hit a tipping point and the AI revolution would get kicked off. But we didnât know what the moment would be. To our surprise, it turned out to be this. The launch of ChatGPT kicked off a growth curve like nothing we have ever seenâin our company, our industry, and the world broadly. We are finally seeing some of the massive upside we have always hoped for from AI, and we can see how much more will come soon. It hasnât been easy. The road hasnât been smooth and the right choices havenât been obvious. In the last two years, we had to build an entire company, almost from scratch, around this new technology. There is no way to train people for this except by doing it, and when the technology category is completely new, there is no one at all who can tell you exactly how it should be done. Building up a company at such high velocity with so little training is a messy process. Itâs often two steps forward, one step back (and sometimes, one step forward and two steps back). Mistakes get corrected as you go along, but there arenât really any handbooks or guideposts when youâre doing original work. Moving at speed in uncharted waters is an incredible experience, but it is also immensely stressful for all the players. Conflicts and misunderstanding abound. These years have been the most rewarding, fun, best, interesting, exhausting, stressful, andâparticularly for the last twoâunpleasant years of my life so far. The overwhelming feeling is gratitude; I know that someday Iâll be retired at our ranch watching the plants grow, a little bored, and will think back at how cool it was that I got to do the work I dreamed of since I was a little kid. I try to remember that on any given Friday, when seven things go badly wrong by 1 pm. A little over a year ago, on one particular Friday, the main thing that had gone wrong that day was that I got fired by surprise on a video call, and then right after we hung up the board published a blog post about it. I was in a hotel room in Las Vegas. It felt, to a degree that is almost impossible to explain, like a dream gone wrong. Getting fired in public with no warning kicked off a really crazy few hours, and a pretty crazy few days. The âfog of warâ was the strangest part. None of us were able to get satisfactory answers about what had happened, or why. The whole event was, in my opinion, a big failure of governance by well-meaning people, myself included. Looking back, I certainly wish I had done things differently, and Iâd like to believe Iâm a better, more thoughtful leader today than I was a year ago. I also learned the importance of a board with diverse viewpoints and broad experience in managing a complex set of challenges. Good governance requires a lot of trust and credibility. I appreciate the way so many people worked together to build a stronger system of governance for OpenAI that enables us to pursue our mission of ensuring that AGI benefits all of humanity. My biggest takeaway is how much I have to be thankful for and how many people I owe gratitude towards: to everyone who works at OpenAI and has chosen to spend their time and effort going after this dream, to friends who helped us get through the crisis moments, to our partners and customers who supported us and entrusted us to enable their success, and to the people in my life who showed me how much they cared. [1] We all got back to the work in a more cohesive and positive way and Iâm very proud of our focus since then. We have done what is easily some of our best research ever. We grew from about 100 million weekly active users to more than 300 million. Most of all, we have continued to put technology out into the world that people genuinely seem to love and that solves real problems. Nine years ago, we really had no idea what we were eventually going to become; even now, we only sort of know. AI development has taken many twists and turns and we expect more in the future. Some of the twists have been joyful; some have been hard. Itâs been fun watching a steady stream of research miracles occur, and a lot of naysayers have become true believers. Weâve also seen some colleagues split off and become competitors. Teams tend to turn over as they scale, and OpenAI scales really fast. I think some of this is unavoidableâstartups usually see a lot of turnover at each new major level of scale, and at OpenAI numbers go up by orders of magnitude every few months. The last two years have been like a decade at a normal company. When any company grows and evolves so fast, interests naturally diverge. And when any company in an important industry is in the lead, lots of people attack it for all sorts of reasons, especially when they are trying to compete with it. Our vision wonât change; our tactics will continue to evolve. For example, when we started we had no idea we would have to build a product company; we thought we were just going to do great research. We also had no idea we would need such a crazy amount of capital. There are new things we have to go build now that we didnât understand a few years ago, and there will be new things in the future we can barely imagine now. We are proud of our track-record on research and deployment so far, and are committed to continuing to advance our thinking on safety and benefits sharing. We continue to believe that the best way to make an AI system safe is by iteratively and gradually releasing it into the world, giving society time to adapt and co-evolve with the technology, learning from experience, and continuing to make the technology safer. We believe in the importance of being world leaders on safety and alignment research, and in guiding that research with feedback from real world applications. We are now confident we know how to build AGI as we have traditionally understood it. We believe that, in 2025, we may see the first AI agents âjoin the workforceâ and materially change the output of companies. We continue to believe that iteratively putting great tools in the hands of people leads to great, broadly-distributed outcomes. We are beginning to turn our aim beyond that, to superintelligence in the true sense of the word. We love our current products, but we are here for the glorious future. With superintelligence, we can do anything else. Superintelligent tools could massively accelerate scientific discovery and innovation well beyond what we are capable of doing on our own, and in turn massively increase abundance and prosperity. This sounds like science fiction right now, and somewhat crazy to even talk about it. Thatâs alrightâweâve been there before and weâre OK with being there again. Weâre pretty confident that in the next few years, everyone will see what we see, and that the need to act with great care, while still maximizing broad benefit and empowerment, is so important. Given the possibilities of our work, OpenAI cannot be a normal company. How lucky and humbling it is to be able to play a role in this work. (Thanks to Josh Tyrangiel for sort of prompting this. I wish we had had a lot more time.) [1] There were a lot of people who did incredible and gigantic amounts of work to help OpenAI, and me personally, during those few days, but two people stood out from all others. Ron Conway and Brian Chesky went so far above and beyond the call of duty that Iâm not even sure how to describe it. Iâve of course heard stories about Ronâs ability and tenaciousness for years and Iâve spent a lot of time with Brian over the past couple of years getting a huge amount of help and advice. But thereâs nothing quite like being in the foxhole with people to see what they can really do. I am reasonably confident OpenAI would have fallen apart without their help; they worked around the clock for days until things were done. Although they worked unbelievably hard, they stayed calm and had clear strategic thought and great advice throughout. They stopped me from making several mistakes and made none themselves. They used their vast networks for everything needed and were able to navigate many complex situations. And Iâm sure they did a lot of things I donât know about. What I will remember most, though, is their care, compassion, and support. I thought I knew what it looked like to support a founder and a company, and in some small sense I did. But I have never before seen, or even heard of, anything like what these guys did, and now I get more fully why they have the legendary status they do. They are different and both fully deserve their genuinely unique reputations, but they are similar in their remarkable ability to move mountains and help, and in their unwavering commitment in times of need. The tech industry is far better off for having both of them in it. There are others like them; it is an amazingly special thing about our industry and does much more to make it all work than people realize. I look forward to paying it forward. On a more personal note, thanks especially to Ollie for his support that weekend and always; he is incredible in every way and no one could ask for a better partner. There are two things from our announcement today I wanted to highlight. First, a key part of our mission is to put very capable AI tools in the hands of people for free (or at a great price). I am very proud that weâve made the best model in the world available for free in ChatGPT, without ads or anything like that. Our initial conception when we started OpenAI was that weâd create AI and use it to create all sorts of benefits for the world. Instead, it now looks like weâll create AI and then other people will use it to create all sorts of amazing things that we all benefit from. We are a business and will find plenty of things to charge for, and that will help us provide free, outstanding AI service to (hopefully) billions of people. Second, the new voice (and video) mode is the best computer interface Iâve ever used. It feels like AI from the movies; and itâs still a bit surprising to me that itâs real. Getting to human-level response times and expressiveness turns out to be a big change. The original ChatGPT showed a hint of what was possible with language interfaces; this new thing feels viscerally different. It is fast, smart, fun, natural, and helpful. Talking to a computer has never felt really natural for me; now it does. As we add (optional) personalization, access to your information, the ability to take actions on your behalf, and more, I can really see an exciting future where we are able to use computers to do much more than ever before. Finally, huge thanks to the team that poured so much work into making this happen! Helion has been progressing even faster than I expected and is on pace in 2024 to 1) demonstrate Q > 1 fusion and 2) resolve all questions needed to design a mass-producible fusion generator. The goals of the company are quite ambitiousâclean, continuous energy for 1 cent per kilowatt-hour, and the ability to manufacture enough power plants to satisfy the current electrical demand of earth in a ten year period. If both things happen, it will transform the world. Abundant, clean, and radically inexpensive energy will elevate the quality of life for all of usâthink about how much the cost of energy factors into what we do and use. Also, electricity at this price will allow us to do things like efficiently capture carbon (so although weâll still rely on gasoline for awhile, itâll be ok). Although Helionâs scientific progress of the past 8 years is phenomenal and necessary, it is not sufficient to rapidly get to this new energy economy. Helion now needs to figure out how to engineer machines that donât break, how to build a factory and supply chain capable of manufacturing a machine every day, how to work with power grids and governments around the world, and more. The biggest input to the degree and speed of success at the company is now the talent of the people who join the team. Here are a few of the most critical jobs, but please donât let the lack of a perfect fit deter you from applying. Electrical Engineer, Low Voltage: https://boards.greenhouse.io/helionenergy/jobs/4044506005Electrical Engineer, Pulsed Power: https://boards.greenhouse.io/helionenergy/jobs/4044510005Mechanical Engineer, Generator Systems: https://boards.greenhouse.io/helionenergy/jobs/4044522005Manager of Mechanical Engineering: https://boards.greenhouse.io/helionenergy/jobs/4044521005 Today we did a research launch of DALLâ¢E 2, a new AI tool that can create and edit images from natural language instructions. Most importantly, we hope people love the tool and find it useful. For me, itâs the most delightful thing to play with weâve created so far. I find it to be creativity-enhancing, helpful for many different situations, and fun in a way I havenât felt from technology in a while. But I also think itâs noteworthy for a few reasons: 1) This is another example of what I think is going to be a new computer interface trend: you say what you want in natural language or with contextual clues, and the computer does it. We offer this for code and now image generation; both of these will get a lot better. But the same trend will happen in new ways until eventually it works for complex tasksâwe can imagine an âAI office workerâ that takes requests in natural language like a human does. 2) It sure does seem to âunderstandâ concepts at many levels and how they relate to each other in sophisticated ways. 3) Copilot is a tool that helps coders be more productive, but still is very far from being able to create a full program. DALLâ¢E 2 is a tool that will help artists and illustrators be more creative, but it can also create a âcomplete workâ. This may be an early example of the impact AI on labor markets. Although I firmly believe AI will create lots of new jobs, and make many existing jobs much better by doing the boring bits well, I think itâs important to be honest that itâs increasingly going to make some jobs not very relevant (like technology frequently does). 4) Itâs a reminder that predictions about AI are very difficult to make. A decade ago, the conventional wisdom was that AI would first impact physical labor, and then cognitive labor, and then maybe someday it could do creative work. It now looks like itâs going to go in the opposite order. 5) Itâs an example of a world in which good ideas are the limit for what we can do, not specific skills. 6) Although the upsides are great, the model is powerful enough that it's easy to imagine the downsides. Hopefully this summer, weâll do a product launch and people will be able to use it for all sorts of things. We wanted to start with a research launch to figure out how to minimize the downsides in collaboration with a larger group of researchers and artists, and to give people some time to adapt to the changeâin general, we are believers in incremental deployment strategies. (Obviously the world already has Photoshop and we already know that images can be manipulated, for good and bad.) (A robot hand drawing, by DALLâ¢E) Iâm delighted to be investing more in Helion. Helion is by far the most promising approach to fusion Iâve seen. David and Chris are two of the most impressive founders and builders (in the sense of building fusion machines, in addition to building companies!) I have ever met, and they have done something remarkable. When I first invested in them back in 2014, I was struck by the thoughtfulness of their plans about the scientific approach, the system design, cost optimizations, and the fuel cycle. And now, with a tiny fraction of the money spent on other fusion efforts but the culture of a startup, they and their team have built a generator that produces electricity. Helion has a clear path to net electricity by 2024, and has a long-term goal of delivering electricity for 1 cent per kilowatt-hour. (!) If this all works as we hope, we may have a path out of the climate crisis. Even though there are a lot of emissions that donât come from electrical generation, weâd be able to use abundant energy to capture carbon and other greenhouses gases. And if we have much cheaper energy than ever before, we can do things that are difficult to imagine today. The cost of energy is one of the fundamental inputs in the costs of so much else; dramatically cheaper energy will lead to dramatically better quality of life for many people. A founder recently asked me how to stop caring what other people think. I didnât have an answer, and after reflecting on it more, I think it's the wrong question. Almost everyone cares what someone thinks (though caring what everyone thinks is definitely a mistake), and it's probably important. Caring too much makes you a sheep. But you need to be at least a little in tune with others to do something useful for them. It seems like there are two degrees of freedom: you can choose the people whose opinions you care about (and on what subjects), and you can choose the timescale you care about them on. Most people figure out the former [1] but the latter doesnât seem to get much attention. The most impressive people I know care a lot about what people think, even people whose opinions they really shouldnât value (a surprising numbers of them do something like keeping a folder of screenshots of tweets from haters). But what makes them unusual is that they generally care about other peopleâs opinions on a very long time horizonâas long as the history books get it right, they take some pride in letting the newspapers get it wrong. You should trade being short-term low-status for being long-term high-status, which most people seem unwilling to do. A common way this happens is by eventually being right about an important but deeply non-consensus bet. But there are lots of other waysâthe key observation is that as long as you are right, being misunderstood by most people is a strength not a weakness. You and a small group of rebels get the space to solve an important problem that might otherwise not get solved. [1] In the memorable words of Coco Chanel, âI donât care what you think about me. I donât think about you at all.â A lot of people want to replicate YC in some other industry or some other place or with some other strategy. In general, people seem to assume that: 1) although there was some degree of mystery or luck about how YC got going, it canât be that hard, and 2) if you can get it off the ground, the network effects are self-sustaining. More YC-like things are good for the world; I generally try to be helpful. But almost none of them work. People are right about the self-sustaining part, but they canât figure out how to get something going. The entire secret to YC getting going was PG and Jessicaâthere was no other magic trick. A few times a year, I end up in a conversation at a party where someone tells a story about how much PG changed their lifeâpeople speak with more gratitude than they do towards pretty much anyone else. Then everyone else agrees, YC founders and otherwise (non-YC founders might talk about an impactful essay or getting hired at a YC company). Jessica still sadly doesnât get nearly the same degree of public credit, but the people who were around the early days of YC know the real story. What did they do? They took bets on unknown people and believed in them more than anyone had before. They set strong norms and fought back hard against bad behavior towards YC founders. They trusted their own convictions, were willing to do things their way, and were willing to be disliked by the existing power structures. They focused on the most important things, they worked hard, and they spent a huge amount of time 1:1 with people. They understood the value of community and long-term orientation. When YC was very small, it felt like a family. Perhaps most importantly, they built an ecosystem (thanks to Joe Gebbia for pointing this out). This is easy to talk about but hard to do, because it requires not being greedy. YC has left a lot of money on the table; other people have made more money from the ecosystem than YC has itself. This has cemented YCâs placeâthe benefits to the partners, alumni, current batch founders, Hacker News readers, Demo Day investors, and everyone else around YC is a huge part of what makes it work. I am not sure if any of this is particularly useful adviceânone of it sounds that hard, and yet in the 15 years since, it hasnât been close to replicated. But it seems worth trying. I am pretty sure no one has had a bigger total impact on the careers of people in the startup industry over that time period than the two of them. I spent many years working with founders and now I work with researchers. Although there are always individual exceptions, on average itâs surprising to me how different the best people in these groups are (including in some qualities that I had assumed were present in great people everywhere, like very high levels of self-belief). So Iâve been thinking about the ways theyâre the same, because maybe there is something to learn about qualities of really effective people in general. The best people in both groups spend a lot of time reflecting on some version of the Hamming questionâ\"what are the most important problems in your field, and why arenât you working on them?â In general, no one reflects on this question enough, but the best people do it the most, and have the best âproblem tasteâ, which is some combination of learning to think independently, reason about the future, and identify attack vectors. (This from John Schulman is worth reading: http://joschu.net/blog/opinionated-guide-ml-research.html). They have a laser focus on the next step in front of them combined with long-term vision. Most people only have one or the other. They are extremely persistent and willing to work hard. As far as I can tell, there is no high-probability way to be very successful without this, and you should be suspicious of people who tell you otherwise unless youâd be happy having their career (and be especially suspicious if they worked hard themselves). They have a bias towards action and trying things, and theyâre clear-eyed and honest about what is working and what isnât (importantly, this goes both waysâIâm amazed by how many people will see something working and then not pursue it). They are creative idea-generatorsâa lot of the ideas may be terrible, but there is never a shortage. They really value autonomy and have a hard time with rules that they donât think make sense. They are definitely not lemmings. Their motivations are often more complex than they seemâspecifically, they are frequently very driven by genuine curiosity. Almost every company and non-profit working on COVID-19 that I offered to help asked for support with clinical trialsâfor companies focusing on developing novel drugs, vaccines, and diagnostics, rapidly spinning up trials is one of their biggest bottlenecks. Science remains the only way out of the COVID-19 crisis. Dramatically improving clinical trials, which are usually time-consuming and cost tens to hundreds of millions of dollars, is one of the highest-leverage ways to get out of it faster. The goal of this project, in collaboration with TrialSpark and Dr. Mark Fishman, is to offer much better clinical trial support to COVID-19 projects than anything that currently exists. Project Covalenceâs platform, powered by TrialSpark, is uniquely optimized to support COVID-19 trials, which are ideally run in community settings or at the patientâs home to reduce the burden placed on hospitals and health systems. Project Covalence is well-positioned to tackle the operational and logistical challenges involved in launching such trials, and supports trial execution, 21 CFR Part 11 compliant remote data collection, telemedicine, biostatistics, sample kits for at-home specimen collection, and protocol writing. Researchers across academia and industry can leverage this shared infrastructure to rapidly launch their clinical trials. To facilitate coordination between studies, we will also be creating master protocols for platform studies to enable shared control arms and adaptive trial designs. If youâre interested in getting involved or have a trial that needs support, please get in touch at ProjectCovalence@trialspark.com or visit www.projectcovalence.com.",

PATRICK COLLISON: Hi, Sam. Thanks very much for joining us today. SAM ALTMAN: Hi, Patrick. Glad to be here, but I thought I was supposed to be talking about John. PATRICK COLLISON: Hmm, I think John has a bug. JOHN COLLISON: Get out of here, Patrick. You had your own talk this morning. Sorry, Sam. Patrickâs always deepfaking his way into my talks. Anyway, we should probably step out of these little circles and get going. (Music playing) JOHN COLLISON: All righty. I am delighted to be joined here in the flesh properly with Sam Altman. And Sam is at this stage basically part of Silicon Valley lore. You founded Loopt when you were 19? SAM ALTMAN: I think so. JOHN COLLISON: Eighteen? Yeah. And then youâre on stage for the original iPhone launch as, you know, one of the key partners. You sold Loopt to Green Dot. Sam ran Y Combinator for many, many years and most recently founded OpenAI, which powered many of the demos, you know, the GPT-powered natural language queries that you saw earlier in the keynote. So, Sam, thank you. SAM ALTMAN: Thanks for having me. JOHN COLLISON: You tweeted in 2014, long before you I saw this reference recently, long before you started OpenAI: AI will either be the best or worst thing ever, highest volatility of any tech I can think of. How are we doing? SAM ALTMAN: I think weâre going to be great. JOHN COLLISON: Okay. SAM ALTMAN: I am much more confident than but I donât remember tweeting that, but Iâm much more confident than I felt around then, at that time, about the ability to manage this. I think we are on such a different technology tree than my default would have been and the way things were going then. I thought this idea that weâre going to have, like, RL agents that learn to play increasingly more complex games, where theyâre really just trying to, like, beat humans, and sort of weâre going to, like, keep letting that go, that didnât seem like a great trajectory to me. But I think what weâre doing now, where we have systems that are really optimized to help us and work in a way that we can sort of see what theyâre doing step by step, even if we canât see exactly whatâs happening inside the neural network, I feel way better. JOHN COLLISON: Oh, okay. Because you have been kind of an AI doomer in the past, that this stuff is really dangerous. So it sounds like youâre meaningfully less so now? SAM ALTMAN: Yeah. Well, I still think we have to treat this with, like, extreme seriousness and that there is legitimate existential risk here, but I think through the hard work of people at OpenAI and other AGI labs, weâre making significant progress and still have a very long way to go towards, like, a trajectory we can all be pretty happy about. JOHN COLLISON: Thereâs probably a set of people here who follow the Internet very closely and have read a lot of LessWrong posts and, you know, keep up with what, you know, Eliezer is saying and everything and get why one might be worried about AI. And then I think thereâs probably a set of people here who just, you know, have real lives, and they, you know, look at the progress in AI, and theyâre, like, thatâs cool, and, you know, autocorrect still doesnât work that well. And just it doesnât seem like certainly the AI in my autocorrect is, you know out -- is going to kill me anytime soon. What is if people are going to worry about AI, what should they be worried about? SAM ALTMAN: How many people are really worried about AI? JOHN COLLISON: A decent number. SAM ALTMAN: Not that much. Thatâs great. SAM ALTMAN: Look, at some level I fundamentally agree with you. This is just, like, just software; right? Other software has deterministic parts, nondeterministic parts. Itâs you know, itâs like fancy autocorrect. So we could take that belief. But I think from some very other way, like, truly, you know, no tricks, no you know, no, like no parlor tricks, like, we fundamentally have figured out how to create systems that can learn, and that is something that I think is difficult to overstate the importance of. And when it moves from fancy autocorrect to something that is much more complex than that, it may not be this, like, super clear, super bright light; it may be a lot of the gray area, but as these systems are capable of doing more and more sophisticated tasks and figuring out more and more autonomously increasingly complex problems, that certainly does shift the way the world works. At a minimum, things just go way faster in the world. Like we have these AIs that are now kind of, like, part of our society. And, you know, that can go a lot of different ways, but it does mean that what any individual is capable of doing and the speed at which the world evolves is going to be very different. JOHN COLLISON: Maybe a good analogy is, you know, I heard one take on, you know, the recent financial turbulence in bank runs. Someone saying that just bank runs are different in the age of Twitter. SAM ALTMAN: Yeah. JOHN COLLISON: When you have much more virality in the -- kind of the information cascades. SAM ALTMAN: Yeah. JOHN COLLISON: Maybe thatâs a good example of, like, there isnât anything inherently dangerous about, you know, a bunch of tweets, but it does cause knock-on effects to reckon with. SAM ALTMAN: In the previous financial crisis that everybody that I think that that was probably calibrated for, it was, like, pre-iPhone and pre-Twitter pretty much. You know, there were iPhones, but not everyone had them and not everyone used everything mobile all the time. And so that was like this example of where people were totally miscalibrated because of two important technological shifts, and both of those I would say will be smaller and less revolutionary than what AI is going to be like. JOHN COLLISON: Yep. So you guys have kind of two tigers by the tail now with GPT4 or the GPTs, the SAM ALTMAN: Yeah. JOHN COLLISON: series of them and ChatGPT as well. And everyone is saying ChatGPT is the fastest growing consumer product in history. Like whatâs the superlative for ChatGPT? SAM ALTMAN: I mean, I donât know exactly what are those things, but I will tell you, as John mentioned, I used to run Y Combinator, and people would, like, ask me for advice. And if you had told me as a startup you were going to, like, release a product that had no viral loop, no sharing features, no social anything, no network effect, like, no, like, you know, nothing, like, no reason that you using it should make anyone else want to sign up for it, also, that you werenât going to, like, have the ability to use it without registering it in the first place, like, I would say, like, you are in bad shape. And I feel now like Iâve given bad advice for a long time. JOHN COLLISON: Well, ChatGPT is viral, just not within the product. SAM ALTMAN: Right. JOHN COLLISON: People post tweet screenshots. People, you know, are SAM ALTMAN: Right. But thatâs, I mean, I would have said in a vacuum that viral loop is, like, too difficult. Like, you know, it worked for Wordle, I guess. JOHN COLLISON: Well, just so you know, donât listen too muchâ SAM ALTMAN: But not for that long. JOHN COLLISON: Donât listen too much to investors. SAM ALTMAN: Clearly. JOHN COLLISON: for product advice. I feel like we knew that -- we knew that already. What is your favorite like, again, we had in the keynote, and weâre very excited about just natural language queries. Like SQL has always been in the interface. SAM ALTMAN: Yeah. JOHN COLLISON: And so human language is a much nicer interface. Weâve been using it a lot inside Stripe for query optimization that works really well. What are your favorite GPT use cases? Because you must have the best catalog of anyone. SAM ALTMAN: You touched on this. But before I talk about specific use cases, my favorite thing of all is we have finally and I think legitimately gotten to a new computer interface. And there has been this arc for a long time of computers getting easier and more natural to use. So youâre all holding up iPhones recording this. Those are, like, way easier than a computer. You get to, like, you know, just use your hands instead of having to use a mouse. Itâs, like, a little bit more direct. But language is even more natural and even simpler, and weâre used to conveying very complex concepts to each other via language, and then things just happen and thatâs it. So the fact that we now have this new way to interact with computers and just sort of new idea of software I think is going to go super far, and one of the surprises will be just how many places that turns out to be the right way to do it. JOHN COLLISON: I think kind of maybe a funny restatement of that is: Do you remember in this was during your Y Combinator days, so I presume you saw this a lot. There was this hype cycle in I want to say 2016 or 2017 in Silicon Valley around conversational bots. And people thought conversational bots were the be-all and end-all. And, you know, you would not go on to the 1-800-Flowers.com website. You would instead, like, be interfacing with, like, a flower bot through, like, a natural language interface, and thatâs how you would buy flowers. I just remember thereâs some demo of that at some point. And it always seemed a bit off to me because, like, the bots were so clunky. SAM ALTMAN: So dumb, yeah. JOHN COLLISON: Whereas now we just maybe need to bring back that vision because maybe it was exactly right. SAM ALTMAN: Itâs definitely happening now. Thatâs I think like many other tech hype cycles, it was right in terms of what people wanted; the technology just couldnât deliver it. JOHN COLLISON: Yeah. SAM ALTMAN: And to the degree that technology can deliver it, I still think itâs a way people want to use software. JOHN COLLISON: Yeah. SAM ALTMAN: And weâre seeing that. You asked about, like, favorite use cases. Weâre seeing that from, like, how people want to learn things and these new sort of, like, AI tutors or medical advisors to just how they want to control a computer. And, yeah, so I think that the user desire was right. The technology just wasnât there. JOHN COLLISON: Yeah. One of the ways we conceived this inside of Stripe is anywhere someone is doing just manual work or working withâyou know, on a series of tasks, having a team of research assistants with them, you know, cueing up all of the relevant data and having everything they need at their fingertips, you know, having done any, you know, mise en place, you know, any work that they can do, you know, to get things ready for them is probably just a huge productivity boost. SAM ALTMAN: Yeah. JOHN COLLISON: So thatâs one of the ways weâre looking at it. Okay. Letâs talk a bit about how OpenAI actually works. How do you produce things like well, actually, before I get to that, whatâs next after can you give us the inside scoop? You know, you have GPT4, ChatGPT. SAM ALTMAN: Probably five. I mean maybe. JOHN COLLISON: Okay. Thatâs JOHN COLLISON: But I mean or 4.5 -- SAM ALTMAN: Yeah. JOHN COLLISON: -- judging based on your numbering system. Anything else we should be excited about? Not, obviously, the new products, but just directionally, like, thereâs a group of people here who are SAM ALTMAN: Yeah. JOHN COLLISON: very excited about technology developments, so letâs prime them. SAM ALTMAN: Multimodality is definitely something weâre very excited about, so you want these JOHN COLLISON: Explain that to the non-AI. SAM ALTMAN: Yeah. You want a system that canât only interact with text but can do text and audio and images and video and, you know, who knows what else. Obviously, you want actually, I think one of the areas that people most want is just better reliability. So if you could have the like the best one out of 10,000 responses to every GPT4 query, youâd probably be pretty happy most of the time. Thereâs a lot of intelligence in there. Itâs just not very evenly distributed to the average query. So if we can make that much better, if we can make the system way, way more reliable, thatâs a big deal. And then eventually you want a system that can, like, help do a better job of generating new knowledge, but thatâs going to be a little bit. JOHN COLLISON: The reliability is a good point. So, you know, people in AI I notice you love using this term \"hallucinate.\" And in general people in AI love making up words for stuff. And so, you know, itâs inference rather than how long it takes to run, and itâs hallucinate rather than just making shit up. SAM ALTMAN: Yeah, thatâs a weird term. JOHN COLLISON: Sometimes I know, it sounds like, you know anyway, but this is one of the main problems and certainly, you know, in, say, our use cases, like, we do need the things to be true. SAM ALTMAN: Yeah. JOHN COLLISON: And, you know, thereâs been historically an area of mixed performance, sort of the Willâs mustache of GPT performance. And so it seems like weâre on a path to fixing that? SAM ALTMAN: Weâre on a path to improving it a lot. We have been improving it every week, but one of the things that I think is just, like, deeply true about how people use this is humans are fairly forgiving somewhat forgiving of other humans making mistakes, extremely little forgiveness for computers making mistakes. And so the threshold for what it means to solve this is not what it would take to have your human colleague solve it; itâs much, much higher. And so that it is going to take a while, and I think itâll be a very high bar. JOHN COLLISON: GPT already makes up far less stuff than your average dinner party guest? SAM ALTMAN: For sure. But weâve got to go much further. JOHN COLLISON: And you said itâs improving week over week. Iâm actually curious, how do you guys operationally track model performance inside of OpenAI? Like what will what is the SAM ALTMAN: Yeah. We have a suite of evals. And every time we, you know, do a different fine tune or make a new model, weâre looking at it constantly and saying howâs it doing on this whole stack of stuff. JOHN COLLISON: But is it kind of like the CPI basket, where you have to constantly keep changing whatâs in the eval? SAM ALTMAN: You just keep making them harder. JOHN COLLISON: Yeah. SAM ALTMAN: You, likeâyou know, we got a ways to go on any kind of robustnessâ JOHN COLLISON: Yeah, yeah. SAM ALTMAN: âeval. JOHN COLLISON: And letâs talk about how OpenAI works. And, again, Iâm sure thereâs lots of people here who are super curious. Like you guys have, for example, the research versus product I think split or maybe SAM ALTMAN: Yeah. JOHN COLLISON: you know, thatâs probably interesting for people to hear about and just in general your philosophies as you run OpenAI. SAM ALTMAN: Well, the first thing Iâd say is how it works changes, like, every year or even less than that. Weâre still in such a steep part of the technology discovery curve that, you know, everyone you make these, like, great plans. Whatâs that quote, like, everyoneâs got a plan until they get punched in the face or something like that? JOHN COLLISON: Yeah, Mike Tyson. SAM ALTMAN: Yeah. JOHN COLLISON: Yeah. SAM ALTMAN: And then you get, like, punched in the face and you realize the org structure has got to change or what you thought you were going to do or the product you wanted to make is not possible or thereâs something much better or, like, you know, who knows what. So our thing that we try to have is like our add variant is that we are a very truth-seeking research culture. We want to get the things to work. We donât care if our ideas are the ones that turn out not to be right. And one of the things that I think really held the field back is that a lot of the kind of research heavyweights in the field for a long time, the whole culture of, like, academic AI research, I think it wanted certain approaches to work more than it wanted the technology to work. And so we have this weâll do whatever it takes. We will, like, follow the truth wherever it leads. If the answer is we just have to, like, go scale up these, like, ridiculously big systems, rather which is way less intellectually satisfying than discovering this new brilliant algorithm, but if that former is the one that works, thatâs what weâre going to do. And that was really a culture that we built from the beginning, but it means that, like, things are difficult to predict. JOHN COLLISON: Is it accurate to say thereâs kind of a cyclicality to AI in discovering new techniques and then throwing a whole pile of compute at it and then kind of going back and discovering new techniques and then throwing the whole pile of compute, and maybe part of your success is, as you say, not being precious about just throwing a whole pile of compute at it? SAM ALTMAN: That idea you could sort of say thereâs a cyclicality to that, but that whole idea of, like, throw a lot of compute didnât really exist at all until a few years ago. JOHN COLLISON: Really? SAM ALTMAN: Yeah. This is not like an old idea. JOHN COLLISON: Hmm. SAM ALTMAN: Or it was sort of maybe known in some abstract sense, but people other than us werenât really just saying, like, letâs just make that language model bigger. Letâs do the hard engineering. JOHN COLLISON: Because it kind of seems inelegant to an engineer. SAM ALTMAN: It does. JOHN COLLISON: that weâre just going to brute force this. SAM ALTMAN: It does. JOHN COLLISON: Yeah. SAM ALTMAN: So I donât like and, you know, the next thing we doâlike big computers are going to be important for sureâ JOHN COLLISON: Yeah. SAM ALTMAN: âbut I think weâve now squeezed a lot of the easy juice there. JOHN COLLISON: Yeah. SAM ALTMAN: And so now itâs back to, like, letâs figure out these very new ideas. JOHN COLLISON: Youâre like a lock-picking expert who uses a crowbar. SAM ALTMAN: But we have this new tool. We have, like, the GPT system that can help us with all sorts of things. JOHN COLLISON: Yeah. How do you create a truth-seeking research culture? SAM ALTMAN: I think itâs basically all about the people. Like with any company, it is all about the people and particularly the initial people you hire, and we tried to just be very diligent about who those people were and who they werenât. JOHN COLLISON: Mhmm. SAM ALTMAN: So thereâs, like, a lot of people who were just, like, quite prestigious people that we tried hard to hire or did hire in some cases in the early days that didnât fit how we thought things were going to go. JOHN COLLISON: And it sounds like it is quite important to you that people are not they donât have a particular team that they support in terms of techniques. You just have to be open-minded. SAM ALTMAN: Yeah. We have a very high internal flux of movement between teams and new teams starting and stopping and people changing to go work on something else, and I think thatâs I think that is really important to how we work and also different than I think how a lot of -- how a lot of other people work. JOHN COLLISON: How do you know if research is worth funding? Because, again, you know, on a product you can kind of see if anyone is using it or not. You get a lot of real-time feedback. One of the defining aspects of research is maybe youâre working away for five years and it looks like itâs a dead end and then suddenly it takes off. SAM ALTMAN: Yeah. I think you just nothing deep beyond that. You just have to accept the much longer time horizon, and you need oh, this is another thing about kind of the culture of how you get to this. You need people who are not that dependent on external validation. Everybody is like a little bit, and I think it does no good to pretend otherwise, but you want people who are, like, relatively not. And if you know, if weâre going thatâs some approach that we think is working but a lot of experts in the field say, like, thatâs really not going to work JOHN COLLISON: Mhmm. SAM ALTMAN: they actually say much meaner versions of it than that, you need people who will keep doing that in the same way that if you donât get the normal dopamine hits of more frequent contact with reality while youâre trying to research an idea you believe in but isnât yet proven, you need you need people who are, like, going to be okay through that many-year journey through the wilderness. JOHN COLLISON: Hmm. And it sounds like you tried to create a lot of connectedness with the organization, where itâs not, you know, I join a team, and then I work on that team for five years. People will get bounced around somewhat deliberately. SAM ALTMAN: Yeah. JOHN COLLISON: And this is your third startup if you count kind of YC as a startup? SAM ALTMAN: Yeah. JOHN COLLISON: And how do you lead OpenAI differently or do you try to run things differently from your previous companies? SAM ALTMAN: Running a research group is very different than anything else and certainly like like an investment firm is different again. My sense is you can learn some of the standard things, like, you know, how to deal with people. That transfers pretty well. But I think in general people try to apply way too many lessons from stuff theyâve previously done to what theyâre doing now, and I think you really want to take you really want to try to come in with a fresh pair of eyes and meet the shape of whatever is in front of you. And so I think, like, OpenAI, we didnât it, like, went against basically all of the YC advice. You know, we took us four and a half years to launch a product. Weâre going to be the most capital-intensive startup in Silicon Valley history. We kind of didnât we were, like, building a technology without any idea of who our customer was going to be or what they were going to use it for. JOHN COLLISON: Jokes aside, did you have investors wagging their fingers at you and, you know, telling you that youâre doing it wrong in some way? SAM ALTMAN: Yeah. And I was just sort of, like, I donât really care. Donât invest. You know, you can, like, sell your stock to somebody else. JOHN COLLISON: That sounds different from previous startups, where, you know, maybe youâre more self-actualized. SAM ALTMAN: Yeah. JOHN COLLISON: Maybe you donât have to care so much. SAM ALTMAN: Yeah. But we did. JOHN COLLISON: But it sounds like you did a deep learning. SAM ALTMAN: We did change things like that. JOHN COLLISON: Yeah. Now, OpenAI, again, currently, you know, ChatGPT is on everyoneâs lips. The products are working incredibly well. GPT4 is delivering a huge amount of real value to people. I presume it did not feel that way all along the journey. Maybe do you have any fun war stories or just SAM ALTMAN: Yeah. JOHN COLLISON: what was it like? SAM ALTMAN: I do. But I will say, like, no one is as honest about how bad the bad early days are as they should be because itâs so embarrassing in retrospect, but -- SAM ALTMAN: Nervous laughter out there. But the beginning of OpenAI was really tough, like, stuff was not working that well. We were this, like, extremely rag-tag group of people. We were, as I mentioned earlier, like, mocked by everyone serious in the field. There was this like kind of, like, pretty famous guy that runs a lab another AI lab that is not doing as well as OpenAI anymore that would, like, go around to the media when they would write something nice about OpenAI and tell them, like, you know, I donât know why youâre saying stuff. This is just not a good group of people. JOHN COLLISON: You had a kerfuffle with Elon Musk? SAM ALTMAN: We had a kerfuffle with Elon Musk. But more than that, like, we just didnât have working technical progress. Like we had, like, some little things. You know, we did some projects that kind of worked. We even, like, did Doda, which was great, and it was what let us raise the money from Microsoft that let us do the GPT series, but it was, like, it was not it was deeply unclear how we were going to make AGI, and we were, like, unbelievably outgunned by DeepMind at the time; and a lot of people were, like, why are you even doing this, like, DeepMind is untouchable. No one had figured out the idea of language models. Certainly no one had figured out the idea of putting in API around one or releasing ChatGPT. So, yeah, it was, like it was pretty bad. It was pretty hard. And we just, like, kept on the one foot in front of another, but we were, like, constantly not able to find enough money or compute or people, and you just keep going, and eventually something works. JOHN COLLISON: When you say you just keep going, so if I think back to the because, again, I think every company that, you know, gets to some scale definitely goes through the period, you know, the dark times. And if I think back to Stripeâs dark times, like, you know, thereâs a point early on where, like, just after launch and, you know, the endorphins have worn off, and we had, like, a bunch of early people leave all at once at one point, and, you know, itâs very draining, and, you know, you lose some of your own confidence, and you think about what keeps you going. And, one, you know, it helps if you have an idea that youâre really excited about, but at least in our case, also, thereâs a momentum from serving customers. SAM ALTMAN: Yeah. JOHN COLLISON: Where, I donât know, itâs, like, just, well, we got to stay going because, you know, we have all these requests coming into the API and we have all these customers to serve. SAM ALTMAN: Yeah. JOHN COLLISON: So we kind of donât have a choice. It sounds, like, you know, you guys were doing more foundational research. You did not have that customer momentum to keep you going, and so were you not tempted to just pack it all up and quit? SAM ALTMAN: You know, there were all of these so I think Silicon Valley used to be really good at research labs and then it wasnât, and so we didnât have like like thereâs good canonical advice now about what to do as a sort of product startup, and itâs totally true. And this is one of the reasons YC pushes for it so much. Once you have customers that you have to serve and, like, you really feel that and they pull it out of you, but one of the things that we had to sort of, like, rediscover about how to run a research lab was how you keep that internal momentum going when you donât have customers or you donât have, like, contact with reality to know if youâre doing the right thing, and it is really hard. A good set of colleagues matters. We would try to, like, figure out how to set up, like, enough external touch points that kind of like for our own, like, mine included, like, sanity would, like, fake the equivalent of having customer feedback, but there were, like, a lot of things we had to rediscover how to do this. JOHN COLLISON: Hmm. You know, you described the intense competition and, you know, some of the other folks in this space like DeepMind. One thing I just observed with your saying this is the AI space feels very competitive in spirit, where, like, people really want to, you know, outpace the competition and, like, thereâs a lot of competitive juices flowing, you know, like, in a, you know, a sports game or something like that, and, I donât know, it sort of reminds you of the early days of computing where like SAM ALTMAN: Yeah. JOHN COLLISON: you know, Microsoft versus Apple, like, I mean, that was a real competitive battle; whereas, I donât know, you know, thereâs other folks in our space, and theyâre all grand, and, you know -- yeah, just itâs a bit more chill somehow. And so is there something about these superfast moving SAM ALTMAN: Actually, I think thereâs a way in which the AI field is very competitive, as you said, but I think thereâs this other way in which itâs the least competitive, because I think everyone working on it on this sort of frontier realizes whatâs at stake, and we really want it to go well. And so although, you know, people want to, like, be faster and thereâs this, like, island, like, there is I think a really deep appreciation for the need to collaborate and get this right, and that is different than any space Iâve seen before. JOHN COLLISON: What form does the collaboration take? SAM ALTMAN: I mean, itâs mostly just, like, the leaders of the labs talking to each other. JOHN COLLISON: Mhmm. SAM ALTMAN: But increasingly I think itâll be about governments doing it. JOHN COLLISON: What will happen with the governments? You know, thereâs a lot of talk now of AI regulation. What should I be SAM ALTMAN: Iâll tell you what I want. I donât know what theyâll do. What I want is some I think that computing systems above a certain threshold, as we make more and more algorithmic progress, are kind of as powerful for all the good and also as dangerous for the bad as, like, any other human technology weâve had yet. And what I would like is something like the IAEA, the International Atomic Energy Group Agency that does it for AI. And so if you were going to create a giant AI training system, and if youâre going to train models that are above a certain capacity, like, there should be global regulatory authority over that that should say, you know, hereâs the test you have to pass before you deploy something. Hereâs, like, the standard for audits. JOHN COLLISON: Well, wait, as we, you know, shut down nuclear plants in Europe and, you know, fire up the new coal plants, and, you know, maybe it feels like weâre running slightly backwards from a climate point of view, is the global nuclear regulatory apparatus really the model we want? SAM ALTMAN: We havenât had a bomb go off in war since 1945, and I think most people in 1945 would have given a very low probability of that happening. Itâs not been perfect. Itâs definitely been screwed up on the power side. Iâm honestly not sure thatâs the IAEAâs fault. Like the NRC in the US has never, as far as I know, approved a plant that has then gone on to be built in the 45 years its existed, which is, like, incredibly shameful. But, yeah, we havenât had a bomb go off. JOHN COLLISON: And you credit at least to some degree SAM ALTMAN: At least some of that. JOHN COLLISON: -- to the IAEA. Sorry, you just reminded me with nuclear, I forgot in Samâs introâso, you know, Sam has done all these very impressive things, and just while doing that, in his spare time, he has also done things like been the primary backer of Helion, which is the leading I think nuclear fusion. SAM ALTMAN: Yeah. JOHN COLLISON: startup. And should we be excited about SAM ALTMAN: You should be excited about that. JOHN COLLISON: having fusion in the future? SAM ALTMAN: I so fusion is going to work. What I think is still unclear JOHN COLLISON: Iâm sorry. Fusion will work? SAM ALTMAN: Fusion will work. JOHN COLLISON: Okay. You heard it here. SAM ALTMAN: But, but JOHN COLLISON: Sorry. I already tweeted it out. Yeah. SAM ALTMAN: The thing that I think matters now is how cheap we can make the energy out of the system and how quickly we can deploy it to the world, and these are both tremendous challenges. Maybe not quite as hard as getting the actual physics to work, but up there. And so whether thereâs like itâs totally possible we get to a world where fusion works, but it is more expensive than solar plus storage. Thatâd be really sad. And itâs totally possible that fusion works and itâs cheap, but we just canât manufacture it at the, like, thousands of gigawatts of generative capacity we need for Earth. And if both things happen, if the cost, like, falls by a factor of 10 or 100, then the demand really goes crazy, and itâs really, really hard to make enough. But I think probably we will figure it out, and probably we will get to a world where in addition to the cost of intelligence falling dramatically, the cost of energy falls dramatically too. And if both of those things happen in the same time -- I would argue that they are currently the two most important inputs to the whole economy -- we get to a super different place. JOHN COLLISON: Yeah. I was going to say, are those two things more coupled than people realize, where electricity SAM ALTMAN: In all these ways JOHN COLLISON: is one of the limiting factors SAM ALTMAN: Yeah. In all these ways they are. Like if you really want to make, like, the biggest, most capable super intelligent system you can, you need eyewatering amounts of energy. And if you have an AI that can help you, like, move faster and do better materials science, you can probably get the fusion a little bit faster too. JOHN COLLISON: Hmm. Is there as you trace back the text tree and look at something like Helion, you know, get all these interesting questions about whatâs dependent on what. You know, could the Romans have had their own Industrial Revolution or something like that, or, you know, were there technologies that were needed. And could we have had what Helion is doing in, say, the â60s? SAM ALTMAN: No. JOHN COLLISON: Okay. SAM ALTMAN: Again, itâs, like, itâs always funny how these things play out, but the whole semiconductor revolution also means that we can do the kind of switches that we need for Helion now. 10 years ago, 15 years ago certainly it just would have been totally impossible. The materials science, the progress that weâve made for many different parts of the machine, the computer modeling stuff that we can get to, like, understand how the plasma is going to work, none of these things would have been possible before. JOHN COLLISON: So itâs the product of decades of materials science SAM ALTMAN: On many different JOHN COLLISON: and computer modeling? SAM ALTMAN: Yeah. Itâs the product of, like, major progress in five different areas being multiplied together. JOHN COLLISON: Mhmm. SAM ALTMAN: That means you can do things that the last time around people made serious fusion efforts were totally impossible. JOHN COLLISON: Okay. Okay. Sorry, I distracted us. Going back to AI regulations, so you think capping compute is just a sensible, pragmatic way to like SAM ALTMAN: I wouldnât cap it. I think that I mean, maybe you should at some points along the way, but, like, long term thatâs clearly not the answer. But I would just say above a certain above increasing thresholds there are increasing regulatory demands. So if youâre going to make a system that is likely to have some very powerful capabilities, you should have a different regulatory regime than if youâre, like, training a model on your laptop. JOHN COLLISON: Do you think weâll sadly just back into regulation through essentially protectionism and kind of, you know, humans protecting human turf, whereâyou know, the lawyers have figured this out, where, you know, various things just require a lawyer. Why? Because we make the rules. Weâre the lawyers. SAM ALTMAN: I donât, you know, I used to worry about that. I still have some worry about that. You can, like, see all these mistakes where people have tried to protect a bunch of jobs that they just thatâs not a winning strategy. I think the tenor of the conversation is quickly shifting towards this AGI thing is just different than anything weâve faced before, and letâs focus on that. JOHN COLLISON: Mhmm. So as we look at again, you have, you know, around 3,000 people in the room working on, you know, in every imaginable industry, and, you know, Iâm sure many of them are working actually on AI startups. You know, if you were putting out a request for AI startups, you know, you guys are, obviously, with OpenAI powering through your API products, a huge number, maybe most all of the AI startups, what do you want to see people develop? Like what would be on your request for a startups list? SAM ALTMAN: We touched on this earlier, but, like, anything thatâs in the direction of how can you design a new interface model, that just seems to keep working, you know, like from this sort of chatbot interface to something that before was more difficult to do to the sort of, like, copilot for every different workflow, this seems to me like an easy area to go after. Whatâs happening in education is amazing. So, like, the AI tutors are surprising me to the upside, and I suspect can go much, much further. But, you know, the most fun part of this is you always underestimate the creative energy of the world when it really gets focused on something. JOHN COLLISON: Yeah. We work with at Stripe an extraordinary number of vertical SaaS companies, where they are, you know, providing software for some very specific vertical, and it goes, like, really niche. I mean, there are, like, very popular, you know, software platforms for managing a Boy Scout troop, because as it turns out, thereâs a lot of Boy Scout troops out there, and I know theyâre all running around. SAM ALTMAN: Yeah. JOHN COLLISON: You know, you need a software platform to manage them. But, anyway, you know, we see this across every kind of single industry, and I was thinking that it will probably be software platforms that are the vehicle through which many of the productivity gains of AI are distributed to kind of the economy more broadly, because most companies are not tech companies, but SaaS is probably how you can deliver a lot of these productivity gains. SAM ALTMAN: I think thatâs probably right, but I would say my own intuitions are uncertain here. Like, you know, maybe where most of the gains come is in another few turns of the crank you can just say, like, hey, AI, please cure all cancer for me, and then it goes âchoo chooâ and gives you the answer, and, like, people get it that way. JOHN COLLISON: Thatâd be fun. Obviously, itâs very exciting. JOHN COLLISON: Itâd be very exciting, actually, when you say education, just like the Bloom 2 sigma effect that tutoring kids SAM ALTMAN: Yeah. JOHN COLLISON: one on one with mastery learning techniques SAM ALTMAN: Yeah. JOHN COLLISON: where you, like, wait until the kid has actually understood it until you go to the next level. The reason they call it the Bloom 2 sigma effect is because it produces two sigmas of outperformance versus the baseline, and that is maybe SAM ALTMAN: Yeah. JOHN COLLISON: the most exciting thing. SAM ALTMAN: I think this is why the AI tutors are surprising so much on the upside, because they can do exactly this so well JOHN COLLISON: Yeah. SAM ALTMAN: one on one. JOHN COLLISON: Thereâs two sigmas. Like thatâs a lot of SAM ALTMAN: Itâs a lot. JOHN COLLISON: sigmas. SAM ALTMAN: It is a lot of sigmas. JOHN COLLISON: The companies here that are not AI companies, any advice for them as they look to adopt AI within their business? So SAM ALTMAN: Yeah. Internal productivity. Weâre seeing a huge divergence between people at companies -- like individual people at companies and companies that embrace versus companies that donât embrace AI tools. Whether your business has anything to do with AI or not, you can certainly, like, figure out how to dramatically impact your, you know, productivity per unit time, and I think itâd be very dangerous not to -- not to learn how to do that. JOHN COLLISON: When you talk about AGI, three years, five years? What are you thinking? SAM ALTMAN: Honestly, the, like, goalposts on that one are moving so much that I think at this point weâre kind of weâd have to get into, like, a very precise talk agreement on what the definitions are, and then I could give you some range. JOHN COLLISON: What is your working definition? SAM ALTMAN: Well, my own one is moving, too, as we get closer. Like a thing that I would say is definitely AGI is a system that can dramatically increase the rate of scientific progress. And I donât think this has to mean, like, we have this one system that is, like, going off and discovering all the science itself. Thatâs actually not what I expect will happen, but that somehow working in collaboration with us and sort of, like, becoming part of society in all these ways, like, our collective rate of scientific progress dramatically changes shape, and I would expect that by the end of the decade. JOHN COLLISON: Yeah. I mean, it feels like if that is your your criterion, we can see that actually quite soon. SAM ALTMAN: Yeah. But, again, itâs, like, not a fully autonomous system. JOHN COLLISON: Yes. SAM ALTMAN: Like do you some people wouldnât count that. JOHN COLLISON: Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Well, thatâs something thatâs kind of the moving definition. Many people probably donât know this. You were, along with Paul Graham, Stripeâs first angel investor. SAM ALTMAN: Yeah. JOHN COLLISON: Why did you invest in Stripe? SAM ALTMAN: I thought and continue to believe in addition to the fact that this is just, like, one of the largest markets that if you can take friction out of economic transactions, which is part of why the Internet is exciting as a whole but only one part, that that would just, like, enable a tremendous amount of growth in the economy and sort of better stuff happening faster, cheaper, better, more accessible, all of that. And that has become even more. Like letâs say Stripe has certainly outperformed anyoneâs expectation, but that fundamental belief I felt then and I feel very strongly now. I also thought you and Patrick were awesome. And thatâs kind of, like, all I look for in a startup, like, big-market idea that I personally want to support great founders, something that would have, like, real long-term defensibility. It was so long ago, I actually wrote a check, a physical check, one of the last times probably in my life. But, you know, when you say it JOHN COLLISON: Kind of ironic for Stripe when you think about it. SAM ALTMAN: Well, I mean, it makes sense, SAM ALTMAN: It makes sense that it would be one of the last ones. JOHN COLLISON: Yeah. We can digitize that. SAM ALTMAN: Like, you know, when people say, like, I wrote a check into this startup, like, I actually wrote a check into Stripe. JOHN COLLISON: Yeah. We have our new RFAs. We can digitize all that for you now. SAM ALTMAN: Great. JOHN COLLISON: But you guys are, obviously, now monetizing ChatGPT with Stripe. Any product feedback for us, sir? SAM ALTMAN: Weâre very happy. And Iâll actually tell you one thing that I that the team is probably tired of hearing about this. Like Stripe does such a good job with customer support, documentation, that whole experience, like, so much better than basically any other startup. And OpenAI, weâre going to get better at this. I apologize to everyone. Itâs clearly the bottom of the pack. But itâs very inspiring, and we appreciate it. JOHN COLLISON: When you say documentation, actually, one thing Iâm quite excited about and, again, this is, like, a very narrow, I donât know, thing to be excited about with GPT4, but I am, is, like, technical documentation. Like, Stripe has produced a lot of quite technical, quite deep documentation, but everyoneâs use case is kind of different, where itâs, like, well, Iâm building a platform in the Netherlands to accept point-of-sale payments with the new S700 reader, which has the longest battery life SAM ALTMAN: Yeah. JOHN COLLISON: of any reader weâve ever shipped, and I just want to, you know, figure out what my implementation plan is. SAM ALTMAN: Yeah. JOHN COLLISON: That is the kind of thing GPT4 is excellent for. SAM ALTMAN: Yeah. This seems like clearly the future. JOHN COLLISON: Yeah. SAM ALTMAN: Where youâll just go to GPT4 or some system like it and ask it any question you have, and itâll give you a perfect custom answer. JOHN COLLISON: Actually, it may be a narrow product question. Will you, like, go to the Stripe integration builder, and the integration builder will come up with a thing for you, or is everyone kind of overthinking it, and actually youâll just go to GPT4 and say, hey, GPT4, how should I build my Stripe integration? SAM ALTMAN: Weâre still trying to figure out the answer to that question. You know, do people want to use one centralized chatbot for their entire workflow, or do they want the chat interface everywhere? So weâre like you know, weâre trying versions where it all comes together with plugins. Weâre trying versions where we make it easy to embed chatlike experiences elsewhere. And I think the world hasnât figured this out yet. JOHN COLLISON: Yeah. And you guys you should pitch your API product. Because, again, one of the things that people are worried about is, like, the data usage and, like, you know, you want to be able to use data, but you donât necessarily want to go back into feeding, you know, the models and everything like that, but you guys have solved all that with your, you know, API product. SAM ALTMAN: Yeah. JOHN COLLISON: Just people may not know that. SAM ALTMAN: So weâre trying to, like, clear this misconception up. We donât ever train on any data submitted to the API. So you can, like, use it comfortably as a business. That will never get into our training set. And, you know, thatâs, like, really important to us, because we realize how sensitive the data is. We donât retain it long term. We donât train on it. Itâs, like, your data. We totally get that. We have plenty of other ways to improve our models. We will continue to drive prices down a lot over time. We will continue to make the models better. Like we have this vision that we can make our APIs pretty simple to use, and then as and pretty, like, long-term stable, and then as we make the models smarter and smarter, it just sort of, like, lifts up the whole Internet, the whole technology industry, with more intelligence. So that is our, like, we want to always, like, astonish people on how much intelligence they get for how little money. And I think we can keep doing that for a long time. JOHN COLLISON: When you talk about data, I think that one thing that maybe surprises people is how small the models are. Like I donât know if you have really too many thoughts on just how small the various models are. Will we see a lot of on device or, you know, on prem or, like, on my individual device inference? SAM ALTMAN: It will be a long time until you can have, like, a GPT4 class model running on your iPhone, but, you know, technology marches on, and some day. JOHN COLLISON: Yeah. So maybe for specialized use cases SAM ALTMAN: Yes. JOHN COLLISON: but probably not kind of for broad use cases. Okay. And last question, because we are running up against time. But, again, you talk to a lot of startups. You advise a lot of startups. You have companies big and small, not just startups, but including some startups in the room. As you stare down 2023, I mean, weâve spent a lot of time talking about AI in particular, but, also, as you look at the macroeconomy, as you look at the hiring market, as you look at, you know, the return to office, you know, we were talking about backstage, everything like that, just what are you advising your startups on these days? What mistakes do you see people making that you try to correct? What advice would you leave everyone with? SAM ALTMAN: I mean, look, I think definitely one of the tech industries worst takes in a long time was that everybody could go full remote forever and startups didnât need to be together in person. And, you know, there was going to be no loss of creativity. I would say that the experiment on that is over, and the technology is not yet good enough that people can be full remote forever, particularly not startups. I feel pretty strongly that startups need a lot of in-person time, and the more fragile and nuanced and uncertain a set of ideas are, the more time you need together in person. Like that is the thing that we still have not translated on to, like, Slack and Zoom and whatever else. And I was talking to a lot of recent startups who have been who were all remote the whole time and decided not to come back versus the ones that either started in person or came back together in person, and theyâre different. Like thereâs a huge separation there. So I think thatâs one big thing. The sort of macroeconomy, I donât really know. JOHN COLLISON: Youâve always had good predictions on the macro. SAM ALTMAN: I only think about AI now. I used to have, like, all these interests. SAM ALTMAN: You know, I used to, like, have a lot of ideas, and now I only have one. I mean, presumably the economy recovers at some point. JOHN COLLISON: Thatâs actually as specific as many serious macro-prognosticatorsâor as specific as many macro-prognosticators, I guess, but youâre just much more concise. They use many more words to express roughly the same sentiment. SAM ALTMAN: Right. Yeah. JOHN COLLISON: Okay. So get back to the office, and presumably the economy recovers at some point. AUDIENCE: I have a question. JOHN COLLISON: Well, weâre not taking live questions, but apparently we are with this person. So weâll take one live question, then weâll close. JOHN COLLISON: This is a new way. SAM ALTMAN: Sure. AUDIENCE: So there was a research paper about the emergent abilities to be more original in how we measure progress than the inherent property of language models itself. SAM ALTMAN: The question was: There was a paper about emergent properties being more something of how we measure progress than an inherent property of language models itself. I didnât see the paper. I totally disagree. But I think itâs, like, a question of how you define emergent properties. The number of experts that sort of try to weigh in about why this is just statistical prediction, thereâs no intelligence, thereâs, you know, nothing useful here versus, like, the experience of people who use these models, Iâd say the experts are clearly in the wrong in some important sense, and you can safely just, like, ignore all of their Twitter hyperventilation. JOHN COLLISON: Not speaking about anyone in particular? SAM ALTMAN: So many people in particular. SAM ALTMAN: But in the same way, like, you know, you can say, well, this really isnât emergent behavior; itâs a measurement error. If itâs doing something new and useful, that is emergent behavior in a sense that I think like utility is the figure of merit here, but more than that, I think now that we can just, like, see a year or two into the future, there is definitely going to be behavior that I would say just categorically doesnât exist right now that is going to come in a way that I would call and I think most normal people would call emergent, and what matters is the utility it eventually provides us. JOHN COLLISON: Okay. Sam, thank you so much. SAM ALTMAN: Thank you. SAM ALTMAN: Thanks for having me.",

                "title": "Abraham Lincoln - Wikipedia",
                "content": "Abraham Lincoln (/ËlÉªÅkÉn/ LINK-Én; February 12, 1809 â April 15, 1865) was the 16th president of the United States, serving from 1861 until his assassination in 1865. He led the United States through the American Civil War, defending the nation as a constitutional union, defeating the Confederacy, playing a major role in the abolition of slavery, expanding the power of the federal government, and modernizing the U.S. economy. Lincoln was born into poverty in a log cabin in LaRue County, Kentucky and was raised on the frontier, mainly in Indiana. He was self-educated and became a lawyer, Whig Party leader, Illinois state legislator, and U.S. representative from Illinois. In 1849, he returned to his successful law practice in Springfield, Illinois. In 1854, angered by the KansasâNebraska Act, which opened the territories to slavery, he re-entered politics. He soon became a leader of the new Republican Party. He reached a national audience in the 1858 Senate campaign debates against Stephen A. Douglas. Lincoln ran for president in 1860, sweeping the North to gain victory. Pro-slavery elements in the South viewed his election as a threat to slavery, and Southern states began seceding from the nation. They formed the Confederate States of America, which began seizing federal military bases in the South. A little over one month after Lincoln assumed the presidency, Confederate forces attacked Fort Sumter, a U.S. fort in South Carolina. Following the bombardment, Lincoln mobilized forces to suppress the rebellion and restore the union. Lincoln, a moderate Republican, had to navigate a contentious array of factions with friends and opponents from both the Democratic and Republican parties. His allies, the War Democrats and the Radical Republicans, demanded harsh treatment of the Southern Confederates. He managed the factions by exploiting their mutual enmity, carefully distributing political patronage, and by appealing to the American people. Anti-war Democrats (called \"Copperheads\") despised Lincoln, and some irreconcilable pro-Confederate elements went so far as to plot his assassination. His Gettysburg Address became one of the most famous speeches in American history. Lincoln closely supervised the strategy and tactics in the war effort, including the selection of generals, and implemented a naval blockade of the South's trade. He suspended habeas corpus in Maryland and elsewhere, and he averted war with Britain by defusing the Trent Affair. In 1863, he issued the Emancipation Proclamation, which declared the slaves in the states \"in rebellion\" to be free. It also directed the Army and Navy to \"recognize and maintain the freedom of said persons\" and to receive them \"into the armed service of the United States.\" Lincoln pressured border states to outlaw slavery, and he promoted the Thirteenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, which abolished slavery, except as punishment for a crime. Lincoln managed his own successful re-election campaign. He sought to heal the war-torn nation through reconciliation. On April 14, 1865, just five days after the Confederate surrender at Appomattox, he was attending a play at Ford's Theatre in Washington, D.C., with his wife, Mary, when he was fatally shot by Confederate sympathizer John Wilkes Booth. Lincoln is remembered as a martyr and a national hero for his wartime leadership and for his efforts to preserve the Union and abolish slavery. He is often ranked in both popular and scholarly polls as the greatest president in American history. Lincoln was born on February 12, 1809, the second child of Thomas Lincoln and Nancy Hanks Lincoln, in a log cabin on Sinking Spring Farm near Hodgenville, Kentucky.[3] He was a descendant of Samuel Lincoln, an Englishman who migrated from Hingham, Norfolk, to its namesake, Hingham, Massachusetts, in 1638. The family through subsequent generations migrated west, passing through New Jersey, Pennsylvania, and Virginia.[4] Lincoln was also a descendant of the Harrison family of Virginia; his paternal grandfather and namesake, Captain Abraham Lincoln and wife Bathsheba (nÃ©e Herring) moved the family from Virginia to Jefferson County, Kentucky.[b] The captain was killed in an Indian raid in 1786.[6] His children, including eight-year-old Thomas, Abraham's father, witnessed the attack.[7][c] Thomas then worked at odd jobs in Kentucky and Tennessee before the family settled in Hardin County, Kentucky, in the early 1800s.[7] Lincoln's mother Nancy Lincoln is widely assumed to be the daughter of Lucy Hanks.[9] Thomas and Nancy married on June 12, 1806, in Washington County, and moved to Elizabethtown, Kentucky.[10] They had three children: Sarah, Abraham, and Thomas, who died as an infant.[11] Thomas Lincoln bought multiple farms in Kentucky, but could not get clear property titles to any, losing hundreds of acres of land in property disputes.[12] In 1816, the family moved to Indiana, where the land surveys and titles were more reliable.[13] They settled in an \"unbroken forest\"[14] in Hurricane Township, Perry County, Indiana.[15] When the Lincolns moved to Indiana it had just been admitted to the Union as a \"free\" (non-slaveholding) state,[16] except that, though \"no new enslaved people were allowed, ... currently enslaved individuals remained so\".[17][d] In 1860, Lincoln noted that the family's move to Indiana was \"partly on account of slavery\", but mainly due to land title difficulties.[19][20] In Kentucky and Indiana, Thomas worked as a farmer, cabinetmaker, and carpenter.[21] At various times he owned farms, livestock, and town lots, paid taxes, sat on juries, appraised estates, and served on county patrols. Thomas and Nancy were members of a Separate Baptist Church, which \"condemned profanity, intoxication, gossip, horse racing, and dancing.\" Most of its members opposed slavery.[22] Overcoming financial challenges, Thomas in 1827 obtained clear title to 80 acres (32 ha) in Indiana, an area that became known as Little Pigeon Creek Community.[23] On October 5, 1818, Nancy Lincoln died from milk sickness, leaving 11-year-old Sarah in charge of a household including her father, nine-year-old Abraham, and Nancy's 19-year-old orphan cousin, Dennis Hanks.[24] Ten years later, on January 20, 1828, Sarah died while giving birth to a stillborn son, devastating Lincoln.[25] On December 2, 1819, Thomas married Sarah Bush Johnston, a widow from Elizabethtown, Kentucky, with three children of her own.[26] Abraham became close to his stepmother and called her \"Mother\".[27] Dennis Hanks said he was lazy, for all his \"readingâscribblingâwritingâcipheringâwriting poetry\".[28] His stepmother acknowledged he did not enjoy \"physical labor\" but loved to read.[29][30] Lincoln was largely self-educated.[31] His formal schooling was from itinerant teachers. It included two short stints in Kentucky, where he learned to read, but probably not to write. In Indiana at age seven,[32] due to farm chores, he attended school only sporadically, for a total of fewer than 12 months in aggregate by age 15.[33] Nonetheless, he remained an avid reader and retained a lifelong interest in learning.[34] Family, neighbors, and schoolmates recalled that his readings included the King James Bible, Aesop's Fables, John Bunyan's The Pilgrim's Progress, Daniel Defoe's Robinson Crusoe, and The Autobiography of Benjamin Franklin.[35] Despite being self-educated, Lincoln was the recipient of honorary degrees later in life, including an honorary Doctor of Laws from Columbia University in June 1861.[36] When Lincoln was a teen, his \"father grew more and more to depend on him for the 'farming, grubbing, hoeing, making fences' necessary to keep the family afloat. He also regularly hired his son out to work ... and by law, he was entitled to everything the boy earned until he came of age\".[37] Lincoln was tall, strong, and athletic, and became adept at using an ax.[38] He was an active wrestler during his youth and trained in the rough catch-as-catch-can style (also known as catch wrestling). He became county wrestling champion at the age of 21.[39] He gained a reputation for his strength and audacity after winning a wrestling match with the renowned leader of ruffians known as the Clary's Grove boys.[40] In March 1830, fearing another milk sickness outbreak, several members of the extended Lincoln family, including Abraham, moved west to Illinois, a free state, and settled in Macon County.[41][e] Abraham then became increasingly distant from Thomas, in part, due to his father's lack of interest in education.[43] In 1831, as Thomas and other family members prepared to move to a new homestead in Coles County, Illinois, Abraham struck out on his own.[44] He made his home in New Salem, Illinois, for six years.[45] Lincoln and some friends took goods, including live hogs, by flatboat to New Orleans, Louisiana, where he first witnessed slavery.[46] Speculation persists that Lincoln's first romantic interest was Ann Rutledge, whom he met when he moved to New Salem. However, witness testimony, given decades afterward, showed a lack of any specific recollection of a romance between the two.[47] Rutledge died on August 25, 1835, most likely of typhoid fever; Lincoln took the death very hard, saying that he could not bear the idea of rain falling on Ann's grave. Lincoln sank into a serious episode of depression, and this gave rise to speculation that he had been in love with her.[48][49][50] In the early 1830s, he met Mary Owens from Kentucky.[51] Late in 1836, Lincoln agreed to a match with Owens if she returned to New Salem. Owens arrived that November and he courted her; however, they both had second thoughts. On August 16, 1837, he wrote Owens a letter saying he would not blame her if she ended the relationship, and she never replied.[52] In 1839, Lincoln met Mary Todd in Springfield, Illinois, and the following year they became engaged.[53] She was the daughter of Robert Smith Todd, a wealthy lawyer and businessman in Lexington, Kentucky.[54] Their wedding, which was set for January 1, 1841, was canceled because Lincoln did not appear, but they reconciled and married on November 4, 1842, in the Springfield home of Mary's sister.[55] While anxiously preparing for the nuptials, he was asked where he was going and replied, \"To hell, I suppose\".[56] In 1844, the couple bought a house in Springfield near his law office. Mary kept house with the help of a hired servant and a relative.[57] Lincoln was an affectionate husband and father of four sons, though his work regularly kept him away from home. The eldest, Robert Todd Lincoln, was born in 1843, and was the only child to live to maturity. Edward Baker Lincoln (Eddie), born in 1846, died February 1, 1850, probably of tuberculosis. Lincoln's third son, \"Willie\" Lincoln, was born on December 21, 1850, and died of a fever at the White House on February 20, 1862. The youngest, Thomas \"Tad\" Lincoln, was born on April 4, 1853, and survived his father, but died of heart failure at age 18 on July 16, 1871.[58][f] Lincoln \"was remarkably fond of children\"[60] and the Lincolns were not considered to be strict with their own.[61] In fact, Lincoln's law partner William H. Herndon would grow irritated when Lincoln brought his children to the law office. Their father, it seemed, was often too absorbed in his work to notice his children's behavior. Herndon recounted, \"I have felt many and many a time that I wanted to wring their little necks, and yet out of respect for Lincoln I kept my mouth shut. Lincoln did not note what his children were doing or had done.\"[62] The deaths of their sons Eddie and Willie had profound effects on both parents. Lincoln suffered from \"melancholy\", a condition now thought to be clinical depression.[49] Later in life, Mary struggled with the stresses of losing her husband and sons, and in 1875 Robert committed her to an asylum.[63] During 1831 and 1832, Lincoln worked at a general store in New Salem, Illinois. In 1832, he declared his candidacy for the Illinois House of Representatives, but interrupted his campaign to serve as a captain in the Illinois Militia during the Black Hawk War.[64] When Lincoln returned home from the Black Hawk War, he planned to become a blacksmith, but instead formed a partnership with 21-year-old William Berry, with whom he purchased a New Salem general store on credit. Because a license was required to sell customers beverages, Berry obtained bartending licenses for $7 each for Lincoln and himself, and in 1833 the Lincoln-Berry General Store became a tavern as well.[citation needed] As licensed bartenders, Lincoln and Berry were able to sell spirits, including liquor, for 12 cents a pint. They offered a wide range of alcoholic beverages as well as food, including takeout dinners. But Berry became an alcoholic, was often too drunk to work, and Lincoln ended up running the store by himself.[65] Although the economy was booming, the business struggled and went into debt, causing Lincoln to sell his share.[citation needed] In his first campaign speech after returning from his military service, Lincoln observed a supporter in the crowd under attack, grabbed the assailant by his \"neck and the seat of his trousers\", and tossed him.[41] In the campaign, Lincoln advocated for navigational improvements on the Sangamon River. He could draw crowds as a raconteur, but lacked the requisite formal education, powerful friends, and money, and lost the election.[66] Lincoln finished eighth out of 13 candidates (the top four were elected), though he received 277 of the 300 votes cast in the New Salem precinct.[67] Lincoln served as New Salem's postmaster and later as county surveyor, but continued his voracious reading and decided to become a lawyer.[68] Rather than studying in the office of an established attorney, as was the custom, Lincoln borrowed legal texts from attorneys John Todd Stuart and Thomas Drummond, purchased books including Blackstone's Commentaries and Chitty's Pleadings, and read law on his own.[68] He later said of his legal education that \"I studied with nobody.\"[69] Lincoln's second state house campaign in 1834, this time as a Whig, was a success over a powerful Whig opponent.[70] Then followed his four terms in the Illinois House of Representatives for Sangamon County.[71] He championed construction of the Illinois and Michigan Canal, and later was a Canal Commissioner.[72] He voted to expand suffrage beyond white landowners to all white males, but adopted a \"free soil\" stance opposing both slavery and abolition.[73] In 1837, he declared, \"[The] Institution of slavery is founded on both injustice and bad policy, but the promulgation of abolition doctrines tends rather to increase than abate its evils.\"[74] He echoed Henry Clay's support for the American Colonization Society which advocated a program of abolition in conjunction with settling freed slaves in Liberia.[75] He was admitted to the Illinois bar on September 9, 1836,[76][77] and moved to Springfield and began to practice law under John T. Stuart, Mary Todd's cousin.[78] Lincoln emerged as a formidable trial combatant during cross-examinations and closing arguments. He partnered several years with Stephen T. Logan, and in 1844, began his practice with William Herndon, \"a studious young man\".[79] On January 27, 1838, Abraham Lincoln, then 28 years old, delivered his first major speech at the Lyceum in Springfield, Illinois, after the murder of newspaper editor Elijah Parish Lovejoy in Alton. Lincoln warned that no trans-Atlantic military giant could ever crush the U.S. as a nation. \"It cannot come from abroad. If destruction be our lot, we must ourselves be its author and finisher\", said Lincoln.[80][81] Prior to that, on April 28, 1836, a black man, Francis McIntosh, was burned alive in St. Louis, Missouri. Zann Gill describes how these two murders set off a chain reaction that ultimately prompted Abraham Lincoln to run for President.[82] True to his record, Lincoln professed to friends in 1861 to be \"an old line Whig, a disciple of Henry Clay\".[83] Their party favored economic modernization in banking, tariffs to fund internal improvements including railroads, and urbanization.[84] In 1843, Lincoln sought the Whig nomination for Illinois's 7th district seat in the U.S. House of Representatives; he was defeated by John J. Hardin, though he prevailed with the party in limiting Hardin to one term. Lincoln not only pulled off his strategy of gaining the nomination in 1846, but also won the election. He was the only Whig in the Illinois delegation, but as dutiful as any participated in almost all votes and made speeches that toed the party line.[85] He was assigned to the Committee on Post Office and Post Roads and the Committee on Expenditures in the War Department.[86] Lincoln teamed with Joshua R. Giddings on a bill to abolish slavery in the District of Columbia with compensation for the owners, enforcement to capture fugitive slaves, and a popular vote on the matter. He dropped the bill when it eluded Whig support.[87][88] On foreign and military policy, Lincoln spoke against the MexicanâAmerican War, which he imputed President James K. Polk's desire for \"military glory â that attractive rainbow, that rises in showers of blood\".[89] He supported the Wilmot Proviso, a failed proposal to ban slavery in any U.S. territory won from Mexico.[90] Lincoln emphasized his opposition to Polk by drafting and introducing his Spot Resolutions. The war had begun with a killing of American soldiers by Mexican cavalry patrol in disputed territory, and Polk insisted that Mexican soldiers had \"invaded our territory and shed the blood of our fellow-citizens on our own soil\".[91] Lincoln demanded that Polk show Congress the exact spot on which blood had been shed and prove that the spot was on American soil.[92] The resolution was ignored in both Congress and the national papers, and it cost Lincoln political support in his district. One Illinois newspaper derisively nicknamed him \"spotty Lincoln\".[93] Lincoln later regretted some of his statements, especially his attack on presidential war-making powers.[94] Lincoln had pledged in 1846 to serve only one term in the House. Realizing Clay was unlikely to win the presidency, he supported General Zachary Taylor for the Whig nomination in the 1848 presidential election.[95] Taylor won and Lincoln hoped in vain to be appointed Commissioner of the United States General Land Office.[96] The administration offered to appoint him secretary or governor of the Oregon Territory as consolation.[97] This distant territory was a Democratic stronghold, and acceptance of the post would have disrupted his legal and political career in Illinois, so he declined and resumed his law practice.[98] In his Springfield practice, Lincoln handled \"every kind of business that could come before a prairie lawyer\".[99] Twice a year he appeared for 10 consecutive weeks in county seats in the Midstate county courts; this continued for 16 years.[100] Lincoln handled transportation cases in the midst of the nation's western expansion, particularly river barge conflicts under the many new railroad bridges. As a riverboat man, Lincoln initially favored those interests, but ultimately represented whoever hired him.[101] He later represented a bridge company against a riverboat company in Hurd v. Rock Island Bridge Company, a landmark case involving a canal boat that sank after hitting a bridge.[102] In 1849 he received a patent for a flotation device for the movement of boats in shallow water. The idea was never commercialized, but it made Lincoln the only president to hold a patent.[103] Lincoln appeared before the Illinois Supreme Court in 175 cases; he was sole counsel in 51 cases, of which 31 were decided in his favor.[104] From 1853 to 1860, one of his largest clients was the Illinois Central Railroad.[105] His legal reputation gave rise to the nickname \"Honest Abe\".[106] In an 1858 criminal trial, Lincoln represented William \"Duff\" Armstrong, who was on trial for the murder of James Preston Metzker.[107] The case is famous for Lincoln's use of a fact established by judicial notice to challenge the credibility of an eyewitness. After an opposing witness testified to seeing the crime in the moonlight, Lincoln produced a Farmers' Almanac showing the Moon was at a low angle, drastically reducing visibility. Armstrong was acquitted.[107] In an 1859 murder case, leading up to his presidential campaign, Lincoln elevated his profile with his defense of Simeon Quinn \"Peachy\" Harrison, who was a third cousin;[g] Harrison was also the grandson of Lincoln's political opponent, Rev. Peter Cartwright.[109] Harrison was charged with the murder of Greek Crafton who, as he lay dying of his wounds, confessed to Cartwright that he had provoked Harrison.[110] Lincoln angrily protested the judge's initial decision to exclude Cartwright's testimony about the confession as inadmissible hearsay. Lincoln argued that the testimony involved a dying declaration and was not subject to the hearsay rule. Instead of holding Lincoln in contempt of court as expected, the judge, a Democrat, reversed his ruling and admitted the testimony into evidence, resulting in Harrison's acquittal.[107] The debate over the status of slavery in the territories failed to alleviate tensions between the slave-holding South and the free North, with the failure of the Compromise of 1850, a legislative package designed to address the issue.[111] In his 1852 eulogy for Clay, Lincoln highlighted the latter's support for gradual emancipation and opposition to \"both extremes\" on the slavery issue.[112] As the slavery debate in the Nebraska and Kansas territories became particularly acrimonious, Illinois Senator Stephen A. Douglas proposed popular sovereignty as a compromise; the measure would allow the electorate of each territory to decide the status of slavery. The legislation alarmed many Northerners, who sought to prevent the spread of slavery that could result, but Douglas's KansasâNebraska Act narrowly passed Congress in May 1854.[113] Lincoln did not comment on the act until months later in his \"Peoria Speech\" of October 1854. Lincoln then declared his opposition to slavery, which he repeated en route to the presidency.[114] He said the Kansas Act had a \"declared indifference, but as I must think, a covert real zeal for the spread of slavery. I cannot but hate it. I hate it because of the monstrous injustice of slavery itself. I hate it because it deprives our republican example of its just influence in the world....\"[115] Lincoln's attacks on the KansasâNebraska Act marked his return to political life.[116] Nationally, the Whigs were irreparably split by the KansasâNebraska Act and other efforts to compromise on the slavery issue. Reflecting on the demise of his party, Lincoln wrote in 1855, \"I think I am a Whig, but others say there are no Whigs, and that I am an abolitionist. ... I do no more than oppose the extension of slavery.\"[117] The new Republican Party was formed as a northern party dedicated to antislavery, drawing from the antislavery wing of the Whig Party and combining Free Soil, Liberty, and antislavery Democratic Party members,[118] Lincoln resisted early Republican entreaties, fearing that the new party would become a platform for extreme abolitionists.[119] Lincoln held out hope for rejuvenating the Whigs, though he lamented his party's growing closeness with the nativist Know Nothing movement.[120] In 1854, Lincoln was elected to the Illinois legislature, but before the term began the following January he declined to take his seat so that he would be eligible to be a candidate in the upcoming U.S. Senate election.[121][122] The year's elections showed the strong opposition to the KansasâNebraska Act, and in the aftermath Lincoln sought election to the U.S. Senate.[116] At that time, senators were elected by state legislatures.[123] After leading in the first six rounds of voting, he was unable to obtain a majority. Lincoln instructed his backers to vote for Lyman Trumbull. Trumbull was an antislavery Democrat and had received few votes in the earlier ballots; his supporters, also antislavery Democrats, had vowed not to support any Whig. Lincoln's decision to withdraw enabled his Whig supporters and Trumbull's antislavery Democrats to combine and defeat the mainstream Democratic candidate, Joel Aldrich Matteson.[124] Violent political confrontations in Kansas continued, and opposition to the KansasâNebraska Act remained strong throughout the North. As the 1856 elections approached, Lincoln joined the Republicans and attended the Bloomington Convention, where the Illinois Republican Party was established . The convention platform endorsed Congress's right to regulate slavery in the territories and backed the admission of Kansas as a free state. Lincoln gave the final speech of the convention supporting the party platform and called for the preservation of the Union.[125] At the June 1856 Republican National Convention, though Lincoln received support to run as vice president, John C. FrÃ©mont and William Dayton were on the ticket, which Lincoln supported throughout Illinois. The Democrats nominated former Secretary of State James Buchanan and the Know-Nothings nominated former Whig President Millard Fillmore.[126] Buchanan prevailed, while Republican William Henry Bissell won election as Governor of Illinois, and Lincoln became a leading Republican in Illinois.[127][h] Dred Scott was a slave whose master took him from a slave state to a territory that was free as a result of the Missouri Compromise. After Scott was returned to the slave state, he petitioned a federal court for his freedom. His petition was denied in Dred Scott v. Sandford (1857).[i] In his opinion, Supreme Court Chief Justice Roger B. Taney wrote that black people were not citizens and derived no rights from the Constitution, and that the Missouri Compromise was unconstitutional for infringing upon slave owners' \"property\" rights. While many Democrats hoped that Dred Scott would end the dispute over slavery in the territories, the decision sparked further outrage in the North.[130] Lincoln denounced it as the product of a conspiracy of Democrats to support the Slave Power.[131] He argued the decision was at variance with the Declaration of Independence; he said that while the founding fathers did not believe all men equal in every respect, they believed all men were equal \"in certain inalienable rights, among which are life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness\".[132] In 1858, Douglas was up for re-election in the U.S. Senate, and Lincoln hoped to defeat him. Many in the party felt that a former Whig should be nominated in 1858, and Lincoln's 1856 campaigning and support of Trumbull had earned him a favor.[133] Some eastern Republicans supported Douglas for his opposition to the Lecompton Constitution and admission of Kansas as a slave state.[134] Many Illinois Republicans resented this eastern interference. For the first time, Illinois Republicans held a convention to agree upon a Senate candidate, and Lincoln won the nomination with little opposition.[135] Lincoln accepted the nomination with great enthusiasm and zeal. After his nomination he delivered his House Divided Speech, with the biblical reference Mark 3:25, \"A house divided against itself cannot stand. I believe this government cannot endure permanently half slave and half free. I do not expect the Union to be dissolvedâI do not expect the house to fallâbut I do expect it will cease to be divided. It will become all one thing, or all the other.\"[136] The speech created a stark image of the danger of disunion.[137] The stage was then set for the election of the Illinois legislature which would, in turn, select Lincoln or Douglas.[138] When informed of Lincoln's nomination, Douglas stated, \"[Lincoln] is the strong man of the party ... and if I beat him, my victory will be hardly won.\"[139] The Senate campaign featured seven debates between Lincoln and Douglas. These were the most famous political debates in American history; they had an atmosphere akin to a prizefight and drew crowds in the thousands.[140] The principals stood in stark contrast both physically and politically. Lincoln warned that the Slave Power was threatening the values of republicanism, and he accused Douglas of distorting the Founding Fathers' premise that all men are created equal. In his Freeport Doctrine, Douglas argued that, despite the Dred Scott decision, which he claimed to support,[141] local settlers, under the doctrine of popular sovereignty, should be free to choose whether to allow slavery within their territory, and he accused Lincoln of having joined the abolitionists.[142] Lincoln's argument assumed a moral tone, as he claimed that Douglas represented a conspiracy to promote slavery. Douglas's argument was more legal in nature, claiming that Lincoln was defying the authority of the U.S. Supreme Court as exercised in the Dred Scott decision.[143] Though the Republican legislative candidates won more popular votes, the Democrats won more seats, and the legislature re-elected Douglas. However, Lincoln's articulation of the issues had given him a national political presence.[144] In May 1859, Lincoln purchased the Illinois Staats-Anzeiger, a German-language newspaper that was consistently supportive; most of the state's 130,000 German Americans voted for Democrats, but the German-language paper mobilized Republican support.[145] In the aftermath of the 1858 election, newspapers frequently mentioned Lincoln as a potential Republican presidential candidate, rivaled by William H. Seward, Salmon P. Chase, Edward Bates, and Simon Cameron. While Lincoln was popular in the Midwest, he lacked support in the Northeast and was unsure whether to seek the office.[146] In January 1860, Lincoln told a group of political allies that he would accept the presidential nomination if offered and, in the following months, several local papers endorsed his candidacy.[147] Over the coming months Lincoln was tireless, making nearly fifty speeches along the campaign trail. By the quality and simplicity of his rhetoric, he quickly became the champion of the Republican party. However, despite his overwhelming support in the Midwestern United States, he was less appreciated in the east. Horace Greeley, editor of the New York Tribune, at that time wrote up an unflattering account of Lincoln's compromising position on slavery and his reluctance to challenge the court's Dred Scott ruling, which was promptly used against him by his political rivals.[148][149] On February 27, 1860, powerful New York Republicans invited Lincoln to give a speech at Cooper Union, in which he argued that the Founding Fathers of the United States had little use for popular sovereignty and had repeatedly sought to restrict slavery. He insisted that morality required opposition to slavery and rejected any \"groping for some middle ground between the right and the wrong\".[150] Many in the audience thought he appeared awkward and even ugly.[151] But Lincoln demonstrated intellectual leadership, which brought him into contention. Journalist Noah Brooks reported, \"No man ever before made such an impression on his first appeal to a New York audience\".[152] Historian David Herbert Donald described the speech as \"a superb political move for an unannounced presidential aspirant. Appearing in Seward's home state, sponsored by a group largely loyal to Chase, Lincoln shrewdly made no reference to either of these Republican rivals for the nomination.\"[153] In response to an inquiry about his ambitions, Lincoln said, \"The taste is in my mouth a little\".[154] On May 9â10, 1860, the Illinois Republican State Convention was held in Decatur.[155] Lincoln's followers organized a campaign team led by David Davis, Norman Judd, Leonard Swett, and Jesse DuBois, and Lincoln received his first endorsement.[156] Exploiting his embellished frontier legend (clearing land and splitting fence rails), Lincoln's supporters adopted the label of \"The Rail Candidate\".[157] In 1860, Lincoln described himself: \"I am in height, six feet, four inches, nearly; lean in flesh, weighing, on an average, one hundred and eighty pounds; dark complexion, with coarse black hair, and gray eyes.\"[158] Michael Martinez wrote about the effective imaging of Lincoln by his campaign. At times he was presented as the plain-talking \"Rail Splitter\" and at other times he was \"Honest Abe\", unpolished but trustworthy.[159] On May 18 at the Republican National Convention in Chicago, Lincoln won the nomination on the third ballot, beating candidates such as Seward and Chase. A former Democrat, Hannibal Hamlin of Maine, was nominated for vice president to balance the ticket. Lincoln's success depended on his campaign team, his reputation as a moderate on the slavery issue, and his strong support for internal improvements and the tariff.[160] Pennsylvania put him over the top, led by the state's iron interests who were reassured by his tariff support.[161] Lincoln's managers had focused on this delegation while honoring Lincoln's dictate to \"Make no contracts that will bind me\".[162] As the Slave Power tightened its grip on the national government, most Republicans agreed with Lincoln that the North was the aggrieved party. Throughout the 1850s, Lincoln had doubted the prospects of civil war, and his supporters rejected claims that his election would incite secession.[163] When Douglas was selected as the candidate of the Northern Democrats, delegates from eleven slave states walked out of the Democratic convention; they opposed Douglas's position on popular sovereignty, and selected incumbent Vice President John C. Breckinridge as their candidate.[164] A group of former Whigs and Know Nothings formed the Constitutional Union Party and nominated John Bell of Tennessee. Lincoln and Douglas competed for votes in the North, while Bell and Breckinridge primarily found support in the South.[133] Before the Republican convention, the Lincoln campaign began cultivating a nationwide youth organization, the Wide Awakes, which it used to generate popular support throughout the country to spearhead voter registration drives, thinking that new voters and young voters tended to embrace new parties.[165] People of the Northern states knew the Southern states would vote against Lincoln and rallied supporters for Lincoln.[166] As Douglas and the other candidates campaigned, Lincoln gave no speeches, relying on the enthusiasm of the Republican Party. The party did the leg work that produced majorities across the North and produced an abundance of campaign posters, leaflets, and newspaper editorials. Republican speakers focused first on the party platform, and second on Lincoln's life story, emphasizing his childhood poverty. The goal was to demonstrate the power of \"free labor\", which allowed a common farm boy to work his way to the top by his own efforts.[167] The Republican Party's production of campaign literature dwarfed the combined opposition; a Chicago Tribune writer produced a pamphlet that detailed Lincoln's life and sold 100,000â200,000 copies.[168] Though he did not give public appearances, many sought to visit him and write him. In the runup to the election, he took an office in the Illinois state capitol to deal with the influx of attention. He also hired John George Nicolay as his personal secretary, who would remain in that role during the presidency.[169] On November 6, 1860, Lincoln was elected the 16th president. He was the first Republican president and his victory was entirely due to his support in the North and West. No ballots were cast for him in 10 of the 15 Southern slave states, and he won only two of 996 counties in all the Southern states, an omen of the impending Civil War.[170][171] Lincoln received 1,866,452 votes, or 39.8% of the total in a four-way race, carrying the free Northern states, as well as California and Oregon.[172] His victory in the Electoral College was decisive: Lincoln had 180 votes to 123 for his opponents.[173] The South was outraged by Lincoln's election, and in response secessionists implemented plans to leave the Union before he took office in March 1861.[175] On December 20, 1860, South Carolina took the lead by adopting an ordinance of secession; by February 1, 1861, Florida, Mississippi, Alabama, Georgia, Louisiana, and Texas followed.[176] Six of these states declared themselves to be a sovereign nation, the Confederate States of America, and adopted a constitution.[177] The upper South and border states (Delaware, Maryland, Virginia, North Carolina, Tennessee, Kentucky, Missouri, and Arkansas) initially rejected the secessionist appeal.[178] President Buchanan and President-elect Lincoln refused to recognize the Confederacy, declaring secession illegal.[179] The Confederacy selected Jefferson Davis as its provisional president on February 9, 1861.[180] Attempts at compromise followed but Lincoln and the Republicans rejected the proposed Crittenden Compromise as contrary to the Party's platform of free-soil in the territories.[181] Lincoln said, \"I will suffer death before I consent ... to any concession or compromise which looks like buying the privilege to take possession of this government to which we have a constitutional right\".[182] Lincoln supported the Corwin Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, which passed Congress and was awaiting ratification by the states when Lincoln took office. That doomed amendment would have protected slavery in states where it already existed.[183] On March 4, 1861, in his first inaugural address, Lincoln said that, because he holds \"such a provision to now be implied constitutional law, I have no objection to its being made express and irrevocable\".[184] A few weeks before the war, Lincoln sent a letter to every governor informing them Congress had passed a joint resolution to amend the Constitution.[185] On February 11, 1861, Lincoln gave a particularly emotional farewell address upon leaving Springfield; he would never again return to Springfield alive.[186][187] Lincoln traveled east in a special train. Due to secessionist plots, a then-unprecedented attention to security was given to him and his train. En route to his inauguration, Lincoln addressed crowds and legislatures across the North.[188] The president-elect evaded suspected assassins in Baltimore. He traveled in disguise, wearing a soft felt hat instead of his customary stovepipe hat and draping an overcoat over his shoulders while hunching slightly to conceal his height. His friend Congressman Elihu B. Washburne recognized him on the platform upon arrival and loudly called out to him.[189] On February 23, 1861, he arrived in Washington, D.C., which was placed under substantial military guard.[190] Lincoln directed his inaugural address to the South, proclaiming once again that he had no inclination to abolish slavery in the Southern states: Apprehension seems to exist among the people of the Southern States, that by the accession of a Republican Administration, their property, and their peace, and personal security, are to be endangered. There has never been any reasonable cause for such apprehension. Indeed, the most ample evidence to the contrary has all the while existed, and been open to their inspection. It is found in nearly all the published speeches of him who now addresses you. I do but quote from one of those speeches when I declare that \"I have no purpose, directly or indirectly, to interfere with the institution of slavery in the States where it exists. I believe I have no lawful right to do so, and I have no inclination to do so.\" Lincoln cited his plans for banning the expansion of slavery as the key source of conflict between North and South, stating \"One section of our country believes slavery is right and ought to be extended, while the other believes it is wrong and ought not to be extended. This is the only substantial dispute.\" The president ended his address with an appeal to the people of the South: \"We are not enemies, but friends. We must not be enemies.... The mystic chords of memory, stretching from every battlefield, and patriot grave, to every living heart and hearthstone, all over this broad land, will yet swell the chorus of the Union, when again touched, as surely they will be, by the better angels of our nature.\"[193] The failure of the Peace Conference of 1861 signaled that legislative compromise was impossible. By March 1861, no leaders of the insurrection had proposed rejoining the Union on any terms. Meanwhile, Lincoln and the Republican leadership agreed that the dismantling of the Union could not be tolerated.[194] In his second inaugural address, Lincoln looked back on the situation at the time and said: \"Both parties deprecated war, but one of them would make war rather than let the Nation survive, and the other would accept war rather than let it perish, and the war came.\" Major Robert Anderson, commander of the Union's Fort Sumter in Charleston, South Carolina, sent a request for provisions to Washington, and Lincoln's order to meet that request was seen by the secessionists as an act of war. On April 12, 1861, Confederate forces fired on Union troops at Fort Sumter and began the fight. Historian Allan Nevins argued that the newly inaugurated Lincoln made three miscalculations: underestimating the gravity of the crisis, exaggerating the strength of Unionist sentiment in the South, and overlooking Southern Unionist opposition to an invasion.[195] William Tecumseh Sherman talked to Lincoln during inauguration week and was \"sadly disappointed\" at his failure to realize that \"the country was sleeping on a volcano\" and that the South was preparing for war.[196] Donald concludes, \"His repeated efforts to avoid collision in the months between inauguration and the firing on Fort Sumter showed he adhered to his vow not to be the first to shed fraternal blood. But he had also vowed not to surrender the forts.... The only resolution of these contradictory positions was for the Confederates to fire the first shot\". They did just that.[197] On April 15, Lincoln called on the states to send a total of 75,000 volunteer troops to recapture forts, protect Washington, and \"preserve the Union\", which, in his view, remained intact despite the seceding states. This call forced states to choose sides. Virginia seceded and was rewarded with the designation of Richmond as the Confederate capital, despite its exposure to Union lines. North Carolina, Tennessee, and Arkansas followed over the following two months. Secession sentiment was strong in Missouri and Maryland, but did not prevail; Kentucky remained neutral.[198] The Fort Sumter attack rallied Americans north of the Mason-Dixon line to defend the nation. As states sent Union regiments south, on April 19 Baltimore mobs in control of the rail links attacked Union troops who were changing trains. Local leaders' groups later burned critical rail bridges to the capital and the Army responded by arresting local Maryland officials. Lincoln suspended the writ of habeas corpus in an effort to protect the troops trying to reach Washington.[199] John Merryman, one Maryland official hindering the U.S. troop movements, petitioned Supreme Court Chief Justice Roger B. Taney to issue a writ of habeas corpus. In June, in Ex parte Merryman, Taney, not ruling on behalf of the Supreme Court,[200] issued the writ, believing that Article I, section 9 of the Constitution authorized only Congress and not the president to suspend it. But Lincoln invoked nonacquiescence and persisted with the policy of suspension in select areas.[201][202] Lincoln took executive control of the war and shaped the Union military strategy. He responded to the unprecedented political and military crisis as commander-in-chief by exercising unprecedented authority. He expanded his war powers, imposed a blockade on Confederate ports, disbursed funds before appropriation by Congress, suspended habeas corpus, and arrested and imprisoned thousands of suspected Confederate sympathizers. Lincoln gained the support of Congress and the northern public for these actions. Lincoln also had to reinforce Union sympathies in the border slave states and keep the war from becoming an international conflict.[203] It was clear from the outset that bipartisan support was essential to success, and that any compromise alienated factions on both sides of the aisle, such as the appointment of Republicans and Democrats to command positions. Copperheads criticized Lincoln for refusing to compromise on slavery. The Radical Republicans criticized him for moving too slowly in abolishing slavery.[204] On August 6, 1861, Lincoln signed the Confiscation Act of 1861, which authorized judicial proceedings to confiscate and free slaves who were used to support the Confederates. The law had little practical effect, but it signaled political support for abolishing slavery.[205] In August 1861, General John C. FrÃ©mont, the 1856 Republican presidential nominee, without consulting Washington, issued a martial edict freeing slaves of the rebels. Lincoln canceled the proclamation as violating the Confiscation Act of 1861 and beyond FrÃ©mont's authority to issue.[206] As a result, Union enlistments from Maryland, Kentucky, and Missouri increased by over 40,000.[207] Internationally, Lincoln wanted to forestall foreign military aid to the Confederacy.[208] He relied on his combative Secretary of State William Seward while working closely with Senate Foreign Relations Committee chairman Charles Sumner.[209] In the 1861 Trent Affair, which threatened war with Great Britain, the U.S. Navy illegally intercepted a British mail ship, the Trent, on the high seas and seized two Confederate envoys; Britain protested vehemently while the U.S. cheered. Lincoln ended the crisis by releasing the two diplomats. Biographer James G. Randall dissected Lincoln's successful techniques:[210] his restraint, his avoidance of any outward expression of truculence, his early softening of State Department's attitude toward Britain, his deference toward Seward and Sumner, his withholding of his paper prepared for the occasion, his readiness to arbitrate, his golden silence in addressing Congress, his shrewdness in recognizing that war must be averted, and his clear perception that a point could be clinched for America's true position at the same time that full satisfaction was given to a friendly country. Lincoln painstakingly monitored the telegraph reports coming into the War Department. He tracked all phases of the effort, consulting with governors and selecting generals based on their success, their state, and their party. In January 1862, after complaints of inefficiency and profiteering in the War Department, Lincoln replaced War Secretary Simon Cameron with Edwin Stanton. Stanton centralized the War Department's activities, auditing and canceling contracts, saving the federal government $17,000,000.[211] Stanton was a staunch Unionist, pro-business, conservative Democrat who gravitated toward the Radical Republican faction. He worked more often and more closely with Lincoln than did any other senior official. \"Stanton and Lincoln virtually conducted the war together\", say Thomas and Hyman.[212] Lincoln's war strategy had two priorities: ensuring that Washington was well-defended and conducting an aggressive war effort for a prompt, decisive victory.[j] Twice a week, Lincoln met with his cabinet in the afternoon. Occasionally Mary prevailed on him to take a carriage ride, concerned that he was working too hard.[214] For his edification Lincoln relied upon a book by his chief of staff General Henry Halleck entitled Elements of Military Art and Science; Halleck was a disciple of the European strategist Antoine-Henri Jomini. Lincoln began to appreciate the critical need to control strategic points, such as the Mississippi River.[215] Lincoln saw the importance of Vicksburg and understood the necessity of defeating the enemy's army, rather than merely capturing territory.[216] In directing the Union's war strategy, Lincoln valued the advice of Gen. Winfield Scott, even after his retirement as Commanding General of the United States Army. On June 23â24, 1862, Lincoln made an unannounced visit to West Point, where he spent five hours consulting with Scott regarding the handling of the Civil War and the staffing of the War Department.[217][218] After the Union rout at Bull Run and Winfield Scott's retirement, Lincoln appointed Major General George B. McClellan general-in-chief.[219] McClellan then took months to plan his Virginia Peninsula Campaign. McClellan's slow progress frustrated Lincoln, as did his position that no troops were needed to defend Washington. McClellan, in turn, blamed the failure of the campaign on Lincoln's reservation of troops for the capital.[220] In 1862, Lincoln removed McClellan for the general's continued inaction. He elevated Henry Halleck in July and appointed John Pope as head of the new Army of Virginia.[221] Pope satisfied Lincoln's desire to advance on Richmond from the north, thereby protecting Washington from counterattack.[222] But in the summer of 1862 Pope was soundly defeated at the Second Battle of Bull Run, forcing the Army of the Potomac back to defend Washington.[223] Despite his dissatisfaction with McClellan's failure to reinforce Pope, Lincoln restored him to command of all forces around Washington.[224] Two days after McClellan's return to command, General Robert E. Lee's forces crossed the Potomac River into Maryland, leading to the Battle of Antietam.[225] That battle, a Union victory, was among the bloodiest in American history; it facilitated Lincoln's Emancipation Proclamation in January.[226] McClellan then resisted the president's demand that he pursue Lee's withdrawing army, while General Don Carlos Buell likewise refused orders to move the Army of the Ohio against rebel forces in eastern Tennessee. Lincoln replaced Buell with William Rosecrans; and after the 1862 midterm elections he replaced McClellan with Ambrose Burnside. The appointments were both politically neutral and adroit on Lincoln's part.[227] Against presidential advice Burnside launched an offensive across the Rappahannock River and was defeated by Lee at Fredericksburg in December. Desertions during 1863 came in the thousands and only increased after Fredericksburg, so Lincoln replaced Burnside with Joseph Hooker.[228] In the 1862 midterm elections, the Republicans suffered severe losses due to rising inflation, high taxes, rumors of corruption, suspension of habeas corpus, military draft law, and fears that freed slaves would come North and undermine the labor market. The Emancipation Proclamation gained votes for Republicans in rural New England and the upper Midwest, but cost votes in the Irish and German strongholds and in the lower Midwest, where many Southerners had lived for generations.[229] In the spring of 1863, Lincoln was sufficiently optimistic about upcoming military campaigns to think the end of the war could be near; the plans included attacks by Hooker on Lee north of Richmond, Rosecrans on Chattanooga, Grant on Vicksburg, and a naval assault on Charleston.[230] Hooker was routed by Lee at the Battle of Chancellorsville in May, then resigned and was replaced by George Meade.[231] Meade followed Lee north into Pennsylvania and beat him in the Gettysburg Campaign, but then failed to follow up despite Lincoln's demands. At the same time, Grant captured Vicksburg and gained control of the Mississippi River, splitting the far western rebel states.[232] The federal government's power to end slavery was limited by the Constitution, which before 1865, was understood to reserve the issue to the individual states. Lincoln believed that slavery would be rendered obsolete if its expansion into new territories were prevented, because these territories would be admitted to the Union as free states, and free states would come to outnumber slave states. He sought to persuade the states to agree to compensation for emancipating their slaves.[233] Lincoln rejected Major General John C. FrÃ©mont's August 1861 emancipation attempt, as well as one by Major General David Hunter in May 1862, on the grounds that it was not within their power and might upset loyal border states enough for them to secede.[234] In June 1862, Congress passed an act banning slavery on all federal territory, which Lincoln signed. In July, the Confiscation Act of 1862 was enacted, providing court procedures to free the slaves of those convicted of aiding the rebellion; Lincoln approved the bill despite his belief that it was unconstitutional. He felt such action could be taken only within the war powers of the commander-in-chief, which he planned to exercise. On July 22, 1862, Lincoln reviewed a draft of the Emancipation Proclamation with his cabinet.[235] Peace Democrats (Copperheads) argued that emancipation was a stumbling block to peace and reunification, but Republican editor Horace Greeley of the New-York Tribune, in his public letter, \"The Prayer of Twenty Millions\", implored Lincoln to embrace emancipation.[236][237] In a public letter of August 22, 1862, Lincoln replied to Greeley, writing that while he personally wished all men could be free, his first obligation as president was to preserve the Union:[238] My paramount object in this struggle is to save the Union, and is not either to save or to destroy slavery. If I could save the Union without freeing any slave I would do it, and if I could save it by freeing all the slaves I would do it; and if I could save it by freeing some and leaving others alone I would also do that. What I do about slavery, and the colored race, I do because I believe it helps to save the Union; and what I forbear, I forbear because I do not believe it would help to save the Union ... [Â¶] I have here stated my purpose according to my view of official duty; and I intend no modification of my oft-expressed personal wish that all men everywhere could be free.[239] When Lincoln published his reply to Greeley, he had already decided to issue the preliminary Emancipation Proclamation and therefore had already chosen the third option he mentioned in his letter to Greeley: to free some of the slaves, namely those in the states in rebellion. Some scholars, therefore, believe that his reply to Greeley was disingenuous and was intended to reassure white people who would have opposed a war for emancipation that emancipation was merely a means to preserve the Union.[240] On September 22, 1862, Lincoln issued the preliminary Emancipation Proclamation,[241] which announced that, in states still in rebellion on January 1, 1863, the slaves would be freed. He spent the next 100 days, between September 22 and January 1, preparing the army and the nation for emancipation, while Democrats rallied their voters by warning of the threat that freed slaves posed to northern whites.[242] At the same time, during those 100 days, Lincoln made efforts to end the war with slavery intact, suggesting that he still took seriously the first option he mentioned in his letter to Greeley: saving the Union without freeing any slave.[243] But, on January 1, 1863, keeping his word, Lincoln issued the Emancipation Proclamation,[244] freeing the slaves in 10 states not then under Union control,[245] with exemptions specified for areas under such control.[246] Lincoln's comment on signing the Proclamation was: \"I never, in my life, felt more certain that I was doing right, than I do in signing this paper.\"[247] With the abolition of slavery in the rebel states now a military objective, Union armies advancing south \"enable[d] thousands of slaves to escape to freedom\".[248] The Emancipation Proclamation having stated that freedmen would be \"received into the armed service of the United States,\" enlisting these freedmen became official policy. By the spring of 1863, Lincoln was ready to recruit black troops in more than token numbers. In a letter to Tennessee military governor Andrew Johnson encouraging him to lead the way in raising black troops, Lincoln wrote, \"The bare sight of fifty thousand armed, and drilled black soldiers on the banks of the Mississippi would end the rebellion at once\".[249] By the end of 1863, at Lincoln's direction, General Lorenzo Thomas \"had enrolled twenty regiments of African Americans\" from the Mississippi Valley.[249] Lincoln spoke at the dedication of the Gettysburg battlefield cemetery on November 19, 1863.[252] In 272 words, and three minutes, Lincoln asserted that the nation was born not in 1789, but in 1776, \"conceived in Liberty, and dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal\". He defined the war as dedicated to the principles of liberty and equality for all. He declared that the deaths of so many brave soldiers would not be in vain, that the future of democracy would be assured, and that \"government of the people, by the people, for the people, shall not perish from the earth\".[253] Defying his prediction that \"the world will little note, nor long remember what we say here\", the Address became the most quoted speech in American history.[254] General Ulysses Grant's victories at the Battle of Shiloh and in the Vicksburg campaign impressed Lincoln. Responding to criticism of Grant after Shiloh, Lincoln had said, \"I can't spare this man. He fights.\"[255] With Grant in command, Lincoln felt the Union Army could advance in multiple theaters, while also including black troops. Meade's failure to capture Lee's army after Gettysburg and the continued passivity of the Army of the Potomac persuaded Lincoln to promote Grant to supreme commander. Grant then assumed command of Meade's army.[256] Lincoln was concerned that Grant might be considering a presidential candidacy in 1864. He arranged for an intermediary to inquire into Grant's political intentions, and once assured that he had none, Lincoln promoted Grant to the newly revived rank of Lieutenant General, a rank which had been unoccupied since George Washington.[257] Authorization for such a promotion \"with the advice and consent of the Senate\" was provided by a new bill which Lincoln signed the same day he submitted Grant's name to the Senate. His nomination was confirmed by the Senate on March 2, 1864.[258] Grant in 1864 waged the bloody Overland Campaign, which exacted heavy losses on both sides.[259] When Lincoln asked what Grant's plans were, the persistent general replied, \"I propose to fight it out on this line if it takes all summer.\"[260] Grant's army moved steadily south. Lincoln traveled to Grant's headquarters at City Point, Virginia, to confer with Grant and William Tecumseh Sherman.[261] Lincoln reacted to Union losses by mobilizing support throughout the North.[262] Lincoln authorized Grant to target infrastructureâplantations, railroads, and bridgesâhoping to weaken the South's morale and fighting ability. He emphasized defeat of the Confederate armies over destruction (which was considerable) for its own sake.[263] Lincoln's engagement became distinctly personal on one occasion in 1864 when Confederate general Jubal Early raided Washington, D.C. Legend has it that while Lincoln watched from an exposed position, Union Captain (and future Supreme Court Justice) Oliver Wendell Holmes Jr. shouted at him, \"Get down, you damn fool, before you get shot!\" But this story is commonly regarded as apocryphal.[264][265][266][267] As Grant continued to weaken Lee's forces, efforts to discuss peace began. Confederate Vice President Stephens led a group meeting with Lincoln, Seward, and others at Hampton Roads. Lincoln refused to negotiate with the Confederacy as a coequal; his objective to end the fighting was not realized.[268] On April 1, 1865, Grant nearly encircled Petersburg in a siege. The Confederate government evacuated Richmond and Lincoln visited the conquered capital. On April 9, Lee surrendered to Grant at Appomattox, officially ending the war.[269] Lincoln ran for reelection in 1864, while uniting the main Republican factions along with War Democrats Edwin M. Stanton and Andrew Johnson. Lincoln used conversation and his patronage powersâgreatly expanded from peacetimeâto build support and fend off the Radicals' efforts to replace him.[270] At its convention, the Republican Party selected Johnson as his running mate. To broaden his coalition to include War Democrats as well as Republicans, Lincoln ran under the label of the new Union Party.[271] Grant's bloody stalemates damaged Lincoln's re-election prospects, and many Republicans feared defeat. Lincoln confidentially pledged in writing that if he should lose the election, he would still defeat the Confederacy before turning over the White House;[272] Lincoln did not show the pledge to his cabinet, but asked them to sign the sealed envelope. The pledge read as follows: This morning, as for some days past, it seems exceedingly probable that this Administration will not be re-elected. Then it will be my duty to so co-operate with the President elect, as to save the Union between the election and the inauguration; as he will have secured his election on such ground that he cannot possibly save it afterward.[273] The Democratic platform followed the \"Peace wing\" of the party and called the war a \"failure\"; but their candidate, McClellan, supported the war and repudiated the platform. Meanwhile, Lincoln emboldened Grant with more troops and Republican party support. Sherman's capture of Atlanta in September and David Farragut's capture of Mobile ended defeatism.[274] The Democratic Party was deeply split, with some leaders and most soldiers openly for Lincoln. The National Union Party was united by Lincoln's support for emancipation. State Republican parties stressed the perfidy of the Copperheads.[275] On November 8, Lincoln carried all but three states, including 78 percent of Union soldiers.[276] On March 4, 1865, Lincoln delivered his second inaugural address. In it, he deemed the war casualties to be God's will. Historian Mark Noll places the speech \"among the small handful of semi-sacred texts by which Americans conceive their place in the world;\" it is inscribed in the Lincoln Memorial.[277] Lincoln said: Fondly do we hopeâfervently do we prayâthat this mighty scourge of war may speedily pass away. Yet, if God wills that it continue, until all the wealth piled by the bond-man's two hundred and fifty years of unrequited toil shall be sunk, and until every drop of blood drawn with the lash, shall be paid by another drawn with the sword, as was said three thousand years ago, so still it must be said, \"the judgments of the Lord, are true and righteous altogether\". With malice toward none; with charity for all; with firmness in the right, as God gives us to see the right, let us strive on to finish the work we are in; to bind up the nation's wounds; to care for him who shall have borne the battle, and for his widow, and his orphanâto do all which may achieve and cherish a just and lasting peace, among ourselves, and with all nations.[278] Among those present for this speech was actor John Wilkes Booth, who, on April 14, 1865, just over a month after Lincolnâs second inauguration, assassinated him. Reconstruction preceded the war's end, as Lincoln and his associates considered the reintegration of the nation, and the fates of Confederate leaders and freed slaves. When a general asked Lincoln how the defeated Confederates were to be treated, Lincoln replied, \"Let 'em up easy.\"[279] Lincoln was determined to find meaning in the war in its aftermath, and did not want to continue to outcast the southern states. His main goal was to keep the union together, so he proceeded by focusing not on whom to blame, but on how to rebuild the nation as one.[280] Lincoln led the moderates in Reconstruction policy and was opposed by the Radicals, under Rep. Thaddeus Stevens, Sen. Charles Sumner and Sen. Benjamin Wade, who otherwise remained Lincoln's allies. Determined to reunite the nation and not alienate the South, Lincoln urged that speedy elections under generous terms be held. His Amnesty Proclamation of December 8, 1863, offered pardons to those who had not held a Confederate civil office and had not mistreated Union prisoners, if they were willing to sign an oath of allegiance.[281] As Southern states fell, they needed leaders while their administrations were restored. In Tennessee and Arkansas, Lincoln respectively appointed Johnson and Frederick Steele as military governors. In Louisiana, Lincoln ordered General Nathaniel P. Banks to promote a plan that would reestablish statehood when 10 percent of the voters agreed, and only if the reconstructed states abolished slavery. Democratic opponents accused Lincoln of using the military to ensure his and the Republicans' political aspirations. The Radicals denounced his policy as too lenient, and passed their own plan, the 1864 WadeâDavis Bill, which Lincoln vetoed. The Radicals retaliated by refusing to seat elected representatives from Louisiana, Arkansas, and Tennessee.[282] Lincoln's appointments were designed to harness both moderates and Radicals. To fill Chief Justice Taney's seat on the Supreme Court, he named the Radicals' choice, Salmon P. Chase, whom Lincoln believed would uphold his emancipation and paper money policies.[283] After implementing the Emancipation Proclamation, Lincoln increased pressure on Congress to outlaw slavery throughout the nation with a constitutional amendment. He declared that such an amendment would \"clinch the whole subject\" and by December 1863 an amendment was brought to Congress.[284] The Senate passed it on April 8, 1864, but the first vote in the House of Representatives fell short of the required two-thirds majority. Passage became part of Lincoln's reelection platform, and after his successful reelection, the second attempt in the House passed on January 31, 1865.[285] With ratification, it became the Thirteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution on December 6, 1865.[286] Lincoln believed the federal government had limited responsibility to the millions of freedmen. He signed Senator Charles Sumner's Freedmen's Bureau bill that set up a temporary federal agency designed to meet the immediate needs of former slaves. The law opened land for a lease of three years with the ability to purchase title for the freedmen. Lincoln announced a Reconstruction plan that involved short-term military control, pending readmission under the control of southern Unionists.[287] Historians agree that it is impossible to predict how Reconstruction would have proceeded had Lincoln lived. Biographers James G. Randall and Richard Current, according to David Lincove, argue that:[288] It is likely that had he lived, Lincoln would have followed a policy similar to Johnson's, that he would have clashed with congressional Radicals, that he would have produced a better result for the freedmen than occurred, and that his political skills would have helped him avoid Johnson's mistakes. Eric Foner argues that:[289] Unlike Sumner and other Radicals, Lincoln did not see Reconstruction as an opportunity for a sweeping political and social revolution beyond emancipation. He had long made clear his opposition to the confiscation and redistribution of land. He believed, as most Republicans did in April 1865, that voting requirements should be determined by the states. He assumed that political control in the South would pass to white Unionists, reluctant secessionists, and forward-looking former Confederates. But time and again during the war, Lincoln, after initial opposition, had come to embrace positions first advanced by abolitionists and Radical Republicans. ... Lincoln undoubtedly would have listened carefully to the outcry for further protection for the former slaves. ... It is entirely plausible to imagine Lincoln and Congress agreeing on a Reconstruction policy that encompassed federal protection for basic civil rights plus limited black suffrage, along the lines Lincoln proposed just before his death. Lincoln's relationship with Native Americans started before he was born, with their killing of his grandfather in front of his sons, including Lincoln's father Thomas.[290] Lincoln himself served as a captain in the state militia during the Black Hawk War but saw no combat.[291] Lincoln used appointments to the Indian Bureau as a reward to supporters from Minnesota and Wisconsin. While in office his administration faced difficulties guarding Western settlers, railroads, and telegraphs, from Indian attacks.[292] On August 17, 1862, the Dakota War broke out in Minnesota. Hundreds of settlers were killed, 30,000 were displaced from their homes, and Washington was deeply alarmed.[293] Some feared incorrectly that it might represent a Confederate conspiracy to start a war on the Northwestern frontier.[294] Lincoln ordered thousands of Confederate prisoners of war sent by railroad to put down the uprising.[295] When the Confederates protested forcing Confederate prisoners to fight Indians, Lincoln revoked the policy and none arrived in Minnesota. Lincoln sent General John Pope as commander of the new Department of the Northwest two weeks into the hostilities.[296][297] Before he arrived, the Fond Du Lac band of Chippewa sent Lincoln a letter asking to go to war for the United States against the Sioux, so Lincoln could send Minnesota's troops to fight the South.[298][299] Shortly after, a Mille Lacs Band Chief offered the same at St. Cloud, Minnesota.[300][301] In it the Chippewa specified they wanted to use the indigenous rules of warfare.[302] That meant there would be no prisoners of war, no surrender, no peace agreement.[303] Lincoln did not accept the Chippewa offer, as he could not control the Chippewa, and women and children were considered legitimate casualties in native American warfare.[304] Serving under Gen. Pope was Minnesota Congressman Henry H. Sibley. Minnesota's Governor had made Sibley a Colonel United States Volunteers to command the U.S. force tasked with fighting the war and that eventually defeated Little Crow's forces at the Battle of Wood Lake.[297] The day the Mdewakanton force surrendered at Camp Release, a Chippewa war council met at Minnesota's capitol with another Chippewa offer to Lincoln, to fight the Sioux.[305][additional citation(s) needed] Sibley ordered a military commission to review the actions of the captured, to try those that had committed war crimes. The legitimacy of military commissions trying opposing combatants had been established during the Mexican War.[306] Sibley thought he had 16-20 of the men he wanted for trial, while Gen. Pope ordered all detained be tried. 303 were given death sentences that were subject to Presidential review. Lincoln ordered Pope send all trial transcripts to Washington, where Lincoln and two of his staff examined them. Lincoln realized the trials could be divided into two groups: combat between combatants and combat against civilians.[citation needed] The groups could be identified by their transcripts, the first group all had three pages in length while the second group had more, some up to twelve pages.[citation needed] He placed 263 cases into the first group and commuted their sentences. In the second group were forty cases. One he commuted for becoming a state's witness. Sibley dismissed another when proof surfaced exonerating the defendant. The remaining 38 were executed in the largest mass execution in U.S. history.[307] Questions arose concerning three executions that have not been answered.[308] Less than 4 months afterwards, Lincoln issued the Lieber Code, which governed wartime conduct of the Union Army, by defining command responsibility for war crimes and crimes against humanity. Congressman Alexander Ramsey told Lincoln in 1864, he would have gotten more re-election support in Minnesota had he executed all 303 of the Mdewakanton. Lincoln responded, \"I could not afford to hang men for votes.\"[309] The men whose sentences he commuted were sent to a military prison at Davenport, Iowa. Some he released due to the efforts of Bishop Henry Whipple. Lincoln adhered to the Whig theory of a presidency focused on executing laws while deferring to Congress' responsibility for legislating. Under this philosophy, Lincoln vetoed only four bills during his presidency, including the Wade-Davis Bill with its harsh Reconstruction program.[310] The 1862 Homestead Act made millions of acres of Western government-held land available for purchase at low cost. The 1862 Morrill Land-Grant Colleges Act provided government grants for agricultural colleges in each state. The Pacific Railway Acts of 1862 and 1864 granted federal support for the construction of the United States' first transcontinental railroad, which was completed in 1869.[311] The passage of the Homestead Act and the Pacific Railway Acts was enabled by the absence of Southern congressmen and senators who had opposed the measures in the 1850s.[312] In the selection and use of his cabinet Lincoln employed the strengths of his opponents in a manner that emboldened his presidency. Lincoln commented on his thought process, \"We need the strongest men of the party in the Cabinet. We needed to hold our own people together. I had looked the party over and concluded that these were the very strongest men. Then I had no right to deprive the country of their services.\"[314] Goodwin described the group in her biography as a Team of Rivals.[315] There were two measures passed to raise revenues for the federal government: tariffs (a policy with long precedent), and a federal income tax. In 1861, Lincoln signed the second and third Morrill Tariffs, following the first enacted by Buchanan. He also signed the Revenue Act of 1861, creating the first U.S. income taxâa flat tax of 3 percent on incomes above $800 (equivalent to $27,129 in 2023[316]).[317] The Revenue Act of 1862 adopted rates that increased with income.[318] The Lincoln Administration presided over the expansion of the federal government's economic influence in other areas. The National Banking Act created the system of national banks. The U.S. issued paper currency for the first time, known as greenbacksâprinted in green on the reverse side.[319] In 1862, Congress created the Department of Agriculture.[317] In response to rumors of a renewed draft, the editors of the New York World and the Journal of Commerce published a false draft proclamation that created an opportunity for the editors and others to corner the gold market. Lincoln attacked the media for such behavior, and ordered a military seizure of the two papers which lasted for two days.[320] Lincoln is largely responsible for the Thanksgiving holiday.[321] Thanksgiving had become a regional holiday in New England in the 17th century. It had been sporadically proclaimed by the federal government on irregular dates. The prior proclamation had been during James Madison's presidency 50 years earlier. In 1863, Lincoln declared the final Thursday in November of that year to be a day of Thanksgiving.[321] In June 1864 Lincoln approved the Yosemite Grant enacted by Congress, which provided unprecedented federal protection for the area now known as Yosemite National Park.[322] Lincoln's philosophy on court nominations was that \"we cannot ask a man what he will do, and if we should, and he should answer us, we should despise him for it. Therefore we must take a man whose opinions are known.\"[321] Lincoln made five appointments to the Supreme Court. Noah Haynes Swayne was an anti-slavery lawyer who was committed to the Union. Samuel Freeman Miller supported Lincoln in the 1860 election and was an avowed abolitionist. David Davis was Lincoln's campaign manager in 1860 and had served as a judge in the Illinois court circuit where Lincoln practiced. Democrat Stephen Johnson Field, a previous California Supreme Court justice, provided geographic and political balance. Finally, Lincoln's Treasury Secretary, Salmon P. Chase, became Chief Justice. Lincoln believed Chase was an able jurist, would support Reconstruction legislation, and that his appointment united the Republican Party.[323] Lincoln named his main political rival, William H. Seward, as Secretary of State and left most diplomatic issues in Seward's portfolio. However, Lincoln did select some top diplomats as part of his patronage policy.[324] He also closely watched the handling of the Trent Affair in late 1861 to make sure the situation did not escalate into war with Britain.[325] Seward's main role was to keep Britain and France from supporting the Confederacy. He was successful after indicating to Britain and France that the Union would declare war on them if they supported the South.[326] John Wilkes Booth was a well-known actor and a Confederate spy from Maryland; though he never joined the Confederate army, he had contacts with the Confederate secret service.[327] After attending Lincoln's last public address, on April 11, 1865, in which Lincoln stated his preference that the franchise be conferred on some black men, specifically \"on the very intelligent, and on those who serve our cause as soldiers\",[328] Booth hatched a plot to assassinate the President.[329] When Booth learned of the Lincolns' intent to attend a play with General Grant, he planned to assassinate Lincoln and Grant at Ford's Theatre. \"Booth had attended a dress rehearsal the day before to better rehearse his scheme for shooting Lincoln ... and then escaping.\"[330] Lincoln and his wife attended the play Our American Cousin on the evening of April 14, just five days after the Union victory at the Battle of Appomattox Courthouse. At the last minute, Grant decided to go to New Jersey to visit his children instead of attending the play.[331] At 10:15 in the evening, Booth entered the back of Lincoln's theater box, crept up from behind, and fired at the back of Lincoln's head, mortally wounding him. Lincoln's guest, Major Henry Rathbone, momentarily grappled with Booth, but Booth stabbed him and escaped.[332] After being attended by Doctor Charles Leale and two other doctors, Lincoln was taken across the street to Petersen House. After remaining in a coma for nine hours, Lincoln died at 7:22 in the morning on April 15.[333][k] Stanton saluted and said, \"Now he belongs to the ages.\"[338][l] Lincoln's body was placed in a flag-wrapped coffin, which was loaded into a hearse and escorted to the White House by Union soldiers.[339] President Johnson was sworn in later that same day.[340] Two weeks later, Booth, refusing to surrender, was tracked to a farm in Virginia. He was mortally shot by Sergeant Boston Corbett and died on April 26. Secretary of War Stanton had issued orders that Booth be taken alive, so Corbett was initially arrested to be court martialed. After a brief interview, Stanton declared him a patriot and dismissed the charge.[341] From April 19 to 21, the late President lay in state, first in the East Room of the White House and then in the Capitol Rotunda. The caskets containing Lincoln's body and the body of his third son Willie then traveled for three weeks on the Lincoln Special funeral train.[342] The train followed a circuitous route from Washington D.C. to Springfield, Illinois, stopping at many cities for memorials attended by hundreds of thousands. Many others gathered along the tracks as the train passed with bands, bonfires, and hymn singing[343] or in silent grief. Poet Walt Whitman composed \"When Lilacs Last in the Dooryard Bloom'd\" to eulogize him, one of four poems he wrote about Lincoln.[344] African Americans were especially moved; they had lost their \"Moses\".[345] In a larger sense, the reaction was in response to the deaths of so many men in the war.[346] Historians emphasized the widespread shock and sorrow, but noted that some Lincoln haters celebrated his death.[347] Lincoln's body was buried at Oak Ridge Cemetery in Springfield and now lies within the Lincoln Tomb.[348] As a young man Lincoln was a religious skeptic.[349] He was deeply familiar with the Bible, quoting and praising it.[350] He was private about his position on organized religion and respected the beliefs of others.[351] He never made a clear profession of Christian beliefs.[352] Throughout his public career, Lincoln often quoted Scripture.[353] His three most famous speechesâthe House Divided Speech, the Gettysburg Address, and his second inauguralâall contain direct allusions to Providence and quote from Scripture. In the 1840s Lincoln subscribed to the Doctrine of Necessity, a belief that the human mind was controlled by a higher power.[354] With the death of his son Edward in 1850 he more frequently expressed a dependence on God.[355] He never joined a church, although he frequently attended First Presbyterian Church in Springfield, Illinois, with his wife beginning in 1852.[356][m] When he was president, Lincoln and his wife often attended services at the New York Avenue Presbyterian Church in Washington, D.C.[357] In the 1850s Lincoln asserted his belief in \"providence\" in a general way and rarely used the language or imagery of the evangelicals; instead, he regarded the republicanism of the Founding Fathers with an almost religious reverence.[358] The death of his son Willie in February 1862 may have caused him to look toward religion for solace.[359] After Willie's death, he questioned the divine necessity of the war's severity. He wrote at this time that God \"could have either saved or destroyed the Union without a human contest. Yet the contest began. And having begun He could give the final victory to either side any day. Yet the contest proceeds.\"[360] Lincoln believed in an all-powerful God who shaped events and by 1865 was expressing that belief in major speeches.[352] By the end of the war, he increasingly appealed to the Almighty for solace and to explain events, writing on April 4, 1864, to a newspaper editor in Kentucky: I claim not to have controlled events, but confess plainly that events have controlled me. Now, at the end of three years struggle the nation's condition is not what either party, or any man devised, or expected. God alone can claim it. Whither it is tending seems plain. If God now wills the removal of a great wrong, and wills also that we of the North as well as you of the South, shall pay fairly for our complicity in that wrong, impartial history will find therein new cause to attest and revere the justice and goodness of God.[361] This spirituality can best be seen in his second inaugural address, considered by some scholars[362] as the greatest such address in American history, and by Lincoln himself as his own greatest speech, or one of them at the very least.[n][363] Lincoln explains therein that the cause, purpose, and result of the war was God's will.[364] Lincoln's frequent use of religious imagery and language toward the end of his life may have reflected his own personal beliefs or might have been a device to reach his audiences, who were mostly evangelical Protestants.[365] On the day Lincoln was assassinated, he reportedly told his wife he desired to visit the Holy Land.[366] Lincoln is believed to have had depression, smallpox, and malaria.[367] He took blue mass pills, which contained mercury,[368] to treat constipation.[369] It is unknown to what extent this may have resulted in mercury poisoning.[370] Several claims have been made that Lincoln's health was declining before the assassination. These are often based on photographs of Lincoln appearing to show weight loss and muscle wasting.[371] It is also suspected that he might have had a rare genetic disease such as Marfan syndrome or multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2B.[371] Lincoln's redefinition of republican values has been stressed by historians such as John Patrick Diggins, Harry V. Jaffa, Vernon Burton, Eric Foner, and Herman J. Belz.[372] Lincoln called the Declaration of Independenceâwhich emphasized freedom and equality for allâthe \"sheet anchor\" of republicanism beginning in the 1850s. He did this at a time when the Constitution, which \"tolerated slavery\", was the focus of most political discourse.[373] Diggins notes, \"Lincoln presented Americans a theory of history that offers a profound contribution to the theory and destiny of republicanism itself\" in the 1860 Cooper Union speech.[374] Instead of focusing on the legality of an argument, he focused on the moral basis of republicanism.[375] His position on war was founded on a legal argument regarding the Constitution as essentially a contract among the states, and all parties must agree to pull out of the contract. Furthermore, it was a national duty to ensure the republic stands in every state.[376] Many soldiers and religious leaders from the north, though, felt the fight for liberty and freedom of slaves was ordained by their moral and religious beliefs.[377] As a Whig activist Lincoln was a spokesman for business interests, favoring high tariffs, banks, infrastructure improvements, and railroads, in opposition to Jacksonian democrats.[378] Lincoln shared the sympathies that the Jacksonians professed for the common man, but he disagreed with the Jacksonian view that the government should be divorced from economic enterprise.[379] Nevertheless, Lincoln admired Andrew Jackson's steeliness as well as his patriotism.[380] According to historian Sean Wilentz:[380] Just as the Republican Party of the 1850s absorbed certain elements of Jacksonianism, so Lincoln, whose Whiggery had always been more egalitarian than that of other Whigs, found himself absorbing some of them as well. And some of the Jacksonian spirit resided inside the Lincoln White House. William C. Harris found that Lincoln's \"reverence for the Founding Fathers, the Constitution, the laws under it, and the preservation of the Republic and its institutions strengthened his conservatism.\"[381] James G. Randall emphasizes his tolerance and moderation \"in his preference for orderly progress, his distrust of dangerous agitation, and his reluctance toward ill digested schemes of reform.\" Randall concludes that \"he was conservative in his complete avoidance of that type of so-called 'radicalism' which involved abuse of the South, hatred for the slaveholder, thirst for vengeance, partisan plotting, and ungenerous demands that Southern institutions be transformed overnight by outsiders.\"[382] In Lincoln's first inaugural address, he explored the nature of democracy. He denounced secession as anarchy, and he explained that majority rule had to be balanced by constitutional restraints. He said, \"A majority held in restraint by constitutional checks and limitations, and always changing easily with deliberate changes of popular opinions and sentiments, is the only true sovereign of a free people.\"[383] The successful reunification of the states had consequences for how people viewed the country. The term \"the United States\" has historically been used sometimes in the plural (\"these United States\") and other times in the singular. The Civil War was a significant force in the eventual dominance of the singular usage by the end of the 19th century.[384] In his company, I was never reminded of my humble origin, or of my unpopular color.[385] In surveys of U.S. scholars ranking presidents conducted since 1948, the top three presidents are generally Lincoln, Washington, and Franklin Delano Roosevelt, although the order varies.[386][o] Between 1999 and 2011, Lincoln, John F. Kennedy, and Ronald Reagan were the top-ranked presidents in eight public opinion surveys, according to Gallup.[388] A 2004 study found that scholars in the fields of history and politics ranked Lincoln number one, while legal scholars placed him second after George Washington.[389] Lincoln's assassination left him a national martyr. He was viewed by abolitionists as a champion of human liberty. Republicans linked Lincoln's name to their party. Many, though not all, in the South considered Lincoln as a man of outstanding ability.[390] Historians have said he was \"a classical liberal\" in the 19th-century sense. Allen C. Guelzo states that Lincoln was a \"classical liberal democratâan enemy of artificial hierarchy, a friend to trade and business as ennobling and enabling, and an American counterpart to Mill, Cobden, and Bright\", whose portrait Lincoln hung in his White House office.[391][392] Sociologist Barry Schwartz argues that Lincoln's American reputation grew slowly from the late 19th century until the Progressive Era (1900â1920s), when he emerged as one of America's most venerated heroes, even among white Southerners. The high point came in 1922 with the dedication of the Lincoln Memorial on the National Mall in Washington, D.C.[393] Union nationalism, as envisioned by Lincoln, \"helped lead America to the nationalism of Theodore Roosevelt, Woodrow Wilson, and Franklin Delano Roosevelt.\"[394] In the New Deal era, liberals honored Lincoln not so much as the self-made man or the great war president, but as the advocate of the common man who they claimed would have supported the welfare state.[395] Schwartz argues that in the 1930s and 1940s the memory of Abraham Lincoln was practically sacred and provided the nation with \"a moral symbol inspiring and guiding American life.\" During the Great Depression, he argues, Lincoln served \"as a means for seeing the world's disappointments, for making its sufferings not so much explicable as meaningful.\" Franklin D. Roosevelt, preparing America for war, used the words of the Civil War president to clarify the threat posed by Germany and Japan. Americans asked, \"What would Lincoln do?\"[396] However, Schwartz also finds that since World War II Lincoln's symbolic power has lost relevance, and this \"fading hero is symptomatic of fading confidence in national greatness.\" He suggested that postmodernism and multiculturalism have diluted greatness as a concept.[397] In the Cold War years Lincoln's image shifted to a symbol of freedom who brought hope to those oppressed by Communist regimes.[395] He had long been known as the Great Emancipator,[398] but, by the late 1960s, some African American intellectuals, led by Lerone Bennett Jr., denied that Lincoln deserved that title.[399][400] Bennett won wide attention when he called Lincoln a white supremacist in 1968.[401] He noted that Lincoln used ethnic slurs and told jokes that ridiculed blacks. Bennett argued that Lincoln opposed social equality and proposed that freed slaves voluntarily move to another country. The emphasis shifted away from Lincoln the emancipator to an argument that blacks had freed themselves from slavery, or at least were responsible for pressuring the government to emancipate them.[402] Defenders of Lincoln retorted that he was a \"moral visionary\" who deftly advanced the abolitionist cause, as fast as politically possible.[403] Brian Dirck stated that few Civil War scholars take Bennett (or Thomas DiLorenzo)[404] seriously, pointing to their \"narrow political agendas and faulty research\".[405] By the 1970s Lincoln had become a hero to political conservatives[406]âapart from neo-Confederates such as Mel Bradford, who denounced his treatment of the white Southâfor his intense nationalism, his support for business, his insistence on stopping the spread of slavery, his acting on Lockean and Burkean principles on behalf of both liberty and tradition, and his devotion to the principles of the Founding Fathers.[407] Lincoln became a favorite of liberal intellectuals across the world.[408] Barry Schwartz wrote in 2009 that Lincoln's image suffered \"erosion, fading prestige, benign ridicule\" in the late 20th century.[409] By contrast, David Herbert Donald opined in his 1996 biography that Lincoln was distinctly endowed with the personality trait of negative capability, defined by the poet John Keats and attributed to extraordinary leaders who were \"capable of being in uncertainties, Mysteries, doubts, without any irritable reaching after fact and reason\".[410] In the 21st century President Barack Obama named Lincoln his favorite president and insisted on using the Lincoln Bible for his inaugural ceremonies.[411][412][413] Lincoln has often been portrayed by Hollywood, almost always in a flattering light.[414][415] Lincoln has also been admired by political figures outside the U.S., including German political theorist Karl Marx,[416] Indian independence leader Mahatma Gandhi,[417] former Liberian president Ellen Johnson Sirleaf,[418] leader of the Italian Risorgimento, Giuseppe Garibaldi,[419] and Libyan revolutionary Muammar Gaddafi.[420] Lincoln's portrait appears on two denominations of United States currency, the penny and the $5 bill. He appears on postage stamps across the world.[421][422] While he is usually portrayed bearded, he did not grow a beard until 1860 at the suggestion of 11-year-old Grace Bedell. He was the first of five presidents to do so.[423] He has been memorialized in many town, city, and county names,[424] including the capital of Nebraska.[425] The United States Navy Nimitz-class aircraft carrier USS Abraham Lincoln (CVN-72) is named after Lincoln, the second Navy ship to bear his name.[426] The Lincoln Memorial is one of the most visited monuments in the nation's capital[427] and is one of the most visited National Park Service sites in the country.[428] Ford's Theatre, among the most visited sites in Washington, D.C.,[428] is across the street from Petersen House, where Lincoln died.[429] Memorials in Springfield, Illinois, include the Abraham Lincoln Presidential Library and Museum, Lincoln's home, and his tomb.[430] A portrait carving of Lincoln appears with those of three other presidents on Mount Rushmore, which receives about 3 million visitors a year.[431] An influential statue of Lincoln stands in Lincoln Park, Chicago, with recastings given as diplomatic gifts standing in Parliament Square, London, and Parque Lincoln, Mexico City.[432][433][434] In 2019, Congress officially dedicated room H-226 in the United States Capitol to Abraham Lincoln.[435] The room is located off National Statuary Hall and served as the post office of the House while then-Representative Abraham Lincoln served in Congress from 1847 to 1849.[436][437]",

                "content": "Abraham Lincoln, sixteenth President of the United States, was born near Hodgenville, Kentucky on February 12, 1809. His family moved to Indiana when he was seven and he grew up on the edge of the frontier. He had very little formal education, but read voraciously when not working on his fatherâs farm. A childhood friend later recalled Lincoln's \"manic\" intellect, and the sight of him red-eyed and tousle-haired as he pored over books late into the night. In 1828, at the age of nineteen, he accompanied a produce-laden flatboat down the Mississippi River to New Orleans, Louisianaâhis first visit to a large city--and then walked back home. Two years later, trying to avoid health and finance troubles, Lincoln's father moved the family moved to Illinois. After moving away from home, Lincoln co-owned a general store for several years before selling his stake and enlisting as a militia captain defending Illinois in the Black Hawk War of 1832. Black Hawk, a Sauk chief, believed he had been swindled by a recent land deal and sought to resettle his old holdings. Lincoln did not see direct combat during the short conflict, but the sight of corpse-strewn battlefields at Stillman's Run and Kellogg's Grove deeply affected him. As a captain, he developed a reputation for pragmatism and integrity. Once, faced with a rail fence during practice maneuvers and forgetting the parade-ground instructions to direct his men over it, he simply ordered them to fall out and reassemble on the other side a minute later. Another time, he stopped his men before they executed a wandering Native American as a spy. Stepping in front of their raised muskets, Lincoln is said to have challenged his men to combat for the terrified native's life. His men stood down. After the war, he studied law and campaigned for a seat on the Illinois State Legislature. Although not elected in his first attempt, Lincoln persevered and won the position in 1834, serving as a Whig. Abraham Lincoln met Mary Todd in Springfield, Illinois where he was practicing as a lawyer. They were married in 1842 over her familyâs objections and had four sons. Only one lived to adulthood. The deep melancholy that pervaded the Lincoln family, with occasional detours into outright madness, is in some ways sourced in their close relationship with death. Lincoln, a self-described \"prairie lawyer,\" focused on his all-embracing law practice in the early 1850s after one term in Congress from 1847 to 1849. He joined the new Republican partyâand the ongoing argument over sectionalismâin 1856. A series of heated debates in 1858 with Stephen A. Douglas, the sponsor of the 1854 Kansas-Nebraska Act, over slavery and its place in the United States forged Lincoln into a prominent figure in national politics. Lincolnâs anti-slavery platform made him extremely unpopular with Southerners and his nomination for President in 1860 enraged them. On November 6, 1860, Lincoln won the presidential election without the support of a single Southern state. Talk of secession, bandied about since the 1830s, took on a serious new tone. The Civil War was not entirely caused by Lincolnâs election, but the election was one of the primary reasons the war broke out the following year. Lincolnâs decision to fight rather than to let the Southern states secede was not based on his feelings towards slavery. Rather, he felt it was his sacred duty as President of the United States to preserve the Union at all costs. His first inaugural address was an appeal to the rebellious states, seven of which had already seceded, to rejoin the nation. His first draft of the speech ended with an ominous message: \"Shall it be peace, or the sword?\" The Civil War began with the Confederate bombardment of Fort Sumter, South Carolina, on April 12, 1861. Fort Sumter, situated in the Charleston Harbour, was a Union outpost in the newly seceded Confederate territory. Lincoln, learning that the Fort was running low on food, sent supplies to reinforce the soldiers there. The Southern navy repulsed the supply convoy. After this repulse, the Southern navy fired the first shot of the war at Fort Sumter and the Federal defenders surrendered after a 34-hour long battle. Throughout the war, Lincoln struggled to find capable generals for his armies. As commander-in-chief, he legally held the highest rank in the United States armed forces, and he diligently exercised his authority through strategic planning, weapons testing, and the promotion and demotion of officers. McDowell, Fremont, McClellan, Pope, McClellan again, Buell, Burnside, Rosecrans--all of these men and more withered under Lincoln's watchful eye as they failed to bring him success on the battlefield. He did not issue his famous Emancipation Proclamation until January 1, 1863 after the Union victory at the Battle of Antietam. The Emancipation Proclamation, which was legally based on the Presidentâs right to seize the property of those in rebellion against the State, only freed slaves in Southern states where Lincolnâs forces had no control. Nevertheless, it changed the tenor of the war, making it, from the Northern point of view, a fight both to preserve the Union and to end slavery. In 1864, Lincoln ran again for President. After years of war, he feared he would not win. Only in the final months of the campaign did the exertions of Ulysses S. Grant, the quiet general now in command of all of the Union armies, begin to bear fruit. A string of heartening victories buoyed Lincoln's ticket and contributed significantly to his re-election. In his second inauguration speech, March 4, 1865, he set the tone he intended to take when the war finally ended. His one goal, he said, was âlasting peace among ourselves.â He called for âmalice towards noneâ and âcharity for all.â The war ended only a month later. The Lincoln administration did more than just manage the Civil War, although its reverberations could still be felt in a number of policies. The Revenue Act of 1862 established the United States' first income tax, largely to pay the costs of total war. The Morrill Act of 1862 established the basis of the state university system in this country, while the Homestead Act, also passed in 1862, encouraged settlement of the West by offering 160 acres of free land to settlers. Lincoln also created the Department of Agriculture and formally instituted the Thanksgiving holiday. Internationally, he navigated the \"Trent Affair,\" a diplomatic crisis regarding the seizure of a British ship carrying Confederate envoys, in such a way as to quell the saber-rattling overtures coming from Britain as well as the United States. In another spill-over from the war, Lincoln restricted the civil liberties of due process and freedom of the press. On April 14, 1865, while attending a play at Fordâs Theatre in Washington, D.C., Abraham Lincoln was shot by Confederate sympathizer, John Wilkes Booth. The assassination was part of a larger plot to eliminate the Northern government that also left Secretary of State William Seward grievously injured. Lincoln died the following day, and with him the hope of reconstructing the nation without bitterness. The American Battlefield Trust and our members have saved more than 58,000 acres in 25 states!

                "content": "British Broadcasting CorporationHome Accessibility links History Abraham Lincoln Â© Lincoln was the 16th president of the United States and one of the great American leaders. His presidency was dominated by the American Civil War. Abraham Lincoln was born on 12 February 1809 near Hodgenville, Kentucky. He was brought up in Kentucky, Indiana and Illinois. His parents were poor pioneers and Lincoln was largely self-educated. In 1836, he qualified as a lawyer and went to work in a law practice in Springfield, Illinois. He sat in the state legislature from 1834 to 1842 and in 1846 was elected to Congress, representing the Whig Party for a term. In 1856, he joined the new Republican Party and in 1860 he was asked to run as their presidential candidate. In the presidential campaign, Lincoln made his opposition to slavery very clear. His victory provoked a crisis, with many southerners fearing that he would attempt to abolish slavery in the South. Seven southern states left the Union to form the Confederate States of America, also known as the Confederacy. Four more joined later. Lincoln vowed to preserve the Union even if it meant war. Fighting broke out in April 1861. Lincoln always defined the Civil War as a struggle to save the Union, but in January 1863 he nonetheless issued the Emancipation Proclamation, which freed all slaves in areas still under Confederate control. This was an important symbolic gesture that identified the Union's struggle as a war to end slavery. In the effort to win the war, Lincoln assumed more power than any president before him, declaring martial law and suspending legal rights. He had difficulty finding effective generals to lead the Union armies until the appointment of Ulysses S Grant as overall commander in 1864. On 19 November 1863, Lincoln delivered his famous Gettysburg Address at the dedication of a cemetery at the site of the Battle of Gettysburg, a decisive Union victory that had taken place earlier in the year. In 1864, Lincoln stood for re-election and won. In his second inaugural address, he was conciliatory towards the southern states. On 9 April 1865, the Confederate general Robert E Lee surrendered, effectively ending the war. It had lasted for more than four years and 600,000 Americans had died. Less than a week later, Lincoln was shot while attending a performance at Ford's Theatre in Washington DC and died the next morning, 15 April 1865. His assassin, John Wilkes Booth, was a strong supporter of the Confederacy. Search term: BBC Â© 2014 The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites. Read more.

                "content": "Jonathan Givony breaks down the expectations for Cooper Flagg's freshman season at Duke. (1:09) IN THE FOURTH row of bleachers inside a gymnasium on the UNLV campus, Duke men's basketball officials -- including coach Jon Scheyer -- are struggling to contain their excitement. In the row just ahead of them, Kelly and Ralph Flagg look on in awe as their 17-year-old son Cooper is dominating a scrimmage against the best basketball players in the world. It's July 8, and 6-foot-9 Cooper Flagg is playing for the USA Select Team, a squad of mostly NBA players who, in the spirit of tradition, serve as a training camp appetizer for Team USA before the Olympics. But Flagg is not an NBA player. He is the first collegiate player in a decade to join the select team, but he isn't a collegiate player either -- not yet anyway. Flagg is four months removed from leading the Florida-based Montverde Academy boys' basketball team to its eighth national championship, and he is four months away from his debut at Duke University. In this interregnum, Flagg is five years younger than Team USA's youngest player, Minnesota star guard Anthony Edwards, and he is four years younger than LeBron James' NBA career (21). And he is playing against them both, along with Stephen Curry, Anthony Davis and a who's who of NBA stars who, a month later, will claim a gold medal at the Paris Olympics. For now, Team USA is caught in the fourth quarter of a neck-and-neck scrimmage against the select team, led by Flagg, who, quite simply, is putting on a show. He drills a corner 3 against a closing Davis, who hangs his head in frustration. He sinks a turnaround jumper over Boston's Jrue Holiday, one of the game's best defenders. He crosses over Davis and swishes a side-step 3-pointer from the right wing, igniting a sequence that's about to burn lava-hot across social media. After the swish, Team USA turns the ball over, and Flagg finds a teammate for an open 3-pointer. As the shot goes up, Flagg anticipates the miss, sprints toward the rim, leaps and finishes the midair putback while being fouled by Bam Adebayo, giving his team a 69-68 lead with two minutes left. He has six points in 20 seconds. On the sideline, his USA Select teammates erupt from their seats. Around the gym, media, NBA officials and Team USA officials collectively turn to the person next to them to reaffirm that what they're seeing isn't a mirage. Team USA holds on to win by one, and Flagg finishes with 17 points on 6-of-10 shooting, including 2-of-3 from 3-point range, plus 2 rebounds, 2 assists, 2 steals and 1 turnover. James taps Flagg on the butt while a medical official tends to a Z-shaped gash in Flagg's right arm. \"He looks like a hell of a player,\" Suns star Kevin Durant, who missed the scrimmage because of a calf injury, said afterward. \"He's 17 years old coming in here playing like a [veteran] almost. No emotion. Just going out there and doing his job. That's a good sign.\" Team USA officials grow even more excited about the prospect of Flagg being a foundational piece of their future. \"He checks so many boxes, it's scary,\" Sean Ford, the USA men's national team director, told ESPN. Flagg is projected as the No. 1 pick in the 2025 draft, but one Western Conference scout told ESPN, \"He would have been the first pick in the 2024 draft as well.\" After the scrimmage, Flagg is mobbed by reporters. He says it's an honor to play against Team USA. He calls them incredible talents. \"They were just playing good team basketball, playing the right way, moving the ball and just picking their spots,\" Flagg says, a simple quote that, in reality, serves as a window into ideals that are marrow-deep for him. Before the scrimmage, Kelly, Ralph and Matt MacKenzie, Cooper's trainer, weren't sure how Cooper would play. They did know he had long excelled against players far older. As a third grader, he faced sixth graders. As a sixth grader, he faced former college players. As an eighth grader, he faced current college players. He received his first college scholarship offer before entering high school. He dominated across Maine, then New England, then along the East Coast, then nationally, then even for the USA junior national team in Spain. But as word spread, it was often met with skepticism. Only one Maine-born player had ever been drafted into the NBA -- and that was in 1984. A white American player hasn't been drafted first overall since Kent Benson in 1977. The superlative ways in which Flagg's game is described, even by him and those closest to him, matches a long-held trope of white NBA players -- that he \"plays the right way,\" \"makes the right play,\" \"plays the team game.\" In conversations with people across the basketball landscape, including with talent evaluators at the highest level of the game, it's clear Flagg's game transcends those characterizations. Still, disbelief over his rise has followed Flagg, about his age, his race, the small town he's from. At every stop -- private trainers, legendary coaches, scrimmages, national tournaments -- he has faced test after test against older players, bigger players, all designed to define a ceiling, a future, whether he belonged. For the past decade, he has passed them all, consistently turning skepticism into awe -- fueled by lessons from one of the greatest NBA teams of all time. \"There's disbelief about him because he's just that good,\" one Western Conference executive said. Back in Las Vegas, as Kelly, Ralph and Matt MacKenzie leave UNLV, with Cooper Flagg trending nationally across social media, they know something has changed: that there has been a collective realization about how good their son really is. \"We have lived by the philosophy that if you're the best player in the gym, you got to find a new gym,\" Kelly Flagg told ESPN. Then, they laugh. For as surreal as it all seems, it also feels normal. \"It's been this way,\" Kelly said, \"his entire life.\" ON A LATE October morning, Earl Anderson idles in his pickup truck outside a two-story home in Newport, Maine. Autumn has painted the lawn with a coat of sunset-colored leaves that shimmer from an overnight rain. The home is a light brown, wood-framed farmhouse, with a two-car garage and a curving, paved driveway, where a metal pole rises from the earth on one side. Atop the stand, for years, stood a backboard and a rim, but they are gone. \"I wonder what happened to them,\" Anderson says. He shrugs. This, he says, is where Flagg grew up. Then Anderson drives the 3.1 miles up a thoroughfare known as \"Moosehead Trail\" toward Nokomis Regional High School, where he coached Flagg his freshman season. Students fill the hallway as Anderson enters the gymnasium. On a far wall, a state championship banner from that season is displayed; not far from it, another banner honors Flagg being named the Maine Gatorade Player of the Year. In a trophy case outside, the Gold Ball that the team won shimmers under the light, next to the game ball from the title-clinching game. \"I had never seen anyone like that,\" Anderson said, \"including in college basketball. And he was only 15.\"Editor's Picks'He's a basketball savant': Cooper Flagg could thrive early at Duke -- but there's a catch71dJonathan Givony10 college teams with the most NBA-level talent?

Newport is small enough that Kelly likes to joke that you could blink and miss it. \"It's a place for people who are on their way to somewhere else,\" Anderson said. In a house 3 miles away from the one where she would one day raise Flagg, Kelly fell in love with the game. She was 7, and shot on a backyard basket affixed to a shed by her father, Dan Bowman, who rebounded for her; they played so often that the backyard grass faded into dirt, and he'd park a car nearby and turn on the headlights so they could play into the night. Dan was a multisport athlete who played baseball, soccer and was a 6-foot-3 sharpshooter in basketball. And when he wanted to instill deeper lessons about the game, he turned to the Boston Celtics. Dan grew up a die-hard, and the family spent Sundays in the 1980s crowded around the living room box-set television, turning down the volume and turning up the radio so they could hear Celtics broadcaster Johnny Most narrate the action. \"Those are my first memories,\" Kelly said. A life-size poster of Larry Bird hung in the family kitchen. She developed an up-and-under move like Kevin McHale. And the 1985-86 team: six future Hall of Famers in Bird, McHale, Robert Parish, Dennis Johnson, reserve Bill Walton (the NBA Sixth Man of the Year that season) and head coach K.C. Jones, who had won eight titles with the team as a guard during Bill Russell's heydey. Those Celtics finished 50-1 at home -- 10-0 during the playoffs and an NBA-record 40-1 during the regular season. They posted a 67-15 record and crushed Houston for the Celtics' 16th NBA title. They were 19-2 against teams with 50 or more wins and had a 20.3 average scoring margin in series-clinching games. Bird won his third straight MVP and second Finals MVP. Kelly was spellbound. They led the NBA in rebounding and 3-point field-goal percentage and ranked second in field goal percentage and assists. YouTube clips are devoted to their passing prowess -- the ball rarely hitting the floor, players constantly giving up good shots for great shots. \"That was the most pure form of the game in my mind,\" Kelly said. And it framed her worldview about how to play it. Like her father, she attended Nokomis, where she became one of the state's best players. She then starred at the University of Maine, which upset Stanford in the 1999 NCAA tournament during her senior season. After college, the 5-foot-10 Kelly walked into a block-shaped armory built in 1941 and spotted Ralph Flagg, who was a few years older, 6-9 and, Kelly thought, rather cute. He, too, had attended Nokomis before going on to play at Eastern Maine Community College. Soon after, they started dating. When they played against each other, he couldn't stop her up-and-under move. \"She was pretty deadly with that,\" Ralph said. \"And a fierce competitor.\" As a wedding present, they received a flowering crabapple tree, and they planted it right next to the driveway, where they soon erected a basketball hoop. They started a family -- all boys, first Hunter, then twins, Ace and Cooper. Kelly coached the Nokomis varsity girls team, and her boys grew up in the gym. At 5 years old, Flagg and Ace -- each about a foot taller than other boys their age -- executed basketball drills. When Flagg was in second grade, Kelly and Ralph petitioned for Flagg to play on a recreation team in Newport, and he joined, soon playing against third and fourth graders. In his first game, Kelly recalled, Flagg scored more than 20 points and grabbed more than 15 rebounds. He soon started playing against fifth and sixth graders. In third grade, just before Christmas, Kelly and Ralph bought DVDs of the 1985-86 Celtics. Flagg would lie on the living room floor in front of the TV and watch the games on a loop, one full game after another. They later saw him looking up YouTube highlights, and they bought more DVDs -- on Larry Bird, on Bird versus Magic Johnson. \"Did we want that to influence the way my kids learned the game and saw the game?\" Kelly asked. \"Absolutely.\" Kelly and Ralph would point out how Bird was the star and could score whenever he wanted, but look how he dove for loose balls, set concrete screens, found open teammates. Flagg would nod along, playing the DVDs one after another, hour after hour. SOME SEVEN YEARS ago, Andy Bedard stepped inside the YMCA gym in New Gloucester, Maine. Bedard was Maine basketball royalty, leading his high school to a state title, then playing at Boston College and the University of Maine. He knew Kelly, and she had told him Flagg was developing fast. Bedard, who was putting together a traveling team in Portland, Maine, decided to see for himself. Inside the gym, Bedard was struck by how advanced the 10-year-old Flagg seemed -- how he could put spin on the ball when executing a layup so it bounced off the backboard just so, or how he'd add some spin on a bounce pass to slow the ball down so a teammate could catch up. There were little nuances that seemed advanced for a fourth grader. By then, Flagg was playing all the time.Get your favorite live sports, stories and originals with ESPN+, Disney+ and Hulu.

In the winters, Ralph snowblowed the driveway or Flagg shoveled it himself. Kelly and Ralph watched from a window as Hunter, Flagg and Ace played, giving it 30 minutes -- tops -- before one of them punted the ball and charged into the house, slamming the door, furious. \"Someone was always bleeding,\" Kelly said. Flagg and his mom played one-on-one in the driveway, and she dominated. \"She never let him win,\" said Camryn King, a childhood friend. As Flagg grew older, she struggled to beat him. \"The last time we played was fifth grade,\" Flagg said, \"and it was the first time I was up -- 7-6 -- and then she tore a meniscus in the driveway, so then we never got to play again.\" Kelly is proud that she still boasts an undefeated record against her son, but she could see the same fire burning within him. \"He gets that from me,\" she said. Bedard started coaching Flagg, and, soon, they were playing teams across New England. Bedard coached, Kelly served as an assistant coach, and they both agreed on their philosophy: They would preach team basketball. \"The backbone of who we were, our identity and how we played, came from that,\" Bedard said. Soon, Ralph and Kelly were driving their boys an hour-and-a-half to Portland, Maine, for practices several days a week. Flagg would lie down in the backseat, his face cupped in his hands, watching those Celtics DVDs. \"That was our go-to watch the entire drive,\" Ace said. By sixth grade, Kelly, believing Flagg needed more advanced training, reached out to Matt MacKenzie, a former wing at Husson University in Bangor who had become a private trainer. At his Bangor half-court gym, MacKenzie began working with Flagg three times a week, showing him footwork drills, how to play through contact, how to play between the mid-post to the 3-point line. But MacKenzie soon realized Flagg already knew most of those concepts. \"He was much further along than high school players, even college players,\" MacKenzie said. He was 11 years old. FLAGG WAS RETURNING to the gym night after night to shoot 500 additional shots. MacKenzie knew another test was needed. So he reached out to a friend, Ja'ShontÃ© Wright-McLeish, a 6-4 sophomore guard at the University of Maine. MacKenzie told him he had a young player -- a 6-foot-6 eighth grader -- whom he wanted him to play. Wright-McLeish was skeptical, but he figured he'd help MacKenzie as a favor. MacKenzie provided a directive: Don't take it easy on the kid. Go hard. Be physical. Bully him. In their first game, Wright-McLeish did just that. He stripped the ball. He blocked Flagg's shot. He initiated contact. \"I played a little dirty,\" Wright-McLeish told ESPN. Flagg departed the Bangor gym, fuming. \"He came back a couple days later,\" MacKenzie said, \"and he looked at me and he goes, 'That's never going to happen again.'\" Flagg and Wright-McLeish faced off again -- and it wasn't close. \"He was very mature and willing to learn,\" Wright McLeish said of his first impression of Flagg. \"Also, that for his age, he has the size and length to be a problem wherever he goes in the future.\" Soon after, in the fall before Flagg began his freshman year of high school, MacKenzie called a former NBA player he knew, Brian Scalabrine, a 6-9 forward who played 11 seasons in the league and won a 2008 title with the Celtics. They talked regularly about young players in the area. Scalabrine had begun coaching his own kids and was tied into the hoops scene in Boston. There, Scalabrine ran an intense pickup game, featuring local AAU players and others who were about to join the college ranks. It was a \"nasty\" environment, Scalabrine said. Physical play. Tons of trash-talking. Scalabrine had been retired from the league for several years, but he still played, too. MacKenzie told Scalabrine about Flagg, who, at 13 years old, was now getting the upper hand of college players in local workouts. Scalabrine was skeptical. He knew trainers often talked up the players they worked with. \"Get the f--- out of here,\" Scalabrine said. \"Ain't no way.\" But he liked MacKenzie and thought he was a straight shooter. \"Bring him down here,\" Scalabrine said. \"I'll get him into the gym to play against some of Boston's best.\" IN THE BOSTON gym, Scalabrine warned his players about a 13-year-old coming in from Maine. \"He's going to destroy you guys,\" Scalabrine boomed. Flagg walked in the gym after a four-hour drive, and on the game's first play, found himself trapped with the ball at the free throw line, a defender draped over him. He pump-faked, threw the ball toward the backboard, took two steps, jumped, caught the ball and thundered a dunk with his left hand. The gym fell silent. \"I got something for your ass today!\" Scalabrine screamed at his charges. It was just one play, but it piqued the curiosity of the other players of what more he could do. Scalabrine felt the same. And Flagg soon showed them. In one instance, he threw a 75-foot crosscourt seam pass to the opposite corner that arrived at the exact same time as his teammate's feet. Scalabrine laughed. His pass timing, Scalabrine later said, reminded him of LeBron James. Scalabrine ran Flagg through the \"eight-second game\" -- a full-court game with eight seconds on the shot clock. It is a grueling exercise, forcing players to make quick decisions with little time. On a good day, a player's team might win a game or two. But Flagg won again and again. \"He ... f---ing ... dominated,\" Scalabrine said, emphasizing each word. They spent two hours in the gym that night, and Scalabrine told Flagg he was going to be in the NBA. He believed he'd play in the league for 10 years. Would he be a Hall of Famer? An All-Star? \"That's up to you and how hard you want to work,\" Scalabrine told him. \"But I know for a fact that you're an NBA player.\" Despite his age, Scalabrine -- mirroring Flagg's coaches through the years -- noticed Flagg's advanced timing on blocking shots, how he'd disrupt passing lanes, how he possessed a rapid first and second jump for rebounds. On offense, he saw his deft passing and his versatile ability to score from midrange and around the rim. At 13, he'd established a rare two-way game. Sources across the basketball world began to agree, despite a narrative that persists about white players and the stereotypes around their play and attributes -- that they make up for a perceived lack of athletic ability in other ways. Flagg would prove this long-standing trope to be shallow and inaccurate, one Eastern Conference executive said. \"It's an interesting narrative because it will inevitably be racially tinged. 'This is the great white hope that knows how to play the right way, and all these other Black players are playing selfishly,'\" the exec said about how Flagg's coverage might play out in the media. \"I know there will be commentary on that.\" \"Europeans are white and they've been balling for years,\" said another Western Conference executive. \"I guess it's just we haven't seen an American-born white dude projected this high in a while. Chet [Holmgren] is pretty damn good, though. He's probably the best American-born white dude in the league at the moment. I don't recall it ever getting brought up much with him, for what it's worth -- and he had some buzz going No. 1. Just not as much as Cooper.\" The exec continued, calling Flagg a \"fantastic talent\" and said he conjures thoughts of Kevin Garnett and Anthony Davis with his ability to block shots and switch on defense. Flagg, he said, would instantly become one of the best two-way players in the NBA. \"He does have very good handles for a power forward,\" the executive said. \"Good footwork, and he plays his ass off. There's no question he's going to be a good player in the NBA, but the question is how good.\" Said another Eastern Conference executive, \"I have heard very little doubt about the kid. Everyone around Cooper has raved about him for three years.\" Months later, Scalabrine ran Flagg through a drill that Dallas Mavericks star guard Kyrie Irving employs at the end of workouts -- often known as the \"Kyrie finishing drill.\" Irving completes a series of challenging acrobatic shots around the rim from different angles, jumping off one foot, or the other, or both, aiming high and low off the backboard, spinning the ball in different ways. The drill helps explain why Irving is such a master around the basket, able to finish in traffic and off either foot and with either hand. But it is an exhausting drill, requiring about 120 made shots in a short amount of time. The first time Flagg tried it, he completed it in about five minutes. The next time, Scalabrine believed Flagg could complete it in just under five minutes. He completed the drill in 2 minutes and 17 seconds. \"His learning curve is like nothing I've ever seen before,\" Scalabrine said. \"Now, I haven't been around every single high school player growing up, but I'm telling you -- there's not a challenge that he's not going to be able to overcome.\" Scalabrine called Ford, the USA men's national team director. \"Sean, I'm just telling you,\" Scalabrine said. \"We don't know each other, but he's a unicorn.\" Ford has taken these types of calls over the years. Sometimes they pan out, like the time he got a call about a teenager named LeBron James. But in many instances, they don't. Ford listened and did a quick search on his phone. Flagg seemed legitimate, but he was so young, 13 years old. Ford reached Kelly and said that Team USA would have a minicamp for the junior national team in the spring of 2022 and that maybe there would be an opportunity for Flagg to attend. Ford knew Maine wasn't necessarily a hotbed for basketball talent. But Scalabrine seemed so sure, so emphatic. Still, Ford wondered, how good was Cooper Flagg, really? AS ANDERSON DRIVES through Newport, he looks ahead and reveals what basketball means to his state. \"It's what binds these communities together,\" he says. When people think of Maine, he said, they don't think of basketball; they think of hockey. But not every school has an ice rink. They're expensive, require extensive upkeep. Basketball, on the contrary, is cheap. All you need is a ball, a hoop and some sneakers. And when winter in Maine rolls around, and people are isolated, one of the few ways they can form a sense of community is to gather in a heated gym and watch their kids play. Regional high schools are fed by nearby local towns -- Nokomis Regional High School is fed by eight others -- and when the state tournament rolls around and teams vie for a chance at the coveted Gold Ball, the towns travel en masse to watch their teams play; the last one to leave being expected to turn out the lights, as the saying goes. Locals compare it to Hoosier Hysteria in Indiana, only without the hype. For as beloved as basketball is, the state hasn't produced a ton of top-tier talent. It's been 40 years since the Nets drafted Maine-born Jeff Turner 17th overall in 1984.Top stories of the week from Get exclusive access to thousands of premium articles a year from top writers. â¢ Ways to fix 15 NBA contenders' roster holes Â» â¢ Ranking all 30 MLB teams' temperatures Â» â¢ Titans are on the clock!

Updated mock Â» More ESPN+ content Â» When Flagg joined 650-student Nokomis for his freshman year, his legend in the area was well known, and his new teammates -- including his older brother, Hunter -- were eager to have him and Ace aboard after struggling for several years. \"He was playing with a bunch of seniors, and you could clearly tell that he was the player they looked up to,\" Anderson said. Anderson, the coach, had known the family for years. He'd watched Kelly's father, Dan, play. He'd watched Kelly play. He had heard about Flagg, but he'd never seen him in person -- until November practices began. There were times when Anderson would watch him and think of Larry Bird. It was a touchy subject for people who had grown up with those Celtics teams, who worshiped Bird, and who were loath to bestow such praise on anyone else. But he was the player they often came back to, and Anderson saw parallels in their story. Bird's hometown of French Lick, Indiana, was small; so was Newport. They were both 6-9. They impacted the game on both ends. They're obviously both white. Flagg had a Fathead poster of Bird in his living room, which had been painted green and white. People knew of Flagg's appreciation of Bird, and Ralph would hear snickers on social media from people saying, \"Oh, Flagg never saw Larry Bird play.\" It made Ralph laugh. \"That's all we watched -- constantly,\" he said. Before the season, Kelly had told Anderson that the hype around her son was growing, and that the attention would be high. Anderson soon saw it himself. Every gym they played in was packed. Lines formed around the block for autographs. Newspapers published feature stories. College coaches -- including UCLA -- rang Anderson with interest. Nokomis rolled to a 21-1 record. Flagg averaged 20.5 points, 10.0 rebounds, 6.2 assists, 3.7 steals and 3.7 blocks. In the state championship game in March 2022, he scored 22 points and grabbed 16 rebounds in a 43-27 win and raised the Gold Ball afterward. He became the first freshman to be named the Maine Gatorade Player of the Year. The following month, Flagg traveled to New Orleans for USA Basketball men's junior national team's three-day minicamp in New Orleans. The team met in the Pelicans' practice facility, and Ford looked on, curious about Flagg, who was the youngest player there. Bedard was present for the minicamp too. There were 46 players in the gym. Bedard reported back to Kelly, Ralph and MacKenzie after the first day that Flagg was the best one there. Ford agreed. Flagg was selected as one of 12 players to represent Team USA at the 2022 FIBA U17 Basketball World Cup in Spain in July 2022. Again he dominated, averaging 9.3 points, a team-high 10 rebounds, 2.9 blocks and 2.4 steals. In the gold-medal-clinching game, he tallied 10 points, 17 rebounds, eight steals and four blocks. \"He was so, so good,\" Ford said. He was named to the all-tournament team. He was 15 years old. After his freshman season, Flagg and his brother Ace made the decision to level up again, this time by transferring to Montverde, the Florida-based private prep powerhouse that has produced 11 first-round NBA draft picks in the past decade, including four in 2021. Duke commit Cooper Flagg does it all with 23 points, 10 rebounds and nine blocks in Montverde's easy win. AT MONTVERDE, FLAGG played under Kevin Boyle, who had coached a slew of future NBA players -- Kyrie Irving, Cade Cunningham, Ben Simmons -- and knew that Flagg entered Monteverde as a top prep prospect on a team flush with them. \"He's the best kid in the country, and there were a lot of times he was our third-leading scorer,\" Boyle told ESPN. In 17.8 minutes per game, Flagg averaged 9.8 points, 5.2 rebounds, three assists, a team-high 2.2 blocks and a team-high 1.6 steals in his first season. In early July 2023, Flagg traveled to North Augusta, South Carolina, and rejoined his AAU team led by Bedard and Kelly -- named Maine United -- for Nike's EYBL Peach Jam tournament. The event was held in a 120,000-square-foot facility 6 miles from the Augusta National Golf Club, with NCAA coaches in attendance, including Scheyer. Scalabrine had reached out to Scheyer after the pickup game outside Boston. \"He's as good as any high school player that I've ever seen,\" Scalabrine told him. \"I know it sounds crazy, but you've got to recruit this guy. He'd be a perfect fit for Duke.\" Scheyer had never recruited anyone from Maine. But a year later, he was watching Flagg in person. \"I remember the court, I remember where I was sitting,\" Scheyer told ESPN. \"And here's this kid, blocking everything. Some of the plays he was making at 15, it just jumped off the page at you. His instincts. His athletic ability. His skill.\" He tried to think of a comparison, but couldn't. \"He's different from anybody I've ever recruited,\" Scheyer said. On the first day of the tournament, Flagg wasn't shooting well, and an opposing coach quipped about it. After assisting on three straight plays, he looked at the opposing coach. \"I don't need to score,\" he said. \"All I need to do is win.\" His team won -- and continued to win, as Flagg, averaged 25.4 points, 13 rebounds, 5.7 assists, and 6.9 blocks in seven games. He posted triple-doubles in three straight games. In one, he tallied 38 points, 16 rebounds, 12 blocks and six assists. In another, he notched 37 points, 12 rebounds, 10 blocks and six assists. The more they won, the more the crowds swelled. LeBron James pulled Flagg aside. Carmelo Anthony attended several games. Chris Paul approached Maine United's coaches and told them how much he was loving the team's run. He'd been watching their games on his phone, he said. \"I love the way you all play,\" Paul told them. He said he was teaching his son, Chris Jr., then a middle school player, to model how he played after them. He asked if he could meet Flagg and Ace, and, of course, they obliged. It was a busy summer -- with Flagg also attending Stephen Curry's basketball camp in San Francisco and Jayson Tatum's camp in St. Louis. In August 2023, Flagg reclassified to the 2025 draft class, fast-tracking his path to the NBA. NBA talent evaluators were intrigued, noting his 7-foot wingspan, uncanny timing on blocking shots and abilities on both ends -- though some have said his shooting mechanics need work. \"He's probably going to need to improve considerably as a shooter, which, given his age, could very realistically happen,\" one Eastern Conference executive said. \"But even without progress on his shooting or individual offensive game, he will be an NBA starter and have a huge impact on winning in the league. He's a guy every team would love to have. That part is a very easy projection.\" In October 2023, Flagg announced via Slam Magazine that he would be attending Duke, choosing it over UConn. Earlier that summer, MacKenzie and Flagg had traveled to Durham, North Carolina, for a two-day unofficial visit. On campus, former Duke coach Mike Krzyzewski welcomed them into his spacious office. He showed them his Olympic gold medals and other achievements from his illustrious coaching career. They talked for about an hour, the 16-year-old Flagg remaining stoic and composed. Toward the end, Krzyzewski told him, \"The way you carry yourself is very impressive. You remind me of a player I coached on Team USA, and that's LeBron James.\" Flagg nodded politely but said little else. \"He's not somebody who gets starstruck by any means,\" MacKenzie said. \"I've never seen him in a situation where he's rattled or starstruck.\" Sitting in his office at the Eastern Maine Sports Academy, MacKenzie shows a photo of himself, Flagg and Krzyzewski from that visit. On an opposite wall hangs a framed Bird jersey and a section of the high school floor that Bird played on in French Lick. Bird had inspired MacKenzie, just as Bird had inspired Flagg. MacKenzie thinks about how Flagg is inspiring others in Maine. He is working with a 6-8 player who idolizes Flagg. \"He just turned 15,\" he said. MacKenzie walks toward the court, standing before a space that they plan to transform with mementos from Flagg's rise and whatever follows, wherever his career may lead. \"I want the kids to come and see what's possible,\" he said. He imagined the future. \"I can't wait to see what basketball looks like in Maine in 20 years.\" Cooper Flagg flexes his muscles after throwing down a one-handed slam to pad Duke's lead over Maine. A FEW DAYS later, MacKenzie stands next to Kelly and Ralph at Cameron Indoor Stadium in Durham, North Carolina, to watch Flagg play his first regular-season game as a member of the Duke Blue Devils. It's 6:15 p.m. on Nov. 4, and Flagg is warming up alongside his teammates. He looks down the court, and a wave of childhood memories comes rushing back. Duke is hosting the University of Maine. Flagg grew up making the 30-minute trek with his family to watch the Black Bears play in Bangor. He became a fan and even envisioned himself playing there. Now, he's standing on the opposite end of the court with his Blue Devils teammates, beneath banners honoring the school's iconic history and players, deep tournament runs and five national championships. Duke warms up in front of the visitors bench, and behind it, dozens of Maine fans and alumni who made the trek from Bangor to Durham stand in Black Bears shirts and sweaters and hats, snapping photos and videos of Flagg, one of their own. Flagg's twin brother, Ace, who plays at nearby Greensboro Day, a prep school, is among them; the week before, Ace committed to play basketball at Maine next season. On the opposite end of the court, two rows behind the Duke bench, Kelly wears a blue Duke sweater and seems to recognize a familiar face with every passing minute: someone from her alma mater, or someone who had traveled from Maine. She shakes as many hands and delivers as many hugs as a presidential candidate, beaming the whole time. When the game begins, she removes her sweater, revealing a T-shirt featuring Flagg's likeness. It shows an image of him in a commercial with New Balance, which signed him in August and has multiple factories in Maine. Ralph, sitting next to Kelly, wears the same shirt, as does MacKenzie, who sits beside Ralph. Maine plays tough early on but is clearly overmatched by Duke, which, along with Flagg, features two other players -- forward Kon Knueppel and center Khaman Maluach -- projected as lottery picks in the 2025 NBA draft. Flagg assists on two of Duke's first three baskets but doesn't make his first shot until finishing a driving layup with 6:25 left before halftime. A sellout crowd looks on, eager for a highlight. With 3:25 before halftime, he provides one. Flagg catches the ball on the right wing, receives a screen from a teammate, then explodes down the lane for a thunderous one-handed slam. Duke jumps out to a 17-point lead in the first half and, despite spirited runs by Maine to keep the game close, expands the margin to 29 in the second. Duke's defense defines the contest, as the Blue Devils hold Maine to 25% shooting after halftime. In his debut, Flagg finishes with 18 points, a team-high seven rebounds, a team-high five assists and three steals in nearly 30 minutes. Duke wins 96-62. In the locker room, Flagg sits in his jersey, with a Gatorade towel over his legs -- he recently became the first men's college basketball player to sign with the brand -- as reporters surround him. He is asked about impacting the game even though he shot 6-of-15 from the field. \"It's kind of just something that's always been a part of my game,\" Flagg said. \"It's just trying to impact it in a lot of different ways.\" Maine coach Chris Markwood praises the hometown son after the loss. \"It's an amazing story,\" he said. \"If you knew where he was from, how small of a town it is. ... It's a storybook thing that's going on right now. And the whole state is fully behind him, excited for him, rooting for him.\" After speaking to reporters, Flagg departs the locker room and returns to the court, still in his jersey. It's 9:30 p.m. now. The stands are empty, and arena officials have already swept and cleaned. But a crowd of 30 remains -- friends and family from Maine. There is Kelly, Ralph, Ace, MacKenzie and others who made the trip. People hug Flagg, shake hands, chat and linger. MacKenzie's 5-year-old daughter, Lennie, bounds toward him, wearing the New Balance shirt featuring Flagg's likeness, and he picks her up. She wants to race him to the baseline, she says. He happily agrees. They begin, and she takes off, full speed. As she nears the baseline, he slows down, letting her win. She throws both hands in the air and shouts in glee. They all file out of the building and into the cool night at just after 10 p.m., two hours before the start of an Election Day that Flagg can't yet vote in. Cooper Flagg describes what it was like to play against his idol, LeBron James, with Team USA. BACK IN LAS VEGAS after the scrimmage against Team USA, Flagg walks through a back entrance and sits in a conference room, still wearing his jersey. He looks at the gash on his right arm, near the elbow. \"It'll scab over in a couple days,\" he said. Online, the buzz about his performance is spreading. As he sits back in a chair, he says his versatility at his size comes from his parents not forcing him to play the center position even though he was often the tallest kid on the court. It allowed him to gain more experience on the perimeter, he says, to add more facets to his game. He thinks of his basketball belief system, and how it ties back to those principles that his parents preached, straight from those 1985-86 Celtics. \"Just watching how that team played,\" Flagg said, \"that's kind of how I try to model myself playing on every team that I've been on.\" His parents' nudging, and their efforts to point out how those Celtics played, helped shape him, he says. He doesn't say Bird was his favorite player growing up, because Bird wasn't playing then, but he does call Bird his \"favorite legend to look up to.\" Even now, he says he tries to emulate Bird. \"His vision -- it was unreal, the way he passed the ball. And then he was scoring, playing defense. He was just doing everything.\" Bird isn't the only player Flagg closely followed. He also admires Durant and, in particular, the 2017 Golden State Warriors -- another powerhouse team that moved the ball with elite efficiency and dominated en route to an NBA championship. But while numerous coaches and basketball observers continually said that how Flagg played -- how complete his game was -- seemed unique, he doesn't feel that way. \"There's players that do make all the right plays,\" Flagg said. \"Especially someone like LeBron, for example. He's the type of player that just makes all his teammates better and is making the right play.\" He also doesn't believe that style is becoming extinct. \"If you look at the Celtics this past year, I mean, prime example,\" Flagg said. \"Their biggest thing was fighting for the great shot in every possession. So I think to look at a team like that, it still is the road map. It's still the right way. Nothing will ever beat that. Playing one-on-one basketball doesn't win games. Playing as a team, for sure, does.\" He has seen the mock drafts that project him as the No. 1 pick. And when asked what that means to him, he interrupts. \"Nothing at all,\" he said. \"I mean if you look at the last 10 mock drafts, I bet only a couple of 'em have the top 10 anywhere near correct.\" Early on in life, he says, part of his motivation was to prove that Maine could produce great players, because there was always skepticism that it couldn't. \"I felt like I had something to prove and I always use that to help just keep my head down,\" he said, \"but I think I'm just trying to represent the state in a good way more than trying to prove something at this point.\" As he thinks back to his past, Flagg looks forward. He rises from his chair, exits the conference room and begins to walk down a long, crowded hallway in the Bellagio. Top stars from Team USA walk through. There's Durant. Then there's Devin Booker. Then Anthony Davis. Each time one of them rounds a corner and comes into view, a throng of people waiting behind a red velvet rope scream and shout. There are pleas for autographs, for selfies. Flagg follows the same path as those stars, but as he nears the people behind the velvet rope, it's quiet. They don't seem to know who he is -- yet.",

                "content": "Next up in 5 Example video title will go here for this video Next up in 5 Example video title will go here for this video DURHAM, N.C. â Cooper Flagg wants to keep things simple. Basketball first. Treat the extra attention and hype as an afterthought, as best he can anyway. The versatile 6-foot-9, 205-pound forward for No. 7 Duke arrived as the nationâs top recruit and heads into the season as a potential No. 1 overall NBA draft pick. Hype is churning at pedal-to-floor speed with his college debut looming. Managing that will be key in what is an all-but-certain single college season for Flagg. It wasnât that long ago that Zion Williamson captured every camera as Dukeâs freshman star. Now itâs Flaggâs turn. âAs far as hype and all that goes, thatâs something that you learn to deal with,â Flagg said. âFor me, itâs about just playing basketball.â The Blue Devils open the season Monday against Maine, Flagg's home-state program. But the buzz in Durham has rolled since Jon Scheyer won the recruiting battle with two-time reigning national champion UConn to land Flagg. The McDonald's All-American turned heads with his play against veteran NBA stars during a July scrimmage on the U.S. Olympic team. He is only the ninth freshman named to The Associated Press preseason All-American team that dates to the 1986-87 season. And earlier this week, he became the first menâs college basketball player to reach an endorsement deal with Gatorade. All before he turns 18 (in December). Scheyer, entering his third season as successor to retired Hall of Famer Mike Krzyzewski, doesnât sound worried. He commends Flagg's approach in practices and his work ethic. The 37-year-old coach has seen it in moments like arriving at the gym for a 6 a.m. workout only to find Flagg already shooting in the gym. âHeâs a confident player, a real confident player, which is great,â Scheyer said. âBut he wants direction. He wants to be told when heâs not doing something as well as he can or as hard as he can. And thatâs blown me away.\" Flagg has a soft touch with his shot and passing that works in catch-and-fire situations from 3-point range, off the dribble in midrange or in the post. His length allows him to shoot over most perimeter defenders and block shots at the other end. But it's about more than physical skills. \"Everything that he does, it appears to me, is borne out of trying to win, as a competitor,\" said Arizona State coach Bobby Hurley, the former Duke All-American point guard who got an up-close look at Flagg during an exhibition game last weekend. \"Thatâs going to carry him a long way. Heâs got amazing and diverse skillsets and all that great stuff. But he plays with that fire at both ends of the floor that you look for.â There is little question that Flaggâs game will translate to college basketball, even as the sport features older and more developed players. Itâs managing everything else: the dissection of every on-court moment, selfie and autograph requests, or simply eyes that get wider when spotting him in public. Associate head coach Chris Carrawell has seen it before. The former Blue Devils teammate of big program names like Elton Brand, Jay Williams and Shane Battier returned to join Krzyzewskiâs staff in time for Williamsonâs supernova 2018-19 season, filled with highlight-reel dunks and levels of attention bordering on spectacle on his way to becoming AP national player of the year and the top overall NBA draft pick. âI wonât say Cooper is at that level yet,â Carrawell said. âBut I mean, this is how you know: when a non-basketball fan asks you in the grocery store: âThat Cooper Flagg guy â¦â Youâre like, âYou donât watch basketball every day!â But they know, they know about him.â Andy Bedard, a former player at Boston College and Maine, remembers how the word spread, too. Not about Flagg as the NBA prospect; rather, it was about the standout youngster playing up multiple age levels in northern Maine. Bedard, who knew Flagg's mother Kelly from her time playing at Maine, soon got a look at Cooper's game. âHe was like third grade playing in a fifth- and sixth-grade league,â Bedard said. \"You wouldn't know it because he was the same height if not taller than everybody else even with that difference because he was big at an early age. But he was playing like a guard. It wasn't âGo on the block and put it back in.â Watching him move, I'm like, âHmm, this is different.ââ Bedard went on to form the AAU team that would feature Cooper, his brother Ace, and Bedard's son Kaden, and their families became close. That team eventually started beating the other top instate teams by lopsided margins before playing more games in New York, New Jersey, Connecticut and Massachusetts, and word began to spread about Cooper's talent. Bedard recalled when the team competed in the Nike Elite Youth Basketball League circuit one year that tournament organizers arranged additional security to help manage crowds. Flagg eventually transferred from Maine's Nokomis Regional High School near his hometown in Newport to Florida's Montverde Academy to close his prep career. Bedard recalled how Flagg would play golf and sometimes finish a round to find people waiting at the clubhouse to see him. âI just take it as a compliment, try to be respectful of everybody, even if Iâm not in the best mood or Iâm not having the best day,â Flagg said. âPeople are wanting to see you and wanting to support you. So I think itâs just handling that the right way, and then just focus on basketball.â Freshman wing Darren Harris described his classmate as someone who âjust tries to be a normal kid.\" And in a nod to the added attention that follows Flagg's every move, graduate forward Mason Gillis â part of Purdue's run to the NCAA title game last season â playfully applauded from the back of the room when Flagg wrapped up an interview with reporters. âHe's a great guy, handles his business, does things the way he's supposed to do them,â Gillis said. \"I think he has a lot of pressure already and as a 17-year-old, and he's handling it perfectly.â For more local stories continue with us on our NEWS CENTER Maine+ streaming app. For the latest breaking news, weather, and traffic alerts, download the NEWS CENTER Maine mobile app. Notifications can be turned off anytime in the browser settings.",

                "title": "Elvis Presley - Wikipedia",
                "content": "Elvis Aaron Presley[a] (January 8, 1935 â August 16, 1977), often known mononymously as Elvis, was an American singer and actor. Known as the \"King of Rock and Roll\", he is regarded as one of the most significant cultural figures of the 20th century. Presley's energized performances and interpretations of songs, and sexually provocative performance style, combined with a singularly potent mix of influences across color lines during a transformative era in race relations, brought both great success and initial controversy. Presley was born in Tupelo, Mississippi; his family moved to Memphis, Tennessee when he was 13. His music career began there in 1954, at Sun Records with producer Sam Phillips, who wanted to bring the sound of African-American music to a wider audience. Presley, on guitar and accompanied by lead guitarist Scotty Moore and bassist Bill Black, was a pioneer of rockabilly, an uptempo, backbeat-driven fusion of country music and rhythm and blues. In 1955, drummer D. J. Fontana joined to complete the lineup of Presley's classic quartet and RCA Victor acquired his contract in a deal arranged by Colonel Tom Parker, who managed him for the rest of his career. Presley's first RCA Victor single, \"Heartbreak Hotel\", was released in January 1956 and became a number-one hit in the US. Within a year, RCA Victor would sell ten million Presley singles. With a series of successful television appearances and chart-topping records, Presley became the leading figure of the newly popular rock and roll; though his performative style and promotion of the then-marginalized sound of African Americans[6] led to him being widely considered a threat to the moral well-being of white American youth.[7] In November 1956, Presley made his film debut in Love Me Tender. Drafted into military service in 1958, he relaunched his recording career two years later with some of his most commercially successful work. Presley held few concerts, and guided by Parker, proceeded to devote much of the 1960s to making Hollywood films and soundtrack albums, most of them critically derided. Some of Presley's most famous films included Jailhouse Rock (1957), Blue Hawaii (1961), and Viva Las Vegas (1964). In 1968, he returned to the stage in the acclaimed NBC television comeback special Elvis, which led to an extended Las Vegas concert residency and a string of highly profitable tours. In 1973, Presley gave the first concert by a solo artist to be broadcast around the world, Aloha from Hawaii. Years of prescription drug abuse and unhealthy eating severely compromised his health, and Presley died unexpectedly in August 1977 at his Graceland estate at the age of 42. Presley is one of the best-selling music artists in history, with sale estimates ranging from 500 million records to over a billion worldwide.[b] He was commercially successful in many genres, including pop, country, rock and roll, rockabilly, rhythm and blues, adult contemporary, and gospel. He won three Grammy Awards, received the Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award at age 36, and has been inducted into multiple music halls of fame. He holds several records, including the most RIAA-certified gold and platinum albums, the most albums charted on the Billboard 200, the most number-one albums by a solo artist on the UK Albums Chart, and the most number-one singles by any act on the UK Singles Chart. In 2018, Presley was posthumously awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom. Elvis Aaron Presley was born on January 8, 1935, in Tupelo, Mississippi, to Gladys Love (nÃ©e Smith) and Vernon Presley.[8][9] Elvis' twin Jesse Garon was delivered 35 minutes before, stillborn.[10] Presley became close to both parents, especially his mother. The family attended an Assembly of God church, where he found his initial musical inspiration.[11] Vernon moved from one odd job to the next,[12][13] and the family often relied on neighbors and government food assistance. In 1938, they lost their home after Vernon was found guilty of altering a check and was jailed for eight months.[11] In September 1941, Presley entered first grade at East Tupelo Consolidated, where his teachers regarded him as \"average\".[14] His first public performance was a singing contest at the MississippiâAlabama Fair and Dairy Show on October 3, 1945, when he was 10; he sang \"Old Shep\" and recalled placing fifth.[15] A few months later, Presley received his first guitar for his birthday;[16][17] he received guitar lessons from two uncles and a pastor at the family's church. Presley recalled, \"I took the guitar, and I watched people, and I learned to play a little bit. But I would never sing in public. I was very shy about it.\"[18] In September 1946, Presley entered a new school, Milam, for sixth grade. The following year, he began singing and playing his guitar at school. He was often teased as a \"trashy\" kid who played hillbilly music.[19] Presley was a devotee of Mississippi Slim's radio show. He was described as \"crazy about music\" by Slim's younger brother, one of Presley's classmates. Slim showed Presley chord techniques.[20] When his protÃ©gÃ© was 12, Slim scheduled him for two on-air performances. Presley was overcome by stage fright the first time but performed the following week.[21] In November 1948, the family moved to Memphis, Tennessee.[22] Enrolled at L. C. Humes High School, Presley received a C in music in eighth grade. When his music teacher said he had no aptitude for singing, he brought in his guitar and sang a recent hit, \"Keep Them Cold Icy Fingers Off Me\".[23] He was usually too shy to perform openly and was occasionally bullied by classmates for being a \"mama's boy\".[24] In 1950, Presley began practicing guitar under the tutelage of Lee Denson, a neighbor. They and three other boys, including two future rockabilly pioneers, brothers Dorsey and Johnny Burnetteâformed a loose musical collective.[25] During his junior year, Presley began to stand out among his classmates, largely because of his appearance: he grew his sideburns and styled his hair. He would head down to Beale Street, the heart of Memphis' thriving blues scene, and admire the wild, flashy clothes at Lansky Brothers. By his senior year, he was wearing those clothes.[26] He competed in Humes' Annual \"Minstrel\" Show in 1953, singing and playing \"Till I Waltz Again with You\", a recent hit for Teresa Brewer. Presley recalled that the performance did much for his reputation: I wasn't popular in school ... I failed musicâonly thing I ever failed. And then they entered me in this talent show ... when I came onstage, I heard people kind of rumbling and whispering and so forth, 'cause nobody knew I even sang. It was amazing how popular I became in school after that.[27] Presley, who could not read music, played by ear and frequented record stores that provided jukeboxes and listening booths. He knew all of Hank Snow's songs,[28] and he loved records by other country singers such as Roy Acuff, Ernest Tubb, Ted Daffan, Jimmie Rodgers, Jimmie Davis, and Bob Wills.[29] The Southern gospel singer Jake Hess, one of his favorite performers, was a significant influence on his ballad-singing style.[30][31] Presley was a regular audience member at the monthly All-Night Singings downtown, where many of the white gospel groups that performed reflected the influence of African American spirituals.[32] Presley listened to regional radio stations, such as WDIA, that played what were then called \"race records\": spirituals, blues, and the modern, backbeat-heavy rhythm and blues.[33] Like some of his peers, he may have attended blues venues only on nights designated for exclusively white audiences.[34] Many of his future recordings were inspired by local African-American musicians such as Arthur Crudup and Rufus Thomas.[35][36] B.B. King recalled that he had known Presley before he was popular when they both used to frequent Beale Street.[37] By the time he graduated high school in June 1953, Presley had singled out music as his future.[38][39] In August 1953, Presley checked into Memphis Recording Service, the company run by Sam Phillips before he started Sun Records. He aimed to pay for studio time to record a two-sided acetate disc: \"My Happiness\" and \"That's When Your Heartaches Begin\". He later claimed that he intended the record as a birthday gift for his mother, or that he was merely interested in what he \"sounded like\". Biographer Peter Guralnick argued that Presley chose Sun in the hope of being discovered.[40] In January 1954, Presley cut a second acetate at Sunâ\"I'll Never Stand in Your Way\" and \"It Wouldn't Be the Same Without You\"âbut again nothing came of it.[41] Not long after, he failed an audition for a local vocal quartet, the Songfellows,[42] and another for the band of Eddie Bond.[43] Phillips, meanwhile, was always on the lookout for someone who could bring to a broader audience the sound of the black musicians on whom Sun focused.[45] In June, he acquired a demo recording by Jimmy Sweeney of a ballad, \"Without You\", that he thought might suit Presley. The teenaged singer came by the studio but was unable to do it justice. Despite this, Phillips asked Presley to sing other numbers and was sufficiently affected by what he heard to invite two local musicians, guitarist Winfield \"Scotty\" Moore and upright bass player Bill Black, to work with Presley for a recording session.[46] The session, held the evening of July 5, proved entirely unfruitful until late in the night. As they were about to abort and go home, Presley launched into a 1946 blues number, Arthur Crudup's \"That's All Right\". Moore recalled, \"All of a sudden, Elvis just started singing this song, jumping around and acting the fool, and then Bill picked up his bass, and he started acting the fool, too, and I started playing with them.\" Phillips quickly began taping; this was the sound he had been looking for.[47] Three days later, popular Memphis disc jockey Dewey Phillips played \"That's All Right\" on his Red, Hot, and Blue show.[48] Listener interest was such that Phillips played the record repeatedly during the remaining two hours of his show. Interviewing Presley on-air, Phillips asked him what high school he attended to clarify his color for the many callers who had assumed that he was black.[49] During the next few days, the trio recorded a bluegrass song, Bill Monroe's \"Blue Moon of Kentucky\", again in a distinctive style and employing a jury-rigged echo effect that Sam Phillips dubbed \"slapback\". A single was pressed with \"That's All Right\" on the A-side and \"Blue Moon of Kentucky\" on the reverse.[50] The trio played publicly for the first time at the Bon Air club on July 17, 1954.[51] Later that month, they appeared at the Overton Park Shell, with Slim Whitman headlining. Here Elvis pioneered \"Rubber Legs\", his signature dance movement.[52][53] A combination of his strong response to rhythm and nervousness led Presley to shake his legs as he performed: His wide-cut pants emphasized his movements, causing young women in the audience to start screaming.[54] Moore recalled, \"During the instrumental parts, he would back off from the mic and be playing and shaking, and the crowd would just go wild.\"[55] Soon after, Moore and Black left their old band to play with Presley regularly, and disc jockey/promoter Bob Neal became the trio's manager. From August through October, they played frequently at the Eagle's Nest club, a dance venue in Memphis. When Presley played, teenagers rushed from the pool to fill the club, then left again as the house western swing band resumed.[56] Presley quickly grew more confident on stage. According to Moore, \"His movement was a natural thing, but he was also very conscious of what got a reaction. He'd do something one time and then he would expand on it real quick.\"[57] Amid these live performances, Presley returned to Sun studio for more recording sessions.[58] Presley made what would be his only appearance on Nashville's Grand Ole Opry on October 2; Opry manager Jim Denny told Phillips that his singer was \"not bad\" but did not suit the program.[59][60] In November 1954, Presley performed on Louisiana Hayrideâthe Opry's chief, and more adventurous, rival. The show was broadcast to 198 radio stations in 28 states. His nervous first set drew a muted reaction. A more composed and energetic second set inspired an enthusiastic response.[61] Soon after the show, the Hayride engaged Presley for a year's worth of Saturday-night appearances. Trading in his old guitar for $8, he purchased a Martin instrument for $175 (equivalent to $2,000 in 2023) and his trio began playing in new locales, including Houston, Texas, and Texarkana, Arkansas.[62] Presley made his first television appearance on the KSLA-TV broadcast of Louisiana Hayride. Soon after, he failed an audition for Arthur Godfrey's Talent Scouts on the CBS television network. By early 1955, Presley's regular Hayride appearances, constant touring, and well-received record releases had made him a regional star.[63][64] In January, Neal signed a formal management contract with Presley and brought him to the attention of Colonel Tom Parker, whom he considered the best promoter in the music business. Having successfully managed the top country star Eddy Arnold, Parker was working with the new number-one country singer, Hank Snow. Parker booked Presley on Snow's February tour.[63][64] By August, Sun had released 10 sides credited to \"Elvis Presley, Scotty and Bill\"; the latest recordings included a drummer. Some of the songs, like \"That's All Right\", were in what one Memphis journalist described as the \"R&B idiom of negro field jazz\"; others, like \"Blue Moon of Kentucky\", were \"more in the country field\", \"but there was a curious blending of the two different musics in both\".[65] This blend of styles made it difficult for Presley's music to find radio airplay. According to Neal, many country-music disc jockeys would not play it because Presley sounded too much like a black artist and none of the R&B stations would touch him because \"he sounded too much like a hillbilly.\"[66] The blend came to be known as \"rockabilly\". At the time, Presley was billed as \"The King of Western Bop\", \"The Hillbilly Cat\", and \"The Memphis Flash\".[67] Presley renewed Neal's management contract in August 1955, simultaneously appointing Parker as his special adviser.[68] The group maintained an extensive touring schedule.[69] Neal recalled, \"It was almost frightening, the reaction that came to Elvis from the teenaged boys. So many of them, through some sort of jealousy, would practically hate him. There were occasions in some towns in Texas when we'd have to be sure to have a police guard because somebody'd always try to take a crack at him.\"[70] The trio became a quartet when Hayride drummer Fontana joined as a full member. In mid-October, they played a few shows in support of Bill Haley, whose \"Rock Around the Clock\" track had been a number-one hit the previous year. Haley observed that Presley had a natural feel for rhythm, and advised him to sing fewer ballads.[71] At the Country Disc Jockey Convention in early November, Presley was voted the year's most promising male artist.[72] After three major labels made offers of up to $25,000, Parker and Phillips struck a deal with RCA Victor on November 21 to acquire Presley's Sun contract for an unprecedented $40,000.[73][c] Presley, aged 20, was legally still a minor, so his father signed the contract.[74] Parker arranged with the owners of Hill & Range Publishing, Jean and Julian Aberbach, to create two entities, Elvis Presley Music and Gladys Music, to handle all the new material recorded by Presley. Songwriters were obliged to forgo one-third of their customary royalties in exchange for having Presley perform their compositions.[75][d] By December, RCA had begun to heavily promote its new singer, and before month's end had reissued many of his Sun recordings.[78] On January 10, 1956, Presley made his first recordings for RCA Victor in Nashville.[79] Extending his by-now customary backup of Moore, Black, Fontana, and Hayride pianist Floyd Cramerâwho had been performing at live club dates with PresleyâRCA Victor enlisted guitarist Chet Atkins and three background singers, including Gordon Stoker of the popular Jordanaires quartet.[80] The session produced the moody \"Heartbreak Hotel\", released as a single on January 27.[79] Parker brought Presley to national television, booking him on CBS's Stage Show for six appearances over two months. The program, produced in New York City, was hosted on alternate weeks by big band leaders and brothers Tommy and Jimmy Dorsey. After his first appearance on January 28, Presley stayed in town to record at RCA Victor's New York studio. The sessions yielded eight songs, including a cover of Carl Perkins' rockabilly anthem \"Blue Suede Shoes\". In February, Presley's \"I Forgot to Remember to Forget\", a Sun recording released the previous August, reached the top of the Billboard country chart.[81] Neal's contract was terminated and Parker became Presley's manager.[82] RCA Victor released Presley's self-titled debut album on March 23. Joined by five previously unreleased Sun recordings, its seven recently recorded tracks included two country songs, a bouncy pop tune, and what would centrally define the evolving sound of rock and roll: \"Blue Suede Shoes\"â\"an improvement over Perkins' in almost every way\", according to critic Robert Hilburnâand three R&B numbers that had been part of Presley's stage repertoire, covers of Little Richard, Ray Charles, and The Drifters. As described by Hilburn, these were the most revealing of all. Unlike many white artists ... who watered down the gritty edges of the original R&B versions of songs in the '50s, Presley reshaped them. He not only injected the tunes with his own vocal character but also made guitar, not piano, the lead instrument in all three cases.[83] It became the first rock and roll album to top the Billboard chart, a position it held for ten weeks.[79] While Presley was not an innovative guitarist like Moore or contemporary African American rockers Bo Diddley and Chuck Berry, cultural historian Gilbert B. Rodman argued that the album's cover image, \"of Elvis having the time of his life on stage with a guitar in his hands played a crucial role in positioning the guitar ... as the instrument that best captured the style and spirit of this new music.\"[84] On April 3, Presley made the first of two appearances on NBC's The Milton Berle Show. His performance, on the deck of the USS Hancock in San Diego, California, prompted cheers and screams from an audience of sailors and their dates.[85] A few days later, Presley and his band were flying to Nashville, Tennessee, for a recording session when an engine died and the plane almost went down over Arkansas.[86] Twelve weeks after its original release, \"Heartbreak Hotel\" became Presley's first number-one pop hit. In late April, Presley began a two-week residency at the New Frontier Hotel and Casino on the Las Vegas Strip.[87] The shows were poorly received by the conservative, middle-aged hotel guests, \"like a jug of corn liquor at a champagne party\", a Newsweek critic wrote.[88] Amid his Vegas tenure, Presley, who had acting ambitions, signed a seven-year contract with Paramount Pictures.[89] He began a tour of the Midwest in mid-May, covering 15 cities in as many days.[90] He had attended several shows by Freddie Bell and the Bellboys in Vegas and was struck by their cover of \"Hound Dog\", a hit in 1953 for blues singer Big Mama Thornton by songwriters Jerry Leiber and Mike Stoller. It became his new closing number.[91] After a show in La Crosse, Wisconsin, an urgent message on the letterhead of the local Catholic diocese's newspaper was sent to FBI director J. Edgar Hoover. It warned that Presley is a definite danger to the security of the United States. ... [His] actions and motions were such as to rouse the sexual passions of teenaged youth. ... After the show, more than 1,000 teenagers tried to gang into Presley's room at the auditorium. ... Indications of the harm Presley did just in La Crosse were the two high school girls ... whose abdomen and thigh had Presley's autograph.[92] Presley's second Milton Berle Show appearance came on June 5 at NBC's Hollywood studio, amid another hectic tour. Milton Berle persuaded Presley to leave his guitar backstage.[93] During the performance, Presley abruptly halted an up-tempo rendition of \"Hound Dog\" and launched into a slow, grinding version accentuated with exaggerated body movements.[93] His gyrations created a storm of controversy.[94] Jack Gould of The New York Times wrote, Mr. Presley has no discernible singing ability. ... His phrasing, if it can be called that, consists of the stereotyped variations that go with a beginner's aria in a bathtub. ... His one specialty is an accented movement of the body ... primarily identified with the repertoire of the blond bombshells of the burlesque runway.[95] Ben Gross of the New York Daily News opined that popular music \"has reached its lowest depths in the 'grunt and groin' antics of one Elvis Presley. ... Elvis, who rotates his pelvis ... gave an exhibition that was suggestive and vulgar, tinged with the kind of animalism that should be confined to dives and bordellos\".[96] Ed Sullivan, whose variety show was the nation's most popular, declared Presley \"unfit for family viewing\".[97] To Presley's displeasure, he soon found himself being referred to as \"Elvis the Pelvis\", which he called \"childish\".[98] The Berle shows drew such high ratings that Presley was booked for a July 1 appearance on NBC's The Steve Allen Show in New York. Allen, who was no fan of rock and roll, introduced a \"new Elvis\" in a white bowtie and black tails. Presley sang \"Hound Dog\" for less than a minute to a basset hound wearing a top hat and bowtie. As described by television historian Jake Austen, \"Allen thought Presley was talentless and absurd ... [he] set things up so that Presley would show his contrition\".[99] Allen later wrote that he found Presley's \"strange, gangly, country-boy charisma, his hard-to-define cuteness, and his charming eccentricity intriguing\" and worked him into the \"comedy fabric\" of his program.[100] Just before the final rehearsal for the show, Presley told a reporter, \"I don't want to do anything to make people dislike me. I think TV is important so I'm going to go along, but I won't be able to give the kind of show I do in a personal appearance.\"[101] Presley would refer back to the Allen show as the most ridiculous performance of his career.[102] Later that night, he appeared on Hy Gardner Calling, a popular local television show. Pressed on whether he had learned anything from the criticism of him, Presley responded, \"No, I haven't... I don't see how any type of music would have any bad influence on people when it's only music. ... how would rock 'n' roll music make anyone rebel against their parents?\"[96] The next day, Presley recorded \"Hound Dog\", \"Any Way You Want Me\" and \"Don't Be Cruel\". The Jordanaires sang harmony, as they had on The Steve Allen Show; they would work with Presley through the 1960s. A few days later, Presley made an outdoor concert appearance in Memphis, at which he announced, \"You know, those people in New York are not gonna change me none. I'm gonna show you what the real Elvis is like tonight.\"[103] In August, a judge in Jacksonville, Florida, ordered Presley to tame his act. Throughout the following performance, he largely kept still, except for wiggling his little finger suggestively in mockery of the order.[104] The single pairing \"Don't Be Cruel\" with \"Hound Dog\" ruled the top of the charts for eleven weeksâa mark that would not be surpassed for 36 years.[105] Recording sessions for Presley's second album took place in Hollywood in early September. Leiber and Stoller, the writers of \"Hound Dog\", contributed \"Love Me\".[106] Allen's show with Presley had, for the first time, beaten The Ed Sullivan Show in the ratings. Sullivan booked Presley for three appearances for an unprecedented $50,000.[107] The first, on September 9, 1956, was seen by approximately 60 million viewersâa record 82.6 percent of the television audience.[108] Actor Charles Laughton hosted the show, filling in while Sullivan was recovering from a car accident.[97] According to legend, Presley was shot only from the waist up. Watching clips of the Allen and Berle shows, Sullivan had opined that Presley \"got some kind of device hanging down below the crotch of his pantsâso when he moves his legs back and forth you can see the outline of his cock. ... I think it's a Coke bottle. ... We just can't have this on a Sunday night. This is a family show!\"[109] Sullivan publicly told TV Guide, \"As for his gyrations, the whole thing can be controlled with camera shots.\"[107] In fact, Presley was shown head-to-toe. Though the camerawork was relatively discreet during his debut, with leg-concealing closeups when he danced, the studio audience reacted with screams.[110][111] Presley's performance of his forthcoming single, the ballad \"Love Me Tender\", prompted a record-shattering million advance orders.[112] More than any other single event, it was this first appearance on The Ed Sullivan Show that made Presley a national celebrity.[97] Accompanying Presley's rise to fame, a cultural shift was taking place that he both helped inspire and came to symbolize. The historian Marty Jezer wrote that Presley began the \"biggest pop craze\" since Glenn Miller and Frank Sinatra and brought rock and roll to mainstream culture: As Presley set the artistic pace, other artists followed. ... Presley, more than anyone else, gave the young a belief in themselves as a distinct and somehow unified generationâthe first in America ever to feel the power of an integrated youth culture.[113] The audience response at Presley's live shows became increasingly fevered. Moore recalled, \"He'd start out, 'You ain't nothin' but a Hound Dog,' and they'd just go to pieces. They'd always react the same way. There'd be a riot every time.\"[114] At the two concerts he performed in September at the MississippiâAlabama Fair and Dairy Show, fifty National Guardsmen were added to the police detail to prevent a ruckus.[115] Elvis, Presley's second RCA Victor album, was released in October and quickly rose to number one. The album includes \"Old Shep\", which he sang at the talent show in 1945, and which now marked the first time he played piano on an RCA Victor session. According to Guralnick, \"the halting chords and the somewhat stumbling rhythm\" showed \"the unmistakable emotion and the equally unmistakable valuing of emotion over technique.\"[116] Assessing the musical and cultural impact of Presley's recordings from \"That's All Right\" through Elvis, rock critic Dave Marsh wrote that \"these records, more than any others, contain the seeds of what rock & roll was, has been and most likely what it may foreseeably become.\"[117] Presley returned to The Ed Sullivan Show, hosted this time by its namesake, on October 28. After the performance, crowds in Nashville and St. Louis burned him in effigy.[97] His first motion picture, Love Me Tender, was released on November 21. Though he was not top-billed, the film's original titleâThe Reno Brothersâwas changed to capitalize on his latest number-one record: \"Love Me Tender\" had hit the top of the charts earlier that month. To further take advantage of Presley's popularity, four musical numbers were added to what was originally a straight acting role. The film was panned by critics but did very well at the box office.[89] Presley would receive top billing on every subsequent film he made.[118] On December 4, Presley dropped into Sun Records, where Carl Perkins and Jerry Lee Lewis were recording, and had an impromptu jam session along with Johnny Cash. Though Phillips no longer had the right to release any Presley material, he made sure that the session was captured on tape. The results, none officially released for twenty-five years, became known as the \"Million Dollar Quartet\" recordings.[119] The year ended with a front-page story in The Wall Street Journal reporting that Presley merchandise had brought in $22 million on top of his record sales,[120] and Billboard's declaration that he had placed more songs in the top 100 than any other artist since records were first charted.[121] In his first full year at RCA Victor, then the record industry's largest company, Presley had accounted for over fifty percent of the label's singles sales.[112] Presley made his third and final Ed Sullivan Show appearance on January 6, 1957âon this occasion indeed shot only down to the waist. Some commentators have claimed that Parker orchestrated an appearance of censorship to generate publicity.[111][122] In any event, as critic Greil Marcus describes, Presley \"did not tie himself down. Leaving behind the bland clothes he had worn on the first two shows, he stepped out in the outlandish costume of a pasha, if not a harem girl. From the make-up over his eyes, the hair falling in his face, the overwhelmingly sexual cast of his mouth, he was playing Rudolph Valentino in The Sheik, with all stops out.\"[97] To close, displaying his range and defying Sullivan's wishes, Presley sang a gentle black spiritual, \"Peace in the Valley\". At the end of the show, Sullivan declared Presley \"a real decent, fine boy\".[123] Two days later, the Memphis draft board announced that Presley would be classified 1-A and would probably be drafted sometime that year.[124] Each of the three Presley singles released in the first half of 1957 went to number one: \"Too Much\", \"All Shook Up\", and \"(Let Me Be Your) Teddy Bear\". Already an international star, he was attracting fans even where his music was not officially released: The New York Times reported that pressings of his music on discarded X-ray plates were commanding high prices in Leningrad.[125] Presley purchased his 18-room mansion, Graceland, on March 19, 1957.[126] Before the purchase, Elvis recorded Loving Youâthe soundtrack to his second film, which was released in July. It was his third straight number-one album. The title track was written by Leiber and Stoller, who were then retained to write four of the six songs recorded at the sessions for Jailhouse Rock, Presley's next film. The songwriting team effectively produced the Jailhouse sessions and developed a close working relationship with Presley, who came to regard them as his \"good-luck charm\".[127] \"He was fast,\" said Leiber. \"Any demo you gave him he knew by heart in ten minutes.\"[128] The title track became another number-one hit, as was the Jailhouse Rock EP.[129] Presley undertook three brief tours during the year, continuing to generate a crazed audience response.[130] A Detroit newspaper suggested that \"the trouble with going to see Elvis Presley is that you're liable to get killed\".[131] Villanova students pelted the singer with eggs in Philadelphia,[131] and in Vancouver the crowd rioted after the show ended, destroying the stage.[132] Frank Sinatra, who had inspired the swooning and screaming of teenage girls in the 1940s, decried rock and roll as \"brutal, ugly, degenerate, vicious. ... It fosters almost totally negative and destructive reactions in young people. It smells phoney and false. It is sung, played and written, for the most part, by cretinous goons. ... This rancid-smelling aphrodisiac I deplore.\"[133] Asked for a response, Presley said: I admire the man. He has a right to say what he wants to say. He is a great success and a fine actor, but I think he shouldn't have said it. ... This is a trend, just the same as he faced when he started years ago.[134] Leiber and Stoller were again in the studio for the recording of Elvis' Christmas Album. Toward the end of the session, they wrote a song on the spot at Presley's request: \"Santa Claus Is Back in Town\", an innuendo-laden blues.[135] The holiday release stretched Presley's string of number-one albums to four and would become the best-selling Christmas album ever in the United States,[136][137] with eventual sales of over 20 million worldwide.[138] After the session, Moore and Blackâdrawing only modest weekly salaries, sharing in none of Presley's massive financial successâresigned, though they were brought back on a per diem basis a few weeks later.[139] On December 20, Presley received his draft notice, though he was granted a deferment to finish the forthcoming film King Creole. A couple of weeks into the new year, \"Don't\", another Leiber and Stoller tune, became Presley's tenth number-one seller. Recording sessions for the King Creole soundtrack were held in Hollywood in mid-January 1958. Leiber and Stoller provided three songs, but it would be the last time Presley and the duo worked closely together.[140] As Stoller later recalled, Presley's manager and entourage sought to wall him off.[141] A brief soundtrack session on February 11 marked the final occasion on which Black was to perform with Presley.[142] On March 24, 1958, Presley was drafted into the United States Army at Fort Chaffee in Arkansas. His arrival was a major media event. Hundreds of people descended on Presley as he stepped from the bus; photographers accompanied him into the installation.[143] Presley announced that he was looking forward to his military service, saying that he did not want to be treated any differently from anyone else.[144] Between March 28 and September 17, 1958, Presley completed basic and advanced training at Fort Hood, Texas, where he was temporarily assigned to Company A, 2d Medium Tank Battalion, 37th Armor. During the two weeks' leave between his basic and advanced training in early June, he recorded five songs in Nashville.[145] In early August, Presley's mother was diagnosed with hepatitis, and her condition rapidly worsened. Presley was granted emergency leave to visit her and arrived in Memphis on August 12. Two days later, she died of heart failure at age 46. Presley was devastated and never the same;[146][147] their relationship had remained extremely closeâeven into his adulthood, they would use baby talk with each other and Presley would address her with pet names.[4] On October 1, 1958, Presley was assigned to the 1st Medium Tank Battalion, 32d Armor, 3d Armored Division, at Ray Barracks, West Germany, where he served as an armor intelligence specialist.[1] On November 27, he was promoted to private first class and on June 1, 1959, to specialist fourth class. While on maneuvers, Presley was introduced to amphetamines and became \"practically evangelical about their benefits\", not only for energy but for \"strength\" and weight loss.[148] Karate became a lifelong interest: he studied with JÃ¼rgen Seydel,[149][150] and later included it in his live performances.[151][152][153] Fellow soldiers have attested to Presley's wish to be seen as an able, ordinary soldier despite his fame, and to his generosity. He donated his Army pay to charity, purchased television sets for the base, and bought an extra set of fatigues for everyone in his outfit.[154] Presley was promoted to sergeant on February 11, 1960.[1] While in Bad Nauheim, Presley, aged 24, met 14-year-old Priscilla Beaulieu.[155] They would marry after a seven-and-a-half-year courtship. In her autobiography, Priscilla said that Presley was concerned that his 24 months in the military would ruin his career. In Special Services, he would have been able to perform and remain in touch with the public, but Parker had convinced him that to gain popular respect, he should serve as a regular soldier.[156] Media reports echoed Presley's concerns about his career, but RCA Victor producer Steve Sholes and Freddy Bienstock of Hill and Range had carefully prepared: armed with a substantial amount of unreleased material, they kept up a regular stream of successful releases.[157] Between his induction and discharge, Presley had ten top-40 hits, including \"Wear My Ring Around Your Neck\", the bestselling \"Hard Headed Woman\", and \"One Night\" in 1958, and \"(Now and Then There's) A Fool Such as I\" and the number-one \"A Big Hunk o' Love\" in 1959.[158] RCA Victor also generated four albums compiling previously issued material during this period, most successfully Elvis' Golden Records (1958), which hit number three on the LP chart.[159] Presley returned to the U.S. on March 2, 1960, and was honorably discharged three days later.[161] The train that carried him from New Jersey to Tennessee was mobbed all the way, and Presley was called upon to appear at scheduled stops to please his fans.[162] On the night of March 20, he entered RCA's Nashville studio to cut tracks for a new album along with a single, \"Stuck on You\", which was rushed into release and swiftly became a number-one hit.[163] Another Nashville session two weeks later yielded a pair of bestselling singles, the ballads \"It's Now or Never\" and \"Are You Lonesome Tonight?\", along with the rest of Elvis Is Back! The album features several songs described by Greil Marcus as full of Chicago blues \"menace, driven by Presley's own super-miked acoustic guitar, brilliant playing by Scotty Moore, and demonic sax work from Boots Randolph. Elvis' singing wasn't sexy, it was pornographic.\"[164] The record \"conjured up the vision of a performer who could be all things\", according to music historian John Robertson: \"a flirtatious teenage idol with a heart of gold; a tempestuous, dangerous lover; a gutbucket blues singer; a sophisticated nightclub entertainer; [a] raucous rocker\".[165] Released only days after recording was complete, it reached number two on the album chart.[166][167] Presley returned to television on May 12 as a guest on The Frank Sinatra Timex Special. Also known as Welcome Home Elvis, the show had been taped in late March, the only time all year Presley performed in front of an audience. Parker secured an unheard-of $125,000 for eight minutes of singing. The broadcast drew an enormous viewership.[168] G.I. Blues, the soundtrack to Presley's first film since his return, was a number-one album in October. His first LP of sacred material, His Hand in Mine, followed two months later; it reached number 13 on the U.S. pop chart and number 3 in the United Kingdom, remarkable figures for a gospel album. In February 1961, Presley performed two shows in Memphis, for a benefit for 24 local charities. During a luncheon preceding the event, RCA Victor presented him with a plaque certifying worldwide sales of over 75 million records.[169] A twelve-hour Nashville session in mid-March yielded nearly all of Presley's next studio album, Something for Everybody.[170] According to John Robertson, it exemplifies the Nashville sound, the restrained, cosmopolitan style that would define country music in the 1960s. Presaging much of what was to come from Presley over the next half-decade, the album is largely \"a pleasant, unthreatening pastiche of the music that had once been Elvis' birthright\".[171] It would be his sixth number-one LP. Another benefit concert, for a Pearl Harbor memorial, was staged on March 25 in Hawaii. It was to be Presley's last public performance for seven years.[172] Parker had by now pushed Presley into a heavy filmmaking schedule, focused on formulaic, modestly budgeted musical comedies. Presley initially insisted on pursuing higher roles, but when two films in a more dramatic veinâFlaming Star (1960) and Wild in the Country (1961)âwere less commercially successful, he reverted to the formula. Among the twenty-seven films he made during the 1960s, there were a few further exceptions.[173] His films were almost universally panned; critic Andrew Caine dismissed them as a \"pantheon of bad taste\".[174] Nonetheless, they were virtually all profitable. Hal Wallis, who produced nine, declared, \"A Presley picture is the only sure thing in Hollywood.\"[175] Of Presley's films in the 1960s, 15 were accompanied by soundtrack albums and another five by soundtrack EPs. The films' rapid production and release schedulesâPresley frequently starred in three a yearâaffected his music. According to Jerry Leiber, the soundtrack formula was already evident before Presley left for the Army: \"three ballads, one medium-tempo [number], one up-tempo, and one break blues boogie\".[176] As the decade wore on, the quality of the soundtrack songs grew \"progressively worse\".[177] Julie Parrish, who appeared in Paradise, Hawaiian Style (1966), says that Presley disliked many of the songs.[178] The Jordanaires' Gordon Stoker describes how he would retreat from the studio microphone: \"The material was so bad that he felt like he couldn't sing it.\"[179] Most of the film albums featured a song or two from respected writers such as the team of Doc Pomus and Mort Shuman. But by and large, according to biographer Jerry Hopkins, the numbers seemed to be \"written on order by men who never really understood Elvis or rock and roll\".[180] In the first half of the decade, three of Presley's soundtrack albums were ranked number one on the pop charts, and a few of his most popular songs came from his films, such as \"Can't Help Falling in Love\" (1961) and \"Return to Sender\" (1962). However, the commercial returns steadily diminished. From 1964 to 1968, Presley had only one top-ten hit: \"Crying in the Chapel\" (1965), a gospel number recorded in 1960. As for non-film albums, between the June 1962 release of Pot Luck and the November 1968 release of the soundtrack to the television special that signaled his comeback, only one LP of new material by Presley was issued: the gospel album How Great Thou Art (1967). It won him his first Grammy Award, for Best Sacred Performance. As Marsh described, Presley was \"arguably the greatest white gospel singer of his time [and] really the last rock & roll artist to make gospel as vital a component of his musical personality as his secular songs\".[181] Shortly before Christmas 1966, more than seven years since they first met, Presley proposed to Priscilla Beaulieu. They were married on May 1, 1967, in a brief ceremony in their suite at the Aladdin Hotel in Las Vegas.[182] The flow of formulaic films and assembly-line soundtracks continued. It was not until October 1967, when the Clambake soundtrack LP registered record low sales for a new Presley album, that RCA Victor executives recognized a problem. \"By then, of course, the damage had been done\", as historians Connie Kirchberg and Marc Hendrickx put it. \"Elvis was viewed as a joke by serious music lovers and a has-been to all but his most loyal fans.\"[183] Presley's only child, Lisa Marie, was born on February 1, 1968, during a period when he had grown deeply unhappy with his career.[186] Of the eight Presley singles released between January 1967 and May 1968, only two charted in the top 40, none higher than number 28.[187] His forthcoming soundtrack album, Speedway, would rank at number 82. Parker had already shifted his plans to television: he maneuvered a deal with NBC that committed the network to finance a theatrical feature and broadcast a Christmas special.[188] Recorded in late June in Burbank, California, the special, simply called Elvis, aired on December 3, 1968. Later known as the '68 Comeback Special, the show featured lavishly staged studio productions as well as songs performed with a band in front of a small audienceâPresley's first live performances since 1961. The live segments saw Presley dressed in tight black leather, singing and playing guitar in an uninhibited style reminiscent of his early rock and roll days. Director and co-producer Steve Binder worked hard to produce a show that was far from the hour of Christmas songs Parker had originally planned.[189] The show, NBC's highest-rated that season, captured 42 percent of the total viewing audience.[190] Jon Landau of Eye magazine remarked: There is something magical about watching a man who has lost himself find his way back home. He sang with the kind of power people no longer expect of rock 'n' roll singers. He moved his body with a lack of pretension and effort that must have made Jim Morrison green with envy.[191] Marsh calls the performance one of \"emotional grandeur and historical resonance\".[192] By January 1969, the single \"If I Can Dream\", written for the special, reached number 12. The soundtrack album rose into the top ten. According to friend Jerry Schilling, the special reminded Presley of what \"he had not been able to do for years, being able to choose the people; being able to choose what songs and not being told what had to be on the soundtrack. ... He was out of prison, man.\"[190] Binder said of Presley's reaction, \"I played Elvis the 60-minute show, and he told me in the screening room, 'Steve, it's the greatest thing I've ever done in my life. I give you my word I will never sing a song I don't believe in.'\"[190] Buoyed by the experience of the Comeback Special, Presley engaged in a prolific series of recording sessions at American Sound Studio, which led to the acclaimed From Elvis in Memphis. Released in June 1969, it was his first secular, non-soundtrack album from a dedicated period in the studio in eight years. As described by Marsh, it is \"a masterpiece in which Presley immediately catches up with pop music trends that had seemed to pass him by during the movie years. He sings country songs, soul songs and rockers with real conviction, a stunning achievement.\"[194] The album featured the hit single \"In the Ghetto\", issued in April, which reached number three on the pop chartâPresley's first non-gospel top ten hit since \"Bossa Nova Baby\" in 1963. Further hit singles were culled from the American Sound sessions: \"Suspicious Minds\", \"Don't Cry Daddy\", and \"Kentucky Rain\".[195] Presley was keen to resume regular live performing. Following the success of the Comeback Special, offers came in from around the world. The London Palladium offered Parker US$28,000 (equivalent to $233,000 in 2023) for a one-week engagement. He responded, \"That's fine for me, now how much can you get for Elvis?\"[196] In May, the brand-new International Hotel in Las Vegas, boasting the largest showroom in the city, booked Presley for fifty-seven shows over four weeks, beginning July 31. Moore, Fontana, and the Jordanaires declined to participate, afraid of losing the lucrative session work they had in Nashville. Presley assembled new, top-notch accompaniment, led by guitarist James Burton and including two gospel groups, The Imperials and Sweet Inspirations.[197] Costume designer Bill Belew, responsible for the intense leather styling of the Comeback Special, created a new stage look for Presley, inspired by his passion for karate.[198] Nonetheless, Presley was nervous: his only previous Las Vegas engagement, in 1956, had been dismal. Parker oversaw a major promotional push, and International Hotel owner Kirk Kerkorian arranged to send his own plane to New York to fly in rock journalists for the debut performance.[199] Presley took to the stage without introduction. The audience of 2,200, including many celebrities, gave him a standing ovation before he sang a note and another after his performance. A third followed his encore, \"Can't Help Falling in Love\" (which would be his closing number for much of his remaining life).[200] At a press conference after the show, when a journalist referred to him as \"The King\", Presley gestured toward Fats Domino, who was taking in the scene. \"No,\" Presley said, \"that's the real king of rock and roll.\"[201] The next day, Parker's negotiations with the hotel resulted in a five-year contract for Presley to play each February and August, at an annual salary of $1 million.[202] Newsweek commented, \"There are several unbelievable things about Elvis, but the most incredible is his staying power in a world where meteoric careers fade like shooting stars.\"[203] Rolling Stone called Presley \"supernatural, his own resurrection.\"[204] In November, Presley's final non-concert film, Change of Habit, opened. The double album From Memphis to Vegas/From Vegas to Memphis came out the same month; the first LP consisted of live performances from the International, the second of more cuts from the American Sound sessions. \"Suspicious Minds\" reached the top of the chartsâPresley's first U.S. pop number-one in over seven years, and his last.[205] Cassandra Peterson, later television's Elvira, met Presley during this period in Las Vegas. She recalled of their encounter, \"He was so anti-drug when I met him. I mentioned to him that I smoked marijuana, and he was just appalled.\"[206] Presley also rarely drankâseveral of his family members had been alcoholics, a fate he intended to avoid.[207] Presley returned to the International early in 1970 for the first of the year's two-month-long engagements, performing two shows a night. Recordings from these shows were issued on the album On Stage.[208] In late February, Presley performed six attendance-recordâbreaking shows at the Houston Astrodome.[209] In April, the single \"The Wonder of You\" was issuedâa number one hit in the UK, it topped the U.S. adult contemporary chart as well. Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer (MGM) filmed rehearsal and concert footage at the International during August for the documentary Elvis: That's the Way It Is. Presley was performing in a jumpsuit, which would become a trademark of his live act. During this engagement, he was threatened with murder unless US$50,000 (equivalent to $392,000 in 2023) was paid. Presley had been the target of many threats since the 1950s, often without his knowledge.[210] The FBI took the threat seriously and security was increased for the next two shows. Presley went onstage with a Derringer in his right boot and a .45 caliber pistol in his waistband, but the concerts succeeded without any incidents.[211][212] That's the Way It Is, produced to accompany the documentary and featuring both studio and live recordings, marked a stylistic shift. As music historian John Robertson noted, The authority of Presley's singing helped disguise the fact that the album stepped decisively away from the American-roots inspiration of the Memphis sessions towards a more middle-of-the-road sound. With country put on the back burner, and soul and R&B left in Memphis, what was left was very classy, very clean white popâperfect for the Las Vegas crowd, but a definite retrograde step for Elvis.[213] After the end of his International engagement on September 7, Presley embarked on a week-long concert tour, largely of the South, his first since 1958. Another week-long tour, of the West Coast, followed in November.[214] On December 21, 1970, Presley engineered a meeting with U.S. President Richard Nixon at the White House, where he explained how he believed he could reach out to the hippies to help combat the drug culture he and the president abhorred. He asked Nixon for a Bureau of Narcotics and Dangerous Drugs badge, to signify official sanction of his efforts. Nixon, who apparently found the encounter awkward, expressed a belief that Presley could send a positive message to young people and that it was, therefore, important that he \"retain his credibility\".[215] Presley told Nixon that the Beatles, whose songs he regularly performed in concert during the era,[216] exemplified what he saw as a trend of anti-Americanism.[217] Presley and his friends previously had a four-hour get-together with the Beatles at his home in Bel Air, California, in August 1965. Paul McCartney later said that he \"felt a bit betrayed. ... The great joke was that we were taking [illegal] drugs, and look what happened to him\", a reference to Presley's early death linked to prescription drug abuse.[218] The U.S. Junior Chamber of Commerce named Presley one of its annual Ten Most Outstanding Young Men of the Nation on January 16, 1971.[219] Not long after, the City of Memphis named the stretch of Highway 51 South on which Graceland is located \"Elvis Presley Boulevard\". The same year, Presley became the first rock and roll singer to be awarded the Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award (then known as the Bing Crosby Award).[220][221] Three new, non-film Presley studio albums were released in 1971. Best received by critics was Elvis Country, a concept record that focused on genre standards.[222] The biggest seller was Elvis Sings The Wonderful World of Christmas. According to Greil Marcus, In the midst of ten painfully genteel Christmas songs, every one sung with appalling sincerity and humility, one could find Elvis tom-catting his way through six blazing minutes of \"Merry Christmas Baby\", a raunchy old Charles Brown blues. [...] If [Presley's] sin was his lifelessness, it was his sinfulness that brought him to life.[223] MGM filmed Presley in April 1972 for Elvis on Tour, which went on to win the Golden Globe Award for Best Documentary Film for that year's Golden Globe Awards. His gospel album He Touched Me, released that month, would earn him his second Grammy Award for Best Inspirational Performance. A fourteen-date tour commenced with an unprecedented four consecutive sold-out shows at New York's Madison Square Garden.[224] The evening concert on July 10 was issued in LP form a week later. Elvis: As Recorded at Madison Square Garden became one of Presley's biggest-selling albums. After the tour, the single \"Burning Love\" was releasedâPresley's last top ten hit on the U.S. pop chart. \"The most exciting single Elvis has made since 'All Shook Up'\", wrote rock critic Robert Christgau.[225] Presley and his wife had become increasingly distant, barely cohabiting. In 1971, an affair he had with Joyce Bova resultedâunbeknownst to himâin her pregnancy and an abortion.[226] He often raised the possibility of Joyce moving into Graceland.[227] The Presleys separated on February 23, 1972, after Priscilla disclosed her relationship with Mike Stone, a karate instructor Presley had recommended to her. Priscilla related that when she told him, Presley forcefully made love to her, declaring, \"This is how a real man makes love to his woman\".[228] She later stated in an interview that she regretted her choice of words in describing the incident, and said it had been an overstatement.[229] Five months later, Presley's new girlfriend, Linda Thompson, a songwriter and one-time Memphis beauty queen, moved in with him.[230] Presley and his wife filed for divorce on August 18.[231] According to Joe Moscheo of the Imperials, the failure of Presley's marriage \"was a blow from which he never recovered\".[232] At a rare press conference that June, a reporter had asked Presley whether he was satisfied with his image. Presley replied, \"Well, the image is one thing and the human being another ... it's very hard to live up to an image.\"[233] In January 1973, Presley performed two benefit concerts for the Kui Lee Cancer Fund in connection with a groundbreaking television special, Aloha from Hawaii, which would be the first concert by a solo artist to be aired globally. The first show served as a practice run and backup should technical problems affect the live broadcast two days later. On January 14, Aloha from Hawaii aired live via satellite to prime-time audiences in Japan, South Korea, Thailand, the Philippines, Australia, and New Zealand, as well as to U.S. servicemen based across Southeast Asia. In Japan, where it capped a nationwide Elvis Presley Week, it smashed viewing records. The next night, it was simulcast to twenty-eight European countries, and in April an extended version aired in the U.S., receiving a fifty-seven percent share of the TV audience.[235] Over time, Parker's claim that it was seen by one billion or more people[236] would be broadly accepted,[237][238][239] but that figure appeared to have been sheer invention.[240][241] Presley's stage costume became the most recognized example of the elaborate concert garb with which his latter-day persona became closely associated. As described by Bobbie Ann Mason, \"At the end of the show, when he spreads out his American Eagle cape, with the full stretched wings of the eagle studded on the back, he becomes a god figure.\"[242] The accompanying double album, released in February, went to number one and eventually sold over 5 million copies in the U.S.[243] It was Presley's last U.S. number-one pop album during his lifetime.[244] At a midnight show that same month, four men rushed onto the stage in an apparent attack. Security personnel came to Presley's defense, and he ejected one invader from the stage himself. Following the show, Presley became obsessed with the idea that the men had been sent by Mike Stone to kill him. Though they were shown to have been only overexuberant fans, Presley raged, \"There's too much pain in me ... Stone [must] die.\" His outbursts continued with such intensity that a physician was unable to calm him, despite administering large doses of medication. After another two full days of raging, Red West, his friend and bodyguard, felt compelled to get a price for a contract killing and was relieved when Presley decided, \"Aw hell, let's just leave it for now. Maybe it's a bit heavy.\"[245] Presley's divorce was finalized on October 9, 1973.[246] He and Priscilla would remain close friends until his death, even holding hands while leaving the courtroom where they finalized their divorce. Priscilla recalled that they lived life together \"like we were never divorced. Elvis and I still hugged each other, still had love. We would say, 'Mommy said this' and 'Daddy said that.' That helped Lisa to feel stable. There was never any arguing or bitterness.\"[247] By this time, his health was in serious decline. Twice during the year he overdosed on barbiturates, spending three days in a coma in his hotel suite after the first incident. In late 1973, he was hospitalized from the effects of a pethidine addiction. According to his primary care physician, George C. Nichopoulos, Presley \"felt that by getting drugs from a doctor, he wasn't the common everyday junkie getting something off the street\".[248] Since his comeback, he had staged more live shows with each passing year, and 1973 saw 168 concerts, his busiest schedule ever.[249] Despite his failing health, he undertook another intensive touring schedule in 1974.[250] Presley's condition declined precipitously that September. Keyboardist Tony Brown remembered his arrival at a University of Maryland concert: \"He fell out of the limousine, to his knees. People jumped to help, and he pushed them away like, 'Don't help me.' He walked on stage and held onto the mic for the first thirty minutes like it was a post. Everybody's looking at each other like, 'Is the tour gonna happen'?\"[251] Guitarist John Wilkinson recalled: He was all gut. He was slurring. He was so fucked up. ... It was obvious he was drugged. It was obvious there was something terribly wrong with his body. It was so bad the words to the songs were barely intelligible. ... I remember crying. He could barely get through the introductions.[252] On July 13, 1976, Vernon Presleyâwho had become deeply involved in his son's financial affairsâhad fired \"Memphis Mafia\" bodyguards Red West (Presley's friend since the 1950s), Sonny West, and David Hebler, citing the need to \"cut back on expenses\".[253][254][255] Presley was in Palm Springs at the time, and some suggest the singer was too cowardly to face the three himself. Another associate of Presley's, John O'Grady, argued that the bodyguards were dropped because their rough treatment of fans had prompted too many lawsuits.[256] Presley's stepbrother David Stanley has claimed that the bodyguards were fired because they were becoming more outspoken about Presley's drug dependency.[257] RCA began to grow anxious as his interest in the recording studio waned. After a session in December 1973 that produced eighteen songs, enough for almost two albums, Presley made no official studio recordings in 1974.[258] Parker delivered RCA another concert record, Elvis Recorded Live on Stage in Memphis.[259] Recorded on March 20, it included a version of \"How Great Thou Art\" that won Presley his third and final Grammy Award for Best Inspirational Performance.[260][261] All three of his competitive Grammy wins â out of fourteen total nominations â were for gospel recordings.[261] Presley returned to the recording studio in March 1975, but Parker's attempts to arrange another session toward the end of the year were unsuccessful.[262] In 1976, RCA sent a mobile recording unit to Graceland that made possible two full-scale recording sessions,[263] but the recording process had become a struggle for him.[264] After Presley's relationship with Linda Thompson ended,[266] he began dating Ginger Alden in November 1976; he proposed marriage to Alden two months later.[267] Journalist Tony Scherman wrote that, by early 1977, \"Presley had become a grotesque caricature of his sleek, energetic former self. Grossly overweight, his mind dulled by the pharmacopia he daily ingested, he was barely able to pull himself through his abbreviated concerts.\"[268] According to Andy Greene of Rolling Stone, Presley's final performances were mostly \"sad, sloppy affairs where a bloated, drugged Presley struggled to remember his lyrics and get through the night without collapsing ... Most everything from the final three years of his life is sad and hard to watch.\"[269] In Alexandria, Louisiana, he was on stage for less than an hour and \"was impossible to understand\".[270] On March 31, he canceled a performance in Baton Rouge, unable to get out of his hotel bed; four shows had to be canceled and rescheduled.[271] Despite the accelerating deterioration of his health, Presley fulfilled most of his touring commitments. According to Guralnick, fans \"were becoming increasingly voluble about their disappointment, but it all seemed to go right past Presley, whose world was now confined almost entirely to his room and his spiritualism books\".[272] Presley's cousin, Billy Smith, recalled how he would sit in his room and chat for hours, sometimes recounting favorite Monty Python sketches and his past escapades, but more often gripped by paranoid obsessions.[273] \"Way Down\", Presley's last single issued during his lifetime, was released on June 6, 1977. That month, CBS taped two concerts for a television special, Elvis in Concert, to be broadcast in October. In the first, shot in Omaha on June 19, Presley's voice, Guralnick writes, \"is almost unrecognizable, a small, childlike instrument in which he talks more than sings most of the songs, casts about uncertainly for the melody in others, and is virtually unable to articulate or project\".[274] Two days later, in Rapid City, South Dakota, \"he looked healthier, seemed to have lost a little weight, and sounded better, too\", though, by the conclusion of the performance, his face was \"framed in a helmet of blue-black hair from which sweat sheets down over pale, swollen cheeks\".[274] Presley's final concert was held in Indianapolis at Market Square Arena, on June 26, 1977.[275] The book Elvis: What Happened?, co-written by the three bodyguards fired a year prior, was published on August 1.[276] It was the first exposÃ© to detail Presley's years of drug misuse. He was devastated by the book and tried unsuccessfully to halt its release by offering money to the publishers.[277] By this point, he suffered from multiple ailments: glaucoma, high blood pressure, liver damage, and an enlarged colon, each aggravatedâand possibly causedâby drug abuse.[248] On August 16, 1977, Presley was scheduled on an evening flight out of Memphis to Portland, Maine, to begin another tour. That afternoon his fiancÃ©e Ginger Alden discovered him unresponsive on the bathroom floor of his Graceland mansion.[278] Attempts to revive him failed, and he was pronounced dead at Baptist Memorial Hospital at 3:30 p.m.;[279] he was 42.[280] President Jimmy Carter issued a statement that credited Presley with having \"permanently changed the face of American popular culture\".[281] Thousands of people gathered outside Graceland to view the open casket. One of Presley's cousins, Billy Mann, accepted US$18,000 (equivalent to $91,000 in 2023) to secretly photograph the body; the picture appeared on the cover of the National Enquirer's biggest-selling issue ever.[282] Alden struck a $105,000 (equivalent to $528,000 in 2023) deal with the Enquirer for her story, but settled for less when she broke her exclusivity agreement.[283] Presley left her nothing in his will.[284] Presley's funeral was held at Graceland on August 18. Outside the gates, a car crashed into a group of fans, killing two young women and critically injuring a third.[285] About 80,000 people lined the processional route to Forest Hill Cemetery, where Presley was buried next to his mother.[286] Within a few weeks, \"Way Down\" topped the country and UK singles chart.[287][288] Following an attempt to steal Presley's body in late August, the remains of both Presley and his mother were exhumed and reburied in Graceland's Meditation Garden on October 2.[283] While an autopsy undertaken the same day Presley died was still in progress, Memphis medical examiner Jerry Francisco announced that the immediate cause of death was cardiac arrest and declared that \"drugs played no role in Presley's death\".[289] In fact, \"drug use was heavily implicated\" in Presley's death, writes Guralnick. The pathologists conducting the autopsy thought it possible, for instance, that he had suffered \"anaphylactic shock brought on by the codeine pills he had gotten from his dentist, to which he was known to have had a mild allergy\". Lab reports filed two months later strongly suggested that polypharmacy was the primary cause of death; one reported \"fourteen drugs in Elvis' system, ten in significant quantity\".[290] In 1979, forensic pathologist Cyril Wecht reviewed the reports and concluded that a combination of depressants had resulted in Presley's accidental death.[289] Forensic historian and pathologist Michael Baden viewed the situation as complicated: \"Elvis had an enlarged heart for a long time. That, together with his drug habit, caused his death. But he was difficult to diagnose; it was a judgment call.\"[291] The competence and ethics of two of the centrally involved medical professionals were seriously questioned. Francisco had offered a cause of death before the autopsy was complete; claimed the underlying ailment was cardiac arrhythmia, a condition that can be determined only in a living person; and denied drugs played any part in Presley's death before the toxicology results were known.[289] Allegations of a cover-up were widespread.[291] While a 1981 trial of Presley's main physician, George C. Nichopoulos, exonerated him of criminal liability, the facts were startling: \"In the first eight months of 1977 alone, he had [prescribed] more than 10,000 doses of sedatives, amphetamines, and narcotics: all in Elvis' name.\" Nichopoulos' license was suspended for three months. It was permanently revoked in the 1990s after the Tennessee Medical Board brought new charges of over-prescription.[248] In 1994, the Presley autopsy report was reopened. Joseph Davis, who had conducted thousands of autopsies as Miami-Dade County coroner,[292] declared at its completion, \"There is nothing in any of the data that supports a death from drugs. In fact, everything points to a sudden, violent heart attack.\"[248] More recent research has revealed that Francisco did not speak for the entire pathology team. Other staff \"could say nothing with confidence until they got the results back from the laboratories, if then.\"[293] One of the examiners, E. Eric Muirhead, could not believe his ears. Francisco had not only presumed to speak for the hospital's team of pathologists, he had announced a conclusion that they had not reached. ... Early on, a meticulous dissection of the body ... confirmed [that] Elvis was chronically ill with diabetes, glaucoma, and constipation. As they proceeded, the doctors saw evidence that his body had been wracked over a span of years by a large and constant stream of drugs. They had also studied his hospital records, which included two admissions for drug detoxification and methadone treatments.[293] Between 1977 and 1981, six of Presley's posthumously released singles were top-ten country hits.[287] Graceland was opened to the public in 1982. Attracting over half a million visitors annually, it became the second-most-visited home in the United States, after the White House.[294] The residence was declared a National Historic Landmark in 2006.[295] Presley has been inducted into five music halls of fame: the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame (1986), the Country Music Hall of Fame (1998), the Gospel Music Hall of Fame (2001), the Rockabilly Hall of Fame (2007), and the Memphis Music Hall of Fame (2012). In 1984, he received the W. C. Handy Award from the Blues Foundation and the Academy of Country Music's first Golden Hat Award. In 1987, he received the American Music Awards' Award of Merit.[296] A Junkie XL remix of Presley's \"A Little Less Conversation\" (credited as \"Elvis Vs JXL\") was used in a Nike advertising campaign during the 2002 FIFA World Cup. It topped the charts in over twenty countries and was included in a compilation of Presley's number-one hits, ELV1S, which was also an international success. The album returned Presley to the top of the Billboard chart for the first time in almost three decades.[297] In 2003, a remix of \"Rubberneckin'\", a 1969 recording, topped the U.S. sales chart, as did a 50th-anniversary re-release of \"That's All Right\" the following year.[298] The latter was an outright hit in Britain, debuting at number three on the pop chart; it also made the top ten in Canada.[299] In 2005, another three reissued singles, \"Jailhouse Rock\", \"One Night\"/\"I Got Stung\", and \"It's Now or Never\", went to number one in the UK. They were part of a campaign that saw the re-release of all eighteen of Presley's previous chart-topping UK singles. The first, \"All Shook Up\", came with a collectors' box that made it ineligible to chart again; each of the other seventeen reissues hit the British top five.[300] In 2005, Forbes magazine named Presley the top-earning deceased celebrity for the fifth straight year, with a gross income of $45 million.[301] He was placed second in 2006,[302] returned to the top spot the next two years,[303][304] and ranked fourth in 2009.[305] The following year, he was ranked second, with his highest annual income everâ$60 millionâspurred by the celebration of his 75th birthday and the launch of Cirque du Soleil's Viva Elvis show in Las Vegas.[306] In November 2010, Viva Elvis: The Album was released, setting his voice to newly recorded instrumental tracks.[307][308] As of mid-2011, there were an estimated 15,000 licensed Presley products,[309] and he was again the second-highest-earning deceased celebrity.[310] Six years later, he ranked fourth with earnings of $35 million, up $8 million from 2016 due in part to the opening of a new entertainment complex, Elvis Presley's Memphis, and hotel, The Guest House at Graceland.[311] In 2018, RCA/Legacy released Elvis Presley â Where No One Stands Alone, a new album focused on Presley's love of gospel music. Produced by Joel Weinshanker, Lisa Marie Presley and Andy Childs, the album introduced newly recorded instrumentation along with vocals from singers who had performed in the past with Elvis. It included a reimagined duet with Lisa Marie, on the album's title track.[312] In 2022, Baz Luhrmann's film Elvis, a biographical film about Presley's life, was released. Presley is portrayed by Austin Butler and Parker by Tom Hanks. As of August 2022, the film had grossed $261.8 million worldwide on a $85 million budget, becoming the second-highest-grossing music biopic of all-time behind Bohemian Rhapsody (2018), and the fifth-highest-grossing Australian-produced film. For his portrayal of Presley, Butler won the Golden Globe and was nominated for the Oscar for Best Actor.[313] In January 2023, his 1962 Lockheed 1329 JetStar sold at an auction for $260,000.[314] Presley's earliest musical influence came from gospel. His mother recalled that from the age of two, at the Assembly of God church in Tupelo attended by the family, \"he would slide down off my lap, run into the aisle and scramble up to the platform. There he would stand looking at the choir and trying to sing with them.\"[315] In Memphis, Presley frequently attended all-night gospel singings at the Ellis Auditorium, where groups such as the Statesmen Quartet led the music in a style that, Guralnick suggests, sowed the seeds of Presley's future stage act: The Statesmen were an electric combination ... featuring some of the most thrillingly emotive singing and daringly unconventional showmanship in the entertainment world ... dressed in suits that might have come out of the window of Lansky's. ... Bass singer Jim Wetherington, known universally as the Big Chief, maintained a steady bottom, ceaselessly jiggling first his left leg, then his right, with the material of the pants leg ballooning out and shimmering. \"He went about as far as you could go in gospel music,\" said Jake Hess. \"The women would jump up, just like they do for the pop shows.\" Preachers frequently objected to the lewd movements ... but audiences reacted with screams and swoons.[316] As a teenager, Presley's musical interests were wide-ranging, and he was deeply informed about both white and African-American musical idioms. Though he never had any formal training, he had a remarkable memory, and his musical knowledge was already considerable by the time he made his first professional recordings aged 19 in 1954. When Jerry Leiber and Mike Stoller met him two years later, they were astonished at his encyclopedic understanding of the blues,[317] and, as Stoller put it, \"He certainly knew a lot more than we did about country music and gospel music.\"[141] At a press conference the following year, he proudly declared, \"I know practically every religious song that's ever been written.\"[132] Presley played guitar, bass, and piano; he received his first guitar when he was 11 years old. He could not read or write music and had no formal lessons, and played everything by ear.[318] Presley often played an instrument on his recordings and produced his own music. Presley played rhythm acoustic guitar on most of his Sun recordings and his 1950s RCA Victor albums. Presley played piano on songs such as \"Old Shep\" and \"First in Line\" from his 1956 album Elvis.[319] He is credited with playing piano on later albums such as From Elvis in Memphis and \"Moody Blue\", and on \"Unchained Melody\", which was one of the last songs that he recorded.[320] Presley played lead guitar on one of his successful singles called \"Are You Lonesome Tonight\".[321] At one point during the '68 Comeback Special, Elvis took over on lead electric guitar, the first time he had ever been seen with the instrument in public, playing it on songs such as \"Baby What You Want Me to Do\" and \"One Night\".[322] The album Elvis is Back! features Presley playing a lot of acoustic guitar on songs such as \"I Will Be Home Again\" and \"Like a Baby\".[323] Presley was a central figure in the development of rockabilly, according to music historians. \"Rockabilly crystallized into a recognizable style in 1954 with Elvis Presley's first release, on the Sun label,\" writes Craig Morrison.[324] Paul Friedlander described rockabilly as \"essentially ... an Elvis Presley construction\", with the defining elements as \"the raw, emotive, and slurred vocal style and emphasis on rhythmic feeling [of] the blues with the string band and strummed rhythm guitar [of] country\".[325] In \"That's All Right\", the Presley trio's first record, Scotty Moore's guitar solo, \"a combination of Merle Travisâstyle country finger-picking, double-stop slides from acoustic boogie, and blues-based bent-note, single-string work, is a microcosm of this fusion\".[325] While Katherine Charlton calls Presley \"rockabilly's originator\",[326] Carl Perkins, another pioneer of rock'n'roll, said that \"[Sam] Phillips, Elvis, and I didn't create rockabilly\".[327] According to Michael Campbell, the first major rockabilly song was recorded by Bill Haley.[328] In Moore's view, \"It had been there for quite a while, really. Carl Perkins was doing basically the same sort of thing up around Jackson, and I know for a fact Jerry Lee Lewis had been playing that kind of music ever since he was ten years old.\"[329] At RCA Victor, Presley's rock and roll sound grew distinct from rockabilly with group chorus vocals, more heavily amplified electric guitars,[330] and a tougher, more intense manner.[331] While he was known for taking songs from various sources and giving them a rockabilly/rock and roll treatment, he also recorded songs in other genres from early in his career, from the pop standard \"Blue Moon\" at Sun Records to the country ballad \"How's the World Treating You?\" on his second RCA Victor LP to the blues of \"Santa Claus Is Back in Town\". In 1957, his first gospel record was released, the four-song EP Peace in the Valley. Certified as a million-seller, it became the top-selling gospel EP in recording history.[332] After his return from military service in 1960, Presley continued to perform rock and roll, but the characteristic style was substantially toned down. His first post-Army single, the number-one hit \"Stuck on You\", is typical of this shift. RCA Victor publicity referred to its \"mild rock beat\"; discographer Ernst Jorgensen calls it \"upbeat pop\".[335] The number five \"She's Not You\" (1962) \"integrates the Jordanaires so completely, it's practically doo-wop\".[336] The modern blues/R&B sound captured with success on Elvis Is Back! was essentially abandoned for six years until such 1966â67 recordings as \"Down in the Alley\" and \"Hi-Heel Sneakers\".[337] Presley's output during most of the 1960s emphasized pop music, often in the form of ballads such as \"Are You Lonesome Tonight?\", a number-one in 1960. \"It's Now or Never\", which also topped the chart that year, was a classically influenced variation of pop based on the Neapolitan song \"'O sole mio\" and concluding with a \"full-voiced operatic cadence\".[338] These were both dramatic numbers, but most of what Presley recorded for his many film soundtracks was in a much lighter vein.[339] While Presley performed several of his classic ballads for the '68 Comeback Special, the sound of the show was dominated by aggressive rock and roll. He recorded few new straight rock and roll songs thereafter; as he explained, they had become \"hard to find\".[340] A significant exception was \"Burning Love\", his last major hit on the pop charts. Like his work of the 1950s, Presley's subsequent recordings reworked pop and country songs, but in markedly different permutations. His stylistic range now began to embrace a more contemporary rock sound as well as soul and funk. Much of Elvis in Memphis, as well as \"Suspicious Minds\", cut at the same sessions, reflected this new rock and soul fusion. In the mid-1970s, many of his singles found a home on country radio, the field where he first became a star.[341] The developmental arc of Presley's singing voice, as described by critic Dave Marsh, goes from \"high and thrilled in the early days, [to] lower and perplexed in the final months.\"[342] Marsh credits Presley with the introduction of the \"vocal stutter\" on 1955's \"Baby Let's Play House\".[343] When on \"Don't Be Cruel\", Presley \"slides into a 'mmmmm' that marks the transition between the first two verses,\" he shows \"how masterful his relaxed style really is.\"[344] Marsh describes the vocal performance on \"Can't Help Falling in Love\" as one of \"gentle insistence and delicacy of phrasing\", with the line \"'Shall I stay' pronounced as if the words are fragile as crystal\".[345] Jorgensen calls the 1966 recording of \"How Great Thou Art\" \"an extraordinary fulfillment of his vocal ambitions\", as Presley \"crafted for himself an ad-hoc arrangement in which he took every part of the four-part vocal, from [the] bass intro to the soaring heights of the song's operatic climax\", becoming \"a kind of one-man quartet\".[346] Guralnick finds \"Stand by Me\" from the same gospel sessions \"a beautifully articulated, almost nakedly yearning performance\", but, by contrast, feels that Presley reaches beyond his powers on \"Where No One Stands Alone\", resorting \"to a kind of inelegant bellowing to push out a sound\" that Jake Hess of the Statesmen Quartet had in his command. Hess himself thought that while others might have voices the equal of Presley's, \"he had that certain something that everyone searches for all during their lifetime.\"[347] Guralnick attempts to pinpoint that something: \"The warmth of his voice, his controlled use of both vibrato technique and natural falsetto range, the subtlety and deeply felt conviction of his singing were all qualities recognizably belonging to his talent but just as recognizably not to be achieved without sustained dedication and effort.\"[348] Marsh praises his 1968 reading of \"U.S. Male\", \"bearing down on the hard guy lyrics, not sending them up or overplaying them but tossing them around with that astonishingly tough yet gentle assurance that he brought to his Sun records.\"[349] The performance on \"In the Ghetto\" is, according to Jorgensen, \"devoid of any of his characteristic vocal tricks or mannerisms\", instead relying on the exceptional \"clarity and sensitivity of his voice\".[350] Guralnick describes the song's delivery as of \"almost translucent eloquence ... so quietly confident in its simplicity\".[351] On \"Suspicious Minds\", Guralnick hears essentially the same \"remarkable mixture of tenderness and poise\", but supplemented with \"an expressive quality somewhere between stoicism (at suspected infidelity) and anguish (over impending loss)\".[352] Music critic Henry Pleasants observes that \"Presley has been described variously as a baritone and a tenor. An extraordinary compass ... and a very wide range of vocal color have something to do with this divergence of opinion.\"[353] He identifies Presley as a high baritone, calculating his range as two octaves and a third, \"from the baritone low G to the tenor high B, with an upward extension in falsetto to at least a D-flat. Presley's best octave is in the middle, D-flat to D-flat, granting an extra full step up or down.\"[353] In Pleasants' view, his voice was \"variable and unpredictable\" at the bottom, \"often brilliant\" at the top, with the capacity for \"full-voiced high Gs and As that an opera baritone might envy\".[353] Scholar Lindsay Waters, who figures Presley's range as two-and-a-quarter octaves, emphasizes that \"his voice had an emotional range from tender whispers to sighs down to shouts, grunts, grumbles, and sheer gruffness that could move the listener from calmness and surrender, to fear. His voice can not be measured in octaves, but in decibels; even that misses the problem of how to measure delicate whispers that are hardly audible at all.\"[354] Presley was always \"able to duplicate the open, hoarse, ecstatic, screaming, shouting, wailing, reckless sound of the black rhythm-and-blues and gospel singers\", writes Pleasants, and also demonstrated a remarkable ability to assimilate many other vocal styles.[353] When Dewey Phillips first aired \"That's All Right\" on Memphis' WHBQ, many listeners who contacted the station to ask for it again assumed that its singer was black.[49] From the beginning of his national fame, Presley expressed respect for African-American performers and their music, and disregard for the segregation and racial prejudice then prevalent in the South. Interviewed in 1956, he recalled how in his childhood he would listen to blues musician Arthur Crudupâthe originator of \"That's All Right\"â\"bang his box the way I do now, and I said if I ever got to the place where I could feel all old Arthur felt, I'd be a music man like nobody ever saw.\"[35] The Memphis World, an African-American newspaper, reported that Presley \"cracked Memphis' segregation laws\" by attending the local amusement park on what was designated as its \"colored night\".[35] Such statements and actions led Presley to be generally hailed in the black community during his early stardom.[35] In contrast, many white adults \"did not like him, and condemned him as depraved. Anti-negro prejudice doubtless figured in adult antagonism. Regardless of whether parents were aware of the Negro sexual origins of the phrase 'rock 'n' roll', Presley impressed them as the visual and aural embodiment of sex.\"[6] Despite the largely positive view of Presley held by African Americans, a rumor spread in mid-1957 that he had announced, \"The only thing Negroes can do for me is buy my records and shine my shoes.\" A journalist with the national African American weekly Jet, Louie Robinson, pursued the story. On the set of Jailhouse Rock, Presley granted Robinson an interview, though he was no longer dealing with the mainstream press. He denied making such a statement: I never said anything like that, and people who know me know that I wouldn't have said it. ... A lot of people seem to think I started this business. But rock 'n' roll was here a long time before I came along. Nobody can sing that kind of music like colored people. Let's face it: I can't sing like Fats Domino can. I know that.[355] Robinson found no evidence that the remark had ever been made, and elicited testimony from many individuals indicating that Presley was anything but racist.[35][356] Blues singer Ivory Joe Hunter, who had heard the rumor before he visited Graceland, reported of Presley, \"He showed me every courtesy, and I think he's one of the greatest.\"[357] Though the rumored remark was discredited, it was still being used against Presley decades later.[358] The persistence of such attitudes was fueled by resentment over the fact that Presley, whose musical and visual performance idiom owed much to African-American sources, achieved the cultural acknowledgement and commercial success largely denied his black peers.[356] Into the twenty-first century, the notion that Presley had \"stolen\" black music still found adherents.[359][358][360] Notable among African-American entertainers expressly rejecting this view was Jackie Wilson, who argued, \"A lot of people have accused Elvis of stealing the black man's music, when in fact, almost every black solo entertainer copied his stage mannerisms from Elvis.\"[361] Moreover, Presley acknowledged his debt to African-American musicians throughout his career. Addressing his '68 Comeback Special audience, he said, \"Rock 'n' roll music is basically gospel or rhythm and blues, or it sprang from that. People have been adding to it, adding instruments to it, experimenting with it, but it all boils down to [that].\"[362] Nine years earlier, he had said, \"Rock 'n' roll has been around for many years. It used to be called rhythm and blues.\"[363] Presley's physical attractiveness and sexual appeal were widely acknowledged. \"He was once beautiful, astonishingly beautiful\", according to critic Mark Feeney.[364] Television director Steve Binder reported, \"I'm straight as an arrow and I got to tell you, you stop, whether you're male or female, to look at him. He was that good looking. And if you never knew he was a superstar, it wouldn't make any difference; if he'd walked in the room, you'd know somebody special was in your presence.\"[365] His performance style was equally responsible for Presley's eroticized image. Critic George Melly described him as \"the master of the sexual simile, treating his guitar as both phallus and girl\".[366] In his Presley obituary, Lester Bangs credited him with bringing \"overt blatant vulgar sexual frenzy to the popular arts in America\".[367] Ed Sullivan's declaration that he perceived a soda bottle in Presley's trousers was echoed by rumors involving a similarly positioned toilet roll tube or lead bar.[368] While Presley was marketed as an icon of heterosexuality, some critics have argued that his image was ambiguous. In 1959, Sight and Sound's Peter John Dyer described his onscreen persona as \"aggressively bisexual in appeal\".[369] Brett Farmer places the \"orgasmic gyrations\" of the title dance sequence in Jailhouse Rock within a lineage of cinematic musical numbers that offer a \"spectacular eroticization, if not homoeroticization, of the male image\".[370] In the analysis of Yvonne Tasker, \"Elvis was an ambivalent figure who articulated a peculiar feminised, objectifying version of white working-class masculinity as aggressive sexual display.\"[371] Reinforcing Presley's image as a sex symbol were the reports of his dalliances with Hollywood stars and starlets, from Natalie Wood in the 1950s to Connie Stevens and Ann-Margret in the 1960s to Candice Bergen and Cybill Shepherd in the 1970s. June Juanico of Memphis, one of Presley's early girlfriends, later blamed Parker for encouraging him to choose his dating partners with publicity in mind.[206] Presley never grew comfortable with the Hollywood scene, and most of these relationships were insubstantial.[372] I know he invented rock and roll, in a manner of speaking, but ... that's not why he's worshiped as a god today. He's worshiped as a god today because in addition to inventing rock and roll he was the greatest ballad singer this side of Frank Sinatraâbecause the spiritual translucence and reined-in gut sexuality of his slow weeper and torchy pop blues still activate the hormones and slavish devotion of millions of female human beings worldwide. Presley's rise to national attention in 1956 transformed the field of popular music and had a huge effect on the broader scope of popular culture.[374] As the catalyst for the cultural revolution that was rock and roll, he was central not only to defining it as a musical genre but in making it a touchstone of youth culture and rebellious attitude.[375] With its racially mixed originsârepeatedly affirmed by Presleyârock and roll's occupation of a central position in mainstream American culture facilitated a new acceptance and appreciation of black culture.[376] In this regard, Little Richard said of Presley, \"He was an integrator. Elvis was a blessing. They wouldn't let black music through. He opened the door for black music.\"[377] Al Green agreed: \"He broke the ice for all of us.\"[378] President Jimmy Carter remarked on Presley's legacy in 1977: \"His music and his personality, fusing the styles of white country and black rhythm and blues, permanently changed the face of American popular culture.\"[281] Presley also heralded the vastly expanded reach of celebrity in the era of mass communication: within a year of his first appearance on American network television, he was regarded as one of the most famous people in the world.[379] Presley's name, image, and voice are recognized around the world.[380] He has inspired a legion of impersonators.[381] In polls and surveys, he is recognized as one of the most important popular music artists and influential Americans.[e] American composer and conductor Leonard Bernstein said, \"Elvis Presley is the greatest cultural force in the twentieth century. He introduced the beat to everything and he changed everythingâmusic, language, clothes.\"[390] John Lennon said that \"Nothing really affected me until Elvis.\"[391] Bob Dylan described the sensation of first hearing Presley as \"like busting out of jail\".[378] For much of his adult life, Presley, with his rise from poverty to riches and fame, had seemed to epitomize the American Dream.[392][393] In his final years, and following the revelations about his circumstances after his death, he became a symbol of excess and gluttony.[394][395] Increasing attention was paid to his appetite for the rich, heavy Southern cooking of his upbringing, foods such as chicken-fried steak and biscuits and gravy.[396][397] In particular, his love of fried peanut butter, banana, and (sometimes) bacon sandwiches,[398][396] now known as \"Elvis sandwiches\",[399] came to symbolize this characteristic.[400] Since 1977, there have been numerous alleged sightings of Presley. A long-standing conspiracy theory among some fans is that he faked his death.[401][402] Adherents cite alleged discrepancies in the death certificate, reports of a wax dummy in his original coffin, and accounts of Presley planning a diversion so he could retire in peace.[403] An unusually large number of fans have domestic shrines devoted to Presley and journey to sites with which he is connected, however faintly.[404] On the anniversary of his death, thousands of people gather outside Graceland for a candlelight ritual.[405] \"With Elvis, it is not just his music that has survived death\", writes Ted Harrison. \"He himself has been raised, like a medieval saint, to a figure of cultic status. It is as if he has been canonized by acclamation.\"[404] On the 25th anniversary of Presley's death, The New York Times asserted: All the talentless impersonators and appalling black velvet paintings on display can make him seem little more than a perverse and distant memory. But before Elvis was camp, he was its opposite: a genuine cultural force. ... Elvis' breakthroughs are underappreciated because in this rock-and-roll age, his hard-rocking music and sultry style have triumphed so completely.[406] He was ranked third on Rolling Stone's list of greatest artists. Bono wrote in appreciation: In Elvis, you have the blueprint for rock & roll. The highness â the gospel highs. The mud â the Delta mud, the blues. Sexual liberation. Controversy. Changing the way people feel about the world. It's all there with Elvis.[407] Not only Presley's achievements but his failings as well, are seen by some cultural observers as adding to the power of his legacy, as in this description by Greil Marcus: Elvis Presley is a supreme figure in American life, one whose presence, no matter how banal or predictable, brooks no real comparisons. ... The cultural range of his music has expanded to the point where it includes not only the hits of the day, but also patriotic recitals, pure country gospel, and really dirty blues. ... Elvis has emerged as a great artist, a great rocker, a great purveyor of schlock, a great heart throb, a great bore, a great symbol of potency, a great ham, a great nice person, and, yes, a great American.[408] With a billion estimated record sales, Guinness World Records ranks Presley as the best-selling solo artist of all time.[b] Presley's rankings for top ten and number-one hits vary depending on how the double-sided \"Hound Dog/Don't Be Cruel\" and \"Don't/I Beg of You\" singles, which precede the inception of Billboard's unified Hot 100 chart, are analyzed.[f] According to Whitburn's analysis, Presley holds the record with 38, tying with Madonna;[413] per Billboard's current assessment, he ranks second with 36.[414] Whitburn and Billboard concur that the Beatles hold the record for most number-one hits with 20, and that Mariah Carey is second with 19.[415] Whitburn has Presley with 18:[413] Billboard has him third with 17.[416] According to Billboard, Presley has 79 cumulative weeks at number one: alone at 80, according to Whitburn and the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame,[417][418] with only Mariah Carey having more with 91 weeks.[419] He holds the records for most number-one singles on the UK chart with 21 and singles reaching the top ten with 76.[420][421] As an album artist, Presley is credited by Billboard with the record for the most albums charting in the Billboard 200: 129, far ahead of second-place Frank Sinatra's 82. He also holds the record for most cumulative weeks at number one on the Billboard 200 for a male solo artists: 67 weeks[422] In 2015 and 2016, two albums setting Presley's vocals against music by the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra, If I Can Dream and The Wonder of You, both reached number one in the UK. This gave him a new record for number-one UK albums by a solo artist with 13, and extended his record for longest span between number-one albums by anybodyâPresley had first topped the British chart in 1956 with his self-titled debut.[423] As of 2023[update], the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) credits Presley with 146.5 million certified album sales in the US, third all time behind the Beatles and Garth Brooks.[424] He holds the records for most gold albums (101, nearly double second-place Barbra Streisand's 51),[425] and most platinum albums (57).[426] His 25 multi-platinum albums is second behind the Beatles' 26.[427] His total of 197 album certification awards (including one diamond award), far outpaces the Beatles' second-best 122.[428] He has the 9th-most gold singles (54, tied with Justin Bieber),[429] and the 16th-most platinum singles (27).[430] In 2012, the spider Paradonea presleyi was named in his honor.[431] In 2018, President Donald Trump awarded Presley the Presidential Medal of Freedom posthumously.[432] There is a street named after Presley in San Antonio, Texas.[433] A vast number of recordings have been issued under Presley's name. The number of his original master recordings has been variously calculated as 665[434] and 711.[364] Studio albums Soundtrack albums (original material) The correct spelling of his middle name has long been a matter of debate. The physician who delivered him wrote \"Elvis Aaron Presley\" in his ledger.[3] The state-issued birth certificate reads \"Elvis Aron Presley\". The name was chosen after the Presleys' friend and fellow congregation member Aaron Kennedy, though a single-A spelling was probably intended by Presley's parents to parallel the middle name of Presley's stillborn brother, Jesse Garon.[4] It reads Aron on most official documents produced during his lifetime, including his high school diploma, RCA Victor record contract, and marriage license, and this was generally taken to be the proper spelling.[5] In 1966, Presley expressed the desire to his father that the more traditional biblical rendering, Aaron, be used henceforth, \"especially on legal documents\".[3] Five years later, the Jaycees citation honoring him as one of the country's Outstanding Young Men used Aaron. Late in his life, he sought to officially change the spelling to Aaron and discovered that state records already listed it that way. Knowing his wishes for his middle name, Aaron is the spelling his father chose for Presley's tombstone, and it is the spelling his estate has designated as official.[5]",

See additional information The incredible Elvis Presley life story began when Elvis Aaron Presley was born to Vernon and Gladys Presley in a two-room house in Tupelo, Mississippi, on January 8, 1935. His twin brother, Jessie Garon, was stillborn, leaving Elvis to grow up as an only child. He and his parents moved to Memphis, Tennessee, in 1948, and Elvis graduated from Humes High School there in 1953. Elvisâ musical influences were the pop and country music of the time, the gospel music he heard in church and at the all-night gospel sings he frequently attended, and the black R&B he absorbed on historic Beale Street as a Memphis teenager. In 1954, Elvis began his singing career with the legendary Sun Records label in Memphis. In late 1955, his recording contract was sold to RCA Victor. By 1956, he was an international sensation. With a sound and style that uniquely combined his diverse musical influences and blurred and challenged the social and racial barriers of the time, he ushered in a whole new era of American music and popular culture. Here are a few Elvis Presley facts: he starred in 33 successful films, made history with his television appearances and specials, and knew great acclaim through his many, often record-breaking, live concert performances on tour and in Las Vegas. Globally, he has sold over one billion records, more than any other artist. His American sales have earned him gold, platinum or multi-platinum awards. Among his many achievements were 14 Grammy nominations (3 wins) from the National Academy of Recording Arts & Sciences, the Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award which he received at age 36, and his being named One of the Ten Outstanding Young Men of the Nation for 1970 by the United States Jaycees. Without any of the special privileges, his celebrity status might have afforded him, Elvis honorably served his country in the U.S. Army. His talent, good looks, sensuality, charisma, and good humor endeared him to millions, as did the humility and human kindness he demonstrated throughout his life. Known the world over by his first name, he is regarded as one of the most important figures of twentieth century popular culture. Elvis died at his Memphis home, Graceland, on August 16, 1977. He was 42. This brief Elvis Presley biography doesnât begin to fully capture the personality of the king.

                "content": "Elvis Aaron Presley (January 8, 1935 â August 16, 1977) was an American singer, musician and actor. He is widely considered as one of the most influential and most famous musicians of the 20th century, widely regarded as one of the 20th centuryâs greatest cultural icons. Presley is one of the biggest selling musical artists of all time.[2] He was one of the first and the most famous recording artist in rock and roll music. He also starred in over 30 movies. His global fame has continued till today almost 47 years after his death. Heâs considered by many to be one of the most popular men in history.[3] He is so popular that some people know him as only \"Elvis\". He is also referred to as the \"King of Rock and Roll\", or simply \"The King\". Presley was born in Tupelo, Mississippi. He and his family moved to Memphis, Tennessee, when he was 13 years old. His music career began there in 1954. He first started to work with Sam Phillips who was the owner of Sun Records. RCA Victor acquired his contract in a deal arranged by Colonel Tom Parker. Presley's first RCA single, \"Heartbreak Hotel\" was released in January 1956. It was a number-one hit in the US. Presley became the leading figure of rock and roll after many TV appearances and chart-topping records. His energetic attitude towards his music and his performance style, made him very popularâand controversial. In November 1956, he made his film debut in Love Me Tender. In 1958, he was drafted into military service. When he resumed his recording career two years later, he made some of his most successful work. In the 1960s, Presley gave most of his time to making Hollywood movies. After a long seven-year break from live performances, he returned to the stage in 1968. In 1973, Presley was featured in the first globally broadcast concert. Several years of prescription drug abuse damaged his health, and he died in 1977 at the age of 42. Before Presley died, he had type 2 diabetes, Hypertension and Cholesterol that he was diagnosed with on April 29, 1974, due to his weight gain and after a medical check-up Elvis Aaron Presley was born on January 8, 1935 in Tupelo, Mississippi to 18-year-old Vernon Elvis Presley and 22-year-old Gladys Love Presley (born Smith), in the two-room shotgun house built by Vernon's father in preparation for the child's birth. Jesse Aaron Presley, his identical twin brother, was delivered stillborn 35 minutes before him. As an only child, Presley became close to both parents and formed an unusually tight bond with his mother. The family attended an Assembly of God church, where he found his initial musical inspiration. Presley's ancestry was primarily a Western European mix: on his mother's side, he was Scots-Irish, with some French Norman; one of Gladys' great-great-grandmothers was Cherokee. According to a third cousin of Presley's, one of Gladys's great-grandmothers was Jewish. There is no evidence that Presley or his mother shared this belief in a Jewish heritage. Syndicated columnist Nate Bloom has challenged the cousin's account, which he calls a \"tall tale\". Presley's father's forebears were of Scottish[4] and German ancestry. Gladys was regarded by relatives and friends as the dominant member of the small family. Vernon moved from one odd job to the next, evidencing little ambition. The family often relied on help from neighbors and government food assistance. The Presleys survived the F5 tornado in the 1936 Tupelo-Gainesville tornado outbreak. In 1938, they lost their home after Vernon was found guilty of altering a check written by the landowner. He was jailed for eight months, and Gladys and Elvis moved in with relatives. He moved to Memphis, Tennessee with his family when he was 13 years old. Presley was one of the first musicians to play a type of music called rock and roll, which combined rhythm and blues with country music. His first No. 1 hit, \"Heartbreak Hotel\", was released in 1956, and was one of the first popular rock and roll songs. Presley entered the military in 1958, and was stationed in Germany. He was honorably discharged from the military, and returned to the United States in 1960. In Germany, he met Priscilla Beaulieu, whom he married in 1967. They had a female child which they named Lisa Marie (who was married to pop singer MJ). In 1973, Priscilla and Elvis divorced. By this point, he was addicted to many prescription drugs. Presleyâs personal doctor was George C. Nichopoulos who was of Greek descent. In November 2018, Presley received posthumous the Presidential Medal of Freedom from President Donald Trump.[5] His daughter Lisa Marie Presley was found dead on January 12, 2023 in Calabasas. Presley's rise to enormous worldwide success in 1956 changed the field of popular music forever. It also had a great effect on popular culture. Presley was one of the first celebrities in the era of mass communication: at age 21, within a year of his first appearance on the American television network, he was already one of the most famous men in the world. He is one of the best-selling music artists in history, with worldwide sales of 500 million records,[6] His name, image and voice are instantly recognizable worldwide. It has inspired many imitators. Being an Elvis impersonator can be a professional job. In polls and surveys, he is recognized as one of the most important and influential American musical artists. On August 16, 1977, Presley was scheduled on an evening flight out of Memphis to Portland, Maine, to begin another tour. That afternoon, however, his fiancÃ©e Ginger Alden discovered him unresponsive on the bathroom floor of his Graceland mansion. Attempts to revive him failed and he died on August 16, 1977 from heart disease by drug intoxication. He was discovered dead in his bathroom.",

                "content": "Our editors will review what youâve submitted and determine whether to revise the article. Producer Sam Phillips at Sun Records, a local blues label, was the first to record Elvis Presley. He responded to Presley's audition tape with a phone call, and several week's of recording sessions ensued with a band consisting of Presley, guitarist Scotty Moore, and bassist Bill Black. Their repertoire consisted of blues and country songs and gospel hymns. Graceland is Elvis Presley's estate in Memphis, Tennessee, and remains one of the the U.S.'s top tourist attractions. Elvis Presley died of a heart attack in 1977 brought on largely by drug abuse. He was 42 years old. In early 1958 Elvis Presley was drafted by the U.S. Army. Presley returned from the army in 1960, where he had served as a soldier in Germany rather than joining the Special Services entertainment division. Colonel Tom Parker was a Dutch-born American show business promoter who was best known for managing the career of Elvis Presley. Elvis Presley (born January 8, 1935, Tupelo, Mississippi, U.S.âdied August 16, 1977, Memphis, Tennessee) was an American popular singer widely known as the âKing of Rock and Rollâ and one of rock musicâs dominant performers from the mid-1950s until his death. Presley grew up dirt-poor in Tupelo, Mississippi, moved to Memphis as a teenager, and, with his family, was off welfare for only a few weeks when producer Sam Phillips at Sun Records, a local blues label, responded to his audition tape with a phone call. Several weeks worth of recording sessions ensued with a band consisting of Presley, guitarist Scotty Moore, and bassist Bill Black. Their repertoire consisted of the kind of material for which Presley would become famous: blues and country songs, Tin Pan Alley ballads, and gospel hymns. Presley knew some of this music from the radio, some of it from his parentsâ Pentecostal church and the group sings he attended at the Rev. H.W. Brewsterâs Black Memphis church, and some of it from the Beale Street blues clubs he began frequenting as a teenager. Presley was already a flamboyant personality, with relatively long greased-back hair and wild-colored clothing combinations, but his full musical personality did not emerge until he and the band began playing with blues singer Arthur (âBig Boyâ) Crudupâs song âThatâs All Right Mamaâ in July 1954. They arrived at a startling synthesis, eventually dubbed rockabilly, retaining many of the originalâs blues inflections but with Presleyâs high tenor voice adding a lighter touch and with the basic rhythm striking a much more supple groove. This sound was the hallmark of the five singles Presley released on Sun over the next year. Although none of them became a national hit, by August 1955, when he released the fifth, âMystery Train,â arguably his greatest record ever, he had attracted a substantial Southern following for his recordings, his live appearances in regional roadhouses and clubs, and his radio performances on the nationally aired Louisiana Hayride. (A key musical change came when drummer D.J. Fontana was added, first for the Hayride shows but also on records beginning with âMystery Train.â) Presleyâs management was then turned over to Colonel Tom Parker, a country music hustler who had made stars of Eddy Arnold and Hank Snow. Parker arranged for Presleyâs song catalog and recording contract to be sold to major New York City-based enterprises, Hill and Range and RCA Victor, respectively. Sun received a total of $35,000; Elvis got $5,000. He began recording at RCAâs studios in Nashville, Tennessee, with a somewhat larger group of musicians but still including Moore, Black, and Fontana, and began to create a national sensation with a series of hits: âHeartbreak Hotel,â âDonât Be Cruel,â and âLove Me Tenderâ (all 1956), âAll Shook Upâ (1957), and more. From 1956 through 1958 he completely dominated the pop music charts and ushered in the age of rock and roll, opening doors for both white and Black rock artists. His television appearances, especially those on Ed Sullivanâs Sunday night variety show, set records for the size of the audiences. Even his films, a few slight vehicles, were box office smashes. Presley became the teen idol of his decade, greeted everywhere by screaming hordes of young women, and, when it was announced in early 1958 that he had been drafted and would enter the U.S. Army, there was that rarest of all pop culture events, a moment of true grief. More important, he served as the great cultural catalyst of his period. Elvis projected a mixed vision of humility and self-confidence, of intense commitment and comic disbelief in his ability to inspire frenzy. He inspired literally thousands of musiciansâinitially those more or less like-minded Southerners, from Jerry Lee Lewis and Carl Perkins on down, who were the first generation of rockabillies, and, later, people who had far different combinations of musical and cultural influences and ambitions. From John Lennon to Bruce Springsteen, Bob Dylan to Prince, it was impossible to think of a rock star of any importance who did not owe an explicit debt to Presley. Beyond even that, Presley inspired his audience. âIt was like he whispered his dream in all our ears and then we dreamed it,â said Springsteen at the time of Presleyâs death. You did not have to want to be a rock and roll star or even a musician to want to be like Elvisâwhich meant, ultimately, to be free and uninhibited and yet still a part of the everyday. Literally millions of peopleâan entire generation or twoâdefined their sense of personal style and ambition in terms that Elvis first personified. As a result, he was anything but universally adored. Those who did not worship him found him despicable (no one found him ignorable). Preachers and pundits declared him an anathema, his Pentecostally derived hip-swinging stage style and breathy vocal asides obscene. Racists denounced him for mingling Black music with white (and Presley was always scrupulous in crediting his Black sources, one of the things that made him different from the Tin Pan Alley writers and singers who had for decades lifted Black musical styles without credit). He was pronounced responsible for all teenage hooliganism and juvenile delinquency. Yet, in every appearance on television, he appeared affable, polite, and soft-spoken, almost shy. It was only with a band at his back and a beat in his ear that he became âElvis the Pelvis.â In 1959, while stationed in West Germanyâwhere he served as a soldier rather than joining the Special Services entertainment divisionâPresley met Priscilla Beaulieu, who was 14 years old at the time (Presley was 24). They started a romantic relationship that continued after Presley returned to the United States in 1960. When he resumed his musical career, those who regarded him as commercial hype without talent expected him to fade away. Instead, he continued to have hits from recordings stockpiled just before he entered the army. Presley picked up pretty much where he had left off, churning out a series of more than 30 movies (from Blue Hawaii [1961] to Change of Habit [1969]) over the next eight years, almost none of which fit any genre other than âElvis movie,â which meant a light comedic romance with musical interludes. Most had accompanying soundtrack albums, and together the movies and the records made him a rich man, although they nearly ruined him as any kind of artist. Presley did his best work in the 1960s on singles either unconnected to the films or only marginally stuck into them, recordings such as âItâs Now or Never (âO Sole Mioâ)â (1960), âAre You Lonesome Tonight?â and âLittle Sisterâ (both 1961), âCanât Help Falling in Loveâ and âReturn to Senderâ (both 1962), and âViva Las Vegasâ (1964). Presley was no longer a controversial figure: he had become one more predictable mass entertainer, a personage of virtually no interest to the rock audience that had expanded so much with the advent of the new sounds of the Beatles, the Rolling Stones, and Bob Dylan. By 1968 the changes in the music world had overtaken Presleyâboth movie grosses and record sales had fallen. In December his one-man Christmas TV special aired: a tour de force of rock and roll and rhythm and blues, it restored much of his dissipated credibility. In 1969 he released a single having nothing to do with a film, âSuspicious Mindsâ; it went to number one. He also began doing concerts again and quickly won back a sizable following, although it was not nearly as universal as his audience in the 1950s; in the main, it was Southern and Midwestern, working-class, and overwhelmingly female. For much of the next decade, he was again one of the top live attractions in the United States. (For a variety of reasons, he never performed outside North America.) Presley was now a mainstream American entertainer, an icon but not so much an idol. In 1967 he married Priscilla Beaulieu without much furor. The next year he became a parent with the birth of their daughter, Lisa Marie Presley. Elvis Presley and Priscilla Presley eventually grew apart separating in 1972 and divorcing the following year. Presley made no more movies, although there was a good concert film, Elvis on Tour (1972). His recordings were of uneven quality, but on each album he included a song or two that had focus and energy. Hit songs were harder to come byââSuspicious Mindsâ was his last number one and âBurning Loveâ (1972) his final Top Ten entry. But, thanks to concerts, spectaculars best described by critic Jon Landau as an apotheosis of American musical comedy, he remained a big money earner. He now lacked the ambition and power of his early work, but that may have been a good thing: he never seemed a dated relic of the 1950s trying to catch up to trends but was just a performer, unrelentingly himself. However, Presley had also developed a lethal lifestyle. Spending almost all his time when not on the road in Graceland, his Memphis estate (actually just a big Southern colonial house decorated somewhere between banal modernity and garish faux-Vegas opulence), he lived nocturnally, surrounded by sycophants and stuffed with greasy foods and a variety of prescription drugs. His shows deteriorated in the final two years of his life, and his recording career came to a virtual standstill. Presley never seemed confident in his status, never entirely certain that he would not collapse back into sharecropper poverty, and, as a result, he seems to have become immobilized; the man who had risked everything, including potential ridicule, to make himself a success now lived in the lockstep regimen of an addict and recluse. Finally, in the summer of 1977, the night before he was to begin yet another concert tour, he died of a heart attack brought on largely by drug abuse. He was 42 years old. Almost immediately upon hearing of his death, mourners from around the world gathered at Graceland to say farewell to the poor boy who had lived out the American dream. In a way, that mourning has never ceased: Graceland remains one of the countryâs top tourist attractions, and Presleyâs albums and other artifacts continue to sell briskly. Each August crowds flock to Gracelandâwhich, under the direction of Priscilla Presley, first opened to the public in 1982âto honor him on the anniversary not of his birth but of his death. From time to time, rumors cropped up that he did not really die, that his death was a fake designed to free him from fame. Elvis impersonators are legion. His biggest fansâworking-class white women, almost exclusivelyâpassed their fanaticism on to their children, or at least to a surprising number of daughters. âElvis has left the building,â but those who are still inside have decided to carry on regardless. Once more, Elvis Presley is triumphant, although this triumph is shadowed by something far less than happiness.",

                "title": "Gulf Coast of the United States - Wikipedia",
                "content": "The Gulf Coast of the United States, also known as the Gulf South or the South Coast, is the coastline along the Southern United States where they meet the Gulf of Mexico. The coastal states that have a shoreline on the Gulf of Mexico are Texas, Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama, and Florida, and these are known as the Gulf States.[2] The economy of the Gulf Coast area is dominated by industries related to energy, petrochemicals, fishing, aerospace, agriculture, and tourism. The large cities of the region are (from west to east) Brownsville, Corpus Christi, Houston, Galveston, Beaumont, Lake Charles, Lafayette, Baton Rouge, New Orleans, Gulfport, Biloxi, Mobile, Pensacola, Panama City, St. Petersburg, and Tampa. All are the centers or major cities of their respective metropolitan areas and many of which contain large ports. The Gulf Coast is made of many inlets, bays, and lagoons. The coast is intersected by numerous rivers, the largest of which is the Mississippi River. Much of the land along the Gulf Coast is, or was, marshland.[3] Ringing the Gulf Coast is the Gulf Coastal Plain, which reaches from Southern Texas to the western Florida Panhandle, while the western portions of the Gulf Coast are made up of many barrier islands and peninsulas, including the 130-mile (210 km) Padre Island along the Texas coast. These landforms protect numerous bays and inlets providing as a barrier to oncoming waves. The central part of the Gulf Coast, from eastern Texas through Louisiana, consists primarily of marshland. The eastern part of the Gulf Coast, predominantly Florida, is dotted with many bays and inlets. The Gulf Coast climate is humid subtropical, although Southwest Florida features a tropical climate. Much of the year is warm to hot along the Gulf Coast, while the three winter months bring periods of cool (or rarely, cold) weather mixed with mild temperatures. The area is highly vulnerable to hurricanes as well as floods and severe thunderstorms. Much of the Gulf Coast has a summer precipitation maximum, with July or August commonly the wettest month due to the combination of frequent summer thunderstorms produced by relentless heat and humidity, and tropical weather systems, including tropical depressions, tropical storms, and hurricanes, while winter and early spring rainfall also can be heavy. This pattern is evident in southern cites as Houston, New Orleans, Mobile, Alabama, and Pensacola, Florida. However, the central and southern Florida peninsula and South Texas has a pronounced winter dry season, as at Tampa and Fort Myers. On the central and southern Texas coast, winter, early spring and mid-summer are markedly drier, and September is the wettest month on average at Corpus Christi and Brownsville, Texas. Tornadoes are infrequent at the coast but do occur; however, they occur more frequently in inland portions of Gulf Coast states. Over most of the Gulf Coast from Houston, Texas, eastward, extreme rainfall events are a significant threat, commonly from tropical weather systems, which can bring 4 to 10 or more inches of rain in a single day. In August 2017, Hurricane Harvey made landfall along the central Texas coast, then migrated to and stalled over the greater Houston area for several days, producing extreme, unprecedented rainfall totals of over 40 inches (1,000 mm) in many areas, unleashing widespread flooding. Climate scientists predict more hurricanes for Florida[4] and the Texas coastline in particular.[5] Earthquakes are extremely rare to the area, but a 6.0 earthquake in the Gulf of Mexico on September 10, 2006, could be felt from the cities of New Orleans to Tampa. Due to the release of greenhouse gas emissions, glaciers and ice sheets are melting and expanding the oceans. The United States coastlines are projected to rise 1 foot in three decades or between 10 and 12 inches on average by 2050.[6] The Gulf Coast will likely see the biggest change, with sea levels expected to rise between 14 and 18 inches. The Global and Regional Sea Level Rise Report predicted more frequent, major and destructive high tide flooding events along with taller storm surges by 2050 after scientists determined high tide flooding has been \"increasingly common\" over the past few years due to the rising sea levels.[6] The impacts are expected to be dramatic. Low-lying coastal areas are expected to experience multiple factors, including increased levels of flooding, accelerated erosion, loss of wetlands and low-lying terrestrial ecosystems, and seawater intrusion into freshwater sources. Rising sea level and erosion will also imperil critical habitats for many commercially important fisheries that depend on inshore waters for either permanent residence or nursery area.[7] In 2021 alone rising sea levels cost the United States approximately $2.6 billion in relief efforts and caused at least seven deaths.[6] By 2051, the cost of flood damage is expected to increase by 61%, or $32 billion.[8] The Gulf Coast is a major center of economic activity. The marshlands along the Louisiana and Texas coasts provide breeding grounds and nurseries for ocean life that drive the fishing and shrimping industries. The Port of South Louisiana (Metropolitan New Orleans in Laplace) and the Port of Houston are two of the ten busiest ports in the world by cargo volume.[9] As of 2004, seven of the top ten busiest ports in the U.S. are on the Gulf Coast.[10] The discovery of oil and gas deposits along the coast and offshore, combined with easy access to shipping, have made the Gulf Coast the heart of the U.S. petrochemical industry. The coast contains nearly 4,000 oil platforms. Besides the above, the region features other important industries including aerospace and biomedical research, as well as older industries such as agriculture and â especially since the development of the Gulf Coast beginning in the 1920s and the increase in wealth throughout the United States â tourism. Hurricane Katrina and Hurricane Rita have destroyed a number of museums and archives in the Gulf Coast. In 2008 floods in Iowa destroyed the local Flood Museum which held materials from the Great Mississippi and Missouri Rivers Flood of 1993.[11] Before European settlers arrived in the region, the Gulf Coast was home to several pre-Columbian kingdoms which had extensive trade networks with empires such as the Aztecs and the Mississippi Mound Builders. Shark and alligator teeth and shells from the Gulf have been found as far north as Ohio, in the mounds of the Hopewell culture.[12] The first Europeans to settle the Gulf Coast were primarily the French and the Spanish. The Louisiana Purchase (1803), AdamsâOnÃ­s Treaty (1819) and the Texas Revolution (1835â1836) made the Gulf Coast a part of the United States during the first half of the 19th century. As the U.S. population continued to expand its frontiers westward, the Gulf Coast was a natural magnet in the South providing access to shipping lanes and both national and international commerce. The development of sugar and cotton production (enabled by slavery) allowed the South to prosper. By the mid-19th century the city of New Orleans, being situated as a key to commerce on the Mississippi River and in the Gulf, had become the largest U.S. city not on the Atlantic seaboard and the fourth largest in the U.S. overall. Two major events were turning points in the earlier history of the Gulf Coast region. The first was the American Civil War, which caused severe damage to some economic sectors in the South, including the Gulf Coast. The second event was the Galveston Hurricane of 1900. At the end of the 19th century Galveston was, with New Orleans, one of the most developed cities in the region. The city had the third busiest port in the U.S.[13] and its financial district was known as the \"Wall Street of the South\".[14] Since then the Gulf Coast has been hit with numerous other hurricanes. On August 29, 2005, Hurricane Katrina struck the Gulf Coast as a Category 3 hurricane. It was the most damaging storm in the history of the United States, causing upwards of $80 billion in damages, and leaving over 1,800 dead. Again in 2008, the Gulf Coast was struck by a catastrophic hurricane. Due to its immense size, Hurricane Ike caused devastation from the Louisiana coastline all the way to the Kenedy County, Texas, region near Corpus Christi.[15] In addition, Ike caused flooding and significant damage along the Mississippi coastline and the Florida Panhandle[16] Ike killed 112 people and left upwards of 300 people missing, never to be found.[17] Hurricane Ike was the third most damaging storm in the history of the United States, causing more than $25 billion[18] in damage along the coast, leaving hundreds of thousands of people homeless, and sparking the largest search-and-rescue operation in U.S. history.[19] Other than the hurricanes, the Gulf Coast has redeveloped dramatically over the course of the 20th century. The gulf coast is highly populated. The petrochemical industry, launched with the major discoveries of oil in Texas and spurred on by further discoveries in the Gulf waters, has been a vehicle for development in the central and western Gulf which has spawned development on a variety of fronts in these regions. Texas in particular has benefited tremendously from this industry over the course of the 20th century and economic diversification has made the state a magnet for population and home to more Fortune 500 companies than any other U.S. state. Florida has grown as well, driven to a great extent by its long established tourism industry but also by its position as a gateway to the Caribbean and Latin America. As of 2024, Texas and Florida are the second and third most populous states in the nation, respectively. Other areas of the Gulf Coast have benefited less, though economic development fueled by tourism has greatly increased property values along the coast, and is now a severe danger to the valuable but fragile ecosystems of the Gulf Coast. The following table lists the 11 largest core-based statistical areas along the Gulf Coast. International destinations",

                "title": "Trump proposes renaming 'Gulf of Mexico' to 'Gulf of America' | FOX 5 Atlanta",
                "content": "Share President-elect Donald Trump announcing Tuesday he wants to rename the Gulf of Mexico to the Gulf of America. President-elect Donald Trump suggested on Tuesday that the Gulf of Mexico should be renamed the \"Gulf of America,\" calling the proposed name \"beautiful\" and reflective of U.S. prominence in the region. The suggestion marks Trumpâs latest foray into redrawing geographical nomenclature. He has previously referred to Canada as the \"51st State,\" proposed that Denmark consider ceding Greenland, and called for Panama to return control of the Panama Canal. Trumpâs remarks came against a backdrop of strained U.S.-Mexico relations that defined much of his political career. During his 2016 presidential campaign, Trump vowed to build a border wall between the two nations and make Mexico pay for it. While the U.S. ultimately built or refurbished about 450 miles of the wall during his first term, Mexico did not finance it. Renaming the Gulf of Mexico would face significant hurdles. The International Hydrographic Organization (IHO), which oversees the naming of seas, oceans, and navigable waters globally, would need to approve the change. Both the United States and Mexico are members of the IHO, and it is common for countries to refer to the same body of water by different names in their own documentation. Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-Ga.) quickly endorsed Trumpâs proposal. During an interview Tuesday, she announced plans to draft legislation to fund the renaming effort and cover administrative updates to federal maps and documents. The Gulf of Mexico, bordered by five southeastern U.S. states, has often been dubbed Americaâs \"Third Coast.\" In Spanish, it is referred to as \"El Golfo de MÃ©xico,\" highlighting a shared linguistic and cultural connection to the region. The Gulf of Mexico has carried its current name for over four centuries, likely derived from the Native American city of \"Mexico.\" It first appeared on maps in the 16th century, solidifying its place in historical and cartographic records. Despite Trumpâs proposal, the idea of renaming the gulf is not entirely new. In 2012, a Mississippi lawmaker introduced a bill to rename portions of the Gulf of Mexico touching the stateâs shores as the \"Gulf of America.\" The bill, later described as a joke, failed to gain traction. Even satirical takes on the subject have surfaced. Comedian Stephen Colbert joked during his show in 2010 that, after the Deepwater Horizon oil spill, the gulf should be renamed the \"Gulf of America,\" saying, \"We broke it, we bought it.\" Trumpâs suggestion highlights ongoing international debates over place names. Disputes over the Sea of Japan, Persian Gulf, and South China Sea illustrate the geopolitical sensitivities tied to geographic nomenclature. Some historical precedents exist for such changes, but they are rare. In 2015, President Barack Obama approved the renaming of Mount McKinley to Denali, a move Trump has said he opposes.

Trump then discussed the concept of \"approaching the dawn of America's golden age.\" >> WVTM 13 ON-THE-GO: Download our app for free Since his first run for the White House in 2016, Trump has repeatedly clashed with Mexico over a number of issues, including border security and the imposition of tariffs on imported goods. He vowed then to build a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border and make Mexico pay for it. The U.S. ultimately constructed or refurbished about 450 miles of wall during his first term. The Gulf of Mexico is often referred to as the United Statesâ âThird Coastâ due to its coastline across five southeastern states. Mexicans use a Spanish version of the same name for the gulf: âEl Golfo de MÃ©xico.â Americans and Mexicans diverge on what to call another key body of water, the river that forms the border between Texas and the Mexican states of Chihuahua, Coahuila, Nuevo Leon and Tamaulipas. Americans call it the Rio Grande; Mexicans call it the Rio Bravo. Trump did not elaborate on how he would go about renaming the body of water that is monitored during hurricane season and vital to the country's economy. President Barack Obama renamed Mount McKinley to Denali through the Department of Interior in 2015. But even if Trump were to go through U.S. channels, not all countries would have to follow suit. The International Hydrographic Organization, which the United States and Mexico are members of, works to make sure all of the world's major bodies of water are charted similarly. Just after Trumpâs comments on Tuesday, Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia said during an interview with podcaster Benny Johnson that she would direct her staff to draft legislation to change the name of the Gulf of Mexico, a move she said would take care of funding for new maps and administrative policy materials throughout the federal government. Yes. In 2012, a member of the Mississippi Legislature proposed a bill to rename portions of the gulf that touch that stateâs beaches âGulf of America,â a move the bill author later referred to as a âjoke.â That bill, which was referred to a committee, did not pass. Two years earlier, comedian Stephen Colbert had joked on his show that, following the massive Deepwater Horizon oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico, it should be renamed âGulf of Americaâ because, âWe broke it, we bought it.â Thereâs a long-running dispute over the name of the Sea of Japan among Japan, North Korea, South Korea and Russia, with South Korea arguing that the current name wasnât commonly used until Korea was under Japanese rule. At an International Hydrographic Organization meeting in 2020, member states agreed on a plan to replace names with numerical identifiers and develop a new digital standard for modern geographic information systems. The Persian Gulf has been widely known by that name since the 16th century, although usage of âGulfâ and âArabian Gulfâ is dominant in many countries in the Middle East. The government of Iran threatened to sue Google in 2012 over the companyâs decision not to label the body of water at all on its maps. There have been other conversations about bodies of water, including from Trumpâs 2016 opponent. According to materials revealed by WikiLeaks in a hack of her campaign chairmanâs personal account, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton in 2013 told an audience that, by Chinaâs logic that it claimed nearly the entirety of the South China Sea, then the U.S. after World War II could have labeled the Pacific Ocean the âAmerican Sea.â This article contains information from The Associated Press.

                "content": "Mikel Arteta reacts to Arsenal's 2-0 loss to Newcastle in the Carabao Cup semifinal first leg. Alexander Isak scored his 50th goal for Newcastle United as Eddie Howe's side took a huge step towards the Carabao Cup final with a 2-0 victory at Arsenal on Tuesday. Isak struck shortly before halftime in the first leg of the semifinal at a chilly Emirates Stadium and then had a big role in Newcastle's second scored by Anthony Gordon after the break. Arsenal were left to rue their failure to convert several good chances with Gabriel Martinelli denied by the woodwork in the first half and Kai Havertz missing a golden opportunity. In-form Newcastle, who have not won a major trophy since 1955, will now be clear favourites to complete the job in the second leg on Tyneside next month. Tottenham Hotspur host holders Liverpool in the first leg of the other semifinal on Wednesday. Arsenal had been unbeaten in their previous 13 games in all competitions but were not at their best against a clinical Newcastle side who have taken a liking to north London. Three days ago they won 2-1 at Tottenham to move closer to the Premier League's top four and they returned to send the travelling Toon Army back up north in high spirits. Isak has been virtually unstoppable of late and he has now scored 10 goals in his last nine appearances for the club. The Swede lofted one early half-chance over the crossbar but showed how lethal he is after 37 minutes when a long ball into the area fell into his path and he fired the ball high past David Raya into the roof of the net. Arsenal had threatened with Martinelli curling a shot against the post from the edge of the area and Newcastle were forced into some desperate defending in one goalmouth scramble. JurriÃ«n Timber also headed over the crossbar from close range for the hosts and Havertz was even more culpable after the break when he somehow failed to connect with a header with the goal gaping. By that time, Newcastle were 2-0 ahead thanks to a tap-in by Gordon in the 50th minute. Jacob Murphy played a great pass to Isak whose first-time shot was only parried by Raya for Gordon to sweep in the rebound. Arsenal piled on the pressure late on to try and reduce the deficit but Newcastle manned the barricades and will take a healthy lead back to St James' Park.",

Goals either side of half-time from Alexander Isak and then Anthony Gordon were enough to give Eddie Howe's side a commanding aggregate lead. Arsenal had plenty of chances to get themselves on the scoreline but were left wanting in front of goal again with Jurrien Timber, Gabriel Martinelli and Kai Havertz all missing big opportunities. The second leg of this tie will be played at St James' Park on Wednesday, February 5. Subscribe to The Athletic on an exclusive offer here. GO FURTHER Arsenal 0 Newcastle 2 â Eddie Howeâs greatest feat yet? What next for Arsenal? Unfortunately, there is a long time to wait for the second leg of this one. That match, taking place at St James' Park, will be played on Wednesday, February 5. Less than 24 hours to wait for more Carabao Cup semi-final action, though, as the first leg between Tottenham and Liverpool comes your way at 8pm (GMT) tomorrow evening. As with all four semi-final matches, that will be covered live here on The Athletic. Advertisement After the match, Eddie Howe was asked about goalkeeper Martin Dubravka, who looked to be emotional and almost waving goodbye to fans at the end. He's been very heavily linked with Saudi Arabian club Al-Shabab. \"I've nothing to add to that,\" Howe said. \"Weâve been preparing for this game. He's been playing very well and I wouldnât want to lose him.\" Pushed on it, he added: \"I know nothing, genuinely.\" He concluded \"that would be my wish,\" when asked if Dubravka could be offered a new contract and stay at the club. Getty Images Successive away wins for Newcastle at Manchester United's Old Trafford, Tottenham, and Arsenal's Emirates Stadium. What a week for a Newcastle supporter on the road! We have bemoaned Arsenal's lack of creativity on many an occasion this season, but that was not their downfall this evening. That fact, however, did not ease the frustration for Arteta. \"Obviously that isn't going to take the disappointment away,\" he said. \"The way the team tries every three days is unbelievable. And we have to be disappointed because it's another result that we wanted and that they don't deserve, but that's the reality.\" Asked about the challenge facing his players ahead of the second leg, the Arsenal boss was emphatic: \"I have full belief. I have seen my team play against them. I have full belief that we can do it.\" To me, these (spicy) two lines from Mikel Arteta's post-match interview detect some sore-loser-ship: \"Very deflected goals. Credit to them for managing to win the game like this.\" Hmm. I mean, the first goal was a good, possibly slightly fortuitous but probably intentional touch from Jacob Murphy into Alexander Isak's path. And Isak's shot took a slight nick on its way through to David Raya before Anthony Gordon tapped home, but it was really poor defending to allow Isak the shot. Not exactly 'two deflections'. And, seemingly a bit of back-handed compliment from Arteta in praising Newcastle for winning via those 'two deflections'. Getty Images No prizes for guessing the first question faced by Mikel Arteta in his post-match interview with Sky Sports â he was asked about the contrasting fortunes of the two teams in front of goal. \"That was the biggest difference in the game,\" he said. \"In every other aspect, we were the better team. But this is about scoring and they managed with the chances they had. And very deflected goals. Credit to them for managing to win the game like this. \"When we miss the chances we miss and concede those goals, it's always tough. But the team reacted and the team was very willing. We generated a lot of situations but it's true, they defended their box very well with their lives. \"They blocked a lot of shots, credit to them.\" Advertisement Getty Images Victorious Newcastle manager Eddie Howe, speaking to ITV after the game, said: \"Very pleased with the players, it was a tough game for us in many respects. We had players struggling at half-time. Really pleased with how we played. \"First half (Alexander Isak) was electric, he played really well. He scored but I just thought his general game was in a really good place. He was feeling his hamstring a bit at half-time so we had to manage him in the second half and that was a big blow to our performance. \"We rode our luck at times and I think Martin (Dubravka) played really well and made some really good saves. The set plays in the main we got the small details right. \"Our mentality to defend our goal with the blocked shots, the heroic pieces of defending that we saw in the last 20 to 30 minutes, it's great for us for the future.\" The Athletic/Getty Images Recognise that goal celebration from Anthony Gordon? A certain former Arsenal striker might remember it... Getty Images Captain for the evening Dan Burn turned in a performance worthy of the armband. He was asked about how he felt about the collective defensive showing. \"Very proud,\" he told Sky Sports. \"It was always going to be like that in the second half when we went two goals up. It's only half the job done but I thought everyone defended brilliantly. \"To get a result here, you have to defend set pieces well. They're so good at them. Everyone was brilliant. (Arsenal) had chances and probably deserved a goal, but throwing bodies on the line managed to get us over (the line).\" Since the 1987-1988 season, this is the ninth time that an away team has had a two-goal advantage going into the Carabao Cup semi-final second leg. On each and every one of the previous eight occasions, the side two goals up has progressed to the final. Hell of an ask for Arsenal to overturn this lead! Getty Images Another Player of the Match award for Alexander Isak and another modest post-match interview, this time with Sky Sports â he was asked about his blistering form in front of goal. \"It comes down to the team. We've been very solid defensively and then we have the quality up front,\" he said. \"It was again Jacob (Murphy) who assisted me today so I just tried to be in the right place to finish the attack.\" Asked about his partnership with Murphy, Isak said: \"We've found the connection in a good way. He gets into good positions and he seems to find me a lot which is positive for me and for the team as well.\" Advertisement Getty Images Newcastle goalscorer Anthony Gordon, speaking post-match to ITV, said: \"It's up there. We knew what type of game it would be, they're dominant at home. It was always going to be a smash-and-grab.\" When asked if team-mate Alexander Isak is the best striker in Europe, he continued: \"I think so. Everyone is in agreement with that. He's on fire. Even for my goal. I'm just gambling back post. \"It's all about attitude. It was unbelievable to a man. I want to mention Dan Burn, he's been our player of the season for me. \"We don't have time to be celebrating this one. They're one of the best sides in Europe, it's only 2-0. We need to stay humble.\" Getty Images Another monumental defensive performance from Eddie Howe's side. They are making quite the habit of keeping out their opponents â that is the fifth clean they have recorded in their last seven matches in all competitions. Only Yoane Wissa and Dominic Solanke (once each) have scored against Newcastle in that run of fixtures. It was a great all-around team performance from Newcastle. No real weak links. Goalkeeper Martin Dubravka was solid and strong when called upon in potentially his final game for the club. The full-backs, young and English, were good, especially Lewis Hall, who should be right in England contention. The centre-halves, led by Dan Burn, massive. Botman was good on his second match back from injury too. In midfield, Joelinton threw himself around with abandon, while Sandro Tonali was a colossus. Great clinical finishing and pressing from Isak and Gordon up front too, while Jacob Murphy is smart and underrated. The subs did their job too. Getty Images That is a really damaging result for Arsenal and Mikel Arteta. He has done a lot of good work during his time as manager at the Emirates, but his lack of silverware is hindering his chance of building a real legacy. He may well mastermind a second-leg turnaround, but tonight feels particularly damaging for the Spaniard. He could be staring another trophy-less season in the face... Getty Images That is among the most impressive of all Newcastle United wins during Eddie Howe's already extremely successful tenure. This not only marks seven successive wins in all competitions, but the last three of them have been achieved on the road at testing grounds. Arsenal missed some big chances, but Newcastle were excellent during the first half, efficient in front of goal and defensively resolute. A two-goal lead is an unexpected, and also a healthy, one to take back to St James' Park for next month's second leg. Newcastle's players were understandably muted afterwards, seemingly holding themselves back, recognising this is only 'half-time' in the tie. Regardless, this result is huge. There is no other way of describing it. Advertisement The Athletic's Chris Waugh and Art de Roche were on hand to deliver The Briefing from the Emirates Stadium â you can read it at the link below. GO FURTHER Arsenal 0 Newcastle 2 â Eddie Howeâs greatest feat yet? What next for Arsenal? That's seven wins on the spin for Newcastle. And eight matches successively in which Alexander Isak has scored. What a player! And what brilliant form Eddie Howe's men are in. Getty Images Put simply, that is a monumental win for Newcastle. They arrived at the Emirates Stadium in very good form, but there won't be too many of their fans who expected to see them come away from north London with a 2-0 first-leg win. Yes, Arsenal missed a host of big chances, but that was a seriously impressive display from Eddie Howe's men, particularly when they dropped in to protect their 2-0 lead. A huge result to take up north for next month's second leg!",

Newcastle United took one step closer to the Wembley with a superb 2-0 victory over Arsenal in the first leg of their Carabao Cup semi-final at the Emirates Stadium. Eddie Howe named an attacking line-up for the Magpies and they showed their intent from the start with a high press and a willingness to get men into the final third when in possession. Their early dominance threatened to be a false dawn though as Arsenal swiftly played through them to set Gabriel Martinelli up with a brilliant chance to open the scoring only for the winger to strike the post. Alexander Isak was more clinical at the other end. He ran onto the end of a Jacob Murphy pass to slot past David Raya and give Newcastle the lead before half-time. After the restart, Anthony Gordon arrived in the box at the right time as Isak had another shot stopped by Raya only for the goalkeeper to serve up an easy tap-in to Gordon. Howe then made changes and set the team up defensively. Arsenal threw everything at them but couldnât cut the deficit and will have a tough task ahead of the return leg at St. Jamesâ Park. Relive the action from the Emirates Stadium with our live blog below: âItâs massive. itâs a great result. Itâs only the first half. If we donât go through then this has no meaning. Itâs a massive win. I donât think itâs too much of an individual thing, itâs more a team thing. Weâve been very consistent to create chances. âItâs difficult to put a finger on but weâve found out way back to our identity and the basics. It starts with how we defend. the defence and the midfield put their body on the line.â âFirst half he was electric, I thought he played really well. He scored but I just thought his general game was in a really good place. He was feeling his hamstring a bit at half-time so we had to manage him in the second half and that was a big blow to our performance. âI think we rode our luck at times and I think Martin [Dubravka] played really well and made some really good saves. I thought the set plays in the main we got the small details right. Our mentality to defend our goal with the blocked shots, the heroic pieces of defending that we saw in the last 20 to 30 minutes, itâs great for us for the future.â A night that was about whether you could take your chances; for goals, and maybe for finals. The overly cynical might even say it was for showing what you can really do in front of a certain audience, especially in regards to Alexander Isak. Arsenalâs widely reported interest in the Swede added another strand to a narrative-rich Carabao Cup semi-final, and his presence ended up deciding how this 2-0 win went. Newcastle United would rightly bristle at that being the focus of a match that might end up sending them to Wembley for the second time in three years. Arsenal do still have a second leg in a month to overturn this, but that will be at an intimidating St James Park, where the crowd will see this trophy as being about so much more than this trophy. The Saudi Arabian project has felt like it has needed a lift after a long lull, and this might be it. For all that recent issues had fed a debate over whether the controversial ownership are overseeing the club in the fulsome manner they have other projects, their willingness to spend what they can has given Newcastle one of the finest players in world football right now. Arsenal 0-2 Newcastle: Eddie Howeâs men take the advantage into the Carabao Cup semi-final second leg thanks to their star forward âVery pleased with the players, it was a tough game for us in many respects. Weâve had players struggling at half-time. Really pleased with how we played.â âVery proud, it was always going to be like that in the second half. Too a man everyone defended brilliant. âTo get a result here you need to defend set-pieces, but I thought everyone was brilliant. âWe have had a sticky patch, but we have had a few clean sheets in a row. Seeing the way we defended in the second half was brilliant. âItâs only a job half done - they have nothing to lose coming to St. Jamesâ Park.â âI think it comes down to a team thing. âWe have been solid defensively and then we have the quality up front. Jacob [Murphy] assisted me and I tried to be in the right place to finish the attacks. âWe came here with the intention to bring a good result home and we did. âWe have some time to change things, come back and do the same at St. Jamesâ Park.â âWe werenât doing it at the start of the season and we werenât putting work in at the start of the season. We donât have time to celebrating this one. âTheyâre one of the best sides in Europe, itâs only 2-0. We need to stay humble.â âItâs up there.

I want to mention Dan Burn, heâs been our player of the season for me.â Since 1987-88, this is the ninth time an away team will have held a two-goal advantage after a semi-final first leg, with all eight previous occasions seeing the side progress to the final.

                "title": "What does TGL stand for? An investigation (with a surprising twist)",
                "content": "Make 2025 your best golf year ever: The TGL on opening night. Getty Images Earlier this week, as I was trying to explain the inception of another new golf league to a non-golfing buddy, he asked a very reasonable question: What does TGL stand for? He didnât mean stand for existentially, like, what does TGL represent, who does it champion, what are its values. He just meant, very literally, what do the letters in the acronym TGL stand for? The NBA is the National Basketball Association. The NFL is the National Football League. The MLB is Major League Baseball. Whatâs the TGL? And I realized that I did not have an answer. The G and the L were, I could safely assume, referencing a âGolf League.â But how âbout the T? I thought back to the first time we heard about this new golf thing, in a press conference at the 2022 Tour Championship. It was LIVâs debut summer, a turbulent time for the PGA Tour and for professional golf, but Rory McIlroy and Tiger Woods had led a charge to stabilize the Tour and now, as added incentive, were introducing a new company and a new-look golf league. At East Lake, McIlroy brought up CEO and co-founder Mike McCarley to make the official introduction of two new entities: TMRW Sports (the company) and TGL (the league). I remember the uncertainty at the time: What on earth are these? But I didnât remember much else. Had McCarley explained âem then? I pulled up the transcript to see if heâd gone deep on the acronyms, but no dice â he was intentionally and understandably vague. Forget TGL; it wasnât even quite clear what TMRW was. Sure, they were were the initials of Tiger Woods (TW) and Rory McIlroy (RM) put together. We learned a little while later that it was pronounced âtomorrow.â But the rest weâd have to piece together ourselves. There were multiple possibilities. McCarley kept calling it a âtech-infusedâ golf league. Was that the T in TGL? Hopefully not. Did the T refer to golfâs most famous T and we were witnessing the launch of the Tiger Golf League or Tigerâs Golf League or something along those lines? That would be a little on the nose. The most logical explanation was that it was the TMRW Golf League, abbreviating one vague acronym to squeeze it into another. But that would require multiple layers of explanation and, if it was the case, Iâd never seen it written anywhere. I pulled up the TGL website. Any explanation was conspicuously absent and the league was described only by its three letters. Actually, thatâs not true. On its site and really in all press-release materials youâll find âTGL presented by SoFiâ which appears to be the official name. An easy dig to make at the leagueâs expense would be that, in classic golf fashion, they figured out the sponsor before they figured out the league. But itâs Week 1! Weâre feeling warm and fuzzy about their creative golf innovation â no need for cheap shots. Surely Google would know. Somebody else would have asked the question and found the answer. And they had â sort of. Several outlets had addressed it, but I saw multiple references to the TGL as âTomorrowâs Golf League.â The New York Times described it that way. So did ESPN, which added that the inclusion of âTomorrowâ in the name âstems fromâ TMRW. Even Wikipedia added the âTomorrowâsâ reference. I get the imagery of tomorrow, which lends itself to a forward-thinking league focused on starting something new and different. But framing it as tomorrowâs league in perpetuity? That introduces a bit of a Dippinâ Dots problem. If youâre the ice cream of the future â or, in this case, the golf league of tomorrow â what happens when you want to be the golf league of today? USA Today introduced more nuance in its explainer, writing that TGL âunofficiallyâ stands for Tomorrowâs Golf League. That felt better. Iâve been on the receiving end of enough TGL media materials that I figure I would have seen some reference to âTomorrowâsâ if itâd been made official, but no. Finally I found an interview with McCarley in the Palm Beach Post where heâd been confronted directly with the question and laid out the truth. âYou go through a bunch of different branding exercises with different agencies and at the end of it what you find is if youâre creating a sports league, everyone uses the acronym anyway,â McCarley said. âSo start with the acronym because thatâs what itâs eventually going to be called once people start to realize what it is and how they refer to it.â In other words, McCarley and co. had settled on TGL before theyâd even settled on T. He considered the same questions we did. Tiger Golf League? Tech golf league? Simply The Golf League? Ultimately perhaps he decided it didnât much matter. Heâs probably right that a full name is mostly pointless; only long-winded broadcasters ever reference the âNational Football League,â after all. Still, it helps define the league. Thereâs something foundational about its existence. But when I finally got in touch with a league employee, that person confirmed the unsettling truth: TGL just stands for TGL. I didnât like that. Acronyms are by definition abbreviations, and itâs unnatural to skip the step of having something to abbreviate. Another league would never do this, I thought to myself. And then I realized, wait a minute â what if the PGA Tour already does? You may or may not know that the current Tour was once part of the Professional Golfersâ Association of America. Thatâs where âPGAâ originated. But somewhere after the entities split, things got murky. One sign of this murkiness: In 1981 the league even changed its name to the Tournament Players Association, to be known as the TPA Tour, to avoid confusion, but then changed it back a few months later. Perhaps thatâs where the acronym lost its filling, Iâm not sure â but I confirmed with multiple Tour employees that, to their knowledge, the PGA Tour at this point isnât short for anything. Thatâs the complete thing. For the first time in years, a scene popped into my head from the 2004 high-schoolers-steal-the-SAT-answers epic film The Perfect Score, which my family had owned on DVD and thus cycled through several times on road trips. At one point in the movie Kyle (played by Chris Evans) asks Matty (Bryan Greenberg) what he thinks SAT even stands for. â[It used to be] Scholastic Aptitude Test,â Kyle says. âThen they got rid of that altogether. You know what it stands for now?â âHmph.â âSAT.â âWhat?â âSAT stands for SAT. Thatâs it.â âThatâs fâ- up!â For the record, thatâs true: the SAT no longer stands for anything. Itâs just the SAT, full stop. But we already know, for better or worse, what the SAT is. With the TGL, weâre just starting to find out. And once we do, the name wonât much matter anymore, anyway.

                "content": "Occupational Group Life Insurance (TGL) is a life insurance that your employer pays for. TGL provides your beneficiaries basic financial protection if you were to die before you retire or reach the age of expiry. Contact your employer to find out whether you have TGL cover or not. A full amount of compensation corresponds to six price base amounts. Payment is age-dependent and reduces the older you get. If you have children who have not reached the age of 20 at the time of your death, each child will receive additional compensation. You can see the current applicable amount of compensation in the pre-purchase information. The insurance applies as long as you are employed and will cease when you retire. If you continue working after the age of 65, the insurance will automatically cease when you reach 'the age of expiry', which usually is the age of 70. All life insurance policies have a fixed order of priority regarding the beneficiaries in the terms and conditions. If you would like to change this order, you have to do this with a special form called ânomination of beneficiaryâ (sÃ¤rskilt fÃ¶rmÃ¥nstagarfÃ¶rordnande). The following priority of beneficiaries applies to TGL within the collective agreement area for the Confederation of Swedish Enterprise and The Council for Negotiation and Cooperation (Svenskt NÃ¤ringsliv and PTK): Half a price base amount is paid out to your estate if none of the above is alive and no separate nomination of beneficiary has been registered. Please note that there may be a different order or priority regarding beneficiaries for other collective agreement areas. You find all of Bliwaâs insurance terms for TGL here. If you would like to change this order or name other people you need to do this with a special form called ânomination of beneficiaryâ (sÃ¤rskilt fÃ¶rmÃ¥nstagarfÃ¶rordnande).

                "title": "Sutton Foster - Wikipedia",
                "content": "Sutton Lenore Foster (born March 18, 1975) is an American actress. She is known for her work on the Broadway stage, for which she has won the Tony Award for Best Actress in a Musical twice, in 2002 for her role as Millie Dillmount in Thoroughly Modern Millie, and in 2011 for her performance as Reno Sweeney in Anything Goes, a role which she reprised in 2021 for a production in London and for which she received a nomination for the Laurence Olivier Award for Best Actress in a Musical. Her other Broadway credits include Grease, Little Women, The Drowsy Chaperone, Young Frankenstein, Shrek the Musical, Violet, The Music Man, Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street, and Once Upon a Mattress. On television, Foster played the lead role in the short-lived ABC Family comedy-drama Bunheads from 2012 to 2013. From 2015 to 2021, she starred in the TV Land comedy-drama Younger. Foster was born on March 18, 1975[1][2] in Statesboro, Georgia,[3] and raised in Troy, Michigan.[4] At the age of 15, she was a contestant on the reality competition show Star Search[4][5] and also auditioned for the cast of The Mickey Mouse Club. She left Troy High School before graduating (she received her diploma via correspondence courses) to join the national tour of The Will Rogers Follies directed by Tommy Tune.[4][6][7] She then attended Carnegie Mellon University for one year,[7][8] but left to pursue a theatrical career full-time. In May 2012, she received an honorary doctorate from Ball State University, \"in recognition of her outstanding career in theater, television and music and for her contributions to the educational experience and professional growth of Ball State students.\"[9] In May 2019, she also received an honorary doctorate from Boston Conservatory at Berklee, which introduced a merit scholarship in her name to be awarded to one student every four years. Her older brother, Hunter Foster, is also an actor.[4][7] After touring in the role of Sandy Dumbrowski in the musical Grease throughout 1995, Foster transferred to the Broadway production in 1996.[10][11] She left to appear in the ensemble of the Broadway musical The Scarlet Pimpernel in 1997, and after that closed[12] she returned as the Star to Be in the revival of Annie. In 1998, Foster appeared in What the World Needs Now at the Old Globe Theatre, before she began touring with Les MisÃ©rables as Eponine Thenardier. She then understudied the same role on Broadway in 2000.[13] Foster left Les MisÃ©rables to join the ensemble of Thoroughly Modern Millie in its pre-Broadway run at the La Jolla Playhouse. Original leading lady Kristin Chenoweth landed a television series shortly after rehearsals began and was replaced with Erin Dilly as Millie and Foster as her understudy. After apparent clashes between the creative team, a \"mutual\" decision was made for Dilly to leave the production. With only nine days remaining before the first preview, Foster took over the role of Millie Dilmount.[14][15] During a hiatus (before Millie was set to open on Broadway), Foster appeared in Dorian at Goodspeed Musicals, The Three Musketeers at the American Musical Theatre of San Jose, and South Pacific at the Pittsburgh Civic Light Opera.[citation needed] Thoroughly Modern Millie finally opened on Broadway at the Marquis Theatre in 2002, to positive reviews. The New York Daily News reviewer said: \"newcomer Sutton Foster, who has the pert look, the silver voice and the dazzling legwork to make an extraordinarily winning Millie.\"[16] Clive Barnes, reviewing for the New York Post wrote \"Newcomer Sutton Foster's own star turn as Millie is perfectly charming, but as a star she doesn't twinkle, glitter or light up Broadway like a Christmas tree defying a July noon. But she has a good voice and is cutely agreeable.\"[17] The Newsday reviewer wrote: \"She has a smile that may remind you of Mary Tyler Moore, the gawky comic precision of the young Carol Burnett, the lyricism of a romantic heroine and a smallish but vibrant voice as accurate as it is expressive. As [Millie], another of New York's prototypical small-town girls with big-city dreams, [Sutton Foster] appears unfazed by the burden of a character created onscreen by Julie Andrews. The newcomer takes the big stage with an uninhibited what-the-heck comfort level and the discipline to go with her instincts.\"[18] Time Magazine wrote: \"she's [Sutton Foster] got the full package: girlish gawkiness and Broadway brass, the legs and the lungs. Foster is a big reason the show is just about the cutest thing to hit Broadway since Annie's dimples, with perkily retro songs by Jeanine Tesori and clever staging by director Michael Mayer...\"[19] Foster went on to win the 2002 Tony Award for Best Leading Actress in a Musical,[20] the Drama Desk Award for Outstanding Actress in a Musical,[21] and the Outer Critics Circle Award for Outstanding Actress in a Musical for her performance.[22][23] During the run, Foster appeared in concert versions of Chess and Funny Girl, before leaving in 2004. Upon leaving, Foster did a concert version of Snoopy! The Musical and returned to the Pittsburgh Civic Light Opera for a production of Me and My Girl to wrap up the year. In May 2005, Foster co-starred as Jo March opposite Maureen McGovern as Marmee in the musical adaptation of Louisa May Alcott's classic novel Little Women, for which she was nominated for her second Tony Award.[24] The production closed after just a few months. She returned to Broadway at the Marquis Theatre in May 2006 in The Drowsy Chaperone, a spoof of 1920s musicals. She played Janet van de Graaff, a famous Broadway starlet who opts to forgo a stage career in favor of married life. The musical had a pre-Broadway run at the Ahmanson Theatre, Los Angeles in November to December 2005.[25] Her performance earned her a third Tony nomination.[26] Foster left the musical in 2007 and co-starred in Mel Brooks' musical adaptation of his film Young Frankenstein as the Swedish yodeling frÃ¤ulein Inga, first at the Paramount Theatre and then on Broadway from October 2007 to July 2008.[27] In 2007, Foster guest-starred on the children's musical puppet show Johnny and the Sprites[28] and in a three-episode story arc on the HBO sitcom Flight of the Conchords.[29] She left the show to play Princess Fiona in Shrek the Musical, which opened on Broadway on December 14, 2008.[30] For this role, Foster won her second Outer Critics Circle Award for Outstanding Actress in a Musical[31] and was nominated for her fourth Tony Award for Best Performance by a Leading Actress in a Musical.[32] She played her final performance on January 3, 2010, when the show closed on Broadway. Foster participated in a reading of a work-in-progress new musical, Bonnie and Clyde: A Folktale, in June 2009. Her brother, Hunter is writing the music for this musical.[33] Foster's debut solo album Wish was released by Ghostlight Records in February 2009. The songs range from jazz to pop to cabaret to Broadway.[34] In 2010, Foster promoted the album with concert performances in Boston, New York City, Chicago, the Orange County Performing Arts Center in Orange County, California, and Washington, D.C.[35] Foster starred as Nurse Fay Apple in the New York City Center's Encores! production of Anyone Can Whistle, which played from April 8 to 11, 2010.[36] Foster made her Off-Broadway debut in Paul Weitz's comedy Trust with Zach Braff, Bobby Cannavale and Ari Graynor which began previews July 23, 2010, with an official opening August 12, running through September 12, 2010, at Second Stage Theatre.[37] Foster and Seth Rudetsky participated in the one night only Actors Fund benefit concert version of They're Playing Our Song on August 30, 2010, at the Gerald W. Lynch Theater, John Jay College, New York. The full cast included EfÃ©, Kaitlyn Davidson, Alex Ellis, Maynard, Matt Loehr, and Jesse Nager, and was directed by Denis Jones.[38] Foster taught a Spring Semester master class at New York University's Tisch School of the Arts Undergraduate Department of Drama, beginning in January 2010. It culminated in a cabaret performance at Joe's Pub in May titled \"From Rodgers To Heart\".[39][40] She taught the master class again in Fall Semester 2010, culminating in another performance at Joe's Pub, \"Crazy for Gershwin\". Both were musically directed by Deborah Abramson. She is now on the faculty of NYU's New Studio on Broadway. Foster taught a week-long master class session at Ball State University (Muncie, IN) in January 2010.[33] She continued her relationship with Ball State in September 2010 by working with students in the classroom, teaching master classes, and performing workshops for students of the Department of Theatre and Dance. She also guest-starred in an episode of the NBC legal drama Law & Order: SVU (opposite comedian Kathy Griffin), which aired on March 3, 2010.[41] Foster performed at the 33rd Annual Kennedy Center Honors in a tribute to Jerry Herman, singing \"Before the Parade Passes By.\"[42] She performed at the Kennedy Center Honors the following year in a tribute to Barbara Cook.[43] She made a third appearance at the Kennedy Center Honors in 2013, performing for the tribute to Shirley MacLaine.[44] Foster performed a concert tour, An Evening With Sutton Foster from September 2010 to May 2011, performing songs from both her Broadway career and her solo album.[45] Foster played Reno Sweeney in the Broadway revival of Anything Goes, which began performances on March 10, 2011, at the Stephen Sondheim Theatre and officially opened on April 7, 2011.[46] Foster won her third Outer Critics Circle Award and second Drama Desk Award and Tony Award for her performance.[47][48][49] Foster's final performance was on March 11, 2012, when she was replaced by Stephanie J. Block. Foster left to film the television comedy-drama Bunheads, which premiered on ABC Family on June 11, 2012.[50][51] Foster played the lead role in this short-lived 2012 ABC Family drama, developed by Amy Sherman-Palladino, the creator of Gilmore Girls. She played former Las Vegas showgirl Michelle, who impulsively marries a man, moves to his small town, and begins teaching ballet lessons at her new mother-in-law's dance studio. She won the Gracie Award and received a nomination at the 3rd Critics' Choice Television Awards for Best Actress in a Comedy Series.[52] The series was cancelled after a single season.[53] In the spring of 2012, she returned to Ball State, teaching classes, mentoring the interdisciplinary team that wrote the musical The Circus in Winter, and co-directing the Department of Theatre and Dance's Spring 2012 production of The Drowsy Chaperone; she also spoke at commencement and received an Honorary Doctorate of Fine Arts degree for her continued engagement with Ball State students. Foster continued her relationship with Ball State in October 2012, performing in the staged reading of The Circus in Winter at the National Alliance for Musical Theatre's Festival of New Musicals at New World Stages in New York.[54] In 2013, Foster guest starred in an episode of Psych and starred as Kerry in actor James Roday's comedic thriller Gravy.[55] In 2014, she appeared opposite Robin Williams in the comedy The Angriest Man in Brooklyn.[56] From March to August 2014, Foster starred in the Roundabout Theatre Company production of the musical Violet at the American Airlines Theatre.[57] Foster received her sixth Tony Award nomination for her performance.[58] She made her Carnegie Hall debut in April 2015, with guest appearances from Joshua Henry and Megan McGinnis.[59][60] This was part of a new tour effort An Evening With Sutton Foster: Broadway In Concert, which continued through 2016. She returned to Encores! in July 2015 to play Queenie in Andrew Lippa's The Wild Party.[61] She later was cast as the lead character of Liza Miller in the TV Land single-camera comedy-drama pilot Younger, created by Darren Star. It was originally set to be released January 13, 2015, but she stated on January 31 in an interview at TETA TheatreFest 2015 in Houston, Texas that the release was delayed. The series premiered on March 31, 2015, and was renewed for a second season, which began airing in January 2016, shortly after it was renewed for a third season, set for a release at the end of the year. In July 2016, season three began filming, and the series was renewed for a fourth season.[56][62] Season three aired to positive reviews in late 2016, and season 4 aired in summer 2017 with further positive reviews. In 2016, she starred opposite Aaron Tveit and Betty Buckley in the Stephen Schwartz revue Defying Gravity in Australia. She appeared in the Off-Broadway revival of Sweet Charity as Charity Hope Valentine at the Pershing Square Signature Center from November 2, 2016 (previews) to January 8, 2017.[63][64] Also in 2016, Foster played the role of Violet in the miniseries Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life opposite her ex-husband, Christian Borle. The two perform a musical within the Summer episode about the history of Stars Hollow.[65] She appeared on the game show Match Game, broadcast on ABC in June 2016.[66] She also made guest appearances on The Good Wife and Mad Dogs. In 2017, she once again returned to Ball State, this time to co-direct the Department of Theatre and Dance's Spring production of Shrek: The Musical.[67] During December 2017, she performed as a guest artist for the Mormon Tabernacle Choir's annual Christmas concerts.[68] In December 2017, Foster and Jonathan Groff performed a selection of songs from many shows at The Appel Room at Lincoln Center;[69] this concert, which also featured Megan McGinnis and Darcie Roberts, aired on PBS's \"Live From Lincoln Center\" on April 20, 2018.[70][71] From July through October 2021, Foster made her London theatre debut reprising her role as Reno Sweeney[72] in Anything Goes at the Barbican Theatre, earning rave reviews from British critics.[73][74][75] For her performance, Foster was nominated for the Laurence Olivier Award for Best Actress in a Musical.[76] The production was broadcast in UK cinemas on 28 November and 1 December 2021.[77] The recorded performance also played at US cinemas on March 27 and 30, 2022, and later aired on the PBS series Great Performances.[78][79] In October 2021, she published a memoir, Hooked, in which she opens up about how she used crafts, specifically cross-stitching, collaging and crocheting, to get through significantly challenging milestones in her life. She shares how using crafts as creative outlets helped her deal with painful experiences in her life and remain present and resilient. In 2019, she crocheted an octopus toilet paper cover for Younger costar Hilary Duff's wedding.[80] In December 2021, she returned to Broadway, starring as Marian Paroo opposite Hugh Jackman as Harold Hill in a revival of The Music Man.[81][82] For her performance, Foster received her seventh nomination for the Tony Award for Best Actress in a Musical and also won the Drama League Award for Distinguished Performance.[83][84] The production played its final performance on January 15, 2023.[85] As of March 2023, she is currently on the faculty of Ball State University as an instructor of theatre, focusing on internships.[86] In February 2024, she replaced Annaleigh Ashford in the Broadway revival of Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street as Mrs. Lovett. She starred in the production for a 12-week limited engagement opposite Aaron Tveit as Todd.[87][88] Foster starred as Princess Winnifred in a concert production of Once Upon a Mattress as part of the New York City Center Encores! series.[89] In May 2024, it was announced that the production would transfer to Broadway's Hudson Theatre for a limited engagement lasting from July through November with an additional four-week engagement playing at the Ahmanson Theatre in Los Angeles in December.[90][91] Foster met actor Christian Borle in college,[92] and married him on September 18, 2006. Although they divorced in 2009,[93][94] Foster and Borle remain friends and continue to support each other's work.[95][96] On September 19, 2013, Foster confirmed she was engaged to screenwriter Ted Griffin.[97] She and Griffin married on October 25, 2014.[98] In April 2017, Foster announced that she and her husband had adopted a baby girl, Emily, born March 5, 2017.[99] Foster filed for divorce from Ted Griffin in October 2024.[100] In January 2025, Sutton Foster and Hugh Jackman confirmed their relationship; the two had previously co-starred in The Music Man on Broadway in 2022.[101] [102] Foster is a self-proclaimed dog lover and has had three dogs since her Broadway debut: Linus, Mabel, and Brody.[103] She makes artwork which she sells online and occasionally at art exhibits. She has collaborated with visual artist Julien Havard, who previously worked as her dresser for nine years, beginning with Thoroughly Modern Millie.[104][105] In December 2021, Foster tested positive for COVID-19 and was forced to miss performances of The Music Man. Her understudy, Kathy Voytko, stepped in while she was out.[106] Tours Over her career, she has been recognized by the Tony Awards and Laurence Olivier Awards for her work on the Broadway stage and London theatre for:",

                "title": "Mark Zuckerberg - Wikipedia",
                "content": "Mark Elliot Zuckerberg (/ËzÊkÉrbÉËrÉ¡/; born May 14, 1984) is an American businessman who co-founded the social media service Facebook and its parent company Meta Platforms, of which he is the chairman, chief executive officer, and controlling shareholder. Zuckerberg has been the subject of multiple lawsuits regarding the creation and ownership of the website as well as issues such as user privacy. Zuckerberg briefly attended Harvard College, where he launched Facebook in February 2004 with his roommates Eduardo Saverin, Andrew McCollum, Dustin Moskovitz and Chris Hughes. Zuckerberg took the company public in May 2012 with majority shares. He became the world's youngest self-made billionaire[a] in 2008, at age 23, and has consistently ranked among the world's wealthiest individuals. He has also used his funds to organize multiple donations, including the establishment of the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative. A film depicting Zuckerberg's early career, legal troubles and initial success with Facebook, The Social Network, was released in 2010 and won multiple Academy Awards. His prominence and fast rise in the technology industry has prompted political and legal attention. Mark Elliot Zuckerberg was born on May 14, 1984, in White Plains, New York to psychiatrist Karen (nÃ©e Kempner) and dentist Edward Zuckerberg.[2][3] He and his three sisters (Arielle, Randi, and Donna) were raised in a Reform Jewish household[4] in Dobbs Ferry, New York.[5] His great-grandparents were emigrants from Austria, Germany, and Poland.[6] Zuckerberg initially attended Ardsley High School before transferring to Phillips Exeter Academy. He was captain of the fencing team.[7][8] Zuckerberg learned computer programming in his childhood. At about the age of eleven, he created \"ZuckNet\", a program that allowed computers at the family home and his father's dental office to communicate with each other.[9] During Zuckerberg's high-school years, he worked to build a music player called the Synapse Media Player. The device used machine learning to learn the user's listening habits, which was posted to Slashdot[10] and received a rating of 3 out of 5 from PC Magazine.[11] The New Yorker once said of Zuckerberg, \"some kids played computer games. Mark created them.\"[5] While still in high school, he attended Mercy College taking a graduate computer course on Thursday evenings.[5] The New Yorker noted that by the time Zuckerberg began classes at Harvard in 2002, he had already achieved a \"reputation as a programming prodigy\".[5] He studied psychology and computer science,[12] resided in Kirkland House,[13] and belonged to Alpha Epsilon Pi.[5] In his second year, he wrote a program that he called CourseMatch, which allowed users to make class selection decisions based on the choices of other students and help them form study groups.[14] Later, he created a different program he initially called Facemash that let students select the best-looking person from a choice of photos. Arie Hasit, Zuckerberg's roommate at the time, explained: We had books called \"Face Books\", which included the names and pictures of everyone who lived in the student dorms. At first, he built a site and placed two pictures or pictures of two males and two females. Visitors to the site had to choose who was \"hotter\" and according to the votes there would be a ranking.[15] The site went up over a weekend, but by Monday morning, the college shut it down, because its popularity had overwhelmed one of Harvard's network switches preventing students from accessing the Internet.[16] In addition, many students complained that their photos were being used without permission. Zuckerberg apologized publicly, and the student paper ran articles stating that his site was \"completely improper\".[15] In January 2004, Zuckerberg began writing code for a new website.[18] On February 4, 2004, Zuckerberg launched \"Thefacebook\", originally located at thefacebook.com, in partnership with his roommates Eduardo Saverin, Andrew McCollum, Dustin Moskovitz, and Chris Hughes.[19][20] An earlier inspiration for Facebook may have come from Phillips Exeter Academy, the prep school from which Zuckerberg graduated in 2002. It published its own student directory, \"The Photo Address Book\", which students referred to as \"The Facebook\". Such photo directories were an important part of the student social experience at many private schools. With them, students were able to list attributes such as their class years, their friends, and their telephone numbers.[20] Six days after the site launched, three Harvard seniors, Cameron Winklevoss, Tyler Winklevoss, and Divya Narendra, accused Zuckerberg of intentionally misleading them into believing that he would help them build a social network called HarvardConnection.com, when he was using their ideas to build a competing product.[21] The three complained to The Harvard Crimson, and the newspaper began an investigation in response. While Zuckerberg tried to convince the editors not to run the story,[22] he also broke into two of the editors' email accountsâfor which he made use of their private login data logs from TheFacebook.[23][24] Following the official launch of the Facebook social media platform, the three filed a lawsuit against Zuckerberg that resulted in a settlement.[25] The agreed settlement was for 1.2 million Facebook shares and $20 million in cash.[26] Zuckerberg's Facebook started off as just a \"Harvard thing\" until he decided to spread it to other schools, enlisting the help of roommate and co-founder Dustin Moskovitz.[27] They began with Columbia University, New York University, Stanford University, Dartmouth College, Cornell University, University of Pennsylvania, Brown University, and Yale University.[28] Zuckerberg dropped out of Harvard in his sophomore year in order to complete the project.[29] Zuckerberg, Moskovitz and the other co-founders moved to Palo Alto, California, where they leased a small house that served as an office. Over the summer, Zuckerberg met Peter Thiel, who invested in his company. They got their first office in mid-2004. According to Zuckerberg, the group planned to return to Harvard, but eventually decided to remain in California, where Zuckerberg appreciated the \"mythical place\" of Silicon Valley, the center of computer technology in California.[30][31] They had already turned down offers by major corporations to buy the company. In an interview in 2007, Zuckerberg explained his reasoning: \"It's not because of the amount of money. For me and my colleagues, the most important thing is that we create an open information flow for people. Having media corporations owned by conglomerates is just not an attractive idea to me.\"[32] The same year, speaking at Y Combinator's Startup School course at Stanford University, Zuckerberg made a controversial assertion that \"young people are just smarter\" and that other entrepreneurs should bias towards hiring young people.[33] Zuckerberg restated these goals to Wired magazine in 2010, \"The thing I really care about is the mission, making the world open.\"[34] Earlier, in April 2009, Zuckerberg had sought the advice of former Netscape CFO Peter Currie regarding financing strategies for Facebook.[35] On July 21, 2010, Zuckerberg reported that Facebook had reached the 500-million-user mark.[36] When asked whether Facebook could earn more income from advertising as a result of its phenomenal growth, he explained: I guess we could ... If you look at how much of our page is taken up with ads compared to the average search query. The average for us is a little less than 10 percent of the pages and the average for search is about 20 percent taken up with ads ... That's the simplest thing we could do. But we aren't like that. We make enough money. Right, I mean, we are keeping things running; we are growing at the rate we want to.[34] In 2010, Steven Levy, who wrote the 1984 book Hackers: Heroes of the Computer Revolution, wrote that Zuckerberg \"clearly thinks of himself as a hacker\". Zuckerberg said that \"it's OK to break things\" \"to make them better\".[37][38] Facebook instituted \"hackathons\" held every six to eight weeks where participants would have one night to conceive of and complete a project.[37] The company provided music, food, and beer at the hackathons, and many Facebook staff members, including Zuckerberg, regularly attended.[38] \"The idea is that you can build something really good in a night\", Zuckerberg told Levy. \"And that's part of the personality of Facebook now ... It's definitely very core to my personality.\"[37] In 2007, Zuckerberg was added to MIT Technology Review's TR35 list as one of the top 35 innovators in the world under the age of 35.[39] Vanity Fair magazine named Zuckerberg number 1 on its 2010 list of the Top 100 \"most influential people of the Information Age\".[40] Zuckerberg ranked number 23 on the Vanity Fair 100 list in 2009.[41] In 2010, Zuckerberg was chosen as number 16 in New Statesman's annual survey of the world's 50 most influential figures.[42] In a 2011 interview with PBS shortly after the death of Steve Jobs, Zuckerberg said that Jobs had advised him on how to create a management team at Facebook that was \"focused on building as high quality and good things as you are\".[43] On October 1, 2012, Zuckerberg met with then Russian Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev in Moscow to stimulate social media innovation in Russia and to boost Facebook's position in the Russian market.[44][45] Russia's communications minister tweeted that Medvedev persuaded Zuckerberg to open a research center in Moscow instead of trying to lure away Russian programmers. In 2012, Facebook had roughly 9 million users in Russia, while domestic clone VK had around 34 million.[46][47] Rebecca Van Dyck, Facebook's head of consumer marketing, said that 85 million American Facebook users were exposed to the first day of the Home promotional campaign on April 6, 2013.[48] On August 19, 2013, The Washington Post reported that Zuckerberg's Facebook profile was hacked by an unemployed web developer.[49] At the 2013 TechCrunch Disrupt conference, held in September, Zuckerberg stated that he was working towards registering the 5 billion people who were not connected to the Internet as of the conference on Facebook. Zuckerberg then explained that this is intertwined with the aim of the Internet.org project, whereby Facebook, with the support of other technology companies, seeks to increase the number of people connected to the internet.[50][51] Zuckerberg was the keynote speaker at the 2014 Mobile World Congress (MWC), held in Barcelona, Spain, in March 2014, which was attended by 75,000 delegates. Various media sources highlighted the connection between Facebook's focus on mobile technology and Zuckerberg's speech, stating that mobile represents the future of the company.[52] Zuckerberg's speech expands upon the goal that he raised at the TechCrunch conference in September 2013, whereby he is working towards expanding Internet coverage into developing countries.[53] Alongside other American technology figures such as Jeff Bezos and Tim Cook, Zuckerberg hosted visiting Chinese politician Lu Wei, known as the \"Internet czar\" for his influence in the enforcement of China's online policy, at Facebook's headquarters on December 8, 2014. The meeting occurred after Zuckerberg participated in a Q&A session at Tsinghua University in Beijing, China, on October 23, 2014, where he conversed in Mandarin Chinese; although Facebook is banned in China, Zuckerberg is highly regarded among the people and was at the university to help fuel the nation's burgeoning entrepreneur sector.[54] Zuckerberg fielded questions during a live Q&A session at the company's headquarters in Menlo Park on December 11, 2014. The founder and CEO explained that he does not believe Facebook is a waste of time, because it facilitates social engagement, and participating in a public session was so that he could \"learn how to better serve the community\".[55][56] Zuckerberg receives a one-dollar salary as CEO of Facebook.[57] In June 2016, Business Insider named Zuckerberg one of the \"Top 10 Business Visionaries Creating Value for the World\" along with Elon Musk and Sal Khan, due to the fact that he and his wife \"pledged to give away 99% of their wealth-then estimated at $55.0 billion\".[58] On May 25, 2017, at Harvard's 366th commencement day, Zuckerberg, after giving a commencement speech,[59] received an honorary degree from Harvard.[60][61] In January 2019, Zuckerberg laid plans to integrate an end-to-end encrypted system for three major social media platforms, including Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp.[62] On August 14, 2020, Facebook integrated the chat systems for Instagram and Messenger on both iOS and Android devices. The update encouraged cross-communication between Instagram and Facebook users.[63] A month after Zuckerberg launched Facebook in February 2004, i2hub, another campus-only service, created by Wayne Chang and focusing on peer-to-peer file sharing, was launched. At the time, both i2hub and Facebook were gaining the attention of the press and growing rapidly in users and publicity. In August 2004, Zuckerberg, Andrew McCollum, Adam D'Angelo, and Sean Parker launched a competing peer-to-peer file sharing service called Wirehog, a precursor to Facebook Platform applications, which was launched in 2007.[64][65][66] In 2013, Zuckerberg launched Internet.org, which he described as an initiative to provide Internet access to the five billion people without it as of the launch date. The project faced significant opposition in India, where activists said its limited internet ran counter to the principle of net neutrality; Zuckerberg responded by saying that a limited internet was better than no internet. Internet.org was shut down in India in February 2016, although Zuckerberg later met with Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi to discuss further possibilities.[67][68] Zuckerberg is a board member of the solar sail spacecraft development project Breakthrough Starshot, which he co-founded with Yuri Milner and Stephen Hawking in 2016.[69] Harvard students Cameron Winklevoss, Tyler Winklevoss, and Divya Narendra accused Zuckerberg of intentionally making them believe he would help them build a social network called HarvardConnection.com (later called ConnectU).[21] They filed a lawsuit in 2004; it was dismissed on a technicality on March 28, 2007. It was refiled soon thereafter in a federal court in Boston. Facebook countersued in regards to Social Butterfly, a project put out by The Winklevoss Chang Group, an alleged partnership between ConnectU and i2hub. On June 25, 2008, the case settled and Facebook agreed to transfer over 1.2 million common shares and pay $20 million in cash.[70] In November 2007, confidential court documents were posted on the website of 02138, a magazine that catered to Harvard alumni. They included Zuckerberg's Social Security number, his parents' home address, and his girlfriend's address. Although Facebook filed to have the documents removed, the judge ruled in favor of 02138.[71] In 2005, Facebook co-founder Eduardo Saverin filed a lawsuit against Zuckerberg and Facebook, alleging that Zuckerberg had illegally spent Saverin's money on personal expenses. The lawsuit was settled out of court and, although terms of the settlement were sealed, the company affirmed Saverin's title as co-founder of Facebook, and Saverin agreed to stop talking to the press.[72][73] In June 2010, then Pakistani Deputy Attorney General Muhammad Azhar Sidiqque launched a criminal investigation into Zuckerberg and Facebook co-founders Dustin Moskovitz and Chris Hughes after a \"Draw Muhammad\" contest was hosted on Facebook. The investigation also named the anonymous German woman who created the contest. Sidiqque asked the country's police to contact Interpol to have Zuckerberg and the three others arrested for blasphemy. On May 19, 2010, Facebook's website was temporarily blocked in Pakistan until Facebook removed the contest from its website at the end of May. Sidiqque also asked its UN representative to raise the issue with the United Nations General Assembly.[74][75] In June 2010, Paul Ceglia, the owner of a wood pellet fuel company in Allegany County, upstate New York, filed suit against Zuckerberg, claiming 84 percent ownership of Facebook and seeking monetary damages. According to Ceglia, he and Zuckerberg signed a contract on April 28, 2003, that an initial fee of $1,000 entitled Ceglia to 50% of the website's revenue, as well as an additional 1% interest in the business per day after January 1, 2004, until website completion. Zuckerberg was developing other projects at the time, among which was Facemash, the predecessor to Facebook, but did not register the domain name thefacebook.com until January 1, 2004. The Facebook management dismissed the lawsuit as \"completely frivolous\". Facebook spokesman Barry Schnitt told a reporter that Ceglia's counsel had unsuccessfully sought an out-of-court settlement.[76][77] On October 26, 2012, federal authorities arrested Ceglia, charging him with mail and wire fraud and of \"tampering with, destroying and fabricating evidence in a scheme to defraud the Facebook founder of billions of dollars\". Ceglia is accused of fabricating emails to make it appear that he and Zuckerberg discussed details about an early version of Facebook, although after examining their emails, investigators found there was no mention of Facebook in them.[78] Some law firms withdrew from the case before it was initiated and others after Ceglia's arrest.[79][80] In 2014 Zuckerberg purchased 700 acres of land on the Hawaiian island of KauaÊ»i. In January 2017, Zuckerberg filed eight \"quiet title and partition\" lawsuits against hundreds of native Hawaiians to claim small tracts of land that they owned within his acreage.[81] Zuckerberg responded to criticisms in a Facebook post, stating that the lawsuits were a good faith effort to pay the partial owners of the land their \"fair share\".[81] When he learned that Hawaiian land ownership law differs from that of the other 49 states, he dropped the lawsuits. Zuckerberg stated that he regretted not taking the time to understand the process and its history before moving ahead.[82][83] On April 10 and 11, 2018, Zuckerberg testified before the United States Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation regarding the usage of personal data by Facebook in relation to the FacebookâCambridge Analytica data scandal.[84][85] He called the whole affair a breach of trust between Aleksandr Kogan, Cambridge Analytica, and Facebook.[86] Zuckerberg refused requests to appear to give evidence on the matter to a Parliamentary committee in the United Kingdom.[87] On October 1, 2020, the US Senate Commerce Committee unanimously voted to issue subpoenas to the CEOs of three top tech firms, including Zuckerberg, Google's Sundar Pichai and Twitter's Jack Dorsey. The subpoenas aimed to force the CEOs to testify about the legal immunity the law affords tech platforms under Section 230 of the Communications Act of 1934. US Republicans argued that the law unduly protected social media companies against allegations of anti-conservative censorship.[88] On March 25, 2021, Zuckerberg testified before the House Energy and Commerce Committee regarding Facebook's role in the spread of misinformation and hate speech on the platform. During the hearing, he was questioned about Facebook's handling of user data, its role in the January 6, 2021, attack on the US Capitol Building, and its efforts to combat misinformation and hate speech. Zuckerberg acknowledged that Facebook had a responsibility to address these issues and outlined the steps that the company is taking to improve its policies and practices. The hearing was part of a broader effort by Congress to hold tech companies accountable for their role in shaping public discourse and protecting user privacy.[89] In a January 2024 Senate Judiciary Committee hearing on child safety and social media platforms, Zuckerberg, along with other tech CEOs, were questioned about their companies' practices. During the hearing, he apologized to the families of children who were victims of online abuse and harm.[90][91] Court documents allege that Zuckerberg personally rejected Meta's proposals to improve teenagers' mental health. He consistently opposed efforts to enhance well-being on Facebook and Instagram, overriding senior executives such as Instagram head Adam Mosseri and Global Affairs President Nick Clegg, as revealed in an ongoing lawsuit. Internal communications disclosed in the Massachusetts-initiated legal action depict Zuckerberg's resistance to better protect over 30 million teens on Instagram in the U.S., highlighting his substantial influence on Meta's decisions impacting billions of users. These documents also shed light on occasional tensions between Zuckerberg and other Meta officials advocating for improved user well-being.[92] A movie based on Zuckerberg and the founding years of Facebook, The Social Network, was released on October 1, 2010, starring Jesse Eisenberg as Zuckerberg. After Zuckerberg was told about the film, he responded, \"I just wished that nobody made a movie of me while I was still alive.\"[93] Also, after the film's script was leaked on the Internet and it was apparent that the film would not portray Zuckerberg in a wholly positive light, he stated that he wanted to establish himself as a \"good guy\".[94] The film is based on the book The Accidental Billionaires by Ben Mezrich, which the book's publicist once described as \"big juicy fun\" rather than \"reportage\".[95] The film's screenwriter Aaron Sorkin told New York magazine, \"I don't want my fidelity to be the truth; I want it to be storytelling\", adding, \"What is the big deal about accuracy purely for accuracy's sake, and can we not have the true be the enemy of the good?\".[96] Upon winning the Golden Globe Award for Best Picture on January 16, 2011, producer Scott Rudin thanked Facebook and Zuckerberg \"for his willingness to allow us to use his life and work as a metaphor through which to tell a story about communication and the way we relate to each other\".[97] Sorkin, who won for Best Screenplay, retracted some of the impressions given in his script:[98] In January 2011, Zuckerberg made a surprise guest appearance on Saturday Night Live, which was hosted by Jesse Eisenberg. They both said it was the first time they had met.[99] Eisenberg asked Zuckerberg, who had been critical of his portrayal by the film, what he thought of the movie. Zuckerberg replied, \"It was interesting.\"[100] In a subsequent interview about their meeting, Eisenberg explained that he was \"nervous to meet him, because I had spent now, a year and a half thinking about him ...\". He added, \"Mark has been so gracious about something that's really so uncomfortable ... The fact that he would do SNL and make fun of the situation is so sweet and so generous. It's the best possible way to handle something that, I think, could otherwise be very uncomfortable.\"[101][102] According to David Kirkpatrick, former technology editor at Fortune magazine and author of The Facebook Effect: The Inside Story of the Company that is Connecting the World (2011),[103] \"the film is only 40% true ... he is not snide and sarcastic in a cruel way, the way Zuckerberg is played in the movie.\" He says that \"a lot of the factual incidents are accurate, but many are distorted and the overall impression is false\", and concludes that primarily \"his motivations were to try and come up with a new way to share information on the Internet\".[104] Although the film portrayed Zuckerberg's creation of Facebook in order to elevate his stature after not getting into any of the elite final clubs at Harvard, Zuckerberg stated that he had no interest in joining the clubs.[5] Kirkpatrick agreed that the impression implied by the film is \"false\". Karel Baloun, a former senior engineer at Facebook, noted that the \"image of Zuckerberg as a socially inept nerd is overstated ... It is fiction ...\". He likewise dismissed the film's assertion that he \"would deliberately betray a friend\".[104] Zuckerberg voiced himself on an episode of The Simpsons titled \"Loan-a Lisa\", which first aired on October 3, 2010. In the episode, Lisa Simpson and her friend Nelson encounter Zuckerberg at an entrepreneurs' convention. Zuckerberg tells Lisa that she does not need to graduate from college to be wildly successful, referencing Bill Gates and Richard Branson as examples.[105] On October 9, 2010, Saturday Night Live lampooned Zuckerberg and Facebook.[106] Andy Samberg portrayed the role of Zuckerberg. Zuckerberg himself was reported to have been amused, \"I thought this was funny.\"[107] Stephen Colbert awarded a \"Medal of Fear\" to Zuckerberg at the Rally to Restore Sanity and/or Fear on October 30, 2010, \"because he values his privacy much more than he values yours\".[108] Zuckerberg appeared in the climax of 2013 documentary film Terms and Conditions May Apply.[109][110][111] The South Park episode \"Franchise Prequel\" mocked him. According to CNET, he was portrayed as \"a rosy-cheeked bully nerd who utters strange noises, makes peculiar kung fu gestures and turns up wherever he likes in people's houses\".[112] Zuckerberg founded the Startup:Education foundation.[113] It was reported in September 2010 that he had donated $100 million to Newark Public Schools, the public school system of Newark, New Jersey.[114][115] Critics noted the timing of the donation as being close to the release of The Social Network, which painted a somewhat negative portrait of Zuckerberg.[116] Zuckerberg responded to the criticism, saying, \"The thing that I was most sensitive about with the movie timing was, I didn't want the press about The Social Network movie to get conflated with the Newark project. I was thinking about doing this anonymously just so that the two things could be kept separate.\"[117] Newark Mayor Cory Booker stated that he and New Jersey Governor Chris Christie had to convince Zuckerberg's team not to make the donation anonymously.[117] The money was largely wasted, according to journalist Dale Russakoff.[118][119] In 2010, Zuckerberg, Bill Gates, and investor Warren Buffett signed The Giving Pledge, in which they said they would donate to charity at least half of their wealth over the course of time, and invited others among the wealthy to donate 50 percent or more of their wealth to charity.[120] In December 2012, Zuckerberg and his wife Priscilla Chan said that over the course of their lives they would give the majority of their wealth to \"advancing human potential and promoting equality\" in the spirit of The Giving Pledge.[121][122] In December 2013, Zuckerberg announced a donation of 18 million Facebook shares to the Silicon Valley Community Foundation, to be executed by the end of the monthâbased on Facebook's valuation as of then, the shares totaled $990 million in value. Later that month, the donation was recognized as the largest charitable gift on public record for that year.[123] The Chronicle of Philanthropy placed Zuckerberg and his wife at the top of the magazine's annual list of 50 most generous Americans for 2013, having donated roughly $1 billion to charity.[124] In October 2014, Zuckerberg and his wife donated $25 million to combat the Ebola virus disease, specifically the West African Ebola virus epidemic.[125][126] The couple endowed the foundation of the San Francisco General Hospital in February 2015 with $75 million, which was the biggest individual donation to a U.S. public hospital. The hospital honored them by renaming itself as The Priscilla Chan and Mark Zuckerberg San Francisco General Hospital and Trauma Center. Later in 2020, the San Francisco Board of Supervisors passed a near-unanimous, non-binding measure condemning the renaming, citing concerns that a public hospital should not be named after an individual whose social media platform is accused of \"endangering public health, spreading misinformation, and violating privacy\".[127] On December 1, 2015, the couple pledged to transfer 99% of their Facebook shares, then valued at $45 billion, to the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative (CZI).[128] The funds would not be transferred immediately, but over the course of their lives.[129] Instead of forming a charitable corporation to donate the value of the stock to, as Bill Gates, Warren Buffett, Larry Page, Sergey Brin and other billionaires have done, Zuckerberg and Chan chose to use the structure of a limited liability company (LLC). Some journalists and academics have said the CZI conducts philanthrocapitalism.[130][131][132] In 2016, CZI gave $600 million to create the tax-exempt charity Chan Zuckerberg Biohub, a collaborative research space in San Francisco's Mission Bay district near the University of California, San Francisco, with the intent to foster interaction and collaboration between scientists at UCSF, University of California, Berkeley, and Stanford University. Intellectual property generated would be jointly owned by Biohub and the discoverer's home institution. Unlike foundations such as the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, which open up all research funded to unrestricted access and reuse by the public, Biohub retained the right to commercialize any research it funds. Inventors will have the option of making their discoveries open-source, with permission from Biohub.[133][134][135] To increase access to scientific research and promote open science, CZ Biohub requires its investigators and staff scientists to publish submitted manuscripts and related data on preprints servers such as bioRxiv.[136][137] Amidst the COVID-19 pandemic, Zuckerberg donated $25 million to a Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation-backed accelerator that is searching for treatments for the disease.[138] He also announced $25 million in grants to support local journalism that was impacted by the pandemic and $75 million in advertisement purchases in local newspapers by Facebook, Inc., where Facebook would market itself.[139] In 2002, Zuckerberg registered to vote in Westchester County, New York, where he grew up, but did not cast a ballot until November 2008. Then Santa Clara County Registrar of Voters Spokeswoman, Elma Rosas, told Bloomberg that Zuckerberg is listed as \"no preference\" on voter rolls, and he voted in at least two of the past three general elections, in 2008 and 2012.[140][141] Zuckerberg has never revealed his own political affiliation or voting history. In February 2013, Zuckerberg hosted his first ever fundraising event for then New Jersey Governor Chris Christie. His particular interest on this occasion was education reform, and Christie's education reform work focused on teachers unions and the expansion of charter schools.[142][143] Later that year, Zuckerberg hosted a campaign fundraiser for then Newark mayor Cory Booker, who was running in the 2013 New Jersey special Senate election.[144] In September 2010, with the support of Governor Chris Christie, Booker obtained a US$100 million pledge from Zuckerberg to Newark Public Schools.[145] In December 2012, Zuckerberg donated 18 million shares to the Silicon Valley Community Foundation, a community organization that includes education in its list of grant-making areas.[146][147] On April 11, 2013, Zuckerberg led the launch of a 501(c)(4) lobbying group called FWD.us. The founders and contributors to the group were primarily Silicon Valley entrepreneurs and investors, and its president was Joe Green, a close friend of Zuckerberg.[148][149] The goals of the group include immigration reform, improving the state of education in the United States, and enabling more technological breakthroughs that benefit the public,[150][151] yet it has also been criticized for financing ads advocating a variety of oil and gas development initiatives, including drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge and the Keystone XL pipeline.[152] In 2013, numerous liberal and progressive groups, such as The League of Conservation Voters, MoveOn.org, the Sierra Club, Democracy for America, CREDO, Daily Kos, 350.org, and Presente and Progressives United agreed to either not buy or pull their Facebook ads for at least two weeks, in protest of ads funded by FWD.us that were in support of oil drilling and the Keystone XL pipeline, and in opposition to Obamacare among Republican United States senators who back immigration reform.[153] A media report on June 20, 2013, revealed that Zuckerberg actively engaged with Facebook users on his own profile page after the online publication of a FWD.us video. In response to a claim that the FWD.us organization is \"just about tech wanting to hire more people\", the Internet entrepreneur replied, \"The bigger problem we're trying to address is ensuring the 11 million undocumented folks living in this country now and similar folks in the future are treated fairly.\"[154] In June 2013, Zuckerberg joined Facebook employees in a company float as part of the annual San Francisco Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgender Pride Celebration. The company first participated in the event in 2011, with 70 employees, and this number increased to 700 for the 2013 march. The 2013 pride celebration was especially significant, as it followed a U.S. Supreme Court ruling that deemed the Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA) unconstitutional.[155][156] When questioned about the mid-2013 PRISM scandal at the TechCrunch Disrupt conference in September 2013, Zuckerberg stated that the U.S. government \"blew it\". He further explained that the government performed poorly in regard to the protection of the freedoms of its citizens, the economy, and companies.[50] Zuckerberg placed a statement on his Facebook wall on December 9, 2015, which said that he wants \"to add my voice in support of Muslims in our community and around the world\" in response to the aftermath of the November 2015 Paris attacks and the 2015 San Bernardino attack.[157][158][159][160] The statement also said that Muslims are \"always welcome\" on Facebook, and that his position was a result of the fact that, \"as a Jew, my parents taught me that we must stand up against attacks on all communities.\"[161][162] On February 24, 2016, Zuckerberg sent out a company-wide internal memo to employees formally rebuking employees who had crossed out handwritten \"Black Lives Matter\" phrases on the company walls and had written \"All Lives Matter\" in their place. Facebook allows employees to free-write thoughts and phrases on company walls. The memo was then leaked by several employees. As Zuckerberg had previously condemned this practice at previous company meetings, and other similar requests had been issued by other leaders at Facebook, Zuckerberg wrote in the memo that he would now consider this overwriting practice not only disrespectful, but \"malicious as well\". According to Zuckerberg's memo, \"Black Lives Matter doesn't mean other lives don't â it's simply asking that the black community also achieves the justice they deserve.\" The memo also noted that the act of crossing something out in itself \"means silencing speech, or that one person's speech is more important than another's\". Zuckerberg also said in the memo that he would be launching investigations into the incidents.[163][164][165] The New York Daily News interviewed Facebook employees who commented anonymously that, \"Zuckerberg was genuinely angry about the incident and it really encouraged staff that Zuckerberg showed a clear understanding of why the phrase 'Black Lives Matter' must exist, as well as why writing through it is a form of harassment and erasure.\"[163] In January 2017, Zuckerberg criticized Donald Trump's executive order to severely limit immigrants and refugees from some countries.[166] He also funded a state-level ballot initiative for the 2020 general election that would raise taxes by altering California's Proposition 13 to require the tax assessment of commercial and industrial properties in the state at market rate.[167] In Donald Trump's book Save America, published in September 2024, he wrote about Zuckerberg's visits to the White House and wrote \"We are watching him closely, and if he does anything illegal this time he will spend the rest of his life in prison â as will others who cheat in the 2024 Presidential Election.\"[168] Two months later, they dined at the Mar-a-Lago resort, with Zuckerberg aiming to mend his and his firm's relationship with Trump following the election.[169] Around the same time, Meta reportedly donated $1 million to a Trump-related fund.[170] Especially in his twenties, Zuckerberg had financially supported various progressive causes such as immigration reform and social justice. At least among Republicans, he was generally seen as pro-liberal. In an August 2024 letter to the House Judiciary Committee however, Zuckerberg stated he regretted not doing more to resist pressure from the Biden administration to censor content related to COVID-19. He also noted he no longer intends to donate towards election infrastructure; Republicans had seen those contributions as non-neutral, labeling them \"Zuckerbucks\". As of 2024, Zuckerberg has been discouraging employee activism at Facebook, and according to The New York Times, had privately described his politics as leaning towards libertarianism or classical liberalism.[171][172][173][174] Zuckerberg met fellow Harvard student Priscilla Chan at a frat party during his sophomore year. They began dating in 2003.[175] In September 2010, Chan, who was a medical student at the University of California, San Francisco at the time,[176] moved into his rented house in Palo Alto, California.[177][178] They married on May 19, 2012, in the grounds of his mansion in an event that also celebrated her graduation from medical school.[179][180] Zuckerberg revealed in July 2015 that they were expecting a baby girl and that Chan had previously experienced three miscarriages.[181] Their first daughter was born in December 2015.[182] They announced in a Chinese New Year video that their daughter's Chinese name is Chen Mingyu (Chinese: éæå®).[183] Their second daughter was born in August 2017.[184] Zuckerberg and his wife welcomed their third daughter in March 2023 and announced the news across his social media pages.[185] The couple also have a Puli dog named Beast,[186] who has over two million followers on Facebook.[187] Zuckerberg commissioned the visual artist Daniel Arsham to build a 7-foot-tall sculpture of his wife, which was unveiled in 2024.[188] Time named Zuckerberg one of the most influential people in the world in 2008, 2011, 2016, and 2019, and nominated him as a finalist several other times. He was named the Time Person of the Year in 2010, the same year when Facebook eclipsed more than half a billion users.[189] He was also included in the Time 100 AI list in 2024.[190] In December 2016, Zuckerberg was ranked tenth on the Forbes list of the World's Most Powerful People.[191] In the Forbes 400 list of wealthiest Americans in 2023, he was ranked eighth with a personal wealth of $106 billion.[192] In October 2024, he became the second richest person in the world.[193][194] As of December 2024[update], Zuckerberg's net worth was estimated at $219 billion by Forbes, making him the fourth richest person in the world.[195] In 2017, Zuckerberg called for action to stop global warming in a commencement speech at Harvard University.[196] Seven years later, he purchased the mega-yacht Launchpad (formerly Project 1010) for 300 million US-Dollar.[197] That same year, he put the yacht into operation; it emits 40 tons of carbon dioxide per hour,[198] which runs counter to his own call for \"stopping climate change\".[196] Born and raised in a Reform Jewish household, Zuckerberg later identified himself as an atheist. However, he said in 2016 that, \"I went through a period where I questioned things, but now I believe religion is very important.\"[7][199][200] In 2017, he and his wife began a nationwide tour \"to visit every state in the union and learn more about a sliver of the nearly two billion people who regularly use the social network\". He met with farmers and business owners, and spoke at Mother Emanuel, where a shooting took place in 2015.[201][202] In 2022, Zuckerberg took up training in both mixed martial arts (MMA) and Brazilian jiu-jitsu (BJJ), and has been open about his love for the two sports.[203] He competed in a BJJ tournament on May 6, 2023, and won both a silver and gold medal in gi and no gi, competing at white belt.[204] In July 2023, he was promoted to blue belt in Brazilian jiu-jitsu by Dave Camarillo.[205] Four months later, Zuckerberg announced that he was preparing to make his MMA debut but had suffered an anterior cruciate ligament injury in training that required surgery and had delayed this.[206]",

After attending Phillips Exeter Academy, Zuckerberg enrolled at Harvard University in 2002. On February 4, 2004, he launched thefacebook.com (renamed Facebook in 2005), a directory in which fellow Harvard students entered their own information and photos into a template that he had devised. Within two weeks half of the student body had signed up. Zuckerbergâs roommates, Dustin Moskovitz and Chris Hughes, helped him add features and make the site available to other campuses across the country. Facebook quickly became popular as registered users could create profiles, upload photos and other media, and keep in touch with friends. It differed from other social networking sites, however, in its emphasis on real names (and e-mail addresses), or âtrusted connections.â It also laid particular emphasis on networking, with information disseminated not only to each individualâs network of friends but also to friends of friendsâwhat Zuckerberg called the âsocial graph.â In the summer of 2004 the trio moved their headquarters to Palo Alto, California, where Zuckerberg talked venture capitalist Peter Thiel into giving them seed money. Zuckerberg dropped out of Harvard to concentrate on the fledgling company, of which he became CEO and president. In May 2005 Facebook received its first major infusion of venture capital ($12.7 million). Four months later Facebook opened to registration by high-school students. Meanwhile, foreign colleges and universities also began to sign up, and by September 2006 anyone with an e-mail address could join a regional network based on where he or she lived. About that time Zuckerberg turned down a $1 billion buyout offer from Yahoo!, but in 2007 Facebook struck a deal with Microsoft in which the software company paid $240 million for a 1.6 percent stake in Facebook; two years later Digital Sky Technologies purchased a 1.96 percent share for $200 million. In 2008 Zuckerbergâs new worth was estimated at about $1.5 billion. After Facebookâs initial public offering (IPO) of stock in 2012, Zuckerbergâs net worth was estimated at more than $19 billion. In October 2021 Facebook announced that it was changing the name of its parent company to Meta Platforms. The name change reflected an emphasis on the âmetaverseâ, in which users would interact in virtual reality environments.",

He was 37. The Orioles and the University of San Diego announced Matuszâs death Tuesday night, with USD saying it received word from Matuszâs family. They did not announce a cause of death. âOur hearts are heavy tonight as we mourn the passing of former Oriole Brian Matusz,â the Orioles said. âA staple in our clubhouse from 2009-2016, Brian was beloved throughout Birdland, and his passion for baseball and our community was unmatched. He dedicated his time to connecting with any fan he could, was a cherished teammate, and always had a smile on his face.\" The Orioles drafted Matusz with the fourth overall pick in 2008 out of San Diego. âBrian was one of the best players to ever wear a Torero uniform,â San Diego coach Brock Ungricht said. âHis dedication to the USD community and passion for the game of baseball were evident to all who knew him. Brianâs unexpected passing leaves a void in our hearts, but his legacy will continue to inspire us, both on and off the field. We will forever be grateful for his friendship and unwavering support of San Diego baseball.\" Matusz made his major league debut in 2009 and was a starter until shifting to the bullpen down the stretch in 2012. That was the season Baltimore earned a wild card for its first postseason appearance in 15 years. In 2014, Matusz went 2-3 with a 3.48 ERA in 63 relief appearances as the Orioles won the AL East. Baltimore traded Matusz to Atlanta early in the 2016 season, and he eventually caught on with the Chicago Cubs, making one start for them that year in what would be his final big league appearance. ___ AP MLB: https://apnews.com/hub/mlb 24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events",

                "content": "Brian Robert Matusz (/ËmÃ¦tÉs/ MAT-És; February 11, 1987 â January 7, 2025) was an American professional baseball pitcher. He played in Major League Baseball (MLB) for the Baltimore Orioles and the Chicago Cubs from 2009 to 2016. Matusz attended St. Mary's High School in Phoenix, Arizona, graduating in 2005.[1] He enrolled at the University of San Diego, where he played college baseball for the San Diego Toreros as a starting pitcher. Matusz, Josh Romanski, and Matt Couch anchored the Toreros rotation.[2] In 2008, Matusz was named to the West Coast Conference Pitcher of the Year honors and finalist for the Roger Clemens Award.[3] The Baltimore Orioles selected Matusz in the first round, with the fourth overall selection, in the 2008 MLB draft. Matusz signed a contract with the Orioles on August 15, 2008, the deadline to sign draft picks.[3][4] In spring 2009, he was invited to the Orioles spring training. In June 2009, he was promoted from high Single-A (Frederick Keys) to a starting pitcher for the Double-A Bowie Baysox. He struck out 10 batters in his first start for Bowie on June 17. Matusz was named Baseball America's ninth best overall prospect mid-season in 2009.[5] Before the 2010 season, Baseball America named him the fifth best prospect in all of baseball.[6] Matusz made his MLB debut on August 4, 2009, against the Detroit Tigers. On his MLB debut Matusz went five innings, allowing six hits, one earned run and striking out five. He earned a win in his effort. On September 14, the O's decided to shut Matusz down for the remainder of the season, wary of overextending the rookie in his first big league season.[7] He was named a starting pitcher on Baseball America's 2010 All-Rookie Team.[8] Matusz missed the first two months of the 2011 season with an injury.[9] He returned and got six starts and finished with a 1â4 record with an ERA above 7.00 before being demoted to Triple-A Norfolk on June 30 to work on his velocity.[10] He was later recalled and continued to struggle, posting a 1â7 record and 9.84 ERA before his removal from the starting rotation in September.[11][12] Matusz began the 2012 season in the rotation, but was demoted to the bullpen in August. In the bullpen, Matusz excelled, striking out 19 with a 1.35 ERA in 18 appearances. He also did not allow a single inherited runner to score. He pitched the last three months of the season with a rectus abdominis tear, preventing him from sprinting, but not pitching. He had surgery in October to repair the tear, and was expected to be back for spring training.[13] In 2013, Matusz made the transition to full-time reliever, appearing in 65 games. He was 2â1 with a 3.53 ERA for the Orioles.[14][15] On May 23, 2015, Matusz was ejected from the game against the Miami Marlins in the 12th inning for having a foreign substance on his right forearm. He was the second pitcher to be ejected for a foreign substance in that past week. He was suspended for eight games.[16][15] He posted a 2.94 ERA and 10.29 strikeouts per nine innings 58 relief appearances in 2015. On February 4, 2016, Matusz and the Orioles agreed to a one-year deal to avoid arbitration.[17] On May 23, the Orioles traded Matusz and the 76th pick in the 2016 Major League Baseball draft to the Atlanta Braves in return for minor league pitchers Brandon Barker and Trevor Belicek. The Braves designated Matusz for assignment shortly after completing the trade.[18] On June 15, 2016, the Chicago Cubs signed Matusz to a minor league contract. After being employed solely as a reliever since 2012, the Cubs assigned Matusz to be a starter in the minors. On July 30, 2016, the Cubs called him up to start against the Seattle Mariners on July 31.[19] However, after a poor outing in that game, the Cubs designated him for assignment the very next day.[20] He later cleared waivers and was outrighted to the Triple-A Iowa Cubs.[21] Despite only appearing in one game for the Cubs during their 2016 World Series season, he was given a World Series ring.[22] Matusz elected free agency following the season on November 7.[23] On February 13, 2017, Matusz signed a minor league contract with the Arizona Diamondbacks.[24] In 11 games for the TripleâA Reno Aces, he struggled to a 6.11 ERA with 13 strikeouts across 17+2â3 innings pitched. On May 16, Matusz was released by the Diamondbacks organization.[25] On July 23, 2019, Matusz signed with the Acereros de Monclova of the Mexican League.[26] He made one start, going three innings while allowing five hits and five earned runs (15.00 ERA) with three walks and two strikeouts.[27] On August 2, 2019, Matusz signed with the Long Island Ducks of the Atlantic League of Professional Baseball.[28][29] In 46+2â3 innings across nine starts, he went 2â3 with a 4.05 ERA and 45 strikeouts.[30] Matusz's brother, Chris, played college baseball at Iowa Wesleyan University.[31] Matusz died on January 7, 2025. The Baltimore Orioles statement, which made the announcement, gave no official cause of his death.[32]",

Brianâs baseball career took off during his time at St. Maryâs High School in Phoenix. As a junior in 2004, he went 8-2 with a 0.95 ERA and was named first-team All-State for Arizona. During his â05 senior campaign, Matusz went 8-1 with a 0.50 ERA and was selected as the Arizona Player of the Year. After being drafted by the Angels in the fourth round of the 2005 MLB Draft, Matusz opted to instead head to the University of San Diego. He went on to have a standout three-year career for the Toreros, capped by winning West Coast Conference Pitcher of the Year in â08. Matusz, a two-time finalist for the Golden Spikes Award, led the NCAA with 141 strikeouts during his 2008 junior season at San Diego. He recorded 12 wins to go with a 1.71 ERA, the fourth-best single-season mark in the schoolâs history at the time. Matusz finished his collegiate career as the schoolâs all-time leader in strikeouts (396). When Matusz joined the Orioles, the organization was loading up on young pitchers. Baltimore took right-hander Matt Hobgood in the first round in 2009, while starters such as Jake Arrieta, Brad Bergesen, Zack Britton and Chris Tillman were expected to develop into key members of the clubâs rotation for years to come.

He built on those results in â10, recording a 4.30 ERA over 32 starts and finishing fifth in American League Rookie of the Year Award voting. However, that ended up being the southpawâs best MLB season as a starter. He then pitched to a 10.69 ERA in 12 starts in â11 and a 5.42 ERA in 16 starts in â12. But Matusz reinvented himself as a reliever and stuck in the Majors because of it. He had a 1.35 ERA in 18 relief outings in 2012, helping the Orioles end a 15-year postseason drought. He pitched a scoreless one-third of an inning in the AL Wild Card Game win over the Rangers, then posted a 2.08 ERA while pitching in all five games of the AL Division Series vs. the Yankees. Sign up to receive our daily Morning Lineup to stay in the know about the latest trending topics around Major League Baseball. Matusz continued to serve as a reliable left-handed arm out of the bullpen from 2013-15, when he recorded a 3.32 ERA over 186 appearances. He pitched two-thirds of an inning in the AL Championship Series vs. the Royals in â14. Many fans will remember Matusz for his success against Hall of Fame slugger David Ortiz. During Matuszâs peak as a reliever, the Orioles frequently saved the lefty in matchups vs. the Red Sox for a key spot against âBig Papi.â Matusz often had the left-handed-hitting Ortizâs number: The slugger went 4-for-29 (.138) with 13 strikeouts in his career against the southpaw. Matuszâs time in Baltimore ended in 2016, when he had a 12.00 ERA in seven games before being traded to the Braves on May 23 that year. Atlanta released him a week later, and he signed on with the Cubs, pitching in the Minors except for one final big league start on the last day of July. He later pitched for Triple-A Reno in the D-backsâ organization in â17, then made one start in the Mexican League and nine more with the independent Long Island Ducks in â19 before calling it a career. Well-liked by fans and the Baltimore community, Matusz etched his place into Orioles history with his relief performances on the field and his generous actions off of it during a memorable time for the franchise.",

The Celtics have jumped out to a 98-93 lead against the Nuggets. The Celtics came into the matchup with some extra motivation after the defeat they were dealt the last time these two teams faced off. We'll see if they're able to flip the script or if it'll just be more of the same. Boston Celtics @ Denver Nuggets Current Records: Boston 26-10, Denver 20-14 The Nuggets will be in front of their home fans on Tuesday, but a look at the spread shows they might need that home-court advantage. They will host the Boston Celtics at 10:00 p.m. ET at Ball Arena. The Nuggets are strutting in with some offensive muscle as they've averaged 120.8 points per game this season. On Saturday, the Nuggets needed a bit of extra time to put away the Spurs. They came out on top against San Antonio by a score of 122-111. Denver was down 69-57 with 9:09 left in the third quarter but they still came back for the handy 11-point victory. Nikola Jokic was his usual excellent self, almost dropping a triple-double on 46 points, nine rebounds, and ten assists. The team also got some help courtesy of Michael Porter Jr., who dropped a double-double on 28 points and ten rebounds. The Nuggets were working as a unit and finished the game with 32 assists (they're ranked first in assists per game overall). That strong performance was nothing new for the team: they've now racked up at least 29 assists in six consecutive matchups. Meanwhile, the Celtics unfortunately witnessed the end of their three-game winning streak on Sunday. They took a 105-92 hit to the loss column at the hands of the Thunder. The loss hurts even more since Boston was up 65-52 with 1:15 left in the second. Denver has been performing well recently as they've won four of their last five contests, which provided a nice bump to their 20-14 record this season. As for Boston, their defeat dropped their record down to 26-10. While only the Nuggets took care of their fans the last time they played, neither team managed to cover. Looking forward, the Celtics are the favorite in this one, as the experts expect to see them win by 5.5 points. This contest will be their 17th straight as the favorites (so far over this stretch they are 7-9 against the spread). This contest is shaping up to be a blowout: The Nuggets just can't miss this season, having drained 49.8% of their field goals per game (they're ranked second in field goal percentage overall). It's a different story for the Celtics, though, as they've only made 46% of theirs this season. Given the Nuggets' sizable advantage in that area, the Celtics will need to find a way to close that gap. Boston is a solid 5.5-point favorite against Denver, according to the latest NBA odds.

The Celtics won two of the first three, losing to the OKC Thunder on Sunday. The Nuggets, on the other hand, were starting a three-game homestand. Denver was at a disadvantage for the game after Nikola Jokic was ruled out before tip-off due to an unspecified illness. Jokic has been fantastic for the Nuggets this season, with the team looking bad every time he's off the floor. Dario Saric was inserted into the starting lineup in place of the three-time NBA MVP. After the Celtics dominated the first quarter, the Nuggets came roaring back in the second and the game was tied at the half. It was a close game until midway through the fourth quarter when the defending champs took over and took the 118-106 win.

Guttenberg shared his journey of caring for his father, who had kidney problems and required dialysis. He and his sister even went to medical college to learn how to become dialysis technicians. Guttenberg also discussed the grief he experienced after his father's death, and how he wrote a book about his caregiving experience. He emphasized the importance of love and support in caregiving, and how every moment counts. Transcript: Steve Gurney - Positive Aging Community (00:11): Steve, I can't tell you how much I enjoyed Diner the police academy. And when I saw that you were writing a book, that you wrote a book on your caregiving experience, I was so psyched because it's such a lonely journey being a caregiver and when a person like you or an athlete or a politician is transparent about the journey that they went through, we all admire folks like you that are in Hollywood, and I commend you for sharing your story. It's a wonderful book, and I'm really psyched to be chatting with you today. Thank Steve Guttenberg - Actor & Author (00:56): You. I appreciate that. I remember talking to my dad about that. He's an extraordinary guy in a regular life, and I'm a regular guy in an extraordinary life, and we made a good pair. Steve Gurney - Positive Aging Community (01:12): Oh, man. And I tell you, I mean, the first thing is let's, what I was thinking is today maybe we can, I know you only got 30 minutes, so I was going to, let's talk a little bit about your family and how you got into Hollywood, because I think that's a really interesting story. And then let's really dive into your role as a caregiver. And then the other thing is your dad has passed away, and I had love to hear your thoughts on grief, and I think I saw the post of your mom is still with us, right? I saw a post that you did her on Mother's Day. Steve Guttenberg - Actor & Author (01:54): Perfect. Steve Gurney - Positive Aging Community (01:55): Yeah, there's the book. Steve Guttenberg - Actor & Author (01:57): Yeah, I want to show you book. Steve Gurney - Positive Aging Community (02:00): Yeah. There's your dad. And I love that your family was incredibly supportive. In fact, I sort of feel like your family had more faith in you being successful in Hollywood than you did. Steve Guttenberg - Actor & Author (02:18): Well, maybe they did. There's nothing like having a group of people around you that love you and care about you and want you to succeed. And I was very lucky. I left home at 17 to go to Hollywood. And I mean, who would let their kid now leave at 17 years old? I mean, not many people. So I went out there and I went for two weeks to become a movie star, and then I was going to go to college if it didn't work out. And I got a commercial out of nowhere. I got a Kentucky Fried Chicken commercial, and then I got a movie and another movie, and I stayed about a year doing commercials and movies. And out of nowhere I got this feeling that I didn't belong out there anymore. So I decided to quit being an actor and go to Albany State and be a regular kid and study and just have a civilian life. Steve Gurney - Positive Aging Community (03:31): And I love the part of the book where you were there at Albany and you got, I'm not sure if it was the audition for Police academy, but wasn't it your family? Or it was one of the auditions where they still called you there and you were in school and they're like, go back. You'll regret it if you don't give it a shot. And you ended up really breaking through, right? Steve Guttenberg - Actor & Author (03:58): Yeah, yeah. It was a pretty incredible time for me. But I got lucky and I think that was it. I got very, very lucky. And when you get lucky, things happen Steve Gurney - Positive Aging Community (04:17): As we transition into caregiving, let's talk about that, because none of us have a crystal ball in life. And quite frankly, I think we're all sort of hoping that we just go to bed one night and we just don't wake up. But there's a little bit of luck. There's a little bit of, in the changes in our health and folks needing us and having to rely on our loved ones to help us caring. Let's talk a little bit about your dad and that journey of caregiving that you went through, and any words of wisdom that you might be able to give other folks that find themselves in a similar situation. Steve Guttenberg - Actor & Author (05:00): Well, it was quite a surprise when I found out that my dad was having some problems with his kidneys. And I didn't want to really accept it. I didn't want to think that my dad had any weakness in him. And we didn't go to a nephrologist, a kidney doctor until we really had to. And that was probably a mistake. We didn't know how badly his kidneys were functioning. And when we did finally go to a nephrologist, she gave us the news, the disappointing news, that we probably will have to start dialysis at one point. Then my dad had to get an operation and put a fistula in his arm, which means you take a vein and an artery and you meld them together and you make one large vein so that you can cannulate him, which means when you put the needles in his arm, the blood goes in, the blood goes out, and you change the entire body's blood, all the blood, and you chill it to 34 degrees and then put it back into this person. And it was a very difficult process, especially when we were doing it at the dialysis center, Steve Gurney - Positive Aging Community (06:33): Man. So now you're thrown into this role of a caregiver that you probably never expected because especially the way that you describe your dad, he was a police officer, he was just, sounds like he was just such a giving man. What was that process like? And I believe you've got siblings too, right? Steve Guttenberg - Actor & Author (07:01): Yeah, yeah. I've got two sisters and my mom, of course, the idea of dialysis, the process of dialysis, extremely difficult, extremely and tough on the family. When one person gets sick, everybody gets sick. And these dialysis centers, although they're fantastic, DaVita and FIUs, they're, they're lifesavers. They are life sustaining, but they're rooms full of sick people. And that's very difficult to see. And it was very difficult for my dad. And you sit in a room with 20 people all getting dialysis, it's rough. It's very rough. Steve Gurney - Positive Aging Community (07:54): Any words of wisdom to help folks that may find themselves in a similar situation? How did you keep your spirits high? Dad's spirits high, your mom's spirits high? Steve Guttenberg - Actor & Author (08:08): Yeah. You have to consciously remember that you're doing something life sustaining, that you're keeping this person alive and that humor is everything. So you always have to make some jokes about whatever part of the process it is sticking the needles in, taking the needles out, complications that occur. And you always can watch a movie, try to watch comedies while you're doing the dialysis to always have something good to do after dialysis, they're usually, people are very tired, but you could go out to lunch, you can go home and watch something on the television, which is funny and uplifting. Eat something which is within the renal diet, of course, but eat something that you like. Do something you like. Keep active, keep around friends and family and for caregivers, try to take good care of yourself. Your mental health is very important. You're spending so much time with sick people that it's very, very difficult. Steve Gurney - Positive Aging Community (09:28): And I liked how in the book you talked about how challenging that was, but rewarding as well, making the drive from LA to Phoenix where your dad was and having to play tricks on yourself and getting up early and all that. You really recount that very well in the book. So you are going through this. Let me ask you, has this changed your perspective on your own, the next chapters of your life, or did it sort of change the dialogue between you and your mom and the rest of your family on how do we want to live if one of us is faced with another healthcare challenge? Steve Guttenberg - Actor & Author (10:17): No, actually we haven't. There really is not much of a plan because you don't know what's going to hit you. I think the big plan is that I'll be there for whatever you need. That's the big plan. I don't know which way we're going to get attacked, but I'll be there and I'm not going anywhere. And I think that's what really it's all about. Steve Gurney - Positive Aging Community (10:50): I love it. And Steve, on this platform, we talk a lot about these healthcare challenges that people are face and the dialogue that individuals and families have. And one of the things that I always lead in with it's, it's easier. Sometimes it's easier to give than receive. And so when we, like you just said, I will be there for you to your loved ones that can maybe open up a dialogue where it's like, Hey, Steve, if ever anything happens to you, I want you to know I'm there for you. That's right. And that's great. I know it's got to be tough because of how important your dad was in your life, but you lost him. Can you give us insights on the grieving process that you and your family had to go through and any kind of insights there that might be helpful to us? Steve Guttenberg - Actor & Author (11:54): Grief has its own way with you. I really denied that my father was dying, although I knew he was dying and the doctors told me that, but I denied it. I didn't want to say those words. Then even to the last day of his life where his fingers started to turn gray, I was massaging them saying, dad, you're going to be okay. We're going to get your fingers back. And when he died, my sister and I were moving him in his chair, get him a better position, and I put my head to his mouth. I wanted to see if he was breathing. My sister said, what's wrong? She said, I don't know. We had a nurse with us. The nurse put a stethoscope there. She said, he's gone. And I just, I couldn't take it. I was yelling, dad, dad, come back, dad, come back, dad. Dad. And I started doing CPR on him. When you have a cold or a broken leg, you get better when you pass, you don't get better. Very rarely do you come back. I have these stories, people on the operating table coming back, but it was a granite moment just made of granite that I couldn't move that million pound piece of granite and bring my father back. And I sat with him for about three hours before the mortuary came. We all did. Like you're on another planet. And since then, the grief has been tough for me. I'm much better now. It's almost two years, the first year, first few months, it was all that was on my mind, Steve Gurney - Positive Aging Community (14:30): Man. Well, was one of the inspirations to write the book. Did you find writing the book to be therapeutic and help you through that grieving process a little bit? Steve Guttenberg - Actor & Author (14:44): No, actually I didn't find it therapeutic. I found it difficult to relive some of the difficult and happy to relive the joyous moments. And my inspiration for the book was literally, I was in the grocery store and a friend of mine, Jake Steinfeld Steve Gurney - Positive Aging Community (15:05): Body by Jake, right Steve Guttenberg - Actor & Author (15:06): Body by Jake, came up to me and said, I haven't seen you in a long time. What are you doing? So I told him I was spending a lot of time with my dad, been driving back and forth to Arizona, and I am not around much in la and he said, I told him the story about taking care of my dad. He said, I think this is a book. I said, I don't know. He said, yeah, it's a book. It really is. And that's how it happened. Steve Gurney - Positive Aging Community (15:39): Well, I hope you serve as an inspiration to other celebrities and people of note to follow in your footsteps because a lot of the, listen, some of the most amazing caregiving books are written by the everyman that's out there. But like I said, when we came on, knowing that someone like you or an athlete is going through some of the same things that we're all going through can be very helpful. I've got a question from someone and it says, what age did Steve's father pass away? How old was he when he passed away? Steve Guttenberg - Actor & Author (16:16): Oh, thank you for asking. He was 89, but he was actually in his 90th year. When you're born, you become one, but the truth is you're one that whole year. You're in your first year. So he was in his 90th year, and all he wanted to do was be 90, but he passed in July seven 11, July 11th, and his birthday was September 26th. So he never paid his birthday. Steve Gurney - Positive Aging Community (16:54): And how's your mom? How's your mom through this process? And where does your mom live now? Steve Guttenberg - Actor & Author (17:00): My mom lives where my mom and dad lived with my sister and brother-in-Law in Arizona outside of Phoenix, in this beautiful home. And they've got big space. My mom is doing okay. She really misses my dad, and the grief has gotten worse. I think she's doing well, but it's hard. Steve Gurney - Positive Aging Community (17:31): One of the things that, or one element that our community members are often going through is they might have to hire in-home healthcare, or they might have to sort of, when their loved one's health begins declining, you start having a conversation about, oh, should mom or dad move to an assisted living or a community? Did you and your family have to make any of those types of decisions with your dad? Steve Guttenberg - Actor & Author (18:02): No, there was no question about it. Dad was going to stay home and we were going to take care of dad at home, and my sister and I actually went to medical college to learn how to become dialysis technicians, so we couldn't do the dialysis at home, and he wouldn't have to go to the center anymore. Steve Gurney - Positive Aging Community (18:25): It was got another really good question here for you, Steve. How many years were your parents married and what is your fondest memory of your father? Steve Guttenberg - Actor & Author (18:33): Parents were married 65 years. Steve Gurney - Positive Aging Community (18:38): Wow. And what would you say is the fondest memory of your father? Steve Guttenberg - Actor & Author (18:44): The fondest memory is one that I have here in the book. It is a little out of focus. I wonder why. Steve Gurney - Positive Aging Community (18:52): Well, it's because you got a filter on that blurs everything if you can. Oh, blurs Steve Guttenberg - Actor & Author (18:57): Everything a little Steve Gurney - Positive Aging Community (18:58): Bit. There you go. Now I can see it. Yeah, yeah, yeah. And I've been dropping the link in. We're going to have the, where folks can buy it on Amazon, but yeah, no. For those folks that haven't read the book yet, share a little bit about your fondest memory with dad. Steve Guttenberg - Actor & Author (19:22): Fondest memory is, I was doing a pilot for Blake Edwards, the director of the Pink Panther called The Ferret with Robert Loja. And I had a stunt scene when I was supposed to jump from a 30 foot building, and it was my stunt double who was going to do it. And the director, Blake Edwards said to my dad, Mr said, Gutenberg, you look like your son. Do you think you can jump from that building? My dad was a US Army ranger, a paratrooper, and Blake Edwards knew that, and my dad said, yeah, I could jump from there. So the stunt quarter coordinated, a guy named Joe Dunn said, okay, go ahead. So they hooked my dad up and my dad jumped off of the building and he had a rig on and he hit the big pillow, the stunt pillow, and there was Julie Andrews down there and my dad came off and Julie Andrews said, good one, Mr. Gutenberg. And gave him a hug and a kiss, and it was one of the big thrills of my dad's life. Steve Gurney - Positive Aging Community (20:33): Now, the ferret, that was in 1984, right? Is that the, okay, A jazz musician, some awkwardly steps into the shoes of his father, a special agent. I will definitely drop that into chat. For anybody that wants to research it, it's going to have special meaning if any of us can get out there and view that. What is your favorite film or performance that you, what's your most memorable performance that you've been involved with? Steve Guttenberg - Actor & Author (21:12): I don't have a favorite. I just don't. I've done about 70 movies and they're all terrific. Some have performed better than others, some have gotten better reviews than others. Some have made more money than others. One of them was the number one movie of the world that year in box office. Steve Gurney - Positive Aging Community (21:35): Which one was that? Which one was Steve Guttenberg - Actor & Author (21:37): That? Three Men. Steve Gurney - Positive Aging Community (21:39): Oh, that was such a good movie that that was great. Steve Guttenberg - Actor & Author (21:43): But I don't have a favorite. I love 'em all. Steve Gurney - Positive Aging Community (21:46): Okay, I Steve Guttenberg - Actor & Author (21:47): Got it. And I'm pretty lucky people come up to me, just people came up to me in the street today and said, a guy came up to me and said, Hey, I read your book and I love it and I love it, and I love all the stories. And he said, I'm a caretaker for my mom, so I know what that's like. He said, also, by the way, I want to tell you that bedroom window is my favorite movie. I said, really? I did a movie with Isabelle Uper. Great movie. Steve Gurney - Positive Aging Community (22:14): Oh man. Okay. I got a couple of questions. I know you got to go, but I got a couple of questions and then we'll say goodbye. But this is going to be recorded and folks can watch it later if they're not on. Let's see. What have you learned from your experience and what is your message or takeaway to all who read the book as they read it? Steve Guttenberg - Actor & Author (22:36): Say that again. Say the two. Steve Gurney - Positive Aging Community (22:38): What have you learned from your experience and what is the message that you want people to take away from reading your book? Steve Guttenberg - Actor & Author (22:46): I've learned that every moment counts. The moments that nothing is going on, the moments that are exciting, the moments that are boring, the moments that you think you don't need to be where you are, you don't want to be where you are. Those moments are important, and the takeaway from the book is you're going to either be a caregiver or you're going to need a caregiver. That's the way it is. And yeah. Oh, we got to wrap up and that I believe that everybody needs love in their life, and you need to love someone. And when you love someone so much magic occurs. Steve Gurney - Positive Aging Community (23:34): I love it. Steve, thank you so much for your time. It's really an honor to talk to you and I commend you on what you're doing, help celebrate the values and the challenges of caregiving, and we'll all go out and get your book and too. Alright, thanks everybody. Have a great day, Steve, great weekend. Steve Guttenberg - Actor & Author (24:01): Thanks for having me. Appreciate you talking about time to Thank Steve Gurney - Positive Aging Community (24:05): You. Bet. Alright. Alright folks, everybody have a good weekend. Thanks.

                "content": "The Rookie is an American drama series created by Alexi Hawley for ABC. The series stars Nathan Fillion, Alyssa Diaz, Richard T. Jones, Titus Makin Jr., Melissa O'Neil, Afton Williamson, Mekia Cox, Shawn Ashmore, and Eric Winter. It follows John Nolan, a man in his forties, who becomes the oldest rookie at the Los Angeles Police Department (LAPD). It is based on real-life LAPD officer William Norcross, who moved to Los Angeles in 2015 and joined the department in his mid-40s. Produced by 20th Television and Lionsgate Television, The Rookie premiered on October 16, 2018. In April 2024, the series was renewed for a seventh season which premiered on January 7, 2025. The series follows John Nolan, a 45-year-old newly divorced man from Pennsylvania, who, nine months after helping police officers during a bank robbery in his hometown, Foxburg, moves to Los Angeles to pursue a new career as a police officer in the Los Angeles Police Department (LAPD). After graduating from the Police Academy as the oldest rookie on the force, Nolan must navigate the dangerous, unpredictable nature of his job. He is determined to make it in his new career despite the challenges.[1] During an interview, series lead Nathan Fillion said that the drama was inspired by a true story as the LAPD is one of just two agencies that accepts new officers over the age of 37.[2] The man whose story inspired the premise of the show was later revealed to be William Norcross, a college friend of executive producer Jon Steinberg, who based the show on his story. Norcross continues to serve in the LAPD and also as executive producer on The Rookie.[3] On October 26, 2017, ABC announced a straight-to-series order for The Rookie, starring Castle star Nathan Fillion, and written by Castle executive producer and co-showrunner Alexi Hawley. Fillion and Hawley serve as executive producers, along with Mark Gordon, Nicholas Pepper, Michelle Chapman, and Jon Steinberg. The series is produced by ABC Studios and The Mark Gordon Company,[1] and premiered on October 16, 2018.[29] On November 5, 2018, The Rookie was picked up for full season of 20 episodes.[30] On May 10, 2019, ABC renewed the series for a second season which premiered on September 29, 2019.[31][32] On October 28, 2019, the series received a full season order of 20 episodes for the second season.[33] On May 21, 2020, ABC renewed the series for a third season which premiered on January 3, 2021.[34][35] On May 14, 2021, ABC renewed the series for a fourth season, which premiered on September 26, 2021.[36][37] On March 30, 2022, ABC renewed the series for a fifth season which premiered on September 25, 2022.[38][39] On April 17, 2023, ABC renewed the series for a sixth season which premiered on February 20, 2024.[40][41] On February 17, 2024, executive producer and showrunner Alexi Hawley confirmed in an interview with TVLine that the sixth season would contain ten episodes.[42] On April 15, 2024, ABC renewed the series for a seventh season, which premiered on January 7, 2025.[43][44] With the series order in October 2017, Fillion was cast as John Nolan.[1] On February 7, 2018, Afton Williamson and Eric Winter were cast as Talia Bishop and Tim Bradford, respectively.[45] They were shortly followed by Melissa O'Neil as Lucy Chen,[46] Richard T. Jones as Sergeant Wade Grey,[47] Titus Makin as Jackson West,[4] Alyssa Diaz as Angela Lopez,[48] and Mercedes Mason as Captain Zoe Andersen.[6] On August 4, 2019, it was announced that Williamson would not be returning for the second season due to the alleged racial discrimination, sexual harassment, and sexual assault she suffered during the first season.[49] On October 2, 2019, Mekia Cox joined the cast as a new series regular, Nyla Harper, for the second season.[50] In January 2018, Liz Friedlander signed on to direct and executive produce the pilot.[51] Production on the pilot began on March 7, 2018,[52] with filming taking place in Los Angeles, Oxnard, Burbank and New York City.[53] On April 15, 2021, police received a call of a possible shooting while filming was taking place between Hartford Avenue and West 5th Street in Los Angeles. Three gunshots were heard by various eyewitnesses, and the production crew confirmed that no one from the show was injured during the incident. Filming in the area was shut down as a result of the reports, but filming continued at other already scheduled locations.[54] Following the death of cinematographer Halyna Hutchins on October 21, 2021, on the set of the film Rust, live weapons were banned from The Rookie while filming.[55] Prior to the ban, the series occasionally used quarter or half rounds on large outdoor set pieces.[56] Showrunner Alexi Hawley stated that \"any risk is too much risk\" and explained that, going forward, only airsoft guns would be used, with muzzle flashes being added in post production using computer-generated imagery.[57] On July 26, 2019, TVLine reported that Afton Williamson, who portrays Talia Bishop, would not be returning for the second season. While the outlet initially claimed that the split was amicable, Williamson, in a lengthy Instagram post, stated that she left the series due to having \"experienced racial discrimination/racially charged inappropriate comments from the hair department.\"[58] Williamson also alleged that she was sexually harassed by guest star Demetrius Grosse, who portrays Kevin Wolfe in a recurring role, as well as an incident of bullying that escalated into sexual assault at a party; the head of the hair department was identified as Sallie Ciganovich. Williamson claimed that she had gone to the showrunners multiple times with these allegations, but was ignored.[59] Everyone involved in the allegations denied them. An investigation was commissioned through the law firm Mitchell Sillerberg and Knupp along with a third-party firm, EXTTI, which conducted nearly 400 hours of interviews and examined video and other evidence.[60] The results of the investigation were published on September 17, 2019, which found that the allegations made by Williamson had no merit and could not be proven. Williamson stood by her claims, calling the results of the investigation \"heartbreaking\" and postulated that the producers had lied to cover up the truth of what happened.[61] The Rookie is broadcast in the United States on ABC and repeats are syndicated across 95% of the country.[62] The first season aired on Tuesday, while the second season aired on Sunday. The Rookie has been licensed in more than 180 countries and territories.[63] The first season was released on DVD in Region 1 on August 27, 2019,[64] and in Region 4 (Australia) on January 22, 2020.[65] The review aggregation website Rotten Tomatoes reported a 68% approval rating with an average rating of 6.3/10 based on 22 reviews for Season 1. The website's consensus reads, \"Nathan Fillion's reliably likable presence makes The Rookie worth tuning in, even if the show around him isn't particularly memorable.\"[66] Metacritic, which uses a weighted average, assigned a score of 64 out of 100 based on 12 critics, indicating \"generally favorable reviews\".[67] On February 8, 2022, ABC ordered a pilot for a planned FBI spin-off of the series starring Niecy Nash. It was introduced in a two-episode backdoor pilot during Season 4.[87] On March 9, 2022, Kat Foster and Felix Solis joined the cast of the spin-off.[88] Also that month, Frankie Faison joined the cast.[28] On May 13, 2022, ABC gave a series order under the title The Rookie: Feds.[89] It was then reported that the series had undergone creative tweaks that cut Foster's character, Special Agent Casey Fox.[90] In June 2022, Britt Robertson, Kevin Zegers and James Lesure joined the cast as series regulars.[91][92][93] The Rookie: Feds aired from September 27, 2022 to May 2, 2023.[39] It was canceled on November 9, 2023, after one season as a consequence of the 2023 WGA and SAG-AFTRA strikes.[94] On December 5, 2024, it was reported that a second spin-off series was in development.[95] The series would be set in Washington state and center around a \"male cop who is stepping into a new phase of life in his second act\".[96] Created by Hawley, he, Fillion, Norcross, and Chapman would serve as executive producers. The series will be co-produced by Lionsgate Television and 20th Television.[97]",

                "content": "Zion Lateef Williamson (born July 6, 2000) is an American professional basketball player for the New Orleans Pelicans of the National Basketball Association (NBA). He plays the power forward position.[1] Following a freshman-year stint with the Duke Blue Devils, Williamson was selected by the Pelicans with the first overall pick in the 2019 NBA draft. He was named to the NBA All-Rookie First Team in 2020. In 2021, he became the fourth youngest NBA player to be selected to an All-Star game.[2] Born in Salisbury, North Carolina, Williamson attended Spartanburg Day School, where he was a consensus five-star recruit and was ranked among the top five players in the 2018 class. He led his team to three straight state championships and earned South Carolina Mr. Basketball recognition in his senior season. Williamson also left high school as a McDonald's All-American, runner-up for Mr. Basketball USA, and USA Today All-USA first team honoree. In high school, he drew national attention for his slam dunks. In his freshman and only season with Duke, Williamson was named ACC Player of the Year, ACC Athlete of the Year and ACC Rookie of the Year. He set the single-game school scoring record for freshmen in January 2019, claimed ACC Rookie of the Week accolades five times, earned AP Player of the Year, Sporting News College Player of the Year recognition, and won the Wayman Tisdale Award. On July 6, 2000,[1] Williamson was born in Salisbury, North Carolina to Lateef Williamson and Sharonda Sampson.[3] Lateef Williamson was a football defensive lineman at Mayo High School in Darlington, South Carolina, who was a High School All-American in 1993 and had committed to NC State before transferring to Livingstone College.[4][3] Sampson was a sprinter at Livingstone and became a middle school health and physical education teacher.[3] She named Williamson after the biblical location Mount Zion near Jerusalem, taking her grandmother's advice to name him \"something extra special.\"[5] When Williamson reached two years of age, following the death of his maternal grandmother, his family moved to Florence, South Carolina.[4][3] By the time he was five years old, his parents had divorced. His mother later married Lee Anderson, a former Clemson college basketball player.[6][4] Williamson is Baptist.[7] Besides basketball, Williamson played soccer and the quarterback position in football.[5] When he was five years old, he set sights on becoming a college basketball star. At age nine, Williamson began waking up every morning at 5 a.m. to train.[6] He competed in youth leagues with his mother Sharonda Sampson coaching and played for the Sumter Falcons on the Amateur Athletic Union (AAU) circuit, facing opponents four years older than he was.[4] Williamson later began working with his stepfather to improve his skills as a point guard.[6] He joined the basketball team at Johnakin Middle School in Marion, South Carolina, where he was again coached by his mother and averaged 20 points per game. In middle school, Williamson was a point guard and lost only three games in two years.[6] In 2013, he guided Johnakin to an 8â1 record and a conference title.[8] Williamson attended Spartanburg Day School, a small Kâ12 private school in Spartanburg, South Carolina, where he played basketball for the Griffins.[5] Between eighth and ninth grade, he grew from 5 ft 9 in (1.75 m) to 6 ft 3 in (1.91 m).[4] In the summer leading up to his first season, Williamson practiced in the school gym and developed the ability to dunk.[9] At the time, he competed for the South Carolina Hornets AAU team as well, where he was teammates with Ja Morant.[10] As a freshman, Williamson averaged 24.4 points, 9.4 rebounds, 2.8 assists, 3.3 steals and 3.0 blocks, earning All-State and All-Region honors.[11] He also led Spartanburg Day to a South Carolina Independent School Association (SCISA) state championship game appearance.[12] In March 2015, Williamson took part in the SCISA North-South All-Star Game in Sumter, South Carolina.[13] By his second year in high school, he stood 6 ft 6 in (1.98 m).[12] In his sophomore season, Williamson averaged 28.3 points, 10.4 rebounds, 3.9 blocks, and 2.7 steals per game and was named SCISA Region I-2A Player of the Year.[14] He led the Griffins to their first SCISA Region I-2A title in program history.[5] In June 2016, Williamson participated in the National Basketball Players Association (NBPA) Top 100 camp and was its leading scorer.[15] In August, he won the Under Armour Elite 24 showcase dunk contest in New York City.[16] As a junior, Williamson averaged 36.8 points, 13 rebounds, 3 steals, and 2.5 blocks per game.[17] Starting in the 2016â17 season, Williamson was propelled into the national spotlight for his viral highlight videos.[18] In a 73â53 victory over Gray Collegiate Academy at the Chick-fil-A Classic on December 21, he posted a tournament-record 53 points and 16 rebounds, shooting 25-of-28 from the field.[19] On December 30, Williamson recorded 31 points and 14 rebounds to win most valuable player (MVP) at the Farm Bureau Insurance Classic.[20] On January 15, 2017, he received nationwide publicity after rapper Drake wore his jersey in an Instagram post.[21] Williamson surpassed the 2,000-point barrier on January 20, when he tallied 48 points against Oakbrook Preparatory School.[22] On February 14, he led Spartanburg Day past Oakbrook Prep for their first SCISA Region I-2A title, chipping in a game-high 37 points in a 105â49 rout. Williamson broke the state record for most 30-point games in a season, with 27 by the end of the regular season.[23] He repeated as SCISA Region I-2A Player of the Year.[17] High school sports website MaxPreps named him National Junior of the Year and to the High School All-American first team, while USA Today High School Sports gave him All-USA first team recognition.[24][25][26] In June, he appeared on the cover of basketball magazine Slam.[27] In his senior season, Williamson averaged 36.4 points, 11.4 rebounds and 3.5 assists per game.[28] On January 13, 2018, in a nationally televised game at the Hoophall Classic, he scored 36 points as his team lost to Chino Hills High School.[29] On February 17, he posted 37 points, 10 rebounds, and 5 steals, while scoring his 3,000th career point, versus Spartanburg Christian Academy at the SCISA Region I-2A tournament.[30] One week later, Williamson guided Spartanburg Day to its third consecutive SCISA Region I-2A championship after recording 38 points against Trinity Collegiate School.[31] On March 28, Williamson played in the 2018 McDonald's All-American Game, where he scored 8 points in 17 minutes before leaving with a thumb injury.[32][33] The injury also forced him to miss the Jordan Brand Classic and Nike Hoop Summit in the following month.[34] For his 2017â18 high school season, Williamson was named to the USA Today All-USA first team and MaxPreps All-American second team.[35][36] He additionally earned South Carolina Mr. Basketball recognition and was runner-up for Mr. Basketball USA.[37][38] Wofford offered Williamson his first college basketball scholarship when he was a freshman in high school.[39] By the end of his sophomore season, he had received offers from 16 NCAA Division I programs, including Clemson, Florida, and South Carolina.[14] On August 30, 2016, he received a scholarship offer from Duke.[40] Entering his junior season, he was a consensus five-star recruit and was ranked the number one player in the 2018 class by recruiting service 247Sports.[41] In a live ESPN telecast on January 20, 2018, Williamson committed to Duke.[42][43] He explained the decision, stating: \"Duke stood out because the brotherhood represents a family. (Mike Krzyzewski) is just the most legendary coach that ever coached college basketball. I feel like going to Duke University, I can learn a lot from him.\"[43] Duke, who had landed RJ Barrett and Cam Reddish in addition to Williamson, became the first team to land the top three recruits in a class since modern recruiting rankings began.[44] Williamson's stepfather, Lee Anderson, remarked that Clemson lost a \"mile-and-a-half lead\" in recruiting Williamson.[45] Sources: On November 6, 2018, in his first regular season game with Duke, Williamson scored 28 points on 11-of-13 shooting in 23 minutes in a 118â84 win over Kentucky at the Champions Classic.[46] In that game, he and teammate RJ Barrett each broke the Duke freshman debut scoring record set by Marvin Bagley III.[47] In his following game, a 94â72 victory over Army, Williamson tallied 27 points, 16 rebounds, and six blocks.[48] He became the second player in school history to record at least 25 points, 15 rebounds, and 5 blocks in a game.[49] Williamson was subsequently named both player and freshman of the week in the Atlantic Coast Conference (ACC).[49] On January 5, 2019, he had another strong performance versus Clemson, with 25 points, 10 rebounds, and a 360-degree dunk in 22 minutes.[50] Two days later, Williamson earned ACC Freshman of the Week honors for a second time.[51] On January 12, against Florida State, he was poked in the left eye by an opposing player towards the second half and missed the remainder of the game.[52] Williamson returned in Duke's next game, a 95â91 overtime loss to Syracuse, and erupted for 35 points, 10 rebounds, and 4 blocks.[53] He eclipsed the Duke freshman record for single-game points previously held by Marvin Bagley III and JJ Redick.[54] On January 21, Williamson collected his third ACC Freshman of the Week accolade.[55] One week later, he scored 26 points and grabbed 9 rebounds in an 81â63 victory over Notre Dame.[56] By recording nine 25-point games in the season, Williamson set a new Duke freshman record.[57] On February 4, 2019, Williamson was named ACC Freshman of the Week on his fourth occasion, while earning a National Player of the Week distinction from the Naismith Trophy.[58] He had his third 30-point game of the season on February 16, scoring 32 points in a 94â78 victory over NC State.[59] The performance helped him claim his second ACC Player of the Week and fifth ACC Freshman of the Week accolades.[60] In a February 20 game versus North Carolina, Williamson suffered a Grade 1 knee sprain 36 seconds into the contest after his foot ripped through his Nike shoe, causing him to slip.[61][62] He did not return to the game, which Duke lost, 88â72.[63] Nike saw the value of its stock drop by $1.1 billion the following day as a result of the incident.[64][65] The injury resulted in criticism of the NCAA for not paying student-athletes.[66][67][68] Williamson was held out from the final six games of the regular season.[69] When the regular season concluded, Williamson earned Player of the Year and Rookie of the Year honors in the ACC, joining former Duke players Jahlil Okafor and Marvin Bagley III as the only recipients of both awards. Williamson was also named ACC Athlete of the Year, becoming the 10th Duke player to win the Award.[70] He additionally made the ACC All-Defensive and All-Freshman teams.[71] Sporting News named Williamson as its Player of the Year and Freshman of the Year.[72] Williamson returned from injury on March 14, posting 29 points, 14 rebounds, and 5 steals in an 84â72 win over Syracuse in the quarterfinals of the ACC tournament.[73] He shot 13-of-13 from the field, marking the best shooting performance in school and tournament history, while tying the record for the best shooting performance in ACC history.[74] Williamson also became the first Duke player to record at least 25 points, 10 rebounds, and 5 steals in a game since Christian Laettner did so in 1992.[75] The next day, he scored 31 points (including the game-winning shot) to help Duke defeat North Carolina, 74â73, in the ACC Tournament semifinals.[76] After posting 21 points in a 73â63 victory over Florida State in the championship game, Williamson was named ACC Tournament MVP, becoming the sixth freshman to win the honor.[77] For the 2019 NCAA tournament, official broadcast partner CBS specifically devoted a cameraâcalled the \"Zion Cam\"âto record Williamson throughout the tournament.[78] In his NCAA Tournament debut on March 22, he scored 25 points in an 85â62 win over 16th-seeded North Dakota State.[79] On March 24, Williamson erupted for 32 points, 11 rebounds, and four assists in a 77â76 second-round victory over UCF.[80] Williamson led all scorers on March 31, with 24 points and 14 rebounds in a season-ending 68â67 loss to Michigan State in the Elite 8.[81] In 33 appearances in his freshman season, he averaged 22.6 points, 8.9 rebounds, 2.1 steals, and 1.8 blocks per game.[82] He shot 68% from the field, which led the ACC, ranked second in the NCAA Division I, and was the highest-ever field goal percentage by a freshman.[83][84] In addition, Williamson joined Kevin Durant and Anthony Davis as one of the only freshmen in history to collect 500 points, 50 steals, and 50 blocks in a season.[84] On April 15, 2019, Williamson declared his eligibility for the 2019 NBA draft.[85] On June 20, 2019, the New Orleans Pelicans drafted Williamson with the first pick in the 2019 NBA draft.[86][87][88] On July 1, 2019, Williamson officially signed with the Pelicans.[89] Williamson tore his meniscus on October 13, 2019, during the preseason of his rookie campaign.[90] Williamson made his professional debut three months later on January 22, 2020, in a 121â117 loss to the San Antonio Spurs. He played 18 minutes and finished with 22 points and 7 rebounds, scoring 17 consecutive points in 3:08 minutes during the fourth quarter.[91] In his first eight games, Williamson scored at least 20 points in four consecutive games, the longest streak by any rookie of the season; he also tied the longest streak in the Pelicans franchise history, scoring at least 20 points in six of his eight games, and tying the record for the seventh-most among all rookies (fellow rookie Ja Morant had the most with 19) after a 125â119 win over the Chicago Bulls on February 7.[92] On February 24, he led the Pelicans to a 115â101 win over the Golden State Warriors. With 28 points on 13/20 shooting in a season-high 33 minutes of play, Williamson was just one game behind Carmelo Anthony for most consecutive 20-point games as a teenager at 8.[93] He would later become the first teenager in NBA history to score at least 20 points in 10 consecutive games.[94] On March 1, Williamson scored then career-high 35 points, along with 7 rebounds, in a 122â114 loss to the Los Angeles Lakers.[95] Williamson finished his rookie season averaging 22.5 points on 58.3 percent shooting from the floor, 6.3 rebounds, and 2.1 assists per game. He ranked first among all rookies in points per game, second in rebounds per game and first in offensive rebounds per game. He became the first rookie since Michael Jordan to post 16 20-point games within their first 20 contests while also logging the highest scoring average through his first 24 career NBA games since Jordan in 1983.[96] On September 15, Williamson was named to the NBA All-Rookie First Team.[96][97][98] On February 12, 2021, Williamson scored a then career high 36 points in a 143â130 defeat against the Dallas Mavericks; he finished the game on 14-of-15 shooting from the field, making him the youngest player in NBA history with 30 points on 90 percent shooting.[99] On February 23, 2021, Williamson was selected into his first NBA All-Star Game.[2] On March 21, 2021, Williamson scored 30 points and 6 rebounds in a 113â108 win over the Denver Nuggets.[100] During the season, Williamson tied Kareem Abdul-Jabbar's record for the longest streak of at least 20-point games on 50-percent shooting within his first two seasons since the shot clock era in 1954â55. The streak eventually grew to 25 consecutive games, surpassing Hall-of-Famers Wilt Chamberlain and Karl Malone[101][102] while tying Shaquille O'Neal's record of 25 consecutive such games,[103] with no other player having had a longer streak since the three-point era in 1980; his streak of 20-points games on 50-percent shooting and attempt to surpass O'Neal's record ended in a 139â111 loss to the Brooklyn Nets on April 7.[104] During the off-season, Williamson suffered a Jones fracture in his right foot and underwent a subsequent surgery. In late-September, team officials were hopeful that he would be ready to return by the start of the season.[105] By mid-October, the timeline for his expected return was extended until December.[106] In mid-December, it was announced that the injury was slow to heal and he would most likely be out another four to six weeks with a possible return to action around the all-star break.[107] In mid-March, it was announced that Williamson would not play that season.[108] On July 6, 2022, Williamson signed a five-year rookie extension with the New Orleans Pelicans worth $193 million guaranteed, increasing to $231 million if he made an All-NBA team in the 2022â2023 season.[109] Williamson made his return from injury on October 4, 2022, putting up 13 points, four rebounds, one assist, and one steal in a 129â125 preseason win over the Chicago Bulls.[110] On October 19, Williamson made his regular season return, putting up 25 points, nine rebounds, three assists, and four steals in a 130â108 win over the Brooklyn Nets.[111] On December 2, Williamson scored 30 points and matched career highs with 15 rebounds and eight assists in an 117â99 win over the San Antonio Spurs.[112] On December 9, Zion put up a then season-high 35 points, along with seven rebounds, four steals, and one block in a 126â117 win against the Phoenix Suns. A final dunk he made in the last seconds of the game caused an altercation between the Pelicans and Suns.[113] On December 12, Williamson was named the NBA Western Conference Player of the Week for Week 8 (December 5â11), his first NBA Player of the Week award. He led New Orleans to an undefeated 3â0 week with averages of 33.0 points and 8.3 rebounds on 70.4% shooting from the field.[114] On December 28, Williamson put up a career-high 43 points in a 119â118 win over the Minnesota Timberwolves.[115] Williamson was sidelined on January 2, 2023, with a hamstring injury. At first, team officials were hopeful that he would be ready to return by the end of January.[116] On January 26, 2023, Williamson was selected for his second NBA All-Star appearance.[117] However, due to his unavailability, Williamson was replaced by Anthony Edwards.[118] On February 13, team officials indicated that Williamson would miss multiple weeks after the All-Star break.[119] Subsequently, team officials confirmed in early April that Williamson would miss the remainder of the regular season.[120] Subsequently, Williamson sat out the Pelicans appearance in their play-in game against the Oklahoma City Thunder, which New Orleans lost, ending their season.[121] On November 29, 2023, Wiliamson recorded 33 points on 11-of-12 shooting from the field, 11-of-12 from the free throw line along with eight rebounds, six assists, and three steals in a 124â114 win over the Philadelphia 76ers.[122] On February 2, 2024, Williamson put up 33 points, eight rebounds, and a game-winning layup in a 114â113 win over the San Antonio Spurs.[123] On April 16, Wiliamson in his first play-in appearance scored 40 points, grabbed 11 rebounds and dished out 5 assists in a 110â106 loss against the Los Angeles Lakers. His NBA postseason debut was cut short by an injury in the final minutes of the game.[124] Williamson is listed at 6 ft 6 in (1.98 m) tall and weighs 284 pounds (129 kg).[125][126] Despite his heavy weight for a basketball player, he is known for his speed and leaping ability.[127][128] NBA player Kevin Durant described him as a \"once-in-a-generation type athlete\" while an anonymous college basketball coach labeled him a \"freak of nature.\"[129][130] Williamson plays the power forward position but is also capable of being a small-ball center.[131] He has been described as not fitting a specific basketball position.[132] His physical attributes have drawn comparisons to former NBA stars Charles Barkley, Anthony Mason, and Larry Johnson.[133][134] In addition, according to different analysts, he resembles NBA players LeBron James and Julius Randle.[132] Lee Sartor, Williamson's high school coach, reported that basketball coach Roy Williams told Williamson \"that he was probably one of the best high school players he's seen since Michael Jordan.\"[135] Williamson, who is left-handed, is almost ambidextrous.[132] While in high school, Williamson drew national attention for his slam dunks.[136] The Charlotte Observer remarked that he \"could be the best high-school dunker in history.\"[137] NBA point guard John Wall has likened Williamson's in-game dunking ability to that of Vince Carter.[138] Williamson's outside shooting has been considered a point of concern, and he has unorthodox shot mechanics.[4][9][139] Recruiting service 247Sports has praised his ball handling and passing skills for his size, commenting that they are \"overshadowed by [his] athletic plays.\"[140] Williamson has the ability to defend multiple positions well due to his speed and length, although his defensive effort has been questioned.[141] He is a skilled shot-blocker and rebounder.[142] At various points during his NBA career, Williamson has received criticism in the media from basketball observers who perceive him to be overweight.[143][144][145][146] Prior to the start of the 2021â2022 season, Williamson's weight increased to over 300 lbs.[145] Williamson lost weight in 2022.[147] In 2023, however, retired basketball players Charles Barkley and Shaquille O'Neal each expressed concerns about Williamson's weight.[148][149] Williamson's 2022 contract extension with the New Orleans Pelicans provides for salary reductions in the event that Williamson fails to maintain his weight and body fat percentage at specified levels.[150] Since the inaugural In-Season Tournament during the 2023 season, Williamson has seen significant improvements to his physique, losing 25 lbs.[151] On July 23, 2019, Williamson signed a five-year, $75 million shoe deal with Jordan brand.[152] Williamson's deal is the second-largest rookie shoe deal in history, trailing only LeBron James's $90 million rookie deal signed in 2003.[153] On March 13, 2020, Williamson pledged to pay for the salaries of all the employees of the Smoothie King Center for 30 days during the suspension of the 2019â20 NBA season, which was caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. He was one of several basketball players to help the arena workers.[154] In June 2023, Williamson announced his girlfriend's pregnancy in a baby shower YouTube video with the couple expecting a daughter due in November.[155] This announcement led adult film star Moriah Mills to claim on Twitter that she had a recent affair with Williamson.[156]",

                "title": "Zion Williamson looks great in return to Pelicans lineup as depressing cycle starts back at beginning - CBSSports.com",
                "content": "If not listed, please contact your TV provider. Zion Williamson made his return for the New Orleans Pelicans on Tuesday after a 27-game absence with a bum hamstring. He looked great. For starters, he clearly kept himself in shape while he was out, which is no small matter after two months of relative inactivity. He could have ballooned. He didn't. In fact, he appeared to be about as slim as he's looked in a long time, and it showed in his bounce and overall athleticism. The Pelicans lost to the Minnesota Timberwolves, 107-97, but who cares. Now 7-30, New Orleans' season is over at this point. Two things matter more than anything else between now and April: Can the Pelicans find a trade for Brandon Ingram, and can Williamson stay healthy the rest of the way and reinstall some organizational confidence that he's a player to continue to building around? With Williamson, the ability is abundantly obvious. He finished with 22 points, six rebounds, four assists and three steals on 9-of-15 shooting. The Pelicans were plus-8 in his 28 minutes. Williamson is still nearly impossible to keep from getting to his left hand. His downhill force when he does so is practically unstoppable. He pushed in transition and still jumps out of the gym, as evidenced by blocking a Rudy Gobert shot at its peak, ripping down an in-traffic offensive rebound and scoring the put-back for his first bucket, and this 50-foot alley-oop dunk in the first quarter. A healthy Zion is still so special pic.twitter.com/5j6Svgaytg Then there was this 360 piece on one of his three steals later on. ZION 360 WINDMILL COME ON NOW ð¤¯ð¤¯ pic.twitter.com/hGuQ1R7FjW Here's a full look at Williamson's highlights: So Williamson's shape and performance are the good news. The bad news is we've seen this story before, and to this point it has just never resulted in anything substantial for the Pelicans. It hasn't always been on account of Williamson's inconsistent health; there have been other injuries at terrible times. But Williamson is the franchise in New Orleans and the simple truth is the franchise is failing. It's failing to the point, in fact, that trading Williamson has become a legitimate topic of conversation. And one of main reasons it's not an even hotter topic is nobody is quite sure what anyone would even give up to get him, which is really saying something for player of such tremendous and unique abilities. Every time Williamson puts together a decent streak of health, like when he played 70 games last season, he ends up hurt, like when he was dominating the Lakers in last year's play-in game until he tore his hamstring in the fourth quarter and that was the end of that. This is the seventh game he's played this season. It's January, if you haven't noticed. So once again, New Orleans will get its hopes up with the way Williamson played on Tuesday night, but the sad fact is we are simply back at the beginning at the depressing cycle of Zion. He plays great, gets hurt, sits out, comes back strong, everyone gets excited, then he goes down again. Everyone will continue to hope that somehow this is the time the cycle ends because Williamson is so electric and the Pelicans and the league at large benefit so much from him being on the court and in top shape. But I wouldn't bet much on that being the case. There is just too much evidence suggesting this will be another short-lived stint of health, so let's enjoy it while we can.

                "title": "What's next for Zion Williamson? The 'hardest question in the NBA' - ESPN",
                "content": "Ramona Shelburne and Tim Bontemps discuss Zion Williamson being ranked No. 16 on ESPN's NBA top 25 under 25 list. (1:23) With a driving floater over Los Angeles Lakers big man Anthony Davis, Zion Williamson tied the score with just over three minutes remaining in the New Orleans Pelicans' first-round play-in game and sent the fans at the Smoothie King Center into a frenzy. Williamson's fourth basket in four minutes marked a team-high 40 points, giving fans what they hoped to see since the Pelicans drafted him No. 1 overall in 2019. But Williamson landed awkwardly and limped off the floor with a towel over his head during the next timeout. He didn't play the rest of the game and ultimately the remainder of the postseason, the familiar pain in his left hamstring prematurely ending another Pelicans season. Williamson could only watch as the top-seeded Oklahoma City Thunder swept New Orleans in the first round. Williamson played in a career-high 70 games last season, but it was the second playoff trip he missed due to injury. Six seasons into his career, he has yet to play in a playoff game. \"He's dominant when he plays,\" a rival general manager told ESPN. \"But when's the last time you've seen him play?\" The answer: Nov. 6, when Williamson scored 29 points in 29 minutes in a loss to the Cleveland Cavaliers. He missed the previous two games because of left hamstring tightness and has been sidelined since due to a strain in that muscle. At this point, Williamson's career has been defined more by his durability issues -- and conditioning concerns -- than his sensational drives and dunks. He has played only 190 games (plus the one abbreviated play-in outing) in 5Â½ seasons since arriving in New Orleans with hope and hype of being a franchise savior. Williamson's extensive injury history is why he agreed to one of the rarest contracts in NBA history: a maximum deal that requires him to earn guaranteed money as he goes, which could factor into Williamson's trade value if New Orleans explores the market for him. His $36.2 million salary for this season becomes fully guaranteed Jan. 7. As a result, Williamson and the Pelicans could be approaching a crossroads. Should the Pelicans continue to build around an incredible talent who has proven thus far to be a poor foundation for a franchise? Are there better alternatives? Right now, the 5-28 Pelicans, whose playoff hopes have been destroyed by a series of injuries to the rotation, are focused on moving one of Williamson's teammates ahead of the Feb. 6 trade deadline. Finding a trade for injured forward Brandon Ingram, a one-time All-Star in a contract year whose extension talks have repeatedly fizzled, is the priority for the Pelicans' front office, sources told ESPN. Williamson changed representation after suffering the latest injury, hiring WME's Bill Duffy, a longtime agent who also represents stars such as Luka Doncic, Anthony Edwards and Chet Holmgren. Sources told ESPN that Duffy has no intention to push for the Pelicans to trade Williamson before the deadline. The team announced Dec. 24 that Williamson will be \"week-to-week going forward\" after his expected return to practice in the final days of December. The focus -- for all parties involved -- is to get Williamson back on the floor without further injury interruption. \"Let's ramp him up and create value for him,\" a source said, \"whether that's with the Pelicans or another team.\" The Pelicans wrote multiple escape clauses into the five-year, $197 million extension Williamson signed after missing the 2021-22 season. New Orleans paid Williamson as a franchise player but included language that protected the franchise if Williamson missed more than 22 games in the 2022-23 or 2023-24 season. He missed 53 in 2022-23, meaning Williamson's salaries in the remaining three seasons ($38.9 million in 2025-26, $41.5 million in 2026-27 and $44.2 million in 2027-28) are non-guaranteed. \"It is one the best contracts in the NBA,\" an Eastern Conference executive told ESPN. \"But looking back, it is hard to argue that any team would have guaranteed Zion $197 million without conditions in the extension.\" There are mechanisms for the non-guaranteed seasons to become fully or partially protected if Williamson satisfies weigh-in criteria set by New Orleans -- there are seven such dates during the season, with Williamson needing a combined weight and body fat percentage below 295 -- and plays in a certain number of games in the previous season. He would have to meet these criteria in the prior season for his contract to become partially or fully protected in the next season: 20% if Williamson satisfies the weigh-in criteria 40% if he plays in 41 games 20% if he plays in 51 games 20% if he plays in 61 games For example, if Williamson played in 61 games this season and meets the weigh-in criteria, his $38.9 million salary in 2025-26 would be guaranteed. The remaining two seasons, however, would remain non-guaranteed. Sources told ESPN that Williamson is on track to reach the weight benchmarks, however, he has already missed 26 games this season, making it impossible for him to hit the 61-game mark. Once the weight clause criteria is met, the guaranteed portion for next season increases from $0 to $7.8 million. The non-guaranteed portion of his salary becomes guaranteed if Williamson is on the roster after 5 p.m. ET on July 15. But missing the benchmarks doesn't reduce Williamson's salary -- just the amount that is guaranteed. To receive any financial benefit, New Orleans would have to take the unprecedented step of waiving Williamson. However, the Pelicans do not consider releasing Williamson to create financial flexibility to be a feasible option, according to sources with knowledge of the franchise's thinking. The small-market Pelicans know they never have been considered an attractive destination for free agents, so they don't believe slicing payroll by releasing Williamson would be a realistic path to improving the roster. In the unlikely scenario that New Orleans waives Williamson before July 15, when $38.9 million of his salary for 2025-26 becomes guaranteed, the Pelicans could have up to $30 million in cap space -- but would have to replace both Williamson and Ingram, who account for a combined 45 points per game when healthy. Still, even without releasing Williamson, the unique structure of his contract could be a valuable tool for the Pelicans. Kendrick Perkins explains why he would like to see Zion Williamson traded to the Warriors. If the Pelicans and Williamson eventually part ways, it probably would be much different from the previous two times New Orleans traded its face of the franchise. Chris Paul and Anthony Davis succeeded in forcing their way out of town despite the franchise's desire to keep the future Hall of Famers. This time, it could be the Pelicans who reach the conclusion that it's in the franchise's best interests to move on from Williamson. One East executive, however, called gauging Williamson's trade value \"the hardest question to answer in the NBA right now.\" \"It's really hard to see anybody paying a ton for him right now, but there are a very limited number of players in the league when healthy who are at or near the franchise-player tier,\" the East executive said. \"The only way you win at the highest level is to have a guy who can do the type of things he can do if he's healthy. \"I would probably do something stupid to get him if it were me making decisions.\" One executive suggested that the Pelicans could benefit by trading Williamson as a contract, not a talent. Such a deal would require finding a trade partner, likely a team that has crossed into the harsh second apron of the salary cap, that is desperate for financial relief.

In this scenario, the Pelicans could flip Williamson's cuttable contract into a quality player (or two). Perhaps the Pelicans could even squeeze some draft capital out of the deal. \"That makes sense,\" one general manager said when asked about the possibility. \"But who are they going to get? Khris Middleton?\" There could also be a middle ground for a trade suitor. Willamson's contract would allow a team to acquire a superstar on a trial basis. Several executives polled agreed that Williamson's talent -- as rarely as it has been on display -- would still generate some interest in the trade market. As one general manager said, \"We've seen worse players have value despite injuries.\" Added another: \"It's a risk, but some team might take the risk.\" ESPN talked to two team executives at the recent G-League showcase in Orlando and both pointed to Golden State as a logical fit for Williamson. The Warriors have $40 million in expiring contracts, up to three first-round picks to trade, young players in Jonathan Kuminga, Brandin Podziemski and the $26.2 million salary of Andrew Wiggins. As ESPN's Shams Charania reported in December, the Warriors are exploring the market for an All-Star to pair next to Stephen Curry. After winning the title in 2022, the Warriors failed to reach the playoffs in 2023. They are currently fighting for a play-in spot and have just four wins this month. A GM brainstorming potential Williamson deals mentioned the Chicago Bulls, who have been shopping guard Zach LaVine for several months, as a possible fit. LaVine, 29, has his own durability issues and a contract due to pay him $95 million over the next two seasons. But he has reminded the league of his talent level by averaging 22.0 points per game with a 63.4% true shooting percentage this season. \"I bet Chicago would do that,\" the general manager said of a hypothetical deal built around swapping Williamson for LaVine. After pondering it for a few seconds, the GM said he'd decline such an offer if he were running the Pelicans. An executive for another team speculated that the market for Williamson at this point would be a late first-round pick and salary filler for a good team willing to gamble that he could vault it into contender status. \"Take a swing and work on his body,\" the executive said. \"It would be complicated with his salary, but I think it would be doable.\" Other league sources believed that if the Pelicans moved Williamson, their best bet would be reaching out to rebuilding teams. \"Maybe there's a bad team that needs a star,\" another West executive said. \"I don't think he's getting a premium picks package, but the guy has proven that when he's healthy, he's a star.\"",

                "content": "California (/ËkÃ¦lÉªËfÉËrnjÉ/ ) is a state in the Western Region of the United States that lies on the Pacific Coast. It borders Oregon to the north, Nevada and Arizona to the east, and shares an international border with the Mexican state of Baja California to the south. With over 39 million residents across an area of 163,696 square miles (423,970 km2),[11] it is the most populous U.S. state, the third-largest by area, and most populated subnational entity in North America. Prior to European colonization, California was one of the most culturally and linguistically diverse areas in pre-Columbian North America. European exploration in the 16th and 17th centuries led to the colonization by the Spanish Empire. The area became a part of Mexico in 1821, following its successful war for independence, but was ceded to the United States in 1848 after the MexicanâAmerican War. The California gold rush started in 1848 and led to social and demographic changes, including depopulation of Indigenous tribes. The western portion of Alta California was then organized and admitted as the 31st state in 1850, as a free state, following the Compromise of 1850. The Greater Los Angeles and San Francisco Bay areas are the nation's second- and fifth-most populous urban regions, with 19 million and 10 million residents respectively.[12] Los Angeles is the state's most populous city and the nation's second-most; California's capital is Sacramento. Part of the Californias region of North America, the state's diverse geography ranges from the Pacific Coast and metropolitan areas in the west to the Sierra Nevada mountains in the east, and from the redwood and Douglas fir forests in the northwest to the Mojave Desert in the southeast. Two-thirds of the nation's earthquake risk lies in California.[13] The Central Valley, a fertile agricultural area, dominates the state's center. The large size of the state results in climates that vary from moist temperate rainforest in the north to arid desert in the interior, as well as snowy alpine in the mountains. Droughts and wildfires are an ongoing issue,[14] while simultaneously, atmospheric rivers are turning increasingly prevalent and leading to intense flooding eventsâespecially in the winter. California has the nation's largest economy with a gross state product of $4.132 trillion as of Q3 2024.[15] It is the world's largest sub-national economy, and would by most estimations rank 5th globally by nominal GDP.[16][17] The state also leads the nation in agricultural output,[18][19][20] led by its production of dairy, almonds, and grapes.[21] With the busiest port in the country (Los Angeles), California plays a pivotal role in the global supply chain, hauling in about 40% of goods imported to the US.[22] Notable contributions to popular culture, ranging from entertainment, sports, music, and fashion, have their origins in California. California is the home of Hollywood, the oldest and one of the largest film industries in the world, profoundly influencing global entertainment. The San Francisco Bay and the Greater Los Angeles areas are seen as the centers of the global technology and U.S. film industries, respectively.[23] The Spaniards gave the name Las Californias to the peninsula of Baja California (in modern-day Mexico). As Spanish explorers and settlers moved north and inland, the region known as California, or Las Californias, grew. Eventually it included lands north of the peninsula, Alta California, part of which became the present-day U.S. state of California. A 2017 state legislative document states, \"Numerous theories exist as to the origin and meaning of the word 'California,'\" and that all anyone knows is the name was added to a map by 1541 \"presumably by a Spanish navigator.\"[24] The name most likely derived from the mythical island of California in the fictional story of Queen Calafia, as recorded in a 1510 work The Adventures of EsplandiÃ¡n by Garci RodrÃ­guez de Montalvo.[25] Queen Calafia's kingdom was said to be a remote land rich in gold and pearls, inhabited by beautiful Black women who wore gold armor and lived like Amazons, as well as griffins and other strange beasts.[25][26][27] Abbreviations of the state's name include CA, Cal., Calif., Califas, and US-CA. California was one of the most culturally and linguistically diverse areas in pre-Columbian North America.[28] Historians generally agree that there were at least 300,000 people living in California prior to European colonization.[29] The Indigenous peoples of California included more than 70 distinct ethnic groups, inhabiting environments ranging from mountains and deserts to islands and redwood forests.[30] Living in these diverse geographic areas, the indigenous peoples developed complex forms of ecosystem management, including forest gardening to ensure the regular availability of food and medicinal plants.[31][32] This was a form of sustainable agriculture.[33] To mitigate destructive large wildfires from ravaging the natural environment, indigenous peoples developed a practice of controlled burning.[34] This practice was recognized for its benefits by the California government in 2022.[35] These groups were also diverse in their political organization, with bands, tribes, villages, and, on the resource-rich coasts, large chiefdoms, such as the Chumash, Pomo and Salinan. Trade, intermarriage, craft specialists, and military alliances fostered social and economic relationships between many groups. Although nations would sometimes war, most armed conflicts were between groups of men for vengeance. Acquiring territory was not usually the purpose of these small-scale battles.[36] Men and women generally had different roles in society. Women were often responsible for weaving, harvesting, processing, and preparing food, while men for hunting and other forms of physical labor. Most societies also had roles for people whom the Spanish referred to as joyas,[37] who they saw as \"men who dressed as women\".[38] Joyas were responsible for death, burial, and mourning rituals, and they performed women's social roles.[38] Indigenous societies had terms such as two-spirit to refer to them. The Chumash referred to them as 'aqi.[38] The early Spanish settlers detested and sought to eliminate them.[39] The first Europeans to explore the coast of California were the members of a Spanish maritime expedition led by Portuguese captain Juan RodrÃ­guez Cabrillo in 1542. Cabrillo was commissioned by Antonio de Mendoza, the Viceroy of New Spain, to lead an expedition up the Pacific coast in search of trade opportunities; they entered San Diego Bay on September 28, 1542, and reached at least as far north as San Miguel Island.[40] Privateer and explorer Francis Drake explored and claimed an undefined portion of the California coast in 1579, landing north of the future city of San Francisco. The first Asians to set foot on what would be the United States occurred in 1587, when Filipino sailors arrived in Spanish ships at Morro Bay.[41][42] Coincidentally the descendants of the Muslim Caliph Hasan ibn Ali in formerly Islamic Manila and had converted, then mixed Christianity with Islam, upon Spanish conquest, transited through California (Named after a Caliph) on their way to Guerrero, Mexico[43] where they played a future role in the wars of independence. SebastiÃ¡n VizcaÃ­no explored and mapped the coast of California in 1602 for New Spain, putting ashore in Monterey.[44] Despite the on-the-ground explorations of California in the 16th century, RodrÃ­guez's idea of California as an island persisted. Such depictions appeared on many European maps well into the 18th century.[45] The PortolÃ¡ expedition of 1769â70 was a pivotal event in the Spanish colonization of California, resulting in the establishment of numerous missions, presidios, and pueblos. The military and civil contingent of the expedition was led by Gaspar de PortolÃ¡, who traveled over land from Sonora into California, while the religious component was headed by JunÃ­pero Serra, who came by sea from Baja California. In 1769, PortolÃ¡ and Serra established Mission San Diego de AlcalÃ¡ and the Presidio of San Diego, the first religious and military settlements founded by the Spanish in California. By the end of the expedition in 1770, they would establish the Presidio of Monterey and Mission San Carlos Borromeo de Carmelo on Monterey Bay. After the PortolÃ  expedition, Spanish missionaries led by Father-President Serra set out to establish 21 Spanish missions of California along El Camino Real (\"The Royal Road\") and along the California coast, 16 sites of which having been chosen during the PortolÃ¡ expedition. Numerous major cities in California grew out of missions, including San Francisco (Mission San Francisco de AsÃ­s), San Diego (Mission San Diego de AlcalÃ¡), Ventura (Mission San Buenaventura), and Santa Barbara (Mission Santa Barbara), among others. Juan Bautista de Anza led a similarly important expedition throughout California in 1775â76, which would extend deeper into the interior and north of California. The Anza expedition selected numerous sites for missions, presidios, and pueblos, which subsequently would be established by settlers. Gabriel Moraga, a member of the expedition, would also christen many of California's prominent rivers with their names in 1775â1776, such as the Sacramento River and the San Joaquin River. After the expedition, Gabriel's son, JosÃ© JoaquÃ­n Moraga, would found the pueblo of San Jose in 1777, making it the first civilian-established city in California. During this same period, sailors from the Russian Empire explored along the northern coast of California. In 1812, the Russian-American Company established a trading post and small fortification at Fort Ross on the North Coast.[46][47] Fort Ross was primarily used to supply Russia's Alaskan colonies with food supplies. The settlement did not meet much success, failing to attract settlers or establish long term trade viability, and was abandoned by 1841. During the War of Mexican Independence, Alta California was largely unaffected and uninvolved in the revolution,[48] though many Californios supported independence from Spain, which many believed had neglected California and limited its development.[49] Spain's trade monopoly on California had limited local trade prospects. Following Mexican independence, California ports were freely able to trade with foreign merchants. Governor Pablo Vicente de SolÃ¡ presided over the transition from Spanish colonial rule to independent Mexican rule. In 1821, the Mexican War of Independence gave the Mexican Empire (which included California) independence from Spain. For the next 25 years, Alta California remained a remote, sparsely populated, northwestern administrative district of the newly independent country of Mexico, which shortly after independence became a republic. The missions, which controlled most of the best land in the state, were secularized by 1834 and became the property of the Mexican government.[50] The governor granted many square leagues of land to others with political influence. These huge ranchos or cattle ranches emerged as the dominant institutions of Mexican California. The ranchos developed under ownership by Californios (Hispanics native of California) who traded cowhides and tallow with Boston merchants. Beef did not become a commodity until the 1849 California Gold Rush. From the 1820s, trappers and settlers from the United States and Canada began to arrive in Northern California. These new arrivals used the Siskiyou Trail, California Trail, Oregon Trail and Old Spanish Trail to cross the rugged mountains and harsh deserts in and surrounding California. The early government of the newly independent Mexico was highly unstable, and in a reflection of this, from 1831 onwards, California also experienced a series of armed disputes, both internal and with the central Mexican government.[51] During this tumultuous political period Juan Bautista Alvarado was able to secure the governorship during 1836â1842.[52] The military action which first brought Alvarado to power had momentarily declared California to be an independent state, and had been aided by Anglo-American residents of California,[53] including Isaac Graham.[54] In 1840, one hundred of those residents who did not have passports were arrested, leading to the Graham Affair, which was resolved in part with the intercession of Royal Navy officials.[53] One of the largest ranchers in California was John Marsh. After failing to obtain justice against squatters on his land from the Mexican courts, he determined that California should become part of the United States. Marsh conducted a letter-writing campaign espousing the California climate, the soil, and other reasons to settle there, as well as the best route to follow, which became known as \"Marsh's route\". His letters were read, reread, passed around, and printed in newspapers throughout the country, and started the first wagon trains rolling to California.[55] After ushering in the period of organized emigration to California, Marsh became involved in a military battle between the much-hated Mexican general, Manuel Micheltorena and the California governor he had replaced, Juan Bautista Alvarado. At the Battle of Providencia near Los Angeles, he convinced each side that they had no reason to be fighting each other. As a result of Marsh's actions, they abandoned the fight, Micheltorena was defeated, and California-born Pio Pico was returned to the governorship. This paved the way to California's ultimate acquisition by the United States.[56][57][58][59][60] In 1846, a group of American settlers in and around Sonoma rebelled against Mexican rule during the Bear Flag Revolt. Afterward, rebels raised the Bear Flag (featuring a bear, a star, a red stripe and the words \"California Republic\") at Sonoma. The Republic's only president was William B. Ide,[61] who played a pivotal role during the Bear Flag Revolt. This revolt by American settlers served as a prelude to the later American military invasion of California and was closely coordinated with nearby American military commanders. The California Republic was short-lived;[62] the same year marked the outbreak of the MexicanâAmerican War (1846â1848).[63] Commodore John D. Sloat of the United States Navy sailed into Monterey Bay in 1846 and began the U.S. military invasion of California, with Northern California capitulating in less than a month to the United States forces.[64] In Southern California, Californios continued to resist American forces. Notable military engagements of the conquest include the Battle of San Pasqual and the Battle of Dominguez Rancho in Southern California, as well as the Battle of OlÃ³mpali and the Battle of Santa Clara in Northern California. After a series of defensive battles in the south, the Treaty of Cahuenga was signed by the Californios on January 13, 1847, securing a censure and establishing de facto American control in California.[65] Following the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo (February 2, 1848) that ended the war, the westernmost portion of the annexed Mexican territory of Alta California soon became the American state of California, and the remainder of the old territory was then subdivided into the new American Territories of Arizona, Nevada, Colorado and Utah. The even more lightly populated and arid lower region of old Baja California remained as a part of Mexico. In 1846, the total settler population of the western part of the old Alta California had been estimated to be no more than 8,000, plus about 100,000 Native Americans, down from about 300,000 before Hispanic settlement in 1769.[66] In 1848, only one week before the official American annexation of the area, gold was discovered in California, this being an event which was to forever alter both the state's demographics and its finances. Soon afterward, a massive influx of immigration into the area resulted, as prospectors and miners arrived by the thousands. The population burgeoned with United States citizens, Europeans, Middle Easterns, Chinese and other immigrants during the great California gold rush. By the time of California's application for statehood in 1850, the settler population of California had multiplied to 100,000. By 1854, more than 300,000 settlers had come.[67] Between 1847 and 1870, the population of San Francisco increased from 500 to 150,000.[68] The seat of government for California under Spanish and later Mexican rule had been located in Monterey from 1777 until 1845.[50] Pio Pico, the last Mexican governor of Alta California, had briefly moved the capital to Los Angeles in 1845. The United States consulate had also been located in Monterey, under consul Thomas O. Larkin. In 1849, a state Constitutional Convention was first held in Monterey. Among the first tasks of the convention was a decision on a location for the new state capital. The first full legislative sessions were held in San Jose (1850â1851). Subsequent locations included Vallejo (1852â1853), and nearby Benicia (1853â1854); these locations eventually proved to be inadequate as well. The capital has been located in Sacramento since 1854[69] with only a short break in 1862 when legislative sessions were held in San Francisco due to flooding in Sacramento. Once the state's Constitutional Convention had finalized its state constitution, it applied to the U.S. Congress for admission to statehood. On September 9, 1850, as part of the Compromise of 1850, California became a free state and September 9 a state holiday. During the American Civil War (1861â1865), California sent gold shipments eastward to Washington in support of the Union.[70] However, due to the existence of a large contingent of pro-South sympathizers within the state, the state was not able to muster any full military regiments to send eastwards to officially serve in the Union war effort. Still, several smaller military units within the Union army, such as the \"California 100 Company\", were unofficially associated with the state of California due to a majority of their members being from California. At the time of California's admission into the Union, travel between California and the rest of the continental United States had been a time-consuming and dangerous feat. Nineteen years later, and seven years after it was greenlighted by President Lincoln, the first transcontinental railroad was completed in 1869. California was then reachable from the eastern States in a week's time. Much of the state was extremely well suited to fruit cultivation and agriculture in general. Vast expanses of wheat, other cereal crops, vegetable crops, cotton, and nut and fruit trees were grown (including oranges in Southern California), and the foundation was laid for the state's prodigious agricultural production in the Central Valley and elsewhere. In the nineteenth century, a large number of migrants from China traveled to the state as part of the Gold Rush or to seek work.[71] Even though the Chinese proved indispensable in building the transcontinental railroad from California to Utah, perceived job competition with the Chinese led to anti-Chinese riots in the state, and eventually the US ended migration from China partially as a response to pressure from California with the 1882 Chinese Exclusion Act.[72] Under earlier Spanish and Mexican rule, California's original native population had precipitously declined, above all, from Eurasian diseases to which the Indigenous people of California had not yet developed a natural immunity.[75] Under its new American administration, California's first governor Peter Hardeman Burnett instituted policies that have been described as a state-sanctioned policy of elimination of California's indigenous people.[76] Burnett announced in 1851 in his Second Annual Message to the Legislature: \"That a war of extermination will continue to be waged between the races until the Indian race becomes extinct must be expected. While we cannot anticipate the result with but painful regret, the inevitable destiny of the race is beyond the power and wisdom of man to avert.\"[77] As in other American states, indigenous peoples were forcibly removed from their lands by American settlers, like miners, ranchers, and farmers. Although California had entered the American union as a free state, the \"loitering or orphaned Indians\", were de facto enslaved by their new Anglo-American masters under the 1850 Act for the Government and Protection of Indians.[78] One of these de facto slave auctions was approved by the Los Angeles City Council and occurred for nearly twenty years.[79] There were many massacres in which hundreds of indigenous people were killed by settlers for their land.[80] Between 1850 and 1860, the California state government paid around 1.5 million dollars (some 250,000 of which was reimbursed by the federal government)[81] to hire militias with the stated purpose of protecting settlers, however these militias perpetrated numerous massacres of indigenous people.[74][80] Indigenous people were also forcibly moved to reservations and rancherias, which were often small and isolated and without enough natural resources or funding from the government to adequately sustain the populations living on them.[74] As a result, settler colonialism was a calamity for indigenous people. Several scholars and Native American activists, including Benjamin Madley and Ed Castillo, have described the actions of the California government as a genocide,[74][73] as well as the 40th governor of California Gavin Newsom.[82] Benjamin Madley estimates that from 1846 to 1873, between 9,492 and 16,092 indigenous people were killed, including between 1,680 and 3,741 killed by the U.S. Army.[73] In the 20th century, thousands of Japanese people migrated to California. The state in 1913 passed the Alien Land Act, excluding Asian immigrants from owning land.[83] During World War II, Japanese Americans in California were interned in concentration camps;[84] in 2020, California apologized.[85] Migration to California accelerated during the early 20th century with the completion of transcontinental highways like the Route 66. From 1900 to 1965, the population grew from fewer than one million to the greatest in the Union. In 1940, the Census Bureau reported California's population as 6% Hispanic, 2.4% Asian, and 90% non-Hispanic white.[86] To meet the population's needs, engineering feats like the California and Los Angeles Aqueducts; the Oroville and Shasta Dams; and the Bay and Golden Gate Bridges were built. The state government adopted the California Master Plan for Higher Education in 1960 to develop an efficient system of public education. Meanwhile, attracted to the mild Mediterranean climate, cheap land, and the state's variety of geography, filmmakers established the studio system in Hollywood in the 1920s. California manufactured 9% of US armaments produced during World War II, ranking third behind New York and Michigan.[87] California easily ranked first in production of military ships at drydock facilities in San Diego, Los Angeles, and the San Francisco Bay Area.[88][89][90][91] Due to the hiring opportunities California offered during the conflict, the population multiplied from the immigration it received due to the work in its war factories, military bases, and training facilities.[92] After World War II, California's economy expanded due to strong aerospace and defense industries,[93] whose size decreased following the end of the Cold War.[93][94] Stanford University began encouraging faculty and graduates to stay instead of leaving the state, and develop a high-tech region, now known as Silicon Valley.[95] As a result of this, California is a world center of the entertainment and music industries, of technology, engineering, and the aerospace industry, and as the US center of agricultural production.[96] Just before the Dot Com Bust, California had the fifth-largest economy in the world.[97] In the mid and late twentieth century, race-related incidents occurred. Tensions between police and African Americans, combined with unemployment and poverty in inner cities, led to riots, such as the 1992 Rodney King riots.[98][99] California was the hub of the Black Panther Party, known for arming African Americans to defend against racial injustice.[100][101] Mexican, Filipino, and other migrant farm workers rallied in the state around Cesar Chavez for better pay in the 1960s and 70s.[102] During the 20th century, two great disasters happened: the 1906 San Francisco earthquake and 1928 St. Francis Dam flood remain the deadliest in U.S. history.[103] Although air pollution has been reduced, health problems associated with pollution continue. Brown haze known as \"smog\" has been substantially abated after federal and state restrictions on automobile exhaust.[104][105] An energy crisis in 2001 led to rolling blackouts, soaring power rates, and the importation of electricity from neighboring states. Southern California Edison and Pacific Gas and Electric Company came under heavy criticism.[106] Housing prices in urban areas continued to increase; a modest home which in the 1960s cost $25,000 would cost half a million dollars or more in urban areas by 2005. More people commuted longer hours to afford a home in more rural areas while earning larger salaries in the urban areas. Speculators bought houses, expecting to make a huge profit in months, then rolling it over by buying more properties. Mortgage companies were compliant, as people assumed prices would keep rising. The bubble burst in 2007â8 as prices began to crash. Hundreds of billions in property values vanished and foreclosures soared, as financial institutions and investors were badly hurt.[107][108] In the 21st century, droughts and frequent wildfires attributed to climate change have occurred.[109][110] From 2011 to 2017, a persistent drought was the worst in its recorded history.[111] The 2018 wildfire season was the state's deadliest and most destructive.[112] One of the first confirmed COVID-19 cases in the United States occurred in California on January 26, 2020.[113][114] A state of emergency was declared in the state on March 4, 2020, and remained in effect until Governor Gavin Newsom ended it in February 2023.[115] A mandatory statewide stay-at-home order was issued on March 19, 2020, which was ended in January 2021.[116] Cultural and language revitalization efforts among indigenous Californians have progressed among tribes as of 2022.[117][118] Some land returns to indigenous stewardship have occurred.[119][120][121] In 2022, the largest dam removal and river restoration project in US history was announced for the Klamath River, as a win for California tribes.[122][123] Covering an area of 163,696 sq mi (423,970 km2), California is the third-largest state in the United States in area, after Alaska and Texas.[124] California is one of the most geographically diverse states in the union and is often geographically bisected into two regions, Southern California, comprising the ten southernmost counties,[125][126] and Northern California, comprising the 48 northernmost counties.[127][128] It is bordered by Oregon to the north, Nevada to the east and northeast, Arizona to the southeast, the Pacific Ocean to the west and shares an international border with the Mexican state of Baja California to the south (with which it makes up part of The Californias region of North America, alongside Baja California Sur). In the middle of the state lies the California Central Valley, bounded by the Sierra Nevada in the east, the coastal mountain ranges in the west, the Cascade Range to the north and by the Tehachapi Mountains in the south. The Central Valley is California's productive agricultural heartland. Divided in two by the Sacramento-San Joaquin River Delta, the northern portion, the Sacramento Valley serves as the watershed of the Sacramento River, while the southern portion, the San Joaquin Valley is the watershed for the San Joaquin River. Both valleys derive their names from the rivers that flow through them. With dredging, the Sacramento and the San Joaquin Rivers have remained deep enough for several inland cities to be seaports. The Sacramento-San Joaquin River Delta is a critical water supply hub for the state. Water is diverted from the delta and through an extensive network of pumps and canals that traverse nearly the length of the state, to the Central Valley and the State Water Projects and other needs. Water from the Delta provides drinking water for nearly 23 million people, almost two-thirds of the state's population as well as water for farmers on the west side of the San Joaquin Valley. Suisun Bay lies at the confluence of the Sacramento and San Joaquin Rivers. The water is drained by the Carquinez Strait, which flows into San Pablo Bay, a northern extension of San Francisco Bay, which then connects to the Pacific Ocean via the Golden Gate strait. The Channel Islands are located off the Southern coast, while the Farallon Islands lie west of San Francisco. The Sierra Nevada (Spanish for \"snowy range\") includes the highest peak in the contiguous 48 states, Mount Whitney, at 14,505 feet (4,421 m).[3][4][note 1] The range embraces Yosemite Valley, famous for its glacially carved domes, and Sequoia National Park, home to the giant sequoia trees, the largest living organisms on Earth, and the deep freshwater lake, Lake Tahoe, the largest lake in the state by volume. To the east of the Sierra Nevada are Owens Valley and Mono Lake, an essential migratory bird habitat. In the western part of the state is Clear Lake, the largest freshwater lake by area entirely in California. Although Lake Tahoe is larger, it is divided by the California/Nevada border. The Sierra Nevada falls to Arctic temperatures in winter and has several dozen small glaciers, including Palisade Glacier, the southernmost glacier in the United States. The Tulare Lake was the largest freshwater lake west of the Mississippi River. A remnant of Pleistocene-era Lake Corcoran, Tulare Lake dried up by the early 20th century after its tributary rivers were diverted for agricultural irrigation and municipal water uses.[129] About 45 percent of the state's total surface area is covered by forests,[130] and California's diversity of pine species is unmatched by any other state. California contains more forestland than any other state except Alaska. Many of the trees in the California White Mountains are the oldest in the world; an individual bristlecone pine is over 5,000 years old.[131][132] In the south is a large inland salt lake, the Salton Sea. The south-central desert is called the Mojave; to the northeast of the Mojave lies Death Valley, which contains the lowest and hottest place in North America, the Badwater Basin at â279 feet (â85 m).[5] The horizontal distance from the bottom of Death Valley to the top of Mount Whitney is less than 90 miles (140 km). Indeed, almost all of southeastern California is arid, hot desert, with routine extreme high temperatures during the summer. The southeastern border of California with Arizona is entirely formed by the Colorado River, from which the southern part of the state gets about half of its water. A majority of California's cities are located in either the San Francisco Bay Area or the Sacramento metropolitan area in Northern California; or the Los Angeles area, the Inland Empire, or the San Diego metropolitan area in Southern California. The Los Angeles Area, the Bay Area, and the San Diego metropolitan area are among several major metropolitan areas along the California coast. As part of the Ring of Fire, California is subject to tsunamis, floods, droughts, Santa Ana winds, wildfires, and landslides on steep terrain; California also has several volcanoes. It has many earthquakes due to several faults running through the state, the largest being the San Andreas Fault. About 37,000 earthquakes are recorded each year; most are too small to be felt.[133] Among Americans at risk of serious harm from a major earthquake, two-thirds of that population are residents of California.[13] Most of the state has a Mediterranean climate. The cool California Current offshore often creates summer fog near the coast. Farther inland, there are colder winters and hotter summers. The maritime moderation results in the shoreline summertime temperatures of Los Angeles and San Francisco being the coolest of all major metropolitan areas of the United States and uniquely cool compared to areas on the same latitude in the interior and on the east coast of the North American continent. Even the San Diego shoreline bordering Mexico is cooler in summer than most areas in the contiguous United States. Just a few miles inland, summer temperature extremes are significantly higher, with downtown Los Angeles being several degrees warmer than at the coast. The same microclimate phenomenon is seen in the climate of the Bay Area, where areas sheltered from the ocean experience significantly hotter summers and colder winters in contrast with nearby areas closer to the ocean.[134][135][136] Northern parts of the state have more rain than the south. California's mountain ranges also influence the climate: some of the rainiest parts of the state are west-facing mountain slopes. Coastal northwestern California has a temperate climate, and the Central Valley has a Mediterranean climate but with greater temperature extremes than the coast. The high mountains, including the Sierra Nevada, have an alpine climate with snow in winter and mild to moderate heat in summer. California's mountains produce rain shadows on the eastern side, creating extensive deserts. The higher elevation deserts of eastern California have hot summers and cold winters, while the low deserts east of the Southern California mountains have hot summers and nearly frostless mild winters. Death Valley, a desert with large expanses below sea level, is considered the hottest location in the world; the highest temperature in the world,[137][138] 134 Â°F (56.7 Â°C), was recorded there on July 10, 1913. The lowest temperature in California was â45 Â°F (â43 Â°C) on January 20, 1937, in Boca.[139] The table below lists average temperatures for January and August in a selection of places throughout the state; some highly populated and some not. This includes the relatively cool summers of the Humboldt Bay region around Eureka, the extreme heat of Death Valley, and the mountain climate of Mammoth in the Sierra Nevada. The wide range of climates leads to a high demand for water. Over time, droughts have been increasing due to climate change and overextraction,[141] becoming less seasonal and more year-round, further straining California's electricity supply[142] and water security[143][144] and having an impact on California business, industry, and agriculture.[145] In 2022, a new state program was created in collaboration with indigenous peoples of California to revive the practice of controlled burns as a way of clearing excessive forest debris and making landscapes more resilient to wildfires. Native American use of fire in ecosystem management was outlawed in 1911, yet has now been recognized.[14] California is one of the ecologically richest and most diverse parts of the world, and includes some of the most endangered ecological communities. California is part of the Nearctic realm and spans a number of terrestrial ecoregions.[146] California's large number of endemic species includes relict species, which have died out elsewhere, such as the Catalina ironwood (Lyonothamnus floribundus). Many other endemics originated through differentiation or adaptive radiation, whereby multiple species develop from a common ancestor to take advantage of diverse ecological conditions such as the California lilac (Ceanothus).[citation needed] Many California endemics have become endangered, as urbanization, logging, overgrazing, and the introduction of exotic species have encroached on their habitat. California boasts several superlatives in its collection of flora: the largest trees, the tallest trees, and the oldest trees. California's native grasses are perennial plants,[147] and there are close to hundred succulent species native to the state.[148] After European contact, these were generally replaced by invasive species of European annual grasses; and, in modern times, California's hills turn a characteristic golden-brown in summer.[149] Because California has the greatest diversity of climate and terrain, the state has six life zones which are the lower Sonoran Desert; upper Sonoran (foothill regions and some coastal lands), transition (coastal areas and moist northeastern counties); and the Canadian, Hudsonian, and Arctic Zones, comprising the state's highest elevations.[150] Plant life in the dry climate of the lower Sonoran zone contains a diversity of native cactus, mesquite, and paloverde. The Joshua tree is found in the Mojave Desert. Flowering plants include the dwarf desert poppy and a variety of asters. Fremont cottonwood and valley oak thrive in the Central Valley. The upper Sonoran zone includes the chaparral belt, characterized by forests of small shrubs, stunted trees, and herbaceous plants. Nemophila, mint, Phacelia, Viola, and the California poppy (Eschscholzia californica, the state flower) also flourish in this zone, along with the lupine, more species of which occur here than anywhere else in the world.[150] The transition zone includes most of California's forests with the redwood (Sequoia sempervirens) and the \"big tree\" or giant sequoia (Sequoiadendron giganteum), among the oldest living things on earth (some are said to have lived at least 4,000 years). Tanbark oak, California laurel, sugar pine, madrona, broad-leaved maple, and Douglas-fir also grow here. Forest floors are covered with swordfern, alumnroot, barrenwort, and trillium, and there are thickets of huckleberry, azalea, elder, and wild currant. Characteristic wild flowers include varieties of mariposa, tulip, and tiger and leopard lilies.[151] The high elevations of the Canadian zone allow the Jeffrey pine, red fir, and lodgepole pine to thrive. Brushy areas are abundant with dwarf manzanita and ceanothus; the unique Sierra puffball is also found here. Right below the timberline, in the Hudsonian zone, the whitebark, foxtail, and silver pines grow. At about 10,500 feet (3,200 m), begins the Arctic zone, a treeless region whose flora include a number of wildflowers, including Sierra primrose, yellow columbine, alpine buttercup, and alpine shooting star.[150][152] Palm trees are a well-known feature of California, particularly in Southern California and Los Angeles; many species have been imported, though the Washington filifera (commonly known as the California fan palm) is native to the state, mainly growing in the Colorado Desert oases.[153] Other common plants that have been introduced to the state include the eucalyptus, acacia, pepper tree, geranium, and Scotch broom. The species that are federally classified as endangered are the Contra Costa wallflower, Antioch Dunes evening primrose, Solano grass, San Clemente Island larkspur, salt marsh bird's beak, McDonald's rock-cress, and Santa Barbara Island liveforever. As of December 1997[update], 85 plant species were listed as threatened or endangered.[150] In the deserts of the lower Sonoran zone, the mammals include the jackrabbit, kangaroo rat, squirrel, and opossum. Common birds include the owl, roadrunner, cactus wren, and various species of hawk. The area's reptilian life include the sidewinder viper, desert tortoise, and horned toad. The upper Sonoran zone boasts mammals such as the antelope, brown-footed woodrat, and ring-tailed cat. Birds unique to this zone are the California thrasher, bushtit, and California condor.[150][154][155][156] In the transition zone, there are Colombian black-tailed deer, black bears, gray foxes, cougars, bobcats, and Roosevelt elk. Reptiles such as the garter snakes and rattlesnakes inhabit the zone. In addition, amphibians such as the water puppy and redwood salamander are common too. Birds such as the kingfisher, chickadee, towhee, and hummingbird thrive here as well.[150][157] The Canadian zone mammals include the mountain weasel, snowshoe hare, and several species of chipmunks. Conspicuous birds include the blue-fronted jay, mountain chickadee, hermit thrush, American dipper, and Townsend's solitaire. As one ascends into the Hudsonian zone, birds become scarcer. While the gray-crowned rosy finch is the only bird native to the high Arctic region, other bird species such as Anna's hummingbird and Clark's nutcracker. Principal mammals found in this region include the Sierra coney, white-tailed jackrabbit, and the bighorn sheep. As of April 2003[update], the bighorn sheep was listed as endangered by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. The fauna found throughout several zones are the mule deer, coyote, mountain lion, northern flicker, and several species of hawk and sparrow.[150] Aquatic life in California thrives, from the state's mountain lakes and streams to the rocky Pacific coastline. Numerous trout species are found, among them rainbow, golden, and cutthroat. Migratory species of salmon are common as well. Deep-sea life forms include sea bass, yellowfin tuna, barracuda, and several types of whale. Native to the cliffs of northern California are seals, sea lions, and many types of shorebirds, including migratory species.[150] As of April 2003[update], 118 California animals were on the federal endangered list; 181 plants were listed as endangered or threatened. Endangered animals include the San Joaquin kitfox, Point Arena mountain beaver, Pacific pocket mouse, salt marsh harvest mouse, Morro Bay kangaroo rat (and five other species of kangaroo rat), Amargosa vole, California least tern, California condor, loggerhead shrike, San Clemente sage sparrow, San Francisco garter snake, five species of salamander, three species of chub, and two species of pupfish. Eleven butterflies are also endangered[158] and two that are threatened are on the federal list.[159][160] Among threatened animals are the coastal California gnatcatcher, Paiute cutthroat trout, southern sea otter, and northern spotted owl. California has a total of 290,821 acres (1,176.91 km2) of National Wildlife Refuges.[150] As of September 2010[update], 123 California animals were listed as either endangered or threatened on the federal list.[161] Also, as of the same year[update], 178 species of California plants were listed either as endangered or threatened on this federal list.[161] The most prominent river system within California is formed by the Sacramento River and San Joaquin River, which are fed mostly by snowmelt from the west slope of the Sierra Nevada, and respectively drain the north and south halves of the Central Valley. The two rivers join in the SacramentoâSan Joaquin River Delta, flowing into the Pacific Ocean through San Francisco Bay. Many major tributaries feed into the SacramentoâSan Joaquin system, including the Pit River, Feather River and Tuolumne River. The Klamath and Trinity Rivers drain a large area in far northwestern California. The Eel River and Salinas River each drain portions of the California coast, north and south of San Francisco Bay, respectively. The Mojave River is the primary watercourse in the Mojave Desert, and the Santa Ana River drains much of the Transverse Ranges as it bisects Southern California. The Colorado River forms the state's southeast border with Arizona. Most of California's major rivers are dammed as part of two massive water projects: the Central Valley Project, providing water for agriculture in the Central Valley, and the California State Water Project diverting water from Northern to Southern California. The state's coasts, rivers, and other bodies of water are regulated by the California Coastal Commission. California is traditionally separated into Northern California and Southern California, divided by a straight border which runs across the state, separating the northern 48 counties from the southern 10 counties. Despite the persistence of the northern-southern divide, California is more precisely divided into many regions, multiple of which stretch across the northern-southern divide. The state has 483 incorporated cities and towns,[162] of which 461 are cities and 22 are towns. Under California law, the terms \"city\" and \"town\" are explicitly interchangeable; the name of an incorporated municipality in the state can either be \"City of (Name)\" or \"Town of (Name)\".[163] Sacramento became California's first incorporated city on February 27, 1850.[164] San Jose, San Diego, and Benicia tied for California's second incorporated city, each receiving incorporation on March 27, 1850.[165][166][167] Mountain House became the state's most recent and 483rd incorporated municipality on July 1, 2024.[162] The majority of these cities and towns are within one of five metropolitan areas: the Los Angeles Metropolitan Area, the San Francisco Bay Area, the Riverside-San Bernardino Area, the San Diego metropolitan area, or the Sacramento metropolitan area. Presently, close to one out of every nine United States residents live in California.[175][176] The United States Census Bureau reported that the population of California was 39.54 million on April 1, 2020, a 6.13% increase since the 2010 census.[172] During that decade, the state's population grew more slowly than the rest of the nation, resulting in the loss of one seat on the US House of Representatives, the first loss in its entire history.[175] The estimated state population in 2023 was 38.94 million.[176] For well over a century (1900â2020), California experienced steady population growth. Even while the rate of growth began to slow by the 1990s, some growth continued into the first two decades of the 21st century; California added an average of around 400,000 people per year to its population during the period 1940â2020.[177][178][179] Then in 2020, the state began to experience population declines continuing every year, attributable mostly to moves out of state but also due to declining birth rates, COVID-19 pandemic deaths, and less internal migration from other states to California.[175][180] According to the U.S. Census Bureau, between 2021 and 2022, 818,000 California residents moved out of state[181] with emigrants listing high cost of living,[182] high taxes,[183][184] and a difficult business environment as the motivation.[184] The net loss of population in California between July 2020 and July 2023 was 433,000.[175] The Greater Los Angeles Area is the second-largest metropolitan area in the United States (U.S.), while Los Angeles is the second-largest city in the U.S. Los Angeles County has held the title of most populous U.S. county for decades, and it alone is more populous than 42 U.S. states.[185][186] San Francisco is the most densely-populated city in California and one of the most densely populated cities in the U.S.. Four of the top 20 most populous cities in the U.S. are in California: Los Angeles (2nd), San Diego (8th), San Jose (13th), and San Francisco (17th). The center of population of California is located four miles west-southwest of the city of Shafter, Kern County.[note 3] As of 2020, California ranked fourth among states by life expectancy, with a life expectancy of 79.0 years.[188] Starting in the year 2010, for the first time since the California Gold Rush, California-born residents made up the majority of the state's population.[189] Along with the rest of the United States, California's immigration pattern has also shifted over the course of the late 2000s to early 2010s.[190] Immigration from Latin American countries has dropped significantly with most immigrants now coming from Asia.[191] In total for 2011, there were 277,304 immigrants. Fifty-seven percent came from Asian countries versus 22% from Latin American countries.[191] Net immigration from Mexico, previously the most common country of origin for new immigrants, has dropped to zero / less than zero since more Mexican nationals are departing for their home country than immigrating.[190] The state's population of undocumented immigrants has been shrinking in recent years, due to increased enforcement and decreased job opportunities for lower-skilled workers.[192] The number of migrants arrested attempting to cross the Mexican border in the Southwest decreased from a high of 1.1 million in 2005 to 367,000 in 2011.[193] Despite these recent trends, illegal aliens constituted an estimated 7.3 percent of the state's population, the third highest percentage of any state in the country,[194][note 4] totaling nearly 2.6 million.[195] In particular, illegal immigrants tended to be concentrated in Los Angeles, Monterey, San Benito, Imperial, and Napa Countiesâthe latter four of which have significant agricultural industries that depend on manual labor.[196] More than half of illegal immigrants originate from Mexico.[195] The state of California and some California cities, including Los Angeles, Oakland, and San Francisco,[197] have adopted sanctuary policies.[198] According to HUD's 2022 Annual Homeless Assessment Report, there were an estimated 171,521 homeless people in California.[199][200] other Pacific Islander According to the United States Census Bureau in 2022 the population self-identified as (alone or in combination): 56.5% White (including Hispanic Whites),[206] 33.7% non-Hispanic white,[207] 18.1% Asian,[208] 7.3% Black or African American,[209] 3.2% Native American and Alaska Native,[210] 0.9% Native Hawaiian or Pacific Islander,[211] and 34.3% some other race.[212] These numbers add up to more than 100% because respondents can select multiple racial identities. 19% of Californians identified as two or more races in 2022, although excluding respondents who selected \"some other race\", only 5% identified as two or more races.[213] By ethnicity, in 2018 the population was 60.7% non-Hispanic (of any race) and 39.3% Hispanic or Latino (of any race). Hispanics are the largest single ethnic group in California.[214] Non-Hispanic whites constituted 36.8% of the state's population.[214] Californios are the Hispanic residents native to California, who make up the Spanish-speaking community that has existed in California since 1542, of varying Mexican American/Chicano, Criollo Spaniard, and Mestizo origin.[215] However, they make up only a small part of California's Hispanic population today, estimated at 500,000. California has the largest Mexican, Salvadoran, and Guatemalan population, together making up over 90% of the state's Latino population.[216] According to 2022 estimates from the American Community Survey, 32.4% of the population had Mexican ancestry, 6.6% had German ancestry, 6.1% had English ancestry, 5.6% had Irish ancestry, 4.9% had Chinese ancestry, 4.3% had Filipino ancestry, 4% had Central American ancestry (Mostly Salvadoran and Guatemalan), 3.4% had Italian ancestry, 2.8% listed themselves as American, and 2.5% had Indian ancestry.[217][218][219] As of 2011[update], 75.1% of California's population younger than age 1 were minorities, meaning they had at least one parent who was not non-Hispanic white (white Hispanics are counted as minorities).[220] In terms of total numbers, California has the largest population of White Americans in the United States, an estimated 22,200,000 residents including people identifying as white in combination with any other race. The state has the 5th largest population of African Americans in the United States, an estimated 2,250,000 residents. California's Asian American population is estimated at 7.1 million, constituting a third of the nation's total. California's Native American population of 504,000 is the most of any state, with 103,030 identifying as Non-Hispanic and belonging mostly to the Indigenous peoples of California.[221][222] Most of the state's Native American population identifies as Hispanic and belongs to Indigenous Mexican or Central American ethnic groups, including 185,200 identifying as Mexican American Indian and 67,904 identifying as Central American Indian.[223] According to estimates from 2011, California has the largest minority population in the United States by numbers, making up 60% of the state population.[224] Over the past 25 years, the population of non-Hispanic whites has declined, while Hispanic and Asian populations have grown. Between 1970 and 2011, non-Hispanic whites declined from 80% of the state's population to 40%, while Hispanics grew from 32% in 2000 to 38% in 2011.[225] It is currently projected that Hispanics will rise to 49% of the population by 2060, primarily due to domestic births rather than immigration.[226] With the decline of immigration from Latin America, Asian Americans now constitute the fastest growing racial/ethnic group in California; this growth is primarily driven by immigration from China, India, and the Philippines, respectively.[227] Most of California's immigrant population are born in Mexico (3.9 million), the Philippines (825,200), China (768,400), India (556,500), and Vietnam (502,600).[228] California has the largest multiracial population in the United States.[229] Mexican is the most common ancestry in California, followed by English, German, and Irish.[230] English serves as California's de jure and de facto official language. According to the 2021 American Community Survey conducted by the United States Census Bureau, 56.08% (20,763,638) of California residents age 5 and older spoke only English at home, while 43.92% spoke another language at home. 60.35% of people who speak a language other than English at home are able to speak English \"well\" or \"very well\", with this figure varying significantly across the different linguistic groups.[231] Like most U.S. states (32 out of 50), California law enshrines English as its official language, and has done so since the passage of Proposition 63 by California voters in 1986. Various government agencies do, and are often required to, furnish documents in the various languages needed to reach their intended audiences.[232][233][234] Spanish is the most commonly spoken language in California, behind English, spoken by 28.18% (10,434,308) of the population (in 2021).[231] The Spanish language has been spoken in California since 1542 and is deeply intertwined with California's cultural landscape and history.[235][236][237] Spanish was the official administrative language of California through the Spanish and Mexican eras, until 1848. Following the U.S. Conquest of California and the Treaty of Guadalupe-Hidalgo, the U.S. Government guaranteed the rights of Spanish-speaking Californians. The first Constitution of California was written in both languages at the Monterey Constitutional Convention of 1849 and protected the rights of Spanish speakers to use their language in government proceedings and mandating that all government documents be published in both English and Spanish.[238] Despite the initial recognition of Spanish by early American governments in California, the revised 1879 constitution stripped the rights of Spanish speakers and the official status of Spanish.[239] The growth of the English-only movement by the mid-20th century led to the passage of 1986 California Proposition 63, which enshrined English as the only official language in California and ended Spanish language instruction in schools.[240] 2016 California Proposition 58 reversed the prohibition on bilingual education, though there are still many barriers to the proliferation of Spanish bilingual education, including a shortage of teachers and lack of funding.[241][240][242] The government of California has since made efforts to promote Spanish language access and bilingual education,[243][244] as have private educational institutions in California.[245] Many businesses in California promote the usage of Spanish by their employees, to better serve both California's Hispanic population and the larger Spanish-speaking world.[246][247] California has historically been one of the most linguistically diverse areas in the world, with more than 70 indigenous languages derived from 64 root languages in six language families.[248][249] A survey conducted between 2007 and 2009 identified 23 different indigenous languages among California farmworkers.[250] All of California's indigenous languages are endangered, although there are now efforts toward language revitalization.[note 6] California has the highest concentration nationwide of Chinese, Vietnamese and Punjabi speakers. As a result of the state's increasing diversity and migration from other areas across the country and around the globe, linguists began noticing a noteworthy set of emerging characteristics of spoken American English in California since the late 20th century. This variety, known as California English, has a vowel shift and several other phonological processes that are different from varieties of American English used in other regions of the United States.[251] Religious self-identification, per Public Religion Research Institute's 2021 American Values Survey[252] The largest religious denominations by number of adherents as a percentage of California's population in 2014 were the Catholic Church with 28 percent, Evangelical Protestants with 20 percent, and Mainline Protestants with 10 percent. Together, all kinds of Protestants accounted for 32 percent. Those unaffiliated with any religion represented 27 percent of the population. The breakdown of other religions is 1% Muslim, 2% Hindu and 2% Buddhist.[253] This is a change from 2008, when the population identified their religion with the Catholic Church with 31 percent; Evangelical Protestants with 18 percent; and Mainline Protestants with 14 percent. In 2008, those unaffiliated with any religion represented 21 percent of the population. The breakdown of other religions in 2008 was 0.5% Muslim, 1% Hindu and 2% Buddhist.[254] The American Jewish Year Book placed the total Jewish population of California at about 1,194,190 in 2006.[255] According to the Association of Religion Data Archives (ARDA) the largest denominations by adherents in 2010 were the Catholic Church with 10,233,334; The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints with 763,818; and the Southern Baptist Convention with 489,953.[256] California has a large Catholic population due to the large numbers of Mexicans and Central Americans living within its borders. California has twelve dioceses and two archdioceses, the Archdiocese of Los Angeles and the Archdiocese of San Francisco, the former being the largest archdiocese in the United States. A Pew Research Center survey revealed that California is somewhat less religious than the rest of the states: 62 percent of Californians say they are \"absolutely certain\" of their belief in God, while in the nation 71 percent say so. The survey also revealed 48 percent of Californians say religion is \"very important\", compared to 56 percent nationally.[258] The culture of California is a Western culture and has its modern roots in the culture of the United States, but also, historically, many Hispanic Californio and Mexican influences. As a border and coastal state, California culture has been greatly influenced by several large immigrant populations, especially those from Latin America and Asia.[259] California has long been a subject of interest in the public mind and has often been promoted by its boosters as a kind of paradise. In the early 20th century, fueled by the efforts of state, the building projects during the Great Depression and local boosters, many Americans saw the Golden State as an ideal resort destination, sunny and dry all year round with easy access to the ocean and mountains. In the 1960s, popular music groups such as the Beach Boys promoted the image of Californians as laid-back, tanned beach-goers. Hollywood and the rest of the Los Angeles area is a major global center for entertainment, with the U.S. film industry's \"Big Five\" major film studios (Columbia, Disney, Paramount, Universal, and Warner Bros.) as well as many minor film studios being based in or around the area. Many animation studios are also headquartered in the state. The four major American television commercial broadcast networks (ABC, CBS, NBC, and Fox) as well as other networks all have production facilities and offices in the state. All the four major commercial broadcast networks, plus the two major Spanish-language networks (Telemundo and Univision) each have at least three owned-and-operated TV stations in California, including at least one in Los Angeles and at least one in San Francisco.[note 7] One of the oldest radio stations in the United States still in existence, KCBS (AM) in the San Francisco Bay Area, was founded in 1909. Universal Music Group, one of the \"Big Four\" record labels, is based in Santa Monica, while Warner Records is based in Los Angeles. Many independent record labels, such as Mind of a Genius Records, are also headquartered in the state. California is also the birthplace of several international music genres, including the Bakersfield sound, Bay Area thrash metal, alternative rock, g-funk, nu metal, glam metal, thrash metal, psychedelic rock, stoner rock, punk rock, hardcore punk, metalcore, pop punk, surf music, third wave ska, west coast hip hop, west coast jazz, jazz rap, and many other genres. Other genres such as pop rock, indie rock, hard rock, hip hop, pop, rock, rockabilly, country, heavy metal, grunge, new wave and disco were popularized in the state. In addition, many British bands, such as Led Zeppelin, Deep Purple, Black Sabbath, and the Rolling Stones settled in the state after becoming internationally famous. As the home of Silicon Valley, the Bay Area is the headquarters of several prominent internet media, social media, and other technology companies. Three of the \"Big Five\" technology companies (Apple, Meta, and Google) are based in the area as well as other services such as Netflix, Pandora Radio, Twitter, Yahoo!, and YouTube. Other prominent companies that are headquartered here include HP inc. and Intel. Microsoft and Amazon also have offices in the area. California, particularly Southern California,[260] is considered the birthplace of modern car culture.[261] Several fast food, fast casual, and casual dining chains were also founded California, including some that have since expanded internationally like California Pizza Kitchen, Denny's, IHOP, McDonald's, Panda Express, and Taco Bell. California has nineteen major professional sports league franchises, far more than any other state. The San Francisco Bay Area has six major league teams spread in its three major cities: San Francisco, San Jose, and Oakland, while the Greater Los Angeles Area is home to ten major league franchises. San Diego and Sacramento each have one major league team. The NFL Super Bowl has been hosted in California 12 times at five different stadiums: Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum, the Rose Bowl, Stanford Stadium, Levi's Stadium, and San Diego Stadium. A thirteenth, Super Bowl LVI, was held at SoFi Stadium in Inglewood on February 13, 2022.[262] California has long had many respected collegiate sports programs. California is home to the oldest college bowl game, the annual Rose Bowl, among others. The NFL has three teams in the state: the Los Angeles Rams, Los Angeles Chargers, and San Francisco 49ers. MLB has five teams in the state: the San Francisco Giants, Oakland Athletics, Los Angeles Dodgers, Los Angeles Angels, and San Diego Padres.[263] The NBA has four teams in the state: the Golden State Warriors, Los Angeles Clippers, Los Angeles Lakers, and Sacramento Kings. Additionally, the WNBA also has one team in the state: the Los Angeles Sparks. The NHL has three teams in the state: the Anaheim Ducks, Los Angeles Kings, and San Jose Sharks. MLS has three teams in the state: the Los Angeles Galaxy, San Jose Earthquakes, and Los Angeles FC. MLR has one team in the state: the San Diego Legion. California is the only U.S. state to have hosted both the Summer and Winter Olympics. The 1932 and 1984 summer games were held in Los Angeles. Squaw Valley Ski Resort (now Palisades Tahoe) in the Lake Tahoe region hosted the 1960 Winter Olympics. Los Angeles will host the 2028 Summer Olympics, marking the fourth time that California will have hosted the Olympic Games.[264] Multiple games during the 1994 FIFA World Cup took place in California, with the Rose Bowl hosting eight matches (including the final), while Stanford Stadium hosted six matches. In addition to the Olympic games, California also hosts the California State Games. Many sports, such as surfing, snowboarding, and skateboarding, were invented in California, while others like volleyball, beach soccer, and skiing were popularized in the state. Other sports that are big in the state include golf, rodeo, tennis, mountain climbing, marathon running, horse racing, bowling, mixed martial arts, boxing, and motorsports, especially NASCAR and Formula One. California has the most school students in the country, with over 6.2 million in the 2005â06 school year, giving California more students in school than 36 states have in total population and one of the highest projected enrollments in the country.[265] Public secondary education consists of high schools that teach elective courses in trades, languages, and liberal arts with tracks for gifted, college-bound and industrial arts students. California's public educational system is supported by a unique constitutional amendment that requires a minimum annual funding level for grades Kâ12 and community colleges that grows with the economy and student enrollment figures.[266] In 2016, California's Kâ12 public school per-pupil spending was ranked 22nd in the nation ($11,500 per student vs. $11,800 for the U.S. average).[267] For 2012, California's Kâ12 public schools ranked 48th in the number of employees per student, at 0.102 (the U.S. average was 0.137), while paying the 7th most per employee, $49,000 (the U.S. average was $39,000).[268][269][270] California public postsecondary education is organized into three separate systems: California is also home to notable private universities such as Stanford University, the California Institute of Technology (Caltech), the University of Southern California, the Claremont Colleges, Santa Clara University, Loyola Marymount University, the University of San Diego, the University of San Francisco, Chapman University, Pepperdine University, Occidental College, and University of the Pacific, among numerous other private colleges and universities, including many religious and special-purpose institutions. California has a particularly high density of arts colleges, including the California College of the Arts, California Institute of the Arts, San Francisco Art Institute, Art Center College of Design, and Academy of Art University, among others. California's economy ranks among the largest in the world. As of 2024[update], the gross state product (GSP) is $4.0 trillion ($102,500 per capita), the largest in the United States.[279] California is responsible for one seventh of the nation's gross domestic product (GDP).[280] As of 2018[update], California's nominal GDP is larger than all but four countries.[281] In terms of purchasing power parity (PPP),[282] it is larger than all but eight countries.[283] California's economy is larger than Africa and Australia and is almost as large as South America.[284] The state recorded total, non-farm employment of 16,677,800[285] as of September 2021[update] among 966,224 employer establishments.[286] As the largest and second-largest U.S. ports respectively, the Port of Los Angeles and the Port of Long Beach in Southern California collectively play a pivotal role in the global supply chain, together hauling in about 40% of all imports to the United States by TEU volume.[22] The Port of Oakland and Port of Hueneme are the 10th and 26th largest seaports in the U.S., respectively, by number of TEUs handled.[287] The five largest sectors of employment in California are trade, transportation, and utilities; government; professional and business services; education and health services; and leisure and hospitality. In output, the five largest sectors are financial services, followed by trade, transportation, and utilities; education and health services; government; and manufacturing.[288] California has an unemployment rate of 3.9% as of September 2022[update].[285] California's economy is dependent on trade and international related commerce accounts for about one-quarter of the state's economy, and representing 7% of their GDP; California's biggest trade partner is Mexico. In 2008, California exported $144 billion worth of goods, up from $134 billion in 2007 and $127 billion in 2006.[289] Vehicles, computers and electronic products are California's top exports, accounting for 42 percent of all the state's exports in 2008; over 50 car companies operate in California, such as Tesla and Mazda.[289] Agriculture is an important sector in California's economy. According to the USDA in 2011, the three largest California agricultural products by value were milk and cream, shelled almonds, and grapes.[21] Farming-related sales more than quadrupled over the past three decades, from $7.3 billion in 1974 to nearly $31 billion in 2004.[290] This increase has occurred despite a 15 percent decline in acreage devoted to farming during the period, and water supply suffering from chronic instability. Factors contributing to the growth in sales-per-acre include more intensive use of active farmlands and technological improvements in crop production.[290] In 2008, California's 81,500 farms and ranches generated $36.2 billion products revenue.[291] In 2011, that number grew to $43.5 billion products revenue.[292] The agriculture sector accounts for two percent of the state's GDP and employs around three percent of its total workforce.[293] Per capita GDP in 2021 was $85,546, ranking fourth in the nation. Per capita income varies widely by geographic region and profession.[296] The Central Valley is the most impoverished, with migrant farm workers making less than minimum wage. According to a 2005 report by the Congressional Research Service, the San Joaquin Valley was characterized as one of the most economically depressed regions in the United States, on par with the region of Appalachia.[297] Using the supplemental poverty measure, California has a poverty rate of 23.5%, the highest of any state in the country.[298] However, using the official measure the poverty rate was only 13.3% as of 2017.[299] Many coastal cities include some of the wealthiest per-capita areas in the United States. The high-technology sectors in Northern California, specifically Silicon Valley, in Santa Clara and San Mateo counties, have emerged from the economic downturn caused by the dot-com bust. In 2019, there were 1,042,027 millionaire households in the state, more than any other state in the nation.[300] In 2010, California residents were ranked first among the states with the best average credit score of 754.[301] State spending increased from $56 billion in 1998 to $127 billion in 2011.[304][305] California has the third highest per capita spending on welfare among the states, as well as the highest spending on welfare at $6.67 billion.[306] In January 2011, California's total debt was at least $265 billion.[307] On June 27, 2013, Governor Jerry Brown signed a balanced budget (no deficit) for the state, its first in decades; however, the state's debt remains at $132 billion.[308][309] With the passage of Proposition 30 in 2012 and Proposition 55 in 2016, California now levies a 13.3% maximum marginal income tax rate with ten tax brackets, ranging from 1% at the bottom tax bracket of $0 annual individual income to 13.3% for annual individual income over $1,000,000 (though the top brackets are only temporary until Proposition 55 expires at the end of 2030). While Proposition 30 also enacted a minimum state sales tax of 7.5%, this sales tax increase was not extended by Proposition 55 and reverted to a previous minimum state sales tax rate of 7.25% in 2017. Local governments can and do levy additional sales taxes in addition to this minimum rate.[310] All real property is taxable annually. Property tax increases are capped at 2% annually or the rate of inflation (whichever is lower), per Proposition 13. Because it is the most populous state in the United States, California is one of the country's largest users of energy. The state has extensive hydro-electric energy generation facilities, however, moving water is the single largest energy use in the state. Also, due to high energy rates, conservation mandates, mild weather in the largest population centers and strong environmental movement, its per capita energy use is one of the smallest of any state in the United States.[311] Due to the high electricity demand, California imports more electricity than any other state, primarily hydroelectric power from states in the Pacific Northwest (via Path 15 and Path 66) and coal- and natural gas-fired production from the desert Southwest via Path 46.[312] The state's crude oil and natural gas deposits are located in the Central Valley and along the coast, including the large Midway-Sunset Oil Field. Natural gas-fired power plants typically account for more than one-half of state electricity generation. As a result of the state's strong environmental movement, California has some of the most aggressive renewable energy goals in the United States. The Clean Energy, Jobs and Affordability Act of 2022 commits the state to running its operations on clean, renewable energy resources by 2035, and SB 1203 also requires the state to achieve net-zero operations for all agencies. Currently, several solar power plants such as the Solar Energy Generating Systems facility are located in the Mojave Desert. California's wind farms include Altamont Pass, San Gorgonio Pass, and Tehachapi Pass. The Tehachapi area is also where the Tehachapi Energy Storage Project is located.[313] Several dams across the state provide hydro-electric power. It would be possible to convert the total supply to 100% renewable energy, including heating, cooling and mobility, by 2050.[314] California has one major nuclear power plant (Diablo Canyon) in operation. The San Onofre nuclear plant was shut down in 2013. More than 1,700 tons of radioactive waste are stored at San Onofre,[315] and sit on the coast where there is a record of past tsunamis.[316] Voters banned the approval of new nuclear power plants since the late 1970s because of concerns over radioactive waste disposal.[317][note 8] Several cities such as Oakland, Berkeley and Davis have declared themselves as nuclear-free zones. California's vast terrain is connected by an extensive system of controlled-access highways ('freeways'), limited-access roads ('expressways'), and highways. California is known for its car culture, giving California's cities a reputation for severe traffic congestion. Construction and maintenance of state roads and statewide transportation planning are primarily the responsibility of the California Department of Transportation, nicknamed \"Caltrans\". The rapidly growing population of the state is straining all of its transportation networks, and California has some of the worst roads in the United States.[319][320] The Reason Foundation's 19th Annual Report on the Performance of State Highway Systems ranked California's highways the third-worst of any state, with Alaska second, and Rhode Island first.[321] The state has been a pioneer in road construction. One of the state's more visible landmarks, the Golden Gate Bridge, was the longest suspension bridge main span in the world at 4,200 feet (1,300 m) between 1937 (when it opened) and 1964. With its orange paint and panoramic views of the bay, this highway bridge is a popular tourist attraction and also accommodates pedestrians and bicyclists. The San FranciscoâOakland Bay Bridge (often abbreviated the \"Bay Bridge\"), completed in 1936, transports about 280,000 vehicles per day on two-decks. Its two sections meet at Yerba Buena Island through the world's largest diameter transportation bore tunnel, at 76 feet (23 m) wide by 58 feet (18 m) high.[322] The Arroyo Seco Parkway, connecting Los Angeles and Pasadena, opened in 1940 as the first freeway in the Western United States.[323] It was later extended south to the Four Level Interchange in downtown Los Angeles, regarded as the first stack interchange ever built.[324] The California Highway Patrol is the largest statewide police agency in the United States in employment with more than 10,000 employees. They are responsible for providing any police-sanctioned service to anyone on California's state-maintained highways and on state property. By the end of 2021, 30,610,058 people in California held a California Department of Motor Vehicles-issued driver's licenses or state identification card, and there were 36,229,205 registered vehicles, including 25,643,076 automobiles, 853,368 motorcycles, 8,981,787 trucks and trailers, and 121,716 miscellaneous vehicles (including historical vehicles and farm equipment).[325] Los Angeles International Airport (LAX), the 4th busiest airport in the world in 2018, and San Francisco International Airport (SFO), the 25th busiest airport in the world in 2018, are major hubs for trans-Pacific and transcontinental traffic. There are about a dozen important commercial airports and many more general aviation airports throughout the state. Inter-city rail travel is provided by Amtrak California; the three routes, the Capitol Corridor, Pacific Surfliner, and San Joaquin, are funded by Caltrans. These services are the busiest intercity rail lines in the United States outside the Northeast Corridor and ridership is continuing to set records. The routes are becoming increasingly popular over flying, especially on the LAX-SFO route.[326] Integrated subway and light rail networks are found in Los Angeles (Los Angeles Metro Rail) and San Francisco (Muni Metro). Light rail systems are also found in San Jose (VTA light rail), San Diego (San Diego Trolley), Sacramento (SacRT light rail), and Northern San Diego County (Sprinter). Furthermore, commuter rail networks serve the San Francisco Bay Area (Altamont Corridor Express, Bay Area Rapid Transit, Caltrain, SonomaâMarin Area Rail Transit), Greater Los Angeles (Metrolink), and San Diego County (Coaster). The California High-Speed Rail Authority was authorized in 1996 by the state legislature to plan a California High-Speed Rail system to put before the voters. The plan they devised, 2008 California Proposition 1A, connecting all the major population centers in the state, was approved by the voters at the November 2008 general election.[327] The first phase of construction was begun in 2015, and the first segment 171 miles (275 km) long, is planned to be put into operation by the end of 2030. Planning and work on the rest of the system is continuing, with funding for completing it is an ongoing issue.[328] California's 2023 integrated passenger rail master plan includes a high speed rail system.[329] Nearly all counties operate bus lines, and many cities operate their own city bus lines as well. Intercity bus travel is provided by Greyhound, Megabus, and Amtrak Thruway. California's interconnected water system is the world's largest, managing over 40,000,000 acre-feet (49 km3) of water per year, centered on six main systems of aqueducts and infrastructure projects.[330] Water use and conservation in California is a politically divisive issue, as the state experiences periodic droughts and has to balance the demands of its large agricultural and urban sectors, especially in the arid southern portion of the state. The state's widespread redistribution of water also invites the frequent scorn of environmentalists. The California Water Wars, a conflict between Los Angeles and the Owens Valley over water rights, is one of the most well-known examples of the struggle to secure adequate water supplies.[331] Former California Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger said: We've been in crisis for quite some time because we're now 38 million people and not anymore 18 million people like we were in the late 60s. So it developed into a battle between environmentalists and farmers and between the south and the north and between rural and urban. And everyone has been fighting for the last four decades about water.[332] The capital city of California is Sacramento.[333] The state is organized into three branches of governmentâthe executive branch consisting of the governor[334] and the other independently elected constitutional officers; the legislative branch consisting of the Assembly and Senate;[335] and the judicial branch consisting of the Supreme Court of California and lower courts.[336] The state also allows ballot propositions: direct participation of the electorate by initiative, referendum, recall, and ratification.[337] Before the passage of Proposition 14 in 2010, California allowed each political party to choose whether to have a closed primary or a primary where only party members and independents vote. After June 8, 2010, when Proposition 14 was approved, excepting only the United States president and county central committee offices,[338] all candidates in the primary elections are listed on the ballot with their preferred party affiliation, but they are not the official nominee of that party.[339] At the primary election, the two candidates with the top votes will advance to the general election regardless of party affiliation.[339] This is known as a nonpartisan blanket primary. If at a special primary election, one candidate receives more than 50% of all the votes cast, they are elected to fill the vacancy and no special general election will be held.[339] The California executive branch consists of the governor and seven other elected constitutional officers: lieutenant governor, attorney general, secretary of state, state controller, state treasurer, insurance commissioner, and state superintendent of public instruction. They serve four-year terms and may be re-elected only once.[340] The many California state agencies that are under the governor's cabinet are grouped together to form cabinet-level entities that are referred to by government officials as \"superagencies\". Those departments that are directly under the other independently elected officers work separately from these superagencies.[341][342] The California State Legislature consists of a 40-member Senate and 80-member Assembly.[343] Senators serve four-year terms and Assembly members two. Members of the Assembly are subject to term limits of six terms, and members of the Senate are subject to term limits of three terms. California's legal system is explicitly based upon English common law[344] but carries many features from Spanish civil law, such as community property. California's prison population grew from 25,000 in 1980 to over 170,000 in 2007.[345] Capital punishment is a legal form of punishment and the state has the largest \"Death Row\" population in the country (though Oklahoma and Texas are far more active in carrying out executions).[346][347] California has performed 13 executions since 1976, with the last being in 2006.[348] California's judiciary system is the largest in the United States with a total of 1,600 judges (the federal system has only about 840). At the apex is the seven-member Supreme Court of California, while the California Courts of Appeal serve as the primary appellate courts and the California Superior Courts serve as the primary trial courts. Justices of the Supreme Court and Courts of Appeal are appointed by the governor, but are subject to retention by the electorate every 12 years. The administration of the state's court system is controlled by the Judicial Council, composed of the chief justice of the California Supreme Court, 14 judicial officers, four representatives from the State Bar of California, and one member from each house of the state legislature. In fiscal year 2020â2021, the state judiciary's 2,000 judicial officers and 18,000 judicial branch employees processed approximately 4.4 million cases.[349] California has an extensive system of local government that manages public functions throughout the state. Like most states, California is divided into counties, of which there are 58 (including San Francisco) covering the entire state. Most urbanized areas are incorporated as cities. School districts, which are independent of cities and counties, handle public education. Many other functions, such as fire protection and water supply, especially in unincorporated areas, are handled by special districts. California is divided into 58 counties. Per Article 11, Section 1, of the Constitution of California, they are the legal subdivisions of the state. The county government provides countywide services such as law enforcement, jails, elections and voter registration, vital records, property assessment and records, tax collection, public health, health care, social services, libraries, flood control, fire protection, animal control, agricultural regulations, building inspections, ambulance services, and education departments in charge of maintaining statewide standards.[350][351] In addition, the county serves as the local government for all unincorporated areas. Each county is governed by an elected board of supervisors.[352] Incorporated cities and towns in California are either charter or general-law municipalities.[163] General-law municipalities owe their existence to state law and are consequently governed by it; charter municipalities are governed by their own city or town charters. Municipalities incorporated in the 19th century tend to be charter municipalities. All ten of the state's most populous cities are charter cities. Most small cities have a councilâmanager form of government, where the elected city council appoints a city manager to supervise the operations of the city. Some larger cities have a directly elected mayor who oversees the city government. In many council-manager cities, the city council selects one of its members as a mayor, sometimes rotating through the council membershipâbut this type of mayoral position is primarily ceremonial. The Government of San Francisco is the only consolidated city-county in California, where both the city and county governments have been merged into one unified jurisdiction. About 1,102 school districts, independent of cities and counties, handle California's public education.[353] California school districts may be organized as elementary districts, high school districts, unified school districts combining elementary and high school grades, or community college districts.[353] There are about 3,400 special districts in California.[354] A special district, defined by California Government Code Â§ 16271(d) as \"any agency of the state for the local performance of governmental or proprietary functions within limited boundaries\", provides a limited range of services within a defined geographic area. The geographic area of a special district can spread across multiple cities or counties, or could consist of only a portion of one. Most of California's special districts are single-purpose districts, and provide one service. The state of California sends 52 members to the House of Representatives,[355] the nation's largest congressional state delegation. Consequently, California also has the largest number of electoral votes in national presidential elections, with 54. The former speaker of the House of Representatives is the representative of California's 20th district, Kevin McCarthy.[356] California is represented in the United States Senate by Alex Padilla and Adam Schiff. In California, as of 2009[update], the U.S. Department of Defense had a total of 117,806 active duty servicemembers of which 88,370 were Sailors or Marines, 18,339 were Airmen, and 11,097 were Soldiers, with 61,365 Department of Defense civilian employees. Additionally, there were a total of 57,792 Reservists and Guardsman in California.[357] In 2010, Los Angeles County was the largest origin of military recruits in the United States by county, with 1,437 individuals enlisting in the military.[358] However, as of 2002[update], Californians were relatively under-represented in the military as a proportion to its population.[359] In 2000, California, had 2,569,340 veterans of United States military service.[360] As of 2010[update], there were 1,942,775 veterans living in California, of which 1,457,875 served during a period of armed conflict, and just over four thousand served before World War II (the largest population of this group of any state).[361] California's military forces consist of the Army and Air National Guard, the naval and state military reserve (militia), and the California Cadet Corps. Party registration by county(October 2022): California has an idiosyncratic political culture compared to the rest of the country, and is sometimes regarded as a trendsetter.[363] In socio-cultural mores and national politics, Californians are perceived as more liberal than other Americans, especially those who live in the inland states. In the 2016 United States presidential election, California had the third highest percentage of Democratic votes behind the District of Columbia and Hawaii.[364] In the 2020 United States presidential election, it had the 6th highest behind the District of Columbia, Vermont, Massachusetts, Maryland, and Hawaii. According to the Cook Political Report, California contains five of the 15 most Democratic congressional districts in the United States. California was the second state to recall their state governor, the second state to legalize abortion, and the only state to ban marriage for gay couples twice by vote (including Proposition 8 in 2008). Voters also passed Proposition 71 in 2004 to fund stem cell research, making California the second state to legalize stem cell research, and Proposition 14 in 2010 to completely change the state's primary election process. California has also experienced disputes over water rights; and a tax revolt, culminating with the passage of Proposition 13 in 1978, limiting state property taxes. California voters have rejected affirmative action on multiple occasions, most recently in November 2020. The state's trend towards the Democratic Party and away from the Republican Party can be seen in state elections. From 1899 to 1939, California had exclusively Republican governors. Since 1990, California has generally elected Democratic candidates to federal, state and local offices, including current Governor Gavin Newsom; however, the state has elected Republican Governors, though many of its Republican Governors, such as Arnold Schwarzenegger, tend to be considered moderate Republicans and more centrist than the national party. Several political movements have advocated for California independence. The California National Party and the California Freedom Coalition both advocate for California independence along the lines of progressivism and civic nationalism.[365] The Yes California movement attempted to organize an independence referendum via ballot initiative for 2019, which was then postponed.[366] The Democrats also hold a supermajority in both houses of the state legislature. There are 62 Democrats and 18 Republicans in the Assembly; and 32 Democrats and eight Republicans in the Senate. From 1952 through 1988, California was a Republican-leaning state, as the party carried the state's electoral votes in nine of ten elections, with 1964 as the sole exception. Southern California Republicans Richard Nixon and Ronald Reagan were both elected twice as the 37th and 40th U.S. Presidents, respectively. However, Democrats have won all of California's electoral votes for the last eight elections, starting in 1992. In the United States House, the Democrats held a 34â19 edge in the California delegation of the 110th United States Congress in 2007. As the result of gerrymandering, the districts in California were usually dominated by one or the other party, and few districts were considered competitive. In 2008, Californians passed Proposition 20 to empower a 14-member independent citizen commission to redraw districts for both local politicians and Congress. After the 2012 elections, when the new system took effect, Democrats gained four seats and held a 38â15 majority in the delegation. Following the 2018 midterm House elections, Democrats won 46 out of 53 congressional house seats in California, leaving Republicans with seven. In general, Democratic strength is centered in the populous coastal regions of the Los Angeles metropolitan area and the San Francisco Bay Area. Republican strength is still greatest in eastern parts of the state. Orange County had remained largely Republican until the 2016 and 2018 elections, in which a majority of the county's votes were cast for Democratic candidates.[367][368] One study ranked Berkeley, Oakland, Inglewood and San Francisco in the top 20 most liberal American cities; and Bakersfield, Orange, Escondido, Garden Grove, and Simi Valley in the top 20 most conservative cities.[369] In October 2022, out of the 26,876,800 people eligible to vote, 21,940,274 people were registered to vote.[370] Of the people registered, the three largest registered groups were Democrats (10,283,258), Republicans (5,232,094), and No Party Preference (4,943,696).[370] California retains the death penalty, though it has not been used since 2006.[371] California has region twinning arrangements with: 37Â°N 120Â°Wï»¿ / ï»¿37Â°N 120Â°Wï»¿ / 37; -120ï»¿ (State of California)",

                "content": "California, officially the State of California, is a state in the western part of the United States, along the Pacific Ocean. It is the third biggest US state by area (after Alaska and Texas) with 163,696 square mi (423,970 km2). It has more people than any other state with over 39 million people as of 2020. It also has more people than Canada. Its largest cities are Los Angeles, San Diego, San Jose, and San Francisco. The capital is Sacramento. The states around its borders are Arizona to the southeast, Oregon to the north, Nevada to the east, and the Mexican state of Baja California to the south. California, which has a North/South orientation, has a wide range of climates. The geography of California varies depending on the region. Southwestern California has small mountain ranges and the cities of San Diego and Los Angeles. Southeastern California has the Mojave Desert and Death Valley, the lowest place in the United States. The eastern part of the state has the highest point in the United States outside of Alaska: Mount Whitney, in the Sierra Nevada mountain range.[9] The cities of Sacramento, Bakersfield, and Fresno are in the Central Valley. The valley has the Sierra Nevada to the east and the Pacific Coast Ranges to the west. It is California's single most productive agricultural region and one of the most productive in the world. It produces more than half the fruit, vegetables, and nuts grown in the United States.[10] More than seven million acres (28,000 km2) of the valley are irrigated by an extensive system of reservoirs and canals.[11] The west-central part of the state has some small mountains and the cities of San Francisco, San Jose, and Oakland. Northern California has the Cascade Range, the Klamath Mountains, and the Modoc Plateau.[12] Far northern California does not have many people, but the San Francisco region and the Sacramento region are often thought of as part of northern California. California is home to many animals such as racoons, the California condor, and the mountain lion. Californiaâs official flower is the California poppy. California was once home to the Grizzly bear and the jaguar. California poppy is the official flower of California. The state is a leader in three businesses: farming, movie-making, and high technology, mostly software and websites. Aerospace used to be a large industry there, but it has been downsized in the last 20 years. California is very diverse. Today it has high numbers of Hispanic and Latino Americans, Asian Americans, and Armenian Americans. There are many earthquakes in California. They happen when two tectonic plates (parts of the Earth's crust) shift underground. Californians need to be prepared for earthquakes and often store extra food, water, flashlights, and first aid supplies in case of such an emergency. California has more people than any other state in the United States. If California was a separate country, it would have the sixth largest economy in the world. California is probably the state with the most ethnic groups. It also has many different geographic features â mountains, deserts, and coasts. It is often called The Golden State. The state flower is the golden poppy. The post office uses \"CA\" as a shorthand for California, and the Associated Press uses \"Calif.\" or \"Cali.\" California has a large population of Mexican Americans. Mexican Americans have influenced Californian cuisine and Californian culture. California also has a large Filipino, Vietnamese, Korean, Japanese, Indian, and Chinese population. There aren't as many white people in the state but there are still many Russian, Spaniard, German, English, Scottish, Portuguese, Italian, Dutch, Irish, and French people in the state. Other ethnic groups in California are Serbians, Persians, Bulgarians, Navajos, Cherokees, Nicaraguans, Alaskans, and Romani people. California is popular among celebrities. Celebrities such as Kim Kardashian, Dwayne Johnson, Kylie Jenner, and Jennifer Aniston are from California. California English is a dialect of the English language spoken within California. California is the home to a highly diverse populace, and this is reflected in many other languages, especially Spanish. As is the case of English is spoken in any state, not all features of California English is used by all speakers in the state, and not all features are restricted in use only to the state. However, there are some linguistic features which can be identified as either originally or predominantly Californian. California is famous for In-N-Out Burger, which is the regional chain of fast food restaurants and founded in 1948 by Harry and Esther Snyder.[13] Protestantism and Catholicism are the most practiced religions in California. A smaller population are Jews, Muslims, Hindus, and Buddhists. Marijuana became legal in 2016. Californian cuisine is influenced by Spanish cuisine, Mexican cuisine, and Asian cuisine. Mexican food is very popular in California. California is popular for its tourism. Hollywood and Disneyland are popular tourist destinations in California. Most tourists in Los Angeles come from Mexico, China, Canada, Australia, the United Kingdom, Japan, Vietnam, South Korea, France, Germany, Scandinavia, Middle East, and most recently, India, Spain, Italy, and Southeast Asia. In 2019, Gavin Newsom became the governor of California. Before him, the governor was Jerry Brown. On November 4, 1992, Dianne Feinstein became one of California's United States senators. On January 3, 2017, Kamala Harris became the other one. In the 2020 presidential election, Kamala Harris was elected as the first woman and person of color to be Vice President of the United States. In January 2021, Alex Padilla became the next U.S. Senator, replacing Harris, and became the first Hispanic U.S. Senator from the state. California was more conservative during the 1960s and 1980s when its former governor, Ronald Reagan, ran for president as a Republican. Today, California is more liberal and less conservative. The people in Coastal California were Native Americans. The original Californians were a diverse population, separated by language into as many as 135 distinct dialects. Tribes included the Karok, Maidu, Cahuilleno, Mojave, Yokuts, Pomo, Paiute, and Modoc. In the past, the area that was called \"California\" was not just today's California. This area covered the Mexican lands south of it, as well as Nevada, Utah, and parts of Arizona and Wyoming. The Spanish called the part of the land that later became part of the United States Alta California (Upper California) when it was split from what became Baja California (Lower California). In these early times, the borders of the Sea of Cortez and the Pacific coast were not well known, so the old maps wrongly showed California to be an island. The name comes from Las sergas de EspladiÃ¡n (Adventures of Spladian), a 16th-century book by Garci RodrÃ­guez de Montalvo, where there is an island paradise called California. The first European who visited parts of the coast, Juan Rodriguez Cabrillo, came from Portugal in 1542. The first European who saw the entire coast was Sir Francis Drake, in 1579, and he decided that the British owned it. But starting in the late 1700s, Spanish religious leaders of the Roman Catholic Church (\"missionaries\") got large gifts of land in the area north of Baja California, from the Spanish king and queen. These religious people set up small towns and villages, the famous California Missions. When Mexico was no longer controlled by Spain, the Mexican government took over the villages, and they soon became empty. In 1846, as the Mexican-American War was starting, some Americans in California hoped to create a California Republic. These men flew a \"Bear flag\" that had a golden bear with a star on it. This Republic ended suddenly, however, when Commodore John D. Sloat of the United States Navy sailed into San Francisco Bay. He said that California was now part of the United States. After the war with Mexico ended, California was split between the two countries. The Mexican portion became the Mexican states of Baja California Norte (north) and Baja California Sur (south). (\"Baja\" means \"lower\" in Spanish.) The western part of the part given to the United States became today's state of California. In 1848, there were about 4,000 Spanish-speaking people in today's California on the American side. (Today the state has a total of nearly 40,000,000 people.) In 1849, gold was suddenly found and the number of people went up very fast as the Gold Rush took hold. Slavery also spread there as people hoping to find gold brought African slaves and either forced them to work in gold mines or hired them out for other work.[14] In 1850, California became a state in the Union (the United States). During the American Civil War (1861-1865), many people in California, especially in the southern part of California, thought the South was right and slavery should be protected. Some people in Southern California even wanted Southern California to leave the rest of the state and join the Confederate States of America. However, this did not happen. California joined the war to and helped the North (the Union) and sent many troops east to fight the Confederacy.[15] At first, travel between the far west and the east coast of the United States was dangerous and took a lot of time. Going by land was very difficult, because there were no roads and no trains, and many Native Americans were attacking American people heading West in wagons. The only other way was to travel by boat around the Cape Horn, at the southern end of South America. This took months, since the trip was thousands of miles long and the Panama Canal had not yet been built either. But in 1869, the connection got better quickly, because the first railroad across the continent was finished. Meanwhile, more people in California were learning that the land there was very good to grow fruit and other crops. Oranges were grown in many parts of California. This was the beginning of the huge farming business that California has today. The economy of the State of California is the largest in the United States. It has a gross state product (GSP) of US$3.0 trillion as of 2020.[16] It has many sectors. The most dominant are finance, business services, government and manufacturing. If California were a sovereign nation, according to 2019 statistics, it would rank as the world's fifth largest economy, lying between Germany and India.[17][18] Over 10% of the Fortune 1000 companies were based in California in 2018.[19] In 1900, there were only a million people in California and 105,000 in Los Angeles. Today, California has more people than any other U.S. state. Starting in 1965, the variety of people became much greater as many different people from around the world came to the United States and often decided to live in California. Technology is very advanced and many new cultural trends begin there. Engineering and computers play a big part in the state's life. For over a hundred years, film has been one of the most important businesses in California. By the 1950s, television had also become an important business in California. Many Latinos especially Mexicans and Salvadorans live in the state. In the twenty-first century, droughts and frequent wildfires attributed to climate change have occurred in the state.[20][21] From 2011 to 2017, a persistent drought was the worst in its recorded history.[22] The 2018 wildfire season was the state's deadliest and most destructive, most notably Camp Fire.[23] California has a growing Hispanic and Asian population. White people are the second largest ethnic group in California. Hispanics surpassed the white population in the 2010s. Although air pollution problems have been reduced, health problems associated with pollution have continued. The brown haze that is known as \"smog\" has been substantially abated thanks to federal and state restrictions on automobile exhaust.[24][25] In 2021, the number of Hispanic and Latino residents in California had surpassed the number of white residents, with about 15.75 million Hispanics compared to 13.4 million white residents.",

                "title": "Jerry Springer - Wikipedia",
                "content": "Gerald Norman Springer (February 13, 1944 â April 27, 2023) was an American broadcaster, journalist, actor, lawyer, and politician.[1] He was best known for hosting the controversial tabloid talk show Jerry Springer from 1991 to 2018. Springer was noted as a pioneer in the emergence of \"trash TV\"; his eponymous show was a \"commercial smash and certifiable cultural phenomenon\" in the 1990s.[2] Born in London during World War II to Jewish refugees escaping the Holocaust, Springer was raised in Queens, New York City. He attended Northwestern University School of Law, qualified as a lawyer, and first became actively involved in politics working for the campaign of Robert Kennedy in 1968. A Cincinnati City Council member, Springer served as the 56th Mayor of Cincinnati from 1977 to 1978. He then worked as a local news anchor in Cincinnati where he won ten Regional Emmy Awards for commentary. From 2005 to 2006, Springer hosted Springer on the Radio, a liberal talk show on Cincinnati's WCKY-AM. He was the host of the television talent show America's Got Talent from 2007 to 2008, and of the television courtroom show Judge Jerry from 2019 to 2022. He also hosted The Jerry Springer Podcast from 2015 to 2022. One year after he retired from his television career, Springer died of pancreatic cancer on April 27, 2023 at the age of 79.[3][4] Gerald Norman Springer was born on February 13, 1944,[5] in the London Underground's Highgate station while the station was in use as a shelter from German bombing during World War II.[6][7] Springer spent his first years living on Chandos Road, East Finchley.[8] His parents, Margot (nÃ©e Kallmann; a bank clerk) and Richard Springer (owner of a shoe shop), were Jewish refugees who escaped from Landsberg an der Warthe, Prussia (now GorzÃ³w Wielkopolski, Poland).[9][10] His maternal grandmother, Marie Kallmann, was killed in the gas vans of CheÅmno extermination camp in German-occupied Poland.[8] His paternal grandmother, Selma Springer (nÃ©e Elkeles), died at the hospital in the Theresienstadt concentration camp in German-occupied Czechoslovakia.[8] Selma Springer's brother, Hermann Elkeles, was a renowned Berlin doctor who also died at Theresienstadt concentration camp.[11] In January 1949, when Springer was five,[12] his family immigrated to the United States, settling in the Kew Gardens neighborhood of Queens, a borough of New York City. He attended nearby Forest Hills High School. One of his earliest memories about current events was when he was 12 and watching the 1956 Democratic National Convention on television where he saw and was impressed by then-Senator John F. Kennedy.[13][14] Springer earned a Bachelor of Arts from Tulane University in 1965, majoring in political science.[15] He earned a Juris Doctor from Northwestern University Pritzker School of Law in 1968.[10][16] Springer worked as a political campaign adviser to Democrat Robert F. Kennedy in 1968.[16] Following Kennedy's assassination, he began practicing law at the Cincinnati law firm of Frost & Jacobs, now Frost Brown Todd.[17][18] Springer was a partner in the law firm of Grinker, Sudman & Springer from 1973 to 1985,[19] alongside former NBA agent Ronnie Grinker (d. 1997) and current Butler County, Ohio, magistrate Harry Sudman.[20] In 1970, Springer ran for the United States House of Representatives. He failed to unseat incumbent Republican Donald D. Clancy, but took 45% of the vote in a traditionally Republican district. He had previously spearheaded the effort to lower the voting age, including testifying before the Senate Judiciary Committee in support of ratification of the 26th Amendment. Three days after announcing his candidacy, Springer, who was also an Army reservist at the time, was called to active duty and stationed at Fort Knox. He resumed his campaign after he was discharged.[21] Springer was elected to the Cincinnati City Council in 1971.[16] On April 29, 1974, Springer resigned from the council after admitting to soliciting a prostitute.[16][22] He ran for the office in 1975, winning by a landslide.[23][24] He was reelected in 1977 and 1979.[25] Springer was considered a \"gonzo\" type politician with stunts such as staying a night in jail and commandeering a bus after the city took over bus service.[26] In 1977, Springer was chosen by the Cincinnati City Council to serve for one year as mayor.[16] In 1981, Springer stepped down from his seat on the City Council to focus on running for governor of Ohio,[27] seeking the Democratic nomination in the 1982 Ohio gubernatorial election. Television commercials for Springer's campaign referenced his use of a check to pay a prostitute, saying that he was not afraid of the truth \"even if it hurts.\"[28][29] He failed to win the Democratic party's nominationâfinishing a distant third behind former lieutenant governor Richard F. Celeste and Ohio Attorney General William J. Brownâand his political career was put on hold.[30] In the late 1980s, he played a major role in saving the historic Cincinnati Union Terminal.[30] Springer considered running for the United States Senate in 2000[31] and 2004,[32] but he backed down due to negative associations with the Jerry Springer talk show.[33] He also considered running in the 2018 Ohio gubernatorial election, but decided against it due to his age.[34] Even after his departure from politics, he was the largest contributor to the Hamilton County Democratic Party from 1993 to 2018.[26] In 2016, Springer voiced support for Hillary Clinton in the 2016 United States presidential election.[35] Springer was hired as a political reporter and commentator on Cincinnati's NBC affiliate, WLWT, which had, at the time, the lowest-rated news program. Later, having been named primary news anchor and managing editor, he needed a broadcast catchphrase in the model of other great newsmen. With the help of some others at WLWT, he created his signature line: \"Take care of yourself, and each other.\" Within two years he was Cincinnati's number-one news anchor, along with partner Norma Rashid. For five years, he was the most popular news anchor in the city,[16] garnering ten local Emmy Awards for his nightly commentaries, which were frequently satirized by Cincinnati radio personality Gary Burbank. Those commentaries would eventually become his \"Final Thought\" on Jerry Springer. Springer would remain commentator at WLWT until January 1993. He resided in Loveland, Ohio, during this time.[36] In 1997, the Chicago-based NBC-owned station WMAQ-TV hired Springer to serve as a news commentator. However, this proved to be unpopular among viewers, as it resulted in the resignation of long-time news anchors Ron Magers and Carol Marin due to Springer's talk show. After performing only two commentaries, Springer resigned as commentator.[37][38] Jerry Springer debuted on September 30, 1991.[39] It started as a politically oriented talk show, a longer version of Springer's commentaries. Guests on the show included Oliver North and Jesse Jackson, and topics included homelessness and gun politics.[40][41][42] In early 1994, Springer and his new producer, Richard Dominick, revamped the show's format to garner higher ratings. The show became more successful as it became targeted toward tabloidish sensationalism.[43] Guests were everyday people confronted on a television stage by a spouse or family member's adultery, homosexuality, transsexuality, prostitution, transvestism, hate group membership, or other controversial situations.[43] These confrontations were often promoted by scripted shouting or violence on stage. The show received substantial ratings and much attention.[43] By 1998, it was beating The Oprah Winfrey Show in many cities, and was reaching around 8 million viewers.[44] On July 10, 2002, the sons of guest Nancy Campbell-Panitz â who was murdered by her ex-husband after they appeared on a May 2000 episode with his girlfriend â filed suit in Sarasota County against Springer, his producers, and his distributor, claiming he created \"a mood that led to murder\".[45] Ultimately, the estate of Campbell-Panitz dropped all monetary claims against Jerry Springer and the show agreed to waive its claims for malicious prosecution against the personal representative of the estate of Campbell-Panitz and his counsel.[46] The British musical, Jerry Springer: The Opera was inspired by him and his talk show. For the New York City performances of the work at Carnegie Hall his character was portrayed by Harvey Keitel. The show won four Olivier awards for its run on London's West End.[47] In 2005, a UK version of the show aired on Britain's ITV network titled The Springer Show. A subdued and more tongue-in-cheek version of the US show, it beat its talk-show rival Trisha Goddard five to one in the ratings.[48] The VH1 \"celebreality\" series The Springer Hustle, which took a look at how Jerry Springer is produced, premiered in April 2007.[49] In April 2015, Springer debuted The Jerry Springer Podcast on his website, JerrySpringer.com.[50] He later partnered with Westwood One to stream the podcast.[51] It was also broadcast in the UK on Talkradio, on Sundays at midnight. Springer was the second American talk show host to travel to Cuba, after Conan O'Brien, for The Jerry Springer Podcast.[52] The podcast ended in 2022.[53] On July 26, 2018, Jerry Springer aired its final episode in syndication after 27 seasons before it began airing reruns on The CW on September 10, 2018.[54] Springer debuted a new courtroom show, Judge Jerry, on September 9, 2019.[55] The show gave him the opportunity to host a more \"grown-up\" program and to use his law school education.[56] On March 9, 2022, the series was canceled after three seasons with its final episode airing on August 22, 2022.[57] Springer hosted America's Got Talent on NBC for its second and third seasons, replacing Regis Philbin,[58] before leaving to concentrate on other projects.[59] From January 17, 2005, to December 5, 2006, Springer hosted Springer on the Radio, a liberal talk show on Cincinnati's WCKY-AM. He did the show from the Clear Channel studios in Kenwood, Ohio on Mondays, Thursdays, and Fridays, and in Chicago (where his television show taped at the time) on Tuesdays and Wednesdays.[60] Air America Radio syndicated the program for most of the show's run. In 2007, Springer also cameoed in a handful of episodes of the George Lopez Show. He hosted Miss World in 2000[61] and 2001[62] and the Miss Universe 2008.[63] He was also the guest host for WWE Raw on February 15, 2010, at Wells Fargo Arena in Des Moines, Iowa. Springer also hosted The Price Is Right Live!. From 2010 to 2015, Springer hosted a dating game show called Baggage, which aired on GSN.[64] In July 2012, he hosted ''Price is Right Live!'' in Vancouver's Boulevard Casino.[65] He hosted the show at Jack Cincinnati Casino in 2018.[66] From January 2014, Springer hosted Investigation Discovery series Tabloid.[67] He hosted The Adam Carolla Show on April 25, 2014, where he sat in for Adam Carolla.[68] Springer guest hosted the 22nd-season premiere episode of WWE Raw on September 8, 2014, in an attempt to conduct an intervention with The Bella Twins.[69] Springer hosted the show Jerry Springer Presents WWE Too Hot For TV on the WWE Network in 2015.[70] After a few years of his US talk show being broadcast in the UK, ITV1 approached Springer, who temporarily co-hosted This Morning with Judy Finnigan in March 1999[71][72] and again in 2000. In summer 1999, ITV made 12 episodes of the UK-based version of the series, Jerry Springer UK, filmed at the same studios as his US show.[73] In September 1999, Springer made a pilot for a David Letterman-style talk show for ITV called Jerry Springer on Sunday. The show received good reviews and ratings and a further four episodes were commissioned to be broadcast in May 2000.[74] Five were broadcast during May and June 2000 under the name Springer.[75] The series was picked up by Channel 5 and renamed Late Night with Jerry Springer. Two series were made in 2000 and 2001 with 16 episodes.[76] While working for Channel 5 In 2001, he was the host of the UK version of Greed,[77] and a stand in host for The Wright Stuff. On April 16, 2006, Springer was the guest host for the opening show for the third series of The Friday Night Project for Channel 4 and guest hosted Have I Got News for You on December 12, 2008. In 2007, he signed on to host Nothing But the Truth, the UK version of Nada mÃ¡s que la verdad.[78] Springer covered the 2016 United States presidential election for ITV's Good Morning Britain.[79] In 2016, 2017 and 2018, he guest hosted three episodes of the BBC's The One Show with TV host Alex Jones.[80][81][82] Springer appeared in an episode of Married... with Children as the host of a talk show called The Masculine Feminist, in which he advocated for women getting the men's bowling night and eventually taking over at a bowling alley. Al Bundy and his friends tie Springer to a chair and take over his show with a stripper who jumps up and down for the crowd's delight.[83][84] Springer starred in the 1998 film Ringmaster as a talk show host largely based on himself, though named \"Jerry Farrelly\".[85] Ringmaster offers a behind-the-scenes look at would-be guests who apply to a Springer-like show. The same year, Springer also released an unrelated autobiography named Ringmaster. He quipped, \"I can only think of one title a year.\"[85] Four years later, Springer appeared in Brad Paisley's \"I'm Gonna Miss Her (The Fishin' Song)\" where the host is trying to stop a fight between men who like to fish and the wives who do not. Springer's section was titled \"My Husband Left Me for a Fish.\" The song hit number one of the country charts in July 2002 and won CMA Video of the Year three months later.[86] In 2004, he played the US president in The Defender, directed by Dolph Lundgren.[87] In June 2012, he appeared in Chicago at the Cambridge Theatre London as Billy Flynn for a short period of time, starring alongside Aoife Mulholland and Leigh Zimmerman.[88] He had a cameo appearance as himself in episode 2 of the Netflix show Happy!.[89] In 1996, he appeared on an episode of the ninth season of Roseanne and on The X-Files episode \"The Post-Modern Prometheus\".

That same year, he was in an episode of Space Ghost Coast to Coast. He made a cameo appearance in Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me (1999) as himself during an episode of his show featuring Dr. Evil and his estranged son Scott Evil.[90] In 2009, Springer appeared as a guest on the British game show Countdown. He appeared on the Chris Moyles Show in April 2009[91][92] and was a guest on The Andrew Marr Show on May 31, 2009.[93] He was interviewed by satirist Chris Morris in his surreal radio series Blue Jam (Series 2, Episode 6). On January 23, 2004, Springer was featured in an episode of This American Life titled \"Leaving the Fold\".[1] In late 2006, Springer was a contestant on the third season of Dancing with the Stars, with his professional dance partner, Kym Johnson. He wanted to appear on the show so he could learn the waltz for the wedding of his daughter, Katie.[60][94] Springer and Johnson were eliminated in the seventh week of competition.[95] Springer appeared in an episode of BBC One's television series Who Do You Think You Are? on August 27, 2008.[96] In the episode he traveled to Poland, where he discovered that his maternal grandmother had been sent to CheÅmno extermination camp by the Nazis and killed. His paternal grandmother died at Theresienstadt concentration camp in what is the Czech Republic. He wept openly when he learned of how they died.[97] Springer was a guest panelist on episodes of 8 Out of 10 Cats in 2014, Through the Keyhole in 2015,[98] and QI (\"Noodles\") in 2017.[99] In 2022, Springer competed in season eight of The Masked Singer as \"Beetle\". He was eliminated on \"Muppet Night\" alongside Kat Graham as \"Robo-Girl\".[100][101] In 1995, Springer recorded the album Dr. Talk for Fiddle Fish Records, which mostly consisted of country music covers.[102] On May 16, 2008, Springer delivered the Northwestern University School of Law commencement address.[103] Although many students had criticized the university's choice of speaker, he received a standing ovation from about half the audience and reviews of his speech were generally positive.[104] He later stated that his speech was about \"the ethical judgments we all have to make in whatever business we go\".[105] Springer married Micki Velton in 1973; though it is sometimes reported they divorced in 1994, a spokesperson said they were still married at the time of his death. The couple had a daughter, Katie, in 1976.[106] She was born without nasal passages, for which she required immediate surgery after birth, and is blind, as well as deaf in one ear. In a 2006 interview, Katie stated that her parents were always supportive despite her health complications and that they raised her as normally as possible.[107] In 2006, Springer donated $230,000 to Park School in Evanston, where his daughter worked as an assistant teacher, to help construct a high-tech facility called \"Katie's Corner\" for students with disabilities.[106] Springer died at his home in Evanston, Illinois, on April 27, 2023, at the age of 79.[108][109][110][111] A family spokesperson said that he had been diagnosed with pancreatic cancer a few months prior to his death.[112] Steve Wilkos, former Jerry Springer show bodyguard, paid tribute to his colleague, saying \"Other than my father, Jerry was the most influential man in my life. Everything I have today I owe to Jerry. He was the smartest, most generous, kindest person I've ever known. My wife and I are devastated. We will miss him terribly.\" He was buried at Memorial Park Cemetery, Skokie, Illinois, U.S.[113] During and after his career, Springer and his program quickly became a cultural phenomenon, with commentators describing the show as central to the emergence of trash TV.[2] After his death, The Guardian said that Springer \"changed US television for better and worse\".[114] Despite his controversial career, he had a large fanbase from millennials, as his show gained popularity throughout their childhoods, leading the Los Angeles Times to dub him the \"millennials' babysitter\".[115] At the time of his death, Springer was credited for creating a new television format which encouraged conflict among its guests. USA Today cited him as an inspiration for other tabloid talk shows such as Maury and The Steve Wilkos Show. The Associated Press said that Springer's show was \"a US cultural pariah, synonymous with lurid drama\". In an obituary for Springer, The Irish Times said that Springer had changed the \"television medium\" through \"The Jerry Springer Formula\", which was \"straightforward, despicable and ingenious\".[116] The BBC noted that Springer had televised the \"fringes of [American] society to a global audience\" and called him an \"era-defining TV host\".[53]",

He was the host for The Jerry Springer Show. He served as Mayor of Cincinnati from 1977 to 1978 as a Democrat.[3] Springer was born in February 13, 1944 in Highgate, London to Jewish parents from Germany.[4] He was raised in London until he and his parents moved to New York City and in Chicago, Illinois. He was the Mayor of Cincinnati from 1977 through 1978. He married Vicki Melton in 1973. He lived in Cincinnati, Ohio and in Chicago, Illinois. After announcing his candidacy, Springer was called to active duty and stationed at Fort Knox. He resumed his campaign after he was discharged. In 1973 Springer got married to Micki Velton and had one daughter, Katie Springer (born 1976), and got divorced in 1994. Springer died on April 27, 2023, at the age of 79, at his home in Evanston, Illinois. A family spokesperson said he had been diagnosed with pancreatic cancer a few months before his death.[5][6] Media related to Jerry Springer at Wikimedia Commons",

                "content": "The Tennessee Volunteers men's basketball team is the collegiate men's basketball program for the University of TennesseeâKnoxville. The Volunteers (commonly referred to as the \"Vols\") compete in Division I of the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) and the Southeastern Conference (SEC). The Volunteers play their home games in ThompsonâBoling Arena, on a court nicknamed \"the Summitt\", after former Tennessee Lady Vols basketball coach Pat Summitt. With a current capacity of 21,678 (formerly 24,535), Tennessee has consistently ranked in the top 15 in the nation in terms of volume of attendance, averaging 14,817 (60.39% capacity) attendance from 1988 through 2006, and averaging 17,194 (79.34% capacity) attendance from 2007 through 2018 after reducing seating capacity prior to the 2007 season.[2][3] Historically, Tennessee ranks third in the SEC in all-time wins.[4] Many notable players have played collegiately at Tennesseeâplayers such as Bernard King, Dale Ellis, Allan Houston, Tobias Harris, Grant Williams, and Dalton Knecht who all play(ed) in the NBA. Chris Lofton, Ron Slay, Tyler Smith, and John Fulkerson are also notable players who later played professionally in other leagues. The Volunteers are currently coached by Rick Barnes, who was hired on March 31, 2015, to replace Donnie Tyndall. In 1963, the University of Tennessee hired Ray Mears to become the head coach of the men's basketball program. The hiring of Mears, who was coming off an NCAA small college championship at Wittenberg University, ushered in the most sustained period of success in Tennessee men's basketball history. In his first year, Mears's Volunteers improved from a 4â19 record in 1962 to 13â11, highlighted by two wins over the Kentucky Wildcats. Before Mears, Tennessee had only beaten the Wildcats twice in 39 meetings. Throughout his career, Mears gained notoriety throughout the SEC for frequently being a thorn in the powerhouse Kentucky's side.[citation needed] In an era where Kentucky was coached by future College Basketball Hall of Fame members Adolph Rupp and Joe B. Hall, winning 75% of their games, Mears recorded a 15â15 record against the Wildcats. Led by A. W. Davis, the Volunteers finished second in the SEC in each of the next two seasons and recorded 20 wins in 1965, reaching that mark for the first time in 17 years. This success and the resultant growing fan support led to the university's decision to expand the 7,500-seat Amory-Fieldhouse to 12,700 seats. It was renamed Stokely Athletic Center to honor William B. Stokely, whose donation funded the renovation. In the expanded Stokely Center's inaugural season, the Volunteers captured the 1967 SEC championship and made the program's first-ever NCAA tournament appearance. Dubbed the \"Fearless Five,\" the 1967 team won road games against top conference teams Florida, Kentucky, and Mississippi State. The win over Mississippi State, coming in double-overtime on a pair of Bill Justus free throws, secured Tennessee's first SEC championship in 24 years and is referred to by some as the greatest basketball game in Tennessee history.[citation needed] From 1968 to 1973, Mears kept Tennessee among the top teams of the SEC, winning a second SEC championship in 1972 and finishing second in every year except 1970. In 1974, Mears and his trusted assistant Stu Aberdeen were able to recruit New York City standout forward Ernie Grunfeld to Knoxville. In his freshman season, Grunfeld led the team in scoring, averaging 17.4 points per game, and received first-team All-SEC honors. The following season, Grunfeld was joined by fellow New Yorker Bernard King. Known as \"The Ernie and Bernie Show,\" King and Grunfeld led the Volunteers to a 61â20 record over three years and an SEC championship in 1977. During their three years together, Tennessee posted a 5â1 record against Kentucky. The Volunteers reached the National Invitation Tournament in 1975 and the NCAA tournament in 1976 and 1977. King was named first-team All-American and SEC Player of the Year in 1975 and 1976, and then shared the honor with Grunfeld in 1977, with both being named SEC Co-Player of the Year. Grunfeld graduated from Tennessee in 1977 and King chose to forgo his senior year to enter the NBA draft. King was drafted 7th overall to the New Jersey Nets and Grunfeld went 11th overall to the Milwaukee Bucks. Both enjoyed long and illustrious NBA careers. Perhaps the biggest impact of the \"Ernie and Bernie\" show was how it changed the national perception of the Tennessee basketball program.[citation needed] This \"Double Trouble from Tennessee\" was featured in the February 1976 edition of Sports Illustrated.[5] In 2013, ESPN premiered a 30 for 30 documentary called \"Bernie and Ernie\" about the all-time great Volunteer basketball players. Following the exit of his two biggest stars, Mears, who long struggled with depression,[6] was not able to coach the team in 1978. Under the watch of interim coach Cliff Wettig, the Volunteers struggled to an 11â16 record, and Mears officially retired for health reasons after the season.[7] Mears is remembered not only as the greatest coach in Tennessee men's basketball history, but also as a great entertainer and marketer.[citation needed] From the beginning of his time at Tennessee, Mears employed marketing tactics to get fans to gamesâfrom his patented and provocative orange blazer, to his introduction of the Pride of the Southland Band to basketball games, to his entertaining pre-game warmups that compared to the Harlem Globetrotters for creativity.[8] At the beginning of his tenure, Mears declared, \"This is Big Orange Country,\" and this slogan has lived on long past his coaching years.[9] Don DeVoe was named Mears's successor and took over as head coach for the 1979 season. Despite the losing record in 1978, DeVoe inherited a roster centered on All-American center Reggie Johnson. DeVoe's 1979 Volunteers finished the regular season with a 21â12 record, beating Kentucky twice and earning a second-place finish in the SEC. The 1979 SEC tournament was the first held in 27 years, and the Volunteers reached the tournament finals, where they once again defeated Kentucky by a score of 75â69 to win their first SEC Tournament championship since 1943. With the tournament championship win, the Volunteers were invited back to the NCAA tournament, where they recorded the program's first NCAA tournament win with a defeat of Eastern Kentucky. Tennessee was eliminated in the second round with a loss to Notre Dame. DeVoe led Tennessee to the NCAA tournament each of the next five years, but none of his teams advanced past the second round. Through his first seven years at UT, DeVoe compiled an overall record of 143â79 (.644). The program's momentum under his direction eventually weakened, however, and the Volunteers were not invited to the NCAA tournament or the NIT in 1986 or 1987. Entering the 1989 season, DeVoe's 11th year at Tennessee, his teams had not reached the NCAA tournament or finished above 6th in the SEC since 1983. DeVoe led the Volunteers to a 19â11 record and a berth in the NCAA tournament. After an 84â68 loss to West Virginia in the first round, DeVoe resigned. The growth of UT basketball under DeVoe is still seen today in the Vols' current home arena, ThompsonâBoling Arena, which was built during his tenure. By the mid-1980s, the overflow crowds had grown too large for the 12,700-seat Stokley Athletic Center. In 1988, the Volunteers moved to the new $30 million ThompsonâBoling Arena, which seated over 24,500 peopleâat the time, the largest facility ever built specifically for basketball in the United States. Sitting on the banks of the Tennessee River nearby historic Neyland Stadium, the arena has accommodated 21,678 people since a 2007 renovation. In 1990, Wade Houston, an Alcoa, Tennessee native and former assistant coach at Louisville, became the first African-American head coach in Tennessee and SEC history. Houston's son, Allan Houston, came to UT to play for his father and would become one of the most accomplished players in Tennessee history. With 2801 points, Allan Houston finished his career as Tennessee's all-time leading scorer and was named All-American in 1992 and 1993. Houston was fired after a 5â22 campaign in 1994, finishing the worst season in Tennessee history. None of his teams reached the NCAA tournament, and only two of his teams received invitations to the NIT, the two of which were also his only teams to finish with winning records. Houston finished with an overall record of 65â90 at Tennessee. Houston was replaced by Kevin O'Neill in 1995. O'Neillâan intense and somewhat high-strung sideline coach, but also a skilled recruiter[citation needed]âtook over a program depleted in talent. He was able to sign talented players such as Brandon Wharton, Tony Harris, and Isiah Victor. O'Neill left Tennessee to become the head coach at Northwestern after the 1997 season. O'Neill was replaced by Oregon Ducks head coach Jerry Green. Green inherited a roster with significant young talent and was able to an immediate improvement in on-court success. His first Tennessee team produced a 20â9 overall recordâa nine-win improvement over the 11â16 record of O'Neill's third and final UT teamâand advanced to the 1998 NCAA tournament. In his second year, Green's Volunteers won the 1999 SEC East Division championship and defeated Kentucky twice in the same season for the first time since 1979, in what is generally regarded to be the best overall year in school athletics history. (The 1998 Tennessee Football team finished 13â0 and won the first-ever BCS National Championship. In women's basketball, Pat Summitt led the Lady Volunteers to a 39â0 NCAA championship season, the program's third consecutive national title.) The 2000 Tennessee men's basketball team finished 26â7, repeating as SEC East champions, winning the Volunteers' first SEC championship since 1982, and setting a program record for most wins in a single season. In the NCAA tournament, the Volunteers advanced to the first Sweet Sixteen in school history, where they lost a close contest to North Carolina. Green's Volunteers began the 2001 season with a 16â1 record, rising to No. 4 in the AP Poll. Beginning with a ten-point loss at Kentucky in mid-January, Tennessee then struggled to a 22â11 finish. Green's team advanced to the NCAA tournamentâthe fourth appearance in Green's four seasonsâlosing in the first round. Coupled with his multiple incidents with local media and Tennessee fans,[10] this disappointing finish to the season led to Green's resignation. He was replaced by Buzz Peterson, who failed to lead the program to an NCAA tournament berth in his four years as head coach. He was fired after the 2005 season, in which his team finished 14â17. After taking WisconsinâMilwaukee to a Sweet Sixteen in 2005, Bruce Pearl was hired as the new Tennessee men's basketball coach. Pearl's assistants Tony Jones, Steve Forbes, Jacob Nichols, Jason Shay, and Ken Johnson were part of a staff that would help to lead the Volunteers to the NCAA tournament six years in a row. Pearl inherited a roster that had not experienced much winning, but showed promise with future NBA senior point guard C. J. Watson and All-SEC freshman team shooting guard Chris Lofton. Pearl's coaching, which included playing an up-tempo style and pressing defense, led to immediate gains for Tennessee. In his first season, Pearl led the Volunteers to a 22â8 record, an SEC East Division championship, and a no. 2 seed in the NCAA Tournament. Pearl's first team achieved some of the more memorable wins in program history, including two wins against the eventual national champion Florida Gators. Another memorable win came when Chris Lofton, who is a Kentucky native, led the Volunteers over Kentucky in Rupp Arena for the program's first win there since 1999. Pearl's 2006 recruiting class was ranked among the top ten in college basketball.[11] Despite the influx of freshmen and their inexperience, the Volunteers were able to open with a 13â2 start to the season. All-American guard Chris Lofton was injured and missed a good portion of January and early February, during which time the Volunteers opened 3â5 in SEC play. After Lofton returned, Tennessee won 7 out of their last 8 regular season games. Given a no. 5 seed, the Volunteers returned to the Sweet Sixteen where they faced no. 1 seed Ohio State. Tennessee led 49â32 at halftime, but the eventual NCAA runner-up Buckeyes mounted a comeback to defeat the Volunteers by a score of 85â84. During the 2006â07 season, the Volunteers were ranked 4th nationally in attendance, with an average of 19,661 fans in ThompsonâBoling Arena, which has a capacity of 21,758. This marked an increase in attendance of an average of 7,436 per game since Pearl arrived in March 2005.[citation needed] Preseason expectations for the Volunteers were high entering the 2008 season.[12] Chris Lofton was a preseason pick by some to win National Player of the Year, and he was joined by Tyler Smith, an All-Big Ten freshman transfer from Iowa. Senior guards JaJuan Smith and Jordan Howell, along with rising sophomores Wayne Chism and Ramar Smith, propelled the Volunteers to a preseason no. 7 ranking. The team posted a record of 28â3 in the regular season. The season was highlighted by the rivalry matchup between Tennessee and Memphis. John Calipari's Tigers were undefeated and ranked no. 1 and the Volunteers were no. 2. In front the largest TV audience to date to ever watch a game on ESPN, the two teams remained evenly matched for thirty-nine minutes. The Volunteers trailed 61â60 with 30 seconds left before Tyler Smith made a jump-shot to give UT the lead. The Volunteers added three free throws and took the contest by a score of 66â62. The following Monday, Tennessee was ranked no. 1 in polls for the first time in school history. The Volunteers finished the regular season as the outright SEC champions and the no. 1 seed for the SEC Tournament in Atlanta. The Volunteers won their first game to set up a semifinal matchup against Arkansas in the Georgia Dome. The night before the game, an EF2 tornado hit Downtown Atlanta, damaging the Georgia Dome and much of the surrounding area. Because of this, the tournament was nearly canceled but was ultimately moved to Georgia Tech's Alexander Memorial Coliseum. The Razorbacks were able to upset the Volunteers, denying them a place in the final and a shot at their first SEC Tournament championship in 30 years. The Volunteers received a no. 2 seed in the NCAA tournament. They advanced to the Sweet Sixteen, where they lost to the Louisville Cardinals men's basketball. Despite the disappointing ending, the 2008 season is remembered as one of the best in program history. Replacing Chris Lofton proved a difficult task in the 2009 season. Now led by Tyler Smith, the Volunteers finished with a 21â13 record. However, Tennessee claimed another SEC division championship. The Volunteers advanced to the SEC Tournament Championship in Tampa before losing to Mississippi State 64â61. The Volunteers lost their NCAA tournament first-round game to Oklahoma State. Entering the regular season ranked in the top 10, the Volunteers started the season 10â2. On New Year's Day, players Melvin Goins, Cam Tatum, Brian Williams, and leading scorer Tyler Smith were arrested after a traffic stop when police found marijuana and an illegal firearm.[13] The players were all suspended for multiple games and Tyler Smith was eventually dismissed from the team.[14] After the suspensions, the Volunteers were left with only six scholarship players. The Volunteers defeated Charlotte and then hosted no. 1 Kansas the next game. In front of a sellout crowd, the undermanned Volunteers defeated the Jayhawks 76â68. Tennessee cemented its lead with a shot clock-beating three-point shot with under a minute left by local freshman walk-on Skylar McBee, who entered the rotation due to the suspensions. Tennessee rode the momentum of the Kansas upset to a 23â7 regular season record. This included another upset of second-ranked Kentucky, which featured future NBA All-Stars John Wall and DeMarcus Cousins, as well as four other eventual NBA players. The Volunteers won 74â65 at home in front of a raucous crowd. The Wildcats were able to avenge the loss a week and half later in the SEC Tournament. As a no. 6 seed in a bracket featuring overall top seed Kansas, the Volunteers defeated a Steve Fisher-coached San Diego State team with Kawhi Leonard in the first round. No. 14 seed Ohio upset the no. 3 seed Georgetown Hoyas, setting up a matchup between the Volunteers and the Bobcats in the following round. After winning 83â68, Tennessee advanced to Bruce Pearl's third Sweet Sixteen in five years. In a rematch of the 2007 Sweet Sixteen, the Volunteers faced the Ohio State Buckeyes at the Edward Jones Dome in St. Louis. In a back and forth battle with the Evan Turner-led Buckeyes, Tennessee held a 76â73 lead with 13 seconds left. Turner missed a three-point shot, rebounded his own missed shot, and attempted a final three-point shot that was blocked by J. P. Prince, securing the Volunteers an appearance in the Elite Eight for the first time in program history. Tennessee faced Michigan State in the Elite Eight. After a fast start, the Vols sputtered in the second half and Michigan State was able to keep the game close. Down by one point with 11 seconds left, Tennessee's Scotty Hopson was set to attempt two free throws. He made the first but missed the second. With the score tied, Michigan State advanced the ball and was fouled on a fast break. Raymar Morgan made one of two free throws, and Michigan State was able to defeat Tennessee one game short of the Final Four. Tennessee opened the 2010â11 season with success, winning the Preseason NIT and rising as high as no. 7 in the national polls. In mid-December, the NCAA announced an investigation into Bruce Pearl for his role in a possible recruiting violation.[citation needed] SEC Commissioner Mike Slive suspended Pearl for the first half of the SEC season.[15] Tennessee faltered throughout the rest of the season to a 19â15 record. Tennessee appeared in the NCAA tournament for the sixth consecutive year under Pearl and faced Michigan in the opening round. The Volunteers were defeated 75â45 in what proved to be Pearl's last game. On March 21, 2011, the week after the loss, the university announced the firing of Pearl, based on Pearl's misconduct of lying to the NCAA in the ongoing investigation.[16] Pearl was eventually given a three-year show-cause penalty. On March 27, 2011, the University of Tennessee announced the hiring of Cuonzo Martin as the Volunteers' 18th head coach. Martin had spent the prior three seasons at Missouri State, where he compiled a record of 61â41. Martin was able to lead the Missouri State team from an 11â20 record and a last-place finish in the Missouri Valley Conference to a 26â9 record and a first-place conference finish. Martin took over a depleted roster with low expectations. After the departure of Tobias Harris following his freshman season, the Volunteers were picked to finish near the bottom of the SEC in 2011â12.[citation needed] With the emergence of Jordan McRae and Jeronne Maymon, and the mid-season addition of Jarnell Stokes, Martin took a team that had lost their top threeâand seven of their top tenâcontributors from the previous season to a second-place finish in the SEC, largely because of their tough defense and lack of turnovers. With an outside chance at the NCAA tournament, the Volunteers lost their first SEC tournament game to Ole Miss, ending their NCAA chances. They played in the NIT before losing in the second round. In 2012â13, the Volunteers started off slowly, posting an 11â10 record before finishing the regular season 8â1. UT was eliminated in the second round of the SEC Tournament and was left out of the NCAA tournament for the second straight year, finishing as one of the last teams out.[citation needed] Expectations were high heading into 2013â14 with a roster many felt could compete for a Sweet Sixteen appearance.[citation needed] However, the fans quickly grew vocally upset after another slow start of 16â11. A petition with thousands of signatures surfaced online for the firing of Cuonzo Martin and the re-hiring of Bruce Pearl, whose show-cause order was ending the next year.[citation needed] Whether the petition motivated the team or not, the Volunteers finished the season 5â1 and earned a place in the \"First Four\" round of the NCAA tournament. They defeated Iowa in the play-in game in Dayton, Ohio to move on to face the UMass Minutemen. Martin's Volunteers, who were the lower seed, were favored by many and easily defeated UMass. In one of the biggest upsets in tournament history, Mercer upset Duke, and the Volunteers went on to defeat Mercer to advance to the Sweet Sixteen. Tennessee then played Michigan in Indianapolis. In front of one of the largest crowds to witness a Sweet Sixteen game, the Volunteers' comeback fell short and UT lost to Michigan by a score of 73â71. Martin resigned from Tennessee and accepted the coaching job at California on April 15, 2014.[17] After a brief coaching search, Tennessee athletics director Dave Hart announced on April 21, 2014 that former Morehead State and Southern Mississippi head coach Donnie Tyndall would become the next head coach of the Tennessee Volunteers.[18] Tyndall inherited a roster that returned one contributing player from the previous year. Also, due to Jarnell Stokes's decision to enter the NBA draft and two other players transferring, Tyndall had to recruit and sign nearly one-third of the 2015 team's roster in less than a month. Under these circumstances, he led the 2015 team to a 16â16 record. After the season was over, Tennessee announced it was firing Tyndall with cause after it learned that he had lied to both UT and the NCAA about the severity of major NCAA violations that had occurred at Southern Miss.[19] Hart said that he would have never hired Tyndall had the true extent of the violations been known. By this time, it was clear that Tyndall would face severe penalties for his role in the violations, including a suspension for part of the season. According to ESPN, Hart and other officials were still smarting from Pearl having to sit out the first half of conference play three years earlier, and were not willing to face the prospect of an equally lengthy suspension for Tyndall.[20] While searching for its third basketball coach in four years, Tennessee sought to make a hire that would bring much-needed stability to the program.[citation needed] During the search process, news broke that Texas had fired their head coach of 17 years, Rick Barnes. Barnes, who had a prior connection to Tennessee athletics director Dave Hart, quickly surfaced as the frontrunner for the job.[citation needed] On March 31, 2015, Barnes was named the new Tennessee men's basketball coach. Barnes boasts the best record of any coach in school history, with an overall record of 604â314 from his previous tenures at Texas, Clemson, and Providence. Barnes is originally from nearby Hickory, North Carolina, and his wife, Candy, graduated from Tennessee in 1975.[21] The Rick Barnes era began on a winning note as Tennessee defeated UNC Asheville, 82â78 in Barnes' debut game at UT. In Barnes' third year as Tennessee's coach he completed quite the turnaround from the previous year's 16â16 (8â10) team, as his team would finish the regular season 26â9 (13â5) and capture a share of the SEC regular season title. This would be Tennessee's first regular season title since 2008 and tenth overall.[22] Tennessee also reached the SEC men's basketball championship final where they were defeated by Kentucky 77â72. In 2019, Tennessee experienced their best season record wise under Barnes. The Volunteers would earn a record of 31â6 (15â3) including an 18-game win streak and a no.1 ranking in the polls for the first time since the 2007â08 season. The Volunteers again reached the SEC men's basketball championship final where they were defeated by Auburn 84â64. The Volunteers proceeded to earn a #2 seed in the 2019 NCAA tournament, where they defeated Colgate 77â70 in the first round.[23] Tennessee overcame a resurgent Iowa Hawkeyes team in the second round by a score of 83â77 in an overtime thriller. The Volunteers fell to Purdue in the Sweet Sixteen in overtime after a thrilling come-from-behind run led by Volunteer guard Admiral Schofield. Purdue's Ryan Cline kept the Boilermakers in the game late and after a controversial call on Lamonte Turner, the Vols lost. Junior forward Grant Williams captured the 2018â19 SEC player of the year award, his second consecutive year obtaining the honor.[24] Source[25][26][27] National champion Postseason invitational champion Conference regular season champion Conference regular season and conference tournament champion Division regular season champion Division regular season and conference tournament champion Conference tournament champion Tennessee plays its home games in ThompsonâBoling Arena, which was at one time the largest facility ever built specifically for basketball in the United States, with a seating capacity of 24,678 until its 2007 renovation. Named for the late B. Ray Thompson and former UT President Dr. Edward J. Boling, the arena regularly hosts women's volleyball matches, concerts, camps, conferences, and other special events throughout the year. ThompsonâBoling Arena opened during the 1987â88 season, with Tennessee defeating Marquette 82â56 before a crowd of 25,272. In its opening season, the Volunteers finished third nationally in attendance, with an average attendance of more than 20,000 fans per game. Much of the facility's storied history has centered on men's and women's basketball. In the last two decades, the Volunteers and Lady Volunteers have hosted record college basketball crowds, as well as WNBA and NCAA tournament basketball games. The Volunteers have ranked fourth in the nation in average home attendance for each of the past three seasons, including an average of 20,483 fans per game in 2008â09. Tennessee's 1989 men's game against Kentucky set the SEC regular-season record with a crowd of 25,610. The Lady Volunteers drew 24,597 fans for their 1998 game with Connecticut to establish a women's NCAA record, while a Celtics-Bullets game in 1988 attracted a then-NBA-record exhibition crowd of 23,611. The arena's largest basketball crowd since its capacity was reduced to 21,678 prior to the 2007â08 season came on January 7, 2009, when the Vols hosted Gonzaga in front of a sellout crowd of 22,326. UT hosted the NCAA tournament's South Regional Finals in 1994 and 1999 in the spacious facility, as well as the 1990 NCAA Southeast Region's first- and second-round games and the NCAA women's 1990 Final Four. The 1989 SEC Tournament was the first of what promised to be many postseason tournaments to be held in ThompsonâBoling Arena. The riverfront arena has drawn rave reviews from teams, administrators, and media for its modern facilities needed for hosting major tournaments. The Volunteers have appeared in the NCAA tournament 26 times. Their combined record is 28â27. The Volunteers have appeared in the National Invitation Tournament (NIT) 13 times. Their combined record is 13â13. â : First Team All-American Tennessee has retired five jersey numbers.[30][31][32][33][34]",

Before then, more than 300 years ago, Richmond's drinking water came from numerous springs and an open stream flowing from the Capitol across Main Street. Over the years the plant has been upgraded and enlarged to meet growing demand. Today, Richmond's Department of Public Utilities' (DPU) water plant can produce up to 132 million gallons per day (MGD). DPU also provides water to Henrico, Chesterfield, Hanover, Goochland and Powhatan counties through wholesale contracts. Details are outlined in the current water plan. DPU has invested millions of dollars to ensure it always meets or exceeds federal regulations as well as the increasing regional demands for reliable, high-quality drinking water. Water utility employees perform numerous water tests every day and maintain more than 1,200 miles of water lines so that when you turn on the tap, your family will receive water that is clean and safe. Explore the video to discover how clean and safe water is delivered to you. The City of Richmond Department of Public Utilities is a member of the American Water Works Association, the American Water Works Association Research Foundation, and the Association of Metropolitan Water Agencies. These organizations are dedicated to furthering knowledge and research on safe drinking water. Drinking water, including bottled water, may reasonably be expected to contain at least small amounts of some substances. The presence of substances does not necessarily indicate that the water poses a health risk. More information about substances and potential health effects may be obtained by calling the Environmental Protection Agency âs (EPA) Safe Drinking Water Hotline at 1-800-426-4791. Some people may be more vulnerable to certain substances in drinking water than the general population. Immuno-compromised people - such as those with cancer who are undergoing chemotherapy, those who have undergone organ transplants, those with HIV/AIDS or other immune system disorders, and some elderly people and infants - can be particularly at risk from infections. These people should seek advice from their health care providers about drinking water. EPA/CDC (Centers for Disease Control) guidelines on appropriate means to lessen the risk of infection by Cryptosporidium and other microbial substances are available from the Safe Drinking Water Hotline at 1-800-426-4791. The 1996 Safe Drinking Water Act requires water utilities to provide consumers with a yearly report on the source and quality of the water they drink. You may also find our Water Quality Reports on this page. The state allows us to monitor for some substances less than once per year because the concentrations of these substances do not change frequently. The Virginia Department of Health conducted a source water assessment of our system during 2002. The Richmond Water Treatment Plant was determined to be of high susceptibility to contamination, using criteria developed by the state in its EPA-approved Source Water Assessment Program. The assessment report consists of maps showing the source water assessment area, an inventory of known land use activities of concern, and documentation of any known contamination within the last five years from the date of assessment. This report is available by contacting the Department of Public Utilities at 646-5777. The water quality report is a snapshot of the cityâs drinking water quality over the past year. Included is information about your water, what it contains and how it compares with standards mandated by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the Virginia Department of Health. This report is being provided to comply with the 1996 Safe Drinking Water Act. Landlords, businesses and other property owners are encouraged to share this drinking water quality report with tenants. For free additional copies or more information about your water and this report, call the City of Richmond Department of Public Utilities at 646-6405.

More information about substances and potential health effects may be obtained by calling the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) Safe Drinking Water Hotline at 1-800-426-4791. As water travels over land or through the ground, it dissolves naturally occurring minerals and, in some cases, radioactive material. Water can pick up substances resulting from the presence of animals or human activity. Substances that may be present in source water include: Water treatment significantly reduces the level of these substances in drinking water. In order to ensure that tap water is safe to drink, Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) regulations limit the amount of certain substances in water provided by public water systems. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) regulations establish limits for substances in bottled water, which must provide the same protection for public health. If present, elevated levels of lead can cause serious health problems, especially for pregnant women and young children. Lead in drinking water is primarily from materials and components associated with service lines and home plumbing. The City of Richmond is responsible for providing high quality drinking water, but cannot control the variety of materials used in plumbing components. When your water has been sitting for several hours, you can minimize the potential for lead exposure by flushing your tap for 15-30 seconds or until it becomes cold or reaches a steady temperature before using water for cooking or drinking. If you are concerned about lead in your water, you may wish to have your water tested. Information on lead in drinking water, testing materials, and steps you can take to minimize exposure is available from the Drinking Water Hotline. Crytosporidium is a microbial parasite found in surface water throughout the United States. We collected seven samples in 2017 and found an average of 5.4 Oocysts/100L. This is less than the Action Level of 7.5 Oocysts/100L. Contact the City of Richmond Department of Public Utilities at (804) 646-4646 for additional copies of the Water Quality Report.
