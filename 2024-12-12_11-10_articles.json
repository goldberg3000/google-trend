                "content": "Barcelona (/ˌbɑːrsəˈloʊnə/ ⓘ BAR-sə-LOH-nə; Catalan: [bəɾsəˈlonə] ⓘ; Spanish: [baɾθeˈlona] ⓘ) is a city on the northeastern coast of Spain. It is the capital and largest city of the autonomous community of Catalonia, as well as the second-most populous municipality of Spain. With a population of 1.6 million within city limits,[8] its urban area extends to numerous neighbouring municipalities within the province of Barcelona and is home to around 5.3 million people,[3] making it the fifth most populous urban area of the European Union after Paris, the Ruhr area, Madrid and Milan.[3] It is one of the largest metropolises on the Mediterranean Sea, located on the coast between the mouths of the rivers Llobregat and Besòs, bounded to the west by the Serra de Collserola mountain range. According to tradition, Barcelona was founded by either the Phoenicians or the Carthaginians, who had trading posts along the Catalonian coast.[9] In the Middle Ages Barcelona became the capital of the County of Barcelona. After joining with the Kingdom of Aragon to form the confederation of the Crown of Aragon, Barcelona, which continued to be the capital of the Principality of Catalonia, became the most important city in the Crown of Aragon and the main economic and administrative centre of the Crown, only to be overtaken by Valencia, wrested from Moorish control by the Catalans, shortly before the dynastic union between the Crown of Castile and the Crown of Aragon in 1492. Barcelona became the centre of Catalan separatism, briefly becoming part of France during the 17th century Reapers' War and again in 1812 until 1814 under Napoleon. It was the capital of Revolutionary Catalonia during the Spanish Revolution of 1936, and the seat of government of the Second Spanish Republic later in the Spanish Civil War, until its capture by the fascists in 1939. After the Spanish transition to democracy in the 1970s, Barcelona once again became the capital of an autonomous Catalonia. Barcelona has a rich cultural heritage and is today an important cultural centre and a major tourist destination. Particularly renowned are the architectural works of Antoni Gaudí and Lluís Domènech i Montaner, which have been designated UNESCO World Heritage Sites. The city is home to two of the most prestigious universities in Spain: the University of Barcelona and Pompeu Fabra University. The headquarters of the Union for the Mediterranean are located in Barcelona. The city is known for hosting the 1992 Summer Olympics as well as world-class conferences and expositions. In addition, many international sport tournaments have been played here. Barcelona is a major cultural, economic, and financial centre in southwestern Europe,[10] as well as the main biotech hub in Spain.[11] As a leading world city, Barcelona's influence in global socio-economic affairs qualifies it for global city status (Beta +).[12] Barcelona is a transport hub, with the Port of Barcelona being one of Europe's principal seaports and busiest European passenger port,[13] an international airport, Barcelona–El Prat Airport, which handles over 50 million passengers per year,[14] an extensive motorway network, and a high-speed rail line with a link to France and the rest of Europe.[15] The name Barcelona comes from the ancient Iberian Baŕkeno, attested in an ancient coin inscription found on the right side of the coin in Iberian script as ,[16] in Ancient Greek sources as Βαρκινών, Barkinṓn;[17][18] and in Latin as Barcino,[19] Barcilonum[20] and Barcenona.[21][22][23] Other sources suggest that the city may have been named after the Carthaginian general Hamilcar Barca, who was supposed to have founded the city in the 3rd century BC,[9][24] but there is no evidence its name in antiquity, Barcino, was connected with the Barcid family of Hamilcar.[25] During the Middle Ages, the city was variously known as Barchinona, Barçalona, Barchelonaa, and Barchenona. An abbreviated form sometimes used by locals for the city is Barna. Barça is only applied to the local football club FC Barcelona, not to the city. Another common abbreviation is 'BCN', which is also the IATA airport code of the Barcelona-El Prat Airport. The city is referred to as the Ciutat Comtal in Catalan and Ciudad Condal in Spanish (i.e., \"Comital City\" or \"City of Counts\"), owing to its past as the seat of the Count of Barcelona.[26] The origin of the earliest settlement at the site of present-day Barcelona is unclear. The ruins of an early settlement have been found, including different tombs and dwellings dating to earlier than 5000 BC.[27][28] In Greek mythology, the founding of Barcelona had been attributed to the mythological Hercules. According to tradition, Barcelona was founded by Punic (Phoenician) settlers, who had trading posts along the Catalonian coast.[9][29][30] In particular, some historians attribute the foundation of the city directly to the historical Carthaginian general, Hamilcar Barca, father of Hannibal, who supposedly named the city Barcino after his family in the 3rd century BC,[9][31] but this theory has been questioned.[25] Archeological evidence in the form of coins from the 3rd century BC have been found on the hills at the foot of Montjuïc with the name Bárkeno written in an ancient script in the Iberian language[citation needed]. Thus, we can conclude[clarification needed] that the Laietani[citation needed], an ancient Iberian (pre-Roman) people of the Iberian peninsula, who inhabited the area occupied by the city of Barcelona around 3–2 BC[clarification needed], called the area Bàrkeno, which means \"The Place of the Plains\" (Barrke = plains/terrace).[32][better source needed] In about 15 BC, the Romans redrew the town as a castrum (Roman military camp) centred on the \"Mons Taber\", a little hill near the Generalitat (Catalan Government) and city hall buildings. The Roman Forum, at the crossing of the Cardo Maximus and Decumanus Maximus, was approximately placed where current Plaça de Sant Jaume is. Thus, the political centre of the city, Catalonia, and its domains has remained in the same place for over 2,000 years. Under the Romans, it was a colony with the surname of Faventia,[33] or, in full, Colonia Faventia Julia Augusta Pia Barcino[34] or Colonia Julia Augusta Faventia Paterna Barcino. Pomponius Mela[35] mentions it among the small towns of the district, probably as it was eclipsed by its neighbour Tarraco (modern Tarragona), but it may be gathered from later writers that it gradually grew in wealth and consequence, favoured as it was with a beautiful situation and an excellent harbour.[36] It enjoyed immunity from imperial burdens.[37] The city minted its own coins; some from the era of Galba survive. Important Roman vestiges are displayed in Plaça del Rei underground, as a part of the Barcelona City History Museum (MUHBA); the typically Roman grid plan is still visible today in the layout of the historical centre, the Barri Gòtic (Gothic Quarter). Some remaining fragments of the Roman walls have been incorporated into the cathedral.[38] The cathedral, Catedral Basílica Metropolitana de Barcelona, is also sometimes called La Seu, which simply means cathedral (and see, among other things) in Catalan.[39][40] It is said to have been founded in 343. The city was conquered by the Visigoths in the early 5th century, becoming for a few years the capital of all Hispania. After being conquered by the Umayyads in the early 8th century, it was conquered after a siege in 801 by Charlemagne's son Louis, who made Barcelona the seat of the Carolingian \"Hispanic March\" (Marca Hispanica), a buffer zone ruled by the Count of Barcelona.[41] The Counts of Barcelona became increasingly independent and expanded their territory to include much of modern Catalonia, although in 985, Barcelona was sacked by the army of Almanzor.[42] The sack was so traumatic that most of Barcelona's population was either killed or enslaved.[43] In 1137, Aragon and the County of Barcelona merged in dynastic union[44][45] by the marriage of Ramon Berenguer IV and Petronilla of Aragon, their titles finally borne by only one person when their son Alfonso II of Aragon ascended to the throne in 1162. His territories were later to be known as the Crown of Aragon, which conquered many overseas possessions and ruled the western Mediterranean Sea with outlying territories in Naples and Sicily and as far as Athens in the 13th century. Barcelona was the leading slave trade centre of the Crown of Aragon up until the 15th century, when it was eclipsed by Valencia.[46] It initially fed from eastern and Balkan slave stock later drawing from a Maghribian and, ultimately, Subsaharan pool of slaves.[47] The Bank or Taula de canvi de Barcelona, often viewed as the oldest public bank in Europe, was established by the city magistrates in 1401. It originated from necessities of the state, as did the Bank of Venice (1402) and the Bank of Genoa (1407).[48] In the beginning of the Early Modern period, Barcelona lost political primacy, but the economy managed to achieve a balance between production capacity and imports.[49] In the context of the wider early recovery of Catalonia from the 17th-century crisis in the second half of the century, increasing maritime activity since 1675 doubled traffic in the port of Barcelona compared to figures from the beginning of the 17th century.[50] In the late 17th and early 18th century, Barcelona repeatedly endured the effects of war, including the 1691 bombing, the sieges of 1697, 1704, 1705, 1706, and the 1713 blockade and ensuing 1714 siege and assault.[51] In the 18th century, the population grew from 30,000 to about 100,000 inhabitants, as the city became one of the key mercantile centres in the Western Mediterranean, with inland influence up to Zaragoza, and to the south up to Alicante.[52] A fortress was built at Montjuïc that overlooked the harbour. Much of Barcelona was negatively affected by the Napoleonic wars, but the start of industrialization saw the fortunes of the province improve. In the mid-1850s, Barcelona was struggling with population density as it became an industrial, port city and European capital. The city's density was at 856 people per hectare, more than double that of Paris. Mortality rates were on the rise and any outbreaks of disease would devastate the population. To solve the issue, a civil engineer named Ildefons Cerdà proposed a plan for a new district known as the Eixample. The citizens of Barcelona had begun to demolish the medieval wall surrounding and constricting the city. Cerdà thought it best to transform the land outside the walls into an area characterized by a scientific approach to urbanization. His proposal consisted of a grid of streets to unite the old city and surrounding villages. There would also be wide streets to allow people to breathe clean air, gardens in the centre of each street block, integration of rich and poor giving both groups access to the same services, and smooth-flowing traffic. Urban quality, egalitarianism, hygiene, sunlight, and efficiency were all major keys for Cerdà's vision. Not everything he imagined would be realized within the Eixample district, but the iconic octagonal superblocks with chamfered corners for better visibility are his direct brainchild and remain immensely helpful even 170 years later. The district and its ideals were not appreciated at the time. The city council awarded the design of the extension plan to another architect. The Spanish government was the one to step in and impose Cerdà's plan, laying the groundwork for many more tensions between the Spanish and Catalan administrations. Regardless, some of the upper class citizens of Barcelona were excited by the new plan and began a race to build \"the biggest, tallest, most attractive house\" in the district. Their interest and money fueled the rich diversity that we now see in the district's architecture. In the end, Cerdà's ideas would have a lasting impact on Barcelona's development, earning it international recognition for its highly efficient approach to urban planning and design.[53][54] During the Spanish Civil War, the city, and Catalonia in general, were resolutely Republican. Many enterprises and public services were collectivized by the CNT and UGT unions. As the power of the Republican government and the Generalitat diminished, much of the city was under the effective control of anarchist groups. The anarchists lost control of the city to their own allies, the Communists and official government troops, after the street fighting of the Barcelona May Days. The fall of the city on 26 January 1939, caused a mass exodus of civilians who fled to the French border. The resistance of Barcelona to Franco's coup d'état was to have lasting effects after the defeat of the Republican government. The autonomous institutions of Catalonia were abolished,[57] and the use of the Catalan language in public life was suppressed. Barcelona remained the second largest city in Spain, at the heart of a region which was relatively industrialized and prosperous, despite the devastation of the civil war. The result was a large-scale immigration from poorer regions of Spain (particularly Andalusia, Murcia and Galicia), which in turn led to rapid urbanization. In 1992, Barcelona hosted the Summer Olympics. The after-effects of this are credited with driving major changes in what had, up until then, been a largely industrial city. As part of the preparation for the games, industrial buildings along the sea-front were demolished and 3 km (2 mi) of beach were created. New construction increased the road capacity of the city by 17%, the sewage handling capacity by 27% and the amount of new green areas and beaches by 78%. Between 1990 and 2004, the number of hotel rooms in the city doubled. Perhaps more importantly, the outside perception of the city was changed making, by 2012, Barcelona the 12th most popular city destination in the world and the 5th amongst European cities.[58][59][60][61][62] The death of Franco in 1975 brought on a period of democratization throughout Spain. Pressure for change was particularly strong in Barcelona, which considered that it had been punished during nearly forty years of Francoism for its support of the Republican government.[63] Massive, but peaceful, demonstrations on 11 September 1977 assembled over a million people in the streets of Barcelona to call for the restoration of Catalan autonomy. It was granted less than a month later.[64] The development of Barcelona was promoted by two events in 1986: Spanish accession to the European Community, and particularly Barcelona's designation as host city of the 1992 Summer Olympics.[65][66] The process of urban regeneration has been rapid, and accompanied by a greatly increased international reputation of the city as a tourist destination. The increased cost of housing has led to a slight decline (−16.6%) in the population over the last two decades of the 20th century as many families move out into the suburbs. This decline has been reversed since 2001, as a new wave of immigration (particularly from Latin America and from Morocco) has gathered pace.[67] In 1987, an ETA car bombing at Hipercor killed 21 people. On 17 August 2017, a van was driven into pedestrians on La Rambla, killing 14 and injuring at least 100, one of whom later died. Other attacks took place elsewhere in Catalonia. The Prime Minister of Spain, Mariano Rajoy, called the attack in Barcelona a jihadist attack. Amaq News Agency attributed indirect responsibility for the attack to the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL).[68][69][70] During the 2010s, Barcelona became the focus city[citation needed] for the ongoing Catalan independence movement, its consequent standoff between the regional and national government and later protests.[71] In July 2023, Barcelona was announced as the UNESCO-UIA World Capital of Architecture for the 2024–2026 term. This means it will be the hub for discussion around global challenges including culture, heritage, urban planning and architecture. In addition to being the capital through 2026, it will also host the UIA World Congress of Architects for that year. The honour is befitting of Barcelona, as its history is peppered with architectural achievement and various iconic styles and influences. From its ancient Roman roots, to the Gothic and Modernisme movements, Barcelona has thrived through the way it ties together architecture and culture.[72] Barcelona is located on the northeast coast of the Iberian Peninsula, facing the Mediterranean Sea, on a plain approximately 5 km (3 mi) wide limited by the mountain range of Collserola, the Llobregat river to the southwest and the Besòs river to the north.[73] This plain covers an area of 170 km2 (66 sq mi),[73] of which 101 km2 (39.0 sq mi)[74] are occupied by the city itself. It is 120 km (75 mi) south of the Pyrenees and the Catalan border with France. Tibidabo, 512 m (1,680 ft) high, offers striking views over the city[75] and is topped by the 288.4 m (946.2 ft) Torre de Collserola, a telecommunications tower that is visible from most of the city. Barcelona is peppered with small hills, most of them urbanized, that gave their name to the neighbourhoods built upon them, such as Carmel (267 m or 876 ft), Putxet (es) (181 m or 594 ft) and Rovira (261 m or 856 ft). The escarpment of Montjuïc (173 m or 568 ft), situated to the southeast, overlooks the harbour and is topped by Montjuïc Castle, a fortress built in the 17–18th centuries to control the city as a replacement for the Ciutadella. Today, the fortress is a museum and Montjuïc is home to several sporting and cultural venues, as well as Barcelona's biggest park and gardens. The city borders on the municipalities of Santa Coloma de Gramenet and Sant Adrià de Besòs to the north; the Mediterranean Sea to the east; El Prat de Llobregat and L'Hospitalet de Llobregat to the south; and Sant Feliu de Llobregat, Sant Just Desvern, Esplugues de Llobregat, Sant Cugat del Vallès, and Montcada i Reixac to the west. The municipality includes two small sparsely-inhabited exclaves to the north-west. According to the Köppen climate classification, Barcelona has a hot summer Mediterranean climate (Csa), with mild winters and warm to hot summers,[76] while the rainiest seasons are autumn and spring. The rainfall pattern is characterized by a short (3 months) dry season in summer, as well as less winter rainfall than in a typical Mediterranean climate. However, both June and August are wetter than February, which is unusual for the Mediterranean climate. This subtype, labelled as \"Portuguese\" by the French geographer George Viers after the climate classification of Emmanuel de Martonne[77] and found in the NW Mediterranean area (e.g. Marseille), can be seen as transitional to the humid subtropical climate (Cfa) found in inland areas. Barcelona is densely populated, thus heavily influenced by the urban heat island effect. Areas outside of the urbanized districts can have as much as 2 °C of difference in temperatures throughout the year.[78] Its average annual temperature is 21.2 °C (70.2 °F) during the day and 15.1 °C (59.2 °F) at night. The average annual temperature of the sea is about 20 °C (68 °F). In the coldest month, January, the temperature typically ranges from 12 to 18 °C (54 to 64 °F) during the day, 6 to 12 °C (43 to 54 °F) at night and the average sea temperature is 13 °C (55 °F).[79] In the warmest month, August, the typical temperature ranges from 27 to 31 °C (81 to 88 °F) during the day, about 23 °C (73 °F) at night and the average sea temperature is 26 °C (79 °F).[79] Generally, the summer or \"holiday\" season lasts about six months, from May to October. Two months – April and November – are transitional; sometimes the temperature exceeds 20 °C (68 °F), with an average temperature of 18–19 °C (64–66 °F) during the day and 11–13 °C (52–55 °F) at night. December, January and February are the coldest months, with average temperatures around 15 °C (59 °F) during the day and 9 °C (48 °F) at night. Large fluctuations in temperature are rare, particularly in the summer months. Because of the proximity to the warm sea plus the urban heat island, frosts are very rare in the city of Barcelona. Snow is also very infrequent in the city of Barcelona, but light snowfalls can occur yearly in the nearby Collserola mountains, such as in the Fabra Observatory located in a nearby mountain.[80] Barcelona averages 78 rainy days per year (≥ 1 mm), and annual average relative humidity is 72%, ranging from 69% in July to 75% in October. Rainfall totals are highest in late summer and autumn (September–November) and lowest in early and mid-summer (June–August), with a secondary winter minimum (February–March). Sunshine duration is 2,524 hours per year, from 138 (average 4.5 hours of sunshine a day) in December to 310 (average 10 hours of sunshine a day) in July.[81] According to Barcelona's City Council, the city's population as of 1 January 2016[update] was 1,608,746 people,[86] on a land area of 101.4 km2 (39 sq mi). It is the main component of an administrative area of Greater Barcelona, with a population of 3,218,071 in an area of 636 km2 (246 sq mi) (density 5,060 inhabitants/km2). The population of the urban area was 4,840,000.[3] It is the central nucleus of the Barcelona metropolitan area, which relies on a population of 5,474,482.[4] In 1900, Barcelona had a population of 533,000,[73] which grew steadily but slowly until 1950, when it started absorbing a high number of people from other less-industrialized parts of Spain. Barcelona's population peaked in 1979 at 1,906,998, and fell throughout the 1980s and 1990s as more people sought a higher quality of life in outlying cities in the Barcelona Metropolitan Area. After bottoming out in 2000 with 1,496,266 residents, the city's population began to rise again as younger people started to return, causing a great increase in housing prices.[87] Spanish is the most spoken language in Barcelona (according to the linguistic census held by the Government of Catalonia in 2013) and it is understood almost universally. Catalan is also very commonly spoken in the city: it is understood by 95% of the population, while 72.3% can speak it, 79% can read it, and 53% can write it.[88] Knowledge of Catalan has increased significantly in recent decades thanks to a language immersion educational system. After Catalan and Spanish, the most spoken languages in Barcelona are those from North Africa, such as Amazigh and Arabic, followed by Bengali, Urdu, Panjabi, Mandarin Chinese, Romanian, English, Russian and Quechua, according to data collected by the University of Barcelona.[89] Barcelona is one of the most densely populated cities in Europe. For the year 2008 the city council calculated the population to 1,621,090 living in the 102.2 km2 sized municipality, giving the city an average population density of 15,926 inhabitants per square kilometre with Eixample being the most populated district.[90][full citation needed] In the case of Barcelona though, the land distribution is extremely uneven. Half of the municipality or 50.2 km2, all of it located on the municipal edge is made up of the ten least densely populated neighbourhoods containing less than 10% of the city's population, the uninhabited Zona Franca industrial area and Montjuïc forest park. Leaving the remaining 90% or slightly below 1.5 million inhabitants living on the remaining 52 km2 (20 sq mi) at an average density close to 28,500 inhabitants per square kilometre.[90][full citation needed] Of the 73 neighbourhoods in the city, 45 had a population density above 20,000 inhabitants per square kilometre with a combined population of 1,313,424 inhabitants living on 38.6 km2 at an average density of 33,987 inhabitants per square kilometre. The 30 most densely populated neighbourhoods accounted for 57.5% of the city population occupying only 22.7% of the municipality, or in other words, 936,406 people living at an average density of 40,322 inhabitants per square kilometre. The city's highest density is found at and around the neighbourhood of la Sagrada Família where four of the city's most densely populated neighbourhoods are located side by side, all with a population density above 50,000 inhabitants per square kilometre.[90][full citation needed] In 1900, almost a third (28.9 percent) of the population were children (aged younger than 14 years). In 2017, this age group constituted only 12.7% of the population. In 2017, people aged between 15 and 24 years made up 9 percent of the population; those aged between 25 and 44 years made up 30.6 percent of the population; while those aged between 45 and 64 years formed 56.9% of all Barcelonans. In 1900, people aged 65 and older made up just 6.5 percent of the population. In 2017, this age group made up 21.5 percent of the population.[91][92] In 2016, about 59% of the inhabitants of the city were born in Catalonia and 18.5% coming from the rest of the country. In addition to that, 22.5% of the population was born outside of Spain, a proportion which has more than doubled since 2001 and more than quintupled since 1996 when it was 8.6% and 3.9% respectively.[86] The most important region of origin of migrants is Europe, with many coming from Italy (26,676) or France (13,506).[86] Moreover, many migrants come from Latin American nations such as Bolivia, Ecuador or Colombia. Since the 1990s, and similar to other migrants, many Latin Americans have settled in northern parts of the city.[94] There exists a relatively large Pakistani community in Barcelona with up to twenty thousand nationals. The community consists of significantly more men than women. Many of the Pakistanis are living in Ciutat Vella. First Pakistani migrants came in the 1970s, with increasing numbers in the 1990s.[95] Other significant migrant groups come from Asia as from China and the Philippines.[86] There is a Japanese community clustered in Bonanova, Les Tres Torres, Pedralbes, and other northern neighbourhoods, and a Japanese international school serves that community.[96] In 2007 most of the inhabitants stated they are Roman Catholic (208 churches).[97] In a 2011 survey conducted by InfoCatólica, 49.5% of Barcelona residents of all ages identified themselves as Catholic.[98] This was the first time that more than half of respondents did not identify themselves as Catholic Christians.[98] The numbers reflect a broader trend in Spain whereby the numbers of self-identified Catholics have declined.[98] In 2019, a survey by Centro de Investigaciones Sociológicas showed that 53.2% of residents in Barcelona identified themselves as Catholic (9.9% practising Catholics, 43.3% non-practising Catholics).[99] The province has the largest Muslim community in Spain, 322,698 people in Barcelona province are of Muslim religion.[100] A considerable number of Muslims live in Barcelona due to immigration (169 locations, mostly professed by Moroccans in Spain).[97] In 2014, 322,698 out of 5.5 million people in the province of Barcelona identified themselves as Muslim,[100] which makes 5.6% of the total population. The city also has the largest Jewish community in Spain, with an estimated 3,500 Jews living in the city.[101] There are also a number of other groups, including Evangelical (71 locations, mostly professed by Roma), Jehovah's Witnesses (21 Kingdom Halls), Buddhists (13 locations),[102] and Eastern Orthodox.[103] The Barcelona metropolitan area comprises over 66% of the people of Catalonia, one of the richer regions in Europe and the fourth richest region per capita in Spain, with a GDP per capita amounting to €28,400 (16% more than the EU average). The greater Barcelona metropolitan area had a GDP amounting to $177 billion (equivalent to $34,821 in per capita terms, 44% more than the EU average), making it the 4th most economically powerful city by gross GDP in the European Union, and 35th in the world in 2009.[104] Barcelona city had a very high GDP of €80,894 per head in 2004, according to Eurostat.[105] Furthermore, Barcelona was Europe's fourth best business city and fastest improving European city, with growth improved by 17% per year as of 2009[update].[106] Barcelona was the 24th most \"livable city\" in the world in 2015 according to lifestyle magazine Monocle.[107] Similarly, according to Innovation Analysts 2thinknow, Barcelona occupies 13th place in the world on Innovation Cities™ Global Index.[108] At the same time it is according to the Global Wealth and Lifestyle Report 2020 one of the most affordable cities in the world for a luxury lifestyle.[109] Barcelona has a long-standing mercantile tradition. Less well known is that the city industrialized early, taking off in 1833, when Catalonia's already sophisticated textile industry began to use steam power. It became the first and most important industrial city in the Mediterranean basin. Since then, manufacturing has played a large role in its history. Borsa de Barcelona (Barcelona Stock Exchange) is the main stock exchange in the northeastern part of the Iberian Peninsula. Barcelona was recognized as the Southern European City of the Future for 2014/15, based on its economic potential,[110] by FDi Magazine in their bi-annual rankings.[111] It also has several congress halls, notably Fira de Barcelona – the second largest trade fair and exhibition centre in Europe, that host a quickly growing number of national and international events each year (at present above 50). The total exhibition floor space of Fira de Barcelona venues is 405,000 m2 (41 ha), not counting Gran Via centre on the Plaza de Europa. However, the Eurozone crisis and deep cuts in business travel affected the council's positioning of the city as a convention centre. An important business centre, the World Trade Center Barcelona, is located in Barcelona's Port Vell harbour. The city is known for hosting well as world-class conferences and expositions, including the 1888 Exposición Universal de Barcelona, the 1929 Barcelona International Exposition (Expo 1929), the 2004 Universal Forum of Cultures and the 2004 World Urban Forum.[112] Barcelona was the 20th-most-visited city in the world by international visitors and the fifth most visited city in Europe after London, Paris, Istanbul and Rome, with 5.5 million international visitors in 2011.[113] By 2015, both Prague and Milan had more international visitors.[114] With its popular tree-lined pedestrian street, Les Rambles (Las Ramblas), Barcelona is ranked the most popular city to visit in Spain.[115] Barcelona is an internationally renowned tourist destination, with numerous recreational areas, one of the best beaches in the world,[116][117] mild and warm climate, historical monuments, including eight UNESCO World Heritage Sites, 519 hotels as of March 2016[update][118] including 35 five-star hotels,[119] and developed tourist infrastructure. Due to its large influx of tourists each year, Barcelona, like many other tourism capitals, has to deal with pickpockets, with wallets and passports being commonly stolen items. Despite its moderate pickpocket rate, Barcelona is considered one of the safest cities in terms of security and personal safety,[120] mainly because of a sophisticated policing strategy that has dropped crime by 32% in just over three years and has led it to be considered the 15th safest city in the world by Business Insider in 2016.[121] While tourism produces economic benefits, according to one report,[citation needed] the city is \"overrun [by] hordes of tourists\". In early 2017, over 150,000 protesters warned that tourism is destabilizing the city. Slogans included \"Tourists go home\", \"Barcelona is not for sale\" and \"We will not be driven out\". By then, the number of visitors had increased from 1.7 million in 1990 to 32 million in a city with a population of 1.62 million, increasing the cost of rental housing for residents and overcrowding the public places. While tourists spent an estimated €30 billion in 2017, they are viewed by some as a threat to Barcelona's identity.[122] A May 2017 article in the British online daily The Independent included Barcelona among the \"Eight Places That Hate Tourists the Most\" and included a comment from Mayor Ada Colau, \"We don't want the city to become a cheap souvenir shop\", citing Venice as an example.[123] To moderate the problem, the city has stopped issuing licenses for new hotels and holiday apartments; it also fined AirBnb €30,000. The mayor has suggested introducing a new tourist tax and setting a limit on the number of visitors.[123] One industry insider, Justin Francis, founder of the Responsible Travel agency, stated that steps must be taken to limit the number of visitors that are causing an \"overtourism crisis\" in several major European cities. \"Ultimately, residents must be prioritised over tourists for housing, infrastructure and access to services because they have a long-term stake in the city's success\", he said.[124] \"Managing tourism more responsibly can help\", Francis later told a journalist, \"but some destinations may just have too many tourists, and Barcelona may be a case of that\".[125] Industry generates 21% of the total gross domestic product (GDP) of the region,[126] with the energy, chemical and metallurgy industries accounting for 47% of industrial production.[127] The Barcelona metropolitan area had 67% of the total number of industrial establishments in Catalonia as of 1997.[128] Barcelona has long been an important European automobile manufacturing centre. Formerly there were automobile factories of AFA, Abadal, Actividades Industriales, Alvarez, America, Artés de Arcos, Balandrás, Baradat-Esteve, Biscúter, J. Castro, Clúa, David, Delfín, Díaz y Grilló, Ebro trucks, Edis [ca], Elizalde, Automóviles España, Eucort, Fenix, Fábrica Hispano, Auto Academia Garriga, Fábrica Española de Automóviles Hebe, Hispano-Suiza, Huracán Motors, Talleres Hereter, Junior SL, Kapi, La Cuadra, M.A., Automóviles Matas, Motores y Motos, Nacional Custals, National Pescara, Nacional RG, Nacional Rubi, Nacional Sitjes, Automóviles Nike, Orix, Otro Ford, Patria, Pegaso, PTV, Ricart, Ricart-España, Industrias Salvador, Siata Española, Stevenson, Romagosa y Compañía, Garaje Storm, Talleres Hereter, Trimak, Automóviles Victoria, Manufacturas Mecánicas Aleu.[129][130] Today, the headquarters and a large factory of SEAT (the largest Spanish automobile manufacturer) are in one of its suburbs. There is also a Nissan factory in the logistics and industrial area of the city.[131] The factory of Derbi, a large manufacturer of motorcycles, scooters and mopeds, also lies near the city.[132] As in other modern cities, the manufacturing sector has long since been overtaken by the services sector, though it remains very important. The region's leading industries are textiles, chemical, pharmaceutical, motor, electronic, printing, logistics, publishing, in telecommunications industry and culture the notable Mobile World Congress, and information technology services. The traditional importance of textiles is reflected in Barcelona's drive to become a major fashion centre. There have been many attempts to launch Barcelona as a fashion capital, notably Gaudi Home.[citation needed] Beginning in the summer of 2000, the city hosted the Bread & Butter urban fashion fair until 2009, when its organizers announced that it would be returning to Berlin. This was a hard blow for the city as the fair brought €100 m to the city in just three days.[133][134] From 2009, The Brandery, an urban fashion show, was held in Barcelona twice a year until 2012. According to the Global Language Monitor's annual ranking of the world's top fifty fashion capitals Barcelona was named as the seventh most important fashion capital of the world right after Milan and before Berlin in 2015.[135] As the capital of the autonomous community of Catalonia, Barcelona is the seat of the Catalan government, known as the Generalitat de Catalunya; of particular note are the executive branch, the parliament, and the High Court of Justice of Catalonia. The city is also the capital of the Province of Barcelona and the Barcelonès comarca (district). Barcelona is governed by a city council formed by 41 city councillors, elected for a four-year term by universal suffrage. As one of the two biggest cities in Spain, Barcelona is subject to a special law articulated through the Carta Municipal (Municipal Law). A first version of this law was passed in 1960 and amended later, but the current version was approved in March 2006.[136] According to this law, Barcelona's city council is organized in two levels: a political one, with elected city councillors, and one executive, which administers the programs and executes the decisions taken on the political level.[137] This law also gives the local government a special relationship with the central government and it also gives the mayor wider prerogatives by the means of municipal executive commissions.[138] It expands the powers of the city council in areas like telecommunications, city traffic, road safety and public safety. It also gives a special economic regime to the city's treasury and it gives the council a veto in matters that will be decided by the central government, but that will need a favourable report from the council.[136] The Comissió de Govern (Government Commission) is the executive branch, formed by 24 councillors, led by the Mayor, with 5 lieutenant-mayors and 17 city councillors, each in charge of an area of government, and 5 non-elected councillors.[139] The plenary, formed by the 41 city councillors, has advisory, planning, regulatory, and fiscal executive functions.[140] The six Commissions del Consell Municipal (City council commissions) have executive and controlling functions in the field of their jurisdiction. They are composed by a number of councillors proportional to the number of councillors each political party has in the plenary.[141] The city council has jurisdiction in the fields of city planning, transportation, municipal taxes, public highways security through the Guàrdia Urbana (the municipal police), city maintenance, gardens, parks and environment, facilities (like schools, nurseries, sports centres, libraries, and so on), culture, sports, youth and social welfare. Some of these competencies are not exclusive, but shared with the Generalitat de Catalunya or the central Spanish government. In some fields with shared responsibility (such as public health, education or social services), there is a shared Agency or Consortium between the city and the Generalitat to plan and manage services.[142] The executive branch is led by a Chief Municipal Executive Officer which answers to the Mayor. It is made up of departments which are legally part of the city council and by separate legal entities of two types: autonomous public departments and public enterprises.[143] The seat of the city council is on the Plaça de Sant Jaume, opposite the seat of Generalitat de Catalunya. Since the coming of the Spanish democracy, Barcelona had been governed by the PSC, first with an absolute majority and later in coalition with ERC and ICV. After the May 2007 election, the ERC did not renew the coalition agreement and the PSC governed in a minority coalition with ICV as the junior partner. After 32 years, on 22 May 2011, CiU gained a plurality of seats at the municipal election, gaining 15 seats to the PSC's 11. The PP hold 8 seats, ICV 5 and ERC 2. Since 1987, the city has been divided into 10 administrative districts (districtes in Catalan, distritos in Spanish): The districts are based mostly on historical divisions, and several are former towns annexed by the city of Barcelona in the 18th and 19th centuries that still maintain their own distinct character. Each district has its own council led by a city councillor. The composition of each district council depends on the number of votes each political party had in that district, so a district can be led by a councillor from a different party than the executive council. Barcelona has a well-developed higher education system of public universities. Most prominent among these are the University of Barcelona (established in 1450) and the more modern Pompeu Fabra University.[144][145] Barcelona is also home to the Polytechnic University of Catalonia, and in the private sector the EADA Business School (founded in 1957), which became the first Barcelona institution to run manager training programmes for the business community. IESE Business School, as well as the largest private educational institution, the Ramon Llull University, which encompasses schools and institutes such as the ESADE Business School. The Autonomous University of Barcelona, another public university, is located in Bellaterra, a town in the Metropolitan Area. Toulouse Business School and the Open University of Catalonia (a private Internet-centred open university) are also based in Barcelona. The city has a network of public schools, from nurseries to high schools, under the responsibility of a consortium led by city council (though the curriculum is the responsibility of the Generalitat de Catalunya). There are also many private schools, some of them Roman Catholic. Most such schools receive a public subsidy on a per-student basis, are subject to inspection by the public authorities, and are required to follow the same curricular guidelines as public schools, though they charge tuition. Known as escoles concertades, they are distinct from schools whose funding is entirely private (escoles privades). The language of instruction at public schools and escoles concertades is Catalan, as stipulated by the 2009 Catalan Education Act. Spanish may be used as a language of instruction by teachers of Spanish literature or language, and foreign languages by teachers of those languages. An experimental partial immersion programme adopted by some schools allows for the teaching of a foreign language (English, generally) across the curriculum, though this is limited to a maximum of 30% of the school day. No public school or escola concertada in Barcelona may offer 50% or full immersion programmes in a foreign language, nor does any public school or escola concertada offer International Baccalaureate programmes. Barcelona's cultural roots go back 2000 years. Since the arrival of democracy, the Catalan language (very much repressed during the dictatorship of Franco) has been promoted, both by recovering works from the past and by stimulating the creation of new works. Barcelona is designated as a world-class city by the Globalization and World Cities Study Group and Network.[146] It has also been part of the UNESCO Creative Cities Network as a City of Literature since 2015.[147] Barcelona has many venues for live music and theatre, including the world-renowned Gran Teatre del Liceu opera house, the Teatre Nacional de Catalunya, the Teatre Lliure and the Palau de la Música Catalana concert hall. Barcelona also is home to the Barcelona Symphony and Catalonia National Orchestra (Orquestra Simfònica de Barcelona i Nacional de Catalunya, usually known as OBC), the largest symphonic orchestra in Catalonia. In 1999, the OBC inaugurated its new venue in the brand-new Auditorium (L'Auditori). It performs around 75 concerts per season and its current director is Eiji Oue.[148] It is home to the Barcelona Guitar Orchestra, directed by Sergi Vicente. The major thoroughfare of La Rambla is home to mime artists and street performers. Yearly, two major pop music festivals take place in the city, the Sónar Festival and the Primavera Sound Festival. The city also has a thriving alternative music scene, with groups such as The Pinker Tones receiving international attention.[149] Barcelona is an international hub of highly active and diverse nightlife with bars, dance bars and nightclubs staying open well past midnight.[150] El Periódico de Catalunya, La Vanguardia and Ara are Barcelona's three major daily newspapers (the first two with Catalan and Spanish editions, Ara only in Catalan) while Sport and El Mundo Deportivo (both in Spanish) are the city's two major sports daily newspapers, published by the same companies. The city is also served by a number of smaller publications such as Ara and El Punt Avui (in Catalan), by nationwide newspapers with special Barcelona editions such as El País (in Spanish, with an online version in Catalan) and El Mundo (in Spanish), and by several free newspapers like 20 minutos and Què (all bilingual). Barcelona's oldest and main online newspaper VilaWeb is also the oldest one in Europe[citation needed] (with Catalan and English editions). Several major FM stations include Catalunya Ràdio, RAC 1, RAC 105 and Cadena SER. Barcelona also has a local TV station, Betevé, owned by city council. The headquarters of Televisió de Catalunya, Catalonia's public network, are located in Sant Joan Despí, in Barcelona's metropolitan area. Barcelona has a long sporting tradition and hosted the highly successful 1992 Summer Olympics as well as several matches during the 1982 FIFA World Cup (at the two stadiums). It has hosted about 30 sports events of international significance.[citation needed] FC Barcelona is a sports club best known worldwide for its football team, one of the largest and the wealthiest in the world.[151] It has 74 national trophies (while finishing 46 times as runners-up) and 17 continental prizes (with being runners-up 11 times), including five UEFA Champions League trophies out of eight finals and three FIFA Club World Cup wins out of four finals. The club won six trophies in a calendar year in 2009, becoming one of only 2 male football teams in the world to win the coveted sextuple, apart from FC Bayern Munich in 2020. FC Barcelona also has professional teams in other sports like FC Barcelona Regal (basketball), FC Barcelona Handbol (handball), FC Barcelona Hoquei (roller hockey), FC Barcelona Ice Hockey (ice hockey), FC Barcelona Futsal (futsal) and FC Barcelona Rugby (rugby union), all at one point winners of the highest national or European competitions. The club's museum is the second most visited in Catalonia. The matches against cross-town rivals RCD Espanyol are of particular interest, but there are other Barcelonan football clubs in lower categories, like CE Europa and UE Sant Andreu. FC Barcelona's basketball team has a noted rivalry in the Liga ACB with nearby Joventut Badalona. Barcelona has three UEFA elite stadiums: FC Barcelona's Camp Nou, the largest stadium in Europe with a capacity of 99,354; the publicly owned Estadi Olímpic Lluís Companys, with a capacity of 55,926; used for the 1992 Olympics; and Estadi Cornellà-El Prat, with a capacity of 40,500. Furthermore, the city has several smaller stadiums such as Mini Estadi (also owned by FC Barcelona) with a capacity of 15,000, Camp Municipal Narcís Sala with a capacity of 6,563 and Nou Sardenya with a capacity of 7,000. The city has a further three multifunctional venues for sports and concerts: the Palau Sant Jordi with a capacity of 12,000 to 24,000 (depending on use), the Palau Blaugrana with a capacity of 7,500, and the Palau dels Esports de Barcelona with a capacity of 3,500. Barcelona was the host city for the 2013 World Aquatics Championships, which were held at the Palau San Jordi.[152] Several road running competitions are organized year-round in Barcelona: the Barcelona Marathon every March with over 10,000 participants in 2010, the Cursa de Bombers in April, the Cursa de El Corte Inglés in May (with about 60,000 participants each year), the Cursa de la Mercè, the Cursa Jean Bouin, the Milla Sagrada Família and the San Silvestre. There is also the Ultratrail Collserola which passes 85 km (53 mi) through the Collserola forest. The Open Seat Godó, a 50-year-old ATP World Tour 500 Series tennis tournament, is held annually in the facilities of the Real Club de Tenis Barcelona. Each year on Christmas Day, a 200-meter swimming race across the Old Port of Barcelona takes place.[153] Near Barcelona, in Montmeló, the 107,000 capacity Circuit de Barcelona-Catalunya racetrack hosts the Formula One Spanish Grand Prix, the Catalan motorcycle Grand Prix, the Spanish GT Championship and races in the GP2 Series. Skateboarding and cycling are also very popular in Barcelona; in and around the city there are dozens of kilometers of bicycle paths.[citation needed] Barcelona is also home to numerous social centres and illegal squats that effectively form a shadow society mainly made up of the unemployed, immigrants, dropouts, anarchists, anti-authoritarians and autonomists.[154] Peter Gelderloos estimates that there around 200 squatted buildings and 40 social centres across the city with thousands of inhabitants, making it one of the largest squatter movements in the world. He notes that they pirate electricity, internet and water allowing them to live on less than one euro a day. He argues that these squats embrace an anarcho-communist and anti-work philosophy, often freely fixing up new houses, cleaning, patching roofs, installing windows, toilets, showers, lights and kitchens. In the wake of austerity, the squats have provided a number of social services to the surrounding residents, including bicycle repair workshops, carpentry workshops, self-defense classes, free libraries, community gardens, free meals, computer labs, language classes, theatre groups, free medical care and legal support services.[155] The squats help elderly residents avoid eviction and organize various protests throughout Barcelona. Notable squats include Can Vies and Can Masdeu.[citation needed] Barcelona is served by Barcelona-El Prat Airport, about 17 km (11 mi) south-west of the centre of Barcelona. It is the second-largest airport in Spain, and the largest on the Mediterranean coast, which handled more than 50.17 million passengers in 2018, showing an annual upward trend.[156] It is a main hub for Vueling Airlines and Ryanair, and also a focus for Iberia and Air Europa. The airport mainly serves domestic and European destinations, although some airlines offer destinations in Latin America, Asia and the United States. The airport is connected to the city by highway, metro (Airport T1 and Airport T2 stations), commuter train (Barcelona Airport railway station) and scheduled bus service. A new terminal (T1) has been built, and entered service on 17 June 2009. Some low-cost airlines, also use Girona-Costa Brava Airport, about 90 km (56 mi) to the north, Reus Airport, 77 km (48 mi) to the south, or Lleida-Alguaire Airport, about 150 km (93 mi) to the west, of the city. Sabadell Airport is a smaller airport in the nearby town of Sabadell, devoted to pilot training, aerotaxi and private flights. The Port of Barcelona has a 2000-year-old history and a great contemporary commercial importance. It is Europe's ninth largest container port, with a trade volume of 1.72 million TEU's in 2013.[157] The port is managed by the Port Authority of Barcelona. Its 10 km2 (4 sq mi) are divided into three zones: Port Vell (the old port), the commercial port and the logistics port (Barcelona Free Port). The port is undergoing an enlargement that will double its size thanks to diverting the mouth of the Llobregat river 2 km (1 mi) to the south.[158] The Barcelona harbour is the leading European cruiser port and a very important Mediterranean turnaround base.[159] In 2013, 3.6 million pleasure cruise passengers used the Port of Barcelona.[157] The Port Vell area also houses the Maremagnum (a commercial mall), a multiplex cinema, the IMAX Port Vell and one of Europe's largest aquariums – Aquarium Barcelona, containing 8,000 fish and 11 sharks contained in 22 basins filled with 4 million litres of sea water. The Maremagnum, being situated within the confines of the port, is the only commercial mall in the city that can open on Sundays and public holidays. Barcelona is a major hub for the Spanish rail network. The city's main Inter-city rail station is Barcelona Sants railway station, whilst Estació de França terminus serves a secondary role handling suburban, regional and medium distance services. Freight services operate to local industries and to the Port of Barcelona. RENFE's AVE high-speed rail system, which is designed for speeds of 310 km/h (193 mph), was extended from Madrid to Barcelona in 2008 in the form of the Madrid–Barcelona high-speed rail line. A shared RENFE-SNCF high-speed rail connecting Barcelona and France (Paris, Marseilles and Toulouse, through Perpignan–Barcelona high-speed rail line) was launched in 2013. Both these lines serve Barcelona Sants terminal station.[160][161] Barcelona is served by an extensive local public transport network that includes a metro system, a bus network, a regional railway system, trams, funiculars, rack railways, a Gondola lift and aerial cable cars. These networks and lines are run by a number of different operators but they are integrated into a coordinated fare system, administered by the Autoritat del Transport Metropolità (ATM). The system is divided into fare zones (1 to 6) and various Integrated Travel Cards are available.[162] The Barcelona Metro network comprises twelve lines, identified by an \"L\" followed by the line number as well as by individual colours. The Metro largely runs underground; eight Metro lines are operated on dedicated track by the Transports Metropolitans de Barcelona (TMB), whilst four lines are operated by the Ferrocarrils de la Generalitat de Catalunya (FGC) and some of them share tracks with RENFE commuter lines. In addition to the city Metro, several regional rail lines operated by RENFE's Rodalies de Catalunya run across the city, providing connections to outlying towns in the surrounding region. The city's two modern tram systems, Trambaix and Trambesòs, are operated by TRAMMET.[163] A heritage tram line, the Tramvia Blau, also operates between the metro Line 7 and the Funicular del Tibidabo.[164] Barcelona's metro and rail system is supplemented by several aerial cable cars, funiculars and rack railways that provide connections to mountain-top stations. FGC operates the Funicular de Tibidabo up the hill of Tibidabo and the Funicular de Vallvidrera (FGC), while TMB runs the Funicular de Montjuïc up Montjuïc. The city has two aerial cable cars: the Montjuïc Cable Car, which serves Montjuïc castle, and the Port Vell Aerial Tramway that runs via Torre Jaume I and Torre Sant Sebastià over the port. Buses in Barcelona are a major form of public transport, with extensive local, interurban and night bus networks. Most local services are operated by the TMB, although some other services are operated by a number of private companies, albeit still within the ATM fare structure. There are 21 night lines, 19 of them go through Plaça de Catalunya, where you can change to other lines. The frequency is 15/20 minutes between 22:20 and 06:00. A separate private bus line, known as Aerobús, links the airport with the city centre, with its own fare structure. The Estació del Nord (Northern Station), a former railway station which was renovated for the 1992 Olympic Games, now serves as the terminus for long-distance and regional bus services. Barcelona has a metered taxi fleet governed by the Institut Metropolità del Taxi (Metropolitan Taxi Institute), composed of more than 10,000 cars. Most of the licences are in the hands of self-employed drivers. With their black and yellow livery, Barcelona's taxis are easily spotted, and can be caught from one of many taxi ranks, hailed on street, called by telephone or via app.[165][166] On 22 March 2007,[167] Barcelona's City Council started the Bicing service, a bicycle service understood as a public transport. Once the user has their user card, they can take a bicycle from any of the more than 400 stations spread around the city and use it anywhere the urban area of the city, and then leave it at another station.[168] The service has been a success, with 50,000 subscribed users in three months.[169] Barcelona lies on three international routes, including European route E15 that follows the Mediterranean coast, European route E90 to Madrid and Lisbon, and European route E09 to Paris. It is also served by a comprehensive network of motorways and highways throughout the metropolitan area, including A-2, A-7/AP-7, C-16, C-17, C-31, C-32, C-33, C-60. The city is circled by three half ring roads or bypasses, Ronda de Dalt (B-20) (on the mountain side), Ronda del Litoral (B-10) (along the coast) and Ronda del Mig (separated into two parts: Travessera de Dalt in the north and the Gran Via de Carles III), two partially covered[170] fast highways with several exits that bypass the city. The city's main arteries include Diagonal Avenue, which crosses it diagonally, Meridiana Avenue which leads to Glòries and connects with Diagonal Avenue and Gran Via de les Corts Catalanes, which crosses the city from east to west, passing through its centre. The famous boulevard of La Rambla, whilst no longer an important vehicular route, remains an important pedestrian route. The Barri Gòtic (Catalan for \"Gothic Quarter\") is the centre of the old city of Barcelona. Many of the buildings date from medieval times, some from as far back as the Roman settlement of Barcelona. Catalan modernista architecture (related to the movement known as Art Nouveau in the rest of Europe) developed between 1885 and 1950 and left an important legacy in Barcelona. Several of these buildings are World Heritage Sites. Especially remarkable is the work of architect Antoni Gaudí, which can be seen throughout the city. His best-known work is the immense but still unfinished church of the Sagrada Família, which has been under construction since 1882 and is still financed by private donations. As of 2015[update], completion is planned for 2026.[171] Barcelona was also home to Mies van der Rohe's Barcelona Pavilion. Designed in 1929 for the International Exposition for Germany, it was an iconic building that came to symbolize modern architecture as the embodiment of van der Rohe's aphorisms \"less is more\" and \"God is in the details\".[172] The Barcelona pavilion was intended as a temporary structure and was torn down in 1930 less than a year after it was constructed. A modern re-creation by Spanish architects now stands in Barcelona, however, constructed in 1986. Barcelona won the 1999 RIBA Royal Gold Medal for its architecture,[173] the first (and as of 2015[update], only) time that the winner has been a city rather than an individual architect. Barcelona is the home of many points of interest declared World Heritage Sites by UNESCO:[174] Barcelona has a great number of museums, which cover different areas and eras. The National Museum of Art of Catalonia possesses a well-known collection of Romanesque art, while the Barcelona Museum of Contemporary Art focuses on post-1945 Catalan and Spanish art. The Fundació Joan Miró, Picasso Museum, and Fundació Antoni Tàpies hold important collections of these world-renowned artists, as well as the Can Framis Museum, focused on post-1960 Catalan Art owned by Fundació Vila Casas. Several museums cover the fields of history and archaeology, like the Barcelona City History Museum (MUHBA), the Museum of the History of Catalonia, the Archeology Museum of Catalonia, the Maritime Museum of Barcelona, the Music Museum of Barcelona and the privately owned Egyptian Museum. The Erotic museum of Barcelona is among the most peculiar ones, while CosmoCaixa is a science museum that received the European Museum of the Year Award in 2006.[175] The Museum of Natural Sciences of Barcelona was founded in 1882 under the name of \"Museo Martorell de Arqueología y Ciencias Naturales\"[176][177] (Spanish for \"Martorell Museum of Archaeology and Natural Sciences\"). In 2011 the Museum of Natural Sciences ended up with a merge of five institutions: the Museum of Natural Sciences of Barcelona (the main site, at the Forum Building), the Martorell Museum (the historical seat of the Museum, opened to the public from 1924 to 2010 as a geology museum), the Laboratori de Natura, at the Castle of the Three Dragons (from 1920 to 2010: the Zoology Museum), the Historical Botanical Garden of Barcelona, founded 1930, and the Botanical garden of Barcelona, founded 1999. Those two gardens are a part of the Botanical Institute of Barcelona too. The FC Barcelona Museum is the third most popular tourist attraction in Catalonia, with 1,51 million visitors in 2013.[178] Barcelona contains sixty municipal parks, twelve of which are historic, five of which are thematic (botanical), forty-five of which are urban, and six of which are forest.[179] They range from vest-pocket parks to large recreation areas. The urban parks alone cover 10% of the city (549.7 ha or 1,358.3 acres).[74] The total park surface grows about 10 ha (25 acres) per year,[180] with a proportion of 18.1 m2 (195 sq ft) of park area per inhabitant.[181] Of Barcelona's parks, Montjuïc is the largest, with 203 ha located on the mountain of the same name, and includes the Botanical Garden of Barcelona, the Mossèn Costa i Llobera Gardens, and more.[74] It is followed by Parc de la Ciutadella (which occupies the site of the old citadel and which houses the Parliament building, the Barcelona Zoo, and several museums); 31 ha or 76.6 acres including the zoo), the Guinardó Park (19 ha or 47.0 acres), Park Güell (designed by Antoni Gaudí; 17.2 ha or 42.5 acres), Oreneta Castle Park (also 17.2 ha or 42.5 acres), Diagonal Mar Park (13.3 ha or 32.9 acres, inaugurated in 2002), Nou Barris Central Park (13.2 ha or 32.6 acres), Can Dragó Sports Park and Poblenou Park (both 11.9 ha or 29.4 acres), the Labyrinth Park (9.10 ha or 22.5 acres), named after the garden maze it contains.[74] There are also several smaller parks, for example, the Parc de Les Aigües (2 ha or 4.9 acres). A part of the Collserola Park is also within the city limits. PortAventura World, one of the largest resort in Europe, with 5,837,509 visitors per year, is located one hour's drive from Barcelona.[182][183] Also, within the city lies Tibidabo Amusement Park, a smaller amusement park in Plaza del Tibidabo, with the Muntanya Russa amusement ride. Barcelona beach was listed as number one in a list of the top ten city beaches in the world according to National Geographic[116] and Discovery Channel.[184] Barcelona contains seven beaches, totalling 4.5 km (2+3⁄4 mi) of coastline. Sant Sebastià, Barceloneta and Somorrostro beaches, both 1,100 m (3,610 ft) in length,[74] are the largest, oldest and the most-frequented beaches in Barcelona. The Olympic Harbour separates them from the other city beaches: Nova Icària, Bogatell, Mar Bella, Nova Mar Bella and Llevant. These beaches (ranging from 400 to 640 m (1,310 to 2,100 ft) were opened as a result of the city restructuring to host the 1992 Summer Olympics, when a great number of industrial buildings were demolished. At present, the beach sand is artificially replenished given that storms regularly remove large quantities of material. The 2004 Universal Forum of Cultures left the city a large concrete bathing zone on the eastmost part of the city's coastline. Most recently, Llevant is the first beach to allow dogs access during summer season. Barcelona is twinned with:[185] Barcelona also cooperates with:[185]",

Barcelona, city, seaport, and capital of Barcelona provincia (province) and of Catalonia comunidad autónoma (autonomous community), northeastern Spain, located 90 miles (150 km) south of the French border. It is Spain’s major Mediterranean port and commercial centre and is famed for its individuality, cultural interest, and physical beauty. On his visit to the city in 1862, Hans Christian Andersen remarked that Barcelona was the “Paris of Spain.” The city is indeed a major cultural centre with a remarkable history. It abounds with archives, libraries, museums, and buildings of interest, featuring superb examples of Modernist and Art Nouveau decor and architecture. Since the late 1970s, with the official recognition of the Catalan language and the granting of significant levels of regional self-government, cultural life has been revitalized, bringing with it a new awareness of the depth and variety of Catalan culture. This vitality combines with the striking physical setting of Barcelona—between scenic mountains and the Mediterranean Sea, with a benign climate that fosters street life—and its significance as an economic power and a major port to create a city of infinite variety. Area city, 38 square miles (98 square km); metropolitan area, 1,249 square miles (3,235 square km). Pop. (2011) 1,611,013; (2018 est.) 1,620,343. Barcelona, facing the Mediterranean to the southeast, is located on a plain generally confined by the Besós River (north), the Llobregat River (south), the rocky outcrop of Montjuich (567 feet [173 metres] high), and the semicircle of mountains of which Tibidabo (1,680 feet [512 metres]) is the highest point. Throughout its past Barcelona has had to contend with the consequences of its strategic location and political significance. The city was heavily fortified and did not spread much beyond its medieval confines until the 19th century, a factor that contributed to the emergence of industrial satellite suburbs and towns around the city proper. This combination of a concentrated core with a highly developed industrial belt has made Barcelona one of the most congested cities in the world. Although Barcelona is sometimes windy, its protective semicircle of mountains shields it from the harsh, cold winds that blow out of the north and west. The average annual temperature is 61 °F (16 °C); January is the coldest month, averaging 49 °F (9 °C), and August is the hottest, at 76 °F (24 °C). Precipitation amounts to about 23 inches (600 mm) per year. At the core of the city lies the Gothic Quarter. Located between the Ramblas, a series of connected boulevards, going southeastward to the sea, and the Via Laietana, it is a close-packed maze of narrow streets punctuated by magnificent medieval buildings. The cathedral, episcopal palace, and churches bear witness to Barcelona’s importance as a religious centre. The government buildings—such as the Palace of the Generalitat (the seat of the autonomous community of Catalonia), a 14th–15th-century building with Baroque and Neoclassical facades, and the Royal Palace—attest to the city’s importance as an administrative capital. The Roman walls survive in places largely because stretches of them were incorporated into the medieval city, and the wall built in the 13th century along the Ramblas effectively hemmed it in. The defenses that played such a large part in the battle for Barcelona during the War of the Spanish Succession (1701–14) were augmented by the construction of a citadel after the city was taken. By the mid-19th century the need for elaborate defenses had passed, and the city was bursting at the seams. Accordingly, plans were devised to extend the city. The final plans were based on geometric blocks, allowing for open spaces, greenery, and social areas. The area into which the town expanded, now called L’Eixample (“the Extension”), was open land left originally to give a clear field of fire from the city walls. Unfortunately, the plans were not carried out completely, and within 30 years the open areas were exploited, causing the density of buildings to triple. The city expanded following the annexing of the old municipalities surrounding Barcelona. Urban sprawl and uncontrolled development during the Francisco Franco era added to the congestion. The 1992 Olympic Games allowed for some renovation of deteriorated and poorly planned areas. For the visitor, the main attraction still tends to be in the city centre, particularly around the Ramblas. The famous promenade is separated from L’Eixample by the monumental Catalunya Square, and it leads down to the port and the Portal de la Pau Square, where the Christopher Columbus monument stands in commemoration of the discovery of America and the explorer’s announcement of it in Barcelona. The Ramblas form one of the most delightful aspects of the city, their broad, tree-lined centre strips given over to a series of stalls and kiosks selling items such as flowers, pets, and books and newspapers. The skyline of the modern city inevitably reflects the style of the present age, but Barcelona has always attracted distinguished and original architects. Some people find the more modern buildings along the Diagonal quite striking, but little of it can compare to the work of the Catalan sculptor and architect Antoni Gaudí, whose huge and elaborate Expiatory Temple of the Holy Family (Sagrada Família) has become a symbol of the city itself. He made a number of other notable contributions, including the multistory apartment buildings Casa Batlló, Casa Milá (La Pedrera), and Güell Park, and the works of Gaudí were designated as a UNESCO World Heritage site in 1984. Other architects, such as Luis Doménechi Montaner, produced remarkable structures in the modernist style, such as the Music Palace, which was designated a UNESCO World Heritage site in 1997.",

                "title": "Homeland Security shares new details of mysterious drone flights over New Jersey",
                "content": "Manage your account The large mysterious drones reported flying over parts of New Jersey in recent weeks appear to avoid detection by traditional methods such as helicopter and radio, according to a state lawmaker briefed Wednesday by the Department of Homeland Security. In a post on the social media platform X, Assemblywoman Dawn Fantasia described the drones as up to 6 feet in diameter and sometimes traveling with their lights switched off. The Morris County Republican was among several state and local lawmakers who met with state police and Homeland Security officials to discuss the spate of sightings that range from the New York City area through New Jersey and westward into parts of Pennsylvania, including over Philadelphia. The devices do not appear to be being flown by hobbyists, Fantasia wrote. See for yourself — The Yodel is the go-to source for daily news, entertainment and feel-good stories. By signing up, you agree to our Terms and Privacy Policy. Dozens of mysterious nighttime flights started last month and have raised growing concern among residents and officials. Part of the worry stems from the flying objects initially being spotted near the Picatinny Arsenal, a U.S. military research and manufacturing facility; and over President-elect Donald Trump’s golf course in Bedminster. Drones are legal in New Jersey for recreational and commercial use, but they are subject to local and Federal Aviation Administration regulations and flight restrictions. Operators must be FAA certified. Most, but not all, of the drones spotted in New Jersey were larger than those typically used by hobbyists. The number of sightings has increased in recent days, though officials say many of the objects seen may have been planes rather than drones. It’s also possible that a single drone has been reported more than once. Gov. Phil Murphy and law enforcement officials have stressed that the drones don’t appear to threaten public safety. The FBI has been investigating and has asked residents to share any videos, photos or other information they may have. Two Republican Jersey Shore-area congressmen, U.S. Reps. Chris Smith and Jeff Van Drew, have called on the military to shoot down the drones. Smith said a Coast Guard commanding officer briefed him on an incident over the weekend in which a dozen drones followed a motorized Coast Guard lifeboat “in close pursuit” near Barnegat Light and Island Beach State Park in Ocean County. Coast Guard Lt. Luke Pinneo told The Associated Press Wednesday “that multiple low-altitude aircraft were observed in vicinity of one of our vessels near Island Beach State Park.” The aircraft weren't perceived as an immediate threat and didn't disrupt operations, Pinneo said. The Coast Guard is assisting the FBI and state agencies in investigating. In a letter to U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin, Smith called for military help dealing with the drones, noting that Joint Base McGuire-Dix-Lakehurst has the capability \"to identify and take down unauthorized unmanned aerial systems.” However, Pentagon spokeswoman Sabrina Singh told reporters Wednesday that “our initial assessment here is that these are not drones or activities coming from a foreign entity or adversary.” Many municipal lawmakers have called for more restrictions on who is entitled to fly the unmanned devices. At least one state lawmaker proposed a temporary ban on drone flights in the state. “This is something we’re taking deadly seriously. I don’t blame people for being frustrated,\" Murphy said earlier this week. A spokesman for the Democratic governor said he did not attend Wednesday's meeting. Republican Assemblyman Erik Peterson, whose district includes parts of the state where the drones have been reported, said he also attended Wednesday's meeting at a state police facility in West Trenton. The session lasted for about 90 minutes. Peterson said DHS officials were generous with their time, but appeared dismissive of some concerns, saying not all the sightings reported have been confirmed to involve drones. So who or what is behind the flying objects? Where are they coming from? What are they doing? “My understanding is they have no clue,” Peterson said. A message seeking comment was left with the Department of Homeland Security. Most of the drones have been spotted along coastal areas and some were recently reported flying over a large reservoir in Clinton. Sightings also have been reported in neighboring states. James Edwards, of Succasunna, New Jersey, said he has seen a few drones flying over his neighborhood since last month. “It raises concern mainly because there's so much that's unknown,” Edwards said Wednesday. “There are lots of people spouting off about various conspiracies that they believe are in play here, but that only adds fuel to the fire unnecessarily. We need to wait and see what is really happening here, not let fear of the unknown overtake us.\" —— AP reporters Mike Catalini in Morrisville, Pennsylvania; and Wayne Parry in Point Pleasant, New Jersey, contributed to this report.",

                "title": "Mystery drones flying over New Jersey have residents and officials puzzled : NPR",
                "content": "By Jason Breslow Residents across New Jersey have been trying to decipher who has been flying mysterious unidentified drones over the state, with some taking to Facebook to share videos of sightings. Above, a screengrab from video of a potential sighting shared on Facebook. Scott Ingenito/Screenshot by NPR hide caption There is something strange happening in the skies above New Jersey, and no one seems quite sure what to make of it — not the governor, not members of Congress, not the FBI. What they know is that starting in mid-November, dozens of identified drones have been spotted at night flying in at least 10 different counties across the state. What they don't know is where the drones are coming from, who's flying them and why. The drones have been spotted above critical infrastructure, according to authorities, including reservoirs, electric transmission lines, rail stations, police departments and military installations. A U.S. Army base in northern Morris County has already had at least 11 sightings, Army officials said this week, several of which came even after the Federal Aviation Administration moved to temporarily restrict drones from flying overhead. In neighboring Somerset County, the FAA has also banned drones from flying over the golf course owned by President-elect Donald Trump. It's not illegal to fly a drone in New Jersey, so long as the operator is certified with the FAA. Small unregistered drones being used for recreation can be flown in unrestricted areas. But the number and mysterious nature of the sightings have left many Garden State residents on edge. So too has their size, as many of the drones appear to be larger than those that are typically used by hobbyists. The office of New Jersey Gov. Phil Murphy did not respond to a request for comment, but speaking at an unrelated bill signing earlier this week, Murphy said there had been 49 sightings on Sunday alone — though several of those may have been duplicates or merely possible sightings. In a posting on social media last week, Murphy said state officials were \"actively monitoring the situation and in close coordination with our federal and law enforcement partners.\" \"There is no known threat to the public at this time,\" Murphy said. Murphy's assurances have done little to quiet the concerns of residents and other officials across the state. In a statement posted to Facebook last week, the police chief of Florham Park, N.J., said \"their presence appears nefarious in nature.\" And during a House hearing on Monday focused on unmanned aerial systems, N.J. Rep. Chris Smith, a Republican, said he thought the drones were a \"very serious threat.\" Given the alarm the drones have caused, Sen. Cory Booker, D-N.J., said in a statement Monday that he was calling for more transparency from federal officials. \"There is a growing sense of uncertainty and urgency across the state — from constituents and local officials alike — despite assurances that the drones pose no known threats to public safety,\" Booker wrote in a letter to leaders at the FBI, and the Departments of Transportation and Homeland Security. \"As such, I urge you to share any relevant information about these drone sightings with the public. Without transparency, I believe that rumors, fear, and misinformation will continue to spread,\" he added. So far at least one theory has been ruled out — that the drones were coming from the Picatinny Arsenal military research base in Morris County. In a statement obtained by the Morristown Daily Record on Monday, base commander Lt. Col. Craig Bonham II said the drones were not theirs. \"While the source and cause of these aircraft operating in our area remain unknown, we can confirm that they are not the result of any Picatinny Arsenal-related activities,\" Bonham said. The FBI has opened an investigation, but bureau officials say key questions remain unresolved. Speaking to House lawmakers Monday, Robert Wheeler, the assistant director for the bureau's critical incident response group, said the FBI still did not know whether a specific individual was responsible for the flights or whether they were the work of a larger group. Wheeler also could not definitively rule out the possibility that the drones may pose a risk to public safety or national security. \"There's nothing that is known that would lead me to say that, but we just don't know, and that's the concerning part,\" Wheeler said. In a statement, the FBI said it \"remains engaged with our federal, state, local, and tribal partners to share information and protect the public.\" It added that any drones \"that pose a danger to any aircraft or are observed operating in restricted airspace or near critical infrastructure and other sensitive sites, can be reported to the FBI at 1-800-CALL-FBI (1-800-225-5324) or online at tips.fbi.gov.\" Unidentified drones have puzzled the public before. Earlier this year, the Wall Street Journal reported about unidentified drones swarming Langley Air Force Base in Virginia for 17 days. As with the drones over New Jersey, those flights called to memory the Chinese spy balloon that the U.S. military shot down over the coast of South Carolina in 2023. The flights over New Jersey have led to calls for the military to shoot down the unidentified drones, but under federal law the military is largely prohibited from doing so unless the drone poses an imminent threat. It is also illegal for individuals to shoot down any aircraft — including drones. Sponsor Message Become an NPR sponsor",

                "title": "Artificial intelligence - Wikipedia",
                "content": "Artificial intelligence (AI), in its broadest sense, is intelligence exhibited by machines, particularly computer systems. It is a field of research in computer science that develops and studies methods and software that enable machines to perceive their environment and use learning and intelligence to take actions that maximize their chances of achieving defined goals.[1] Such machines may be called AIs. Some high-profile applications of AI include advanced web search engines (e.g., Google Search); recommendation systems (used by YouTube, Amazon, and Netflix); interacting via human speech (e.g., Google Assistant, Siri, and Alexa); autonomous vehicles (e.g., Waymo); generative and creative tools (e.g., ChatGPT, and AI art); and superhuman play and analysis in strategy games (e.g., chess and Go). However, many AI applications are not perceived as AI: \"A lot of cutting edge AI has filtered into general applications, often without being called AI because once something becomes useful enough and common enough it's not labeled AI anymore.\"[2][3] The various subfields of AI research are centered around particular goals and the use of particular tools. The traditional goals of AI research include reasoning, knowledge representation, planning, learning, natural language processing, perception, and support for robotics.[a] General intelligence—the ability to complete any task performed by a human on an at least equal level—is among the field's long-term goals.[4] To reach these goals, AI researchers have adapted and integrated a wide range of techniques, including search and mathematical optimization, formal logic, artificial neural networks, and methods based on statistics, operations research, and economics.[b] AI also draws upon psychology, linguistics, philosophy, neuroscience, and other fields.[5] Artificial intelligence was founded as an academic discipline in 1956,[6] and the field went through multiple cycles of optimism,[7][8] followed by periods of disappointment and loss of funding, known as AI winter.[9][10] Funding and interest vastly increased after 2012 when deep learning outperformed previous AI techniques.[11] This growth accelerated further after 2017 with the transformer architecture,[12] and by the early 2020s hundreds of billions of dollars were being invested in AI (known as the \"AI boom\"). The widespread use of AI in the 21st century exposed several unintended consequences and harms in the present and raised concerns about its risks and long-term effects in the future, prompting discussions about regulatory policies to ensure the safety and benefits of the technology. The general problem of simulating (or creating) intelligence has been broken into subproblems. These consist of particular traits or capabilities that researchers expect an intelligent system to display. The traits described below have received the most attention and cover the scope of AI research.[a] Early researchers developed algorithms that imitated step-by-step reasoning that humans use when they solve puzzles or make logical deductions.[13] By the late 1980s and 1990s, methods were developed for dealing with uncertain or incomplete information, employing concepts from probability and economics.[14] Many of these algorithms are insufficient for solving large reasoning problems because they experience a \"combinatorial explosion\": They become exponentially slower as the problems grow.[15] Even humans rarely use the step-by-step deduction that early AI research could model. They solve most of their problems using fast, intuitive judgments.[16] Accurate and efficient reasoning is an unsolved problem. Knowledge representation and knowledge engineering[17] allow AI programs to answer questions intelligently and make deductions about real-world facts. Formal knowledge representations are used in content-based indexing and retrieval,[18] scene interpretation,[19] clinical decision support,[20] knowledge discovery (mining \"interesting\" and actionable inferences from large databases),[21] and other areas.[22] A knowledge base is a body of knowledge represented in a form that can be used by a program. An ontology is the set of objects, relations, concepts, and properties used by a particular domain of knowledge.[23] Knowledge bases need to represent things such as objects, properties, categories, and relations between objects;[24] situations, events, states, and time;[25] causes and effects;[26] knowledge about knowledge (what we know about what other people know);[27] default reasoning (things that humans assume are true until they are told differently and will remain true even when other facts are changing);[28] and many other aspects and domains of knowledge. Among the most difficult problems in knowledge representation are the breadth of commonsense knowledge (the set of atomic facts that the average person knows is enormous);[29] and the sub-symbolic form of most commonsense knowledge (much of what people know is not represented as \"facts\" or \"statements\" that they could express verbally).[16] There is also the difficulty of knowledge acquisition, the problem of obtaining knowledge for AI applications.[c] An \"agent\" is anything that perceives and takes actions in the world. A rational agent has goals or preferences and takes actions to make them happen.[d][32] In automated planning, the agent has a specific goal.[33] In automated decision-making, the agent has preferences—there are some situations it would prefer to be in, and some situations it is trying to avoid. The decision-making agent assigns a number to each situation (called the \"utility\") that measures how much the agent prefers it. For each possible action, it can calculate the \"expected utility\": the utility of all possible outcomes of the action, weighted by the probability that the outcome will occur. It can then choose the action with the maximum expected utility.[34] In classical planning, the agent knows exactly what the effect of any action will be.[35] In most real-world problems, however, the agent may not be certain about the situation they are in (it is \"unknown\" or \"unobservable\") and it may not know for certain what will happen after each possible action (it is not \"deterministic\"). It must choose an action by making a probabilistic guess and then reassess the situation to see if the action worked.[36] In some problems, the agent's preferences may be uncertain, especially if there are other agents or humans involved. These can be learned (e.g., with inverse reinforcement learning), or the agent can seek information to improve its preferences.[37] Information value theory can be used to weigh the value of exploratory or experimental actions.[38] The space of possible future actions and situations is typically intractably large, so the agents must take actions and evaluate situations while being uncertain of what the outcome will be. A Markov decision process has a transition model that describes the probability that a particular action will change the state in a particular way and a reward function that supplies the utility of each state and the cost of each action. A policy associates a decision with each possible state. The policy could be calculated (e.g., by iteration), be heuristic, or it can be learned.[39] Game theory describes the rational behavior of multiple interacting agents and is used in AI programs that make decisions that involve other agents.[40] Machine learning is the study of programs that can improve their performance on a given task automatically.[41] It has been a part of AI from the beginning.[e] There are several kinds of machine learning. Unsupervised learning analyzes a stream of data and finds patterns and makes predictions without any other guidance.[44] Supervised learning requires labeling the training data with the expected answers, and comes in two main varieties: classification (where the program must learn to predict what category the input belongs in) and regression (where the program must deduce a numeric function based on numeric input).[45] In reinforcement learning, the agent is rewarded for good responses and punished for bad ones. The agent learns to choose responses that are classified as \"good\".[46] Transfer learning is when the knowledge gained from one problem is applied to a new problem.[47] Deep learning is a type of machine learning that runs inputs through biologically inspired artificial neural networks for all of these types of learning.[48] Computational learning theory can assess learners by computational complexity, by sample complexity (how much data is required), or by other notions of optimization.[49] Natural language processing (NLP)[50] allows programs to read, write and communicate in human languages such as English. Specific problems include speech recognition, speech synthesis, machine translation, information extraction, information retrieval and question answering.[51] Early work, based on Noam Chomsky's generative grammar and semantic networks, had difficulty with word-sense disambiguation[f] unless restricted to small domains called \"micro-worlds\" (due to the common sense knowledge problem[29]). Margaret Masterman believed that it was meaning and not grammar that was the key to understanding languages, and that thesauri and not dictionaries should be the basis of computational language structure. Modern deep learning techniques for NLP include word embedding (representing words, typically as vectors encoding their meaning),[52] transformers (a deep learning architecture using an attention mechanism),[53] and others.[54] In 2019, generative pre-trained transformer (or \"GPT\") language models began to generate coherent text,[55][56] and by 2023, these models were able to get human-level scores on the bar exam, SAT test, GRE test, and many other real-world applications.[57] Machine perception is the ability to use input from sensors (such as cameras, microphones, wireless signals, active lidar, sonar, radar, and tactile sensors) to deduce aspects of the world. Computer vision is the ability to analyze visual input.[58] The field includes speech recognition,[59] image classification,[60] facial recognition, object recognition,[61]object tracking,[62] and robotic perception.[63] Affective computing is an interdisciplinary umbrella that comprises systems that recognize, interpret, process, or simulate human feeling, emotion, and mood.[65] For example, some virtual assistants are programmed to speak conversationally or even to banter humorously; it makes them appear more sensitive to the emotional dynamics of human interaction, or to otherwise facilitate human–computer interaction. However, this tends to give naïve users an unrealistic conception of the intelligence of existing computer agents.[66] Moderate successes related to affective computing include textual sentiment analysis and, more recently, multimodal sentiment analysis, wherein AI classifies the effects displayed by a videotaped subject.[67] A machine with artificial general intelligence should be able to solve a wide variety of problems with breadth and versatility similar to human intelligence.[4] AI research uses a wide variety of techniques to accomplish the goals above.[b] AI can solve many problems by intelligently searching through many possible solutions.[68] There are two very different kinds of search used in AI: state space search and local search. State space search searches through a tree of possible states to try to find a goal state.[69] For example, planning algorithms search through trees of goals and subgoals, attempting to find a path to a target goal, a process called means-ends analysis.[70] Simple exhaustive searches[71] are rarely sufficient for most real-world problems: the search space (the number of places to search) quickly grows to astronomical numbers. The result is a search that is too slow or never completes.[15] \"Heuristics\" or \"rules of thumb\" can help prioritize choices that are more likely to reach a goal.[72] Adversarial search is used for game-playing programs, such as chess or Go. It searches through a tree of possible moves and countermoves, looking for a winning position.[73] Local search uses mathematical optimization to find a solution to a problem. It begins with some form of guess and refines it incrementally.[74] Gradient descent is a type of local search that optimizes a set of numerical parameters by incrementally adjusting them to minimize a loss function. Variants of gradient descent are commonly used to train neural networks.[75] Another type of local search is evolutionary computation, which aims to iteratively improve a set of candidate solutions by \"mutating\" and \"recombining\" them, selecting only the fittest to survive each generation.[76] Distributed search processes can coordinate via swarm intelligence algorithms. Two popular swarm algorithms used in search are particle swarm optimization (inspired by bird flocking) and ant colony optimization (inspired by ant trails).[77] Formal logic is used for reasoning and knowledge representation.[78] Formal logic comes in two main forms: propositional logic (which operates on statements that are true or false and uses logical connectives such as \"and\", \"or\", \"not\" and \"implies\")[79] and predicate logic (which also operates on objects, predicates and relations and uses quantifiers such as \"Every X is a Y\" and \"There are some Xs that are Ys\").[80] Deductive reasoning in logic is the process of proving a new statement (conclusion) from other statements that are given and assumed to be true (the premises).[81] Proofs can be structured as proof trees, in which nodes are labelled by sentences, and children nodes are connected to parent nodes by inference rules. Given a problem and a set of premises, problem-solving reduces to searching for a proof tree whose root node is labelled by a solution of the problem and whose leaf nodes are labelled by premises or axioms. In the case of Horn clauses, problem-solving search can be performed by reasoning forwards from the premises or backwards from the problem.[82] In the more general case of the clausal form of first-order logic, resolution is a single, axiom-free rule of inference, in which a problem is solved by proving a contradiction from premises that include the negation of the problem to be solved.[83] Inference in both Horn clause logic and first-order logic is undecidable, and therefore intractable. However, backward reasoning with Horn clauses, which underpins computation in the logic programming language Prolog, is Turing complete. Moreover, its efficiency is competitive with computation in other symbolic programming languages.[84] Fuzzy logic assigns a \"degree of truth\" between 0 and 1. It can therefore handle propositions that are vague and partially true.[85] Non-monotonic logics, including logic programming with negation as failure, are designed to handle default reasoning.[28] Other specialized versions of logic have been developed to describe many complex domains. Many problems in AI (including in reasoning, planning, learning, perception, and robotics) require the agent to operate with incomplete or uncertain information. AI researchers have devised a number of tools to solve these problems using methods from probability theory and economics.[86] Precise mathematical tools have been developed that analyze how an agent can make choices and plan, using decision theory, decision analysis,[87] and information value theory.[88] These tools include models such as Markov decision processes,[89] dynamic decision networks,[90] game theory and mechanism design.[91] Bayesian networks[92] are a tool that can be used for reasoning (using the Bayesian inference algorithm),[g][94] learning (using the expectation–maximization algorithm),[h][96] planning (using decision networks)[97] and perception (using dynamic Bayesian networks).[90] Probabilistic algorithms can also be used for filtering, prediction, smoothing, and finding explanations for streams of data, thus helping perception systems analyze processes that occur over time (e.g., hidden Markov models or Kalman filters).[90] The simplest AI applications can be divided into two types: classifiers (e.g., \"if shiny then diamond\"), on one hand, and controllers (e.g., \"if diamond then pick up\"), on the other hand. Classifiers[98] are functions that use pattern matching to determine the closest match. They can be fine-tuned based on chosen examples using supervised learning. Each pattern (also called an \"observation\") is labeled with a certain predefined class. All the observations combined with their class labels are known as a data set. When a new observation is received, that observation is classified based on previous experience.[45] There are many kinds of classifiers in use.[99] The decision tree is the simplest and most widely used symbolic machine learning algorithm.[100] K-nearest neighbor algorithm was the most widely used analogical AI until the mid-1990s, and Kernel methods such as the support vector machine (SVM) displaced k-nearest neighbor in the 1990s.[101] The naive Bayes classifier is reportedly the \"most widely used learner\"[102] at Google, due in part to its scalability.[103] Neural networks are also used as classifiers.[104] An artificial neural network is based on a collection of nodes also known as artificial neurons, which loosely model the neurons in a biological brain. It is trained to recognise patterns; once trained, it can recognise those patterns in fresh data. There is an input, at least one hidden layer of nodes and an output. Each node applies a function and once the weight crosses its specified threshold, the data is transmitted to the next layer. A network is typically called a deep neural network if it has at least 2 hidden layers.[104] Learning algorithms for neural networks use local search to choose the weights that will get the right output for each input during training. The most common training technique is the backpropagation algorithm.[105] Neural networks learn to model complex relationships between inputs and outputs and find patterns in data. In theory, a neural network can learn any function.[106] In feedforward neural networks the signal passes in only one direction.[107] Recurrent neural networks feed the output signal back into the input, which allows short-term memories of previous input events. Long short term memory is the most successful network architecture for recurrent networks.[108] Perceptrons[109] use only a single layer of neurons; deep learning[110] uses multiple layers. Convolutional neural networks strengthen the connection between neurons that are \"close\" to each other—this is especially important in image processing, where a local set of neurons must identify an \"edge\" before the network can identify an object.[111] Deep learning[110] uses several layers of neurons between the network's inputs and outputs. The multiple layers can progressively extract higher-level features from the raw input. For example, in image processing, lower layers may identify edges, while higher layers may identify the concepts relevant to a human such as digits, letters, or faces.[112] Deep learning has profoundly improved the performance of programs in many important subfields of artificial intelligence, including computer vision, speech recognition, natural language processing, image classification,[113] and others. The reason that deep learning performs so well in so many applications is not known as of 2023.[114] The sudden success of deep learning in 2012–2015 did not occur because of some new discovery or theoretical breakthrough (deep neural networks and backpropagation had been described by many people, as far back as the 1950s)[i] but because of two factors: the incredible increase in computer power (including the hundred-fold increase in speed by switching to GPUs) and the availability of vast amounts of training data, especially the giant curated datasets used for benchmark testing, such as ImageNet.[j] Generative pre-trained transformers (GPT) are large language models (LLMs) that generate text based on the semantic relationships between words in sentences. Text-based GPT models are pretrained on a large corpus of text that can be from the Internet. The pretraining consists of predicting the next token (a token being usually a word, subword, or punctuation). Throughout this pretraining, GPT models accumulate knowledge about the world and can then generate human-like text by repeatedly predicting the next token. Typically, a subsequent training phase makes the model more truthful, useful, and harmless, usually with a technique called reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF). Current GPT models are prone to generating falsehoods called \"hallucinations\", although this can be reduced with RLHF and quality data. They are used in chatbots, which allow people to ask a question or request a task in simple text.[122][123] Current models and services include Gemini (formerly Bard), ChatGPT, Grok, Claude, Copilot, and LLaMA.[124] Multimodal GPT models can process different types of data (modalities) such as images, videos, sound, and text.[125] In the late 2010s, graphics processing units (GPUs) that were increasingly designed with AI-specific enhancements and used with specialized TensorFlow software had replaced previously used central processing unit (CPUs) as the dominant means for large-scale (commercial and academic) machine learning models' training.[126] Specialized programming languages such as Prolog were used in early AI research,[127] but general-purpose programming languages like Python have become predominant.[128] The transistor density in integrated circuits has been observed to roughly double every 18 months—a trend known as Moore's law, named after the Intel co-founder Gordon Moore, who first identified it. Improvements in GPUs have been even faster.[129] AI and machine learning technology is used in most of the essential applications of the 2020s, including: search engines (such as Google Search), targeting online advertisements, recommendation systems (offered by Netflix, YouTube or Amazon), driving internet traffic, targeted advertising (AdSense, Facebook), virtual assistants (such as Siri or Alexa), autonomous vehicles (including drones, ADAS and self-driving cars), automatic language translation (Microsoft Translator, Google Translate), facial recognition (Apple's Face ID or Microsoft's DeepFace and Google's FaceNet) and image labeling (used by Facebook, Apple's iPhoto and TikTok). The deployment of AI may be overseen by a Chief automation officer (CAO). The application of AI in medicine and medical research has the potential to increase patient care and quality of life.[130] Through the lens of the Hippocratic Oath, medical professionals are ethically compelled to use AI, if applications can more accurately diagnose and treat patients.[131][132] For medical research, AI is an important tool for processing and integrating big data. This is particularly important for organoid and tissue engineering development which use microscopy imaging as a key technique in fabrication.[133] It has been suggested that AI can overcome discrepancies in funding allocated to different fields of research.[133] New AI tools can deepen the understanding of biomedically relevant pathways. For example, AlphaFold 2 (2021) demonstrated the ability to approximate, in hours rather than months, the 3D structure of a protein.[134] In 2023, it was reported that AI-guided drug discovery helped find a class of antibiotics capable of killing two different types of drug-resistant bacteria.[135] In 2024, researchers used machine learning to accelerate the search for Parkinson's disease drug treatments. Their aim was to identify compounds that block the clumping, or aggregation, of alpha-synuclein (the protein that characterises Parkinson's disease). They were able to speed up the initial screening process ten-fold and reduce the cost by a thousand-fold.[136][137] Applications of AI in this domain include AI-enabled menstruation and fertility trackers that analyze user data to offer prediction,[138] AI-integrated sex toys (e.g., teledildonics),[139] AI-generated sexual education content,[140] and AI agents that simulate sexual and romantic partners (e.g., Replika).[141] AI is also used for the production of non-consensual deepfake pornography, raising significant ethical and legal concerns.[142] AI technologies have also been used to attempt to identify online gender-based violence and online sexual grooming of minors.[143][144] Game playing programs have been used since the 1950s to demonstrate and test AI's most advanced techniques.[145] Deep Blue became the first computer chess-playing system to beat a reigning world chess champion, Garry Kasparov, on 11 May 1997.[146] In 2011, in a Jeopardy! quiz show exhibition match, IBM's question answering system, Watson, defeated the two greatest Jeopardy! champions, Brad Rutter and Ken Jennings, by a significant margin.[147] In March 2016, AlphaGo won 4 out of 5 games of Go in a match with Go champion Lee Sedol, becoming the first computer Go-playing system to beat a professional Go player without handicaps. Then, in 2017, it defeated Ke Jie, who was the best Go player in the world.[148] Other programs handle imperfect-information games, such as the poker-playing program Pluribus.[149] DeepMind developed increasingly generalistic reinforcement learning models, such as with MuZero, which could be trained to play chess, Go, or Atari games.[150] In 2019, DeepMind's AlphaStar achieved grandmaster level in StarCraft II, a particularly challenging real-time strategy game that involves incomplete knowledge of what happens on the map.[151] In 2021, an AI agent competed in a PlayStation Gran Turismo competition, winning against four of the world's best Gran Turismo drivers using deep reinforcement learning.[152] In 2024, Google DeepMind introduced SIMA, a type of AI capable of autonomously playing nine previously unseen open-world video games by observing screen output, as well as executing short, specific tasks in response to natural language instructions.[153] In mathematics, special forms of formal step-by-step reasoning are used.[154] In contrast, LLMs such as GPT-4 Turbo, Gemini Ultra, Claude Opus, LLaMa-2 or Mistral Large are working with probabilistic models, which can produce wrong answers in the form of hallucinations. Therefore, they need not only a large database of mathematical problems to learn from but also methods such as supervised fine-tuning or trained classifiers with human-annotated data to improve answers for new problems and learn from corrections.[155] A 2024 study showed that the performance of some language models for reasoning capabilities in solving math problems not included in their training data was low, even for problems with only minor deviations from trained data.[156] Alternatively, dedicated models for mathematical problem solving with higher precision for the outcome including proof of theorems have been developed such as Alpha Tensor, Alpha Geometry and Alpha Proof all from Google DeepMind,[157] Llemma from eleuther[158] or Julius.[159] When natural language is used to describe mathematical problems, converters transform such prompts into a formal language such as Lean to define mathematical tasks. Some models have been developed to solve challenging problems and reach good results in benchmark tests, others to serve as educational tools in mathematics.[160] Finance is one of the fastest growing sectors where applied AI tools are being deployed: from retail online banking to investment advice and insurance, where automated \"robot advisers\" have been in use for some years.[161] World Pensions experts like Nicolas Firzli insist it may be too early to see the emergence of highly innovative AI-informed financial products and services: \"the deployment of AI tools will simply further automatise things: destroying tens of thousands of jobs in banking, financial planning, and pension advice in the process, but I'm not sure it will unleash a new wave of [e.g., sophisticated] pension innovation.\"[162] Various countries are deploying AI military applications.[163] The main applications enhance command and control, communications, sensors, integration and interoperability.[164] Research is targeting intelligence collection and analysis, logistics, cyber operations, information operations, and semiautonomous and autonomous vehicles.[163] AI technologies enable coordination of sensors and effectors, threat detection and identification, marking of enemy positions, target acquisition, coordination and deconfliction of distributed Joint Fires between networked combat vehicles involving manned and unmanned teams.[164] AI was incorporated into military operations in Iraq and Syria.[163] In November 2023, US Vice President Kamala Harris disclosed a declaration signed by 31 nations to set guardrails for the military use of AI. The commitments include using legal reviews to ensure the compliance of military AI with international laws, and being cautious and transparent in the development of this technology.[165] In the early 2020s, generative AI gained widespread prominence. GenAI is AI capable of generating text, images, videos, or other data using generative models,[166][167] often in response to prompts.[168][169] In March 2023, 58% of U.S. adults had heard about ChatGPT and 14% had tried it.[170] The increasing realism and ease-of-use of AI-based text-to-image generators such as Midjourney, DALL-E, and Stable Diffusion sparked a trend of viral AI-generated photos. Widespread attention was gained by a fake photo of Pope Francis wearing a white puffer coat, the fictional arrest of Donald Trump, and a hoax of an attack on the Pentagon, as well as the usage in professional creative arts.[171][172] Artificial intelligent (AI) agents are software entities designed to perceive their environment, make decisions, and take actions autonomously to achieve specific goals. These agents can interact with users, their environment, or other agents. AI agents are used in various applications, including virtual assistants, chatbots, autonomous vehicles, game-playing systems, and industrial robotics. AI agents operate within the constraints of their programming, available computational resources, and hardware limitations. This means they are restricted to performing tasks within their defined scope and have finite memory and processing capabilities. In real-world applications, AI agents often face time constraints for decision-making and action execution. Many AI agents incorporate learning algorithms, enabling them to improve their performance over time through experience or training. Using machine learning, AI agents can adapt to new situations and optimise their behaviour for their designated tasks.[173][174][175] There are also thousands of successful AI applications used to solve specific problems for specific industries or institutions. In a 2017 survey, one in five companies reported having incorporated \"AI\" in some offerings or processes.[176] A few examples are energy storage, medical diagnosis, military logistics, applications that predict the result of judicial decisions, foreign policy, or supply chain management. AI applications for evacuation and disaster management are growing. AI has been used to investigate if and how people evacuated in large scale and small scale evacuations using historical data from GPS, videos or social media. Further, AI can provide real time information on the real time evacuation conditions.[177][178][179] In agriculture, AI has helped farmers identify areas that need irrigation, fertilization, pesticide treatments or increasing yield. Agronomists use AI to conduct research and development. AI has been used to predict the ripening time for crops such as tomatoes, monitor soil moisture, operate agricultural robots, conduct predictive analytics, classify livestock pig call emotions, automate greenhouses, detect diseases and pests, and save water. Artificial intelligence is used in astronomy to analyze increasing amounts of available data and applications, mainly for \"classification, regression, clustering, forecasting, generation, discovery, and the development of new scientific insights.\" For example, it is used for discovering exoplanets, forecasting solar activity, and distinguishing between signals and instrumental effects in gravitational wave astronomy. Additionally, it could be used for activities in space, such as space exploration, including the analysis of data from space missions, real-time science decisions of spacecraft, space debris avoidance, and more autonomous operation. During the 2024 Indian elections, US$50 millions was spent on authorized AI-generated content, notably by creating deepfakes of allied (including sometimes deceased) politicians to better engage with voters, and by translating speeches to various local languages.[180] AI has potential benefits and potential risks.[181] AI may be able to advance science and find solutions for serious problems: Demis Hassabis of DeepMind hopes to \"solve intelligence, and then use that to solve everything else\".[182] However, as the use of AI has become widespread, several unintended consequences and risks have been identified.[183] In-production systems can sometimes not factor ethics and bias into their AI training processes, especially when the AI algorithms are inherently unexplainable in deep learning.[184] Machine learning algorithms require large amounts of data. The techniques used to acquire this data have raised concerns about privacy, surveillance and copyright. AI-powered devices and services, such as virtual assistants and IoT products, continuously collect personal information, raising concerns about intrusive data gathering and unauthorized access by third parties. The loss of privacy is further exacerbated by AI's ability to process and combine vast amounts of data, potentially leading to a surveillance society where individual activities are constantly monitored and analyzed without adequate safeguards or transparency. Sensitive user data collected may include online activity records, geolocation data, video or audio.[185] For example, in order to build speech recognition algorithms, Amazon has recorded millions of private conversations and allowed temporary workers to listen to and transcribe some of them.[186] Opinions about this widespread surveillance range from those who see it as a necessary evil to those for whom it is clearly unethical and a violation of the right to privacy.[187] AI developers argue that this is the only way to deliver valuable applications. and have developed several techniques that attempt to preserve privacy while still obtaining the data, such as data aggregation, de-identification and differential privacy.[188] Since 2016, some privacy experts, such as Cynthia Dwork, have begun to view privacy in terms of fairness. Brian Christian wrote that experts have pivoted \"from the question of 'what they know' to the question of 'what they're doing with it'.\"[189] Generative AI is often trained on unlicensed copyrighted works, including in domains such as images or computer code; the output is then used under the rationale of \"fair use\". Experts disagree about how well and under what circumstances this rationale will hold up in courts of law; relevant factors may include \"the purpose and character of the use of the copyrighted work\" and \"the effect upon the potential market for the copyrighted work\".[190][191] Website owners who do not wish to have their content scraped can indicate it in a \"robots.txt\" file.[192] In 2023, leading authors (including John Grisham and Jonathan Franzen) sued AI companies for using their work to train generative AI.[193][194] Another discussed approach is to envision a separate sui generis system of protection for creations generated by AI to ensure fair attribution and compensation for human authors.[195] The commercial AI scene is dominated by Big Tech companies such as Alphabet Inc., Amazon, Apple Inc., Meta Platforms, and Microsoft.[196][197][198] Some of these players already own the vast majority of existing cloud infrastructure and computing power from data centers, allowing them to entrench further in the marketplace.[199][200] In January 2024, the International Energy Agency (IEA) released Electricity 2024, Analysis and Forecast to 2026, forecasting electric power use.[201] This is the first IEA report to make projections for data centers and power consumption for artificial intelligence and cryptocurrency. The report states that power demand for these uses might double by 2026, with additional electric power usage equal to electricity used by the whole Japanese nation.[202] Prodigious power consumption by AI is responsible for the growth of fossil fuels use, and might delay closings of obsolete, carbon-emitting coal energy facilities. There is a feverish rise in the construction of data centers throughout the US, making large technology firms (e.g., Microsoft, Meta, Google, Amazon) into voracious consumers of electric power. Projected electric consumption is so immense that there is concern that it will be fulfilled no matter the source. A ChatGPT search involves the use of 10 times the electrical energy as a Google search. The large firms are in haste to find power sources – from nuclear energy to geothermal to fusion. The tech firms argue that – in the long view – AI will be eventually kinder to the environment, but they need the energy now. AI makes the power grid more efficient and \"intelligent\", will assist in the growth of nuclear power, and track overall carbon emissions, according to technology firms.[203] A 2024 Goldman Sachs Research Paper, AI Data Centers and the Coming US Power Demand Surge, found \"US power demand (is) likely to experience growth not seen in a generation....\" and forecasts that, by 2030, US data centers will consume 8% of US power, as opposed to 3% in 2022, presaging growth for the electrical power generation industry by a variety of means.[204] Data centers' need for more and more electrical power is such that they might max out the electrical grid. The Big Tech companies counter that AI can be used to maximize the utilization of the grid by all.[205] In 2024, the Wall Street Journal reported that big AI companies have begun negotiations with the US nuclear power providers to provide electricity to the data centers. In March 2024 Amazon purchased a Pennsylvania nuclear-powered data center for $650 Million (US).[206] Nvidia CEO Jen-Hsun Huang said nuclear power is a good option for the data centers.[207] In September 2024, Microsoft announced an agreement with Constellation Energy to re-open the Three Mile Island nuclear power plant to provide Microsoft with 100% of all electric power produced by the plant for 20 years. Reopening the plant, which suffered a partial nuclear meltdown of its Unit 2 reactor in 1979, will require Constellation to get through strict regulatory processes which will include extensive safety scrutiny from the US Nuclear Regulatory Commission. If approved (this will be the first ever US re-commissioning of a nuclear plant), over 835 megawatts of power – enough for 800,000 homes – of energy will be produced. The cost for re-opening and upgrading is estimated at $1.6 billion (US) and is dependent on tax breaks for nuclear power contained in the 2022 US Inflation Reduction Act.[208] The US government and the state of Michigan are investing almost $2 billion (US) to reopen the Palisades Nuclear reactor on Lake Michigan. Closed since 2022, the plant is planned to be reopened in October 2025. The Three Mile Island facility will be renamed the Crane Clean Energy Center after Chris Crane, a nuclear proponent and former CEO of Exelon who was responsible for Exelon spinoff of Constellation.[209] After the last approval in September 2023, Taiwan suspended the approval of data centers north of Taoyuan with a capacity of more than 5 MW in 2024, due to power supply shortages.[210] Taiwan aims to phase out nuclear power by 2025.[210] On the other hand, Singapore imposed a ban on the opening of data centers in 2019 due to electric power, but in 2022, lifted this ban.[210] Although most nuclear plants in Japan have been shut down after the 2011 Fukushima nuclear accident, according to an October 2024 Bloomberg article in Japanese, cloud gaming services company Ubitus, in which Nvidia has a stake, is looking for land in Japan near nuclear power plant for a new data center for generative AI.[211] Ubitus CEO Wesley Kuo said nuclear power plants are the most efficient, cheap and stable power for AI.[211] On 1 November 2024, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) rejected an application submitted by Talen Energy for approval to supply some electricity from the nuclear power station Susquehanna to Amazon's data center.[212] According to the Commission Chairman Willie L. Phillips, it is a burden on the electricity grid as well as a significant cost shifting concern to households and other business sectors.[212] YouTube, Facebook and others use recommender systems to guide users to more content. These AI programs were given the goal of maximizing user engagement (that is, the only goal was to keep people watching). The AI learned that users tended to choose misinformation, conspiracy theories, and extreme partisan content, and, to keep them watching, the AI recommended more of it. Users also tended to watch more content on the same subject, so the AI led people into filter bubbles where they received multiple versions of the same misinformation.[213] This convinced many users that the misinformation was true, and ultimately undermined trust in institutions, the media and the government.[214] The AI program had correctly learned to maximize its goal, but the result was harmful to society. After the U.S. election in 2016, major technology companies took steps to mitigate the problem [citation needed]. In 2022, generative AI began to create images, audio, video and text that are indistinguishable from real photographs, recordings, films, or human writing. It is possible for bad actors to use this technology to create massive amounts of misinformation or propaganda.[215] AI pioneer Geoffrey Hinton expressed concern about AI enabling \"authoritarian leaders to manipulate their electorates\" on a large scale, among other risks.[216] Machine learning applications will be biased[k] if they learn from biased data.[218] The developers may not be aware that the bias exists.[219] Bias can be introduced by the way training data is selected and by the way a model is deployed.[220][218] If a biased algorithm is used to make decisions that can seriously harm people (as it can in medicine, finance, recruitment, housing or policing) then the algorithm may cause discrimination.[221] The field of fairness studies how to prevent harms from algorithmic biases. On June 28, 2015, Google Photos's new image labeling feature mistakenly identified Jacky Alcine and a friend as \"gorillas\" because they were black. The system was trained on a dataset that contained very few images of black people,[222] a problem called \"sample size disparity\".[223] Google \"fixed\" this problem by preventing the system from labelling anything as a \"gorilla\". Eight years later, in 2023, Google Photos still could not identify a gorilla, and neither could similar products from Apple, Facebook, Microsoft and Amazon.[224] COMPAS is a commercial program widely used by U.S. courts to assess the likelihood of a defendant becoming a recidivist. In 2016, Julia Angwin at ProPublica discovered that COMPAS exhibited racial bias, despite the fact that the program was not told the races of the defendants. Although the error rate for both whites and blacks was calibrated equal at exactly 61%, the errors for each race were different—the system consistently overestimated the chance that a black person would re-offend and would underestimate the chance that a white person would not re-offend.[225] In 2017, several researchers[l] showed that it was mathematically impossible for COMPAS to accommodate all possible measures of fairness when the base rates of re-offense were different for whites and blacks in the data.[227] A program can make biased decisions even if the data does not explicitly mention a problematic feature (such as \"race\" or \"gender\"). The feature will correlate with other features (like \"address\", \"shopping history\" or \"first name\"), and the program will make the same decisions based on these features as it would on \"race\" or \"gender\".[228] Moritz Hardt said \"the most robust fact in this research area is that fairness through blindness doesn't work.\"[229] Criticism of COMPAS highlighted that machine learning models are designed to make \"predictions\" that are only valid if we assume that the future will resemble the past. If they are trained on data that includes the results of racist decisions in the past, machine learning models must predict that racist decisions will be made in the future. If an application then uses these predictions as recommendations, some of these \"recommendations\" will likely be racist.[230] Thus, machine learning is not well suited to help make decisions in areas where there is hope that the future will be better than the past. It is descriptive rather than prescriptive.[m] Bias and unfairness may go undetected because the developers are overwhelmingly white and male: among AI engineers, about 4% are black and 20% are women.[223] There are various conflicting definitions and mathematical models of fairness. These notions depend on ethical assumptions, and are influenced by beliefs about society. One broad category is distributive fairness, which focuses on the outcomes, often identifying groups and seeking to compensate for statistical disparities. Representational fairness tries to ensure that AI systems do not reinforce negative stereotypes or render certain groups invisible. Procedural fairness focuses on the decision process rather than the outcome. The most relevant notions of fairness may depend on the context, notably the type of AI application and the stakeholders. The subjectivity in the notions of bias and fairness makes it difficult for companies to operationalize them. Having access to sensitive attributes such as race or gender is also considered by many AI ethicists to be necessary in order to compensate for biases, but it may conflict with anti-discrimination laws.[217] At its 2022 Conference on Fairness, Accountability, and Transparency (ACM FAccT 2022), the Association for Computing Machinery, in Seoul, South Korea, presented and published findings that recommend that until AI and robotics systems are demonstrated to be free of bias mistakes, they are unsafe, and the use of self-learning neural networks trained on vast, unregulated sources of flawed internet data should be curtailed.[dubious – discuss][232] Many AI systems are so complex that their designers cannot explain how they reach their decisions.[233] Particularly with deep neural networks, in which there are a large amount of non-linear relationships between inputs and outputs. But some popular explainability techniques exist.[234] It is impossible to be certain that a program is operating correctly if no one knows how exactly it works. There have been many cases where a machine learning program passed rigorous tests, but nevertheless learned something different than what the programmers intended. For example, a system that could identify skin diseases better than medical professionals was found to actually have a strong tendency to classify images with a ruler as \"cancerous\", because pictures of malignancies typically include a ruler to show the scale.[235] Another machine learning system designed to help effectively allocate medical resources was found to classify patients with asthma as being at \"low risk\" of dying from pneumonia. Having asthma is actually a severe risk factor, but since the patients having asthma would usually get much more medical care, they were relatively unlikely to die according to the training data. The correlation between asthma and low risk of dying from pneumonia was real, but misleading.[236] People who have been harmed by an algorithm's decision have a right to an explanation.[237] Doctors, for example, are expected to clearly and completely explain to their colleagues the reasoning behind any decision they make. Early drafts of the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation in 2016 included an explicit statement that this right exists.[n] Industry experts noted that this is an unsolved problem with no solution in sight. Regulators argued that nevertheless the harm is real: if the problem has no solution, the tools should not be used.[238] DARPA established the XAI (\"Explainable Artificial Intelligence\") program in 2014 to try to solve these problems.[239] Several approaches aim to address the transparency problem. SHAP enables to visualise the contribution of each feature to the output.[240] LIME can locally approximate a model's outputs with a simpler, interpretable model.[241] Multitask learning provides a large number of outputs in addition to the target classification. These other outputs can help developers deduce what the network has learned.[242] Deconvolution, DeepDream and other generative methods can allow developers to see what different layers of a deep network for computer vision have learned, and produce output that can suggest what the network is learning.[243] For generative pre-trained transformers, Anthropic developed a technique based on dictionary learning that associates patterns of neuron activations with human-understandable concepts.[244] Artificial intelligence provides a number of tools that are useful to bad actors, such as authoritarian governments, terrorists, criminals or rogue states. A lethal autonomous weapon is a machine that locates, selects and engages human targets without human supervision.[o] Widely available AI tools can be used by bad actors to develop inexpensive autonomous weapons and, if produced at scale, they are potentially weapons of mass destruction.[246] Even when used in conventional warfare, it is unlikely that they will be unable to reliably choose targets and could potentially kill an innocent person.[246] In 2014, 30 nations (including China) supported a ban on autonomous weapons under the United Nations' Convention on Certain Conventional Weapons, however the United States and others disagreed.[247] By 2015, over fifty countries were reported to be researching battlefield robots.[248] AI tools make it easier for authoritarian governments to efficiently control their citizens in several ways. Face and voice recognition allow widespread surveillance. Machine learning, operating this data, can classify potential enemies of the state and prevent them from hiding. Recommendation systems can precisely target propaganda and misinformation for maximum effect. Deepfakes and generative AI aid in producing misinformation. Advanced AI can make authoritarian centralized decision making more competitive than liberal and decentralized systems such as markets. It lowers the cost and difficulty of digital warfare and advanced spyware.[249] All these technologies have been available since 2020 or earlier—AI facial recognition systems are already being used for mass surveillance in China.[250][251] There many other ways that AI is expected to help bad actors, some of which can not be foreseen. For example, machine-learning AI is able to design tens of thousands of toxic molecules in a matter of hours.[252] Economists have frequently highlighted the risks of redundancies from AI, and speculated about unemployment if there is no adequate social policy for full employment.[253] In the past, technology has tended to increase rather than reduce total employment, but economists acknowledge that \"we're in uncharted territory\" with AI.[254] A survey of economists showed disagreement about whether the increasing use of robots and AI will cause a substantial increase in long-term unemployment, but they generally agree that it could be a net benefit if productivity gains are redistributed.[255] Risk estimates vary; for example, in the 2010s, Michael Osborne and Carl Benedikt Frey estimated 47% of U.S. jobs are at \"high risk\" of potential automation, while an OECD report classified only 9% of U.S. jobs as \"high risk\".[p][257] The methodology of speculating about future employment levels has been criticised as lacking evidential foundation, and for implying that technology, rather than social policy, creates unemployment, as opposed to redundancies.[253] In April 2023, it was reported that 70% of the jobs for Chinese video game illustrators had been eliminated by generative artificial intelligence.[258][259] Unlike previous waves of automation, many middle-class jobs may be eliminated by artificial intelligence; The Economist stated in 2015 that \"the worry that AI could do to white-collar jobs what steam power did to blue-collar ones during the Industrial Revolution\" is \"worth taking seriously\".[260] Jobs at extreme risk range from paralegals to fast food cooks, while job demand is likely to increase for care-related professions ranging from personal healthcare to the clergy.[261] From the early days of the development of artificial intelligence, there have been arguments, for example, those put forward by Joseph Weizenbaum, about whether tasks that can be done by computers actually should be done by them, given the difference between computers and humans, and between quantitative calculation and qualitative, value-based judgement.[262] It has been argued AI will become so powerful that humanity may irreversibly lose control of it. This could, as physicist Stephen Hawking stated, \"spell the end of the human race\".[263] This scenario has been common in science fiction, when a computer or robot suddenly develops a human-like \"self-awareness\" (or \"sentience\" or \"consciousness\") and becomes a malevolent character.[q] These sci-fi scenarios are misleading in several ways. First, AI does not require human-like \"sentience\" to be an existential risk. Modern AI programs are given specific goals and use learning and intelligence to achieve them. Philosopher Nick Bostrom argued that if one gives almost any goal to a sufficiently powerful AI, it may choose to destroy humanity to achieve it (he used the example of a paperclip factory manager).[265] Stuart Russell gives the example of household robot that tries to find a way to kill its owner to prevent it from being unplugged, reasoning that \"you can't fetch the coffee if you're dead.\"[266] In order to be safe for humanity, a superintelligence would have to be genuinely aligned with humanity's morality and values so that it is \"fundamentally on our side\".[267] Second, Yuval Noah Harari argues that AI does not require a robot body or physical control to pose an existential risk. The essential parts of civilization are not physical. Things like ideologies, law, government, money and the economy are made of language; they exist because there are stories that billions of people believe. The current prevalence of misinformation suggests that an AI could use language to convince people to believe anything, even to take actions that are destructive.[268] The opinions amongst experts and industry insiders are mixed, with sizable fractions both concerned and unconcerned by risk from eventual superintelligent AI.[269] Personalities such as Stephen Hawking, Bill Gates, and Elon Musk,[270] as well as AI pioneers such as Yoshua Bengio, Stuart Russell, Demis Hassabis, and Sam Altman, have expressed concerns about existential risk from AI. In May 2023, Geoffrey Hinton announced his resignation from Google in order to be able to \"freely speak out about the risks of AI\" without \"considering how this impacts Google.\"[271] He notably mentioned risks of an AI takeover,[272] and stressed that in order to avoid the worst outcomes, establishing safety guidelines will require cooperation among those competing in use of AI.[273] In 2023, many leading AI experts issued the joint statement that \"Mitigating the risk of extinction from AI should be a global priority alongside other societal-scale risks such as pandemics and nuclear war\".[274] Other researchers, however, spoke in favor of a less dystopian view. AI pioneer Juergen Schmidhuber did not sign the joint statement, emphasising that in 95% of all cases, AI research is about making \"human lives longer and healthier and easier.\"[275] While the tools that are now being used to improve lives can also be used by bad actors, \"they can also be used against the bad actors.\"[276][277] Andrew Ng also argued that \"it's a mistake to fall for the doomsday hype on AI—and that regulators who do will only benefit vested interests.\"[278] Yann LeCun \"scoffs at his peers' dystopian scenarios of supercharged misinformation and even, eventually, human extinction.\"[279] In the early 2010s, experts argued that the risks are too distant in the future to warrant research or that humans will be valuable from the perspective of a superintelligent machine.[280] However, after 2016, the study of current and future risks and possible solutions became a serious area of research.[281] Friendly AI are machines that have been designed from the beginning to minimize risks and to make choices that benefit humans. Eliezer Yudkowsky, who coined the term, argues that developing friendly AI should be a higher research priority: it may require a large investment and it must be completed before AI becomes an existential risk.[282] Machines with intelligence have the potential to use their intelligence to make ethical decisions. The field of machine ethics provides machines with ethical principles and procedures for resolving ethical dilemmas.[283] The field of machine ethics is also called computational morality,[283] and was founded at an AAAI symposium in 2005.[284] Other approaches include Wendell Wallach's \"artificial moral agents\"[285] and Stuart J. Russell's three principles for developing provably beneficial machines.[286] Active organizations in the AI open-source community include Hugging Face,[287] Google,[288] EleutherAI and Meta.[289] Various AI models, such as Llama 2, Mistral or Stable Diffusion, have been made open-weight,[290][291] meaning that their architecture and trained parameters (the \"weights\") are publicly available. Open-weight models can be freely fine-tuned, which allows companies to specialize them with their own data and for their own use-case.[292] Open-weight models are useful for research and innovation but can also be misused. Since they can be fine-tuned, any built-in security measure, such as objecting to harmful requests, can be trained away until it becomes ineffective. Some researchers warn that future AI models may develop dangerous capabilities (such as the potential to drastically facilitate bioterrorism) and that once released on the Internet, they cannot be deleted everywhere if needed. They recommend pre-release audits and cost-benefit analyses.[293] Artificial Intelligence projects can have their ethical permissibility tested while designing, developing, and implementing an AI system. An AI framework such as the Care and Act Framework containing the SUM values—developed by the Alan Turing Institute tests projects in four main areas:[294][295] Other developments in ethical frameworks include those decided upon during the Asilomar Conference, the Montreal Declaration for Responsible AI, and the IEEE's Ethics of Autonomous Systems initiative, among others;[296] however, these principles do not go without their criticisms, especially regards to the people chosen contributes to these frameworks.[297] Promotion of the wellbeing of the people and communities that these technologies affect requires consideration of the social and ethical implications at all stages of AI system design, development and implementation, and collaboration between job roles such as data scientists, product managers, data engineers, domain experts, and delivery managers.[298] The UK AI Safety Institute released in 2024 a testing toolset called 'Inspect' for AI safety evaluations available under a MIT open-source licence which is freely available on GitHub and can be improved with third-party packages. It can be used to evaluate AI models in a range of areas including core knowledge, ability to reason, and autonomous capabilities.[299] The regulation of artificial intelligence is the development of public sector policies and laws for promoting and regulating AI; it is therefore related to the broader regulation of algorithms.[300] The regulatory and policy landscape for AI is an emerging issue in jurisdictions globally.[301] According to AI Index at Stanford, the annual number of AI-related laws passed in the 127 survey countries jumped from one passed in 2016 to 37 passed in 2022 alone.[302][303] Between 2016 and 2020, more than 30 countries adopted dedicated strategies for AI.[304] Most EU member states had released national AI strategies, as had Canada, China, India, Japan, Mauritius, the Russian Federation, Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates, U.S., and Vietnam. Others were in the process of elaborating their own AI strategy, including Bangladesh, Malaysia and Tunisia.[304] The Global Partnership on Artificial Intelligence was launched in June 2020, stating a need for AI to be developed in accordance with human rights and democratic values, to ensure public confidence and trust in the technology.[304] Henry Kissinger, Eric Schmidt, and Daniel Huttenlocher published a joint statement in November 2021 calling for a government commission to regulate AI.[305] In 2023, OpenAI leaders published recommendations for the governance of superintelligence, which they believe may happen in less than 10 years.[306] In 2023, the United Nations also launched an advisory body to provide recommendations on AI governance; the body comprises technology company executives, governments officials and academics.[307] In 2024, the Council of Europe created the first international legally binding treaty on AI, called the \"Framework Convention on Artificial Intelligence and Human Rights, Democracy and the Rule of Law\". It was adopted by the European Union, the United States, the United Kingdom, and other signatories.[308] In a 2022 Ipsos survey, attitudes towards AI varied greatly by country; 78% of Chinese citizens, but only 35% of Americans, agreed that \"products and services using AI have more benefits than drawbacks\".[302] A 2023 Reuters/Ipsos poll found that 61% of Americans agree, and 22% disagree, that AI poses risks to humanity.[309] In a 2023 Fox News poll, 35% of Americans thought it \"very important\", and an additional 41% thought it \"somewhat important\", for the federal government to regulate AI, versus 13% responding \"not very important\" and 8% responding \"not at all important\".[310][311] In November 2023, the first global AI Safety Summit was held in Bletchley Park in the UK to discuss the near and far term risks of AI and the possibility of mandatory and voluntary regulatory frameworks.[312] 28 countries including the United States, China, and the European Union issued a declaration at the start of the summit, calling for international co-operation to manage the challenges and risks of artificial intelligence.[313][314] In May 2024 at the AI Seoul Summit, 16 global AI tech companies agreed to safety commitments on the development of AI.[315][316] The study of mechanical or \"formal\" reasoning began with philosophers and mathematicians in antiquity. The study of logic led directly to Alan Turing's theory of computation, which suggested that a machine, by shuffling symbols as simple as \"0\" and \"1\", could simulate any conceivable form of mathematical reasoning.[317][318] This, along with concurrent discoveries in cybernetics, information theory and neurobiology, led researchers to consider the possibility of building an \"electronic brain\".[r] They developed several areas of research that would become part of AI,[320] such as McCullouch and Pitts design for \"artificial neurons\" in 1943,[115] and Turing's influential 1950 paper 'Computing Machinery and Intelligence', which introduced the Turing test and showed that \"machine intelligence\" was plausible.[321][318] The field of AI research was founded at a workshop at Dartmouth College in 1956.[s][6] The attendees became the leaders of AI research in the 1960s.[t] They and their students produced programs that the press described as \"astonishing\":[u] computers were learning checkers strategies, solving word problems in algebra, proving logical theorems and speaking English.[v][7] Artificial intelligence laboratories were set up at a number of British and U.S. universities in the latter 1950s and early 1960s.[318] Researchers in the 1960s and the 1970s were convinced that their methods would eventually succeed in creating a machine with general intelligence and considered this the goal of their field.[325] In 1965 Herbert Simon predicted, \"machines will be capable, within twenty years, of doing any work a man can do\".[326] In 1967 Marvin Minsky agreed, writing that \"within a generation ... the problem of creating 'artificial intelligence' will substantially be solved\".[327] They had, however, underestimated the difficulty of the problem.[w] In 1974, both the U.S. and British governments cut off exploratory research in response to the criticism of Sir James Lighthill[329] and ongoing pressure from the U.S. Congress to fund more productive projects.[330] Minsky's and Papert's book Perceptrons was understood as proving that artificial neural networks would never be useful for solving real-world tasks, thus discrediting the approach altogether.[331] The \"AI winter\", a period when obtaining funding for AI projects was difficult, followed.[9] In the early 1980s, AI research was revived by the commercial success of expert systems,[332] a form of AI program that simulated the knowledge and analytical skills of human experts. By 1985, the market for AI had reached over a billion dollars. At the same time, Japan's fifth generation computer project inspired the U.S. and British governments to restore funding for academic research.[8] However, beginning with the collapse of the Lisp Machine market in 1987, AI once again fell into disrepute, and a second, longer-lasting winter began.[10] Up to this point, most of AI's funding had gone to projects that used high-level symbols to represent mental objects like plans, goals, beliefs, and known facts. In the 1980s, some researchers began to doubt that this approach would be able to imitate all the processes of human cognition, especially perception, robotics, learning and pattern recognition,[333] and began to look into \"sub-symbolic\" approaches.[334] Rodney Brooks rejected \"representation\" in general and focussed directly on engineering machines that move and survive.[x] Judea Pearl, Lofti Zadeh and others developed methods that handled incomplete and uncertain information by making reasonable guesses rather than precise logic.[86][339] But the most important development was the revival of \"connectionism\", including neural network research, by Geoffrey Hinton and others.[340] In 1990, Yann LeCun successfully showed that convolutional neural networks can recognize handwritten digits, the first of many successful applications of neural networks.[341] AI gradually restored its reputation in the late 1990s and early 21st century by exploiting formal mathematical methods and by finding specific solutions to specific problems. This \"narrow\" and \"formal\" focus allowed researchers to produce verifiable results and collaborate with other fields (such as statistics, economics and mathematics).[342] By 2000, solutions developed by AI researchers were being widely used, although in the 1990s they were rarely described as \"artificial intelligence\" (a tendency known as the AI effect).[343] However, several academic researchers became concerned that AI was no longer pursuing its original goal of creating versatile, fully intelligent machines. Beginning around 2002, they founded the subfield of artificial general intelligence (or \"AGI\"), which had several well-funded institutions by the 2010s.[4] Deep learning began to dominate industry benchmarks in 2012 and was adopted throughout the field.[11] For many specific tasks, other methods were abandoned.[y] Deep learning's success was based on both hardware improvements (faster computers,[345] graphics processing units, cloud computing[346]) and access to large amounts of data[347] (including curated datasets,[346] such as ImageNet). Deep learning's success led to an enormous increase in interest and funding in AI.[z] The amount of machine learning research (measured by total publications) increased by 50% in the years 2015–2019.[304] In 2016, issues of fairness and the misuse of technology were catapulted into center stage at machine learning conferences, publications vastly increased, funding became available, and many researchers re-focussed their careers on these issues. The alignment problem became a serious field of academic study.[281] In the late teens and early 2020s, AGI companies began to deliver programs that created enormous interest. In 2015, AlphaGo, developed by DeepMind, beat the world champion Go player. The program was taught only the rules of the game and developed strategy by itself. GPT-3 is a large language model that was released in 2020 by OpenAI and is capable of generating high-quality human-like text.[348] These programs, and others, inspired an aggressive AI boom, where large companies began investing billions in AI research. According to AI Impacts, about $50 billion annually was invested in \"AI\" around 2022 in the U.S. alone and about 20% of the new U.S. Computer Science PhD graduates have specialized in \"AI\".[349] About 800,000 \"AI\"-related U.S. job openings existed in 2022.[350] Philosophical debates have historically sought to determine the nature of intelligence and how to make intelligent machines.[351] Another major focus has been whether machines can be conscious, and the associated ethical implications.[352] Many other topics in philosophy are relevant to AI, such as epistemology and free will.[353] Rapid advancements have intensified public discussions on the philosophy and ethics of AI.[352] Alan Turing wrote in 1950 \"I propose to consider the question 'can machines think'?\"[354] He advised changing the question from whether a machine \"thinks\", to \"whether or not it is possible for machinery to show intelligent behaviour\".[354] He devised the Turing test, which measures the ability of a machine to simulate human conversation.[321] Since we can only observe the behavior of the machine, it does not matter if it is \"actually\" thinking or literally has a \"mind\". Turing notes that we can not determine these things about other people but \"it is usual to have a polite convention that everyone thinks.\"[355] Russell and Norvig agree with Turing that intelligence must be defined in terms of external behavior, not internal structure.[1] However, they are critical that the test requires the machine to imitate humans. \"Aeronautical engineering texts,\" they wrote, \"do not define the goal of their field as making 'machines that fly so exactly like pigeons that they can fool other pigeons.'\"[357] AI founder John McCarthy agreed, writing that \"Artificial intelligence is not, by definition, simulation of human intelligence\".[358] McCarthy defines intelligence as \"the computational part of the ability to achieve goals in the world\".[359] Another AI founder, Marvin Minsky similarly describes it as \"the ability to solve hard problems\".[360] The leading AI textbook defines it as the study of agents that perceive their environment and take actions that maximize their chances of achieving defined goals.[1] These definitions view intelligence in terms of well-defined problems with well-defined solutions, where both the difficulty of the problem and the performance of the program are direct measures of the \"intelligence\" of the machine—and no other philosophical discussion is required, or may not even be possible. Another definition has been adopted by Google,[361] a major practitioner in the field of AI. This definition stipulates the ability of systems to synthesize information as the manifestation of intelligence, similar to the way it is defined in biological intelligence. Some authors have suggested in practice, that the definition of AI is vague and difficult to define, with contention as to whether classical algorithms should be categorised as AI,[362] with many companies during the early 2020s AI boom using the term as a marketing buzzword, often even if they did \"not actually use AI in a material way\".[363] No established unifying theory or paradigm has guided AI research for most of its history.[aa] The unprecedented success of statistical machine learning in the 2010s eclipsed all other approaches (so much so that some sources, especially in the business world, use the term \"artificial intelligence\" to mean \"machine learning with neural networks\"). This approach is mostly sub-symbolic, soft and narrow. Critics argue that these questions may have to be revisited by future generations of AI researchers. Symbolic AI (or \"GOFAI\")[365] simulated the high-level conscious reasoning that people use when they solve puzzles, express legal reasoning and do mathematics. They were highly successful at \"intelligent\" tasks such as algebra or IQ tests. In the 1960s, Newell and Simon proposed the physical symbol systems hypothesis: \"A physical symbol system has the necessary and sufficient means of general intelligent action.\"[366] However, the symbolic approach failed on many tasks that humans solve easily, such as learning, recognizing an object or commonsense reasoning. Moravec's paradox is the discovery that high-level \"intelligent\" tasks were easy for AI, but low level \"instinctive\" tasks were extremely difficult.[367] Philosopher Hubert Dreyfus had argued since the 1960s that human expertise depends on unconscious instinct rather than conscious symbol manipulation, and on having a \"feel\" for the situation, rather than explicit symbolic knowledge.[368] Although his arguments had been ridiculed and ignored when they were first presented, eventually, AI research came to agree with him.[ab][16] The issue is not resolved: sub-symbolic reasoning can make many of the same inscrutable mistakes that human intuition does, such as algorithmic bias. Critics such as Noam Chomsky argue continuing research into symbolic AI will still be necessary to attain general intelligence,[370][371] in part because sub-symbolic AI is a move away from explainable AI: it can be difficult or impossible to understand why a modern statistical AI program made a particular decision. The emerging field of neuro-symbolic artificial intelligence attempts to bridge the two approaches. \"Neats\" hope that intelligent behavior is described using simple, elegant principles (such as logic, optimization, or neural networks). \"Scruffies\" expect that it necessarily requires solving a large number of unrelated problems. Neats defend their programs with theoretical rigor, scruffies rely mainly on incremental testing to see if they work. This issue was actively discussed in the 1970s and 1980s,[372] but eventually was seen as irrelevant. Modern AI has elements of both. Finding a provably correct or optimal solution is intractable for many important problems.[15] Soft computing is a set of techniques, including genetic algorithms, fuzzy logic and neural networks, that are tolerant of imprecision, uncertainty, partial truth and approximation. Soft computing was introduced in the late 1980s and most successful AI programs in the 21st century are examples of soft computing with neural networks. AI researchers are divided as to whether to pursue the goals of artificial general intelligence and superintelligence directly or to solve as many specific problems as possible (narrow AI) in hopes these solutions will lead indirectly to the field's long-term goals.[373][374] General intelligence is difficult to define and difficult to measure, and modern AI has had more verifiable successes by focusing on specific problems with specific solutions. The sub-field of artificial general intelligence studies this area exclusively. The philosophy of mind does not know whether a machine can have a mind, consciousness and mental states, in the same sense that human beings do. This issue considers the internal experiences of the machine, rather than its external behavior. Mainstream AI research considers this issue irrelevant because it does not affect the goals of the field: to build machines that can solve problems using intelligence. Russell and Norvig add that \"[t]he additional project of making a machine conscious in exactly the way humans are is not one that we are equipped to take on.\"[375] However, the question has become central to the philosophy of mind. It is also typically the central question at issue in artificial intelligence in fiction. David Chalmers identified two problems in understanding the mind, which he named the \"hard\" and \"easy\" problems of consciousness.[376] The easy problem is understanding how the brain processes signals, makes plans and controls behavior. The hard problem is explaining how this feels or why it should feel like anything at all, assuming we are right in thinking that it truly does feel like something (Dennett's consciousness illusionism says this is an illusion). While human information processing is easy to explain, human subjective experience is difficult to explain. For example, it is easy to imagine a color-blind person who has learned to identify which objects in their field of view are red, but it is not clear what would be required for the person to know what red looks like.[377] Computationalism is the position in the philosophy of mind that the human mind is an information processing system and that thinking is a form of computing. Computationalism argues that the relationship between mind and body is similar or identical to the relationship between software and hardware and thus may be a solution to the mind–body problem. This philosophical position was inspired by the work of AI researchers and cognitive scientists in the 1960s and was originally proposed by philosophers Jerry Fodor and Hilary Putnam.[378] Philosopher John Searle characterized this position as \"strong AI\": \"The appropriately programmed computer with the right inputs and outputs would thereby have a mind in exactly the same sense human beings have minds.\"[ac] Searle challenges this claim with his Chinese room argument, which attempts to show that even a computer capable of perfectly simulating human behavior would not have a mind.[382] It is difficult or impossible to reliably evaluate whether an advanced AI is sentient (has the ability to feel), and if so, to what degree.[383] But if there is a significant chance that a given machine can feel and suffer, then it may be entitled to certain rights or welfare protection measures, similarly to animals.[384][385] Sapience (a set of capacities related to high intelligence, such as discernment or self-awareness) may provide another moral basis for AI rights.[384] Robot rights are also sometimes proposed as a practical way to integrate autonomous agents into society.[386] In 2017, the European Union considered granting \"electronic personhood\" to some of the most capable AI systems. Similarly to the legal status of companies, it would have conferred rights but also responsibilities.[387] Critics argued in 2018 that granting rights to AI systems would downplay the importance of human rights, and that legislation should focus on user needs rather than speculative futuristic scenarios. They also noted that robots lacked the autonomy to take part to society on their own.[388][389] Progress in AI increased interest in the topic. Proponents of AI welfare and rights often argue that AI sentience, if it emerges, would be particularly easy to deny. They warn that this may be a moral blind spot analogous to slavery or factory farming, which could lead to large-scale suffering if sentient AI is created and carelessly exploited.[385][384] A superintelligence is a hypothetical agent that would possess intelligence far surpassing that of the brightest and most gifted human mind.[374]If research into artificial general intelligence produced sufficiently intelligent software, it might be able to reprogram and improve itself. The improved software would be even better at improving itself, leading to what I. J. Good called an \"intelligence explosion\" and Vernor Vinge called a \"singularity\".[390] However, technologies cannot improve exponentially indefinitely, and typically follow an S-shaped curve, slowing when they reach the physical limits of what the technology can do.[391] Robot designer Hans Moravec, cyberneticist Kevin Warwick and inventor Ray Kurzweil have predicted that humans and machines may merge in the future into cyborgs that are more capable and powerful than either. This idea, called transhumanism, has roots in the writings of Aldous Huxley and Robert Ettinger.[392] Edward Fredkin argues that \"artificial intelligence is the next step in evolution\", an idea first proposed by Samuel Butler's \"Darwin among the Machines\" as far back as 1863, and expanded upon by George Dyson in his 1998 book Darwin Among the Machines: The Evolution of Global Intelligence.[393] Thought-capable artificial beings have appeared as storytelling devices since antiquity,[394] and have been a persistent theme in science fiction.[395] A common trope in these works began with Mary Shelley's Frankenstein, where a human creation becomes a threat to its masters. This includes such works as Arthur C. Clarke's and Stanley Kubrick's 2001: A Space Odyssey (both 1968), with HAL 9000, the murderous computer in charge of the Discovery One spaceship, as well as The Terminator (1984) and The Matrix (1999). In contrast, the rare loyal robots such as Gort from The Day the Earth Stood Still (1951) and Bishop from Aliens (1986) are less prominent in popular culture.[396] Isaac Asimov introduced the Three Laws of Robotics in many stories, most notably with the \"Multivac\" super-intelligent computer. Asimov's laws are often brought up during lay discussions of machine ethics;[397] while almost all artificial intelligence researchers are familiar with Asimov's laws through popular culture, they generally consider the laws useless for many reasons, one of which is their ambiguity.[398] Several works use AI to force us to confront the fundamental question of what makes us human, showing us artificial beings that have the ability to feel, and thus to suffer. This appears in Karel Čapek's R.U.R., the films A.I. Artificial Intelligence and Ex Machina, as well as the novel Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?, by Philip K. Dick. Dick considers the idea that our understanding of human subjectivity is altered by technology created with artificial intelligence.[399] The two most widely used textbooks in 2023 (see the Open Syllabus): These were the four of the most widely used AI textbooks in 2008: Other textbooks:",

                "title": "Want to Try AI With English Learners? Here’s Where to Start",
                "content": "Research on the efficacy of using generative artificial intelligence tools for English-language development is nascent. But initial examinations of AI’s role suggest the technology has the potential to improve instruction. There are challenges, of course. Teachers are worried about students using AI tools to cheat and that the technology can generate inaccurate or biased responses. Plus, some English learners might be too reverent about AI responses, rather than trusting their own thinking or writing. Despite those challenges, some teachers of English learners have been experimenting with generative artificial intelligence tools since they became easily accessible two years ago. For instance, some teachers are using ChatGPT to reduce Lexile levels—the measure for how difficult a text is—for their students. More broadly, one third of school and district administrators say they are using artificial intelligence technologies in programs serving multilingual learners, according to a nationally representative EdWeek Research Center survey of 1,135 educators conducted in September and October. Another 40 percent said they’re either “considering,” “exploring,” or “piloting” these tools. With more than a decade of experience studying multilingual learners, Avary Carhill-Poza, an associate professor of applied linguistics at the University of Massachusetts Boston, spoke with Education Week about ways to use AI with English learners. This interview has been edited for brevity and clarity. There are some emerging studies and findings about using things like ChatGPT in classrooms, but that’s a pretty narrow definition of AI. We might want to think a little more broadly and go back to things like Google Translate and Grammarly and some of the work that people have been doing over the last decade or two [thinking] about technologies that use AI and how schools and communities have really adapted those different technologies to their classrooms. The idea of using AI is not actually so new in our classrooms. One of the things that I would say to think about is—[in] that initial moment when we become aware of something new and it feels disruptive or threatening—the way that a conversation can turn from thinking about a [tool] to thinking about a practice, thinking about an app to thinking about a practice, thinking about AI to thinking about practice. What does that mean? Usually what that means is learning from parents and students. What are they already doing with this new technology—with AI in this case—and how does that align with or challenge the kinds of things that we’re doing in school right now? A lot of what goes into district thinking sometimes is like, “Can we get some PD for this?” And while that’s really helpful, I think we want to start with what our students already know, what their families and communities already know, and move toward what we can learn from and with them about the ways that they’re already using AI [and] bring that back into our classroom and our learning practices. Probably the biggest struggle for individual teachers and districts as a whole is how to engage with, how to really learn with families and communities. I had a conversation very recently with a mom who was going to have her daughter pick some things up on her way home from school, so she was texting her this list of ingredients. The high school student [who is still learning English] was doing some quick translations [using an AI-powered translation app] into English so that she’d know what to look for and get as she was running this errand on her way home. I have a student who’s doing a dissertation project where she’s interacting with a lot of students [face-to-face in their homes], and a lot of them use AI to summarize articles that they’re reading for class before they take a deep dive to find details that they need for certain things. She [commented] on how efficient she saw the students working when they were at home and using AI to do this. For multilingual learners, the key point is to really think about practices that let the students bring what they know to whatever task a teacher has, whatever learning objectives a teacher has. If what they know could encompass an overview of an article that they’re going to read, would that be helpful for the students? Would that be a way to support their learning, a part of a new or developing set of practices? If there’s a way to think about what students are doing and what they’re bringing to learning, it can lessen the fear that students aren’t doing the work or aren’t meeting expectations. If you spend a whole class period laboriously translating your way through an article, is that the best strategy for leveraging [background] knowledge and experience? Is there a way that the AI technologies that students are already using could support learning and maybe allow them to center more the kinds of knowledge and experience that they already have? It’s really taking a step back and trying to be open to processes that might support language learning and content learning in what you might consider unorthodox, and moving past the initial sense that the technology is going to be disruptive just because it’s not what you’ve been doing. If you are generating some sort of text with AI, you still need to go back and edit it and clarify and proofread and make sure it’s saying things that you’re interested in having it say. Students who are multilingual learners can feel, sometimes, that those texts are maybe better than what they would be able to say themselves or more correct. [It’s important to get] them to take it for what it is and feel comfortable using it when it’s most beneficial but not feeling bound up or reverent of the texts that are generated.

Moss first told viewers on Sunday, from the set of \"Sunday NFL Countdown,\" that he's facing an undisclosed medial issue and urged men to pay particular attention to health screenings. \"Pro Football Hall of Famer Randy Moss will step away from\" his Sunday morning pregame show in order \"to focus on a personal health challenge,\" according to an ESPN statement. “For nearly a decade, Randy has been an invaluable member of the team, consistently elevating ‘Countdown’ with his insight and passion. He has ESPN’s full support, and we look forward to welcoming him back when he is ready.” Former NFL quarterback Robert Griffin III asked his 2.2 million X followers to pray for Moss, who he credited with helping him break into TV. \"His kindness and open arms helped a brother out and is rare in any industry. Love him,\" Griffin wrote. In a pair of Instagram posts on Sunday, Moss said he was tackling a health issue. “I’m battling something, man, and it’s something internal. Your boy is going to get through it,” Moss continued. “I got a great team of doctors and got a great family around me.” While Moss, 47, didn’t disclose details of the illness he might be fighting, he pointedly told “all you men” to “get your blood work done and we’ll work through it.” The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force has suggested that recommends that adults 45 and older should be screened for colon cancer, and that men over 55 discuss whether they should be checked for prostate cancer. Heart disease, diabetes, blood pressure and cholesterol are also health challenges that could be subject for regularly screening. “At this time I just want to keep a lot of things private and you all just bear with me,\" Moss said this past Sunday. \"But like I said, I need your prayers.” Moss was inducted to the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 2018.

There has been no official word as of publishing time on the cause. If you're seeing this story on Facebook, you aren't one of the thousands of people affected by an outage to the social media giant on Wednesday afternoon. Here's the latest on the massive outages wreaking havoc on social media feeds and access around the globe. Around 12:30 p.m. ET, users started reporting issues with Facebook and other Meta platforms including Instagram. The outage tracking site downdetector.com registered more than 100,000 reports of Facebook outages by 1:00. More than 65,000 users reported Instagram outages to the site at the same point. The outage even affected Meta's homepage, with Meta.com displaying a \"Sorry, something went wrong, message to visitors as of 2 p.m. ET. On competing social media platform X, Meta verified they are aware of the outage and working to restore service, but did not comment on what is causing the issue. It seems no Meta platform has been spared, as Threads, WhatsApp, Messenger and even Oculus all saw a spike in reported outages Wednesday afternoon. Tiktok, which is not owned by Meta, also saw a spike in outages around the same time as the Meta platforms, though not nearly as widespread. Meta did not immediately reply to a request for comment from the USA TODAY network. By 3:30 p.m. ET, the number of outages being reported to down detector had dropped significantly, but still showed more than 10,000 reporting outages with Facebook and nearly 20,000 having issues with Instagram. Meta has not posted any updates to X on the cause or solution since their original post acknowledging the outage.",

                "content": "There has been a spike in Facebook and Instagram outages across the country since 1 p.m. At 1:20 p.m. ET, Downdetector, a website that tracks outages, showed over 105,00 reports of Facebook not working, with majority of those saying the issue comes from the app. The website also received 11,000 reports of problems with Facebook Messenger and 70,590 reports that Instagram was down, with 78 percent noting the issue stemmed from the app. Downdetector shows the brunt of the problem taking place in Chicago, with issues spanning the rest of the country as well. Newsweek reached out to a representative at Meta, the parent company for both social media platforms, for comment. \"We're aware that a technical issue is impacting some users' ability to access our apps,\" Meta posted to X, formerly known as Twitter, almost an hour after the outages started. \"We're working to get things back to normal as quickly as possible and apologize for any inconvenience.\" We’re aware that a technical issue is impacting some users’ ability to access our apps. We’re working to get things back to normal as quickly as possible and apologize for any inconvenience. Problems users are experiencing range from not being able to use the service's apps or websites to not being able to post or see comments. People have reported the apps showing them error messages, including Facebook saying \"we're working on getting this fixed as soon as we can.\" Meta owns and operates Facebook, Instagram, Threads and Whatsapp. Downdetector showed 8,234 reports of outages from Whatsapp users. Among those, 82 percent reported problems with sending messages. Threads has also seen a spike in its social media platform's outages, but the numbers are not as extreme as other Meta apps. Downdetector showed 892 outages for Threads, with 70 percent of the issue coming from the app itself. Originally known as Facebook, the company was rebranded in 2021 to \"reflect its focus on building the metaverse.\" The company is ranked among the largest American information technology companies, alongside Alphabet, Apple, Microsoft and Amazon. Meta faced similar outage issues nine months ago, when users were unable to log into Facebook, Instagram and Threads sites for several hours. \"Earlier today, a technical issue caused people to have difficulty accessing some of our services,\" Meta Communications Director Andy Stone said in a post on X, formerly known as Twitter, at the time. \"We resolved the issue as quickly as possible for everyone who was impacted, and we apologize for any inconvenience.\" For Facebook users at the time, they were often logged out of their accounts. Instagram users could not refresh their feeds, and people saw on Threads a message saying \"Sorry, something went wrong. Try again.\" The outage in March also spanned to some users' Meta Quest headsets. Meta also saw a major outage that affected Instagram and Facebook in October of 2022.

                "content": "Garrett Nolan Crochet (/kroʊˈʃeɪ/; born June 21, 1999) is an American professional baseball pitcher for the Boston Red Sox of Major League Baseball (MLB). He has previously played in MLB for the Chicago White Sox. He made his MLB debut in 2020. The White Sox selected Crochet with the 11th overall selection of the 2020 MLB draft out of the University of Tennessee. Crochet was called up in September by the White Sox to become the first MLB player in six years to reach the big leagues in the same year in which he was drafted.[1][2] Crochet grew up in Ocean Springs, Mississippi, and attended Ocean Springs High School. During his junior season, he posted a 3–0 win–loss record with a 0.51 earned run average (ERA) and 25 strikeouts in 27+2⁄3 innings pitched. Following the season, Crochet initially committed to play college baseball at Jones County Junior College.[3] As a senior, he went 6–4 with a 1.48 ERA and 76 strikeouts to draw late recruiting interest from many top collegiate programs, including Texas and Tennessee.[4][5] Crochet was selected by the Milwaukee Brewers in the 34th round of the 2017 Major League Baseball draft, but chose not to sign and instead enrolled at Tennessee.[6][7] As a true freshman at Tennessee in 2018, Crochet appeared in 17 games with 11 starts, posting a 5–6 record with a 5.51 ERA and 62 strikeouts.[8] In 2019, his sophomore year, he went 5–3 with a 4.02 ERA over 18 appearances (six starts), missing the SEC Tournament after suffering a broken jaw in his last regular season start.[9][10] After the season Crochet was invited to training camp for the United States Collegiate National Baseball Team,[11][12] and entered his junior season as a first team preseason All-American by Baseball America and on the watch list for the Golden Spikes Award.[13][14][15] Crochet missed the first three weeks of the season due to arm soreness,[16] then appeared in one game before the college baseball season was cut short due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The White Sox selected Crochet in the first round, with the 11th overall selection, in the 2020 Major League Baseball draft,[17] and he signed a contract on June 22, 2020, that included a $4,547,500 bonus.[18] On September 18, 2020, Crochet became the first player from the 2020 MLB Draft class to be promoted to the major leagues. He is the 22nd player to go straight from the draft to the majors without playing in the minor leagues, and the first since Mike Leake in 2010 and was the first player to be promoted in their draft year since Brandon Finnegan in 2014.[19] With the 2020 Chicago White Sox, Crochet appeared in five games, not allowing a run in six innings pitched while consistently throwing 100 miles per hour (160 km/h).[20][21] He came out of the bullpen to strike out both batters he faced in Chicago's 6–4 loss to the Oakland Athletics in the decisive Game 3 of the 2020 American League Wild Card Series before leaving with forearm tightness.[22] Crochet had his first full season in 2021, when he recorded a 2.82 ERA with 65 strikeouts in 54+1⁄3 innings. He would miss the entire 2022 season after undergoing Tommy John surgery on April 2.[23] In 2023, Crochet made his return from surgery, appearing in 13 games and recording a 3.55 ERA with 12 strikeouts across 12+2⁄3 innings pitched.[24] On March 18, 2024, Crochet was named the White Sox Opening Day starting pitcher.[25] In his first start, Crochet went 6 innings giving up 5 hits, one run, and striking out 8 batters in a 1–0 loss to the Detroit Tigers. He was named MLB Pitcher of the Month for June that year becoming the 17th White Sox pitcher to do so. In the month of June, Crochet went 1–1 with an ERA of 1.91 with a 0.93 WHIP in 37+2⁄3 innings while striking out 56 batters in six starts.[26] On July 7, Crochet would be named to his first All-Star Game in his career.[27] In the first half of the season, Crochet was 6–6 with an 3.02 ERA and a WHIP of 0.95 in 20 starts in 107+1⁄3 innings, while leading the league in strikeouts with 150 and strikeouts per 9 innings at 12.6. Crochet made 32 starts for the White Sox in 2024, posting a 3.58 ERA with 209 strikeouts across 146 innings pitched, setting a new career-high.[28] After the season, he was named AL Comeback Player of the Year.[29] On December 11, 2024, Crochet was traded to the Boston Red Sox in exchange for prospects Kyle Teel, Braden Montgomery, Chase Meidroth and Wikelman González.[30]",

                "content": "If not listed, please contact your TV provider. The Red Sox have acquired hard-throwing left-handed starting pitcher Garrett Crochet in a trade with the Chicago White Sox, the teams announced Wednesday. The return for the White Sox is catcher Kyle Teel, outfielder Braden Montgomery, infielder Chase Meidroth and right-handed pitcher Wikelman Gonzalez. Crochet, 25, is coming off a standout 2024 season for the White Sox – one in which he pitched as a member of a big-league rotation for the first time. In 2024, Crochet made 32 starts and pitched to a 3.58 ERA/115 ERA+ with an even more promising FIP of 2.69. Most impressively, he struck out 209 batters against 33 unintentional walks in 146 innings. While he didn't work a qualifying number of innings, Crochet led all regular starting pitchers with a strikeout rate of 35.1%. His fastball, which he threw more than half the time, averaged 97.2 mph – a sky-scraping figure for any pitcher, let alone a starter. Earlier in the offseason, CBS Sports ranked Crochet as one of the leading trade candidates of the winter. While Crochet's durability and capacity to handle a heavier workload are left to question, there's no doubting his ability to dominate, particularly at the swing-and-miss level. Crochet isn't slated for free agency until after the 2026 season, so he'll be going to the Red Sox with two remaining years of team control. He's arbitration-eligible for 2025, which will mean a substantial jump over the $800,000 salary he made in 2024. The Red Sox have been reportedly aggressive throughout the offseason with big targets, but before this deal have whiffed. They were in on both Juan Soto and Max Fried until the end, for example, before losing out the Mets and Yankees, respectively. Crochet now gives the Red Sox one left-hander and has the makings of the ace of the staff. If he throws like he's capable, the Boston rotation right now could look something like this: Remember that Lucas Giolito will return at some point from Tommy John surgery and it's always possible they add another starter from outside the organization. The Red Sox went 81-81, but should be aggressive in continuing to build around a talented core. As for the White Sox, Crochet's exit is part of an ongoing deep rebuild on the South Side of Chicago – one that led to them losing a modern-record 121 games during the 2024 season. Teel was the Red Sox's first-round pick in 2023 out of the University of Virginia. He rose to Triple-A last season, getting in 28 games of action there. In his 112 games between Double-A and Triple-A last year, he hit .288/.386/.433 with 23 doubles, 13 home runs, 78 RBI, 88 runs and 12 stolen bases. He played some outfield in college but has been a primary catcher in the pros. Montgomery, 21, was the Red Sox's first-rounder this past year out of Texas A&M. He didn't get a taste of professional ball after the draft, as he broke his ankle during the NCAA tournament. As a junior in college, he hit .322/.454/.733 with 27 homers in 61 games. Meidroth was a fourth-round pick in 2022. He played all season with Triple-A Worcester last season, seeing time at second base, third base and shortstop. In 122 games, the table-setter hit .293/.437/.401 with 13 stolen bases and 87 runs. Gonzalez, 22, started 19 games and came in relief five times in Double-A last season, pitching to a 4.73 ERA and 1.26 WHIP with 92 strikeouts against 46 walks in 83 ⅔ innings. © 2004-2024 CBS Interactive.

                "content": "College Baseball, MLB Draft, Prospects – Baseball America Image credit: Garrett Crochet (Photo by Melissa Tamez/Icon Sportswire via Getty Images) As the Winter Meetings neared their conclusion, the Red Sox reportedly swung a deal with the White Sox to acquire lefthanded fireballer Garrett Crochet and place him atop their rotation. The move answers the one the rival Yankees made a day earlier when they signed former Braves lefty Max Fried to a long-term deal. In return, the White Sox buttressed their farm system with a package of prospects that included the team’s last two first-rounders—catcher Kyle Teel and outfielder Braden Montgomery—as well as infielder Chase Meidroth and righthander Wikelman Gonzalez, according to The Athletic’s Ken Rosenthal. RED SOX RECEIVE – LHP Garrett CrochetWHITE SOX RECEIVE – C Kyle Teel (Boston's No. 4 Prospect)– OF Braden Montgomery (Boston's No. 6 Prospect) – SS Chase Meidroth (Boston's No. 8 Prospect)– RHP Wikelman GonzalezScouting reports⬇️ (Trade returns per Ken Rosenthal)… Crochet will jump to the front of a rotation that also includes Tanner Houck, Brayan Bello and Kutter Crawford and could also add Lucas Giolito this season after he finishes recovering from Tommy John surgery. Crochet will not be a free agent until 2027. Garrett Crochet, LHPAge: 25 After making his big league debut in 2020, Crochet returned in 2021 and spent the entire year in the bullpen. He missed 2022 while recovering from Tommy John surgery, then transitioned into the rotation in 2024. He made 32 starts, struck out 209 hitters—good for seventh-most in the sport—and made the American League all-star team. Kyle Teel, CAge: 22 Teel was Boston’s first-round selection in 2023 out of Virginia. The 14th overall pick jumped directly to High-A in his first pro test and reached Triple-A by the end of the 2024 season. He ranked as Boston’s No. 4 prospect. The lefty swinger can shoot balls from line to line and produces plenty of premium exit velocities. He spent his first full season as a pro adapting to the one-knee-down set up and as a result was an inconsistent framer and blocker. He could be an average catcher with further reps and has above-average arm strength. Now, he’ll battle it out with current White Sox prospect Edgar Quero for the role of Chicago’s catcher of the future. Braden Montgomery, OFAge: 21 By acquiring Montgomery and Teel, the White Sox now have Boston’s last two first-round picks. Montgomery started his college career at Stanford before transferring to Texas A&M for his draft year. The former two-way talent shifted solely into the batter’s box with the Aggies, and helped lead them to the College World Series. His season ended early when he fractured his ankle during the run-up to the CWS. In his final season in college station, Montgomery showed sound swing decisions but still produced high miss and zone-miss rates. Still, he did a good job hammering balls when he made contact and should be a threat to club plenty of home runs once he makes his official pro debut. The switch-hitting Montgomery was far more productive from the left side. He’s likely a corner outfielder, and the arm strength that allowed him to throw 96 mph off the mound should translate nicely to right field. He has a future as a power-over-hit outfielder. Chase Meidroth, SSAge: 23 Meidroth was the Red Sox’s fourth-round pick in 2022 out of the University of San Diego. He did a great job staying within the strike zone and finished the year with a chase rate of just 17%. In fact, he didn’t take the bat off his shoulders much at all, with an overall swing rate of just 30%. Those bat-to-ball skills should translate to the big leagues and give him a future as an above-average hitter, albeit with below-average power. Meidroth moved around the infield at Triple-A Worcester and should be capable of handling second or third base and even manning shortstop in a pinch. Moving from Boston to Chicago should give him a much clearer path to the big leagues, and he could get there in 2025. Wikelman Gonzalez, RHPAge: 22 Gonzalez signed out of Venezuela in 2018 and has steadily matriculated through the minor leagues, sometimes with inconsistent results and dominant second halves. The righthander’s fastball presents a puzzling combination of mid-90s velocity, riding life through the zone and deception created by a lower release height. He backs the fastball with a cutter designed to avoid barrels and a splitter that dives beneath them. Gonzalez shows a sound feel for spin but hasn’t yet developed an average breaking pitch. His slider is the closest, checking in as a fringe-average offering. Baseball America provides detailed breakdowns for each player selected in the MLB phase of the 2024 Rule 5 draft.

                "content": "The Paralympic Games or Paralympics is a periodic series of international multisport events involving athletes with a range of disabilities. There are Winter and Summer Paralympic Games, which since the 1988 Summer Olympics in Seoul, South Korea, have been held shortly after the corresponding Olympic Games. All Paralympic Games are governed by the International Paralympic Committee (IPC). The Paralympics began as a small gathering of British World War II veterans in 1948. The 1960 Games in Rome drew 400 athletes with disabilities from 23 countries, as proposed by doctor Antonio Maglio. Currently it is one of the largest international sporting events: the 2020 Summer Paralympics featuring 4,520 athletes from 163 National Paralympic Committees.[1] Paralympians strive for equal treatment with non-disabled Olympic athletes, but there is a large funding gap between Olympic and Paralympic athletes.[2][circular reporting?] The Paralympic Games are organized in parallel with and in a similar way to the Olympic Games. The IOC-recognized Special Olympics World Games include athletes with intellectual disabilities (although since 1992, people with intellectual disabilities also participate in the Paralympic Games), and the Deaflympics held since 1924 are exclusive for deaf athletes.[3][4] Given the wide variety of disabilities of Para athletes, there are several categories in which they compete. The allowable disabilities are divided into ten eligible impairment types: impaired muscle power, impaired passive range of movement, limb deficiency, leg length difference, short stature, hypertonia, ataxia, athetosis, vision impairment and intellectual impairment.[5] These categories are further divided into various subcategories. Athletes with disabilities did compete at the Olympic Games prior to the advent of the Paralympics. The first athlete to do so was German-American gymnast George Eyser in 1904, who had one artificial leg. Olivér Halassy, a Hungarian amputee water polo player, competed in three successive Olympic Games, beginning in 1928.[6] Hungarian Károly Takács competed in shooting events in both the 1948 and 1952 Summer Olympics. He was a right-arm amputee and could shoot left-handed. Another athlete with a disability who appeared in the Olympics prior to the Paralympic Games was Lis Hartel, a Danish equestrian athlete who had contracted polio in 1943 and won a silver medal in the dressage event in the 1952 Summer Olympics.[7] The first organized athletic event for athletes with disabilities that coincided with the Olympic Games took place on the day of the opening of the 1948 Summer Olympics in London. The German-Jewish doctor Ludwig Guttmann, of Stoke Mandeville Hospital,[8] who had fled Nazi Germany with the help of the Council for Assisting Refugee Academics (CARA) in 1939,[9] hosted a sports competition for British World War II veteran patients with spinal cord injuries. The first games were called the 1948 International Wheelchair Games, and were intended to coincide with the 1948 Olympics.[10] Guttman's aim was to create an elite sports competition for people with disabilities that would be equivalent to the Olympic Games. The games were held at the same location each year, and in 1952 Dutch and Israeli veterans took part alongside the British, making it the first international competition of its own kind. In 1960, the 9th annual games took place outside of the UK for the first time in Rome, to coincide with the 1960 Summer Olympics which were also being held in Rome. These were to be later designated the 1st Paralympic Games.[11] These early competitions have been described as the precursors of the Paralympic Games, and Stoke Mandeville holds a similar place in the history of the Paralympic movement as Greece holds in the Olympic Games; since 2012, the Paralympic flame has incorporated a \"heritage flame\" lit at Stoke Mandeville, although it was combined with flames lit in the host country for the formal start of the torch relay. Beginning in 2024, future Paralympic torch relays will officially begin in Stoke Mandeville, as an equivalent to the Olympic flame being created in Olympia.[12][13][14] There have been several milestones in the Paralympic movement. The first official Paralympic Games, coincident with the ninth Stoke Mandeville Games but no longer open solely to war veterans, was held in Rome in 1960.[15] They were the brainchild of Antonio Maglio, a friend and follower of Guttmann and were financed almost entirely by Maglio's employer, the Workers National Accident Insurance Fund of Italy, then led by Renato Morelli, who was also Chairman of the International Social Security Association.[16] Four hundred athletes from 23 countries competed at the 1960 Games. Since 1960, the Paralympic Games have taken place in the same year as the Olympic Games.[17][18] The Games were initially open only to athletes in wheelchairs; at the 1976 Summer Games, athletes with different disabilities were included for the first time at a Summer Paralympics.[10] With the inclusion of more disability classifications the 1976 Summer Games expanded to 1,600 athletes from 40 countries.[17] The 1988 Summer Paralympics in Seoul was another milestone for the Paralympic movement. It was in Seoul that the Paralympic Summer Games were held directly after the 1988 Summer Olympics, in the same host city, and using the majority of the venues. This set a precedent that was followed in 1992, 1996 and 2000. It was eventually formalized in an agreement between the International Paralympic Committee (IPC) and the International Olympic Committee (IOC) in 2001,[17][19] and was extended through 2020.[20] On March 10, 2018, the two committees further extended their contract to 2032.[21] Despite being held in the same region, the 1992 Winter Paralympics used different competition venues than those used for the Olympic Games. 1994 Winter Paralympics were the first Winter Games to use the same venues and had the same Organizing Committee as the Winter Olympics. The first Winter Paralympic Games were held in 1976 in Örnsköldsvik, Sweden. This was the first Paralympics in which multiple categories of athletes with disabilities could compete.[17] The Winter Games were celebrated every four years on the same year as their summer counterpart, just as the Olympics were. This tradition was upheld through the 1992 Games in Albertville, France; after that, beginning with the 1994 Games, the Winter Paralympics and the Winter Olympics have been held in those even-numbered years separate from the Summer Olympics. The winter games happen two years after the summer games.[17] The International Paralympic Committee is the global governing body of the Paralympic Movement. It comprises 178[22] National Paralympic Committees (NPC) and four disability-specific international sports federations.[23] The president of the IPC is Andrew Parsons. The IPC's international headquarters are in Bonn, Germany.[24] The IPC is responsible for organizing the Summer and Winter Paralympic Games. It also serves as the International Federation for nine sports (Paralympic athletics, Paralympic swimming, Paralympic archery, Paralympic powerlifting, Para-alpine skiing, Paralympic biathlon, Paralympic cross-country skiing, ice sledge hockey and Wheelchair DanceSport). This requires the IPC to supervise and coordinate the World Championships and other competitions for each of the nine sports it regulates.[25] IPC membership also includes National Paralympic Committees[22] and international sporting federations.[26] International Federations are independent sport federations recognized by the IPC as the sole representative of a Paralympic Sport. International Federations responsibilities include technical jurisdiction and guidance over the competition and training venues of their respective sports during the Paralympic Games. The IPC also recognizes media partners, certifies officials, judges, and is responsible for enforcing the bylaws of the Paralympic Charter.[27] Since its creation in 1989, IPC has a cooperative relationship with the International Olympic Committee (IOC). Delegates of the IPC are also members of the IOC and participate on IOC committees and commissions. The two governing bodies remain distinct, with separate Games, despite the close working relationship.[28] The Paralympic Games were designed to emphasize the participants' athletic achievements and not their disability. Recent games have emphasized that these games are about ability and not disability.[25] The movement has grown dramatically since its early days – for example, the number of athletes participating in the Summer Paralympic Games has increased from 400 athletes in Rome in 1960 to 4,342 athletes from 159 countries in Rio de Janeiro in 2016.[29] Both the Paralympic Summer and Winter Games are recognized on the world stage. Unlike the Olympic Games, English is the official language of the Paralympic movement. The other languages used at each Paralympic Games are the official languages of the host country or host region. Every proclamation (such as the announcement of each country during the parade of nations in the opening ceremony) is spoken in these two or more languages. Although the name was originally coined as a portmanteau combining paraplegic (due to its origins as games for people with spinal injuries) and Olympic,[30] the inclusion of other disability groups meant that this was no longer considered very accurate. The present formal explanation for the name is that it derives from the Greek preposition παρά, pará ('beside' or 'alongside') and thus refers to a competition held in parallel with the Olympic Games.[31] The Summer Games of 1988 held in Seoul was the first time the term Paralympic came into official use. \"Spirit in Motion\" is the current motto for the Paralympic movement. The current Paralympic flag is used since 2020 and contains three colours, red, blue, and green, which are the colours most widely represented in the flags of nations. The colours are each in the shape of an Agito (which is Latin for 'I move/I shake/I stir'), which is the name given to an asymmetrical crescent specially designed for the Paralympic movement. The three Agitos circle a central point, which is a symbol for the athletes congregating from all points of the globe.[32] The motto and symbol of the IPC were changed in 2003 to their current versions. The change was intended to convey the idea that Paralympians have a spirit of competition and that the IPC as an organization realizes its potential and is moving forward to achieve it. The vision of the IPC is, \"To enable Paralympic athletes to achieve sporting excellence and to inspire and excite the world.\"[33] The Paralympic anthem is \"Hymne de l'Avenir\" or \"Anthem of the Future\". It was composed by Thierry Darnis and adopted as the official anthem in March 1996.[34] As mandated by the Paralympic Charter, various elements frame the opening ceremonies of the Paralympic Games. Most of these rituals were established are the same that 1920 Summer Olympics in Antwerp and were shared with the Olympic Games.[35] The Opening ceremony typically starts with the hoisting of the host country's flag and a performance of its national anthem. Immediately after the welcome act and the host country anthem and hosting their flag the \"Parade of Nations\" starts with the athletes into the stadium grouped by nation. Since the 1960 Summer Paralympics, the nations enter the stadium alphabetically according to the host country's or region official language, though with the host country's athletes being the last to enter. Beginning with the 2020 Summer Paralympics, the succeeding hosts of the respective Olympic Games (summer or winter) will enter immediately before the current host in descending order. The host nation presents artistic displays of their culture and folklore. Protocolary segments are held with the speeches given, formally opening the games. After the opening declaration, the Paralympic flag enters the stadium and is hosted along with the Paralympic Anthem, aside from the host country flag, and the oaths by athletes, coaches, and judges are taken. Finally, the Paralympic flame is brought into the stadium and passed on until it reaches the final torch carrier—often a Paralympic athlete from the host nation—who lights the Paralympic flame in the stadium's cauldron.[36] The closing ceremony of the Paralympic Games takes place after all sporting events have concluded. Flag-bearers from each participating country enter, followed by the athletes who enter together, without any national distinction. The Paralympic flag is taken down. Since the 1988 Winter Paralympics, with some exceptions, the national flag of the country hosting the next Summer or Winter Paralympic Games is hoisted while the corresponding national anthem is played. The games are officially closed, and the Paralympic flame is extinguished.[37] After these compulsory elements, the next host nation briefly introduces itself with artistic displays of dance and theater representative of its culture. A medals ceremony is held after the conclusion of each Paralympic event. The winner, second and third-place competitors or teams stand on top of a three-tiered rostrum when they are awarded their respective medal by an IPC member. The national flags of the medalists are then raised while the national anthem of the gold medalist is played.[38] Volunteering citizens of the host country also act as hosts during the medal ceremonies, as they aid the officials who present the medals and act as flag-bearers.[39] For every Paralympic event, the respective medal ceremony is held, at most, one day after the event's final. In June 2001, the International Olympic Committee (IOC) and the International Paralympic Committee (IPC) signed an agreement that would ensure that the staging of the Paralympic Games is automatically included in the bid for the Olympic Games.[40] The agreement was set to take effect at the 2008 Paralympic Summer Games in Beijing and the 2010 Paralympic Winter Games in Vancouver. However, the Salt Lake 2002 Organizing Committee (SLOC) chose to follow the practice of \"one bid, one city\", with one Organizing Committee for both Games, which was followed up by the 2004 Summer Games in Athens. The agreement was adjusted in 2003. An extension was signed in June 2006, after some troubles at the 2006 Winter Paralympics.[40] Initially agreed to remain in effect until the 2012 Summer Olympics,[17] this was later extended to encompass all Summer and Winter games up until the 2020 Summer Olympics.[41][42] Even beyond this, all Summer and Winter host cities currently[update] announced are preparing pairs of Olympic and Paralympics Games. This was further confirmed when on 10 March 2018, the IOC and the IPC agreed to further extend the contract to the 2032 Summer Olympics.[21] The IOC has written its commitment to equal access to athletics for all people into its charter, which states,[43] The practice of sport is a human right. Every individual must have the possibility of practising sport, without discrimination of any kind and in the Olympic spirit, which requires mutual understanding with a spirit of friendship, solidarity and fair play....Any form of discrimination with regard to a country or a person on grounds of race, religion, politics, gender or otherwise is incompatible with belonging to the Olympic Movement. While the charter is silent on discrimination specifically related to disability; given the language in the charter regarding discrimination it is reasonable to infer that discrimination on the basis of disability would be against the ideals of the Olympic Charter and the IOC.[44] This is also consistent with the Paralympic Charter, which forbids discrimination on the basis of political, religious, economic, disability, gender, sexual orientation or racial reasons.[45] Chairman of the London organising committee, Sebastian Coe, said about the 2012 Summer Paralympics and 2012 Summer Olympics in London, England, that, \"We want to change public attitudes towards disability, celebrate the excellence of Paralympic sport and to enshrine from the very outset that the two Games are an integrated whole.\"[46] The 2014 Winter Paralympic Games is the first such Paralympics hosted by Russia. Russia ratified the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities during that period. Notably at 2010 Vancouver, their Paralympic team topped the medal table at the Winter Paralympics, while their Olympic team performed well below expectations at the Winter Olympics. This led the media to highlight the contrast between the achievements of the country's Olympic and Paralympic delegations, despite the greater attention and funding awarded to the Olympic athletes.[47] The Russian Federation organizers of the 2014 Winter Paralympic Games have, since 2007, made efforts to make the host city Sochi more accessible.[48] In 2012, as part of its prohibition on unauthorised advertising, the Paralympic movement began requiring any tattoo of the Olympic rings to be covered during competition, on the basis that the Olympics is technically a third-party organisation. In 2024 the prohibition was ended after protests from athletes.[49] Paralympic athletes have sought equal opportunities to compete at the Olympic Games. The precedent was set by Neroli Fairhall, a Paralympic archer from New Zealand, who competed at the 1984 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles.[50] In 2008, Oscar Pistorius, a South African sprinter, attempted to qualify for the 2008 Summer Olympics. Pistorius had both his legs amputated below the knee and races with two carbon fibre blades manufactured by Össur. He holds the Paralympic world record in the 400 meter event.[51] Pistorius missed qualifying for the 2008 Summer Olympics in the 400 meter race, by 0.70 seconds. He qualified for the 2008 Summer Paralympics where he won gold medals in the 100, 200, and 400 meter sprints.[52] In 2011, Pistorius qualified for the 2012 Summer Olympics and competed in two events: he made the semi-final in the 400 metres race; and his team came 8th in the final of the 4 × 400 metres relay race.[53] Even though all athletes are given equal opportunities to participate in these events, such as the 400 meter race, there has been growing criticism that the games may not be fair to all athletes. For example, athletes running a race with a left prosthetic leg may be disadvantaged compared to those with a right side prosthesis because the races are run in an anticlockwise direction, giving some athletes an advantage.[54] Some athletes without a disability also compete at the Paralympics. The sighted guides for athletes with a visual impairment are such a close and essential part of the competition that the athlete with visual impairment and the guide are considered a team, and both athletes are medal candidates.[55] Starting at the 1992 Summer Paralympics, recent games have also been supported by contributions from major sponsors. Unlike the Olympics, where the IOC mandates that arenas be clean of sponsor logos, the Paralympics do allow the logos of official sponsors to be displayed inside arenas and on uniforms.[56] While the Olympic Games have experienced tremendous growth in global media coverage since the 1984 Summer Paralympics, the Paralympics had been slower to develop a consistent mainstream media presence. In June 2023, IPC executives noted that interest in the Paralympics had been improving among broadcasters, citing that that it had already reached rights deals for the 2024 Summer Paralympics covering 75% of the world over a year in advance (in comparison to 2020, where many deals were made \"last minute\"), and that it had been pushing for broader coverage and increased rights fees since broadcasters were starting to \"[realize] that [the Paralympics are] actually a great sporting event\", and not treat them as a low-effort obligation bundled with their Olympics rights. Unlike the Olympics, the IPC holds the digital rights to the Paralympics in some markets, allowing it to promote live coverage and other highlights via its own social media platforms to engage online audiences.[57] Television broadcasts of Paralympic Games began in 1976, but this early coverage was confined to tape-delayed broadcasts to one nation or region. At the 1992 Summer Paralympics, there were 45 hours of live coverage but it was available only in Europe. Other countries broadcast highlight packages during the Games. No meaningful improvements in coverage occurred until the 2000 Summer Paralympics in Sydney. The 2000 Paralympics represented a significant increase in global media exposure for the Paralympic Games. A deal was reached between the Sydney Paralympic Organizing Committee (SPOC) and All Media Sports (AMS) to broadcast the Games internationally. Deals were reached with Asian, South American, and European broadcast companies to distribute coverage to as many markets as possible. The Games were also webcast for the first time. Because of these efforts, the Sydney Paralympics reached a global audience estimated at 300 million people.[58] Also significant was the fact that the organizers did not have to pay networks to televise the Games as had been done at the 1992 and 1996 Games.[59] Despite these advances, consistent media attention has been a challenge, which was evidenced in the coverage in Great Britain of the 2010 Winter Paralympics. The BBC was criticized for its minimal coverage of the 2010 Winter Paralympics as compared to its coverage of the 2010 Winter Olympics. The BBC announced it would stream some content on its website and show a one-hour highlight program after the Games ended. For the Winter Olympics the BBC aired 160 hours of coverage. The response from the BBC was that budget constraints and the \"time zone factor\" necessitated a limited broadcast schedule.[60] The reduction in coverage was done in spite of increased ratings for the 2008 Summer Paralympics, which was watched by 23% of the population of Great Britain.[60] In Norway, the Norwegian Broadcasting Corporation (NRK) broadcast 30 hours of the 2010 Winter Games live. NRK-sport were critical of parts of the TV production from Vancouver, and notified the EBU of issues such as the biathlon coverage excluding the shooting, and cross-country skiing with skiers in the distance, making it hard to follow the progress of the competition. NRK were far more pleased with the production of the ice sledge hockey and wheelchair curling events, which they felt reached the same level as the Olympic Games.[61] Not all Paralympic events have received television coverage; the IPC and its organisers currently contract with the IOC's media unit Olympic Broadcasting Services (OBS) to produce the broadcast feeds for the Paralympics. At the Summer Paralympics, coverage was limited to 16 sports in 2016, but increased to 19 sports in 2020. In 2024, all 22 Summer Paralympic sports were televised for the first time.[57] In the UK, Channel 4 assumed the television rights beginning in the 2012 Summer Paralympics, promising major increases in coverage on television and digital platforms, efforts to heighten the Games' profile, and commitments to incorporate people with disabilities among its staff and presenters.[62][63] Its coverage of the Paralympics have been promoted through major marketing campaigns; several of its advertisements have won Cannes Lions awards, with its trailer for 2016 \"We're the Superhumans\" receiving an overall Grand Prix award.[64][65] In January 2020, the Paralympics were classified as a Category A \"listed\" event by the British telecom regulator Ofcom as with the Olympics, mandating that they be broadcast in whole or in part by a free-to-air network, as with the Olympics.[66] Channel 4 reported that its coverage of the 2024 Summer Paralympics was seen by a total audience of 20 million, with the channel achieving its highest viewer share since the 2012 Paralympics.[67] A 2010 study by the University of British Columbia (UBC) on the Olympic Games Impact (OGI), showed that of roughly 1,600 Canadian respondents, 41 to 50 percent believed the 2010 Paralympic and Olympic Games in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada, triggered additional accessibility of buildings, sidewalks and public spaces. 23 percent of employers said the Games had increased their willingness to hire people with disabilities.[68] Chief Executive Officer for the International Paralympic Committee Xavier Gonzalez said about the 2008 Summer Paralympics in Beijing, China, that: In China, the (Paralympic) Games were really a transformation tool for changing attitudes across the board in China towards people with disability, to building accessibility facilities in the city, to changing laws to allow people with a disability to be part of society.[69] Within the framework of the International Olympic Committee's commitment to equal access to athletics, concerns have been raised regarding inclusion of athletes with Down syndrome in the Paralympic Games. While the Paralympic movement strives for inclusivity, the absence of a specific classification for athletes with Down syndrome within Paralympic swimming events raises questions about equal and fair competition for Down syndrome athletes. International Paralympic Committee Para-swimming classification codes are based upon single impairment only, whereas Down syndrome individuals have both physical and intellectual impairments. Although swimmers with Down syndrome are able to compete in the S14 intellectual impairment category (provided they score low in IQ tests), they are often outmatched by the superior physicality of their opponents.[70][71] At present there is no designated Paralympic category for swimmers with Down syndrome, meaning they have to compete as intellectually disadvantaged athletes. This disregards their physical disabilities.[72][73] A number of advocacy groups globally have been lobbying for the inclusion of a distinct classification category for Down syndrome swimmers within the IPC Classification Codes framework.[74] Initiatives aimed at promoting greater inclusivity within the Paralympic movement have emerged, including advocacy and awareness-raising efforts targeting discrimination and ensuring equal opportunities for athletes with Down syndrome.[75] Despite ongoing advocacy, the issue remains unresolved, and swimmers with Down syndrome continue to face challenges in accessing appropriate classification pathways.[76] The International Paralympic Committee (IPC) has established ten disability categories. Athletes are divided within each category according to their level of impairment, in a functional classification system which differs from sport to sport. The IPC has established ten disability categories, including physical, visual, and intellectual impairment. Athletes with one of these disabilities can compete in the Paralympics, though not every sport can allow for every disability category. These categories apply to both Summer and Winter Paralympics.[77] Physical Impairment – There are eight different types of physical impairment: Visual impairment – Athletes with visual impairment ranging from partial vision, sufficient to be judged legally blind, to total blindness. This includes impairment of one or more component of the visual system (eye structure, receptors, optic nerve pathway, and visual cortex).[77] The sighted guides for athletes with a visual impairment are such a close and essential part of the competition that the athlete with visual impairment and the guide are considered a team. Beginning in 2012, these guides along with sighted goalkeepers in 5-a-side football became eligible to receive medals of their own.[55][78] Intellectual Disability – Athletes with a significant intellectual impairment and associated limitations in adaptive behaviour. The IPC primarily serves athletes with physical disabilities, but the disability group Intellectual Disability has been added to some Paralympic Games. This includes only elite athletes with intellectual disabilities diagnosed before the age of 18.[77] However, the IOC-recognized Special Olympics World Games are open to all people with intellectual disabilities.[4] Within the disability categories, athletes are further divided into Sport Classes according to the degree of activity limitation resulting from their impairments; this aims to minimise the impact of an athlete's impairment on their sporting performance against their rivals. Sport Classes are numbered, with a lower number signifying a greater level of impairment: for example, in Paralympic swimming athletes with visual impairments compete in three Sport Classes from S/SB11 to S/SB13, with S/SB11 athletes having a very low light acuity and/or no light perception, and S/SB13 athletes having the least severe visual impairment eligible for Paralympic sport.[79] From its inception until the 1980s, the Paralympic system for classifying athletes consisted of a medical evaluation and diagnosis of impairment. An athlete's medical condition was the only factor used to determine what class they competed in. For example, an athlete who had a spinal cord injury that resulted in lower limb paresis, would not compete in the same wheelchair race as an athlete with a double above-knee amputation. The fact that their disability caused the same impairment did not factor into classification determination, the only consideration was their medical diagnosis. It was not until views on disabled athletics shifted from just a form of rehabilitation to an end in itself, that the classification system changed from medical diagnosis to a focus on the functional abilities of the athlete.[80] While there is no clear date when the shift occurred, a functional classification system became the norm for disabled athletic classification in the 1980s. In a functional system, the focus is on what effect the athlete's impairment has on his or her athletic performance. Under this system, athletes with total loss of function in their legs will compete together in most sports, because their functional loss is the same and the reason for the loss is immaterial. The only exception to the functional system is the classification format used by International Blind Sports Federation (IBSA), which still uses a medically based system.[80] Some sports are only held for certain disability types. For example, goalball is only for visually impaired athletes. The Paralympics recognizes three different grades of visual impairment, consequently all competitors in goalball must wear a visor or \"black out mask\" so that athletes with less visual impairment will not have an advantage.[81] Other sports, like athletics, are open to athletes with a wide variety of impairments. In athletics, participants are broken down into a range of classes based on the disability they have and then they are placed in a classification within that range based on their level of impairment. For example: classes 11–13 are for visually impaired athletes, which class they are in depends on their level of visual impairment.[82] There are also team competitions such as wheelchair rugby. Members of the team are each given a point value based on their activity limitation. A lower score indicates a more severe activity limitation than a higher score. A team cannot have more than a certain maximum total of points on the field of play at the same time to ensure equal competition. For example, in wheelchair rugby, the four players' combined disability number must total no more than eight points.[83] There are twenty-two sports on the Summer Paralympic program and six sports on the Winter Paralympics program. Within some of the sports are several events. For example, alpine skiing has downhill, super combined, super-G, slalom, giant slalom. The IPC has governance over several of the sports but not all of them. Other international organizations, known as International Sports Federations (IF), notably the International Wheelchair and Amputee Sports Federation (IWAS), the International Blind Sports Federation (IBSA), and the Cerebral Palsy International Sports and Recreation Association (CP-ISRA), govern some sports that are specific to certain disability groups.[84] There are national chapters for these International Sport Federations including National Paralympic Committees, which are responsible for recruitment of athletes and governance of sports at the national level.[85] After the 2000 Sydney games, a Spanish basketball player alleged that several members of the gold medal-winning Spanish basketball team with intellectual disabilities (ID) did not have disabilities. He claimed that only two athletes out of the twelve-member team met the qualifications of an athlete with an intellectual disability.[86] A controversy ensued and the International Paralympic Committee (IPC) called on the Spanish National Paralympic Committee to launch an investigation.[87] The investigation uncovered several Spanish athletes who had flouted the ID rules. In an interview with the president of the federation that oversees ID competition, Fernando Martín Vicente admitted that athletes around the world were breaking the ID eligibility rules. The IPC responded by starting an investigation of its own.[86] The results of the IPC's investigation confirmed the Spanish athlete's allegations and also determined that the incident was not isolated to the basketball ID event or to Spanish athletes.[86] As a result, all ID competitions were suspended indefinitely.[88] The ban was lifted after the 2008 Games after work had been done to tighten the criteria and controls governing admission of athletes with intellectual disabilities. Four sports, swimming, athletics, table tennis and rowing, were anticipated to hold competitions for ID athletes at the 2012 Summer Paralympics.[89][90] The Paralympics have also been tainted by steroid use. At the 2008 Games in Beijing, three powerlifters and a German basketball player were banned after having tested positive for banned substances.[89] This was a decrease in comparison to the ten powerlifters and one track athlete who were banned from the 2000 Games.[91] German skier Thomas Oelsner became the first Winter Paralympian to test positive for steroids. He had won two gold medals at the 2002 Winter Paralympics, but his medals were stripped after his positive drug test.[92] At the 2010 Winter Paralympics in Vancouver, Swedish curler Glenn Ikonen tested positive for a banned substance and was suspended for six months[93] by the IPC. He was removed from the rest of the curling competition but his team was allowed to continue. The 54-year-old curler said his doctor had prescribed a medication on the banned substances list.[94][95] Another concern now facing Paralympic officials is the technique of \"boosting\". Athletes can artificially increase their blood pressure, often by self-harming, which has been shown to improve performance by up to 15%. This is most effective in the endurance sports such as cross-country skiing. To increase blood pressure athletes will deliberately cause trauma to limbs below a spinal injury. This trauma can include breaking bones, strapping extremities in too tightly, and using high-pressure compression stockings. The injury is painless but it does affect the athlete's blood pressure.[96] Another potential concern is the use of gene therapy among Paralympic athletes. All Paralympic athletes are banned from enhancing their abilities through gene doping, but it is extremely difficult to differentiate these concepts.[97] The World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) is currently researching both gene doping and gene therapy, in part to discern the boundary between the two closely related concepts.[98] The IPC have been working with WADA since 2003, to ensure compliance with WADA's anti-doping code among its Paralympic athletes.[99] The IPC has also promised to continue increasing the number of athletes tested at each of its Games, in order to further minimize the possible effect of doping in Paralympic sports.[99] Mandatory in- and out-of competition testing has also been implemented by the IPC to further ensure all of its athletes are performing in compliance with WADA regulations.[99] Having sent samples for forensic analysis, the IPC found evidence that the prevalent doping by Russian athletes was in operation at the 2014 Winter Paralympics in Sochi.[100] On 7 August 2016, the IPC's Governing Board voted unanimously to ban the entire Russian team from the 2016 Summer Paralympics, citing the Russian Paralympic Committee's inability to enforce the IPC's Anti-Doping Code and the World Anti-Doping Code which is \"a fundamental constitutional requirement\".[100] IPC President Sir Philip Craven stated that the Russian government had \"catastrophically failed its Para athletes\".[101] IPC Athletes' Council Chairperson and CPC Member Todd Nicholson said that Russia had used athletes as \"pawns\" in order to \"show global prowess\".[102] Trischa Zorn of the United States is the most decorated paralympian in history. She competed in the blind swimming events and won a total of 55 medals, 41 of which are gold. Her Paralympic career spanned 24 years from 1980 to 2004. She was also an alternate on the 1980 American Olympic swim team, but did not go to the Olympics due to a boycott by the United States and several of its allies.[103][104] Ragnhild Myklebust of Norway holds the record for the most medals ever won at the Winter Paralympic Games. Competing in a variety of events between 1988 and 2002, she won a total of 22 medals, of which 17 were gold. After winning five gold medals at the 2002 Games she retired at the age of 58.[105] Neroli Fairhall, a paraplegic archer from New Zealand, was the first paraplegic competitor, and the third Paralympian, to participate in the Olympic Games, when she competed in the 1984 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles. She placed thirty-fourth in the Olympic archery competition, and won a Paralympic gold medal in the same event.[50] a Postponed to 2021, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, marking the first time that the Paralympic Games has been postponed. They are still called the 2020 Summer Paralympics, even with the change in scheduling to one year later.[138] The Games were held from 24 August to 5 September 2021.[139]",

                "content": "Sport for athletes with an impairment has existed for more than 100 years, and the first sport clubs for the deaf were already in existence in 1888 in Berlin. It was not until after World War II however, that it was widely introduced. The purpose of it at that time was to assist the large number of war veterans and civilians who had been injured during wartime. In 1944, at the request of the British Government, Dr. Ludwig Guttmann opened a spinal injuries centre at the Stoke Mandeville Hospital in Great Britain, and in time, rehabilitation sport evolved to recreational sport and then to competitive sport. STOKE MANDEVILLE GAMES On 29 July 1948, the day of the Opening Ceremony of the London 1948 Olympic Games, Dr. Guttmann organised the first competition for wheelchair athletes which he named the Stoke Mandeville Games, a milestone in Paralympic history. They involved 16 injured servicemen and women who took part in archery. In 1952, Dutch ex-servicemen joined the Movement and the International Stoke Mandeville Games were founded. FIRST PARALYMPIC GAMES The Stoke Mandeville Games later became the Paralympic Games which first took place in Rome, Italy, in 1960 featuring 400 athletes from 23 countries. Since then they have taken place every four years. In 1976 the first Winter Games in Paralympics history were held in Sweden, and as with the Summer Games, have taken place every four years, and include a Paralympics Opening Ceremony and Paralympics Closing Ceremony. Since the Summer Games of Seoul, Korea in 1988 and the Winter Games in Albertville, France in 1992 the Games have also taken part in the same cities and venues as the Olympics due to an agreement between the IPC and IOC. GROWTH OF THE PARALYMPIC FAMILY Also in 1960, under the aegis of the World Federation of ex-servicemen, an International Working Group on Sport for the Disabled was set up to study the problems of sport for persons with an impairment. It resulted in the creation, in 1964, of the International Sport Organisation for the Disabled (ISOD) who offered opportunities for those athletes who could not affiliate to the International Stoke Mandeville Games: vision impaired, amputees, persons with cerebral palsy and paraplegics. At the start, 16 countries were affiliated to ISOD and the organisation pushed very hard to include blind and amputee athletes into the Toronto 1976 Paralympics and athletes with cerebral palsy in 1980 in Arnhem. Its aim was to embrace all impairments in the future and to act as a Co-coordinating Committee. Nevertheless, other disability-orientated international organisations such as the Cerebral Palsy International Sports and Recreation Association (CPISRA) and International Blind Sports Federation (IBSA) were founded in 1978 and 1980. The four international organisations experienced the need of co-ordinating the Games so they created the \"International Co-coordinating Committee Sports for the Disabled in the World\" (ICC) in 1982. The ICC was originally composed of the four presidents of CPISRA, IBSA, ISMGF and ISOD, the general secretaries and one additional member (in the beginning it was the Vice-President, and later on the Technical Officer). The International Committee of Sport for the Deaf (CISS) and International Sports Federations for Persons with an Intellectual Disability (INAS-FID) joined in 1986, but the deaf still maintained their own organisation. However, the member nations demanded more national and regional representation in the organisation.INTERNATIONAL PARALYMPIC COMMITTEE IS BORN Finally, on 22 September 1989, the International Paralympic Committee was founded as an international non-profit organisation in Dusseldorf, Germany, to act as the global governing body of the Paralympic Movement. The word “Paralympic” derives from the Greek preposition “para” (beside or alongside) and the word “Olympic”.

                "content": "In 1948, Sir Ludwig Guttmann organised a sports competition involving 16 World War II veterans with spinal cord-related injuries in Stoke Mandeville, England. Four years later, competitors from Holland joined, and the international movement, now known as the Paralympic Movement, was born. Olympic-style games for athletes with a disability were organised for the first time in Rome in 1960. Taking place soon after the conclusion of the Olympic Games, the Olympic-style games for athletes with a disability attracted 400 participants from 23 countries, who competed in eight sports. Taking place every four years in the same year as the Olympic Games, the Paralympic Games have since grown into one of the world’s biggest sport events, with a track record for driving social inclusion. Following the Tokyo 1964 Games, the Paralympics were held in different cities from the Olympic Games, including the first Paralympic Winter Games, which were held in Örnsköldsvik, Sweden in 1976. In the same year in Toronto, other disability groups were added and the idea of merging together different disability groups for international sports competitions was born. The two Games were held in different cities until the Seoul 1988 Summer Games and Albertville 1992 Winter Games, when the two Games once again came together, with the Paralympics taking place shortly after the Olympic Games in the same venues. On 19 June 2001, an agreement was signed between the IOC and the IPC aimed at protecting the organisation of the Paralympic Games and securing the practice of \"one bid, one city\". This means that cities looking to host the Olympic Games automatically have to include the Paralympics as part of their bid. This agreement came into effect with the Beijing 2008 Paralympic Games, followed by the Vancouver 2010 Paralympic Winter Games. Since the Salt Lake City 2002 Games, one organising committee has been responsible for hosting both the Olympic and the Paralympic Games. Athletes from both Games live in the same village and enjoy the same catering services, medical care and facilities. Ticketing, technology and transport systems for the Olympic Games are seamlessly extended to the Paralympics. Today, the Paralympic Games are the world’s third biggest sport event in terms of ticket sales; only the Olympic Games and the FIFA World Cup sell more. The Rio 2016 Paralympics attracted 4,328 athletes from 159 countries, who competed in 22 sports. An Independent Paralympic Athletes team featuring two refugee athletes also took part. The Games attracted a record cumulative TV audience of 4.1 billion people in more than 150 countries, while 2.15 million tickets were sold. Ahead of the Games, the city of Rio invested in improving infrastructure so that it was accessible for the Paralympics and future generations. This included making tourist destinations accessible for all and the development of the Bus Rapid Transport system, which enables residents and visitors of all abilities to get around the city. The Brazilian government also invested in the creation of a world-leading Paralympic Training Centre for the Brazilian Paralympic Committee in São Paulo. Providing world class facilities for 15 sports, the centre is used all year round by Brazilian athletes and National Paralympic Committees from around the world. South Korea staged record-breaking Paralympic Winter Games in March 2018. Featuring a record 567 athletes from 49 countries, the Games were viewed by cumulative TV audience of 2.02 billion – more than ever before – and a record 343,000 spectators.",

This year, we share how sports have the power to transform people’s lives. At the Paralympics, there is a story behind every athlete - whether it’s about finding their passion, winning a medal, or embracing their disability. Today, we invite you to discover the journeys of incredible Para athletes and how Change Starts With Sports. The IPC Governing Board discussed key learnings from the Paris 2024 Paralympic Games and received progress updates on future Paralympic Games editions and the IPC membership. Two months after competing at Paris 2024, five-time Paralympic champion Benjamin Daviet is looking forward to Milano Cortina 2026 The Paralympic Games are the largest global sporting event for athletes with disabilities and have taken place every four years since the inaugural edition in Rome, Italy, in 1960. In 1976, the first Winter Games were held in Ornskoldsvik, Sweden and featured 198 athletes from 16 countries. Following the 1988 Games in Seoul, Republic of Korea, and the Winter Games in Albertville, France in 1992, the Paralympic and Olympic Games have been held in the same city. The next Paralympic Games will be held in LA in 2028 followed by Brisbane in 2032. The next winter edition is Milano Cortina 2026 with the French Alps to follow in 2030 and Salt Lake City in 2034. The International Paralympic Committee (IPC) is the global governing body of the Paralympic Movement. Founded on 22 September 1989 as a non-profit organisation, we aim to be athlete-centred and membership-focussed in all our endeavours. Through partnerships with more than 200 member organisations, we leverage Para sport to advance the lives of the 1.2 billion individuals with disabilities across the globe. Sport for athletes with an impairment has existed for more than 100 years. It was not until after World War II, however, that it was widely introduced. The purpose of it at that time was to assist the large number of war veterans and civilians who had been injured during wartime. On 29 July 1948, the day of the Opening Ceremony of the London 1948 Olympic Games, Dr. Ludwig Guttmann organised a competition for wheelchair athletes at the Stoke Mandeville Hospital in Great Britain. Sixteen injured servicemen and women took part in archery at the inaugural Stoke Mandeville Games, which later became the Paralympic Games. Classification is the cornerstone of the Paralympic Movement; it determines which athletes are eligible to compete in a sport and how athletes are grouped together for competition. In Para sports, athletes are grouped by the degree of activity limitation resulting from the impairment. This, to a certain extent, is similar to grouping athletes by age, gender or weight. Classification aims to minimise the impact of the impairment on athletes' performance so that the sporting excellence determines which athlete or team is ultimately victorious. Ensuring that athletes are classified prior to competing is crucial to safeguarding the integrity and credibility of the competition. The International Paralympic Committee (IPC) recognises a total of 28 Paralympic sports. The 22 summer sports are Para archery, Para athletics, Para badminton, blind football, boccia, Para canoe, Para cycling, Para equestrian, goalball, Para judo, Para powerlifting, Para rowing, shooting Para sport, sitting volleyball, Para swimming, Para table tennis, Para taekwondo, Para triathlon, wheelchair basketball, wheelchair fencing, wheelchair rugby, and wheelchair tennis. Winter sports include Para alpine skiing, Para biathlon, Para cross-country skiing, Para ice hockey, Para snowboard, and wheelchair curling.",

                "content": "Maria Callas[a] Commendatore OMRI[1] (born Maria Anna Cecilia Sofia Kalogeropoulos;[b] December 2, 1923 – September 16, 1977) was an American-born Greek soprano[2] and one of the most renowned and influential opera singers of the 20th century. Many critics praised her bel canto technique, wide-ranging voice and dramatic interpretations. Her repertoire ranged from classical opera seria to the bel canto operas of Donizetti, Bellini, and Rossini, and further to the works of Verdi and Puccini, and in her early career to the music dramas of Wagner. Her musical and dramatic talents led to her being hailed as La Divina (\"The Divine One\"). Born in Manhattan, New York City, to Greek immigrant parents, she was raised by an overbearing mother who had wanted a son. Maria received her musical education in Greece at age 13 and later established her career in Italy. Forced to deal with the exigencies of 1940s wartime poverty and with near-sightedness that left her nearly blind onstage, she endured struggles and scandal over the course of her career. She underwent a mid-career weight loss, which might have contributed to her vocal decline and the premature end of her career. The press exulted in publicizing Callas' temperamental behavior, the alleged Callas-Tebaldi rivalry, and her love affair with Greek shipping tycoon Aristotle Onassis. Although her dramatic life and personal tragedy have often overshadowed Callas the artist in the popular press, her artistic achievements were such that Leonard Bernstein called her \"the Bible of opera\",[3] and her influence so enduring that, in 2006, Opera News wrote of her: \"Nearly thirty years after her death, she's still the definition of the diva as artist—and still one of classical music's best-selling vocalists.\"[4] The name on Callas' New York birth certificate is Sophie Cecilia Kalos,[5] although she was christened Maria Anna Cecilia Sofia Kalogeropoulos (Greek: Μαρία Άννα Καικιλία Σοφία Καλογεροπούλου).[6] She was born at Flower Fifth Avenue Hospital (now the Terence Cardinal Cooke Health Care Center) on December 2, 1923, to Greek parents, George Kalogeropoulos (c. 1881–1972) and Elmina Evangelia \"Litsa\", née Demes, originally Dimitriadou (c. 1894–1982). Callas' father had shortened the surname Kalogeropoulos, first to \"Kalos\" and subsequently to \"Callas\" to make it more manageable.[7] George and Litsa Callas were an ill-matched couple from the beginning. George was easy-going and unambitious, with no interest in the arts, and Litsa was vivacious and socially ambitious and had dreamed of a life in the arts, which her middle-class parents had stifled in her childhood and youth.[8] Litsa's father, Petros Dimitriadis (1852–1916), was in failing health when Litsa introduced George to her family. Petros, distrustful of George, had warned his daughter, \"You will never be happy with him. If you marry that man, I will never be able to help you\". Litsa had ignored his warning, but soon realized that her father was right.[9] The situation was aggravated by George's philandering and was improved neither by the birth of a daughter, named Yakinthi (later called \"Jackie\") in 1917, nor the birth of a son, named Vassilis, in 1920. Vassilis's death from meningitis in the summer of 1922 dealt another blow to the marriage.[citation needed] In 1923, after realizing that Litsa was pregnant again, George made the decision to move his family to the United States, a decision which Yakinthi recalled was greeted with Litsa \"shouting hysterically\" followed by George \"slamming doors\".[10] The family left for New York in July 1923, moving first into an apartment in the heavily ethnic neighborhood of Astoria, Queens.[citation needed] Litsa was convinced that her third child would be a boy; her disappointment at the birth of another daughter was so great that she refused to even look at her new baby for four days.[5] Maria was christened three years later at the Archdiocesan Cathedral of the Holy Trinity in 1926.[11] When Maria was 4, George Callas opened his own pharmacy, settling the family in Manhattan on 192nd Street in Washington Heights, where Callas grew up. Around the age of three, Maria's musical talent began to manifest itself, and after Litsa discovered that her youngest daughter also had a voice, she began pressing \"Mary\" to sing. Callas later recalled, \"I was made to sing when I was only five, and I hated it.\"[12] George was unhappy with his wife favoring their elder daughter, as well as the pressure put upon young Mary to sing and perform,[13] and Litsa was increasingly embittered with George and his absences and infidelity, and often violently reviled him in front of their children.[14] The marriage continued to deteriorate, and in 1937, Litsa returned to Athens with her two daughters.[15] Callas' relationship with her mother continued to erode during the years in Greece, and in the prime of her career, it became a matter of great public interest, especially after a 1956 cover story in Time magazine which focused on this relationship and later, by Litsa's book My Daughter Maria Callas (1960). In public, Callas recalls the strained relationship with Litsa on her unhappy childhood spent singing and working at her mother's insistence, saying, My sister was slim and beautiful and friendly, and my mother always preferred her. I was the ugly duckling, fat and clumsy and unpopular. It is a cruel thing to make a child feel ugly and unwanted... I'll never forgive her for taking my childhood away. During all the years I should have been playing and growing up, I was singing or making money. Everything I did for them was mostly good and everything they did to me was mostly bad.[16] In 1957, she told Chicago radio host Norman Ross Jr., \"There must be a law against forcing children to perform at an early age. Children should have a wonderful childhood. They should not be given too much responsibility.\"[17] Biographer Nicholas Petsalis-Diomidis [el] says that Litsa's hateful treatment of George in front of their young children led to resentment and dislike on Callas' part.[18] According to both Callas' husband and her close friend Giulietta Simionato, Callas related to them that her mother, who did not work, pressed her to \"go out with various men\", mainly Italian and German soldiers, to bring home money and food during the Axis occupation of Greece during World War II. Simionato was convinced that Callas \"managed to remain untouched\", but never forgave her mother for what she perceived as a kind of prostitution forced on her.[19] Litsa, beginning in New York and continuing in Athens, had adopted a questionable lifestyle that included not only pushing her daughters into degrading situations to support her financially, but also entertaining Italian and German soldiers during the Axis occupation.[20] In an attempt to patch things up with her mother, Callas took Litsa along on her first visit to Mexico in 1950, but this only reawakened the old frictions and resentments, and after leaving Mexico they never met again. After a series of angry and accusatory letters from Litsa lambasting Callas' father and husband, Callas ceased communication with her mother altogether.[21] A 1955 Time story [22][23][24] covered Callas' response to her mother's request of $100, \"for my daily bread.\" Callas had replied, \"Don't come to us with your troubles. I had to work for my money, and you are young enough to work, too. If you can't make enough money to live on, you can jump out of the window or drown yourself.\" Callas justified her behavior...\"They say my family is very short of money. Before God, I say why should they blame me? I feel no guilt and I feel no gratitude. I like to show kindness, but you mustn't expect thanks, because you won't get any. That's the way life is. If some day I need help, I wouldn't expect anything from anybody. When I'm old, nobody is going to worry about me.\"[23] Callas received her musical education in Athens. Initially, her mother tried to enroll her at the prestigious Athens Conservatoire, without success. At the audition, her voice, still untrained, failed to impress, and the conservatoire's director Filoktitis Oikonomidis [el] refused to accept her without her satisfying the theoretic prerequisites (solfege). In the summer of 1937, her mother visited Maria Trivella at the younger Greek National Conservatoire, asking her to take Mary, as she was then called, as a student for a modest fee. In 1957, Trivella recalled her impression of \"Mary, a very plump young girl, wearing big glasses for her myopia\": The tone of the voice was warm, lyrical, intense; it swirled and flared like a flame and filled the air with melodious reverberations like a carillon. It was by any standards an amazing phenomenon, or rather it was a great talent that needed control, technical training and strict discipline in order to shine with all its brilliance.[25] Trivella agreed to tutor Callas, completely waiving her tuition fees, but no sooner had Callas started her formal lessons and vocal exercises than Trivella began to feel that Callas was not a contralto, as she had been told, but a dramatic soprano. Subsequently, they began working on raising the tessitura of her voice and to lighten its timbre.[25] Trivella recalled Callas as A model student. Fanatical, uncompromising, dedicated to her studies heart and soul. Her progress was phenomenal. She studied five or six hours a day. ...Within six months, she was singing the most difficult arias in the international opera repertoire with the utmost musicality.[25] On April 11, 1938, in her public debut, Callas ended the recital of Trivella's class at the Parnassos music hall with a duet from Tosca.[25] Callas recalled that Trivella had a French method, which was placing the voice in the nose, rather nasal... and I had the problem of not having low chest tones, which is essential in bel canto... And that's where I learned my chest tones.[26] However, when interviewed by Pierre Desgraupes on the French program L'invitée du dimanche, Callas attributed the development of her chest voice not to Trivella, but to her next teacher, the Spanish coloratura soprano Elvira de Hidalgo.[27] Callas studied with Trivella for two years before her mother secured another audition at the Athens Conservatoire with de Hidalgo. Callas auditioned with \"Ocean, Thou Mighty Monster\" from Weber's Oberon. De Hidalgo recalled hearing \"tempestuous, extravagant cascades of sounds, as yet uncontrolled but full of drama and emotion\".[25] She agreed to take her as a pupil immediately, but Callas' mother asked de Hidalgo to wait for a year, as Callas would be graduating from the National Conservatoire and could begin working. On April 2, 1939, Callas undertook the part of Santuzza in a student production of Mascagni's Cavalleria rusticana at the Greek National Opera at the Olympia Theatre, and in the fall of the same year she enrolled at the Athens Conservatoire in Elvira de Hidalgo's class.[25] In 1968, Callas told Lord Harewood, De Hildalgo had the real great training, maybe even the last real training of the real bel canto. As a young girl—thirteen years old—I was immediately thrown into her arms, meaning that I learned the secrets, the ways of this bel canto, which of course as you well know, is not just beautiful singing. It is a very hard training; it is a sort of a strait-jacket that you're supposed to put on, whether you like it or not. You have to learn to read, to write, to form your sentences, how far you can go, fall, hurt yourself, put yourself back on your feet continuously. De Hidalgo had one method, which was the real bel canto way, where no matter how heavy a voice, it should always be kept light, it should always be worked on in a flexible way, never to weigh it down. It is a method of keeping the voice light and flexible and pushing the instrument into a certain zone where it might not be too large in sound, but penetrating. And teaching the scales, trills, all the bel canto embellishments, which is a whole vast language of its own.[26] De Hidalgo later recalled Callas as \"a phenomenon... She would listen to all my students, sopranos, mezzos, tenors... She could do it all.\"[28] Callas said that she would go to \"the conservatoire at 10 in the morning and leave with the last pupil ... devouring music\" for 10 hours a day. When asked by her teacher why she did this, her answer was that even \"with the least talented pupil, he can teach you something that you, the most talented, might not be able to do.\"[29] After several appearances as a student, Callas began appearing in secondary roles at the Greek National Opera. De Hidalgo was instrumental in securing roles for her, allowing Callas to earn a small salary, which helped her and her family get through the difficult war years.[25] Callas made her professional debut in February 1941, in the small role of Beatrice in Franz von Suppé's Boccaccio. Soprano Galatea Amaxopoulou, who sang in the chorus, later recalled, \"Even in rehearsal, Maria's fantastic performing ability had been obvious, and from then on, the others started trying ways of preventing her from appearing.\"[25] Fellow singer Maria Alkeou similarly recalled that the established sopranos Nafsika Galanou and Anna (Zozó) Remmoundou \"used to stand in the wings while [Callas] was singing and make remarks about her, muttering, laughing, and point their fingers at her\".[25] Despite these hostilities, Callas managed to continue and made her debut in a leading role in August 1942 as Tosca, going on to sing the role of Marta in Eugen d'Albert's Tiefland at the Olympia Theatre. Callas' performance as Marta received glowing reviews. Critic Spanoudi declared Callas \"an extremely dynamic artist possessing the rarest dramatic and musical gifts\", and Evangelos Magkliveras evaluated Callas' performance for the weekly To Radiophonon: The singer who took the part of Marta, that new star in the Greek firmament, with a matchless depth of feeling, gave a theatrical interpretation well up to the standard of a tragic actress. About her exceptional voice with its astonishing natural fluency, I do not wish to add anything to the words of Alexandra Lalaouni: 'Kalogeropoulou is one of those God-given talents that one can only marvel at.'[25] Following these performances, even Callas' detractors began to refer to her as \"The God-Given\".[25] Some time later, watching Callas rehearse Beethoven's Fidelio, rival soprano Anna Remoundou asked a colleague \"Could it be that there is something divine and we haven't realized it?\"[25] Following Tiefland, Callas sang the role of Santuzza in Cavalleria rusticana again and followed it with O Protomastoras [el] (Manolis Kalomiris) at the ancient Odeon of Herodes Atticus theatre at the foot of the Acropolis. During August and September 1944, Callas performed the role of Leonore in a Greek language production of Fidelio, again at the Odeon of Herodes Atticus. German critic Friedrich Herzog, who witnessed the performances, declared Leonore Callas' \"greatest triumph\":[25] When Maria Kaloyeropoulou's Leonore let her soprano soar out radiantly in the untrammelled jubilation of the duet, she rose to the most sublime heights...Here she gave bud, blossom and fruit to that harmony of sound that also ennobled the art of the prima donna.[25] After the liberation of Greece, de Hidalgo advised Callas to establish herself in Italy. Callas proceeded to give a series of concerts around Greece, and then, against her teacher's advice, she returned to America to see her father and to further pursue her career. When she left Greece on September 14, 1945, two months short of her 22nd birthday, Callas had given 56 performances in seven operas and had appeared in around 20 recitals.[25] Callas considered her Greek career as the foundation of her musical and dramatic upbringing, saying \"When I got to the big career, there were no surprises for me.\"[30] After returning to the United States and reuniting with her father in September 1945, Callas made the round of auditions.[25] In December of that year, she auditioned for Edward Johnson, general manager of the Metropolitan Opera, and was favorably received: \"Exceptional voice—ought to be heard very soon on stage\".[25] Callas maintained that the Metropolitan Opera offered her Madama Butterfly and Fidelio, to be performed in Philadelphia and sung in English, both of which she declined, feeling she was too fat for Butterfly and did not like the idea of opera in English.[30] Although no written evidence of this offer exists in the Met's records,[21] in a 1958 interview with the New York Post, Johnson confirmed that a contract was offered: \"... but she didn't like it—because of the contract, not because of the roles. She was right in turning it down—it was frankly a beginner's contract.\"[25] In 1946, Callas was engaged to re-open the opera house in Chicago as Turandot, but the company folded before opening. Basso Nicola Rossi-Lemeni, who also was to star in this opera, was aware that Tullio Serafin was looking for a dramatic soprano to cast as La Gioconda at the Arena di Verona. He later recalled the young Callas as being \"amazing—so strong physically and spiritually; so certain of her future. I knew in a big outdoor theatre like Verona's, this girl, with her courage and huge voice, would make a tremendous impact.\"[31][page needed] Subsequently he recommended Callas to retired tenor and impresario Giovanni Zenatello. During her audition, Zenatello became so excited that he jumped up and joined Callas in the act 4 duet.[13] It was in this role that Callas made her Italian debut. Upon her arrival in Verona, Callas met Giovanni Battista Meneghini, an older, wealthy industrialist, who began courting her. They married in 1949, and he assumed control of her career until 1959, when the marriage dissolved. It was Meneghini's love and support that gave Callas the time needed to establish herself in Italy,[31][page needed] and throughout the prime of her career, she went by the name of Maria Meneghini Callas. After La Gioconda, Callas had no offers, and when Serafin, looking for someone to sing Isolde, called on her, she told him that she already knew the score, even though she had looked at only the first act out of curiosity while at the conservatory.[30] She sight-read the opera's second act for Serafin, who praised her for knowing the role so well, whereupon she admitted to having bluffed and having sight-read the music. Even more impressed, Serafin immediately cast her in the role.[30] Serafin thereafter served as Callas' mentor and supporter. Lord Harewood stated \"Very few Italian conductors have had a more distinguished career than Tullio Serafin, and perhaps none, apart from Toscanini, more influence\".[29] In 1968, Callas recalled that working with Serafin was the \"really lucky\" opportunity of her career because \"he taught me that there must be an expression; that there must be a justification. He taught me the depth of music, the justification of music. That's where I really really drank all I could from this man\".[26] The great turning point in Callas' career occurred in Venice in 1949.[32] She was engaged to sing the role of Brünnhilde in Die Walküre at the Teatro la Fenice, when Margherita Carosio, who was engaged to sing Elvira in I puritani in the same theatre, fell ill. Unable to find a replacement for Carosio, Serafin told Callas that she would be singing Elvira in six days; when Callas protested that she not only did not know the role, but also had three more Brünnhildes to sing, he told her \"I guarantee that you can\".[29] Michael Scott's words, \"the notion of any one singer embracing music as divergent in its vocal demands as Wagner's Brünnhilde and Bellini's Elvira in the same career would have been cause enough for surprise; but to attempt to essay them both in the same season seemed like folie de grandeur\".[21] Before the performance actually took place, one incredulous critic snorted, \"We hear that Serafin has agreed to conduct I puritani with a dramatic soprano ... When can we expect a new edition of La traviata with [male baritone] Gino Bechi's Violetta?\"[21] After the performance, one critic wrote, \"Even the most sceptical had to acknowledge the miracle that Maria Callas accomplished... the flexibility of her limpid, beautifully poised voice, and her splendid high notes. Her interpretation also has a humanity, warmth and expressiveness that one would search for in vain in the fragile, pellucid coldness of other Elviras.\"[33] Franco Zeffirelli recalled, \"What she did in Venice was really incredible. You need to be familiar with opera to realize the size of her achievement. It was as if someone asked Birgit Nilsson, who is famous for her great Wagnerian voice, to substitute overnight for Beverly Sills, who is one of the great coloratura sopranos of our time.\"[28][34][35] Scott asserts that \"Of all the many roles Callas undertook, it is doubtful if any had a more far-reaching effect.\"[21] This initial foray into the bel canto repertoire changed the course of Callas' career and set her on a path leading to Lucia di Lammermoor, La traviata, Armida, La sonnambula, Il pirata, Il turco in Italia, Medea, and Anna Bolena, and reawakened interest in the long-neglected operas of Cherubini, Bellini, Donizetti and Rossini.[28][31][page needed] In the words of soprano Montserrat Caballé: She opened a new door for us, for all the singers in the world, a door that had been closed. Behind it was sleeping not only great music but great idea of interpretation. She has given us the chance, those who follow her, to do things that were hardly possible before her. That I am compared with Callas is something I never dared to dream. It is not right. I am much smaller than Callas.[31][page needed] As with I puritani, Callas learned and performed Cherubini's Medea, Giordano's Andrea Chénier and Rossini's Armida on a few days' notice.[31][page needed][36] Throughout her career, Callas displayed her vocal versatility in recitals that juxtaposed dramatic soprano arias alongside coloratura pieces, including in a 1952 RAI recital in which she opened with \"Lady Macbeth's letter scene\", followed by the \"Mad Scene\" from Lucia di Lammermoor, then Abigaille's treacherous recitative and aria from Nabucco, finishing with the \"Bell Song\" from Lakmé capped by a ringing high E in alt (E6).[36] Although by 1951, Callas had sung at all the major theatres in Italy, she had not yet made her official debut at Italy's most prestigious opera house, Teatro alla Scala in Milan. According to composer Gian Carlo Menotti, Callas had substituted for Renata Tebaldi in the role of Aida in 1950, and La Scala's general manager, Antonio Ghiringhelli, had taken an immediate dislike to Callas.[28] Menotti recalls that Ghiringhelli had promised him any singer he wanted for the premiere of The Consul, but when he suggested Callas, Ghiringhelli said that he would never have Callas at La Scala except as a guest artist. However, as Callas' fame grew, and especially after her great success in I vespri siciliani in Florence, Ghiringhelli had to relent: Callas made her official debut at La Scala in Verdi's I vespri siciliani on opening night in December 1951, and this theatre became her artistic home throughout the 1950s.[28] La Scala mounted many new productions specially for Callas by directors such as Herbert von Karajan, Margherita Wallmann, Franco Zeffirelli and, most importantly, Luchino Visconti.[31][page needed] Visconti stated later that he began directing opera only because of Callas,[37] and he directed her in lavish new productions of La vestale, La traviata, La sonnambula, Anna Bolena and Iphigénie en Tauride. Callas was instrumental in arranging Franco Corelli's debut at La Scala in 1954, where he sang Licinio in Spontini's La vestale opposite Callas' Julia. The two had sung together for the first time the year previously in Rome in a production of Norma. Anthony Tommasini wrote that Corelli had \"earned great respect from the fearsomely demanding Callas, who, in Mr Corelli, finally had someone with whom she could act.\"[38] The two collaborated several more times at La Scala, singing opposite each other in productions of Fedora (1956), Il pirata (1958) and Poliuto (1960). Their partnership continued throughout the rest of Callas' career.[39] The night of the day she married Meneghini in Verona, she sailed for Argentina to sing at the Teatro Colón in Buenos Aires. Callas made her South American debut in Buenos Aires on May 20, 1949, during the European summer opera recess. Aida, Turandot and Norma roles were directed by Serafin, supported by Mario Del Monaco, Fedora Barbieri and Nicola Rossi-Lemeni. These were her only appearances on this world-renowned stage. Her debut in the United States was five years later in Chicago in 1954, and \"with the Callas Norma, Lyric Opera of Chicago was born.\"[40] Her Metropolitan Opera debut, opening the Met's seventy-second season on October 29, 1956, was again with Norma,[41] but was preceded by an unflattering cover story in Time magazine, which rehashed all of the Callas clichés, including her temper, her supposed rivalry with Renata Tebaldi, and especially her difficult relationship with her mother.[13][32] As she had done with Lyric Opera of Chicago, on November 21, 1957, Callas gave a concert to inaugurate what then was billed as the Dallas Civic Opera, and helped establish that company with her friends from Chicago, Lawrence Kelly and Nicola Rescigno.[42] She further consolidated this company's standing when, in 1958, she gave \"a towering performance as Violetta in La traviata, and that same year, in her only American performances of Medea, gave an interpretation of the title role worthy of Euripides.\"[43] In 1958, a feud with Rudolf Bing led to Callas' Metropolitan Opera contract being cancelled. Impresario Allen Oxenburg realised that this situation provided him with an opportunity for his own company, the American Opera Society, and he accordingly approached her with a contract to perform Imogene in Il pirata. She accepted and sang the role in a January 1959 performance that according to opera critic Allan Kozinn \"quickly became legendary in operatic circles\".[44] Bing and Callas later reconciled their differences, and she returned to the Met in 1965 to sing the title role in two performances as Tosca opposite Franco Corelli as Cavaradossi for one performance (March 19, 1965) and Richard Tucker (March 25, 1965) with Tito Gobbi as Scarpia for her final performances at the Met.[citation needed] In 1952, she made her London debut at the Royal Opera House in Norma with veteran mezzo-soprano Ebe Stignani as Adalgisa, a performance which survives on record and also features the young Joan Sutherland in the small role of Clotilde.[36] Callas and the London public had what she called \"a love affair\",[13] and she returned to the Royal Opera House in 1953, 1957, 1958, 1959, and 1964 to 1965.[31][page needed] It was at the Royal Opera House where, on July 5, 1965, Callas ended her stage career in the role of Tosca, in a production designed and mounted for her by Franco Zeffirelli and featuring her friend and colleague Tito Gobbi.[31][page needed] In the early years of her career, Callas was a heavy woman; in her own words, \"Heavy—one can say—yes I was; but I'm also a tall woman, 5' 8+1⁄2\" (1.74 m), and I used to weigh no more than 200 pounds (90 kilograms).\"[30] Tito Gobbi relates that during a lunch break while recording Lucia in Florence, Serafin commented to Callas that she was eating too much and allowing her weight to become a problem. When she protested that she was not so heavy, Gobbi suggested she should \"put the matter to test\" by stepping on the weighing machine outside the restaurant. The result was \"somewhat dismaying, and she became rather silent.\"[46] In 1968, Callas told Edward Downes that during her initial performances in Cherubini's Medea in May 1953, she realized that she needed a leaner face and figure to do dramatic justice to this as well as the other roles she was undertaking. She adds, I was getting so heavy that even my vocalizing was getting heavy. I was tiring myself, I was perspiring too much, and I was really working too hard. And I wasn't really well, as in health; I couldn't move freely. And then I was tired of playing a game, for instance playing this beautiful young woman, and I was heavy and uncomfortable to move around. In any case, it was uncomfortable and I didn't like it. So I felt now if I'm going to do things right—I've studied all my life to put things right musically, so why don't I diet and put myself into a certain condition where I'm presentable.[30] During 1953 and early 1954, she lost almost 80 pounds (36 kg), turning herself into what Rescigno called \"possibly the most beautiful lady on the stage\".[28] Various rumors spread regarding her weight loss method; one had her swallowing a tapeworm, and Rome's Panatella Mills pasta company claimed she lost weight by eating their \"physiologic pasta\", prompting Callas to file a lawsuit.[21] Callas stated that she lost the weight by eating a sensible low-calorie diet of mainly salads and chicken.[30] Callas never regained the weight she lost and kept her slim figure until her death. Some believe that the loss of body mass made it more difficult for her to support her voice, triggering the vocal strain that became apparent later in the decade, and others believed the weight loss effected a newfound softness and femininity in her voice, as well as a greater confidence as a person and performer.[31][page needed] Tito Gobbi said, Now she was not only supremely gifted both musically and dramatically—she was a beauty too. And her awareness of this invested with fresh magic every role she undertook. What it eventually did to her vocal and nervous stamina I am not prepared to say. I only assert that she blossomed into an artist unique in her generation and outstanding in the whole range of vocal history.[46] Callas' voice was and remains controversial; it bothered and disturbed as many as it thrilled and inspired.[31][page needed][36][page needed] Walter Legge stated that Callas possessed that most essential ingredient for a great singer: an instantly recognizable voice.[47] During \"The Callas Debate\", Italian critic Rodolfo Celletti stated, \"The timbre of Callas' voice, considered purely as sound, was essentially ugly: it was a thick sound, which gave the impression of dryness, of aridity. It lacked those elements which, in a singer's jargon, are described as velvet and varnish... yet I really believe that part of her appeal was precisely due to this fact. Why? Because for all its natural lack of varnish, velvet and richness, this voice could acquire such distinctive colours and timbres as to be unforgettable.\"[48] However, in his review of Callas' 1951 live recording of I vespri siciliani, Ira Siff writes, \"Accepted wisdom tells us that Callas possessed, even early on, a flawed voice, unattractive by conventional standards—an instrument that signaled from the beginning vocal problems to come. Yet listen to her entrance in this performance and one encounters a rich, spinning sound, ravishing by any standard, capable of delicate dynamic nuance. High notes are free of wobble, chest tones unforced, and the middle register displays none of the \"bottled\" quality that became more and more pronounced as Callas matured.\"[49] Nicola Rossi-Lemeni relates that Callas' mentor Serafin used to refer to her as Una grande vociaccia; he continues, \"Vociaccia is a little bit pejorative—it means an ugly voice—but grande means a big voice, a great voice. A great ugly voice, in a way.\"[50] Callas did not like the sound of her own voice; in one of her last interviews, answering whether or not she was able to listen to her own voice, she replies, Yes, but I don't like it. I have to do it, but I don't like it at all because I don't like the kind of voice I have. I really hate listening to myself! The first time I listened to a recording of my singing was when we were recording San Giovanni Battista by Stradella in a church in Perugia in 1949. They made me listen to the tape and I cried my eyes out. I wanted to stop everything, to give up singing... Also now even though I don't like my voice, I've become able to accept it and to be detached and objective about it so I can say, \"Oh, that was really well sung,\" or \"It was nearly perfect.\"[51] Carlo Maria Giulini has described the appeal of Callas' voice: It is very difficult to speak of the voice of Callas. Her voice was a very special instrument. Something happens sometimes with string instruments—violin, viola, cello—where the first moment you listen to the sound of this instrument, the first feeling is a bit strange sometimes. But after just a few minutes, when you get used to, when you become friends with this kind of sound, then the sound becomes a magical quality. This was Callas.[28] Callas' voice has been difficult to place in the modern vocal classification or Fach system, especially since in her prime, her repertoire contained the heaviest dramatic soprano roles as well as roles usually undertaken by the highest, lightest and most agile coloratura sopranos. Regarding this versatility, Serafin said, \"This woman can sing anything written for the female voice\".[13] Michael Scott argues that Callas' voice was a natural high soprano,[21] and going by evidence of Callas' early recordings, Rosa Ponselle likewise felt that \"At that stage of its development, her voice was a pure but sizable dramatic coloratura—that is to say, a sizable coloratura voice with dramatic capabilities, not the other way around.\"[52] On the other hand, music critic John Ardoin has argued that Callas was the reincarnation of the 19th-century soprano sfogato or \"unlimited soprano\", a throwback to Maria Malibran and Giuditta Pasta, for whom many of the famous bel canto operas were written. He avers that like Pasta and Malibran, Callas was a natural mezzo-soprano whose range was extended through training and willpower, resulting in a voice which \"lacked the homogeneous color and evenness of scale once so prized in singing. There were unruly sections of their voices never fully under control. Many who heard Pasta, for example, remarked that her uppermost notes seemed produced by ventriloquism, a charge which would later be made against Callas\".[53] Ardoin points to the writings of Henry Chorley about Pasta which bear an uncanny resemblance to descriptions of Callas: There was a portion of the scale which differed from the rest in quality and remained to the last 'under a veil.' ...out of these uncouth materials she had to compose her instrument and then to give it flexibility. Her studies to acquire execution must have been tremendous; but the volubility and brilliancy, when acquired, gained a character of their own... There were a breadth, an expressiveness in her roulades, an evenness and solidity in her shake, which imparted to every passage a significance totally beyond the reach of lighter and more spontaneous singers... The best of her audience were held in thrall, without being able to analyze what made up the spell, what produced the effect—as soon as she opened her lips.[31][page needed] Callas appears to have been in agreement not only with Ardoin's assertions that she started as a natural mezzo-soprano, but also saw the similarities between herself and Pasta and Malibran. In 1957, she described her early voice as: \"The timbre was dark, almost black—when I think of it, I think of thick molasses\", and in 1968 she added, \"They say I was not a true soprano, I was rather toward a mezzo\".[25] Regarding her ability to sing the heaviest as well as the lightest roles, she told James Fleetwood, It's study; it's Nature. I'm doing nothing special, you know. Even Lucia, Anna Bolena, Puritani, all these operas were created for one type of soprano, the type that sang Norma, Fidelio, which was Malibran of course. And a funny coincidence last year, I was singing Anna Bolena and Sonnambula, same months and the same distance of time as Giuditta Pasta had sung in the nineteenth century... So I'm really not doing anything extraordinary. You wouldn't ask a pianist not to be able to play everything; he has to. This is Nature and also because I had a wonderful teacher, the old kind of teaching methods...I was a very heavy voice, that is my nature, a dark voice shall we call it, and I was always kept on the light side. She always trained me to keep my voice limber.[54] Regarding the sheer size of Callas' instrument, Rodolfo Celletti says, \"Her voice was penetrating. The volume as such was average: neither small nor powerful. But the penetration, allied to this incisive quality (which bordered on the ugly because it frequently contained an element of harshness) ensured that her voice could be clearly heard anywhere in the auditorium.\"[48] Celletti wrote that Callas had \"a voluminous, penetrating, and dark voice\" (una voce voluminosa, squillante e di timbro scuro).[55] After her first performance of Medea in 1953, the critic for Musical Courier wrote that \"she displayed a vocal generosity that was scarcely believable for its amplitude and resilience.\"[33] In a 1982 Opera News interview with Joan Sutherland and Richard Bonynge, Bonynge stated, \"But before she slimmed down, I mean this was such a colossal voice. It just poured out of her, the way Flagstad's did.... Callas had a huge voice. When she and Stignani sang Norma, at the bottom of the range you could barely tell who was who ... Oh it was colossal. And she took the big sound right up to the top.\"[56] In his book, Michael Scott makes the distinction that whereas Callas' pre-1954 voice was a \"dramatic soprano with an exceptional top\", after the weight loss, it became, as one Chicago critic described the voice in Lucia,[33] a \"huge soprano leggiero\".[21] In performance, Callas' vocal range was just short of three octaves, from F-sharp (F♯3) below middle C (C4) heard in \"Arrigo! Ah parli a un core\" from I vespri siciliani to E-natural (E6) above high C (C6), heard in the aria \"Mercè, dilette amiche\" in the final act of the same opera, as well as in Rossini's Armida and Lakmé's Bell Song. Whether or not Callas ever sang a high F-natural in performance has been open to debate. After her June 11, 1951, concert in Florence, Rock Ferris of Musical Courier said, \"Her high E's and F's are taken full voice.\"[33] Although no definite recording of Callas singing high Fs has surfaced, the presumed E-natural at the end of Rossini's Armida—a poor-quality bootleg recording of uncertain pitch—has been referred to as a high F by Italian musicologists and critics Eugenio Gara and Rodolfo Celletti.[48] Callas expert Dr. Robert Seletsky, however, stated that since the finale of Armida is in the key of E, the final note could not have been an F, as it would have been dissonant. Author Eve Ruggieri has referred to the penultimate note in \"Mercè, dilette amiche\" from the 1951 Florence performances of I vespri siciliani as a high F;[57] however, this claim is refuted by John Ardoin's review of the live recording of the performance as well as by the review of the recording in Opera News, both of which refer to the note as a high E-natural.[36][page needed][49] In a 1969 French television interview with Pierre Desgraupes on the program L'invitée du dimanche, Francesco Siciliani [it] speaks of Callas' voice going to high F (he also talked about her lower register extending to C3), but within the same program, Callas' teacher, Elvira de Hidalgo, speaks of the voice soaring to a high E-natural but does not mention a high F. Callas remained silent on the subject, neither confirming nor denying either claim.[27] Callas' voice was noted for its three distinct registers: Her low or chest register was extremely dark and powerful, and she used this part of her voice for dramatic effect, often going into this register much higher on the scale than most sopranos.[47][48] Her middle register had a peculiar and highly personal sound—\"part oboe, part clarinet\", as Claudia Cassidy described it[31][page needed]—and was noted for its veiled or \"bottled\" sound, as if she were singing into a jug.[47] Walter Legge, husband of diva Elisabeth Schwarzkopf, attributed this sound to the \"extraordinary formation of her upper palate, shaped like a Gothic arch, not the Romanesque arch of the normal mouth\".[47] The upper register was ample and bright, with an impressive extension above high C, which—in contrast to the light flute-like sound of the typical coloratura, \"she would attack these notes with more vehemence and power—quite differently therefore, from the very delicate, cautious, 'white' approach of the light sopranos.\"[48] Legge adds, \"Even in the most difficult fioriture there were no musical or technical difficulties in this part of the voice which she could not execute with astonishing, unostentatious ease. Her chromatic runs, particularly downwards, were beautifully smooth and staccatos almost unfailingly accurate, even in the trickiest intervals. There is hardly a bar in the whole range of nineteenth-century music for high soprano that seriously tested her powers.\"[47] And as she demonstrated in the finale of La sonnambula on the commercial EMI set and the live recording from Cologne, she was able to execute a diminuendo on the stratospheric high E-flat, which Scott describes as \"a feat unrivaled in the history of the gramophone.\"[21] Regarding Callas' soft singing, Celletti says, \"In these soft passages, Callas seemed to use another voice altogether, because it acquired a great sweetness. Whether in her florid singing or in her canto spianato, that is, in long held notes without ornamentation, her mezza voce could achieve such moving sweetness that the sound seemed to come from on high ... I don't know, it seemed to come from the skylight of La Scala.\"[48] This combination of size, weight, range and agility was a source of amazement to Callas' own contemporaries. One of the choristers present at her La Scala debut in I vespri siciliani recalled, \"My God! She came on stage sounding like our deepest contralto, Cloe Elmo. And before the evening was over, she took a high E-flat. And it was twice as strong as Toti Dal Monte's!\"[31][page needed] In the same vein, mezzo-soprano Giulietta Simionato said: \"The first time we sang together was in Mexico in 1950, where she sang the top E-flat in the second-act finale of Aida. I can still remember the effect of that note in the opera house—it was like a star!\"[58] For Italian soprano Renata Tebaldi, \"the most fantastic thing was the possibility for her to sing the soprano coloratura with this big voice! This was something really special. Fantastic absolutely!\"[28] Callas' vocal registers, however, were not seamlessly joined; Walter Legge writes, \"Unfortunately, it was only in quick music, particularly descending scales, that she completely mastered the art of joining the three almost incompatible voices into one unified whole, but until about 1960, she disguised those audible gear changes with cunning skill.\"[47] Rodolfo Celletti states, In certain areas of her range her voice also possessed a guttural quality. This would occur in the most delicate and troublesome areas of a soprano's voice—for instance where the lower and middle registers merge, between G and A. I would go so far as to say that here her voice had such resonances as to make one think at times of a ventriloquist ... or else the voice could sound as though it were resonating in a rubber tube. There was another troublesome spot ... between the middle and upper registers. Here, too, around the treble F and G, there was often something in the sound itself which was not quite right, as though the voice were not functioning properly.[48] As to whether these troublesome spots were due to the nature of the voice or to technical deficiencies, Celletti says: \"Even if, when passing from one register to another, Callas produced an unpleasant sound, the technique she used for these transitions was perfect.\"[48] Musicologist and critic Fedele D'Amico [it] adds, \"Callas' 'faults' were in the voice and not in the singer; they are so to speak, faults of departure but not of arrival. This is precisely Celletti's distinction between the natural quality of the voice and the technique.\"[48] In 2005, Ewa Podleś said of Callas, \"Maybe she had three voices, maybe she had three ranges, I don't know—I am a professional singer. Nothing disturbed me, nothing! I bought everything that she offered me. Why? Because all of her voices, her registers, she used how they should be used—just to tell us something!\"[59] Eugenio Gara states, \"Much has been said about her voice, and no doubt the discussion will continue. Certainly no one could in honesty deny the harsh or \"squashed\" sounds, nor the wobble on the very high notes. These and others were precisely the accusations made at the time against Pasta and Malibran, two geniuses of song (as they were then called), sublime, yet imperfect. Both were brought to trial in their day. ... Yet few singers have made history in the annals of opera as these two did.\"[48] Callas' own thoughts regarding music and singing can be found at Wikiquote. Adored by many opera enthusiasts, Callas was a controversial artist. Although Callas was the great singer often dismissed simply as an actress,[60] Callas considered herself foremost a musician, that is, the first instrument of the orchestra.\"[26] Grace Bumbry has stated, \"If I followed the musical score when [Callas] was singing, I would see every tempo marking, every dynamic marking, everything being adhered to, and at the same time, it was not antiseptic; it was something that was very beautiful and moving.\"[61] Victor de Sabata confided to Walter Legge [when?], \"If the public could understand, as we do, how deeply and utterly musical Callas is, they would be stunned\",[47] and Serafin assessed Callas' musicality as \"extraordinary, almost frightening.\"[62] Callas possessed an innate architectural sense of line-proportion[31][page needed] and an uncanny feel for timing and for what one of Callas’ colleagues described as \"a sense of the rhythm within the rhythm\".[25] Regarding Callas' technical prowess, Celletti says, \"We must not forget that she could tackle the whole gamut of ornamentation: staccato, trills, half-trills, gruppetti, scales, etc.\"[48] D'Amico adds, \"The essential virtue of Callas' technique consists of supreme mastery of an extraordinarily rich range of tone colour (that is, the fusion of dynamic range and timbre). And such mastery means total freedom of choice in its use: not being a slave to one's abilities, but rather, being able to use them at will as a means to an end.\"[48] While reviewing the many recorded versions of \"perhaps Verdi's ultimate challenge\", the aria \"D'amor sull'ali rosee\" from Il trovatore, Richard Dyer writes, Callas articulates all of the trills, and she binds them into the line more expressively than anyone else; they are not an ornament but a form of intensification. Part of the wonder in this performance is the chiaroscuro through her tone—the other side of not singing full-out all the way through. One of the vocal devices that create that chiaroscuro is a varying rate of vibrato; another is her portamento, the way she connects the voice from note to note, phrase to phrase, lifting and gliding. This is never a sloppy swoop, because its intention is as musically precise as it is in great string playing. In this aria, Callas uses more portamento, and in greater variety, than any other singer ... Callas is not creating \"effects\", as even her greatest rivals do. She sees the aria as a whole, \"as if in an aerial view\", as Sviatoslav Richter's teacher observed of his most famous pupil; simultaneously, she is on earth, standing in the courtyard of the palace of Aliaferia, floating her voice to the tower where her lover lies imprisoned.[63] In addition to her musical skills, Callas had a particular gift for language and the use of language in music.[47] In recitatives, she always knew which word to emphasize and which syllable in that word to bring out.[31][page needed] Michael Scott notes, \"If we listen attentively, we note how her perfect legato enables her to suggest by musical means even the exclamation marks and commas of the text.\"[21] Technically, not only did she have the capacity to perform the most difficult florid music effortlessly, but also she had the ability to use each ornament as an expressive device rather than for mere fireworks.[59] Soprano Martina Arroyo states, \"What interested me most was how she gave the runs and the cadenzas words. That always floored me. I always felt I heard her saying something—it was never just singing notes. That alone is an art.\"[59] Walter Legge states that, Most admirable of all her qualities, however, were her taste, elegance and deeply musical use of ornamentation in all its forms and complications, the weighting and length of every appoggiatura, the smooth incorporation of the turn in melodic lines, the accuracy and pacing of her trills, the seemingly inevitable timing of her portamentos, varying their curve with enchanting grace and meaning. There were innumerable exquisite felicities—minuscule portamentos from one note to its nearest neighbor, or over widespread intervals—and changes of color that were pure magic. In these aspects of bel canto she was supreme mistress of that art.[47] Regarding Callas' acting ability, vocal coach and music critic Ira Siff remarked, \"When I saw the final two Toscas she did in the old [Met], I felt like I was watching the actual story on which the opera had later been based.\"[64] Callas was not, however, a realistic or verismo style actress:[21] her physical acting was merely \"subsidiary to the heavy Kunst of developing the psychology of the roles under the supervision of the music, of singing the acting...Suffering, delight, humility, hubris, despair, rhapsody—all this was musically appointed, through her use of the voice flying the text upon the notes.\"[60] Seconding this opinion, verismo specialist soprano Augusta Oltrabella said, \"Despite what everyone says, [Callas] was an actress in the expression of the music, and not vice versa.\"[65][66] Matthew Gurewitsch adds, In fact the essence of her art was refinement. The term seems odd for a performer whose imagination and means of expression were so prodigious. She was eminently capable of the grand gesture; still, judging strictly from the evidence of her recordings, we know (and her few existing film clips confirm) that her power flowed not from excess but from unbroken concentration, unfaltering truth in the moment. It flowed also from irreproachable musicianship. People say that Callas would not hesitate to distort a vocal line for dramatic effect. In the throes of operatic passion plenty of singers snarl, growl, whine, and shriek. Callas was not one of them. She found all she needed in the notes.[67] Ewa Podleś likewise stated that \"It's enough to hear her, I'm positive! Because she could say everything only with her voice! I can imagine everything, I can see everything in front of my eye.\"[59] Opera director Sandro Sequi, who witnessed many Callas performances close-up, states, \"For me, she was extremely stylized and classic, yet at the same time, human—but humanity on a higher plane of existence, almost sublime. Realism was foreign to her, and that is why she was the greatest of opera singers. After all, opera is the least realistic of theater forms... She was wasted in verismo roles, even Tosca, no matter how brilliantly she could act such roles.\"[31][page needed] Scott adds, \"Early nineteenth-century opera... is not merely the antithesis of reality, it also requires highly stylized acting. Callas had the perfect face for it. Her big features matched its grandiloquence and spoke volumes from a distance.\"[21] In regard to Callas' physical acting style, Nicola Rescigno states, \"Maria had a way of even transforming her body for the exigencies of a role, which is a great triumph. In La traviata, everything would slope down; everything indicated sickness, fatigue, softness. Her arms would move as if they had no bones, like the great ballerinas. In Medea, everything was angular. She'd never make a soft gesture; even the walk she used was like a tiger's walk.\"[68] Sandro Sequi recalls, \"She was never in a hurry. Everything was very paced, proportioned, classical, precise... She was extremely powerful but extremely stylized. Her gestures were not many... I don't think she did more than 20 gestures in a performance. But she was capable of standing 10 minutes without moving a hand or finger, compelling everyone to look at her.\"[31][page needed] Edward Downes recalled Callas watching and observing her colleagues with such intensity and concentration as to make it seem that the drama was all unfolding in her head.[30] Sir Rudolf Bing similarly recalled that in Il trovatore in Chicago, \"it was Callas' quiet listening, rather than Björling's singing that made the dramatic impact... He didn't know what he was singing, but she knew.\"[69] Callas stated that, in opera, acting must be based on the music, quoting Serafin's advice to her: When one wants to find a gesture, when you want to find how to act onstage, all you have to do is listen to the music. The composer has already seen to that. If you take the trouble to really listen with your Soul and with your Ears—and I say 'Soul' and 'Ears' because the Mind must work, but not too much also—you will find every gesture there.[29] Callas' most distinguishing quality was her ability to breathe life into the characters she portrayed,[31][page needed] or in the words of Matthew Gurewitsch, \"Most mysterious among her many gifts, Callas had the genius to translate the minute particulars of a life into tone of voice.\"[67] Italian critic Eugenio Gara adds: Her secret is in her ability to transfer to the musical plane the suffering of the character she plays, the nostalgic longing for lost happiness, the anxious fluctuation between hope and despair, between pride and supplication, between irony and generosity, which in the end dissolve into a superhuman inner pain. The most diverse and opposite of sentiments, cruel deceptions, ambitious desires, burning tenderness, grievous sacrifices, all the torments of the heart, acquire in her singing that mysterious truth, I would like to say, that psychological sonority, which is the primary attraction of opera.[48] Ethan Mordden writes, \"It was a flawed voice. But then Callas sought to capture in her singing not just beauty but a whole humanity, and within her system, the flaws feed the feeling, the sour plangency and the strident defiance becoming aspects of the canto. They were literally defects of her voice; she bent them into advantages of her singing.\"[60] Giulini believes, \"If melodrama is the ideal unity of the trilogy of words, music, and action, it is impossible to imagine an artist in whom these three elements were more together than Callas.\"[21] He recalls that during Callas' performances of La traviata, \"reality was onstage. What stood behind me, the audience, auditorium, La Scala itself, seemed artifice. Only that which transpired on stage was truth, life itself.\"[31][page needed] Sir Rudolf Bing expressed similar sentiments: Once one heard and saw Maria Callas—one can't really distinguish it—in a part, it was very hard to enjoy any other artist, no matter how great, afterwards, because she imbued every part she sang and acted with such incredible personality and life. One move of her hand was more than another artist could do in a whole act.[28] To Antonino Votto, Callas was: The last great artist. When you think this woman was nearly blind, and often sang standing a good 150 feet from the podium. But her sensitivity! Even if she could not see, she sensed the music and always came in exactly with my downbeat. When we rehearsed, she was so precise, already note-perfect... She was not just a singer, but a complete artist. It's foolish to discuss her as a voice. She must be viewed totally—as a complex of music, drama, movement. There is no one like her today. She was an esthetic phenomenon.[31][page needed] During the early 1950s, an alleged rivalry arose between Callas and Renata Tebaldi, an Italian lyrico spinto soprano.[31][page needed] The contrast between Callas' often unconventional vocal qualities and Tebaldi's classically beautiful sound resurrected a debate, namely, beauty of sound versus the expressive use of sound.[31][page needed][48] In 1951, Tebaldi and Maria Callas were jointly booked for a vocal recital in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. Although the singers agreed that neither would perform encores, Tebaldi took two, and Callas was reportedly incensed.[70] This incident began the rivalry, which reached a fever pitch in the mid-1950s, at times even engulfing the two women themselves, who were said by their more fanatical followers to have engaged in verbal barbs in each other's direction. Tebaldi was quoted as saying, \"I have one thing that Callas doesn't have: a heart\",[13] and Callas was quoted in Time magazine as saying that comparing her with Tebaldi was like \"comparing Champagne with Cognac...No...with Coca Cola\".[71] However, witnesses to the interview stated that Callas had said only \"champagne with cognac\", and that it was a bystander who had quipped: \"...No...with Coca-Cola.\" Nevertheless, the Time reporter attributed the latter comment to Callas.[13] According to John Ardoin, these two singers never should have been compared.[31][page needed] Tebaldi was trained by Carmen Melis, a noted verismo specialist, and she was rooted in the early 20th century Italian school of singing just as firmly as Callas was rooted in 19th century bel canto.[31][page needed] Callas was a dramatic soprano, whereas Tebaldi was considered essentially a lyric soprano. Callas and Tebaldi generally sang a different repertoire: In the early years of her career, Callas concentrated on the heavy dramatic soprano roles and later in her career on the bel canto repertoire, whereas Tebaldi concentrated on late Verdi and verismo roles, where her limited upper extension[48] and her lack of a florid technique were not issues.[31][page needed] They shared a few roles, including Tosca in Puccini's opera and La Gioconda, which Tebaldi performed only late in her career.[citation needed] The alleged rivalry aside, Callas made remarks appreciative of Tebaldi, and vice versa. During an interview with Norman Ross Jr. in Chicago, Callas said, \"I admire Tebaldi's tone; it's beautiful—also some beautiful phrasing. Sometimes, I actually wish I had her voice.\" Francis Robinson of the Met wrote of an incident in which Tebaldi asked him to recommend a recording of La Gioconda in order to help her learn the role. Being fully aware of the alleged rivalry, he recommended Zinka Milanov's version. A few days later, he went to visit Tebaldi, only to find her sitting by the speakers, listening intently to Callas' recording. She then looked up at him and asked, \"Why didn't you tell me Maria's was the best?\"[72] Callas visited Tebaldi after a performance of Adriana Lecouvreur at the Met in 1968, and the two were reunited. In 1978, Tebaldi spoke warmly of her late colleague and summarized this rivalry: This rivality [sic] was really building from the people of the newspapers and the fans. But I think it was very good for both of us, because the publicity was so big and it created a very big interest about me and Maria and was very good in the end. But I don't know why they put this kind of rivality [sic], because the voice was very different. She was really something unusual. And I remember that I was very young artist too, and I stayed near the radio every time that I know that there was something on radio by Maria.[28] In the opinion of several singers, the heavy roles undertaken in her early years damaged Callas' voice.[65] The mezzo-soprano Giulietta Simionato, Callas' close friend and frequent colleague, stated that she told Callas that she felt that the early heavy roles led to a weakness in the diaphragm and subsequent difficulty in controlling the upper register.[73] Louise Caselotti, who worked with Callas in 1946 and 1947, prior to her Italian debut, felt that it was not the heavy roles that hurt Callas' voice, but the lighter ones.[25] Several singers have suggested that Callas' heavy use of the chest voice led to stridency and unsteadiness with the high notes.[65] In his book, Callas' husband Meneghini wrote that Callas suffered an unusually early onset of menopause, which could have affected her voice. Soprano Carol Neblett once said, \"A woman sings with her ovaries—you're only as good as your hormones.\"[60] Critic Henry Pleasants has stated that it was a loss of physical strength and breath-support that led to Callas' vocal problems, saying, Singing, and especially opera singing, requires physical strength. Without it, the singer's respiratory functions can no longer support the steady emissions of breath essential to sustaining the production of focused tone. The breath escapes, but it is no longer the power behind the tone, or is only partially and intermittently. The result is a breathy sound—tolerable but hardly beautiful—when the singer sings lightly, and a voice spread and squally when under pressure.[74] In the same vein, Joan Sutherland, who heard Callas throughout the 1950s, said in a BBC interview, [Hearing Callas in Norma in 1952] was a shock, a wonderful shock. You just got shivers up and down the spine. It was a bigger sound in those earlier performances, before she lost weight. I think she tried very hard to recreate the sort of \"fatness\" of the sound which she had when she was as fat as she was. But when she lost the weight, she couldn't seem to sustain the great sound that she had made, and the body seemed to be too frail to support that sound that she was making. Oh, but it was oh so exciting. It was thrilling. I don't think that anyone who heard Callas after 1955 really heard the Callas voice.[75] Michael Scott has proposed that Callas' loss of strength and breath support was directly caused by her rapid and progressive weight loss,[21] something that was noted even in her prime. Of her 1958 recital in Chicago, Robert Detmer wrote, \"There were sounds fearfully uncontrolled, forced beyond the too-slim singer's present capacity to support or sustain.\"[33] Photos and videos of Callas during her heavy era show a very upright posture with the shoulders relaxed and held back. Of a television broadcast from May 1960 of a recital in Hamburg, The Opera Quarterly noted, \"[W]e [can] watch ... the constantly sinking, depressed chest and hear the resulting deterioration\".[76] This continual change in posture has been cited as visual proof of a progressive loss of breath support.[21][59] Commercial and bootleg recordings of Callas from the late 1940s to 1953—the period during which she sang the heaviest dramatic soprano roles—show no decline in the fabric of the voice, no loss in volume and no unsteadiness or shrinkage in the upper register.[36][page needed] Of her December 1952 Lady Macbeth—coming after five years of singing the most strenuous dramatic soprano repertoire—Peter Dragadze wrote for Opera, \"Callas' voice since last season has improved a great deal, the second passagio on the high B-natural and C has now completely cleared, giving her an equally colored scale from top to bottom.\"[31][page needed] And of her performance of Medea a year later, John Ardoin writes, \"The performance displays Callas in as secure and free a voice as she will be found at any point in her career. The many top B's have a brilliant ring, and she handles the treacherous tessitura like an eager thoroughbred.\"[36][page needed] In recordings from 1954 (immediately after her 80-pound or 36-kilogram weight loss) and thereafter, \"not only would the instrument lose its warmth and become thin and acidulous, but the altitudinous passages would to her no longer come easily.\"[21] It was at this time that unsteady top notes first begin to appear.[36][page needed] Walter Legge, who produced nearly all of Callas' EMI/Angel recordings, states that Callas \"ran into a patch of vocal difficulties as early as 1954\": during the recording of La forza del destino, done immediately after the weight loss, the \"wobble had become so pronounced\" that he told Callas they \"would have to give away seasickness pills with every side\".[47] There were others, however, who felt that the voice had benefitted from the weight loss. Of her performance of Norma in Chicago in 1954, Claudia Cassidy wrote that \"there is a slight unsteadiness in some of the sustained upper notes, but to me her voice is more beautiful in color, more even through the range, than it used to be\".[33] And at her performance of the same opera in London in 1957 (her first performance at Covent Garden after the weight loss), critics again felt her voice had changed for the better, that it had now supposedly become a more precise instrument, with a new focus.[33] Many of her most critically acclaimed appearances are from 1954–58 (Norma, La traviata, Sonnambula and Lucia of 1955, Anna Bolena of 1957, Medea of 1958, among others). Callas' close friend and colleague Tito Gobbi thought that her vocal problems all stemmed from her state of mind: I don't think anything happened to her voice. I think she only lost confidence. She was at the top of a career that a human being could desire, and she felt enormous responsibility. She was obliged to give her best every night, and maybe she felt she wasn't [able] any more, and she lost confidence. I think this was the beginning of the end of this career.[28] In support of Gobbi's assertion, a bootleg recording of Callas rehearsing Beethoven's aria \"Ah! perfido\" and parts of Verdi's La forza del destino shortly before her death shows her voice to be in much better shape than much of her 1960s recordings and far healthier than the 1970s concerts with Giuseppe Di Stefano.[36][page needed] Soprano Renée Fleming posited that videos of Callas in the late 1950s and early 1960s reveal a posture that betrays breath-support problems: I have a theory about what caused her vocal decline, but it's more from watching her sing than from listening. I really think it was her weight loss that was so dramatic and so quick. It's not the weight loss per se—you know, Deborah Voigt has lost a lot of weight and still sounds glorious. But if one uses the weight for support, and then it's suddenly gone and one doesn't develop another musculature for support, it can be very hard on the voice. And you can't estimate the toll that emotional turmoil will take as well. I was told, by somebody who knew her well, that the way Callas held her arms to her solar plexus [allowed her] to push and create some kind of support. If she were a Soubrette, it would never have been an issue. But she was singing the most difficult repertoire, the stuff that requires the most stamina, the most strength.[59] However, writing about dramatic soprano Deborah Voigt in 2006 shortly after her 135-pound (60 kg) weight loss after gastric bypass surgery, music critic Peter G. Davis brings up comparisons with Callas and notes an increasing acidity and thinning in Voigt's voice that recall the changes in Callas' voice after her weight loss: A change has also come over Voigt's voice lately, though it's hard to tell if it's from weight loss or normal aging—controversy still rages over whether Maria Callas' drastic diets contributed to her rapid vocal decline. Not that Voigt as yet exhibits any of Callas' technical problems: Her voice continues to be reliably supported and under control. What is noticeable, however—earlier this season in Verdi's La Forza del Destino and now in Tosca—is a marked thinning of quality at the very center of the instrument, together with a slight acidity and tightening of the tone that has definitely taken the youthful bloom off, especially at the top.[77] Voigt explained how her dramatic weight loss affected her breathing and breath support: Much of what I did with my weight was very natural, vocally. Now I've got a different body—there's not as much of me around. My diaphragm function, the way my throat feels, is not compromised in any way. But I do have to think about it more now. I have to remind myself to keep my ribs open. I have to remind myself, if my breath starts to stack. When I took a breath before, the weight would kick in and give it that extra whhoomf! Now it doesn't do that. If I don't remember to get rid of the old air and re-engage the muscles, the breath starts stacking, and that's when you can't get your phrase, you crack high notes.[78] Callas attributed her problems to a loss of confidence brought about by a loss of breath support, even though she does not make the connection between her weight and her breath support. In an April 1977 interview with journalist Philippe Caloni [fr], she stated, My best recordings were made when I was skinny, and I say skinny, not slim, because I worked a lot and couldn't gain weight back; I became even too skinny ... I had my greatest successes — Lucia, Sonnambula, Medea, Anna Bolena — when I was skinny as a nail. Even for my first time here in Paris in 1958 when the show was broadcast through Eurovision, I was skinny. Really skinny.\"[79] And shortly before her death, Callas confided her own thoughts on her vocal problems to Peter Dragadze: I never lost my voice, but I lost strength in my diaphragm. ... Because of those organic complaints, I lost my courage and boldness. My vocal cords were and still are in excellent condition, but my 'sound boxes' have not been working well even though I have been to all the doctors. The result was that I overstrained my voice, and that caused it to wobble. (Gente, October 1, 1977)[25] Whether Callas' vocal decline was due to ill health, early menopause, over-use and abuse of her voice, loss of breath-support, loss of confidence, or weight loss will continue to be debated. Whatever the cause may have been, her singing career was effectively over by age 40, and even at the time of her death at age 53, according to Walter Legge, \"she ought still to have been singing magnificently\".[47] A 2010 study by Italian vocal researchers Franco Fussi and Nico Paolillo revealed Callas was very ill at the time of her death and her illness was related to her vocal deterioration. According to their findings, presented at the University of Bologna in 2010, Callas had dermatomyositis, a rare, connective tissue disease that causes a failure of the muscles and ligaments, including the larynx. They believe she was showing signs of this disease as early as the 1960s. Fussi and Paolillo cite an initial report by physician Mario Giacovazzo, who in 2002 revealed he had diagnosed Callas with dermatomyositis in 1975. Treatment included corticosteroids and immunosuppressive agents, which affect heart function.[citation needed] At an event hosted by the journal Il Saggiatore Musicale, Fussi and Paolillo presented documentation showing when and how her voice changed over time. Using modern audio technology, they analyzed live Callas studio recordings from the 1950s through the 1970s, looking for signs of deterioration. Spectrographic analysis showed that she was losing the top half of her range. Fussi observed video recordings in which Callas' posture seemed strained and weakened. He felt that her drastic weight loss in 1954 further contributed to reduced physical support of her voice.[citation needed] Fussi and Paolillo also examined restored footage of the infamous 1958 Norma \"walkout\" in Rome, which led to harsh criticism of Callas as a temperamental superstar. By applying spectrographic analysis to that footage, the researchers observed her voice was tired and she lacked control and that she had bronchitis and tracheitis as she claimed, and that the dermatomyositis was already causing her muscles to deteriorate.[80] The latter half of Callas' career was marked by a number of scandals. Following a performance of Madama Butterfly in Chicago in 1955, Callas was confronted by a process server who handed her papers about a lawsuit brought by Eddy Bagarozy, who claimed he was her agent. Callas was photographed with her mouth turned in a furious snarl.[81] The photo was sent around the world and gave rise to the myth of Callas as a temperamental prima donna and a \"Tigress\". In 1956, just before her debut at the Metropolitan Opera, Time ran a damaging cover story about Callas, with special attention paid to her difficult relationship with her mother and some unpleasant exchanges between the two.[16][82][24] In 1957, Callas was starring as Amina in La sonnambula at the Edinburgh International Festival with the forces of La Scala. Her contract was for four performances, but due to the great success of the series, La Scala decided to put on a fifth performance. Callas told the La Scala officials that she was physically exhausted and that she had already committed to a previous engagement, a party thrown for her by her friend Elsa Maxwell in Venice. Despite this, La Scala announced a fifth performance, with Callas billed as Amina. Callas refused to stay and went on to Venice. Despite the fact that she had fulfilled her contract, she was accused of walking out on La Scala and the festival. La Scala officials did not defend Callas or inform the press that the additional performance was not approved by Callas. Renata Scotto took over the part, which was the start of her international career.[citation needed] In January 1958, Callas was to open the Rome Opera House season with Norma, with Italy's president, Giovanni Gronchi, in attendance. The day before the opening night, Callas alerted the management that she was not well and that they should have a standby ready. She was told \"No one can double Callas\".[28] After being treated by doctors, she felt better on the day of performance and decided to go ahead with the opera.[21] A surviving bootleg recording of the first act reveals Callas sounding ill.[36]: 133 Feeling that her voice was slipping away, she felt that she could not complete the performance, and consequently, she cancelled after the first act. She was accused of walking out on the president of Italy in a fit of temperament, and pandemonium broke out. Doctors confirmed that Callas had bronchitis and tracheitis, and the President's wife called to tell her they knew she was sick. However, they made no statements to the media, and the endless stream of press coverage aggravated the situation.[31][page needed] A newsreel included file footage of Callas from 1955 sounding well, intimating the footage was of rehearsals for the Rome Norma, with the voiceover narration, \"Here she is in rehearsal, sounding perfectly healthy\", followed by \"If you want to hear Callas, don't get all dressed up. Just go to a rehearsal; she usually stays to the end of those.\"[83] Callas' relationship with La Scala had also started to become strained after the Edinburgh incident, and this effectively severed her major ties with her artistic home. Later in 1958, Callas and Rudolf Bing were in discussion about her season at the Met. She was scheduled to perform in Verdi's La traviata and in Macbeth, two very different operas which almost require totally different singers. Callas and the Met could not reach an agreement, and before the opening of Medea in Dallas, Bing sent a telegram to Callas terminating her contract. Headlines of \"Bing Fires Callas\" appeared in newspapers around the world.[13] Nicola Rescigno later recalled, \"That night, she came to the theater, looking like an empress: she wore an ermine thing that draped to the floor, and she had every piece of jewellery she ever owned. And she said, 'You all know what's happened. Tonight, for me, is a very difficult night, and I will need the help of every one of you.' Well, she proceeded to give a performance [of Medea] that was historical.\"[32] Bing later said that Callas was the most difficult artist he ever worked with, \"because she was so much more intelligent. Other artists, you could get around. But Callas you could not get around. She knew exactly what she wanted, and why she wanted it.\"[28] Despite this, Bing's admiration for Callas never wavered, and in September 1959, he sneaked into La Scala in order to listen to Callas record La Gioconda for EMI.[13] Callas and Bing reconciled in the mid 1960s, and Callas returned to the Met for two performances of Tosca with her friend Tito Gobbi. In her final years as a singer, she sang in Medea and Norma, and Tosca in Paris, New York, and London from January–February 1964. Her last stage performance was July 5, 1965, at Covent Garden. A live television transmission of act 2 of the Covent Garden Tosca of 1964 was broadcast in Britain on February 9, 1964, giving a rare view of Callas in performance and of her on-stage collaboration with Tito Gobbi. In 1969, the Italian filmmaker Pier Paolo Pasolini cast Callas in her only non-operatic acting role, as the Greek mythological character of Medea, in his film by that name. The production was grueling, and according to the account in Ardoin's Callas, the Art and the Life, Callas is said to have fainted after a day of strenuous running back and forth on a mudflat in the sun. The film was not a commercial success, but as Callas' only film appearance, it documents something of her stage presence. From October 1971 to March 1972, Callas gave a series of master classes at the Juilliard School in New York. These classes later formed the basis of Terrence McNally's 1995 play Master Class. Callas staged a series of joint recitals in Europe in 1973 and in the U.S., South Korea, and Japan in 1974 with the tenor Giuseppe Di Stefano. Critically, this was a musical disaster owing to both performers' worn-out voices.[13] However, the tour was an enormous popular success. Audiences thronged to hear the two performers, who had so often appeared together in their prime. Her final public performance was on November 11, 1974, in Sapporo, Japan. Callas and Di Stafano were to have appeared together in four staged performances of Tosca in Japan in late 1975 but Callas cancelled.[84] In 1957, while still married to husband Giovanni Battista Meneghini, Callas was introduced to Greek shipping magnate Aristotle Onassis at a party given in her honor by Elsa Maxwell after a performance in Donizetti's Anna Bolena.[21] The affair that followed received much publicity in the popular press, and in November 1959, Callas left her husband. Michael Scott asserts that Onassis was not sure why Callas largely abandoned her career, but that he offered her a way out of a career that was made increasingly difficult by scandals and by vocal resources that were diminishing at an alarming rate.[21] Franco Zeffirelli, on the other hand, recalls asking Callas in 1963 why she had not practiced her singing, and Callas responding that \"I have been trying to fulfill my life as a woman.\"[28] According to one of her biographers, Nicholas Gage, Callas and Onassis had a child, a boy, who died hours after he was born on March 30, 1960.[85] In his book about his wife, Meneghini states categorically that Maria Callas was unable to bear children.[86] Various sources also dismiss Gage's claim, as they note that the birth certificates Gage used to prove this \"secret child\" were issued in 1998, twenty-one years after Callas' death.[87] Still other sources claim that Callas had at least one abortion while involved with Onassis.[88] In 1966, Callas renounced her U.S. citizenship at the American Embassy in Paris, to facilitate the end of her marriage to Meneghini.[25][89] This was because after her renunciation, she was only a Greek citizen, and under Greek law of that time, a Greek could legally marry only in a Greek Orthodox church. As she had married in a Roman Catholic church, this divorced her in Greece. The renunciation also helped her finances, as she no longer had to pay U.S. taxes on her income. Her relationship with Onassis ended two years later in 1968, when he left Callas for Jacqueline Kennedy. However, the Onassis family's private secretary Kiki writes in her memoir that even while Aristotle was with Jackie, he frequently met with Maria in Paris, where they resumed what had now become a clandestine affair.[85] Callas spent her last years living largely in isolation in Paris and died of a heart attack at age 53 on September 16, 1977.[90] A funerary liturgy was held at St Stephen's Greek Orthodox Cathedral on rue Georges-Bizet, Paris on September 20, 1977. She was later cremated at the Père Lachaise Cemetery and her ashes were placed in the columbarium there. After being stolen and later recovered, they were scattered over the Aegean Sea, off the coast of Greece, according to her wish, in the spring of 1979.[91] During a 1978 interview, upon being asked \"Was it worth it to Maria Callas? She was a lonely, unhappy, often difficult woman\", music critic and Callas' friend John Ardoin replied: That's such a difficult question. There are times, you know, when there are people – certain people who are blessed, and cursed, with an extraordinary gift, in which the gift is almost greater than the human being. And Callas was one of these people. It was almost as if her wishes, her life, her own happiness were all subservient to this incredible, incredible gift that she was given, this gift that reached out and taught us all – taught us things about music we knew very well, but showed us new things, things we never thought about, new possibilities. I think that's why singers admire her so; I think that's why conductors admire her so; I know that's why I admire her so. And she paid a tremendously difficult and expensive price for this career. I don't think she always understood what she did or why she did. She knew she had a tremendous effect on audiences and on people. But it was not something that she could always live with gracefully or happily. I once said to her, \"It must be very enviable to be Maria Callas.\" And she said, \"No, it's a very terrible thing to be Maria Callas, because it's a question of trying to understand something you can never really understand.\" Because she couldn't explain what she did – it was all done by instinct; it was something, incredibly, embedded deep within her.[92][68] According to several Callas biographers, Vasso Devetzi, a Greek pianist near the same age as Callas, insinuated herself into Callas' trust during her last years and acted virtually as her agent.[93][94][95][96] This claim is corroborated by Iakintha (Jackie) Callas in her 1990 book Sisters, wherein she asserts that Devetzi conned Maria out of control of half of her estate while promising to establish the Maria Callas Foundation to provide scholarships for young singers; after hundreds of thousands of dollars had allegedly vanished, Devetzi finally did establish the foundation.[97] Callas' stage repertoire included the following roles:[133] All recordings are in mono unless otherwise indicated. Live performances are typically available on multiple labels. In 2014, Warner Classics (formerly EMI Classics) released the Maria Callas Remastered Edition, consisting of her complete studio recordings totaling 39 albums in a boxed set remastered at Abbey Road Studios in 24-bit/96 kHz digital sound from original master tapes.

                "content": "Greek soprano, Maria Callas, (born New York, 2 December 1923; died Paris, 16 September 1977) was one of the most iconic opera singers of the 20th century. She enjoyed unequalled artistic pre-eminence, musical instincts and intelligence; especially in the core 19th-century Italian opera (from Rossini to Puccini) in which she excelled. Callas possessed a natural authority on stage. Her voice – at least for a decade in the 1950s – was impressive albeit individual in quality. Vocally, she was agile. She was able to deliver a wide range of vocal colours depending on the mood or type of music she was singing. Continue reading as we delve into the often colourful life of Maria Callas; explore some of her most famous songs and stage roles and consider her legacy. In this section, we’ll look at Maria Callas’s upbringing during wartime Greece, her career highlights – including high-profile performances in both Europe and America, and her incredible 1965 performance in the title role of Tosca – and her legacy and personal life off-stage. Though American by birth (her Greek parents had emigrated to the USA in the year of Maria’s birth), Callas left the USA for Athens in 1937 (aged 13) when her mother became fed up with her husband’s cheating. In Greece, the young Maria Callas began her musical education at the age of 13. Her first vocal training was undertaken by Maria Trivella at the Greek National Conservatory. Callas’s then lower contralto voice raised and lightened to that of a soprano. Learn about opera voice types Video Video Video Callas launched her post-war career by singing Ponchielli’s La Gioconda in Verona under leading Italian conductor, Tullio Serafin. She was soon in demand all over Italy, often singing “heavier” soprano roles such as Verdi’s Aida and Wagner’s (Tristan and Isolde), Kundry (Parsifal) and even Brünnhilde from The Valkyrie. Serafin became a mentor to her, and he steered her away from heavier roles towards earlier, lighter-voiced Italian works. These included Bellini (I Puritani and Norma), Donizetti (Lucia di Lammermoor and Anna Bolena), Verdi’s Violetta (La traviata) and Leonora (Il trovatore), Desdemona (Otello) which includes the beautiful “Ave Maria” from Act 4 and Gilda (Rigoletto), and Puccini’s Tosca, Madame Butterfly and Gianni Schicchi which includes the famous aria “O mio babbino caro”. Callas also performed many rare and challenging ‘bel canto’ operas including Gluck’s Alceste, Cherubini’s Médée and Spontini’s La vestale. Video She made triumphant appearances at the world’s most notable opera houses throughout the 1950s. She sung at La Scala, Milan; Covent Garden, London; the Lyric Theatre of Chicago; and the Metropolitan Opera, New York. Her high-profile appearances were not without their own dramas off-stage. Callas fell out spectacularly with the Met Opera’s General Manager, Rudolf Bing. She alsohad well-known rivalry with the other leading international soprano of the period, Renata Tebaldi. Always her own fiercest critic, her exacting high standards and stringent demands on herself sometimes meant she would prefer to withdraw from an engagement, rather than sing below par and disappoint her public – despite any contractual consequences. Video Even in the 1950s, when Callas was at the height of her career and commanded the highest fees, vocal problems were becoming evident. These included an unevenness in her vocal registers and a pronounced tremolo on high notes. Some have argued that a noticeable loss of weight around 1953/54 were the cause of these vocal difficulties, or that her training was inadequate. Video To be sure, there were problems. But anyone who listens to two of Maria Callas’s greatest roles – ‘Casta diva’ from Bellini’s Norma and Tosca from 1965 (the only existing footage of a Callas role) – cannot fail to be moved by the expressive power of her acting and singing in combination. Video In the 1960s, Callas withdrew from the operatic stage more and more, probably because of the problems with her voice, but also because of changes in her personal life. She made her final operatic appearances in July 1965, in Tosca at Covent Garden. She was only 41 years old, an age when most sopranos are at their peak. Video In the late 1950s, Maria Callas began an affair with the Greek shipping magnate, Aristotle Onassis, while she was still married to her husband, Giovanni Battista Meneghini. This affair relationship received much publicity at the time, and even after Onassis married Jacqueline Kennedy (widow of President John F. Kennedy) he continued to meet frequently with Callas. It has been argued that Callas saw the affair with Onassis, which she might have hoped lead to marriage, as a way out of a career in crisis. Video After Onassis abandoned her for good, Callas attempted to revive her career by giving masterclasses at the Juilliard School in New York. She also embarked on an international series of joint recitals in 1973/4 with Giuseppe di Stefano, the tenor with whom she had performed often in her heyday. These sold-out recitals were artistically flawed – both singers were past their sell-by-date – however, they proved hugely popular with the public, who had never forgotten the Callas magic. After the final recital in November 1974, Callas withdrew from public life and lived alone in her Paris apartment, seeing virtually no one. Video In September 1977, she suffered a heart attack which was her unfortunate cause of death. Her remains were cremated, and her ashes placed in the Père Lachaise Cemetery. After being stolen and later recovered, her ashes were scattered over the Aegean Sea, according to her wish, in the spring of 1979. Even from beyond the grave, Maria Callas seemed to be playing out a drama worthy of the operatic stage. Over a century on from her birth, the fascination with Maria Callas as an artist and as a woman shows no sign of abating. She has been the subject of biographies and film documentaries, including ‘Maria by Callas’ (2018) directed by Tom Volf and ‘Maria’ (2024) directed by Pablo Larraín, her many recordings (official and pirated) sell in vast numbers, and she is the focus of stage plays and operatic events such as Marina Abramović’s 7 Deaths of Maria Callas, which played in the UK for the first time as part of the English National Opera’s 2023/24 Season. Video Maria Callas’s family was Greek however she herself was born in New York in 1923. When Callas was 13, she moved back to Athens with her mother, and this is where she began her musical training.

                "content": "Maria Callas (December 3, 1923 – September 16, 1977) was a Greek soprano. She was one of the most famous and most controversial opera singers of the 20th century. She had a very distinctive voice of great range, power and agility enabling her to sing a wide variety of roles and was a singer-actress of great dramatic intensity. She was dubbed La Divina (The Divine One) by her admirers. She was mainly associated with the Italian repertoire, particularly Bellini's Norma, Donizetti's Lucia di Lammermoor, Verdi's La traviata and Puccini's Tosca. Maria was born Maria Kalogeroupoulou at Terence Cardinal Cooke Health Care Center in New York City, to Greek parents, she returned to Greece in 1937, with her mother and older sister. There, she studied singing with Elvira de Hidalgo, and made her debut while still a teenager with the Athens Opera in 1941. During a short return to America to visit her father in 1945, she auditioned at the Metropolitan Opera without success. Her first major break came with her Italian debut in Verona in 1947, as La Gioconda. There, she met conductor Tullio Serafin who became her mentor and guided her towards the bel canto repertoire. She sang her first Norma in Florence in 1948, and the following year, as a last minute replacement, she appeared as Elvira in Bellini's I puritani in Venice, which was to be her first great success. In 1949, she married industrialist Giovanni Battista Meneghini who became her manager. She was sometimes known as Maria Meneghini Callas after her marriage. Shortly after, she made her debut at La Scala in Milan, where the major part of her career and greatest triumphs were to take place. In collaboration with conductors like Carlo Maria Giulini, Leonard Bernstein, Gianandrea Gavazzeni, and directors like Franco Zeffirelli and Luchino Visconti, lavish productions of works such as Cherubini's Medea, Spontini's La Vestale, Bellini's La sonnambula and Norma, Donizetti's Anna Bolena and Poliuto, Verdi's La traviata and Un ballo in maschera, were made especially for her to great acclaim. She also made guest appearances at the Royal Opera House in London, the Berlin State Opera, the Paris Opéra, the Lyric Chicago Opera, the Dallas Opera and the Metropolitan Opera in New York City. In 1958, she met Greek shipping magnate Aristotle Onassis which led to her divorce from Meneghini, and slowly began to withdraw from the stage. Her final appearance was in Tosca in London in 1965. She made a last world concert tour in 1973–74 with her often partner tenor Giuseppe Di Stefano, but by then her voice was almost gone. Callas died of a heart attack in Paris, France, at the age of 53.",

Match report as Arsenal beat Monaco 3-0 to close in on qualification for the last 16 of the Champions League; goals from Bukayo Saka and Kai Havertz sealed victory over the Ligue 1 side at Emirates Stadium; Gunners move third in Champions League standings with two games to play Senior Football Journalist @OliverYew Wednesday 11 December 2024 23:19, UK Please use Chrome browser for a more accessible video player Arsenal are closing in on qualification for the last 16 of the Champions League after a 3-0 victory over Monaco at Emirates Stadium. Barring a Aleksandr Golovin strike flashing inches wide of David Raya's post, Arsenal were on top from the very first whistle. They should have had the lead earlier than they did but Gabriel Jesus, who had scored just one goal in 32 matches coming to the game, was denied twice when clear through on goal by Radoslaw Majecki. However, the breakthrough eventually came in the 34th minute when Jesus teed up Bukayo Saka after good work from Myles Lewis-Skelly, who was making his first Champions League start for the Gunners. The hosts should have been further ahead before the break but skipper Martin Odegaard and Gabriel Martinelli both fired wide of the far post to keep Monaco in the game. Just like at the start of the game, Monaco almost caught Arsenal cold at the beginning of the second half. Lamine Camara's free kick picked out Thilo Kehrer, but the former West Ham defender planted his header wide of the upright. Arsenal: Raya (6), Partey (6), Saliba (6), Kiwior (7), Lewis-Skelly (8), Rice (6), Merino (6), Odegaard (7), Saka (8), Jesus (6), Martinelli (6). Subs used: Timber (6), Trossard (6), Jorginho (6), Havertz (n/a), Nwaneri (n/a). Player of the match: Bukayo Saka. The visitors should have been level midway through the second period when William Saliba uncharacteristically gifted possession to Takumi Minamino. The former Liverpool player picked out Breel Embolo in the penalty area and after turning Jakub Kiwior inside out, the Switzerland striker fired a low shot agonisingly wide. Live Champions League table Champions League fixtures Champions League results Stream Sky Sports with NOW Arsenal were hanging on but the game was eventually made safe after a gift from goalkeeper Majecki. Under pressure from Odegaard, he passed the ball straight to Saka, who made no mistake for his second goal of the night. Substitute Kai Havertz scored late to put the gloss on what was not a straightforward night for the Gunners, but they rise to third in the Champions League standings. A win in their next fixture at home to Dinamo Zagreb on January 22 would more than likely secure qualification to the last 16. It was another brilliant night for Saka, who showed his importance to Arsenal again by scoring his third and fourth Champions League goals of the season. The England international has now scored in six of his seven home Champions League appearances for the Gunners (seven goals), while he has been involved in 14 goals in 14 games overall for the Gunners in the competition (eight goals and six assists). Only Liverpool forward Mohamed Salah (16 goals and 12 assists) has been involved in more goals in all competitions among Premier League players this season than Bukayo Saka (nine goals and 12 assists). Arsenal boss Arteta said he is not surprised by Saka's contribution and backed him to keep improving. \"He's incredible,\" Arteta said. I think his goal involvement in the season in 21 matches I think is 20 goals or something ridiculous this. But that's him, very humble, a great guy to have around the place and an incredible talent. \"He keeps surprising us. \"That's what he wants to do. That's the quality that he has, that's the ambition that he has and how he's preparing himself every day. I'm not surprised, but it's very difficult to do what he's doing.\" When asked about comparisons between the numbers of Saka and Harry Kane and Vinciius Jr, Arteta added: \"You have to be able to do that consistently for many years to be in that position. What he's done at his age you can put it in brackets because you can compare what he's done in his first six years of professional football - which is exceptional. That's it. His aim is to improve. He has the players and the environment around to continue to do that and I'm sure he will. \"He's a special person. He's a great guy to have around the team. In his role, his leadership is increasing. With the young kids he is amazing, with the seniors he is amazing. He is loved by everybody, you can tell that, and when he is on that pitch, he's making the difference for us.\" Arsenal manager Mikel Arteta speaking to TNT Sports: \"Very happy with scoring three goals and keeping the clean sheet in the game - extremely happy. \"We started the game very well in the first half. It should have been three or four at least and then we could have put the game to bed. \"We didn't and in the Champions League, you have difficult moments. We had that for a period of time, probably longer than expected because we weren't precise enough, we didn't adjust to the press well enough, and we suffered. \"But then with the second goal I thought the game was in control and I'm happy with the three points.\" On scoring from open play, Arteta added: \"They were very different goals the three of them, and that's what we want from every phase of play - be a threat. \"As I said, we could have scored many more in open play. For me, open play and set-pieces are all part of the game. But anyway, very happy.\" Arsenal defender Myles Lewis-Skelly, speaking to TNT Sports, on his involvement in the first goal: \"I saw the ball getting switched over from Martin [Odegaard] and saw I was getting pressed, so I thought, 'keep calm and take the ball away from him'. I saw Gabi [Jesus] peeling off and then Bukayo [Saka] was great timing for the finish, he's always there so can't complain. \"I'm proud of myself, I believe in myself. I've come a long way and I want to thank everyone for giving me the opportunity. Hopefully it's the first of many and I push on from here. \"I'm looking up to Bukayo, he knows everything, so it's the mindset. I've learned a lot from him, I want to keep learning from him.\" Arsenal forward Bukayo Saka, speaking to TNT Sports on his pre-match advice to Myles Lewis-Skelly: \"I just said to him that this is his level. He needs to have no doubts and play with confidence. \"What he’s doing, we see it in training. I was pleased with him, he was a big part of the first goal. \"He’s very bright. He just needs to keep the same head that he’s got. His mentality is top, he’s always asking questions, eager to learn. I’m so proud of him.\" Sky Sports' Paul Merson on Soccer Special: \"There will be a lot of proud people at Arsenal, people involved in the academy. To bring players through like Bukayo Saka, Myles Lewis-Skelly and Ethan Nwaneri, young players playing in the Champions League, especially when you are talking about a team of this magnitude. \"It's hard to do now so everyone at the club should be proud of themselves. \"Watching them play, you wouldn't know they are kids. Lewis-Skelly gave the ball away once just before he came off and he was unlucky with that. \"Then Nwaneri comes on, gets on the ball and just plays. Fair play to everyone at Arsenal. \"In the end, it was a comfortable win and a good night's work.\" Monaco boss Adi Hutter: \"Arsenal deserved this win. They were the better team. This is what we expected but second half, I don't want to say we were dominating but we were much better. Had some good chances with Kehrer and Minamino. The second goal was the crucial moment - we gave Arsenal some gifts. \"At this level, it's impossible. It's not acceptable to do what we did. These mistakes are more gifts - we were lucky that Arsenal missed so many chances. \"Second half, I was happy how we started. This is the football I want to see - brave, here in Emirates Stadium. We have a young squad. There were moments when we were closer to the equaliser. But then after the second goal, it was too much at this level.\" Tom from Southampton became a millionaire for free with Super 6! Could you be the next jackpot winner? Play for free! © 2024 Sky UK",

Arsenal took another step towards the Champions League knockout rounds as Bukayo Saka struck twice to help beat Monaco. The hosts climbed back into the top eight of the league phase table with a 3-0 victory that always looked likely to be secured. Saka opened the scoring amid a flurry of first-half chances after good work in the build-up from youngster Myles Lewis-Skelly, utilised at left-back on his first Champions League start, and Gabriel Jesus. And it was the England star who put the result beyond doubt 12 minutes from time, capitalising on a horrendous error in possession from visiting goalkeeper Radoslaw Majecki. Ten minutes later, a third arrived as Kai Havertz’s shin diverted a Saka drive on to Thilo Kehrer’s foot and into the roof of the net. Three more points leave Arsenal well placed to secure a potentially vital top eight finish that would spare them the added inconvenience of a two-legged play-off fixture. They face Dinamo Zagreb and Girona in their final two fixtures in January. Re-live all of the Champions League action in our live blog below: Bukayo Saka continues to show the way, as well as new levels. Arsenal have recently been a team in need of a bit of stability and sense of comfort, and this 3-0 win over AS Monaco duly offered them a straight line into the Champions League last 16. They have leapt to fourth in this expanded Champions League group stage with four wins from six, although that in a table where everyone down to eight has 13 points, ninth-place Borussia Dortmund have 11 and 19th-placed Club Brugge. have 10, with the top eight going through. A bit of nerve is going to be required to keep them there, which was why the manner of this victory was all the more important. Arsenal 3-0 Monaco: Saka struck twice as Mikel Arteta’s side closed in on the Champions League knockout rounds “I’m very happy with this. Extremely happy. We started the game really well, we couold have put the game to bed in the first half. We had a period of time where we weren’t precise enough and we suffered, but from the second goal the game was under control. We’re happy to have the three points. “We want to be a threat in every phase of play. It’s a great highlight for Myles to make his Champions League debut. The subs helped us, gave us energy and a little bit more structure. “What I like about Myles is his confidence, the positions he takes and how he penetrates with the ball. He’s one of our own. It’s a nice feeling to be able to help somebody change their life.” “Bukayo looks really mature. His goal involvements this season are ridiculous. That’s him - very humble, a great guy to have around the place and a great talent. He’s a special person. His leadership is increasing. He’s loved by everybody and on the pitch he is making a difference for us.” Saka says: “I just said to [Myles] that this is his level, have no doubts and play with confidence. He was a big part of the first goal. “His future is very bright. He’s always asking questions and looking to learn. I’m so proud of him.” And Lewis-Skelly beams: “I saw the ball getting switched over by Martin, I saw I was getting pressed so I thought, ‘stay calm and take the ball away from him’. A great ball from Gabriel and Bukayo is always there to tap in. “I’m proud of myself. I’ve come a long way and I want to thank everyone. Hopefully it’s the first of many. Bukayo has everything. I’ve learned a lot from him and I want to keep learning from him.” Comfortable enough, in the end, for Arsenal, who climb up to third in the Champions League table and look strongly placed to avoid a playoff tie. Dinamo Zagreb and Girona to come - without being dismissive of either side, Mikel Arteta will surely feel very confident about his side’s prospects. Into three added minutes. A third! Arsenal take a free kick quickly and catch Monaco napping. Mikel Merino’s shot is blocked but Bukayo Saka’s effort looks bound for goal, taking a flick off the shin of Kai Havertz and then a defender’s boot to climb into the roof of the net. Ethan Nwaneri drives from 25 yards right at Radoslaw Majecki. A shame for Leandro Trossard, who slips just as he tries to release a shot after some lively interplay. Not quite Marc Cucurella-esque, but an untimely loss of footing nonetheless. Can Monaco threaten a thrilling finish? It just feels like the nature of that goal has punctured any hope they had at 1-0.

                "content": "Arsenal took another step towards the Champions League knockout rounds as Bukayo Saka struck twice to help beat Monaco. The hosts climbed back into the top eight of the league phase table with a 3-0 victory that always looked likely to be secured. Saka opened the scoring amid a flurry of first-half chances after good work in the build-up from youngster Myles Lewis-Skelly, utilised at left-back on his first Champions League start, and Gabriel Jesus. And it was the England star who put the result beyond doubt 12 minutes from time, capitalising on a horrendous error in possession from visiting goalkeeper Radoslaw Majecki. Ten minutes later, a third arrived as Kai Havertz’s shin diverted a Saka drive on to Thilo Kehrer’s foot and into the roof of the net. Three more points leave Arsenal well placed to secure a potentially vital top eight finish that would spare them the added inconvenience of a two-legged play-off fixture. They face Dinamo Zagreb and Girona in their final two fixtures in January.

Dinamo Zagreb and Girona to come - without being dismissive of either side, Mikel Arteta will surely feel very confident about his side’s prospects. 21:53 , Harry Latham-Coyle 21:50 , Harry Latham-Coyle Into three added minutes. 21:48 , Harry Latham-Coyle A third! Arsenal take a free kick quickly and catch Monaco napping. Mikel Merino’s shot is blocked but Bukayo Saka’s effort looks bound for goal, taking a flick off the shin of Kai Havertz and then a defender’s boot to climb into the roof of the net. 21:46 , Harry Latham-Coyle Ethan Nwaneri drives from 25 yards right at Radoslaw Majecki. 21:44 , Harry Latham-Coyle A shame for Leandro Trossard, who slips just as he tries to release a shot after some lively interplay. Not quite Marc Cucurella-esque, but an untimely loss of footing nonetheless. 21:42 , Harry Latham-Coyle Can Monaco threaten a thrilling finish? It just feels like the nature of that goal has punctured any hope they had at 1-0. 21:40 , Harry Latham-Coyle Martin Odegaard is replaced by Ethan Nwaneri as Mikel Arteta wastes no time hauling his captain off with the game seemingly won. 21:38 , Harry Latham-Coyle A defensive nightmare for Monaco and Bukayo Saka capitalises! That ought to seal it. Kai Havertz and Saka press high and hard, forcing Mohammed Salisu into a foolish pass back to his goalkeeper Radoslaw Majecki. The Pole looks lost as ball and Havertz arrive upon him in unison, with his stab only landing at the feet of an alert Saka. In goes his, and Arsenal’s second. 21:34 , Harry Latham-Coyle Havertz’s first involvement is a good one, showing fine ball control to nimbly navigate between two Monaco defenders and liberate Leandro Trossard. Trossard again fails to connect with Martin Odegaard, though, and then blazes over the bar when the ball is returned to him. 21:32 , Harry Latham-Coyle Searching for a second that would surely kill this fixture off, Mikel Arteta swaps strikers: Kai Havertz on, Gabriel Jesus off. 21:30 , Harry Latham-Coyle Arsenal haven’t actually registered a shot since the restart after the half-time oranges. Leandro Trossard’s slide-rule pass is overhit and out of reach for Martin Odegaard. 21:28 , Harry Latham-Coyle Martin Odegaard is furious as the referee awards a free kick Monaco’s way, the Arsenal captain losing his cool, rather, before his calm head returns. Gabriel Jesus ensures nothing comes of the set piece. 21:25 , Harry Latham-Coyle Almost 1-1! Arsenal don’t settle after those alterations and give the ball away in their own final third to the lively Takumi Minamino. Breel Embolo lets Minamino’s pass run across him and strikes as he swivels, ruffling the side netting but not, crucially for a beaten David Raya, the back of the net. 21:23 , Harry Latham-Coyle Here come the Arsenal reinforcements. Jorginho, Leandro Trossard and Jurrien Timber replace Declan Rice, Gabriel Martinelli and Myles Lewis-Skelly, who has had a very tidy night at left-back on the occasion of his first Champions League strat. 21:22 , Harry Latham-Coyle Before they can arrive, Takumi Minamino’s goalward prod is flopped upon by David Raya, claiming in comfort as he hits the deck on his left side. 21:21 , Harry Latham-Coyle A trio of substitutes are stripping off having been summoned from the Arsenal bench. 21:19 , Harry Latham-Coyle Arsenal’s large men assemble themselves for a corner routine, but the blockers aren’t in place to prevent Radoslaw Majecki palming away with an outstretched right arm. 21:17 , Harry Latham-Coyle Perhaps in recognition of that threat, Arsenal lift the intensity, Mohammed Salisu just about sorting his feet out to skew Gabriel Martinelli’s dangerous cross behind. 21:15 , Harry Latham-Coyle Monaco haven’t necessarily looked a major threat in open play so far, particularly since the first 15 minutes, but that is better: Vanderson draws a corner out of Jakub Kiwior with Breel Embolo lurking. The set piece lands in the hands of David Raya. 21:12 , Harry Latham-Coyle Gabriel Martinelli tricks his way down to an advanced crossing position in the left corner, though can’t pick out a teammate. 21:11 , Harry Latham-Coyle Not Takumi Minamino’s best minute. The Japan midfielder first blasts a volley on to Highbury Fields, leaning back much too far as he strikes, before being caught so far offside that the referee is blowing up before his assistant even raises his flag. 21:09 , Harry Latham-Coyle Aside from the goal, Bukayo Saka has been relatively quiet tonight, with much of Arsenal’s best build-up play favouring the other wing. He’s a little frustrated when he runs out of room after an exchange of passes with Thomas Partey. 21:06 , Harry Latham-Coyle Close! Thilo Kehrer rubs his head in anguish having broken free of the Arsenal defence to steer Lamine Camara’s free kick towards goal. Not far away at all from the former West Ham man! 21:05 , Harry Latham-Coyle Early intent from Arsenal, and Gabriel Jesus should really play a better pass through to Gabriel Martinelli. It’s on his colleagues heels rather than toes, though, allowing Monaco to recover and clear. 21:03 , Harry Latham-Coyle The players are back out there, with Gabriel Martinelli amongst them even after dicing with danger at the end of the first 45 minutes having been cautioned early. A change for Monaco: Takumi Minamino adds a little extra midfield creativity and experience at the expense of Soungoutou Magassa. 20:49 , Harry Latham-Coyle Arsenal firmly on top, then, having found their groove as the half wore on to cut a pretty disorganised Monaco defence apart. Could their profligacy prove costly, though? The hosts have squandered at least three excellent openings. Bukayo Saka’s goal was, however, rather tidily taken: Bukayo Saka with an easy finish following a brilliant Gabriel Jesus pass 😮‍💨Some incredible play from Myles Lewis-Skelly on his first Champions League start 👏📺 @tntsports & @discoveryplusUK pic.twitter.com/GJHS03AXiD — Football on TNT Sports (@footballontnt) December 11, 2024 20:47 , Harry Latham-Coyle 20:47 , Harry Latham-Coyle One additional minute at the end of the first half. Gabriel Martinelli almost puts himself in hot water as he is whistled twice in a matter of moments, the Brazilian booked earlier and thus rather fortunate that referee Felipe Massa feels no need to go to his pocket again. 20:45 , Harry Latham-Coyle The good news, I guess, for Arsenal is that they are creating plenty of chances in open play, which has been a problem of late. Only one of those has been converted, though - and I think Monaco will be relatively pleased if it remains 1-0 at the interval, which is imminent. 20:43 , Harry Latham-Coyle The offiside flag is up as Gabriel Martinelli curls beyond the far stick as Arsenal again part Monaco’s defence a little too easily. I’m not sure Martinelli was offside on the replay - and the hosts could really be out of sight by now. 20:41 , Harry Latham-Coyle It should be 2-0! Dreadful play from Soungoutou Magassa, a blind ball never with a hope of getting to Thilo Kehrer given the intervening presence of Martin Odegaard. Having skipped past the German defender, Odegaard bears down on goal and drags his effort past both goalkeeper Radoslaw Majecki and the post. 20:39 , Harry Latham-Coyle Another glimpse for Arsenal, Gabriel Martinelli gathering and taking aim in one movement. A few feet wide with the snapshot. 20:38 , Harry Latham-Coyle Akliouche is left alone by Lewis-Skelly and lifts a cross-cum-shot towards the far corner. David Raya and his defenders watch it go. 20:37 , Harry Latham-Coyle That really was tidy stuff from the 18-year-old left-back, under duress from Maghnes Akliouche but pivoting away from him with aplomb. 20:35 , Harry Latham-Coyle Fine work from Myles Lewis-Skelly and Bukayo Saka taps home the opener! A delightful passing move. Lewis-Skelly is at the heart of it, taking Martin Odegaard’s switch and evading a would-be tackler. He slots in Gabriel Jesus, who measures his low cross pperfectly to allow Saka to provide the finishing touches. 20:33 , Harry Latham-Coyle Gabriel Martinelli grabs a fox-trotting Aleksandr Golovin by the wrist and spins him across the dancefloor, earning himself a yellow card. The Brazilian accepts it without complaint. 20:32 , Harry Latham-Coyle Those two big chances do mean that Gabriel Jesus’s lean scoring run continues - for now, at least. It’s been a curious period for the forward but there are some signs of sharpness tonight. 20:30 , Harry Latham-Coyle Another outstanding stop! There’s no fault on the part of Gabriel Jesus here, latching on to a firm Gabriel Martinelli pass and holding off Thilo Kehrer. Kehrer gets a deflecting foot in which makes the savve all the tougher for Radoslaw Majecki, but the Monaco goalkeeper’s akimbo limbs do the job. 20:27 , Harry Latham-Coyle Huge chance! A superb save from Radoslaw Majecki but Gabriel Jesus has to be scoring, the Brazilian sprung by a straight, long pass that the goalkeeper for some reason doesn’t come to collect. Jesus hits the bouncing ball low on the volley and Majecki thrusts out a blocking right leg to deny him. 20:26 , Harry Latham-Coyle Martin Odegaard picks the ball up in the box and shakes some salsa hips in a bid to create enough room to stab a shot away. He does, eventually, curl an effort goalwards, but the required arc isn’t generated to find the target. 20:24 , Harry Latham-Coyle Smart play from Bukayo Saka, sent down a blind alley but using his body to force a foul from Soungoutou Magassa about 35 yards from his own goal. 20:22 , Harry Latham-Coyle Declan Rice gets himself into and out of bother, putting the pedal down to ensure a loose touch isn’t pounced upon by a pair of pressuring Monaco players. The midfielder then shows off his ever-impressive striding speed to come forward but fails to release Gabriel Jesus. 20:21 , Harry Latham-Coyle Some news, by the way, on former Arsenal striker Folarin Balogun, absent from the Monaco squad tonight with a shoulder injury - the American is set for surgery on the problem, with the prognosis for a return uncertain. 20:19 , Harry Latham-Coyle A midfield misfire affords Monaco the opportunity to come forward at speed, though support for Lamine Camara is short, and Breel Embolo almost demands the midfielder turn back to find a teammate rather than try to go it alone. Camara heeds the call as both teams settle back into shape. 20:17 , Harry Latham-Coyle That said, the game maybe hasn’t quite burst into life just yet. Mikel Arteta tugs at his bottom lip as he paces around the technical area. The Arsenal 🫡 pic.twitter.com/Vt5qMMJ3Ol — Arsenal (@Arsenal) December 11, 2024 20:16 , Harry Latham-Coyle That Gabriel Martinelli/Mikel Merino connection is showing some really promising signs for the hosts. Having got to the byline, the Spaniard’s latest delivery is cleared well by a Monaco defender. Merino is being afforded the freedom by Myles Lewis-Skelly tucking in to a midfield position he would more often occupy. 20:14 , Harry Latham-Coyle Embolo is down clutching an ankle after a challenge from Mikel Merino, and the Emirates Stadium crowd aren’t happy at all when Arsenal put the ball out so he can be seen to. In fact, the medics aren’t even coming on - Embolo is helped back to his feet by a heave from referee Davide Massa, which draws a few jeers. 20:12 , Harry Latham-Coyle Soft from Breel Embolo, letting the ball bounce of a fleshy bit of his body after Monaco had worked the angles quite nicely to progress through midfield. The Swiss striker chases hard to try to atone for his error of control but Arsenal settle into possession. 20:10 , Harry Latham-Coyle Just wide! Aleksandr Golovin jinks by Declan Rice and releases a crisp strike that has David Raya scrambling. A foot or two wide of Raya’s left-hand post. 20:09 , Harry Latham-Coyle Merino is getting forward with relative regularity as Gabriel Martinelli holds width on the left. Monaco right-back Vanderson handles his compatriot well as Martinelli attempts to make inroads, and a neat piece of footwork from the full-back draws a free kick out of Myles Lewis-Skelly. 20:07 , Harry Latham-Coyle Arsenal again get joy down that left side, Mikel Merino this time breaking free from midfield. He fizzes across the face of Majecki with no teammate quite close enough to slide home. 20:06 , Harry Latham-Coyle First chance. Gabriel Jesus pinches possession on the edge of the Monaco box and is neatly played in thereafter. The striker tries to open his body up and curl for the corner but his low effort ends up straight at Radoslaw Majecki in the visitors’ goal. 20:05 , Harry Latham-Coyle Partey shows good strength to get away from Aleksandr Golovin, who eventually tugs him back as the makeshift right-back surges towards the halfway line. 20:04 , Harry Latham-Coyle Thomas Partey and Bukayo Saka collide, both down with a bump after the former had fouled Caio Henrique. No major harm done - Saka tugs his socks back up as he rises to his feet. 20:02 , Harry Latham-Coyle A fast start from Monaco, immediately into their passing stride. The ball evades Maghnes Akliouche in an inside right position, though, to end the movement. 20:01 , Harry Latham-Coyle Up and running. 19:56 , Harry Latham-Coyle Out the players come into the chilly evening Emirates air, following along behind an Italian officiating team led by Davide Massa. 19:51 , Harry Latham-Coyle Born in Islington, Myles Lewis-Skelly has been at Arsenal for nearly a decade already and is rapidly making strides at senior level.

A team that is superbly well organised, really intense, really good in transition moments as well with a lot of quality, so it’s going to be a very good test for us. “We have a really good link as well with Arsene [Wenger], Thierry [Henry] as well. There’s a big history there. It’s a very special club, a special place, so we welcome them here and will hopefully be better than them to try to win the game.” 19:10 , Harry Latham-Coyle It is a bit of a surprise to see Kieran Tierney given the comments of his manager yesterday. “He is ready, he’s training really well and he’s going to have an opportunity for sure,” Mikel Arteta said of Tierney. “The way the team is looking at the moment, he is going to do that for that reason and because he’s earned it. The way he’s behaved, the way he’s been with us because he’s willing to do it and when that happens, you have to give those opportunities to players.” 19:00 , Harry Latham-Coyle “It will obviously be a very big match for us, but we are here in London to showcase our style of play; committed football. It is difficult to face us, and we will be on the lookout for any opportunity. We don’t just want to be good opponents. “They are very strong at set pieces, it’s a real weapon for them. They train a lot on this, but we have an idea of ​​how we should defend them. And we can also be a threat to them in this area, because we too are very efficient.” 18:52 , Harry Latham-Coyle With no Denis Zakaria, Soungoutou Magassa is handed a starting midfield role for the visitors.

Arsenal have taken a giant step towards securing a place in the Champions League last-16 after recording a 3-0 win over Monaco as Bukayo Saka netted a brace before turning provider for Kai Havertz in the closing stages. However, despite the margin of victory, the Gunners’ profligacy in front of goal will no doubt be of concern to Mikel Arteta as his side ought to have had the game wrapped up by half-time but Gabriel Jesus and Gabriel Martinelli were guilty of missing some guilt-edged opportunities. That gave the visitors confidence and they improved after the break. Tilo Kehrer and Breel Embolo both passed up presentable chances but ultimately the game was put out of the Ligue 1 outfit’s reach with those two late goals as the North London club enjoyed the perfect night as they move on to 13 points in this new Champions League league phase and are very much on course to qualify for the last 16 with Dinamo Zagreb and Girona to come in the new year.

Read the full story here! Bukayo Saka’s double ensured Arsenal remained well on track for a top-eight Champions League finish after a 3-0 victory over Monaco. Saka opened the scoring midway through the first-half of a game that would have been over by the break had the home side not wasted several fine chances. Monaco rallied after the interval and a nervy finish appeared in store until some poor defensive play gifted Saka a second and Arsenal some breathing space, before substitute Kai Havertz flicked home late on. The win leaves Arsenal third on 13 points in the Champions League table with games against Dinamo Zagreb and Girona to come. Here’s how Mikel Arteta’s side rated at the Emirates...

                "content": "Corbin Brian Burnes (born October 22, 1994) is an American professional baseball pitcher who is a free agent. He has previously played in Major League Baseball (MLB) for the Milwaukee Brewers and Baltimore Orioles. The Brewers selected Burnes in the fourth round of the 2016 MLB draft, and he made his MLB debut in 2018. Burnes is a four-time All-Star. He won the National League Cy Young Award in 2021, when he led the National League (NL) in earned run average. He led the NL in strikeouts in 2022. Burnes attended Centennial High School in Bakersfield, California. In 2013, his senior year, he had a 9–4 win–loss record with a 2.23 earned run average (ERA) in 22 appearances.[1] After high school, he enrolled and played college baseball at Saint Mary's College of California.[2][3] In 2015, he played collegiate summer baseball with the Orleans Firebirds of the Cape Cod Baseball League.[4] In 2016, his junior year, he posted a 9–2 record with a 2.48 ERA in 16 starts. After the season, he was drafted by the Milwaukee Brewers in the fourth round of the 2016 Major League Baseball draft.[5] Burnes made his professional debut with the Arizona League Brewers and was later promoted to the Wisconsin Timber Rattlers.[6] In 35+2⁄3 innings pitched between Arizona and Wisconsin, Burnes posted a 3–0 record with a 2.02 ERA. He started the 2017 season with the Carolina Mudcats and was later promoted to the Biloxi Shuckers after recording a 1.05 ERA after ten starts.[7][8] Burnes finished 2017 with a combined 8–3 record and 1.67 ERA between both teams.[9] The Brewers named him their minor league pitcher of the year after the season.[10] MLB.com ranked Burnes as Milwaukee's second-best prospect going into the 2018 season.[11] He began the season with the Colorado Springs Sky Sox.[12] The Brewers promoted Burnes to the majors for the first time on July 8, 2018.[13] He made his major league debut on July 10, pitching two scoreless innings, striking out one, and recording his first major league save.[14] In the 2018 NLDS against the Colorado Rockies, he pitched four scoreless innings in relief across two appearances, earning the win in the clinching 6–0 Game 3 victory. In the 2018 NLCS, Burnes got the last six outs of their game six win against the Dodgers.[citation needed] To start 2019, Burnes began the year in the starting rotation. However, he struggled in that role, allowing 11 home runs across his first 3 starts. It was announced he would move back to the bullpen. He continued to struggle in the bullpen, compiling a 9.00 ERA through 26 appearances. He was placed on the injured list on July 15 with shoulder discomfort. He finished the season with a 1–5 record and an 8.82 ERA in 49 innings. In the shortened 2020 season, Burnes pitched to a 4–1 record and recorded an ERA of 2.11 while striking out 88 batters in 59+2⁄3 innings. He finished 6th in the NL Cy Young voting.[15] Burnes struck out 40 batters without issuing a walk in his first four starts of 2021, an unprecedented four game stretch for an MLB starting pitcher.[16] On May 13, Burnes set the MLB record for the most strikeouts to begin a season before issuing a walk, with 58, surpassing the previous record held by Kenley Jansen.[17] Burnes was named to the 2021 MLB All-Star Game.[18] On August 12, Burnes tied an MLB record after striking out 10 consecutive batters in a game against the Chicago Cubs.[19] On September 11, Burnes pitched the first eight innings of a combined no-hitter with Josh Hader against the Cleveland Indians, in which he struck out 14 batters. He held a perfect game until a seventh-inning walk to Myles Straw.[20] Burnes finished the 2021 season with an 11–5 record and led the major leagues in ERA (2.43), strikeouts per nine innings (12.6), home runs per nine innings (0.4), and strikeout-to-walk ratio (6.88).[21] He won the National League Cy Young Award, becoming the third Brewers pitcher to win the award.[22] He was also named to the first 2021 All-MLB Team as a starting pitcher.[23] Burnes was selected as the starter for Game 1 of the 2021 NLDS against the Atlanta Braves. Burnes pitched six shutout innings, striking out six. He was not credited with the win, however, as he battled in a tight pitchers' duel with Atlanta's Charlie Morton. Milwaukee won the game, 2–1.[citation needed] On March 22, 2022, Burnes signed a $6.5 million contract with the Brewers, avoiding salary arbitration.[24] The Brewers named Burnes their Opening Day starting pitcher.[25] He was named to the 2022 MLB All-Star Game.[26] In 2022, Burnes was 12–8 with a 2.94 ERA in 202 innings, and struck out a league-high 243 batters.[27] On defense, he had a .961 fielding percentage.[27] He was a finalist for the NL Gold Glove Award at pitcher, but it was won for the third straight season by Max Fried.[28] Burnes went to salary arbitration with the Brewers, with the arbiter choosing the $10.01 million salary requested by the Brewers, rather than the $10.75 million requested by Burnes. He said that the process \"definitely hurt\" his relationship with the franchise.[29] Burnes started for the Brewers on Opening Day.[30] In 32 starts for Milwaukee, he posted a 10–8 record and 3.39 ERA with 200 strikeouts, and was named an All–Star for the third straight season.[31] On February 1, 2024, the Brewers traded Burnes to the Baltimore Orioles in exchange for DL Hall, Joey Ortiz, and a compensatory draft pick.[32] He made 32 appearances (32 starts) for the Orioles in 2024, pitching to a 2.92 ERA and a 15-9 record with 181 strikeouts across 194.1 innings pitched.[33] After the 2024 season, Burnes became a free agent.[34] Burnes is a power pitcher who has thrown six different pitches: a four-seam fastball between 94 and 97 MPH, a sinker between 95 and 97 MPH, a changeup between 88 and 91 MPH, a slider between 86 and 89 MPH, a curveball between 80 and 83 MPH, and a cut fastball between 93 and 96 MPH. He virtually abandoned his four-seamer after 2020 after finding far more success exclusively using his cutter.[35] In 2024, Burnes will debut a second curveball, about 5 MPH faster than his first, in strikeout situations.[36] Burnes is the son of Rick and Kandi Burnes.[37] Burnes and his wife Brooke were married in 2020;[38][39] they have two children.[40][41]",

                "title": "Corbin Burnes Free Agency Statcast Analysis",
                "content": "Mike Petriello Corbin Burnes is maybe the most interesting free-agent starting pitcher available (non-Roki Sasaki division), and it’s not hard to see why. Over the past four seasons, the four-time All-Star and 2021 Cy Young Award winner is second only to Zack Wheeler in Wins Above Replacement. That stretch culminated with an All-MLB First Team selection in his first -- and maybe only -- year with Baltimore. He’s also a perfect example of modern pitching enlightenment, which is to say “he had an 8.82 ERA in 2019 and then completely changed his pitch shapes and usage to become an ace.” We saw that ability to change within the context of 2024, as well, as his strikeout rate plummeted in-season -- raising some questions about what that would do to his market -- before he fixed his cutter, restored his sweeper and ended up finishing with one of the best months of his career. For all of his obvious skill, he can also be a pitcher of extremes, and that is what interests us today. As Burnes heads off to the market to make some team quite happy to have him, there’s something you might not have realized he led the Majors in -- and something he was dead last in, too. As we said: extremes. The good: No one makes batters look foolish more often For years, this was simply an eye test thing. But no more; along with the introduction of Statcast’s bat tracking metrics in 2024 came “swords,” which is a way to actually quantify the most awkward, uncomfortable swinging strikes. There’s plenty more on that here, including how they’re defined, but the short version is: If the bat crosses the front face of the plate, doesn’t come all the way back around, and is in the slowest 10% of swings for that player, it’s a sword. It’s putting a number to a stomachache, really. There are bad swings and then there are bad swings. It’s not what you want, if you’re a hitter. It’s perhaps more of an entertainment stat than an analytical one, except for the fact that when you look at the pitchers who got the most swords in 2024, you start to realize something. These are really good pitchers, and maybe there’s some value in identifying the pitchers who don’t just miss bats, but manage to do it in a way that makes the best hitters on the planet look that bad, that often. Most swords, 2024 That’s a list you want to be on, right? Put another way: 12% of Burnes’ swinging strikes were of the ‘sword’ variety, the most in the Majors, ahead of many of the same names but also top relievers like Griffin Jax (the only other pitcher north of 10%). So while Burnes didn’t have the most strikeouts or the most swinging strikes, what he did have was the most that made a batter look, well, awful. For all of the metrics that don’t match the eye test, this is one that’s very much intended to. In Burnes' case, he managed to do it on five different pitch types – and since you’re dying to see what it looks like to make hitters look that foolish, enjoy this compilation of our dozen favorites. Sign up to receive our daily Morning Lineup to stay in the know about the latest trending topics around Major League Baseball. Or, perhaps, spare a thought for poor Zach DeLoach, who did it three times (on three different pitch types) in an 0-for-4 showing on Sept. 2. Does it matter, to make batters look bad, as opposed to just piling up whiffs? Maybe, maybe not. But it’s hard not to notice that after collecting 15 swords in July and August combined, Burnes captured 14 in September alone after fixing his repertoire. It was the second-most in a month of any pitcher all year. So that’s the great news. What’s the flip side here? The bad: He’s the absolute weakest at preventing runners from going wild. Burnes allowed 41 stolen bases last year, the most in the Majors, and the most in Baltimore history. There’s obvious necessary context in any historic numbers like that, given the 2023 rule changes that made stealing bases easier, but “allowed the most steals in the Majors in 2024” requires no such explanation. No one was easier to advance against. But there’s so much context required in evaluating steal attempts, like if the runner was fast, or the leads were good, or the catcher can or can’t throw. Thankfully, we can go beyond just “most steals allowed” and into some advanced Statcast metrics, which show, perhaps unsurprisingly, that Burnes allowed the most advances on the bases of anyone. Fewest base advances prevented vs. avg, pitchers, 2024 “Holding a runner on” means preventing them from advancing, and that’s what this is saying -- being minus-21 here means he allowed 24 more advances than the average pitcher, given his situations, and in return only got three more outs than the average pitcher would have. On the other hand, someone who was very good at this -- like Shota Imanaga of the Cubs -- was plus-8, meaning that Burnes was nearly 30 base advances weaker than the best of the best. That’s steals, sure. But it’s not all steals, either. To start with, on three different occasions, Burnes allowed a free base by trying a third pickoff throw and failing to get the runner, tied for the most in baseball. Those aren’t steals, but they are free bases given, which all count. So what’s behind all of this? There’s a lot of moving parts, so let’s break it down. Is it his catchers?Probably not. Baltimore catchers had a 20% caught stealing percentage, which is essentially average (the Majors had a 21% caught stealing rate) -- and that would have been nearly 24% with Burnes removed. Both Adley Rutschman (+1 CS above avg) and James McCann (+0) rated as average in the advanced Statcast metrics, which account for a runner’s speed and distance, and Burnes threw to them about evenly anyway. Were the other O’s pitchers poor at this?Not really. If all Baltimore pitchers were bad across the board, it might point to something beyond Burnes, but it’s not this, either. While Craig Kimbrel (-7 base advances prevented) was as poor at this as he usually is, the rest of the O’s pitchers rated from roughly average to actually pretty good, in Grayson Rodriguez’s case. It’s a Burnes-specific issue. Why was he poor?It’s mostly about big leads, and the willingness of runners to try. Consider this: When runners at first (in steal opportunities) take a lead off of Burnes, they get off to a 10.4 foot lead, which is relatively average. By the time he releases the pitch, they’re up to 15.5 feet off first, which is a fraction of a foot off of being the largest lead allowed in baseball. Take the difference -- 5.1 feet of distance gained while the pitcher is in motion -- and it’s essentially tied for the largest amount of lead distance gained. That’s a lot of ground covered, and bad situations for his catchers. You can really see it in action here, when Seiya Suzuki -- an outfielder with good but hardly elite speed -- stole in July. McCann had a good throw from his knees, with a strong 1.94 second pop time, but because Suzuki was 26 feet off of first when the ball was released, there was hardly anything the catcher could do about it. It was the same thing earlier in the year when William Contreras gained 19 feet during Burnes’s motion, and is 33 feet off first base by the time the ball comes out, giving Rutschman no prayer of throwing him out. (In the catcher version of this metric, Rutschman was given a mere 3% chance of catching the runner, meaning that while he had to eat the one stolen base allowed, he was barely dinged in Statcast’s metrics, because of the opportunity he was given.) The broadcast video, however, is not sufficient to show you what really happened. If we look at the Statcast 3D version, look at Contreras dancing behind Burnes. Look how far he gets without Burnes even looking -- and then stops, because you assume the pitcher must have noticed -- before taking off when he realized he was in the clear. It’s because of that knowledge -- that you can get big leads here -- that runners were simply more aggressive on Burnes compared to most pitchers. While it may not seem like a lot that potential base stealers made an attempt on 6% of the pitches they had an opportunity to do so, it was actually third-highest in baseball behind Nick Nastrini and Adam Ottavino, long known for his weakness here. Why did he get worse?It wasn’t always like this for Burnes. This is the key for any team looking to sign Burnes for next year, because he wasn’t that bad at this with Milwaukee. He was, at times, even good. In all of 2022 -- again, under the old rules -- he allowed only five stolen bases, and it wasn’t because Brewer catchers Omar Narváez and Victor Caratini were elite throwers; they rated as average, similar to Burnes’s 2024 Orioles backstops. It’s partially because runners were far more willing to test him; note that the attempt rate nearly tripled from 2023. It’s also because he was allowing more distance during his motion, an entire foot more than he was giving up in his last year with Milwaukee, and in a sport where inches means everything, that could be the difference. Of course, this might not matter as much as it seems, anyway; it's not like Burnes wasn't successful, and -21 bases prevented comes out to all of three runs of value lost, which is minimal. The question, then, remains open: Did the Orioles instruct him not to even worry about it, and focus on the batter at the plate? Or did Burnes suddenly get worse at a skill he seemed to possess previously? Whether this keeps up in 2025 will go a long way towards providing an answer.",

                "content": "The Bidwell Mansion in northern California was seen engulfed with flames early Wednesday morning, leaving the iconic 19th-century home in an unstable condition. Deputy Fire Chief Chris Zinko told Newsweek his department was deployed to the mansion around 3 a.m. following calls about an illegal burn. When his first units were sent out, they recognized it was instead a structural fire. The cause is still under investigation but Zinko said there is video of someone leaving the mansion area at that time. \"We are tracking down all leads,\" Zinko said. \"It's still under investigation.\" Bidwell Mansion is part of a state historical park. The three-story Victorian home housed 26 rooms and was constructed by California pioneer John Bidwell in 1868. It was a $60,000 project and featured at the time modern plumbing, gas lighting and water systems. Famous guests at the mansion included former President Rutherford B. Hayes, women's rights activist Susan B. Anthony and Civil War General William Sherman. Some of the interior scenes from the 1934 murder-mystery movie \"The Thin Man\" were shot at the Bidwell Mansion. Due to a risk of structural collapse, fire crews took on a defensive operation and did not immediately enter the building, local media reported. \"There's so much smoke and fire that we cannot see the inside,\" Zinko told Newsweek. \"A good portion of the ceiling and the floors have burned. It's not a stable structure at the moment.\" Local news outlet KRCR posted a video of the fire burning to X, formerly known as Twitter. UPDATE: According to officials the historic Bidwell mansion is set to collapse any time this morning because of the fire. The cause still unknown, officials said their is no spread to vegetation and no injuries have been reported. https://t.co/4BzQy5b8An pic.twitter.com/wrVqXDgMAo The mansion underwent construction earlier in the year. It was closed to visitors for exterior renovations. The work was expected to be done by the end of the year, according to the California State Parks. In a post on social media, California State University, Chico said that the fire at the mansion posed no danger to its campus. \"Chico State is saddened by the news that Bidwell Mansion, the historic building adjacent to our campus, was destroyed in an overnight fire,\" the university posted to Facebook. \"There is no ongoing danger to campus. The University will remain open today and most classes and activities will continue as scheduled.\" The Bidwell Mansion was a dormitory for Chico State Teachers College students from 1925 to 1935. It was later called the \"Bidwell Hall\" and housed the art and home economics departments. The University did note that the Gateway Science Museum, Modoc Hall and Aymer J. Hamilton (AJH) and the Child Development Lab will be closed on Wednesday. \"Beyond serving as a beautiful landmark and gateway to the northeastern side of campus, Bidwell Mansion played a key role in the University's history,\" the university wrote. \"Its loss is deeply felt by all of us, and we join the Chico community in mourning the loss of this historic home.\" Monica is a Newsweek reporter based in Boston.

                "content": "This is an accepted version of this page Christopher Asher Wray (born December 17, 1966)[2] is an American attorney who is the eighth and current director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI). He was nominated by President Donald Trump to replace James Comey. He was confirmed by the U.S. Senate on July 30. Wray took office on August 2, 2017 to serve a 10-year term. He has indicated that he intends to resign before the change of administrations although it is prior to his term of office.[3][4] Born in New York City, Wray graduated from Yale University in 1989, then attended Yale Law School. He joined government in 1997 as an Assistant United States Attorney for the Northern District of Georgia. From 2003 to 2005, Wray served as Assistant Attorney General in charge of the Criminal Division in George W. Bush's administration. He later was a litigation partner with the multinational law firm King & Spalding from 2005 to 2016. Wray is a registered Republican.[5] On November 30, 2024, President-elect Donald Trump nominated Kash Patel to replace Wray.[6] Federal law (Public Law 94-503, section 203(b))[7] stipulates that the director of the FBI serves a ten-year term and Wray had three more years in his term. On December 11, Wray announced that he would resign from his position as Director of the FBI in January 2025, coinciding with the conclusion of the Biden administration.[8][9] Christopher Asher Wray was born in New York City.[10] His father, Cecil A. Wray Jr.,[11][12] was a graduate of Vanderbilt University and Yale Law School who worked as a lawyer at Debevoise & Plimpton in New York City.[13][14] His paternal grandfather, T. Cecil Wray, was the city manager of Brentwood, Tennessee from 1971 to 1973.[15] His paternal great-grandfather, Taylor Malone, was also a Vanderbilt graduate,[16] and the co-founder and president of Malone & Hyde, \"one of the South's largest wholesale grocery firms.\"[17] His maternal grandfather, Samuel E. Gates, \"helped shape the laws that govern national and international airline flights\" as an official of the Bureau of Air Commerce.[18] Wray attended the private Buckley School[19] in New York City and the private boarding school Phillips Academy in Andover, Massachusetts.[11] After graduating, Wray attended Yale University where he majored in philosophy and graduated cum laude[11] in 1989 with a Bachelor of Arts degree. He then attended Yale Law School, where he was the executive editor of the Yale Law Journal and graduated in 1992 with a Juris Doctor.[20] After graduating from law school, Wray was a law clerk to Judge J. Michael Luttig of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit from 1992 to 1993. He then entered private practice at the law firm King & Spalding. Wray joined the government in 1997 as an Assistant United States Attorney for the Northern District of Georgia. In 2001, he moved to the Justice Department as associate deputy attorney general and principal associate deputy attorney general.[20] On June 9, 2003, President George W. Bush nominated Wray to be the 33rd Assistant Attorney General in charge of the Criminal Division of the Justice Department. Wray was unanimously confirmed by the Senate on September 11, 2003.[21][22][23] Wray was Assistant Attorney General from 2003 to 2005, working under Deputy Attorney General James Comey. While heading the Criminal Division, Wray oversaw prominent fraud investigations, including Enron.[20][24] In early 2004, the Justice Department issued a finding that the Bush administration's warrantless domestic surveillance program under the Terrorist Surveillance Program (TSP) was unconstitutional.[25][26] Under White House procedures, DoJ approval was required in order for the program to be renewed.[25] In 2006, it was revealed DoJ officials came under pressure from the White House to change this ruling, and that then-FBI Director Robert Mueller and Comey had prepared their resignations if the White House overruled it.[25][27] In 2013, it was revealed that Wray threatened to resign along with them over the matter.[28] In March 2005, Wray announced that he would resign from his post.[29][22] In 2005, Wray received the Edmund J. Randolph Award, the Justice Department's highest award for public service and leadership.[30] In 2005, Wray returned to King & Spalding as a litigation partner in the firm's Washington, D.C., and Atlanta offices. Wray represented several Fortune 100 companies and chaired the King & Spalding Special Matters and Government Investigations Practice Group.[31] During his time at King & Spalding, Wray acted as New Jersey Governor Chris Christie's personal attorney during the Bridgegate scandal.[32][33] Wray's firm also represents Russian energy giants Gazprom and Rosneft, an issue which came under contention during the confirmation process for position of FBI Director.[34] Following the dismissal of FBI Director James Comey on May 9, 2017, New Jersey Governor Chris Christie presented to President Donald Trump the possibility of hiring Wray as Comey's replacement.[35] According to then Press Secretary Sean Spicer, Trump interviewed Wray for the vacant FBI Director job on May 30.[20] Eight days later, Trump announced his intention to nominate Wray to be the next FBI Director.[36] Wray's Senate confirmation hearing commenced on July 12, 2017.[37] Among other testimony, when asked if he believed that the investigation into Russian 2016 election interference and possible links to Trump's campaign is a \"witch hunt\", he stated that he did not.[37] On July 20, the Senate Judiciary Committee unanimously recommended to confirm Wray as the next Director of the FBI.[38] Wray was officially confirmed by the Senate with bipartisan support on August 1, 2017; the vote was 92–5.[39][40] According to law passed by Congress in 1976 (Federal law (Public Law 94-503, section 203(b)), the director of the FBI serves a ten-year term.[7] Wray was sworn in by Attorney General Jeff Sessions in a private ceremony on August 2, 2017.[41] Wray was formally sworn in on September 28, 2017, in a ceremony that was not attended by President Trump, marking the first time an FBI director had been sworn in without the president who nominated him present at the ceremony.[42] In January 2020, Senator Chris Murphy wrote to Wray, urging the FBI to \"investigate the allegations\" that Saudi Arabia \"illegally compromised and stole personal data\" from Jeff Bezos, the owner of The Washington Post, as part of a possible effort to \"influence, if not silence, the Washington Post's reporting on Saudi Arabia\".[43][44] On June 4, 2020, Wray stated that \"anarchists\" like antifa are \"exploiting\" George Floyd protests \"to pursue violent, extremist agendas\".[45][46] Wray later clarified that antifa is an ideology rather than a specific organization, clashing with Trump.[47] In April 2020, Trump considered ousting Wray and replacing him with William Evanina but when Attorney General William Barr threatened to resign, Trump backed down.[48] In May 2020, Wray ordered an internal review into possible misconduct in the FBI's investigation of Trump's former national security adviser Michael Flynn.[49][50] On October 28, the FBI Agents Association released a letter addressed to both Trump and Joe Biden requesting Wray remain Director of the FBI for the 10-year term.[51] On December 2, a member of then-president-elect Biden's transition team announced that if Wray was not fired or removed from his position by Trump, then he would remain Director of the FBI.[52] On March 2, 2021, Wray testified in Senate hearings about the extremism that led to the 2021 storming of the United States Capitol in which he condemned the attack on the U.S. Capitol and argued that it was a case of domestic terrorism.[53] In July 2023, Wray was questioned by House Republicans regarding allegations of political bias and civil liberties violations. The Republicans criticized the FBI's interference in the Hunter Biden investigation and broader abuses of power. However, he defended the FBI's actions to apprehend violent criminals and seize drugs.[54] After the 2024 presidential election, president-elect Donald Trump indicated that he would fire Wray and seek to replace him with former prosecutor Kash Patel. At that time, Wray had three years left in his 10-year term. On December 11, 2024, Wray announced that he would resign at the conclusion of the Biden presidency, January 20, 2025.[55][56] The Vacancies Reform Act[57] says that if there is a vacancy in the director of the FBI (or any other Senate-confirmed position), the president must replace the person with a person who has (1) already been confirmed by the Senate or (2) a person who has served in the agency at a senior level (according to the GS-15 pay scale).[58] Kash Patel, Donald Trump’s proposed successor does not meet either criteria. Commentators have speculated as to whether the Vacancies Reform Act motivated Wray to resign as Paul Abbate (deputy director of the F.B.I. since 2021) or some other person qualified under the Vacancies Reform Act would have to fill the position prior to a Senate confirmation of Patel.[59] On December 9, 2019, Wray was interviewed by ABC News following the release of the DoJ inspector general's report on the origins of the Russia investigation.[60] In the interview, when asked about characterizations of the FBI and its agents as the \"deep state\", Wray responded, \"I think that's the kind of label that's a disservice to the men and women who work at the FBI who I think tackle their jobs with professionalism, with rigor, with objectivity, with courage. So that's not a term I would ever use to describe our work force and I think it's an affront to them.\"[60] He said he did not believe the Trump campaign was unfairly targeted by the FBI probe. He also denied that Ukraine interfered in the 2016 presidential elections, stating \"We have no information that indicates that Ukraine interfered with the 2016 presidential election\" and \"as far as the [2020] election itself goes, we think Russia represents the most significant threat\".[60] This led Trump to criticize Wray the following day, claiming that Wray would \"never be able to fix the FBI.\"[61] On February 13, 2018, in a Senate Select Committee on Intelligence hearing focused on Chinese espionage in the United States, Senator Marco Rubio asked Wray about the risk posed from Chinese students in advanced science and mathematics programs. In response, Wray stated \"nontraditional collectors\" (which he elaborated to include professors, scientists, and students) are \"exploiting the very open research and development environment that we have\" and consequently he viewed the risk \"as not just a whole of government threat but a whole of society threat.\"[62] Representatives Judy Chu, Ted Lieu, and Grace Meng released statements criticizing Wray's response as \"irresponsible generalizations\" implying that all Chinese students and scholars were spies.[63] A coalition of Asian American advocacy groups wrote an open letter to Wray asking for a dialogue \"to discuss how well-intentioned public policies might nonetheless lead to troubling issues of potential bias, racial profiling, and wrongful prosecution\".[64] In a follow-up interview with NBC, Wray stood by his earlier remarks: \"To be clear, we do not open investigations based on race, or ethnicity, or national origin. But when we open investigations into economic espionage, time and time again, they keep leading back to China.\"[65] In July 2020, Wray called People's Republic of China the \"greatest long-term threat\" to the United States. He said that \"the FBI is now opening a new China-related counterintelligence case every 10 hours. Of the nearly 5,000 active counterintelligence cases currently under way across the country, almost half are related to China.\"[66] Wray cited the Anthem medical data breach that exposed the personal information of more than 78 million people and the 2017 Equifax data breach that impacted more than 145 million Americans.[67] Wray argued China was trying to become the world's only superpower, supplanting the United States.[68] In February 2023, Wray appeared in an interview on Fox News endorsing the theory that the COVID-19 virus may have leaked from a laboratory in China. The endorsement comes after the United States Department of Energy and the FBI both released statements saying that it was likely that the virus had come after a lab leak in China. The assessments were made with \"low confidence\" and \"moderate confidence\", respectively.[69] Wray married Helen Garrison Howell, a Yale undergraduate classmate, in 1989.[11][70] They have a son, Trip, and a daughter, Caroline,[13] and live in Georgia.[20][71] From January 2016 to July 2017, the month of his confirmation, Wray earned $9.2 million working as an attorney for the law firm King & Spalding, significantly more than his salary as FBI Director. According to a calculation from The Wall Street Journal, Wray's net worth in 2017 was estimated to be $23 million to $42 million.[72] Wray is a Republican and a member of the Federalist Society.[5]",

                "title": "FBI Director Christopher Wray says he'll resign as Donald Trump takes office",
                "content": "Profile Sections Local tv Featured More From NBC Follow NBC News news Alerts There are no new alerts at this time WASHINGTON — FBI Director Christopher Wray plans to resign at the end of the Biden administration, as President-elect Donald Trump takes office, Wray told bureau employees on Wednesday. “After weeks of careful thought, I’ve decided the right thing for the Bureau is for me to serve until the end of the current Administration in January and then step down,\" Wray said, according to prepared remarks. \"My goal is to keep the focus on our mission — the indispensable work you’re doing on behalf of the American people every day. In my view, this is the best way to avoid dragging the Bureau deeper into the fray, while reinforcing the values and principles that are so important to how we do our work.” Trump has already said he will nominate Kash Patel for the position of FBI director, which typically is for a 10-year term, part of a post-Watergate reform intended to make FBI directors less beholden to the whims of presidents. A senior FBI official told NBC News that the current plan is for Christopher Wray to stay on as FBI director until Jan. 20, when the new administration takes over. After that, current FBI Deputy Director Paul Abbate will be named acting director and will stay on until a new FBI director is confirmed. Trump indicated in a recent interview with NBC News' \"Meet the Press\" that he wasn't \"thrilled\" with Wray, saying that Wray \"invaded Mar-a-Lago\" — a reference to the 2022 FBI search for classified documents that led to Trump's 2023 indictment on seven criminal charges — and that he wanted someone in place to \"straighten\" out the bureau. \"I mean, it would sort of seem pretty obvious that if Kash gets in, he’s going to be taking somebody’s place, right?\" Trump said, responding to a question about whether he would fire Wray if he didn't resign on his own. Wray, a Republican, was appointed by Trump in 2017 after the then-president fired James Comey as FBI director. Comey's departure sparked the appointment of Robert Mueller as special counsel to investigate the Trump campaign and Russian interference in the 2016 election. Under normal protocol, Wray's term would expire in 2027, although Mueller is the only person to have served a full term as FBI director since the 10-year post-Watergate norm was put in place. Only two FBI directors (including Comey) have been pushed out. Republican confidence in the FBI has plummeted in the near-decade since Trump came down the golden escalator in 2015 and announced his run for president of the United States. While the bureau has traditionally been a generally conservative-leaning organization filled with law enforcement and military veterans (who have an advantage in the FBI hiring process), Trump and his allies on Capitol Hill and in the conservative media have portrayed the FBI as a hotbed of liberalism and the home of the \"deep state\" determined to take him down. While most of the FBI's work takes place far afield of daily politics, much of the public discussion of the bureau's work in recent years has centered on political cases, many of them involving Trump. Trump wrote on his social media website that Wray’s departure would be “a great day for America as it will end the Weaponization of what has become known as the United States Department of Injustice.” “I just don’t know what happened to him,” Trump wrote about the man he chose to become FBI director after he fired Comey. “We will now restore the Rule of Law for all Americans. Under the leadership of Christopher Wray, the FBI illegally raided my home, without cause, worked diligently on illegally impeaching and indicting me, and has done everything else to interfere with the success and future of America.” Wray said Wednesday that it was not an easy decision to resign. \"I love this place, I love our mission, and I love our people — but my focus is, and always has been, on us and doing what’s right for the FBI,\" he said. “When you look at where the threats are headed, it’s clear that the importance of our work — keeping Americans safe and upholding the Constitution — will not change. And what absolutely cannot, must not change is our commitment to doing the right thing, the right way, every time. \"Our adherence to our core values, our dedication to independence and objectivity, and our defense of the rule of law — those fundamental aspects of who we are must never change,\" Wray continued. \"That’s the real strength of the FBI — the importance of our mission, the quality of our people, and their dedication to service over self. It’s an unshakeable foundation that’s stood the test of time, and cannot be easily moved. And it — you, the men and women of the FBI — are why the Bureau will endure and remain successful long into the future.” Attorney General Merrick Garland said Wray had \"served our country honorably and with integrity for decades, including for seven years as the Director of the FBI under presidents of both parties.\" The FBI director is \"responsible for protecting the independence of the FBI from inappropriate influence in its criminal investigations,\" Garland continued, saying it is \"central to preserving the rule of law and to protecting the freedoms we as Americans hold dear\" for the FBI to maintain its independence. Natalie Bara, the president of the FBI Agents Association (FBIAA), thanked Wray in a statement for his leadership \"through challenging times with a steady focus on doing the work that keeps our country safe.\" FBI special agents, Bara said, \"will always be focused on our vital mission — protecting this great nation, safeguarding communities and upholding the U.S. Constitution. This commitment is at the core of who we are as Special Agents, and it does not waver when there are changes in a presidential administration or when the leadership in the Bureau changes.\" Bara said the FBIAA \"welcomes the opportunity to meet with President-elect Trump’s team to discuss the perspectives and priorities of rank-and-file FBI Special Agents.\" Senate Majority Whip Dick Durbin, D-Ill., thanked Wray \"for his service to our nation, and all the men and women of the FBI for their continued efforts to protect our security and liberty,\" warning that the bureau would \"soon embark on a perilous new era with serious questions about its future.\" Sen. Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, who wrote a letter this week urging Wray to \"move on\" from his job, said Wray's \"departure is an opportunity for a new era of transparency and accountability at the FBI.\" A source familiar with the Trump transition team’s thinking said the team \"is confident in Kash Patel and confident he will be ready to serve the American people on Day One.\" Patel, who was meeting with senators on Capitol Hill on Wednesday ahead of an expected confirmation vote next year, said he looks forward \"to a very smooth transition,\" adding: \"I’ll be ready to go on day one. The Senators have been wonderful, and I look to earning their trust and confidence in the advice and consent process and restoring law and order and integrity at the FBI.\" Trump said on Truth Social that he has \"great respect for the rank-and-file of the FBI, and they have great respect for me. They want to see these changes every bit as much as I do but, more importantly, the American People are demanding a strong, but fair, System of Justice. We want our FBI back, and that will now happen. I look forward to Kash Patel’s confirmation, so that the process of Making the FBI Great Again can begin.\" Ryan J.

Archived News Para Notícias en Español The Justice Department issued the following statement from Attorney General Merrick B. Garland following FBI Director Christopher Wray’s resignation announcement: “Chris Wray has served our country honorably and with integrity for decades, including for seven years as the Director of the FBI under presidents of both parties. In a heightened threat environment, Director Wray has worked tirelessly to protect the American people and to lead an agency of 38,000 dedicated public servants, many of whom put their lives on the line every day to serve their communities. Under Director Wray’s principled leadership, the FBI has worked to fulfill the Justice Department’s mission to keep our country safe, protect civil rights, and uphold the rule of law. He has led the FBI’s efforts to aggressively confront the broad range of threats facing our country — from nation-state adversaries and foreign and domestic terrorism to violent crime, cybercrime, and financial crime. There are few leadership positions more central to keeping the American people safe than the Director of the FBI. The Director of the FBI is responsible for leading employees located across the country and around the world who dedicate themselves each day to disrupting complex plots and preventing horrific tragedies before they can occur. The Director of the FBI is responsible for leading the federal law enforcement agency that serves as the connective tissue among the intelligence community, state and local law enforcement agencies across the country, and our international law enforcement partners.

That independence is central to preserving the rule of law and to protecting the freedoms we as Americans hold dear. Director Wray has done that job with integrity and skill.

                "title": "FBI Director Chris Wray announces plans to resign | CNN Politics",
                "content": "Follow: FBI Director Chris Wray will resign at the end of the Biden administration, the agency said Wednesday, as it became clear he would be forced out by President-elect Donald Trump. Trump, who originally nominated Wray after firing the previous FBI director, previously announced he will nominate Kash Patel for the role, although Wray still had three years remaining on his 10-year term. Patel has been meeting with senators to build support for a confirmation vote next year. Wray had wrestled with whether or not to resign given Trump’s stated desire to replace him, sources say, and wants to facilitate an orderly transition. But some in the FBI worried his departure would normalize Trump’s penchant for replacing FBI directors he doesn’t like, as the position is supposed to straddle administrations and be insulated from politics. Wray took the helm of the agency after Trump fired Director James Comey following investigations under his watch into Russian meddling in the 2016 election. Wray took office after Comey, whose FBI also investigated Hillary Clinton’s use of a private email server, left the bureau in May 2017. As the incoming director, Wray was seen by many lawmakers as a solid choice to stabilize a rocky ship, but he ultimately suffered a similar fate as his predecessor, after he too oversaw an FBI that investigated Trump, probes resulting in two separate federal cases against the former president. Trump, in particular, was unhappy with the FBI’s court-approved search of his Mar-a-Lago resort in August 2022 during the investigation into his alleged mishandling of classified documents. Just this week, Trump said on NBC’s “Meet the Press,” that he wasn’t “thrilled” with Wray. “He invaded my home,” Trump said. “He invaded Mar-a-Lago.” Wray made his announcement at a town hall in FBI headquarters in Washington, DC. Following his remarks there was a standing ovation and some people were seen crying, according to sources who attended the event. “After weeks of careful thought, I’ve decided the right thing for the Bureau is for me to serve until the end of the current Administration in January and then step down. My goal is to keep the focus on our mission — the indispensable work you’re doing on behalf of the American people every day,” Wray said, according to prepared remarks from the FBI. “In my view, this is the best way to avoid dragging the Bureau deeper into the fray, while reinforcing the values and principles that are so important to how we do our work.” “It should go without saying, but I’ll say it anyway — this is not easy for me. I love this place, I love our mission, and I love our people — but my focus is, and always has been, on us and doing what’s right for the FBI,” Wray added. In a Truth Social post, Trump said Wray’s resignation “is a great day for America as it will end the Weaponization of what has become known as the United States Department of Injustice. I just don’t know what happened to him. We will now restore the Rule of Law for all Americans.” “I look forward to a smooth transition. I will be ready to serve the American people on day one,” Patel said in a statement Wednesday. Sen. Josh Hawley, who sits on the Judiciary Committee, called Wray’s resignation announcement “a great development.” “I mean, he’s the worst FBI director in American history, he should go,” said Hawley, a Missouri Republican, arguing that Wray had “violated the constitution” during his tenure. “This should not be partisan by the way. He’s a Republican, but he’s just been a bad director.” Speaking on CNN, Massachusetts Rep. Seth Moulton lamented Trump’s move to push Wray out. “Trump wants to politicize the FBI, to turn it back to the days of J. Edgar Hoover, where the FBI has its own really lawless agenda, where the FBI is a tool of the state to persecute Americans, not to actually uphold the law for everybody in our land,” Moulton, a Democrat, said. “So, it is very dangerous. And the calculation that Chris Wray made when he decided to to resign is a calculation that hundreds of thousands of federal employees are making right now, all across Washington and all across the country.” When Trump first chose Wray to lead the FBI in 2017, the two were on good terms. At the time, Trump said Wray would “serve his country as a fierce guardian of the law and model of integrity.” Wray did seek to avoid turbulence with the White House and other lawmakers, giving detailed briefings on Capitol Hill and making reforms to the bureau in response to missteps in the Trump-Russia probe. Still, the relationship quickly soured, and Trump’s disdain for Wray came out in public tweets and interviews where he bashed the FBI director for his hesitancy to make public documents related to the Russia investigation as well as his congressional testimony that Russia was working to interfere in the 2020 elections and that there was no evidence of coordinated national voter fraud. Related article Trump’s DOJ secretly obtained records of his FBI pick Kash Patel, lawmakers, staffers and media in leak investigations The rift became even more apparent after Trump left the White House in 2021 and began to attack both Wray and the bureau as carrying out investigations for political reasons. Following his election victory last month, Trump promised to get rid of Wray and replace him with Patel, a Trump loyalist and MAGA firebrand who has vowed to root out what he has referred to as the “Deep State” and re-focus the law enforcement agency’s mission. Wray’s FBI also conducted the largest investigation in its long history in response to the January 6, 2021, US Capitol attack – leading to the arrest of over 1,500 people accused of breaking the law that day. In recent weeks, Wray had weighed whether to resign or wait to be fired, people briefed on the discussions said. An important part of his consideration was finding a way to say good bye to employees and to manage his own exit, the sources said. The timing of his announcement was the only question. Then in recent days, Republicans began publicly paving the way to push Wray out, making clear it wasn’t just Trump but also influential Republicans on board with ousting him. Sen. Chuck Grassley, incoming chairman of the Judiciary Committee, sent a letter saying he lacked confidence in the leadership of Wray and Deputy FBI Director Paul Abbate. Internally at the FBI, Grassley’s letter was seen as a sign that Republicans were going to attack the bureau as a way to force Wray out, sources said. In addition, resigning and having a deputy serve until a new director is in place allows for continuity and avoids risk of Wray being fired on January 20, 2025, a particular vulnerable point for the government as a new administration is taking over. A source familiar with Wray’s thinking told CNN that leaving the agency on his own terms was an important factor in his announcement Wednesday. Wray was described as sad about his premature exit but was said to be approaching it with an attitude of resolve. Attorney General Merrick Garland praised Wray’s leadership and “integrity” during his law enforcement career. “The director of the FBI is responsible for protecting the independence of the FBI from inappropriate influence in its criminal investigations. That independence is central to preserving the rule of law and to protecting the freedoms we as Americans hold dear,” Garland said in a statement. “Director Wray has done that job with integrity and skill.” During his address Wednesday, Wray insisted that the FBI cannot change it’s “commitment to doing the right thing, the right way, every time.” “That’s the real strength of the FBI — the importance of our mission, the quality of our people, and their dedication to service over self. It’s an unshakeable foundation that’s stood the test of time,” Wray said, “and cannot be easily moved. And it — you, the men and women of the FBI — are why the bureau will endure and remain successful long into the future.” This story has been updated with additional developments.

                "content": "Andrés Alfonso Giménez Osorio (born September 4, 1998) is a Venezuelan professional baseball second baseman for the Toronto Blue Jays of Major League Baseball (MLB). He has previously played in MLB for the New York Mets and Cleveland Guardians. He made his MLB debut with the Mets in 2020. Giménez signed with the New York Mets of Major League Baseball (MLB) as an international free agent in July 2015.[1] He made his professional debut in 2016 with the Dominican Summer League Mets and spent the whole season there, batting a combined .350 with three home runs, 38 runs batted in (RBIs), and a .992 on-base plus slugging (OPS). In 2017, he played for the Columbia Fireflies where he slashed .265/.346/.349 with four home runs and 31 RBIs in 92 games.[2][3] After the 2017 season, Baseball America rated Giménez as the Mets' best prospect.[4] He spent the 2018 season with both the St. Lucie Mets and the Binghamton Rumble Ponies, batting .281/.347/.409 with six home runs, 46 RBIs, and 38 stolen bases in 122 total games between the two clubs.[5] That summer, he played in the 2018 All-Star Futures Game.[6] He returned to Binghamton for the 2019 season,[7] hitting .250/.309/.387 with nine home runs, 37 RBIs, and 28 stolen bases over 117 games. The Mets added Giménez to their 40-man roster following the 2019 season.[8] Giménez made the Mets' Opening Day roster in 2020,[9] and made his Major League debut on July 24, 2020, at Citi Field as an eighth inning defensive replacement for Robinson Canó at second base.[10] On July 29, Giménez made his first start, and recorded his first career hit off of Boston Red Sox pitcher Nathan Eovaldi, a single, in the second inning. In the sixth inning of the same game, Giménez tripled off Marcus Walden to record his first career RBI.[11] Giménez received a single vote in National League Rookie of the Year voting, tying him for seventh place with Ian Anderson and Sixto Sánchez.[12] According to Statcast, his sprint speed was tied for fourth-fastest among Major League shortstops on the season.[13] On January 7, 2021, the Mets traded Giménez, Amed Rosario, Josh Wolf, and Isaiah Greene to the Cleveland Indians for Francisco Lindor and Carlos Carrasco.[14][15] Giménez was the team's Opening Day starter at shortstop.[16] Giménez struggled at the start of the season and was demoted to Triple-A on May 18.[17] In 2022 with the renamed Guardians, Giménez experienced a breakout season, batting .297 with 17 home runs and 69 RBI. He was elected to the All Star Game at 2nd base and started as a replacement for the injured Jose Altuve. His reputation as a clutch hitter developed in 2022, as he had a 281 WRC+ in high leverage situations, meaning he nearly tripled the average hitter's production in that position.[18] Giménez won a Gold Glove Award for his performance at second base.[19] He was also selected for the second team on the 2022 All-MLB Team.[20] Prior to the 2023 season, Giménez represented the Venezuelan national baseball team in the 2023 World Baseball Classic.[21] On March 30, Giménez signed a seven-year major league contract with the Guardians worth $106.5 million. The deal includes a club option for the 2030 season.[22] On April 12, 2023, a relay throw to home plate by Giménez struck the head of umpire Larry Vanover, who was hospitalized with non-life threatening injuries.[23] In 2023 he batted .251/.314/.399, had the lowest average exit velocity of all AL batters (84.8 mph), and led the AL in percentage of balls that were softly hit (21.7%).[24][25] On December 10, 2024, Giménez, alongside Nick Sandlin, was traded to the Toronto Blue Jays in exchange for Spencer Horwitz and Nick Mitchell.[26]",

                "content": "Keegan Matheson DALLAS -- The Blue Jays have made their first big splash of the offseason, agreeing to a trade with the Guardians for Andrés Giménez, one of the best defensive infielders in baseball, the team announced on Tuesday. Still just 26, Giménez is only two seasons into a seven-year, $106.5 million extension, meaning he has five years of club control remaining along with a team option for 2030. The Blue Jays, who also acquired right-handed reliever Nick Sandlin in the deal, sent first baseman Spencer Horwitz and Minor League outfielder Nick Mitchell to the Guardians. “Everything about him was attractive,” general manager Ross Atkins said of Giménez on Tuesday. “The work that we did on his bat and the offensive upside that can be there, the teammate -- you know I talk about being a teammate all the time -- we just heard incredible things about the person. As a baserunner, adding that level of speed and that level of athleticism, plus him being here for a long time, all of that was very attractive to us.” TRADE DETAILS:Blue Jays receive: 2B Andrés Giménez, RHP Nick SandlinGuardians receive: 1B Spencer Horwitz, OF Nick Mitchell While Giménez’s offensive profile has changed over the past few seasons, he’s already established himself as one of the premiere defenders in baseball, which fits how the Blue Jays have built this roster. Giménez has primarily played second base for the Guardians, where he’s won Gold Glove Awards in three consecutive seasons. In 2024, Giménez was tied for 7th among all players with a Fielding Run Value of +14. It’s his bat, however, that determines the line between him being a very good player and a star in this league. There are some similarities here to Daulton Varsho, an elite outfield defender by every metric who has worked to do more with the bat. “The elite defense speaks for itself and we have acquired him to play second base for us,” Atkins said, but it’s clear that Giménez could be an excellent option to slide across to shortstop in 2026 and beyond if Bo Bichette departs via free agency. Giménez broke out in 2022, batting .297 with an .837 OPS on top of his defense, all of which came together to produce a player worth 6.1 WAR (FanGraphs). That made Giménez the 12th-most valuable hitter in baseball that season, but his OPS has dropped to .712 and .638 in the two seasons since. He can make an impact with his glove alone at second base, proving to be solid on routine plays and capable of the spectacular, but Giménez will immediately be one of the most important projects for new hitting coach David Popkins and his staff. Sign up to receive our daily Morning Lineup to stay in the know about the latest trending topics around Major League Baseball. “We’ve seen Andrés be a really effective and capable Major League hitter,” said Guardians president of baseball operations Chris Antonetti earlier Tuesday, prior to the deal. “Obviously the last year, the last couple years haven’t been as consistent as we wanted. So he’s another guy that we spent a lot of time with, our coaching staff’s spent time with during the season and even in the offseason, trying to help him find a little bit more consistency and establish what his best movements look like in the box, having an understanding of his identity as a hitter, what he needs to do to be successful.” The Blue Jays are also excited about the acquisition of Sandlin, who is an uncomfortable look for hitters from the right side and coming off a 3.75 ERA with 68 strikeouts in 57 2/3 innings last season for the Guardians. Given the blatant need in Toronto’s bullpen, even after the club agreed to a two-year, $15 million reunion with Yimi García on Tuesday, Sandlin should be looking at a major opportunity to pitch meaningful innings. The inclusion of Horwitz in the deal could change the way the Blue Jays look at the rest of their offseason, too, given that he was in line to take the majority of the club’s DH at-bats. Will Wagner and potentially even top hitting prospect Orelvis Martinez were projected to see time at second base in 2025, each bringing some offensive upside, but now that the club has steered heavily in the direction of defense at that spot, the now-vacant DH position feels like the perfect opportunity to balance out the move.",

                "content": "Manage your account Curious about Andres Gimenez and his latest move? The three-time Gold Glove winner and elite second baseman has made headlines with a trade that reshapes two MLB franchises. From his defensive brilliance with the Cleveland Guardians to his new chapter with the Toronto Blue Jays, Giménez’s journey highlights his impact on the game. Here’s everything you need to know about the trade, its implications for both teams, and what’s next for Andres Gimenez. The Cleveland Guardians traded three-time Gold Glove second baseman Andres Gimenez and reliever Nick Sandlin to the Toronto Blue Jays. In return, the Guardians acquired infielder Spencer Horwitz and minor league outfielder Nick Mitchell. This trade marks a significant move during the 2024 Winter Meetings. Cleveland is restructuring its roster while Toronto gains an elite defensive infielder. Shortly after acquiring Horwitz, Cleveland sent him to the Pittsburgh Pirates for three pitchers: Luis Ortiz, Michael Kennedy, and Josh Hartle. Ortiz, a right-hander, posted a 3.32 ERA in 135⅔ innings during the 2024 season. These trades could open opportunities for younger infield prospects. Players like Travis Bazzana or Juan Brito may step into key roles in Cleveland’s lineup. This move reflects the organization’s focus on long-term roster management. Gimenez, 26, has been a cornerstone for Cleveland since arriving from the New York Mets in 2021. Known for his defensive prowess, he led AL second basemen in defensive runs saved in 2024. However, his offensive numbers dipped in recent seasons, batting .252 with nine home runs and a .340 slugging percentage in 2024. The Blue Jays see Giménez as a key addition to their lineup, providing elite defense and speed on the basepaths. Nick Sandlin, another part of the deal, has been a reliable bullpen arm for Cleveland. He posted a 3.75 ERA in 68 appearances during the 2024 season. Toronto gains a consistent and versatile reliever in Sandlin. Conversely, Cleveland focuses on the future by acquiring Horwitz and Mitchell, both cost-effective additions with long-term potential. This trade signals a strategic shift for both teams. The Blue Jays address immediate needs to stay competitive in the AL East. Meanwhile, the Guardians aim to develop prospects and manage their payroll. The impact of this deal will unfold during the 2025 season and beyond.

                "content": "Text of this article December 11, 2024 PRESS RELEASE Apple Intelligence now features Image Playground, Genmoji, Writing Tools enhancements, seamless support for ChatGPT, and visual intelligence Today also marks the beginning of Apple Intelligence language expansion with localized English support for Australia, Canada, Ireland, New Zealand, South Africa, and the U.K. CUPERTINO, CALIFORNIA Apple today announced the release of iOS 18.2, iPadOS 18.2, and macOS Sequoia 15.2, introducing a brand-new set of Apple Intelligence features that will elevate users’ experience with iPhone, iPad, and Mac, and builds on the first set of capabilities already introduced. Apple Intelligence is the easy-to-use personal intelligence system that delivers helpful and relevant intelligence while taking an extraordinary step forward for privacy in AI. Now users can explore creative new ways to express themselves visually with Image Playground, create the perfect emoji for any situation with Genmoji, and make their writing even more dynamic with new enhancements to Writing Tools. Building on Apple Intelligence, users with an iPhone 16 or iPhone 16 Pro can instantly learn more about their surroundings with visual intelligence with Camera Control. And now with ChatGPT integrated into Writing Tools and Siri, users can tap into ChatGPT’s expertise without having to switch between apps, helping them get things done faster and easier than ever before. Today, Apple Intelligence also begins language expansion with localized English support for Australia, Canada, Ireland, New Zealand, South Africa, and the U.K., giving even more users around the world powerful new ways to use their iPhone, iPad, and Mac. Additional languages, including Chinese, English (India), English (Singapore), French, German, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Portuguese, Spanish, and Vietnamese will be coming throughout the year, with an initial set arriving in a software update in April. Design Fun, Original Images with Image Playground The Image Playground experience allows users to easily create fun and unique images, with concepts like themes, costumes, accessories, and places. Users can add their own text descriptions, and can even create images in the likeness of a family member or friend using photos from their photo library. Image Playground generates images in distinct styles, including Animation — a modern, 3D-animated look — and Illustration, which offers images with simple shapes, clear lines, and colorblocking. The experience is integrated right into Messages, making it easier than ever to create images for conversations, as well as into apps like Freeform, Keynote, and many others. Image Playground is also available as a brand-new dedicated app. Create Genmoji to Fit Any Moment With the power of Apple Intelligence, emoji is taken to the next level with Genmoji, making conversations with family and friends more fun and playful, and opening up entirely new ways to communicate. By simply typing a description into the emoji keyboard, a Genmoji will appear, including multiple options to choose from. With images from their photo library, users can take Genmoji even further by creating one that is inspired by a friend or family member. Personalized Genmoji can be customized with accessories, like a hat or sunglasses, and can reflect themes or activities to make them even more personal and unique. Just like emoji, Genmoji can be added inline to messages, or shared as a sticker or reaction in a Tapback.1 Take Notes to the Next Level with Image Wand The Notes app gets new tools to make note-taking more visual and dynamic. With Image Wand in the tool palette, users can quickly create images in their note using the written or visual context already captured within the note. Image Wand transforms a rough sketch into a polished image by simply circling it. Users can even circle empty space within a note, and Image Wand will gather context from the surrounding area — using on-device generative models to analyze the handwritten or typed text — to create a relevant image that complements the note and makes it more visual. Users can create images with the Animation, Illustration, and an additional Sketch style in Image Wand. Describe Changes in Writing Tools Writing Tools build on the existing options of Rewrite, Proofread, and Summarize with the new ability for users to specify the change they’d like to make, using the new Describe Your Change option. Describe Your Change gives users even more flexibility and control when they’d like to make their writing sound more expressive, such as to add more dynamic action words to their resume or even rewrite a dinner party invitation in the form of a poem, and more. Just like all of the features with Writing Tools, this new Describe Your Change option is available systemwide across Apple and many third-party apps. Learn More About Surroundings in One Click with Visual Intelligence A new visual intelligence experience builds on Apple Intelligence and helps users learn about objects and places instantly, thanks to the new Camera Control on the iPhone 16 lineup. Visual intelligence can summarize and copy text, translate text between languages, detect phone numbers or email addresses with the option to add to contacts, and more. Camera Control also allows users to search Google so they can see where they can buy an item, or benefit from ChatGPT’s problem-solving skills to ask for an explanation about a complex diagram, such as from class notes. Users are in control of when third-party tools are used and what information is shared. Tap into ChatGPT with Siri and Writing Tools Apple is enabling ChatGPT access in Siri and Writing Tools experiences within iOS, iPadOS, and macOS, allowing users to access its expertise — as well as its image- and document-understanding capabilities — without needing to jump between applications. With the ChatGPT integration, Siri can suggest a user access ChatGPT for certain requests, and Siri can provide the response directly. With Compose, users can ask ChatGPT to generate content for anything they are writing about from the systemwide Writing Tools. They can also use ChatGPT’s image-generation capabilities to add images alongside their written content. Users can choose whether to enable ChatGPT integration, and are in full control of when to use it and what information is shared with ChatGPT. By default, a ChatGPT account is not required to use this integration. When using ChatGPT without an account, OpenAI will not store requests, and will not use the data for model training. Additionally, users’ IP addresses are obscured to prevent their sessions from being linked together. For those who choose to connect their account, OpenAI’s data-use policies apply. Even More Capabilities Coming Soon Additional Apple Intelligence capabilities will be available in the months to come. Siri will be even more capable, with the ability to draw on a user’s personal context to deliver intelligence that’s tailored to them. Siri will also gain onscreen awareness, and will be able to take hundreds of new actions in and across Apple and third-party apps. Priority Notifications will also surface what’s most important. In addition, users will be able to create images in Image Playground in a Sketch style, an academic and highly detailed style that uses a vibrant color palette combined with technical lines to produce realistic drawings. A Breakthrough for Privacy in AI Designed to protect users’ privacy at every step, Apple Intelligence uses on-device processing, meaning that many of the models that power it run entirely on device. For requests that require access to larger models, Private Cloud Compute extends the privacy and security of iPhone into the cloud to unlock even more intelligence. When using Private Cloud Compute, users’ data is never stored or shared with Apple; it is used only to fulfill their request. Independent experts can inspect the code that runs on Apple silicon servers to continuously verify this privacy promise, and are already doing so. This is an extraordinary step forward for privacy in AI.

                "title": "iOS 18.2 Features: Everything New in iOS 18.2 - MacRumors",
                "content": "iOS 18.2 is the second major update to iOS 18, and it brings the first Apple Intelligence image generation features, ChatGPT integration with Siri, and plenty more changes and bug fixes. This guide highlights everything that's new in iOS 18.2. There are several new ‌Apple Intelligence‌ features in iOS 18.2, including Image Playground and Genmoji. It's a more fun update than iOS 18.1 thanks to the image generation features. We have a much more in-depth Apple Intelligence guide that goes over all of the available features, which is well worth checking out. We also have individual guides on the new additions in iOS 18.2. For ‌iPhone 16‌ users, there's now an option lock your auto exposure and auto focus settings with a light press. The AE/AF Lock toggle can be turned on by going to Settings > Camera > Camera Control. There is also an option to adjust the double click speed of Camera Control. Options include Default, Slow, and Slower. The adjustment options join prior options to tweak the double light press speed and the light press force. As mentioned above, Camera Control now supports Visual Intelligence. The update also adds a new setting for the Camera Control button. In the Settings app under Display & Brightness, there is now a toggle for \"Require Screen On.\" When this setting is turned on, you can only launch the Camera app or a supported third-party camera app with the Camera Control button when the ‌iPhone‌'s screen is turned on. In the Mail app, there are new built-in categories for separating out important emails, deals, newsletters, transaction emails, and more. ‌Apple Intelligence‌ is required for Mail app categorization. The Mail app includes bigger pictures for contacts and businesses, and all emails from a single person or source will be pooled together. You can swap between categories (the new option) and List View (the non-categorization standard view) by tapping on the three dots in the upper right corner of the app. In the Mail section of the Settings app, you may need to go to Notifications > Customize Notifications > and toggle on All Unread Messages if you're using list view, because the other setting only shows you unread messages categorized as \"Primary,\" which can be confusing. Apple added a tweaked video player that takes up more of the screen in iOS 18.2. This change eliminates the thick borders around videos that appear on earlier ‌iOS 18‌ versions, meaning you no longer have to tap on a video for full-screen playback. It's now possible to scrub through a video frame-by-frame, plus there is a setting to turn off auto-looping video playback in the Photos section of the Settings app. When using the Collections views in the ‌Photos‌ app, you can swipe right to go back to the previous view, plus the Favorites album now appears in the Utilities collection along with the Pinned Collections section. You're also now able to clear Recently Viewed and Recently Shared album history. In the Safari section of the Settings app, there's a new \"Not Secure Connection Warning\" toggle that lets you know if you're visiting a website that does not have a valid SSL certificate for an encrypted connection. It is not advised to send passwords or other sensitive data on a site that pops up a \"Not Secure\" warning. Apple's \"Not Secure Connection Warning\" toggle is not turned on by default. Apple says that HTTPS Priority will upgrade URLs to HTTPS whenever possible. The Settings app has a new section for managing website data and history, with options for Clear History and Website Data. The Website Data section includes options for exporting data from Safari and importing data from another app into Safari. Apple added new background images for customizing the Safari start page. The progress of Safari downloads can now be tracked on the ‌iPhone‌'s Lock Screen and Dynamic Island. With Voice Memos, two tracks can be layered on top of one another. There's also an option to separate layers and edit layer mixes. Two-track projects can be imported directly into Logic Pro on the iPhone 16 Pro and ‌iPhone 16 Pro‌ Max. Find My has a new option to Share Item Location with an \"airline or trusted person\" that can help you locate something that you've misplaced. Choosing the Share Item Location option creates a link that lets someone view the location of a lost item when they open the link. The link can be opened on a non-Apple device, so an ‌iPhone‌ or Mac is not required to provide someone with your item's location. Links expire after a week or when you're reunited with your lost item. There's also an option to Show Contact Info, which lets any phone or tablet connect to an item to view a website with more information about it, including the phone number and email address of the owner. Apple Music now supports natural language search. You can search for genres, moods, activity, decades, and more. Examples include \"songs about cats,\" \"songs with a vibe,\" \"relaxing songs,\" \"artists similar to Taylor Swift,\" \"sad 80s songs,\" and \"songs about food.\" ‌Apple Music‌ now displays the disc number in some albums. In the Apple TV app, you can also use casual language search terms to find exactly what you're looking for, typing in genres, actors, and moods. Searches like \"movies about natural disasters,\" \"movies with cats,\" \"movies with Zendaya,\" and \"exhilarating movies\" all bring up relevant results. The navigation bar in the TV app can be customized, with options to add different apps and Library categories. Existing options like MLS and ‌Apple TV‌+ cannot be removed. You can favorite categories in the Podcasts app in iOS 18.2, and see categories in the library for a new way to navigate through shows and episodes. A new personalized search page in Podcasts suggests the most relevant categories and editorially curated collections tailored to your listening preferences. For Apple News+ subscribers in the United States, iOS 18.2 adds daily sudoku puzzles. The sudoku puzzles join existing the Crossword, Crossword Mini, and Quartiles offerings. There are three difficulty levels to complete each day, including easy, moderate, and challenging. In the Stocks app, there are now pre-market price quotes for tracking NASDAQ and NYSE tickers prior to when the market opens. The AirPods Pro 2 Hearing Test feature is now available in Cyprus, Czechia, France, Italy, Luxembourg, Romania, Spain, United Arab Emirates, and the UK. The Hearing Aid feature is available in the United Arab Emirates. In the Apple Arcade section of the App Store, the \"All Games\" section has a new drop down filter menu and the option to turn off game previews. In the European Union, users can now delete core apps that include the ‌App Store‌, Safari, Messages, Camera, and ‌Photos‌. Third-party browser apps in the EU will be able to create web apps for the ‌iPhone‌'s Home screen using their own custom engines when iOS 18.2 launches. iPadOS 18.2 requires selecting a Default Browser when opening Safari. This is a Digital Markets Act requirement, with Apple adding an updated interface that will let users select a default web browser of their choice from a list of options. Apple already implemented this change in ‌iOS 18‌. In the Settings app under \"Apps,\" there's a new \"Default Apps\" section that can be used to manage your default apps for the ‌iPhone‌. There are Default App settings for Email, Messaging, Calling, Call Filtering, Browser App, Passwords and Codes, and Keyboards. In the U.S. and other countries, you can use this section to choose your preferred Email, Call Filtering, Browser, and Passwords, and Keyboard apps. In the EU, there are more options for choosing non-Apple calling and messaging apps. In the Sound and Haptics section of the Settings app, there's a new Volume Limit option with a \"Limit Maximum Volume\" toggle to control how loudly the ‌iPhone‌ speaker can play audio like songs, movies, and other media. It does not impact phone calls, FaceTime calls, alarms, and other sounds. In Control Center, there's a new quick access option for Type to ‌Siri‌. Apple has also removed the Satellite control from the Connectivity section, and changed the icon for Adaptive Audio. Adjusting Camera Control can be done by opening Settings and going to Accessibility > Camera Button. In Dark Mode, the icons in the Settings app have a new, darker look that shows color on a black background rather than icons that are a solid color with white accents. iOS 18.2 allows you to use ‌iPhone‌ Mirroring while your ‌iPhone‌'s hotspot connection is being shared with your Mac. Having your Mac connected through Personal Hotspot previously did not allow you to use ‌iPhone‌ Mirroring. There are new Fitness app Shortcut actions that you can use when creating a Shortcut, including Open Fitness Settings, Open Award, Open Session History, and Open Trophy Case. In iOS 18.2, there's a new option to force the volume control bar to always be visible on the Lock Screen when adjusting sound. The feature can be enabled in the Accessibility section of the Settings app. Accessibility > Audio and Visual > Always Show Volume Control. There's an option see Vehicle Motion Cues in the ‌Dynamic Island‌ when the feature is activated. Vehicle Motion Cues are designed to cut down on motion sickness while riding in a vehicle. When connecting to a Mac or PC, you can use Face ID to trust a device. Children in Australia have access to a tool to report iMessages that contain nude photos and videos. Reported images will be reviewed by Apple, and actions could be taken such as disabling the sender's Apple Account or reporting the incident to law enforcement. The feature will expand globally in the future. In iOS 18.2, the Music Recognition feature in the Control Center has a Musical Memories feature that shows you where you were when you identified a song. You will need to long press on the Music Recognition toggle in Control Center, tap on History, and then allow location access to use the feature. The AirDrop icon in the share sheet now appears dark in ‌Dark Mode‌, rather than staying white. Utah residents under the age of 17 will be opted in to web content restrictions that block adult content in iOS 18.2. This is required by Utah law. There are fixes for a couple of notable bugs in iOS 18.2. The update addresses an issue that could cause captured photos to not immediately appear in the All ‌Photos‌ grid. It also fixes a bug that could cause Night mode photos to appear degraded when capturing long exposures, a problem that impacted the ‌iPhone 16 Pro‌ and ‌iPhone 16 Pro‌ Max. iOS 18.2 addresses multiple security vulnerabilities, which means it's a good idea to update as soon as you can. A full list of the vulnerabilities fixed can be found on Apple's website, but it includes updates for the kernel, Passwords, Safari, WebKit, VoiceOver, and more.

                "content": "When you purchase through links in our articles, we may earn a small commission. This doesn't affect our editorial independence. We got our first taste of Apple Intelligence in iOS 18.1, but there were many missing features. With iOS 18.2, we get a lot of them, including Visual Intelligence, image generation, ChatGPT integration, and more. And if you have an older iPhone or just aren’t interested in Apple Intelligence, there are quite a few welcome improvements in the iOS/iPadOS 18.2 release that are not related to AI, too. However, while Siri’s interface changed in iOS 18.1, the new smarter Siri, one of the premier Apple Intelligence features, still isn’t a part of this release. That will likely be coming in iOS 18.3 in January or 18.4, due for release around March 2025. You can learn more about it in our article about upcoming Apple Intelligence features. Apple announced Wednesday morning that iOS 18.2 will be arriving today. Apple usually pushes its software updates at 10am PT, but it could arrive at any moment. Update December 11: Apple has released iOS 18.2 (and it’s fellow iPadOS, macOS, tvOS, watchOS, and visionOS updates). The Apple Intelligence features part of iOS 18.2 are still limited to just six phones: the entire iPhone 16 lineup and the iPhone 15 Pro and 15 Pro Max. If your phone supports it, there is a secondary waiting list to access certain features. If you were on the original waiting list for Apple Intelligence features in iOS 18.1 you will get access to ChatGPT integration, Visual Intelligence, and the new Writing Tools features. But you’ll have to hop onto a second waiting list for the image generation features—Genmoji, Image Playground, and the Image Wand tool. Here’s are all of the new Apple Intelligence features available in iOS 18.2: Writing Tools: Instead of just choosing to make a selection of text more professional, causal, or concise, you will have a freeform field to describe how you want to transform text. Examples: make this a poem, include a lot of dad jokes, or use a lot of sarcasm. Genmoji: Create a new emoji right on the system keyboard. Image Playground: Generate new images based on text prompts. Apple will suggest new costumes, items, or locations, and will make suggestions based on the context of a Messages thread or note in the Notes app. Images can be based on people you know by using identified images in Photos. Images are limited to cartoon or illustrative styles rather than realistic. Visual Intelligence: For iPhone 16 owners with the Camera Control button. Press and hold Camera Control to get additional information about a location, translate a sign or poster, detect phone numbers and addresses to quickly add to Contacts, and more. You can also tap a button to ask ChatGPT about what’s on screen, or another to perform a Google image search. Image Wand: An offshoot of Image Playground, this uses Apple’s image generation tools to create an image in an open area on a note in the Notes app, using the context from the surrounding area and the rest of the note. Start with a blank area or a rough sketch you make yourself. ChatGPT integration: If Siri can’t answer a question, it now has the option to ask ChatGPT. You need to give permission for each request and only limited data is shared. You don’t need to log into ChatGPT, but you are able to if you want to, or have a premium ChatGPT account you wish to use. You can ask Siri to have ChatGPT generate images., and use ChatGPT in the Writing Tools to generate text, too. Foundry In addition to the new user-facing features below, there are new developer tools for integrating image generation and writing tools into third-party apps. Apple Intelligence is localized into English for Australia, Canada, New Zealand, South Africa, and the UK in this release. Default Apps: Users worldwide have a new “Default Apps” section at the top Settings > Apps, where you can choose your default email, messaging, calling, call filtering, browser, password app, and keyboard. The messaging and calling options are new, and the other options have all been brought under a single menu. EU-specific features: In the EU, third-party browser that use their own custom web engines can now add web apps. EU users will also be able to delete the App Store. AE/AF Lock: In Settings > Camera, you’ll find a new toggle for a light press on the Camera Control button to lock exposure and focus. Find My share item location: Find My will let you share the location of an AirTag (or other Find My compatible item) with a trusted person. The link can be opened on a non-Apple device and expires after a week. Mail app categories: The Mail app gets its AI-powered auto-category feature, splitting your inbox into Primary, Transactions, Updates, and Promotions. Volume limits and lock screen slider: You’ll be able to set volume limits for media playing from the iPhone’s speaker, and can restore the volume bar to the media card on the lock screen. The iPhone 16 is one of six phones able to run Apple Intelligence. Chris Martin / Foundry These are Apple’s official release notes for iOS 18.2: Apple Intelligence (All iPhone 16 models, iPhone 15 Pro, iPhone 15 Pro Max) Camera Control (iPhone 16, iPhone 16 Plus, iPhone 16 Pro, iPhone 16 Pro Max) Mail Photos Safari This update also includes the following improvements and bug fixes: As with all updates, iOS 18.2 will include numerous security patches and fixes that are crucial to compatible iPhones. More information can be found on Apple’s security releases support page. To get the latest version of iOS 18 on your phone, head over to the Settings app, then General and Software Update. Then follow the prompts to restart and install the update. If you don’t want to wait until the official update arrives, you can install the most recent release candidate, which will be identical to the public release, by turning on Beta Updates in the Software Update tab.

                "title": "\n    Elon Musk's net worth tops $400 billion, a first for any person. Here's where he gets his wealth. - CBS News",
                "content": "Watch CBS News By Aimee Picchi Edited By Anne Marie Lee Updated on: December 11, 2024 / 4:46 PM EST / CBS News Tesla CEO Elon Musk has become the first person to top a net worth of $400 billion, according to Bloomberg News. Musk's wealth, which was last counted at $384 billion by the Bloomberg Billionaires Index, jumped after an insider share sale of SpaceX, the space exploration company that he founded. According to Bloomberg, the sale boosted Musk's net worth by about $50 billion, bringing his current net worth to $429.2 billion. The world's second wealthiest person, Jeff Bezos, is worth $244 billion, Bloomberg Billionaires Index shows. Musk's fortunes have been turbocharged since the Nov. 5 presidential election, with President-elect Donald Trump's victory helping to lift the tech executive's wealth. That's because Tesla shareholders believe Musk's decision to spend millions on Trump's candidacy will reap dividends through federal policies that could help the electric vehicle maker. Since the election, shares of Tesla have soared almost 70%, lifting the value of his stake to about $165 billion, according to Bloomberg. His stake in xAI, his artificial intelligence company, is worth about $25 billion, while his SpaceX holdings were worth about $82 billion before the private sale, Bloomberg reported. His other holdings include X, the social media app and the Boring Company. Meanwhile, Musk will hold a key position as the co-head of the Trump administration's newly created Department of Government Efficiency. Despite the name, the group isn't an official government department, although it plans to provide recommendations on paring federal spending.

                "title": "Elon Musk - Wikipedia",
                "content": "Elon Reeve Musk FRS (/ˈiːlɒn/; born June 28, 1971) is a businessman known for his key roles in the space company SpaceX and the automotive company Tesla, Inc. His other involvements include ownership of X Corp., the company that operates the social media platform X (formerly Twitter), and his role in the founding of the Boring Company, xAI, Neuralink, and OpenAI. Musk is the wealthiest individual in the world; as of December 2024[update], Forbes estimates his net worth to be US$344 billion.[2] A member of the wealthy South African Musk family, Musk was born in Pretoria and briefly attended the University of Pretoria before immigrating to Canada at the age of 18, acquiring citizenship through his Canadian-born mother. Two years later, he matriculated at Queen's University at Kingston in Canada. Musk later transferred to the University of Pennsylvania and received bachelor's degrees in economics and physics. He moved to California in 1995 to attend Stanford University but never enrolled in classes, and with his brother Kimbal co-founded the online city guide software company Zip2. The startup was acquired by Compaq for $307 million in 1999. That same year, Musk co-founded X.com, a direct bank. X.com merged with Confinity in 2000 to form PayPal. In 2002, Musk acquired US citizenship, and that October eBay acquired PayPal for $1.5 billion. Using $100 million of the money he made from the sale of PayPal, Musk founded SpaceX, a spaceflight services company, in 2002. In 2004, Musk was an early investor in electric-vehicle manufacturer Tesla Motors, Inc. (later Tesla, Inc.), providing most of the initial financing and assuming the position of the company's chairman. He later became the product architect and, in 2008, the CEO. In 2006, Musk helped create SolarCity, a solar energy company that was acquired by Tesla in 2016 and became Tesla Energy. In 2013, he proposed a hyperloop high-speed vactrain transportation system. In 2015, he co-founded OpenAI, a nonprofit artificial intelligence research company. The following year Musk co-founded Neuralink, a neurotechnology company developing brain–computer interfaces, and The Boring Company, a tunnel construction company. In 2018 the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) sued Musk, alleging that he had falsely announced that he had secured funding for a private takeover of Tesla. To settle the case Musk stepped down as the chairman of Tesla and paid a $20 million fine. In 2022, he acquired Twitter for $44 billion, merged the company into the newly-created X Corp. and rebranded the service as X the following year. In March 2023, Musk founded xAI, an artificial-intelligence company. Musk's actions and expressed views have made him a polarizing figure. He has been criticized for making unscientific and misleading statements, including COVID-19 misinformation, promoting right-wing conspiracy theories, and endorsing an antisemitic trope; he has since apologized for the latter, but continued endorsing such statements. His ownership of Twitter has been controversial because of the layoffs of large numbers of employees, an increase in hate speech, misinformation and disinformation posts on the website, and changes to website features, including verification. In early 2024, Musk became active in American politics as a vocal and financial supporter of Donald Trump, becoming Trump's second-largest individual donor in October 2024. In November 2024, Trump announced that he had chosen Musk along with Vivek Ramaswamy to co-lead Trump's planned Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) advisory board which will make recommendations on improving government efficiency through measures such as slashing \"excess regulations\" and cutting \"wasteful expenditures\". Elon Reeve Musk was born on June 28, 1971, in Pretoria, South Africa's administrative capital.[3][4] He is of British and Pennsylvania Dutch ancestry.[5][6] His mother, Maye (née Haldeman), is a model and dietitian born in Saskatchewan, Canada, and raised in South Africa.[7][8][9] His father, Errol Musk, is a South African electromechanical engineer, pilot, sailor, consultant, emerald dealer, and property developer, who partly owned a rental lodge at the Timbavati Private Nature Reserve.[10][11][12][13] Elon has a younger brother, Kimbal, and a younger sister, Tosca.[9][14] Elon has four paternal half-siblings.[15][16][17] The family was wealthy during Elon's youth.[13] Despite both Elon and Errol previously stating that Errol was a part owner of a Zambian emerald mine,[13] in 2023, Errol recounted that the deal he made was to receive \"a portion of the emeralds produced at three small mines\".[18][19] Errol was elected to the Pretoria City Council as a representative of the anti-apartheid Progressive Party and has said that his children shared their father's dislike of apartheid.[3] Elon's maternal grandfather, Joshua N. Haldeman, was an American-born Canadian who took his family on record-breaking journeys to Africa and Australia in a single-engine Bellanca airplane; Haldeman died when Elon was still a toddler.[16][20][21][22] Elon has recounted trips to a wilderness school that he described as a \"paramilitary Lord of the Flies\" where \"bullying was a virtue\" and children were encouraged to fight over rations.[23] After his parents divorced in 1980, Elon chose to live primarily with his father.[5][10] Elon later regretted his decision and became estranged from his father.[24] Elon attended Bryanston High School.[25] In one incident, after an altercation with a fellow pupil, Elon was thrown down concrete steps and beaten severely by the boy and his friends, leading to him being hospitalized for his injuries.[26] Elon described his father berating him after he was discharged from the hospital, saying, \"I had to stand for an hour as he yelled at me and called me an idiot and told me that I was just worthless.\"[26] Errol denied berating Elon but claimed, \"The boy had just lost his father to suicide and Elon had called him stupid. Elon had a tendency to call people stupid. How could I possibly blame that child?\".[27] After the incident, Elon was enrolled in private school.[26][27] Elon was an enthusiastic reader of books, later attributing his success in part to having read The Lord of the Rings, the Foundation series, and The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy.[12][28] At age ten, he developed an interest in computing and video games, teaching himself how to program from the VIC-20 user manual.[29] At age twelve, Elon sold his BASIC-based game Blastar to PC and Office Technology magazine for approximately $500.[30][31] Musk attended Waterkloof House Preparatory School, Bryanston High School, and then Pretoria Boys High School, where he graduated.[32] Musk was a good but not exceptional student, earning a 61 in Afrikaans and a B on his senior math certification.[33] Musk applied for a Canadian passport through his Canadian-born mother to avoid South Africa's mandatory military service,[34][35] which would have forced him to participate in the apartheid regime,[3] and to ease his path to immigration to the United States.[36] While waiting for his application to be processed, he attended the University of Pretoria for five months.[37] Musk arrived in Canada in June 1989, connected with a second cousin in Saskatchewan,[38] and worked odd jobs including at a farm and a lumber mill.[39] In 1990, he entered Queen's University in Kingston, Ontario.[40][41] Two years later, he transferred to the University of Pennsylvania, where he studied until 1995.[42] Although Musk has said that he earned his degrees in 1995, the University of Pennsylvania did not award them until 1997 – a Bachelor of Arts in physics and a Bachelor of Science in economics from the university's Wharton School.[43][44][45][46][47][48] He reportedly hosted large, ticketed house parties to help pay for tuition, and wrote a business plan for an electronic book-scanning service similar to Google Books.[49] In 1994, Musk held two internships in Silicon Valley: one at energy storage startup Pinnacle Research Institute, which investigated electrolytic ultracapacitors for energy storage, and another at Palo Alto–based startup Rocket Science Games.[50][51] In 1995, he was accepted to a graduate program in materials science at Stanford University, but did not enroll.[46][43][52] Musk decided to join the Internet boom, applying for a job at Netscape, to which he reportedly never received a response.[53][34] The Washington Post reported that Musk lacked legal authorization to remain and work in the United States after failing to enroll at Stanford.[52] In response, Musk claimed he was allowed to work at that time and that his student visa transitioned to an H1-B. According to numerous former business associates and shareholders, Musk claimed he was on a student visa at the time.[54] In 1995, Musk, his brother Kimbal, and Greg Kouri founded Global Link Information Network, later renamed Zip2.[55][56] The company developed an Internet city guide with maps, directions, and yellow pages, and marketed it to newspapers.[57] They worked at a small rented office in Palo Alto,[58] with Musk coding the website every night.[58] Musk and his brother's immigration statuses during this period were described by Musk as a \"gray area\", although Kimbal maintained they were working as illegal immigrants.[59][60] A Washington Post exposé from October 2024 reported Musk worked illegally while building the company, citing an email from Musk submitted as evidence during a 2005 defamation trial and the funding agreement from venture capital firm Mohr Davidow Ventures.[52] Eventually, Zip2 obtained contracts with The New York Times and the Chicago Tribune.[49] The brothers persuaded the board of directors to abandon a merger with CitySearch;[61] however, Musk's attempts to become CEO were thwarted.[62] Compaq acquired Zip2 for $307 million in cash in February 1999,[63][64] and Musk received $22 million for his 7-percent share.[65] In March 1999,[66] Musk co-founded X.com, an online financial services and e-mail payment company with $12 million of the money he made from the Compaq acquisition.[67] X.com was one of the first online banks that was federally insured, and over 200,000 customers joined in its initial months of operation.[68] Musk's friends expressed skepticism about the naming of the online bank, fearing it might have been mistaken for a pornographic site. Musk brushed off their concerns, emphasizing that the name was meant to be straightforward, memorable, and easy to type. Additionally, he was fond of the email addresses derived from it, such as \"e@x.com\".[66] Although Musk founded the company, investors regarded him as inexperienced and replaced him with Intuit CEO Bill Harris by the end of the year.[69] In 2000, X.com merged with the online bank Confinity to avoid competition,[58][69][70] as the latter's money-transfer service PayPal was more popular than X.com's service.[71] Musk then returned as CEO of the merged company. His preference for Microsoft- over Unix-based software caused a rift among the company's employees, and eventually led Confinity co-founder Peter Thiel to resign.[72] With the company suffering from compounding technological issues and the lack of a cohesive business model, the board ousted Musk and replaced him with Thiel in September 2000.[73][a] Under Thiel, the company focused on the money-transfer service and was renamed PayPal in 2001.[75][76] In 2002, PayPal was acquired by eBay for $1.5 billion in stock, of which Musk—PayPal's largest shareholder with 11.7% of shares—received $176 million.[77][78] In 2017, more than 15 years later, Musk purchased the X.com domain from PayPal for its \"sentimental value\".[79][80] In 2022, Musk discussed a goal of creating \"X, the everything app\".[81] In early 2001, Musk became involved with the nonprofit Mars Society and discussed funding plans to place a growth-chamber for plants on Mars.[82] In October of the same year, he traveled to Moscow, Russia with Jim Cantrell, Adeo Ressi, and future NASA Administrator Michael D. Griffin[83] to buy refurbished intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs) that could send the greenhouse payloads into space. He met with the companies NPO Lavochkin and Kosmotras; however, Musk was seen as a novice[84] and the group returned to the United States without an agreement to purchase Russian launch services. In February 2002, the group returned to Russia to look for three ICBMs. They had another meeting with Kosmotras and were offered one rocket for $8 million, which Musk rejected. He instead decided to start a company that could build affordable rockets.[84] With $100 million of his own money,[85] Musk founded SpaceX in May 2002 and became the company's CEO and chief engineer.[86][87] SpaceX attempted its first launch of the Falcon 1 rocket in 2006.[88] Although the rocket failed to reach Earth orbit, it was awarded a Commercial Orbital Transportation Services program contract from NASA, now led by Michael D. Griffin as Administrator.[89][90] After two more failed attempts that nearly caused Musk and his companies to go bankrupt,[88] SpaceX succeeded in launching the Falcon 1 into orbit in 2008.[91] Later that year, SpaceX received a $1.6 billion Commercial Resupply Services contract from NASA for 12 flights of its Falcon 9 rocket and Dragon spacecraft to the International Space Station (ISS), replacing the Space Shuttle after its 2011 retirement.[92] In 2012, the Dragon vehicle docked with the ISS, a first for a commercial spacecraft.[93] Working towards its goal of reusable rockets, in 2015 SpaceX successfully landed the first stage of a Falcon 9 on a land platform.[94] Later landings were achieved on autonomous spaceport drone ships, an ocean-based recovery platform.[95] In 2018, SpaceX launched the Falcon Heavy; the inaugural mission carried Musk's personal Tesla Roadster as a dummy payload.[96][97] Since 2019,[98] SpaceX has been developing Starship, a fully-reusable, super-heavy-lift launch vehicle intended to replace the Falcon 9 and the Falcon Heavy.[99] In 2020, SpaceX launched its first crewed flight, the Demo-2, becoming the first private company to place astronauts into orbit and dock a crewed spacecraft with the ISS.[100] In 2024, NASA awarded SpaceX an $843 million contract to deorbit the ISS at the end of its lifespan.[101] In 2015, SpaceX began development of the Starlink constellation of low-Earth-orbit satellites to provide satellite Internet access,[102] with the first two prototype satellites launched in February 2018. A second set of test satellites, and the first large deployment of a piece of the constellation, occurred in May 2019, when the first 60 operational satellites were launched.[103] The total cost of the decade-long project to design, build, and deploy the constellation was estimated by SpaceX in 2020 to be $10 billion.[104][b] Some critics, including the International Astronomical Union, have alleged that Starlink blocks the view of the sky and poses a collision threat to spacecraft.[107][108][109] During the March 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, Musk sent Starlink terminals to Ukraine to provide Internet access and communication.[110] In October 2022, Musk stated that about 20,000 satellite terminals had been donated to Ukraine, together with free data transfer subscriptions, which cost SpaceX $80 million. After asking the United States Department of Defense to pay for further units and future subscriptions on behalf of Ukraine,[111] Musk publicly stated that SpaceX would continue to provide Starlink to Ukraine for free, at a yearly cost to itself of $400 million.[112][113][114] At the same time, Musk refused to block Russian state media on Starlink, declaring himself \"a free speech absolutist\".[115][116] In September 2023, Ukraine asked for the activation of Starlink satellites over Crimea to attack Russian naval vessels located at the port Sevastopol; Musk denied the request, citing concerns that Russia would respond with a nuclear attack.[117][118][119] Tesla, Inc., originally Tesla Motors, was incorporated in July 2003 by Martin Eberhard and Marc Tarpenning. Both men played active roles in the company's early development prior to Musk's involvement.[120] Musk led the Series A round of investment in February 2004; he invested $6.35 million, became the majority shareholder, and joined Tesla's board of directors as chairman.[121][122] Musk took an active role within the company and oversaw Roadster product design, but was not deeply involved in day-to-day business operations.[123] Following a series of escalating conflicts in 2007, and the financial crisis of 2007–2008, Eberhard was ousted from the firm.[124][page needed][125] Musk assumed leadership of the company as CEO and product architect in 2008.[126] A 2009 lawsuit settlement with Eberhard designated Musk as a Tesla co-founder, along with Tarpenning and two others.[127][128] As of 2019, Musk was the longest-tenured CEO of any automotive manufacturer globally.[129] In 2021, Musk nominally changed his title to \"Technoking\" while retaining his position as CEO.[130] Tesla began delivery of the Roadster, an electric sports car, in 2008. With sales of about 2,500 vehicles, it was the first serial production all-electric car to use lithium-ion battery cells.[131] Tesla began delivery of its four-door Model S sedan in 2012.[132] A crossover, the Model X was launched in 2015.[133] A mass-market sedan, the Model 3, was released in 2017.[134] In 2020, the Model 3 became the all-time bestselling plug-in electric car worldwide, and in June 2021 it became the first electric car to sell 1 million units globally.[135][136] A fifth vehicle, the Model Y crossover, was launched in 2020, and in December 2023, became the best-selling vehicle of any type,[137] as well as the all-time best-selling electric car.[138] The Cybertruck, an all-electric pickup truck, was unveiled in 2019,[139] and delivered in November 2023.[140] Under Musk, Tesla has also constructed multiple lithium-ion battery and electric vehicle factories, named Gigafactories.[141] Since its initial public offering in 2010,[142] Tesla stock has risen significantly; it became the most valuable carmaker in summer 2020,[143][144] and it entered the S&P 500 later that year.[145][146] In October 2021, it reached a market capitalization of $1 trillion, the sixth company in US history to do so.[147] In November 2021, Musk proposed on Twitter to sell some of his Tesla stock.[148] After more than 3.5 million Twitter accounts supported the sale, Musk sold $6.9 billion of Tesla stock within a week,[148] and a total of $16.4 billion by year end, reaching the 10% target.[149] In February 2022, The Wall Street Journal reported that both Musk and his brother Kimbal were under investigation by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for possible insider trading related to the sale.[150] In 2022, Musk unveiled Optimus, a robot being developed by Tesla.[151] In June 2023, Musk met with Indian prime minister Narendra Modi in New York City, stating he was interested in investing in India \"as soon as humanly possible\".[152] In 2018, Musk was sued by the SEC for a tweet stating that funding had been secured for potentially taking Tesla private.[153][c] The lawsuit characterized the tweet as false, misleading, and damaging to investors, and sought to bar Musk from serving as CEO of publicly traded companies.[153][157][158] Two days later, Musk settled with the SEC, without admitting or denying the SEC's allegations. As a result, Musk and Tesla were fined $20 million each, and Musk was forced to step down for three years as Tesla chairman but was able to remain as CEO.[159] Shareholders filed a lawsuit over the tweet,[160] and in February 2023, a jury found Musk and Tesla not liable.[161] Musk has stated in interviews that he does not regret posting the tweet that triggered the SEC investigation.[162][163] In 2019, Musk stated in a tweet that Tesla would build half a million cars that year.[164] The SEC reacted by asking a court to hold him in contempt for violating the terms of the 2018 settlement agreement. A joint agreement between Musk and the SEC eventually clarified the previous agreement details,[165] including a list of topics about which Musk needed preclearance.[166] In 2020, a judge blocked a lawsuit that claimed a tweet by Musk regarding Tesla stock price (\"too high imo\") violated the agreement.[167][168] Freedom of Information Act (FOIA)-released records showed that the SEC concluded Musk had subsequently violated the agreement twice by tweeting regarding \"Tesla's solar roof production volumes and its stock price\".[169] Musk provided the initial concept and financial capital for SolarCity, which his cousins Lyndon and Peter Rive founded in 2006.[170] By 2013, SolarCity was the second largest provider of solar power systems in the United States.[171] In 2014, Musk promoted the idea of SolarCity building an advanced production facility in Buffalo, New York, triple the size of the largest solar plant in the United States.[172] Construction of the factory started in 2014 and was completed in 2017. It operated as a joint venture with Panasonic until early 2020.[173][174] Tesla acquired SolarCity for $2 billion in 2016 and merged it with its battery unit to create Tesla Energy. The deal's announcement resulted in a more than 10% drop in Tesla's stock price; at the time, SolarCity was facing liquidity issues.[175] Multiple shareholder groups filed a lawsuit against Musk and Tesla's directors, stating that the purchase of SolarCity was done solely to benefit Musk and came at the expense of Tesla and its shareholders.[176][177] Tesla directors settled the lawsuit in January 2020, leaving Musk the sole remaining defendant.[178][179] Two years later, the court ruled in Musk's favor.[180] In 2016, Musk co-founded Neuralink, a neurotechnology startup company, with an investment of $100 million.[181][182] Neuralink aims to integrate the human brain with artificial intelligence (AI) by creating devices that are embedded in the brain. Such technology could enhance memory or allow the devices to communicate with software.[182][183] The company also hopes to develop devices with which to treat neurological conditions such as Alzheimer's disease, dementia, and spinal cord injuries.[184] In 2019, Musk announced work on a device akin to a sewing machine that could embed threads into a human brain.[181] In an October 2019 paper that detailed some of Neuralink's research,[185] Musk was listed as the sole author, which rankled Neuralink researchers.[186] At a 2020 live demonstration, Musk described one of their early devices as \"a Fitbit in your skull\" that could soon cure paralysis, deafness, blindness, and other disabilities. Many neuroscientists and publications criticized these claims,[187][188][189] with MIT Technology Review describing them as \"highly speculative\" and \"neuroscience theater\".[187] During the demonstration, Musk revealed a pig with a Neuralink implant that tracked neural activity related to smell.[184] In 2022, Neuralink announced that clinical trials would begin by the end of the year.[190] Neuralink has conducted further animal testing on macaque monkeys at the University of California, Davis' Primate Research Center. In 2021, the company released a video in which a Macaque played the video game Pong via a Neuralink implant. The company's animal trials—which have caused the deaths of some monkeys—have led to claims of animal cruelty. The Physicians Committee for Responsible Medicine has alleged that Neuralink's animal trials have violated the Animal Welfare Act.[191] Employees have complained that pressure from Musk to accelerate development has led to botched experiments and unnecessary animal deaths. In 2022, a federal probe was launched into possible animal welfare violations by Neuralink.[192] In September 2023, the Food and Drug Administration approved Neuralink to initiate human trials, and it plans to conduct a six-year study.[193] In 2017, Musk founded The Boring Company to construct tunnels, and revealed plans for specialized, underground, high-occupancy vehicles that could travel up to 150 miles per hour (240 km/h) and thus circumvent above-ground traffic in major cities.[194][195] Early in 2017, the company began discussions with regulatory bodies and initiated construction of a 30-foot (9.1 m) wide, 50-foot (15 m) long, and 15-foot (4.6 m) deep \"test trench\" on the premises of SpaceX's offices, as that required no permits.[196] The Los Angeles tunnel, less than two miles (3.2 km) in length, debuted to journalists in 2018. It used Tesla Model Xs and was reported to be a rough ride while traveling at suboptimal speeds.[197] Two tunnel projects announced in 2018, in Chicago and West Los Angeles, have been canceled.[198][199] However, a tunnel beneath the Las Vegas Convention Center was completed in early 2021.[200] Local officials have approved further expansions of the tunnel system.[201] I made an offerhttps://sec.gov/Archives/edgar... Musk expressed interest in buying Twitter as early as 2017,[203] and had questioned the platform's commitment to freedom of speech.[204][205] Additionally, his ex-wife Talulah Riley had urged him to buy Twitter to stop the \"woke-ism\".[206] In January 2022, Musk started purchasing Twitter shares, reaching a 9.2% stake by April,[207] making him the largest shareholder.[208][d] When this was publicly disclosed, Twitter shares experienced the largest intraday price surge since the company's 2013 initial public offering.[210] On April 4, Musk agreed to a deal that would appoint him to Twitter's board of directors and prohibit him from acquiring more than 14.9% of the company.[211][212] However, on April 13, Musk made a $43 billion offer to buy Twitter, launching a takeover bid to buy 100% of Twitter's stock at $54.20 per share.[208][213] In response, Twitter's board adopted a \"poison pill\" shareholder rights plan to make it more expensive for any single investor to own more than 15% of the company without board approval.[214] Nevertheless, by the end of the month Musk had successfully concluded his bid for approximately $44 billion.[215] This included about $12.5 billion in loans against his Tesla stock and $21 billion in equity financing.[216][217] Tesla's stock market value sank by over $100 billion the next day in reaction to the deal.[218][219] He subsequently tweeted to his 86 million followers criticism of Twitter executive Vijaya Gadde's policies, which led to some of them engaging in sexist and racist harassment against her.[220] Exactly a month after announcing the takeover, Musk stated that the deal was \"on hold\" following a report that 5% of Twitter's daily active users were spam accounts.[221] Although he initially affirmed his commitment to the acquisition,[222] he sent notification of his termination of the deal in July; Twitter's board of directors responded that they were committed to holding him to the transaction.[223] On July 12, 2022, Twitter formally sued Musk in the Chancery Court of Delaware for breaching a legally binding agreement to purchase Twitter.[224] In October 2022, Musk reversed again, offering to purchase Twitter at $54.20 per share.[225] The acquisition was officially completed on October 27.[226] Immediately after the acquisition, Musk fired several top Twitter executives including CEO Parag Agrawal;[226][227] Musk became the CEO instead.[228] He instituted a $7.99 monthly subscription for a \"blue check\",[229][230][231] and laid off a significant portion of the company's staff.[232][233] Musk lessened content moderation, including reinstating accounts like The Babylon Bee.[234][235] The Southern Poverty Law Center noted that Twitter has verified numerous extremists;[236] hate speech also increased on the platform after his takeover.[237][238] In December 2022, Musk released internal documents relating to Twitter's moderation of Hunter Biden's laptop controversy in the leadup to the 2020 presidential election.[239] Comments on these internal documents by journalists Matt Taibbi, Bari Weiss, Michael Shellenberger and others were posted on Twitter as the Twitter Files. Musk and many Republicans alleged the documents showed the FBI had engaged in government censorship by ordering Twitter to suppress a New York Post story about the laptop. Upon review of the documents, Taibbi said he had found no evidence to support the allegation, and Twitter attorneys denied the allegation in a subsequent court filing.[240][241] The United States House Committee on the Judiciary held hearings on the Twitter Files on March 9, 2023, at which Taibbi and Shellenberger gave testimony.[242] In late 2022, Musk promised to step down as CEO after a Twitter poll posted by Musk found that a majority of users wanted him to do so.[243][244] Five months later, Musk stepped down from CEO and placed former NBCUniversal executive Linda Yaccarino in the position and transitioned his role to executive chairman and chief technology officer.[245] On November 20, 2023, in a U.S. District Court in Texas, X filed a lawsuit stating that Media Matters \"manipulated\" the X platform, in that it used accounts that followed major brands, and \"resorted to endlessly scrolling and refreshing\" the feed until it found ads next to extremist posts.[246] The Wall Street Journal reported in August 2024 that the $13 billion Musk borrowed to buy Twitter \"is now considered the worst deal in merger finance that banks have participated in since the 2008 to '09 financial crisis\", adding that \"the allure of banking Elon Musk, providing capital for him to buy a company, not only would reward them handsomely if things went according to plan\" but \"you can certainly say things have not gone according to plan\".[247] The Washington Post reported in September 2024 that the company had lost $24 billion in equity value, \"a vaporization of wealth that has little parallel outside the realm of economic or industry-specific crashes, or devastating corporate scandals\".[248] Two years after the acquisition, Fidelity Investments estimated the value of its stake in X that implied the company had lost 79% of its value.[249] Musk is often described as a micromanager and has called himself a \"nano-manager\".[250] The New York Times has characterized his approach as absolutist.[251] Musk does not make formal business plans.[251] He has forced employees to adopt the company's own jargon and launched ambitious, risky, and costly projects against his advisors' recommendations, such as removing front-facing radar from Tesla Autopilot. His insistence on vertical integration causes his companies to move most production in-house. While this resulted in saved costs for SpaceX's rocket,[252] vertical integration (as of 2018) has caused many usability problems for Tesla's internal corporate software.[250][needs update] Musk's handling of employees—whom he communicates with directly through mass emails—has been characterized as \"carrot and stick\", rewarding those \"who offer constructive criticism\" while also being known to impulsively threaten, swear at, and fire his employees.[253][254][255] Musk said he expects his employees to work for long hours, sometimes 80 hours per week.[256] He has his new employees sign strict non-disclosure agreements and often fires in sprees,[257][255] such as during the Model 3 \"production hell\" in 2018.[255] In 2022, Musk revealed plans to fire 10 percent of Tesla's workforce, due to his concerns about the economy.[258] That same month, he suspended remote work at SpaceX and Tesla and threatened to fire employees who do not work 40 hours per week in the office.[259] He laid off more than 10 percent of the Tesla workforce in early 2024. Musk's leadership has been praised by some, who credit it with the success of Tesla and his other endeavors,[250] and criticized by others, who see him as callous and his managerial decisions as \"show[ing] a lack of human understanding\".[255][260] The 2021 book Power Play contains anecdotes of Musk berating employees.[261] The Wall Street Journal reported that, after Musk insisted on branding his vehicles as \"self-driving\", he faced criticism from his engineers for putting customer \"lives at risk\", with some[quantify] employees resigning in 2017 in consequence.[262] Musk is president of the Musk Foundation he founded in 2001,[263][264] whose stated purpose is to: provide solar-power energy systems in disaster areas; support research, development, and advocacy (for interests including human space exploration, pediatrics, renewable energy and \"safe artificial intelligence\"); and support science and engineering educational efforts.[265] As of 2020, the foundation has made 350 donations. Around half of them were made to scientific research or education nonprofits. Notable beneficiaries include the Wikimedia Foundation, his alma mater the University of Pennsylvania, and his brother Kimbal's nonprofit Big Green.[266] From 2002 to 2018, the foundation gave $25 million directly to nonprofit organizations, nearly half of which went to Musk's OpenAI,[267] which was a nonprofit at the time.[268] The Foundation also allocated $100 million of donations to be used to establish a new higher education university in Texas.[269] In 2012, Musk took the Giving Pledge, thereby committing to give the majority of his wealth to charitable causes either during his lifetime or in his will.[270] He has endowed prizes at the X Prize Foundation, including $100 million to reward improved carbon capture technology.[271] Vox said in February 2021, \"the Musk Foundation is almost entertaining in its simplicity and yet is strikingly opaque\", noting that its website was only 33 words in plain-text.[267] In 2020, Forbes gave Musk a philanthropy score of 1, because he had given away less than 1% of his net worth.[266] In November 2021, Musk donated $5.7 billion of Tesla's shares to charity, according to regulatory filings.[272] However, Bloomberg News noted that all of it went to his own foundation, bringing Musk Foundation's assets up to $9.4 billion at the end of 2021. The foundation disbursed $160 million to nonprofits that year.[273] Reporting by The New York Times found that in 2022, the Musk Foundation gave away $230 million less than the minimum required by law to maintain tax-deductible status, and that in 2021 and 2022 over half the foundation's funds went to causes connected to Musk, his family, or his businesses.[274] In August 2013, Musk announced plans for a version of a vacuum tube train and assigned a dozen engineers from SpaceX and Tesla to establish the conceptual foundations and create initial designs.[275] Later that year, Musk unveiled the concept, which he dubbed the Hyperloop.[276] The alpha design for the system was published in a whitepaper posted to the Tesla and SpaceX blogs.[277] The document scoped out the technology and outlined a notional route where such a transport system could be built between the Greater Los Angeles Area and the San Francisco Bay Area, at an estimated cost of $6 billion.[278] The proposal, if technologically feasible at the costs cited, would make Hyperloop travel cheaper than any other mode of transport for such long distances.[279] Biographer Ashlee Vance noted that Musk hoped Hyperloop would \"make the public and legislators rethink the high-speed train\" proposal current in California at the time and consider more \"creative\" ideas.[280] In 2015, Musk announced a design competition for students and others to build Hyperloop pods, to operate on a SpaceX-sponsored mile-long track, for a 2015–2017 Hyperloop pod competition. The track was used in January 2017, and Musk also announced that the company had started a tunnel project, with Hawthorne Municipal Airport as its destination.[281] In July 2017, Musk said that he had received \"verbal government approval\" to build a Hyperloop from New York City to Washington, D.C., with stops in Philadelphia and Baltimore.[282] Mention of the projected DC-to-Baltimore leg was removed from The Boring Company website in 2021.[283] The tunnel project to Hawthorne was discontinued in 2022 and is planned to be converted into parking spots for SpaceX workers.[284] Mobility experts have criticized the Hyperloop concept for potential safety issues, planning complexity, low passenger capacity, and extremely high costs.[285][286] Jose Gomez-Ibanez, a professor of urban planning and public policy at Harvard, said, \"It gives me pause to think that otherwise intelligent people are buying into this kind of utopian vision.\"[287] In December 2015, Musk co-founded OpenAI, a not-for-profit artificial intelligence (AI) research company aiming to develop artificial general intelligence intended to be safe and beneficial to humanity.[288] A particular focus of the company was to democratize artificial superintelligence systems, against governments and corporations.[24] Musk pledged $1 billion of funding to OpenAI.[289] In 2023, Musk tweeted that he had ended up giving a total of $100 million to OpenAI. TechCrunch later reported that, according to its own investigation of public records, \"only $15 million\" of OpenAI's funding could be definitively traced to Musk. Musk subsequently stated that he had donated about $50 million.[290] In 2018, Musk left the OpenAI board to avoid possible future conflicts with his role as CEO of Tesla as Tesla increasingly became involved in AI through Tesla Autopilot.[291] Since then, OpenAI has made significant advances in machine learning, producing neural networks such as ChatGPT (producing human-like text),[292] and DALL-E (generating digital images from natural language descriptions).[293] On July 12, 2023, Elon Musk launched an artificial intelligence company called xAI, which aims to develop a generative AI program that competes with existing offerings like ChatGPT. The company hired engineers from Google and OpenAI.[294] Musk obtained funding from investors in SpaceX and Tesla.[295] On February 29, 2024, Musk sued OpenAI, its Chief Executive Sam Altman, and its President Greg Brockman. He accused the company of violating its founding agreement by prioritizing profits over AI safety.[296] In July 2018, Musk arranged for his employees to build a mini-submarine to assist the rescue of children trapped in a flooded cavern in Thailand.[297] Richard Stanton, leader of the international rescue diving team, encouraged Musk to facilitate the construction of the vehicle as a backup in case flooding worsened. However, Stanton concluded that the mini-submarine would not work and said that Musk's involvement \"distracted from the rescue effort\".[298] Engineers at SpaceX and The Boring Company built the mini-submarine from a Falcon 9 liquid oxygen transfer tube in eight hours and personally delivered it to Thailand.[299][300] Thai authorities ultimately declined to use the submarine, stating that it wasn't practical for the rescue mission.[297][301] In March 2019, Musk was one of the 187 people who received various honors conferred by the King of Thailand for involvement in the rescue effort.[302] Soon after the rescue, Vernon Unsworth, a British recreational caver who had been exploring the cave for the previous six years and played a key advisory role in the operation, criticized the submarine on CNN as amounting to nothing more than a public relations effort with no chance of success, maintaining that Musk \"had no conception of what the cave passage was like\" and \"can stick his submarine where it hurts\". Musk asserted on Twitter that the device would have worked and referred to Unsworth as a \"pedo guy\".[303] He then deleted the tweets,[303] apologized,[304] and deleted his responses to critical tweets from Cher Scarlett, a software engineer, which had caused his followers to harass her.[305] In an email to BuzzFeed News, Musk later called Unsworth a \"child rapist\" and said that he had married a child.[306][307] In September, Unsworth filed a defamation suit seeking $190 million in damages.[308][309][310] In his defense, Musk argued that, \"'pedo guy' was a common insult used in South Africa when I was growing up ... synonymous with 'creepy old man' and is used to insult a person's appearance and demeanor.\"[32] During the trial Musk apologized to Unsworth again for the tweet. In December 2019, the jury ruled that Musk was not liable.[311][312] In September 2018, Musk was interviewed on The Joe Rogan Experience podcast, during which he appeared to smoke a joint.[313] In 2022, Musk said that he and other SpaceX employees had subsequently been required to undergo random drug tests for about a year following the incident, as required by the Drug-Free Workplace Act of 1988 for Federal contractors.[314] In a 2019 60 Minutes interview, Musk had said, \"I do not smoke pot. As anybody who watched that podcast could tell, I have no idea how to smoke pot.\"[315] In March 2019, Musk, through his own label Emo G Records, released a rap track, \"RIP Harambe\", on SoundCloud.[316][317] The track refers to the killing of Harambe the gorilla and the subsequent Internet sensationalism surrounding the event.[318] The following year, Musk released an EDM track, \"Don't Doubt Ur Vibe\", featuring his own lyrics and vocals.[319] While Guardian critic Alexi Petridis described it as \"indistinguishable... from umpteen competent but unthrilling bits of bedroom electronica posted elsewhere on SoundCloud\",[320] TechCrunch said it was \"not a bad representation of the genre\".[319] Musk uses a private jet owned by Falcon Landing LLC, a SpaceX-linked company, and acquired a second jet in August 2020.[321][322] His heavy use of the jets—which flew over 150,000 miles in 2018 alone—and the consequent fossil fuel usage has received criticism.[321][323] Musk's flight usage is tracked on social media through ElonJet. After Musk said that his son X AE A-XII had been harassed by a stalker after the account posted the airport at which his jet had landed,[324][325][326] Musk banned the ElonJet account on Twitter, as well as the accounts of journalists that posted stories regarding the incident, including Donie O'Sullivan, Keith Olbermann, and journalists from The New York Times, The Washington Post, CNN, and The Intercept.[327] Musk equated the reporting to doxxing.[328] Police do not believe there is a link between the account and alleged stalker.[329] Musk later took a Twitter poll on whether the journalists' accounts should be reinstated, which resulted in reinstating the accounts.[330] After 2020, thousands of acres of land just outside Austin, Texas, were acquired by Musk and his companies with a total value of $2.5 billion.[331][332] The project to build the company town named Snailbrook in Bastrop County, Texas began in 2021 according to reports by The Wall Street Journal.[333] Musk's then-girlfriend Grimes and Kanye West were involved in the planning.[333] The name \"Snailbrook\" alludes to The Boring Company's stated goal of building a machine that can bore tunnels faster than a snail can move.[333] In 2023 the town had a reported population of 12 people.[334] There are plans to establish a school and a university there.[331] Musk was first listed on the Forbes Billionaires List in 2012, with a net worth of $2 billion.[335] Defunct Newspapers Journals TV channels Websites Other Economics Gun rights Identity politics Nativist Religion Watchdog groups Youth/student groups Miscellaneous Other Musk credits science fiction writers, particularly Robert A. Heinlein, for inspiring many of his personal views and business ventures, including SpaceX, Grok, and his libertarian inclinations.[336][337] Since joining Twitter (now known as X) in 2009,[338] Musk has been an active user and has over 163 million followers as of November 2023[update].[339] He posts memes, promotes business interests, and comments on contemporary political and cultural issues.[340] Musk's statements have provoked controversy, such as for mocking preferred gender pronouns[341][342] and comparing Canadian prime minister Justin Trudeau to Adolf Hitler.[343] The New York Times describes his contributions to international relations as \"chaotic\", and critics of Musk argue that there is a lack of separation between his opinions and his business interests.[344] As CEO of Twitter, Musk emerged as a source of misinformation and right-wing conspiracy theories, for example by suggesting online details about mass murderer Mauricio Garcia's apparent interest in Nazism could have been planted as part of a psyop.[345] Allegations of him being transphobic appeared as well in response to actions taken by Twitter under his guidance.[346][347] Musk said that the US government should not provide subsidies to companies, but impose a carbon tax to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.[348][349] The free market, in his view, would achieve the best solution, and producing environmentally unfriendly vehicles should have consequences.[350] Tesla has received billions of dollars in subsidies.[351] As of February 2024, Tesla has made $9 billion from government-initiated systems of zero-emissions credits.[352] Tax credits offered in California, at the United States federal level, and by other governments have enabled Tesla's battery electric vehicles to be price-competitive in comparison with internal combustion engine vehicles and facilitated initial consumer adoption of Tesla vehicles.[353] Musk, a longtime opponent of short-selling, has repeatedly criticized the practice and argued it should be illegal.[354][355] Wired magazine speculated that Musk's opposition to short-selling stems from how short sellers have an incentive to find and promote unfavorable information about his companies.[356] In early 2021, he encouraged the GameStop short squeeze.[357][358] In December 2022, Musk sold $3.6 billion of his stock in Tesla, equal to 22 million shares in the company,[359] despite pledging earlier in the year that he would not sell any additional shares.[360] Musk has promoted cryptocurrencies and supports them over traditional government-issued fiat currencies.[361] Given the influence of Musk's tweets in moving cryptocurrency markets,[362] his statements about cryptocurrencies have been viewed as market manipulation by some, such as economist Nouriel Roubini.[363] Musk's social media praising of Bitcoin and Dogecoin was credited for increasing their prices. Consequently, Tesla's 2021 announcement, against the backdrop of Musk's social media behavior, that it bought $1.5 billion worth of Bitcoin, raised questions.[364] Tesla's announcement that it would accept Bitcoin for payment was criticized by environmentalists and investors, due to the environmental impact of cryptocurrency mining. A few months later, in response to the criticism, Musk announced on Twitter that Tesla would no longer accept payments in Bitcoin and would not engage in any Bitcoin transactions until the environmental issues are solved.[365][366] Despite The Boring Company's involvement in building mass transit infrastructure, Musk has criticized public transport and promoted individualized transport (private vehicles).[367][368][369] His comments have been called \"elitist\" and have sparked widespread criticism from both transportation and urban planning experts, who have pointed out that public transportation in dense urban areas is more economical, more energy efficient, and requires much less space than private cars.[368][370][369] Musk has been described as believing in longtermism, emphasizing the needs of future populations.[371] Accordingly, Musk has stated that artificial intelligence poses the greatest existential threat to humanity.[372][373] He has warned of a \"Terminator-like\" AI apocalypse and suggested that the government should regulate its safe development.[374][375] In 2015, Musk was a cosignatory, along with Stephen Hawking and hundreds of others, of the Open Letter on Artificial Intelligence, which called for the ban of autonomous weapons.[376] Musk's AI stances have been called alarmist and sensationalist by critics such as computer scientist Yann LeCun and Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg,[377][378] and led the think tank Information Technology and Innovation Foundation to award Musk its Annual Luddite Award in 2016.[379] Musk has described climate change as the greatest threat to humanity after AI,[380] and has advocated for a carbon tax.[381] Musk was a critic of President Donald Trump's stance on climate change,[382][383] and resigned from two presidential business advisory councils following Trump's 2017 decision to withdraw the United States from the Paris Agreement.[384] In 2021, Musk donated $100 million to fund a competition for new carbon removal ideas.[385] However, Musk's lifestyle has been criticized for high greenhouse gas emissions,[386] and SpaceX has been found violating environmental regulations by repeatedly polluting waters in Texas.[387][388] In an interview with Trump in August 2024, in the lead-up to the 2024 United States presidential election, Musk tried to educate Trump on climate change,[389] supporting solar and nuclear energy,[390] but chose not to challenge Trump's dismissive remarks on the issue.[391][392] In the same interview, Musk stated that the economy would collapse without oil and gas, repeating previous statements that it was wrong to \"vilify\" the oil and gas industries.[390][393][394][395] Musk has long promoted the colonization of Mars and argues that humanity should become a \"multiplanetary species\".[396] He has suggested the use of nuclear weapons to terraform Mars.[397][398] He envisioned establishing a direct democracy on Mars, with a system in which more votes would be required to create laws than remove them.[399] Musk has also voiced concerns about human population decline,[400][401] saying that, \"Mars has zero human population. We need a lot of people to become a multiplanet civilization.\"[402] Speaking at The Wall Street Journal's CEO Council session in 2021, Musk claimed that the supposedly declining birth rate, and consequent population decline, is one of the biggest risks to human civilization.[403] According to anonymous sources inside SpaceX speaking with The New York Times, Musk has repeatedly volunteered his sperm to help colonize Mars.[404] He denied the claim.[405] By early 2024, Musk had become a vocal and financial supporter of Donald Trump.[406] By October 2024, he was Trump's second-largest individual 2024 presidential campaign donor.[407] Musk's views are generally described as right-wing and conservative.[408][409][410][411][412] While previously considered relatively apolitical and moderate, he has since shifted to the right and become more vocal about his views, notably since acquiring Twitter in 2022.[413] He is an outlier among social media executives who typically avoid partisan political advocacy. Musk has shared far-right misinformation[414][415][416] and numerous conspiracy theories.[417][418] Despite this, Musk still describes himself as politically moderate, rejecting the conservative label.[419] Musk was a registered independent voter when he lived in California. Historically, he has donated to both Democrats and Republicans.[420] many of whom are in states in which he has a vested interest.[421] Beginning in the late 2010s, his political contributions have shifted almost entirely to supporting Republicans.[422] Musk voted for Hillary Clinton in the 2016 US presidential election.[423] In the 2020 Democratic Party presidential primaries, Musk endorsed candidate Andrew Yang and expressed support for his proposed universal basic income.[424] He also endorsed Kanye West's 2020 presidential campaign.[425] He said he voted for Joe Biden in the 2020 US presidential election.[426] In May 2022, Musk said that he could \"no longer support\" the Democrats because they are the \"party of division & hate\",[427][428] and wrote a tweet encouraging \"independent-minded voters\" to vote Republican in the 2022 US elections.[429][430] That fall he gave over $50 million to Citizens for Sanity, a conservative political action committee that ran advertisements in swing states attacking Democrats on issues such as transgender care and illegal immigration.[431] He has supported Republican Ron DeSantis for the 2024 US presidential election, giving $10 million to the campaign in 2023,[431] and hosted DeSantis's campaign announcement on a Twitter Spaces event.[432][433][434] In August 2023, Musk suggested Republican presidential candidate Vivek Ramaswamy should be the vice presidential candidate on the Republican ticket.[435] After the attempted assassination of Donald Trump, Musk wished Trump a speedy recovery and endorsed him for president.[436][437] In a July 2024 post on X, Musk shared a deepfake video of Vice President Kamala Harris, Trump's opponent in the 2024 presidential election, which appeared to show Harris saying she was the \"ultimate diversity hire\" and did not know how to manage the United States.[438] Musk wrote that the video was \"amazing\" and did not reveal that it was edited, despite X prohibiting \"synthetic, manipulated\" content \"that may deceive\".[438] In August 2024, Musk and Trump spoke for over two hours on a livestream on X, in which Musk suggested that Trump create a government efficiency commission which he offered to serve on.[439] Trump said he would \"love\" to have Musk involved and later said he needed Musk's help to eliminate the Department of Education.[439] On September 15, 2024, after the second assassination attempt on Donald Trump, Musk wrote on X that it was odd that nobody had tried to kill Biden or Kamala Harris. He then deleted the post following widespread condemnation.[440] On September 19, the United States Secret Service announced that the agency was probing the post.[441] In October 2024, Musk joined Trump on stage at a campaign rally.[442] He has used his X account in support of Trump to repeatedly push falsehoods about immigration and voter fraud.[443][444] After becoming president-elect, Trump announced that Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy would advise a new Department of Government Efficiency.[445] Musk opposes a \"billionaire tax\",[446] and has argued on Twitter with more left-leaning Democratic politicians such as Bernie Sanders,[447][448] Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez,[449] and Elizabeth Warren.[450] He has raised questions about the Black Lives Matter protests, partially based on the fact that the phrase \"Hands up, don't shoot\" was made up.[451][452] Musk promoted a baseless theory relating to the attack of Speaker Nancy Pelosi's husband, but Musk deleted his tweet.[453] He also used X to spread disinformation and \"election conspiracy theories\" about the Federal Emergency Management Agency's relief efforts for Hurricane Helene.[454] Musk repeatedly used his platform on X to promote the claim that Democrats had been \"importing\" immigrants to vote for them. Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger requested that X remove a fabricated video purporting to show a Haitian immigrant who had voted multiple times. Musk complied, but the video had already gone viral.[455] In July 2024, Bloomberg reported that Musk donated an unknown sum to the pro-Donald Trump America PAC, a super PAC;[456] in a later interview, Musk clarified that he created America PAC.[457] In October 2024, a Federal Election Commission filing showed that Musk contributed almost $75 million to his America PAC during the previous three months, and during that time, the PAC spent approximately $72 million to support Trump's campaign.[458][459] In October 2024, Musk promoted a sweepstakes conducted by his America PAC, offering to pay $1 million per day to randomly selected registered voters in battleground states who signed a petition pledging support of the First and Second Amendments. Within days the U.S. Justice Department wrote America PAC warning that the sweepstakes might be illegal. Compensating people to register to vote violates federal law, and although registering to vote was not a condition to signing the petition, some legal analysts said the sweepstakes might induce people to register in order to participate. Musk's defenders said signing the petition did not specifically induce people to register, although he had previously said registering voters was one of his goals in Pennsylvania and had begun describing prize winners as America PAC \"spokespeople\".[460][461] After receiving the Justice Department's warning, Musk awarded two people $1 million each.[462] On October 28, Philadelphia District Attorney Larry Krasner, sued Musk and America PAC.[463] Although Musk had originally said that the prize would be \"randomly\" awarded, his lawyer argued that recipients \"earn\" the money after being \"selected based on their suitability to serve as spokesperson for America PAC\". After an all-day hearing on November 4, the day before Election Day, the judge ruled that Musk could continue his daily giveaway.[464] Musk provided over $50 million in 2022 to fund Citizens for Sanity, a group created by former Trump senior advisor Steven Miller to finance $93 million in advertisements related to culture war issues. The New York Times and OpenSecrets reported in October 2024 that some of Musk's donations were routed through Building America's Future, a hub of a dark money network supporting Trump. Building America's Future created \"Progress 2028\", presented as the left's response to Project 2025, that promoted misinformation about the agenda of Democratic presidential candidate Kamala Harris. Musk has promoted the Fair Election Fund, which is heavily funded by Building America's Future, and offers rewards for evidence of election fraud. That group is heavily involved in America PAC, founded and funded exclusively by Musk.[465][466][467][468] In October 2024, OpenSecrets, a nonprofit organization that tracks and publishes data on campaign finance and lobbying, reported that Musk and other donors had reportedly funneled over $100 million into Building America's Future, a dark money network backing Donald Trump. This network operates Progress 2028, a campaign posing as a pro-Kamala Harris initiative but aimed at undermining her support by spreading divisive and misleading information.[469][470] Musk has praised China and has been described as having a close relationship with the Chinese government, allowing access to its markets for Tesla.[471] After Gigafactory Shanghai produced its first batch of vehicles, Musk thanked the Chinese government and Chinese people while criticizing the United States and its people.[472]: 207–208 In 2022, Musk wrote an article for China Cyberspace, the official publication of Cyberspace Administration of China, which enforces Internet censorship in China. His writing the article was described as conflicting with his advocacy for free speech.[473][474] Musk later advocated for Taiwan to become a \"special administrative zone\" of China which drew cross-party criticism from Taiwanese lawmakers.[475][476][477] In October 2022, Musk posted a Twitter poll and \"peace plan\" to resolve the Russian invasion of Ukraine by allowing Russia to keep the Crimea Peninsula, while Ukraine would adopt a neutral status and drop the bid to join NATO.[478][479] It was reported that Musk allegedly spoke with Russian president Vladimir Putin prior to the proposal, which Musk denied.[480][481][482] Musk has repeatedly expressed concern that a protracted war between Russia and Ukraine could lead to the use of nuclear weapons and the outbreak of World War III.[483][484][485][486] In a YouTube podcast interview on November 10, 2023, Musk criticized Israel's retaliatory actions in the Gaza Strip during the Israel–Hamas war, saying that Hamas \"wanted to commit the worst atrocities that they could in order to provoke the most aggressive response possible from Israel\". He added that, \"if you kill somebody's child in Gaza, you have made at least a few Hamas members who will die just to kill an Israeli.\"[487] On November 17, 2023, Musk announced a policy change on the X platform, stating that X users who use terms such as \"decolonization\" and \"from the river to the sea\", or similar expressions that \"necessarily imply genocide\" of the Jewish people in Israel, will be suspended.[488] Several weeks later, Musk traveled to Israel where he toured with Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu the kibbutz Kfar Aza, site of one of the worst atrocities during the 2023 Hamas-led attack on Israel. He described the experience as \"jarring\".[489] In August 2024, Musk criticized UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer amid the riots taking place in that country, saying, \"Shouldn't you be concerned about attacks on *all* communities?\".[490] Responding to a tweet with footage of the disorder that said the riots were due to the \"effects of mass migration and open borders\", Musk tweeted, \"Civil war is inevitable.\" His comments were condemned by Starmer's official spokesman. Musk had previously restored far-right UK activist Tommy Robinson's account (after Robinson had been banned under Twitter's previous owners) and interacted with him on the platform.[491][492][493][494] Musk went on to refer to Starmer as \"two-tier Keir\" and ask, \"Why aren't all communities protected in Britain?\".[495][496] Musk promoted a conspiracy theory that the UK government was planning to build detainment camps in the Falkland Islands to hold rioters.[497][498] In November 2024, he wrote that Britain was \"going full Stalin\" following the Labour government's decision to end the inheritance tax exemption on agricultural assets worth more than £1 million.[499] The Wall Street Journal reported in October 2024 that Musk had been in regular contact with Vladimir Putin, Sergey Kiriyenko, and other high ranking Russian government officials since late 2022, discussing personal topics, business and geopolitical matters. The Kremlin denied the report, stating Musk and Putin had spoken only once.[500][501] The Journal reported that in one instance Putin had asked Musk to avoid activating his Starlink satellite system over Taiwan, to appease Chinese president Xi Jinping, according to a former Russian intelligence officer briefed on the situation.[502] Bloomberg and others had also previously reported in July 2023 that communications between Taiwan and SpaceX had broken down over the ownership of Starlink's subsidiary in the country.[503][504] The communications with Putin were reported to be a closely held secret in government, given Musk's involvement in promoting the presidential candidacy of Donald Trump. One person said no alerts were raised by the US government, noting the dilemma of the government being dependent on Musk's technologies.[502] Democrat lawmakers and NASA administrator Bill Nelson stated that it should be investigated to find out if the report was accurate. \"We should investigate what Elon Musk is up to to make sure that it is not to the detriment of the national security of the United States\", elaborated Representative Adam Smith.[505] SpaceX officially responded via their X account stating, \"Starlink is not available [in Taiwan] because Taiwan has not given us a license to operate, and regulators declined to remove a requirement that a foreign entity own 51% of Starlink to operate there. SpaceX has not accepted such a condition for any market in which it operates.\"[506] In December 2024, it was reported that Elon Musk was planning to donate $100 million to Nigel Farage's Reform UK party ahead of the next UK election, aiming to help Farage become prime minister. Musk, may route the funds through X's UK branch to bypass donation laws.[507] US president-elect Donald Trump announced on November 12, 2024 that Musk would become an inaugural leader of the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), a governmental advisory body that will \"slash excess regulations [and] cut wasteful expenditures\". Vivek Ramaswamy would be tasked with leading the department alongside Musk.[508][509] The Israeli government and several media outlets accused Musk of sowing antisemitism due to his promotion of George Soros conspiracy theories,[510] although some Israeli officials defended Musk and denied that his criticism of Soros constituted antisemitism.[511] On November 15, 2023, Twitter user Charles Weber, who identifies as a Jewish conservative, posted a video from StopJewishHate.org condemning the phrase \"Hitler was right\"; Weber captioned the video: \"To the cowards hiding behind the anonymity of the internet and posting 'Hitler was right': You got something you want to say? Why don't you say it to our faces.\"[512][513] In response, a second user posted \"Okay. Jewish communities have been pushing the exact kind of dialectical hatred against whites that they claim to want people to stop using against them. I'm deeply disinterested in giving the tiniest shit now about western Jewish populations coming to the disturbing realization that those hordes of minorities that support flooding their country don't exactly like them too much. You want truth said to your face, there it is.\" To this second user, Musk replied, \"You have said the actual truth.\"[512][513] Musk further clarified that he doesn't believe that \"all Jewish communities\" hate white people, but specifically took aim at the Anti-Defamation League (ADL).[514] He added, \"You [sic] right that this does not extend to all Jewish communities, but it is also not just limited to ADL.\"[515] The first tweet was widely regarded as echoing white nationalist sentiments[516] and affirmed another antisemitic conspiracy theory that Jews push \"hatred against Whites\".[517][518] The following day, Musk made a tweet which critics regarded as supporting white pride.[519][520] Advertisers distanced themselves from his tweets.[521] At the DealBook Summit on November 29, 2023, after comments from Disney CEO Bob Iger explaining his decision to stop advertising on X after Musk's recent post, journalist Andrew Ross Sorkin questioned Musk about the withdrawal of advertisers. Musk responded, \"I hope they stop. Don't advertise\" and \"If somebody is going to try to blackmail me with advertising, blackmail me with money, go fuck yourself. Go fuck yourself. Is that clear? I hope it is\"; Musk singled out Iger, saying, \"Hey Bob, if you're in the audience.\"[522][523] Musk acknowledged to Sorkin that one of his tweets—the one affirming an antisemitic conspiracy theory—was a mistake, saying, \"I handed a loaded gun to those who hate me and to those who are antisemitic and for that I am quite sorry.\"[524] Musk described his tweet as \"one of the most foolish, if not the most foolish, thing I've done\".[525][526] In January 2024, Musk visited the Auschwitz concentration camp with European Jewish Association Chairman Rabbi, conservative political commentator Ben Shapiro and Holocaust survivor Gidon Lev.[527] He also spoke on a conference about rising antisemitism.[528] The New York Times described the trip as a part of an image \"rehabilitation tour\".[529] Musk was criticized for his public comments and conduct related to the COVID-19 pandemic.[530][531] He spread misinformation about the virus, including promoting a widely discredited paper on the benefits of chloroquine and claiming that COVID-19 death statistics were inflated.[532] In March 2020, Musk stated, \"The coronavirus panic is dumb.\"[533][534] In an email to Tesla employees, Musk referred to COVID-19 as a \"specific form of the common cold\" and predicted that confirmed COVID-19 cases would not exceed 0.1% of the US population.[530] On March 19, 2020, Musk predicted that there would be \"probably close to zero\" new cases in the US by end of April.[531] Politico labeled this statement one of \"the most audacious, confident, and spectacularly incorrect prognostications [of 2020]\".[535] Musk also falsely stated that children \"are essentially immune\" to COVID-19.[536][537] Musk condemned COVID-19 lockdowns and initially refused to close the Tesla Fremont Factory in March 2020, defying the local shelter-in-place order.[530][538][539] In May 2020, he reopened the Tesla factory, defying the local stay-at-home order,[540][541] and warned workers that they would be unpaid, and their unemployment benefits might be jeopardized, if they did not report to work.[541] In December 2022, Musk called for prosecution of former National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases director Anthony Fauci.[542][543] In March 2020, Musk promised that Tesla would make ventilators for COVID-19 patients if there were a shortage.[544] After figures such as New York City mayor Bill de Blasio responded to Musk's offer,[545] Musk offered to donate ventilators which Tesla would build or buy from a third party.[544] However, Musk ultimately purchased and donated BiPAP and CPAP machines rather than ventilators.[546][547] In September 2020, Musk stated that he would not get the COVID-19 vaccine, because he and his children were \"not at risk for COVID\".[548][549] Two months later, Musk contracted COVID-19 but suggested his COVID-19 rapid antigen test results were dubious, as he had been tested four times on the same device with the same nurse but had received equal numbers of positive and negative results.[550] Following this, a postdoctoral fellow at the Princess Margaret Cancer Centre in Toronto explained in a Tweet why this result does not undermine the value of the test, referring to Musk as \"Space Karen\", which then trended on Twitter.[550][551] In December 2021, Musk said that he and his eligible children had received the vaccine, saying that the science behind the COVID vaccines was \"unequivocal\" but expressing his opposition to COVID vaccine mandates.[552] Musk became a US citizen in 2002.[553] From the early 2000s until late 2020, Musk resided in California, where both Tesla and SpaceX were founded.[554] He then relocated to Austin, Texas, saying that California had become \"complacent\" about its economic success.[554][555][556] While hosting Saturday Night Live in 2021, Musk stated that he has Asperger syndrome, although he has never been medically diagnosed.[557][558] Musk trained in Brazilian jiu-jitsu while preparing for a proposed fight with Mark Zuckerberg.[559] In his leisure time, he plays video games including Quake, Diablo IV, Elden Ring, and Polytopia.[560][561] Musk has stated he uses doctor-prescribed ketamine for occasional depression and that he uses it \"once every other week\",[562] while The Wall Street Journal has repeatedly alleged he uses it and other drugs recreationally.[563][564][565] Musk has at least 12 children, one of whom is deceased.[1] He met his first wife, Canadian author Justine Wilson, while attending Queen's University in Ontario, Canada; they married in 2000.[566] In 2002, their first child died of sudden infant death syndrome at the age of 10 weeks.[567] After his death, the couple used in vitro fertilization (IVF) to continue their family;[568] they had twins in 2004 followed by triplets in 2006.[568] The couple divorced in 2008 and shared custody of their children.[569][570] In 2022, the elder twin officially changed her name to Vivian Jenna Wilson,[571] reflecting her gender identity as a trans woman and using her mother's surname because she no longer wished to be associated with Musk.[571] Musk blamed the estrangement of his daughter on what the Financial Times characterized as \"the supposed takeover of elite schools and universities by neo-Marxists\", and has said that her gender transition is primarily what sparked his drive to \"destroy the woke mind virus\".[572][573] In a July 2024 episode of Jordan Peterson's podcast, Musk said regarding Vivian that he had \"lost [his] son, essentially\" because of gender-affirming care. He commented: \"You know, they call it deadnaming for a reason. The reason it's called deadnaming is because your son is dead\", and went on to state that the eldest twin \"is dead, killed by the woke mind virus\".[574] Vivian responded publicly, criticizing Musk for lying about her and the circumstances of her transition; saying that Musk was \"cold\", \"quick to anger\", \"uncaring and narcissistic\", whose infrequent visits commonly involved him berating her for being feminine.[575] On November 7, 2024, in response to a news article about his daughter's reaction to Trump's win, Elon Musk wrote \"the woke mind virus killed my son.\"[576] In 2008, Musk began dating English actress Talulah Riley.[577] They married two years later at Dornoch Cathedral in Scotland.[578][579] In 2012, the couple divorced, before remarrying the following year.[580] After briefly filing for divorce in 2014,[580] Musk finalized a second divorce from Riley in 2016.[581] Musk then dated Amber Heard for several months in 2017;[582] he had reportedly been pursuing her since 2012.[583] In 2018, Musk and Canadian musician Grimes said that they were dating.[584] Grimes gave birth to their son in May 2020.[585][586] Musk and Grimes originally gave the baby the name \"X Æ A-12\", which would have violated California regulations as it contained characters that are not in the modern English alphabet,[587][588] which they then changed to \"X Æ A-Xii\".[589][590] They have received criticism for choosing such an impractical and difficult to pronounce name.[591] In December 2021, Grimes and Musk had a second child, a daughter born via surrogacy.[592] Despite the pregnancy, Musk confirmed reports that the couple were \"semi-separated\" in September 2021; in an interview with Time in December 2021, he said he was single.[593][594] In March 2022, Grimes said of her relationship with Musk: \"I would probably refer to him as my boyfriend, but we're very fluid.\"[592] Later that month, Grimes tweeted that she and Musk had broken up again.[595] In September 2023 it was reported that the pair had a third child, a son.[596] In October 2023, Grimes sued Musk over parental rights and custody of their eldest son.[597][598][599] In July 2022, Insider published court documents revealing that Musk had twins via IVF with Shivon Zilis, director of operations and special projects at Neuralink, in November 2021.[600] They were born weeks before Musk and Grimes had their second child via surrogate in December. The news \"raise[d] questions about workplace ethics\", given that Zilis directly reported to Musk.[601] Their third child together was born in early 2024 via surrogacy.[602][1] Also in July 2022, The Wall Street Journal reported that Musk allegedly had an affair with Nicole Shanahan, the wife of Google co-founder Sergey Brin, in 2021, leading to their divorce the following year.[603] Musk denied the report.[604] Musk also had a relationship with Australian actress Natasha Bassett, who has been described as \"an occasional girlfriend\".[605] In October 2024, The New York Times reported Musk bought a Texas compound for his children and the mothers of his children.[606] In May 2022, Business Insider cited an anonymous friend of an unnamed SpaceX contract flight attendant, alleging that Musk engaged in sexual misconduct in 2016. The source stated that in November 2018, Musk, SpaceX, and the former flight attendant entered into a severance agreement granting the attendant a $250,000 payment in exchange for a promise not to sue over the claims.[607] Musk responded, \"If I were inclined to engage in sexual harassment, this is unlikely to be the first time in my entire 30-year career that it comes to light.\" He accused the article from Business Insider of being a \"politically motivated hit piece\".[608][609] After the release of the article, Tesla's stock fell by more than 6%,[610] and Barron's wrote, \"...some investors considered key-man risk – the danger that a company could be badly hurt by the loss of one individual.\"[611] In April 2023, the government of the U.S. Virgin Islands sought to subpoena Musk for documents in a lawsuit alleging that JPMorgan Chase profited from Jeffrey Epstein's sex trafficking operation.[612] The efforts to subpoena Musk for documents do not implicate him in any wrongdoing and do not seek to have Musk testify under oath.[612] Musk's former girlfriend Grimes filed a parental relationship petition in late September 2023 as part of a custody dispute. The petition came a month after Grimes openly accused him in a social media post of blocking her access to the youngest of their three children.[613][614] On July 27, 2024, Grimes' mother accused Musk of withholding the passports of her grandchildren.[615] Ben Brody, a 22-year-old Los Angeles-based college graduate, initiated a defamation lawsuit in October 2023 against Musk for over $1 million. He alleged Musk had falsely identified him as a participant \"in a violent street brawl on behalf of a neo-Nazi extremist group\" near Portland, Oregon.[616][617][618] According to Brody's complaint, one of Musk's X posts promoted conspiracy theories that \"Ben Brody's alleged participation in the extremist brawl meant the incident was probably a 'false flag' operation to deceive the American public\".[616] The complaint also alleged that Musk's accusations led to Brody and his family being subjected to harassment and threats.[616][617][619] In February 2024, Musk was ordered to testify in a deposition for the lawsuit.[620] In the deposition, Musk denied knowing who was suing him and admitted to doing no research on whether his claims were true. Musk attempted to keep the deposition from being made public.[621][622] In October 2023, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) sued Musk over his refusal to testify a third time in an investigation into whether he violated federal law by purchasing Twitter stock in 2022.[623][624][625] Musk claimed the SEC was harassing him.[623][625] In February 2024, Judge Laurel Beeler ruled that Musk must testify again.[626] In January 2024, Delaware Judge Kathaleen McCormick ruled in a 2018 lawsuit that Musk's $55 billion pay package from Tesla be rescinded.[627] McCormick called the compensation granted by the company's board \"an unfathomable sum\" that was unfair to shareholders. In response to the ruling, Musk posted on X: \"Never incorporate your company in the state of Delaware.\"[628] A re-ratification shareholders' vote passed in mid-June 2024, although much follow-up litigation is expected, including a lawsuit filed by a Tesla investor beforehand that alleged Musk employed \"coercive tactics\" to move the vote in his favor.[629] In June 2024, The Wall Street Journal reported Musk had a \"romantic relationship\" with a former intern at SpaceX, confirmed with affidavits supplied by the intern's lawyers who also represent Musk, and alleged that he had sexual relations with a woman who directly reported to him there. The article further alleges he also pursued sex with other SpaceX employees, and repeatedly asked an employee who reported directly to him to \"have his babies\".[630] In the same month, eight ex-employees, the same eight who were previously fired for penning an anti-Musk letter at SpaceX, filed a lawsuit against Musk alleging sexual harassment.[631] Also in June 2024, a former Twitter executive sued Musk for \"cheating\" him and other ousted executives out of $200 million in severance pay.[632] In August 2024, Musk sued advertisers for a boycott of X (formerly Twitter).[633][634][635] Later that month, Olympic boxer Imane Khelif filed a lawsuit for cyber harassment against X over alleged \"acts of aggravated cyber harassment\", in which Musk was named.[636] In October 2024, Musk and his America PAC were sued in Pennsylvania for allegedly operating an unlawful lottery before the 2024 US presidential election.[637] Musk's lawyer argued the giveaway wasn't a lottery since the recipients weren't chosen by chance, leading one prosecuting attorney to call the effort a \"scam\" designed to influence the election.[638] in November 2024, he was sued again regarding the lottery[639] and two US senators called for a probe into alleged contacts with Putin.[640] Although his ventures have been highly influential within their separate industries up to current day, Musk only became a public figure in the early 2010s. He has been described as an eccentric who makes spontaneous and impactful decisions, while also often making controversial statements, contrary to other billionaires who prefer reclusiveness to protect their businesses. Musk's actions and his expressed views have made him a polarizing figure.[641] Biographer Ashlee Vance described people's opinions of Musk as polarized due to his \"part philosopher, part troll\" role on Twitter.[642] Musk was a partial inspiration for the characterization of Tony Stark in the Marvel film Iron Man (2008).[643] Musk also had a cameo appearance in the film's 2010 sequel, Iron Man 2.[644] Musk has made cameos and appearances in other films such as Machete Kills (2013),[645] Why Him? (2016),[646] and Men in Black: International (2019).[647] Television series in which he has appeared include The Simpsons (\"The Musk Who Fell to Earth\", 2015),[648] The Big Bang Theory (\"The Platonic Permutation\", 2015),[649] South Park (\"Members Only\", 2016),[650][651] Young Sheldon (\"A Patch, a Modem, and a Zantac®\", 2017),[652] Rick and Morty (\"One Crew over the Crewcoo's Morty\", 2019),[653][654] and Saturday Night Live (2021).[655] He contributed interviews to the documentaries Racing Extinction (2015) and the Werner Herzog-directed Lo and Behold (2016).[656][657] Awards for his contributions to the development of the Falcon rockets include the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics George Low Transportation Award in 2008,[658] the Fédération Aéronautique Internationale Gold Space Medal in 2010,[659] and the Royal Aeronautical Society Gold Medal in 2012.[660] In 2015, he received an honorary doctorate in engineering and technology from Yale University[661] and an Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Honorary Membership.[662] Musk was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society (FRS) in 2018.[663] Time has listed Musk as one of the most influential people in the world on four occasions: in 2010,[664] 2013,[665] 2018,[666] and 2021.[667] Musk was selected as Time's \"Person of the Year\" for 2021. Then Time editor-in-chief Edward Felsenthal wrote that, \"Person of the Year is a marker of influence, and few individuals have had more influence than Musk on life on Earth, and potentially life off Earth too.\"[668][669] In February 2022, Musk was elected to the National Academy of Engineering.[670] In 2024, Musk’s Royal Society membership was criticized by 74 members over his alleged anti-scientific behavior and promotion of misinformation, prompting debates about the society’s standards on membership and leading to Dorothy Bishop, a renowned neuropsychologist at University of Oxford, to resign over her dissatisfaction with the Society's response.[671] Musk has been described as an American oligarch due to his extensive influence over public discourse, social media, industry, politics, and government policy.[672]",

December 11, 2024e-Paper Published - December 12, 2024 01:57 am IST - Washington U.S. President-elect Donald Trump and Elon Musk | Photo Credit: Reuters Tesla and SpaceX boss Elon Musk's net worth has surpassed $400 billion, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index, setting a new milestone on Wednesday (December 11, 2024) for the world's richest person. The jump in wealth, the business news outlet reported, came after SpaceX and its investors agreed to purchase as much as $1.25 billion of insider shares in a transaction that valued the rocket and satellite company at about $350 billion. Also read:Explained | Can Elon Musk’s wealth really end world hunger? The transaction increased Musk's personal wealth by about $50 billion to $440 billion, Bloomberg said. Musk's wealth, largely based on the share price of Tesla and the valuation of SpaceX, already took a huge leap after Donald Trump won last month's US presidential election. Tesla's share price is up by about 65% since the vote in November. Musk has been a prominent political donor and advocate for Trump, pumping a staggering $270 million into the Republican's campaign. He has been an ever-present sidekick for Trump since his election victory, inviting him to watch a rocket launch in Texas by his SpaceX company. Musk's businesses all have varying degrees of interactions with US and foreign governments, and his proximity to Trump has raised concerns that Musk will be able to give advantage to his own interests. Musk is also expected to secure a reduction in regulations for Tesla as well as elimination of tax credits on electric vehicles that will punish the car-maker's rivals. Trump has selected Musk to co-head the so-called Department of Government Efficiency, which is set to deliver billions of dollars of cuts in federal spending and slash government red tape.

                "title": "Michael Bublé - Wikipedia",
                "content": "Michael Steven Bublé OC OBC (IPA: /buːˈbleɪ/ boo-BLAY; born September 9, 1975[1]) is a Canadian singer and songwriter. Born in Burnaby, British Columbia, he is often credited for helping to renew public interest and appreciation for traditional pop standards and the Great American Songbook. Bublé has sold over 75 million records worldwide,[2] and won numerous awards, including five Grammy Awards[3] and fifteen Juno Awards.[4] In 2003, Bublé's first album reached the top ten in Canada and the United Kingdom. He found a worldwide audience with his 2005 album It's Time and his 2007 album Call Me Irresponsible – which reached number one on the Canadian Albums Chart, the UK Albums Chart, the US Billboard 200, the Australian ARIA Albums Chart and several European charts. His 2009 album Crazy Love debuted at number one on the US Billboard 200 after three days of sales, and remained there for two weeks. It was also his fourth number-one album on Billboard's Top Jazz Albums chart. His 2011 holiday album, Christmas, was in first place on the Billboard 200 for the final four weeks of 2011 and the first week of 2012, totalling five weeks atop the chart, it also made the top 5 in the United Kingdom. With this, Christmas became his third-consecutive number-one album on the chart. To Be Loved was released in April 2013, followed by Nobody but Me in October 2016 and Love in November 2018. Michael Steven Bublé was born in Burnaby, British Columbia, Canada,[5] on September 9, 1975, the son of Lewis Bublé, a fisherman,[6][7] and Amber (née Santaga), a homemaker.[8][9] Bublé's paternal and maternal great-grandparents immigrated to Canada from Italy.[10][11] His surname was originally spelled \"Bubli\", and some of his paternal ancestors came from Istria.[12][13][6] Bublé stated: \"[On the side of the family native to modern-day Croatia] some say we're Yugoslavian, others that we're Italian.\"[14] He has two younger sisters,[15] Brandee, a children's book author, and Crystal, an actress. He and his siblings were raised Roman Catholic. He attended Seaforth Elementary School and Cariboo Hill Secondary School.[16] According to an Oprah Winfrey interview on October 10, 2009, Bublé dreamed of becoming a famous singer since he was two. When he was a teenager, he slept with his Bible and prayed to become a singer.[17][18] His interest in jazz began at around age five when his family played Bing Crosby's White Christmas album.[19][20][21] His musical influences include Frank Sinatra,[22] Dean Martin,[23] Tony Bennett,[24] Elvis Presley, Bobby Darin[25] and Sam Cooke.[26] The first time his family noticed his singing talent was during the Christmas holidays, when Bublé was 13 years old, and they heard him powerfully sing the phrase \"May your days be merry and bright\" when the family was singing to the song \"White Christmas\" on a car ride.[17][27] Bublé also has a strong passion for ice hockey and wanted to become a professional hockey player for the Vancouver Canucks growing up, but believed he was not good enough.[28] \"I wanted so bad to be a hockey player... If I was any good at hockey, I probably wouldn't be singing right now.\"[29] He often played hockey in his youth, watched Vancouver Canucks games with his father, and said that he \"went to every single home game as a kid... I remember I wanted to be Gary Lupul, I wanted to be Patrik Sundstrom and Ivan Hlinka. I used to think that being named Michael Bublé was pretty cool because I was close to being called Jiri Bubla.\"[30] Bublé shared his hockey interest with his grandfather.[31] From the age of 14, Bublé spent six years working during the summer as a commercial fisherman with his father and crewmates.[32][33] He called the experience \"the most deadly physical work I'll ever know in my lifetime. We'd be gone for two, sometimes three months at a time and the experience of living and working among guys over twice my age taught me a lot about responsibility and what it means to be a man.\"[15] His first singing engagements were in nightclubs at age 16 and were facilitated by his Italian grandfather Demetrio Santagà,[34] a plumber from Preganziol, Treviso,[35] who offered his plumbing services in exchange for stage time for his grandson.[15] Bublé's grandfather paid for his singing lessons. Both his voice teacher, Sandi Siemens, and his maternal grandfather never stopped believing that he would become a star. Bublé's maternal grandmother, Iolanda (née Moscone),[36] was also Italian, from Carrufo, L'Aquila.[37][38] Bublé grew up listening to his grandfather's collection of jazz records and credits his grandfather in encouraging his love for jazz music. \"My grandfather was really my best friend growing up. He was the one who opened me up to a whole world of music that seemed to have been passed over by my generation. Although I like rock and roll and modern music, the first time my granddad played me the Mills Brothers, something magical happened. The lyrics were so romantic, so real, the way a song should be for me. It was like seeing my future flash before me. I wanted to be a singer and I knew that this was the music that I wanted to sing.\"[39] Bublé never stopped believing he would become a star but admitted he was probably the only one who believed in his dream, stating that even his maternal grandfather thought Bublé was going to be \"an opening act for somebody in Las Vegas\".[40] He stated he never learned to read and write music, using only emotion to drive his songwriting ability.[28][41][42] At age 18, Bublé entered a local talent contest and won, but was disqualified by organizer Bev Delich for being underage. Delich entered him in the Canadian Youth Talent Search. After Bublé won that contest, he asked Delich to be his manager. Delich represented him for the next seven years, during which Bublé worked diligently at any job that came along: clubs, conventions, cruise ships, hotel lounges, shopping malls, and talent shows.[27][33] In 1996, Bublé appeared in TV's Death Game (also known as Mortal Challenge) as a Drome Groupie. Also in 1996, he appeared (uncredited) in two episodes of The X-Files as a member of a submarine crew. His first national TV performance was on a 1997 award-winning Bravo! documentary titled Big Band Boom!, directed by Mark Glover Masterson. Beginning in 1997, he became a frequent guest on Vicki Gabereau's national talk show on the CTV network. During its first season, the Vancouver-based programme aired live, which ultimately worked in Bublé's favour. When a scheduled guest was forced to cancel, the show's music producer often asked Bublé to fill in at the last minute. The Gabereau appearances provided Bublé with great exposure, but they also helped the singer hone his television skills as a performer and as an interview guest. In a mutual show of gratitude, Bublé appeared on the final Gabereau show in 2005, along with Jann Arden and Elvis Costello.[43] Bublé received two Genie Award nominations for Best Original Song in 2000 for \"I've Never Been in Love Before\" and \"Dumb ol' Heart\", two songs he wrote for the film Here's to Life!.[44] He recorded three independent albums: First Dance (1996), Babalu (2001), and Dream (2002).[45][46] Michael McSweeney, an aide to former prime minister Brian Mulroney, saw Bublé's performance at a business party[47] and received a copy of Bublé's self-financed independent album. McSweeney showed the album to Mulroney and his wife. Bublé subsequently was invited to sing at the wedding of Mulroney's daughter, Caroline, where he sang Kurt Weill's \"Mack the Knife\".[47] At the wedding, Bublé was introduced to David Foster, a multiple Grammy Award-winning producer and record executive who previously had worked with artists such as Madonna, Brandy Norwood, Whitney Houston, Michael Jackson, Céline Dion, Barbra Streisand, Kenny G, Cher, Josh Groban, and Andrea Bocelli.[47][48] David Foster was reluctant to sign Bublé to his 143 Records label[49] because he \"didn't know how to market this kind of music\". Bublé moved to Los Angeles with his agent for a brief period to convince Foster to sign him. Eventually, Foster agreed to produce an album for him if he raised $500,000 to cover the costs of the production (which Bublé did). Foster ended up covering the costs of production under his label, with no assurances of support from Warner Brothers. Additionally, Bublé received the personal stamp of approval and support of Foster's friend, musician and songwriter Paul Anka. After David Foster agreed to produce Bublé's debut album, Bruce Allen, whom Bublé had pursued for years to be his manager, also signed Bublé.[49] Bublé appeared as a karaoke singer in Duets in 2000 and a club owner in Totally Blonde in 2001.[50] Bublé's self-titled debut album was released on February 11, 2003, by 143 Records/Reprise Records. The album features a range of standards from various eras including \"Fever\", \"The Way You Look Tonight\", \"For Once in My Life\", \"Moondance\" and \"You'll Never Find Another Love Like Mine\". Also on the album is \"How Can You Mend a Broken Heart?\", with Barry Gibb of the Bee Gees singing backing vocals. The album went to the top 10 in Canada, United Kingdom, South Africa and reached No. 1 in Australia. It was No. 33 on the ARIA Top 100 Albums of 2003.[51] Bublé appeared nationally on television in the United States on the Today program on February 14, 2003.[19] In November 2003, Bublé released a Christmas EP Let it Snow, containing five previously unreleased tracks, that peaked at 56 on the Billboard 200. The title track reached the top 40 of the Australia singles chart. A live DVD/CD called Come Fly with Me was released in early 2004.

The Junkie XL remix of the theme for the 1960s TV cartoon version of Spider-Man from Bublé's Babalu album was played during the closing credits of Spider-Man 2 (2004), and this version was also released as a single. A CD was released in 2003 of the 7 songs that Bublé sang for Totally Blonde, calling it Totally Bublé. Bublé collaborated with the Barenaked Ladies for \"Elf's Lament\", a song on their 2004 Christmas album Barenaked for the Holidays.[54] Bublé's second studio album, It's Time, was released on February 8, 2005, again by 143/Reprise Records. The album also included standards from a variety of eras including \"You Don't Know Me\", \"Feeling Good\", \"Can't Buy Me Love\", \"Save the Last Dance for Me\", \"Song for You\", and \"Quando, Quando, Quando\" (a duet with Canadian pop singer Nelly Furtado). It also included an original track, \"Home\", co-written by Bublé, his musical director Alan Chang, and Amy Foster-Gilles. The album reached No. 1 in Canada, Italy, Japan, and on the Billboard Top Jazz chart, No. 2 in Australia, and No. 7 on the Billboard 200. Additionally it reached the top 10 in the United Kingdom, Switzerland, Norway, Austria, and Sweden. The album spent 104 weeks on the Billboard Top Jazz chart, including a record-breaking 78 weeks in the No. 1 spot. It's Time was Billboard's Top Jazz Album in both 2005 and 2006.

However, the second single from the album, \"Home\", reached No. 1 on the Billboard Adult Contemporary Tracks chart and No. 72 on the Billboard Hot 100.[55] The third single \"Save the Last Dance for Me\" reached No. 5 on the Billboard AC Track Chart and No. 99 on the Billboard Hot 100.[55] In 2005, he appeared in a commercial for Starbucks' Frappucino line, singing his single \"Come Fly with Me\". The single appeared as a bonus track for a Starbucks edition release of It's Time.[56] He won four Juno Awards in 2006: Album of the Year and Pop Album of the Year (It's Time), Single of the Year (\"Home\"), and Artist of the Year.[57] He was nominated twice for a Grammy in the category Best Traditional Pop Vocal Album in 2006 (It's Time) and 2007 (Caught in the Act), but lost both times to Tony Bennett. In 2007, Bublé received one Juno nomination, for Fan Choice, but lost to Nelly Furtado.[58] Bublé's third studio album, Call Me Irresponsible, was released on May 1, 2007, by 143/Reprise Records. His third effort included songs from different eras such as \"Always on My Mind\", \"Dream\", \"I've Got the World on a String\", and \"Comin' Home Baby\" (a duet with Boyz II Men). In the US, the album debuted at number two on the Billboard 200 and rose to number one in its second week.[59] His fourth studio album, Crazy Love, was set to be released by 143/Reprise Records on October 13, 2009.[60] However, an early release in the United States happened on October 9, 2009,[61] in which Bublé appeared on Oprah that same day and performed the album's first single \"Haven't Met You Yet\". The album was also promoted in an interview with George Stroumboulopoulos on The Hour on October 17, 2009,[62] and on the December 22, 2009 episode of The Glenn Beck Program.[63] This album contains 12 tracks (and one bonus track), including two original songs co-written by Bublé, \"Haven't Met You Yet\" and \"Hold On\".[64] Its first single, \"Haven't Met You Yet\", was released August 31, 2009, and reached No. 1 on Billboard's Canadian Adult Contemporary chart.[65] Most of the tracks off the album were recorded live because Bublé did not want his album to sound overproduced and slick.[66] Bublé wrote the opening part for his cover on the single \"Cry Me a River\" in Bond-like theme because he wanted the song to sound very cinematic and bombastic.[67] Crazy Love debuted at No. 1 on the Billboard 200 chart,[68] becoming Bublé's fourth No. 1 album on Billboard's Top Jazz Albums chart. It also debuted at No. 1 in Australia and Canada, where it became his fastest-selling album. The album was supported by the Crazy Love Tour. During the tour, Bublé performed two nights at the new Aviva Stadium in Dublin, Ireland, which were the first concerts to take place at the venue.[69] On April 18, 2010, Bublé won four Juno Awards for Juno Fan Choice Award, Single of the Year (\"Haven't Met You Yet\"), Album of the Year (Crazy Love) and Pop Album of the Year (Crazy Love),[57] plus two Juno nominations for Artist of the Year and Songwriter of the Year.

                "content": "Profile Sections Local tv Featured More From NBC Follow NBC News news Alerts There are no new alerts at this time At least eight buildings have been destroyed and seven others have been damaged in Malibu, California, as a result of the wind-whipped wildfire that has roared through the area. The Franklin Fire had grown to nearly 4,000 acres Wednesday afternoon with 7% containment, after it grew 600 acres Wednesday morning, the city of Malibu said in an update. No deaths or injuries have been linked to the fire. The blaze, which broke out Monday night local time, has prompted authorities to issue evacuation orders to around 20,000 people in Los Angeles County. However, conditions were beginning to improve Wednesday, offering a respite and an opportunity to firefighters. “Yesterday, around the Franklin Fire, we had gusts in the 35 to 50 mph range. Now, they’re down to the 10 to 20 mph range,” said Ryan Kittell, a National Weather Service meteorologist based in Oxnard. He added that a weakening cold front was moving into the region with the potential to bring some light rain Thursday. But Kittell said he expects more humid onshore winds from the Pacific Ocean on Thursday, as well, which could stir embers. \"Humidities will still be elevated, but wind kind of trumps everything,\" Kittell said. \"It's something to keep aware of.\" Los Angeles County Fire Chief Anthony Marrone said at a news conference Wednesday morning that a containment line was set Tuesday night. “The weather has changed significantly, so we did take advantage of those higher relative humidities and the lower temperatures and the decreased winds last night. ... We’re going in the right direction,” he said. The cause of the fire is unknown and remains under investigation. Evacuees from Malibu include several famous figures who live in the sought-after beachside community. Actor Dick Van Dyke, who turns 99 on Friday, wrote on Facebook that he and his wife, Arlene, escaped safely on Tuesday with their animals, except a cat named Bobo. Singer Cher also evacuated to a hotel Monday night with her pets, publicist Liz Rosenberg told The New York Times. Students at Pepperdine University in Malibu were instructed to shelter in place in the campus library and other buildings overnight Monday and Tuesday. \"We were supposed to be taking finals this week, and with the students that I talked to, we’d much rather be taking finals than living through this experience,\" Rachel Flynn, a Pepperdine senior, told NBC Los Angeles. \"Tonight, it’s on Dresher Hill, which is the opposite side of campus than it was last night,\" she said Tuesday. \"So that’s definitely concerning for me, because that’s where my dorm is located. That’s where my car is parked. I’m watching the flames expand and grow.\" Flynn said some students put couches together as makeshift beds. Michael Friel, director of communications at Pepperdine, said the sheltering students had food, water and power to charge their phones. The university said early Wednesday on social media that fire activity surrounding the college had “greatly diminished as the Franklin Fire has burned through most of the fuel immediately surrounding campus.” Early Wednesday, the fire stretched across roughly 4.5 miles, from the Santa Monica Mountains Recreation Area in the east to central Malibu and large beachside properties. More than 1,400 households are in the affected area. More than 1,500 firefighters and multiple agencies were tackling the blaze Wednesday. “Fire can be extremely unpredictable, and we highly encourage residents in the fire areas to be prepared, have a plan and heed our evacuation warnings and orders,” Los Angeles County Sheriff's Capt. Jennifer Seetoo said at a news conference Tuesday night. She added that deputies would be available to patrol the areas around evacuated homes — some of which are owned by famous and wealthy residents. \"We will not tolerate anyone coming to this community to re-victimize our community members,\" she said. A mandatory evacuation order is in effect for areas east of Latino Canyon, west of Topanga Beach Driveway and south of Baller Motorway, including the Big Rock and Las Flores communities. All Malibu schools were closed Wednesday and will remain so Thursday, but they are expected to open Friday. A combination of winds exceeding 60 mph and dry undergrowth has created the perfect conditions for fire in parts of Southern California. Red flag warnings covered 12 million people Tuesday and Wednesday. The warnings are set to remain through 6 p.m. local time for most valleys and mountains of Los Angeles and Ventura counties, according to the National Weather Service office in Los Angeles. Fall wildfires in California are often driven by the famous Santa Ana winds, which travel down mountain slopes and bring relatively hot, dry air to coastal areas. The winds occur when areas of high pressure in the desert and the Great Basin region travel west, pushing over the mountains and toward the coast. The systems typically drive humidity levels down, and they can rapidly push any fires that start, particularly when the landscape is dry and hasn't had substantial rain. \"We get Santa Ana winds really through October to March. But as we get deeper into our winter season when we should start getting rain, the fire weather will decrease as the plants get wet,\" Kittell said. \"Sometimes we get our first major storm — which we haven’t had yet — as early as November or as late as January or February. Sometimes, we don’t get it at all.\" Patrick Smith is a London-based editor and reporter for NBC News Digital. Marlene Lenthang is a breaking news reporter for NBC News Digital.

                "title": "\n    Franklin Fire in Malibu scorches 4,000 acres, thousands remain evacuated - CBS Los Angeles",
                "content": "Watch CBS News By Dean Fioresi, Chelsea Hylton, Julie Sharp, Matthew Rodriguez Updated on: December 11, 2024 / 6:06 PM PST / KCAL News The Franklin Fire in Malibu shifted directions overnight and continues to burn Wednesday as it reaches 4,031 acres and is 7% contained. Thousands of households remain under evacuation orders. In a Wednesday morning news conference, Los Angeles County Fire Department Chief Anthony Marrone said the fire increased in size overnight by 39%, most significantly on the western edge. He said flames began backing down into Corral Canyon, threatening the Malibu RV Park community. \"Structure threats were mitigated and additional structures were damaged,\" he said. \"Fire activity increased significantly on the west side as it crossed Puerco Canyon Ridge and began backing down into Corral Canyon due to the winds and steep terrain,\" Cal Fire wrote on its website. Overall, the Franklin Fire destroyed nine structures and damaged six. Morrone said Wednesday's weather conditions, including strong winds and low humidity \"will be closely monitored today as they will play a critical role in fire behavior.\" The California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection, or Cal Fire, said firefighters are aggressively working to control the fire along the perimeter and to protect structures. \"The deep and rugged terrain, along with the strong winds and low humidity, continue to pose challenges for firefighters,\" the agency said Wednesday morning. While the Malibu coast was expected to remain under a red flag warning into Wednesday afternoon, with weather conditions increasing the risk of fire growth, the National Weather Service office for Los Angeles had no warnings in place for Southern California as of 2:30 p.m. There had also been warnings for the Santa Monica Mountains as well as the Ventura County coastline, valleys and mountains which were no longer in effect by Wednesday afternoon. The massive blaze was first reported a little after 10:50 p.m. Monday near South Malibu Canyon Road and Station Boundary, just south of the Piuma area, according to the Los Angeles County Fire Department. Around 4:40 p.m. Tuesday, it was estimated to be over 3,000 acres by Cal Fire. The state agency said the wildfire stood at 4,031 acres Wednesday afternoon. Los Angeles County Sheriff Robert Luna said Wednesday there are about 19,982 people and 7,560 structures in the affected area. Of the 7,560 structures, there are approximately 12,600 people under evacuation orders. About 7,382 people are under evacuation warnings. \"As of info we have now, there are no reports of significant injuries or deaths and that is a huge victory -- and that is because of this work being done,\" Luna said. LAFD Chief Marrone said what started out as a 5-acre blaze on Malibu Canyon Road was quickly spread by Santa Ana winds. The flames rapidly spread towards Pepperdine University overnight. By 3 a.m., the Franklin Fire spread south across Pacific Coast Highway to Malibu Road, near Webb Way. It moved toward the Malibu Pier area and threatened some nearby structures along Malibu Knolls Road and the Sweetwater Mesa area. Matt Myerhoff, a spokesperson for the city of Malibu, said early Tuesday morning that the pier is safe. \"I think the preponderance of structures being impacted around here are going to be homes,\" he said. \"We remain under immediate threat because of the Red Flag conditions,\" Myerhoff said. \"We would like to get some containment by this afternoon.\" By Wednesday, the flames had completely shifted direction from burning to the east and north to marching to the west. \"Containment lines were improved with fire retardant drops and construction of new hand lines to connect the gaps along the rugged eastern edge of the fire,\" Marrone said. Gov. Gavin Newsom announced Tuesday that the state secured a Fire Management Assistance Grant from FEMA to ensure resources are available to help fight the blaze. Arson investigators are looking into the cause of the fire. RELATED: What is defensible space and how to protect your home from wildfires Los Angeles County Sheriff Robert Luna provided the following evacuation update Wednesday morning: Evacuation warnings -- south of Mulholland Highway, north of Pacific Coast Highway, east of Trancas, and west of Crestline. Residents in these areas should remain ready to evacuate if conditions worsen. Evacuation orders -- south of Piuma road, east of Corral Canyon, and west of Big Rock. More information on evacuations is available on the Malibu city website. A list of shelters for displaced residents and animals: Malibu city officials established an emergency station at Zuma Beach, to help impacted residents with updates, food, water and first aid. Officials closed the Pacific Palisades Recreation Center off Alma Real Drive. \"The way evacuations are conducted by the Sheriff's department is they go door to door. They drive up and down the streets with a blowhorn and they knock on every single door. They wake people up and get them out of their houses,\" Myerhoff said. He said using lessons learned from the 2018 Woolsey Fire, first responders are communicating by way of LA-RICS radios that the city purchased, as power outages affect cell phone service and all other forms of communication. \"We are safe. All retreats evacuated safely,\" the Serra Retreat said. \"Looks like the fire is on the retreat center property but there are several fire trucks there. Hopefully, they can contain it. \" A resident named Linda said her boss' house was destroyed while she was trying to evacuate horses. \"It's happening so quickly,\" she said. \"I'm worried about two horses that I left in there. I know the house is gone. I went back in there to find the two horses but it was too dangerous.\" Malibu City Hall, parks, and facilities were closed Tuesday, with all programs and meetings suspended, according to the city of Malibu. Below is a real-time map outlining evacuation orders and warnings. A temporary evacuation center was opened as the Palisades Recreation Center, located at 851 Alma Real Drive. Large animals could be taken to Pierce College in Winnetka. There is no estimated time for when many of the roads will reopen. Traffic signals are out in areas experiencing power outages. The following closures remain in place as of Wednesday morning: \"Stay away from the Malibu area, if you can, at all costs,\" Deputy Tracy Koerner said. Pepperdine school officials continue to closely monitor the fire since it first ignited Monday night. Officials first released the statement that the fire was not affecting the university campus, but that \"The Malibu Campus and local area may experience some power outages related to this incident.\" However, at 1:10 a.m. on Tuesday, the fire continued to crawl closer and closer to the university, forcing the administration to issue a shelter-in-place order. Since then the university has reinstated and lifted shelter-in-place orders as fire conditions have fluctuated in the area. Shortly after 8 a.m., the power was restored on campus. The initial shelter-in-place order instructed students and residents to gather in two central locations on campus. Several students were preparing for final exams when they received notifications from school officials. \"All community members on the Malibu campus are directed to shelter in place in the Tyler Campus Center or Payson Library,\" the administration posted on X. \"Despite any evacuation orders from Malibu city or surrounding areas, the University community should follow University instructions.\" The administration stated that their \"protocol is approved by LA County Fire and executed with their cooperation.\" All classes and finals have been canceled for the remainder of the week. The worst of the fire pushed past Pepperdine by 3:30 a.m. on Tuesday, but hotspots continued to linger around the campus. Classes and final exams have been canceled for the remainder of the week. The Santa Monica-Malibu Unified School District announced that all Malibu schools are closed until Dec. 12. The closures will affect Webster Elementary, Malibu Elementary, Malibu Middle and Malibu High School. All of the Santa Monica schools will remain open. \"At this time, many Webster families are under evacuation orders, and several families in other Malibu neighborhoods are under evacuation watch due to the Franklin Fire. Our district's Emergency Operations Center (EOC) is closely monitoring the situation, and we are prepared to respond as conditions evolve,\" Superintendent, Dr. Antonio Shelton wrote in a community announcement. The Los Angeles Unified School District, with schools in the neighboring Topanga and Pacific Palisades area, said schools are open and they are \"closely monitoring the Franklin Fire and its potential impact on our communities.\" Southern California Edison reported on Wednesday there were 9,269 customers in Los Angeles County without power due to public safety power shutoffs. Another 6,910 customers in the county were under consideration for shutoffs. The city of Malibu said it has deployed changeable message signs, and backup generators to keep traffic signals on PCH operating. The city also advised that should the power go out, and because of spotty cell service, residents can monitor local AM and FM radio, and 99.1 FM KBUU for emergency information. Weather officials raised concerns over fire danger that would impact most of Southern California. Unusually low humidity paired with a powerful Santa Ana winds movement created dangerous conditions, which led them to issue a \"particularly dangerous situation red flag warning\" beginning Monday night and continuing until 6 p.m. Wednesday. In response, SoCal Edison warned tens of thousands of residents living throughout LA County that their service may be shut off if the winds intensify. Conditions are similar to the weather when the Mountain Fire erupted in Ventura County in early November. That blaze torched nearly 20,000 acres and destroyed more than 200 structures.

A fast-moving wildfire has scorched 4,000 acres in Malibu, forcing 20,000 residents to flee as flames advanced on homes, horse farms and Pepperdine University. The Franklin Fire, yet another late-year wildfire fanned by fierce Santa Ana winds, has left a trail of destruction as officials confirmed seven structures destroyed and nine damaged. The cause of the fire remains under investigation. Meteorologists warned that even though the strongest winds in the area have passed, high fire dangers have decreased. That should aid efforts to contain the fire. Evacuations have displaced thousands of residents, including celebrities such as Dick Van Dyke and Cher. Malibu mayor Doug Stewart called it a “traumatic 20 hours” for the city, as emergency operations relocated to Calabasas after the city hall was threatened. \"It burns, it grows back, and we're resilient,\" Stewart said. More than 1,500 firefighters are battling the blaze with many roads closed and others under security patrols. At Pepperdine University, 3,000 students sheltered in place as smoke and embers engulfed the campus. “Ash was everywhere, embers were everywhere,” said a student, Bethany Kronlund. Van Dyke confirmed he and his wife had ‘safely evacuated’ — but not without facing heartbreak A Malibu resident is speaking out after his home was destroyed in the Franklin Fire. “It’s pretty torched all around,” Lonnie Vidaurri, 53, told The Associated Press. His four-bedroom home was located in the Malibu Knolls neighborhood and was one of seven that had been destroyed. Vidaurri, his wife, and two young daughters evacuated to a hotel in Santa Monica. He expects that the family’s pet bunnies did not survive the fire, and that they lost most of their things. “My girls cried, obviously, but it could have been worse.” The 20-foot-tall wooden cross had previously been destroyed by the 2018 Woolsey Fire. It was later replaced by brothers of the Sigma Chi fraternity. They carried the cross in pieces up the hill in honor of Seaver College student Alaina Housley, who was killed in the shooting at the Thousand Oaks-based Borderline Bar and Grill. A red flag warning that was scheduled to extend into Wednesday afternoon has been canceled. Winds decreased earlier than expected, according to KTLA. Other red flag warnings that were scheduled to expire Wednesday evening also were canceled. A Malibu man is recalling the moment the Franklin Fire approached the city’s RV park. “You could see the fires rolling in, in over the canyon. It was like ‘Holy crap, this is real,’ ” Shawn Smith told The Associated Press. Smith was asleep when someone knocked on his mobile home to wake him up. A day, later, he returned to find that the RV park had been saved by firefighters. “We got lucky,” he said. Malibu’s Franklin Fire has now spread over more than 4,000 acres, according to Cal Fire. The 4,031-acre blaze is still 7 percent contained.

                "content": "The UEFA Champions League (abbreviated as UCL) is an annual club association football competition organised by the Union of European Football Associations (UEFA) that is contested by top-division European clubs. The competition begins with a round robin league phase to qualify for the double-legged knockout rounds, and a single-leg final. It is the most-watched club competition in the world and the third most-watched football competition overall, behind only the UEFA European Championship and the FIFA World Cup. It is one of the most prestigious football tournaments in the world and the most prestigious club competition in European football, played by the national league champions (and, for some nations, one or more runners-up) of their national associations. Introduced in 1955 as the Coupe des Clubs Champions Européens (French for European Champion Clubs' Cup), and commonly known as the European Cup, it was initially a straight knockout tournament open only to the champions of Europe's domestic leagues, with its winner reckoned as the European club champion. The competition took on its current name in 1992, adding a round-robin group stage in 1991 and allowing multiple entrants from certain countries since the 1997–98 season.[1] While only the winners of many of Europe's national leagues can enter the competition, the top 5 leagues by coefficient provide four teams each by default,[2] with a possibility for additional spots based on performance during the previous season.[3][4] Clubs that finish below the qualifying spots are eligible for the second-tier UEFA Europa League competition, and since 2021, for the third-tier UEFA Conference League.[5] In its present format, the Champions League begins in early July with three qualifying rounds and a play-off round, all played over two legs. The seven surviving teams enter the league phase, joining 29 teams qualified in advance. The 36 teams each play eight opponents, four home and four away. The 24 highest-ranked teams proceed to the knockout phase that culminates with the final match in late May or early June.[6] The winner of the Champions League automatically qualifies for the following year's Champions League, the UEFA Super Cup, the FIFA Intercontinental Cup and the FIFA Club World Cup.[7][8] Spanish clubs have the most victories (20 wins), followed by England (15 wins) and Italy (12 wins). England has the most winning teams, with six clubs having won the title. The competition has been won by 23 clubs and 13 of them have won it more than once.[9] Real Madrid is the most successful club in the tournament's history, having won it 15 times. Madrid is the only club to have won it five times in a row (the first five editions).[10] Only one club has won all of their matches in a single tournament en route to the tournament victory: Bayern Munich in the 2019–20 season.[11] Real Madrid is the current European champion, having beaten Borussia Dortmund 2–0 in the 2024 final for their fifteenth title. The first time the champions of two European leagues met was in what was nicknamed the 1895 World Championship, when English champions Sunderland beat Scottish champions Heart of Midlothian 5–3.[12] The first pan-European tournament was the Challenge Cup, a competition between clubs in the Austro-Hungarian Empire.[13] Three years later, in 1900, the champions of Belgium, Netherlands and Switzerland, which were the only existing leagues in continental Europe at the time, participated in the Coupe Van der Straeten Ponthoz, thus being dubbed as the \"club championship of the continent\" by the local newspapers.[14][15] The Mitropa Cup, a competition modelled after the Challenge Cup, was created in 1927, an idea of Austrian Hugo Meisl, and played between Central European clubs.[16] In 1930, the Coupe des Nations (French: Nations Cup), the first attempt to create a cup for national champion clubs of Europe, was played and organised by Swiss club Servette.[17] Held in Geneva, it brought together ten champions from across the continent. The tournament was won by Újpest of Hungary.[17] Latin European nations came together to form the Latin Cup in 1949.[18] After receiving reports from his journalists over the highly successful South American Championship of Champions of 1948, Gabriel Hanot, editor of L'Équipe, began proposing the creation of a continent-wide tournament.[19] In interviews, Jacques Ferran (one of the founders of the European Champions Cup, together with Gabriel Hanot),[20] said that the South American Championship of Champions was the inspiration for the European Champions Cup.[21] After Stan Cullis declared Wolverhampton Wanderers \"Champions of the World\" following a successful run of friendlies in the 1950s, in particular a 3–2 friendly victory against Budapest Honvéd, Hanot finally managed to convince UEFA to put into practice such a tournament.[1] It was conceived in Paris in 1955 as the European Champion Clubs' Cup.[1] The first European Cup took place during the 1955–56 season.[22][23] Sixteen teams participated (some by invitation): AC Milan (Italy), AGF Aarhus (Denmark), Anderlecht (Belgium), Djurgården (Sweden), Gwardia Warszawa (Poland), Hibernian (Scotland), Partizan (Yugoslavia), PSV Eindhoven (Netherlands), Rapid Wien (Austria), Real Madrid (Spain), Rot-Weiss Essen (West Germany), Saarbrücken (Saar), Servette (Switzerland), Sporting CP (Portugal), Reims (France) and Vörös Lobogó (Hungary).[22][23] The first European Cup match took place on 4 September 1955, and ended in a 3–3 draw between Sporting CP and Partizan.[22][23] The first goal in European Cup history was scored by João Baptista Martins of Sporting CP.[22][23] The inaugural final took place at the Parc des Princes between Stade de Reims and Real Madrid on 13 June 1956.[22][23][24] The Spanish squad came back from behind to win 4–3 thanks to goals from Alfredo Di Stéfano and Marquitos, as well as two goals from Héctor Rial.[22][23][24] Real Madrid successfully defended the trophy next season in their home stadium, the Santiago Bernabéu, against Fiorentina.[25][26] After a scoreless first half, Real Madrid scored twice in six minutes to defeat the Italians.[24][25][26] In 1958, Milan failed to capitalise after going ahead on the scoreline twice, only for Real Madrid to equalise.[27][28] The final, held in Heysel Stadium, went to extra time where Francisco Gento scored the game-winning goal to allow Real Madrid to retain the title for the third consecutive season.[24][27][28] In a rematch of the first final, Real Madrid faced Stade Reims at the Neckarstadion for the 1959 final, and won 2–0.[24][29][30] West German side Eintracht Frankfurt became the first team not to compete in the Latin cup to reach the European Cup final.[18][31][32] The 1960 final holds the record for the most goals scored, with Real Madrid beating Eintracht Frankfurt 7–3 at Hampden Park, courtesy of four goals by Ferenc Puskás and a hat-trick by Alfredo Di Stéfano.[24][31][32] This was Real Madrid's fifth consecutive title, a record that still stands today.[9] Real Madrid's reign ended in the 1960–61 season when bitter rivals Barcelona dethroned them in the first round.[33][34] Barcelona were defeated in the final by Portuguese side Benfica 3–2 at the Wankdorf Stadium.[33][34][35] Reinforced by Eusébio, Benfica defeated Real Madrid 5–3 at the Olympic Stadium in Amsterdam and kept the title for a second consecutive season.[35][36][37] Benfica wanted to repeat Real Madrid's successful run of the 1950s after reaching the showpiece event of the 1962–63 European Cup, but a brace from Brazilian-Italian José Altafini at Wembley gave the spoils to Milan, making the trophy leave the Iberian Peninsula for the first time ever.[38][39][40] Inter Milan beat an ageing Real Madrid 3–1 at the Ernst-Happel-Stadion to win the 1963–64 season and replicate their local-rival's success.[41][42][43] The title stayed in Milan for the third year in a row after Inter beat Benfica 1–0 at their home ground, the San Siro.[44][45][46] Under the leadership of Jock Stein, Scottish club Celtic beat Inter Milan 2–1 in the 1967 final to become the first British club to win the European Cup.[47][48] The Celtic players that day, all of whom were born within 30 miles (48 km) of Glasgow, subsequently became known as the \"Lisbon Lions\".[49] The 1967–68 season saw Manchester United become the first English team to win the European Cup, beating two-times winners Benfica 4–1 in the final.[50] This final came ten years after the Munich air disaster, which had claimed the lives of eight United players and left their manager, Matt Busby, fighting for his life.[51] In the 1968–69 season, Ajax became the first Dutch team to reach the European Cup final, but they were beaten 4–1 by Milan, who claimed their second European Cup, with Pierino Prati scoring a hat-trick.[52] The 1969–70 season saw the first Dutch winners of the competition. Feyenoord knocked out the defending champions, Milan in the second round,[53] before beating Celtic in the final.[54] In the 1970–71 season, Ajax won the title, beating Greek side Panathinaikos in the final.[55] the season saw a number of changes, with penalty shoot-outs being introduced, and the away goals rule being changed so that it would be used in all rounds except the final.[56] It was also the first time a Greek team reached the final, as well as the first season that Real Madrid failed to qualify, having finished sixth in La Liga the previous season.[57] Ajax went on to win the competition three years in row (1971 to 1973), which Bayern Munich emulated from 1974 to 1976, before Liverpool won their first two titles in 1977 and 1978.[58] The following seasons saw victories in 1978–79 and 1979–80 for Brian Clough's Nottingham Forest. The following year Liverpool won their third title before Aston Villa continued the sense of English dominance in 1982. In 1982–83, Hamburger SV broke the English dominance. Liverpool regained it in 1983–84 before losing to Juventus (1984–85); Steaua București then won in 1985–86, Porto in 1986–87, PSV Eindhoven in 1987–88; Milan (2), Red Star Belgrade and Barcelona became champions before the competition was re-formulated as the UEFA Champions League. All English clubs were banned for five years (Liverpool for six years) following the 1985 European Cup final due to the Heysel Stadium disaster. \"Magic...it's magic above all else. When you hear the anthem it captivates you straight away.\" The UEFA Champions League anthem, officially titled simply as \"Champions League\", was written by Tony Britten, and is an adaptation of George Frideric Handel's 1727 anthem Zadok the Priest (one of his Coronation Anthems).[60][61] UEFA commissioned Britten in 1992 to arrange an anthem, and the piece was performed by London's Royal Philharmonic Orchestra and sung by the Academy of St. Martin in the Fields.[60] Stating that \"the anthem is now almost as iconic as the trophy\", UEFA's official website adds it is \"known to set the hearts of many of the world's top footballers aflutter\".[60] The chorus contains the three official languages used by UEFA: English, German, and French.[62] The climactic moment is set to the exclamations 'Die Meister! Die Besten! Les Grandes Équipes! The Champions!'.[63] The anthem's chorus is played before each UEFA Champions League game as the two teams are lined up, as well as at the beginning and end of television broadcasts of the matches. In addition to the anthem, there is also entrance music, which contains parts of the anthem itself, which is played as teams enter the field.[64] The complete anthem is about three minutes long, and has two short verses and the chorus.[62] Special vocal versions have been performed live at the Champions League final with lyrics in other languages, changing over to the host nation's language for the chorus. These versions were performed by Andrea Bocelli (Italian; Rome 2009, Milan 2016 and Cardiff 2017), Juan Diego Flores (Spanish; Madrid 2010), All Angels (Wembley 2011), Jonas Kaufmann and David Garrett (Munich 2012) and Mariza (Lisbon 2014). In the 2013 final at Wembley, the chorus was played twice. In the 2018 and 2019 finals, held in Kyiv and Madrid respectively, the instrumental version of the chorus was played, by 2Cellos (2018) and Asturia Girls (2019).[65][66] In the 2023 final, held in Istanbul, Hungarian pianist Ádám György performed the piano version of the anthem.[67] The anthem has been released commercially in its original version on iTunes and Spotify with the title of Champions League Theme. In 2018, composer Hans Zimmer remixed the anthem with rapper Vince Staples for EA Sports' video game FIFA 19, with it also featuring in the game's reveal trailer.[68] In 1991, UEFA asked its commercial partner, Television Event and Media Marketing (TEAM), to help brand the Champions League. This resulted in the anthem, \"house colours\" of black and white or silver and a logo, and the \"starball\". The starball was created by Design Bridge, a London-based firm selected by TEAM after a competition.[69] TEAM gives particular attention to detail in how the colours and starball are depicted at matches. According to TEAM, \"Irrespective of whether you are a spectator in Moscow or Milan, you will always see the same stadium dressing materials, the same opening ceremony featuring the 'starball' centre circle ceremony, and hear the same UEFA Champions League Anthem\". Based on research it conducted, TEAM concluded that by 1999, \"the starball logo had achieved a recognition rate of 94 percent among fans\".[70] The UEFA Champions League used to begin with a double round-robin group stage of 32 teams until it evolved into a league phase of 36 teams, which is preceded by two qualification 'streams' for teams that do not receive direct entry to the tournament proper. The two streams are divided between teams qualified by virtue of being league champions, and those qualified by virtue of finishing second, third or fourth in their national championship. The number of teams that each association enters into the UEFA Champions League is based upon the UEFA coefficients of the member associations. These coefficients are generated by the results of clubs representing each association during the previous five Champions League, Europa League and Conference League seasons. The higher an association's coefficient, the more teams represent the association in the Champions League, and the fewer qualification rounds the association's teams must compete in. Five of the remaining seven qualifying places are granted to the winners of a four-round qualifying tournament between the remaining 43 or 44 national champions, within which those champions from associations with higher coefficients receive byes to later rounds. The other two are granted to the winners of a three-round qualifying tournament between ten and eleven clubs from the associations ranked 5–6 through 15, which have qualified based upon finishing second, third or fourth in their respective national league. In addition to sporting criteria, any club must be licensed by its national association to participate in the Champions League. To obtain a license, the club must meet certain stadium, infrastructure and finance requirements. In 2005–06, Liverpool and Artmedia Bratislava became the first teams to reach the Champions League group stage after playing in all three qualifying rounds. Real Madrid and Barcelona hold the record for the most appearances in the group stage, having qualified 25 times, followed by Porto and Bayern Munich on 24.[71] Between 1999 and 2008, no differentiation was made between champions and non-champions in qualification. The 16 top-ranked teams spread across the biggest domestic leagues qualified directly for the tournament group stage. Prior to this, three preliminary knockout qualifying rounds whittled down the remaining teams, with teams starting in different rounds. An exception to the usual European qualification system happened in 2005, after Liverpool won the Champions League the year before, but did not finish in a Champions League qualification place in the Premier League that season. UEFA gave special dispensation for Liverpool to enter the Champions League, giving England five qualifiers.[72] UEFA subsequently ruled that the defending champions qualify for the competition the following year regardless of their domestic league placing. However, for those leagues with four entrants in the Champions League, this meant that, if the Champions League winner fell outside of its domestic league's top four, it would qualify at the expense of the fourth-placed team in the league. Until 2015–16, no association could have more than four entrants in the Champions League.[73] In May 2012, Tottenham Hotspur finished fourth in the 2011–12 Premier League, two places ahead of Chelsea, but failed to qualify for the 2012–13 Champions League, after Chelsea won the 2012 final.[74] Tottenham were demoted to the 2012–13 UEFA Europa League.[74] In May 2013,[75] it was decided that, starting from the 2015–16 season (and continuing at least for the three-year cycle until the 2017–18 season), the winners of the previous season's UEFA Europa League would qualify for the UEFA Champions League, entering at least the play-off round, and entering the group stage if the berth reserved for the Champions League title holders was not used. The previous limit of a maximum of four teams per association was increased to five, meaning that a fourth-placed team from one of the top three ranked associations would only have to be moved to the Europa League if both the Champions League and Europa League winners came from that association and both finished outside the top four of their domestic league.[76] In 2007, Michel Platini, the UEFA president, had proposed taking one place from the three leagues with four entrants and allocating it to that nation's cup winners. This proposal was rejected in a vote at a UEFA Strategy Council meeting.[77] In the same meeting, however, it was agreed that the third-placed team in the top three leagues would receive automatic qualification for the group stage, rather than entry into the third qualifying round, while the fourth-placed team would enter the play-off round for non-champions, guaranteeing an opponent from one of the top 15 leagues in Europe. This was part of Platini's plan to increase the number of teams qualifying directly into the group stage, while simultaneously increasing the number of teams from lower-ranked nations in the group stage.[78] In 2012, Arsène Wenger referred to qualifying for the Champions League by finishing in the top four places in the Premier League as the \"4th Place Trophy\". The phrase was coined after a pre-match conference when he was questioned about Arsenal's lack of a trophy after exiting the FA Cup. He said \"The first trophy is to finish in the top four\".[79] At Arsenal's 2012 AGM, Wenger was also quoted as saying: \"For me there are five trophies every season: Premier League, Champions League, the third is to qualify for the Champions League...\"[80] Beginning with the 2024–25 season, UEFA changed the format of their three club competitions, abandoning the group stage in favour of an expanded league phase.[81] The number of participating teams was increased from 32 to 36 teams. Teams are no longer divided into groups of four teams each but are ranked in a single table. Each team plays eight matches against eight different opponents. For the draw of the league phase, teams are divided into four seeding pots according to their UEFA coefficient. Each team will play against two teams from each pot, one home and one away. The league phase is played from September to January, while the knockout phase begins in February, with matches predominantly played on Tuesday and Wednesday nights. After the league phase, a two-legged knockout play-off round is played between teams finishing 9–16 (seeded) and 17–24 (unseeded) in the league phase. Teams finishing in the top eight of the league phase receive a bye to the round of 16 as seeded teams, while the eight winning teams from the knockout play-off round will enter the round of 16 draw as unseeded teams. Teams finishing 25th–36th place in the league phase and the eight losers of the knockout play-offs are eliminated from the competition and from European football since it is no longer possible to enter the Europa League from the league phase onwards. After the round of 16 the competition follows the traditional knockout format with quarter-finals, semi-finals (both two legged and without association draw protection) and then the final at a venue chosen prior to the season. The final is typically held in late May or early June. Prior to the 2024–25 season, the tournament proper began with a group stage of 32 teams, divided into eight groups of four.[82] The draw to determine which teams entered each group was seeded based on each team's UEFA coefficient, and no group could contain more than one club from each association. Each team played six group stage games, meeting the other three teams in its group home and away in a round-robin format.[82] The first place team and the runners-up from each group then progressed to the next round. The third-placed teams entered the Europa League's knockout round and the fourth-placed teams were eliminated from the competition. For the next stage – the last 16 – the winning team from one group played against the runners-up from another group, but teams from the same association could not be drawn against each other (see random two-sided matching). From the quarter-finals onwards, the draw was entirely random, without association protection.[83] The group stage was played from September to December, whilst the knockout stage began in February, with matches usually played on Tuesday and Wednesday nights. The knockout ties were played in a two-legged format, with the exception of the final. In the 2019–20 season, due to the COVID-19 pandemic the tournament was suspended for five months. The format of the remainder of the tournament was temporarily amended as a result, with the quarter-finals and semi-finals being played as single match knockout ties at neutral venues in Lisbon, Portugal in the summer with the final taking place on 23 August 2020.[84] The following is the default access list. Changes will be made to the access list above if the Champions League or Europa League title holders qualify for the tournament via their domestic leagues. Each year, the winning team is presented with the European Champion Clubs' Cup, the current version of which has been awarded since 1967. From the 1968–69 season and prior to the 2008–09 season any team that won the Champions League three years in a row or five times overall was awarded the official trophy permanently.[86] Each time a club achieved this, a new official trophy had to be forged for the following season.[87] Five clubs own a version of the official trophy: Real Madrid, Ajax, Bayern Munich, Milan and Liverpool.[86] Since 2008, the official trophy has remained with UEFA and the clubs are awarded a replica.[86] The current trophy is 74 cm (29 in) tall and made of silver, weighing 11 kg (24 lb). It was designed by Jürg Stadelmann, a jeweller from Bern, Switzerland, after the original was given to Real Madrid in 1966 in recognition of their six titles to date, and cost 10,000 Swiss francs. As of the 2012–13 season, 40 gold medals are presented to the Champions League winners, and 40 silver medals to the runners-up.[88] Starting with the 2024–25 season, the distribution of the prize money is as follows.[89] A large part of the distributed revenue from the UEFA Champions League is linked to the \"market pool\", the distribution of which is determined by the value of the television market in each nation. For the 2019–20 season, Paris Saint-Germain, who were the runners-up, earned nearly €126.8 million in total, of which €101.3 million was prize money, compared with the €125.46 million earned by Bayern Munich, who won the tournament and were awarded €112.96 million in prize money.[90] Like the FIFA World Cup, the UEFA Champions League is sponsored by a group of multinational corporations, in contrast to the single main sponsor typically found in national top-flight leagues. When the Champions League was created in 1992, it was decided that a maximum of eight companies should be allowed to sponsor the event, with each corporation being allocated four advertising boards around the perimeter of the pitch, as well as logo placement at pre- and post-match interviews and a certain number of tickets to each match. This, combined with a deal to ensure tournament sponsors were given priority on television advertisements during matches, ensured that each of the tournament's main sponsors was given maximum exposure.[91] From the 2012–13 knockout phase, UEFA used LED advertising hoardings installed in knockout participant stadiums, including the final. From the 2015–16 season onwards, UEFA has used such hoardings from the play-off round until the final.[92] Since 2021, the UEFA also used Virtual Board Replacement (VBR) technology to offer region-based advertising; regional sponsors are inserted into the hoardings as shown on the broadcast feed in specific regions along with the global sponsors.[93][94] Individual clubs may wear jerseys with advertising. However, only two sponsorships are permitted per jersey in addition to that of the kit manufacturer, at the chest and the left sleeve.[95] Exceptions are made for non-profit organisations, which can feature on the front of the shirt, incorporated with the main sponsor or in place of it; or on the back, either below the squad number or on the collar area.[96] If a club plays a match in a nation where the relevant sponsorship category is restricted (such as France's alcohol advertising restriction), then they must remove that logo from their jerseys. For example, when Rangers played French side Auxerre in the 1996–97 Champions League, they wore the logo of the holiday chain Center Parcs instead of their primary sponsor, McEwan's Lager (both companies at the time were subsidiaries of Scottish & Newcastle).[97] The tournament's main sponsors for the 2024–27 cycle are: Adidas is a secondary sponsor and supplies the official match ball, while Macron supplies the referee kits.[107] The competition attracts an extensive television audience, not just in Europe, but throughout the world. The final of the tournament has been, in recent years, the most-watched annual sporting event in the world.[108] The final of the 2012–13 tournament had the competition's highest TV ratings to date, drawing approximately 360 million television viewers.[109] Notes Players that are still active in Europe are highlighted in boldface. The table below does not include appearances made in the qualification stage of the competition. Starting from the 2021–22 edition, UEFA introduced the UEFA Champions League Player of the Season award. The jury is composed of the coaches of the clubs that participated in the group stage of the competition, as well as 55 journalists selected by the European Sports Media (ESM) group, one from each UEFA member association. In the same season, UEFA also introduced the UEFA Champions League Young Player of the Season award.",

The final will be played on 31 May 2025 at Allianz Arena in Munich, Germany.[4] The winners of the 2024–25 UEFA Champions League will automatically qualify for the 2025–26 UEFA Champions League league phase, the 2025 FIFA Intercontinental Cup, the 2029 FIFA Club World Cup, and earn the right to play against the winners of the 2024–25 UEFA Europa League in the 2025 UEFA Super Cup.

A total of 81 teams from 53 of the 55 UEFA member associations are set to participate in the 2024–25 UEFA Champions League (the exceptions being Liechtenstein which does not organise a domestic league and Russia which is currently suspended). The association ranking based on the UEFA association coefficients is used to determine the number of participating teams for each association:[5] For the 2024–25 UEFA Champions League, the associations were allocated places according to their 2023 UEFA association coefficients, which took into account their performance in European competitions from 2018–19 to 2022–23.[6] The table reflects Russia's ongoing suspension from UEFA.

The 36 teams were manually drawn and then automated software digitally drew their eight different opponents at random, determining which of their matches were at home and which ones away. Each team will face two opponents from each of the four pots, one at home and one away. Teams could not face opponents from their own association, and could only be drawn against a maximum of two sides from the same association.[14] Aston Villa, Bologna, Brest, Girona and Slovan Bratislava made their debut appearances since the introduction of the group stage. Brest and Girona also made their debut appearances in European football.[15][16] A total of 16 national associations are represented in the league phase. The top eight ranked teams will receive a bye to the round of 16. The teams ranked from 9th to 24th will contest the knockout phase play-offs, with the teams ranked from 9th to 16th seeded for the draw. Teams ranked from 25th to 36th are eliminated from all competitions, with no access to the 2024–25 UEFA Europa League. In the knockout phase, teams will play against each other over two legs on a home-and-away basis, except for the one-match final. The bracket structure for the knockout phase is partially fixed in advance using seeding, with teams' positions in the bracket determined by the final standings in the league phase. In the knockout phase, there is no country protection, with teams from the same association able to face each other in any round.
