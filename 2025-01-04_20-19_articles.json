                "content": "NWS All NOAA Privacy Policy Central Illinois Weather Forecast Office Local National Weather Service offices issue Winter Storm Warnings, Winter Storm Watches, and Winter Weather Advisories. What do these different products mean? This graphic breaks down the criteria for issuance here in central Illinois: Normally, a Winter Storm Watch will be issued in advance of the storm (usually at least 24 hours). It indicates the risk of a hazardous winter weather event has increased (at least a 50% chance of it occurring), but its occurrence, location, and/or timing is still uncertain. It is intended to provide enough lead time so you can make plans to stay safe. While rare for our area, a Blizzard Watch may be issued instead. As the event becomes imminent, a watch will normally be upgraded to either a warning or an advisory (which indicates an 80% or greater probability of occurence). A Warning indicates that conditions pose a threat to life or property, and that travel will become difficult to impossible. An Advisory indicates conditions pose a significant inconvenience, and if caution is not exercised, could lead to situations that may threaten life and/or property. There are 3 types of warnings issued by our office: There are two types of advisories issued by our office: For more winter preparedness information, visit our Winter Weather Preparedness page.

                "title": "Winter Storm Blair Update: 15 States Face Potentially Heavy Snow Today - Newsweek",
                "content": "Millions of Americans are bracing for severe winter weather today as Winter Storm Blair moves across the country, bringing heavy snow, high winds, and dangerous travel conditions to 15 states. It comes after the NWS said Storm Blair will produce \"Arctic outbreaks\" in many areas of the country. Heavy snow could cause widespread disruption, making travel challenging and potentially dangerous, with reduced visibility, slick roads, and the risk of accidents or delays. The 15 states under winter storm warnings are Kentucky, Indiana, Maryland, West Virginia, Kansas, Montana, Illinois, Iowa, Missouri, Alaska, West Virginia, Michigan, Pennsylvania, Virginia and Nebraska. The National Weather Service (NWS) reports that regions spanning from central Kansas to Indiana face a 60 percent to 90 percent chance of receiving at least eight inches of snow, but some areas, including Kansas and Missouri, could receive up to 14 inches of snow. Areas with the highest accumulations could experience their \"heaviest snowfall in at least a decade,\" according to the NWS. The agency has also warned that power outages and tree damage are likely due to the ice. Meanwhile, in Yakutat in Alaska, the NWS has warned that snow will accumulate quickly on Saturday. \"For Yakutat, snow showers over the area are expected to continue through the night with very dry and fluffy snow. Said snow is expected to accumulate quickly,\" the agency said. In areas such as Kentucky, Kansas, Maryland and West Virginia, wind gusts of up to 50 mph are possible. The NWS said in a statement on Friday that \"travel of all kinds will likely be very difficult and extremely dangerous\" in areas with expected heavy snow and/or significant icing. Travelers are advised to keep an emergency kit in their vehicles, including a flashlight, food, and water. Non-essential travel should be delayed, the NWS said, but if venturing out is unavoidable, extreme caution is essential. Drivers should prepare for sudden changes in visibility, maintain a safe distance from other vehicles, and allow extra time to reach their destinations. Drivers should also avoid sudden braking or acceleration, and exercise particular care on hills and during turns. Ensuring that vehicles are properly winterized and in good working order is also strongly recommended. In areas with ice accumulation, the NWS has recommended carrying a winter storm kit, which should include essentials such as tire chains, booster cables, a flashlight, a shovel, blankets, and extra clothing. Additionally, they advised bringing water, a first aid kit, and any other items that could assist in surviving if stranded. AccuWeather lead long-range expert Paul Pastelok said: \"This could end up being the coldest January since 2011 for the U.S. as a whole.\" He also noted that the storm's arctic outbreak will \"involve many days and not just be a quick one-to-three-day event.\" The NWS said on X: \"As we round out 2024 and head into 2025, above normal warmth across the eastern half of the U.S. will be quickly replaced by a series of Arctic outbreaks... with the coldest air of the season set to take hold through next week.\" The warnings come amid reports that a polar vortex could bring the coldest January the U.S. has faced in years. A polar vortex is a stream of cold air and could mean severe weather conditions, including heavy snowfall and freezing temperatures that could affect travel conditions and lead to school closures. \"Below-normal temperatures are favored across the central and eastern U.S. during much of January,\" the NWS said last week.

                "content": "A winter storm warning (SAME code: WSW) is a hazardous weather statement issued by Weather Forecast Offices (WFO) of the National Weather Service (NWS) in the United States to alert the public that a winter storm is occurring or is about to occur in the area, usually within 36 hours of the storm's onset. A similar warning is issued by Environment and Climate Change Canada (ECCC) through local forecast offices of the Meteorological Service of Canada. Generally, a Winter Storm Warning is issued if the following criteria, at minimum, are forecast: snow accumulations usually between or greater than 4 to 7 inches (10 to 18 cm), or snow accumulations of usually three inches (7.6 cm) or more with significant accumulation of ice (sleet or freezing rain). In the Southern United States, where severe winter weather is much less common and any snow is a more significant event, warning criteria are lower, as low as one inch (2.5 cm) in the southernmost areas: as one goes from north to south, the accumulation estimates needed to meet warning criteria lessen. A warning can also be issued during high impact events of lesser amounts, usually early or very late in the season when trees have leaves and damage can result. Winter Storm Warnings for snow events are issued when winds are less than 35 mph (56 km/h); if the storm is expected to produce winds above this speed for at least three hours accompanying moderate to heavy snowfall, a blizzard warning will be issued instead or as an upgrade to the winter storm warning. Usually, a large accumulation of ice alone with little to no snow will result in an ice storm warning, or in the case of light freezing rain, a winter weather advisory, a freezing rain advisory, or a freezing drizzle advisory. In lieu of issuing such a statement separately, Winter Storm Warnings can include verbiage indicative of a wind chill advisory or a wind chill warning, if potentially life-threatening wind chill values (determined by local criteria) are forecast to accompany winter precipitation during the warning's duration. Beginning with the 2008–09 meteorological winter, the National Weather Service consolidated individual precipitation-specific bulletins for winter storms expected to create heavy snowfall (heavy snow warning), lake-effect snow (lake effect snow warning) or sleet accumulations (sleet warning or heavy sleet warning) within the warned area, replacing them with variants of the Winter Storm Warning product outlining the accordant hazards being forecast: Additionally, all of the above warning types may also include verbiage indicative of a wind advisory to indicate strong winds that are expected to accompany the precipitation (e.g., \"winter storm warning for heavy wet snow and strong winds\"). The generic \"winter storm warning\" terminology may be used on its own, typically to indicate that all types of winter precipitation (as a mixture or in periods before transitioning between types) are expected in high amounts; however, it may be defined generically at the forecaster's discretion regardless of whether or not this condition is met.

                "content": "Manage your account Millions of Americans can expect winter weather this weekend as a storm brings ice, snow and rain across the central Plains, Ohio Valley and the Mid-Atlantic. The winter weather commences in the Plains late Saturday before reaching the Mid-Atlantic by Sunday, according to the National Weather Service. Blizzard and whiteout conditions are expected in the central Plains, making driving conditions either dangerous or impossible without the risk of becoming stranded. At least 8 inches of snow are expected in Indiana and central Kansas, areas that could experience the highest snowfall in at least a decade, the service reported. Dangerous sleet or freezing rain is forecast between eastern Kansas and the Ozarks toward the Ohio Valley, according to forecasters. Meanwhile the Central Appalachians will face freezing rain and ice, posing a risk of power outages and hazardous travel. Winter storm warnings and winter weather advisories remain in effect from western Pennsylvania and West Virginia to far western Maryland, where snow totals of at least 6 inches are expected. Lake effect snow warnings are also set to continue from northeast Ohio, far northwest Pennsylvania, as well as parts of western and northwest New York State, with snow totals between 1 to 2 feet, according to the weather service.

                "title": "Rep. Mike Johnson wins vote to remain House speaker | CNN Politics",
                "content": "• Speaker chosen: Mike Johnson was re-elected speaker of the House on Friday after flipping two GOP opponents following an intervention by President-elect Donald Trump, but he’ll face a big challenge in Congress with the narrowest House majority in nearly 100 years. See how every lawmaker voted here. • Trump’s challenge: The first vote of the 119th Congress underscored the president-elect’s hold over the Republican Party — and the tall task of keeping it together over the next two years ahead of the 2026 midterms, which could threaten the GOP’s Washington trifecta. • Key procedural change: In a significant victory for Johnson, the House made it harder to remove a speaker by approving a key procedural change that requires a minimum of nine GOP lawmakers to force a vote on an ouster. Previously, it only required one member to force a vote. We’ve wrapped up our live coverage for the day. Read more here on the vote for Speaker of the House Former House Speaker Kevin McCarthy posted a picture with President-elect Donald Trump at Mar-a-Lago on Friday, hours after House Speaker Mike Johnson was re-elected on the first vote – starkly different from McCarthy’s election in 2023. “Always great spending time with President Trump tonight,” McCarthy posted alongside Trump, who gave a thumbs up. In another post with the same photo over music, McCarthy wrote, “Catching up with President Trump today. 17 days to go.” McCarthy was elected speaker after 15 votes and ultimately ousted after former Florida Rep. Matt Gaetz offered a motion to vacate the chair on the House floor, which prevailed. Johnson succeeded McCarthy about three weeks after McCarthy was ousted. Ahead of Friday’s vote, Johnson earned Trump’s endorsement. President-elect Donald Trump announced Friday that Morgan Ortagus would serve as “Deputy Special Presidential Envoy for Middle East Peace.” “Early on Morgan fought me for three years, but hopefully has learned her lesson,” Trump posted on Truth Social. “These things usually don’t work out, but she has strong Republican support, and I’m not doing this for me, I’m doing it for them. Let’s see what happens. She will hopefully be an asset to Steve, a great leader and talent, as we seek to bring calm and prosperity to a very troubled region. I expect great results, and soon!” The president-elect, in his post, also detailed Ortagus’ experience as an active US Navy Reserve Intelligence Officer and as spokesperson at the Department of State. Trump named his longtime friend Steve Witkoff as special envoy to the Middle East last year. Some House Republicans and Democrats are warning Speaker Mike Johnson of the challenges ahead in a tight 119th Congress where the GOP has one of the narrowest House majorities in nearly 100 years. Republican Rep. Lauren Boebert, who had declined to say if she would back Johnson before ultimately voting for him Friday, said if he “does everything right” he can stay speaker. Boebert said she would prefer if it only required one member to threaten to oust Johnson. The House voted to adopt a rules package earlier today that allows for a 9-member motion to vacate the speakership. “If there’s enough compromise that is damaging to the agenda, there very well could be a motion to vacate,” Boebert said. “Do I have a plan to do that? I’m sure that’s your next question. No, but I haven’t seen what we’re doing at this time either. I hope Mike Johnson has the most successful speakership that we’ve seen.” Democratic Rep. Pramila Jayapal warned that Johnson may have a tougher time actually governing with his narrow margin because “if you can’t get a majority, you’ve gotta work with Democrats.” “The mood is not to bail him out this time around, especially after he screwed us on the last agreement that we made and he backed away from it,” she said, a reference to the bipartisan bill to fund the federal government that was scrapped in December after President-elect Donald Trump’s intervention. GOP Rep. Troy Nehls emphasized Trump’s role in helping Johnson secure the speakership as well as House Republicans winning the majority in the first place. “Trump gave us the gavel,” Nehls said. “I think Mike Johnson and the House of Representatives, we probably owe Donald Trump.” House Speaker Mike Johnson says he has not seen a letter signed by Rep. Chip Roy and other detractors, and that he can’t comment on their demands. “I haven’t seen it. I can’t comment on it,” he said. Roy was joined in the letter by 10 other House Republicans — Reps. Andy Harris, Scott Perry, Andy Biggs, Clay Higgins, Michael Cloud, Andy Ogles, Eli Crane, Eric Burlison, Ralph Norman and Andrew Clyde — who resisted Johnson’s return to the speakership but ultimately backed him on the first ballot Friday. In the letter, the lawmakers demanded that Johnson make several commitments to “prove he will not fail to enact President Trump’s bold agenda.” These demands included legislation banning member stock trading, rolling back Biden-Harris environmental policies, and cutting spending. Johnson has insisted he did not cut any deals in order to secure the gavel. Mike Johnson will keep his job as House speaker after a dramatic vote on Friday as the 119th Congress prepares to get to work. He won in the first round — but only after flipping two GOP opponents as the vote was held open to give Republicans more time to secure support for Johnson, who was backed by President-elect Donald Trump. Now that he is elected, Johnson faces a tough legislating challenge with the narrowest House majority in nearly 100 years. However, in a key victory for Johnson, the House made it harder to oust a speaker. Included as part of the sweeping package was a procedural change that will require a minimum of nine GOP lawmakers to force a vote to oust a speaker. Previously, it only required one member to force a vote.

Johnson will face a big challenge in Congress with the narrowest House majority in nearly 100 years. CNN's Jake Tapper breaks down the vote. House Republicans will meet this weekend to flesh out their legislative priorities, planning for an ambitious agenda now that the GOP controls both chambers of Congress and the White House. The new Congress was sworn in Friday, and Speaker Mike Johnson was re-elected despite a very slim majority. The lawmakers will debate how to proceed on budget reconciliation, an expedited process for considering bills that would allow the party to push through their agenda without Democratic support. The House Republicans are expected to meet at Fort McNair in Washington, DC, on Saturday, and elected leadership is set to meet in Baltimore on Sunday. The House voted to make it harder to oust a speaker on Friday – another victory for Johnson after he retained the gavel in a nail-biter of a vote earlier in the day. The chamber voted to adopt a new rules package for the 119th Congress – a lengthy document that covers a wide array of rules and regulations. Included as part of the sweeping package is a procedural change that will require a minimum of nine GOP lawmakers to force a vote to oust a speaker. Previously, it only required one member to force a vote. That one-member threshold is what led to the ouster of former Speaker Kevin McCarthy when former GOP Rep. Matt Gaetz forced a vote on his removal. The House voted 215 to 209 to approve the overall rules package. House Democratic Rep. Jim McGovern, the ranking member on the Rules Committee, criticized two additional provisions in the rules package. One is that the speaker can only entertain a motion to suspend the rules on Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday – an apparent concession to the initial GOP holdouts in the speaker’s vote. House GOP leadership has sometimes brought bills – including major spending legislation – to the floor under suspension as a way of bypassing the House Rules committee, which Rep. Ralph Norman – one of the initial defectors who later flipped - sits on, lessening the panel’s power. This would limit leadership’s ability to do that. McGovern said Republicans “worked out another backroom deal,” and argued that the change could paralyze the House’s ability to move swiftly in the event of a major emergency, like a national disaster or terror attack. The congressman also said Republicans moved to “change words like child to son or daughter in our ethics rules” – with McGovern calling it “weird,” and saying, “they’re obsessed with this stuff.” Sens. Angela Alsobrooks of Maryland and Lisa Blunt Rochester of Delaware became the third and fourth Black Democratic senators in the current Congress on Friday when Vice President Kamala Harris swore them in on Friday. There have only been 14 Black senators to serve in the US Senate. From slavery and Jim Crow laws to suppression of minority voters, Black political candidates have long faced stumbling blocks. Hiram Revels, the first Black US senator, took office in the late 1800s as part of a wave of African American lawmakers during the Reconstruction era, but he was elected by the Mississippi legislature, not the state’s voters. Also on Friday, South Carolina Sen. Tim Scott became the longest-serving Black US senator. He is the sole Black Republican in the Senate. Scott will serve as the first Black chairman of a Senate standing committee, leading the Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs Committee, where he previously served as the ranking Republican member when Democrats held control of the chamber in the previous session. Republican Rep. Ralph Norman, who initially voted against Mike Johnson before changing his vote, said the speaker had signaled in negotiations that he would allow more GOP voices at the table under his leadership this Congress. Asked by CNN’s Manu Raju if Johnson had made any commitments that made him change his mind, Norman said the speaker promised “more conservatives will be at the table on negotiations.” “Let’s put people like Chip Roy, and I’m just using him as an example, like other people who are true…know how to negotiate and we’ll fight and we’ll put things to the American people, much like what the DOGE commission intend to do,” he said, a reference to the newly created department aimed at cutting government spending led by Vivek Ramaswamy and Elon Musk. Norman said he trusted that Johnson would “give us that platform,” and that the speaker had convinced both him and Rep. Keith Self, another Republican who voted against Johnson at first, to give him a chance. “He knew if it went to a second ballot it was going to get tougher,” Norman said. Asked what Donald Trump had said when they talked on the phone, Norman said the president-elect was “in the middle of a golf game” and brought up how the South Carolina Republican had voted for Republican presidential candidate Nikki Haley in the primary. “I said, Yes sir, I did. We’re with you now and I said we will be with Mike Johnson,” Norman told reporters he responded to Trump, adding that he told him the president-elect would have to help House Republicans push his agenda. Norman said Trump had told him that Johnson was the only one who had the “likeability” to be speaker. House Speaker Mike Johnson is insisting that he did not cut deals with Reps. Ralph Norman and Keith Self to get over the finish line during today’s speaker vote. “There were no deals cut,” he told CNN’s Manu Raju. “I took suggestions and requests from all members on process reforms and changes, which I was already committed to. We made no deals to anyone, no quid pro quo to anybody on any position, or anything at all. Through the entire — I haven’t done that in 14 months, and I was not about to start today. And I think that’s important, because there needs to be transparency. Every member needs to be on a level playing field, and we maintained that today and I’m really proud of it.” Johnson said there would be a “new paradigm” and noted plans to “decentralize the speaker’s office and power.” “We’re going to have unified government with Republican control of the House, the Senate and the White House, so very different environment — 60% of the House Republicans have never served in a unified government situation. So, I had explained to them how the processes are different and the procedures, and that we are in, effectively, a law-making exercise every single day,” he said. Johnson said he had to “convince them that it will be a member-driven process.” Johnson acknowledged that President-elect Donald Trump’s support was very important. He argued Trump is “the most powerful president, certainly of the modern era, maybe in all of American history” and said the two work “very well together.” South Carolina Rep. Ralph Norman, one of the key Republican holdouts who eventually switched his vote to support Speaker Mike Johnson, said he didn’t get anything for throwing his support behind the Louisiana lawmaker. “I didn’t get anything personally. Other than a commitment that things are going to change,” he said. “There will be a drastic change from the next 14 months.” Norman said the hour delay in the vote was worth it: “Absolutely. I would do it all over again.” He said his mind was eventually changed after talking with President-elect Donald Trump and Johnson, and assurances that things would change. “We had a good discussion. We had a talk with President Trump when we got in there. I never know how this stuff is going to come out, I don’t know how people are going to vote, we got together, Mike gave us his assurances, he is going to fight for the things we think are important for the country,” Norman said. Trump shored up support from the fairway: The president-elect, who publicly backed Johnson earlier this week, also talked to other key GOP holdouts before the vote was gaveled and the speaker emerged victorious. CNN’s Manu Raju reported Friday that Trump was in the middle of his golf game when he made calls for Johnson. This post has been updated with more details on Trump’s calls to lawmakers. Oklahoma GOP Rep. Tom Cole said the drama that unfolded on Capitol Hill on Friday over electing a speaker demonstrates that it’s going to be difficult to manage the House this Congress but said the positive outcome is also a “hopeful start.” “It’s going to be a challenging Congress and that’s not something new,” Cole said. “But the fact is it all got done on one ballot and that’s a lot better than 15, which is what it took last time. So, I’ll take that and I’m pleased.” Asked if he was worried critics of House Speaker Mike Johnson, who was reelected Friday, might turn on him over the course of the next two years, he said, “I worry about everything everyday. That’s just the nature of the business, but I thought this was a very hopeful start and it went very well.” Shortly after the House chose a new speaker, a New York judge upheld Donald Trump’s conviction in the hush-money case, rejecting the president-elect’s effort to throw out the jury’s verdict because of his re-election in November. New York Judge Juan Merchan set the sentencing for January 10, 2025 and said Trump can appear virtually or in person. However, in his ruling Merchan said Trump will face no legal penalties, indicating the case is essentially over. Trump was found guilty by a jury in May on 34 counts of falsifying business records. Trump lawyers did not immediately respond to a request for comment. They previously indicated they would appeal any effort to sentence him prior to Inauguration Day on January 20. A spokesperson for Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg declined to comment. The headine and the post have been updated with additional details from the ruling. Rep. Andy Biggs said Friday that President-elect Donald Trump’s endorsement of Mike Johnson was important in the House speaker’s reelection. When asked if he believes Johnson would’ve survived without Trump’s endorsement, Biggs said, “No. I think it was important.” Biggs also said he still has concerns about Johnson leading the conference but added that Trump’s endorsement was taken into consideration. “I have concerns, but President Trump said he wanted to work with Johnson, and basically — basically, that we took that into account,” Biggs said leaving the House floor. Additionally, Biggs said Johnson indicated “he’s going to work on various aspects of processes that we think need to be take place.” GOP Rep. Dusty Johnson denied on Friday that Republicans who initially resisted backing Mike Johnson for speaker received any specific commitments from him. “There wasn’t any particular deal or commitment. Nobody got anything other than Mike Johnson, who was willing to look people in the eye and tell them that we will have a more inclusive, collaborative and conservative agenda over the course of the next two years,” he told CNN’s Manu Raju. The South Dakota Republican said he didn’t want to talk about “specific asks or parts of the negotiation,” between the holdouts and leadership. “When you get the right people in the room and they want to get to yes, you absolutely can get to yes,” he said. He wouldn’t talk about “specific actions” by President-elect Donald Trump, whom CNN has reported called some last-minute holdouts before they ultimately backed the speaker. “Nobody’s got the kind of capital that President Trump does. He is clearly the captain of the football team,” he said. Rep. Keith Self, who initially cast his ballot for Florida Rep. Byron Donalds before changing his vote to House Speaker Mike Johnson, told CNN that he and Donald Trump spoke multiple times today and that they had a “lively discussion” about advancing the president-elect’s agenda. Self, who declined to provide details about the talks with Trump, said he decided to vote for Johnson because he got a commitment that GOP hardliners would be part of a major bill that Republicans want to advance using the budget process to enact aspects of the Trump agenda. “We shored up the reconciliation team because we know that this will be a heavy lift to get the Trump agenda across the line in the reconciliation package … That’s all we did,” Self said, later promising a “big, beautiful reconciliation package.” Self said the team working on the bill would include members beyond the leadership, including some members of the House Freedom Caucus, but said, “I won’t get ahead of the speaker,” when asked specifically who. Later, asked what swayed his vote, Self said he and Trump have the “same emphasis” on implementing the president-elect’s agenda. “We have got to make sure this Congress is as strong as possible when we go up against the Senate on reconciliation package, because there’s their debates on what the reconciliation package even looks like. So that’s all I wanted to do today, is to make this Congress successful for the Trump agenda,” Self said. Self said Trump did not warn him about facing a potential primary challenge over holding up Johnson’s speakership. This post has been updated with additional comments from Self. CNN’s Lauren Fox and Aileen Graef contributed reporting to this post. House Speaker Mike Johnson took his oath of office following a dramatic vote Thursday that narrowly secured him the speakership once again. Following his swearing-in, Johnson received a standing ovation from the majority of the chamber. He then administered the oath of office for all members of the House, swearing in the 119th Congress. A group of House Republicans who had been skeptical of House Speaker Mike Johnson — but ultimately came around, delivering a dramatic win on the first ballot Friday — released a letter outlining a list of demands they want Johnson to take up now that he has the speaker’s gavel. The 11 House Republicans, including Rep. Ralph Norman who was a holdout until the last minute, called on Johnson to add session days to the House calendar, ensure that any reconciliation package includes significant spending cuts, and stop putting bills on the floor that rely heavily on Democratic support, or that come ahead of the 72 hours members are allotted to review legislation. “Today we voted for Mike Johnson for Speaker of the House because of our steadfast support of President Trump and to ensure the timely certification of his electors,” the lawmakers wrote. “We did this despite our sincere reservations regarding the Speaker’s track record over the last 15 months.” Listing out their legislative priorities, the lawmakers said Johnson has “zero room for error.” House Speaker Mike Johnson said in his first remarks following his reelection to the speakership that the new Congress will “listen to the voices of the people.” “In recent months, we’ve witnessed something happening — something that’s really remarkable, a political moment in our modern history: A groundswell Americans from every state, race and religion who now demand that we put the interest of Americans first again,” Johnson said. “And we will.” Johnson also stressed that “the number one priority” under his leadership will be “defending our nation’s borders.” “In coordination with President Trump, this Congress will give our border and immigration enforcement agents the resources that they need to do their job,” Johnson outlined. “We will secure the border. We will deport dangerous, criminal, illegal aliens and finally finish building the border wall.” Johnson later in his remarks read a prayer entitled “Thomas Jefferson’s Prayer for the Nation.” “We will not fail. We cannot fail. We are all in this together. Our nation is counting on us to band together and solve these problems and get this done,” Johnson said after reading the prayer. “I’ve said before that I believe God has elevated each one of you, that is my belief, to your positions of leadership and it’s an act of providence that you’ve all been placed in your specific roles in this specific moment at this historic time.” Newly elected House Speaker Mike Johnson said it is “the great honor of his life” to serve the House and noted that it is “a momentous time” in the nation’s history. In his first remarks after being elected speaker on Friday, he noted that the 250th anniversary of the country’s founding will occur during the 119th Congress. “And in these two and a half centuries, we’ve been reminded repeatedly that freedom is never free. We have stood tall as the greatest nation on the face of the earth,” Johnson said, adding the United States was the freest and most benevolent nation that has ever been.“It’s not by happenstance. We are the ones who settled the West. We are the ones who ended slavery, who laid the transcontinental railroad, who gave women the right to vote, who won two world wars, who landed on the moon and who won the Cold War. Throughout our history, we have done what no one thought was possible. And still at 250 years old, our nation is actually a young nation.” In his first remarks after being reelected as House speaker, Rep. Mike Johnson of Louisiana called for a moment of silence to mark the New Year’s Day terrorist attack in New Orleans. “Of course, these are difficult days in our home state of Louisiana, where I come from,” Johnson said in the House. “We all know about the terrorist attack in New Orleans and it’s really shaken our state. People are reeling from that attack.” The attacker rammed a pickup truck into a crowd, which killed 14 people and injuring dozens more. President-elect Donald Trump congratulated Rep. Mike Johnson after the Republican from Louisiana was elected speaker on Friday. “Congratulations to Speaker Mike Johnson for receiving an unprecedented Vote of Confidence in Congress. Mike will be a Great Speaker, and our Country will be the beneficiary. The People of America have waited four years for Common Sense, Strength, and Leadership. They’ll get it now, and America will be greater than ever before!” Trump posted on Truth Social. The president-elect threw his support behind Johnson earlier this week. He spoke to Reps. Ralph Norman and Keith Self as Republicans worked to convince them to vote for Johnson and give him the victory on the first ballot, multiple sources told CNN. House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries urged lawmakers to “put down partisan swords and pick up bipartisan plowshares” as he introduced House Speaker Mike Johnson, who won a dramatic vote to keep the gavel. “It’s time for us to come together, not as Democrats or Republicans, but as Americans, to get things done for the people,” Jeffries said. He vowed that House Democrats would work to find common ground with Republicans “on any issue, whenever and wherever possible.” Jeffries laid out an agenda of top issues for his party, including enacting policies that benefit the middle class, lowering housing costs and securing the country’s borders. Still, with Republicans taking control of both chambers of Congress and the presidency, Jeffries warned that Democrats will “push back against far right extremism whenever necessary” and protect programs like Social Security and Medicare. “Our position is that it is not acceptable to cut Social Security, cut Medicare, cut Medicaid, cut veterans benefits, or cut nutritional assistance from children and families in order to pay for massive tax breaks for billionaires and wealthy corporations,” Jeffries said. Jeffries also acknowledged Rep. Nancy Pelosi, who was back in the chamber after breaking her hip. This post has been updated with more remarks from Jeffries. After being elected speaker of the House on the first ballot, Mike Johnson is set to face a big challenge in Congress, with the most narrow House majority in nearly 100 years. CNN Washington Bureau Chief and Political Director David Chalian says Johnson knows this. “He understands the problematic path he has ahead to get Trump’s legislative agenda through in a clean way in this first year of full Republican control in Washington,” Chalian said of Johnson after his dramatic victory Friday. Chalian said he doesn’t think voters “put too much stock in all of this.” Instead, he argued, voters “will focus a lot more on what this new unified Republican control of Washington attempts to deliver for the American people.” President-elect Donald Trump spoke to Reps. Ralph Norman and Keith Self as Republicans worked to convince them to vote for House Speaker Mike Johnson and give Johnson the victory on the first ballot, multiple sources told CNN. GOP Rep. Nancy Mace called Trump, one of the sources told CNN, who then spoke directly to the holdouts. The president-elect threw his support behind Johnson earlier this week. Trump told reporters Tuesday night that he would make calls on Johnson’s behalf to fellow Republicans, if necessary. House Speaker Mike Johnson said he did not make any promises to GOP Reps. Keith Self and Ralph Norman, who flipped their votes and allowed Johnson to clinch speakership in the first round of voting. Johnson, who could only lose one vote with the slim GOP majority, needed the support of Self and Norman as Republican Rep. Thomas Massie maintained his opposition. Rep. Andy Ogles, a Republican from Tennessee, also said that no deals were made to get Johnson’s detractors on board, adding that instead, it “was just a matter of getting it done” and a result of “persistence.” The reelected speaker told CNN that he is “ready to get to work.” In a dramatic turn of events, lawmakers have elected Mike Johnson as House speaker on the first ballot. Key GOP detractors flipped their votes to back Johnson at the last minute, after the Louisiana Republican was initially on track to lose. He ultimately won with 218 votes. While Johnson will keep the gavel, he’ll face a big challenge in Congress with the narrowest House majority in nearly 100 years. How it unfolded: After the initial roll call vote, Johnson had come up short, with three GOP defections — more than he could afford to lose. Rep. Thomas Massie had voted for Rep. Tom Emmer; Rep. Ralph Norman had voted for Rep. Jim Jordan; and Rep. Keith Self had voted for Rep. Byron Donalds. With all members voting, Johnson could only afford a single GOP defection. But after everyone had voted, the vote was held open for an extended period of time — meaning that it was not gaveled to an official close — and Johnson worked to lock down the votes. Then, Self and Norman flipped their votes in support of Johnson. This post has been updated with additional details on how the vote unfolded. The White House declined to weigh in on the unfolding fight for the House speaker’s gavel on Capitol Hill. Instead, White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre told reporters during Friday’s press briefing it was focused on the president’s domestic agenda for the remainder of his term in office. “Look, we’ve always been very clear from here, from this administration, that we do not inject ourselves into any leadership election that is happening in Congress,” she said, adding that it “doesn’t matter if it’s a Democrat or Republican, we stay out of it.” “The president is going to continue to focus on the job that he has ahead, 17 days of a jam-packed schedule, focusing on the American people. We’re going to let Congress do their business,” Jean-Pierre said. But in 2023, as the House GOP slugged it out over who would serve as speaker, White House spokesperson Andrew Bates lambasted Republicans for “falling over one another to find out who can be the most erratic and out of step with the priorities of working families.” In a statement to reporters at the time, he urged lawmakers “to get their act together and join this president at the adults table.” While Mike Johnson is on track to lose, the first round of voting in the speaker’s election has not yet been gaveled to an official close. As a result, members continue to mill around on the floor talking and having side conversations. This is one way for House GOP leadership to buy more time to try to talk to holdouts and win them over since they can’t initiate a brief recess like they would typically be able to. That’s because the new House has not yet adopted formal rules to govern itself. The only option to take a formal break would be to have the entire chamber vote to adjourn, a more complicated option than just holding this vote open longer. Rep. Stephanie Bice, an ally of Johnson, said that Reps. Ralph Norman and Keith Self are meeting with Johnson now. They both voted for another lawmaker besides Johnson during the vote. She also said that they are holding the vote open in hopes that they can change Norman and Self’s votes, and still technically have Johnson elected “on the first ballot.” Former Speaker Nancy Pelosi slowly walked onto the floor of the US Capitol on Friday, weeks after undergoing surgery for a broken hip, as dozens of lawmakers cheered and offered her a standing ovation. Democrats cheered for her again when she stood up to cast a vote for Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries in the House’s tight-margin speaker’s race. Wearing a pair of flats instead of heels, she was seen holding herself up on a table to stand and speak with members before the first vote began. Pelosi, 84, underwent a “successful” hip replacement surgery after being admitted to a hospital in Luxembourg following a fall on the stairs, CNN previously reported. The US military medevacked the former House speaker from Luxembourg to Landstuhl Regional Medical Center in Germany, according to a defense official. With House members instructed to return immediately for a second speaker vote, two of Speaker Mike Johnson’s key allies, Rep. Dusty Johnson and Bryan Steil, have been having an animated conversation with some of the Freedom Caucus members who have sought concessions from Johnson. Rep. Andy Harris, the group’s leader, spoke with Dusty Johnson for several minutes as the others looked on, with Harris repeatedly shaking his head. Meanwhile, several Republicans, including Reps. Steve Womack, Greg Murphy, Brian Fitzpatrick and Robert Aderholt ,approached Johnson on the floor after the first vote appeared to fail to offer handshakes and pats on the back. They appeared to be offering him words of encouragement, while some seemed frustrated, shaking their head at the result. While the first House speaker vote has not yet been called, Speaker Mike Johnson is on track to lose with the current breakdown, and the House is poised to go immediately into a second vote without a break. The House Democratic whip has sent a notice to members to return to the floor immediately to be ready for a second roll call vote. Multiple holdouts ultimately voted for House Speaker Mike Johnson in dramatic fashion, after initially skipping their turn in what appeared to be a short-lived protest of the speaker. Seven Republicans did not vote during the initial roll call: Reps. Andy Biggs, Andrew Clyde, Michael Cloud, Paul Gosar, Andy Harris and Chip Roy. Rep. Michael Waltz appeared to accidentally miss his turn. At the end of the roll call, all seven were given a final chance to vote and all seven voted for Johnson. One of the holdouts, Clyde, walked down the aisle to speak his vote directly to the clerk, carrying what appeared to be a Bible. One of Johnson’s whips in his speaker race, Rep. Dusty Johnson, was seen in an animated back-and-forth conversation with Roy in the back of the chamber. Rep. Dusty Johnson was also talking to Rep. Keith Self — who opposed Johnson on the floor — and Clyde. Johnson left the House chamber as it appeared likely he did not secure enough votes to keep his gavel on the first ballot. In the back of the chamber, many of the defectors continued to stand together quietly. The state of play: At this point, Johnson needs to flip Reps. Thomas Massie, Ralph Norman or Self — all who did not vote for Johnson. Further complicating matters, Norman and Self had not previously communicated their positions to the speaker, according to multiple GOP sources. Speaker Mike Johnson appears to be on track to lose the first round of voting for House speaker after losing support from at least three GOP members. Rep. Keith Self — also standing in the center of the aisle — voted for fellow Freedom Caucus member Byron Donalds. Rep. Thomas Massie of Kentucky and Rep. Ralph Norman of North Carolina also did not back Johnson, voting for Reps. Tom Emmer and Jim Jordan, respectively. Beyond the three GOP votes for other candidates, multiple Republicans initially abstained. Self has been standing near the other defections, though he has mostly been quiet and kept to himself. Another prior holdout, Rep. Victoria Spartz, voted for Johnson. Donalds told CNN ahead of the vote that lawmakers had approached him about whether he would be interested in running for speaker, but said he wasn’t entertaining the idea. Remember: Johnson could only afford a single GOP defection if every lawmaker shows up and votes. This post has been updated with additional details on the state of the vote. Republican Rep. Ralph Norman of South Carolina voted for Rep. Jim Jordan in the race for speaker of the House — making two GOP members who have voted against Mike Johnson. Rep. Thomas Massie also voted for someone else, throwing his support behind Rep. Tom Emmer. At least six Republican members so far have skipped their turn to vote, putting the chamber into suspense about whether Mike Johnson can secure the votes for speaker on the first ballot. Those members — GOP Reps. Andy Biggs, Andrew Clyde, Michael Cloud, Paul Gosar, Andy Harris and Chip Roy — all were silent when their names were called, though they will have another chance to vote at the end of the roll call. Keep in mind: As the vote was set to begin, GOP Rep. Tim Burchett vaguely predicted on X that the speaker contest would “go multiple rounds” but did not say how he planned to vote. Burchett had declined to tell reporters his position ahead of the vote, saying he was truly undecided and would “pray” on the decision. Scenes from the chamber: Biggs was standing next to Clyde and Harris — two other Freedom Caucus members who have not publicly committed to Johnson — as the clerk read his name. Biggs continued to stand, not moving or speaking, as his name was called. The next GOP member to be called, Rep. Sheri Biggs of South Carolina, voted for Johnson, who she declared to be “Trump’s endorsed candidate” — as other members in the chamber applauded. It is not clear if Gosar intentionally skipped his turn. He had been standing in the back of the chamber near fellow Freedom Caucus members Biggs and Harris. Harris intentionally chose not to vote. Two feet away from where Biggs and Burchett chatting, Harris stood silent in his spot at the back of the chamber as the clerk read his name several times. Burchett — who helped oust former Speaker Kevin McCarthy — stood in the aisle, speaking to his close friend GOP Rep. Nancy Mace, as the roll call began. He then voted for Johnson. GOP Rep. Lauren Boebert also voted for Mike Johnson: “Don’t let us down Mr. Speaker,” she said as she cast her vote. Another previously undecided member, GOP Rep. Eric Burlison, also voted for Johnson on first ballot. CNN’s Manu Raju said “this is very much a strategic decision not to vote” from the members. “They are there and decided not to vote. So the question is, Dana, they’ll have a chance to vote at the end of this process. Will they vote yes or will they continue to hold out?” Raju told CNN’s Dana Bash. Track the House speaker vote here. This post has been updated with additional GOP members who skipped their turn. GOP Rep. Thomas Massie of Kentucky did not vote for Mike Johnson for the House speakership, upholding his vow not to back Johnson. Johnson faces tough vote math with the narrowest House majority in nearly 100 years, leaving little room for error. Massie instead voted for GOP Rep. Tom Emmer of Minnesota, the House majority whip who expressed confidence earlier Friday that Johnson will hold on to the gavel. As majority whip, Emmer has experience with keeping the GOP’s narrow majority in line. In January 2023, Emmer helped hammer out the negotiations between the 20 hardliners and the speaker’s office that eventually won former Speaker Kevin McCarthy the gavel after 15 ballots, according to former Republican Rep. Patrick McHenry. Following McCarthy’s historic ouster, Emmer sought the speakership himself, eventually withdrawing his bid, which paved the way for Johnson to clinch the post. The House is voting now to elect its speaker, as Rep. Mike Johnson is vying to retain the gavel. He faces tough vote math with the narrowest House majority in nearly 100 years, leaving little room for error. Johnson, who was backed by President-elect Donald Trump, can only afford a single GOP defection if every lawmaker shows up and votes, and one House Republican — Rep. Thomas Massie of Kentucky — has already said he won’t vote for him. How many votes are needed for Johnson to win: To be elected speaker, a candidate must win a majority of votes out of all votes cast. If all 435 members of the House vote, then a majority is 218 votes. There is expected to be one vacancy when the House convenes for the vote. Former GOP Rep. Matt Gaetz of Florida has said he won’t take the seat he was elected to in the new Congress. That leaves 434 members with 219 Republicans and 215 Democrats. If all 434 vote, it takes 218 to win. Track the House speaker vote here. As GOP Rep. Lisa McClain formally nominated Speaker Mike Johnson, most of the Republican conference gave him a standing ovation. But several House Republicans — Reps. Tim Burchett, Andy Biggs and Eli Crane — remained seated through the speech and the standing ovation, though they were still seen clapping, at times, for Johnson from their seats. Democratic Rep. Pete Aguilar of California, who is the Democratic caucus chair, is delivering a nominating speech for Democratic leader Hakeem Jeffries for speaker. The nomination comes as House Speaker Mike Johnson faces a critical vote soon in his attempts to retain the speakership. “There is only one leader who understands the needs of the working people and has lived the American dream himself, and is committed to ensuring its promise for future generations,” Aguilar said. “There is only one leader who knows how to negotiate a bipartisan deal and then stick to that deal. House Democrats are united behind the most powerful legislative leader in this chamber, Hakeem Jeffries of Brooklyn.” Aguilar vowed to work with the upcoming administration, while highlighting the importance of House Democrats in passing legislation. “We will work with the incoming administration to make life better, safer and more affordable for working families,” Aguilar said. GOP Rep. Lisa McClain of Michigan nominated Rep. Mike Johnson for House speaker. Johnson, the current speaker, is looking to keep the gavel. Johnson was endorsed by President-elect Donald Trump, but he could be presented with a challenge given the narrow House GOP majority. Republicans are set to take over control of the House and the Senate. McClain, who is the party’s conference chair, said this — with Johnson as speaker — gives lawmakers the opportunity to “put America first again.” McClain defended Johnson, saying, “None of us will get exactly what we want.” “Over 14 months ago, Mike Johnson took on a daunting task. No speaker is perfect and no one will ever be. However, achieving perfection requires incremental gains and hard decisions along the way,” she said, calling on Republicans to rally around Johnson. McClain also defended Johnson’s principles and values, saying he “knows our brightest days are still ahead of us” and expressed confidence that Johnson will “lead us through another successful Republican majority.” This post has been updated with additional remarks. Democratic Rep. Hank Johnson of Georgia was not present during the quorum call, but has arrived, according to a Democratic source. He will be able to vote for House speaker. Why this is key: This means that the expected majority threshold will be 218 and Johnson will only be able to lose one GOP vote against him if all other lawmakers vote. Senators were sworn in alphabetically, in groups, by Vice President Kamala Harris, and then signed the oath book. Some were escorted by former senators from their state, or by the outgoing senator who they were replacing. Sen. Bernie Moreno of Ohio was escorted by Vice President-elect JD Vance. West Virginia Gov. Jim Justice was not sworn in to the Senate today. He announced on December 26 that he will remain the governor of his state until next week, when Governor-elect Patrick Morrisey is sworn in. In an apparent bid to win over detractors ahead of the speaker vote, House Speaker Mike Johnson posted to X that he will set up a working group for spending and government reform, among other commitments. This appears to be in response to demands from GOP Rep. Victoria Spartz and other GOP holdouts. Johnson’s vow does not include any specific commitments on legislation on the floor or committee rosters. He has repeatedly said he would not make private deals to win votes. Johnson’s public commitment comes as several undecided GOP members have been getting into line behind the speaker in the minutes before the vote. And Spartz posted to X in response to Johnson’s post saying, “I appreciate @SpeakerJohnson’s public commitment to the American people to deliver on President Trump’s agenda and drain the swamp.” Vice President Kamala Harris has called for the Senate to come to order, as the 119th Congress opens on Friday. Former senators, current senators and soon-to-be senators flooded the chamber on Friday, including former Majority Leader Trent Lott, and former Sens. Rob Portman, Dean Heller, and Bob Corker. Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer shook hands with incoming Senate Republican Leader John Thune just before Chaplain Barry Black led the Senate in prayer. Black is returning to the Senate for the first time since he suffered a brain bleed last month. Ahead of the Senate being called to order, senators milled about and caught up with current and former colleagues. When now former-Sen. Tom Carper introduced Sen. Mitch McConnell to Sen. Lisa Blunt Rochester, McConnell shook her hand warmly and told her, “I hope you learn to love the Senate.” Thune also huddled with McConnell on the floor for a few minutes before the proceedings. GOP Rep. Tim Burchett said he thinks voting for speaker of the House will go into multiple rounds. “I think it doesn’t really matter what I, what I’m going to do. I think you’ll see members pass, and then we’ll go into another round,” he said. Burchett would not disclose which members have told him how they are voting or how he would vote but did say some are still going vote no. As lawmakers enter the chamber ahead of the speaker’s vote, at least two House Republicans who had raised concerns about Mike Johnson now tell CNN they will support him. GOP Rep. Eli Crane told CNN he will be supporting Johnson because President-elect Donald Trump backs him, indicating that Trump’s endorsement has a lot of weight. “I’m going to support the president,” Crane told CNN, confirming that meant he would support Johnson. GOP Rep. Greg Steube also told CNN he will support Johnson as he walked onto the floor. There are still a number of holdouts who have not said publicly how they will vote, but Crane and Steube are an early indication that Republicans could fall in line and keep Johnson as their speaker. Remember: To be elected speaker, a candidate must win a majority of votes out of all votes cast. There is one vacancy expected when the House convenes — with former GOP Rep. Matt Gaetz saying he won’t take the seat he was elected to in the new Congress — leaving 434 members, with 219 Republicans and 215 Democrats. If all 434 vote, it takes 218 to win. Republican Rep. Thomas Massie of Kentucky has already said he won’t vote for Johnson, appearing to leave no further room for error. A packed House chamber was buzzing in anticipation Friday as new and returning members greeted each other ahead of the speaker’s vote. Many brought their families, with at least two dozen babies and kids, some clutching teddy bears, seen in the chamber. Speaker Mike Johnson personally waved hello to a group of young children in the well of the chamber shortly after he entered. Several of Johnson’s holdouts huddled near the back of the chamber. This includes Rep. Chip Roy, Andy Ogles, Eli Crane, Andrew Clyde and Scott Perry. Many of them are seated together. As expected, Democrats have full attendance, according to a leadership source. As former Speaker Nancy Pelosi slowly walked onto the floor weeks after her hip surgery, dozens of Democrats cheered and offered her a standing ovation. House Speaker Mike Johnson told reporters ahead of the speaker’s vote that he believes he has the votes to hold onto his job and said he plans to stick it out even if it takes multiple rounds. “I think we are there. We’ll find out very soon” Johnson said when asked about the whip count. Johnson brushed off the idea that he couldn’t clinch the votes on the first round, telling reporters, “It says nothing it’s part of the process but I expect we’ll will get it done.” Johnson said President-elect Donald Trump has been helpful as he has tried to win over House Republicans. “Well you’ve seen his public statements, I think privately he’s talked with members,” Johnson said. Vowing to stick it out, regardless of how many rounds of voting it takes, Johnson said, “We have to get this job done and unify the Congress. And I’m here for the long haul.” Johnson reiterated that he hasn’t made any side deals with lawmakers to secure their votes: “I have made no deals with anyone. And I’m very proud to say that.” GOP Rep. Steve Womack warned on Friday morning of the stakes if the House GOP conference fails to quickly elect Mike Johnson to be speaker. “There will be many an opportunity over the course of the next several months as we prosecute an agenda to stumble, shoot ourselves in the foot. We can’t rely on help from the left so we’ve got to carry this on our own,” he told CNN. He said Republicans have a chance to project unity today by electing Johnson in one round of votes. “Put it in the bank and move on to our legislative agenda,” he said. Pressed by Raju on what message it would send if it takes more than one round of votes to select a speaker, Womack answered “that we’re not ready to govern. That the people of America have given us this opportunity and that we’re not prepared for it.” CNN has reported Johnson’s team has been growing increasingly optimistic that he’ll ultimately get the necessary votes and believe conversations with holdouts are headed in the right direction. Central to their argument is the need to be able to quickly certify the election and execute on Trump’s agenda, especially with a narrow margin. GOP Rep. Thomas Massie of Kentucky, who is currently the sole public “no” vote against House Speaker Mike Johnson, said if one other member votes against him, it will “embolden half a dozen more” in a second vote. “I’d say there’s a 70% chance Mike Johnson is going to be speaker, that everybody but me will eventually vote for him, even though they know he’s the wrong guy, because that’s just the way the swamp works,” Massie told host Steve Deace on “The Glenn Beck Program.” “If one more person joins me, I think that will embolden half a dozen more. And I think the second round he loses more votes. The third round he loses more votes. President Trump calls him up, says Mike, I thought you were the guy, turns out you’re not the guy, step out of the way,” he said. “I think Mike will keep trying until Trump tells him to give up,” he added. Trump has publicly endorsed Johnson, and allies have indicated he won’t have patience for a dragged out process. Massie said that if Johnson fails to keep the gavel, Republicans could elect a new speaker tonight or over the weekend, saying “there are at least three qualified candidates.” “I’m not going anywhere. I have plans to stay here this weekend. We’re going to be right back here on Monday,” the Kentucky lawmaker said. Massie declined to name the alternative candidates he would support, but rejected the notion that Johnson is the only one who can earn support of 218 members. “Given that I’m a lightning rod, I don’t want to transfer that lightning to a candidate, and then they’ll be ‘persona non grata’ and be disqualified by virtue of me calling their name right here on your radio show,” Massie said. “It’s ridiculous to say that Mike Johnson, out of 219 Republicans is the only one who can be elected to speaker and that’s why we should elect him.” The new Congress will start at noon ET on January 3, and the first major item of business in the House is to elect a speaker. This happens before members are even sworn in. Before voting can start, candidates must be nominated. GOP Rep. Lisa McClain of Michigan is expected to give a nominating speech for Johnson, and Democratic Rep. Pete Aguilar of California is expected to give a nominating speech for House Democratic leader Hakeem Jeffries. But any member can nominate anyone, so additional candidates could be nominated. During the vote, a clerk will call on members by name in alphabetical order and each will have the chance to say which candidate they support. This is also when members could opt to say “present” instead of voting for a candidate. At the end, any members who did not vote will be given the opportunity to do so, and if any member wants to change their vote, they can. How many votes Johnson needs to win: Mike Johnson is vying to retain the gavel and has President-elect Donald Trump’s endorsement, but he faces tough vote math with the narrowest House majority in nearly 100 years, leaving little room for error. Johnson can only afford a single GOP defection if every lawmaker shows up and votes, and one House Republican. To be elected speaker, a candidate must win a majority of votes out of all votes cast. If all 435 members of the House vote, then a majority is 218 votes. There is expected to be one vacancy when the House convenes for the vote. Former GOP Rep. Matt Gaetz of Florida has said he won’t take the seat he was elected to in the new Congress. That leaves 434 members with 219 Republicans and 215 Democrats. If all 434 vote, it takes 218 to win. Johnson’s allies are projecting confidence he’ll be able to secure the speakership, but even they are bracing for the possibility that it could go into multiple rounds of voting, leading to a drawn-out floor fight. House Speaker Mike Johnson and his allies have been increasingly optimistic throughout the morning on Friday, as no other GOP lawmakers, besides Rep. Thomas Massie, have communicated to the speaker’s office they will definitively oppose him on the floor, according to multiple GOP sources. While Republican leadership is not ruling out potential drama given the historically narrow margins for securing the speakership, there is rising confidence Johnson will secure the gavel by the end of day Friday. Even one of Johnson’s holdouts — GOP Rep. Andy Ogles — predicted that Johnson would keep his gavel on Friday, and the only question was how many ballots it would take. The upbeat tone is notable from Ogles, who said he will not publicly reveal whether he plans to support Johnson on the floor. “I think Mike’s gonna be fine,” the Tennessee lawmaker said. “It just depends if it’s gonna be one or three” ballots. Ogles, a member of the House Freedom Caucus, is among a group of members pushing for commitments from Johnson in the 119th Congress. Asked about his personal priorities, Ogles said he wants Congress to pay for any emergency spending, such as natural disaster relief or international aid. “I’d say one of the biggest things is any supplemental, there needs to be a pay-for,” Ogles said. Republican Rep. Jim Jordan exuded optimism about the vote, saying he thought it would take one ballot. “I think so, I think probably Thomas is, as far as I know, Thomas is the only ‘no’ vote,” he said, referring to Massie. Remember: To be elected speaker, a candidate must win a majority of votes out of all votes cast. There is one vacancy expected when the House convenes — with former GOP Rep. Matt Gaetz saying he won’t take the seat he was elected to in the new Congress — leaving 434 members, with 219 Republicans and 215 Democrats. If all 434 vote, it takes 218 to win. This post has been updated with additional details. New Senate Majority Leader John Thune will stress his commitment to preserving the 60 votes threshold to overcome a filibuster on legislation, according to excerpts provided by his office from his maiden speech expected to be delivered on the floor at about 1 p.m. ET. “And one of my priorities as leader will be to ensure that the Senate stays the Senate,” the Republican from South Dakota will say. “That means preserving the legislative filibuster – the Senate rule that today has perhaps the greatest impact in preserving the Founders’ vision of the Senate.” Remember: President-elect Donald Trump and Senate Democrats have pushed to weaken the filibuster for bills as has already happened for nominations and Thune could face pressure from Trump to ditch it if Democrats are able to block bills on the floor. “It also means restoring the Senate as a place of discussion and deliberation,” Thune will say. Below are additional excerpts from his speech highlighting his priorities in the new Congress: “That includes empowering committees, restoring regular order, and engaging in extended debate on the Senate floor, where all members should have a chance to make their voices – and the voices of their constituents – heard.” Walking into House Speaker Mike Johnson’s office moments ago, House Majority Whip Tom Emmer was confident Johnson has the votes to keep the gavel. “Yep, oh yeah,” the Minnesota Republican said, when asked by CNN. To be elected speaker, Johnson must win a majority of votes out of all votes cast. There is expected to be one vacancy when the House convenes for the vote. Former GOP Rep. Matt Gaetz of Florida has said he won’t take the seat he was elected to in the new Congress. That leaves 434 members with 219 Republicans and 215 Democrats. If all 434 vote, it takes 218 to win. Johnson can only afford a single GOP defection if every lawmaker shows up and votes, and one House Republican — Rep. Thomas Massie of Kentucky — has already said he won’t vote for him, while roughly a dozen more have not committed to supporting him. West Virginia Gov. Jim Justice will not be sworn in to the US Senate today. According to an announcement released over the holidays, he has decided to delay his swearing in until after Governor-elect Patrick Morrissey is sworn in, in order to preserve the “continuity of government.” Morrisey will be sworn in on January 13. GOP Sen. Shelley Moore Capito praised Justice’s decision, saying in a statement: “I very much respect Governor Justice’s decision to honor his commitment to complete his term as Governor of the State of West Virginia.” “I am looking forward to serving with Senator Justice as there is much to do to advance President Trump’s agenda on behalf of all West Virginians,” she added. Given that decision, 99 senators will be sworn in this week, not 100. Rep. Mark Amodei, a Republican from Nevada who backs House Speaker Mike Johnson, tells CNN he predicts a few rounds of voting in the speaker’s race today but ultimately believes Johnson will prevail — if for no other reason than Republicans know what a drawn-out contest can cost the party. “Just the nature of this. So that’s fine. It will take two or three,” he said of his prediction for how many rounds it takes for Johnson to win. Amodei warns that President-elect Donald Trump won’t be patient with members who want to drag this out. He believes Trump’s influence could go a long way to shoring up support for Johnson. “Nobody comes to mind,” he said, when asked if there was someone better for the job. “I think his demeanor is something that is an absolute benefit,” he said, adding “there is no heir apparent.” “Finding an heir apparent would be phenomenally time-consuming — we know from experience — so therefore, at the end of the day, I think he’s your guy.” He also warned against making GOP Rep. Chip Roy — a holdout who has publicly criticized Johnson — the Rules Committee chairman, an idea that has been floated by some members of the conference, arguing he hasn’t proven to be a cooperative member on the committee so far, as he often votes against rules. Ahead of today’s House speaker vote, President-elect Donald Trump praised Mike Johnson to CNN and indicated that he is confident that Johnson will be successful. “I think the speaker will do very well. He’s a fine man. He’s a very fine individual, he’s religious, he’s smart, he’s strong. Everybody likes him. Everybody respects him,” Trump said in a brief phone interview. The president-elect confirmed CNN’s reporting that he had been in touch with Republican holdouts, including GOP Rep. Chip Roy. When asked what he was telling these Republicans, Trump said he wasn’t “telling them anything.” “I’m just saying, Look, we had the greatest presidential election. We won the popular vote by millions of votes. We had a great, we had a great election, and it would be nice to cement the election with an election here. I mean, that would just be a big, beautiful exclamation point,” he said. When asked specifically about his conversations with Roy, Trump noted that he thought “Chip Roy will do what’s right for the country” and said he would be watching the vote today. In an indication that he is all in for Johnson, Trump said there was no one else he was eyeing for speaker at this time should it not work out, reiterating that he thinks Johnson will be successful. The 119th Congress begins today, ushering in a new era of Republican control in Washington that will start with a high-stakes leadership fight to pick the next House speaker. Mike Johnson is vying to retain the gavel and has President-elect Donald Trump’s endorsement, but he faces tough vote math with the narrowest House majority in nearly 100 years, leaving little room for error. Johnson can only afford a single GOP defection if every lawmaker shows up and votes, and one House Republican — Rep. Thomas Massie of Kentucky — has already said he won’t vote for him, while roughly a dozen more have not committed to supporting him. Looming over the race is the question of what happens if the House has not yet elected a speaker by Monday, January 6, the day lawmakers are supposed to count electoral votes and finalize the results of the presidential election — a scenario that would put Congress into unprecedented territory. How many votes to win? To be elected speaker, a candidate must win a majority of votes out of all votes cast. If all 435 members of the House vote, then a majority is 218 votes. There is expected to be one vacancy when the House convenes for the vote. Former GOP Rep. Matt Gaetz of Florida has said he won’t take the seat he was elected to in the new Congress. That leaves 434 members with 219 Republicans and 215 Democrats. If all 434 vote, it takes 218 to win. But if any members do not vote or vote “present” — which is not really a vote at all — the number needed to win can go down. That’s because absences and “present” votes do not count toward the overall total used to calculate the majority threshold. A defiant Speaker Mike Johnson said he is unwilling to “make deals” with fellow Republicans to secure votes, taking a dramatically different strategy than his predecessor Kevin McCarthy just hours before the vote to secure the gavel. “My simple message to my colleagues is, make suggestions about process improvements, we’re open to that at all times. But I don’t make deals with anyone. There’s no quid for pro here. I don’t do anything in exchange for a vote,” Johnson said to reporters outside his office. The Louisiana Republican is making clear that he will not engage in side deals – such as the suggestion from some conservatives that one holdout, GOP Rep. Chip Roy, should take over the powerful House Rules Committee. In recent days, the speaker has been having conversations with the roughly half dozen GOP holdouts about process deforms – such as voting on single-issue spending bills or reforming the suspension calendar. The Freedom Caucus, in particular, has a list of demands related to cutting spending and chamber processes. But Johnson insists he will not be making specific commitments, marking a wholly different approach than McCarthy. If he succeeds, it would leave Johnson without the tradeoffs that McCarthy made to secure his gavel two years ago – which ultimately weakened him enough to coat McCarthy his gavel. Instead, Johnson is making the argument that backing him for speaker will mean supporting President-elect Donald Trump. “I’m talking with all members and telling them we need to unify so we can move the Trump agenda,” Johnson told reporters. Speaker Mike Johnson will face a major challenge in the new Congress – the narrowest House majority in nearly 100 years. That is, if he can keep the gavel. Republicans will soon control the House, Senate and White House. But thin margins could imperil President-elect Donald Trump’s agenda. And Johnson has little room for error when the House votes on Friday to elect a speaker for the new Congress. Republicans won 220 House seats in the November elections, while Democrats won 215, the most narrowly divided House majority since the outset of the Great Depression, almost a century ago. And the margin is set to quickly shrink even further. When the House convenes, the partisan breakdown is expected to be 219 to 215 since former GOP Rep. Matt Gaetz of Florida has said he’s not returning to Congress. From there, the majority is on track to drop to 217 to 215 with two GOP lawmakers expected to join the Trump administration. At that point, House Republicans would not be able to afford a single defection to pass legislation along party lines until the vacancies are filled. Read the full story here.

Jim Jordan told Fox News “I think so,” when asked if he thinks Johnson will have the votes to remain speaker in today’s vote. Jordan said House Republicans need to get past the speaker vote to “do what we told the American people we were going to do.” Meanwhile, Louisiana GOP Rep. Mark Green predicted on Friday on “CBS Mornings” that the speaker vote today “will come down to a razor wire finish.” “People are out there negotiating,” Green said. “When we have a super thin majority, it’s really tough to get a speaker elected, as we saw last Congress.” When asked if he thought any of his other colleagues besides Johnson would want the job, Green responded “most of the folks I talk to that are super confident would not want the job, especially with this majority,” adding “this is the toughest job in America, I am convinced of that.” Tennessee GOP Rep. Tim Burchett told CNBC’s “Squawk Box” he’s still undecided on whether he’ll vote for Johnson as speaker, stating “I’ll be praying about it and I’ll make my decision according to that.” “Mike’s in a really tough position. Anybody in that position outside of being a single mom I can’t think of any job tougher in this country than being speaker of the House,” Burchett said, acknowledging Johnson’s balancing act between conservative members and members from swing districts. House speaker elections on Friday are less about Mike Johnson and more about Donald Trump. Johnson’s frantic fight to hold onto his job was still a cliffhanger heading into a fateful day for Republicans. But the president-elect has even more on the line – nothing less than his push for a fast start to his second presidency and promise to deliver massive change. If Trump fails to lift Johnson over the line, he will sow new doubts about his capacity to effectively lead the GOP trifecta of power in the House, Senate and White House. The convening of the 119th Congress, therefore, represents the first day of Washington’s new Trump era with Republicans aiming to produce tangible results as soon as he steps back into the Oval Office on January 20. The nation’s new leaders plan sweeping overhauls of immigration policy and big tax cuts using complex maneuvers required to overcome Democratic filibusters in the Senate. Such moves will demand unity and political dexterity for which the House GOP is hardly renowned. But before they can do anything, House Republicans must elect a speaker, an often routine task that is deeply perilous for Johnson because of the tiny majority that means he can lose only one vote in his fractious party if every lawmaker turns up. If Republicans can’t select a speaker by Monday, they won’t even be able to initiate the congressional process to certify Trump’s election victory — a spectacle that would be sure to infuriate and embarrass the president-elect. Read the full analysis. House Judiciary Chair Jim Jordan told CNN that he believes GOP Rep. Thomas Massie of Kentucky could be the only person willing to vote against House Speaker Mike Johnson on the floor on Friday. “The only ‘no’ right now is Thomas and I think it may stay that way,” Jordan, a Republican from Ohio, told CNN. Asked about his message to the holdouts, Jordan stressed that GOP unity in the speaker’s race would allow the party to enact President-elect Donald Trump’s agenda. “The best way for us to accomplish what the people elected us to do is to get after it right away. The best way to get that done is to make sure Mike’s speaker and get moving,” Jordan said. Jordan didn’t rule out supporting process reforms that some of the holdouts are seeking from Johnson. “I’ve got to see all the details on that,” Jordan said when asked about reforms such as changes to the suspension calendar. “That’s largely between the speaker and the members. It’s all about getting the votes and getting down to work.” With the start of the 119th Congress on Friday, GOP Sen. Tim Scott of South Carolina will become the longest-serving Black senator in the United States. Scott will also serve as the first Black chairman of a Senate standing committee, leading the Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs Committee, where he previously served as Ranking Member. “As we begin the 119th Congress, Senate Republicans have high enthusiasm and are focused on delivering for the American people! This Congress, I am thrilled to serve as the Chairman of the Senate Banking Committee and the National Republican Senatorial Committee,” Scott said in a statement to CNN. He continued, “My goal is simple: make America work for Americans. As we get to work cleaning up the mess from the previous administration, I look forward to working with President Trump on his priorities, including paving a path for all Americans to have the necessary tools and resources to achieve their version of the American Dream. We will unlock opportunity, strengthen our nation, and make America the shining city on the Hill again.” Scott is one of only 12 Black senators to serve in the United States Senate. Currently, Scott is the only Black Republican in the Senate, while there are two Black Democratic senators: Sen. Cory Booker and Sen. Raphael Warnock. Two Black Democratic Senators, Sens.-elect Angela Alsobrooks and Lisa Blunt Rochester, will also be sworn in Friday. President-elect Donald Trump took to social media to post in support of Speaker Mike Johnson ahead of today’s critical speakership vote. “Good luck today for Speaker Mike Johnson, a fine man of great ability, who is very close to having 100% support. A win for Mike today will be a big win for the Republican Party, and yet another acknowledgment of our 129 year most consequential Presidential Election!! - A BIG AFFIRMATION, INDEED. MAGA!” Trump posted. Remember: Trump endorsed Johnson earlier this week, though the Republican from Louisiana faces a tough fight to retain the gavel, highlighting a test of the president-elect’s influence over his party amid the limits of an extraordinarily narrow majority. Trump’s endorsement could help Johnson shore up support, especially after the speaker navigated a chaotic government funding fight earlier this month that drew the ire of his right flank. But with a historically small majority in the new Congress, Johnson can afford only a single Republican defection when the House picks a new speaker if every member votes. House Speaker Mike Johnson told reporters he hopes to win on one ballot today, even as multiple GOP lawmakers remain uncommitted. “I think so,” Johnson said, when asked by reporters if he expected to win on the first ballot. When pressed on if he’d be willing to make Republican Rep. Chip Roy the rules committee chairman, something members of the hardline House Freedom Caucus have been pushing, Johnson was definitive saying he is “not making side deals with anybody.” House lawmakers will vote today on whether to re-elect Johnson as their majority leader. Johnson’s allies are projecting confidence he’ll be able to secure the speakership, but even they are bracing for the possibility that it could go into multiple rounds of voting, leading to a drawn-out floor fight. Johnson can only afford a single GOP defection if every lawmaker shows up and votes, and one House Republican - Rep. Thomas Massie of Kentucky - has already said he won’t vote for him, while roughly a dozen more have not committed to supporting him. This post has been updated with additional details. Mike Johnson has been engaged in a flurry of talks with GOP hardliners who have made a series of demands as they hold out their support ahead of Friday’s critical vote to elect the next speaker. But unlike Kevin McCarthy, who won the gavel in 2023 after a 15-ballot marathon following a furious round of horse-trading, Johnson is resisting cutting side-deals to secure the speakership, according to his allies. The speaker is “not inclined to negotiate or make backroom-side deals,” a leadership source told CNN. Whether that posture changes remains to be seen since Johnson’s allies are uncertain whether he can win the speakership on the first ballot on Friday. Many of the decisions on what — if any — deals need to be cut will be made once vote-counting begins and the speaker and his team get a clear sense of which Republicans are withholding their support. So far, Rep. Thomas Massie is the lone Republican to announce his opposition to Johnson, who can’t afford to lose any more Republicans assuming all House members in attendance back a specific candidate. But others are expressing serious reservations, such as Reps. Chip Roy and Victoria Spartz, while a handful of other members remain non-committal. If Johnson fails to win on the first vote, the House could proceed to a second vote immediately after. If Johnson fails again on a second ballot, it’s uncertain if they’d try to recess the chamber to hold private meetings over how to proceed since the House cannot legislate until a speaker is selected. They could also decide to continue to vote on the floor. Among the demands hardliners are making including commitments on how government funding bills will be handled, assurances that new spending will be offset with cuts, further changes to a new House rules package, and the ability to have more sway in the legislative process. Beginning at 12 p.m. ET on January 3, the new Congress begins with a series of formalities in the House of Representatives. Below are key highlights of what to expect: Initial order of events in the House: How the speaker election works: If Johnson is elected on the first ballot If Johnson is not elected on the first ballot President-elect Donald Trump said on Monday that Speaker Mike Johnson has his “complete” and “total” endorsement, a major boost for the top House Republican ahead of the critical vote Friday. Trump’s endorsement comes as some House conservatives have warned they are not committed to backing Johnson in the speaker’s race. The President-elect’s endorsement could help Johnson lock down the votes he will need, especially after he navigated a chaotic government funding fight earlier this month that drew the ire of some members of his right flank. But Johnson faces an extraordinary narrow margin and can only lose a single Republican vote to still win the gavel, leaving little room for error. Trump praised Johnson on Monday, saying he is “hard working” and “will do the right thing.” “The American people need IMMEDIATE relief from all of the destructive policies of the last Administration. Speaker Mike Johnson is a good, hard working, religious man. He will do the right thing, and we will continue to WIN. Mike has my Complete & Total Endorsement. MAGA!!!,” Trump said in a post on Truth Social. More context: After Johnson cut a deal with Democrats over spending in mid-December, Trump injected a last-minute demand to raise the debt ceiling that left Johnson grasping for a plan B. A revised GOP plan ultimately failed to get enough Republican votes to pass and caused grumbling among Johnson’s right flank that the speaker wasn’t up to the job. It also caused some to wonder if Trump would stick with Johnson ahead of the speaker fight. Republican Sen. John Thune of South Dakota will be the next leader of his party in the chamber and the key ally of Mitch McConnell will be tasked with shepherding the agenda of President-elect Donald Trump through Congress. In choosing Thune — who has served as minority whip, the No. 2 role in GOP Senate leadership — Republicans elevated a leader associated with the establishment wing of the party over Florida Sen. Rick Scott, who was championed by several prominent Trump allies, including Elon Musk, Vivek Ramaswamy and Tucker Carlson. The election was conducted by secret ballot, which might have allowed Republicans wary of offending Trump’s most ardent supporters some political protection. Sen. John Cornyn of Texas, another McConnell ally, also vied for the leadership post. Thune, won the vote — which was conducted in November — 29-24 in the second round of voting against Cornyn and he will be sworn in on January 3. McConnell, who has led Senate Republicans since 2007, announced in February that he would step down as GOP leader this year. Immediately, Thune will be swept into a controversy brewing over Trump’s demand that the upper chamber use recess appointments to install his nominees, bypassing the formal advice and consent confirmation process, which historically has allowed the minority party to block a president’s picks. The three Republican senators who vied for majority leader all publicly supported Trump’s demand following his election victory. Thune, 63, has had a complicated relationship with the president-elect. He called for Trump to drop out of the 2016 race in the wake of the infamous “Access Hollywood” scandal — though Thune later said he still planned to vote for Trump. And he condemned Trump’s actions surrounding the January 6, 2021, Capitol riot as indefensible. Still, when Trump faced a vote in the Senate following his impeachment over the incident, Thune sided with McConnell and most of the Republican caucus in voting “not guilty.” Read more about Thune. © 2025 Cable News Network.

                "title": "Johnson elected US House speaker in close vote ",
                "content": "Republican Mike Johnson survived a razor-thin vote to remain House Speaker in a drama-filled, highly-anticipated vote that marked the start of complete Republican control in Washington. Johnson could only afford to lose two votes because of the tight margin of control Republicans have in Congress. While he came close to losing re-election, he survived the vote after some lobbying. President-elect Donald Trump previously endorsed Johnson for the role of House speaker, saying \"a win for Mike today will be a big win for the Republican Party\". The House Speaker is one of the most powerful posts in Washington, controlling the lower chamber of the US Congress, and second in line to the presidency after the vice president. Johnson, a Louisiana Republican, was backed by nearly all Republicans in his bid for re-election. But that success was not without some controversary. The vote for Speaker requires a candidate to receive the support of a majority of the House - 218 votes. But because of a razor-thin Republican majority in the House, Johnson could only stand to face opposition from two Republicans. Johnson already faced one hard \"no\" from Congressman Thomas Massie of Kentucky. \"You can pull all my fingernails out. You can shove bamboo up in them. You can start cutting off my fingers. I am not voting for Mike Johnson,\" Massie said Thursday in a television interview. Several other Republicans had put themselves in the \"undecided\" column heading into the vote. During the initial votes, three of those undecided Republicans voted for other lawmakers over Johnson, preventing him from reaching the 218 votes he needed. Three lawmakers - Massie, South Carolina Congressman Ralph Norman and Texas Congressman Keith Self - named other options to serve as the next speaker. That led Johnson to flee the House floor and lobby members to back him. Some 45 minutes later, he returned to the House chamber. Both Norman and Self changed their votes to back Johnson. The gavel struck and Johnson won re-election. Norman told reporters after the election that he changed his vote after speaking with Johnson in a room outside the House chamber. He said Johnson told him there would be more conservatives at the table during negotiations, fewer deals made between congressional and committee leadership without outside input from other lawmakers and enough time to read bill text before votes are scheduled. \"When we left that small room, he convinced me and Keith (Self),\" Norman said. \"He (Johnson) said I will do that, just give me the chance. He knew and I knew if it went to the second ballot it was going to get tougher and tougher.\" Another player got involved throughout the tense speaker election - President-elect Donald Trump. Norman spoke with Trump twice during the speaker vote. The first time was when fellow Republican Nancy Mace of South Carolina handed him her phone to speak with the president-elect. The second was while meeting with Johnson, Self and several others. \"(Trump) is as enthusiastic,\" Norman said of the call with the presidnet-elect. \"He said, 'Norman, we have the most opportunity we've ever had - the House, Senate, a trifecta, you don't get that opportunity.' I said, 'Mr. President I agree with you, I'm just hoping Mike has got the oomph to pull this off.\" Norman said the president-elect also said Johnson is the only one who has the likeability to win the speaker election. Self told reporters after the vote that he spoke with Trump before and after the speaker election. He said he changed his mind when Johnson pledged there would be more members, including from the far-right House Freedom Caucus, at the negotiating table. \"We shored up the reconciliation team because we know that this will be a heavy lift to get the Trump agenda across the line in the reconciliation line,\" he said. Friday marked the first day of the 119th Congress. Republicans have unified control of Washington, with majorities in both the House and Senate and with Trump returning to the White House later in January. During his acceptance speech, Johnson said that this Congress would champion the idea of America first - a slogan promoted by Trump. After Trump's re-election, he said Americans are demanding their interests are put first again. \"And we will,\" Johnson said. Voting in a new speaker is the first requirement of the new session of Congress, and without that leader in place, the chamber cannot move on to any other function. This has led to chaos in the past - including when former House Speaker Kevin McCarthy had to go through 15 rounds of voting before he was confirmed to the leadership post. Minutes before the vote on Friday, Johnson posted on X several of his plans, if elected. He promised to create a \"working group comprised of independent experts\" to work with the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) that Trump named Tesla CEO Elon Musk and Republican Vivek Ramaswamy to lead. That working group, he said, would review existing audits of federal agencies and entities created by Congress and issue a report. \"If we want to restore fiscal responsibility, we must start by being transparent about the dollars that are spent, address the issues we find, and then hold those accountable who have misspent funds,\" Johnson wrote. Biden decided to scrap the deal despite concerns that it could damage Washington's relations with Tokyo. The US president-elect dismisses the case as \"nothing but a rigged charade\". An American college football player, a young aspiring nurse and a mother of a four-year-old are among the victims. The family of London man Edward Pettifer mourn a \"wonderful son, brother, grandson, nephew and friend\". Friday's vote underscores the challenges for Trump in keeping House Republicans united to legislate his agenda. Copyright 2025 BBC. All rights reserved.

Human metapneumovirus most often causes symptoms similar to a cold, but some people can get very sick. You’re more likely to get severely sick the first time you get HMPV, which is why young kids have a greater risk for serious illness. You get some protection (immunity) from your first infection and then are more likely to have mild, cold-like symptoms if you get another HMPV infection. Adults over 65 and people with breathing problems or a weakened immune system may also get severe symptoms.

Human metapneumovirus (HMPV) can cause upper and lower respiratory disease in people of all ages, especially among young children, older adults, and people with weakened immune systems. Discovered in 2001, HMPV is in the Pneumoviridae family along with respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). Broader use of molecular diagnostic testing has increased identification and awareness of HMPV as an important cause of upper and lower respiratory infection. Symptoms commonly associated with HMPV include cough, fever, nasal congestion, and shortness of breath. Clinical symptoms of HMPV infection may progress to bronchitis or pneumonia and are similar to other viruses that cause upper and lower respiratory infections. The estimated incubation period is 3 to 6 days, and the median duration of illness can vary depending upon severity but is similar to other respiratory infections caused by viruses. HMPV is most likely spread from an infected person to others through In the U.S., HMPV circulates in distinct annual seasons. HMPV circulation begins in winter and lasts until or through spring. Surveillance data from CDC's the National Respiratory and Enteric Virus Surveillance System (NREVSS) shows HMPV to be most active during late winter and spring in temperate climates. HMPV, RSV, and influenza can circulate simultaneously during the respiratory virus season. Your patients can help prevent the spread of HMPV and other respiratory viruses by following these steps: Patients who have cold-like symptoms should In addition, cleaning possible contaminated surfaces (such as doorknobs and shared toys) may potentially help stop the spread of HMPV. In healthcare settings, healthcare providers should follow CDC's 2007 Guideline for Isolation Precautions: Preventing Transmission of Infectious Agents in Healthcare Settings. Since HMPV is a recently recognized respiratory virus, healthcare professionals may not routinely consider or test for HMPV. However, healthcare professionals should consider HMPV testing during winter and spring, especially when HMPV is commonly circulating. Infection with HMPV can be confirmed usually by Currently, there is no specific antiviral therapy to treat HMPV and no vaccine to prevent HMPV. Medical care is supportive.

                "content": "Diseases & Conditions Human metapneumovirus (hMPV) is a recently identified member of a family of viruses that also includes respiratory syncytial virus and parainfluenza virus. Although identified in 2001 by investigators from the Netherlands, data suggest this is a common virus that has been responsible for respiratory illnesses for at least 50 years worldwide. Human metapneumovirus can cause upper and lower respiratory tract infections in patients of all ages but respiratory illnesses most often occur in young children or older adults. Spread of the virus is most likely to occur by direct or close contact with the respiratory secretions of infected persons or by contact with objects and surfaces contaminated by their secretions. Most persons with hMPV infection have mild symptoms including cough, runny nose or nasal congestion, sore throat and fever. More severe illness, with wheezing, difficulty breathing, hoarseness, cough, pneumonia, and in adults, aggravation of asthma, also has been reported. In children younger than 1 year of age, the elderly and persons who have weak immune systems, hMPV can cause more serious respiratory illness. It is most common in late winter and early spring in the United States, however, one summer outbreak of hMPV respiratory illnesses in residents and staff of a long-term care facility in the United States has been reported. It is believed most persons who develop illness will do so three to five days after being exposed to this virus. Limited data suggests that reinfection with hMPV can occur. It is believed most children become infected early in life and adult infections represent persons becoming infected with hMPV again. Repeated infection appears to result in milder illness although serious disease is a risk for patients who are immunocompromised. Human metapneumovirus testing is not readily available. At this time, research laboratories and a limited number of commercial laboratories perform testing for this virus. Supportive treatment for patients varies with the severity of the illness but generally treatment consists of fever reducers, antihistamines, breathing treatments and other means of providing comfort to the patient until the illness resolves. Control measures used for other respiratory illnesses should be emphasized: covering the mouth and nose with a tissue when coughing or sneezing, or, coughing or sneezing into the upper sleeve rather than the hands, prompt disposal of used tissues and proper handwashing. Non-human primates can become infected with human metapneumovirus; humans are their likely source of infection.",

These may include: In more severe cases, patients may experience wheezing, difficulty breathing and asthma flare-ups. Secondary lower respiratory infections may occur such as bronchiolitis, bronchitis or pneumonia, requiring additional medical care. Most people experiencing mild hMPV symptoms do not need to see a doctor, as the illness should go away on its own and supportive care of symptoms at home is enough. However, if symptoms worsen and you develop shortness of breath, severe cough or wheezing, you should see a doctor. To diagnose a respiratory infection, your doctor will complete a physical and patient history. To further diagnose hMPV as the source of the respiratory infection, your doctor may order lab tests to confirm the type of virus causing your illness. In very few severe hospitalized cases, doctors may do a bronchoscopy where a small, flexible camera is inserted into the lung and a sample of fluid is removed to test for viruses.

                "content": "Real Madrid Club de Fútbol (Spanish pronunciation: [reˈal maˈðɾið ˈkluβ ðe ˈfuðβol] ⓘ), commonly referred to as Real Madrid, is a Spanish professional football club based in Madrid. The club competes in La Liga, the top tier of Spanish football. Founded in 1902 as Madrid Football Club, the club has traditionally worn a white home kit since its inception. The honorific title real is Spanish for \"royal\" and was bestowed to the club by King Alfonso XIII in 1920 alongside with the crown in the club crest. Real Madrid have played their home matches in the 85,000-capacity Santiago Bernabéu in Madrid since 1947. Unlike most European sporting clubs, Real Madrid's members (socios) have owned and operated the club throughout its history. The official Madrid anthem is the \"Hala Madrid y nada más\", written by RedOne and Manuel Jabois.[8] The club is one of the most widely supported in the world and is the most followed football club on social media according to the CIES Football Observatory as of 2023.[9][10] It was estimated to be worth $6.6 billion in 2024, making it the world's most valuable football club.[11] In 2024, Real Madrid become the first football club to make €1 billion ($1.08bn) in revenue according to the club's announcement.[12] Real Madrid are one of the most successful clubs in the sport. In domestic football, the club has won 71 trophies; a record 36 La Liga titles, 20 Copa del Rey, 13 Supercopa de España, a Copa Eva Duarte and a Copa de la Liga.[13] In International football, Real Madrid have won a record 35 trophies: a record 15 European Cup/UEFA Champions League titles, a record six UEFA Super Cups, two UEFA Cups, a joint record two Latin Cups, a record one Iberoamerican Cup, and a record nine FIFA Club World championships.[note 1] Madrid was ranked first in the International Federation of Football History & Statistics Club World Ranking for 2000, 2002, 2014, 2017.[17] In UEFA, Madrid ranks first in the all-time club ranking.[18][19] Being one of the three founding members of La Liga that have never been relegated from the top division since its inception in 1929 (along with Athletic Bilbao and Barcelona), Real Madrid has many long-standing rivalries, most notably El Clásico with Barcelona and El Derbi Madrileño with Atlético Madrid. The club established itself as a major force in both Spanish and European football during the 1950s and 60s, winning five consecutive and six overall European Cups and reaching a further two finals. This success was replicated on the domestic front, with Madrid winning 12 league titles in 16 years. This team, which included Alfredo Di Stéfano, Ferenc Puskás, Paco Gento and Raymond Kopa is considered, by some in the sport, to be the greatest of all time.[20][21] Real Madrid is known for its Galácticos policy, which involves signing the world's best players, such as Ronaldo, Zinedine Zidane and David Beckham to create a superstar team.[22] The term 'Galácticos policy' generally refers to the two eras of Florentino Pérez's presidency of the club (2000–2006 and 2009–2018); however, players brought in just before his tenure are sometimes considered to be part of the Galácticos legacy. A notable example is Steve McManaman, who like many other players also succeeded under the policy.[23] On 26 June 2009, Madrid signed Cristiano Ronaldo for a record-breaking £80 million (€94 million);[24] he became both the club's and history's all-time top goalscorer.[25][26][27][28] Madrid have recently relaxed the Galácticos policy, instead focusing on signing young talents such as Vinícius Júnior, Rodrygo, Jude Bellingham[29] and Kylian Mbappé.[30][31] Real Madrid is recognised as the greatest football club of the 20th century by FIFA and as the best European club during the same timeframe by the IFFHS,[32] while also receiving the FIFA Centennial Order of Merit in 2004.[33] Real Madrid has the highest participations in the European Cup/Champions League (55),[18] a tournament in which they hold the overall record for the most wins, most draws and most goals scored.[34] Real Madrid is the only club to have won three consecutive titles (three-peat) in the European Cup/Champions League twice, first in 1955–56, 1956–57, and 1957–58, and second in 2015–16, 2016–17 and 2017–18 and was the first and the only club to win La Decima (in 2013-14).[35] In June 2024, they won a record-extending 15th Champions League title (the sixth in eleven seasons), recognised as such by Guinness World Records.[36] Real Madrid is the first club across all of Europe's top-five leagues to win 100 trophies in all competitions.[37] As of July 2024,[update] Real Madrid are ranked 2nd in the UEFA club rankings and first in last 10 years (2013–2023) overall.[38][39] Real Madrid's origins go back to when football was introduced to Madrid by the academics and students of the Institución Libre de Enseñanza, which included several Cambridge and Oxford University graduates.[40] They founded (Sociedad) Sky Football in 1897, commonly known as La Sociedad (The Society) as it was the only one based in Madrid, playing on Sunday mornings at Moncloa. In 1900, conflict between members caused some of them to leave and create a new club, Nueva Sociedad de Football (New Society of Football), to distinguish themselves from Sky Football. Among the dissenters were Julián Palacios, recognized as the first Real Madrid president, Juan Padrós and Carlos Padrós, the latter two being brothers and future presidents of Real Madrid. In 1901, this new club was renamed as Madrid Football Club. Later, following a restructuring in 1902, Sky was renamed as \"New Foot-Ball Club\".[41][42][43] On 6 March 1902, after a new Board presided by Juan Padrós had been elected, Madrid Football Club was officially founded.[7] The Padrós brothers summoned other football enthusiasts to a meeting in the back room of Al Capricho, the family business. They viewed football as a mass sport that should be accessible to representatives of all social classes, and thought the new club should embody that idea. The brothers proposed the name, Madrid Football Club, which was unanimously accepted. The membership fee was also set, two pesetas a month, and the color of the shirt was chosen to be white in honour of a famous English team Corinthian, which Juan Padrós had met on one of his trips.[44][45] Three years after its founding, in 1905, Madrid FC won its first title after defeating Athletic Bilbao in the Spanish Cup final. The club became one of the founding sides of the Royal Spanish Football Federation on 4 January 1909, when club president Adolfo Meléndez signed the foundation agreement of the Spanish FA. After moving between several grounds, the team relocated to the Campo de O'Donnell in 1912.[46] In 1920, the club's name was changed to Real Madrid after King Alfonso XIII granted the title of Real (Royal) to the club.[47] In 1929, the first Spanish football league was founded. Real Madrid led the first league season until the last match, a loss to Athletic Bilbao, meant they finished runners-up to Barcelona.[48] Real Madrid won its first league title in the 1931–32 season and retained it the following year.[49] On 14 April 1931, the arrival of the Second Spanish Republic caused the club to lose the title Real and the royal crown on its emblem, going back to being named Madrid Football Club until the end of the Spanish Civil War. Football continued during the Second World War, and on 13 June 1943, Madrid beat Barcelona 11–1 in the second leg of the Copa del Generalísimo semi-finals, the Spanish Cup having been renamed in honour of General Franco.[note 2][50] The first leg, played at the Les Corts in Catalonia, had ended with Barcelona winning 3–0. Madrid complained about all the three goals that referee Fombona Fernández had allowed for Barcelona,[51] with the home supporters also whistling Madrid throughout, whom they accused of employing roughhouse tactics, and Fombona for allowing them to. The newspaper Ya reported the whistling as a \"clear intention to attack the representatives of Spain.\"[52] Barcelona fans were banned from traveling to Madrid. The day of the second leg, the Barcelona team were insulted and stones were thrown at their bus as soon as they left their hotel. Barcelona's striker Mariano Gonzalvo said of the incident, \"Five minutes before the game had started, our penalty area was already full of coins.\" Barcelona goalkeeper Luis Miró rarely approached his line—when he did, he was armed with stones. As Francisco Calvet told the story, \"They were shouting: Reds! Separatists!... a bottle just missed Sospedra that would have killed him if it had hit him. It was all set up.\"[53] Real Madrid went 2–0 up within half an hour. The third goal brought with it a sending off for Barcelona's Benito García after he made what Calvet claimed was a \"completely normal tackle\". Madrid's José Llopis Corona recalled: \"At which point, they got a bit demoralized,\" while Ángel Mur countered, \"at which point, we thought: 'go on then, score as many as you want'.\"[54] Madrid made it 8–0 by half-time; two goals were also ruled out for offside, and proceeded to score a further three goals in the second half, to which Barcelona replied with a late consolation goal.[55] According to football writer Sid Lowe, \"There have been relatively few mentions of the game [since] and it is not a result that has been particularly celebrated in Madrid. Indeed, the 11–1 occupies a far more prominent place in Barcelona's history. This was the game that first formed the identification of Madrid as the team of the dictatorship and Barcelona as its victims.\"[51] Fernando Argila, Barcelona's reserve goalkeeper from the 1943 match, said: \"There was no rivalry. Not, at least, until that game.\"[56] Santiago Bernabéu became president of Real Madrid in 1943.[57] Under his presidency, the club was rebuilt after the Civil War, and he oversaw the construction of the club's current stadium, Estadio Real Madrid Club de Fútbol (now known as the Santiago Bernabéu), and its training facilities Ciudad Deportiva. Additionally, during the 1950s former Real Madrid Amateurs player Miguel Malbo founded Real Madrid's youth academy, or \"cantera,\" known today as La Fábrica. Beginning in 1953, he embarked upon a strategy of signing world-class players from abroad, the most prominent being Alfredo Di Stéfano.[58] In 1955, acting upon the idea proposed by Gabriel Hanot, a French sports journalist and editor of L'Équipe, Bernabéu, Ernest Bedrignan (deputy chairman of the Ligue de Football Professionnel)[59] and Gusztáv Sebes created the European Cup, a continental tournament for the league champions around Europe, which is today known as the UEFA Champions League.[60] It was under Bernabéu's guidance that Real Madrid established itself as a major force in both Spanish and European football. The club won the European Cup five times in a row between 1956 and 1960, which included the 7–3 Hampden Park final against Eintracht Frankfurt in 1960.[58] After these five consecutive successes, Real was permanently awarded the original cup and earned the right to wear the UEFA badge of honour.[61] Real Madrid's achievements in Europe were built upon its unprecedented domestic dominance, with the club winning twelve league titles out of sixteen possible from 1953–54 to 1968–69, including a five-in-a-row sequence in 1961–65, and finishing runners-up a further three times.[62] The club won the European Cup for a sixth time in 1966, defeating Partizan Belgrade 2–1 in the final with a team composed entirely of same nationality players, a first in the competition.[63] This team became known as the Yé-yé. The name \"Yé-yé\" came from the \"Yeah, yeah, yeah\" chorus in The Beatles' song \"She Loves You\" after four members of the team posed for Marca and impersonated the Beatles.[64] The Yé-yé generation was also European Cup runners-up in 1962[65] and 1964.[63] In the 1970s, Real Madrid won six league championships and three Spanish Cups.[66] The club competed in its first European Cup Winners' Cup in 1970–71 and progressed all the way to the final, where it lost to English side Chelsea 2–1 in a replay.[67] On 2 July 1978, club president Santiago Bernabéu died while the World Cup was being played in Argentina. FIFA decreed three days of mourning to honour him during the tournament.[68] The following year, the club organized the first edition of the Trofeo Santiago Bernabéu in memory of its former president. Bernabéu had been Real Madrid's president for almost 35 years, during which his club won one Intercontinental Cup, six European Cups, 16 league titles, six Spanish Cups, two Latin Cups and one Copa Eva Duarte.[69] In the early 1980s, Real Madrid had lost its grasp on the La Liga title, until a new cohort of home-grown stars brought domestic success back to the club.[70][71] Spanish sports journalist Julio César Iglesias gave to this generation the name La Quinta del Buitre (\"Vulture's Cohort\"), which was derived from the nickname given to one of its members, Emilio Butragueño. The other four members were Manolo Sanchís, Martín Vázquez, Míchel and Miguel Pardeza. All five footballers were graduates of Real Madrid's youth academy.[70][71] With La Quinta del Buitre (reduced to four members when Pardeza left for Zaragoza in 1986) and notable players like goalkeeper Francisco Buyo, right-back Miguel Porlán Chendo and Mexican striker Hugo Sánchez, Real Madrid had one of the best teams in Spain and Europe during the second half of the 1980s, winning two UEFA Cups, five Spanish championships in a row, one Spanish Cup, and three Spanish Super Cups.[70][71] In the early 1990s, La Quinta del Buitre split up after Martín Vázquez, Emilio Butragueño and Míchel left the club. In 1996, President Lorenzo Sanz appointed Fabio Capello as coach.[72] Although his tenure lasted only one season, Real Madrid were proclaimed league champions, and players like Predrag Mijatović, Davor Šuker, Clarence Seedorf, Roberto Carlos and keeper Bodo Illgner, arrived at the club to strengthen a squad that already boasted the likes of Raúl, Fernando Hierro and Fernando Redondo. As a result, Real Madrid (with the addition of Fernando Morientes in 1997) finally ended its 32-year wait for its seventh European Cup: in 1998, under manager Jupp Heynckes, they defeated Juventus 1–0 in the final with a goal from Mijatović.[73] In November 1999, Vicente del Bosque took over as coach. For the last season of the century, 1999–2000, the squad was still led by the older veterans such as Fernando Hierro, Fernando Redondo, Roberto Carlos and Raúl. Real added the budding young talents of Guti and Iker Casillas, supported by the arrival of Steve McManaman and Nicolas Anelka from the English Premier League, alongside local talents Míchel Salgado and Iván Helguera. In Del Bosque's first season in charge, Real won the Champions League for the eighth time, following a 3–0 victory over Valencia in the final, with goals from Morientes, McManaman and Raúl.[74] This victory marked the beginning of a successful period in Real Madrid's history.[75] In July 2000, Florentino Pérez was elected club president.[76] He vowed in his campaign to erase the club's €270 million debt and modernize the club's facilities. However, the primary electoral promise that propelled Pérez to victory was the signing of Luís Figo from arch-rivals Barcelona.[77] The following year, the club had its training ground rezoned and used the money to begin assembling the Galácticos team by signing a global star every summer, which included Zinedine Zidane, Ronaldo, Luís Figo, David Beckham and Fabio Cannavaro.[78] It is debatable whether the gamble paid off, as despite winning the UEFA Champions League and an Intercontinental Cup in 2002, followed by La Liga in 2003, the club failed to win a major trophy for the next three seasons. Off the pitch, the Zidanes y Pavones policy resulted in increased financial success based on the exploitation of the club's high marketing potential around the world, particularly in Asia.[79] The few days after the capturing of the 2003 La Liga title were surrounded with controversy. The first controversial decision came when Pérez sacked winning coach Vicente del Bosque.[80] Over a dozen players left the club, including Madrid captain Fernando Hierro, while defensive midfielder Claude Makélélé refused to take part in training in protest at being one of the lowest-paid players at the club and subsequently moved to Chelsea.[81] \"That's a lot [of players leaving] when the normal rule is: never change a winning team,\" stated Zidane.[82] Real Madrid, with newly appointed coach Carlos Queiroz, started their domestic league slowly after a hard win over Real Betis.[82] The 2005–06 season began with the promise of several new signings: Júlio Baptista (€24 million), Robinho (€30 million), and Sergio Ramos (€27 million).[83] However, Real Madrid suffered from some poor results, including a 0–3 loss at the hands of Barcelona at the Santiago Bernabéu in November 2005.[84] Madrid's coach Wanderley Luxemburgo was sacked the following month and his replacement was Juan Ramón López Caro.[85] A brief return to form came to an abrupt halt after Madrid lost the first leg of the Copa del Rey semi-finals 6–1 to Real Zaragoza,[86] a defeat that was nearly reversed with a 4–0 home victory. Shortly after, Real Madrid were eliminated from the Champions League for a fourth successive year, this time at the hands of Arsenal. On 27 February 2006, Florentino Pérez resigned.[87] Ramón Calderón was elected as club president on 2 July 2006 and subsequently appointed Fabio Capello as the new coach and Predrag Mijatović as the new sporting director. Real Madrid won the Liga title in 2007 for the first time in four years, but Capello was nonetheless sacked at the end of the campaign.[88] The title was won on 17 June, where Real faced Mallorca at the Bernabéu while Barcelona and Sevilla, the other title challengers, faced Gimnàstic de Tarragona and Villarreal, respectively. At half-time, Real were 0–1 down, while Barcelona had surged ahead into a 0–3 lead in Tarragona. However, three goals in the last half-hour secured Madrid a 3–1 win and their first league title since 2003.[89] Real Madrid repeated as league winners in 2007–08, but the following season ended up being one of the most disastrous in the club's history: Real was knocked out of the Champions League at the round of 16 stage for the fifth time in a row, losing to Liverpool 0–5 on aggregate, and was embarrassed by Barcelona at the Santiago Bernabéu with a humiliating 2–6 loss, which all but confirmed the league title for Barça that went on to win the treble.[90] On 1 June 2009, Florentino Pérez regained Real Madrid's presidency amid the outrage over the club's decline.[91][92] Pérez continued with the Galácticos policy pursued in his first term, buying Kaká from Milan for a record-breaking (in pounds sterling) sum of £56 million,[93] and then breaking the record again by purchasing Cristiano Ronaldo from Manchester United for £80 million.[94] Real Madrid spent in excess of €261 million in the summer of 2009, and the assembled team was soon dubbed the Second Galácticos.[95] The 2009–10 season, however, was a transitional one as Madrid again finished second in the league, although this time amassing 96 points, the club's record at the time, and went out of the Champions League at the hands of Lyon. The season was marred by Cristiano Ronaldo's injury, that sidelined him for seven weeks,[96] although he still topped the goalscoring charts with 33 goals, and Madrid became the highest scoring team in La Liga, with 102 goals. Real Madrid also had the misfortune to become the runners-up with the highest points total in the history of Europe's top five leagues, until surpassed by Liverpool's 97 points in 2018–19.[97][98] José Mourinho took over as manager in May 2010.[99][100] In the 2010–11 season, the rebuilt Madrid successfully fought on all fronts, going toe to toe with a brilliant Barcelona side which some regard as the greatest team in football history. Ultimately, Madrid finished second in the league, with 92 points and four behind their perennial rivals, defeated them in the Copa del Rey final, and lost to Barça in the Champions League semi-finals, where Real progressed to for the first time since 2002–03. Moreover, from 16 April through 3 May, a rare occurrence happened when, for the first time ever, four Clásicos were to be played in a span of just 18 days. The first fixture was in the league campaign on 16 April (which ended 1–1 with penalty goals for both sides), the second one was in the Copa del Rey final (which was won by Madrid 1–0 a.e.t., bringing them their first trophy in the second Galáctico era) on 20 April and the third and fourth ones in the controversial[101][102] two-legged Champions League semi-finals on 27 April and 3 May (Barcelona won on aggregate with a 2–0 away victory and a 1–1 home draw).[103] Madrid again became the highest scoring team in La Liga, with 102 goals, repeating its output from the previous season, with Ronaldo scoring 40 and winning the European Golden Shoe. In the 2011–12 season, Real Madrid won La Liga for a record 32nd time in its history, also finishing the season with numerous league records set, including 100 points amassed in a single season, a total of 121 goals scored, a goal difference of +89, 16 away games won, and 32 wins overall.[104] They also competed in the UEFA Champions League for the 15th successive season,[105] losing in the semi-finals to Bayern Munich in a penalty shoot-out after a 3–3 aggregate tie. Madrid entered the Copa del Rey as the defending champions, but lost 3–4 on aggregate in the quarter-finals to Barcelona. In the same season, Cristiano Ronaldo became the fastest player to reach 100 goals scored in Spanish league history. In reaching 101 goals in 92 games, Ronaldo surpassed Real Madrid legend Ferenc Puskás, who scored 100 goals in 105 matches. Ronaldo set a new club mark for individual goals scored in one year (60) and became the first player ever to score against all 19 opposition teams in a single season.[106][107] Real Madrid started the 2012–13 season by winning the Supercopa de España, defeating Barcelona on away goals. However, the super cup turned out to be their only trophy of the season, despite being close to win them all. Real finished runners-up to Barça in La Liga, accumulating 85 points, and reached the semi-finals of the UEFA Champions League for the third year in a row, where they were eliminated by Borussia Dortmund 3–4 on aggregate. Madrid also entered the Copa del Rey in the round of 32, going on a memorable run to the final, which saw them defeat Barcelona in the semi-finals before losing to Atlético Madrid 1–2 a.e.t. Real Madrid faced the Blaugrana six times throughout the season, coming away with three wins, two draws, and one loss. A major transfer of the season was the signing of Luka Modrić from Tottenham Hotspur for a fee in the region of £33 million.[108] After a loss to Atlético in the Copa del Rey final, Pérez announced the departure of José Mourinho at the end of the season by \"mutual agreement\".[109] On 25 June 2013, Carlo Ancelotti succeeded Mourinho to become the manager of Real Madrid on a three-year deal, with Zinedine Zidane named as one of his assistants.[110] On 1 September 2013, the long-awaited transfer of Gareth Bale from Tottenham Hotspur was announced. The transfer of the Welshman was reportedly a new world record signing, with the transfer price approximated at €100 million.[111] In Ancelotti's first season at the club, Real Madrid fought on all three fronts for the continental treble. Despite leading in the league campaign on multiple occasions, Madrid ultimately finished in third place (level on points with Barcelona and three behind cross-city rivals Atlético Madrid), collecting 87 points in total and scoring a record 104 goals.[112] By that time, Los Blancos had already secured the Copa del Rey – against rivals Barcelona – in April, with Bale scoring the winner.[113] The major breakthrough came in the UEFA Champions League, where Real returned to the final after twelve years, having beaten defending champions Bayern Munich 5–0 on aggregate in the semi-finals.[114] In the final, they defeated then-recently-league winners Atlético Madrid 4–1 a.e.t. to clinch their tenth European Cup (first since 2002) and become the first team to win ten European Cups/Champions League titles, an achievement known as \"La Décima\" (Spanish: \"The Tenth,\" [la ˈðeθima]).[115] Real's attacking trio of Bale, Benzema and Cristiano, dubbed the BBC, finished the season with 97 goals.[116] After winning the 2014 Champions League, Real Madrid signed goalkeeper Keylor Navas, midfielder Toni Kroos and attacking midfielder James Rodríguez.[117] In August, Madrid won the 2014 UEFA Super Cup against Sevilla, the club's 79th official trophy.[118] During the last week of the 2014 summer transfer window, Real Madrid sold two players key to the previous season's successes: Xabi Alonso to Bayern Munich and Ángel Di María to Manchester United. This decision by the club was surrounded by controversy, with Cristiano Ronaldo stating, \"If I was in charge, maybe I would have done things differently,\" while Carlo Ancelotti admitted, \"We must start again from zero.\"[119] After a slow start to the 2014–15 season, Real Madrid went on a record-breaking 22-match winning streak, which included wins against Barcelona and Liverpool, surpassing the previous Spanish record of 18 successive wins set by Frank Rijkaard's Barça in the 2005–06 season.[120] In late December, Real Madrid won their first Club World Cup, defeating San Lorenzo 2–0 in the final.[121] The winning streak came to an end in their opening match of 2015 with a loss to Valencia, leaving the club two short of equalling the world record of 24 consecutive wins.[122] Madrid was in contention for both the La Liga title and the UEFA Champions League until the end but ultimately came up short, finishing with 92 points in the league, two behind treble-winning Barcelona and losing to Juventus 2–3 on aggregate in the Champions League semi-finals.[123] Ronaldo finished the season scoring 48 league goals, winning his fourth European Golden Shoe, and 61 goals in all competitions, breaking his record from 2011 to 2012.[124] Overall, despite playing an attractive attacking football and being the highest scoring team in Europe with 118 league goals,[125] several narrow defeats meant that Real finished the season with two trophies out of six possible, which contributed to the dismissal of Carlo Ancelotti on 25 May 2015.[126][127] On 3 June 2015, Rafael Benítez was confirmed as the new Real Madrid manager for the 2015–16 season, signing a three-year contract.[128] Real Madrid remained unbeaten in the league until a 3–2 loss at Sevilla on the matchday 11. This was followed by a 0–4 home loss in the first Clásico of the season against Barcelona. Perhaps, his reign is best remembered by multiple lopsided wins achieved both in La Liga and the Champions League (6–0 vs Espanyol, 8–0 vs Malmö, 10–2 vs Rayo Vallecano and others). In the Copa del Rey round of 32, Real accidentally fielded an ineligible player in a 3–1 first leg win at Cádiz and was disqualified from the tournament two days later by the competition judge, despite protests from president Pérez.[129][130][131] In the meantime, Madrid comfortably topped their UCL group with 16 points and a +16 goal difference. Benítez was relieved of his duties on 4 January 2016 following allegations of unpopularity with supporters, displeasure with players and a failure to produce good results against top teams.[132] Benítez's departure was announced along with the promotion of Zinedine Zidane to his first head coaching role.[133] Under Zidane, Madrid managed to turn the odds in its favour, ultimately winning the Champions League, something no one expected. The notable results include a 2–1 away victory over reigning treble winners Barcelona, who were on a record-breaking winning streak, a fantastic comeback against Wolfsburg in the Champions League quarter-finals (after losing the away game 0–2, Madrid erased the deficit and won 3–0 at home, courtesy of a Cristiano Ronaldo hat-trick), as well as a 12-game winning streak to conclude the league campaign, meaning Real finished second, with 90 points and just one point behind champions Barcelona, coming agonizingly close to clinching the title and overcoming a 12-point deficit in the process.[134] Finally, on 28 May, Real Madrid's eleventh Champions League title was won thanks to a 5–3 penalty shoot-out victory over rivals Atlético Madrid after a 1–1 draw in the final, with the achievement being termed \"La Undécima\".[135][136][127] Real Madrid began their 2016–17 campaign, which was to be Zidane's first full season in charge of the club, with a victory in the 2016 UEFA Super Cup against Sevilla.[137] On 10 December 2016, Madrid played their 35th-straight match without a loss, which set a new club record.[138] On 18 December 2016, the club defeated Japanese outfit Kashima Antlers 4–2 in the final of the 2016 FIFA Club World Cup.[139] With a 3–3 draw at Sevilla in the second leg of the Copa del Rey round of 16 on 12 January 2017, Madrid progressed to the quarter-finals with a 6–3 aggregate victory and extended its unbeaten run to 40 matches, breaking Barcelona's Spanish record of 39 matches unbeaten in all competitions from the previous season.[140] Their unbeaten streak ended after a 1–2 away loss against the same opposition in La Liga three days later.[141] The team then was knocked out of the Copa del Rey by Celta Vigo 3–4 on aggregate. These slips, however, did not affect the overall trajectory of the season. In May, Madrid won the league title for a record 33rd time, their first title in five years, accumulating 93 points in the process.[142] On 3 June 2017, the club's victory over Juventus in the Champions League final resulted in Real Madrid becoming the first team to successfully defend their title in the UEFA Champions League era, and the first to win consecutive titles in the competition since Milan in 1989 and 1990, when the tournament was known as the European Cup.[143][144] Real Madrid's title was its 12th, extending the record, and its third in four years. The achievement is also known as \"La Duodécima\".[145] The 2016–17 season was the greatest campaign in terms of trophies won (four out of possible five) in the history of Real Madrid, an achievement that would be later equalled in the 2017–18 season.[146] Real kicked off the 2017–18 campaign by winning its second consecutive and fourth overall UEFA Super Cup in a 2–1 victory against Manchester United.[147] Five days later, Real Madrid beat Barcelona at the Camp Nou 3–1 in the first leg of the 2017 Supercopa de España and then defeated Barça 2–0 in the return leg, ending their 24 consecutive match scoring record in El Clásico matches and winning the second trophy of the season.[148] On 16 December 2017, Real beat Brazilian club Grêmio 1–0 in the FIFA Club World Cup final and became the first team to retain the trophy.[149] In the 2017–18 UEFA Champions League, Madrid once again progressed to the final where they defeated Liverpool 3–1 to become the first club to win three straight titles in the Champions League era, as well as the first team to win three consecutive titles in the European Cup/Champions League since Bayern Munich in 1976. The trophy also marked Madrid's fourth win in five years and their eighth consecutive semi-finals appearance. On 31 May, only five days after winning the final, Zidane announced his resignation as Real Madrid manager, citing the club's \"need for change\" as his rationale for departing.[150][151] Zidane's and Ronaldo's departures marked the end of the Second Galáctico Era that yielded four Champions League titles, two La Liga titles, two Copa del Rey, two Supercopa de España, three UEFA Super Cups, and three FIFA Club World Cup titles. The team was instrumental in ending Barcelona's dominance, despite the Blaugrana boasting arguably the greatest collection of talent in history,[152] and overshadowed the Catalans on the European stage.[153] Real Madrid was also somewhat notoriously unlucky in its league campaigns throughout these nine years, finishing runners-up with 96, 92 (twice) and 90 points, as well as on 87 points in third place, just three off the league winners.[98] On 12 June 2018, Real Madrid named Julen Lopetegui, the head coach of the Spanish national team, as their new manager. It was announced that he would officially begin his managerial duties after the 2018 FIFA World Cup. However, the Spanish national team sacked Lopetegui a day prior to the tournament, stating that he had negotiated terms with the club without informing them.[154][155] The club then began re-shaping the squad in the summer of 2018, which included the sale of Cristiano Ronaldo to Juventus for a reported €117 million.[156] Madrid began their 2018–19 campaign by losing to Atlético Madrid 2–4 a.e.t. in the 2018 UEFA Super Cup. After a 1–5 loss to Barcelona in El Clásico on 28 October which left Real Madrid in the ninth place with only 14 points after ten games, Lopetegui was dismissed a day later and replaced by then Castilla coach, Santiago Solari.[157] On 22 December 2018, Real Madrid beat Al Ain 4–1 in the FIFA Club World Cup and became the outright record winners of the Club World Cup with four titles.[158] However, they were then knocked out of the Copa del Rey at the semi-final stage by Barcelona, losing 1–4 on aggregate. On 5 March 2019, Real was defeated by Ajax 1–4 (3–5 on aggregate) at home, crashing out of the Champions League at the round of 16 stage after eight consecutive semi-finals appearances. On 11 March 2019, Real Madrid dismissed Solari and reinstated Zidane as the head coach of the club.[159] Madrid finished the season with 68 points and a +17 goal difference, its lowest totals since 2001–02 and 1999–2000 respectively.[160] In the summer of 2019, Madrid signed Eden Hazard, Luka Jović, Éder Militão, Ferland Mendy, Rodrygo, Reinier and other players for a total of more than €350 million.[161] On 12 January 2020, Madrid beat cross-city rivals Atlético Madrid in a penalty shootout in the Supercopa de España final to win their eleventh title.[162] After a three-month hiatus due to the COVID-19 outbreak in March 2020, La Liga was restarted in June and Madrid won ten games in a row to capture the team's 34th league title, collecting 87 points in total.[163] From the competition's resumption in June and until the end of the 2020–21 season, Real temporarily played home fixtures at the Alfredo Di Stéfano Stadium, while the Santiago Bernabéu underwent extensive renovations.[164][165] Zidane left a second time on 27 May 2021 after going trophyless that season,[166] with Carlo Ancelotti returning to coach the team for the 2021–22 season.[167] On the domestic front, he delivered two trophies out of possible three, winning La Liga and the Supercopa de España.[168][169][170] As such, Ancelotti won all six available top trophies at Madrid.[171] In the Champions League, Madrid produced one of the most memorable runs of all time,[172] defeating pre-tournament favourites Paris Saint-Germain,[173][174] defending champions and favourites Chelsea,[175] Premier League champions and heavy favourites Manchester City,[176] all in dramatic fashion,[177] and setting up the final against Liverpool, who were once again widely considered as favourites,[178] in a rematch of their 2018 encounter. A lone Vinícius Júnior goal sealed the 14th European Cup for Los Blancos, their fifth in nine years, and Ancelotti's second in charge.[179][180] Real also claimed their fourth ever European double (after 1956–57, 1957–58, and 2016–17). Despite Real's status as the most decorated team in the history of the Champions League, they were not favoured to win that year's edition, and their improbable run was widely considered a surprise.[181] After a highly successful 2021–22 season, Real Madrid signed German defender Antonio Rüdiger and French midfielder Aurélien Tchouaméni, while club legends Marcelo, Isco, Gareth Bale and Casemiro left the club. Real Madrid's 2022–23 season began with lifting the UEFA Super Cup and later the FIFA Club World Cup. The season ended with Real Madrid winning the 2022–23 Copa del Rey, but losing the La Liga and Spanish Super Cup to FC Barcelona and the Champions League to Manchester City, being defeated 5–1 on aggregate. In 2023, Real Madrid signed Jude Bellingham, who was given the number #5 jersey, previously used by Zinedine Zidane. Real also signed Arda Güler and Fran García. Meanwhile, Vinícius Júnior was given the number #7 jersey, previously used by Raúl and Cristiano Ronaldo; while Rodrygo was given the number #11 jersey, previously used by Gareth Bale. Karim Benzema left the club, while Toni Kroos would later announce that he would retire from football after this season. The 2023-24 season would prove to be another highly successful season for Los Blancos. First, Real Madrid lifted the Spanish Super Cup against Barcelona 4–1, taking revenge of the previous year's 3–0 defeat. Then, Real Madrid lifted the La Liga with relative ease, reaching 95 points, the second-best winning campaign by Real Madrid in La Liga history after the 2011–12 100 points season. In the 2023–24 UEFA Champions League, Real Madrid knocked out RB Leipzig in the Round of 16, then defending champions Manchester City in penalties. In the semifinals, Real Madrid faced Bayern Munich again. The first match was a 2–2 draw, while the second match in the Bernabéu was marked by a double by Joselu in the last few minutes of the game, with Bayern Munich suffering a historic comeback after leading 1–0. Real Madrid faced Borussia Dortmund in the final, and won 2–0, with Dani Carvajal being the man of the match and scoring with a header after a Toni Kroos corner, and Vinícius Júnior once again scoring in a UCL final. Real Madrid won their 15th Champions League without losing a single match during the campaign. Following the conclusion of the 2023–24 season, Real Madrid announced that striker Kylian Mbappé would be joining the club on a free transfer from Paris Saint-Germain in July 2024, concluding one of the most highly anticipated transfer sagas in modern history.[182] On 18 December 2024, Real Madrid clinched their second trophy of the season, uplifting the inaugural 2024 FIFA Intercontinental Cup by beating Pachuca 3-0.[183] The first crest had a simple design consisting of a decorative interlacing of the three initials of the club, \"MCF\" for Madrid Club de Fútbol, in dark blue on a white shirt. The first change in the crest occurred in 1908 when the letters adopted a more streamlined form and appeared inside a circle.[184] The next change in the configuration of the crest did not occur until the presidency of Pedro Parages in 1920. At that time, King Alfonso XIII granted the club his royal patronage which came in the form of the title \"Real Madrid,\" meaning \"Royal.\"[185] Thus, Alfonso's crown was added to the crest and the club styled itself Real Madrid Club de Fútbol.[184] With the dissolution of the monarchy in 1931, all royal symbols (the crown on the crest and the title of Real) were eliminated. The crown was replaced by the dark mulberry band of the Region of Castile.[49] In 1941, two years after Nationalist victory in the Civil War, the Francoist regime restored the crest's \"Real Corona\", or \"Royal Crown\", while the mulberry stripe of Castile was retained as well.[186][57] In addition, the whole crest was made full color, with gold being the most prominent, and the club went back to its honorific name Real Madrid Club de Fútbol.[184] The most recent modification to the crest occurred in 2001 when the club wanted to better situate itself for the 21st century and further standardize its crest. One of the modifications made was changing the mulberry stripe to a more bluish shade.[184] Real Madrid has maintained the white shirt for its home kit throughout the history of the club. There was, however, one season that the shirt and shorts were not both white. It was an initiative undertaken by Juan Padrós in honour of an English team Corinthian, which he had met on one of his trips, one of the most famous teams at the time known for its elegance and sportsmanship.[44] It was decided that Real Madrid would wear black shorts in an attempt to replicate the English team, which had also inspired Madrid's original white kit, but the initiative lasted just one year. After being eliminated from the cup by Barcelona with a 1–5 defeat in Madrid and a 2–0 defeat in Catalonia, President Parages decided to return to an all-white kit, claiming that the other kit brought bad luck.[note 3] By the early 1940s, the manager changed the kit again by adding buttons to the shirt and the club's crest on the left breast, which has remained ever since. On 23 November 1947, in a game against Atlético Madrid at the Metropolitano Stadium, Real Madrid became the first Spanish team to wear numbered shirts.[57] English club Leeds United permanently switched their blue shirt for a white one in the 1960s, to emulate the dominant Real Madrid of the era.[187] Real's traditional away colours are all blue or all purple. Since the advent of the replica kit market, the club has also released various other one colour designs, including red, green, orange and black. The club's kit is manufactured by Adidas, whose contract extends from 1998.[188][189] Real Madrid's first shirt sponsor, Zanussi, agreed for the 1982–83, 1983–84 and 1984–85 seasons. Following that, the club was sponsored by Parmalat and Otaysa before a long-term deal was signed with Teka in 1992.[190][191] In 2001, Real Madrid ended their contract with Teka and for one season and used the Realmadrid.com logo to promote the club's website. Then, in 2002, a deal was signed with Siemens and in 2006, the BenQ Siemens logo appeared on the club's shirt.[192] Real Madrid's shirt sponsor from 2007 until 2013 was bwin.com following the economic problems of BenQ Siemens.[193][194] Fly Emirates became their shirt sponsor in 2013, and in 2017 the club renewed the sponsorship with the airliner, signing a deal until 2022 worth €70 million per year.[195] In 2022, the agreement was again extended, until 2026.[196] In 2015, Madrid signed a new ten-year contract with Adidas, believed to be worth a total of £850 million (€1 billion), with the club earning £59 million (€64 million) per season. The contract includes a clause sanctioning penalty or agreement termination anytime, if Real Madrid fails to qualify for the European competitions or is relegated from La Liga.[197] Note: early termination clauses can be activated at any time depending on the team's performance. After moving between several grounds, the team relocated to the Campo de O'Donnell in 1912, which remained its home stadium for 11 years.[46] After this period, the club moved for one year to the Campo de Ciudad Lineal, a small ground with a capacity of 8,000 spectators. After that, Real Madrid started playing its home matches at the Estadio Chamartín, which was inaugurated on 17 May 1923 with a match against Newcastle United.[203] In this stadium, which hosted 22,500 spectators, Real Madrid celebrated its first Spanish league title.[48] Following his election in 1943, president Santiago Bernabéu decided that the Chamartín was not big enough for the ambitions of the club, and thus a new stadium was built and inaugurated on 14 December 1947.[57][204] Initially knows as Nuevo Chamartín, the stadium was renamed in honour of Bernabéu in 1955 and continues to bear his name to this day.[58] The first match at the Bernabéu was played between Madrid and the Portuguese club Belenenses, with Los Blancos winning 3–1 and Sabino Barinaga scoring the first goal.[57] The capacity has changed frequently, peaking at 120,000 after a 1953 expansion.[205] Since then, there have been a number of reductions due to modernizations (the last standing areas were removed in 1998–99 in response to UEFA regulations which had forbidden standing at matches in European competitions), countered to some extent by expansions.[205] The current capacity is 81,044 spectators. Real Madrid has the fourth-highest average attendance in Europe, behind Borussia Dortmund, Barcelona and Manchester United.[206][207][208][209] The Bernabéu has hosted the 1964 UEFA European Championship final, the 1982 FIFA World Cup final, and the 1957, 1969, 1980 and 2010 European Cup/Champions League finals.[210] The stadium has its own namesake Madrid Metro station along the 10 line.[211] On 14 November 2007, the Bernabéu was upgraded to Elite Football Stadium status by UEFA.[212] On 9 May 2006, the Alfredo Di Stéfano Stadium, named after club legend Alfredo Di Stéfano, was inaugurated in the Real Madrid City, where Real Madrid usually trains. The inaugural match was played between Real Madrid and Reims, a rematch of the 1956 European Cup final. Real Madrid 6–1, with goals from Sergio Ramos, Antonio Cassano (2), Roberto Soldado (2) and José Manuel Jurado. The venue is now part of the Ciudad Real Madrid, the club's training facility located outside Madrid, in Valdebebas. The stadium's capacity is 5,000 people, and it is Real Madrid Castilla's home ground.[213] For the latter part of the 2019–20 season and throughout the 2020–21 season, the stadium hosted the first team's home games due to a combination of the COVID-19 pandemic-triggered restrictions and an extensive renovation of the Santiago Bernabéu.[214][165] The latest renovation of the Santiago Bernabéu is set to increase the capacity by approximately 4,000 with the addition of an extra tier, bringing it to nearly 85,000.[215][216] Furthermore, the height will also be increased by ten metres and a retractable roof, a retractable pitch and a 360-degree screen will be installed.[217][218] The works have started in 2019, and the renovated stadium was initially planned to be unveiled in 2022; however, the COVID-19 pandemic and Russian invasion of Ukraine caused significant disruption to supply chains, prompting the club to postpone the stadium's inauguration to 2023.[219][220] Raúl holds the record for most appearances with Real Madrid, with 741 appearances from 1994 to 2010. Iker Casillas comes second with 725 appearances, followed by Manuel Sanchis Jr., having played 710 times.[221] The record for a goalkeeper is held by Iker Casillas, with 725 appearances. With 63 goals, Cristiano Ronaldo has scored the most international goals while playing for the club. Meanwhile, Sergio Ramos has accumulated the most caps while playing for the club, with 176. Cristiano Ronaldo (2009–2018) is Real Madrid's all-time top goalscorer, with 450 goals in 438 matches.[222][223] Six other players have also scored over 200 goals for Real: Alfredo Di Stéfano (1953–1964), Santillana (1971–1988), Ferenc Puskás (1958–1966), Hugo Sánchez (1985–1992), Karim Benzema (2009–2023) and the previous goalscoring record-holder Raúl (1994–2010). Cristiano Ronaldo also holds the record for the most league goals scored in one season (48 in 2014–15), alongside being Real's top goalscorer of all time in La Liga history with 311 goals. Di Stéfano's 49 goals in 58 matches was for decades the all-time highest tally in the European Cup, until it was surpassed by Raúl in 2005, and is now held by Cristiano Ronaldo with 105 goals for Madrid and 140 overall. The fastest goal in the history of the club (13 seconds) was scored by the Chilean Iván Zamorano on 3 September 1994 during a league match against Sevilla.[224] Officially, the highest home attendance figure for a Real Madrid match is 129,690, which was for a European Cup match in 1956 against Milan. The current official capacity of the Santiago Bernabéu is 80,000.[225] Real has also set records in Spanish football, most notably the most domestic titles (36 as of 2023–24) and the most seasons won in a row (five, during 1960–65 and 1985–90).[1] With 121 matches (from 17 February 1957 to 7 March 1965), the club holds the record for longest unbeaten run at home in La Liga.[226] The club also holds the record for winning the European Cup/UEFA Champions League fifteen times[227] and for the most semi-finals appearances (33). As of June 2024, Cristiano Ronaldo is the all-time top scorer in the UEFA Champions League, with 140 (141 including qualifiers) goals in total, 105 while playing for Real Madrid. The team has the record number of consecutive participations in the European Cup (before it became the Champions League) with 15, from 1955–56 to 1969–70.[228] Among the club's on-field records is a 22-game winning streak in all competitions during the 2014–15 season, a Spanish record. In September 2017, the club equalled the record of the Brazilian club Santos, starring Pelé, by scoring in their 73rd consecutive game, before Bayern Munich breaks the record in 2021.[229] In June 2009, the club broke its own record for the highest transfer fee ever paid in the history of football after purchasing Manchester United star Cristiano Ronaldo for €94 million (£80 million).[230][231] The fee of €77.5 million (100 billion lire) for Zinedine Zidane's transfer from Juventus to Real Madrid in 2001 was the previous highest transfer fee ever paid. This record (in pounds sterling) had been broken previously in June 2009, for a few days, when Real Madrid agreed to buy Kaká from Milan for €67 million (£65 million). The transfer of Tottenham Hotspur's Gareth Bale in 2013 was reportedly a new world record signing, with the transfer fee approximated at around €100 million.[111] In January 2016, documents pertaining to Bale's transfer were leaked which confirmed a world record transfer fee of €100,759,418.[232] Real Madrid equalled their record signing in 2019, when the club signed Eden Hazard from Chelsea for a reported €115 million.[233] The club's record sale occurred on 10 July 2018, when Juventus signed Cristiano Ronaldo for €117 million.[234] During most home matches, the majority of the seats in the stadium are occupied by season-ticket holders, of which the figure is capped at 65,000.[235] To become a season ticket holder one must first be a socio, or club member. In addition to members, the club has more than 1,800 peñas (official, club-affiliated supporters' groups) in Spain and around the world. Real Madrid has the second highest average all-time attendance in Spanish football and regularly attracts over 74,000 fans to the Bernabéu. One of the best supported teams globally, Real Madrid was the first sports team (and first brand) to reach 100 million fans on Facebook in April 2017.[236][237] Real Madrid's hardcore supporters are the so-called Ultras Sur supporters, or simply Ultras. They are known for their extreme right-wing politics, akin to Barcelona's hardcore supporters group Boixos Nois. The Ultras Surs have developed an alliance with other right wing groups, most notably Lazio Irriducibili fans, and have also developed an alliance with left-wing groups. On several occasions, they have racially abused opposing players, and have been investigated by UEFA for doing so.[238][239] Florentino Pérez took it upon himself to ban the Ultras from the Bernabéu and assign their seats to the general public. This decision was controversial with some of the Bernabéu faithful, however, as the lively atmosphere of games would suffer as a result.[240][241] The Ultras have since held protests outside the Bernabéu and have demanded to be reinstated and allowed to enter the grounds.[242] Questioned over Pope Francis' adherence to 2014 FIFA Club World Cup Final opponents San Lorenzo, Madrid captain Sergio Ramos stated: \"In the semi-finals we noticed the love from supporters in Marrakesh and it seemed like we were playing at home. That sums up the greatness of this team. Madrid is God's team and the team of the world\".[243] Among the club's famous supporters is golfer Sergio García, who was invited to take the honorary kickoff for El Clásico at the Bernabeu wearing his green jacket from winning the 2017 Masters.[244] There is often a fierce rivalry between the two strongest teams in a national league, and this is particularly the case in La Liga, where the game between Real Madrid and Barcelona is known as \"The Classic\" (El Clásico). From the start of national competitions the clubs were seen as representatives of two rival regions in Spain: Castile and Catalonia, as well as of the two cities. The rivalry reflects what many regard as the political and cultural tensions felt between the Castilians and Catalans, seen by one author as a re-enactment of the Spanish Civil War.[245] Over the years, the record for Real Madrid and Barcelona is 105 victories for Madrid, 101 victories for Barcelona, and 52 draws as at December 2024.[246] As early as the 1930s, Barcelona \"had developed a reputation as a symbol of Catalan identity, opposed to the centralising tendencies of Madrid\".[248][249] During the dictatorships of Miguel Primo de Rivera and especially Francisco Franco, all regional languages and identities in Spain were frowned upon and restrained. As such, most citizens of Barcelona were in strong opposition to Franco's regime. In that period, Barcelona gained their motto Més que un club (English: More than a club) because of its alleged connection to Catalan nationalist as well as to progressive beliefs.[250] There is an ongoing controversy as to what extent Franco's rule (1939–75) influenced the activities and on-pitch results of both Barcelona and Real Madrid. Fans of both clubs tend to exaggerate the myths favouring their narratives. Most historians agree that Franco did not have a preferred football team, but his Spanish nationalist beliefs led him to associate himself with the establishment teams, such as Atlético Aviación and Madrid FC (that recovered its \"royal\" name after the fall of the Republic and again became Real Madrid). On the other hand, he also wanted the renamed Barcelona succeed as \"Spanish team\", rather than a Catalan one. During the early years of Franco's rule, Real Madrid were not particularly successful, winning two Copa del Generalísimo titles and a Copa Eva Duarte; Barcelona claimed three league titles, one Copa del Generalísimo and one Copa Eva Duarte. During that period, Atlético Aviación were believed to be the preferred team over Real Madrid. The most contested stories of the period include Real Madrid's 11–1 home win against Barcelona in the Copa del Generalísimo, where the Catalan team alleged intimidation, and the controversial transfer of Alfredo Di Stéfano to Real Madrid, despite his agreement with Barcelona. The latter transfer was part of Real Madrid chairman Santiago Bernabéu's \"revolution\" that ushered in the era of unprecedented dominance. Bernabéu, himself a veteran of the Civil War who fought for Franco's forces, saw Real Madrid on top, not only of Spanish, but also European football, helping create the European Cup, the first true competition for Europe's best club sides. His vision was fulfilled when Real Madrid not only started winning consecutive league titles, but also swept the first five editions of the European Cup in the 1950s.[251] These events had a profound impact on Spanish football and influenced Franco's attitude. According to historians, during this time he realized the importance of Real Madrid for his regime's international image, and the club became his preferred team until his death. Fernando Maria Castiella, who served as Minister of Foreign Affairs under Franco from 1957 until 1969, noted that \"[Real Madrid] is the best embassy we have ever had\". Franco died in 1975, and the Spanish transition to democracy soon followed. Under his rule, Real Madrid had won 14 league titles, six Copa del Generalísimo titles, one Copa Eva Duarte, six European Cups, two Latin Cups and one Intercontinental Cup. In the same period, Barcelona had won eight league titles, nine Copa del Generalísimo titles, three Copa Eva Duarte titles, three Inter-Cities Fairs Cups and two Latin Cups.[252][186] The rivalry was intensified during the 1950s when the clubs disputed the signing of Alfredo Di Stéfano. Di Stéfano had impressed both Barcelona and Real Madrid while playing for Los Millonarios in Bogotá, Colombia, during a players' strike in his native Argentina. Soon after Millonarios' return to Colombia, Barcelona directors visited Buenos Aires and agreed with River Plate, the last FIFA-affiliated team to have held Di Stéfano's rights, for his transfer in 1954 for the equivalent of 150 million Italian lira (according to other sources 200,000 dollars). This started a battle between the two Spanish rivals for his rights. FIFA appointed Armando Muñoz Calero, former president of the Spanish Football Federation as mediator. Calero decided to let Di Stéfano play the 1953–54 and 1955–56 seasons in Madrid, and the 1954–55 and 1956–57 seasons in Barcelona. The agreement was approved by the Football Association and their respective clubs. Although the Catalans agreed, the decision created various discontent among the Blaugrana members and the president was forced to resign in September 1953. Barcelona sold Madrid their half-share, and Di Stéfano moved to Los Blancos, signing a four-year contract. Real paid 5.5 million Spanish pesetas for the transfer, plus a 1.3 million bonus for the purchase, an annual fee to be paid to the Millonarios, and a 16,000 salary for Di Stéfano with a bonus double that of his teammates, for a total of 40% of the annual revenue of the Madrid club.[253] Di Stéfano became integral in the subsequent success achieved by Real Madrid, scoring twice in his first game against Barcelona. With him, Madrid won the first five editions of the European Cup.[254] The 1960s saw the rivalry reach the European stage when Real Madrid and Barcelona met twice in the European Cup, with Madrid triumphing en route to their fifth consecutive title in 1959–60 and Barcelona prevailing en route to losing the final in 1960–61. Ahead of the 1973–74 season, Johan Cruyff arrived to Barcelona for a world record £920,000 from Ajax.[255] Already an established player with Ajax, Cruyff quickly won over the Barcelona fans when he told the European press that he chose Barcelona over Real Madrid because he could not play for a club associated with Francisco Franco. He further endeared himself when he named his son \"Jordi\", after the local Catalan Saint George.[256] In 2002, the European encounter between the clubs was dubbed the \"Match of The Century\" by Spanish media, and Madrid's win was watched by more than 500 million people around the world.[257] A fixture known for its intensity and indiscipline, it has also featured memorable goal celebrations from both teams, often involving mocking the opposition.[258] In October 1999, Real Madrid forward Raúl silenced 100,000 Barcelona fans at the Camp Nou when he scored before he celebrated by putting a finger to his lips as if telling the crowd to be quiet.[258][259] In 2009, Barcelona captain Carles Puyol kissed his Catalan armband in front of Madrid fans at the Bernabéu.[258] Cristiano Ronaldo twice gestured to the hostile crowd to \"calm down\" after scoring against Barcelona at the Camp Nou in 2012 and 2016.[258] In April 2017, Messi celebrated his 93rd-minute winner for Barcelona against Real Madrid at the Bernabéu by taking off his Barcelona shirt and holding it up to incensed Real Madrid fans – with his name and number facing them.[258] Later that year, in August, Ronaldo was subbed on in the first leg of the Supercopa de España, proceeded to score in the 80th minute and took his shirt off before holding it up to Barça's fans with his name and number facing them.[260] The club's nearest neighbour is Atlético Madrid, a rivalry being shared between fans of both football teams. Although Atlético was founded by three Basque students in 1903, it was joined in 1904 by dissident members of \"Madrid FC\". The two teams met for the first time on 2 December 1906 in the regional championship, with Real Madrid winning 2–1. Their first league meeting came on 21 February 1929 in matchday three of the first league championship at the former Chamartín. It was the first official derby of the new tournament, and Real won 2–1.[48] After the Civil War, during the early Francoist period, Atlético became associated with the military air force (and thus renamed Atlético Aviación), although the alleged preference of the regime for the club is subject to discussion. In any case, during this period Atlético became the most successful club in Spain, reducing the historical gap between the two clubs, until the regime preference shifted towards Real Madrid in the 1950s, as Franco sought to make political capital out of Real Madrid's multiple European Cup titles at a time when Spain was internationally isolated; one minister said, \"Real Madrid are the best ambassadors we've ever had.\"[186] Thus, Atlético fans regularly chanted that Real were \"El equipo del gobierno, la vergüenza del país\" – \"The team of the government, the shame of the country\" – and allegedly adopted a more left-wing slant (tempered by the rise of ultras culture and Rayo Vallecano's presence as the \"true\" leftist club in Madrid).[261][262] The rivalry first gained international attention in 1959 during the European Cup when the two clubs met in the semi-finals. Real won the first leg 2–1 at the Santiago Bernabéu, while Atlético won 1–0 at the Metropolitano. The tie went to a replay, which Real won 2–1. Atlético, however, gained some revenge when, led by former Real Madrid coach José Villalonga, it defeated its city rivals in two successive Copa del Generalísimo finals in 1960 and 1961.[263] In the 1970s, Atlético again took the lead as the most successful Spanish club of the decade, which prompted the Real Madrid fanbase to look down on Atlético calling them and their supporters \"Indios\" (Indians, a reference to the Latin American players signed by the Red-and-whites).[264] By then, Real Madrid did not want to sign non-Caucasian players (president Santiago Bernabéu even stated, when he decided not to sign Portuguese star Eusebio at the end of the 1960s, \"Mientras yo viva, aquí no jugará ningún negro ni un blanco con bigote\" (\"As long as I live, no black or white with a mustache will play here\").[265] Atlético's supporters accepted the new \"Indian\" nickname joyfully and have been using it until today. The Santiago Bernabéu, Real Madrid's stadium, is alongside banks and businesses on the upper class Paseo de la Castellana street, while the Vicente Calderón (the stadium that Atlético Madrid used until the 2016–17 season) could be found near a brewery, alongside the Manzanares River and a motorway. Real draw greater support all across the region because of their historically greater resources and success, while Atlético have a relatively working class fan base mainly from the south of the city, with some fans also scattered throughout the city.[266][267] In fact, the Atlético crest includes the Coat of arms of Madrid, whereas Real crest has no such a reference to the city (instead, it includes a reference to the broader Castile region). Between 1961 and 1989, when Real dominated La Liga, only Atlético offered it any serious challenge, winning league titles in 1966, 1970, 1973 and 1977. In 1965, Atlético became the first team to beat Real at the Bernabéu in eight years. Real Madrid's record against Atlético in more recent times has been favourable.[268] A high point came in the 2002–03 season, when Real clinched the La Liga title after a 4–0 victory at the Vicente Calderón. Atlético's first win over its city rivals since 1999 came in the Copa del Rey final in May 2013. In 2013–14, Real and Atlético were finalists of the UEFA Champions League, the first final which hosted two clubs from the same city. Real Madrid triumphed with a 4–1 comeback victory in extra time.[269] On 7 February 2015, Real suffered their first defeat in 14 years at the Vicente Calderón, a 4–0 loss.[270] On 28 May 2016, Real and Atlético again met for the Champions League title, which resulted in a win for Real after a penalty shootout at San Siro.[271] A further minor rivalry exists between Real Madrid and Athletic Bilbao. This is known as El Viejo Clásico (the old classic),[272] so named as the two clubs were dominant in the first half of the 20th century, meeting in nine Copa del Rey finals including the first in 1903.[273][274] Until 10 December 2011, this fixture was the most played in the history of Spanish football, when it was surpassed by El Clásico.[275] Athletic Bilbao, who operate a policy of only using local players,[276] have long since ceased to be a competitive rival to clubs such as Real Madrid who scour the globe for the best talent; the Lions won only two of the 26 matches between the teams from 2005–06 to 2016–17.[272][277][278] However, the matches remain keenly fought due to their historical and cultural significance, with some parallels to the political aspect of the Barcelona/Catalonia rivalry as Athletic are the largest club in the Basque region.[279][262][280] Real Madrid and Bayern Munich are two of the most successful clubs in the UEFA Champions League/European Cup competition, with Real winning 15 times and Bayern winning six times.[281][282] Although they have never met in a final, Real Madrid versus Bayern is the match that has historically been played most often in the Champions League/European Cup with 26 matches (twelve wins for Madrid, eleven wins for Bayern, with three draws),[283] with several controversial incidents occurring due to the great importance of most of their meetings.[284][285][286] Real Madrid supporters often refer to Bayern as the \"Bestia negra\" (\"Black Beast\"). During the 2010s, the two teams met in the 2011–12 Champions League semi-finals, which ended 3–3 on aggregate (Bayern won 3–1 on penalties after extra time, but lost the final at their own stadium by the same method), then at the same stage in the 2013–14 edition with Real Madrid winning 5–0 on aggregate,[287] and again in 2017–18 with the Spanish club progressing 4–3;[288] both times they went on to win the competition. Another match that is often played in the European Cup/Champions League is Real Madrid vs Juventus, the most decorated Italian club. They have played each other in 21 matches and have an almost perfectly balanced record (nine wins for Juventus, ten wins for Real Madrid and two draws), as well as nearly the same goal difference (Madrid ahead 26 to 25).[289][290][291] Their first meeting was in the quarter-finals of the 1961–62 European Cup, which Real Madrid won 3–1 in a replay held in Paris.[290] At the quarter-final stage in 1995–96, Juventus prevailed 2–1 over the two legs and went on to lift the trophy.[290] In the 1998 UEFA Champions League Final between the teams in Amsterdam, Real Madrid won 1–0.[290][292] They met again in the 2002–03 UEFA Champions League semi-finals, when both clubs were in their respective 'golden eras'; Juventus won 4–3 on aggregate.[290] By that time, star midfielder Zinedine Zidane, who played for the Bianconeri in the 1998 final, had moved from Turin to Madrid in a world record €77 million deal.[293] The teams met again in the 2013–14 UEFA Champions League group stage, with Madrid winning 2–1 at home and drawing 2–2 away en route to their tenth title. In the 2014–15 UEFA Champions League semi-finals, former Real Madrid player Álvaro Morata scored one goal in each leg to take Juventus to the final, winning 3–2 on aggregate, while Cristiano Ronaldo scored both goals for Madrid.[290] They faced off again in the 2017 UEFA Champions League Final in Cardiff, with Ronaldo scoring twice as Real Madrid won 4–1.[290][294][295] The latest Champions League meeting was in the 2017–18 quarter-finals, which Real Madrid won 4–3 on aggregate; the tie ended in dramatic and controversial fashion, with a debatable penalty awarded to Real Madrid in the last minute of the second leg after Juventus built a 3–0 lead at the Bernabeu to pull level in the tie following a defeat at the Allianz Stadium by the same scoreline.[296][297] Cristiano Ronaldo scored three goals over the two matches including the decisive penalty and a spectacular overhead kick,[298] and having won the Champions League with Madrid for a fourth time,[299] he transferred to Juventus a few months later for a €117 million fee.[300] It was under Florentino Pérez's first presidency (2000–2006) that Real Madrid started its ambition of becoming the world's richest professional football club.[301] The club ceded part of its training grounds to the city of Madrid in 2001, and sold the rest to four corporations: Repsol YPF, Mutua Automovilística de Madrid, Sacyr Vallehermoso and OHL. The sale eradicated the club's debts, paving the way for it to buy the world's most expensive players, such as Zinedine Zidane, Luís Figo, Ronaldo and David Beckham. The city had previously rezoned the training grounds for development, a move which in turn increased their value, and then bought the site.[79] The European Commission started an investigation into whether the city overpaid for the property, to be considered a form of state subsidy.[302] The sale of the training ground for office buildings cleared Real Madrid's debts of €270 million and enabled the club to embark upon an unprecedented spending spree which brought big-name players to the club. In addition, profit from the sale was spent on a state-of-the-art training complex on the city's outskirts.[303] Although Pérez's policy resulted in increased financial success from the exploitation of the club's high marketing potential around the world, especially in Asia, it came under increasing criticism for being too focused on marketing the Real Madrid brand and not enough on the performances of the team.[82] By September 2007, Real Madrid was considered the most valuable football brand in Europe by BBDO. In 2008, it was ranked the second-most valuable club in world football, at €951 million (£640 million / $1.285 billion),[304] only beaten by Manchester United, which was valued at €1.333 billion (£900 million).[305] In 2010, Real Madrid had the highest turnover in football worldwide.[306] In September 2009, Real Madrid's management announced plans to open the club's own dedicated theme park by 2013.[307] A study at Harvard University concluded that Real Madrid \"is one of the 20 most important brand names and the only one in which its executives, the players, are well-known. We have some spectacular figures in regard to worldwide support of the club. There are an estimated 287 million people worldwide who follow Real Madrid.\"[308] In 2010, Forbes evaluated Real Madrid's worth to be around €992 million (US$1.323 billion), ranking them second only to Manchester United, based on figures from the 2008–09 season.[309][310] According to Deloitte, Real Madrid had a recorded revenue of €401 million in the same period, ranking first.[311] Along with Barcelona, Athletic Bilbao and Osasuna, Real Madrid is organised as a registered association. This means that the club is owned by its supporters, who elect the president. The president cannot invest his own money,[312] and the club can only spend what it earns, which is mainly derived through sponsorships, commercial partnerships, merchandise sales, television rights, prize money and ticket sales. Unlike a limited company, it is not possible to purchase shares in the club, but only a membership.[313] The members of Real Madrid, called \"socios\", form an assembly of delegates which is the highest governing body of the club.[314] As of 2010, the club had 60,000 socios.[315] At the end of the 2009–10 season, the club's board of directors stated that Real Madrid had a net debt of €244.6 million, €82.1 million lower than the previous fiscal year. Real Madrid announced that it had a net debt of €170 million after the 2010–11 season. From 2007 to 2011, the club made a net profit of €190 million.[316][317] During the 2009–10 season, Real Madrid made €150 million through ticket sales, the most of any club in top-flight football.[316] Real Madrid has the highest number of shirt sales per season, around 1.5 million.[316] For the 2010–11 season, Madrid's wage bill totalled €169 million, which was second-highest in Europe behind Barcelona;[318] furthermore, its wage bill to turnover ratio was the best in Europe at 43 percent, ahead of Manchester United and Arsenal at 46 percent and 50 percent, respectively. In 2013, Forbes listed the club as the world's most valuable sports team, worth $3.3 billion.[319] Real Madrid was valued at €3.47 billion ($4.1 billion) in 2018, and in the 2016–17 season it was the second highest-earning football club in the world, with an annual revenue of €674.6 million.[320] In November 2018, the average first-team pay at Madrid was £8.1m ($10.6m) per year, making it the second-highest paid sports team in the world after Barcelona.[321][322] In 2022, Forbes listed Real Madrid as the most valuable football club in the world, at $5.1 billion.[323] Real Madrid was the featured club in the second installment of the Goal! football movie trilogy, Goal! 2: Living the Dream... (2007). The film follows former Newcastle United star Santiago Muñez as he is first scouted and then signed by Real Madrid for the 2005–06 season. The film's creators wanted to put emphasis on the changes in Muñez's life after his move to Madrid. Production was done with the full support of UEFA, allowing the film crew to use many real life players in cameo roles. Real Madrid squad members featured in the film included Iker Casillas, Zinedine Zidane, David Beckham, Ronaldo, Roberto Carlos, Raúl, Sergio Ramos, Robinho, Michael Owen, Míchel Salgado, Júlio Baptista, Steve McManaman and Iván Helguera. Non-Real Madrid players to make cameo appearances included Ronaldinho, Thierry Henry, Lionel Messi, Samuel Eto'o, Andrés Iniesta, Pablo Aimar, Freddie Ljungberg, Cesc Fàbregas and Santiago Cañizares. In the film, both Florentino Pérez and Alfredo Di Stéfano presented the fictional player Muñez to the club after his signing.[324] Real, The Movie is a 2005 part feature, part documentary film that showcases the worldwide passion for Real Madrid. Produced by the club and directed by Borja Manso, it follows five sub-stories of fans from around the world and their love for the club. Along with the fictional portion of the film, it also contains real footage of the squad, during training at Ciudad Real Madrid, matches, and interviews. Although the film mentions all of the squad, it mainly focuses on galácticos such as David Beckham, Zinedine Zidane, Raúl, Luís Figo, Ronaldo, Iker Casillas and Roberto Carlos, among others. The film was originally produced in Spanish, but has been dubbed for their worldwide fanbase. The book White Storm: 100 years of Real Madrid by Phil Ball was the first English-language history of Real Madrid. Published in 2002, it talks about the most successful moments of the club during its first centenary, having been translated into various languages. In late 2011, Real Madrid released a digital music album, entitled Legends, and a remix of the club's anthem, \"Himno del Real Madrid,\" was released as the first single from the album.[325] Real Madrid TV is an encrypted digital television channel, operated by Real Madrid and specialising in the club. The channel is available in Spanish and English. It is located at Ciudad Real Madrid in Valdebebas (Madrid), Real Madrid's training centre. Hala Madrid is a magazine published quarterly for the Real Madrid club members and the Madridistas Fan Club card holders.[326] The phrase Hala Madrid, meaning \"Forward Madrid\" or \"Go Madrid\", is also the title of the club's official anthem, which is often sung by the Madridistas (the club's fans).[6] The magazine includes reports on the club's matches in the previous month, as well as information about the reserve and youth teams. Features often include interviews with players, both past and present, and the club's historic matches.[326] Real Madrid has appeared in many football-based video games, namely in the FIFA, EA Sports FC, and Pro Evolution Soccer series. A Real Madrid player has appeared on the cover of both titles a combined seven times. In 2007, Spanish game publisher Virgin Play signed a deal with the club to make officially licensed Real Madrid video games. The only one released under the deal (due to Virgin Play's liquidation in September 2009) would end up being Real Madrid: The Game, which was developed by Atomic Planet Entertainment and was published under Virgin Play's publishing division V.2 Play in May 2009 for the PlayStation 2, PlayStation Portable, Windows, Wii and Nintendo DS exclusively in European territories Virgin Play released their products in. The game featured a career mode with a mixture of role-playing and simulation as well as arcade-styled Football gameplay. Spanish teams are limited to three players without EU citizenship. The squad list includes only the principal nationality of each player; several non-European players on the squad have dual citizenship with an EU country. Also, players from the ACP countries in Africa, the Caribbean, and the Pacific that are signatories to the Cotonou Agreement are not counted against non-EU quotas due to the Kolpak ruling.

Real Madrid was officially founded in 1902, though its history can be traced back to 1897. It joined the Royal Spanish Football Federation in 1909. Real Madrid has won 15 European Cup/Champions League titles, far more than any other team. Real Madrid has won the Copa del Rey, Spain’s main football cup competition, 20 times. Real Madrid played at several venues until club president Santiago Bernabéu spearheaded the construction of the stadium that today bears his name. Opened in 1947, the Bernabéu holds more than 80,000 spectators. Real Madrid's biggest rivalry is with FC Barcelona. Matches between Barcelona and Real Madrid are known as El Clásico (“The Classic”). Real Madrid, Spanish professional football (soccer) club based in Madrid. Known for their all-white uniforms, which led to its nickname “Los Blancos,” Real Madrid is one of the world’s best-known teams. Real Madrid grew out of Football Club Sky, a team formed in Madrid in 1897. The club was officially founded in 1902 and joined the Royal Spanish Football Federation in 1909. Real Madrid played at a variety of venues until ambitious club president Santiago Bernabéu spearheaded the construction of the stadium that bears his name. Opened in 1947, the Bernabéu holds more than 80,000 spectators and was the venue for the 1982 Fédération Internationale de Football Association (FIFA) World Cup final. The European Cup was first held during the 1955–56 season, with a prestigious field consisting of clubs that had won their own country’s league championship. Real Madrid was the tournament’s first winner, defeating French club Stade de Reims in the final. It continued on a run of European dominance that no team has matched since. Gifted players such as Ferenc Puskás, Alfredo Di Stéfano, Paco Gento, Hector Rial, and Miguel Muñoz helped the club win the first five European Cups in a row. The club’s play in the 1960 European Cup final against the West German team Eintracht Frankfurt—a 7–3 Real victory—is widely considered one of the finest club performances of all time. Real has won a total of 15 European Cup/Champions League titles, far more than any other team. 1956, 1957, 1958, 1959, 1960, 1966, 1998, 2000, 2002, 2014, 2016, 2017, 2018, 2022, 2024 Real Madrid has won more Spanish top-division (La Liga) championships (36) than any other Spanish side. The club has also won the Copa del Rey, the main Spanish cup competition, 20 times and the Supercopa de España (Spanish Super Cup) 13 times. It won UEFA Cup twice, in 1985 and 1986. Real’s local competition is Atlético Madrid, but the club’s biggest rivalry is with FC Barcelona. The tension between the football clubs from Spain’s two biggest cities was amplified by a struggle between the teams in the 1950s to sign Di Stéfano, who reneged on a proposed deal with Barcelona to sign with Madrid, helping Real become a football power in the 1950s and ’60s. Matches between Barcelona and Real Madrid are known as El Clásico (“The Classic”) and are watched throughout Spain, in large part because the two sides symbolize for many the ongoing political and cultural difficulties between Castilian (Real) and Catalonian (Barcelona) Spain. From the late 1990s Real Madrid spent enormous sums on luring some of the world’s most famous foreign players to the club, where they are known as galácticos (“superstars”). Those players were often the most expensive (by transfer fee) footballers in the world and included such stars as David Beckham, Luis Figo, Ronaldo, Zinedine Zidane, Kaká, Cristiano Ronaldo, and James Rodriguez. Sergio Ramos and Iker Casillas are other notable players of this era. Following his departure from Paris Saint-Germain after the 2023–24 season, Kylian Mbappé joined Real Madrid.",

                "content": "Jimmy Butler III (born September 14, 1989) is an American professional basketball player for the Miami Heat of the National Basketball Association (NBA). Nicknamed \"Jimmy Buckets\", he is a six-time NBA All-Star, a five-time All-NBA Team member, and a five-time NBA All-Defensive Team member. He won a gold medal as a member of the 2016 U.S. Olympic team. Butler played one year of college basketball for Tyler Junior College before transferring to Marquette University. He was selected with the 30th overall pick in the 2011 NBA draft by the Chicago Bulls. In 2015, he was named the NBA Most Improved Player. After six seasons in Chicago, he was traded to the Minnesota Timberwolves in June 2017, and was then again traded in November 2018, this time to the Philadelphia 76ers. In July 2019, he signed with the Heat. During his first season with the team, Butler reached the NBA Finals. In 2021, he led the league in steals. In 2023, Butler and the eighth-seeded Heat played in the 2023 NBA Finals, their second appearance in four years.[1][2] Butler was born in Houston on September 14, 1989.[3][4] His father, Jimmy Butler Jr., left the family when Butler was an infant. When he was 13 years old and living in the Houston suburb of Tomball, his mother kicked him out of the house. As Butler remembered it in a 2011 interview, she told him, \"I don't like the look of you. You gotta go.\" He moved between the homes of various friends, staying for a few weeks at a time before moving to another house.[5] Butler maintains a relationship with his parents, saying, \"I don't hold grudges. I still talk to my family. My mom. My father. We love each other. That's never going to change.\"[6][7] In a summer basketball league before his senior year at Tomball High School, he was noticed by Jordan Leslie, a freshman football and basketball player at the school, who challenged him to a three-point shooting contest. The two became friends, and Butler stayed at Leslie's house for a few months, Leslie's mother and stepfather had six other children between them. Butler would later say, \"They accepted me into their family. And it wasn't because of basketball. She [Michelle Lambert, Leslie's mother] was just very loving. She just did stuff like that. I couldn't believe it.\"[5] As a junior at Tomball High, Butler averaged 10 points per game. As a senior and team captain in 2006–07, Butler averaged 19.9 points and 8.7 rebounds per game and was subsequently voted his team's most valuable player. Butler was not recruited coming out of high school and chose to attend Tyler Junior College in Tyler, Texas. After his freshman season at Tyler Junior College, where he had averaged 18.1 points, 7.7 rebounds, and 3.1 assists per game, Butler received interest from Division I programs. Considered a two-star recruit by 247Sports.com,[8] he was listed as the No. 127 junior college prospect in 2008.[9] Butler accepted an athletic scholarship to attend Marquette, where, as a sophomore in the 2008–09 season, he averaged 5.6 points and 3.9 rebounds per game and recorded a free-throw percentage of 76.8%. He moved into the starting lineup as a junior during the 2009–10 season to average 14.7 points and 6.4 rebounds per game and received All-Big East Honorable Mention honors. Butler had two game-winning shots versus UConn and St. John's, to help Marquette finish 11–7 in the Big East and earn its fifth consecutive NCAA tournament appearance. As a senior in 2010–11, he averaged 15.7 points per game and received All-Big East Honorable Mention for the second straight year.

On May 7, he was named the 2014–15 NBA Most Improved Player and became the first player in franchise history to win the award.[23] On July 9, 2015, Butler re-signed with the Bulls to a five-year, $95 million contract. The deal included a player option for the fifth year.[24][25] On December 9, he scored a then career-high 36 points in a loss to the Boston Celtics.[26] He topped that mark with 43 points on December 18 in a 147–144 quadruple overtime loss to the Detroit Pistons.[27] On January 3, Butler broke Michael Jordan's team record for points in a half, scoring 40 of his 42 after the break to lead the Bulls to a 115–113 win over the Toronto Raptors.[28] Two days later, he recorded 32 points and a then season-high 10 assists in a 117–106 win over the Milwaukee Bucks.[29] On January 14, he scored a career-high 53 points in a 115–111 overtime win over the Philadelphia 76ers.

He became the first Bulls player to score 50 points since Jamal Crawford in 2004.[30] On February 5, Butler suffered a left knee strain in a game against the Denver Nuggets[31] and missed around four weeks.[32] He was voted to play in the 2016 NBA All-Star Game, but the injury forced him to drop out, and he was subsequently replaced by teammate Pau Gasol.[33] Butler missed 11 games with the knee injury, returning to action for the Bulls on March 5 against the Houston Rockets. In 34 minutes of playing, he recorded 24 points, 11 rebounds, 6 assists and 1 steal in a 108–100 win, helping the Bulls break a four-game losing streak.[34] He returned to the sidelines on March 7 for the team's game against the Milwaukee Bucks due to back soreness and swelling in his left knee.[35] After a three-game absence, he returned to play on March 14 against the Toronto Raptors.[36] On April 2, he recorded his first career triple-double with 28 points and career highs of 17 rebounds and 12 assists in a 94–90 loss to the Detroit Pistons.[37] In the Bulls' season finale on April 13, Butler recorded his second career triple-double with 10 points, 12 rebounds and 10 assists in a 115–105 win over the Philadelphia 76ers.[38] In the Bulls' season opener on October 27, Butler scored a team-high 24 points in a 105–99 win over the Boston Celtics.[39] On November 9, he scored 39-points in a 115–107 loss to the Atlanta Hawks.[40] Three days later, he scored 37 points, made all 14 of his free throws, had eight rebounds and a season-high nine assists in a 106–95 win over the Washington Wizards.[41] On November 20, he scored a season-high 40 points in a 118–110 win over the Los Angeles Lakers.[42] The following day, he was named Eastern Conference Player of the Week for games played Monday, November 14 through Sunday, November 20.[43] On December 28, he matched his season-high with 40 points, he hit a 20-footer at the buzzer, scored nine points in the final 21⁄2 minutes, and made all 11 of his free throws, to give the Bulls a 101–99 win over the Brooklyn Nets. Butler ended with 11 rebounds as the Bulls overcame a seven-point deficit in the final three minutes.[44] On January 2, 2017, Butler scored 52 points in a 118–111 win over the Charlotte Hornets. He was a point shy of his career high and scored 20 points in the first half and 17 in the game's final four minutes. He had 12 rebounds and six assists while shooting 21-of-22 from the free-throw line.[45] On January 7, he hit the 40-point mark for the third time in six games, finishing with 42 points in a 123–118 overtime win over the Toronto Raptors.[46] Two days later, he was named Eastern Conference Player of the Week for games played Monday, January 2 through Sunday, January 8.[47] On January 19, Butler was named a starter on the Eastern Conference All-Star team for the 2017 NBA All-Star Game.[48] After questioning the desire of the team's younger players following a loss to the Atlanta Hawks on January 25, Butler was fined and held out of the starting lineup against the Miami Heat on January 27. He finished with three points on 1-for-13 shooting.[49] On February 25, 2017, he recorded his third career triple-double with 18 points, 10 rebounds and 10 assists in a 117–99 win over the Cleveland

Western Conference All-Star reserve.[59] On February 9, in his return to Chicago, Butler scored 38 points in a 114–113 loss to the Bulls.[60] Butler chose to not play in the All-Star Game, prioritizing the stretch run of the season and thought the rest would benefit him.[61] In the Timberwolves' first game after the All-Star break, on February 23 against the Houston Rockets, Butler left the game late in the third quarter with a right knee injury.[62] Two days later, he underwent meniscus surgery and was ruled out indefinitely.[63] Butler returned to play on April 6 and scored 18

the team in the 2019 off-season.[68] A month after requesting this trade, in an October practice of this season, Butler teamed up with third-string players to scrimmage and win against the team's usual starters.[69] When a trade was not achieved prior to the start of the regular season, Butler opted to play for Minnesota in 2018–19.[68] He appeared in 10 of the Timberwolves' first 13 games before being traded in early November.[67][70] On November 12, 2018, Butler was traded, along with Justin Patton, to the Philadelphia 76ers in exchange for Jerryd Bayless, Robert Covington, Dario

assists in a 121–105 win over the Los Angeles Lakers.[76] In Game 1 of the 76ers' first-round playoff series against the Nets, Butler scored a game-high 36 points in a 111–102 loss.[77] In Game 2 of the second round, Butler had 30 points and 11 rebounds to help the 76ers tie the series against the Raptors at 1–1 with a 94–89 win.[78] In Game 6, he scored 25 points in a 112–101 win, helping the 76ers force a Game 7.[79] In Game 7, he made a layup with 4.2 seconds in the fourth quarter to tie the score at 90–all, but the 76ers eventually lost the game 92–90 following Kawhi Leonard's game-winning buzzer beater.[80] On July 6, 2019, Butler signed with the Miami Heat via a sign and trade with the 76ers in a four-team trade.[81] On December 9, Butler was named Eastern Conference Player of the Week after he averaged 27.5 points, 9.0 rebounds and 8.5 assists per game.[82] On December 10, Butler recorded a then career-high 18 rebounds, along with 20 points and 11 assists in a

Heat reached the NBA Finals after defeating the Boston Celtics in the Eastern Conference Finals in six games, earning Butler his first finals appearance.[88] In Game 3 of the NBA Finals, Butler finished with 40 points, 11 rebounds, and 13 assists and became the third player in finals history to record a 40+ point triple-double, joining LeBron James (then with Cleveland) in 2015 and Jerry West with the Los Angeles Lakers in 1969.[89] Butler also became the first player to have more points, rebounds and assists in a finals game than James, who finished with 25 points, 10 rebounds and eight assists. In Game 5, Butler had 35 points, 12 rebounds, 11 assists, and 5 steals to become the first player to register 35+ points, 10+ rebounds, 10+ assists and 5+ steals in a finals game. He is also the second player to reach such stats in NBA playoff history after Gary Payton in 2000. Butler became the second player with multiple 30-point triple-doubles in the same finals series, joining James in 2015. He became the sixth player with multiple triple-doubles in a finals series along with James, Magic Johnson, Larry Bird, Wilt Chamberlain and Draymond Green.[90] The Heat came up short against the Los Angeles Lakers in six games.[91] Butler became only the second player in a finals series to lead his team in points, rebounds, assists, steals and blocks, joining James in 2016. He finished the finals averaging 26.2 points, 8.3 rebounds, 9.8 assists, 2.2 steals and 0.8 blocks per game.[92][93] On February 11, 2021, Butler recorded his 10th career triple-double with 27 points, 10 rebounds and 10 assists in the Heat's 101–94 win over the Houston Rockets.[94] On February 18, Butler logged his 13th career triple-double with 13 points, 10 rebounds and 13 assists in a 118–110 win over the Sacramento Kings, becoming the first player in franchise history with three consecutive triple-doubles. Together with teammate Bam Adebayo who posted 16 points, 12 rebounds and 10 assists, they became the first pair in league history to register triple-doubles in the same game more than once.[95][96] Butler finished the regular season leading the league in steals with 2.1 steals per game. In the playoffs, the Heat were eliminated in a four-game sweep by the Milwaukee Bucks, who would go on to win the NBA Finals. In Game 4, Butler recorded his third career playoff triple-double.[97] On August 7, 2021, Butler was signed to a reported four-year, $184 million contract extension by the Heat.[98][99] On December 28, he recorded 25 points, eight rebounds, and a career-high 15 assists in a 119–112 loss to the Washington Wizards.[100] On January 23, 2022, during a matchup against the Los Angeles Lakers and LeBron James, Butler surpassed James for first place on the Heat all-time triple-doubles list.[101] On February 3, Butler was named a reserve for the 2022 NBA All-Star Game, making it his sixth career All-Star selection.[102] On April 7, Butler and Miami clinched the No. 1 seed in the Eastern Conference.

He became the first player in NBA postseason history to meet all of those benchmarks since steals and blocks were first recorded in 1974. Butler posted his fifth career playoff game with 40 points on 60 percent shooting, and tied with Charles Barkley for third-most over the last 30 playoffs. The only players that have more such games are James (12) and Shaquille O'Neal (8). Butler also achieved the most 40-point, 5-rebound and 5-assist playoff games in Heat history with three, one more than James and Wade.[108][109] On May 21, Butler injured his right knee and did not play in the second half of Game 3.

He made 16 of 29 shots, including 4-of-8 from the three-point range and all 11 free throws. Butler's 47 points were the seventh-most in NBA history for a player facing elimination. He also became the first player since Michael Jordan in 1988 to have multiple games of at least 40 points and four steals in the same series.[111][112] The Heat lost the series in seven games, despite Butler's 35-point and nine-rebound outing in a 100–96 loss in a decisive Game 7, where he missed his game-winning three-pointer with 16 seconds left in the game.[113][114] Butler had his eighth 30-point game of the postseason, making it the most in a single postseason by a Heat player since James in 2013, who also had eight such games.[115][116] On November 10, 2022, Butler scored a season-high 35 points, along with 10 rebounds and eight assists in an 117–112 overtime win over the Charlotte Hornets. He scored eight consecutive Heat points at the end of regulation just to get them into the extra session.[117] On December 2, Butler returned to the lineup after missing the previous seven games with a sore right knee.

In Game 7 against the Celtics, Butler posted 28 points, seven rebounds, six assists and three steals in the 103–84 win.[134][135] In a narrow vote between him and Caleb Martin, Butler was named Eastern Conference Finals MVP, averaging 24.7 points, 7.6 rebounds, 6.1 assists and 2.6 steals per game.[136] In Game 2 of the NBA Finals, Butler put up 21 points and nine assists in a 111–108 win over the Denver Nuggets. He joined LeBron James and Dwyane Wade as the only players in Heat history to put up at least 500 points, 100 rebounds, and 100 assists in a single postseason run.[137] However, the Heat went on to lose the next 3 games of the series to lose the finals in 5 games.[138] On November 16, 2023, Butler scored 36 points in a 122–115 win over the Brooklyn Nets, to lead the Heat to their first seven-game win streak since January 14, 2018.[139] On December 16, Butler put up 28 points alongside a buzzer-beating, game-winning stepback jumper in a 118–116 win over the Chicago Bulls.[140][141] On February 7, 2024, Butler recorded his 16th career triple-double with 17 points, 11 rebounds, 11 assists and three steals in a 116–104 win over the San Antonio Spurs.[142] On March 2, Butler scored a season-high 37 points on 12-of-19 shooting, 3-of-3 from three and 10-of-11 from the free throw line in a 126–120 win over the Utah Jazz.[143] Butler missed the 2024 NBA playoffs following a medial collateral ligament (MCL) sprain he sustained during a play-in game against the Philadelphia 76ers.[144] On November 24, 2024, Butler scored 33 points along with nine rebounds and six assists in a 123–118 overtime win over the Dallas Mavericks.[145] On December 16, he had 35 points, 19 rebounds and 10 assists in a 125–124 loss to the Detroit Pistons, becoming the third player in NBA history to finish with at least 35 points, 19 rebounds, 10 assists and four steals in a game, joining DeMarcus Cousins in 2018 and George McGinnis in 1976.[146] On January 3, 2025, the Heat suspended Butler for seven games, citing multiple instances of conduct detrimental to the team throughout the season. The suspension followed reports of Butler's growing discontent and his statement the previous day that he no longer believed he could be happy playing in Miami.[147] In an official statement, the Heat confirmed that Butler and his representative had requested a trade and announced their intention to consider offers.[148] While attending Marquette, Butler earned a Bachelor of Arts degree in communications.[149][150] Butler is a fan of country and emo music. He starred in the music video of the country song \"Light It Up\" by Luke Bryan[151] and the emo song \"So Much (for) Stardust\" by Fall Out Boy.[152] He is good friends with Mark Wahlberg, whom he met while Wahlberg was filming Transformers: Age of Extinction in Chicago. The two have vacationed in Paris together.[153] Butler became a fan of soccer during the 2016 Summer Olympics, after watching Neymar Jr. play for Brazil. He cites Paris Saint Germain as his favorite team and Neymar as his favorite player.[154] [155] Butler and his girlfriend have two children.[156] He did not make his Heat debut until the fourth game of the 2019–20 NBA season, as he was on paternity leave after the birth of his first child.[157] In the NBA Bubble, Butler opened Big Face Coffee, a side business which he operated out of his hotel room using his French press coffee brewer, charging $20 per cup.[158] A year later, he officially launched his coffee brand, and planned to dedicate his time into the coffee roastery business post-retirement.[159] During the 2023 NBA playoffs, Butler filed a trademark on the name \"Himmy Butler\" for the purpose of launching his own clothing and beverage brand. The nickname \"Himmy\" came from the meme phrase \"he's him\", which rose in popularity during the Heat's Butler-led run during that postseason.[160][161] Butler is a Christian.[162] Butler is featured in the Netflix documentary series, \"Starting 5\", which followed Butler, Anthony Edwards, LeBron James, Domantas Sabonis, and Jayson Tatum through the 2023–24 NBA season and playoffs.[163] Butler's father died on February 8, 2024.[164]",

                "content": "Editions: En/basketball/nba/miami-heat Butler has not played a full game for the Heat since Dec. 16 vs the Detroit Pistons With over two months of the NBA season under our belts, the Christmas games behind us, and teams having played 30-33 games each, we're closer to the midpoint of the season than the beginning. The February 6 trade deadline is fast approaching, and teams like the Lakers have already made moves to bolster their strong start rather than wait for the team to falter. As is the case every year, there are plenty of trade rumors involving All-Stars who are either \"seeking\" a trade or being \"pursued\" by multiple teams. Notable names this year include De'Aaron Fox, following the departure of coach Mike Brown, and Jimmy Butler, whose agent and also Heat president Pat Riley have already denied the swirling rumors. Butler's contract with the Heat expires next season, which would mark seven seasons in Miami - one more than he spent with the Chicago Bulls, the team that drafted him. While he hasn't won a championship like LeBron James or Dwyane Wade, Butler is undeniably a Heat legend. His two Finals appearances and consistent playoff performances solidify his place among the franchise's greats. In his six seasons with Miami, Butler has never missed the playoffs and typically elevates his game in the most critical moments of the season and games. This makes the trade rumors surprising, but for the first time, Butler addressed them publicly during a press conference. True to his personality, he opened with, \"That's a good question. Who knows? I don't. But right now I'm here.\" He also shared that he's motivated by hearing such rumors and appreciates the attention he's getting. Butler hasn't played since December 20, when he left a Heat loss to the Thunder early due to injury. He's expected to return tomorrow against the Pelicans with the goal of starting 2025 healthy and back on the court. Unless a team offers a compelling trade package, it's unlikely that Butler will be moved this offseason. At 35, he remains a top-25 NBA player and team leader, though injuries have been his biggest challenge in recent years. The Heat currently have a 16-14 record, good for seventh place in the Eastern Conference. Tyler Herro is playing the best basketball of his career alongside the always reliable Bam Adebayo. Both are still young, which means if the Heat pursue a trade, Butler would likely be the one sacrificed. Through 20 games this season, Butler is averaging 18.5 points per game, his lowest mark since 2018. Injuries have also limited him to 31 minutes per game, his fewest since 2012. Time and injuries spare no one, but if Butler can stay healthy for the playoffs (still a long way off), the Heat could be a formidable opponent for any team. After all, the Heat culture is a real thing. © Unidad Editorial Información Deportiva, S.L.U. All rights reserved. Follow us",

                "content": "The Los Angeles Lakers are an American professional basketball team based in Los Angeles. The Lakers compete in the National Basketball Association (NBA) as a member of the Pacific Division of the Western Conference. The Lakers play their home games at Crypto.com Arena, an arena they share with the Los Angeles Sparks of the Women's National Basketball Association and the Los Angeles Kings of the National Hockey League.[10] The Lakers are one of the most successful teams in the history of the NBA with 17 championships, the second most in the league behind the Boston Celtics.[11] The franchise began in 1946 as the Detroit Gems of the National Basketball League (NBL).[12] After one season, a new ownership relocated the team to Minneapolis, Minnesota,[13][12] and renamed the team as the Minneapolis Lakers.[14] The Lakers won the 1948 NBL championship before joining the rival Basketball Association of America, where they won the 1949 BAA championship. Following the merger of the NBL and the BAA into the NBA in 1949, the Lakers won four of the next five NBA championships.[15] After struggling financially in the late 1950s, they relocated to Los Angeles before the 1960–61 season. The Lakers made the NBA Finals six times in the 1960s, but lost every series to the Celtics, beginning their long and storied rivalry. In 1968, the Lakers acquired four-time NBA Most Valuable Player (MVP) Wilt Chamberlain, and won their sixth NBA title in 1972, led by coach Bill Sharman. After the retirement of Chamberlain, the team traded for superstar Kareem Abdul-Jabbar. Two big changes came in 1979, first, Jerry Buss purchased the Lakers, and pioneered a vision of basketball as entertainment as well as sport.[16] Second, the Lakers drafted Magic Johnson first overall in the 1979 NBA draft. The combination of Johnson, a prodigy point guard, and dominant center in Abdul-Jabbar provided the Lakers with superstars to anchor their roster. The promotion of head coach Pat Riley in 1981 and addition of forward James Worthy through the 1982 draft established the Lakers as an NBA powerhouse throughout the 1980s. The franchise won five championships in a nine-year span, including two out of three marquee Finals matchups against the Celtics. The Lakers were defeated by their Boston archrivals in the 1984 Finals, but triumphed over them in 1985 and 1987. After Riley departed and Abdul-Jabbar, Johnson, and Worthy retired, the Lakers struggled in the early 1990s. It was not until 1996 when the team traded with the Charlotte Hornets for the draft rights to Kobe Bryant and signed center Shaquille O'Neal that the Lakers returned to dominance during the early 2000s. The superstar duo, along with Hall of Fame coach Phil Jackson, led the Lakers to three consecutive championships between 2000 and 2002, securing the franchise's second \"three-peat\".[17] The dynamic \"Shaq-and-Kobe\" era ended when the Lakers traded away O'Neal after the team lost to the Detroit Pistons in the 2004 Finals. It was not until the Lakers traded for Pau Gasol that Bryant and Jackson returned to the NBA Finals, losing to the Celtics in 2008 but winning championships in 2009 and 2010. The 2010 Finals marked the latest matchup of the Lakers and Celtics, with Los Angeles winning its 16th title. Jackson retired in 2011, and the Lakers endured their longest playoff drought in franchise history. Gasol departed in 2014, and Bryant retired in 2016. After rebuilding seasons with young, highly rated prospects, the Lakers signed superstar LeBron James in 2018.[18] In 2019, the team traded several of those prospects for star big man Anthony Davis.[19] The Lakers—led by James, Davis, and coach Frank Vogel—won the team's 17th championship in 2020, tying the Celtics for the most titles until 2024.[20] The Lakers hold the record for NBA's longest winning streak, 33 straight games, set in 1971–72.[21] 26 Hall of Famers have played for Los Angeles, while four have coached the team. Abdul-Jabbar, Johnson, O'Neal, and Bryant won a combined eight NBA MVP awards with the Lakers.[22] The franchise was founded in 1946 as the Detroit Gems and played in the National Basketball League (NBL) during the 1946–47 season where it finished last in the league with only 4 wins in 44 games. Though the team was scheduled to continue in the NBL the following season,[23] its ownership, faced with high losses due to low attendance and lack of homecourt, decided on selling the team to Ben Berger and Morris Chalfen of Minnesota for $15,000[13][24] Minneapolis sportswriter Sid Hartman played a key behind-the-scenes role in helping put together the deal and later the team.[25] Inspired by Minnesota's nickname, \"Land of 10,000 Lakes\", the team rechristened themselves the Lakers.[26][27] Hartman helped them hire John Kundla from College of St. Thomas, to be their first head coach, by meeting with him and selling him on the team.[28][29] As the franchise had the worst record in the NBL the previous season, it got the first pick in the 1947 Professional Basketball League of America dispersal draft, which they used to select George Mikan. Led by Mikan, the Lakers had a solid roster, which also featured forward Jim Pollard and playmaker Herm Schaefer.[30] In their first season, they led the league with a 43–17 record, later winning the NBL championship that season.[31] In 1948, the Lakers moved from the NBL to the Basketball Association of America (BAA), and Mikan's 28.3 point per game (ppg) scoring average set a BAA record. In the 1949 BAA Finals they won the championship, beating the Washington Capitols four games to two.[32] Following the season, the BAA and the NBL merged to form the National Basketball Association (NBA).[33] In the newly formed league, the Lakers improved to 51–17 record and won their third straight professional championship.[34] In the 1950–51 season, Mikan won his third straight scoring title at 28.4 ppg and the Lakers went 44–24 to win their second straight division title.[35] One of those games, a 19–18 loss against the Fort Wayne Pistons, became infamous as the lowest scoring game in NBA history.[36] In the playoffs, they defeated the Indianapolis Olympians in three games but lost to the Rochester Royals in the next round.[30] During the 1951–52 season, the Lakers won 40 games, finishing second in their division.[37] They faced the New York Knicks in the NBA Finals, which they won in seven games.[38] In the 1952–53 season, Mikan led the NBA in rebounding, averaging 14.4 rebounds per game (rpg), and was named MVP of the 1953 NBA All-Star Game.[35] After a 48–22 regular season, the Lakers defeated the Fort Wayne Pistons in the Western playoffs to advance to the NBA Finals.[38] They then defeated the New York Knicks to win their second straight championship.[39] Though Lakers star George Mikan suffered from knee problems throughout the 1953–54 season, he was still able to average 18 ppg.[40] Clyde Lovellette, who was drafted in 1952, helped the team win the Western Division.[40] The team won its third straight championship in the 1950s and sixth in seven seasons when it defeated the Syracuse Nationals in seven games.[39] Following Mikan's retirement in the 1954 off-season, the Lakers struggled but still managed to win 40 games. Although they defeated the Rochester Royals in the first round of the playoffs, they were defeated by the Fort Wayne Pistons in the semifinals.[41] Although they had losing records the next two seasons, they made the playoffs each year.[37] Mikan came back for the last half of the 1955–56 season, but struggled and retired for good after the season.[42] Led by Lovellette's 20.6 points and 13.5 rebounds, they advanced to the Conference Finals in 1956–57. The Lakers had one of the worst seasons in team history in 1957–58 when they won a league-low 19 games.[43] They had hired Mikan, who had been the team's general manager for the previous two seasons, as head coach to replace Kundla. Mikan was fired in January when the team was 9–30, and Kundla was rehired.[37][44] The Lakers earned the top pick in the 1958 NBA draft and used it to select Elgin Baylor. Baylor, who was named NBA Rookie of the Year and co-MVP of the 1959 NBA All-Star Game, averaged 24.9 ppg and 15.0 rpg helping the Lakers improve to second in their division despite a 33–39 record.[45] After upsetting the Hawks in six games in the division finals, they returned to the NBA Finals, but were swept by the Celtics, beginning their long rivalry.[46] In their last year in Minneapolis, the Lakers went 25–50. On January 18, 1960, the team was coming off a loss and traveling to St. Louis when their plane crash-landed.[49] Snow storms had driven the pilot 150 miles off course when he was forced to land in a cornfield. No one was hurt.[50] Their record earned them the number two pick in the 1960 NBA draft. The team selected Jerry West from West Virginia University.[51] During the 1960 off-season, the Lakers became the NBA's first West Coast team when owner Bob Short decided to move the team to Los Angeles.[52] Led by Baylor's 34.8 ppg and 19.8 rpg, Los Angeles won 11 more than the year before in West's first season.[53] On November 15 that season, Baylor set a new NBA scoring record when he scored 71 points in a victory against the New York Knicks while grabbing 25 rebounds.[54] In doing so, Baylor broke his own NBA record of 64 points. Despite a losing record, the Lakers made the playoffs.[37] They came within two points of the NBA Finals when they lost in game seven of their second round series against St. Louis.[55] Led by Baylor and West at 38.3 and 30.8 ppg respectively,[56] the Lakers improved to 54–26 in 1961–62, and made the finals. In a game five victory, Baylor grabbed 22 rebounds and set the still-standing NBA record for points in a finals game with 61,[57] despite fouling out of the game.[58] The Lakers, however, lost to the Celtics by three points in overtime of game seven.[56] Frank Selvy, after making two jumpers in the final 40 seconds to tie the game,[59][60] missed a potential game-winning 18 foot jump shot in regulation, a miss which he said in June 2010 still haunted him more than 40 years later.[60] Los Angeles won 53 games in 1962–63, behind Baylor's 34.0 ppg and West's 27.1 ppg[61] but lost in the NBA Finals in six games to the Celtics.[61] After falling to 42–38 and losing in the first round of the 1964 NBA playoffs to the Hawks, the team won 49 games in 1964–65. The Lakers surged past the Baltimore Bullets in the division finals, behind West's record-setting 46.3 ppg in the series.[62] They lost again to the Celtics in the Finals however, this time in five games.[63] Los Angeles lost in the finals to Boston in seven games again in 1966, this time by two points.[64] Down by 16 entering the fourth quarter, and 10 with a minute and a half to go, the Lakers mounted a furious rally in the closing moments, which fell just short.[65] After dropping to 36 wins and losing in the first round of the 1967 NBA playoffs, they lost in the finals to the Celtics again in 1968.[37] Los Angeles moved to a brand-new arena, The Forum, in 1967, after playing seven seasons at the Los Angeles Memorial Sports Arena. On July 9, 1968, the team acquired Wilt Chamberlain from the Philadelphia 76ers for Darrell Imhoff, Archie Clark, and Jerry Chambers.[67] In his first season as a Laker, Chamberlain set a team record by averaging a league-leading 21.1 rpg.[68] West, Baylor, and Chamberlain each averaged over 20 points, and Los Angeles won their division.[69] The Lakers and Celtics again met in the finals, and Los Angeles had home court advantage against Boston for the first time in their rivalry. They won the first game behind Jerry West's 53 points,[70] and had a 3–2 lead after five.[71] Boston won the series in seven games however,[72] and earned their 11th NBA Championship in 13 seasons.[73] West was named the first-ever Finals MVP; this remains the only time that a member of the losing team has won the award.[74] In 1970, West won his first scoring title at 31.2 ppg, the team returned to the finals, and for the first time in 16 years, they did not have to face the Celtics; instead playing the New York Knicks, who defeated them 4–3.[75][76] The next season the Lakers were defeated by the Milwaukee Bucks, led by future Laker Lew Alcindor (now known as Kareem Abdul-Jabbar) in the Western Conference Finals.[77] The 1971–72 season brought several changes. Owner Jack Kent Cooke brought in Bill Sharman as head coach,[78] and Elgin Baylor announced his retirement early in the season after realizing that his legs were not healthy enough.[78] Sharman increased the team's discipline.[79] He introduced the concept of the shootaround, where players would arrive at the arena early in the morning before a game to practice shots.[80] They won 14 straight games in November and all 16 games played in December.[78] They won three straight to open the year of 1972 but on January 9, the Milwaukee Bucks ended their winning streak by defeating the Lakers, 120–104.[81] By winning 33 straight games, Los Angeles set a record for longest winning streak of any team in major American professional team sports.[82][83] The Lakers won 69 games that season, which stood as the NBA record for 24 years until the Chicago Bulls won 72 games in 1995–96.[84] Chamberlain averaged a low 14.8 points but led the league in rebounding at 19.2 a game.[85] West's 9.7 assists per game (apg) led the league, he also averaged more than 25 points, and was named MVP of the 1972 NBA All-Star Game.[85] The team failed to score 100 points just once all year,[86] and at the end of the season, Bill Sharman was named Coach of the Year.[87] The Lakers went on to reach the finals against the New York Knicks where they would avenge their 1970 finals loss by defeating them 4 games to 1. Chamberlain tallied 24 points and 29 rebounds in game five and won the NBA Finals Most Valuable Player Award.[88][89] The Lakers won 60 games in the 1972–73 season, and took another Pacific Division title.[90] Wilt Chamberlain, playing in his final season, again led the league in rebounding and set the NBA record for field-goal percentage at 72.7% which stood for several decades.[90] The team defeated the Chicago Bulls in seven games in the conference semifinals, then the Golden State Warriors in five in the Western Division Finals.[90] They played the New York Knicks in the 1973 NBA Finals. Los Angeles took the first game by three points, but New York won the series in five games.[91] During the 1973–74 season, the team was hampered by the loss of West, who played only 31 games before his legs gave out.[92] Goodrich, averaging 25.3 points, helped the team to a late-season surge.[92] Trailing the Golden State Warriors by three games with seven left to play, the Lakers rallied to finish 47–35 and win the Pacific Division.[92] They made the playoffs but managed just one win against Milwaukee in the conference semifinals. Following the season, West retired due to contract disagreements with Cooke, and filed a suit for unpaid back wages.[93] After missing the playoffs in the 1974–75 season, the Lakers acquired Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, who had won three league MVPs by that time.[94] Abdul-Jabbar wanted out of Milwaukee, demanding a trade to either New York or Los Angeles.[95] He was traded for Elmore Smith, Brian Winters, Junior Bridgeman, and Dave Meyers. Abdul-Jabbar had his fourth MVP season in 1975–76, leading the league in rebounding, blocked shots, and minutes played.[96] The Lakers struggled in January, going 3–10, and finished out of the playoffs at 40–42.[96] West and Cooke settled their differences—and the former Laker's lawsuit—and Cooke hired him to replace Sharman as the team's coach.[97] West became upset, however, when Cooke refused to spend the money necessary to acquire forward Julius Erving, who the Nets were selling.[98] Behind another MVP season from Abdul-Jabbar, Los Angeles won the Pacific Division, finishing the 1976–77 season a league-best 53–29.[99] They defeated the Warriors in a seven-game series to open the postseason before being swept by Portland in the Western Conference Finals.[96] During the off-season, Los Angeles picked up Jamaal Wilkes from Golden State and signed first-round draft pick Norm Nixon. In the first two minutes of the first game of the 1977–78 season, Abdul-Jabbar punched Bucks center Kent Benson for an overly aggressive elbow and broke his hand.[100] Two months later, a healthy Abdul-Jabbar got into an altercation with Houston Rockets center Kevin Kunnert after a rebound. The team's starting power forward, Kermit Washington, who was averaging 11.5 points and 11.2 rebounds,[101] entered the fight, and when Rudy Tomjanovich ran in from the bench to break up the action, Washington punched him in the face.[102] Tomjanovich nearly died from the punch, suffering a fractured skull and other facial injuries, which prematurely ended his playing career.[103] Washington, who stated that he assumed Tomjanovich was a combatant, was suspended for two months by the NBA, and released by the Lakers.[104] The team won 45 games despite being down a starter in Washington and not having Abdul-Jabbar for nearly two months, but lost in the first round of the playoffs to Seattle.[105] During the 1978–79 season, the team posted a 47–35 record but lost to the SuperSonics in the semifinal round of the playoffs.[96] In the 1979 NBA draft, Los Angeles selected 6-foot, 9-inch point guard Magic Johnson from Michigan State with the first overall pick.[106] It took Johnson's teammates time to acclimate themselves to his passing ability, as his \"no-look\" passes often caught them unaware. Once they adjusted, his passing became a key part of Los Angeles' offense.[107] The Lakers won 60 games in Johnson's rookie year, and defeated the Philadelphia 76ers in six games in the 1980 NBA Finals. Johnson won the Finals MVP award, after starting at center for the injured Abdul-Jabbar in game six, and tallying 42 points, 15 rebounds, and seven assists.[108] The team fell off in the 1980–81 season, though, as the Lakers lost Johnson for most of the season to a knee injury.[109] The team turned in a 54–28 record and finished second behind the Phoenix Suns in the Pacific Division.[109] The Rockets, led by Moses Malone, defeated Los Angeles in the first round of the playoffs.[109] Early in the 1981–82 season, Johnson complained to the media about head coach Paul Westhead and demanded a trade.[110] Westhead was fired shortly after Johnson's criticisms, and although Lakers' owner Jerry Buss stated that Johnson's comments did not factor into the decision, Johnson was vilified by the national media and booed both on the road and at home.[111][112][113] Buss promoted assistant coach Pat Riley to \"co-head coach\" with Jerry West (although West considered himself Riley's assistant) on November 19 and the team won 17 of its next 20 games.[109][114][115] Nicknamed \"Showtime\" due to the team's new Johnson-led fast break-offense, the Lakers won the Pacific Division title and swept both the Suns and Spurs in the 1982 playoffs.[116] Los Angeles stretched its postseason winning streak to nine games by taking the first contest of the NBA Finals from the 76ers.[109][117] The team won the Finals 4–2 to finish a 12–2 playoff run.[109] On draft night in 1982, the Lakers had the first overall pick (the result of a trade with Cleveland midway through the 1979–80 season, when the Lakers had sent Don Ford and a 1980 first-round pick to the Cavaliers for Butch Lee and their 1982 selection) and selected James Worthy from North Carolina.[118] The Lakers won the Pacific Division at 58–24, but Worthy suffered a leg injury in the last week of the season and missed the rest of the season.[119] Nevertheless, they advanced to play Philadelphia in the 1983 NBA Finals after defeating Portland and San Antonio.[119] The Sixers, however, won the series and the championship in four games.[118] After the season West replaced Sharman as the team's GM.[120] In the 1983–84 season, Los Angeles went 54–28, and played Boston in the Finals for the first time since 1969.[121] The Lakers won two of the first three games. However, Kevin McHale's hard clothesline foul of Lakers forward Kurt Rambis on a fast break is credited as a turning point of the series.[122] Boston won three of the next four to win the title and send Los Angeles's record to 0–8 in Finals series against the Celtics.[121] Using the past year's Finals defeat as motivation, the team won the Pacific Division for the fourth straight year and lost just two games in the Western Conference playoffs. In the NBA Finals, the Celtics were again the Lakers' final hurdle. Los Angeles lost game one of the NBA Finals by a score of 148–114, in what is remembered as the \"Memorial Day Massacre\".[123] The Lakers, behind 38-year-old Finals MVP Abdul-Jabbar, recovered to defeat the Celtics in six games.[124] The team won the title in the Boston Garden and became the first visiting team to ever win an NBA championship in Boston, as the Golden State Warriors later achieved this feat in 2022.[123] In the 1985–86 season, the Lakers started 24–3 and went on to win 62 games and their fifth straight division title.[126] The Rockets, however, defeated the Lakers in five games in the Western Conference Finals. Houston won the series when Ralph Sampson hit a 20-foot jumper as time expired in game five at The Forum.[126] Prior to the 1986–87 season, the Lakers moved A.C. Green into the starting lineup, and acquired Mychal Thompson from the Spurs.[127] Johnson won his first career MVP Award while leading the Lakers to a 65–17 record,[127] and Michael Cooper was named NBA Defensive Player of the Year.[127] Before the season, Riley had made the decision to shift the focus of the offense to Johnson over the 40-year-old Abdul-Jabbar.[128] The Lakers advanced to the NBA Finals by sweeping the Nuggets, defeating the Warriors in five games, and sweeping the SuperSonics in the Western Conference Finals.[129] The Lakers defeated Boston in the first two games of the Finals, and the teams split the next four games, giving Los Angeles their second championship in three seasons.[127] The series was highlighted by Johnson's running \"baby hook\" shot to win game four at Boston Garden with two seconds remaining.[130] Johnson was named the NBA Finals MVP, in addition to regular season MVP.[131] At the Lakers' championship celebration in Los Angeles, coach Riley brashly declared that Los Angeles would repeat as NBA champions,[127] which no team had done since the 1968–69 Boston Celtics. Looking to make good on Riley's promise in the 1987–88 season, the Lakers took their seventh consecutive Pacific Division title with a 62–20 record. They swept the Spurs in the first round of the Western Conference Finals before pulling out a tough seven-game series win over the Utah Jazz led by youngsters Karl Malone and John Stockton. A seven-game Western Conference finals win over the Dallas Mavericks propelled the Lakers to the NBA Finals once again. In their seventh trip to the Finals in nine years, they met the Detroit Pistons. Los Angeles would take the series in seven games, and James Worthy's game seven triple-double earned him a Finals MVP award.[132] The win marked their fifth title in nine years, but would also mark their last title until 2000. In the 1988–89 season, Los Angeles won 57 games and their eighth consecutive Pacific Division crown. They swept through the playoffs defeating Portland, Seattle, and Phoenix. In an eighth trip to the NBA Finals in 10 years, they once again faced the Detroit Pistons.[133] Hampered by injuries to Byron Scott and Johnson, the Lakers were swept by Detroit.[134] Following the 1989 Finals, on June 28, 1989, after 20 professional seasons, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar announced his retirement. The Lakers still cruised through the Pacific Division, winning their ninth consecutive division crown with a 63–19 record. However, after beating the Rockets in the first round, they lost four games to one in the second round of the playoffs to the Suns.[135] Riley announced he was stepping down after the season citing burnout,[136] and was replaced by Mike Dunleavy.[137] Riley's departure received a mixed reaction from the players. They respected his contributions, but some, such as Worthy and Scott, had grown tired of his intense practices and felt he tried to take too much credit for the team's successes.[138] Following the season, 1987 Defensive Player of the Year winner Michael Cooper decided to play in Europe and was waived at his request.[139] The 1990–91 Lakers failed to win the Pacific Division for the first time in 10 years, but still finished with a 58–24 record. After cruising through the Western Conference playoffs, the Lakers found themselves in the NBA Finals once again, their ninth trip to the Finals in 12 years. The 1991 Finals represented a changing of the guard as the Lakers were defeated in five games by the Chicago Bulls, led by superstar Michael Jordan.[140] On November 7, 1991, Magic Johnson announced he had tested positive for HIV and would retire immediately.[141] In their first season without Johnson, the team won 43 games to earn the eighth seed in the Western Conference playoffs.[37] The Lakers were defeated in the first round by Portland. Following the season, head coach Mike Dunleavy was fired. The Lakers would lose 43 games in 1992–93 under Randy Pfund, their first losing season since 1976. The Lakers would still make the playoffs, and would become the first eighth seed to win the opening two games on the road against a number one seed when they took a 2–0 lead against Phoenix.[142] They lost the next two games at home however, then game five in Phoenix in overtime.[142] During the 1993–94 season, Pfund was fired during the season that would result in the Lakers failing to make the playoffs for the first time since 1976. Magic Johnson, would coach the final 16 games of the season with former teammate Michael Cooper as his lead assistant.[143] Johnson decided not to take the job permanently due to what he felt was a lack of commitment from certain players, and Los Angeles ended the season with a 10-game losing streak to finish 33–49.[144][145] Under new coach Del Harris, Los Angeles made the playoffs each of the next two seasons but was eliminated in the second and first rounds respectively.[146][147] The team was led by young guards Nick Van Exel and Eddie Jones.[148] Johnson came out of retirement to return as a player in the 1995–96 season to lead the then 24–18 Lakers to a 29–11 finish.[149] After some run-ins with Van Exel, displeasure with Harris's strategies, and a first-round loss to the Rockets, Johnson decided to retire for the final time after the season.[150] During the 1996 off-season, the Lakers acquired 17-year-old Kobe Bryant from the Charlotte Hornets for Vlade Divac; Bryant was drafted 13th overall out of Lower Merion High School in Ardmore, Pennsylvania in that year's draft, by Charlotte. Los Angeles also signed free-agent Shaquille O'Neal.[151] Trading for Bryant was West's idea, and he was influential in the team's signing of the all-star center.[152] \"Jerry West is the reason I came to the Lakers\", O'Neal later said.[153] They used their 24th pick in the draft to select Derek Fisher.[154] During the season, the team traded Cedric Ceballos to Phoenix for Robert Horry.[155] O'Neal led the team to a 56–26 record, their best effort since 1990–91, despite missing 31 games due to a knee injury.[156] O'Neal averaged 26.2 ppg and 12.5 rpg and finished third in the league in blocked shots (2.88 bpg) in 51 games.[156][157] The Lakers defeated the Portland Trail Blazers in the first round of the playoffs as O'Neal scored 46 points in Game 1 against the Trail Blazers, marking the highest single-game playoff scoring output by a Laker since Jerry West scored 53 against the Celtics in 1969.[156] In the next round, the Lakers lost in five games to the Utah Jazz.[156] In the 1997–98 season, O'Neal and the Lakers had the best start in franchise history, 11–0.[158] O'Neal would miss 20 games on the season due to an abdominal injury.[158] Los Angeles battled Seattle for the Pacific Division title most of the season. In the final two months, the Lakers won 22 of their final 25 games,[158] finishing 61–21, but still finished second to Seattle in the standings.[158] The Lakers defeated Portland three games to one in the first round to advance to face Seattle. Although the Sonics won the first game, the Lakers responded with four straight wins, taking the series,[158] but were swept by the Jazz in the Western Conference Finals.[158] During the 1998–99 season, All-Star guard Eddie Jones and center Elden Campbell were traded to the Charlotte Hornets.[159] The team also acquired J. R. Reid, B. J. Armstrong, and Glen Rice.[160] Head coach Del Harris was fired in February after a three-game losing streak and replaced on an interim basis by former Laker Kurt Rambis.[161] The team finished 31–19 in the strike-shortened season, which was fourth in the Western Conference.[162] The Lakers defeated Houston in the first round of the playoffs, but were swept by San Antonio in the next round. Game four of the series would be the last game ever played at the Great Western Forum.[163] Before the 1999–2000 season, West was prepared to hire Rambis as the team's full-time coach before an outcry from fans and members of the organization caused him to seek out a bigger name.[164] Los Angeles hired former Chicago Bulls coach Phil Jackson, who had coached that team to six championships, and gave him a lucrative $6 million a year contract.[165] He brought along assistant Tex Winter and they installed Winter's version of the triangle offense.[166] The Lakers signed veterans Brian Shaw, John Salley, Ron Harper, and A.C. Green, who was a Laker during the \"Showtime\" era.[155] The team also moved to a new arena, the Staples Center.[167] Led by league MVP O'Neal, the Lakers won 31 of their first 36 games.[168] They finished 67–15, the highest win total since they won 65 in the 1986–87 season.[168] Then eliminated Sacramento and Phoenix in the first two rounds of the playoffs.[169] After the Lakers took a three games to one lead in the Western Conference Finals against Portland, the Trail Blazers won the next two games to force a game seven.[170] The Lakers, who trailed by 15 points in the fourth quarter, would go on 19–4 run to tie the game and eventually win 89–84 to advance to the NBA Finals.[170] In their first trip to the Finals since 1991, the Lakers defeated Reggie Miller and the Indiana Pacers four games to two win their first title since 1988.[171] West retired from his spot in the team's front office after the season after a power struggle between him and Jackson over control of the team's operations.[172] After the season, starters Rice and Green left the team,[173] and Los Angeles signed Horace Grant.[174] The following season, the Lakers won 11 fewer regular season games than the prior year,[175] but swept the first three rounds of the playoffs, defeating the Portland, Sacramento, and San Antonio.[176] They met Allen Iverson and the Philadelphia 76ers in the NBA Finals. Although the Sixers took game one in overtime,[177] the Lakers won the next four games to win their second straight title. Their 15–1 postseason record was the best in NBA history.[178] The Lakers won 58 games in 2001–02. In the playoffs, they swept Portland and defeated San Antonio four games to one to advance to the Western Conference Finals to face Sacramento.[181] The series would go on to be known as one of the greatest playoff matchups in NBA history. The series extended to all seven games and ended in a Lakers victory.[182] In game one, Bryant scored 30 points as the Lakers won, 106–99. The series would then shift in Sacramento's favor, with the Kings winning the next two games. Facing a deficit in game 4, the Lakers had the ball with under 20 seconds to play. After misses by both Bryant and O'Neal, Kings center Vlade Divac tapped the ball away from the rim in an attempt to wind down the clock. It went straight into Robert Horry's hands, who drained a game-winning three with under three seconds to play. After the Kings won game five on a buzzer-beater by Mike Bibby, the Lakers were faced with a must-win game six. In one of the most controversial playoff games in league history (Tim Donaghy's betting scandal), the Lakers would win by four points.[183] The Lakers went on to win game seven in overtime, with the Kings missing numerous potentially game-saving shots and free throws. The Lakers then achieved a three-peat by sweeping Jason Kidd and the New Jersey Nets in the NBA Finals.[184] O'Neal won each of the Finals series' MVP awards, making him the only player besides Michael Jordan to win three consecutive Finals MVPs.[185] The Lakers would attempt a four-peat the following year, but started the 2002–03 season 11–19.[186] However, they finished the season 39–13 to finish 50–32.[187] They defeated Minnesota in the first round of the playoffs, but the four-peat attempt ended as they were eliminated by San Antonio in six games in the second round.[188] During the 2003–04 season, the team was the subject of intense media coverage generated by the teaming of four stars and the sexual-assault case involving Kobe Bryant.[189][190] Before the season, the Lakers signed two-time MVP Karl Malone formerly of the Jazz, and former Seattle Defensive Player of the Year Gary Payton to join O'Neal and Bryant,[191] forming the first \"superteam\" of the 21st century.[192][193] Three of the \"big four\", however, struggled with injuries: O'Neal suffered from a strained calf, Malone an injured knee, and Bryant an injured shoulder.[194][195] The Lakers started 18–3 and finished 56–26 and won the Pacific Division title, entering the playoffs as the No. 2 seed. They defeated Houston, San Antonio, and Minnesota to advance to the NBA Finals.[196] In the Finals, they would lose to Detroit in five games. During the 2004 off-season, the team entered a rebuilding phase when O'Neal was traded to the Miami Heat for Lamar Odom, Brian Grant, Caron Butler, and a first-round draft pick.[197] Bryant and O'Neal had clashed in the past,[198] and the media credited their feud as one of the motivating factors for the trade.[199] Jackson did not return as head coach, and wrote a book about the team's 2003–04 season, in which he heavily criticized Bryant and called him \"uncoachable\".[200][201][202] The Lakers front office said that the book contained \"several inaccuracies\".[203] The Lakers also traded Rick Fox and Gary Payton to Boston, for Chris Mihm, Marcus Banks, and Chucky Atkins before the 2004–05 season.[204] Derek Fisher, frustrated with losing playing time, opted out of his contract and signed with the Warriors.[204] The team hired Rudy Tomjanovich to replace Jackson.[204] After sitting out the first half of the 2004–05 season, Malone announced his retirement on February 13, 2005.[205] Tomjanovich coached the team to a 22–19 record before resigning due to health problems.[206] Assistant Frank Hamblen was named interim head coach to replace Tomjanovich for the remainder of the season.[207] Bryant (ankle) and Odom (shoulder) suffered injuries, and the Lakers finished 34–48, missing the playoffs for only the fifth time in franchise history and the first time since 1994.[37] With the tenth overall pick in the 2005 NBA draft, the Lakers selected Andrew Bynum, a center from St. Joseph High School in Metuchen, New Jersey.[208] The team also traded Caron Butler and Chucky Atkins to Washington for Kwame Brown and Laron Profit.[209] Jackson returned to coach the team after Rudy Tomjanovich resigned midway through the previous season.[210] On January 22, 2006, Bryant scored 81 points against Toronto, the second-highest total in NBA history.[211] Ending the season 45–37, the team made the playoffs after a one-season absence.[212] After taking a three games to one lead in the first round, Phoenix came back to take the series in seven games.[213] In the following season, the Lakers won 26 of their first 39 games,[214] but lost 27 of their last 43—including seven in a row at one point—to finish 42–40.[214] They were eliminated in the first round by Phoenix again.[214] Frustrated by the team's inability to advance in the playoffs, Bryant demanded to be traded in the off-season.[215] Buss initially agreed to seek a trade,[216] but also worked to try to change Bryant's mind.[217] After re-acquiring Derek Fisher, the Lakers started the 2007–08 season with a 25–11 record, before Andrew Bynum, their center who was leading the league in field-goal percentage, went out for the year due to a knee injury in mid-January.[218] In what would become a crucial transfer for the franchise's return to championship form, they acquired the six-time all-star power forward Pau Gasol from the Memphis Grizzlies in a trade in early February and went 22–5 to finish the season.[219] The Lakers' 57–25 record earned them the first seed in the Western Conference.[220] Bryant was awarded the league's MVP award, becoming the first Laker to win the award since O'Neal in 2000.[221][222] In the playoffs, they defeated the Nuggets in four games, the Jazz in six, and the defending champion Spurs in five, but lost to the Celtics in six games in the NBA Finals.[223] In the 2008–09 season, the Lakers finished 65–17; the best record in the Western Conference.[224] They defeated the Jazz in five games, the Rockets in seven and the Nuggets in six, to win the Western Conference title. They then won their 15th NBA championship by defeating the Orlando Magic in five games in the NBA finals.[225] Bryant was named the NBA Finals MVP for the first time in his career.[226] The Lakers, who had added Ron Artest (Metta World Peace)[227] in place of Trevor Ariza in their starting lineup, finished the 2009–10 season with the best record in the Western Conference for the third straight time. On January 13, 2010, the Lakers became the first team in NBA history to win 3,000 regular-season games by defeating the Dallas Mavericks 100–95.[228] They defeated the Oklahoma City Thunder, the Utah Jazz, and the Phoenix Suns in the Western Conference playoffs. In the finals, the Lakers played the Boston Celtics for the 12th time. They rallied back from a 3–2 disadvantage in the series and erased a 13-point deficit in the fourth quarter of the seventh game to defeat the Celtics. This series win gave them their 16th NBA title overall and 11th since they moved to Los Angeles.[229] Bryant was named Finals MVP for the second year in a row, despite a 6–24 shooting performance in game seven.[230] After much speculation, head coach Phil Jackson returned for the 2010–11 season.[231] In the playoffs, the Lakers defeated the New Orleans Hornets in the first round.[232] But their opportunity for a three-peat was denied by the Dallas Mavericks in a four-game sweep of the second round. After the season, it was announced that Jackson will not be returning to coach the Lakers.[233] After Jackson's retirement, former Cleveland Cavaliers head coach Mike Brown was hired as head coach on May 25, 2011.[234] Before the start of the shortened 2011–12 season, the Lakers traded Lamar Odom to the Dallas Mavericks after Odom requested to be traded.[235] On the trade deadline long time Laker Derek Fisher along with a first round draft pick were traded to the Houston Rockets for Jordan Hill.[236] With a 41–25 regular season record the Lakers entered the playoffs as the third seed, the team defeated the Denver Nuggets in the first round in seven games but were eliminated by the Oklahoma City Thunder in the second round in five games.[237][238] On July 4, 2012, Steve Nash of the Phoenix Suns agreed to a sign-and-trade deal that would send him to the Lakers in exchange for the Lakers' 2013 and 2015 first round draft picks, 2013 and 2014 second round draft picks, and $3 million. The trade was made official on July 11, 2012, the first day the trade moratorium was lifted.[239] On August 10, 2012, in a four-team trade the Lakers traded Andrew Bynum and acquired Dwight Howard.[240] The combination of these players with Bryant and Gasol led media outlets to refer to them as a \"superteam\" comparable to the 2003-04 Lakers.[241][242] On November 9, 2012, Mike Brown was relieved of coaching duties after a 1–4 start to the 2012–13 season.[243] Assistant Coach Bernie Bickerstaff took over as interim head coach, leading the Lakers to a 5–5 record. On November 12, 2012, the Lakers hired Mike D'Antoni as head coach.[244] On February 18, 2013, Lakers owner Jerry Buss died from cancer at age 80.[245] On the court, D'Antoni coached the Lakers to a 40–32 record the rest of the way to finish 45–37, their worst record since 2007. The Lakers clinched a playoff berth on the final game of the season and finished seventh in the Western Conference after beating the Houston Rockets on April 16, 2013.[246][247] The Lakers battled injuries all season, the most prominent of which is the Achilles tendon rupture to Kobe Bryant that ended his season after 78 games. The absence of Bryant was sorely felt as the Lakers were swept by the San Antonio Spurs in the first round of the 2013 NBA playoffs.[248] Nevertheless, Bryant passed Lakers legend Wilt Chamberlain to become the fourth all-time leading scorer in NBA history on March 30, 2013, against the Sacramento Kings.[249] On December 8, 2013, Bryant played in his first game since tearing his Achilles tendon on April 12, 2013.[250] However, on December 17, 2013, he suffered a broken bone in his knee, and did not return for the remainder of the season.[251][252] On March 25, 2014, the Lakers scored 51 points in the third quarter against the New York Knicks, the most points scored in a quarter in the history of the franchise.[253] The Lakers went on to miss the NBA playoffs for the first time since 2005, for just the second time in the last two decades and for just the sixth time in franchise history. On April 30, 2014, Mike D'Antoni resigned from his position as head coach after a 27–55 season.[254] After spending the majority of the off-season without a head coach, the Lakers named former player Byron Scott as the new head coach.[255] After the season, he was the frontrunner to become the new Lakers head coach. Scott interviewed three times for the position, which had become vacant after Mike D'Antoni's resignation.[256] On July 28, 2014, he signed a multi-year contract to coach the Lakers.[257] During the first game of the 2014–15 season, the seventh overall pick in the 2014 NBA draft, Julius Randle went down with a broken leg, which ended his rookie season. The Lakers began their season losing 10 of their first 16 games. After playing only 35 games, Kobe Bryant tore a rotator cuff in his shoulder ending his season. Nick Young was also forced to end his season with a fractured kneecap, leaving the team with a record of 14–41.[258] With 27 games left in the regular season, Byron Scott gave rookie Jordan Clarkson more playing time. Clarkson, the 46th overall pick in the 2014 draft, finished his rookie season with game stats of 11.9 ppg, 3.2 rpg, 3.5 apg, and shooting 44.8% from the field.[259] The Lakers' season ended with a record of 21–61, the fourth worst record in the league and at the time the worst record in franchise history. The next season, the Lakers had the second overall pick of the 2015 NBA draft, which they used to select Ohio State freshman point guard D'Angelo Russell. The team also selected Larry Nance Jr. with the 27th overall pick.[260] On November 30, 2015, Bryant announced he would retire at the end of the season after 20 seasons with the team.[261] In Bryant's last season the team missed the playoffs for the third straight year with a 17–65 record, the worst in franchise history.[262] On April 24, 2016, the Lakers announced that they would not exercise their option on Byron Scott's contract for the following season.[263] On April 29, the team announced another former Laker, Luke Walton, as their new head coach. At the time of his hiring, Walton was an assistant coach for the Golden State Warriors, who were in the playoffs, so he could not officially begin his duties as head coach until the Warriors' playoff run was over.[264] The Lakers earned the second overall pick in the 2016 NBA draft,[265] and selected Brandon Ingram from Duke University.[266] The team also selected Ivica Zubac with the 32nd overall pick.[267] On February 21, 2017, the Lakers fired general manager Mitch Kupchak, while Magic Johnson was named as the president of basketball operations. The team's governor Jeanie Buss, also announced the removal of her brother, Jim Buss, from his position as executive vice president of basketball operations.[268][269] On March 7, 2017, the Lakers hired Rob Pelinka as the general manager, signing him to a five-year deal.[270] The Lakers again earned the second overall pick, this time, in the 2017 NBA draft,[271] and selected Lonzo Ball from UCLA.[272] The Lakers also acquired Kyle Kuzma from the University of Utah with the 27th overall pick from a draft-day trade, along with Brook Lopez in exchange for D'Angelo Russell and Timofey Mozgov.[273] The Lakers also traded their 28th overall pick, Tony Bradley, in exchange for the 30th overall pick, Josh Hart, from Villanova University and the 42nd overall pick, Thomas Bryant, from Indiana University.[274] In February 2018, Nance Jr. and Clarkson were traded away to the Cleveland Cavaliers in exchange for Isaiah Thomas, Channing Frye, and a 2018 first-round draft pick.[275] On July 2, 2018, Randle was renounced by the Lakers.[276] On July 9, 2018, the Lakers signed LeBron James to a four-year, $154 million contract.[277][278] By the Christmas Day game, the Lakers were six games over .500 before James sustained a groin injury leading to several weeks of missed games. Ball and Ingram also ended their seasons early due to injuries. On February 7, 2019, Zubac was traded to the Los Angeles Clippers along with Michael Beasley in exchange for Mike Muscala.[279] On April 9, 2019, Johnson stepped down as the team's president of basketball operations,[280] and two days later, the Lakers parted ways with head coach Walton after the team failed to reach the playoffs for the sixth straight year.[281] On May 13, Frank Vogel was named the Lakers' head coach.[282] The Lakers received the fourth overall pick in the 2019 NBA draft lottery.[283] On July 6, the Lakers acquired Anthony Davis from the New Orleans Pelicans for Ball, Ingram, Hart, and three first-round picks, including the number four overall in the 2019 draft.[284] This trade officially ended the young core era of the Lakers; only Kuzma remained out of the group of players. Following the suspension of the 2019–20 NBA season, the Lakers were one of the 22 teams invited to the NBA Bubble to participate in the final eight games of the regular season.[285] The Lakers finished the regular season with a 52–19 record, entering the playoffs for the first time since 2013,[286] and as the top seed for the first time since 2010.[287] They advanced to the NBA Finals for the first time since 2010.[288] They defeated the Miami Heat 4–2 to win the 2020 NBA Finals,[289] and James was named the Finals MVP for the fourth time in his career.[290] The win gave Los Angeles their 17th championship in franchise history, tying the Boston Celtics for the most all-time.[291] Primary Lakers owner Jeanie Buss, who took over the team in 2017, would also become the first female controlling owner of an NBA team to win the NBA Finals.[292] During the 2021 off-season, the Lakers picked up many NBA veterans, the most notable of which was Russell Westbrook, who was acquired in a blockbuster trade with the Washington Wizards. Kyle Kuzma, the last player left from the Lakers' young core era, was traded away, along with others. Other veterans picked up during the off-season included Carmelo Anthony, DeAndre Jordan, and returning players Wayne Ellington, Trevor Ariza, Dwight Howard and Rajon Rondo.[293] Alex Caruso left the Lakers and signed with the Chicago Bulls, and veteran locker-room voice Jared Dudley retired.[294][295] The Lakers made a surprising run in the 2023 Playoffs, making the Western Conference Finals, but were defeated by the eventual champion Denver Nuggets. On December 9, 2023, the Lakers won the inaugural NBA In-Season Tournament after defeating the Indiana Pacers in the championship game. James was named the inaugural tournament MVP.[296] They finished the 2023–24 season 47–35 and beat the New Orleans Pelicans in the Play-In to make the playoffs as the seventh seed. On June 27, 2024, the Lakers selected Bronny James, the son of LeBron, at 55th overall in the 2024 NBA draft, forming the first father-son duo in NBA history.[297] JJ Redick was hired as head coach of the Lakers.[298] On October 23, 2024, the team made NBA history as being the first one to have father and son (LeBron James & Bronny James) play together as they beat Minnesota Timberwolves on their season opening game.[299] The rivalry between the Boston Celtics and the Lakers involves the two most storied basketball franchises in National Basketball Association (NBA) history. It has been called the best rivalry in the NBA.[300] The two teams have met a record 12 times in the NBA Finals, starting with their first Finals meeting in 1959. They would go on to dominate the league in the 1960s and the 1980s, facing each other six times in the 1960s and three times in the 1980s. The rivalry had been less intense since the retirements of Magic Johnson and Larry Bird in the early 1990s, but in 2008 it was renewed as the Celtics and Lakers met in the Finals for the first time since 1987, with the Celtics winning the series 4–2. They faced off once again in the 2010 NBA Finals, which the Lakers won in 7 games. The two teams were tied for the highest number of championships, with 17 titles apiece, until the Celtics surpassed this record in the 2024 NBA Finals; together, the 35 championships account for almost half of the 78 championships in NBA history. The all-time series record for the Lakers vs Celtics is 209–165 with the Celtics being the forerunners. Boston is the only NBA team with an overall winning record against the Lakers.[301] The rivalry between the Lakers and the Detroit Pistons developed in the late 1980s.[302]: 228 Both teams faced each other in back-to-back finals appearances in the 1988 NBA Finals, which the Lakers won in 7 games and the 1989 NBA Finals, which the Pistons won in 4 games. The rivalry reemerged in the early 2000s as both teams squared off against one another in the 2004 NBA Finals, which the Pistons won in five games. The Lakers have a lengthy history with the Golden State Warriors as both franchises relocated to California during the early 1960s. Geography does play a minor role in the rivalry; however there exists more respect between both teams and fans alike, unlike the Dodgers–Giants rivalry of MLB, or the 49ers–Rams rivalry of the NFL in which both teams express fierce animosity against one another.[303][304] The rivalry began to sprout during the 1970s as the two teams would meet six times in the postseason from 1967 to 1991. Both teams fluctuated in success at varying times, however; the Lakers recent rise following the signing of LeBron James contributed heavily to adding a level of competition between both sides as James had previously faced the Warriors in four straight finals as a member of the Cavaliers. Both teams have met seven times in the postseason, combining for 38 division titles since both teams relocated to California in the early 1960s.[305][306] The Lakers lead the all time regular season series 262–173, and the postseason series 25–11.[307][308] The rivalry between the Lakers and the Los Angeles Clippers is unique because they were the only two NBA teams to share an arena, the Crypto.com Arena. It is also one of only two intra-city rivalries in the NBA, the other being the new crosstown rivalry between the New York Knicks and Brooklyn Nets. Los Angeles fans have historically favored the Lakers.[309][310] Some contend that the term rivalry was inaccurate until the Clippers became more successful.[311] The Lakers and the Phoenix Suns rivalry didn't develop until the 2000s where the teams were led by Kobe Bryant and Steve Nash, respectively. The San Antonio Spurs and the Lakers, developed what some would classify as a rivalry in the late 1990s and early 2000s. Since 1999, the teams have met in the NBA Playoffs five times, with the clubs combining to appear in seven consecutive NBA Finals (from 1999 to 2005). Additionally, the teams combined to win five NBA championships from 1999 to 2003; the Spurs won the NBA championship in 1999, 2003, 2005, 2007 and 2014 while the Lakers won the championship in 2000, 2001, 2002, 2009 and 2010. From 1999 to 2004 the clubs' rivalry was often considered the premier rivalry in the NBA,[312] and each time the clubs faced each other in the playoffs the winner advanced to the NBA Finals. In 2008, the teams met again in the Western Conference Finals where the Spurs were handily defeated only to beat the Lakers when they met again in 2013. The Kings and the Lakers have faced each other in the playoffs nine times between 1949 and 2002, and since the Kings moved to Sacramento in 1985, both have been based in California. The 2002 Western Conference Finals was one of the most bitterly contested in NBA history, with many controversial calls in game 6.[313] The Lakers would win the series in game 7. Berger and Chalfen purchased the NBL's disbanded Detroit Gems for $15,000 in 1947, changed their name to the Lakers, and relocated them to Minnesota. Max Winter bought a third of the club in their early years and sold his share to Mikan in 1954. Berger bought Mikan's share in 1956 giving him a controlling (⅔) interest.[314] After Mikan retired, attendance plummeted and the team lost money for several seasons, leading the ownership group to put the team up for sale in 1957.[315] Marty Marion, a retired baseball player and manager, and his business partner Milton Fischman attempted to purchase the team with the intention of moving the club to Kansas City, Missouri.[315][316] Mikan offered to mortgage his home in an attempt to buy the team and keep the club in Minnesota.[317] The Lakers were sold to a group of investors led by Bob Short, however.[314] The team was sold to Short's group with the agreement that it would not be relocated to Kansas City but kept in Minnesota.[318] Short's ownership group consisted of 117 Minnesota businesses and private citizens, who amassed a total of $200,000 for the purchase; $150,000 to buy the team and $50,000 to run it.[314] By 1958 Short had become 80% owner of the team by buying out his partners,[314] but the team was floundering. Attendance remained poor, and the NBA had put the Lakers on \"financial probation\", notifying them that if they did not meet certain ticket sales numbers they could be bought out by the league and relocated. Short was forced to move the team to Los Angeles in 1960; the club had lost $60,000 in the first half of the 1959–60 season alone.[319] The NBA's owners originally voted 7–1 against the move.[320] When Short indicated that he might take the team to a new rival league that was developing, however, the owners held another vote that same day and allowed the relocation (8–0).[321] Aided by Baylor's drawing power,[322][323] and the new locale, the team's finances improved when they arrived in LA.[324][325] Short sold the team to Washington Redskins owner and publisher Jack Kent Cooke in 1965 for a then league record amount of $5.175 million.[326] Short insisted the deal be conducted in cash as he was wary of Cooke, so guards transported the money in a cart from one New York bank to another.[327] Cooke was a more hands-on owner than Short, and overhauled the team's operations.[328] He personally financed construction of the Forum in 1967 at a cost of $16.5 million.[329][330] He owned the team until 1979 when he sold it, the NHL's Los Angeles Kings, the Forum, and some real estate to Jerry Buss for $67 million.[331] Cooke was forced to sell the team as he was undergoing a costly divorce.[332][333] Buss was a local chemical engineer and former University of Southern California professor who had become wealthy in real estate.[330][334] Philip Anschutz bought a stake in the team in 1998,[335] and until October 2010 Magic Johnson was a minority owner as well.[336] Buss started the trend of allowing sponsors to add their name to team's stadiums when he renamed the Forum the Great Western Forum in 1988.[337] In 2009 major sponsors included Verizon Wireless, Toyota, Anheuser-Busch, American Express, and Carl's Jr., and the team's $113 average ticket price was the highest in the league.[335] In 2013, Buss died at the age of 80 after being hospitalized for 18 months with cancer.[338][339][340] His controlling ownership of the team passed to his six children via a trust, with each child receiving an equal vote.[341][342] Buss' succession plan had daughter Jeanie Buss assume his title as the Lakers' governor as well as its team representative at NBA Board of Governors meetings.[342][343] Given the team's proximity to Hollywood, the Lakers fanbase includes numerous celebrities, many of whom can be seen at the Staples Center during home games.[344] Jack Nicholson, for example, has held season tickets since the 1970s, and directors reportedly need to work their shooting schedules around Lakers home games.[345] From 2002 and 2007 the team averaged just over 18,900 fans, which placed them in the top ten in the NBA in attendance. Red Hot Chili Peppers' song \"Magic Johnson\", from their 1989 album Mother's Milk, is a tribute to the former point guard, and frontman Anthony Kiedis and bassist Michael \"Flea\" Balzary are frequently seen attending home games.[346] In 2008, the team sold out every home game,[347] and in 2010, the Lakers had the most popular team merchandise among all NBA teams, and Bryant the most popular jersey.[348] The Laker nickname came from the state of Minnesota being the Land of 10,000 Lakes.[14][349] The team's colors are purple, gold and white.[350][6][351] The Lakers logo consists of the team name, \"Los Angeles Lakers\" written in purple on top of a gold basketball. The team usually wears white jerseys for Sunday and holiday home games.[350][352] List of the last five seasons completed by the Lakers. For the full season-by-season history, see List of Los Angeles Lakers seasons. The Lakers have won 17 NBA titles and have appeared in the NBA Finals 15 other times.[37] These appearances include eight NBA Finals appearances in the 1980s. The best record posted by the team was 69–13, in 1972; the worst record was 17–65, in 2016.[37] Note: GP = Games played, W = Wins, L = Losses, W–L% = Winning percentage Bryant holds most individual team records for longevity including most games played (1,333), and most minutes logged (48,298). Johnson holds all significant assist records for the club including career assists (10,141), assists in a game (24), and highest assist average for a season (13.1). Johnson also has the most triple doubles, with his 138 over 100 more than the next closest player (Bryant; 17). Elmore Smith holds team records for blocks in a game (17), blocks per game for a season (4.85), and career blocks per game (3.93). The scoring records are mostly shared by Elgin Baylor and Bryant, with Baylor having the highest average for a career (27.4) while Bryant has the highest points scored in a single game (81). Baylor, Bryant and West hold the top five single-season scoring averages, with Bryant occupying the first (35.4) and fourth (31.6) spots, while Baylor has the second (34.8), and third (34.0), and West the fifth (31.3).[353][354] The Lakers hold several NBA records as a team including most consecutive games won overall (33) and most consecutive road games won (16), both of which came during the 1971–72 season,[355] highest field-goal percentage for a season at 54.5% (1984–85),[356] and highest road winning percentage at 0.816 (1971–72).[66] They also hold records for having (into the 2009–10 season) the most wins (3,027), the highest winning percentage (61.9%), and the most NBA Finals appearances (31).[37][357] The 2000–01 team set the NBA record for best playoff record at 15–1, which was later broken by the Golden State Warriors in 2017.[358] The 1971–72 team holds franchise records in wins (69), most points scored, and largest margin of victory; both of the latter came in the team's 63 point win versus Golden State (162–99).[359] They also held the record for most wins at home in the regular season (going 36–5 in 1971–72, then 37–4 in both 1976–77 and 1979–80) unil the Boston Celtics set the current record of 40–1 in the 1985–86 season. The Lakers play their home games at Crypto.com Arena, located at L.A. Live in downtown Los Angeles. The arena opened in fall 1999 and seats up to 18,997 for Lakers games.[360] Owned and operated by AEG and L.A. Arena Company, the arena is also home to the Los Angeles Clippers, the WNBA's Los Angeles Sparks, and the NHL's Los Angeles Kings.[360] Before moving to Staples Center, for 32 seasons (1967–1999), the Lakers played their home games at The Forum in Inglewood, California, located approximately 10 miles southwest of the team's current home.[167] During the 1999 preseason, the Lakers played their home games at the Forum before officially moving into Crypto.com Arena, and once again hosted a preseason game versus the Golden State Warriors on October 9, 2009, this time to commemorate the team's 50th-anniversary season in Los Angeles.[361] In the first seven years in Los Angeles, the team played their home games at the Los Angeles Memorial Sports Arena, south of downtown Los Angeles.[362] While the team played in Minneapolis, the team played their home games at the Minneapolis Auditorium and the Minneapolis Armory from 1947 to 1960.[363] Roster Last transaction: December 29, 2024 The Lakers hold the draft rights to the following unsigned draft picks who have been playing outside the NBA.[364] A drafted player, either an international draftee or a college draftee who is not signed by the team that drafted him, is allowed to sign with any non-NBA teams. In this case, the team retains the player's draft rights in the NBA until one year after the player's contract with the non-NBA team ends.[365] This list includes draft rights that were acquired from trades with other teams. The Lakers have had three first overall picks in their history: Elgin Baylor (selected in 1958), Magic Johnson (selected in 1979) and James Worthy (selected in 1982).[368] The Lakers have also had six lottery picks in their history: Eddie Jones (selected tenth overall in 1994), Andrew Bynum (selected tenth overall in 2005), Julius Randle (selected seventh overall in 2014), D'Angelo Russell (selected second overall in 2015), Brandon Ingram (selected second overall in 2016) and Lonzo Ball (selected second overall in 2017).[368] Other draft picks include Jerry West and Gail Goodrich in the 1960s, Michael Cooper and Norm Nixon in the 1970s, A.C. Green and Vlade Divac in the 1980s, Elden Campbell, Nick Van Exel, Derek Fisher and Devean George in the 1990s, and Luke Walton, Sasha Vujačić, and Ronny Turiaf in the 2000s.[368] There have been 29 head coaches for the Lakers franchise. John Kundla coached the team in Minneapolis when they won their first five BAA/NBA championships from 1949 to 1954.[52] Pat Riley is second in franchise history in both regular season and playoff games coached and wins.[369] Phil Jackson broke Riley's regular-season wins record in 2009, and he passed Riley's playoff wins and games coached records in 2010.[369] Jackson, Riley, Kundla, and Bill Sharman have all been inducted into the Basketball Hall of Fame for their coaching careers. George Mikan, Jim Pollard, Jerry West, Pat Riley, Magic Johnson, Kurt Rambis, Byron Scott and Luke Walton have all played and head-coached for the Lakers. Jackson, who had two stints as head coach, was coach from 2005 to 2011. In May 2011, Mike Brown was named his replacement for the 2011–12 season.[370] Brown was fired[371] on November 9, 2012, after a 1–4 start. Assistant coach Bernie Bickerstaff served as interim head coach for five games before the Lakers selected Mike D'Antoni as their new head coach. D'Antoni resigned at the end of the 2013–14 season. In July 2014, Byron Scott was hired as head coach.[372] After the 2015–16 season ended, Scott was fired. On April 29, 2016, former Lakers player Luke Walton was named as Scott's replacement,[373] and served as head coach until the end of the 2018–19 season.[374] Frank Vogel was named his successor on a multiyear deal announced on May 13, 2019.[375] Vogel was fired following the conclusion of the 2021–22 season.[376] On June 6, 2022, Darvin Ham was named as Vogel's successor as head coach.[377] However, Ham was fired by the Lakers on May 3, 2024, after the Lakers were eliminated in Game 5 of the first round by the Denver Nuggets. Among his accomplishments was leading the Lakers to their first In-Season Tournament championship.[378] On June 24, 2024, former NBA player JJ Redick was hired as the 29th coach in team history.[379] The Lakers have 41 Hall of Famers (31 players, 5 head coaches, 1 assistant coach, and 4 contributors) who contributed to the organization.[380][381][382] Notes: The Lakers have retired thirteen jersey numbers and an honorary microphone in honor of their players and broadcaster:[392][393][394][395][396] On January 13, 2025, Michael Cooper will have his #21 jersey retired.[397] In addition, several other players and coaches who were instrumental to the franchise's success during its days in Minneapolis have a banner commemorating them as Hall of Fame members of the Minneapolis Lakers, although jersey numbers for these players are not retired by the franchise:[400] For 41 years, Chick Hearn was the team's broadcaster until his death in 2002. He broadcast 3,338 consecutive games between November 21, 1965, and December 16, 2001.[401] Hearn came up with West's \"Mr. Clutch\" nickname.[402] He was a part of the team's \"inner sanctum\" when Cooke was owner, and was consulted on basketball decisions.[403] Paul Sunderland, who had filled in for a couple of games while Hearn recuperated in the 2001–02 season, was named the permanent play-by-play announcer. Stu Lantz was retained as the color commentator.[404] When Sunderland's contract expired in the summer of 2005, the team chose not to renew it.[405] Then, Joel Meyers moved in alongside Lantz as the television announcer, with Spero Dedes and former Laker player Mychal Thompson on the radio.[406] For the 2011–12 season, Bill Macdonald became the new television play-by-play announcer, joining Lantz who remained as the color analyst. Meanwhile, John Ireland joined Mychal Thompson to call the games on radio.[407] Beginning in the 2009–10 season, Lakers radio broadcasts were heard on KSPN (Los Angeles ESPN Radio affiliate) in English and KWKW in Spanish.[406][408] KLAC had the team's radio broadcast rights from the 1976–77 season until the 2008–09 season.[408][409] Until 2011, telecasts had been split between KCAL-TV (road games) and Fox Sports West (home games), unless they are chosen for national broadcasts on ABC.[410] KCAL had been the Lakers' over-the-air television broadcaster since 1977, dating back to when the station was the RKO General-owned KHJ-TV, the longest relationship between an NBA team and a television station. Prior to KHJ, Laker games were televised on KTLA. The Lakers had been on Fox Sports West since 1985, dating to when it was the original Prime Ticket and owned by Buss.[411] On February 14, 2011, Time Warner Cable and the Lakers announced the formation of two new regional sports networks (one in English, one in Spanish) that would exclusively televise the team's games and related programming for 20 years starting with the 2012–13 season.[412] The said networks were originally known as Time Warner Cable SportsNet, before it was renamed Spectrum SportsNet in 2016 upon Charter Communications' purchase of Time Warner Cable.[413]",

                "title": "Virginia Tech Hokies football - Wikipedia",
                "content": "The Virginia Tech Hokies football team represents Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University in the sport of American football. The Hokies compete in the Football Bowl Subdivision (FBS) of the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) and the Coastal Division of the Atlantic Coast Conference. They previously competed in the Big East. Their home games are played at Lane Stadium, located in Blacksburg, Virginia, with a seating capacity of over 65,000 fans. Lane Stadium is considered to be one of the loudest stadiums in the country, being voted number two in ESPN's 2007 \"Top 20 Scariest Places to Play\".[2] It was also recognized in 2005 by Rivals.com as having the best home-field advantage in the country.[3] Since beginning football in 1892, the Hokies have won over 700 games and appeared in 33 bowl games, including the 2000 BCS National Championship game. The Hokies rank 23rd among all Division I college football teams for most wins. The program had a streak of 27 consecutive bowl appearances, starting with the 1993 Independence Bowl and lasting through the 2019 Belk Bowl.[4] This was fourth-longest streak of consecutive bowl game appearances in college football history.[5] The program has also claimed eleven conference titles (3 South Atlantic, 1 Southern, 3 Big East, and 4 ACC) and produced eight Consensus All-Americans.[6][7] Virginia Agricultural and Mechanical College (now Virginia Tech) first played football on October 21, 1892, against St. Albans Lutheran Boys School (Radford, Virginia). The game took place on a plowed off wheat field that was \"about as level as a side of Brush Mountain\".[8] The Hokies won their first game 14–10, but were defeated 10–0 eight days later on a return trip to Radford.[9] The first several VAMC teams wore cadet gray and black, but in 1896 the colors were changed to Burnt Orange and Chicago Maroon – a color combination that was unique among educational institutions at the time. The 1899, 1901, and 1903 teams lost only to rival Virginia. Star player Hunter Carpenter returned to Virginia Tech in 1905, after a year at the University of North Carolina, for a last shot at beating Virginia. Carpenter helped lead VPI to a 9–1 record, the best in school's history up to that time. He was never named to the All-America team only because Walter Camp, who named the team at the time, said he would never name a player who he had not seen play. The 1909 team claim a southern championship. This is the first season the team was referred to in print as the \"Gobblers,” which became the official nickname in 1912.[10] At the end of the 1911 season, VPI joined the South Atlantic Intercollegiate Athletic Association (SAIAA). They won the conference in 1916 and 1918. After 1921, the SAIAA was dissolved and six of its schools became founding members of the Southern Conference. From 1925 to 1928, Tech was led by Frank Peake and the \"Pony Express\" backfield. He was joined by Scotty MacArthur, Herbert \"Mac\" McEver and Tommy Tomko.[11] In 1927, during a 6–0 upset of the Colgate Red Raiders in New York, Peake ran for nearly 200 yards and scored the game's only points. During one three-game stretch, he accumulated rushing and return yardage of 306, 314 and 353 yards. He was credited with gaining 1,761 yards in eight games. 930 were from scrimmage, and 831 on punts and kickoffs.[12] In 1928 the game against Virginia he came off the sideline with an injured hip to return a punt for a touchdown.[11] In 1932, Tech upset Georgia 7–6.[13] Bill Grinus blocked the tying extra point.[14] Virginia Tech's first post-season bowl appearance was in the 1947 Sun Bowl in El Paso, Texas, against the University of Cincinnati.[15] Tech had a 3–3–3 record that year, and was the third choice after Border Conference champions Hardin–Simmons University and runner-up Texas Tech Red Raiders both declined the bowl invitation.[16] Tech lost that game 18–6. Another first for the Gobblers came in 1954 when they had their first, and only, unbeaten season in school history. The team was 8–0–1 and finished ranked 16th in the Associated Press post-season football poll.[17] The team's lone blemish was a 7–7 tie against William & Mary in Blacksburg, Virginia. Despite the team's success, it did not appear in a post-season bowl game. The 1963 team captured Tech's only outright SoCon championship.[13] In the 1970s, Tech briefly adopted an aggressive passing offense under head coach Charlie Coffey; quarterback Don Strock set virtually every passing record in the Hokies' book and would hold many for 30 years or more. Success, though, remained elusive. In the early 1980s, football coach and athletic director, Bill Dooley spearheaded a campaign for a new look and name for the mascot, which debuted at the 1981 football game against Wake Forest. The turkey-like figure was referred to as \"the Hokie mascot\", \"the Hokie\", and \"the Hokie bird\" (derived from the \"Old Hokie\" cheer), which resulted in changing the official designation of the Virginia Tech mascot to the Hokies. Dooley led the Hokies to the program's first-ever bowl win, in the 1986 Peach Bowl over NC State, but he also earned the program NCAA sanctions that led to his resignation that very offseason (after which he promptly sued the school). Though many hoped for recently departed Maryland coach Bobby Ross, athletic director Dutch Baughman turned to Frank Beamer, a Hokie alumnus and defensive back from 1966 to 1968. Beamer had worked his way up the assistant coaching ladder since his 1969 graduation before spending six seasons in the head job at Murray State. Among the assistants Beamer brought with him from the Racers was linebackers coach Bud Foster, who had joined Beamer's first Murray State staff as a graduate assistant immediately upon his own graduation there. Virginia Tech joined the Big East Conference for football play in 1991 (later joined for all sports in 2000). The Hokies were competitive in the new league early on, but could never beat annual foe, the Miami Hurricanes, despite eventually having a 6–6 record vs. the Hurricanes during the Big East years.[18] In 1993, the Hokies earned a trip to the Independence Bowl in Shreveport, Louisiana, its first bowl game under Beamer. With a win in that game, the Hokies notched only the fourth nine-win season in school history at the time. It became the first of 23 straight bowl games under Beamer, until he retired in 2015. After finally beating the Hurricanes during the 1995 regular season, the 13th ranked Hokies clinched a berth in the Sugar Bowl in New Orleans, Louisiana–the program's first appearance in a major bowl game. They beat the 9th ranked Texas Longhorns 28–10. This was a signature win for the Hokies, capping the most successful season to date; it became turning point for the program as a whole. Virginia Tech's most successful football season was in 1999 under the guidance of redshirt freshman quarterback, Michael Vick. Among other amazing moments, on November 3, the Hokies came from behind on the road, to win against the West Virginia Mountaineers. Vick led a desperate last minute drive that culminated in a dramatic Shayne Graham game-winning field goal. The 22–20 victory has since become known as the \"Miracle in Morgantown.\"[19] The team completed the year with its first ever undefeated regular season, finishing with an (11–0) record. On January 4, 2000, the Hokies faced the Florida State Seminoles in the 2000 Sugar Bowl for the national championship. A back and forth game, the Hokies trailed 28–7 late in the second quarter but came back to take a 29–28 lead at the start of the fourth. However, they were not able to hold on and the Seminoles won 46–29. The Hokies finished third in the AP Poll and second in the Coaches Poll–in both cases, the highest final ranking in school history and the highest ever for a Division I team from the Commonwealth. The following season, in 2000, the Hokies were again contenders for the national championship, but a loss to No. 3 Miami in early November, in a game in which Michael Vick was limited because of an injury, cost them a trip to the Orange Bowl. The Hokies later went on to defeat the Clemson Tigers 41–20 in the 2001 Gator Bowl in Jacksonville, Florida. At the start of the 2004 season, the Hokies faced the No. 1 and eventual national champion USC Trojans in the BCA Classic played at FedExField in Landover, Maryland. The Hokies kept the game close, but eventually lost 24–13. The regular season ended with the Hokies winning the ACC championship in their first year in the conference and a return to the Sugar Bowl and a match-up with the Auburn Tigers. Auburn, the SEC champion and one of three undefeated teams (USC and Oklahoma being the other two), took a 16–0 lead into the fourth quarter. Led by senior quarterback Bryan Randall, the Hokies scored 13 points but fell just short of the comeback when the Tigers recovered an onside kick and ran out the clock. The 2005 season saw many ups and downs, but would end in disappointment. Taking over for Bryan Randall was Marcus Vick, younger brother of Hokies great Michael Vick. The Hokies started off the season 8–0, including victories over West Virginia and ACC rivals Georgia Tech and Boston College. Going into the tenth week of the season, the Hokies were ranked 3rd in the country behind USC and Texas and would face the 5th ranked Miami Hurricanes at home. In anticipation of the match-up, ESPN's College Gameday would broadcast the game nationally from Blacksburg on ESPN. The Hurricanes controlled the game and limited Marcus Vick to only 90 yards passing to win 27–7. Marcus Vick led the Hokies and went on to win the ACC Coastal Division title, but lost in the ACC Championship Game to Florida State. The Hokies again trailed the Seminoles by double digits at halftime, 27–3, but a Vick led comeback brought the score to 27–22 with 1:45 left in the fourth quarter. The Hokies were unable to recover the onside kick and lost their chance at a BCS Bowl berth. The Hokies closed the season against the upstart Louisville Cardinals in the 2006 Gator Bowl. Virginia Tech won 35–24, but the game would become infamous for a play that would contribute to Vick's expulsion from the team. Late in the first half, with the Hokies trailing 17–10, Vick was tackled by Cardinals defensive end Elvis Dumervil. After the play, Vick stomped on Dumervil's leg, apparently out of anger. Four days after the game, Virginia Tech officials learned of two misdemeanor charges of speeding and driving on a suspended or revoked driver's license that Vick received on December 17, 2005. Vick, who was forced to sit out the 2004 football season by the university due to previous legal incidents in his college career, was dismissed from the team on January 6, 2006, with the university citing \"a cumulative effect of legal infractions and unsportsmanlike play.\".[20] Redshirt sophomore quarterback Sean Glennon was set to take over for Vick in the 2006 season. Although consecutive losses to Georgia Tech and Boston College knocked the Hokies out of contention for the ACC Championship Game, the Tech team finished the season strong, winning six in a row and being invited to the 2006 Chick-fil-A Bowl in Atlanta. In the annual ACC vs SEC match-up, the Hokies played the Georgia Bulldogs. At halftime the Hokies led 21–3, but four second half Glennon turnovers helped the Bulldogs in coming back and winning 31–24. After the April 2007 Virginia Tech shootings that stunned the campus and nation, the remainder of Tech's spring practice was canceled. The Hokies, led by running back Brandon Ore on offense and linebackers Vince Hall and Xavier Adibi looked to be in contention for a berth in the National Championship. The 2007 home opener against the East Carolina Pirates was the subject of College GameDay, and the Hokies prevailed in an emotional, albeit shaky, game 17–7. They then traveled to Baton Rouge, Louisiana, to play the LSU Tigers. In a game that saw Glennon replaced by true freshman quarterback Tyrod Taylor, the Hokies were completely dominated, only managing 149 total yards against the Tigers' 598. Taylor scored the only touchdown of the night after an 8-play, 65-yard drive. Taylor continued to start until an injury removed him from a 43–14 blowout of Duke. In a Thursday night match-up with Boston College, Glennon reclaimed his starting position. In a game plagued by rain storms and wet conditions, the Hokies took a 10–0 lead late into the fourth quarter. However, Eagles quarterback Matt Ryan spurred a late Boston College comeback, leading two TD drives in the final five minutes for a 14–10 win. Despite the devastating loss, Virginia Tech rebounded to win the remainder of its regular season games and claim the Coastal Division crown. A rematch with Boston College in the ACC Championship Game saw Tech fall behind early, tie the game by halftime, and then grind out a tense 30–16 win to advance to the Orange Bowl in Miami. After 29 seasons as head coach of Virginia Tech, legendary coach Frank Beamer retired following the conclusion of the 2015 season. He coached the Hokies to 23 consecutive bowl games, including a national championship appearance, along with seven conference championship titles. Beamer signed an 8-year contract with Virginia Tech, serving as an ambassador for the Athletic Department. During Beamer's tenure at Virginia Tech, putting points on the scoreboard became a full team effort with the offensive, defensive and special teams units. Often when the team scores one or more non-offensive touchdowns, the style of play is described as \"Beamerball\". Since Beamer's first season in 1987, a player at every position on the defensive unit has scored at least one touchdown, and 35 different players have scored touchdowns on Virginia Tech's special teams.[21] Sometime before the 1995 season, defensive coordinator Bud Foster wanted to give his defense something to rally around, an identity. A battered metal lunch pail was chosen as a symbol of a no-name, blue-collar defense. Each week a list of goals in put in the lunch pail and a player is chosen to have the honor of carrying the lunch pail onto the sidelines.[22][23][24] The Lunch Pail Defense Foundation was founded to fund academic scholarships for students from the area near Blacksburg, Virginia.[25] On November 27, 2015, former Memphis Head Coach, Justin Fuente was named the new head coach of the Virginia Tech Hokies. Fuente took over the team from the retiring, legendary coach Frank Beamer, following the 2015 Independence Bowl game. The Hokies finished Fuente's first year in 2016 with a regular season record of 9–3 and an overall record of 10–4. The Hokies became Coastal Division Champions for the 6th time and the first time since 2011. The Hokies played Clemson in the ACC Championship Game, losing 42–35. The team went to the 2016 Belk Bowl, in Charlotte, NC, defeating Arkansas, 35–24. Fuente was named the 2016 ACC Coach of the Year and he received many other accolades for the 2016 season. In 2017, the Hokies went 5–3 in ACC play, finishing second to Miami in the Coastal division, with an overall record of 9–4.[26] This result was good for a #22 ranking in the final 2017 CFB playoffs poll.[27] Earning a bowl game bid, Virginia Tech eventually lost to the Oklahoma State Cowboys 30–21 in the 2017 Camping World Bowl. The Hokies' performance slid under Fuente in their 2018 season. This time they finished fifth in the Coastal Division, posting a 4–4 conference standing and 6–7 overall record, losing their sole game against a ranked team.[28] They then lost 35–31 to the Cincincati Bearcats in the 2018 Military Bowl. Fuente steered Virginia Tech to better result in their 2019 campaign. The Hokies notched a 5–3 conference standing, ending up second to the Virginia Cavaliers in Coastal Conference play. In a dramatic game against the North Carolina Tarheels on October 19, 2019, the Hokies defeated their division rival 43–41 in 6 overtimes.[29] They went 1–1 against ranked opponents, with an overall record of 8–5.[30] Though the Hokies didn't have a final CFB playoff ranking, they did reprise their 2016 Belk Bowl appearance, this time facing the Kentucky Wildcats in the 2019 Belk Bowl, where they ended up losing 37–30.[31] The Hokies started the 2020 season ranked #24 in the preseason poll, ranking as high as #18 in by week four, then hovering around the top 20 until they eventually fell out of the poll after ranking #19 in week seven.[32] Fuente guided the team to a middling result, tallying a 5–5 ACC record and 5–6 overall standing.[33] Virginia Tech then ended its 27-year bowl game appearance record – the nation's longest streak at the time – opting to forgo postseason play. The challenges presented by the pandemic, combined with concerns over Fuente's performance, prompted the surprise announcement a day after a virtual press conference on Tuesday, December 15, 2020, called by Athletic Director Whit Babcock.[34][35] Virginia Tech kept Fuente at the helm as it began its 2021 season, producing a 4–4 ACC result and third-place finish in the Coastal Division, and a 6–7 overall record.[36] Fuente was fired with two regular season games remaining on November 16, 2021, after compiling an overall record of 43–31 in six seasons.[37] J. C. Price took over as interim coach to wrap-up the season. The Hokies then faced the Maryland Terrapins in the 2021 Pinstripe Bowl, losing 54–10. On November 30, 2021, the Hokies hired Penn State defensive coordinator and linebackers coach Brent Pry as the new head coach.[38] In his first season, the Hokies had a 3–8 record, 1–6 in the ACC. In year two, Pry led the Hokies to their first winning season since 2019. Tech trounced UVA 55–17 in the regular season finale in Charlottesville, to earn a bowl bid.[39] Then Tech beat Tulane 41–20 in the Military Bowl in Annapolis to finish 7–6. Virginia Tech claims 11 conference championships.[40]: 136–140 † Co-champions Virginia Tech won the ACC Championship in its inaugural season in the league in 2004. In 2005, the ACC Conference created two divisions, the Atlantic and Coastal, and a championship game between the divisions was established. Virginia Tech has appeared in the ACC Championship Game as the winner of the Coastal Division six times. Virginia Tech won the Coastal division in 2005 and played Florida State in the ACC Championship. Florida State won, 27–22. During the 2007 season, the Hokies once again took the Coastal division to set up a rematch of their earlier loss to Boston College. Virginia Tech prevailed 30–16. History repeated itself in 2008, when the Hokies defeated Boston College by a score of 30–12 after having lost to the Eagles during the regular season. In 2010 Virginia Tech went undefeated in league play, defeating Atlantic Division winner Florida State in the league championship game in Charlotte, North Carolina, 44–33. In 2011 Virginia Tech lost to Clemson for a 2nd time that season, their only two season losses. In 2016, Virginia Tech would fall short to Clemson, making a 3rd loss. † Co-champions The ACC eliminated Divisions for the 2023 season. The two teams with the highest winning percentage against other ACC teams play for the conference championship. Virginia Tech has played in 36 bowl games. The Hokies have appeared in several Gator, Peach, Sugar, Belk, Military and Orange bowls. Their overall record in bowl games is 14–22 through the 2024 season.[41] Virginia Tech and Virginia first met in 1895 and have played annually since the year 1970. Since 1964, the game has always been played at either Lane Stadium or Scott Stadium on the campuses of the two universities. But the series has at times been played in Richmond (1903, 1904, and 1957); Norfolk (1940, 1941, and 1942); and Roanoke (in 17 of the 19 years between 1945 and 1963). At 97 games, it is the longest series for the Hokies and second-longest for the Cavaliers, after the 118-game series between Virginia and North Carolina known as the South's Oldest Rivalry. The game counts for 1 point in the Commonwealth Clash each year, and is part of the greater Virginia–Virginia Tech rivalry. Virginia Tech leads in the Commonwealth Cup series 17–3[citation needed][when?] and the football series 58–38–5 as of 2019.[42] Three times this game has determined the Coastal Division champions with VT winning in 2007 and 2011, and UVA winning in 2019. The Hokies and West Virginia Mountaineers met 51 times between 1912 and 2005. The two teams played as conference foes from 1991 to 2003 as members of the Big East Conference (1979–2013). They met every year from 1973 to 2005. The Black Diamond Trophy is the trophy that goes to the winner of the game. It was introduced in 1997 and was meant to symbolize the Appalachian region's rich coal heritage (the phrase \"black diamond\" is often used as a term for coal.) Virginia Tech held the trophy in six of the nine years in which it was contested. The last two games played where on September 18, 2021, in Morgantown with West Virginia winning 27–21, and September 22, 2022, in Blacksburg with West Virginia winning 33–10. There are no further games scheduled in the series after the 2022 season. West Virginia leads the series 30–23–1 as of 2022.[43] The Hurricanes and Hokies first met on November 13, 1953, in Miami. Miami and Virginia Tech have met in two bowl games, the 1966 Liberty Bowl and 1981 Peach Bowl. The two teams have played annually since 1992, and the rivalry developed when the Hokies became a member of the Big East Conference for football in 1991. When the Atlantic Coast Conference (ACC) expanded in 2004, both Miami and Virginia Tech became members of the ACC. Both teams continue to compete annually as part of the ACC's Coastal Division. Miami leads the series 22–15 as of 2022.[44] The last game between the two teams was October 15, 2022, in Blacksburg, and Miami won 20–14. The two teams will next play during a yet to specified date in the 2025 season at Miami's home stadium, Hard Rock Stadium in Miami Gardens. One of the Hokies' younger rivals is Georgia Tech. Prior to the Hokies joining the ACC in 2004, Virginia Tech and Georgia Tech had only met once previously (an additional scheduled meeting was canceled due to extreme weather). Since the ACC adopted divisional format for football, one of these two teams had represented the ACC Coastal Division in every ACC Championship Game except the 2013 season when Duke won the Coastal and 2015 when UNC won it. Over the years, the rivalry has become a significant annual matchup in the ACC, specifically when both teams are in both regularly in the AP Top 25 and the race for the Coastal Division championship. Virginia Tech leads the series 10–7 as of 2019, with Virginia Tech winning the past meeting.[45] The Boston College-Virginia Tech football rivalry began in 1993 with a 48–34 Boston College win in Chestnut Hill when the two teams began Big East conference round-robin play. When the two schools moved to the Atlantic Coast Conference the rivalry continued as the two schools were chosen as permanent cross-divisional rivals. The teams played twice in both the 2007 and 2008 seasons, as both teams won their respective divisions of the ACC and played each other in the conference championship. Although the Eagles defeated the Hokies in both the regular seasons those two years, Virginia Tech won the 2007 and 2008 ACC Championship Game played between the two schools. Virginia Tech leads the series 19–10 as of 2020, with Virginia Tech winning the past meeting.[46] Virginia Tech and VMI first met in 1894 and played annually from 1913 to 1971, usually in Roanoke on Thanksgiving Day. Like the current rivalry between VMI and The Citadel, the match-up was referred to as the Military Classic of the South, due to the military heritage of both schools. Starting again in 1973, the teams would continue to play on a yearly basis, making multiple appearances together in the Tobacco Bowl (1974, 1976) and Oyster Bowl (1980, 1982, 1984). The 1984 Oyster Bowl is the last time they played each other. However, in 2017, Virginia Tech and VMI agreed to a one-time rivalry matchup on September 5, 2026, at Lane Stadium. At 79 games, it is the second-longest series for the Hokies and fourth-longest for the Keydets. Due to the long pause of the VMI-VPI series, the Virginia–Virginia Tech rivalry has emerged as the dominant one in the state. Virginia Tech leads the series 49–25–5 as of 2019, with Virginia Tech winning the past six meetings. In 2002, the Virginia Tech athletics department developed a new policy on retiring jerseys. This special honor is bestowed to acknowledge an individual who has won an established national award in their sport. The Hokies has retired five numbers.[47] Additionally, Virginia Tech has four retired jerseys. These numbers can be worn normally by any player.[47] For the 2023 season, the ACC implemented a 3–5–5 scheduling system, with Pittsburgh, Virginia, and Wake Forest serving as the three teams played every year in a home-and-home basis.[48] On September 1, 2023, the ACC voted to add University of California, Berkeley, Southern Methodist University, and Stanford University to the conference starting in the 2024–25 school year,[49] which made the 3–5–5 schedule obsolete. Due to the expansion in 2024, the ACC is now scheduling games without a specific algorithm, and the conference released a schedule for 2024–2030 in October 2023.[50] Additionally, each season every ACC team schedules four non-conference games, including at least one against a \"Power 5\" team (which can include other ACC teams or FBS independent Notre Dame).[51] Announced opponents as of November 3, 2023.

                "content": "Gobbler Country's coverage of Virginia Tech Hokies football. The undermanned Hokies put up a fight, but it wasn’t enough. Carnell Warren is a big addition if the Hokies can keep him. It’s the last preview of the 2024 season, and it’s actually 2025. Several changes and lots of portal and sit-out losses make it a tough call for the Hokies. Bud Foster’s going to be on the microphone and headset for this one for the defense. Take the poll, hazard a guess. GO HOKIES!!! This Virginia Tech team will look MUCH different than the team from the regular-season finale. No, the bowl game hasn’t been played, so technically the season isn’t over, but in reality, the season is over, and it’s time to review the major issues facing the Hokies for 2025. Lots of changes already in the works, but let's look at the general issues. GO HOKIES!!! Another former Mountaineer transfers to Hokies. Seldon was Virginia’s top high school player in 2023. Another new defensive back for the Hokies. This is a big get for Brent Pry. The Hokies continue reshaping their secondary. A busy couple of days for the Hokies, who add talent to the defensive backfield. Well, the portal taketh away, but if you work it right it giveth back. The Hokies pick up three really important new players and manage to keep a critical player on defense. We also check the Fall graduate list and see and very favorite name. Isaiah Ford came back to school and earned his degree. GO HOKIES!!! The Hokies are finally on the board Is Michael Vick the new Coach Prime? It’s the post season, and the personnel roster activity is going on with wild abandon. The non-traditional stuff (Transfer Portal and NIL) is making a big mess, but there are still the traditional announcements that will mean serious next level consideration for some players. GOHOKIES!!! The Hokies are officially a feeder program. Some good news for the Hokies. The first shoe in the changes to the Virginia Tech Hokie football coaching staff dropped this evening, rather late. We received official word from the program that Coaches Marve, Crook, and Strength and Conditioning Coach Gault have been let go. Delane has one year of eligibility remaining Let the fun begin. The Hokies will travel pretty close to home for a much better bowl than we expected. The January 3rd Duke’s Mayo Bowl is a solid opportunity for the Hokies to grab another bowl victory in front of a crowd that promises to be full of Maroon and Orange. The opponent in this one is the B1G Minnesota Golden Gophers and it’s not going to be a cakewalk. GO HOKIES!!! Incoming freshman QB AJ Brand earns a prestigious honor. As it turns out, there was one surprise during the early signing period. South Carolina cornerback Jordan Crim is a Hokie. Two Hokies make first-team All-ACC. A disappointing season ends with good news, as it often does. But now, the real fun begins. The Hokies finally manage to survive a 3rd quarter on defense. They also manage to finally shut down a surprising Tony Muskett Wahoo QB run game in the 4th quarter. Hokies keep the Commonwealth Cup and are finally bowl eligible on their last try for the season. GO HOKIES!!! Watson’s first half of his first start could not have gone any better. The last time the Hoos ventured out I-64 and down I-81 to play the Hokies was the 2020 COVID fiasco season. That’s a long time and almost none of their players will remember Lane Stadium because even then there was no crowd allowed. Will Tech pull off a tepid season rescue? GO HOKIES!!! The winner goes bowling. Brent Pry gives quarterback update for regular-season finale. Virginia Tech must now beat Virginia to become bowl-eligible. Gambling Problem?

                "title": "Alcohol and Cancer Risk Fact Sheet - NCI",
                "content": "What is alcohol? What is the evidence that alcohol drinking can cause cancer? How does alcohol affect the risk of cancer? How does the combination of alcohol and tobacco affect cancer risk? Can people's genes affect their risk of alcohol-related cancers? Can drinking red wine help prevent cancer? What happens to cancer risk after a person stops drinking alcohol? Is it safe for someone to drink alcohol while undergoing cancer chemotherapy? What is alcohol? Alcohol is the common term for ethanol or ethyl alcohol, a chemical substance found in alcoholic beverages such as beer, hard cider, malt liquor, wines, and distilled spirits (liquor). Alcohol is produced by the fermentation of sugars and starches by yeast. Alcohol is also found in some medicines, mouthwashes, and household products (including vanilla extract and other flavorings). This fact sheet focuses on cancer risks associated with the consumption of alcoholic beverages. According to the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism, a standard alcoholic drink in the United States contains 14.0 grams (0.6 ounces) of pure alcohol. Generally, this amount of pure alcohol is found in: These amounts are used by public health experts in developing health guidelines about alcohol consumption and to provide a way for people to compare the amounts of alcohol they consume. However, they may not reflect the typical serving sizes people may encounter in daily life. According to the federal government’s Dietary Guidelines for Americans, 2020–2025, individuals who do not drink alcohol should not start drinking for any reason. The Dietary Guidelines also recommends that people who drink alcohol do so in moderation by limiting consumption to 2 drinks or less in a day for men and 1 drink or less in a day for women. Heavy alcohol drinking is defined as having 4 or more drinks on any day or 8 or more drinks per week for women and 5 or more drinks on any day or 15 or more drinks per week for men. What is the evidence that alcohol drinking can cause cancer? There is a strong scientific consensus that alcohol drinking can cause several types of cancer (1, 2). In its Report on Carcinogens, the National Toxicology Program of the US Department of Health and Human Services lists consumption of alcoholic beverages as a known human carcinogen. The evidence indicates that the more alcohol a person drinks—particularly the more alcohol a person drinks regularly over time—the higher his or her risk of developing an alcohol-associated cancer. Even those who have no more than one drink per day and binge drinkers (those who consume 4 or more drinks for women and 5 or more drinks for men in one sitting) have a modestly increased risk of some cancers (3–7). Based on data from 2009, an estimated 3.5% of cancer deaths in the United States (about 19,500 deaths) were alcohol related (8). Clear patterns have emerged between alcohol consumption and the development of the following types of cancer: Numerous studies have examined whether there is an association between alcohol consumption and the risk of other cancers. For cancers of the ovary, prostate, stomach, uterus, and bladder, either no association with alcohol use has been found or the evidence for an association is inconsistent. However, evidence is accumulating that alcohol consumption is associated with increased risks of melanoma and of prostate and pancreatic cancers (4, 15). Alcohol consumption has also been associated with decreased risks of kidney cancers (16–18) and non-Hodgkin lymphoma (19, 20) in multiple studies. However, any potential benefits of alcohol consumption for reducing the risks of some cancers are likely outweighed by the harms of alcohol consumption. In fact, a recent study that included data from more than 1,000 alcohol studies and data sources, as well as death and disability records from 195 countries and territories from 1990 to 2016, concluded that the optimal number of drinks to consume per day to minimize the overall risk to health is zero (21). That study did not include data on kidney cancer or non-Hodgkin lymphoma. Alcohol consumption may also be associated with an increased risk of second primary cancers. For example, a meta-analysis of data from 19 studies showed that among patients with cancer of the upper aerodigestive tract (UADT)—which includes the oral cavity, pharynx, larynx, and esophagus—for every 10 grams of alcohol consumed per day before the first UADT cancer diagnosis there was a 1.09-fold higher risk of a second primary UADT cancer (22). It is less clear whether alcohol consumption increases the risk of second primary cancers at other sites, such as the breast (23–25). How does alcohol affect the risk of cancer? Researchers have hypothesized multiple ways that alcohol may increase the risk of cancer, including Alcoholic beverages may also contain a variety of carcinogenic contaminants that are introduced during fermentation and production, such as nitrosamines, asbestos fibers, phenols, and hydrocarbons. The mechanisms by which alcohol consumption may decrease the risks of some cancers are not understood and may be indirect. How does the combination of alcohol and tobacco affect cancer risk? Epidemiologic research shows that people who use both alcohol and tobacco have much greater risks of developing cancers of the oral cavity, pharynx (throat), larynx, and esophagus than people who use either alcohol or tobacco alone. In fact, for oral and pharyngeal cancers, the risks associated with using both alcohol and tobacco are multiplicative; that is, they are greater than would be expected from adding the individual risks associated with alcohol and tobacco together (10, 26). Can people's genes affect their risk of alcohol-related cancers? A person’s risk of alcohol-related cancers is influenced by their genes, specifically the genes that encode enzymes involved in metabolizing (breaking down) alcohol (27). For example, one way the body metabolizes alcohol is through the activity of an enzyme called alcohol dehydrogenase, or ADH, which converts ethanol into the carcinogenic metabolite acetaldehyde, mainly in the liver. Recent evidence suggests that acetaldehyde production also occurs in the oral cavity and may be influenced by factors such as the oral microbiome (28, 29). Many individuals of East Asian descent carry a version of the gene for ADH that codes for a \"superactive\" form of the enzyme. This superactive ADH enzyme speeds the conversion of alcohol (ethanol) to toxic acetaldehyde. Among people of Japanese descent, those who have this form of ADH have a higher risk of pancreatic cancer than those with the more common form of ADH (30). Another enzyme, called aldehyde dehydrogenase 2 (ALDH2), metabolizes toxic acetaldehyde to nontoxic substances. Some people, particularly those of East Asian descent, carry a variant of the gene for ALDH2 that encodes a defective form of the enzyme. In people who produce the defective enzyme, acetaldehyde builds up when they drink alcohol. The accumulation of acetaldehyde has such unpleasant effects (including facial flushing and heart palpitations) that most people who have inherited the ALDH2 variant are unable to consume large amounts of alcohol and therefore have a low risk of developing alcohol-related cancers. However, some individuals with the defective form of ALDH2 can become tolerant to the unpleasant effects of acetaldehyde and consume large amounts of alcohol. Epidemiologic studies have shown that such individuals have a higher risk of alcohol-related esophageal cancer, as well as of head and neck cancers, than individuals with the fully active enzyme who drink comparable amounts of alcohol (31). These increased risks are seen only among people who carry the ALDH2 variant and drink alcohol—they are not observed in people who carry the variant but do not drink alcohol. Can drinking red wine help prevent cancer? The plant secondary compound resveratrol, found in grapes used to make red wine and some other plants, has been investigated for many possible health effects, including cancer prevention. However, researchers have found no association between moderate consumption of red wine and the risk of developing prostate cancer (32) or colorectal cancer (33). What happens to cancer risk after a person stops drinking alcohol? Most of the studies that have examined whether cancer risk declines after a person stops drinking alcohol have focused on head and neck cancers and on esophageal cancer. In general, these studies have found that stopping alcohol consumption is not associated with immediate reductions in cancer risk. The cancer risks eventually decline, although it may take years for the risks of cancer to return to those of never drinkers. For example, ex-drinkers still had higher risks of oral cavity and pharyngeal cancers than never drinkers even 16 years after they stopped drinking alcohol, although it was lower than before they stopped drinking (34). One study estimated that it would take more than 35 years for the higher risks of laryngeal and pharyngeal cancers associated with alcohol consumption to decrease to the level of never drinkers (35). Is it safe for someone to drink alcohol while undergoing cancer chemotherapy? As with most questions related to a specific individual’s cancer treatment, it is best for patients to check with their health care team about whether it is safe to drink alcohol during or immediately following chemotherapy treatment. The doctors and nurses administering the treatment will be able to give specific advice about whether it is safe to consume alcohol while undergoing specific cancer treatments.

Share sensitive information only on official, secure websites. Drinking alcohol raises your risk of getting several kinds of cancer: Some studies show that drinking three or more alcoholic drinks per day increases the risk of stomach and pancreatic cancers. Drinking alcohol may also increase prostate cancer risk. All alcoholic drinks—including red and white wine, beer, and liquor—are linked with cancer. Drinking less alcohol is better for your health than drinking more. The Dietary Guidelines for Americans recommends that adults of legal drinking age (21 years or older) choose not to drink alcohol or to drink alcohol in moderation (2 drinks or less in a day for men, 1 drink or less in a day for women). If you're taking prescription medicine, including cancer treatment, ask your doctor if it's safe to drink alcohol. When you drink alcohol, your body breaks it down into a chemical that damages your DNA. DNA is the cell's \"instruction manual\" that controls how a cell grows and does its job. When DNA is damaged, a cell can grow out of control and become cancer. For more information, see the National Cancer Institute's Alcohol and Cancer Risk web page. Each year, about 20,000 adults in the United States die from alcohol-related cancers. It is estimated most of these deaths may have been avoided if all adults had followed the recommended limits on alcohol use in the Dietary Guidelines for Americans instead of drinking above them.

Citation of the source is appreciated. Alcohol consumption has been linked to an increased risk for various types of cancer. A combined analysis of more than 200 studies assessing the link between alcohol and various types of cancer (i.e., a meta-analysis) sought to investigate this association in more detail. This meta-analysis found that alcohol most strongly increased the risks for cancers of the oral cavity, pharynx, esophagus, and larynx. Statistically significant increases in risk also existed for cancers of the stomach, colon, rectum, liver, female breast, and ovaries. Several mechanisms have been postulated through which alcohol may contribute to an increased risk of cancer. Concurrent tobacco use, which is common among drinkers, enhances alcohol’s effects on the risk for cancers of the upper digestive and respiratory tract. The analysis did not identify a threshold level of alcohol consumption below which no increased risk for cancer was evident. Keywords: AOD (alcohol or other drug) consumption; chronic AODE (effects of AOD use, abuse, and dependence); cancer; carcinogenesis; oral disorder; esophageal disorder; dose-response relationship; gender differences; tobacco in any form; distilled alcoholic beverage; drug concentration; risk analysis; meta-analysis Regular alcohol consumption can have numerous consequences, beneficial or detrimental, on the health of the drinker. For example, light-to-moderate alcohol consumption1 may protect against certain types of heart disease and stroke. Conversely, heavy drinking has been associated with liver disease; cardiovascular disease; disorders of the digestive tract; and illness or death from alcohol-related injuries, motor vehicle crashes, and violence. Another group of disorders that has been linked to drinking is cancer, particularly cancers of the upper airway and digestive tract (e.g., mouth, pharynx, larynx, and esophagus). Although alcohol has not been shown to cause cancer (i.e., be carcinogenic) in animal studies, strong epidemiological evidence indicates that consumption of alcoholic beverages increases the risk of those cancers. Alcohol consumption also is associated with primary liver cancer. This relationship is difficult to investigate in epidemiological studies, however, because it is more indirect. Thus, alcohol causes cirrhosis of the liver in a substantial proportion of heavy drinkers, which then can lead to liver cancer. In addition, heavy alcohol consumption can increase the drinker’s risk for infection with the hepatitis C virus (HCV), which in turn can also result in liver cancer (for more information on the relationship between alcohol consumption and HCV infection, see the article in this issue by Lieber, pp. 245–254). Alcohol consumption also has been linked to cancers of the large bowel (i.e., colon and rectum) in both men and women and to breast cancer in women, although these associations have not yet been proven unequivocally. Nevertheless, because these are the two most common types of cancer in developed countries after lung cancer, even a moderate increase in risk may result in a relatively large number of additional cases and therefore have important public health implications. The association between alcohol consumption and other types of cancer (e.g., stomach, pancreatic, prostate, and endometrial cancer) is still controversial (International Agency for Research on Cancer [IARC] 1988; Doll et al. 1999). The increased risk of cancer among heavy drinkers is primarily attributed to the alcohol (chemically referred to as ethanol) in alcoholic beverages. Thus, the risk tends to increase with the overall amount of ethanol consumed. It is still unclear, however, whether any defined consumption threshold exists below which no increased risk for cancer is evident (IARC 1988; Doll et al. 1999). To evaluate the overall effects of alcohol on the cancer risk of a population, one must accurately quantify its effects on various types of tumors. To this end, researchers have performed comprehensive meta-analyses of published studies investigating the relationship between alcohol intake and the risk for numerous types of cancer. Meta-analyses are studies that pool data from several studies, thereby substantially enhancing the overall number of cases evaluated. This approach allows researchers to detect relationships that may have been overlooked in the individual studies because of the relatively small sample size and insufficient statistical power of those individual studies. This article summarizes the major findings of one such meta-analysis (Corrao et al. 1999, 2000). To identify scientific articles to include in the meta-analysis, the researchers followed three steps: First, they conducted a search of several bibliographic databases (e.g., MEDLINE, Current Contents, EMBASE, CAB Abstracts, and Core Biomedical Collection) for studies published between 1966 and 2000. Second, the investigators reviewed all references in the resulting articles to identify any studies that had not been found in the database search. And third, to ensure that the list of studies included was as complete as possible, the investigators conducted a manual search of the most relevant journals of epidemiology and medicine and compared their search results with those of other general reviews and meta-analyses published on this topic. Each article identified by this search process was reviewed and included in the analysis if it met the following three criteria: The article was a case-control or a cohort study published as an original article. Case-control studies compare people with a certain disease (e.g., cancer)—the cases—with a similar group of people without the disease— the controls. Investigators then collect information (e.g., regarding alcohol consumption) for both groups to determine whether differences exist between the groups. For example, significant differences between the groups with respect to alcohol intake suggest that alcohol was a causative factor in the disease. Cohort studies follow a group of initially healthy people over a prolonged period of time. At the outset, the investigators determine the participants’ drinking patterns so that they can relate drinking patterns and disease development during the followup period. The findings of the study were expressed as relative risk (RR) or odds ratio (OR) and considered at least three levels of alcohol consumption. The RR determines the strength of the relationship between a variable (e.g., alcohol consumption) and the development of a disease. The RR for a disease among people without the variable (e.g., among abstainers) is defined as 1.0. A RR among people with the variable (e.g., among drinkers) of greater than 1.0 indicates that the variable increases the risk of the disease. Conversely, an RR of less than 1.0 indicates that the variable has a protective effect. (The OR is used to estimate the RR under certain conditions.) The article reported the number of cases and non-cases (i.e., controls in case-control studies and person-time exposed during the followup in a cohort study) and estimates of the RR or OR for each exposure level. Two readers, who received no information on the names and affiliations of the authors of each study or the alcohol-related results, independently determined the eligibility of each article for inclusion in the meta-analysis. When the results of a study were published in more than one article, only the most recent and complete article was included in the analysis. To estimate the effect of alcohol consumption on the risk for each type of cancer studied, based on the pooled data from all studies included in the meta-analysis, the investigators used meta-regression models—statistical models developed specifically for such analyses (Corrao et al. 1999, 2000). For a more detailed description of these statistical analyses, see the textbox, p. 265, and the articles by Corrao and colleagues (1999, 2000). To determine the effects of alcohol on the risk for various types of cancer, the researchers used three statistical methods. They first pooled the original published data for each type of cancer. Subsequently, they determined the relationship between alcohol consumption and the risk for a given type of cancer by fitting to the pooled data several statistical models called fractional models (Royston et al. 1999). Such models can identify trends (e.g., J- or U-shaped curves) as well as other relationships between alcohol exposure levels and relative risks. The investigators then chose the best-fitting model to summarize the relation of interest (Corrao et al. 1999). Next, they assessed whether gender modified the effect of alcohol on the risk for each neoplasm. They also looked at the effect of adjusting the reported estimates for smoking when examining tobacco-related types of cancer. Finally, the researchers evaluated the variability (i.e., heterogeneity) among the studies’ results according to methods proposed by Greenland and Longnecker (1992). In all, 229 studies (183 case-control studies and 46 cohort studies) met the eligibility criteria and were included in the meta-analysis. These studies, which reported a total of 115,199 cases, investigated alcohol’s effects on the risk for developing cancer at a total of 19 sites in the body or at all sites combined (see the table and figure for a summary of the studies and their findings for each of those sites). For five of the cancer sites (i.e., small intestine, gall bladder, skin [melanoma], cervix, and kidney), alcohol’s effects were analyzed in only one or two studies; in these cases, the researchers could not calculate the pooled RR or 95-percent confidence interval (95% CI).2 For all other cancer sites, both the pooled RR and the 95% CI were determined for three levels of alcohol consumption (i.e., 25, 50, and 100 grams of alcohol per day, corresponding to approximately 2, 4, and 8 standard drinks3 per day, respectively). For most of the tumor types included in the studies, the analysis found a dose-dependent increase in risk from alcohol consumption—that is, greater alcohol consumption was associated with a greater increase in risk. Alcohol most strongly increased the risks for cancers of the oral cavity and pharynx (RR=5.7 for the highest alcohol consumption level), esophagus (RR=4.2) and larynx (RR=3.2). Appreciably smaller, although still statistically significant at the 5-percent level,4 increases in risk existed for cancers of the stomach, colon, rectum, liver, female breast, and ovaries. The smallest increases in risk were observed for cancers of the lung (RR=1.1 at the highest consumption level) and prostate (RR=1.2). For all these types of cancer, significant increases in risk existed even at the lowest consumption level studied here (i.e., 25 grams of alcohol, or two standard drinks per day). In contrast, no significant relationship existed between alcohol consumption and the risk for pancreas, endometrial, and bladder cancers. With the exceptions of cancers of the ovary, prostate, and bladder, significant heterogeneity across studies existed for each type of cancer; this means that results vary greatly among the various studies analyzed, so an overall summary of average effect across studies must be taken with caution. The researchers also investigated whether gender modified the effect of alcohol intake on the risk for each type of cancer. Statistically significant gender differences existed only for esophageal and liver cancer—where the alcohol-related risk was higher in women than in men—but not for other types of cancer. The results of eight appropriate studies were pooled to determine the relationship between alcohol consumption and the risk of cancer at all sites combined. This analysis found that alcohol consumption of at least 50 grams (i.e., 4 standard drinks) per day significantly increased the risk of developing any type of cancer. As with other meta-analyses of published studies, the analysis presented here has various limitations and strengths. One limitation is that for most types of cancer included, the estimates of alcohol’s effects tended to vary widely among the individual studies, making interpretation of the pooled data more difficult. Part of this variability may result from differences in the characteristics of the subjects included in the studies. For example, the gender of the study participants may play a role because potential differences in alcohol breakdown (i.e., metabolism) exist between men and women and may systematically influence the overall pooled estimates (Corrao et al. 1999, 2000). To control for this possibility, the investigators included separate analyses for men and women in their statistical models, where feasible. However, gender explained a significant portion of the observed variability in study results only for esophageal and liver cancer, but not for other types of cancers. Another limitation of this and other meta-analyses is that alcohol consumption levels may have been systematically underreported in several studies, leading to biased RR estimates. The statistical power of this meta-analysis also is somewhat limited because, although it included more than 115,000 cases, the numbers of cases for certain types of cancers (e.g., cervix and melanoma) were relatively small. Similarly, for certain cancers, there were only a few cases with certain levels of alcohol consumption (e.g., high levels of alcohol consumption in female breast cancer patients). Furthermore, biases resulting from confounding factors may have affected the pooled estimates. A confounding factor is a variable that is related to both the exposure variable (e.g., alcohol consumption) and the risk of disease (e.g., cancer). For example, alcohol intake may appear to be positively associated with lung cancer but the actual association may be confounded by cigarette smoking, which is related with both alcohol intake (because people who smoke also tend to drink) and the risk of lung cancer. Summary of the Studies Included in the Meta-Analysis NOTE: Table gives the pooled relative risks (RR) and corresponding 95-percent confidence intervals (95% CI) for three alcohol consumption levels. Those levels specified corresponded to approximately two, four, and eight standard drinks per day, respectively. The effects of gender and differences (i.e., heterogeneity) in the study results for various cancer sites also are presented. The RR indicates the strength of the relationship between alcohol consumption and a given type of cancer. A RR greater than 1.0 means that alcohol consumption at the level indicated increased the risk for that type of cancer. The greater the value over 1.0, the greater the risk. The 95-percent confidence intervals indicate the range of RR that is 95 percent likely to show a true RR. A statistically significant heterogeneity level indicates that results varied greatly among the various studies analyzed and that, therefore, an overall summary of average effect across studies must be interpreted with caution. The number of individual studies does not add up to the total shown because several studies examined more than one type of cancer. For this type of cancer, the RRs associated with alcohol consumption for males and females are listed separately because a statistically significant difference existed between the two sexes. n.s. = not significant One of the strengths of this meta-analysis is that the investigators performed a separate analysis of studies that also reported estimates adjusted for tobacco use, which contributes to various forms of cancer, prominently lung cancer. Such analyses were conducted for most cancers of the upper airways and digestive tract, as well as for lung and bladder cancer. These analyses found that tobacco use had a substantial modifying effect not only on the alcohol-related risks for lung and bladder cancer but also on the risk for laryngeal cancer. For example, when the investigators considered only studies reporting RRs not adjusted for tobacco use, the pooled RR for lung cancer at the highest level of alcohol consumption was 6.30. When they excluded such studies from the analysis and considered only studies reporting estimates adjusted for tobacco use, however, the pooled RR declined to 1.07. This finding indicates that alcohol itself only weakly increases the risk for lung cancer and that lung cancer risk primarily results from tobacco use, which is common in heavy drinkers. For laryngeal cancer, tobacco use also substantially influences the risk, though a strong association with alcohol consumption, indicated by a RR of 3.24, remained even when considering only studies presenting adjusted estimates. The association between various levels of alcohol consumption and an increased risk of liver cancer remains difficult to interpret even with the pooled data used in this meta-analysis. This difficulty results from the fact that, as discussed earlier, the association between alcohol consumption and liver cancer is only indirect. Furthermore, patients with liver cancer resulting from cirrhosis typically have reduced their alcohol consumption by the time they develop liver cancer (Aricò et al. 1994). This change in consumption levels may lead to an underestimate of the real association. Researchers have known about the relationship between heavy alcohol consumption and the risk for esophageal and other upper digestive and respiratory tract cancers since the beginning of the last century. Furthermore, substantial epidemiological evidence (as reviewed in this article) accrued over the past 50 years has shown that alcohol contributes to the development of these cancers. Nevertheless, the mechanisms underlying alcohol-related cancer development remain largely unclear. To date, no experimental evidence indicates that alcohol by itself can cause cancer—that is, that alcohol can act as a complete carcinogen. Over the past few decades, however, several animal studies have indicated that alcohol can have a cocarcinogenic, or cancer-promoting, effect. This means that when alcohol is administered together with other known cancer-inducing agents (i.e., carcinogens), it promotes or accelerates cancer development. This effect was noted for several digestive tract cancers, specifically cancers of the esophagus and the nonglandular forestomach5 (Doll et al. 1999). For other cancers of the digestive tract (e.g., stomach, pancreas, colon, and rectum), however, the results are less clear and generally are variable across studies, possibly because of differences in study design. Researchers also have no clear understanding of the potential mechanisms through which alcohol might act as a cocarcinogen at these sites (IARC 1988; Doll et al. 1999). Moreover, the RR estimates based on the pooled data in this meta-analysis ranged from 1.1 to 1.3 for the highest level of alcohol intake. These values indicate only a weak association of alcohol with these types of cancer, which may possibly result from residual bias in the analysis or from confounding factors, such as diet. Therefore, one cannot draw any conclusions regarding a potential causal role of alcohol in the development of these cancers. For female breast cancer, the meta-analysis described here confirms the existence of a strong dose-risk relationship between alcohol consumption level and breast cancer risk. The exact role of alcohol in the development of breast cancer remains unclear. It is possible, however, that for breast cancer and other types of cancer related to disturbances in female hormone levels, alcohol may act by altering the metabolism and blood levels of female hormones, such as estrogen (Longnecker 1994). Moreover, a recent study suggests that the association may be limited to women with a family history of breast cancer (Vachon et al. 2001). Alcohol and tobacco enhance each other’s effects (i.e., act synergistically) on the risk for cancers of the upper digestive and respiratory tract.6 Studies conducted in North America, France, and Italy have shown extremely high RRs for certain cancers among people who both drink and smoke heavily (Doll et al. 1999). For example, in a series of case-control studies conducted in Italy, the RRs for the highest exposure levels to both risk factors were 80 for cancers of the oral cavity and pharynx, 12 for laryngeal cancer, and 18 for esophageal cancer (Franceschi et al. 1990). From a public health view, this synergism implies that over 75 percent of cancers of the upper digestive and respiratory tract in developed countries are attributable to alcohol and tobacco. Accordingly, the cessation or moderation of tobacco and/or alcohol use could avoid the majority of these cancer cases. Relationship between increasing amounts of alcohol and risk (i.e., relative risk or RR) for 14 types of cancer. The RR describes the strength of the relationship between a variable (e.g., alcohol consumption) and a disease (e.g., cancer). The RR for the disease in people without the variable (e.g., abstainers) is defined as 1.0. A RR among the people with the variable (e.g., drinkers) of greater than 1.0 indicates that the variable increases the risk for the disease. The greater the value, the greater the risk. The curves shown here were obtained by fitting certain statistical models to the data from several studies (i.e., a meta-analysis). Blue dotted lines indicate 95-percent confidence intervals; that is, the range of RR that is 95 percent likely to show a true RR. The synergism between alcohol and tobacco also implies that cancers of the upper digestive and respiratory tract in Europe and North America are extremely rare among people who have never smoked, and only limited data are available on the effects of alcohol in those “never-smokers.” Those limited data indicate that for oral and pharyngeal cancers (Fioretti et al. 1999; Talamini et al. 1998) as well as for esophageal cancer (Doll et al. 1999), high alcohol consumption in people who have never smoked is directly associated with an increased risk for these types of cancer. (For laryngeal cancer, the evidence in this respect is inconsistent.) The substances contained in tobacco products are not the only carcinogenic agents to which the upper digestive tract is exposed, however, and alcohol may facilitate or promote the effects of other carcinogens present in the diet or other environmental exposures. Researchers have made several attempts to determine whether different types of alcoholic beverages have different effects on cancer risk. Some studies found no apparent differences in the cancer risks associated with various beverages, whereas others have reported greater risks with spirits than with wine or beer (Doll et al. 1999). Researchers conducting a study in Normandy, France (Tuyns et al. 1979), reported an increased risk of esophageal cancer associated with apple-based drinks (e.g., apple brandy and hard cider). Two studies from Italy (Barra et al. 1990; Bosetti et al. 2000) found that people who consumed only wine had greater risks of oral, pharyngeal, and esophageal cancer compared with people who consumed wine as well as distilled spirits or beer after adjusting for the overall amount of alcohol consumed. Conversely, a Danish study found no excess risk for cancer of the upper digestive tract associated with wine consumption (Gronbaek et al. 1998). Taken together, these findings appear to indicate that the most frequently consumed beverage in each region or country tends to be the beverage associated with the highest estimated RR. However, this topic requires further study. Some researchers have suggested that drinks containing higher alcohol concentrations are more deleterious per gram of alcohol than drinks with lower alcohol concentrations. The evidence for this hypothesis, however, is weak and inconclusive (Doll et al. 1999). This meta-analysis includes most published information on alcohol and cancer and, the limitations discussed above notwithstanding, consequently provides the most accurate estimates of the RRs for common cancers considered to be alcohol-related. Some of the findings are novel and of specific relevance. For example, the analysis was unable to identify a threshold level of alcohol consumption below which no increased risk for cancer is evident. Furthermore, this meta-analysis found that the association of alcohol with the risk for oral and pharyngeal cancer appears to be stronger than the association with esophageal or laryngeal cancer across increasing levels of alcohol intake. In terms of risk assessment, this meta-analysis confirms that high levels of alcohol consumption (i.e., more than four drinks per day) result in a substantial risk of cancer development at several sites. Lower levels of consumption result in a moderately increased risk for various cancers. At the same time, other studies have shown that moderate alcohol consumption can have protective effects against certain types of heart disease. Accordingly, one must determine whether moderate alcohol consumption results in an overall favorable or unfavorable risk-benefit balance for the individual drinker or an entire population. This balance depends on the age, gender, and baseline disease rates among the members of a given population. In addition, genetic factors also may influence a person’s risk-benefit balance as suggested by the previously mentioned findings that the association between alcohol consumption and female breast cancer may be limited to women with a family history of breast cancer (i.e., with predisposing genetic factors) (Vachon et al. 2001). Consequently, any definite risk-benefit assessment for moderate alcohol drinking requires much more far-reaching analyses that are beyond the scope of this article but that in the future may provide important information from a public health perspective. Ms. Ivana Garimoldi provided editorial assistance in the preparation of this article. The definitions of light, moderate, and heavy alcohol consumption vary across studies. In the United States, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services and the U.S. Department of Agriculture have defined moderate drinking as no more than one drink per day for women and no more than two drinks per day for men. Statistical analyses generally do not lead to a calculated, accurate result but instead provide an estimate of the result. The 95% CI is the range of the value under investigation that with a 95-percent likelihood contains the true value. In the United States, a standard drink frequently is defined as 0.5 ounces (oz) or 14 grams of pure alcohol. This alcohol amount is found in 12 fluid oz of beer, 5 fluid oz of wine, and 1.5 fluid oz of 80-proof distilled spirits. Statistically significant means that the observed result would occur by chance under hypothesized conditions less than a specified proportion of the time (usually 5 percent). These studies were conducted in hamsters. The stomach of a hamster is divided into a portion that does not contain glands which secrete digestive enzymes (i.e., nonglandular forestomach) and a portion closer to the intestine that does contain such glands. Similarly, synergistic effects have been reported between high alcohol consumption and dietary factors, such as low consumption of fruits and vegetables. Support for this study came from the Italian Ministry of Health, from the Italian Ministry of the University and Scientific and Technologic Research, and from the Associazione Italiana per la Ricerca sul Cancro.

                "content": "China,[h] officially the People's Republic of China (PRC),[i] is a country in East Asia. With a population exceeding 1.4 billion, it is the second-most populous country after India, representing 17.4% of the world population. China spans the equivalent of five time zones and borders fourteen countries by land.[j] With an area of nearly 9.6 million square kilometers (3,700,000 sq mi), it is the third-largest country by total land area.[k] The country is divided into 33 province-level divisions: 22 provinces,[l] five autonomous regions, four municipalities, and two semi-autonomous special administrative regions. Beijing is the country's capital, while Shanghai is its most populous city by urban area and largest financial center. China is considered one of the cradles of civilization: the first human inhabitants in the region arrived during the Paleolithic. By the late 2nd millennium BCE, the earliest dynastic states had emerged in the Yellow River basin. The 8th–3rd centuries BCE saw a breakdown in the authority of the Zhou dynasty, accompanied by the emergence of administrative and military techniques, literature, philosophy, and historiography. In 221 BCE, China was unified under an emperor, ushering in more than two millennia of imperial dynasties including the Qin, Han, Tang, Yuan, Ming, and Qing. With the invention of gunpowder and paper, the establishment of the Silk Road, and the building of the Great Wall, Chinese culture flourished and has heavily influenced both its neighbors and lands further afield. However, China began to cede parts of the country in the late 19th century to various European powers by a series of unequal treaties. After decades of Qing China on the decline, the 1911 Revolution overthrew the Qing dynasty and the monarchy and the Republic of China (ROC) was established the following year. The country under the nascent Beiyang government was unstable and ultimately fragmented during the Warlord Era, which was ended upon the Northern Expedition conducted by the Kuomintang (KMT) to reunify the country. The Chinese Civil War began in 1927, when KMT forces purged members of the rival Chinese Communist Party (CCP), who proceeded to engage in sporadic fighting against the KMT-led Nationalist government. Following the country's invasion by the Empire of Japan in 1937, the CCP and KMT formed the Second United Front to fight the Japanese. The Second Sino-Japanese War eventually ended in a Chinese victory; however, the CCP and the KMT resumed their civil war as soon as the war ended. In 1949, the resurgent Communists established control over most of the country, proclaiming the People's Republic of China and forcing the Nationalist government to retreat to the island of Taiwan. The country was split, with both sides claiming to be the sole legitimate government of China. Following the implementation of land reforms, further attempts by the PRC to realize communism failed: the Great Leap Forward was largely responsible for the Great Chinese Famine that ended with millions of Chinese people having died, and the subsequent Cultural Revolution was a period of social turmoil and persecution characterized by Maoist populism. Following the Sino-Soviet split, the Shanghai Communiqué in 1972 would precipitate the normalization of relations with the United States. Economic reforms that began in 1978 moved the country away from a socialist planned economy towards an increasingly capitalist market economy, spurring significant economic growth. The corresponding movement for increased democracy and liberalization stalled after the Tiananmen Square protests and massacre in 1989. China is a unitary one-party socialist republic led by the CCP. It is one of the five permanent members of the UN Security Council; the UN representative for China was changed from the ROC to the PRC in 1971. It is a founding member of several multilateral and regional organizations such as the AIIB, the Silk Road Fund, the New Development Bank, and the RCEP. It is a member of the BRICS, the G20, APEC, the SCO, and the East Asia Summit. Making up around one-fifth of the world economy, the Chinese economy is the world's largest economy by PPP-adjusted GDP, the second-largest economy by nominal GDP, and the second-wealthiest country, albeit ranking poorly in measures of democracy, human rights and religious freedom. The country has been one of the fastest-growing major economies and is the world's largest manufacturer and exporter, as well as the second-largest importer. China is a nuclear-weapon state with the world's largest standing army by military personnel and the second-largest defense budget. It is a great power, and has been described as an emerging superpower. China is known for its cuisine and culture, and has 59 UNESCO World Heritage Sites, the second-highest number of any country. The word \"China\" has been used in English since the 16th century; however, it was not used by the Chinese themselves during this period. Its origin has been traced through Portuguese, Malay, and Persian back to the Sanskrit word Cīna, used in ancient India.[16] \"China\" appears in Richard Eden's 1555 translation[m] of the 1516 journal of the Portuguese explorer Duarte Barbosa.[n][16] Barbosa's usage was derived from Persian Chīn (چین), which in turn derived from Sanskrit Cīna (चीन).[21] Cīna was first used in early Hindu scripture, including the Mahabharata (5th century BCE) and the Laws of Manu (2nd century BCE).[22] In 1655, Martino Martini suggested that the word China is derived ultimately from the name of the Qin dynasty (221–206 BCE).[23][22] Although use in Indian sources precedes this dynasty, this derivation is still given in various sources.[24] The origin of the Sanskrit word is a matter of debate.[16] Alternative suggestions include the names for Yelang and the Jing or Chu state.[22][25] The official name of the modern state is the \"People's Republic of China\" (simplified Chinese: 中华人民共和国; traditional Chinese: 中華人民共和國; pinyin: Zhōnghuá rénmín gònghéguó). The shorter form is \"China\" (中国; 中國; Zhōngguó), from zhōng ('central') and guó ('state'), a term which developed under the Western Zhou dynasty in reference to its royal demesne.[o][p] It was used in official documents as an synonym for the state under the Qing.[28] The name Zhongguo is also translated as 'Middle Kingdom' in English.[29] China is sometimes referred to as \"mainland China\" or \"the Mainland\" when distinguishing it from the Republic of China or the PRC's Special Administrative Regions.[30][31][32][33] Archaeological evidence suggests that early hominids inhabited China 2.25 million years ago.[34] The hominid fossils of Peking Man, a Homo erectus who used fire,[35] have been dated to between 680,000 and 780,000 years ago.[36] The fossilized teeth of Homo sapiens (dated to 125,000–80,000 years ago) have been discovered in Fuyan Cave.[37] Chinese proto-writing existed in Jiahu around 6600 BCE,[38] at Damaidi around 6000 BCE,[39] Dadiwan from 5800 to 5400 BCE, and Banpo dating from the 5th millennium BCE. Some scholars have suggested that the Jiahu symbols (7th millennium BCE) constituted the earliest Chinese writing system.[38] According to traditional Chinese historiography, the Xia dynasty was established during the late 3rd millennium BCE, marking the beginning of the dynastic cycle that was understood to underpin China's entire political history. In the modern era, the Xia's historicity came under increasing scrutiny, in part due to the earliest known attestation of the Xia being written millennia after the date given for their collapse. In 1958, archaeologists discovered sites belonging to the Erlitou culture that existed during the early Bronze Age; they have since been characterized as the remains of the historical Xia, but this conception is often rejected.[40][41][42] The Shang dynasty that traditionally succeeded the Xia is the earliest for which there are both contemporary written records and undisputed archaeological evidence.[43] The Shang ruled much of the Yellow River valley until the 11th century BCE, with the earliest hard evidence dated c. 1300 BCE.[44] The oracle bone script, attested from c. 1250 BCE but generally assumed to be considerably older,[45][46] represents the oldest known form of written Chinese,[47] and is the direct ancestor of modern Chinese characters.[48] The Shang were overthrown by the Zhou, who ruled between the 11th and 5th centuries BCE, though the centralized authority of Son of Heaven was slowly eroded by fengjian lords. Some principalities eventually emerged from the weakened Zhou and continually waged war with each other during the 300-year Spring and Autumn period. By the time of the Warring States period of the 5th–3rd centuries BCE, there were seven major powerful states left.[49] The Warring States period ended in 221 BCE after the state of Qin conquered the other six states, reunited China and established the dominant order of autocracy. King Zheng of Qin proclaimed himself the Emperor of the Qin dynasty, becoming the first emperor of a unified China. He enacted Qin's legalist reforms, notably the standardization of Chinese characters, measurements, road widths, and currency. His dynasty also conquered the Yue tribes in Guangxi, Guangdong, and Northern Vietnam.[50] The Qin dynasty lasted only fifteen years, falling soon after the First Emperor's death.[51][52] Following widespread revolts during which the imperial library was burned,[q] the Han dynasty emerged to rule China between 206 BCE and 220 CE, creating a cultural identity among its populace still remembered in the ethnonym of the modern Han Chinese.[51][52] The Han expanded the empire's territory considerably, with military campaigns reaching Central Asia, Mongolia, Korea, and Yunnan, and the recovery of Guangdong and northern Vietnam from Nanyue. Han involvement in Central Asia and Sogdia helped establish the land route of the Silk Road, replacing the earlier path over the Himalayas to India. Han China gradually became the largest economy of the ancient world.[54] Despite the Han's initial decentralization and the official abandonment of the Qin philosophy of Legalism in favor of Confucianism, Qin's legalist institutions and policies continued to be employed by the Han government and its successors.[55] After the end of the Han dynasty, a period of strife known as Three Kingdoms followed, at the end of which Wei was swiftly overthrown by the Jin dynasty. The Jin fell to civil war upon the ascension of a developmentally disabled emperor; the Five Barbarians then rebelled and ruled northern China as the Sixteen States. The Xianbei unified them as the Northern Wei, whose Emperor Xiaowen reversed his predecessors' apartheid policies and enforced a drastic sinification on his subjects. In the south, the general Liu Yu secured the abdication of the Jin in favor of the Liu Song. The various successors of these states became known as the Northern and Southern dynasties, with the two areas finally reunited by the Sui in 581.[citation needed] The Sui restored the Han to power through China, reformed its agriculture, economy and imperial examination system, constructed the Grand Canal, and patronized Buddhism. However, they fell quickly when their conscription for public works and a failed war in northern Korea provoked widespread unrest.[56][57] Under the succeeding Tang and Song dynasties, Chinese economy, technology, and culture entered a golden age.[58] The Tang dynasty retained control of the Western Regions and the Silk Road,[59] which brought traders to as far as Mesopotamia and the Horn of Africa,[60] and made the capital Chang'an a cosmopolitan urban center. However, it was devastated and weakened by the An Lushan rebellion in the 8th century.[61] In 907, the Tang disintegrated completely when the local military governors became ungovernable. The Song dynasty ended the separatist situation in 960, leading to a balance of power between the Song and the Liao dynasty. The Song was the first government in world history to issue paper money and the first Chinese polity to establish a permanent navy which was supported by the developed shipbuilding industry along with the sea trade.[62] Between the 10th and 11th century CE, the population of China doubled to around 100 million people, mostly because of the expansion of rice cultivation in central and southern China, and the production of abundant food surpluses. The Song dynasty also saw a revival of Confucianism, in response to the growth of Buddhism during the Tang,[63] and a flourishing of philosophy and the arts, as landscape art and porcelain were brought to new levels of complexity.[64] However, the military weakness of the Song army was observed by the Jin dynasty. In 1127, Emperor Emeritus Huizong, Emperor Qinzong of Song and the capital Bianjing were captured during the Jin–Song wars. The remnants of the Song retreated to southern China and reestablished the Song at Jiankang.[65] The Mongol conquest of China began in 1205 with the campaigns against Western Xia by Genghis Khan,[66] who also invaded Jin territories.[67] In 1271, the Mongol leader Kublai Khan established the Yuan dynasty, which conquered the last remnant of the Song dynasty in 1279. Before the Mongol invasion, the population of Song China was 120 million citizens; this was reduced to 60 million by the time of the census in 1300.[68] A peasant named Zhu Yuanzhang overthrew the Yuan in 1368 and founded the Ming dynasty as the Hongwu Emperor. Under the Ming dynasty, China enjoyed another golden age, developing one of the strongest navies in the world and a rich and prosperous economy amid a flourishing of art and culture. It was during this period that admiral Zheng He led the Ming treasure voyages throughout the Indian Ocean, reaching as far as East Africa.[69] In the early Ming dynasty, China's capital was moved from Nanjing to Beijing. With the budding of capitalism, philosophers such as Wang Yangming critiqued and expanded Neo-Confucianism with concepts of individualism and equality of four occupations.[70] The scholar-official stratum became a supporting force of industry and commerce in the tax boycott movements, which, together with the famines and defense against Japanese invasions of Korea (1592–1598) and Later Jin incursions led to an exhausted treasury.[71] In 1644, Beijing was captured by a coalition of peasant rebel forces led by Li Zicheng. The Chongzhen Emperor committed suicide when the city fell. The Manchu Qing dynasty, then allied with Ming dynasty general Wu Sangui, overthrew Li's short-lived Shun dynasty and subsequently seized control of Beijing, which became the new capital of the Qing dynasty.[72] The Qing dynasty, which lasted from 1644 until 1912, was the last imperial dynasty of China. The Ming-Qing transition (1618–1683) cost 25 million lives, but the Qing appeared to have restored China's imperial power and inaugurated another flowering of the arts.[73] After the Southern Ming ended, the further conquest of the Dzungar Khanate added Mongolia, Tibet and Xinjiang to the empire.[74] Meanwhile, China's population growth resumed and shortly began to accelerate. It is commonly agreed that pre-modern China's population experienced two growth spurts, one during the Northern Song period (960–1127), and other during the Qing period (around 1700–1830).[75] By the High Qing era China was possibly the most commercialized country in the world, and imperial China experienced a second commercial revolution by the end of the 18th century.[76] On the other hand, the centralized autocracy was strengthened in part to suppress anti-Qing sentiment with the policy of valuing agriculture and restraining commerce, like the Haijin during the early Qing period and ideological control as represented by the literary inquisition, causing some social and technological stagnation.[77][78] In the mid-19th century, the Opium Wars with Britain and France forced China to pay compensation, open treaty ports, allow extraterritoriality for foreign nationals, and cede Hong Kong to the British[79] under the 1842 Treaty of Nanking, the first of what have been termed as the \"unequal treaties\". The First Sino-Japanese War (1894–1895) resulted in Qing China's loss of influence in the Korean Peninsula, as well as the cession of Taiwan to Japan.[80] The Qing dynasty also began experiencing internal unrest in which tens of millions of people died, especially in the White Lotus Rebellion, the failed Taiping Rebellion that ravaged southern China in the 1850s and 1860s and the Dungan Revolt (1862–1877) in the northwest. The initial success of the Self-Strengthening Movement of the 1860s was frustrated by a series of military defeats in the 1880s and 1890s.[81] In the 19th century, the great Chinese diaspora began. Losses due to emigration were added to by conflicts and catastrophes such as the Northern Chinese Famine of 1876–1879, in which between 9 and 13 million people died.[82] The Guangxu Emperor drafted a reform plan in 1898 to establish a modern constitutional monarchy, but these plans were thwarted by the Empress Dowager Cixi. The ill-fated anti-foreign Boxer Rebellion of 1899–1901 further weakened the dynasty. Although Cixi sponsored a program of reforms known as the late Qing reforms, the Xinhai Revolution of 1911–1912 ended the Qing dynasty and established the Republic of China.[83] Puyi, the last Emperor, abdicated in 1912.[84] On 1 January 1912, the Republic of China was established, and Sun Yat-sen of the Kuomintang (KMT) was proclaimed provisional president.[85] In March 1912, the presidency was given to Yuan Shikai, a former Qing general who in 1915 proclaimed himself Emperor of China. In the face of popular condemnation and opposition from his own Beiyang Army, he was forced to abdicate and re-establish the republic in 1916.[86] After Yuan Shikai's death in 1916, China was politically fragmented. Its Beijing-based government was internationally recognized but virtually powerless; regional warlords controlled most of its territory.[87][88] During this period, China participated in World War I and saw a far-reaching popular uprising (the May Fourth Movement).[89] In the late 1920s, the Kuomintang under Chiang Kai-shek was able to reunify the country under its own control with a series of deft military and political maneuverings known collectively as the Northern Expedition.[90][91] The Kuomintang moved the nation's capital to Nanjing and implemented \"political tutelage\", an intermediate stage of political development outlined in Sun Yat-sen's Three Principles of the People program for transforming China into a modern democratic state.[92][93] The Kuomintang briefly allied with the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) during the Northern Expedition, though the alliance broke down in 1927 after Chiang violently suppressed the CCP and other leftists in Shanghai, marking the beginning of the Chinese Civil War.[94] The CCP declared areas of the country as the Chinese Soviet Republic (Jiangxi Soviet) in November 1931 in Ruijin, Jiangxi. The Jiangxi Soviet was wiped out by the KMT armies in 1934, leading the CCP to initiate the Long March and relocate to Yan'an in Shaanxi. It would be the base of the communists before major combat in the Chinese Civil War ended in 1949. In 1931, Japan invaded and occupied Manchuria. Japan invaded other parts of China in 1937, precipitating the Second Sino-Japanese War (1937–1945), a theater of World War II. The war forced an uneasy alliance between the Kuomintang and the CCP. Japanese forces committed numerous war atrocities against the civilian population; as many as 20 million Chinese civilians died.[95] An estimated 40,000 to 300,000 Chinese were massacred in Nanjing alone during the Japanese occupation.[96] China, along with the UK, the United States, and the Soviet Union, were recognized as the Allied \"Big Four\" in the Declaration by United Nations.[97][98] Along with the other three great powers, China was one of the four major Allies of World War II, and was later considered one of the primary victors in the war.[99][100] After the surrender of Japan in 1945, Taiwan, including the Penghu, was handed over to Chinese control; however, the validity of this handover is controversial.[101] China emerged victorious but war-ravaged and financially drained. The continued distrust between the Kuomintang and the Communists led to the resumption of civil war. Constitutional rule was established in 1947, but because of the ongoing unrest, many provisions of the ROC constitution were never implemented in mainland China.[101] Afterwards, the CCP took control of most of mainland China, and the ROC government retreated offshore to Taiwan. On 1 October 1949, CCP Chairman Mao Zedong formally proclaimed the People's Republic of China in Tiananmen Square, Beijing.[103] In 1950, the PRC captured Hainan from the ROC[104] and annexed Tibet.[105] However, remaining Kuomintang forces continued to wage an insurgency in western China throughout the 1950s.[106] The CCP consolidated its popularity among the peasants through the Land Reform Movement, which included the state-tolerated executions of between 1 and 2 million landlords by peasants and former tenants.[107] Though the PRC initially allied closely with the Soviet Union, the relations between the two communist nations gradually deteriorated, leading China to develop an independent industrial system and its own nuclear weapons.[108] The Chinese population increased from 550 million in 1950 to 900 million in 1974.[109] However, the Great Leap Forward, an idealistic massive industrialization project, resulted in an estimated 15 to 55 million deaths between 1959 and 1961, mostly from starvation.[110][111] In 1964, China detonated its first atomic bomb.[112] In 1966, Mao and his allies launched the Cultural Revolution, sparking a decade of political recrimination and social upheaval that lasted until Mao's death in 1976. In October 1971, the PRC replaced the ROC in the United Nations, and took its seat as a permanent member of the Security Council.[113] After Mao's death, the Gang of Four was arrested by Hua Guofeng and held responsible for the Cultural Revolution. The Cultural Revolution was rebuked, with millions rehabilitated. Deng Xiaoping took power in 1978, and instituted large-scale political and economic reforms, together with the \"Eight Elders\", most senior and influential members of the party. The government loosened its control and the communes were gradually disbanded.[114] Agricultural collectivization was dismantled and farmlands privatized. While foreign trade became a major focus, special economic zones (SEZs) were created. Inefficient state-owned enterprises (SOEs) were restructured and some closed. This marked China's transition away from planned economy.[115] China adopted its current constitution on 4 December 1982.[116] In 1989, there were protests such those in Tiananmen Square, and then throughout the entire nation.[117] Zhao Ziyang was put under house arrest for his sympathies to the protests and was replaced by Jiang Zemin. Jiang continued economic reforms, closing many SOEs and trimming down \"iron rice bowl\" (life-tenure positions).[118][119][120] China's economy grew sevenfold during this time.[118] British Hong Kong and Portuguese Macau returned to China in 1997 and 1999, respectively, as special administrative regions under the principle of one country, two systems. The country joined the World Trade Organization in 2001.[118] At the 16th CCP National Congress in 2002, Hu Jintao succeeded Jiang as the general secretary.[118] Under Hu, China maintained its high rate of economic growth, overtaking the United Kingdom, France, Germany and Japan to become the world's second-largest economy.[121] However, the growth also severely impacted the country's resources and environment,[122][123] and caused major social displacement.[124][125] Xi Jinping succeeded Hu as paramount leader at the 18th CCP National Congress in 2012. Shortly after his ascension to power, Xi launched a vast anti-corruption crackdown,[126] that prosecuted more than 2 million officials by 2022.[127] During his tenure, Xi has consolidated power unseen since the initiation of economic and political reforms.[128] China's landscape is vast and diverse, ranging from the Gobi and Taklamakan Deserts in the arid north to the subtropical forests in the wetter south. The Himalaya, Karakoram, Pamir and Tian Shan mountain ranges separate China from much of South and Central Asia. The Yangtze and Yellow Rivers, the third- and sixth-longest in the world, respectively, run from the Tibetan Plateau to the densely populated eastern seaboard. China's coastline along the Pacific Ocean is 14,500 km (9,000 mi) long and is bounded by the Bohai, Yellow, East China and South China seas. China connects through the Kazakh border to the Eurasian Steppe. The territory of China lies between latitudes 18° and 54° N, and longitudes 73° and 135° E. The geographical center of China is marked by the Center of the Country Monument at 35°50′40.9″N 103°27′7.5″E﻿ / ﻿35.844694°N 103.452083°E﻿ / 35.844694; 103.452083﻿ (Geographical center of China). China's landscapes vary significantly across its vast territory. In the east, along the shores of the Yellow Sea and the East China Sea, there are extensive and densely populated alluvial plains, while on the edges of the Inner Mongolian plateau in the north, broad grasslands predominate. Southern China is dominated by hills and low mountain ranges, while the central-east hosts the deltas of China's two major rivers, the Yellow River and the Yangtze River. Other major rivers include the Xi, Mekong, Brahmaputra and Amur. To the west sit major mountain ranges, most notably the Himalayas. High plateaus feature among the more arid landscapes of the north, such as the Taklamakan and the Gobi Desert. The world's highest point, Mount Everest (8,848 m), lies on the Sino-Nepalese border.[129] The country's lowest point, and the world's third-lowest, is the dried lake bed of Ayding Lake (−154 m) in the Turpan Depression.[130] China's climate is mainly dominated by dry seasons and wet monsoons, which lead to pronounced temperature differences between winter and summer. In the winter, northern winds coming from high-latitude areas are cold and dry; in summer, southern winds from coastal areas at lower latitudes are warm and moist.[132] A major environmental issue in China is the continued expansion of its deserts, particularly the Gobi Desert.[133][134] Although barrier tree lines planted since the 1970s have reduced the frequency of sandstorms, prolonged drought and poor agricultural practices have resulted in dust storms plaguing northern China each spring, which then spread to other parts of East Asia, including Japan and Korea. Water quality, erosion, and pollution control have become important issues in China's relations with other countries. Melting glaciers in the Himalayas could potentially lead to water shortages for hundreds of millions of people.[135] According to academics, in order to limit climate change in China to 1.5 °C (2.7 °F) electricity generation from coal in China without carbon capture must be phased out by 2045.[136] With current policies, the GHG emissions of China will probably peak in 2025, and by 2030 they will return to 2022 levels. However, such pathway still leads to three-degree temperature rise.[137] Official government statistics about Chinese agricultural productivity are considered unreliable, due to exaggeration of production at subsidiary government levels.[138][139] Much of China has a climate very suitable for agriculture and the country has been the world's largest producer of rice, wheat, tomatoes, eggplant, grapes, watermelon, spinach, and many other crops.[140] In 2021, 12 percent of global permanent meadows and pastures belonged to China, as well as 8% of global cropland.[141] China is one of 17 megadiverse countries,[142] lying in two of the world's major biogeographic realms: the Palearctic and the Indomalayan. By one measure, China has over 34,687 species of animals and vascular plants, making it the third-most biodiverse country in the world, after Brazil and Colombia.[143] The country is a party to the Convention on Biological Diversity;[144] its National Biodiversity Strategy and Action Plan was received by the convention in 2010.[145] China is home to at least 551 species of mammals (the third-highest in the world),[146] 1,221 species of birds (eighth),[147] 424 species of reptiles (seventh)[148] and 333 species of amphibians (seventh).[149] Wildlife in China shares habitat with, and bears acute pressure from, one of the world's largest population of humans. At least 840 animal species are threatened, vulnerable or in danger of local extinction, due mainly to human activity such as habitat destruction, pollution and poaching for food, fur and traditional Chinese medicine.[150] Endangered wildlife is protected by law, and as of 2005[update], the country has over 2,349 nature reserves, covering a total area of 149.95 million hectares, 15 percent of China's total land area.[151] Most wild animals have been eliminated from the core agricultural regions of east and central China, but they have fared better in the mountainous south and west.[152][153] The Baiji was confirmed extinct on 12 December 2006.[154] China has over 32,000 species of vascular plants,[155] and is home to a variety of forest types. Cold coniferous forests predominate in the north of the country, supporting animal species such as moose and Asian black bear, along with over 120 bird species.[156] The understory of moist conifer forests may contain thickets of bamboo. In higher montane stands of juniper and yew, the bamboo is replaced by rhododendrons. Subtropical forests, which are predominate in central and southern China, support a high density of plant species including numerous rare endemics. Tropical and seasonal rainforests, though confined to Yunnan and Hainan, contain a quarter of all the animal and plant species found in China.[156] China has over 10,000 recorded species of fungi.[157] In the early 2000s, China has suffered from environmental deterioration and pollution due to its rapid pace of industrialization.[158][159] Regulations such as the 1979 Environmental Protection Law are fairly stringent, though they are poorly enforced, frequently disregarded in favor of rapid economic development.[160] China has the second-highest death toll because of air pollution, after India, with approximately 1 million deaths.[161][162] Although China ranks as the highest CO2 emitting country,[163] it only emits 8 tons of CO2 per capita, significantly lower than developed countries such as the United States (16.1), Australia (16.8) and South Korea (13.6).[164] Greenhouse gas emissions by China are the world's largest.[164] The country has significant water pollution problems; only 89.4% of China's national surface water was graded suitable for human consumption by the Ministry of Ecology and Environment in 2023.[165] China has prioritized clamping down on pollution, bringing a significant decrease in air pollution in the 2010s.[166] In 2020, the Chinese government announced its aims for the country to reach its peak emissions levels before 2030, and achieve carbon neutrality by 2060 in line with the Paris Agreement,[167] which, according to Climate Action Tracker, would lower the expected rise in global temperature by 0.2–0.3 degrees – \"the biggest single reduction ever estimated by the Climate Action Tracker\".[167] China is the world's leading investor in renewable energy and its commercialization, with $546 billion invested in 2022;[168] it is a major manufacturer of renewable energy technologies and invests heavily in local-scale renewable energy projects.[169][168] Long heavily relying on non-renewable energy sources such as coal, China's adaptation of renewable energy has increased significantly in recent years, with their share increasing from 26.3 percent in 2016 to 31.9 percent in 2022.[170] In 2023, 60.5% of China's electricity came from coal (largest producer in the world), 13.2% from hydroelectric power (largest), 9.4% from wind (largest), 6.2% from solar energy (largest), 4.6% from nuclear energy (second-largest), 3.3% from natural gas (fifth-largest), and 2.2% from bioenergy (largest); in total, 31% of China's energy came from renewable energy sources.[171] Despite its emphasis on renewables, China remains deeply connected to global oil markets and next to India, has been the largest importer of Russian crude oil in 2022.[172][173] According to China's government, the forest coverage of the country grew from 10% of the overall territory in 1949 to 25% in 2024.[174] China is the third-largest country in the world by land area after Russia, and the third- or fourth-largest country in the world by total area.[r] China's total area is generally stated as being approximately 9,600,000 km2 (3,700,000 sq mi).[175] Specific area figures range from 9,572,900 km2 (3,696,100 sq mi) according to the Encyclopædia Britannica,[14] to 9,596,961 km2 (3,705,407 sq mi) according to the UN Demographic Yearbook,[6] and The World Factbook.[5] China has the longest combined land border in the world, measuring 22,117 km (13,743 mi) and its coastline covers approximately 14,500 km (9,000 mi) from the mouth of the Yalu River (Amnok River) to the Gulf of Tonkin.[5] China borders 14 nations and covers the bulk of East Asia, bordering Vietnam, Laos, and Myanmar in Southeast Asia; India, Bhutan, Nepal, Pakistan[s] and Afghanistan in South Asia; Tajikistan, Kyrgyzstan and Kazakhstan in Central Asia; and Russia, Mongolia, and North Korea in Inner Asia and Northeast Asia. It is narrowly separated from Bangladesh and Thailand to the southwest and south, and has several maritime neighbors such as Japan, Philippines, Malaysia, and Indonesia.[176] China has resolved its land borders with 12 out of 14 neighboring countries, having pursued substantial compromises in most of them.[177][178][179] China currently has a disputed land border with India[180] and Bhutan.[181] China is additionally involved in maritime disputes with multiple countries over territory in the East and South China Seas, such as the Senkaku Islands and the entirety of South China Sea Islands.[182][183] The People's Republic of China is a one-party state governed by the Chinese Communist Party (CCP). The CCP is officially guided by socialism with Chinese characteristics, which is Marxism adapted to Chinese circumstances.[184] The Chinese constitution states that the PRC \"is a socialist state governed by a people's democratic dictatorship that is led by the working class and based on an alliance of workers and peasants,\" that the state institutions \"shall practice the principle of democratic centralism,\"[185] and that \"the defining feature of socialism with Chinese characteristics is the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party.\"[186] The PRC officially terms itself as a democracy, using terms such as \"socialist consultative democracy\",[187] and \"whole-process people's democracy\".[188] However, the country is commonly described as an authoritarian one-party state and a dictatorship,[189][190] with among the heaviest restrictions worldwide in many areas, most notably against freedom of the press, freedom of assembly, free formation of social organizations, freedom of religion and free access to the Internet.[191] China has consistently been ranked amongst the lowest as an \"authoritarian regime\" by the Economist Intelligence Unit's Democracy Index, ranking at 148th out of 167 countries in 2023.[192] Other sources suggest that terming China as \"authoritarian\" does not sufficiently account for the multiple consultation mechanisms that exist in Chinese government.[193] According to the CCP constitution, its highest body is the National Congress held every five years.[194] The National Congress elects the Central Committee, who then elects the party's Politburo, Politburo Standing Committee and the general secretary (party leader), the top leadership of the country.[194] The general secretary holds ultimate power and authority over party and state and serves as the informal paramount leader.[195] The current general secretary is Xi Jinping, who took office on 15 November 2012.[196] At the local level, the secretary of the CCP committee of a subdivision outranks the local government level; CCP committee secretary of a provincial division outranks the governor while the CCP committee secretary of a city outranks the mayor.[197] The government in China is under the sole control of the CCP.[198] The CCP controls appointments in government bodies, with most senior government officials being CCP members.[198] The National People's Congress (NPC), with nearly 3,000-members, is constitutionally the \"highest organ of state power\",[185] though it has been also described as a \"rubber stamp\" body.[199] The NPC meets annually, while the NPC Standing Committee, around 150 members elected from NPC delegates, meets every couple of months.[199] Elections are indirect and not pluralistic, with nominations at all levels being controlled by the CCP.[188] The NPC is dominated by the CCP, with another eight minor parties having nominal representation under the condition of upholding CCP leadership.[200] The president is elected by the NPC. The presidency is the ceremonial state representative, but not the constitutional head of state. The incumbent president is Xi Jinping, who is also the general secretary of the CCP and the chairman of the Central Military Commission, making him China's paramount leader and supreme commander of the Armed Forces. The premier is the head of government, with Li Qiang being the incumbent. The premier is officially nominated by the president and then elected by the NPC, and has generally been either the second- or third-ranking member of the Politburo Standing Committee (PSC). The premier presides over the State Council, China's cabinet, composed of four vice premiers, state councilors, and the heads of ministries and commissions.[185] The Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC) is a political advisory body that is critical in China's \"united front\" system, which aims to gather non-CCP voices to support the CCP. Similar to the people's congresses, CPPCC's exist at various division, with the National Committee of the CPPCC being chaired by Wang Huning, fourth-ranking member of the PSC.[201] The governance of China is characterized by a high degree of political centralization but significant economic decentralization.[202]: 7 Policy instruments or processes are often tested locally before being applied more widely, resulting in a policy that involves experimentation and feedback.[203]: 14 Generally, central government leadership refrains from drafting specific policies, instead using the informal networks and site visits to affirm or suggest changes to the direction of local policy experiments or pilot programs.[204]: 71 The typical approach is that central government leadership begins drafting formal policies, law, or regulations after policy has been developed at local levels.[204]: 71 The PRC is constitutionally a unitary state divided into 23 provinces,[t] five autonomous regions (each with a designated minority group), and four direct-administered municipalities—collectively referred to as \"mainland China\"—as well as the special administrative regions (SARs) of Hong Kong and Macau.[205] The PRC regards the island of Taiwan as its Taiwan Province, Kinmen and Matsu as a part of Fujian Province and islands the ROC controls in the South China Sea as a part of Hainan Province and Guangdong Province, although all these territories are governed by the Republic of China (ROC).[206][33] Geographically, all 31 provincial divisions of mainland China can be grouped into six regions: North China, East China, Southwestern China, South Central China, Northeast China, and Northwestern China.[207] Taiwan (台湾省), governed by the Republic of China The PRC has diplomatic relations with 179 United Nation members states and maintains embassies in 174. As of 2024[update], China has one of the largest diplomatic networks of any country in the world.[208] In 1971, the PRC replaced the Republic of China (ROC) as the sole representative of China in the United Nations and as one of the five permanent members of the United Nations Security Council.[209] It is a member of intergovernmental organizations including the G20,[210] the SCO,[211] the BRICS,[212] the East Asia Summit,[213] and the APEC.[214] China was also a former member and leader of the Non-Aligned Movement, and still considers itself an advocate for developing countries.[215] The PRC officially maintains the one-China principle, which holds the view that there is only one sovereign state in the name of China, represented by the PRC, and that Taiwan is part of that China.[216] The unique status of Taiwan has led to countries recognizing the PRC to maintain unique \"one-China policies\" that differ from each other; some countries explicitly recognize the PRC's claim over Taiwan, while others, including the U.S. and Japan, only acknowledge the claim.[216] Chinese officials have protested on numerous occasions when foreign countries have made diplomatic overtures to Taiwan,[217] especially in the matter of armament sales.[218] Most countries have switched recognition from the ROC to the PRC since the latter replaced the former in the UN in 1971.[219] Much of current Chinese foreign policy is reportedly based on Premier Zhou Enlai's Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence, and is also driven by the concept of \"harmony without uniformity\", which encourages diplomatic relations between states despite ideological differences.[220] This policy may have led China to support or maintain close ties with states that are regarded as dangerous and repressive by Western nations, such as Sudan,[221] North Korea and Iran.[222] China's close relationship with Myanmar has involved support for its ruling governments as well as for its ethnic rebel groups,[223] including the Arakan Army.[224] China has a close political, economic and military relationship with Russia,[225] and the two states often vote in unison in the UN Security Council.[226][227][228] China's relationship with the United States is complex, and includes deep trade ties but significant political differences.[229] Since the early 2000s, China has followed a policy of engaging with African nations for trade and bilateral co-operation.[230][231][232] It maintains extensive and highly diversified trade links with the European Union, and became its largest trading partner for goods.[233] China is increasing its influence in Central Asia[234] and South Pacific.[235] The country has strong trade ties with ASEAN countries[236] and major South American economies,[237] and is the largest trading partner of Brazil, Chile, Peru, Uruguay, Argentina, and several others.[238] In 2013, China initiated the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), a large global infrastructure building initiative with funding on the order of $50–100 billion per year.[239] BRI could be one of the largest development plans in modern history.[240] It expanded significantly over the next six years and, as of April 2020[update], included 138 countries and 30 international organizations. In addition to intensifying foreign policy relations, the focus is particularly on building efficient transport routes, especially the maritime Silk Road with its connections to East Africa and Europe. However many loans made under the program are unsustainable and China has faced a number of calls for debt relief from debtor nations.[241][242] The People's Liberation Army (PLA) is considered one of the world's most powerful militaries and has rapidly modernized in the recent decades.[243] It has also been accused of technology theft by some countries.[244][245][246] Since 2024, it consists of four services: the Ground Force (PLAGF), the Navy (PLAN), the Air Force (PLAAF) and the Rocket Force (PLARF). It also has four independent arms: the Aerospace Force, the Cyberspace Force, the Information Support Force, and the Joint Logistics Support Force, the first three of which were split from the disbanded Strategic Support Force (PLASSF).[247] Its nearly 2.2 million active duty personnel is the largest in the world. The PLA holds the world's third-largest stockpile of nuclear weapons,[248][249] and the world's second-largest navy by tonnage.[250] China's official military budget for 2023 totalled US$224 billion (1.55 trillion Yuan), the second-largest in the world, though SIPRI estimates that its real expenditure that year was US$296 billion, making up 12% of global military spending and accounting for 1.7% of the country's GDP.[251] According to SIPRI, its military spending from 2012 to 2021 averaged US$215 billion per year or 1.7 per cent of GDP, behind only the United States at US$734 billion per year or 3.6 per cent of GDP.[252] The PLA is commanded by the Central Military Commission (CMC) of the party and the state; though officially two separate organizations, the two CMCs have identical membership except during leadership transition periods and effectively function as one organization. The chairman of the CMC is the commander-in-chief of the PLA.[253] The situation of human rights in China has attracted significant criticism from foreign governments, foreign press agencies, and non-governmental organizations, alleging widespread civil rights violations such as detention without trial, forced confessions, torture, restrictions of fundamental rights, and excessive use of the death penalty.[191][254] Since its inception, Freedom House has ranked China as \"not free\" in its Freedom in the World survey,[191] while Amnesty International has documented significant human rights abuses.[254] The Chinese constitution states that the \"fundamental rights\" of citizens include freedom of speech, freedom of the press, the right to a fair trial, freedom of religion, universal suffrage, and property rights. However, in practice, these provisions do not afford significant protection against criminal prosecution by the state.[255][256] China has limited protections regarding LGBT rights.[257] Although some criticisms of government policies and the ruling CCP are tolerated, censorship of political speech and information are amongst the harshest in the world and routinely used to prevent collective action.[258] China also has the most comprehensive and sophisticated Internet censorship regime in the world, with numerous websites being blocked.[259] The government suppresses popular protests and demonstrations that it considers a potential threat to \"social stability\".[260] China additionally uses a massive espionage network of cameras, facial recognition software, sensors, and surveillance of personal technology as a means of social control of persons living in the country.[261] China is regularly accused of large-scale repression and human rights abuses in Tibet and Xinjiang,[263][264][265] where significant numbers of ethnic minorities reside, including violent police crackdowns and religious suppression.[266][267] Since 2017, the Chinese government has been engaged in a harsh crackdown in Xinjiang, with around one million Uyghurs and other ethnic and religion minorities being detained in internment camps aimed at changing the political thinking of detainees, their identities, and their religious beliefs.[268] According to Western reports, political indoctrination, torture, physical and psychological abuse, forced sterilization, sexual abuse, and forced labor are common in these facilities.[269] According to a 2020 Foreign Policy report, China's treatment of Uyghurs meets the UN definition of genocide,[270] while a separate UN Human Rights Office report said they could potentially meet the definitions for crimes against humanity.[271] The Chinese authorities have also cracked down on dissent in Hong Kong, especially after the passage of a national security law in 2020.[272] In 2017 and 2020, the Pew Research Center ranked the severity of Chinese government restrictions on religion as being among the world's highest, despite ranking religious-related social hostilities in China as low in severity.[273][274] The Global Slavery Index estimated that in 2016 more than 3.8 million people (0.25% of the population) were living in \"conditions of modern slavery\", including victims of human trafficking, forced labor, forced marriage, child labor, and state-imposed forced labor. The state-imposed re-education through labor (laojiao) system was formally abolished in 2013, but it is not clear to what extent its practices have stopped.[275] The much larger reform through labor (laogai) system includes labor prison factories, detention centers, and re-education camps; the Laogai Research Foundation has estimated in June 2008 that there were nearly 1,422 of these facilities, though it cautioned that this number was likely an underestimate.[276] Political concerns in China include the growing gap between rich and poor and government corruption.[277] Nonetheless, international surveys show the Chinese public have a high level of satisfaction with their government.[202]: 137 These views are generally attributed to the material comforts and security available to large segments of the Chinese populace as well as the government's attentiveness and responsiveness.[202] : 136 According to the World Values Survey (2022), 91% of Chinese respondents have significant confidence in their government.[202]: 13 A Harvard University survey published in July 2020 found that citizen satisfaction with the government had increased since 2003, also rating China's government as more effective and capable than ever in the survey's history.[278] China has the world's second-largest economy in terms of nominal GDP,[279] and the world's largest in terms of purchasing power parity (PPP).[280] As of 2022[update], China accounts for around 18% of the global economy by nominal GDP.[281] China is one of the world's fastest-growing major economies,[282] with its economic growth having been almost consistently above 6 percent since the introduction of economic reforms in 1978.[283] According to the World Bank, China's GDP grew from $150 billion in 1978 to $17.96 trillion by 2022.[284] It ranks at 64th at nominal GDP per capita, making it an upper-middle income country.[285] Of the world's 500 largest companies, 135 are headquartered in China.[286] As of at least 2024, China has the world's second-largest equity markets and futures markets, as well as the third-largest bond market.[287]: 153 China was one of the world's foremost economic powers throughout the arc of East Asian and global history. The country had one of the largest economies in the world for most of the past two millennia,[288] during which it has seen cycles of prosperity and decline.[54][289] Since economic reforms began in 1978, China has developed into a highly diversified economy and one of the most consequential players in international trade. Major sectors of competitive strength include manufacturing, retail, mining, steel, textiles, automobiles, energy generation, green energy, banking, electronics, telecommunications, real estate, e-commerce, and tourism. China has three out of the ten largest stock exchanges in the world[290]—Shanghai, Hong Kong and Shenzhen—that together have a market capitalization of over $15.9 trillion, as of October 2020[update].[291] China has three (Shanghai, Hong Kong, and Shenzhen) out of the world's top ten most competitive financial centers according to the 2024 Global Financial Centres Index.[292] Modern-day China is often described as an example of state capitalism or party-state capitalism.[294][295] The state dominates in strategic \"pillar\" sectors such as energy production and heavy industries, but private enterprise has expanded enormously, with around 30 million private businesses recorded in 2008.[296][297][298] According to official statistics, privately owned companies constitute more than 60% of China's GDP.[299] China has been the world's largest manufacturing nation since 2010, after overtaking the U.S., which had been the largest for the previous hundred years.[300][301] China has also been the second-largest in high-tech manufacturing country since 2012, according to US National Science Foundation.[302] China is the second-largest retail market after the United States.[303] China leads the world in e-commerce, accounting for over 37% of the global market share in 2021.[304] China is the world's leader in electric vehicle consumption and production, manufacturing and buying half of all the plug-in electric cars (BEV and PHEV) in the world as of 2022[update].[305] China is also the leading producer of batteries for electric vehicles as well as several key raw materials for batteries.[306] China received 65.7 million international visitors in 2019,[307] and in 2018 was the fourth-most-visited country in the world.[307] It also experiences an enormous volume of domestic tourism; Chinese tourists made an estimated 6 billion travels within the country in 2019.[308] China hosts the world's second-largest number of World Heritage Sites (56) after Italy, and is one of the most popular tourist destinations (first in the Asia-Pacific). China accounted for 18.6% of the world's total wealth in 2022, second highest in the world after the U.S.[309] China brought more people out of extreme poverty than any other country in history[310][311]—between 1978 and 2018, China reduced extreme poverty by 800 million.[202]: 23 From 1990 to 2018, the proportion of the Chinese population living with an income of less than $1.90 per day (2011 PPP) decreased from 66.3% to 0.3%, the share living with an income of less than $3.20 per day from 90.0% to 2.9%, and the share living with an income of less than $5.50 per day decreased from 98.3% to 17.0%.[312] From 1978 to 2018, the average standard of living multiplied by a factor of twenty-six.[313] Wages in China have grown significantly in the last 40 years—real (inflation-adjusted) wages grew seven-fold from 1978 to 2007.[314] Per capita incomes have also risen significantly – when the PRC was founded in 1949, per capita income in China was one-fifth of the world average; per capita incomes now equal the world average itself.[313] China's development is highly uneven. Its major cities and coastal areas are far more prosperous compared to rural and interior regions.[315] It has a high level of economic inequality,[316] which has increased quickly after the economic reforms,[317] though has decreased significantly in the 2010s.[318] In 2021, China's Gini coefficient was 0.357, according to the World Bank.[12] As of March 2024[update], China was second in the world, after the U.S., in total number of billionaires and total number of millionaires, with 473 Chinese billionaires[319] and 6.2 million millionaires.[309] In 2019, China overtook the U.S. as the home to the highest number of people who have a net personal wealth of at least $110,000, according to the global wealth report by Credit Suisse.[320][321] China had 85 female billionaires as of January 2021[update], two-thirds of the global total.[322] China has had the world's largest middle-class population since 2015;[323] the middle-class grew to 500 million by 2024.[324] China has been a member of the WTO since 2001 and is the world's largest trading power.[325] By 2016, China was the largest trading partner of 124 countries.[326] China became the world's largest trading nation in 2013 by the sum of imports and exports, as well as the world's largest commodity importer, accounting for roughly 45% of maritime's dry-bulk market.[327][328] China's foreign exchange reserves reached US$3.246 trillion as of March 2024[update], making its reserves by far the world's largest.[329] In 2022, China was amongst the world's largest recipient of inward foreign direct investment (FDI), attracting $180 billion, though most of these were speculated to be from Hong Kong.[330] In 2021, China's foreign exchange remittances were $US53 billion making it the second-largest recipient of remittances in the world.[331] China also invests abroad, with a total outward FDI of $147.9 billion in 2023,[332] and a number of major takeovers of foreign firms by Chinese companies.[333] Economists have argued that the renminbi is undervalued, due to currency intervention from the Chinese government, giving China an unfair trade advantage.[334] China has also been widely criticized for manufacturing large quantities of counterfeit goods.[335][336] The U.S. government has also alleged that China does not respect intellectual property (IP) rights and steals IP through espionage operations.[337] In 2020, Harvard University's Economic Complexity Index ranked complexity of China's exports 17th in the world, up from 24th in 2010.[338] The Chinese government has promoted the internationalization of the renminbi in order to wean itself off its dependence on the U.S. dollar as a result of perceived weaknesses of the international monetary system.[339] The renminbi is a component of the IMF's special drawing rights and the world's fourth-most traded currency as of 2023[update].[340] However, partly due to capital controls that make the renminbi fall short of being a fully convertible currency, it remains far behind the Euro, the U.S. Dollar and the Japanese Yen in international trade volumes.[341] China was a world leader in science and technology until the Ming dynasty.[342] Ancient and medieval Chinese discoveries and inventions, such as papermaking, printing, the compass, and gunpowder (the Four Great Inventions), became widespread across East Asia, the Middle East and later Europe. Chinese mathematicians were the first to use negative numbers.[343][344] By the 17th century, the Western World surpassed China in scientific and technological advancement.[345] The causes of this early modern Great Divergence continue to be debated by scholars.[346] After repeated military defeats by the European colonial powers and Imperial Japan in the 19th century, Chinese reformers began promoting modern science and technology as part of the Self-Strengthening Movement. After the Communists came to power in 1949, efforts were made to organize science and technology based on the model of the Soviet Union, in which scientific research was part of central planning.[347] After Mao's death in 1976, science and technology were promoted as one of the Four Modernizations,[348] and the Soviet-inspired academic system was gradually reformed.[349] Since the end of the Cultural Revolution, China has made significant investments in scientific research[350] and is quickly catching up with the U.S. in R&D spending.[351][352] China officially spent around 2.6% of its GDP on R&D in 2023, totaling to around $458.5 billion.[353] According to the World Intellectual Property Indicators, China received more applications than the U.S. did in 2018 and 2019 and ranked first globally in patents, utility models, trademarks, industrial designs, and creative goods exports in 2021.[354][355][356] It was ranked 11th in the Global Innovation Index in 2024, a considerable improvement from its rank of 35th in 2013.[357][358][359] Chinese supercomputers ranked among the fastest in the world.[360][u] Its efforts to develop the most advanced semiconductors and jet engines have seen delays and setbacks.[361][362] China is developing its education system with an emphasis on science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM).[363] Its academic publication apparatus became the world's largest publisher of scientific papers in 2016.[364][365][366] In 2022, China overtook the US in the Nature Index, which measures the share of published articles in leading scientific journals.[367][368] The Chinese space program started in 1958 with some technology transfers from the Soviet Union. However, it did not launch the nation's first satellite until 1970 with the Dong Fang Hong I, which made China the fifth country to do so independently.[369] In 2003, China became the third country in the world to independently send humans into space with Yang Liwei's spaceflight aboard Shenzhou 5. As of 2023, eighteen Chinese nationals have journeyed into space, including two women. In 2011, China launched its first space station testbed, Tiangong-1.[370] In 2013, a Chinese robotic rover Yutu successfully touched down on the lunar surface as part of the Chang'e 3 mission.[371] In 2019, China became the first country to land a probe—Chang'e 4—on the far side of the Moon.[372] In 2020, Chang'e 5 successfully returned Moon samples to the Earth, making China the third country to do so independently.[373] In 2021, China became the third country to land a spacecraft on Mars and the second one to deploy a rover (Zhurong) on Mars.[374] China completed its own modular space station, the Tiangong, in low Earth orbit on 3 November 2022.[375][376][377] On 29 November 2022, China performed its first in-orbit crew handover aboard the Tiangong.[378][379] In May 2023, China announced a plan to land humans on the Moon by 2030.[380] To that end, China has been developing a lunar-capable super-heavy launcher, the Long March 10, a new crewed spacecraft, and a crewed lunar lander.[381][382] China sent Chang'e 6 on 3 May 2024, which conducted the first lunar sample return from Apollo Basin on the far side of the Moon.[383] This is China's second lunar sample return mission, the first was achieved by Chang'e 5 from the lunar near side 4 years ago.[384] It also carried a Chinese rover called Jinchan to conduct infrared spectroscopy of lunar surface and imaged Chang'e 6 lander on lunar surface.[385] The lander-ascender-rover combination was separated with the orbiter and returner before landing on 1 June 2024, at 22:23 UTC. It landed on the Moon's surface on 1 June 2024.[386][387] The ascender was launched back to lunar orbit on 3 June 2024, at 23:38 UTC, carrying samples collected by the lander, which later completed another robotic rendezvous, before docking in lunar orbit. The sample container was then transferred to the returner, which landed on Inner Mongolia in June 2024, completing China's far side extraterrestrial sample return mission. After a decades-long infrastructural boom,[388] China has produced numerous world-leading infrastructural projects: it has the largest high-speed rail network,[389] the most supertall skyscrapers,[390] the largest power plant (the Three Gorges Dam),[391] the most extensive ultra-high-voltage transmission network and innovation infrastructure, [392][393] and a global satellite navigation system with the largest number of satellites.[394] China is the largest telecom market in the world and currently has the largest number of active cellphones of any country, with over 1.7 billion subscribers, as of February 2023[update]. It has the largest number of internet and broadband users, with over 1.09 billion Internet users as of December 2023[update][395]—equivalent to around 77.5% of its population.[396] By 2018, China had more than 1 billion 4G users, accounting for 40% of world's total.[397] China is making rapid advances in 5G—by late 2018, China had started large-scale and commercial 5G trials.[398] As of December 2023[update], China had over 810 million 5G users and 3.38 million base stations installed.[399] China Mobile, China Unicom and China Telecom, are the three large providers of mobile and internet in China. China Telecom alone served more than 145 million broadband subscribers and 300 million mobile users; China Unicom had about 300 million subscribers; and China Mobile, the largest of them all, had 925 million users, as of 2018[update].[400] Combined, the three operators had over 3.4 million 4G base-stations in China.[401] Several Chinese telecommunications companies, most notably Huawei and ZTE, have been accused of spying for the Chinese military.[402] China has developed its own satellite navigation system, dubbed BeiDou, which began offering commercial navigation services across Asia in 2012[403] as well as global services by the end of 2018.[404] Beidou followed GPS and GLONASS as the third completed global navigation satellite.[405] Since the late 1990s, China's national road network has been significantly expanded through the creation of a network of national highways and expressways. In 2022, China's highways had reached a total length of 177,000 km (110,000 mi), making it the longest highway system in the world.[406] China has the world's largest market for automobiles,[407][408] having surpassed the United States in both auto sales and production. The country is the world's largest exporter of cars by number as of 2023.[409][410] A side-effect of the rapid growth of China's road network has been a significant rise in traffic accidents.[411] In urban areas, bicycles remain a common mode of transport, despite the increasing prevalence of automobiles – as of 2023[update], there are approximately 200 million bicycles in China.[412] China's railways, which are operated by the state-owned China State Railway Group Company, are among the busiest in the world, handling a quarter of the world's rail traffic volume on only 6 percent of the world's tracks in 2006.[413] As of 2023[update], the country had 159,000 km (98,798 mi) of railways, the second-longest network in the world.[414] The railways strain to meet enormous demand particularly during the Chinese New Year holiday, when the world's largest annual human migration takes place.[415] China's high-speed rail (HSR) system started construction in the early 2000s. By the end of 2023, high speed rail in China had reached 45,000 kilometers (27,962 miles) of dedicated lines alone, making it the longest HSR network in the world.[416] Services on the Beijing–Shanghai, Beijing–Tianjin, and Chengdu–Chongqing lines reach up to 350 km/h (217 mph), making them the fastest conventional high speed railway services in the world. With an annual ridership of over 2.3 billion passengers in 2019, it is the world's busiest.[417] The network includes the Beijing–Guangzhou high-speed railway, the single longest HSR line in the world, and the Beijing–Shanghai high-speed railway, which has three of longest railroad bridges in the world.[418] The Shanghai maglev train, which reaches 431 km/h (268 mph), is the fastest commercial train service in the world.[419] Since 2000, the growth of rapid transit systems in Chinese cities has accelerated.[420] As of December 2023[update], 55 Chinese cities have urban mass transit systems in operation.[421] As of 2020[update], China boasts the five longest metro systems in the world with the networks in Shanghai, Beijing, Guangzhou, Chengdu and Shenzhen being the largest. The civil aviation industry in China is mostly state-dominated, with the Chinese government retaining a majority stake in the majority of Chinese airlines. The top three airlines in China, which collectively made up 71% of the market in 2018, are all state-owned. Air travel has expanded rapidly in the last decades, with the number of passengers increasing from 16.6 million in 1990 to 551.2 million in 2017.[422] China had approximately 259 airports in 2024.[423] China has over 2,000 river and seaports, about 130 of which are open to foreign shipping.[424] Of the fifty busiest container ports, 15 are located in China, of which the busiest is the Port of Shanghai, also the busiest port in the world.[425] The country's inland waterways are the world's sixth-longest, and total 27,700 km (17,212 mi).[426] Water supply and sanitation infrastructure in China is facing challenges such as rapid urbanization, as well as water scarcity, contamination, and pollution.[427] According to the Joint Monitoring Program for Water Supply and Sanitation, about 36% of the rural population in China still did not have access to improved sanitation in 2015.[428][needs update] The ongoing South–North Water Transfer Project intends to abate water shortage in the north.[429] The 2020 Chinese census recorded the population as approximately 1,411,778,724. About 17.95% were 14 years old or younger, 63.35% were between 15 and 59 years old, and 18.7% were over 60 years old.[430] Between 2010 and 2020, the average population growth rate was 0.53%.[430] Given concerns about population growth, China implemented a two-child limit during the 1970s, and, in 1979, began to advocate for an even stricter limit of one child per family. Beginning in the mid-1980s, however, given the unpopularity of the strict limits, China began to allow some major exemptions, particularly in rural areas, resulting in what was actually a \"1.5\"-child policy from the mid-1980s to 2015; ethnic minorities were also exempt from one-child limits.[431] The next major loosening of the policy was enacted in December 2013, allowing families to have two children if one parent is an only child.[432] In 2016, the one-child policy was replaced in favor of a two-child policy.[433] A three-child policy was announced on 31 May 2021, due to population aging,[433] and in July 2021, all family size limits as well as penalties for exceeding them were removed.[434] In 2023, the total fertility rate was reported to be 1.09, ranking among the lowest in the world.[435] In 2023, National Bureau of Statistics estimated that the population fell 850,000 from 2021 to 2022, the first decline since 1961.[436] According to one group of scholars, one-child limits had little effect on population growth[437] or total population size.[438] However, these scholars have been challenged.[439] The policy, along with traditional preference for boys, may have contributed to an imbalance in the sex ratio at birth.[440][441] The 2020 census found that males accounted for 51.2% of the total population.[442] However, China's sex ratio is more balanced than it was in 1953, when males accounted for 51.8% of the population.[443] The cultural preference for male children, combined with the one-child policy, led to an excess of female child orphans in China, and in the 1990s through around 2007, there was an active stream of adoptions of (mainly female) babies by American and other foreign parents.[444] However, increased restrictions by the Chinese Government slowed foreign adoptions significantly in 2007 and again in 2015.[445] China has urbanized significantly in recent decades. The percent of the country's population living in urban areas increased from 20% in 1980 to over 66% in 2023.[446][447][448] China has over 160 cities with a population of over one million,[449] including the 17 megacities as of 2021[update][450][451] (cities with a population of over 10 million) of Chongqing, Shanghai, Beijing, Chengdu, Guangzhou, Shenzhen, Tianjin, Xi'an, Suzhou, Zhengzhou, Wuhan, Hangzhou, Linyi, Shijiazhuang, Dongguan, Qingdao and Changsha.[452] The total permanent population of Chongqing, Shanghai, Beijing and Chengdu is above 20 million.[453] Shanghai is China's most populous urban area[454][455] while Chongqing is its largest city proper, the only city in China with a permanent population of over 30 million.[456] The figures in the table below are from the 2020 census, and are only estimates of the urban populations within administrative city limits; a different ranking exists for total municipal populations. The large \"floating populations\" of migrant workers make conducting censuses in urban areas difficult;[457] the figures below include only long-term residents. China legally recognizes 56 distinct ethnic groups, who comprise the Zhonghua minzu. The largest of these nationalities are the Han Chinese, who constitute more than 91% of the total population.[430] The Han Chinese – the world's largest single ethnic group[461] – outnumber other ethnic groups in every place excluding Tibet, Xinjiang,[462] Linxia,[463] and autonomous prefectures like Xishuangbanna.[464] Ethnic minorities account for less than 10% of the population of China, according to the 2020 census.[430] Compared with the 2010 population census, the Han population increased by 60,378,693 persons, or 4.93%, while the population of the 55 national minorities combined increased by 11,675,179 persons, or 10.26%.[430] The 2020 census recorded a total of 845,697 foreign nationals living in mainland China.[465] There are as many as 292 living languages in China.[466] The languages most commonly spoken belong to the Sinitic branch of the Sino-Tibetan language family, which contains Mandarin (spoken by 80% of the population),[467][468] and other varieties of Chinese language: Jin, Wu, Min, Hakka, Yue, Xiang, Gan, Hui, Ping and unclassified Tuhua (Shaozhou Tuhua and Xiangnan Tuhua).[469] Languages of the Tibeto-Burman branch, including Tibetan, Qiang, Naxi and Yi, are spoken across the Tibetan and Yunnan–Guizhou Plateau. Other ethnic minority languages in southwestern China include Zhuang, Thai, Dong and Sui of the Tai-Kadai family, Miao and Yao of the Hmong–Mien family, and Wa of the Austroasiatic family. Across northeastern and northwestern China, local ethnic groups speak Altaic languages including Manchu, Mongolian and several Turkic languages: Uyghur, Kazakh, Kyrgyz, Salar and Western Yugur.[470] Korean is spoken natively along the border with North Korea. Sarikoli, the language of Tajiks in western Xinjiang, is an Indo-European language.[471] Taiwanese indigenous peoples, including a small population on the mainland, speak Austronesian languages.[472] Standard Chinese, a variety based on the Beijing dialect of Mandarin, is the national language of China, having de facto official status.[2] It is used as a lingua franca between people of different linguistic backgrounds.[473] In the autonomous regions of China, other languages may also serve as a lingua franca, such as Uyghur in Xinjiang, where governmental services in Uyghur are constitutionally guaranteed.[474] Freedom of religion is guaranteed by China's constitution, although religious organizations that lack official approval can be subject to state persecution.[185] The government of the country is officially atheist. Religious affairs and issues in the country are overseen by the National Religious Affairs Administration, under the United Front Work Department.[479] Over the millennia, the Chinese civilization has been influenced by various religious movements. The \"three doctrines\" of Confucianism, Taoism, and Buddhism have historically shaped Chinese culture,[480][481] enriching a theological and spiritual framework of traditional religion which harks back to the early Shang and Zhou dynasty. Chinese folk religion, which is framed by the three doctrines and by other traditions,[482] consists in allegiance to the shen, who can be deities of the surrounding nature or ancestral principles of human groups, concepts of civility, culture heroes, many of whom feature in Chinese mythology and history.[483] Amongst the most popular cults of folk religion are those of the Yellow Emperor, embodiment of the God of Heaven and one of the two divine patriarchs of the Chinese people,[484][485] of Mazu (goddess of the seas),[484] Guandi (god of war and business), Caishen (god of prosperity and richness), Pangu and many others. In the early decades of the 21st century, the Chinese government has been engaged in a rehabilitation of folk cults—formally recognizing them as \"folk beliefs\" as distinguished from doctrinal religions,[486] and often reconstructing them into forms of \"highly curated\" civil religion[487]—as well as in a national and international promotion of Buddhism.[488] China is home to many of the world's tallest religious statues, representing either deities of Chinese folk religion or enlightened beings of Buddhism; the tallest of all is the Spring Temple Buddha in Henan. Statistics on religious affiliation in China are difficult to gather due to complex and varying definitions of religion and the diffusive nature of Chinese religious traditions. Scholars note that in China there is no clear boundary between the three doctrines and local folk religious practices.[480] Chinese religions or some of their currents are also definable as non-theistic and humanistic, since they do not hold that divine creativity is completely transcendent, but that it is inherent in the world and in particular in the human being.[489] According to studies published in 2023, compiling demographic analyses conducted throughout the 2010s and the early 2020s, 70% of the Chinese population believed in or practiced Chinese folk religion—among them, with an approach of non-exclusivity, 33.4% may be identified as Buddhists, 19.6% as Taoists, and 17.7% as adherents of other types of folk religion.[4] Of the remaining population, 25.2% are fully non-believers or atheists, 2.5% are adherents of Christianity, and 1.6% are adherents of Islam.[4] Chinese folk religion also comprises a variety of salvationist doctrinal organized movements which emerged since the Song dynasty.[490] There are also ethnic minorities in China who maintain their own indigenous religions, while major religions characteristic of specific ethnic groups include Tibetan Buddhism among Tibetans, Mongols and Yugurs,[491] and Islam among the Hui, Uyghur, Kazakh,[492] and Kyrgyz peoples, and other ethnicities in the northern and northwestern regions of the country. Compulsory education in China comprises primary and junior secondary school, which together last for nine years from the age of 6 and 15.[495] The Gaokao, China's national university entrance exam, is a prerequisite for entrance into most higher education institutions. Vocational education is available to students at the secondary and tertiary level.[496] More than 10 million Chinese students graduated from vocational colleges every year.[497] In 2023, about 91.8 percent of students continued their education at a three-year senior secondary school, while 60.2 percent of secondary school graduates were enrolled in higher education.[498] China has the largest education system in the world,[499] with about 291 million students and 18.92 million full-time teachers in over 498,300 schools in 2023.[500] Annual education investment went from less than US$50 billion in 2003 to more than US$817 billion in 2020.[501][502] However, there remains an inequality in education spending. In 2010, the annual education expenditure per secondary school student in Beijing totalled ¥20,023, while in Guizhou, one of the poorest provinces, it only totalled ¥3,204.[503] China's literacy rate has grown dramatically, from only 20% in 1949 and 65.5% in 1979,[504] to 97% of the population over age 15 in 2020.[505] As of 2023[update], China has over 3,074 universities, with over 47.6 million students enrolled in mainland China, giving China the largest higher education system in the world.[506][507] As of 2023[update], China had the world's highest number of top universities.[508][509] Currently, China trails only the United States and the United Kingdom in terms of representation on lists of the top 200 universities according to the 2023 Aggregate Ranking of Top Universities, a composite ranking system of three world-most followed university rankings (ARWU+QS+THE).[510] China is home to two of the highest-ranking universities (Tsinghua University and Peking University) in Asia and emerging economies, according to the Times Higher Education World University Rankings[511] and the Academic Ranking of World Universities.[512] These universities are members of the C9 League, an alliance of elite Chinese universities offering comprehensive and leading education.[513] The National Health Commission, together with its counterparts in the local commissions, oversees the health needs of the population.[514] An emphasis on public health and preventive medicine has characterized Chinese health policy since the early 1950s. The Communist Party started the Patriotic Health Campaign, which was aimed at improving sanitation and hygiene, as well as treating and preventing several diseases. Diseases such as cholera, typhoid and scarlet fever, which were previously rife in China, were nearly eradicated by the campaign.[515] After Deng Xiaoping began instituting economic reforms in 1978, the health of the Chinese public improved rapidly because of better nutrition, although many of the free public health services provided in the countryside disappeared. Healthcare in China became mostly privatized, and experienced a significant rise in quality. In 2009, the government began a three-year large-scale healthcare provision initiative worth US$124 billion.[516] By 2011, the campaign resulted in 95% of China's population having basic health insurance coverage.[517] By 2022, China had established itself as a key producer and exporter of pharmaceuticals, producing around 40 percent of active pharmaceutical ingredients in 2017.[518] As of 2023[update], the life expectancy at birth exceeds 78 years.[519]: 163 As of 2021[update], the infant mortality rate is 5 per thousand.[520] Both have improved significantly since the 1950s.[v] Rates of stunting, a condition caused by malnutrition, have declined from 33.1% in 1990 to 9.9% in 2010.[523] Despite significant improvements in health and the construction of advanced medical facilities, China has several emerging public health problems, such as respiratory illnesses caused by widespread air pollution,[524] hundreds of millions of cigarette smokers,[525] and an increase in obesity among urban youths.[526][527] In 2010, air pollution caused 1.2 million premature deaths in China.[528] Chinese mental health services are inadequate.[529] China's large population and densely populated cities have led to serious disease outbreaks, such as SARS in 2003, although this has since been largely contained.[530] The COVID-19 pandemic was first identified in Wuhan in December 2019;[531][532] pandemic led the government to enforce strict public health measures intended to completely eradicate the virus, a goal that was eventually abandoned in December 2022 after protests against the policy.[533][534] Since ancient times, Chinese culture has been heavily influenced by Confucianism. Chinese culture, in turn, has heavily influenced East Asia and Southeast Asia.[536] For much of the country's dynastic era, opportunities for social advancement could be provided by high performance in the prestigious imperial examinations, which have their origins in the Han dynasty.[537] The literary emphasis of the exams affected the general perception of cultural refinement in China, such as the belief that calligraphy, poetry and painting were higher forms of art than dancing or drama. Chinese culture has long emphasized a sense of deep history and a largely inward-looking national perspective.[538] Examinations and a culture of merit remain greatly valued in China today.[539] Today, the Chinese government has accepted numerous elements of traditional Chinese culture as being integral to Chinese society. With the rise of Chinese nationalism and the end of the Cultural Revolution, various forms of traditional Chinese art, literature, music, film, fashion and architecture have seen a vigorous revival,[541][542] and folk and variety art in particular have sparked interest nationally and even worldwide.[543] Access to foreign media remains heavily restricted.[544] Chinese architecture has developed over millennia in China and has remained a vestigial source of perennial influence on the development of East Asian architecture,[545][546][547] including in Japan, Korea, and Mongolia.[548] and minor influences on the architecture of Southeast and South Asia including the countries of Malaysia, Singapore, Indonesia, Sri Lanka, Thailand, Laos, Cambodia, Vietnam and the Philippines.[549][550] Chinese architecture is characterized by bilateral symmetry, use of enclosed open spaces, feng shui (e.g. directional hierarchies),[551] a horizontal emphasis, and an allusion to various cosmological, mythological or in general symbolic elements. Chinese architecture traditionally classifies structures according to type, ranging from pagodas to palaces.[552][548] Chinese architecture varies widely based on status or affiliation, such as whether the structures were constructed for emperors, commoners, or for religious purposes. Other variations in Chinese architecture are shown in vernacular styles associated with different geographic regions and different ethnic heritages, such as the stilt houses in the south, the Yaodong buildings in the northwest, the yurt buildings of nomadic people, and the Siheyuan buildings in the north.[553] Chinese literature has its roots in the Zhou dynasty's literary tradition.[554] The classical texts of China encompass a wide range of thoughts and subjects, such as the calendar, military, astrology, herbology, and geography, as well as many others.[555] Among the most significant early works are the I Ching and the Shujing, which are part of the Four Books and Five Classics. These texts were the cornerstone of the Confucian curriculum sponsored by the state throughout the dynastic periods. Inherited from the Classic of Poetry, classical Chinese poetry developed to its floruit during the Tang dynasty. Li Bai and Du Fu opened the forking ways for the poetic circles through romanticism and realism respectively. Chinese historiography began with the Shiji, the overall scope of the historiographical tradition in China is termed the Twenty-Four Histories, which set a vast stage for Chinese fictions along with Chinese mythology and folklore.[556] Pushed by a burgeoning citizen class in the Ming dynasty, Chinese classical fiction rose to a boom of the historical, town and gods and demons fictions as represented by the Four Great Classical Novels which include Water Margin, Romance of the Three Kingdoms, Journey to the West and Dream of the Red Chamber.[557] Along with the wuxia fictions of Jin Yong and Liang Yusheng,[558] it remains an enduring source of popular culture in the Chinese sphere of influence.[559] In the wake of the New Culture Movement after the end of the Qing dynasty, Chinese literature embarked on a new era with written vernacular Chinese for ordinary citizens. Hu Shih and Lu Xun were pioneers in modern literature.[560] Various literary genres, such as misty poetry, scar literature, young adult fiction and the xungen literature, which is influenced by magic realism,[561] emerged following the Cultural Revolution. Mo Yan, a xungen literature author, was awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature in 2012.[562] Chinese music covers a highly diverse range of music from traditional music to modern music. Chinese music dates back before the pre-imperial times. Traditional Chinese musical instruments were traditionally grouped into eight categories known as bayin (八音). Traditional Chinese opera is a form of musical theatre in China originating thousands of years and has regional style forms such as Beijing and Cantonese opera.[563] Chinese pop (C-Pop) includes mandopop and cantopop. Chinese hip hop and Hong Kong hip hop have become popular.[564] Hanfu is the historical clothing of the Han people in China. The qipao or cheongsam is a popular Chinese female dress.[565] The hanfu movement has been popular in contemporary times and seeks to revitalize Hanfu clothing.[566] China Fashion Week is the country's only national-level fashion festival.[567] Cinema was first introduced to China in 1896 and the first Chinese film, Dingjun Mountain, was released in 1905.[568] China has the largest number of movie screens in the world since 2016;[569] China became the largest cinema market in 2020.[570][571] The top three highest-grossing films in China as of 2023[update] were The Battle at Lake Changjin (2021), Wolf Warrior 2 (2017), and Hi, Mom (2021).[572] Chinese cuisine is highly diverse, drawing on several millennia of culinary history and geographical variety, in which the most influential are known as the \"Eight Major Cuisines\", including Sichuan, Cantonese, Jiangsu, Shandong, Fujian, Hunan, Anhui, and Zhejiang cuisines.[573] Chinese cuisine is known for its breadth of cooking methods and ingredients.[574] China's staple food is rice in the northeast and south, and wheat-based breads and noodles in the north. Bean products such as tofu and soy milk remain a popular source of protein. Pork is now the most popular meat in China, accounting for about three-fourths of the country's total meat consumption.[575] There is also the vegetarian Buddhist cuisine and the pork-free Chinese Islamic cuisine. Chinese cuisine, due to the area's proximity to the ocean and milder climate, has a wide variety of seafood and vegetables. Offshoots of Chinese food, such as Hong Kong cuisine and American Chinese cuisine, have emerged in the Chinese diaspora. China has one of the oldest sporting cultures. There is evidence that archery (shèjiàn) was practiced during the Western Zhou dynasty. Swordplay (jiànshù) and cuju, a sport loosely related to association football[576] date back to China's early dynasties as well.[577] Physical fitness is widely emphasized in Chinese culture, with morning exercises such as qigong and tai chi widely practiced,[578] and commercial gyms and private fitness clubs are gaining popularity.[579] Basketball is the most popular spectator sport in China.[580] The Chinese Basketball Association and the American National Basketball Association also have a huge national following amongst the Chinese populace, with native-born and NBA-bound Chinese players and well-known national household names such as Yao Ming and Yi Jianlian being held in high esteem.[581] China's professional football league, known as Chinese Super League, is the largest football market in East Asia.[582] Other popular sports include martial arts, table tennis, badminton, swimming and snooker. China is home to a huge number of cyclists, with an estimated 470 million bicycles as of 2012[update].[583] China has the world's largest esports market.[584] Many more traditional sports, such as dragon boat racing, Mongolian-style wrestling and horse racing are also popular.[585] China has participated in the Olympic Games since 1932, although it has only participated as the PRC since 1952. China hosted the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing, where its athletes received 48 gold medals – the highest number of any participating nation that year.[586] China also won the most medals at the 2012 Summer Paralympics, with 231 overall, including 95 gold.[587][588] In 2011, Shenzhen hosted the 2011 Summer Universiade. China hosted the 2013 East Asian Games in Tianjin and the 2014 Summer Youth Olympics in Nanjing, the first country to host both regular and Youth Olympics. Beijing and its nearby city Zhangjiakou collaboratively hosted the 2022 Winter Olympics, making Beijing the first dual Olympic city by holding both the Summer Olympics and the Winter Olympics.[589][590] China hosted the Asian Games in 1990 (Beijing), 2010 (Guangzhou), and 2023 (Hangzhou).[591] This article incorporates text from a free content work.

                "content": "It may be a new year, but the hacks, scams, and dangerous people lurking online haven’t gone anywhere. Just a day before the ball dropped, the United States Treasury Department said it had been hacked. Officials believe the attackers are an as-yet-unidentified Advanced Persistent Threat group linked to China’s government that exploited flaws in remote tech support software made by BeyondTrust to carry out what the Treasury Department described as a “major” breach. The company told the Treasury on December 8 that the attackers stole an authentication key, which ultimately allowed them to access department computers. While the Treasury says the attackers were only able to steal “certain unclassified documents,” new details have already begun to emerge, which we’ll get into more below. Before the murder of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson last month, gun silencers were mostly a thing you encountered in Hollywood films—or in Facebook and Instagram ads, if you looked closely. WIRED found that someone has run thousands of ads for “fuel filters” that are, in fact, meant to be used as gun silencers, which are heavily regulated by US law. Meta, which owns Facebook and Instagram, has since removed many of the ads, but new ones keep popping up. So if you see one, keep scrolling—owning an unregistered silencer could result in felony charges. When an Amber Alert push notification pops up on your phone, getting all the information you need to help find an abducted child can literally be a matter of life and death. That’s a lesson the California Highway Patrol learned this week when it sent out an Amber Alert that linked to a post on X, which people couldn’t access unless they were signed in. While CHP says it has linked to posts on the social network since 2018 without any issues until this week, a spokesperson tells WIRED they’re “looking into it” now. If you’ve added better privacy and security practices to your list of 2025 goals, one easy place to start is your old chat histories. You might be surprised how much sensitive information is out there, perhaps forgotten but definitely not gone. That’s not all. Each week, we round up the security and privacy news we didn’t cover in depth ourselves. Click the headlines to read the full stories. And stay safe out there. Apple this week agreed to pay $95 million to settle a class action over its Siri voice assistant’s alleged eavesdropping. The lawsuit, Lopez et al v. Apple Inc., accused Apple of recording people’s conversations without their knowledge and sharing that data with third parties to serve advertisements. The issue stemmed from Siri’s voice-activation function—”Hey, Siri”—which two plaintiffs say surreptitiously captured conversations that resulted in ads for Nike shoes and the Olive Garden. One plaintiff claimed to have been served an ad for a medical treatment after having a conversation with his doctor. People who qualify as part of the class covered by the settlement, which must be approved by a federal judge in California, could receive up to $20 per device, for as many as five devices. As Reuters points out, the settlement amount is approximately nine hours of profit for Apple, which made nearly $94 billion in the last fiscal year. The company will not admit to any wrongdoing as part of the agreement. Newly unsealed court documents revealed that the FBI allegedly discovered during a search for a single illegal firearm the “largest seizure of homemade explosives in FBI history.” According to court records, the explosives arsenal was found at the Virginia home of Brad Spafford, where investigators allegedly found more than 150 pipe bombs and other explosive devices. Prosecutors say the FBI found a backpack containing pipe bombs and adorned with a grenade-shaped patch with the hashtag #NoLivesMatter—a potential reference to a far-right extremist “accelerationist” group, The New York Times reports. While prosecutors claim that Spafford—who allegedly used a photo of US president Joe Biden for target practice—aimed to “bring back political assassinations,” his attorney contends that he is a harmless “family man” who should be granted release Following revelations earlier this week that Chinese state-backed hackers breached the US Treasury in early December, the Washington Post reported on Wednesday that the hackers specifically targeted the Office of Foreign Assets Control. The attackers may have been looking for information about the Office’s possible plans to sanction Chinese entities. Additionally, Bloomberg reported on Thursday that the attackers targeted the computers of senior Treasury officials, where they were able to access unclassified material. Thus far, investigators have reportedly identified about 100 computers compromised by the hackers. Sources told Bloomberg, though, that the attack seems to have been more of a crime of opportunity than a clandestine, long-planned operation like China’s recent infiltration of US telecom companies. As China’s Treasury hack comes into focus, the impact of its intrusions into American telecommunications firms is still widening. Two days after Christmas, Anne Neuberger, the White House deputy national security adviser for cyber and emerging technology, held a briefing with reporters in which she raised the count of telecoms breached by the Chinese hackers known as Salt Typhoon from eight to nine and suggested that at least some of the blame for those breaches lies with the companies’ own inadequate security. “The reality is that, from what we’re seeing regarding the level of cybersecurity implemented across the telecom sector, those networks are not as defensible as they need to be to defend against a well-resourced, capable offensive cyber actor like China,” Neuberger said. She added that the hackers had targeted the communications histories of fewer than 100 people—mostly in Washington, DC, reportedly including president-elect Donald Trump and vice president-elect JD Vance. Neuberger said that the espionage incident calls for new Federal Communications Commission cybersecurity regulations that she says might have limited the scope of the breaches had they been in place. Cars collect and transmit as much sensitive location data as any modern digital device, and the privacy pitfalls of all that tracking are becoming all too clear. Case in point: A whistleblower warned Germany’s Chaos Computer Club and the country’s Der Spiegel news outlet that Cariad, a subsidiary of Volkswagen, left exposed online a trove of 800,000 electric vehicles’ location data. The leak included cars sold by not only Volkswagen but also other brands, including Seats, Audi, and Skoda. For Audi and Skoda, that location data was accurate only to within about six miles, but Volkswagen and Seats cars could be located to within about four inches. The exposed data has since been secured, but the incident nonetheless demonstrates how far carmakers have yet to go to rein in their data collection.

                "title": "La Liga - Wikipedia",
                "content": "The Campeonato Nacional de Liga de Primera División,[a] commonly known as the Primera División[b] or La Liga[c][2] and officially known as LaLiga EA Sports[d][3] since 2023 because of sponsorship reasons, is the top men's professional football division of the Spanish football league system. It is controlled by the Liga Nacional de Fútbol Profesional and it is contested by 20 teams over a 38-matchday period. Since its inception, 62 teams have competed in La Liga. Nine teams have been crowned champions, with Barcelona winning the inaugural La Liga and Real Madrid winning the title a record 36 times. Real Madrid are also the most recent winners, having won the 2023–24 edition. During the 1940s Valencia, Atlético Madrid and Barcelona emerged as the strongest clubs, winning several titles. Real Madrid and Barcelona dominated the championship in the 1950s, each winning four La Liga titles during the decade. During the 1960s and 1970s, Real Madrid dominated La Liga, winning fourteen titles, with Atlético Madrid winning four.[4] During the 1980s and 1990s Real Madrid were prominent in La Liga, but the Basque clubs of Athletic Bilbao and Real Sociedad had their share of success, each winning two Liga titles. From the 1990s onward, Barcelona has dominated La Liga, winning seventeen titles to date.[5] Although Real Madrid has also been prominent, winning eleven titles, La Liga has also seen other champions, including Valencia and Deportivo La Coruña. According to UEFA's league coefficient rankings, La Liga was the top league in Europe in each of the seven years from 2013 to 2019 (calculated using accumulated figures from five preceding seasons) and led Europe for 22 of the 60 ranked years up to 2019, more than any other country. It also has produced the continent's top-rated club more times (22) than any other league in that period, more than double that of second-placed Serie A (Italy), including the top club in 10 of the 11 seasons between 2009 and 2019; each of these pinnacles was achieved by either Barcelona or Real Madrid. La Liga clubs have won the most UEFA Champions League (20), UEFA Europa League (14), UEFA Super Cup (16) and FIFA Club World Cup (8) titles, and its players have accumulated the highest number of Ballon d'Or awards (24), The Best FIFA Men's Player awards (19)[e] and UEFA Men's Player of the Year awards (12).[f] La Liga is one of the most popular professional sports leagues globally, with an average attendance of 26,933 for league matches in the 2018–19 season.[6] This is the eighth-highest of any domestic professional sports league in the world and the third-highest of any professional association football league in the world, behind fellow big five leagues Bundesliga and Premier League, and above Serie A and Ligue 1.[7][8] La Liga is also the seventh wealthiest professional sports league in the world by revenue, after the NFL, MLB, the NBA, the Premier League, the NHL, and the Bundesliga.[9] From 2008 to 2016, it was sponsored by Banco Bilbao Vizcaya Argentaria and known as Liga BBVA. Then, from 2016 to 2023, it was sponsored by Banco Santander and known as LaLiga Santander. Since 2023, it has been sponsored by Electronic Arts and is known as LaLiga EA Sports. The competition format follows the usual double round-robin format. During the course of a season, which lasts from August to May, each club plays every other club twice, once at home and once away, for 38 matches. Teams receive three points for a win, one point for a draw, and no points for a loss. Teams are ranked by total points, with the highest-ranked club crowned champion at the end of the season. A system of promotion and relegation exists between the Primera División and the Segunda División. The three lowest placed teams in La Liga are relegated to the Segunda División, and the top two teams from the Segunda División promoted to La Liga, with an additional club promoted after a series of play-offs involving the third, fourth, fifth and sixth placed clubs. Below is a complete record of how many teams played in each season throughout the league's history; If points are equal between two or more clubs, the rules are:[10] The top four teams in La Liga qualify for the subsequent season's UEFA Champions League group stage. The winners of the UEFA Champions League and UEFA Europa League also qualify for the subsequent season's UEFA Champions League group stage. The fifth place team in La Liga and the winner of the Copa del Rey also qualify for the subsequent season's UEFA Europa League group stage. However, if the winner also finished in the top five places in La Liga, then this place reverts to the team that finished sixth in La Liga. Furthermore, the sixth place (or seventh if sixth already qualifies due to the Copa del Rey) team qualifies for the subsequent season's UEFA Conference League play-off round.[12] The number of places allocated to Spanish clubs in UEFA competitions is dependent upon the position a country holds in the UEFA country coefficients, which are calculated based upon the performance of teams in UEFA competitions in the previous five years. As of the end of the 2023–24 season, the ranking of Spain (and de facto La Liga) is second.[13] In April 1928, José María Acha, a director at Arenas de Getxo, first proposed the idea of a national league in Spain. After much debate about the size of the league and who would take part, the Real Federación Española de Fútbol eventually agreed on the ten teams who would form the first Primera División in 1929. Arenas, Barcelona, Real Madrid, Athletic Bilbao, Real Sociedad and Real Unión were all selected as previous winners of the Copa del Rey. Atlético Madrid, Espanyol and Europa qualified as Copa del Rey runners-up and Racing de Santander qualified through a knockout competition. Only three of the founding clubs (Real Madrid, Barcelona, and Athletic Bilbao) have never been relegated from the Primera División. Although Barcelona won the first Liga in 1929 and Ricardo Zamora's Real Madrid won their first titles in 1932 and 1933, it was Athletic Bilbao that set the early pace winning La Liga in 1930, 1931, 1934 and 1936 (in addition to four Copa trophies), and they also achieved the biggest win in La Liga history by beating Barcelona 12-1; This team, coached by Fred Pentland, is known by the nickname First historic squad, notably forming an attacking partnership with Bata, Guillermo Gorostiza, José Iraragorri, Chirri II and Lafuente. In 1935, Real Betis, then known as Betis Balompié, won their only title to date. Primera División was suspended during the Spanish Civil War. In 1937, the teams in the Republican area of Spain, with the notable exception of the two Madrid clubs, competed in the Mediterranean League and Barcelona emerged as champions. Seventy years later, on 28 September 2007, Barcelona requested the Royal Spanish Football Federation (Spanish acronym RFEF) to recognise that title as a Liga title. This action was taken after RFEF was asked to recognise Levante's Copa de la España Libre win as equivalent to Copa del Rey trophy. Nevertheless, the governing body of Spanish football has not made an outright decision yet. When the Primera División resumed after the Spanish Civil War, it was Atlético Aviación (nowadays Atlético Madrid), Valencia, and Barcelona that emerged as the strongest clubs. Atlético were only awarded a place during the 1939–40 season as a replacement for Real Oviedo, whose ground had been damaged during the war. The club subsequently won its first Liga title and retained it in 1941. While other clubs lost players to exile, execution, and as casualties of the war, the Atlético team was reinforced by a merger. The young, pre-war squad of Valencia had also remained intact and in the post-war years matured into champions, gaining three Liga titles in 1942, 1944, and 1947. They were also runners-up in 1948 and 1949. Athletic Bilbao was one of the clubs most affected by the war, since many of its players (sympathizers of the Republican faction) went into exile in Latin America and very few returned. But thanks to a search for young talents, they managed to form the well-known Second historic squad made up of Rafael Iriondo, Venancio Pérez, José Luis Panizo, Agustín Gaínza and the mythical scorer Telmo Zarra (Spanish top scorer in La Liga history, among other records). They won a La Liga and Copa del Generalísimo double in 1943 and won the Cup again in 1944, 1945 and 1950, in addition to an Copa Eva Duarte (official predecessor of the Supercopa). Sevilla also enjoyed a brief golden era, finishing as runners-up in 1940 and 1942 before winning their only title to date in 1946. Meanwhile, on the other side of Spain, Barcelona began to emerge as a force under the legendary Josep Samitier. A Spanish footballer for both Barcelona and Real Madrid, Samitier cemented his legacy with Barcelona. During his playing career with Barcelona he scored 133 goals, won the inaugural La Liga title and five Copa Del Rey. In 1944, Samitier returned to Barcelona as a coach and guided them in winning their second La Liga title in 1945. Under Samitier and legendary players César Rodríguez, Josep Escolà, Estanislau Basora and Mariano Gonzalvo, Barcelona dominated La Liga in the late 1940s,[14] winning back to back La Liga titles in 1948 and 1949. The 1940s proved to be a successful season for Barcelona, winning three La Liga titles and one Copa Del Rey, but the 1950s proved to be a decade of dominance, not just from Barcelona, but from Real Madrid. Although Atlético Madrid, previously known as ''Atlético Aviación'', were champions in 1950 and 1951 under mastermind Helenio Herrera, the 1950s continued the success FC Barcelona had during the late 1940s. During this decade, FC Barcelona's first golden era emerged under coach Ferdinand Daučík, winning back-to-back La Liga and Copa Del Rey doubles in 1951–52 and 1952–53. In 1952, FC Barcelona made history yet again by winning five distinctive trophies in one year. This team, composed of László Kubala, Mariano Gonzalvo, César Rodríguez Álvarez, and Joan Segarra, won La Liga, Copa Del Rey, Copa Eva Duarte (predecessor of Spanish Super Cup), Latin Cup and Copa Martini & Rossi. Their success in winning five trophies in one year earned them the name 'L’equip de les cinc Copes'[15] or The Team of the Five Cups. In the latter parts of the 1950s, coached by Helenio Herrera and featuring Luis Suárez, Barcelona won yet again back-to-back La Liga's, winning them in 1959 and 1960. In 1959, Barcelona also won another double of La Liga / Copa Del Rey, conquering three doubles in the 1950s. The 1950s also saw the beginning of the Real Madrid dominance. During the 1930s through the 1950s there were strict limits imposed on foreign players. In most cases, clubs could have only three foreign players in their squads, meaning that at least eight local players had to play in every game. During the 1950s, however, these rules were circumvented by Real Madrid who naturalised Alfredo Di Stéfano and Ferenc Puskás.[citation needed] Di Stéfano, Puskás, Raymond Kopa and Francisco Gento formed the nucleus of the Real Madrid team that dominated the second half of the 1950s. Real Madrid won their third La Liga in 1954 — their first since 1933 — and retained their title in 1955. In 1956, Athletic Bilbao won their sixth La Liga title, but Real Madrid won La Liga again in 1957 and 1958. All in all, Barcelona and Real Madrid won four La Liga titles each in the 1950s, with Atlético Madrid winning two and Athletic Bilbao winning one during this decade. Real Madrid dominated La Liga between 1960 and 1980, being crowned champions 14 times.[16] Real Madrid won five La Liga titles in a row from 1961 to 1965 as well as winning three doubles between 1960 and 1980. During the 1960s and 1970s, only Atlético Madrid offered Real Madrid any serious challenge. Atlético Madrid were crowned La Liga champions four times in 1966, 1970, 1973, and 1977. Atlético Madrid also finished second place in 1961, 1963, and 1965. In 1971, Valencia won their fourth La Liga title in 1971 under Alfredo Di Stéfano, and the Johan Cruyff-inspired Barcelona won their ninth La Liga in 1974. Real Madrid's monopoly in La Liga was interrupted significantly in the 1980s. Although Real Madrid won another five La Liga titles from 1986 to 1990[17] under the brilliance of Emilio Butragueño and Hugo Sánchez, the Basque clubs of Real Sociedad and Athletic Bilbao also dominated the 1980s.[18] Real Sociedad won their first La Liga titles in 1981 and 1982; Luis Arconada, Roberto López Ufarte and Txiki Begiristain stood out from this team. Later, Athletic Bilbao also managed to win two consecutive La Liga titles in 1983 and 1984, also achieving their fifth La Liga and Copa del Rey double in 1984; The stars Andoni Zubizarreta, Santi Urkiaga, Andoni Goikoetxea, Dani, Manuel Sarabia and Estanislao Argote made this success possible. For its part, Barcelona won their tenth La Liga title in 1985 under coach Terry Venables, their first La Liga win since 1974. Johan Cruyff returned to Barcelona as manager in 1988, and assembled the legendary Dream Team.[19] When Cruyff took control of his Barcelona side, they had won only two La Liga titles in the past 20 years. Cruyff decided to build a team composed of international stars and La Masia graduates in order to restore Barcelona to their former glory days. This team was formed by international stars Romario, Michael Laudrup, Hristo Stoichkov and Ronald Koeman. Cruyff's Dream Team also consisted of La Masia graduates Pep Guardiola, Albert Ferrer and Guillermo Amor, as well as Basque Andoni Zubizarreta. Johan Cruyff changed the way modern football was played,[20] and incorporated the principles of Total Football into this team. The success of possession-based football was revolutionary,[21] and Cruyff's team won their first European Cup in 1992 and four consecutive La Liga titles between 1991 and 1994. In total, Cruyff won eleven trophies in eight years, making him the most successful manager in Barcelona's history, until the record was broken by his protégé Pep Guardiola two decades later. Barcelona's run ended with Real Madrid winning La Liga in 1995. Atlético Madrid won their ninth La Liga title in 1996, as well as their only Liga/Copa Del Rey double, before Real Madrid added another league title to their cabinet in 1997. After the success of Cruyff, another Dutchman – Ajax manager, Louis van Gaal – arrived at the Camp Nou, and with the talents of Luís Figo, Luis Enrique, and Rivaldo, Barcelona won the La Liga title in 1998 and 1999, including their fourth double of Liga and Copa Del Rey in 1998. All in all, Barcelona won six La Liga titles in the 1990s. The 21st century continued the success Barcelona had in the 1990s under Johan Cruyff, dominating La Liga. Although Real Madrid had been prominent, Barcelona created a hegemony in Spain not seen since the Real Madrid of the 1960s–70s.[22] Since the start of the new century, Barcelona won ten La Ligas, including two trebles and four doubles. This new century however has also seen new challengers being crowned champions. Between 1999–2000 and 2004, Deportivo La Coruña finished in the top three on five occasions, a better record than either Real Madrid or Barcelona, and in 2000, under Javier Irureta, Deportivo became the ninth team to be crowned champions. Valencia were one of the strongest teams in Europe in the early to mid 2000s; they were crowned La Liga champions in 2002 and 2004 under Rafael Benítez, whilst also being runners-up in the UEFA Champions League in 2000 and 2001 under Hector Cuper and winning the UEFA Cup in 2004 and the Copa del Rey in 1999. Real Madrid won their first Liga titles of the century in 2001 and 2003. With world-class players like Raúl, Ruud van Nistelrooy and Gonzalo Higuaín, Real Madrid won back-to-back La Liga titles in 2006–07 and 2007–08. Barcelona won their first title of the new century after Real Madrid and Valencia had shared the last four titles under the brilliance of Ronaldinho and Samuel Eto'o in the 2004–05 season. Barcelona retained the title to make it back-to-back wins in the 2005–06 season. In 2009–10, Real Madrid achieved a record 96 points but still finished behind Barcelona, who amassed 99 points. Barcelona then won a third straight La Liga title in the 2010–11 season with 96 points to Real's 92, but Real Madrid ended their winning streak in the 2011–12 season under the management of José Mourinho and with the likes of Cristiano Ronaldo, Ángel Di María, Mesut Özil and Karim Benzema. Madrid won their 32nd La Liga title with a record 100 points, a record 121 goals scored and a record +89 goal difference. The following year, in the 2012–13 season, Barcelona won yet another La Liga title under coach Tito Vilanova, replicating the 100 points record Real Madrid achieved the previous year. Atlético Madrid, under the management of Diego Simeone, won their tenth La Liga title in 2013–14, their first since 1996. They became the first team since Valencia in 2004 to win La Liga and break Barcelona and Real Madrid's dominion over the league.[23] In the 2014–15 season, under the trio of Messi, Neymar, and Suarez nicknamed 'MSN', Barcelona made history by becoming the first team to achieve a second Treble, and winning a sixth Liga/Copa Del Rey double. Barcelona continued their dominance, and in the 2015–16 season they won a back-to-back Liga/Copa Del Rey double, something that had not been achieved since the 1950s.[24] Real Madrid brought back the La Liga title under the management of Zinedine Zidane in 2016–17, but Barcelona won the title again in the 2017–18 season, as well as winning their eighth double,[25] for seven La Liga titles in ten years. Barcelona retained the title yet again and won their 26th La Liga title in the 2018–19 season, for eight La Liga titles in eleven years.[26] Real Madrid reclaimed the title in 2019–20, winning the season that was severely disrupted by the COVID-19 pandemic.[27] The 2020–21 season started on 12 September, and was won by Atletico Madrid, with Real Madrid as runners-up.[28] In August 2021, La Liga clubs approved a €2.7 billion deal to sell 10% of the league to CVC Capital Partners.[29] The 2021–22 season was won by Real Madrid with four games to spare,[30] while the 2022–23 season was won by Barcelona with four games to spare. In 2023, La Liga rebranded itself with a new logo and new sponsor. EA (Electronic Arts) replaced the Spanish financial services giant Santander that was the title sponsor of the league for seven years. LaLiga EA Sports and LaLiga Hypermotion are the names of the Primera and Segunda Divisions, starting in the 2023-24 season and for the following four seasons.[31] Following the flash floods disaster that hit Spain at the end of October, claiming the lives of over 200 people, the Spanish league postponed all matches scheduled to be played in the Valencian region on Thursday. The games played after the floods opened in a moment of silence.[32] 20 teams already contest the league in its current season, including the top 17 sides from the 2023–24 season and three promoted from the 2023–24 Segunda División. Leganés and Real Valladolid were promoted directly, and Espanyol won the promotion play-off. The Primera División is currently third in the UEFA rankings of European leagues based on their performances in European competitions over a five-year period, behind England's Premier League and Italy's Serie A, but ahead of Germany's Bundesliga and France's Ligue 1. Real Madrid, Barcelona and Atlético Madrid have been in the top ten most successful clubs in European football in terms of total European trophies. These three clubs, along with Sevilla and Valencia, are the only Spanish clubs to have won five or more international trophies. Deportivo La Coruña are the joint fifth-most participating Spanish team in the Champions League with Sevilla — after Real Madrid, Barcelona, Valencia and Atlético Madrid — with five consecutive Champions League appearances, including a semi-finals appearance in 2003–04.[33] During the 2005–06 European season, La Liga became the first league to have its clubs win both the Champions League and UEFA Cup since 1997, as Barcelona won the UEFA Champions League and Sevilla won the UEFA Cup. This feat was repeated four times in five seasons: during the 2013–14 season Real Madrid won their tenth Champions League title and Sevilla won their third Europa League, during the 2014–15 season Barcelona won their fifth Champions League title and Sevilla won their fourth Europa League, during the 2015–16 season Real Madrid won their eleventh Champions League title and Sevilla won their fifth Europa League (becoming the first team to win the title three times in a row), and during the 2017–18 season Real Madrid won their thirteenth Champions League title and Atlético Madrid won their third Europa League. In 2015, La Liga became the first league to enter five teams in the Champions League group stage, with Barcelona, Real Madrid, Atlético Madrid and Valencia qualifying via their league position and Sevilla qualifying by virtue of their victory in the Europa League, courtesy of a rule change. In La Liga in 2020, each club is allowed five non-EU players but are only allowed to name three non-EU players in each matchday squad.[34] Players can claim citizenship from the nation their ancestors came from. If a player does not have European ancestry, he can claim Spanish citizenship after playing in Spain for five years. Sometimes, this can lead to a triple-citizenship situation; for example, Leo Franco, who was born in Argentina, is of Italian heritage yet can claim a Spanish passport, having played in La Liga for over five years. In addition, players from the ACP countries—countries in Africa, the Caribbean, and the Pacific that are signatories to the Cotonou Agreement—are not counted against non-EU quotas due to the Kolpak ruling. Until the 2008–09 season, no official individual awards existed in La Liga. In the 2008–09 season, the governing body created the LFP Awards (now called La Liga Awards), awarded each season to individual players and coaches. The majority of these awards were discontinued after the 2015–16 season.[35] Additional awards relating to La Liga are distributed, some not sanctioned by the Liga de Futbol Profesional or RFEF and therefore not regarded as official. The most notable of these are four awarded by Spain's largest sports paper, Marca, namely the Pichichi Trophy, awarded to the top scorer of the season; the Ricardo Zamora Trophy, for the goalkeeper with the fewest goals allowed per game (minimum 28 games); the Alfredo Di Stéfano Trophy, for the player judged to be the best overall player in the division; and the Zarra Trophy, for the top scorer among Spanish domestic players. Since the 2013–14 season, La Liga has also bestowed the monthly manager of the month and player of the month awards. The first La Liga player to be involved in a transfer which broke the world record was Luis Suárez in 1961, who moved from Barcelona to Inter Milan for £152,000 (£4.3 million in 2023). 12 years later, Johan Cruyff was the first player to join a club in La Liga for a record fee of £922,000 (£14.1 million in 2023), when he moved from Ajax to Barcelona. In 1982, Barcelona again set the record by signing Diego Maradona from Boca Juniors for £5 million (£22 million in 2023).[36] Real Betis set the world record in 1998 when they signed Denílson from São Paulo for £21.5 million (£47.8 million in 2023).[37] Four of the last six world transfer records have been set by Real Madrid, signing Luís Figo,[38] Zinedine Zidane,[39] Cristiano Ronaldo[40] (plus a deal for Kaká days before Ronaldo[41] which fell just below a world record due to the way the fee was calculated)[42] and finally Gareth Bale, who was bought in 2013 for £85.3m (€103.4m or $140m at the time; £123.5m in 2023) from Tottenham Hotspur.[43] Brazilian forward Neymar was the subject of an expensive and complicated transfer arrangement when he joined Barcelona from Santos in 2013,[44][45] and his outgoing transfer to Paris Saint-Germain in 2017 set a new world record fee at €222m via his buyout clause.[46] Barcelona soon invested a large amount of the money received from this transfer in a replacement, Ousmane Dembélé, whose deal – €105m – was the second most expensive ever before Philippe Coutinho's transfer to Barcelona for €142m in January 2018.[47][48][49] Boldface indicates a player still active in La Liga.

Presidents Honours Press Releases Logos Image Gallery Institutional Calendar Documents Newsletter Contact Pressroom What is LALIGA? Presidents Honours Press Releases Logos Image Gallery Institutional Calendar Documents Newsletter Contact LALIGA is a global, innovative and socially responsible organisation, a leader in the leisure and entertainment sector. It is a private sports association composed of the 20 clubs and SADs (public limited sports companies) in LALIGA EA SPORTS and the 22 in LALIGA HYPERMOTION, responsible for the organisation of these national professional football competitions. With headquarters in Madrid (Spain), it is present in 41 countries through its 13 offices and 44 delegates. In the 2019/2020 season, LALIGA reached more than 2.8 billion people globally. The association carries out its social action through its Foundation and is the world's first pro essional football league with a league for intellectually challenged footballers: LALIGA Genuine. Since 2013 and Javier Tebas's appointment as president, LALIGA has embarked on a journey of growth and constant evolution based on financial controls, the centralised sale of audiovisual rights and a strategy of internationalisation and technological leadership. All of this has made the institution a role model within the sector and one of the best professional leagues within the world of sport, which is serving to attract the interest of new generations. In 2013, the debts held by the LALIGA clubs and SADs with the Spanish tax authorities (Hacienda) stood at €650 million and, two years prior to this, the number of complaints brought by players over non-payment of wages amounted to 341 and involved a total of €84m. The impact that the financial controls have had on the LALIGA clubs and SADs can be summarised as follows: All of this makes LALIGA more solvent, attractive and stronger, with this growth reflected in player salaries, which serves to improve the competitive level across the competition. In 2021, LALIGA’s Assembly approved the strategic agreement with investment fund CVC Capital Partners, in order to boost the global growth of LALIGA and its clubs. This is an ambitious investment plan that will provide LALIGA and its clubs resources that can continue the process of transformation, making this a global organisation of digital entertainment, strengthening the competition and enhancing the experience of fans. With this partnership, in which CVC valued LALIGA at €24,250 million, LALIGA will retain its sports responsibilities as well as the organisation and management of the marketing of the audiovisual rights. The participating clubs should use the funds in the following way: 70% for infrastructure, 15% for the restructuring of financial debt and 15% for the registration of players. LALIGA is responsible for the joint marketing of the audiovisual rights on behalf of the LALIGA EA SPORTS and LALIGA HYPERMOTION clubs and SADs. The audiovisual rights, which are valued at close to €2 billion per season in the current audiovisual cycle, represent the clubs' main source of revenue, exceeding 60% of revenue for the majority of clubs. The Royal Decree-Law 5/2015 establishes the criteria for the distribution of broadcasting revenue obtained from the joint exploitation and marketing of the audiovisual rights. Foreign interest in the Spanish game has grown exponentially in recent years. LALIGA works on a daily basis to promote Spanish football beyond the country's borders, with the objective of creating a community of fans throughout the world. LALIGA's global expansion is underpinned by the following three cornerstones: its international offices, the network of LALIGA Global Network delegates and the joint ventures it is working on in different areas of the world. LALIGA's international offices are located in: Meanwhile, the LALIGA Global Network delegates are based in destinations across the five continents. LALIGA is actively engaged in three strategic joint-venture partnerships: LALIGA's internationalisation efforts saw the institution named the Honorary Ambassador of Brand Spain in the international relations category in 2019, \"on account of its contribution to offering a positive image of Spain across the world through football\" and \"assisting the internationalisation of both Spanish companies and athletes.\" Innovation and technology currently represent one of the cornerstones of LALIGA's medium- and long-term growth. The clubs' association boasts a digital ecosystem that combines channels, services and data. The combination of these elements provides LALIGA with a complete overview, which the organisation uses to improve its audiovisual product for the benefit of supporters, sponsors, broadcasters and, of course, the clubs. LALIGA Tech is a subsidiary that brings together the technological solutions developed by LALIGA and that makes them available commercially to third parties, thereby generating a new line of business for the clubs/SADs. These digital tools have been worked on since 2013 by LALIGA, as the organisation looked for solutions to its particular needs. Now, through LALIGA Tech, these services are supplied to the entire sports and entertainment industry, with clients including World Padel Tour, Dorna Sports, Jupiler Pro League and Sky Mexico. One of the keys behind this project is the Business Intelligence & Analytics department, that has become the main axis of innovation at LALIGA thanks to a transformation process that made the organisation one built around data. The objective is to centralise, organise, prepare and provide all the necessary information in order for decisions to be made based on data and carried out efficiently. The following are examples of these technological tools, which help with decision-making and with daily tasks: One of LALIGA's priorities is the fight against sporting corruption and the promotion of good practice within football. The institution works on the following aspects in this field: Talks are delivered to all players and professionals at the LALIGA clubs, including the reserve teams, about integrity and the legal and administrative consequences of any possible involvement in match-fixing. Football matches across Spanish football are monitored on a 24/7 basis. LALIGA has developed Tyche 3.0, software that monitors and analyses global betting activity relating to Spanish football, for this purpose. The program uses machine learning algorithms to enable possible cases of match-fixing to be identified more quickly and in a more objective and effective manner. LALIGA is a member of the National Commission against the manipulation of sporting competitions and betting-related fraud, a body where it is joined by the following organisations: the General Directorate for the Regulation of Gaming, the National Police, the Civil Guard, the Spanish Football Federation (RFEF) and online gaming operators. Another of LALIGA's main objectives concerns the battle against violence in and around football stadiums. To achieve this objective, LALIGA coordinates and collaborates with those responsible for security within the clubs and is a member of the National Commission against violence, racism, xenophobia and intolerance in sport and works very closely with the National Sports Office and the State Law Enforcement Agencies. LALIGA submits a weekly report to the RFEF's Competition Committee and the Anti-violence Committee with information regarding chants heard during matches that incite violence or feature content that is insulting or displays an attitude of intolerance. LALIGA is aware of the impact and influence that football has within society and, as such, pursues a strategic aim that sees the organisation lead ethical, social and environmental initiatives under the umbrella of Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR). LALIGA carries out its social outreach work through its Foundation, which was founded in 1993 and is a pioneer in the world of professional football. The LALIGA FOUNDATION's projects pursue the objective of transforming society through positive footballing values, such as integrity, hard work, self-improvement, collaboration and teamwork. The LALIGA FOUNDATION's activities can be divided up into the following three main categories: Amongst the various projects led by the LALIGA FOUNDATION, the following are of particular note: In October 2015, LALIGA decided to become actively involved in promoting and developing the female game and opened a women's football department to lead, along with the clubs, several strategies and initiatives targeted at enhancing and professionalising the competition, generating value, maximising visibility and promoting the international growth of its clubs and players. The LALIGA Business School, founded and run by LALIGA in conjunction with the Universidad Francisco de Vitoria, is a project that galvanizes LALIGA's commitment to education and which aims to train talent with a view to professionalising the sports industry. The school's five programmes, taught by LALIGA professionals, representatives from its member clubs and industry experts, are as follows: The school also offers various specialist courses, both in Spain and other countries throughout the world. In addition to its real-life football competition, in the 2017/18 season, LALIGA decided to enter the world of e-Sports. The 2019/20 edition of LALIGA FC PRO, the official EA SPORTS TM FIFA 20 Global Series competition in Spain, involved the participation of 34 LALIGA EA SPORTS and LALIGA HYPERMOTION clubs. LALIGA has also developed a number of apps and virtual games: LALIGA Grassroots is an initiative through which LALIGA brings together the organisation’s know-how, experience and youth football projects, doing so through the Sporting Projects department. It was launched in 2015 and is pioneering among the major European leagues, with a global network of academies and schools focused on developing international talent via the LALIGA methodology. Working with the Business and International Development department, LALIGA Grassroots runs different initiatives that provide a holistic development of young players, that offer international training programmes for industry professionals and that support LALIGA clubs with their academies and in organising international tournaments. All of this work culminated with the launch during the 2021/22 season of new LALIGA Grassroots programmes in Spain, thanks to integration with this new business unit and thanks to the construction of the state-of-the-art Centro ESC Madrid, a sporting complex that can host LALIGA’s most innovative programmes yet. LALIGA Entertainment is a joint venture between LALIGA, PortAventura World and Kosmos. This is a global entertainment company that exists in the videogame and theme parks industry. To begin with, there are two innovative assets: The Beat Challenge, an interactive videogame that uses augmented reality technology, and LALIGA TwentyNine’s PortAventura World, a revolutionary sportsbar concept that integrates with the videogame itself.

                "content": "Charles Alfred Morton IV[1] (born November 12, 1983) is an American professional baseball pitcher for the Baltimore Orioles of Major League Baseball (MLB). He has played in MLB for the Atlanta Braves, Pittsburgh Pirates, Philadelphia Phillies, Houston Astros, and Tampa Bay Rays. The Braves selected Morton in the third round of the 2002 MLB draft and he made his MLB debut with them in 2008. Morton was a World Series champion in 2017 and 2021 and an All-Star in 2018 and 2019. Morton is the active pitcher with the most career batters hit by pitch with 180. Morton was born in Flemington, New Jersey, to Jeanne and Chip Morton, an accountant and former Penn State basketball player. His grandfather played in the Philadelphia Athletics farm system.[2] He was raised in Trumbull, Connecticut, playing little league baseball with future major leaguers pitcher Craig Breslow and infielder Jamie D'Antona.[3] Morton grew up attending ballgames at Yankee Stadium and idolizing Derek Jeter and Roger Clemens.[4] He attended Joel Barlow High School in Redding, Connecticut, graduating in 2002. The Atlanta Braves selected Morton in the third round with the 95th overall selection of the 2002 Major League Baseball draft. He started his professional career in 2002 with the GCL Braves, and was 1–7. In 2003, he played for the Danville Braves, and was 2–5. He spent the 2004 and 2005 seasons with the Rome Braves. In 2006, he pitched for the Myrtle Beach Pelicans, and was 6–7. In 2007, he pitched for the Mississippi Braves, and was 4–6.[5] The Braves added Morton to their 40-man roster on November 20, 2007.[6] Morton made his major league debut on June 14, 2008, against the Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim, allowing three runs in six innings and earning his first major league win.[7][8] In 2008 he was 4–8 with a 6.15 ERA.[5] On June 3, 2009, the Braves traded Morton with Gorkys Hernández and Jeff Locke to the Pittsburgh Pirates in exchange for Nate McLouth.[9] He made his first start with the Pirates on June 10 pitching an inning against the Atlanta Braves, while Jeff Karstens got the win. On June 28, he received his first decision, a loss to the Kansas City Royals. On July 3, 2009, he won his first game pitching 6 innings of 1 hit baseball against the Florida Marlins. On September 30, 2009, he pitched a complete game 4 hitter with 8 strikeouts against the Chicago Cubs. His 2009 record in 18 starts was 5 wins and 9 losses, a 4.55 ERA, 97 innings pitched and 62 strikeouts, 40 walks, 7 home runs, 5 hit batsmen, .276 average against, and a 1.46 WHIP.[5] Morton began 2010 spring training as a member of the Pirates' starting rotation. He struggled losing all five starts in April and finishing the month with a 12.57 earned run average (ERA). However, Morton delivered a promising performance on April 30, 2010, against the Los Angeles Dodgers, striking out 8 in six innings of work while allowing six runs (only three earned). In that game, he was dealt a loss as the Pirates only provided him with two runs of support. He earned his first win of the season on May 5 against the Chicago Cubs striking out three in a 4–2 decision. However, he lost each of his next four starts, dropping his record on the season to 1–9 with a 9.35 ERA. A day after suffering his 9th loss against the Cincinnati Reds, the Pirates placed him on the 15-day disabled list with shoulder fatigue. After recovering, he was assigned to the Pirates Triple-A affiliate Indianapolis Indians. Speaking before his first start with the Indians, Morton said \"I was pressing. I wasn't being myself on the mound those last couple of times I went out there in Pittsburgh. There was so much going on in my mind. At the end of last year, I finished strong, I got a glimpse of what I could do, truly, in the big leagues, going out there and going deep into games, being competitive, and being someone who was pretty good. I wanted to be out there for myself and because I care about this team and organization. At the same time, though, after that last one, that last start, because I care about these guys is why, exactly, I knew I couldn't go back out there again.\"[10] Morton was recalled when starter Ross Ohlendorf was placed on the 15-day disabled list due to a shoulder injury. On his final start of the 2010 season, Morton compiled his finest pitching performance of the year striking out a career-high nine batters in a 2–0 loss to the Florida Marlins on October 2. He finished the season with a 2–12 record and a 7.57 ERA, but in his final six starts of the season after being recalled in late August he sported a 4.26 ERA. 2011 was Morton's best season yet, where he held a 10–10 record in 29 starts with a 3.83 ERA, earning the club's Breakout Player of the Year.[11] On April 15, Morton threw a complete game against the Cincinnati Reds. On May 18, again at Great American Ball Park, Morton threw a complete game shutout, striking out 5 and giving up 5 hits.[12] Following the season, Morton underwent successful hip surgery to repair a torn labrum in October 2011 with a full recovery expected in 4–6 months. He was optimistic about returning before Opening Day.[13] However, he began the 2012 season on the disabled list, making his season debut on April 14. His season ended when he underwent Tommy John surgery on June 14, 2012.[14] On June 13, 2013, Morton was activated off the DL. He picked up his first win of the season on June 18 in a shutout against the Cincinnati Reds. He pitched 5+1⁄3 innings giving up only 3 hits and no runs, while striking out 2. On July 22 and 27, he won back-to-back games for the first time since May 7 and 18, 2011. On December 11, 2013, Morton signed a three-year contract to remain with the Pirates, with a club option for the 2017 season.[15] Morton was placed on the DL with right hip inflammation on August 17, 2014. At the time, he was 5–12 with a 3.84 ERA.[16] During September, Morton needed hip surgery, effectively ending his 2014 season. In 26 starts in 2014, Morton hit 19 batsmen with pitches, which led the Majors along with a 6–12 record and a 3.72 ERA. During the 2015 spring training, Morton struggled thoroughly and began to experience inflammation in his recently surgically repaired hip. On April 5, 2015, the Pirates placed Morton on the 15-day disabled list. On December 12, 2015, the Pirates traded Morton to the Philadelphia Phillies in exchange for David Whitehead.[17] His season came to an abrupt end on April 23, 2016, when Morton suffered a hamstring injury running to first base in a game against the Milwaukee Brewers and was placed on the disabled list the next day.[18] On April 27, the Phillies announced Morton would miss the rest of the 2016 season with a torn hamstring.[19] On November 16, 2016, Morton signed a two-year, $14 million contract with the Houston Astros.[20] During the 2017 regular season, Morton made 25 starts, compiling a 14–7 record with a 3.62 ERA. He pitched 146+2⁄3 innings and recorded 163 strikeouts. Morton started Game 3 of the American League Championship Series (ALCS) at Yankee Stadium. He lost the game, giving up 7 runs in 3+2⁄3 innings.[21] On October 21, he won Game 7 of the ALCS at Minute Maid Park, pitching five shutout innings with five strikeouts, sending the Astros to the World Series.[22] Morton started Game 4 of the World Series and pitched well over 6.1 innings giving up one earned run on 3 hits and 7 strikeouts in an eventual Astros loss. Morton pitched the final four innings in Game 7 of the World Series. He was credited as the winning pitcher helping the Astros win their first World Series title.[23] Three years later, it was revealed in the Houston Astros sign stealing scandal that the team had broken MLB rules during the 2017 season. Morton admitted he knew about the team's cheating and expressed regret that he did not do anything to stop it.[24] In 2018, Morton continued his successful stint with the Astros. On May 12, he set a personal record of 14 strikeouts over seven innings in a 6–1 victory against the Texas Rangers.[25] Entering the All-Star break third in the American League with 11 wins, 11.7 strikeouts per nine innings, and ninth in ERA (2.96), Morton was added to the AL roster for the 2018 MLB All-Star Game.[26] Morton avoided serious injury in 2018, with only a short trip to the 10-day DL for shoulder discomfort. He pitched 167 innings, second only to his 2011 high of 171.2. Morton finished the regular season with a 3.13 ERA, a 15–3 win–loss record, and 201 strikeouts, all constituting career highs.[27] On December 21, 2018, the Tampa Bay Rays signed Morton to a two-year, $30 million contract.[28] He made his debut as a Ray against the Astros on March 29, 2019, pitching five innings and earning the win. On June 30, he was awarded his second consecutive All-Star appearance.[29] In 2019, he led all major league pitchers in home runs/9 innings pitched, at 0.694.[30] He set career highs in wins (16), ERA (3.05), innings (194+2⁄3) and strikeouts (240). He finished in third place for the Cy Young Award.[31] Morton started the American League Wild Card Game against the Oakland Athletics, receiving a win in five innings of work.[32] This was Morton's third career win in winner-take-all playoff games, the most in MLB playoff history.[32] On August 10, 2020, Morton was placed on the injured list with inflammation in his right shoulder.[33] Morton finished the 2020 year with an ERA of 4.74 over 38 innings.[34] Morton pitched in game 7 of the American League Championship Series against his former team the Houston Astros. He recorded his fourth win in a winner-take-all playoff game, extending his record.[35] On October 30, 2020, the Rays declined their $15 million team option on his contract for the 2021 season, and he was declared a free agent. At the time the Rays made their decision, it was reported that they were looking for a \"creative\" way to re-sign Morton as a free agent for the following year.[36] On November 24, 2020, the Atlanta Braves signed Morton to a one-year, $15 million contract.[37][38] On September 6, 2021, Morton and the Braves agreed to a one-year extension worth $20 million.[39][40] In the 2021 regular season, he was 14–6 with a 3.34 ERA in 33 starts.[41] On October 26, 2021, during Game 1 of the World Series versus the Houston Astros, Morton left the game after pitching only 2+1⁄3 innings with what was revealed to be a right fibula fracture. The injury occurred in the previous inning when Astros batter Yuli Gurriel hit a ball directly into Morton's leg. Initially believing he was unharmed, Morton continued to pitch, completing 16 more pitches—including a strikeout of former MVP Jose Altuve—before removing himself from the game.[42][43][44] Morton did not play for the remainder of the series. The Braves later won the World Series, giving the Braves their first title since 1995 and Morton his second World Series ring.[45] On September 30, 2022, Morton and the Braves agreed to a one-year contract extension for the 2023 season worth $20 million.[46][47] Morton recorded at least 200 strikeouts in consecutive seasons with the team, and became the third Atlanta Braves pitcher to have struck out 200 or more batters in multiple seasons.[48] In 2022, he was 9–6 with a 4.34 ERA, as in 31 starts he pitched 172 innings, and threw curveballs 38% of the time, more than any other pitcher in major league baseball.[49][50] The active career leader in hit batsmen with 156, he hit 18 batters, second in the NL.[49] During the 2023 season, Morton pitched to a 3.64 ERA and a 14–12 record.[51] The Braves picked up the option year on his contract, worth $20 million.[52] On June 28, 2024, Morton became the 22nd pitcher in MLB history to record a win against all 30 teams, following a scoreless outing against the Pittsburgh Pirates.[53] On August 13, 2024, Morton became the 89th pitcher in MLB history to reach the 2,000 strikeout mark when he struck out Mike Yastrzemski in the bottom of the sixth inning against the San Francisco Giants.[54] In 2024, Morton pitched to a 4.01 ERA and a 8-10 record with 167 strikeouts. On January 3, 2025, Morton signed a one-year, $15 million contract with the Baltimore Orioles.[55] Morton's repertoire consisted in 2013 of a four-seam fastball, a sinker, a curveball, and a split-finger fastball with his speed maxing out in the low 90s.[56] Morton picked up the splitter in 2011 having previously thrown a changeup. He also has previously thrown a slider and a cutter.[57] Morton's sinker was his most common pitch, especially against right-handed hitters. His curveball was his most common pitch in a two strike count.[58] Due to changes in his delivery and the emphasis he has placed on the sinker, Morton drew comparisons to Roy Halladay.[59] Pirates special assistant Jim Benedict had previously encouraged Morton to emulate Halladay's delivery during spring training. Morton featured his new sinker almost exclusively in his first starts of the 2011 season and it resulted in an increased groundball rate but also more bases on balls. Pirates' fans christened him with the nickname \"Ground Chuck.\"[60][61][62] In the 2015 offseason, a frustrated Morton began experimenting with throwing harder, alongside adjustments to his technique and workouts.[63] In his injury-abbreviated starts with the Phillies, he showcased his newfound velocity. Along with high spin rates, this attracted the attention of Houston's front office which signed him and encouraged Morton to continue throwing hard four-seam fastballs, as Morton felt his sinker was becoming ineffective.[64] While playing for the Astros, Morton transformed into a strikeout pitcher finding new effectiveness against left-handed hitters.[65] With Houston his primary pitches were a four-seam fastball reaching 98-99 MPH and a curveball with considerable vertical and horizontal movement, which Morton considers his best pitch.[66] In 2018, his improvements on his curveball was attributed to his low three-quarters position, but slightly above sidearm at release.[67] Morton and his wife, Cindy, have four children.[68] They reside in Bradenton, Florida.[69]",

                "content": "If not listed, please contact your TV provider. Ageless right-hander Charlie Morton isn't done yet. Weeks after suggesting he hopes to pitch again in 2025, the 41-year-old Morton has agreed to terms with the Baltimore Orioles on a one-year free-agent contract. The club made the announcement on Friday. According to Mark Feinsand, the deal will be worth $15 million. This past season for the Atlanta Braves, Morton registered a 4.19 ERA (99 ERA+) and a 4.46 FIP in 30 starts. Across his 165 ⅓ innings, Morton struck out 167 batters and walked 64 unintentionally. This marked the sixth straight full season -- i.e., excluding the heavily abbreviated 2020 campaign -- in which Morton has logged a qualifying number of innings and made at least 30 starts. Earlier in the offseason, CBS Sports ranked Morton as the No. 29 available free agent in the current class. Here's part of our write-up: He's made 30-plus appearances four years running, all the while posting an average or better ERA and strikeout-to-walk ratio for a starting pitcher. Despite Morton's advanced age and mileage, he continues to adapt and adjust. His curveball remains the king of its domain, but he's made a point of reducing his four-seamer usage; additionally, he's all but mothballed his once-signature sinker, bumping it to his fourth-most used pitch behind a changeup. Morton has been as flexible as any non-elite pitcher in recent memory; that helps to explain why he's in position to pitch beyond his 41st birthday. The 2025 season will be Morton's 18th in MLB. Over his 17 seasons to date, he's put up an ERA+ of 101 with a career WAR of 17.3. He goes into 2025 with 138 career wins in 382 starts. Morton has two All-Star selections to his credit, and in 2019 he finished third in the American League Cy Young voting as a member of the Rays. In Baltimore, Morton joins a rotation that also includes recent addition Tomoyuki Sugano out of Japan. As well, the Orioles in 2025 will get their first full season from 2024 deadline acquisition Zach Eflin. However, they'll be doing without ace Corbin Burnes, who recently signed a $210 million pact with the Diamondbacks. The Orioles are coming off a 2024 season in which they went 91-71 and made a second straight trip to the postseason. © 2004-2024 CBS Interactive. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.

                "title": "2025 Quadrantid meteor shower to peak January 3",
                "content": "A daily update by email. Science news, great photos, sky alerts. The Quadrantid meteor shower is one of a few each year with a narrow peak, in this case lasting only about 6 hours. When to watch: The best time to watch for the 2025 Quadrantids is the hours before dawn on January 3. (The predicted peak** is 19 UTC on January 3). Nearest moon phase: A first quarter moon will come at 23:56 UTC on January 6, 2025 (5:56 p.m. CST) so the moon will be a waxing crescent and set a few hours after sunset on January 2 and not interfere with the Quadrantid meteors. Radiant: Rises in the north-northeast after midnight and is highest up before dawn. The radiant point for the Quadrantids is in a now-obsolete constellation, Quadrans Muralis the Mural Quadrant. Nowadays, we see the radiant near the famous Big Dipper asterism. Because the Quadrantid radiant is far to the north on the sky’s dome, this is mostly a far-northern shower, not as good for the Southern Hemisphere. Expected meteors at peak, under ideal conditions: Under a dark sky with no moon, when the radiant is high in the sky, the Quadrantids can (briefly) produce over 100 meteors per hour. Duration of shower: The Quadrantid meteor shower runs from mid-November through mid-January each year, according to this 2017 article in the journal Icarus. You might see a Quadrantid streak by any time during that interval. But most activity is centered on the peak. This time period is when we’re passing through the meteor stream in space! Note: The Quadrantid shower is one of four major meteor showers each year with a sharp peak (the other three are the Lyrids, Leonids and Ursids). Report a fireball (very bright meteor) to the American Meteor Society: it’s fun and easy! From the late, great Don Machholz (1952-2022), who discovered 12 comets … For many years, the parent comet for the Quadrantids remained unknown. That’s because astronomers were looking for an object whose orbit matched the orbit of the Quadrantids’ meteor stream. Other meteor showers do have parent objects whose orbits match their meteor streams. But the Quadrantids’ parent object – or objects – are different. There are currently at least two related objects associated with Quadrantid meteors. Neither presently comes anywhere near Earth’s orbit. But both seem to be responsible for these early January meteors. The chief object that spawns the Quadrantids is an asteroid named 2003 EH1. It’s believed to be a dormant or extinct comet. The Lowell Observatory Near-Earth-Object Search (LONEOS) based near Flagstaff, Arizona, found asteroid 2003 EH1 on March 6, 2003. The asteroid takes 5.5 years to orbit the sun. Its closest point to the sun (perihelion) is 1.2 astronomical units (AU). One AU is the distance between the Earth and the sun. In past centuries, 2003 EH1 must have passed much closer to the Earth’s orbit. Now, though, this asteroid stays well outside Earth’s orbit. Yet particles ejected from this asteroid do intersect Earth’s orbit, to produce the Quadrantids’ narrow peak. And astronomers now say there is also a second, related object that also contributes to this meteor shower. The second object – Comet 96P/Machholz – produces a less intense and shallower peak. The material we see streaking across the sky left this comet centuries ago. Its perihelion distance is 0.12 AU, and it orbits the sun every 5.3 years. It was back near the Earth in late January 2023. 2025 EarthSky lunar calendar is available now. A unique and beautiful poster-sized calendar with phases of the moon for every night of the year. Get yours today! What’s the story on these two parent objects for the Quadrantids? The latest theory is that a large comet was captured by our sun and settled into a short-period orbit in about 2,000 BCE. This comet supplied meteors to the inner solar system and then it broke apart sometime between 100 CE and 950 CE. This breakup produced the Machholz Complex. In other words, there are multiple resultant offspring of this great comet. They are Comet 96P/Machholz, the Marsden Comet Group, the Kracht Comet Group, asteroid 2003 EH1 and eight meteor showers. The group is named the Machholz Complex after the main object, 96P/Machholz. A comet that was seen more than 500 years ago, C/1490 Y1, might be involved, too. The orbit calculated for this comet comes from rough positions calculated for the comet’s predicted return, which should be every few years. But we have not seen this comet again. One study suggests it approached too close to the planet Jupiter. So it might have been thrown out of the solar system. That might be why we haven’t seen it since 1490. Or, the comet might have split up prior to its next return, producing the Machholz Complex. This is not the final word about the parent objects of the Quadrantid meteor shower. Research continues among orbit calculators to better understand the transition of material from the surface of these objects to our Earth’s atmosphere every January. A new paper comes out nearly every year on the subject. That is how science works. Regardless of their origins, the Quadrantid meteor shower is a fine way to start a new year. The radiant point of the Quadrantid shower makes an approximate right angle with the Big Dipper and the bright star Arcturus. If you trace the paths of the Quadrantid meteors backward, they appear to radiate from this point on the starry sky. See chart at the top of this page. Now for our usual caveat. You don’t need to find the meteor shower radiant to see the Quadrantid meteors. You need to be at mid-northern or far-northern latitudes, up in the wee hours of the morning, and hope the peak comes at just the right time to your part of the world. The meteors will radiate from the northern sky but appear in all parts of the sky. Most meteor showers get their name from the constellations from which they appear to radiate. So it is with the Quadrantids. But the Quadrantids’ constellation no longer exists, except in memory. The name Quadrantid comes from the constellation Quadrans Muralis (Mural Quadrant). French astronomer Jerome Lalande created this constellation in 1795. This now-obsolete constellation was between the constellations of Boötes the Herdsman and Draco the Dragon. What happened to it? Where’d it go? To understand the history of the Quadrantids’ name, we go back to the earliest observations of this meteor shower. In early January 1825, Antonio Brucalassi in Italy reported that: … the atmosphere was traversed by a multitude of the luminous bodies known by the name of falling stars. They appeared to radiate from Quadrans Muralis. In 1839, two men, Adolphe Quetelet of Brussels Observatory in Belgium and Edward C. Herrick in Connecticut, independently suggested the Quadrantids as an annual shower. Then, in 1922, the International Astronomical Union (IAU) created a list of the 88 modern constellations. And it did not include Quadrans Muralis. Hardly anyone would remember this old constellation, if not for the Quadrantid meteor shower. The Quadrantids favor the Northern Hemisphere because their radiant is so far north on the sky’s dome. If you’re in the Southern Hemisphere, you might be tempted to resign yourself to the months-long meteor drought that kicks off every year and ends in April with the Lyrids. But, once in a while, we do hear from Southern Hemisphere dwellers who’ve seen a few Quadrantids! Bottom line: The best time to watch the Quadrantid meteor shower in 2025 is the hours before dawn on January 3, in a moon-free sky. This shower has a narrow peak, lasting only hours. **Peak times for meteor showers provided by Robert Lunsford of the American Meteor Society. Note that meteor shower predicted peaks may vary.

                "content": "We call them shooting stars, but it's actually meteors that create dazzling streaks of light across our night sky. With no time to waste in 2025, the first celestial show of the year gets underway this week with the Quadrantid meteor shower peak. NASA said the Quadrantid meteor shower is unique because of its brief peak and the origin of the shooting stars. Most meteor showers originate from comet debris, but the Quadrantids come from an asteroid.

(Photo by Tayfun Coskun/Anadolu via Getty Images) (Getty Images) The Quadrantids peak each year in early January as the Earth passes through the debris trail from asteroid 2003 EH1. Astronomers say this asteroid could be a new object known as a \"dead comet\" or \"rock comet.\" DON'T MISS THESE CELESTIAL EVENTS IN 2025 Although the Quadrantids have been observed in the night sky since the early 1800s, their origin was only discovered in 2003.

(Photo by Tayfun Coskun/Anadolu via Getty Images) Also, unlike other annual meteor showers, which peak over several days, the Quadrantids are a quick skygazing show. The peak lasts just six hours. According to NASA, this brief encounter is because the Earth crosses the thin stream of particles at a perpendicular angle. According to the American Meteor Society (AMS), this year's peak happens Friday, with the best chance of seeing meteors early Friday morning. During the peak, as many as 200 meteors can be seen under perfect weather and viewing conditions. The timing of this year's Quadrantid meteor shower peaks between 15:00 and 18:00 UTC (10 a.m. and 1 p.m. EST), which favors those in Hawaii and Alaska, according to AMS Editor Robert Lunsford. The cloud cover forecast for Friday morning. (FOX Weather) While early January doesn't offer the best weather for stargazing, the peak this year happens a few days after a new Moon with only 11% illumination. This means less moonlight to compete with the meteor shower. Unfortunately, cloud cover will cover many parts of the U.S. with active winter weather happening. According to the AMS, the Quadrantids continue through mid-January, when an average of 25 meteors per hour are possible under good conditions.

That doesn't mean the cosmic display – one of the few meteor showers to be caused by debris from an asteroid instead of a comet – isn't worth seeking out. Stargazers could be treated to a host of bright fireballs and the sight of multiple meteors per hour whizzing across the night sky at more than 25 miles per second when the Quadrantids reach their peak. Here's what to know about the Quadrantid meteor shower, including when it peaks and what causes it. Meteor showers occur on a predictable schedule each year, with some lasting for mere days and others stretching on for weeks. A meteor shower is at its best when the Earth passes through the densest part of the associated cosmic debris. That window, otherwise known as the shower's peak activity, is when stargazers will want to be on the lookout for meteors. The Quadrantids began zipping through the skies on Dec. 26 and will continue through Jan. 16, according to the American Meteor Society. But while most meteor showers have a two-day peak, the Quadrantids' maximum activity only lasts a few hours – making the meteors much more difficult to spot, according to NASA. For stargazers, that means the best time to catch the Quadrantid meteors will be in the predawn hours Thursday night into Friday morning, astronomers say. Timeanddate.com offers a detailed schedule for when to see the Quadrantids. The Quadrantids are best viewed from the Northern Hemisphere and are not well seen from the Southern Hemisphere. During its peak, anywhere from 60 to 200 Quadrantid meteors can be seen per hour under ideal conditions, according to NASA. While the meteors are known to lack persistent tails, they often produce bright fireballs, which are larger explosions of light persisting longer than an average meteor streak. The meteors seem to emerge – or radiate – from an obsolete constellation called \"Quadrans Muralis\" that today is located between the constellations of Bootes and Draco near the end of the handle of the Big Dipper, NASA says. Both the constellation and the shower are named after the quadrant, an early astronomical instrument used to observe and plot star positions. Astronomers caution that the radiant is not a good guide for where stargazers should look to view the streaking meteors, which should be visible across the night sky. Here are some general viewing tips from NASA: ◾ Find an area well away from street lights and the light pollution of cities. ◾ Come prepared for winter temperatures with a sleeping bag, blanket, or lawn chair. ◾ Lie flat on your back with your feet facing northeast and look up, taking in as much of the sky as possible. It should take less than 30 minutes for your eyes to adapt so that you can see streaking meteors. Meteor showers occur when Earth passes through dusty debris trails left by comets and other space objects as they orbit the sun. The debris – space rocks known as meteoroids – collides with Earth's atmosphere at high speed and disintegrates, creating fiery and colorful streaks in the sky, according to NASA. Those resulting fireballs, better known as \"shooting stars,\" are meteors. If meteoroids survive their trip to Earth without burning up in the atmosphere, they are called meteorites, NASA says. Unlike most meteor showers, the Quadrantid meteor shower doesn't originate from a comet, but from an asteroid. For many years, the origin of the Quadrantids remained unknown. Though the Quadrantids were first seen in 1825, it wasn't until 2003 that an astronomer at Lowell Observatory in Arizona discovered a small asteroid, 2003 EH1, was the source of the shower. Astronomers theorize that 2003 EH1, which takes about 5 ½ years to orbit the sun, is a dead comet that is now essentially a rock. Eric Lagatta covers breaking and trending news for USA TODAY.

The Quadrantid meteor shower is active from late December 2024 to early January 2025. It will peak on 3–4 January. Read on for tips on how to catch the best view of this stunning shower from planetary scientist and meteorite expert Dr Ashley King. Meteors are often called shooting stars, though the bright streaks you see in the sky don’t have anything to do with stars. In fact, what you’re wishing on are tiny particles of dust – leftovers from the birth of our solar system – vaporising in Earth’s atmosphere. Some of the more spectacular of these meteors can sometimes be visible from city centres, including in London, however you’re bound to get the best experience away from the light pollution in urban areas. A bright meteor recorded on a meteor-monitoring CCTV camera at the Natural History Museum. “The darker the skies, the better your chances of seeing the really faint meteors as well,” says Ashley. “You could go to the coast or stand on a hill in the middle of the countryside somewhere.” A full Moon can really light up the sky too, so you’ll likely have more success spotting meteors when a shower’s peak coincides with a new Moon. Fortunately, in 2025, several showers are set to occur when the skies are at their darkest. You also need to be patient. “You might not be able to see anything for the first 10 minutes while your eyes adjust to the dark,” he adds. “Once you get used to the low light levels you’ll begin to notice more and more. So don’t give up too quickly.” Meteor showers occur when Earth passes through streams of tiny pieces of debris – meteoroids – left behind by comets and asteroids. The peak of a meteor shower is when we see the highest rate of meteors. This happens as we pass through the densest part of the debris stream. Most comets are composed of dust and ice, which Ashley likens to “a big, dirty snowball”. “As comets orbit the Sun, the ice sublimes [changes from a solid to a gas] and the trapped dust is swept out into a tail behind them.” Nearly all meteors are tiny dust particles, about the size of a grain of sand travelling at tens of kilometres per second through space. “As they come out of the vacuum of space and into Earth’s atmosphere, that little dust grain interacts with all the particles and ions in the atmosphere. It gets heated up by the friction and forms the impressive flash that we see,” he says. “The Earth isn’t close to the comet – it’s just passing through some of the dust it left behind.” At other times of year, you may still see meteors in the sky, but only about one every 10 minutes. These sporadic meteors, as they are known, will come from random directions. A lone meteor. © Jacek Halick (CC BY-SA 4.0) via Wikimedia commons The Quadrantid meteor shower begins on 28 December 2024 and ends on 12 January 2025, and is best viewed from the Northern Hemisphere. It’s thought to occur when Earth passes through the trail left by the asteroid 2003 EH1. The Quadrantid meteor shower has a much shorter peak than others, lasting for just six hours before its intensity rapidly drops off. In 2025, the peak will occur on 3–4 January, just a few days after a new Moon. At its peak, and in ideal viewing conditions, up to 120 meteors and bright fireballs can be seen per hour, with the particles entering Earth’s atmosphere at around 40 kilometres per second. The Quadrantids appear to radiate from an area near the Big Dipper between the constellations of Boötes and Draco. This area was previously recognised as a separate constellation, which was named Quadrans Muralis by French astronomer Jerome Lalande in 1795. In 1922, the decision was made to no longer recognise Quadrans Muralis as an official constellation, but the meteor shower still continues to be named after it. In March 2003, a small near-Earth asteroid was discovered and named as 2003 EH1. This body completes an orbit of the Sun once every 5.5 years and is thought to be the source of the Quadrantid meteor shower. Some think that 2003 EH1 might be an extinct comet. This is a comet that has expelled most of its ice and so appears more like an asteroid, as it no longer has enough material to form a tail or coma – the ice and dust envelope that forms around a comet’s solid centre. People watching a meteor shower. © Allexxandar/ Shutterstock The Lyrid meteor shower takes place between 14–30 April as the Earth’s orbit passes through the dust trail left behind, hundreds of years ago, by comet C/186 G1 (Thatcher). This year, at the peak of the display on 22 April, around 18 meteors per hour are expected to be visible. The most spectacular are ‘Lyrid fireballs’, which occur when meteoroids the size of a large marble pass through the atmosphere. Their slightly larger size produces a meteor train which we see as a flash and line across the night sky. This year, the peak of the Lyrids falls during the Moon’s last quarter, making viewing conditions much better than in 2024, when it coincided with a full Moon. The Lyrid meteor shower gets its name because it appears to radiate from the area of the sky near the constellation Lyra, the Harp – but the meteors can appear anywhere in the sky. Comet Thatcher, responsible for the Lyrid meteor shower, takes 415 years to complete a full orbit of the Sun. We have no photographs of this comet because the last time it visited the inner solar system was in 1861 – well before the widespread use of photography. We won’t see it again until the year 2283. Lyrid meteor shower. © lovemushroom/ Shutterstock The Perseid meteor shower takes place from 17 July to 24 August as Earth passes through the trail left behind by the very large comet Swift-Tuttle. Most meteors are pieces of dust around the size of a grain of sand. Larger pieces can create spectacular fireballs and make bright trails across the sky. The Perseid shower may feature more than 100 meteors per hour at its peak, including bright streaks and fireballs. The best views will be from a dark location on the night of 12 August. This meteor shower is usually one of the best celestial events of the year to watch. Unfortunately, viewing conditions for the Perseids won’t be ideal this year, with the peak falling just three days after a full Moon. Perseids get their name because they appear to radiate from the constellation Perseus, but they can appear anywhere in the sky. Swift-Tuttle, responsible for the Perseid meteor shower, takes 133 years to complete a full orbit of the Sun. At 26 kilometres wide it is the largest solar system object to regularly pass so close to Earth. It’s likely significantly bigger than the asteroid that ended the age of dinosaurs, but don’t worry, calculations have shown that Swift-Tuttle isn’t a threat to the planet. Swift-Tuttle’s elongated orbit means that debris enters Earth’s atmosphere at great speed.

In 2025, the shower is due to peak on the night of 21–22 October. This year the peak falls on a moonless night, giving you ideal dark sky conditions for spotting meteors. Orionids are some of the fastest and brightest meteors, entering the atmosphere at just under 70 kilometres per second. Orionids get their name because they seem to radiate from the constellation Orion, but they can appear anywhere in the sky. Stargazers can usually expect to see up to 20 meteors per hour. Halley’s Comet is a short-period comet, meaning it takes less than 200 years to go around the Sun. Its orbital period is 75–76 years and it last passed close to Earth in 1986. It will be back again in 2061. In 1986, space agencies sent the missions Vega, Giotto, Sakigake and Suisei to Halley – known as the ‘Halley Armada’ – so it’s one of the best-studied comets. Halley’s Comet has been observed for centuries – in 1066 it was considered an omen of doom. It even appears on the Bayeux Tapestry, which depicts events leading up to the Norman conquest of England in the eleventh century. Orionid meteor shower and the Milky Way. © Brian Spencer/ Shutterstock The Leonid meteor shower takes place annually between 6–30 November as Earth crosses the trail of comet 55P/Tempel-Tuttle. Entering the atmosphere at 70 kilometres per second, the Leonids are some of the fastest-moving and brightest meteors. The shower promises up to 15 meteors per hour at its peak on the evening of 17 November, which is just a few days before a new Moon. Leonids get their name because they seem to radiate from the constellation Leo. Comet Tempel-Tuttle is a short-period comet, taking 33 years to go around the Sun. Its last visit was in 1998 with a return expected in 2031. The comet is quite small, only about three kilometres across. The comet is named for the two astronomers, Ernst Tempel and Horace Tuttle, who each independently discovered it in 1865 and 1866, respectively. Horace Tuttle also co-discovered Comet Swift-Tuttle, which causes the Perseid meteor shower. One of the most spectacular meteor showers of the year, the Geminids take place from 4–20 December as Earth passes through the trail of dust left by the ‘rock comet’ 3200 Phaethon. At the shower’s peak on the morning of 14 December, stargazers willing to brave the cold could be rewarded with a display of up to 150 multicoloured meteors per hour. It’s often one of the best showers of the year for viewers in the northern hemisphere, as it’s one of the most active. This year it falls just a few days before a new Moon. Geminids get their name because meteors appear to radiate from the constellation Gemini. Discovered by satellite in 1983, Phaethon has an orbital period of 524 days and is one of only a few asteroids associated with a meteor shower. According to Ashley, there’s been quite a lot of debate about what Phaethon really is. “Like other comets, Phaethon has an elliptical orbit but is unusual as it doesn’t go to the outer solar system. It has been officially classified as a B-type asteroid, but it has also been suggested that it could be a ‘rock comet’ or a ‘dead comet’.” Scientists have been studying Phaethon’s infrared emissions to learn more about this mysterious space rock. In 2023, this research revealed that Phaethon is likely linked to the CY group of carbonaceous chondrites. Carbonaceous chondrites are some of the oldest rocks in the solar system. They are often rich in water, sulphur and organic material, but those in the CY group show signs of drying and decomposition caused by heating. Phaethon travels even closer to the Sun than Mercury does. Scientists at the Natural History Museum have helped estimate that, at perihelion – the asteroid’s closest point to the Sun – its surface reaches 730 °C and some of its components turn to gas. The pressure this gas creates causes the rock to break down, leaving a comet-like trail of dust behind the asteroid as it travels through space. Phaethon may once have been similar to the asteroid Ryugu, from which the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA) Hayabusa2 mission returned samples in December 2020, and Bennu, an asteroid visited by NASA’s OSIRIS-REx mission, which returned to Earth with samples in September 2023. Our scientists have been leading some of the first analyses of the Bennu samples. Phaethon is considered a potentially hazardous asteroid, meaning it could impact the Earth at some point hundreds of years in the future. For this reason, it’s very well studied and there are plans to send space missions there in the future, such as DESTINY+, which aims to launch in 2028.

Anyone can capture the majesty of the galaxy with a simple camera. All you need is a dark, clear night and the willingness to have a go. When an unusual rock fell to Earth in 1795, it prompted the first large-scale investigation into the origin of meteorites. Falling from the sky in a blaze of glory, meteorites certainly know how to make an entrance, and the stories they tell span the history of our solar system.

                "content": "Fredrick Lee Kerley (/ˈkɜːrli/ KUR-lee; born May 7, 1995)[2] is an American track and field sprinter. He was the Olympic silver medalist over 100 m at the 2020 Olympics and bronze medalist at the 2024 Olympics in the same event. Kerley has earned an additional six medals at the World Championships, most notably 100m gold at the 2022 edition. He has also medalled in the 400m, 4 x 100m relay, and 4 × 400 m relay and won eleven Diamond League races, including two Diamond League finals - the 400m in 2018 and the 100m in 2021. His personal best time of 43.64 seconds makes him the tenth fastest man in history over 400 metres.[3] During the pandemic, Kerley chose to focus on the 100 m during the Olympic cycle to improve his basic speed for future attempts at a sub-43 400 m. The decision to move down paid off as he won the silver medal in the 100 m at the 2020 Tokyo Olympics with a 9.84 performance. His personal best time of 9.76 seconds makes him the sixth fastest man in history over the straightaway sprint, behind Usain Bolt, Yohan Blake, Tyson Gay, Asafa Powell and Justin Gatlin and joint with Christian Coleman and Trayvon Bromell. Kerley is one of only three men along with Michael Norman and Wayde van Niekerk to go sub-10 seconds in 100 m, sub-20 seconds in 200 m and sub-44 seconds in 400 m. Kerley attended Taylor High School and his youth team was the College Station Sprinters in College Station, Texas. Afterwards he attended South Plains College from 2013 to 2015 before transferring to Texas A&M. In 2016, Fred Kerley tried out for the Olympic team at the USA Olympic Trials.[4] He did not qualify out of his heat, but he went on to represent the United States at the NACAC Under-23 Championships where he anchored the 4 × 100 meters relay team to gold.[5] In March 2017, he won the 400 m at the NCAA Division I Championships in a world leading time of 44.85 s, one of the top ten fastest indoor times ever. He joined his younger brother Mylik Kerley as he anchored the Aggies to a come from behind victory in the 4 × 400 m relay. The two first place finishes contributed 20 points to the team, helping bring Texas A&M to their first ever team victory at the NCAA Track and Field Championships, run on their home track. In May, Kerley ran 44.09 s, just 0.09 s off the NCAA record, while easing to the finish line at the Southeastern Conference (SEC) Championships in Columbia, South Carolina.[6] A few weeks later Kerley set the NCAA record in the men's 400 m at the 2017 NCAA West Preliminary with a time of 43.70 s, taking three-tenths of a second off the 44.00 record by Olympic champion Quincy Watts, set almost 25 years earlier.[7][8] Kerley had met Watts just before the race.[9] He concluded his amateur career to win the 400 m and 4 × 400 m relay at the 2017 NCAA Division I Championships in June. A few weeks after turning professional and signing with Nike, Kerley won the 400 m at the USATF Championships in 44.03 seconds, qualifying to represent the United States in both the 400 m and the 4 × 400 m relay at the World Championships in Athletics. After winning his heat he finished third in his semi, but qualified for the final on time.[10] In the final he was unable to replicate his form from earlier in the season, finishing seventh in a time of 45.23 s. He came back a day later to help the US qualify for the finals in the relay, and then a few days later earned a silver medal behind Trinidad and Tobago. Training under Kevin Tyler with widely-renowned club ALTIS in Phoenix, Arizona,[11] Kerley finished 3rd in the 400m at the 2018 US Indoor Championships, failing to qualify for the individual 400m at the upcoming World Indoor Championships but making it onto the 4 × 400 m relay team. There, he helped the team to a silver medal finish. Outdoors, Kerley ran several races across the international circuit, including a win in the 400m at the Rome Diamond League. However, none of his times came close to his 43.70 personal best. Despite suffering an injury in June, Kerley bounced back in August to win at the Birmingham Diamond League, before winning the Diamond League trophy in the men's 400 meters in Zurich.[12] After the season, he returned to Texas A&M to train under Francique, stating to Track & Field News \"I believe in him so much that I had to come back to train with him.\"[1] Kerley was selected to compete for the US in the 4x400m relay at the 2019 IAAF World Relays, but the team was disqualified in the preliminaries. Kerley took wins at the Shanghai Diamond League and the Racers Grand Prix in Kingston, Jamaica, and finished third at the Stanford Diamond League. A month later, Kerley won the US title in a new personal best time of 43.64 seconds, making him the 7th fastest man on the all-time rankings at the time. At the World Championships in Doha, Kerley won the bronze medal in the individual event and helped the US to a gold in the relay. After the COVID-19 pandemic erased the 2020 season and delayed the 2020 Summer Olympics by a year, Kerley kicked off his 2021 season with several 100m races in order to work on his speed for the longer sprint; he broke the historic 10-second barrier at the TRUfit Classic in Miami on April 24, winning in 9.91 s with a maximum allowable wind velocity for record purposes (+2.0 m/s).[13] On May 19 he won the men's 100 m in 9.96 s at the Golden Spike in Ostrava, finishing ahead of former Olympic and World champion Justin Gatlin who settled for second in 10.08 s. Kerley also ran in the 200 m where he placed second with a time of 20.27 s, trailing Kenny Bednarek from the start who won in 19.93 s. According to Reuters, Kerley was satisfied with his performances, but thought there was more work to do in his 200 m and his focus for the Olympic Trials would be 400 m.[14] However, after 400m races in Doha and Hengelo caused his ankle to swell due to the turns, he decided to focus on the 100m and 200m at the Trials. Kerley also stated that the popularity of the 100m was another factor in his switch. Despite online backlash for his decision, Kerley silenced doubters by finishing third in the 100m at the Trials, qualifying for his first Olympic team. In the 200m, Kerley struggled throughout the rounds due to the turns and their impact on his ankles, and he narrowly qualified for the final on time. However, he managed to finish an impressive fourth with his first sub-20 performance; this made him the 3rd athlete to join the \"Sub 10s, 20s, 44s club for the 100m, 200m & 400m sprints\", behind 400m World Record holder Wayde van Niekerk & Michael Norman.[15] Prior to the U.S. Championships, Kerley competed in three Diamond Leagues: Doha, where he placed second in the 200m; the Prefontaine Classic, where he placed second in the 100m; and at the Rome Golden Gala, where he won the 100m. At the 2022 USA Outdoor Track and Field Championships, Kerley won the 100m in 9.77 seconds and placed third in the 200m in 19.83 seconds. Kerley ran 9.76 seconds, a personal best, in the semi-final.[16] While competing in the 2022 World Athletics Championships, Kerley won his maiden individual World Championship gold medal in the 100m.[17] In the final, Kerley pipped compatriot Marvin Bracy on the line with a time of 9.86 seconds winning the world title in the process. Fellow American Trayvon Bromell finished third, completing a clean sweep.[18] He was knocked out of the 200m in the semi-final. Kerley enjoyed a strong start to his 2023 season, taking home wins in the Doha, Rabat, and Florence Diamond Leagues.[19] At the 2023 USA Outdoor Track and Field Championships, Kerley contested only the 200m as he received a bye to the 2023 World Championships as the 2022 World Champion in the 100m. He placed fourth in the final of the 200m to Erriyon Knighton, Kenny Bednarek, and Courtney Lindsey. Later in July, he placed second in the Silesia Diamond League 100m. Kerley failed to advance from his semi-final of the 100m at the 2023 World Athletics Championships. However, he earned gold as a member of the United States 4x100m relay team. Soon after his third place finish in the Xiamen Diamond League 100m, in September 2023, Kerley announced that he was no longer coached by Alleyne Francique and would be coached by Quincy Watts, the Director of Track and Field at the University of Southern California.[20] In September 2024, it was announced that he had signed up for the inaugural season of the Michael Johnson founded Grand Slam Track.[21][22] Information from World Athletics profile unless otherwise noted.[23] The two highlighted times are track records (accurate as of September 2024). Kerley's older cousin is former NFL wide receiver Jeremy Kerley.[39] Kerley has a Christian faith and regularly attended church after practice.[40]",

                "title": "\n    Video shows arrest of Olympic sprint medalist Fred Kerley after confrontation with Miami Beach Police - CBS Miami",
                "content": "Watch CBS News By Allen Cone Updated on: January 3, 2025 / 10:02 PM EST / CBS Miami MIAMI BEACH - A track medalist in the 2020 and 2024 Summer Olympics was arrested in Miami Beach after a physical confrontation with four officers Thursday night, according to police. Fred Kerley, 29, of Southwest Miami-Dade County, exchanged words with officers, a physical struggle ensued, and he was wrestled to the ground and subdued with a stun gun, police said. The agency released bodycam video of the incident. CBS News Miami has edited the video to take out profanity. On Friday, police added a probable cause arrest of robbery/strongarm and domestic battery on May 7, 2024, stemming from a physical confrontation with a woman he was married for three years and knew for 10 years. They reside together with three children in common. Police say they were not able to locate him then. He already was facing charges of battery of a police officer and resisting an officer without violence. During his first appearance on Friday afternoon, Circuit Judge Mindy Glazer didn't find probable cause for a charge of disorderly conduct/breach of the peace and he was allowed to be released from jail on his own recognizance. His attorney, Richard L. Cooper said Kerley will be released Saturday. \"These new charges are stemming from a falsified accusation that has resurfaced because of this new media attention from last nights wrongful arrest,\" the attorney said. \"I can say that Mr. Kerley is a record-breaking athlete who has honorably and successfully represented our nation in the Olympics many times. These charges are false and indicate the brutal police state that Miami Beach has become.\" In a follow-up statement provided to CBS News, Cooper wrote that, \"It is clear from all available recordings of the arrest (including police worn body camera) that the police overreacted to an otherwise peaceful interaction with Mr Kerley.\" Kerley's girlfriend, Cleo Rahman, 32, a national DJ known as Dj Sky High Baby, also is facing a charge of resisting an officer without violence charge because \"her actions took several officers to divert their attention from assisting the officers to deal with her,\" according to the arrest report. Florida's Halo Law, effective on Wednesday, establishes a 25-foot buffer zone around first responders to protect them during active duties and violations are classified as second-degree misdemeanors. Rahman, a Burbank, Calif., resident, used her cellphone to record what happened \"What are you doing,\" she said in the video. \"He is team USA.\" Rahman told CBS Miami: \"He was not aggressive. This does not give police the right to be push him and be aggressive for no reason. He's an athlete. He is team USA. It is not like he is playing for another team. He is here. This was so unfortunate. I want to go back home to Los Angeles. I have never been arrested before or been in trouble.\" Police dispute her comments. \"Mr. Kerley battered one of our officers and pushed him in the chest, at which point the officers put their hands on him and tasered him,\" Officer Christopher Bess told CBS News Miami. \"The message is very clear that when you see officers engaged in a scene give them some distance.\" At 11:22 p.m., Miami Beach officers were involved in an investigation on the 100 block of Ninth Street. According to the arrest report: \"Officers subsequently were approached by a black Male, wearing a gray hoodie, and black pants with an aggressive demeanor who was concerned about his vehicle that was parked in the area of the scene.\" Kerley argued with the officers and his girlfriend, who attempted to pull him away from officers to calm the situation, police said. Despite officers' efforts to de-escalate the situation, he stepped up to an officer. One officer \"delivered multiple hammer fists\" toward Kerley's head and elbows, according to the police report. \"Stop resisting!\" one officer said to Kerley as he laid on the ground, according to bodycam footage. \"I'm not resisting, get off of me, bro,\" Kerley replied. One of the officers used a dart-firing stun gun, striking Kerley in the right lower back and he fell on his stomach, police said. \"The defendant's action disrupted the flow of pedestrian traffic and caused a crowd on the nearest sidewalk,\" according to the police report. \"The defendant's actions also endangered the safety of the staff and establishment patrons of the nearby restaurant and Ocean Drive.\" He was taken to Mount Sinai Medical Center in Miami and then to Turner Guilford Knight Correctional Center. \"This could have been prevented,\" Bess said. \"Our officers tried multiple times to de-escalate but Mr. Kerley kept rushing our officers.\" The president of the Fraternal Order of Police in Miami criticized the judge for allowing him to be released from jail. \"I am very disappointed that Judge Mindy Glazer did not look at our officer's body worn cameras before she acted more like a defense attorney at the bond hearing than an unbiased judge,.\" Bobby Hernandez said. \"She must have also not been aware that as she was sympathizing with him and his defense attorney that this 'model citizen' was wanted for domestic violence involving strangulation and robbery. Defendant Fred Kerly (spelling) had an opportunity to comply, and he decided to violently resist. Bad decisions lead to bad consequences.\" In the 2020 Olympics, which took place in 2021 in Tokyo, Kerley finished second in the 100 meters. In the 2024 Olympics in Paris, he was third, running the 100 in 9.81 seconds, just behind fellow American Noah Lyles and Jamaica's Kishane Thompson in a photo finish. Kerley was born in San Antonio and ran track at Texas A&M. He won the 400 meters at the NCAA Division I Championships in a world-leading time 44.85 seconds. © 2025 CBS Broadcasting Inc.

                "title": "Olympic Runner Fred Kerley Arrested, Tased in Confrontation With Police - Newsweek",
                "content": "Fred Kerley, a Team USA Olympic sprinter, was arrested on Thursday in Miami Beach, Florida, after a confrontation with police officers led to him being tased. Newsweek has reached out to Miami Beach Police Department (MBPD) and Kerley's representatives at Pace Sports Management for comment Friday afternoon via email. Kerley, 29, is an Olympic medal-winning athlete, originally from Texas, who took home bronze and silver medals in 2021 and 2024. He was also the 2022 100-meter world champion and has won multiple other races. The athlete's competitive career goes back to 2017 and he has starred in the Netflix docuseries Sprint in 2024. Kerley's arrest came as officers with the MBPD investigated an incident in the 100 block of 9th Street late Thursday night. According to local media, he approached officers and expressed concern about his vehicle, which was parked nearby. According to the MBPD, Kerley became \"increasingly aggressive\" and officers asked him to leave the area, but he refused and took a \"fighting stance.\" Police then tried to tackle him to the ground. The incident was captured on police body-worn cameras, seen by NBC 6 News, which showed the Olympian being pulled to his feet by cops before they led him away. A woman, thought to be his girlfriend, was heard asking officers to stop. \"He's an athlete, please do not mess with him,\" she can be heard on the video before an officer then said they would tase him. In a statement, the MBPD said that when officers tried to arrest Kerley \"he actively resisted their efforts. Consequently, emergency back-up was requested, a dart-firing stun gun was effectively deployed, and the defendant was arrested without any further incident.\" Meanwhile, Cleo Rahman, Kerley's girlfriend, who is a DJ known as Dj Sky High Baby, was also detained for allegedly resisting arrest. She later posted to Instagram saying, \"police brutality on black men got to stop!!\" An arrest record for Kerley, with Miami-Dade County Corrections seen by Newsweek, showed he was charged with battery, resisting an officer without violence, and disorderly conduct. Two other charges were listed against his name for robbery/strongarm and battery, but it was not clear whether those were related. Kerley's attorney in court on Friday: \"This seems like a total misunderstanding. Mr. Kerley is a record-breaking athlete. He has served in the Olympics for the United States track and field (team). He is a model citizen in our community. This is nothing more than an overreaction by the police.\" Miami-Dade Judge Mindy Glazer in court to a police sergeant on Friday: \"I don't know if the officers in Miami Beach are busy handling a lot of complicated crime scenes there, but I have a gentleman who's never been arrested, there's no prior arrests, who his attorney's saying has competed in the Olympics, who is obviously a professional athlete and it's unfortunate that he got to this position.\" Kerley was released from jail following his first hearing after Glazer did not find probable cause for a charge of disorderly conduct/breach of the police. He was released on his own recognizance, per records seen by Newsweek. Dan Gooding is a Newsweek reporter based in New York City. His focus is reporting on immigration and border security.

                "title": "Fred Kerley, U.S. Olympic star, arrested after police confrontation",
                "content": "Olympic track and field star Fred Kerley was arrested in Florida late Thursday after a confrontation with police. Body-worn camera footage released by the Miami Beach Police Department on Friday shows Kerley, the reigning Olympic bronze medalist in the men's 100-meter dash, exchanging words with a group of officers before being wrestled to the ground and struck repeatedly. One of the officers then subdued Kerley with a stun gun, colloquially known as a Taser, before he was placed into handcuffs. Kerley was booked into jail early Friday morning on charges of battery upon a law enforcement officer, which is a third-degree felony, as well as resisting an officer and disorderly conduct, which are misdemeanors. He was released Friday afternoon after making his initial appearance in court. When asked about Kerley's arrest and the altercation that proceeded it, one of Kerley's attorneys, Yale Sanford, referred to the body-worn camera footage released by police, which he described as \"obscene.\" \"It just goes to show you that no matter how hard you work, or how many medals you earn for your country, in Miami Beach last night, my client was treated like millions of African-Americans around the country — with a lack of humanity, compassion and respect,\" Sanford, who is working alongside Richard L. Cooper to represent Kerley, told USA TODAY Sports. Miami Beach police spokesperson Christopher Bess said the incident, like all use-of-force incidents, was undergoing a standard review but that the officers \"responded to the resistance appropriately and professionally.\" The altercation between Kerley and police took place in a commercial area of southern Miami Beach, a few blocks from the water. In a written police report, officers described Kerley as having an \"aggressive demeanor\" when he approached the perimeter of an unrelated police scene, apparently on the way to his car, which was parked nearby. Police allege that Kerley \"attempted to force his way through\" two officers despite their requests that he circumvent the area. One officer then raised his left hand and made contact with Kerley, who brushed it aside. In the altercation that followed, police wrote in their report that four officers attempted to place Kerley into custody while he used \"evasive movements to avoid being arrested.\" One of the officers then \"delivered multiple hammer fists\" towards Kerley's head and upper back in continued attempts to subdue him, according to the police report. A separate video, shared on social media by a witness, shows an officer striking Kerley on the side of his torso. One of the officers then unholstered his stun gun, which made contact with Kerley's back and sent him to the ground, where police proceeded to place him in handcuffs. \"Stop resisting!\" one of the officers said to Kerley as he lay on the ground, according to the footage. \"I'm not resisting, get off of me, bro,\" Kerley replied, before repeatedly and profanely calling the officers \"weak.\" A small crowd gathered near the scene, according to the body-worn camera footage, with many of the onlookers holding up their phones. Cleo Rahman, who was accompanying Kerley and is identified in the police report as his girlfriend, is also heard screaming \"stop!\" repeatedly during and after the encounter. \"He didn't do anything!\" she told officers at one point. \"We were walking to our car! Our car is right there!\" According to online court records, Rahman was also arrested for resisting an officer without violence, which is a misdemeanor. Hours after Kerley was booked into jail, another Florida police department filed separate charges against the sprinter stemming from an alleged domestic incident in May. According to the police report in that case, Kerley and the victim − who is not named but identified by police as his wife of three years − got into an argument at their house in Miami on May 7. The victim told police that Kerley took her cell phone, then \"pushed her to the ground, encircled his arm around her neck and impeded her breathing\" before leaving the scene. She said he later returned the phone but was not at the house when police arrived. Miami-Dade County police charged Kerley with robbery and domestic battery, but a spokesperson said they had not been able to locate and arrest him until he was arrested in the Miami Beach case late Thursday night. Kerley's attorney said he was expected to appear before a judge in the domestic case Saturday. \"These new charges are stemming from a falsified accusation that has resurfaced because of this new media attention from last night's wrongful arrest,\" Cooper said in a statement. A USA Track & Field spokesperson declined comment on Kerley's arrest but said the organization was not aware of the domestic battery charge prior to his participation in the 2024 Paris Olympics last summer. Kerley has emerged in recent years as one of top sprinters in the world and one of the best-known track and field athletes on Team USA. After switching from his initial event, the 400 meters, he won a surprising silver medal in the men's 100-meter dash at the 2021 Tokyo Olympics. The former Texas A&M sprinter then followed it up with a world championship in the event in 2022, and another Olympic medal (bronze) at the Paris Games last summer. He has also competed internationally in the 200-meter dash and 4x100 meter relay. Contact Tom Schad at tschad@usatoday.com or on social media @tomschad.bsky.social.",

Spin: Burton won't even travel with the team to Pittsburgh, and it seems as if he's being punished for some sort of off-the-field incident. It's the third time this season that the third-round rookie will be a healthy inactive. Burton will close out the regular season having caught just four of 14 targets for 107 scoreless yards. He also returned 13 kickoffs for 378 yards. Perhaps Burton can get back on the field next week if the Bengals sneak into the playoffs. ESPN Fantasy Projection: Burton was selected in the third round of April's draft. He has the play strength to work through contact at multiple levels of the field, with the ability to separate at the third level due to his 4.45 speed. Burton is also a strong hands-catcher who can work on the boundary. He joins a highly talented (and crowded) wide receiver room in Cincinnati, where he'll be in a position to compete for the No. 3 role in the Bengals' offense. Burton has plenty of upside in dynasty formats with Tee Higgins slated to play this season on the franchise tag.",

He is the current head football coach at the University of Georgia, his alma mater. As head coach, he led the Bulldogs to back-to-back national championships in 2021 and 2022. Smart was born in Montgomery, Alabama, and grew up in Bainbridge, Georgia.[3] His father was a high school football coach.[4] Smart began his playing career at Bainbridge High School and went on to play college football at the University of Georgia, where he was teammates with defensive linemen Antonio Cochran, Emarlos Leroy, linebacker Brandon Tolbert, Pro Football Hall of Fame cornerback Champ Bailey, and Super Bowl MVP Hines Ward.[5] Smart was a four-year letterman at defensive back for Georgia and a first-team All-SEC selection as a senior.[6][7] He finished his career with 13 interceptions, which ranked fourth all-time at Georgia, and led the Bulldogs with six interceptions in 1997 and five in 1998.[8][7][9] He was also a four-time member of the SEC Academic Honor Roll.[10] Smart graduated from the Terry College of Business in 1998 with a bachelor's degree in finance.

He was hired by Saban as an assistant coach on January 9.[20] On February 27, 2008, Smart was promoted to defensive coordinator.[21] On December 8, 2009, Smart was awarded the Broyles Award as the nation's best assistant coach.[22] He was the first Alabama assistant coach to win the award.[23] Alabama went on to win the BCS National Championship over Texas.[24] Smart considered a lucrative contract to be the defensive coordinator at his alma mater, the University of Georgia but chose to stay with the Crimson Tide in early January 2010.[25] In 2011, Smart's defense helped Alabama win another championship, beating LSU in the 2012 BCS National Championship Game.[26] On March 27, 2012, the University of Alabama System's Board Of Trustees voted to increase Smart's salary and extend his contract.[27] On November 20, 2012, Smart was recognized as the 2012 AFCA FBS Assistant Coach of the Year.[28] Alabama would win another national championship, beating Notre Dame with a bruising defense.[29] On April 16, 2013, Smart was granted a $200,000 salary increase to make him the highest-paid defensive coordinator in college football.[30] He was part of the Alabama staff that won the National Championship over Clemson in the 2015 season.[31] On December 6, 2015, Smart was announced as the 26th head football coach at the University of Georgia.[32] Smart has had 5 of his assistant coaches become head coaches at the FBS level. Shane Beamer for South Carolina, Sam Pittman for Arkansas, Mel Tucker for Colorado and Michigan State, Dan Lanning for Oregon, and Fran Brown for Syracuse. During his tenure at Georgia, Smart has had more than 25 players arrested. The arrests vary greatly, from minor traffic violations to the much more serious assault of an unborn child.[33] Smart earned his first victory as head coach of the Bulldogs in a 33–24 victory over #22 North Carolina in Georgia's first game.[34] Smart led Georgia to a 13–7 victory over #8 Auburn on November 12.[35] Smart went 8–5 in his first season as the head coach of the Bulldogs in 2016.[36] The Bulldogs finished tied for second in the SEC East division.[37] Smart's first year as Georgia's head coach ended with a 31–23 victory over TCU in the Liberty Bowl.[38] In the 2017 season, Smart led the Bulldogs to their first 9–0 start since 1982 and won the SEC East after a victory over the South Carolina Gamecocks on November 4.[39][40] On December 2, 2017, Smart coached Georgia to its first SEC title since 2005, and only the fourth 12-win season in school history (1980, 2002, 2012).[41][42][43] On December 3, Georgia was ranked No. 3 by the College Football Playoff Committee.[44] Georgia played No. 2 Oklahoma in the College Football Playoff semifinal game at the Rose Bowl. Georgia rallied from a 31–14 first-half deficit, ultimately defeating Oklahoma 54–48 in double overtime.[45] The Bulldogs went on to lose to Alabama in the National Championship Game 26–23, where Alabama freshman quarterback Tua Tagovailoa relieved Jalen Hurts late in the contest and ended the game on a 41-yard touchdown completion to DeVonta Smith in overtime.[46] Smart was named SEC Coach of the Year for the 2017 season and received the George Munger Award.[47] In the 2018 season, Georgia completed the regular season with an 11–1 record.

The team recorded victories over #7 Notre Dame and #6 Florida during the season.[53] The one loss was a 20–17 setback to South Carolina.[54][55] Georgia won the SEC East for the third consecutive season, but lost to LSU in the SEC Championship game, 37–10.[56][57] Georgia, ranked No. 5 entering the bowl season, beat No. 7 Baylor in the Sugar Bowl, 26–14.[58] In 2020, Georgia's regular-season record was 7–2.[59] Georgia's two setbacks were to #2 Alabama and #8 Florida.[60][61] The season was shortened because of the COVID-19 pandemic; all four games against non-SEC opponents were canceled, though Georgia played one more game than usual against SEC opponents.[62] Georgia was slated to play ten games, but the game against Vanderbilt had to be cancelled due to COVID issues within the Commodore program.[63] Georgia finished the regular season in second place in the SEC East.[64] In the subsequent bowl season, the No. 9 Bulldogs beat No. 8 Cincinnati in the Peach Bowl, 24–21.[65] In 2021, Georgia went 12–0 in the regular season.[66] Georgia lost to Alabama in the SEC Championship, 41–24.[67] Georgia was ranked No. 3 after this game and earned a College Football Playoff nomination.[68] The Bulldogs defeated No. 2 Michigan in the College Football Playoff semifinal game at the Orange Bowl, 34–11.[69] Georgia defeated No. 1 Alabama in the National Championship game, 33–18, to secure their first national championship since 1980.[70] With this victory, Smart became the first of Saban's former assistants at Alabama and just the second overall to defeat Saban (Jimbo Fisher, a former assistant at LSU and the head coach at Texas A&M, was the first after his unranked Aggies team upset the Crimson Tide earlier in the season).[71] Smart was named SEC Coach of the Year for the 2021 season.[72] In July 2022, Smart and Georgia agreed to a 10-year contract extension worth $112.5 million, making him the highest-paid coach in college football.[73] Georgia started off the season with a #3 ranking in the AP Poll.[74] The team started with a 49–3 victory over #11 Oregon.[75] After the Oregon victory, Georgia earned the top spot in the AP Poll reeled off seven more victories to set up an undefeated matchup against Tennessee, who was #1 in the College Football Playoff rankings and #2 in the AP Poll.[76] Georgia defeated Tennessee 27–13.[77] In the 2022 season, Georgia finished 12–0 once more in the regular season before defeating LSU in the SEC Championship game, 50–30.[78][79] Georgia defeated Ohio State in the Peach Bowl 42–41 in a close contest.[80] In the National Championship game, Georgia defeated TCU 65–7, making Kirby Smart a back-to-back national championship-winning coach, the first one since Nick Saban did so with Alabama in 2011 and 2012.[81] Smart was named SEC Coach of the Year for the second consecutive season and the third time overall.[82] Before the beginning of 2023, Georgia was ranked #1 in both the AP and coaches polls.[83] Following a 49–21 victory over UAB, Smart's record as head coach of Georgia increased to 85–15, which became the highest total of wins and the highest win percentage achieved by an SEC coach through their first 100 games in history.[84] Smart additionally led the Bulldogs to an SEC-record 29-game win-streak with a 31–23 win over in-state rival Georgia Tech in Week 12 of the regular season, finishing it 12–0.[85] The win also resulted in the most recent instance of 3-consecutive seasons of undefeated in-conference SEC play, with the second most recent also being UGA teams of 1980–82. The win streak ended with a loss to Alabama in the SEC Championship Game, 24–27.[86] As a result of the loss, Georgia was not among the top four ranked teams that made the College Football Playoff, and instead played Florida State in the Orange Bowl. Georgia defeated Florida State by a score of 63–3, the largest point differential in Orange Bowl and FBS bowl game history, the latter breaking the record set in the previous year's National Championship game.[87] In May 2024, Smart and Georgia agreed to a ten-year contract extension worth $130 million, once again making him the highest-paid coach in college football history.[88] Smart earned his 100th career win as head coach in a 30–15 victory against #1 Texas.[89] Smart is married to Mary \"Beth\" Elizabeth Lycett, who played basketball for the University of Georgia.[2] The couple have three children.[90] # denotes interim head coach",

For the two head coaches, it will be a reunion between close friends. Georgia head coach Kirby Smart and Texas head coach Steve Sarkisian both spent part of their careers under the leadership of legendary former Alabama head coach Nick Saban. Though their times in Tuscaloosa didn’t coincide, Saban’s lessons remain apparent in both playing styles. “Well, we have things in common,” Smart said in a Sports Illustrated interview. “You know, both worked for Nick (Saban) and had a mutual friendship there, had a mutual friendship through Lane (Kiffin) … But he’s just a bright mind, he’s fun to be around, competitor. We have a lot in common in terms of that and I’ve enjoyed the time I’ve got to spend around him.” Smart started his career as a player for the Georgia Bulldogs and returned to Athens just a year after wrapping up his collegiate career. Though Smart joined the Indianapolis Colts for preseason, he was cut from the team ahead of regular season kick-off. That same year, 1999, Smart joined the Dawgs as an administrative assistant. Smart moved around some programs like LSU and Florida State before heading back to Georgia in 2005 as the running back coordinator. At the time, Smart only spent a year with the team before moving to the NFL as the Miami Dolphins’ safeties coach. Georgia wouldn’t be Smart’s home for another eight years. From 2007 to 2015, Smart coached under Saban as the defensive coordinator at Alabama. Texas’ Sarkisian held an analyst position in 2016, just after Smart left for the head coaching position at his alma mater. In his time leading the Bulldogs, Smart won two consecutive national championships. Following a contract extension, Smart became the highest-paid coach in college football. Georgia started the year at the top of the AP Poll — now, it’s Texas at No. 1. Sarkisian is looking to do what his fellow Saban product did in 2021 and 2022: win it all. Despite their off-field friendship, it’s safe to say the high stakes of Saturday’s game will come first. And for Smart, this Longhorn team has what it takes to be a national champion. “Well, I think when you look for a team, you look for weakness,” Smart said in a Sports Illustrated interview. “You know, you look for areas that you can maybe take advantage of. And when you look across the board to the kicking game, the passing game, the run game, the fundamentally sound, complementary football, force turnovers, don’t turn the ball over. The things that you can eliminate for beating yourself, they do a great job of all that, and that’s why they’re undefeated. That’s why they were in the playoff last year and that’s why they’re ranked No. 1 right now in the country.” Official newspaper of The University of Texas at Austin",

                "content": "Associazione Calcio Milan (Italian pronunciation: [assotʃatˈtsjoːne ˈkaltʃo ˈmiːlan]), commonly referred to as AC Milan (Italian pronunciation: [a tˌtʃi mˈmiːlan]) or simply Milan,[6] is an Italian professional football club based in Milan, Lombardy. Founded in 1899, the club competes in the Serie A, the top tier of Italian football. In its early history, Milan played its home games in different grounds around the city before moving to its current stadium, the San Siro, in 1926.[7] The stadium, which was built by Milan's second chairman, Piero Pirelli and has been shared with Inter Milan since 1947,[8] is the largest in Italian football, with a total capacity of 75,817.[9] The club has a long-standing rivalry with Inter, with whom they contest the Derby della Madonnina, one of the most followed derbies in football.[10] Milan has spent its entire history in Serie A with the exception of the 1980–81 and 1982–83 seasons.[11][12] Silvio Berlusconi’s 31-year tenure as Milan president was a standout period in the club's history, as they established themselves as one of Europe's most dominant and successful clubs. Milan won 29 trophies during his tenure, securing multiple Serie A and UEFA Champions League titles. During the 1991–92 season, the club notably achieved the feat of being the first team to win the Serie A title without losing a single game.[13] Milan is home to multiple Ballon d'Or winners, and three of the club's players, Marco van Basten, Ruud Gullit, and Frank Rijkaard, were ranked in the top three on the podium for the 1988 Ballon d'Or, an unprecedented achievement in the history of the prize.[14] Domestically, Milan has won 19 league titles,[15] 5 Coppa Italia titles and 7 Supercoppa Italiana titles.[16] In international competitions, Milan is Italy's most successful club.[nb 1][16][17][18][19] The club has won seven European Cup/Champions League titles, making them the competition's second-most successful team behind Real Madrid, and further honours include five UEFA Super Cups, two UEFA Cup Winners' Cups, a joint record[nb 2] two Latin Cups, a joint record[nb 3] three Intercontinental Cups and one FIFA Club World Cup.[16] Milan is one of the wealthiest clubs in Italian and world football.[20] It was a founding member of the now-defunct G-14 group of Europe's leading football clubs as well as its replacement, the European Club Association.[21] \"Saremo una squadra di diavoli. I nostri colori saranno il rosso come il fuoco e il nero come la paura che incuteremo agli avversari.\" \"We will be a team of devils. Our colours will be red like fire and black like the fear we will invoke in our opponents.\" AC Milan was founded as Milan Foot-Ball and Cricket Club in 1899 by English expatriate Herbert Kilpin.[12] The club claims 16 December of that year as their foundation date,[24] but historical evidence seems to suggest that the club was actually founded a few days after, most likely on 18 December.[2] However, with the club's charter being lost, the exact date remains open to debate. In honour of its English origins, the club has retained the English spelling of the city's name, as opposed to the Italian spelling Milano, which it was forced to bear under the fascist regime. Milan won its first Italian championship in 1901, interrupting a three-year hegemony of Genoa, and a further two in succession in 1906 and 1907.[11] The club proved successful in the first decade of its existence, with several important trophies won, including, among others, the Medaglia del Re three times,[25] the Palla Dapples 23 times[26] and the FGNI tournament five times, a competition organized by the Italian Gymnastics Federation but not officially recognized by the Italian Football Federation.[27] In 1908, Milan experienced a split caused by internal disagreements over the signing of foreign players, which led to the forming of another Milan-based team, F.C. Internazionale.[28] Following these events, Milan did not manage to win a single domestic title until 1950–51,[16] with some exceptions represented by the 1915–16 Coppa Federale[29] and the 1917–18 Coppa Mauro,[30] two tournaments played during the First World War which, especially the former, received a lot of attention and proved to be highly competitive, despite them not being officially recognized by the Italian federation. The 1950s saw the club return to the top of Italian football, headed by the famous Gre-No-Li Swedish trio Gunnar Gren, Gunnar Nordahl and Nils Liedholm. This was one of the club's most successful periods domestically, with the Scudetto going to Milan in 1951, 1955, 1957 and 1959.[16] This decade witnessed also the first European successes of Milan, with the 1951 and 1956 Latin Cup triumphs against Lille and Athletic Bilbao. Milan was also the first Italian club to take part to the newly born European Cup in the 1955–56 season, and reached the final two years later, when they were defeated by Real Madrid. The 1960s began with the debut of Milan's legend Gianni Rivera in 1960:[31] he would remain with the club for the rest of his career for the following 19 seasons. In 1961, Nereo Rocco was appointed as new coach of the club,[32] which under his leadership won immediately a scudetto in 1961–62, followed, in the next season, by Milan's first European Cup triumph, achieved after beating Benfica in the final.[33][34] This success was repeated in 1969, with a 4–1 win over Ajax in the final, which was followed by the Intercontinental Cup title the same year.[16] During this period Milan also won its ninth scudetto, its first Coppa Italia, with victory over Padova in the 1967 final, and two European Cup Winners' Cups in 1967–68 and 1972–73, after defeating in the last match Hamburg and Leeds United respectively.[16] Domestically, the 1970s were characterized by the pursuit of the 10th Serie A title, which grants the winner the Scudetto star. For three years in a row, in 1971, 1972 and 1973, Milan ended up second in the league, after some memorable duels with Inter and Juventus. Finally, the achievement was reached in 1979. The same year saw the retirement of Gianni Rivera and the debut of Franco Baresi, at his first full season with the club. After this success, the team went into a period of decline. The club in 1980 was involved in the Totonero scandal and as punishment was relegated to Serie B for the first time in its history.[35] The scandal was centred around a betting syndicate paying players and officials to fix the outcome of matches.[35] Milan achieved promotion back to Serie A at the first attempt, winning the 1980–81 Serie B title,[16] but were again relegated a year later as the team ended its 1981–82 campaign in third-last place. In 1983, Milan won the Serie B title for the second time in three seasons to return to Serie A,[16] where they achieved a sixth-place finish in 1983–84. On 20 February 1986, entrepreneur Silvio Berlusconi (who owned Fininvest and Mediaset) acquired the club and saved it from bankruptcy after investing vast amounts of money,[11] appointing rising manager Arrigo Sacchi at the helm of the Rossoneri and signing Dutch internationals Ruud Gullit, Marco van Basten and Frank Rijkaard.[11] The Dutch trio added an attacking impetus to the team, and complemented the club's Italian internationals Paolo Maldini, Franco Baresi, Alessandro Costacurta and Roberto Donadoni. Under Sacchi, Milan won its first Scudetto in nine years in the 1987–88 season. The following year, the club won its first European Cup in two decades, beating Romanian club Steaua București 4–0 in the final. Milan retained their title with a 1–0 win over Benfica a year later and was the last team to win back-to-back European Cups until Real Madrid's win in 2017.[36] The Milan team of 1988–1990, nicknamed the \"Immortals\" in the Italian media,[37] has been voted the best club side of all time in a global poll of experts conducted by World Soccer magazine.[38] After Sacchi left Milan in 1991, he was replaced by the club's former player Fabio Capello whose team won three consecutive Serie A titles between 1992 and 1994, a spell which included a 58-match unbeaten run in Serie A (which earned the team the label \"the Invincibles\"),[37][39][40] and back-to-back UEFA Champions League final appearances in 1993, 1994 and 1995. A year after losing 1–0 to Marseille in the 1993 Champions League final, Capello's team reached its peak in one of Milan's most memorable matches of all time, the famous 4–0 win over Barcelona in the 1994 Champions League final.[39] Capello's side went on to win the 1995–96 league title before he left to manage Real Madrid in 1996.[39] In 1998–99, after a two-year period of decline, Milan lifted its 16th championship in the club's centenary season. Milan's next period of success came under another former player, Carlo Ancelotti. After his appointment in November 2001, Ancelotti took Milan to the 2003 Champions League final, where they defeated Juventus on penalties to win the club's sixth European Cup.[41] The team then won the Scudetto in 2003–04 before reaching the 2005 Champions League final, where they were beaten by Liverpool on penalties despite leading 3–0 at half-time.[41] Two years later, the two teams met again in the 2007 Champions League final, with Milan winning 2–1 to lift the title for a seventh time.[41][42] The team then won its first FIFA Club World Cup in December 2007.[43] In 2009, after becoming Milan's second longest serving manager with 420 matches overseen,[43] Ancelotti left the club to take over as manager at Chelsea. During this period, the club was involved in the Calciopoli scandal, where five teams were accused of fixing matches by selecting favourable referees.[44] A police inquiry excluded any involvement of Milan managers;[45] the Italian Football Federation (FIGC) unilaterally decided that it had sufficient evidence to charge Milan vice-president Adriano Galliani. As a result, Milan was initially punished with a 15-point deduction and was banned from the 2006–07 UEFA Champions League. An appeal saw that penalty reduced to eight points,[46] which allowed the club to retain its Champions League participation. Following the aftermath of Calciopoli, local rivals Internazionale dominated Serie A, winning four Scudetti. However, with the help a strong squad boasting players such as Zlatan Ibrahimović, Robinho and Alexandre Pato joining many of the veterans of the club's mid-decade European successes, Milan recaptured the Scudetto in the 2010–11 Serie A season, their first since the 2003–04 season and 18th overall.[47][48] After their 18th Scudetto, the club declined in performance. Milan failed to qualify to European competitions for a few years, and the only trophy won was the 2016 Supercoppa Italiana, achieved under Vincenzo Montella's coaching after defeating Juventus in the penalty shoot-out.[citation needed] On 5 August 2016, a new preliminary agreement was signed with the Chinese investment management company Sino-Europe Sports Investment Management Changxing Co., to which Fininvest sold a 99.93% stake of Milan for about €520 million, plus the refurbishment of the club financial debt of €220 million.[49] On 13 April 2017, the deal was completed and Rossoneri Sport Investment Lux became the new direct parent company of the club.[50] In order to finalise the deal, American hedge fund Elliott Management Corporation provided Li with a loan of €303 million (€180 million to complete the payment to Fininvest and €123 million issued directly to the club).[51][52] On 10 July 2018, Li failed to keep up with his loan repayment plan, neglecting to deposit a €32 million instalment on time in order to refinance the €303 million loan debt owed to the American hedge fund. As a result, In July 2018, chairman Li Yonghong's investment vehicle Rossoneri Champion Inv. Lux. was removed as the shareholder of Rossoneri Sport Inv. Lux., the direct parent company of the club, making the investment vehicle majority controlled by Elliott Management Corporation the sole shareholder of Rossoneri Sport Inv. Lux.[53][54][55][56] On 27 November 2017, Montella was sacked due to poor results and replaced by former player Gennaro Gattuso.[57] Milan qualified for the 2018–19 UEFA Europa League group stage after finishing 6th in the 2017–18 Serie A season, but were banned by UEFA from European competition due to violations of Financial Fair Play regulations for failure to break-even.[58] Milan appealed to the Court of Arbitration for Sport and the decision was overturned on 20 July 2018.[59][60][61] In Gattuso's first full season in charge, Milan exceeded expectations and spent much of the campaign in the top 4. Despite winning their final 4 games, Milan missed out on the Champions League by one point.[62] After Milan's failure to qualify for the Champions League, Gattuso resigned as manager.[63] On 19 June 2019, Milan hired former Sampdoria manager Marco Giampaolo on a 2-year contract. On 28 June 2019, Milan was excluded from the 2019–20 UEFA Europa League for violating Financial Fair Play regulations for the years 2014–2017 and 2015–2018.[64] After four months in charge, Giampaolo was sacked after losing four of his first seven games, which was exacerbated by poor performances and a lack of supporter confidence. Stefano Pioli was hired as his replacement.[65] After the restart of the Serie A campaign due to the COVID-19 outbreak, Milan went on a 10 match unbeaten streak, winning 7 in the process including matches against Juventus, Lazio and Roma. This streak led to Milan abandoning their plans of hiring Ralf Rangnick as their new manager and sporting director, and instead extended Pioli's contract for a further 2 years.[66] Following a stellar start in the 2020–21 Serie A, which was a continuation of the second half of the previous season, Milan under Pioli in his first full season were led to a second-place finish in the league which was the highest finish for the team since the 2011–12 Serie A. This result allowed Milan to qualify for the 2021–22 UEFA Champions League for the following season, which would become their first appearance in the UEFA Champions League in seven years since their last appearance in the 2013–14 UEFA Champions League. Milan secured their 19th Italian championship title on the last round of the 2021–22 season, with a club-record tally of 86 points. It was their first league title since the 2010–11 season. In the Serie A Awards, Rafael Leão was named as the league's most valuable player, Mike Maignan as the best goalkeeper, and Pioli as coach of the season.[67][68][69] On 1 June 2022, RedBird Capital Partners agreed to acquire AC Milan at $1.3 billion, meanwhile Elliott Management Corporation would keep a minority stake.[70] After five seasons with Milan, Pioli stepped down at the end of 2023–24 season and Paulo Fonseca was named as his replacement.[71] Red and black are the colours which have represented the club throughout its entire history. They were chosen by its founder Herbert Kilpin to represent the players' fiery ardor (red) and the opponents' fear to challenge the team (black). Rossoneri, the team's widely used nickname, literally means \"the red & blacks\" in Italian, in reference to the colours of the stripes on its jersey.[72] Another nickname derived from the club's colours is the Devil. An image of a red devil was used as Milan's logo at one point with a Golden Star for Sport Excellence located next to it.[73] As is customary in Italian football, the star above the logo was awarded to the club after winning 10 league titles, in 1979. The official Milan logos have always displayed the Flag of Milan, which was originally the flag of Saint Ambrose,[73] next to red and black stripes. The modern badge used today represents the club colours and the flag of the Comune di Milano, with the acronym ACM at the top and the foundation year (1899) at the bottom.[73] For what concerns the badge worn on match kits, from the origins to the mid-1940s it was simply the flag of Milan. For many decades no club logo was displayed, with the exception of the devil's logo in the early 1980s. The club badge made its definitive appearance on the match strips in the 1995–96, in a form that remained basically unchanged until present days. Since its foundation, the AC Milan home kit consisted of a red and black striped shirt, combined with white shorts and black socks; over the course of the decades, only cyclical changes dictated by the fashions of the time affected this pattern, which remained almost unchanged up to present days. In the first decade of the 20th century, the Rossoneri's first kit was a simple silk shirt characterized by thin stripes, with the badge of the city of Milan sewn at heart level. From the 1910s, the stripes were enlarged following a pattern that would remain unchanged until the late 1950s. The 1960s marked a return to the origins, with the use of thin stripes. This style would last until the 1985–86 season, with a small intermezzo from 1980 to 1982, when the stripes changed to a middle size again. A notable innovation occurred in this period. Between the 1979–80 and 1980–81 seasons, the AC Milan shirt achieved an important record by adding the surnames of the players above the number for the first time in Italian football.[74] From the 1986–87 season, under the impulse of the new club owner Silvio Berlusconi, the stripes were brought back to a middle size, and the colour of the socks was changed to white, taking the same colour of the shorts. In such a way, Berlusconi aimed at giving the players a more elegant look, as well as making the kit more distinguishably red and black when watched on the television compared to the thin striped kit, which, at a distance and on the television, could mistaken for a full red or brown shirt.[75] This style continued until 1998. Starting from the 1998–99 season, the kits started to be modified on a yearly basis in their design. Milan's away kit has always been completely white, sometimes adorned with various types of decorations, the most common of which are one vertical or horizontal red and black stripe.[76] The white away kit is considered by both the fans and the club to be a lucky strip in Champions League finals, due to the fact that Milan has won six finals out of eight in an all white strip (losing only to Ajax in 1995 and Liverpool in 2005), and only won one out of three in the home strip. The third strip, which is rarely used, changes yearly, being mostly black with red trimmings. \"I can't think of many shirts out there that are as recognisable as Milan's. – Our kits go beyond just the sphere of football.\" \"AC Milan Anthem – Milan Milan\" debuted in 1988 and was composed by Tony Renis and Massimo Guantini.[83][84] The official mascot, designed by Warner Bros., is \"Milanello\", a red devil with the AC Milan kit and a ball.[citation needed] Milan played their first matches at the Trotter pitch, located where the Milan Central railway station would later be built. It could not be defined as a stadium, as there were no dressing rooms, no stands and no other facilities. In 1903, Milan moved to the Acquabella pitch, where the stands consisted of a section of ground raised for the purpose. Milan played there until 1905. The following year the club moved to the Porta Monforte pitch, where they played until 1914. The stadium was furnished with a ticket office and wooden stands. In the following years Milan played at the Velodromo Sempione from 1914 to 1920, and at the Viale Lombardia stadium from 1920 to 1926. The latter was a modern structure, with a big main stand and which hosted several games of the Italy national football team.[85] In 1926 Milan moved to the stadium where they still play nowadays: The San Siro. The stadium,[9] officially known as Stadio Giuseppe Meazza after the former player who represented both Milan and Internazionale, has 75,923 seats. The more commonly used name, \"San Siro\", is the name of the district where it is located. San Siro was privately built by funding from Milan's president at the time, Piero Pirelli. Construction was performed by 120 workers, and took 13+1⁄2 months to complete. The stadium was owned by the club until it was sold to the city in 1935, and since 1947 it has been shared with Internazionale when the other major Milanese club was accepted as joint tenant. The first game played at the stadium was on 19 September 1926, when Milan lost 6–3 in a friendly match against Internazionale. Milan played its first league game in San Siro on 19 September 1926, losing 1–2 to Sampierdarenese. From an initial capacity of 35,000 spectators, the stadium has undergone several major renovations, most recently in preparation for the 1990 FIFA World Cup when its capacity was set to 85,700, all covered with a polycarbonate roof. In the summer of 2008 its capacity was reduced to 80,018, to meet the new standards set by UEFA. Based on the English model for stadiums, San Siro is specifically designed for football matches, as opposed to many multi-purpose stadiums used in Serie A. It is therefore renowned in Italy for its fantastic atmosphere during matches, largely thanks to the closeness of the stands to the pitch. The frequent use of flares by supporters contributes to the atmosphere but the practice has occasionally caused problems. On 19 December 2005, Milan vice-president and executive director Adriano Galliani announced that the club was seriously working towards a relocation. He stated Milan's new stadium will be largely based on the Veltins-Arena – the home of Schalke 04 in Gelsenkirchen – and will follow the standards of football stadiums in the United States, Germany and Spain. As opposed to many other stadiums in Italy, Milan's new stadium would likely be used for football only, having no athletics track. On 11 December 2014, Barbara Berlusconi announced a proposal to build a property stadium of 42,000 seats in Portello, behind the new HQ of the Rossoneri, and the large square \"Piazza Gino Valle\". The new village with shopping malls and hotel is located near CityLife district and is served by the metro.[86] On 20 September 2015, however, Silvio Berlusconi called an end to his club's plans to build a new stadium in the city.[87] In 2017, new CEO Marco Fassone stated that the club may look at either staying in the San Siro or moving to a new stadium with the club hierarchy emphasising the need to increase average attendance for home games.[88] On 27 September 2023, chairman Paolo Scaroni announced the club had filed a proposal to build a new 70,000-seater stadium, alongside the club headquarters and museum in the comune of San Donato Milanese, a suburb south of Milan.[89] Milan is one of the most supported football clubs in Italy, according to research conducted by Italian newspaper La Repubblica.[90] Historically, Milan was supported by the city's working class, which granted them the nickname of casciavid [kaʃaˈʋiːt] (which in Milanese dialect means \"screwdrivers\"), used until the 1960s.[91] On the other hand, crosstown rivals Inter Milan were mainly supported by the more prosperous middle class.[91] The oldest ultras groups in all of Italian football, Fossa dei Leoni, originated in Milan.[92] Currently, the main ultras group within the support base is Brigate Rossonere.[92] Milan ultras have never had any particular political preference,[92] but the media traditionally associated them with the left wing[93] until recently, when Berlusconi's presidency somewhat altered that view.[94] According to a study from 2010, Milan is the most supported Italian team in Europe and seventh overall, with over 18.4 million fans.[95] It had the thirteenth highest average attendance of European football clubs during the 2019–20 season, behind Borussia Dortmund, Bayern Munich, Manchester United, Barcelona, Real Madrid, Inter, Schalke 04, Tottenham Hotspur, Celtic, Atlético Madrid, West Ham United and Arsenal.[96] Milan's main rivalry is with its neighbour club, Inter Milan. Both clubs meet in the widely anticipated Derby della Madonnina twice every Serie A season. The name of the derby refers to the Blessed Virgin Mary, whose statue atop the Milan Cathedral is one of the city's main attractions. The first match was held in the final of the Chiasso Cup of 1908, a football tournament played in Canton Ticino, Switzerland, on 18 October of that year; the Rossoneri won 2–1.[97] The rivalry reached its highest point in the 1960s, when the two clubs dominated the scene both domestically and internationally. In Italy they cumulatively won five Serie A titles, while internationally they collected four European cups. On the bench it showcased the clash of two different approaches to Catenaccio by the two managers: Nereo Rocco for Milan and Helenio Herrera for Inter. On the pitch the stage was taken by some of the biggest stars the Italian Serie A could offer: players such as Gianni Rivera, Giovanni Trapattoni and José Altafini for Milan and Sandro Mazzola, Giacinto Facchetti and Luis Suárez for Inter. The match usually creates a lively atmosphere, with numerous (often humorous or offensive) banners unfolded before the start of the game. Flares are commonly present and contribute to the spectacle but they have occasionally led to problems, including the abandonment of the second leg of the 2004–05 Champions League quarter-final match between Milan and Inter on 12 April 2005, after a flare thrown from the crowd by an Inter supporter struck Milan goalkeeper Dida on the shoulder.[98] The rivalry with Juventus F.C. is a rivalry between the two most titled teams in Italy. The challenge confronts also two of the clubs with the greater basin of supporters as well as those with the greatest turnover and stock market value in the country.[99] Milan and Juventus were often fighting for the top positions of the Serie A standings. Some important periods marked by this rivalry were the early 1950s, which saw the two teams alternating each other as Serie A champions (the two clubs won seven titles in the decade), and big duels between forwards, with the Swedish Gre-No-Li on the rossoneri side and the trio formed by Giampiero Boniperti, John Hansen and Karl Aage Præst on the bianconeri side; the early 1970s, when for two consecutive seasons, 1971-72 and 1972-73, Milan lost the scudetto to Juventus by just one point; the 1990s, when the two clubs dominated the league by winning eight (consecutive) titles out of ten, lining up players that marked the history of football in their era and in the whole history; and finally in the 2000s, when, between the 2004-05 and 2005-06 seasons, the two clubs contested each other the Serie A titles, both won by Juventus but then revoked due to the Calciopoli scandal. The only match played by the two teams in European competitions was the 2003 UEFA Champions League final, the first such final between two Italian clubs, won by Milan at the penalties, which granted Milan the sixth Champions League title of their history.[100] The rivalry with Genoa started at the dawn of the 20th century, when the two clubs repeatedly faced each other for the Italian championship and other important trophies of the time. It then continued in the 1981-82 Serie A season, when Genoa avoided relegation in Naples just a few minutes from the final whistle of the last game of the season condemning the Rossoneri to the second Serie B season of their history. The rivalry worsened in 1995 after Genoa fan Vincenzo Spagnolo was stabbed to death by a Milan supporter.[101] Milan also have rivalries with Fiorentina, Atalanta and Napoli. In the movie industry, among the films dedicated to the Rossoneri team is Sunday Heroes (1953), by director Mario Camerini, in which the main plot pivots around a fictional football match between the Rossoneri and a club on the brink of relegation. In the film appear, in addition to the coach Lajos Czeizler, many of the Milan players of the time, including Lorenzo Buffon, Carlo Annovazzi and the entire Gre-No-Li trio.[citation needed] Milan as a fan base and some of their most popular players appeared in several Italian comedy movies. Among them the following are worth mentioning: Eccezzziunale... veramente, Really SSSupercool: Chapter Two (whose cast includes Paolo Maldini, Gennaro Gattuso, Massimo Ambrosini, Dida, Andriy Shevchenko and Alessandro Costacurta) and Tifosi (whose cast includes Franco Baresi).[citation needed] On 16 December 1999, on the day of the centenary of the club's foundation, Milan Channel was launched. The subscription-based television channel broadcasts news, events and vintage matches of the club. It is the first Italian thematic channel entirely dedicated to a football team. On 1 July 2016, the channel took on the new name of Milan TV, renewing its graphics and logo.[citation needed] In the editorial field, Forza Milan! was the official magazine of the club for over half a century. It was founded in 1963 by journalist Gino Sansoni and published by Panini. Issued with a monthly cadence, it covered all events surrounding Milan, with interviews to its protagonists, special posters, reports of official and friendly matches. Under the direction of Gigi Vesigna it reached a monthly circulation of 130,000 copies. The last issue of the magazine was published in June 2018.[102] With a total of 31 domestic honours, Milan is one of the most successful clubs in Italy. The club won its first Serie A title in 1901 with its most recent coming in 2022. Milan's tenth scudetto win meant that it earned the right to place a star on its jersey in recognition of this. Milan is the most successful Italian club in international football with 20 major international trophies won (18 of them organised by UEFA and FIFA), and the third most successful in Europe overall after Real Madrid and Barcelona. They have won the European Cup/Champions League seven times, an Italian record and only surpassed by Real Madrid, with their most recent coming in 2007. Milan's fifth European Cup win, in 1994, meant that the club was awarded the trophy permanently and is allowed to display a multiple-winner badge on its shirt.[103] The club also holds a joint record of two wins in the Latin Cup and a joint record of three wins in the Intercontinental Cup. In 2007, Milan won the FIFA Club World Cup for the first time, completing an international treble of Champions League, Super Cup and Club World Cup. Paolo Maldini holds the records for both total appearances and Serie A appearances for Milan, with 902 official games played in total and 647 in Serie A (as of 31 May 2009, not including playoff matches),[104] the latter being an all-time Serie A record.[105] Swedish forward Gunnar Nordahl scored 38 goals in the 1950–51 season, 35 of which were in Serie A, setting an Italian football and club record. He went on to become Milan's all-time top goalscorer, scoring 221 goals for the club in 268 games.[106] He is followed in second place by Andriy Shevchenko with 175 goals in 322 games, and Gianni Rivera in third place, who has scored 164 goals in 658 games. Rivera is also Milan's youngest ever goalscorer, scoring in a league match against Juventus at just 17 years. Legendary tactician Nereo Rocco, the first proponent of catenaccio in the country, was Milan's longest-serving manager, sitting on the bench for over nine years (in two spells) in the 1960s and early 1970s, winning the club's first European Cup triumphs. Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi, who purchased the club in 1986, is Milan's longest-serving president (23 years, due to a two-year vacancy between 2004 and 2006). The first official match in which Milan participated was in the Third Federal Football Championship, the predecessor of Serie A, losing 3–0 to Torinese. Milan's largest ever victory was 13–0 against Audax Modena, in a league match at the 1914–15 season. Its heaviest defeat was recorded in the league at the 1922–23 season, beaten 0–8 by Bologna. During the 1991–92 season, the club achieved the feature of being the first team to win the Serie A title without losing a single game. Previously, only Perugia had managed to go unbeaten over an entire Serie A season (1978–79), but finished second in the table. In total, Milan's unbeaten streak lasted 58 games, starting with a 0–0 draw against Parma on 26 May 1991 and coincidentally ending with a 1–0 home loss to Parma on 21 March 1993. This is a Serie A record as well as the third-longest unbeaten run in top flight European football, coming in behind Steaua București's record of 104 unbeaten games and Celtic's 68 game unbeaten run.[13][107] Since 2007, along with Boca Juniors, Milan has won more FIFA recognised international club titles than any other club in the world with 18 titles.[108] They were overtaken by Al Ahly SC from Egypt after their 2014 CAF Confederation Cup win.[109] The sale of Kaká to Real Madrid in 2009 broke the eight-year-old world football transfer record held by Zinedine Zidane, costing the Spanish club €67 million[110] (about £56 million[111]). That record, however, lasted for less than a month, broken by Cristiano Ronaldo's £80 million transfer.[112] This record, however, is in terms of nominal British pound rates, not adjusted to inflation or the real value of the euro. Madrid bought Zidane for €77.5 million in 2001,[113][114] about £46 million at that time. Note: Flags indicate national team as defined under FIFA eligibility rules; some limited exceptions apply.

Here is a complete list of them.[128] Below is a list of Milan managers from 1900 until the present day.[129] On 13 April 2017 Milan became a subsidiary of Rossoneri Sport Investment Luxembourg, which acquired 99.9% shares of AC Milan S.p.A. from Fininvest. Li Yonghong became the new chairman[nb 4] and Marco Fassone was confirmed as CEO.[130][131] Li Yonghong's investment vehicle was removed as the shareholder of Rossoneri Sport Investment Luxembourg after defaulting to Elliott Management Corporation, which lent a large sum of money to Li to finalise the acquisition.[132][133] Other partners of Elliott were Arena Investors[133] and Blue Skye, according to news reports.[134] Elliott nominated a new board of directors for both Rossoneri Sport Investment Luxembourg and Milan, with Paolo Scaroni as the new chairman (Italian: presidente) of the board of Milan. The four previous Chinese member of the board and former CEO Marco Fassone were all dismissed.[135] According to The Football Money League published by consultants Deloitte, in the 2005–06 season, Milan was the fifth-highest earning football club in the world with an estimated revenue of €233.7 million.[136] However, it fell to twelfth in 2013–14 season. The club is also ranked as the eighth-wealthiest football club in the world by Forbes magazine as of 2014[update], making it the wealthiest in Italian football, just surpassing ninth-ranked Juventus by a narrow margin.[20] Emirates is the current main sponsor for Milan's shirt starting from the 2010–11 season and through to the 2019–20 season.[137] Previously, German car manufacturer Opel (owned by General Motors) had sponsored Milan for 12 seasons.[138] For most of those 12 years, \"Opel\" was displayed on the front of the shirt, but in the 2003–04 and the 2005–06 seasons respectively, \"Meriva\" and \"Zafira\" (two cars from the company's range) were displayed. The current shirts are supplied by Puma. Previously it was supplied by German sportswear manufacturer Adidas, whose deal was scheduled to run until 2023.[139] The deal made Adidas the official manufacturer of all kits, training equipment and replica outfits. However, an early termination of the deal was announced in October 2017,[140] effective on 30 June 2018. Prior to Adidas, the Italian sports company Lotto produced Milan's sportswear. As a consequence of the aggregate 2.5-year financial result in the reporting periods ending at 31 December 2015, 31 December 2016 and 30 June 2017 (a FFP-adjusted net loss of €146 million, €121 million in excess of the acceptable deviation in the regulation[141]: 9 ), Milan was initially banned from European competitions due to breach in UEFA Financial Fair Play Regulations. However, the European ban was lifted by an appeal to the Court of Arbitration for Sport.[141] Milan was allowed to achieve the break even condition on or before 30 June 2021.[142] Note: Re-capitalization figures were obtained from item versamenti soci in conto capitale e/o copertura perdite, for 2006 to 2017 financial year Milan took part in three editions of the Superleague Formula, from 2008 to 2010. This car competition involved the participation of professional racing teams sponsored by international football teams. The Rossoneri supported the Dutch team Scuderia Playteam in the first season, then Azerti Motorsport in 2009 and the Atech Grand Prix in 2010. The team took several victories and pole positions, and finished third in the final standings of the 2008 championship with Robert Doornbos, former Minardi and Red Bull driver in the Formula 1 World Championship, as main driver.[169] In the same year, Doornbos achieved his team's first victory at the Nürburgring circuit in Germany. Giorgio Pantano drove for Milan in the 2009 season and he has also won races for the team.[170]",

They both share the same stadium, meaning home and away in this tie is played in rather familiar territory. The first game handed the advantage to Inter, but a two-goal deficit is not beyond the reach of their neighbourly rivals AC Milan. **Follow Inter vs AC Milan in the Champions League semi-final live** The history of AC Milan is a storied one, and the club owes its nomenclature to its English roots as well as a touch of historical circumstance, one very much linked to that of their rivals. Ahead of the game, I thought I’d delve into the tale behind the name of this iconic football institution. 💸🇮🇹 Inter take on their city rivals Milan at San Siro tonight, and they will do so without a ludicrously expensive sponsor on their shirt - but why?Before you ask, I'm not complaining, it makes their shirt look even more fabulous...https://t.co/9UnMXVBbTn Back in 1899, an English expatriate named Herbert Kilpin set the wheels in motion to establish a club in Milan. Originally known as Milan Foot-Ball and Cricket Club, this ambitious venture would lay the foundation for greatness. While the club claims December 16 as its official founding date, historical evidence points toward a more probable inception on December 13, a few days earlier. Interestingly, AC Milan’s (Associazione Calcio Milan, translated to Milan Football Association) name carries a subtle nod to its English heritage. In an era when the club faced external pressures to conform to the Italian spelling of the city, Milano, it defiantly held onto its English roots. Despite the imposition during the fascist regime, the club retained the unique spelling that harkened back to its inception. It became a symbol of defiance, a constant reminder of the enduring spirit of the team. The Derby della Madonnina: History and origin Why is Inter vs AC Milan called the Derby della Madoninna? Inter's sponsor-less jersey explained The early years saw AC Milan establish themselves as a force to be reckoned with. In the first decade of existence, the club secured several prestigious trophies, including the Medaglia del Re (King’s Medal), the Palla Dapples, and the FGNI tournament. These triumphs were testament to the team’s prowess and set the stage for a remarkable journey. However, the road to success had its bumps along the way. In 1908, internal disagreements over the signing of foreign players led to a dramatic split within the club. Out of this division emerged another Milan-based team, F.C. Internazionale Milano, giving birth to one of football’s most intense rivalries. This separation marked a challenging period for AC Milan, with an elusive domestic title remaining out of reach until the 1950–51 season. We have one mission! ❤️🖤 Un’unica missione! ❤️🖤 #RednBlack #UCL #InterMilan #SempreMilan pic.twitter.com/TIvvHpVz5Q CHAMPIONS LEAGUE CHAMPIONS LEAGUE The 1950s proved to be the start of what was to come, with five Scudetto titles and two continental trophies in that decade, although decline would be seen in the ‘80s, with a betting scandal adding a black mark to their proud name. Glory was soon to return either side of the turn of the new century. Today, AC Milan has recaptured some of its magic and after lifting the Serie A title in 2022, now aims to add Champions League glory. Its name reflects the amalgamation of cultures, an English spelling that proudly defies conformity, and an Italian soul that beats within. Through triumphs and setbacks, AC Milan has remained a testament to the power of passion, unity, and the indomitable spirit of the Beautiful Game.

                "title": "History of the AC Milan | AC Milan",
                "content": "“We will be a team of devils. Our colours will be red like fire and black to invoke fear in our opponents!” These were the words that Herbert Kilpin used as he founded AC Milan on 16 December 1899. Just a year and a half later, the Rossoneri became the champions of Italy for the first time after beating Genoa 3-0 at Ponte Carrega on 5 May 1901. The first celebration took place at AC Milan's first headquarters, the Fiaschetteria Toscana on Via Berchet in Milan, in 1899. Words, places and dates that gave rise to the Rossoneri’s glorious history. This is a Club that has contributed hugely to the world of football, so much so that AC Milan held the most international titles recognised by FIFA from December 2007 to February 2014. The Rossoneri’s history is now the stuff of legend, as are the men who have helped to write it – be they presidents, coaches or footballers. There have been so many historic figures, from the Englishman Alfred Edwards, under whom the Club won its first league title, and Andrea Rizzoli, the first President of AC Milan and an Italian team to win the European Cup in 1963 at Wembley, through to Silvio Berlusconi, the President who had the most success in Italy, Europe and throughout the world. It is also possible to recognise a great club through its playing culture in particular, by the style it promotes, by the way it carries itself, by the innovative drive given to it by its leaders. It’s no coincidence that various Rossoneri victories over various eras and different decades have brought about new visions about how football should be played. And those sitting on the AC Milan bench have been key to this: the greatest coaches of Italian football have all taken charge of the Rossoneri. Gipo Viani, Nereo Rocco and Nils Liedholm paved the way for Arrigo Sacchi, Fabio Capello and Carlo Ancelotti, the latter trio inheriting incredible legacies while looking to play a modern, spectacular brand of football. During the historic years under Berlusconi's presidency, Arrigo Sacchi was hugely successful and innovated not only thanks to great players, but also thanks to what could be considered as an extra man: the Game he played. Fabio Capello then took over, providing continuity as the winning culture continued. Under Sacchi, AC Milan won one Scudetto, two European Cups, two European Super Cups and two Intercontinental Cups, winning all the international finals they were involved in. And it was that extra man, the Game, that brought the best out of individuals and led to three Rossoneri players occupying the top three places in the Ballon d’Or in 1988 (Van Basten, Gullit and Rijkaard) and 1989 (Van Basten, Baresi and Rijkaard). Under Capello, AC Milan were the dominant team in Italy, winning four Scudetti in five seasons. However, success wasn't just limited to what they did at home, the team also remained a force to be reckoned with in Europe. The Rossoneri made it to three consecutive Champions League finals between 1993 and 1995, with the 1994 success in Athens against Barcelona being voted as the ‘Match of the Century' by AC Milan fans in the Club’s Centenary referendum. Such was the strength of the Rossoneri with Don Fabio at the helm, the team went 58 games unbeaten between May 1991 and March 1993, while Sebastiano Rossi went 929 minutes without conceding a goal during the 1993/94 season. Furthermore, the Diavolo won three league titles between 1992 and 1994 without being given a single penalty. Following Capello’s tenure, and after the Scudetto title won by Alberto Zaccheroni in his first season at the Club and Fatih Terim’s brief spell, the mantle was passed on to Carlo Ancelotti, with the Italian looking to emulate the success of the \"Immortals\" (of Arrigo Sacchi), of which he was a part, and the \"Invincibles\" of Fabio Capello. With King Carlo at the helm, more space had to be cleared in the Rossoneri’s trophy cabinet. In five seasons, Ancelotti won two Champions League titles, also reaching the final, semi-finals and quarter-finals in three other European campaigns. In the 2009/10 season, Coach Ancelotti was replaced by Leonardo. He remained AC Milan Coach for a year after having spent 13 years at the Club, initially as a player, then as a director as part of AC Milan's charity Fondazione Milan and also the technical sector. After Leonardo came Massimiliano Allegri, who had a fantastic team at his disposal for the 2010/11 season thanks to Ibrahimovic, Robinho and Boateng joining the Club in August 2010 and further reinforcements being added in January 2011. Under Coach Allegri, AC Milan won their 18th Scudetto and sixth Supercoppa Italiana, the latter of which was won against Inter in August 2011 at the Bird’s Nest in Beijing. After a further two and a half seasons, during which AC Milan finished second and third in Serie A, Clarence Seedorf took over the managerial hot-seat, another man who had previously shone in the Rossoneri shirt. Under Seedorf’s guidance, AC Milan picked up 35 points over the course of the second half of the 2013-2014 season. After previously scoring in all three of the Rossoneri’s 2007 finals against Liverpool, Sevilla and Boca Juniors, Filippo Inzaghi took charge of the First Team in 2014/15. Prior to this, he'd led the Primavera to Viareggio Cup success in February 2014. As for 2015/16, Sinisa Mihajlovic started the season in charge and guided the team to the Coppa Italia final before Cristian Brocchi was promoted from the Primavera to replace him by the end of the season. Come 2016/17, the Club's hierarchy once again wanted to turn the page, duly appointing Vincenzo Montella as the Rossoneri's new Coach. He subsequently guided the Rossoneri to Supercoppa Italiana success against Juventus on 23 December 2016 as Milan beat Juventus on penalties in Doha. Rino Gattuso was the next man to take the reins on 27 November 2017 – already a Rossoneri icon after winning 10 trophies with AC Milan from 2002 to 2011 (five in Italy and five on the international stage). The former Rossoneri midfielder guided the club to the Coppa Italia final and also ensured qualification to the Europa League on two separate occasions. The relationship between Gattuso and Casa Milan – which became the Rossoneri's new Headquarters at the start of the 2013/14 campaign – ended mutually in May 2019. From that moment on, the choice for the new Head Coach, guided by the sporting management represented by Zvonimir Boban and Paolo Maldini, was Marco Giampolo. His first game in the dugout for the Rossoneri came in the International Champions Cup during the summer of 2019, the season in which the Club celebrated its 120th anniversary. Our league campaign then got off to a slow start, and after three consecutive defeats to Inter, Torino and Fiorentina as well as a struggle to implement his new footballing philosophy, Marco Giampaolo left the Club. Stefano Pioli took over in his stead and did an excellent job in reforging the group and giving it a clear identity. Starting in June 2020, following the lockdown caused by the Covid-19 pandemic, the Rossoneri put together an important winning streak and managed to beat almost every opponent. The 2020/21 season was a rebirth for the Club, with the team performing extremely well in the league. AC Milan finished second on 79 points, having won 24 matches and qualified for the Champions League for the first time in seven years. The high point of 2021/22 was winning Serie A, the perfect prize for an ambitious project. First place, 86 points, 26 wins and 69 goals scored are just some of the numbers that contributed to AC Milan winning their 19th Scudetto. In 2022/23, despite being unable to retain the Scudetto, the Rossoneri continued to make strides forward, reaching the Champions League semi-finals for the first time in 16 years. 2023/24 ended with a second-place finish in the league, earning qualification to the Champions League and also the Supercoppa Italiana. The European campaign started off in the Champions League but, after finishing third in the group stages behind PSG and Borussia Dortmund, carried on in the Europa League, getting knocked out in the quarter-finals against Roma. At the end of the season, the Club and Stefano Pioli parted ways. On 13 June 2024, Paulo Fonseca was announced as the new head coach, the first Portuguese to be in the Rossoneri hotseat. The former Lille Coach's adventure only lasted a few months. On 30 December 2024, Sergio Conceição began his AC Milan adventure. Copyright © 2020 ACMilan.com. All rights reserved.

Penn State is CFP semifinals bound after defeating Boise State in the Fiesta Bowl. Next stop, Miami. The Nittany Lions will face Notre Dame in the Orange Bowl with a shot at the national championship game on the line. Neither squad has won the coveted title since the '80s, but for Penn State, the chance has been a long time coming. Under James Franklin, the Nittany Lions have been to the Big Ten Championship game just twice, losing this season's appearance but winning it in 2016. They've failed to make a bowl game just once (2020) but have finished third or higher in their conference eight times since 2014. Better late than never to come together. It wasn't the prettiest game, but Penn State will still more than effective against the Broncos, scoring in every frame. The squad needs to do that against Notre Dame, who greatly capitalized on Georgia's mistakes in the Sugar Bowl.

                "content": "🏆 Michael Adedokun, Kate Faasse 2024 MAC Hermann winners 🍊 Orange Bowl preview 🏟️ Cotton Bowl preview No. 6 Penn State and No. 7 Notre Dame matchup in the College Football Playoff semifinals. Here is everything you need to know about how to watch the game. Follow along here for live updates throughout the game The 91st Orange Bowl features two of the top defenses in the nation, with each team sitting top five in points allowed per game. The Nittany Lions are allowing 15.8 points, while the Irish sit two points ahead at 13.8. Penn State entered the playoffs as the six seed after losing its conference title game to Oregon, and Notre Dame is in the semifinals as the seven seed, not receiving an opportunity for a first-round bye as an independent program. Both teams have cruised to the semis, with Penn State beating SMU 38-10 and Boise State 31-14. The Irish took down Indiana in the first round 27-17 in a game that was not as close as the score indicates, before controlling two-seed Georgia 23-10 in the Sugar Bowl. Both teams are powered offensively by their ground games, with each averaging over 200 rushing yards per contest. Penn State is led by the two-headed running back attack of Kaytron Allen and Nicholas Singleton who each have posted over 1,000 yards on the ground this season. Notre Dame's rushing attack is led by workhorse Jeremiyah Love at running back and dual-threat quarterback Riley Leonard who sits second on the team in rushing with over 750 yards. There are two names to watch out for defensively for each team — Abdul Cater for PSU and Xavier Watts for ND. Carter, likely a first-round pick in the 2025 NFL Draft, is an explosive edge rusher for the Nittany Lions, tallying 11 sacks on the season. He went out with an apparent arm injury in the first half against Boise State, and his status remains unanswered heading into the weekend. Penn State will certainly hope for his return come next Thursday. Watts is a two-time All-American safety for the Irish, who leads his team with six interceptions and a forced fumble on the year. He is a quarterback's worst nightmare in the secondary, and Notre Dame will rely on him again in the Orange Bowl. Here is how the two teams matchup: Notre Dame and Penn State have faced off 19 times, with the series tied 9-9-1 all-time. The most recent matchup between the two powerhouses came in 2007, where the Nittany Lions prevailed 31-10. The two teams met every November between 1981 and 1992. They have only played twice (2006 and 2007) since the annual matchup concluded. Arguably the most memorable game between the two programs came in in the early 90s, in what is remembered as the 1992 Snow Bowl. No. 22 Penn State led No. 8 Notre Dame 16-9 with under 30 seconds to play on a snowy Saturday in South Bend. Irish quarterback Rick Mirer found future Pro Football Hall of Fame running back Jerome Bettis for six, and legendary Notre Dame head coach Lou Holtz went for two, sealing the win 17-16 on Nov. 14, 1992. The winner of the Orange Bowl will take the all-time series lead in the renewed rivalry. The winner of No. 6 Penn State and No. 7 Notre Dame will face the winner of No. 5 Texas and No. 8 Ohio State in the CFP national championship.",

                "content": "If not listed, please contact your TV provider. Two college football heavyweights will play Jan. 9 in the Orange Bowl with a spot in the College Football Playoff national championship game on the line as (6) Penn State and (7) Notre Dame square off for the first time since 2007. It will be the first postseason meeting between the Nittany Lions and Fighting Irish since the 1976 Gator Bowl. Notre Dame opened as a 1.5-point favorite as oddsmakers expect a low-scoring game with the total opening at 44.5 points. The matchups pits a pair of teams with clear similarities as both are led by elite rushing attacks and stout defenses. Both teams also won their first two CFP games by double-digits to silence questions over their championship bona fides. The all-time series between the teams is tied at 9-9-1, and both teams are jockeying for a chance to play for their first national title since the 1980s. Penn State stifled Boise State star running back Ashton Jeanty in a 31-14 win over the Broncos in a Fiesta Bowl quarterfinal victory, while Notre Dame outlasted SEC champion Georgia 23-14 in the Sugar Bowl. The Nittany Lions will have a two-day rest advantage on the Fighting Irish since the Sugar Bowl was delayed a day following a deadly terrorist attack in New Orleans early on New Year's Day. Ultimately, it's a matchup that looks relatively even on paper. Here's what to know about the Orange Bowl showdown. Notre Dame rallied from a stunning Week 2 home loss against Northern Illinois to win 10 straight games and close the regular season at 11-1. It dominated Indiana in the first round of the CFP and then outlasted Georgia in the semifinals behind a 2-0 edge in turnover margin and elite special teams play. The Fighting Irish's long journey back from early-season embarrassment came on the back of a vicious defense and an elite rushing attack led by a trio of dynamic playmakers. The leader of the group is Riley Leonard, who has infused Notre Dame's quarterback position with a level of dual-threat dynamism rarely seen from Fighting Irish QBs. The Duke transfer has already set a school record for most total touchdowns in his first season with Notre Dame and has proven his effectiveness as a passer, in addition to his elusiveness as a runner. Notre Dame lost star defensive lineman Rylie Mills for the rest of the season during the win over Indiana and has been without star cornerback Benjamin Morrison since October due to a hip injury. But despite the losses of those two stalwarts, the Fighting Irish still boast a strong rushing defense to counter Penn State's duo of star backs. There are anchors at all three levels, with senior Howard Cross III headlining the front, Jack Kiser patrolling the middle of the field at linebacker and ball-hawking safety Xavier Watts starring on the back end. At 38, Marcus Freeman is the youngest head coach remaining in the CFP, and he's shown the ability to motivate his team to perform in big moments. Perhaps no program in college football has benefitted more from conference consolidation and playoff expansion than Penn State. The Nittany Lions were left on the outside looking in at the four-team CFP on numerous occasions under 11th-year coach James Franklin. But with the Big Ten's eradication of divisions, the Nittany Lions got a balanced 2024 schedule and took advantage with an 11-1 regular season record that made them a lock for the 12-team field, even after a Big Ten Championship Game loss to Oregon. They then capitalized on a favorable bracket draw with impressive double-digit victories over SMU and Boise State. While the Nittany Lions are solid defensively, per usual, they've taken a step offensively this season under first-year coordinator Andy Kotelnicki. Running backs Kaytron Allen and Nick Singleton have each surpassed 1,000 yards rushing, and Penn State boasts the nation's top tight end in Tyler Warren. The 6-foot-6 wrecking ball has made 98 catches for 1,158 yards and eight touchdowns this season while adding 197 yards rushing and another four scores on the ground. Junior quarterback Drew Allar has made strides in his second season as the starter, registering 8.6 yards per attempt, which is up nearly two yards per attempt from 2023. Penn State is led defensively by star linebacker Abdul Carter, who has 22 tackles for loss and 11 sacks while emerging as a projected first-round pick in the 2025 NFL Draft. The secondary has ben solid as well, registering 18 interceptions, including six in the team's first two CFP games. Notre Dame used a kickoff return for a touchdown and costly Georgia turnovers to outlast Georgia in the Sugar Bowl. It was an impressive showing, but was it replicable? The Fighting Irish enter the Orange Bowl with two fewer days of rest than the Nittany Lions, and that could make a difference considering how physical this game will be. Penn State wants to run the football, and Notre Dame is still grappling with the absence of star defensive lineman Rylie Mills. The Nittany Lions have demonstrated offensive improvement this season under first-year coordinator Andy Kotelnicki and have enough versatility to keep the Fighting Irish off balance in what should be a tight game.

                "content": "Melvin Wayne Osmond (August 28, 1951 – January 1, 2025) was an American musician. He was the second-oldest of the original Osmond Brothers singers and the fourth-oldest of the nine Osmond children. Starting in 1958, Wayne and three of his brothers (Alan, Merrill, and Jay in their respective age orders) began singing as a barbershop quartet. They were later discovered in 1961 by Jay Emerson Williams, the father of Andy Williams, at a performance at Disneyland which was being filmed for the Disneyland After Dark episode of Walt Disney's Wonderful World of Color. In 1962, the four Osmonds were cast over a seven-year period on NBC's The Andy Williams Show, a musical variety program. After their early singles failed, MGM Records signed the band, inspired by the success of the Jackson 5, and sent them to Muscle Shoals. There, they recorded One Bad Apple, a song initially written for the Jacksons but rejected by their label.[2] Each of these four Osmond brothers were also cast in nine episodes of the 1963–1964 ABC Western series, The Travels of Jaimie McPheeters, with Wayne in the role of young Leviticus Kissel. In the band's rock formation, Osmond played guitar[3] and occasionally drums,[4] among many other instruments, with Osmond recalling shortly before his death that he learned to play eight instruments during his time with the band.[5] He was found to have perfect pitch.[3] His last intended appearance with the Osmonds was October 13, 2018; however, the four brothers performed as a group a year later at CBS daytime show The Talk, as a birthday present to their sister, Marie.[6][7] Osmond was born on August 28, 1951, to Olive May (née Davis; 1925–2004) and George Virl Osmond (1917–2007) in Ogden, Utah. He was the fourth oldest out of nine children.[8] Like the rest of his family, he was a member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints,[7] mainly because he \"like(d) being part of that organization,\" one that aligned with his personal values.[9] In 2004, he said of his faith: \"we have a very high moral and ethical code that we live by . . . it's not something that's forced upon us. Anyone can do what they want to; everyone has their free agency. In fact, that's God's greatest gift to mankind, his free agency.\"[9] He also noted that he had never felt substantial temptation to engage in the stereotypical sinful activities such as affairs, vulgar language or substance abuse.[9] On December 13, 1974, Osmond married Kathlyn White from Bountiful, Utah, a former Miss Davis County Fair and Miss Utah of 1974. They had five children, three daughters and two sons.[10][11] In the 1990s, Osmond moved to Branson, Missouri. In 1997, he was diagnosed with a brain tumor, which was successfully treated at the expense of his hearing; the treatment left Osmond nearly deaf and reliant on a cochlear implant.[12] He continued to tour and perform with Merrill and Jay (Alan had left the touring production due to multiple sclerosis)[9] until a stroke in 2012 left him unable to play guitar.[3] He held a pilot's license, from which he earned the nickname \"Wings,\" and continued to fly aircraft until mobility issues prevented him from doing so near the end of his life.[5] He also mentored Alan's son David Osmond, who had followed in the Osmond family musical tradition.[10] Osmond suffered another, more severe stroke and died at University of Utah Hospital in Salt Lake City, Utah, on January 1, 2025, at the age of 73. His wife and children were with him at the time of his death.[4][5][13] This article about an American musician is a stub. You can help Wikipedia by expanding it.",

                "title": "The Osmonds founding member Wayne Osmond is dead at 73 - The Washington Post",
                "content": "Donny Osmond, in a tribute on social media, described his brother and bandmate as the “ultimate optimist” and said his death was the result of a stroke. Wayne Osmond, a singer, guitarist and a founding member of the Osmonds family band, has died. He was 73. His brothers Donny and Merrill Osmond wrote on social media that the cause was a stroke. “Wayne brought so much light, laughter, and love to everyone who knew him, especially me. He was the ultimate optimist and was loved by everyone,” Donny Osmond wrote. “I’m sure I speak on behalf of every one of us siblings when I state that we were fortunate to have Wayne as a brother.” Merrill Osmond posted on social media: “I’ve never known a man that had more humility. A man with absolute no guile. An individual that was quick to forgive and had the ability to show unconditional love to everyone he ever met.” He described Mr. Osmond as “a genius in his ability to write music” who was able “to capture the hearts of millions of people and bring them closer to God.” Mr. Osmond was married to Kathlyn White and had five children, according to the Associated Press. Born in Ogden, Utah, Mr. Osmond was the fourth oldest of nine children and raised in a Mormon household. He made his debut on “The Andy Williams Show” in 1962 along with three of his brothers — Alan, Merrill and Jay — after they were discovered as children harmonizing in a barbershop quartet at Disneyland. The brothers became regulars and were soon joined by their brother Donny. On the show, they earned the nickname “one-take Osmonds” because of their professional approach and intense rehearsing, according to the Hollywood Walk of Fame. The clean-cut family act surged to fame in the early ’70s, clinching the top spot on the Billboard Hot 100 in 1971 with “One Bad Apple.” They went on to perform a wide variety of genres, including disco, rock and pop, and became known for songs such as “Crazy Horses” and “Down by the Lazy River.” Eventually, Donny and Marie, Mr. Osmond’s sister, took center stage. But after the Osmond family was bilked out of their fortune in the 1980s, the original quartet of brothers including Mr. Osmond, sang at county fairs, corporate retreats and casinos to help pay off the family’s debt, according to Utah’s Deseret News. While they didn’t have the success that Donny and Marie found, the foursome still drew crowds. In 1997, Mr. Osmond underwent surgery for a cancerous brain tumor and related treatments that resulted in significant hearing loss. He also suffered a stroke in 2012. Still, in 2018, Mr. Osmond struck an optimistic tone, telling Deseret News that being able to hear “is not all that it’s cracked up to be.” “My favorite thing now is to take care of my yard. I turn my hearing aids off, deaf as a doorknob, tune everything out, it’s really joyful.” In 2019, Mr. Osmond — alongside Alan, Merrill and Jay Osmond — gave what Marie Osmond described as their final live performance on “The Talk.” The Osmonds are said to have stayed true to their Mormon roots, not giving in to the usual temptations of the entertainment business, The Washington Post reported. Mr. Osmond said in a 2004 interview with Deseret News that in the early days, they even turned down songs that became hits because “the lyrics weren’t right.” “We’re Latter-day Saints, and we have a very high moral and ethical code that we live by … it’s not something that’s forced upon us,” he said. At the time of the interview, Mr. Osmond and his brothers Merrill and Jay were touring together as the Osmond Brothers, an act that Mr. Osmond said involved “a little bit of this and a little bit of that,” including rock-and-roll and “even a little bit of vaudeville.” “And every once in a while, I’ll sneak in a joke,” he said.",
