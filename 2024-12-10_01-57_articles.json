                "content": "Watch CBS News By Emily Mae Czachor, Jennifer Earl Updated on: December 9, 2024 / 11:27 AM EST / CBS News Mindy Kaling and Morris Chestnut announced the nominees for the 2025 Golden Globe Awards Monday morning, giving a preview of the upcoming awards season as they rolled out the list of nominations in each of the ceremony's 27 categories. Ten of the nominations were unveiled exclusively on \"CBS Mornings.\" \"Emilia Pérez,\" the French director Jacques Audiard's musical crime-thriller starring Zoe Saldaña and Selena Gomez, leads the Golden Globes nominations this year, with 10 nods overall for its acting, directing, writing and music. After that, the top film competitors were \"The Brutalist,\" with seven nominations, and \"Conclave,\" with six. Demi Moore and Margaret Qualley's buzzy body horror satire \"The Substance\" and the independent rom-com \"Anora\" followed with five nods each. \"The Bear,\" \"Only Murders in the Building\" and \"Shōgun\" — all from Hulu — emerged as frontrunners for television. \"The Bear\" earned five nominations, while the other two series each got four. The announcement capped a big year for TV and film. Over the summer, \"Inside Out 2\" topped \"Frozen 2\" to become the highest-grossing animated film ever. Meanwhile, Disney's \"Moana 2\" just set a Thanksgiving box office record while \"Wicked\" and \"Gladiator II\" battled for ticket sales. In 2024, \"Barbie\" and \"Succession\" were the major players — each tied with nine nominations, followed by \"Oppenheimer\" scoring eight. Nikki Glaser will be the first woman to solo host the Golden Globes, which will air live on CBS on Sunday, Jan. 5 at 8 p.m. ET and stream on Paramount+. Glaser called the opportunity \"scary\" but \"thrilling\" but said she was up to the challenge. \"I'm extremely appreciative of this role I play. It's the pinnacle of my career so far. I've reached my Everest in getting to host the Globes! I hope it's something I get to do again,\" Glaser told GoldenGlobes.com. Emily Mae Czachor is a reporter and news editor at CBSNews.com.

'The Bear' leads the TV noms, followed by 'Only Murders in the Building' and 'Shogun.' By Hilary Lewis, Kimberly Nordyke December 9, 2024 5:50am Emilia Pérez leads the the nominations for the 2025 Golden Globes, which were unveiled live at a press conference at the Beverly Hilton on Monday morning. The film scored 10 noms, more than any other title in film or TV. That breaks the record previously held by a comedy or musical motion picture, surpassing Barbie, which scored a total of nine noms last year. Emilia Pérez was followed on the film side by The Brutalist with seven noms, Conclave with six, and Anora and The Substance with five each. The Bear leads the TV nominees with five total mentions, followed by Only Murders in the Building and Shogun with four each. Related Stories Movies 'Anora' Named Best Picture by Los Angeles Film Critics Association Movies Hollywood Flashback: Nancy Hamilton Made Oscars History With 'Helen Keller in Her Story' Overall, Netflix leads all distributors with a total of 26 noms (13 in film, 23 in TV). A24 follows in film with 12 mentions, and HBO/Max comes in second in TV with 14. (Read more about the snubs and surprises as well as in-depth analysis of the noms.) Mindy Kaling (The Sex Lives of College Girls) and Morris Chestnut (Watson) revealed the nominees across 27 categories, with the announcement streamed live on CBS News’ website, YouTube channel and mobile app. The Golden Globes recognize achievements across film and TV, with categories for cinematic and box office achievement in film and best performance in stand-up comedy on television, which were introduced last year and are set to return this year. The award for best cinematic and box office achievement includes eight nominees chosen from films that achieved “a gross box office receipt total of at least $150 million, of which $100 million must come from the U.S. domestic box office, and/or obtain commensurate digital streaming viewership according to recognized trusted industry sources within the qualifying year,” according to the Globes’ eligibility rules. Films released after Nov. 22 through the end of the year “may qualify based on projected box office performance and/or streaming views from recognized industry sources.” Golden Globes voters will then determine the nominees and winners in this category “based on excellence” from among the films that meet the box office and streaming viewership criteria. For this category, the Golden Globes has this year partnered with data company Luminate, owned by Penske Media Eldridge, a joint venture between Penske Media Corporation and Eldridge that also owns The Hollywood Reporter and Golden Globes owner and producer Dick Clark Productions. Luminate will provide streaming viewership data for all submitted films in the cinematic and box office acheivement category, with analysis done via Luminate’s Streaming Viewership product. Best performance in stand-up comedy on television, recognizes comedians who gave “performances of traditional stand-up comedy of at least 30 consecutive minutes, other than roles in television series, limited series, anthology series or motion pictures made for television” on “a recognized media platform (individual social media accounts do not qualify),” according to awards rules. The 82nd annual Golden Globe Awards is set to air live from the Beverly Hilton on CBS and stream on Paramount+ on Sunday, Jan. 5, 2025 at 5 p.m. PT/8 p.m. ET. Nikki Glaser will host the 2025 Golden Globes, and Emmy-winning producers Glenn Weiss and Ricky Kirshner are set to serve as showrunners, for the second year in a row. It was previously announced that Viola Davis will receive the Cecil B. DeMille Award and Ted Danson will receive the Carol Burnett Award, which recognizes TV excellence. Both Glaser and Danson also received noms on Monday morning. The 2025 show will be the second consecutive Golden Globes to air on CBS after the Globes inked a five-year deal with the network. This is also the second Golden Globes since its longtime backer, the Hollywood Foreign Press Association, was replaced following the acquisition of all the HFPA’s assets, rights and properties by Dick Clark Productions and Eldridge. Dick Clark Productions now owns and produces the Golden Globe Awards. Instead of the HFPA, a racially and ethnically diverse group of voters — made up of journalists representing countries from around the world — selects the nominees and winners.

                "title": "Dave Parker - Wikipedia",
                "content": "David Gene Parker (born June 9, 1951), nicknamed \"the Cobra\",[1] is an American former professional baseball player. He played in Major League Baseball as a right fielder from 1973 to 1991. A seven-time All-Star, Parker won two National League batting titles and was the 1978 National League Most Valuable Player. He was a member of two World Series championship teams, winning with the Pittsburgh Pirates in 1979 and the Oakland Athletics in 1989. Parker was the second professional athlete to earn an average of $1 million per year, having signed a five-year, $5 million contract in January 1979. Parker's career achievements include 2,712 hits, 339 home runs, 1,493 runs batted in and a lifetime batting average of .290. Parker was also known as a solid defensive outfielder during the first half of his career with a powerful arm, winning three straight Gold Gloves during his prime. From 1975 to 1979, he threw out 72 runners, including 26 in 1977. In 2025, Parker will be inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame.[2] Parker grew up in Cincinnati near Crosley Field, where he learned to play baseball on the stadium's parking lots. His father, Dick Parker, was a shipping clerk in a foundry.[3] Dave Parker attended Courter Tech High School. He has said his favorite sport was football, and he starred at tailback but injured a knee in a game during his senior year and gave up the game. Also a baseball star, one of his fondest memories is playing at Western Hills High School (alma mater of Pete Rose), where he hit a home run that landed on the roof of a Frisch's restaurant.[4] In 1973, as a member of the Pirates Triple–A minor league affiliate, the Charleston Charlies, legend has it that Parker hit a home run that landed on a coal car on a passing train and the ball was later picked up in Columbus, Ohio.[5] However, in a 1975 interview, Parker stated, \"When I played for Charleston I always had the ambition to hit a home run onto a moving train. I really used to shoot for that. I hit a few on the tracks, but never as a train was going by.\"[6] He began his major league career on July 12, 1973, with the Pittsburgh Pirates, for whom he played from 1973 to 1983. His first full season came in 1975, when he led the National League in slugging percentage (.541) and finished third in NL MVP voting. In 1977, he was National League batting champion, a feat he repeated in 1978 when he was named the National League MVP. This was in spite of a collision at home plate with John Stearns during a game against the Mets on June 30, 1978, in which Parker fractured his jaw and cheekbone; he wore a specially constructed facemask in order to minimize his time away from the lineup.[7] The Pirates rewarded him with baseball's first million-dollar-per-year contract.[8][9] The following year, he was an instrumental part of the Pirates' World Series championship team.[10] During a game in 1979, a powerful hit he made to right field was very difficult to throw into the infield, because he had \"knocked the cover off the ball.\" One of the seams on the ball ruptured, making nearly half of the cover come loose.[11] Pirate fans angered by his million-dollar contract threw \"nuts and bolts and bullets and batteries\" at him, as pitcher Kent Tekulve stated. A typo in a news story made it appear they threw car batteries.[12] In 1981 at a point in his career when it looked as if he would one day rank among the game's all-time greats, Lawrence Ritter and Donald Honig included him in their book The 100 Greatest Baseball Players of All Time.[13] The authors, noting that Parker had succeeded Roberto Clemente at the position, wrote, \"Someone must have a fondness for right field in Pittsburgh.\" Parker took after his Pirates teammate Willie Stargell in warming up in the on-deck circle with a sledgehammer (when most batters would use a simple lead-weighted bat).[14] In the early 1980s, however, Parker's hitting suffered due to injuries, weight problems and his increasing cocaine use.[15] He became one of the central figures in a drug scandal that spread through the major leagues. At the end of the 1983 season, Parker became a free agent and signed with the Cincinnati Reds. In Cincinnati, his hometown, he returned to the form that made him an All-Star in Pittsburgh.[12] In 1985, he enjoyed his best season since he won the 1978 MVP with a .312 batting average and 34 home runs; he also led the National League with 125 RBIs, 42 doubles, 80 extra-base hits and 350 total bases. Parker finished second in 1985 MVP voting to Willie McGee. Parker was also the winner of the league's first-ever Home Run Derby in 1985. Following the season, Parker was among several players who testified against a dealer in the Pittsburgh drug trials. Named as \"regular users\", Parker and six other players were suspended for the following season. The sentences were commuted, however, in exchange for donating ten percent of their base salaries to drug-related community service, submitting to random drug testing, and contributing 100 hours of drug-related community service.[16][17] After the 1987 season, Cincinnati traded Parker to the Oakland Athletics for José Rijo and Tim Birtsas. In Oakland, Parker was able to extend his career by spending most of his time as a designated hitter. Although injuries and age caught up to him to a degree – he hit just .257 with 12 homers in 377 at-bats in 1988 and .264 with 22 homers in 553 at-bats in 1989 – his veteran leadership was a significant factor in the A's consecutive World Series appearances which included another World Series title for Parker 1989, exactly 10 years after his first one with the Pirates in '79. Parker signed with the Milwaukee Brewers for the 1990 season and had a solid year as the Brewers' DH with a .289 average and 21 home runs in 610 at-bats. He was even selected as a reserve for the 1990 All-Star Game. Milwaukee opted for youth however, at the end of the year and traded the aging Parker to the Angels for Dante Bichette. Parker's last season was 1991. He played for the California Angels until late in the season before being released. The Toronto Blue Jays then signed him as insurance for the pennant race, and Parker hit .333 in limited action. Since he was acquired too late in the season, he did not qualify for inclusion on the post-season roster and was unable to play in the American League Championship Series against the Minnesota Twins, which the Blue Jays lost in five games. Parker retired at end of the season. Parker has served as a first-base coach for the Anaheim Angels, a batting coach for the St. Louis Cardinals in 1998, and a special hitting instructor for Pittsburgh. He owned several Popeyes Chicken franchises in Cincinnati[18] until selling his interest in them in 2012 after 25 years.[19] Parker never got more than 24% of votes on Baseball Hall of Fame ballots, and his 15-year Baseball Writers' Association of America eligibility was exhausted on the 2011 ballot. Supporters of Parker's candidacy argue that his involvement with the Pittsburgh drug trials has contributed to his not being voted into the Hall of Fame, which may have also harmed the candidacies of Keith Hernandez (who never received more than 10.8% and fell off the writers' ballot on his ninth try) and Tim Raines (debuted at 24.3%, but was elected on his tenth year on the ballot), serving as a precursor to those listed on the Mitchell Report not being voted into the Hall of Fame due to steroid abuse.[20][21] Parker appeared on the Classic Baseball Era Committee's 2025 ballot and was elected with 87.5% of the vote on December 8, 2024. He will be formally inducted on July 27, 2025.[22][2] Parker has had both of his knees replaced due to injuries from his playing career.[23] In 2013, he confirmed to the Pittsburgh Tribune-Review that he had been diagnosed with Parkinson's disease.[24] He is involved in raising money to find a cure for Parkinson's disease through the Dave Parker 39 Foundation.[25] Parker has six children. He currently[when?] resides in Loveland, Ohio, near Cincinnati, with his wife, Kellye.[4][19] Parker was elected to the Reds Hall of Fame Class of 2014, which also included fellow Cincinnati natives Ron Oester and Ken Griffey Jr.[26] In 2012, he was inducted into the Cincinnati Public Schools Athletic Hall of Fame.[4] On September 3, 2022, he was inducted into the Pittsburgh Pirates Hall of Fame as part of its inaugural class.",

Right Fielder Right Fielder Games Birth year \"Cobra\" excelled at all phases of the game over his 19-year career. For a time, Dave Parker was the undisputed best player in Major League Baseball. And though his career took more than a few unexpected twists, the numbers Parker left behind tell the story of a player who could do it all. “I was a five-tool player,” Parker said. Parker played for the Pirates, Reds, Athletics, Brewers, Angels and Blue Jays during 19 big league seasons. Born June 9, 1951, in Calhoun, Miss., Parker grew up in Cincinnati and was a youth sports star until a knee injury sidelined him during his senior year of high school. As a result, the 6-foot-5 Parker fell to the 14th round of the big league draft. The Pittsburgh Pirates took a chance on Parker there, and soon Parker was tearing up Pittsburgh’s minor league system. By 1975, Parker found his way into the Pirates’ starting outfield. “I was born with everything except posi-traction,” Parker said as a young major leaguer. “And I’m working on that now.” In 1975, Parker hit .308 with 25 home runs, 101 RBI and a National League-best .541 slugging percentage, finishing third in the MVP voting. By 1977, Parker was the NL batting champion with a .338 average, an NL-best 215 hits, his first All-Star Game selection and his first Gold Glove Award. Next year, he was even better. In 1978, Parker won the NL MVP Award after leading the league with a .334 average, hitting 30 homers, driving in 117 runs and stealing 20 bases. And in 1979, Parker hit .310 with 25 homers and 94 RBI, winning his third Gold Glove Award, stealing another 20 bases and leading the Pirates to a World Series win over the Orioles. He even took home the All-Star Game MVP that summer after a nifty throwing exhibition that showed off his legendary arm. “I was the best player in the league,” Parker said. “I don’t think anybody could do everything the way I did.” Parker soon signed a contract making him one of baseball’s first million-dollar-a-year players, but starting in 1980 his numbers declined. By 1983, Parker drove in just 69 runs in 144 games and was the target of constant criticism in Pittsburgh. “For whatever reason, there was a lot of animosity against me in Pittsburgh,” Parker said. “I never knew where the animosity came from, because I think after Roberto Clemente’s death (in 1972) I played a major part of re-establishing baseball in Pittsburgh. I’d go out and play 110 percent all the time.” Parker left the Pirates after 1983, signing a free agent deal with his hometown Reds. In Cincinnati, Parker was reborn – averaging almost 27 homers and 110 RBI in his four seasons. In 1985, Parker finished second in the NL MVP voting after hitting 34 homers and driving in 125 runs. “When you have so many players, a Dave Parker is looked up to,” said Reds coach Tommy Helms, who was Parker’s teammate in Pittsburgh in 1976-77. “It’s a good situation.” Parker was 36 when his Reds’ deal ended, but the Oakland A’s came calling with their DH job. Parker was the A’s regular designated hitter in both 1988 and 1989, and in the latter year he hit 22 home runs and drove in 97 runs for the eventual World Champions. Parker had his last great year with the Brewers in 1990, hitting 21 homers and driving in 92 runs, then retired following the 1991 season. He finished with a .290 career average, 2,712 hits, 339 home runs and 1,493 RBI. He was named to seven All-Star teams and won three Gold Gloves Awards in right field.

                "content": "National Football League (1970–present) The Kansas City Chiefs are a professional American football team based in Kansas City, Missouri. The Chiefs compete in the National Football League (NFL) as a member of the American Football Conference (AFC) West division. The Chiefs started playing in 1959 as the Dallas Texans by businessman Lamar Hunt and was a charter member of the American Football League (AFL).[12] In 1963, the team moved to Kansas City,[13][14] and kept its current name.[15][16] The Chiefs joined the NFL as a result of the 1970 AFL–NFL merger; entering the 2024 season, the team is valued at over US$4.85 billion. After Hunt's death in 2006, his wife, Norma, and children became legal owners of the team. After Norma's death in 2023, the Hunt children inherited her stake in the franchise. Clark Hunt, one of the Hunts' children, has served as chairman and CEO since 2006 and is the ultimate authority over personnel decisions. He is also the team representative at league owner meetings. The Chiefs were victorious and won three AFL championships, in 1962, 1966, and 1969,[17][18] and were the second AFL team (after the New York Jets) to defeat an NFL team in a Super Bowl when they defeated the Minnesota Vikings in Super Bowl IV, which was the final game before the league merger went into full effect. The Chiefs were also the second team, after the Green Bay Packers (whom they played in Super Bowl I), to appear in more than one Super Bowl (and the first AFL team to do so) and the first to appear in the championship game in two different decades. Despite this post-season success, the team failed to find success in the playoffs for decades, including losing ten of eleven playoff games from 1993 to 2018, which included an eight-game losing streak. Since then, the Chiefs have risen to dynastic performance under head coach Andy Reid, quarterback Patrick Mahomes, tight end Travis Kelce, and defensive tackle Chris Jones, appearing in four Super Bowls since 2019 and being victorious in three: LIV, LVII, and LVIII.[19][20][21] In 1959, Lamar Hunt began discussions with other businessmen to establish a professional football league that would rival the National Football League.[17][22][23] Hunt's desire to secure a football team was heightened after watching the 1958 NFL Championship Game between the New York Giants and Baltimore Colts.[22][24] After unsuccessful attempts to purchase and relocate the NFL's Chicago Cardinals to his hometown of Dallas, Texas,[17][25] Hunt went to the NFL and asked to create an expansion franchise in Dallas. The NFL turned him down, so Hunt then established the American Football League and started his own team, the Dallas Texans, to begin play in 1960. Hunt hired a little-known assistant coach from the University of Miami football team, Hank Stram, to be the team's head coach[22] after the job offer was declined by Bud Wilkinson and Tom Landry.[22] After Stram was hired, Don Klosterman was hired as head scout, and was credited by many for bringing a wealth of talent to the Texans after luring it away from the NFL, often hiding players and using creative means to land them. The Texans shared the Cotton Bowl with the NFL's Dallas Cowboys for three seasons. The Texans were to have exclusive access to the stadium until the NFL put an expansion team, the Dallas Cowboys, there.[22] While the team averaged a league-best 24,500 at the Cotton Bowl, the Texans gained less attention due to the AFL's relatively lower profile compared to the NFL's.[22] In the franchise's first two seasons, the team managed only an 8–6 and 6–8 record, respectively.[26] In their third season, the Texans tallied an 11–3 record and a berth in the team's first American Football League Championship Game, against the Houston Oilers.[25][26] The game was broadcast nationally on ABC and the Texans defeated the Oilers 20–17 in double overtime.[25] The game lasted 77 minutes and 54 seconds, which, at the time, was the longest game in the history of professional American Football. It is still the longest championship game in American Football League history.[25] It turned out to be the last game the team would play as the Dallas Texans. Despite competing against a Cowboys team that managed only a 9–28–3 record in their first three seasons, Hunt decided that the Dallas–Fort Worth media market just couldn't sustain two professional football franchises.[25][27] He considered moving the Texans to either Atlanta or Miami for the 1963 season.[25] He was ultimately swayed by an offer from Kansas City Mayor Harold Roe Bartle.[25][27][28] Bartle promised to triple the franchise's season ticket sales and expand the seating capacity of Municipal Stadium to accommodate the team.[25][27][28] Hunt agreed to relocate the franchise to Kansas City on May 22, 1963,[13][14] and on May 26, the team was renamed the Kansas City Chiefs.[15][25][27][28] Hunt and head coach Hank Stram initially planned to retain the Texans name, but a fan contest determined the new \"Chiefs\" name in honor of Mayor Bartle's nickname that he acquired in his professional role as Scout Executive of the St. Joseph and Kansas City Boy Scout Councils, and founder of the Scouting Society, the Tribe of Mic-O-Say.[25][28] Despite the historical use of Native American features, it has been acknowledged that the team's naming was not a direct reference to Native Americans but only to Bartle's nickname \"Chief\".[29][30] Business Insider journalist Meredith Cash even stated in January 2020 that Bartle \"insisted on the team being named after himself\" and that \"Bartle was known as Chief Lone Bear within Mic-O-Say circles, and eventually the nickname \"Chief\" caught on among people throughout Kansas City.\"[31] The franchise became one of the strongest teams in the now thriving American Football League,[17] with the most playoff appearances for an AFL team (tied with the Oakland Raiders), and the most AFL Championships (three).[25] The team's dominance helped Lamar Hunt become a central figure in negotiations with NFL Commissioner Pete Rozelle to agree on an AFL–NFL merger.[25][32] In the meetings between the two leagues, a merged league championship game was agreed to be played in January 1967 following the conclusion of the leagues' respective 1966 seasons. Hunt insisted on calling the game the \"Super Bowl\" after seeing his children playing with a popular toy at the time, a Super Ball.[25][32][33] While the first few games were designated the \"AFL–NFL World Championship Game\", the Super Bowl name became its officially licensed title in years to come.[34] The Chiefs cruised to an 11–2–1 record in 1966, and defeated the defending AFL Champion Buffalo Bills in the AFL Championship Game.[35] The Chiefs were invited to play the NFL's league champion Green Bay Packers in the first AFL–NFL World Championship Game. Kansas City and Green Bay played a close game for the first half, but Green Bay took control in the final two quarters, winning the game by a score of 35–10.[36] The Chiefs lost the game but gained the respect of several Packers opponents following the game.[37] The Chiefs' inter-league match-up with the Packers was not the last time that they would face an NFL opponent, especially on the championship stage.[25] The following August, Kansas City hosted the NFL's Chicago Bears in the 1967 preseason and won the game 66–24.[25] Despite losing to the division rival Oakland Raiders twice in the regular season in 1969, the two teams met for a third time in the AFL Championship Game, where Kansas City won 17–7.[26] Backup quarterback Mike Livingston led the team in a six-game winning streak after Len Dawson suffered a leg injury which kept him out of most of the season's games.[25] While getting plenty of help from the club's defense, Dawson returned from the injury and led the Chiefs to Super Bowl IV.[25] Against the NFL champion Minnesota Vikings,[17] who were favored by 12+1⁄2, the Chiefs dominated the game 23–7 to claim the team's first Super Bowl championship.[25] Dawson was named the game's Most Valuable Player after completing 12-of-17 passes for 142 yards and one touchdown, with 1 interception.[38] The following season, the Chiefs and the rest of the American Football League merged with the National Football League after the AFL–NFL merger became official.[25] The Chiefs were placed in the American Football Conference's West Division.[26] From 1960 to 1969, the Chiefs/Texans won 87 games, which is the most in the ten-year history of the AFL.[39] In 1970, the Chiefs went 7–5–2 and missed the playoffs.[40] The following season, the Chiefs tallied a 10–3–1 record and won the AFC West Division.[41] Head coach Hank Stram considered his 1971 Chiefs team as his best, but they failed to capture their championship dominance from 1969.[41] Most of the pieces of the team which won Super Bowl IV two years earlier were still in place for the 1971 season.[41] The Chiefs tied with the Miami Dolphins for the best record in the AFC, and both teams met in a Christmas Day playoff game which the Chiefs lost 27–24 in double overtime.[41] The Dolphins outlasted the Chiefs with a 37-yard field goal.[41] The game surpassed the 1962 AFL Championship Game as the longest ever at 82 minutes and 40 seconds.[41] The game was also the final football game at Kansas City's Municipal Stadium.[41] In 1972, the Chiefs moved into the newly constructed Arrowhead Stadium at the Truman Sports Complex outside of downtown Kansas City.[41] The team's first game at Arrowhead was against the St. Louis Cardinals, a preseason game that the Chiefs won 24–14.[41] Linebacker Willie Lanier and quarterback Len Dawson won the NFL Man of the Year Award in 1972 and 1973, respectively.[42] The Chiefs did not return to the post-season for the remainder of the 1970s, and the 1973 season was the team's last winning season for seven years.[41] Hank Stram was fired following a 5–9 season in 1974, and many of the Chiefs' future Hall of Fame players departed by the middle of the decade.[41] From 1975 to 1988, the Chiefs had become a team that rarely won, which provided Chiefs fans with nothing but futility.[43][44] Five head coaches struggled to achieve the same success as Stram, compiling an 81–121–1 record.[43] In 1980, Coach Marv Levy cut future Hall of Fame Kicker Jan Stenerud for little-known Nick Lowery, who would become the most accurate kicker in NFL history over the next fourteen years. In 1981, running back Joe Delaney rushed for 1,121 yards and was named the AFC Rookie of the Year.[45] The Chiefs finished the season with a 9–7 record and entered the 1982 season with optimism.[45] The NFL Players Association strike curbed the Chiefs' chances of returning to the postseason for the first time in over a decade.[45] The Chiefs tallied a 3–6 record[26] and in the off-season, Joe Delaney died while trying to save several children from drowning in a pond near his home in Louisiana.[46] The Chiefs drafted quarterback Todd Blackledge over future greats such as Jim Kelly and Dan Marino in the 1983 NFL draft.[47][48] Blackledge never started a full season for Kansas City while Kelly and Marino played Hall of Fame careers.[48] While the Chiefs struggled on offense in the 1980s, they had a strong defensive unit consisting of Pro Bowlers such as Bill Maas, Albert Lewis, Art Still and Deron Cherry.[45] John Mackovic took over head coaching duties for the 1983 season after Marv Levy was fired.[45] Over the next four seasons, Mackovic coached the Chiefs to a 30–34 record, but took the team to its first postseason appearance in 15 years in the 1986 NFL playoffs.[26] They lost to the New York Jets in the wild-card round.[45] Despite leading the Chiefs to only their third winning season and second playoff appearance since the merger, Mackovic was fired for what Hunt described as a lack of chemistry.[49] Frank Gansz served as head coach for the next two seasons, but won only eight of 31 games.[50][51] On December 19, 1988, owner Lamar Hunt hired Carl Peterson as the team's new president, general manager, and chief executive officer. Peterson fired head coach Frank Gansz two weeks after taking over and hired Marty Schottenheimer as the club's seventh head coach.[45] In the 1988 and 1989 NFL Drafts, the Chiefs selected both defensive end Neil Smith and linebacker Derrick Thomas, respectively.[45][53] The defense that Thomas and Smith anchored in their seven seasons together was a big reason why the Chiefs reached the postseason in six straight years.[54] In Schottenheimer's ten-season tenure as head coach, the Chiefs became a perennial playoff contender, featuring offensive players including Steve DeBerg, Christian Okoye, Stephone Paige and Barry Word, a strong defense, anchored by Thomas, Smith, Albert Lewis and Deron Cherry, and on special teams, Nick Lowery, who was then the most accurate kicker in NFL History.[17] The team recorded a 101–58–1 record, and clinched seven playoff berths.[55] The Chiefs' 1993 season was the franchise's most successful in 22 years.[53] With newly acquired quarterback Joe Montana and running back Marcus Allen, two former Super Bowl champions and Most Valuable Player Award winners, the Chiefs further strengthened their position in the NFL.[53] The 11–5 Chiefs defeated the Pittsburgh Steelers and Houston Oilers on their way to the franchise's first AFC Championship Game appearance against the Buffalo Bills.[53] The Chiefs were overwhelmed by the Bills and lost the game by a score of 30–13.[53] The Chiefs' victory on January 16, 1994, against the Oilers remained the franchise's last post-season victory for 22 years until their 30–0 victory over the Houston Texans on January 9, 2016.[56] In the 1995 NFL playoffs, the 13–3 Chiefs hosted the Indianapolis Colts in a cold, damp late afternoon game at Arrowhead Stadium.[26][53] Kansas City lost the game 10–7 against the underdog Colts, after kicker Lin Elliot missed three field-goal attempts and quarterback Steve Bono threw three interceptions.[53] The Chiefs selected tight end Tony Gonzalez with the 13th overall selection in the 1997 NFL draft, a move which some considered to be a gamble being that Gonzalez was primarily a basketball player at California. During a 1997 season full of injuries to starting quarterback Elvis Grbac, backup quarterback Rich Gannon took the reins of the Chiefs' offense as the team headed to another 13–3 season.[26][53] Head coach Marty Schottenheimer chose Grbac to start the playoff game against the Denver Broncos despite Gannon's successes in previous weeks.[53] Grbac's production in the game was lacking, and the Chiefs lost to the Broncos 14–10.[53] Denver went on to capture their fifth AFC Championship by defeating Pittsburgh, and then defeated the Green Bay Packers in Super Bowl XXXII. Coach Schottenheimer announced his resignation from the Chiefs following the 1998 season.[57] Following Schottenheimer's resignation, defensive coordinator Gunther Cunningham took over coaching duties for the next two seasons, compiling a 16–16 record.[53] By the end of the Chiefs' decade of regular-season dominance, Gannon had signed with the Oakland Raiders, Neil Smith signed with the Denver Broncos, and Derrick Thomas was paralyzed in a car accident on January 23, 2000.[53] Thomas died from complications of his injury weeks later.[53] After allegedly reading online that he would be relieved of duties, head coach Gunther Cunningham was fired.[58][59] Looking to change the Chiefs' game plan which relied on a tough defensive strategy for the past decade, Carl Peterson contacted Dick Vermeil about the Chiefs' head coaching vacancy for the 2001 season.[58] Vermeil previously led the St. Louis Rams to a victory in Super Bowl XXXIV.[59] Vermeil was hired on January 12.[60] The Chiefs then traded a first-round draft pick in the 2001 NFL draft to St. Louis for quarterback Trent Green and signed free agent running back Priest Holmes to be the team's cornerstones on offense.[61][62] In Vermeil's first season with the Chiefs, he led the team to a 6–10 record.[63] The team improved to a 8–8 record in 2002 but still missed the postseason.[64] In 2003, Kansas City began the season with nine consecutive victories, a franchise record.[65] They finished the season with a 13–3 record and the team's offense led the NFL in several categories under the direction of USA Today's Offensive Coach of the Year honoree, Al Saunders.[59] Running back Priest Holmes surpassed Marshall Faulk's single-season touchdown record by scoring his 27th rushing touchdown against the Chicago Bears in the team's regular-season finale.[59][66] The team clinched the second seed in the 2003 NFL playoffs and hosted the Indianapolis Colts in the AFC Divisional Playoffs.[67] In a game where neither team punted, the Chiefs lost the shoot-out 38–31.[68] It was the third time in nine seasons that the Chiefs went 8–0 at home in the regular season, only to lose their post-season opener at Arrowhead. After a disappointing 7–9 record in 2004, the 2005 Chiefs finished with a 10–6 record but no playoff berth.[69][70] They were the fourth team since 1990 to miss the playoffs with a 10–6 record.[59] Running back Larry Johnson started in place of the injured Priest Holmes and rushed for 1,750 yards in only nine starts.[71] Prior to the Chiefs' final game of the season, head coach Dick Vermeil announced his retirement.[72] The Chiefs won the game 37–3 over the playoff-bound Cincinnati Bengals.[73] Within two weeks of Vermeil's retirement, the Chiefs returned to their defensive roots with the selection of its next head coach.[59] The team introduced Herm Edwards, a former Chiefs scout and head coach of the New York Jets, as the team's tenth head coach after trading a fourth-round selection in the 2006 NFL draft to the Jets.[74] Quarterback Trent Green suffered a severe concussion in the team's season opener to the Cincinnati Bengals which left him out of play for eight weeks.[75] Backup quarterback Damon Huard took over in Green's absence and led the Chiefs to a 5–3 record.[76] Kansas City was awarded a Thanksgiving Day game against the Denver Broncos in response to owner Lamar Hunt's lobbying for a third Thanksgiving Day game.[59] The Chiefs defeated the Broncos 19–10 in the first Thanksgiving Day game in Kansas City since 1969.[59] Hunt was hospitalized at the time of the game and died weeks later on December 13 due to complications of prostate cancer.[32][59] The Chiefs honored their owner for the remainder of the season, as did the rest of the league.[59] Trent Green returned in the middle of the season, but struggled in the final stretch,[59] and running back Larry Johnson set an NFL record with 416 carries in a season.[77] Kansas City managed to clinch their first playoff berth in three seasons with a 9–7 record and a bizarre sequence of six losses from other AFC teams on New Year's Eve, culminating with a Broncos loss to the 49ers.[59] The Indianapolis Colts hosted the Chiefs in the Wild Card playoffs and defeated Kansas City 23–8.[78] In 2007, Trent Green was traded to the Miami Dolphins[79] leaving the door open for either Damon Huard or Brodie Croyle to become the new starting quarterback.[59] After starting the season with a 4–3 record, the Chiefs lost the remaining nine games when running back Larry Johnson suffered a season-ending foot injury and the quarterback position lacked stability with Huard and Croyle.[59] Despite the team's 4–12 record, tight end Tony Gonzalez broke Shannon Sharpe's NFL record for touchdowns at the position (63) and defensive end Jared Allen led the NFL in quarterback sacks with 15.5.[80][81] The Chiefs began their 2008 season with the youngest team in the NFL.[82] The starting lineup had an average of 25.5 years of age.[82] By releasing several veteran players such as cornerback Ty Law and wide receiver Eddie Kennison and trading defensive end Jared Allen,[83] the Chiefs began a youth movement.[82][84] The Chiefs had a league-high thirteen selections in the 2008 NFL draft and chose defensive tackle Glenn Dorsey and offensive lineman Branden Albert in the first round. Analysts quickly called Kansas City's selections as the best of the entire draft.[83][85][86][87] Entering the season, the Chiefs were unsure if injury-prone quarterback Brodie Croyle, who was the incumbent starter, could be their quarterback in the long-term.[87] Croyle was injured in the team's first game of the season and Damon Huard started in Croyle's absence.[88] Tyler Thigpen become the third Chiefs starting quarterback in as many games for a start against the Atlanta Falcons.[89][90] After a poor performance by Thigpen, in which he threw three interceptions against the Falcons defense,[90] Huard was retained as the starting quarterback.[91] The Chiefs struggled off the field as much as on as tight end Tony Gonzalez demanded a trade and running back Larry Johnson was involved in legal trouble.[92][93][94][95] Croyle returned for the Chiefs' game against the Tennessee Titans, but both he and Damon Huard suffered season-ending injuries in the game.[96] The Chiefs reorganized their offense to a new spread offense game plan focused around Tyler Thigpen.[84][88][97][98] The Chiefs' new offense was implemented to help Thigpen play to the best of his abilities and also following the absence of Larry Johnson, who was suspended for his off-field conduct.[93][97][98][99] The Chiefs made a huge gamble by using the spread offense, as most in the NFL believe that it cannot work in professional football, and also head coach Herm Edwards was traditionally in favor of more conservative, run-oriented game plans.[98] The 2008 season ended with a franchise worst 2–14 record, where the team suffered historic blowout defeats nearly week-in and week-out,[26][90][100] a 34–0 shut-out to the Carolina Panthers,[101] and allowed a franchise-high 54 points against the Buffalo Bills.[102] The team's general manager, chief executive officer, and team president Carl Peterson resigned at the end of the season,[103] and former New England Patriots vice president of player personnel Scott Pioli was hired as his replacement for 2009.[104] On January 23, 2009, Herm Edwards was fired as head coach,[105][106] and two weeks later Todd Haley signed a four-year contract to become Edwards' successor.[107][108] Haley had a background with Pioli, which made him an attractive hire for Pioli's first coach in Kansas City. In April 2009, Tony Gonzalez was traded to the Atlanta Falcons after failed trade attempts over the previous two seasons.[109] Notably, head coach Todd Haley fired offensive coordinator Chan Gailey just weeks before the start of the 2009 season and chose to take on the coordinator duties himself. Throughout 2009 the Chiefs acquired veterans to supplement the Chiefs' young talent including Matt Cassel, Mike Vrabel, Bobby Engram, Mike Brown, Chris Chambers, and Andy Alleman.[110][111][112] The team finished with a 4–12 record, just a two-game improvement upon their record from the 2008 season. For the 2010 season, the Chiefs made significant hires for their coaching staff, bringing on former Patriots assistant coaches Charlie Weis and Romeo Crennel to coach the offense and defense, respectively.[113] The coaching additions proved to be very successful, as the Chiefs would go on to secure their first AFC West title since 2003. Their ten victories in the 2010 season combined for as many as the team had won in their previous three seasons combined.[114] On January 9, 2011, the Chiefs lost their home Wild Card playoff game to the Baltimore Ravens 30–7.[115] Six players were chosen for the Pro Bowl: Dwayne Bowe, Jamaal Charles, Brian Waters, Tamba Hali, Matt Cassel, and rookie safety Eric Berry. Jamaal Charles won the FEDEX ground player of the year award and Dwayne Bowe led the NFL in touchdown receptions.[116] For their first pick in the 2011 NFL draft, the team selected Jon Baldwin.[117] After a poor start, Haley was relieved of duties as head coach on December 12. Clark Hunt made note of \"bright spots at different points this season,\" but felt that overall the Chiefs were not progressing.[118] The highest point of the 2011 season was an upset win against the Packers, who at that time, were undefeated with a 13–0 record.[119] Defensive coordinator Romeo Crennel would be named the team's interim head coach for the remaining three games of the season, including the aforementioned Packers game.[120] On January 9, 2012, Crennel was named the 11th full-time head coach in Chiefs history.[121] The 2012 Chiefs became the first team since the 1929 Buffalo Bisons to not lead in regulation through any of their first nine games.[122] The Chiefs tied their franchise-worst record of 2–14 and clinched the No. 1 overall pick in the 2013 NFL draft.[123] It is the first time since the merger they have held the first overall pick.[124] Following the 2012 season, the Chiefs fired head coach Romeo Crennel and general manager Scott Pioli.[125][126] Former Philadelphia Eagles head coach Andy Reid was brought in as head coach to work with new general manager John Dorsey, a former Green Bay Packers head scout.[127][128] The Chiefs acquired quarterback Alex Smith from the San Francisco 49ers for the Chiefs' second-round pick, 34th overall, in the 2013 draft and a conditional pick in the 2014 draft.[129] Matt Cassel was released shortly after.[130] The Chiefs selected Eric Fisher with the first overall pick of the 2013 NFL draft.[131] In 2013, the Chiefs started 9–0 for the second time in team history.[132] The team finished with a 11–5 record and made the playoffs.[133] They led in their wildcard game against the Indianapolis Colts 38–10 shortly after halftime, but collapsed late and lost 45–44.[134] In 2014, the Chiefs attempted to make the playoffs for the second straight season for the first time since 1995, finishing 9–7 and getting eliminated in Week 17.[135] After a promising win for the Chiefs against Houston in Week 1, Kansas City went on a five-game losing streak culminating in a 16–10 loss to Minnesota and the loss of Jamaal Charles to a torn ACL.[136] They made one of the most improbable season comebacks in the NFL and won ten straight to improve their record from 1–5 to 11–5. The team clinched a playoff berth after a 17–13 win over Cleveland in Week 16 to become only the second post-merger NFL team to make the playoffs following a 1–5 start.[137] The streak achieved by the Chiefs broke a franchise record for nine straight (2003, 2013) and second nine plus game win streak under Reid. After a Week 17 win over Oakland 23–17, the Chiefs achieved their longest winning streak in franchise history at ten games. They qualified for the playoffs, playing in the 2015 AFC Wild-Card playoff game, held at NRG Stadium in Houston, Texas on January 9, 2016. The Chiefs defeated the Houston Texans 30–0 to earn their first NFL playoff win in 23 seasons, dating back to the 1993–94 NFL playoffs, a win that also came in Houston. The Chiefs' Wild-Card playoff victory ended what was at the time the third-longest drought in the NFL, and it also ended a then NFL record eight-game playoff losing streak.[138] Riddled with injuries, they were defeated by the New England Patriots 27–20 in the AFC Divisional Round.[139] The Chiefs first game of the 2016 season was against their division rival, the San Diego Chargers. After facing a 24–3 deficit with six minutes left in the 3rd quarter, the Chiefs engineered a 33–27 comeback win ending with a two-yard touchdown run by Alex Smith in overtime to give the Chiefs their largest regular season comeback to start the season at 1–0.[140] On Christmas Day, the Chiefs defeated the Denver Broncos 33–10 to give Kansas City their tenth straight win against divisional opponents. On January 1, 2017, the Chiefs clinched the AFC West and the second seed going into the playoffs that year, where they fell to the Pittsburgh Steelers 18–16 in the divisional round as Chris Boswell hit six field goals.[141] The Chiefs finished the 2017 season with a 10–6 record, and won the AFC West.[142] This was the first time in Chiefs history that they won the AFC West in back-to-back years.[143] In the Wild Card round, the Chiefs lost a tight game to the Tennessee Titans 22–21, allowing Derrick Henry to rush for 156 yards. The loss extended their NFL record for most consecutive home playoff losses to six.[144] The game marked the end of Alex Smith's five-year tenure with the Chiefs, as he was traded to the Washington Redskins a few weeks later.[145] Patrick Mahomes made his NFL debut and first career start in the December 31, 2017, game against the Denver Broncos. The Chiefs won the game 27–24, with Mahomes going 22 for 35 with 284 yards and one interception.[146] The Chiefs began the 2018 season with first-year starter Mahomes as their quarterback and finished the regular season with a record of 12–4, clinching the AFC West for the third year in a row and the AFC's top seed. This included victories over division rivals Los Angeles Chargers, Oakland Raiders and Denver Broncos (twice), along with important conference victories over the Pittsburgh Steelers, Cincinnati Bengals, and Jacksonville Jaguars. Their first loss of the season came at the hands of the New England Patriots with a last-second field goal.[147] Their second loss of the season came against the Los Angeles Rams with a final score of 51–54, in which the Kansas City Chiefs made history by becoming the first NFL team to lose a game after scoring more than 50 points.[148] Mahomes finished the season with 5,097 yards and 50 touchdowns, both team records.[149] He became the 11th quarterback to throw for 5,000 yards and the third to throw for 50 touchdowns.[150] He joined Peyton Manning as only the 2nd player in NFL history to throw for 5,000 yards and 50 touchdowns.[151] For his performance during the season, he was named AP NFL MVP, the first Chief to ever win the award.[152] In the AFC Divisional round on January 12, 2019, the Chiefs defeated the Indianapolis Colts 31–13 to move on to the AFC Championship Game.[153] This marked the Chiefs' first playoff win in Arrowhead Stadium in 25 years.[154] This also enabled the Chiefs to host the AFC Championship Game for the first time ever.[155] The next week, Kansas City's bid for its first Super Bowl berth in 49 years ended with a 37–31 overtime loss to the New England Patriots.[156] The Chiefs finished the 2019 regular season with a 12–4 record, winning the AFC West division title for the fourth straight year, and clinched the AFC's second seed behind the Baltimore Ravens.[157] The Chiefs defeated the Houston Texans 51–31 in the AFC Divisional Game after falling behind 24–0 at the start of the second quarter with Mahomes throwing for five touchdowns.[158] The Chiefs hosted their second AFC Championship game in consecutive years facing the sixth-seed Tennessee Titans. The Chiefs then defeated the Titans 35–24 and advanced to Super Bowl LIV.[159] This marked their first Super Bowl appearance in 50 years, since Super Bowl IV.[160] On February 2, 2020, in Hard Rock Stadium in Miami Gardens, Florida, the Chiefs played against the NFC's top seed, the San Francisco 49ers. Following halftime when both teams were tied at ten points, Mahomes threw 2 interceptions in back to back drives in the 3rd and 4th quarters, resulting in the 49ers having a 20–10 lead with under 12 minutes remaining in the game. Sparked by a 44-yard completion to Tyreek Hill on 3rd and 15, the Chiefs scored touchdowns on their next two possessions, with Mahomes throwing touchdowns to Travis Kelce and Damien Williams.[161] With a 24–20 lead with under two minutes remaining, Williams had a 38-yard touchdown run to effectively seal the game for the Chiefs. This marked the first time in NFL postseason history that a team faced ten point deficits in three straight games and won all three by double-digit margins. Mahomes won the Super Bowl Most Valuable Player Award, ending the Chiefs' Super Bowl drought dating back to the AFL-NFL Merger.[162] On July 6, 2020, Mahomes signed a record ten–year, $503 million contract extension keeping him under contract until the conclusion of the 2031 season. The contract is the largest ever signed in North American sports, more than tripling the value of the previous largest contract signed (although said contract was for a shorter 5 years, signed by Matt Ryan of the Atlanta Falcons).[163] With their week 14 victory over the Miami Dolphins, the Chiefs clinched their fifth consecutive division title. The victory also gave the Chiefs their first 12–1 record in franchise history. They would later win 14 games for the first time in franchise history. In the playoffs they defeated the Cleveland Browns and Buffalo Bills to win the AFC Championship for the second consecutive year.[164][165] The Chiefs would face the Tampa Bay Buccaneers in Super Bowl LV at Raymond James Stadium in Tampa, ultimately losing 9–31, failing to score a touchdown in the game.[166] In their 2021 season, the Chiefs beat the Pittsburgh Steelers 36–10, earning the team's sixth straight AFC West title on December 26, 2021.[167] The Chiefs began their playoff slate with a win against the Pittsburgh Steelers in the Wild Card round, and advanced to play the Buffalo Bills in the divisional round. Their 42–36 victory over Buffalo came in a game sports commentators and analysts dubbed as one of the greatest modern day NFL playoff games.[168][169][170][171][172][173] Despite being the first team to host the AFC Championship game for four consecutive seasons, the team finished the season losing 24–27 in overtime to the Cincinnati Bengals. The Chiefs began their 2022 season by trading Tyreek Hill to the Miami Dolphins,[174] and instead opting to stock up on picks in the 2022 NFL draft. They finished the season with a 14–3 regular season record, with losses coming from the Colts, Bills, and Bengals. All three losses were by margins of less than four points. The Chiefs won their seventh consecutive AFC West division championship, and secured the #1 seed in the AFC playoffs.[175] The team hosted their fifth consecutive AFC Championship Game,[176] and second consecutive against the Cincinnati Bengals, winning 23–20 on a game-winning field goal from Harrison Butker.[177] In Super Bowl LVII, the Chiefs defeated the Philadelphia Eagles 38–35 again on a field goal from Butker.[178] With the victory, Mahomes became the first player since Kurt Warner in 1999 to win both the NFL MVP Award and Super Bowl MVP Award in the same season.[179] Head coach Andy Reid won his second Super Bowl championship over the Eagles, the team he had previously led to a Super Bowl appearance.[180] Entering the 2023 season as defending champions, the Chiefs failed to improve on their 14–3 record from the previous season, despite this they secured their eleventh consecutive winning season and became division champions for the eighth consecutive season.[181][182][183] Their overall record was 11–6, their least successful record under quarterback Patrick Mahomes. In the playoffs, the Chiefs defeated the Miami Dolphins 26–7 in the wildcard round in frigid weather. In the divisional round, the team held on to a narrow 27–24 win over the Buffalo Bills on the road. This was the Chiefs third playoff win in four years over the Bills. They made their sixth consecutive AFC Championship Game appearance, but their first on the road, defeating the Baltimore Ravens 17–10 to advance to their fourth Super Bowl in five years. In a rematch of Super Bowl LIV, the Chiefs overtime defeat of the San Francisco 49ers 25–22 in Super Bowl LVIII moved the franchise to four Super Bowl titles, becoming the seventh franchise to accomplish that number. This was only the second overtime game in Super Bowl history.[184] This marked the first back-to-back Super Bowl wins since Super Bowl XXXIX, making it three Super Bowl wins in five years and cementing them as a dynasty.[185][186] The Chiefs have won four Super Bowl Championships and three AFL Championships – the latter of which were won twice as the Kansas City Chiefs and once under their original name, the Dallas Texans.[187][188] When the Texans began playing in 1960, the team's logo consisted of the state of Texas in white with a yellow star marking the location of the city of Dallas. Originally, Hunt chose Columbia blue and orange for the Texans' uniforms, but Bud Adams chose Columbia blue and scarlet for his Houston Oilers franchise.[5] Hunt reverted to red and gold for the Texans' uniforms, which even after the team relocated to Kansas City, remain as the franchise's colors to this day.[5] The state of Texas on the team's helmet was replaced by an arrowhead design originally sketched by Lamar Hunt on a napkin.[5] Hunt's inspiration for the interlocking \"KC\" design was the \"SF\" inside of an oval on the San Francisco 49ers helmets.[5] Unlike the 49ers' logo, Kansas City's overlapping initials appear inside a white arrowhead instead of an oval and are surrounded by a thin black outline.[5] From 1960 to 1973, the Chiefs had grey facemask bars on their helmets, but changed to white facemasks in 1974, making them one of the first teams (alongside the San Diego Chargers, who introduced a yellow facemask that same year) in the NFL to use a non-gray facemask.[5] The Chiefs' uniform design has essentially remained the same throughout the club's history with only four minor changes occurring.[5] It consists of a red helmet, and either red or white jerseys with the opposite color numbers and names.[5] White pants were used with both jerseys from 1960 to 1967, and 1989 to 1999.[5] Beginning in 2009, during the Pioli/Haley era, the team has alternated between white and red pants for road games during the season. Prior to September 15, 2013, the Chiefs always wore white pants with their red jerseys. The Chiefs do not have an official alternate jersey, although unofficial alternate jerseys are sold for retail. The Chiefs wore their white jerseys with white pants at home for the 2006 season opener against the Cincinnati Bengals. The logic behind the uniform selection that day was that the Bengals would have to wear their black uniform on a day when hot temperatures were forecast.[189] In 2007, the Kansas City Chiefs honored Lamar Hunt and the AFL with a special patch.[190] It features the AFL's logo from the 1960s with Hunt's \"LH\" initials inside the football.[190] In 2008, the patch became permanently affixed to the left chest of both Kansas City's home and away jerseys.[190] In select games for the 2009 season, the Chiefs, as well as the other founding teams of the American Football League, wore a \"throwback\" uniform to celebrate the AFL's 50th anniversary.[191] For the first time in team history, the Chiefs wore red jerseys with red pants, forming an all-red combo in their home opener against the Dallas Cowboys on September 15, 2013.[192] The all-red uniform is now an official uniform combination and has been used multiple times since. It is commonly used for prime-time games at home. The all-red look also served as the basis for the Chiefs' Color Rush design. Arrowhead Stadium has been the Chiefs' home field since 1972 and has a capacity of 76,416,[193] which makes it the fifth-largest stadium in the NFL. The stadium underwent a $375 million renovation, completed in mid-2010, which included new luxury boxes, wider concourses and enhanced amenities.[194][104] The stadium renovation was paid for by $250 million in taxpayer money and $125 million from the Hunt Family.[108] The stadium cost $53 million to build in 1972, and an average ticket in 2009 costs $81.[194] Aramark serves as the stadium's concession provider and T-Mobile, Anheuser-Busch and Coca-Cola are major corporate sponsors.[194] Dating back to the Chiefs' home opener in 1991 to mid-2009, the Chiefs had 155 consecutive sellout games.[194] The streak ended with the final home game of the 2009 season against the Cleveland Browns, resulting in the first local TV blackout in over 19 years.[195] Arrowhead has been called one of the world's finest stadiums[17] and has long held a reputation for being one of the toughest and loudest outdoor stadiums for opposing players to play in.[104][196][197][198] All noise is directly attributed to its fans[199] and was once measured at 116 decibels by the Acoustical Design Group of Mission, Kansas.[200] By way of comparison, take-off of aircraft may lead to a sound level of 106 decibels at the ground.[200] Sports Illustrated named Arrowhead Stadium the \"toughest place to play\" for opposing teams in 2005.[201] The tailgate party environment outside the stadium on gameday has been compared to a \"college football\" atmosphere.[202] Arrowhead Stadium features frequent fly-overs from a B-2 Spirit stealth bomber from nearby Whiteman Air Force Base. Since the 1994 NFL season, the stadium has had a natural grass playing surface.[203] From 1972 to 1993, the stadium had an artificial AstroTurf surface.[203] During the game against the Oakland Raiders on October 13, 2013, Arrowhead Stadium once again became the loudest stadium in the world when the fans set the Guinness Book of World Records record for loudest crowd in an outdoor stadium (137.5 dB), breaking the record set by the Seattle Seahawks just four weeks prior. A few weeks after, Seattle re-gained the record by reaching a noise level of 137.6 decibels.[204][205] Chiefs fans have reclaimed the record once again on September 29, 2014, on ESPN's Monday Night Football against the New England Patriots, the fans recorded a sound reading of 142.2 decibels.[206] The stadium has been officially named GEHA Field at Arrowhead Stadium (pronounced G.E.H.A.) since 2021. The stadium was renamed after GEHA signed a naming rights deal with the Chiefs.[207] When the franchise was based in Dallas, the team conducted their inaugural training camp at the New Mexico Military Institute in Roswell, New Mexico.[25] They moved camp to Southern Methodist University, owner Lamar Hunt's alma mater, for 1961 and continued to practice there until 1965.[25] From 1966 to 1971, the Chiefs practiced in Swope Park in Kansas City,[208] and from 1972 to 1991 held camp at William Jewell College in Clay County, Missouri–where Lamar Hunt had extensive business dealings including Worlds of Fun, Oceans of Fun and SubTropolis.[53] From 1992 to 2009 the Chiefs conducted summer training camp at the University of Wisconsin–River Falls in River Falls, Wisconsin.[209] The Chiefs' 2007 training camp was documented in the HBO/NFL Films documentary reality television series, Hard Knocks.[210] Following the passage of a $25 million state tax credit proposal, the Chiefs moved their training camp to Missouri Western State University in St. Joseph, Missouri, in 2010.[211] The bulk of the tax credits went for improvements to Arrowhead Stadium with $10 million applied to the move to Missouri Western.[212] A climate-controlled, 120-yard NFL regulation grass indoor field, and office space for the Chiefs was constructed at Missouri Western adjacent to the school's Spratt Stadium before the 2010 season.[213] Outside of training camp and during the regular season, the Chiefs conduct practices at their own training facility nearby Arrowhead Stadium. The facility is located near the Raytown Road entrance to the Truman Sports Complex just east of Interstate 435 and features three outdoor fields (two grass and one artificial turf) as well as an indoor facility with its own full-size field. The rivalry between the Chiefs and the Las Vegas Raiders is considered as one of the NFL's most bitter, extending back into the infancy of the AFL.[214] Most notably during the era; both the Chiefs and Raiders appeared in the first two Super Bowl games.[215][216][217] Since the AFL was established in 1960, the Chiefs and Raiders have shared the same division, first being the AFL Western Conference, and since the AFL–NFL merger, the AFC West. The Chiefs lead the regular season series 73–55–2 as of the end of the 2023 season, including a 2–1 playoff record against Las Vegas.[218] A historic divisional battle for the Chiefs; the rivalry with the Los Angeles Chargers reignited during the 2020s as matchups would feature an offensive battle between Patrick Mahomes and Chargers' pro-bowl quarterback Justin Herbert.[219] The Chiefs lead 69–58–1 as of the end of the 2023 season,[220] but the Chargers won 17–0 in the only playoff meeting between the two teams, a 1992 AFC wild card game.[221] Chiefs lead 72–56 as of the 2023 season, which included a run of 16 straight wins,[222] but the Broncos won the only playoff game between the two teams, a 1997 AFC Divisional game.[223][224] The series originated during the American Football League's inaugural season in 1960, as both the Kansas City Chiefs, then known as the Dallas Texans, and Buffalo Bills were charter teams in the league.[225] Despite being in two different divisions since their founding in 1960, the Bills and Chiefs have had many notable moments in NFL postseason history, most notably the 1966 AFL Championship Game, the 2021 AFC Divisional playoff game (known especially for the infamous '13 Seconds'), and the 2024 AFC Divisional playoff game (known as 'Wide Right II'). Since 2020, the rivalry has redeveloped as both teams consistently contended for the AFC title. A rivalry has also developed between Bills quarterback Josh Allen and Chiefs quarterback Patrick Mahomes, with many comparing it to the former rivalry between Tom Brady and Peyton Manning.[226] As of 2023, Buffalo leads the series 29–25–1, but Kansas City leads the playoff series 4–2. Of the six playoff meetings the teams have contested, three were AFL/AFC championship games.[227] A relatively new rivalry for the Chiefs has formed in the 2020s with the Cincinnati Bengals. Prior to 2021, the rivalry was nonexistent. By 2021 though, the Bengals became a rising team in the AFC with the arrival of a healthy top tier quarterback in Joe Burrow, the #1 pick in the 2020 NFL draft, who could go toe to toe with Patrick Mahomes.[228] The Bengals beat the Chiefs in the 2021 regular season in Cincinnati 34–31, and then followed that up with a victory in that year's AFC Championship Game at Arrowhead, a game in which the Cincinnati defense shut the Kansas City offense down in the second half and kicker Evan McPherson hit a game winning field goal in overtime to advance to Super Bowl LVI. In 2022, the Chiefs and Bengals again met in the regular season, with the Bengals prevailing 27–24 and sealing the game off of a rare Travis Kelce fumble. The Chiefs again met the Bengals in the AFC Championship game that season. The Chiefs won the game on a walk off field goal and advanced to Super Bowl LVII thanks to Bengals defensive end Joseph Ossai hitting Patrick Mahomes out of bounds when Mahomes was scrambling for a first down, leading to an unnecessary roughness penalty.[229] The two teams met again in 2023, but did not face Joe Burrow due to Burrow suffering a season ending wrist injury earlier in the season. To date, the Joe Burrow led Bengals are the only AFC team to have a winning record against the Chiefs since Patrick Mahomes became their starting quarterback. As of 2023, the Bengals lead the all-time series 18–16.[230] When St. Louis, Missouri had NFL teams, namely the Cardinals and later the Rams, a cross-state rivalry existed with the Chiefs; with a trophy being awarded to the winner of each game. The series was active with the Cardinals from 1960 to 1988 prior to their relocation to Arizona. The series found new life from 1995 to 2015 after the Rams played in St. Louis for a 20-year tenure. Despite this, the series ended permanently following the Rams' relocation back to Los Angeles in 2016. Though, following the Rams' return to Los Angeles; the two teams would play each other during the 2018 season in a historic matchup which set the record for the third-highest scoring game of all time,[231] hailed by many as one of the greatest games in league history.[232][233] As of the 2023 season, the Chiefs lead the all-time series 8–5.[234] The Chiefs' first mascot was Warpaint, a nickname given to several breeds of pinto horse. Warpaint served as the team's mascot from 1963 to 1988.[24][235][236] The first Warpaint (born in 1955, died in 1992) was ridden bareback by rider Bob Johnson who wore a full Native American headdress.[24][235] Warpaint circled the field at the beginning of each Chiefs home game and performed victory laps following each Chiefs touchdown.[24][235] On September 20, 2009, a new Warpaint horse was unveiled at the Chiefs' home opener.[237] Warpaint was ridden by a cheerleader in its return.[238] The Chiefs again retired Warpaint in 2021 as a part of their commitment to stop the use of Native American imagery.[239] In the mid-1980s, the Chiefs featured a short-lived unnamed \"Indian man\" mascot which was later scrapped in 1988.[235] Since 1989 the cartoon-like K. C. Wolf, portrayed by Dan Meers in a wolf costume, has served as the team's mascot.[24][240] The mascot was named after the Chiefs' \"Wolfpack\", a group of rabid fans from the team's days at Municipal Stadium.[235] K. C. Wolf is one of the most popular NFL mascots and was the league's first mascot inducted into the Mascot Hall of Fame in 2006.[241] The Chiefs have employed a cheerleading squad since the team's inception in 1960.[242] In the team's early days, the all-female squad was referred to as the Chiefettes.[243] In addition to the Cheerleaders, in the early 1970s, there was also a dance/drill team that performed for pre-game and halftime. From 1986 to 1992, the cheerleader squad featured a mix of men and women.[242] From 1993 to 2019, the all-female squad has been known as the Chiefs Cheerleaders, and in 2020, one male joined the team.[235][242][243] Running backs (RB) Wide receivers (WR) Tight ends (TE) Defensive linemen (DL) Defensive backs (DB) Special teams Reserve 53 active, 12 reserve, 14 practice squad (+1 exempt) Twenty-five members of the Pro Football Hall of Fame spent at least some portion of their career with the Chiefs. Thirteen spent the majority of the career with the Chiefs. Ten of the Chiefs in the Hall of Fame were involved with the Chiefs during their Super Bowl Championship season of 1969. The Chiefs have 3 contributors, 3 coaches, and 18 players in the Hall of Fame. Derrick Thomas is the only Chief in the Hall of Fame that was inducted posthumously. Listed below are only people whose tenure with the Chiefs is their reason for induction, not former Chiefs coaches inducted as a player, the only exception being Emmitt Thomas who was inducted as a player for the Chiefs and later become an assistant coach for the team. Established in 1970, the Chiefs Hall of Fame has inducted a new member, with the exception of the 1983 and 2020 seasons, every year to honor their players, coaches, and contributors in an annual ceremony.[244][245] The requirements for induction are that a player, coach, or contributor must have been with the Chiefs for four seasons and been out of the NFL for four seasons at the time of induction.[244] There are some exceptions, such as Joe Delaney and Derrick Thomas, Delaney was with the team for only two seasons before his death, Thomas was inducted 1 year after his death in January 2000 (2 years after his final season). The Chiefs have the second-most enshrinees of any NFL team in their team Hall of Fame behind the Green Bay Packers, who have enshrined over 100 players and team contributors over the years in the Green Bay Packers Hall of Fame.[244] Nineteen players and the coach of the Super Bowl IV championship team have been inducted into the ring of honor. Three players were posthumously inducted, Derrick Thomas, Joe Delaney, and Mack Lee Hill. *Posthumous induction†Hall's primary position was wide receiver and is listed in the Chiefs Hall of Honor as a receiver. However, he was inducted because of his accomplishments as a return specialist. Three Chiefs players own major NFL records. Patrick Mahomes owns the record for career quarterback rating with a minimum of 1,500 attempts with 103.9,[246] Derrick Thomas owns the record for sacks in a single game with 7 which he accomplished in 1990,[247] and Travis Kelce owns the record for career receptions in the playoffs.[248] Additionally, Tony Gonzalez, who spent the majority his career with the Chiefs, is the career receiving yards and receptions leader among tight ends. Chiefs players own several less notable records, for example, Mahomes owns the record for fastest quarterback to 100 career passing touchdowns. For a list of franchise records, see List of Kansas City Chiefs records Thirteen head coaches have served the Texans/Chiefs franchise since their first season in 1960.[249] Hank Stram, the team's first head coach, led the Chiefs to three AFL championship victories and two appearances in the Super Bowl.[250] Stram was the team's longest-tenured head coach, holding the position from 1960 to 1974.[41] Marty Schottenheimer was hired in 1989 and led Kansas City to seven playoff appearances in his ten seasons as head coach.[45][53] Schottenheimer had the best winning percentage (.634) of all Chiefs coaches.[55] Gunther Cunningham was on the Chiefs' coaching staff in various positions from 1995 to 2008, serving as the team's head coach in between stints as the team's defensive coordinator.[58][59] Dick Vermeil coached the team to a franchise-best 9–0 start in the 2003 season.[251] Of the ten Chiefs coaches, Hank Stram, Marv Levy, and Dick Vermeil have been elected into the Pro Football Hall of Fame, Levy is more well known for his time with the Buffalo Bills.[252] Herm Edwards served as the team's head coach from 2006 to 2008, compiling a 15–33 record and a franchise worst 6–26 record over a two-year span.[105][106][253][254] Todd Haley compiled a 19–26 record with the team from 2009 to 2011, including an AFC West division title in 2010.[107] Haley was fired with three games left in the 2011 season. Romeo Crennel was named interim coach, and was promoted to full-time coach in January 2012. Crennel was fired on Monday, December 31, 2012, after finishing the 2012 season with a 2–14 record. On January 5, 2013, the Chiefs hired Andy Reid to be their next head coach. In Reid's tenure, the Chiefs have never had a sub-.500 season, making the playoffs in 10 of his 11 seasons as head coach, winning the division six times, and twice having two consecutive Super Bowl appearances, and three wins. With a 21–14 victory over the Miami Dolphins, on November 5, 2023, in Frankfurt Germany, Andy Reid tied former Chiefs head coach Hank Stram on the franchise's all-time regular season wins list with 124 victories.[255][256] The franchise was founded in 1959 by Lamar Hunt after a failed attempt by Hunt to purchase an NFL franchise and relocate them to Texas.[257] Hunt remained the team's owner until his death in 2006.[257] The Hunt family kept ownership of the team following Lamar's death and Clark Hunt, Lamar's son, represents the family's interests.[194] While Hunt's official title is CEO and Chairman of the Board, he represents the team at all owner meetings.[258][259] In 2010, Hunt assumed role as CEO alongside his role as chairman of the board.[260] According to Forbes, the team began the 2024 season valued at $4.85 billion USD, ranking them 24th among the 32 NFL teams.[261] Owner Lamar Hunt served as the team's president from 1960 to 1976. Because of Lamar Hunt's contributions to the NFL, the AFC Championship trophy is named after him.[262] He promoted general manager Jack Steadman to become the team's president in 1977.[262] Steadman held the job until Carl Peterson was hired by Hunt in 1988 to replace him.[262] Peterson resigned the title as team president in 2008.[263] Denny Thum became the team's interim president following Peterson's departure and was officially given the full position in May 2009.[263][264] Thum resigned from his position on September 14, 2010.[260] Don Rossi served as the team's general manager for half of the 1960 season, resigning in November 1960.[25] Jack Steadman assumed duties from Rossi and served in the position until 1976.[25][41][262] Steadman was promoted to team president in 1976 and despite being relieved of those duties in 1988,[262] he remained with the franchise until 2006 in various positions.[41][45] Jim Schaaf took over for Steadman as general manager until being fired in December 1988.[45] Carl Peterson was hired in 1988 to serve as the team's general manager, chief executive officer and team president.[45][262] Peterson remained in the position for nineteen years until he announced his resignation from the team in 2008.[263][265] Denny Thum served as interim general manager[263] until January 13, 2009, when the Chiefs named New England Patriots executive Scott Pioli the team's new general manager.[104][266] Pioli was released in early January after the hiring of Andy Reid, and was replaced by John Dorsey. Pioli's record as the Chief's general manager was 23–41. On June 22, 2017, the Chiefs fired Dorsey.[267] They hired Brett Veach as the new general manager on July 10, 2017.[268] → Coaching staff → Front office → More NFL staffs Kansas City radio station WDAF-FM (106.5) is the flagship station for The Chiefs Football Radio Network. The network has affiliates across Missouri, Kansas, Iowa, Nebraska, and Texas, and national reach through desktop and mobile devices. AFC Championship and Super Bowl broadcasts are exclusive to KCSP and WDAF-FM due to NFL rules surrounding the exclusivity of Westwood One's coverage outside of the immediate Kansas City area. As part of the newest television contracts, non-primetime games are broadcast on CBS or Fox with the biggest markets being the metropolitan areas of Kansas City, Wichita, and Omaha. The Chiefs' owned production company is named 65 Toss Power Trap Productions, after a play from the Chiefs Super Bowl IV victory which led to a five-yard touchdown run by Mike Garrett.[269] The Chiefs boast one of the most loyal fan bases in the NFL.[195][270] Kansas City is the sixth-smallest media market with an NFL team, but they have had the second-highest attendance average over the last decade.[199] Studies by Bizjournals in 2006 gave the Chiefs high marks for consistently drawing capacity crowds in both good seasons and bad.[271] The Chiefs averaged 77,300 fans per game from 1996 to 2006, second in the NFL behind the Washington Redskins.[271] The franchise has an official fan club called Chiefs Kingdom which gives members opportunities to ticket priority benefits and VIP treatment.[272][273] At the end of \"The Star-Spangled Banner\" before home games, many Chiefs fans intentionally yell out \"CHIEFS!\" rather than singing \"brave\" as the final word.[274] This can also occasionally be heard in road games[275] and even at sporting events for the nearby University of Kansas.[276] In 1996, general manager Carl Peterson said \"We all look forward, not only at Arrowhead, but on the road, too, to when we get to that stanza of the National Anthem... Our players love it.\"[274] After the September 11, 2001 attacks, Chiefs fans refrained from doing so in honor of those who lost their lives in the tragedy and continued to do so for the remainder of the 2001 season.[277] At the Chiefs' September 23, 2001, home game against the New York Giants, fans gave the opposing Giants a standing ovation.[198] In the past, fans would chant while pointing in the direction of the visiting team, \"We're gonna beat the hell outta you...you...you, you, you, you!\" over the song \"Rock and Roll Part 2\".[278] The chant starts after the third \"hey!\" in the song.[278] The original version of the song by Gary Glitter was previously used until the NFL banned his music from its facilities in 2006 following the British rocker's conviction on sexual abuse charges in Vietnam.[278] A cover version of the song played by Tube Tops 2000[278] was used from 2006 until the 2015 season.[279] The practice was later completely discontinued prior to the 2015 season after Glitter was arrested again.[280] The team would eventually adopt Beastie Boys' \"(You Gotta) Fight for Your Right (To Party!)\" after Travis Kelce shouted the main chorus while celebrating victories in the AFC Championship Game and Super Bowl.[281] Notable fans include Brad Pitt, Paul Rudd, Jason Sudeikis, Henry Cavill, David Koechner, Rob Riggle, Taylor Swift, Heidi Gardner, John Amos, Melissa Etheridge, and Eric Stonestreet.[282] Arrowhead Stadium is also recognized by Guinness World Records as having the loudest outdoor stadium in the world. This was achieved on September 29, 2014, in a Monday Night Football game against the New England Patriots when the crowd achieved a roar of 142.2 decibels[283] which is comparable to standing 100 feet (30 m) from a jet engine, which even with short term exposure, can cause permanent damage.[284] The NFL introduced the league's international home marketing area program in 2021,[285] which sees teams secure international marketing rights in countries beyond the United States. The Chiefs were designated as a home team to Germany alongside the Carolina Panthers, New England Patriots, and Tampa Bay Buccaneers. In 2023 the NFL also granted the Chiefs permission to expand its marketing and fan outreach to Austria and Switzerland.[286] The Chiefs hosted a game in Germany during their 2023 season against the Miami Dolphins.[287][288] The Chiefs have played international regular season games against Detroit in 2015 in London, and against the LA Chargers in 2019 in Mexico City. The team participated in preseason exhibition games dubbed the American Bowl in Berlin (1990), Tokyo (1994 and 1998), and Monterrey, Mexico (1996).[287] The Chiefs' fan base has expanded across the world like many other NFL teams. A Twitter account is dedicated to Chiefs fans in the UK and has been recognized by the Kansas City Chiefs and is their official UK fan page. They have many dedicated fans writing articles and interviewing players of the team such as Tamba Hali.[289] From various periods between 1963 and the 2008 season, trumpeter Tony DiPardo and The T.D. Pack Band played live music at every Chiefs home game.[290][291] The band was known as The Zing Band when the team was located at Municipal Stadium. DiPardo was honored by head coach Hank Stram in 1969 with a Super Bowl ring for the team's victory in Super Bowl IV.[290] When his health was declining, DiPardo took a leave of absence from the band from 1983 to 1988.[291] DiPardo's daughter took over as bandleader in 1989, by which time DiPardo returned to the band by popular demand.[291][292] For the 2009 season, due to renovations at Arrowhead Stadium, the band did not return to perform at the stadium. DiPardo died on January 27, 2011, at age 98. He had been hospitalized since December 2010 after suffering a brain aneurysm.[293] For various reasons, the team has faced charges of racism and anti-Indigenous cultural appropriation and misuse of names, symbols, and practices.[294][295] The name comes from the nickname of former Kansas City mayor Harold Roe Bartle, who nicknamed himself \"Chief\" as part of creating the Tribe of Mic-O-Say, a group affiliated with the Boy Scouts of America.[296] Over the life of the franchise the following have also been displayed: an arrowhead logo, fans' \"tomahawk chop\" gestures during games, a horse named Warpaint, the use of a large drum, and the wearing of face paint, headdresses, and other Native American symbols.[297][298] Chiefs fans also carry on a tradition that began at Florida State University in the mid-1980s by using the Seminole WarChant as a rallying cry during key moments in their football games.[299][300] Prior to each home game, a former Chiefs player[301] or a famous Chiefs fan (such as NASCAR driver Clint Bowyer[302] or rapper Tech N9ne[303]), called the honorary drum leader, bangs on a drum with a large drum stick to start the Tomahawk chop. The Chiefs' and their fans' use of Native American imagery and stereotypes has been the source of controversy, as some decry usage of symbols like the \"war drum,\" songs and spectacles like the \"Tomahawk Chop,\" and stereotypical dress of fans in faux war paint and headdresses. In 2016, Native American groups asked the Kansas City Chiefs to stop doing the tomahawk chop.[304] In the same year a similar request was made of Exeter Chiefs.[305] The editorial board of the Kansas City Star newspaper called for the cessation of the \"Tomahawk Chop\" in late 2019, noting opposition from Native Americans and Tribes, and stating that the practice stereotypes and dehumanizes Native Americans.[306] The National Congress of American Indians and the Kansas City Indian Center have called for the mascot to be retired.[307] The Chiefs have escaped the more intense criticism of other teams, such as the Washington Redskins and Cleveland Indians who changed their names beginning with their 2022 seasons, for using Native American names and logos. Attention increased in 2020 in advance of their appearance in Super Bowl LIV.[308] While there have been efforts to address other issues, such as fans wearing warpaint and headdresses, the tomahawk chop and the accompanying chant is defended, including by some local Native Americans. In a national survey, half of Native Americans said the \"tomahawk chop\" bothered or offended them, rising to 65% among those more engaged in Native traditions.[309]",

He quickly joined the Nationals’ Dominican Academy and immediately began to immerse himself in English by using the Rosetta Stone language-learning software lessons. Soto initially practiced English for one hour a day, five days a week. After the Dominican Academy, Soto joined the Nationals’ Class A affiliate, the Hagerstown Suns. He met Suns catcher Tres Barrera, who was born in Texas to Mexican parents. Soto told Barrera that he only wanted the two of them to converse in English. Barrera told the Washington Post that he remembered how Soto would go to a McDonald’s near the Hagerstown ballpark every day to practice his English by ordering from the menu. When Soto was called up to the Nationals, he told manager Dave Martinez, “No Spanish, only English.” Soto himself also recalled the role that his mother played in his English lessons. “I remember her telling me that if I wanted to be a star, I had to know the language in the country I wanted to play in,” he reflected. “She was right.

                "title": "Juan Soto: Nationals outfielder, mastering English in addition to MLB",
                "content": "WASHINGTON — Juan Soto figures he was probably 12 years old when he returned home one day, after completing three levels of English courses, and told his mom he was done. He didn't want to learn the new language anymore. He didn't need to learn it anymore. \"She tells me if I want to be a baseball player, I have to learn,\" Soto recalled. \"I said, ‘No, I just have to play baseball.'\" But as Soto kept just playing baseball, his perspective changed. The Washington Nationals signed him to a contract in 2015 and gave him a $1.5-million signing bonus. They shipped the then-16-year-old Dominican outfielder to their academy in Boca Chica, a complex about an hour east of his hometown of Santo Domingo and a few miles from the beach. He started to think of English not as a chore, but as another skill to be mastered on his way to the big leagues. \"If you want to be a superstar,\" Soto told USA TODAY Sports, \"you’ve got to be ready in every spot.\" All things Nationals: Latest Washington Nationals news, schedule, roster, stats, injury updates and more. Soto, now 20, has emerged as one of baseball's bright young stars over the past year – and one of the main reasons the Nationals felt comfortable letting Bryce Harper walk in free agency. But beyond his patience at the plate and ability to crush fastballs, he has most impressed teammates and staff with the dedication he's put into English – not just learning the language, but perfecting it. \"He was first to graduate at the (Dominican) academy, speaking English,\" Nationals manager Dave Martinez told USA TODAY Sports. \"He’s very adamant about fitting in and being a part of this culture, as well as back at home.\" According to statistics provided by MLB, more than 25 percent of players on Opening Day rosters this season hailed from Spanish-speaking countries, including more than 100 players from the Dominican Republic alone. Some players prefer to stick to their native tongues. Others work to pick up conversational English, to better communicate with their teammates and fans. Few pick it up as quickly as Soto has. \"It’s tough, definitely. It’s really tough,\" said Venezuelan-born pitcher Anibal Sanchez, who explained that he spoke zero English when he first joined the Boston Red Sox organization in 2001. \"When I came to the U.S., as soon as I got out of the plane, they asked me where I was from. And the answer was my name. The guy started laughing at me, but it is what it is at that point.\" Sanchez said he's taken online classes with a private teacher even in recent years to improve his English. For Soto, the process really started when he signed with the team less than four years ago – though he admits he did have a slight head start, thanks to his mom. When he arrived in Boca Chica, the staff gave Soto a log-in for Rosetta Stone and required him, like other prospects at the academy, to study English for at least one hour a day, five days per week. Soto met that daily requirement – and then some. \"Everybody goes to sleep and all this stuff, and I stayed awake and said ‘oh, let’s do some English,'\" Soto said. \"I started working. I (did) like two hours, one (more) hour every day. That’s why I finished really fast.\" The following year, when Soto graduated to the Gulf Coast League – the lowest rung of the minors – he used it as an opportunity to pick up more real-world experience. He spoke with his American teammates often, and found a safe learning space at a nearby McDonald's, where employees didn't judge him for saying the incorrect word or phrase. Soto became so articulate so quickly that by the time the Nationals called him up last spring, at 19, he was already able to conduct interviews in English. \"I didn’t even know we’ve got to talk with the media every day. So I was like… Wow,\" Soto said with a smile. \"I was a little nervous, but every word I said, I was like ‘Oh, I can do it in English.’ So I started doing it in English since the first day.\" Octavio Martinez, the Nationals' translator, flanked Soto during interviews with reporters when he was called up. And he's still on hand now, in case Soto misses a word or doesn't understand a question. But Martinez said he's rarely needed. \"I’m definitely very impressed – the fact that at such a young age, he’s able to comprehend it so well,\" Martinez said. \"I think the biggest thing is just his confidence, which shows on the field. He’s so confident. It’s the same thing with him talking to the media – he’s confident in what he’s going to say.\" Now, even two months into his second big-league season, Soto is the fourth-youngest player in the majors. He finished second in National League Rookie of the Year voting last season and has already racked up six home runs and 22 RBI this year, despite spending the past eight days on the injured list with back spasms. (He is eligible to return Saturday.) Soto said he's still working on his English every day, mostly by talking with teammates. The language has become important to him on the field, and even more so beyond it. He wants to be able to communicate with reporters in interviews, but also feel comfortable interacting with fans who might approach him at a restaurant and ask for an autograph. \"You’ve got to be comfortable to talk with them, and they’ve got to be comfortable with you talking, to ask everything they want,\" Soto explained. \"That’s why (stars) are stars. They’re good in every spot.\" Contact Tom Schad at tschad@usatoday.com or on Twitter @Tom_Schad.",

                "title": "Jay-Z - Wikipedia",
                "content": "Shawn Corey Carter (born December 4, 1969), known professionally as Jay-Z,[a] is an American rapper, businessman, and record executive.[8][9][10] Rooted in East Coast hip hop, he was named the greatest rapper of all time by Billboard and Vibe in 2023, and topped Forbes list of \"The 50 Top Rappers Of All Time\" in 2024.[11][12] Known for his complex lyrical ability—which often uses double entendres and word play—and braggadocio, his music is built upon a rags to riches narrative. He served as president and chief executive officer of Def Jam Recordings from 2004 to 2007, and founded the entertainment company Roc Nation the following year.[13] A protégé of fellow New York City-based rapper Jaz-O, Jay-Z began his musical career in the late 1980s; he co-founded the record label Roc-A-Fella Records in 1994 to release his first two studio albums Reasonable Doubt (1996) and In My Lifetime, Vol. 1 (1997), both of which were met with critical acclaim. Each of his eleven subsequent albums, including The Blueprint (2001), The Black Album (2003), American Gangster (2007), and 4:44 (2017), debuted atop the Billboard 200; Jay-Z holds the record for the most number-one albums (14) of any solo artist on the chart.[14][15][16] He has also released the collaborative albums The Best of Both Worlds (2002) and Unfinished Business (2004) with singer R. Kelly,[17] Collision Course (2004) with Linkin Park, Watch the Throne (2011) with Kanye West, and Everything Is Love (2018) with his wife Beyoncé.[18] He peaked the Billboard Hot 100 on four occasions: once as a lead artist with his 2009 single \"Empire State of Mind\" (featuring Alicia Keys), and thrice with his guest performances on the singles \"Heartbreaker\" by Mariah Carey, \"Crazy in Love\" by Beyoncé, and \"Umbrella\" by Rihanna.[19] Through his business ventures, Jay-Z became the first hip-hop billionaire in 2019.[20][21] In 1999, he co-founded the clothing retailer Rocawear[22] and later founded the 40/40 Club, a luxury bar chain, in 2003. As both grew into multi-million-dollar businesses, he launched Roc Nation, a multi-disciplinary entertainment agency in 2008. In 2015, he acquired the technology company Aspiro and led the expansion of Tidal, the company's media streaming service.[23][24][25] As of 2024, he is the wealthiest musical artist in the world with a net worth of US$2.5 billion.[26] One of the world's best-selling music artists with 140 million records sold, Jay-Z has won 24 Grammy Awards, the tenth-most of all time and most awarded for any hip hop artist jointly with Kanye West.[27] He has been awarded the NAACP's President's Award, a Primetime Emmy Award, a Sports Emmy Award, and been nominated for a Tony Award. Ranked by Billboard and Rolling Stone as one of the 100 greatest artists of all time,[28][29] Jay-Z was the first rapper to be inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame[30] and the first solo living rapper inducted in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. Time named him one of the 100 most influential people in the world in 2013.[8] Shawn Corey Carter was born on December 4, 1969, in Brooklyn, New York City.[31] He was raised in Marcy Houses, a public housing project in Brooklyn's Bedford–Stuyvesant neighborhood.[32] His father, Adnis Reeves,[33] abandoned the family when Jay-Z was 11 years old, and Jay-Z and his three older siblings were raised by his mother, Gloria Carter. Reeves later met and reconciled with Jay-Z prior to his death in 2003. Jay-Z claims in his lyrics to \"You Must Love Me\", the closing track on his 1997 album In My Lifetime, Vol. 1, that in 1982, at age 12, he shot his older brother Eric in the shoulder for stealing his jewelry.[34][35] He attended Eli Whitney High School and George Westinghouse Career and Technical Education High School, both in Brooklyn, and then Trenton Central High School in Trenton, New Jersey. He did not graduate, dropping out during his sophomore year at Trenton Central High School.[36] According to his interviews and lyrics, he sold crack cocaine[35] and was shot at three times during this period.[34] His former friend was sentenced to prison for possessing drugs and weapons.[37][38] Known as \"Jazzy\" around the neighborhood, he later adopted the stage name \"Jay-Z\" in homage to his mentor Jaz-O.[32][39] Jay-Z can be briefly heard on several of Jaz-O's early recordings in the late 1980s and early 1990s, including \"H. P. Gets Busy\", \"The Originators\" and \"Hawaiian Sophie\".[40][41] Jay-Z became embroiled in several battles with rapper LL Cool J in the early 1990s.[42] He first became known to a wide audience on the posse cut \"Show and Prove\" on the 1994 Big Daddy Kane album Daddy's Home. Jay-Z has been referred to as Big Daddy Kane's hype man during this period,[43] although Kane explains that he did not fill the traditional hype man role, and was instead basically making cameo appearances on stage. \"When I would leave the stage to go change outfits, I would bring out Jay-Z and Positive K and let them freestyle until I came back to the stage.\"[44][45] According to his second verse on \"99 Problems\", released in 2003, Jay-Z was allegedly stopped by an NYPD detective in 1994 while en route to I-95, possibly for a search of drugs in his car. Detection dogs were called, but another police car had passed; Jay-Z was let go soon after.[46] Jay-Z appeared on a popular song by Big L, \"Da Graveyard\", and on Mic Geronimo's \"Time to Build\", which also featured early appearances by his former Murder Inc. colleagues Ja Rule and DMX in 1995. His first official rap single was \"In My Lifetime\", which was released with an accompanying music video in 1995. An unreleased music video was also produced for the B-side \"I Can't Get with That.\"[47] With no major label to give him a record deal, Jay-Z sold burned CDs out of his car,[34] and with Damon \"Dame\" Dash and Kareem \"Biggs\" Burke, created Roc-A-Fella Records as an independent label in 1995. After striking a distribution deal with Priority, Jay-Z released his 1996 debut album Reasonable Doubt with beats from acclaimed producers such as DJ Premier and Super DJ Clark Kent and an appearance by The Notorious B.I.G. The album reached number 23 on the Billboard 200, and was generally favored by critics.[32] This album would later be included in Rolling Stone's 500 Greatest Albums of All Time as No. 248 and eventually reach platinum status.[48] After reaching a new label distribution deal with Def Jam in 1997, Jay-Z released his follow-up In My Lifetime, Vol. 1. Featuring production by Sean \"Puff Daddy\" Combs, DJ Premier, and Ski, it earned platinum status in the United States.[48] In 1998, Jay-Z released Vol. 2... Hard Knock Life which spawned the biggest hit of his career at the time, \"Hard Knock Life (Ghetto Anthem)\". He relied more on flow and wordplay, and he continued with his penchant for mining beats from the popular producers of the day such as Swizz Beatz, an upstart in-house producer for Ruff Ryders, and Timbaland.[49] Other producers included DJ Premier, Erick Sermon, The 45 King, and Kid Capri. Charting hits from this album included \"Can I Get A...\", featuring Ja Rule and Amil, and \"Nigga What, Nigga Who\", featuring Amil and Jaz-O. Vol. 2 would eventually become Jay-Z's most commercially successful album; it was certified 5× Platinum in the United States and has to date sold over five million copies.[48] The album went on to win a Grammy Award, although Jay-Z boycotted the ceremony protesting DMX's failure to garner a Grammy nomination and the academy's decision to not broadcast urban music categories.[50] In 1999, Jay-Z collaborated with Mariah Carey on \"Heartbreaker\", a song from her seventh album, Rainbow. The song became Jay-Z's first chart-topper in the U.S., spending two weeks atop the Billboard Hot 100.[51] In that same year, Jay-Z released Vol. 3... Life and Times of S. Carter. The album proved successful and sold over 3 million copies.[48] Vol. 3's most successful single was \"Big Pimpin\", featuring UGK. In 2000, Jay-Z released The Dynasty: Roc La Familia, which was originally intended to become a compilation album for Roc-A-Fella artists but Def Jam turned into a Jay-Z album.[52] The album helped to introduce newcomer producers The Neptunes, Just Blaze, Kanye West, and Bink, which have all gone on to achieve notable success. This is also the first album where Jay-Z utilizes a more soulful sound than his previous albums. The Dynasty sold over two million units in the U.S. alone.[48] In 2001, Jay-Z spoke out against Prodigy after he took an issue with a Jay-Z line from \"Money, Cash, Hoes\" that he felt alluded disparagingly to Mobb Deep and Prodigy's dispute with Tupac Shakur, Snoop Dogg, and Death Row Records. He later performed the song \"Takeover\", at Summer Jam 2001, which initially attacked Prodigy and revealed photos of Prodigy dressed like Michael Jackson.[53] A line at the end of \"Takeover\" referred to Nas, who criticized him on \"We Will Survive\".[54] Nas responded with a diss of his own, and Jay-Z straightaway added a verse to \"Takeover\" which dissed Nas and would start a feud between the two rappers. The feud had ended by 2005; Jay-Z stated that record producer Mark Pitts had helped them settle their differences.[55] On September 11, 2001, Jay-Z released his sixth studio album, The Blueprint, which received a five-mic review from hip-hop magazine The Source. Written in just two days,[56] the album sold more than 427,000 copies, debuted at number one on the Billboard 200[57] and reached double platinum certification by the Recording Industry Association of America.[48] Eminem guest performed and produced its song, \"Renegade\". Four tracks were produced by Kanye West. The Blueprint includes the songs \"Izzo (H.O.V.A.)\", \"Girls, Girls, Girls\", \"Jigga That Nigga\", and \"Song Cry\". As of February 2012[update], the album had sold 2.7 million copies worldwide.[58] In 2019, The Blueprint was selected by the Library of Congress for preservation in the National Recording Registry for being \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\".[59] In October 2001, Jay-Z pleaded guilty to aggravated assault for stabbing record producer Lance Rivera at the Kit Kat Klub in New York City in 1999.[60] Despite Jay-Z's sentence of three years probation for the crime, Rivera later recanted the allegations in 2023.[61][62] Jay-Z then collaborated with Chicago singer R. Kelly to release collaborative studio album, The Best of Both Worlds in March 2002. In November of that year, Jay-Z released his seventh studio album The Blueprint2: The Gift & The Curse—a double album. The album debuted on the Billboard 200 at number one, selling over 3 million units solely in the U.S.[48] and surpassing The Blueprint.[63] It yielded a single-disc re-issue, The Blueprint 2.1, which retained half of the songs from the original. Its original release spawned two hit singles, \"Excuse Me Miss\" and \"'03 Bonnie & Clyde\", which features Jay-Z's then-girlfriend, Beyoncé, and contained the track \"A Dream\", featuring Faith Evans and the late Notorious B.I.G.; the re-issue spawned the single \"La-La-La\", which was a sequel to \"Excuse Me Miss\" and failed to match its commercial success. After visiting the south of France,[64] Jay-Z announced work on his eighth studio album, The Black Album at the opening of the 40/40 Club.[65] He worked with several producers including Just Blaze, The Neptunes, Kanye West, Timbaland, Eminem, DJ Quik, 9th Wonder, The Buchanans, and Rick Rubin. Notable songs on the album included \"What More Can I Say\", \"Dirt off Your Shoulder\", \"Change Clothes\", and \"99 Problems\". The Black Album has sold over 3 million copies in the U.S.[48] On November 25, 2003, Jay-Z held a concert—billed as a \"retirement party\" at Madison Square Garden in New York City, which was later the focus of his 2004 documentary, Fade to Black. All proceeds went to charity. Other performers included collaborators the Roots (in the form of his backing band), Missy Elliott, Memphis Bleek, Beanie Siegel, Freeway, Mary J. Blige, Beyoncé, Twista, Ghostface Killah, Foxy Brown, Pharrell Williams and R. Kelly, with appearances by Voletta Wallace and Afeni Shakur, the mothers of the Notorious B.I.G. and Tupac Shakur, respectively.[66] While Jay-Z had attested to a retirement from making new studio albums, various side projects and appearances soon followed. Included in these were a greatest hits record, as well as the release and tour of Unfinished Business, the second collaborative album between Jay-Z and R. Kelly. In 2004, Jay-Z collaborated with rock group Linkin Park, in which they released their collaborative remix EP Collision Course, which featured mashups of both artists' songs, as well as a concert DVD. The album's only single, \"Numb/Encore\", went on to win a Grammy Award for Best Rap/Sung Collaboration, and was performed with Linkin Park live at the Grammys, with a special appearance by Paul McCartney, who added verses from the song \"Yesterday\". The EP sold over 1 million copies in the U.S.[48] Jay-Z was the executive producer of The Rising Tied, the debut album of Fort Minor, the hip hop side project of Linkin Park rapper Mike Shinoda. Jay-Z also planned to retire in 2004.[67] Later in 2004, Jay-Z was named president of Def Jam Records, which led to Jay-Z, Dash and Biggs selling their remaining interests in Roc-A-Fella Records and Jay-Z taking control of both of the companies.[68] Reportedly this major industry move was prompted by disagreements between Jay-Z and Dash as to what direction Roc-A-Fella could undertake.[69] On October 27, 2005, Jay-Z headlined New York's Power 105.1 annual concert, Powerhouse. The concert was entitled the \"I Declare War\" concert leading to intense speculation in the weeks preceding the event on whom exactly Jay-Z would declare war. As he had previously \"declared war\" on other artists taking lyrical shots at him at other events, many believed that the Powerhouse show would represent an all-out assault by Jay-Z upon his rivals.[70] The theme of the concert was Jay-Z's position as president and CEO of Def Jam, complete with an on-stage mock-up of the Oval Office. Many artists made appearances such as the old roster of Roc-A-Fella records artists, as well as Ne-Yo, Teairra Marí, T.I., Young Jeezy, Akon, Kanye West, Paul Wall, The LOX, and Diddy.[71] At the conclusion of the concert, Jay-Z put many arguments to rest to the surprise of hip hop fans. The most significant development in this show was closure to the infamous hip hop rivalry between Jay-Z and Nas. The two former rivals shook hands and shared the stage together to perform Jay-Z's \"Dead Presidents\" blended with Nas's song \"The World is Yours\".[72] Jay-Z returned with his comeback album on November 21, 2006, titled Kingdom Come.[73] Jay-Z's comeback single, \"Show Me What You Got\", was leaked on the Internet in early October 2006, scheduled to be released later on that month, received heavy air-play after its leak, causing the FBI to step in and investigate.[74] Jay-Z worked with video director Hype Williams, and the single's video was directed by F. Gary Gray. The album features production from Just Blaze, Pharrell, Kanye West, Dr. Dre and Coldplay's Chris Martin (single entitled \"Beach Chair\").[75][76] The first week saw 680,000 sales of the CD, enough to be his \"biggest sales week ever\" as Billboard reported.[77] This album has sold 2 million copies in the U.S.[48] Jay-Z released his tenth album entitled American Gangster on November 6, 2007. After viewing the Ridley Scott film of the same name, Jay-Z was heavily inspired to create a new \"concept\" album that depicts his experiences as a street-hustler.[78] The album is not the film's official soundtrack, although it was distributed by Def Jam.[79] Jay-Z's American Gangster depicts his life in correlation to the movie American Gangster. At the start of the album's first single, \"Blue Magic\", Jay-Z offers a dealer's manifesto while making references to political figures of the late 1980s with the lyric: \"Blame Reagan for making me to into a monster, blame Oliver North and Iran-Contra, I ran contraband that they sponsored, before this rhymin' stuff we was in concert.\"[80] Also notable about the \"Blue Magic\" music video was Jay-Z flashing €500 notes; Harvard Business School professor Rawi Abdelal called this a \"turning point in American pop culture's response to globalization.\" The album has sold 1 million copies in the U.S.[48] On January 1, 2008, Jay-Z resigned as president of Def Jam.[81] In winter 2008, it was announced that Jay-Z would become the first major hip hop artist to headline Britain's Glastonbury Festival.[82][83] Tickets sold out quickly. Former headliner Noel Gallagher of Oasis condemned the festival organizers for choosing Jay-Z to headline a traditionally guitar-driven festival. \"I'm sorry, but Jay-Z?\" Gallagher asked, swearing. \"No chance. Glastonbury has a tradition of, kind of, guitar music, do you know what I mean? And even when they throw the odd curve balls in on a Sunday night—you go, 'Kylie Minogue? I don't know about that', do you know what I mean?—but I'm not having hip hop at Glastonbury, no way, no, no. It's wrong.\"[84] As controversy mounted, Jay-Z replied, \"We don't play guitars, Noel, but hip hop has put in its work like any other form of music. This headline show is just a natural progression. Rap music is still evolving. We have to respect each other's genre of music and move forward.\"[85] Jay-Z opened his Glastonbury set with a tongue-in-cheek cover of Oasis's iconic song \"Wonderwall\",[86] and went on to deliver a performance heralded as a successful response to pre-festival criticism.[87] He also headlined many other summer festivals in 2008, including Roskilde Festival in Denmark,[88] Hove Festival in Norway[89] and O2 Wireless Festival in London.[90] During Kanye West's concert of August 6, 2008, at Madison Square Garden, Jay-Z came out to perform a new song and he and West proclaimed that it was to be on The Blueprint 3.[91] On May 21, 2009, Jay-Z announced he would be parting ways with Def Jam, and had struck a multi-million-dollar deal to sign with Live Nation, with whom he would start his Roc Nation imprint which would serve as a record label, talent/management agency, and music publishing company[92] and also partnered with production team Stargate to start a record label called StarRoc.[93][94] Jay-Z's 11th studio album The Blueprint 3 was originally to be released on September 11, 2009,[95] but was instead released in North America on September 8, 2009, due to increasing anticipation.[96] Its international release followed on September 14.[97] It is his 11th album to reach No. 1 on the Billboard 200[98] and has surpassed Elvis Presley's previous record, making him the current solo-artist record holder.[99] On October 9, 2009, Jay-Z kicked off his tour for The Blueprint 3, during which he supported his new album in North America. In a Shave Magazine review of his performance at Rexall Place in Edmonton, Jake Tomlinson expressed that \"It was the type of smooth performance you would expect from the hip-hop superstar.\" The review gave this performance 4 stars. His North American tour continued until November 22, 2009.[100] At his concert on November 8, 2009, at UCLA's Pauley Pavilion, Rihanna joined him on stage and performed \"Hard\" for the first time, then performed \"Run This Town\" with Jay-Z.[101] Among his success, Jay-Z has ventured into producing Broadway shows. Along with Jada Pinkett Smith and Will Smith, Jay-Z helped produce the play Fela!, a musical celebrating the work of the late Nigerian star Fela Kuti.[102] Jay-Z said he was inspired by the power of Kuti's work and his life story, which resulted in his interest to help produce the musical.[102] Fela! is a story about an African pioneer and political activist who made his first moves on the scene during the 1970s.[102] On January 23, 2010, Jay-Z released a track, \"Stranded (Haiti Mon Amour)\", with Rihanna, and U2's Bono and The Edge, as well as performing it at the Hope For Haiti Now telethon.[103] In June 2010, Eminem and Jay-Z announced they would perform together in a pair of concerts in Detroit and New York. The event was dubbed The Home & Home Tour. The first two concerts rapidly sold out, prompting the scheduling of an additional show at each venue.[104] Jay-Z was the supporting act for U2 on the Australian and New Zealand leg of their U2 360° Tour, beginning in Auckland, New Zealand, in November 2010, followed by Melbourne, Sydney, Brisbane and Perth in December.[105] Jay-Z also appeared on stage during U2 performances of \"Sunday Bloody Sunday\", and in Auckland also on a five-track EP entitled Watch the Throne, although it was later revealed by West that the project had become a full-length LP. Recording sessions for the album took place at various recording locations and began in November 2010. The first single released for the project was \"H•A•M\". The track was co-produced by Lex Luger and West himself. The track ended up being on the deluxe edition of the album. The follow-up to that was the second single \"Otis\", which premiered on Funkmaster Flex's Hot 97 radio show, and was later released to the iTunes Store eleven days later. The song's existence, along with several other tracks from the album, was confirmed during a listening session hosted by Jay-Z.[106] The album was first released on the iTunes Store, five days prior to its being released in physical format, a strategy Jay-Z later said was used to block an internet leak. It debuted at No. 1 on the iTunes Store in 23 countries. It also broke Coldplay's record for most albums sold in one week on the online retailer, selling 290,000 copies on iTunes alone. It held that record until Lil Wayne's Tha Carter IV was released twenty-one days later, selling 10,000 copies more. It debuted on the U.S. Billboard 200 chart at No. 1, selling 436,000 copies in its first week. The album received generally positive reviews. Jay-Z and West later gave a surprise performance of \"Otis\" at the 2011 MTV Video Music Awards. Jay-Z collaborated with M.I.A on her single \"XXXO\", which achieved a fair level of success and went on to become remixed by several producers worldwide. In May 2012, Jay-Z and former Philadelphia mayor Michael A. Nutter announced Jay-Z as the curator and the headliner for the first annual \"Budweiser Made in America\" festival at Fairmount Park in Philadelphia on September 1 and 2, 2012. The performance was produced by Live Nation and assembled an eclectic lineup of \"rock, hip hop, R&B, Latin music and dance\" musicians.[107] Jay-Z and Rihanna were the two main headlining acts for BBC Radio 1's 2012 Hackney Weekend music festival on June 23 to 24.[108] Jay-Z opened his set with an appearance from Rihanna, they performed \"Run this Town\". On September 6, \"Clique\" was released, a single from the album \"Cruel Summer\", by GOOD Music. Kanye West and Big Sean starred alongside Jay-Z on the track. Jay-Z took the subway to his sold-out show at The Barclays Center on October 6, 2012.[109] On November 12, 2012, Coldplay announced that they will be playing with Jay-Z at the Barclays Center in Brooklyn on December 31.[110] On September 23, 2010, Q-Tip confirmed working on Jay-Z's follow-up album to The Blueprint 3, saying the album was to hit stores by spring 2011.[111] In May 2012 it was reported that Jay-Z would work on new music with Roc Nation producer Jahlil Beats. Beats told XXL magazine: \"Me and Jay-Z been going back and forth. He picked a couple of my joints that he's working on. I don't even wanna say too much about Jay, but we definitely working on some stuff. I haven't even sent him a bunch of beats. I sent him my favorite stuff. He hit me right back like, 'Yo, I'ma go in on this,' or, 'I like this.'\"[112] The album has been named one of the most anticipated albums of 2013 by Complex Magazine, MTV, and XXL. Production will come from Jahlil Beats, Kanye West, Rick Rubin, Swizz Beatz, Timbaland, and Pharrell Williams.[113][114] Jay-Z also made an appearance on Justin Timberlake's comeback single \"Suit & Tie\" from his third studio album The 20/20 Experience, the song itself was produced by both Jay-Z and Timberlake's mutual friend, Timbaland.[115] Timberlake and Jay-Z embarked on the co-headlining Legends of the Summer Stadium Tour.[116] During the fifth game of the 2013 NBA Finals, Carter announced his twelfth studio album, Magna Carta Holy Grail, and was released on July 4, 2013. Not long after, Jay-Z confirmed that the hyphen in his stage name would be left out and officially stylized in all capital letters.[117] Magna Carta Holy Grail debuted at number one on the Billboard 200 and sold 528,000 copies in its first week, which bypassed its predicted debut in the range of 350,000 to 400,000.[118] In December 2013, it was announced that Jay-Z had received nine nominations at the 2014 Grammy Awards, more than any other artist.[119] Jay-Z appeared on his wife Beyoncé's self-titled fifth studio album, Beyoncé, with a feature on the song \"Drunk in Love\". They performed this song together at the 56th Annual Grammy Awards opening.[120] The song and its accompanying album would later win three Grammy Awards including Best R&B Performance at the 2015 ceremony. In 2016, he won a lawsuit for the song \"Made in America\" with Kanye West featuring Frank Ocean against Joel McDonald.[121] In early June 2017, posters were displayed in New York City and Los Angeles, and banner ads were placed on the Internet promoting a Tidal-related project titled 4:44.[122] A teaser ad was aired during the NBA Finals on June 7 featuring actors Mahershala Ali, Lupita Nyong'o and Danny Glover in a one-minute video, ending in \"4:44 – 6.30.17, Exclusively on Tidal\". On June 18, the project was confirmed to be a new Jay-Z album, and a clip featuring a song titled \"Adnis\" was posted on Sprint's YouTube page.[122] 4:44 was released through Roc Nation and Universal Music Group, as an exclusive to Sprint and Tidal customers. The album is the first in a planned series of music exclusives from the Sprint–Tidal partnership. For a short time, on July 2, the album was made available for free digital download in Tidal's site. A physical edition was released on July 7, including three additional tracks. On the same day, the album was made available to other streaming platforms, such as Apple Music, Google Play Music and Amazon Music. The album received widespread acclaim from critics, who praised its emotional and personal content. On July 5, the album was certified Platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA), in recognition of one million copies purchased by Sprint and offered to consumers as free downloads.[123] It debuted at number one on the U.S. Billboard 200, making it Jay-Z's 13th consecutive studio album to top the chart. The album spawned two singles, the title track \"4:44\" and \"Bam\", as well as several music videos, directed by a variety of high-profile collaborators. The album received a Grammy Award nomination for Album of the Year, while the title track was nominated for Song of the Year and \"The Story of O.J.\" was nominated for Record of the Year at the 60th Annual Grammy Awards.[124] On June 6, 2018, Jay-Z and Beyoncé kicked-off the On the Run II Tour in Cardiff, United Kingdom. Ten days later, at their final London performance, the pair unveiled Everything Is Love, their much-awaited joint studio album, credited under the name The Carters. The pair also released the video for the album's lead single, \"Apeshit\", on Beyoncé's official YouTube channel.[125][126] The song won two awards from eight nominations at the 2018 MTV Video Music Awards.[127] In 2021, Jay-Z was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame along with fellow rapper LL Cool J.[128][129] He also appeared on the song \"Jail\" on Kanye West's 2021 album Donda,[130] which went on to win Grammy Award for Best Rap Song at the 64th Annual Grammy Awards[131] and on the song \"Love All\" from Drake's 2021 album Certified Lover Boy.[132] In 2022, his first feature was a collaboration with fellow rapper Pusha T, \"Neck & Wrist\" featuring Pharrell Williams from Pusha T's album, It's Almost Dry.[133] His feature was succeeded by a four-minute guest appearance on DJ Khaled's album title track, \"God Did\".[134][135] He also was awarded the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Variety Special (Live), as a producer for the Super Bowl LVI halftime show.[136] Jay-Z says his earliest exposure to music was through his parents' record collection, which was mostly of soul artists such as Marvin Gaye and Donny Hathaway. He says \"I grew up around music, listening to all types of people... I'm into music that has soul in it, whether it be rap, R&B, pop music, whatever. As long as I can feel their soul through the wax, that's what I really listen to.\"[137] He often uses excerpts from these artists as samples in his work, particularly in the Kanye West productions included on The Blueprint.[137] Known for his lyrical prowess which often utilises double entendres, witty wordplays, and mixes messages with braggadocio, his music often describes his rise from poverty to vast wealth.[138][139][140][141][142] Royce da 5'9\" and Fredro Starr of Onyx both describe Jay-Z's emphasis on flow in the book How to Rap—Starr says that Jay-Z is \"a master of the flow—he can flow fast, he can flow slow\".[143] The book describes how Jay-Z uses 'rests' to provide structure to a verse[144] and how he uses 'partial linking' to add more rhymes to a verse.[145] Jay-Z's early style is described by Vibe as \"a distinctly Das EFX-type, stiggety style\" on his 12\" single \"Can't Get With That\",[146] referring to the fast rhythms and vocal delivery of the group Das EFX. He is also known to write lyrics in his head, as described by Pusha T of Clipse in How to Rap,[147] a style popular with many MCs such as The Notorious B.I.G.,[147] Everlast,[148] Bobby Creekwater[149] and Guerilla Black.[149] Shock G of Digital Underground describes Jay-Z's live performance style, saying he \"rarely breaks a sweat, and instead uses smoothness and clever wordplay to keep the audience interested and entertained\".[150] Jay-Z's fast rapping technique, also known as the \"triplet rhyme\", was developed during his early years of creating music with former mentor Jaz-O.[151][152] Jay-Z has also established himself as a successful entrepreneur with a business empire spanning a variety of industries from clothing lines, beverages, real estate, sport teams, and record labels.[153] In an interview, he stated that \"my brands are an extension of me. They're close to me. It's not like running GM, where there's no emotional attachment.\"[154] Jay-Z and Damon Dash are the founders of the urban clothing brand Rocawear.[155] Rocawear has clothing lines and accessories for men, women and children. The line was taken over by Jay-Z in early 2006 following a falling out with Dash. In March 2007, Jay-Z sold the rights to the Rocawear brand to Iconix Brand Group for $204 million. He retains his stake in the company and continues to oversee the marketing, licensing and product development.[155][156] Jay-Z became the first rapper in Reebok's history to endorse the company's footwear, signing a three-year endorsement deal.[157] He later appeared in a 2003 Reebok collection advertising his S. Carter Collection.[158] Later that year, he and frenemy 50 Cent appeared in a commercial to promote their S. Carter and G-Unit footwears for the company, with a Just Blaze-produced song made for it.[159] In 2006, Jay-Z's deal with Reebok expired with no renewal.[157] In 2014, Jay-Z invested $200 million in Armand de Brignac champagne—owned at the time by Sovereign Brands, a New York–based wine and spirits company—for a 100 percent stake, making it the second alcoholic product acquisition in his financial investment portfolio.[160][161] The brand is known for its popularity with high-profile artists as being the gold bottles often referred to in media.[162][163][164][165][166] His ties to the company date back to 2006, and he received millions of dollars per year for his association with Armand de Brignac before he bought the entire company.[167] Jay-Z serves as co-brand director for Budweiser Select and collaborates with the company on strategic marketing programs and creative ad development. He provides direction on brand programs and ads that appear on TV, radio, print, and high-profile events.[168] In March 2015, Jay-Z completed the $56 million acquisition of Aspiro, a Norwegian media technology company that operates the subscription-based music streaming service Tidal, which has been in operation since October 2014.[169] The music service was acquired through his company Project Panther Bidco Ltd. (an entity indirectly owned by Jay-Z's S. Carter Enterprises a company holding interests in leading international music, media and entertainment companies).[170][171] The music service combines audio and music videos with curated editorial. The main idea of the service is to bring major revenue streams back to the music artists themselves as the idea of an artist-owned streaming platform was stated as to \"restore the value to music by launching a service owned by artists.\" Jay-Z currently[when?] is a major shareholder in the company.[172][173] In July 2015, Carter made a significant investment to JetSmarter, an app helping people book private executive plane flights. The app was built by Sergey Petrossov.[174] From 2005 to 2007, Jay-Z was inaugurated as the president of Def Jam Recordings. Under Jay-Z's leadership, Def Jam launched the successful careers of contemporary R&B singers Rihanna and Ne-Yo. At the end of 2007, after he released American Gangster, Jay-Z decided not to renew his contract as the president and CEO of Def Jam. Shortly after, he started his Live Nation venture, Roc Nation.[175] In April 2011, it was reported that Jay-Z had outbid executives at Universal Music and Jive Records to acquire independent record label Block Starz Music.[176][177] For a decade (2003–2013), Jay-Z enjoyed his role as a part-owner of the Brooklyn Nets NBA team, having paid a reported $1 million for his share, which declined in value to $350,000 in April 2013, based on Forbes magazine's valuation of the team.[178] He encouraged the team's relocation to Brooklyn's Barclays Center (from New Jersey) in the 2012–2013 season, at which point the team took on the Brooklyn Nets moniker.[179][180] On April 18, 2013, Jay-Z officially announced through his Life + Times website in a press release that he would be relinquishing his ownership in the Brooklyn Nets.[181] The shares were eventually sold to singer, rapper, actor and entrepreneur Will Pan, making Pan the first American of Taiwanese descent to own a U.S. professional sports franchise.[182][183] Jay-Z's cited Pan's athletic background (he was a team captain of his high school basketball team and played in college), his multitude of musical styles, his influence in the Taiwanese American community, and his business acumen and portfolio (including being the founder and chief executive of software company Camigo Media and a co-founder of streetwear boutique N.P.C [New Project Center]), as reasons why his bid was successful.[182][183] In September 2013, his stake in Barclays Center was sold for $1.5 million.[184] On April 2, 2013, ESPN reported Jay-Z's plans to launch his own sports agency, Roc Nation Sports, with a focus on the representation of various professional athletes. The sport management group is a partnership with Creative Artists Agency.[185] In conjunction with the agency's launch, New York Yankees's second baseman Robinson Canó left agent Scott Boras to sign with the company. ESPN also mentioned that Jay-Z himself was planning to be a certified sports agent, first in baseball and eventually in basketball and football. In order to represent clients in basketball, he would have to give up his small share of the Brooklyn Nets.[185][186] In October 2005, he was reported in English media as considering buying a stake of Arsenal F.C., an English soccer team.[187] Through his conglomerate company Gain Global Investments Network LLC, he had an interest estimated between 2 and 7% in the Aqueduct Entertainment Group (AEG) consortium, which in January 2010 was awarded a contract to operate a 4,500-slot-machine racino at the Aqueduct Race Track. Jay-Z became interested in the project after New York Governor David Paterson who awarded the contract said there had to be an affirmative action component to the ownership. Jay-Z was initially approached by casino mogul Steve Wynn, who was also bidding on the contract. On March 9, 2010, Jay-Z and Flake withdrew from the project, and Paterson recused himself from further involvement.[188][189] On April 5, 2011, Jay-Z launched the popular culture and lifestyle online magazine Life + Times. It features content that showcases his high-end tastes in clothing, appliances, and cars. The site design is aesthetically aimed at the upwardly mobile young male demographic, with sports and music-related posts accompanying those about fashion and design.[190] Among the music content is the Decoded series, originating from Jay-Z's memoir of the same name and featuring a select rapper deciphering their own lyrics.[191] In January 2015, after being contacted by the webzine, the DJ and radio host Funkmaster Flex revealed that he had been contacted in 2013 for a story about a digital app he made at the time, but alleged that the information was instead used to help launch the Magna Carta Samsung app for the release of Jay-Z's album of the same name. \"But I was good with that. I ate that. Everybody's out here hustling\", Flex reasoned to Vibe.[192] In 2016, he signed a two-year exclusive film and TV Deal with Weinstein Company and with the deal gives them first-look options to create scripted and unscripted TV projects and film projects, and those projects were in works.[193] As part of his deal with Weinstein company, he produced a documentary series on the life of Kalief Browder who was imprisoned for three years and committed suicide upon his release. He also addressed racial profiling and police brutality in a conscious manner.[194] Jay-Z also co-owns the 40/40 Club, an upscale sports bar that started in New York City, and has since expanded to Atlantic City and Chicago. In 2008, the 40/40 Club in Las Vegas was closed down and bought back by the hotel after attendance steadily declined.[195] In 2005, Jay-Z became an investor in Carol's Daughter, a line of beauty products, including products for hair, skin, and hands.[196] In 2010, he announced plans to expand his 40/40 Club sports bar chain into as many as 20 airports, joining his Roc Nation business partners, husband and wife Juan and Desiree Perez, in a deal with Delaware North.[197] On November 16, 2010, Jay-Z published a memoir entitled Decoded.[198][199] The memoir was co-signed by Dream Hampton.[200] Parlux fragrances sued Jay-Z for $18 million for the failure of his cologne, Gold. They claim the cologne's failure is due to Jay-Z not doing social media posts and interviews about the cologne. Parlux claims they projected selling $15 million the first year, and $35 million the second, and subsequent years after the launch. The fragrance sold $14 million the first year and $6.1 million the second.[201] Parlux lost money on the venture and have had constant returns of unsold inventory.[202] Jay-Z collaborated with Cohiba to launch his own cigars.[203] In August 2020, Jay-Z's Roc Nation partnered with Brooklyn's Long Island University to establish the Roc Nation School of Music, Sports & Entertainment.[204] In November 2020, it was announced that Jay-Z would be join TPCO Holding Corp., a newly formed cannabis products company, in the role of \"Chief Visionary Officer\".[205] On December 5, 2022, Jay-Z and the Roc Nation announced their partnership with Caesars Entertainment to build and operate a casino property at Times Square.[206] In 2002, Jay-Z and singer Beyoncé collaborated on the song \"'03 Bonnie & Clyde\". He also appeared on Beyoncé's hit single, \"Crazy in Love\" the following year, as well as the song \"That's How You Like It\" from her debut album Dangerously in Love (2003). On her second album, B'Day, he made appearances on the hits \"Déjà Vu\" and \"Upgrade U\". In the video for the latter song, she comically imitates his appearance.[207] They kept a low profile while dating, and were married on April 4, 2008, in a private ceremony in Tribeca, New York City.[208] Their relationship became a matter of public record on April 22, 2008,[209] although Beyoncé did not publicly debut her US$5 million Lorraine Schwartz-designed wedding ring until the Fashion Rocks concert on September 5, 2008.[210] Since their marriage, they generally avoid discussing their relationship,[211] and Beyoncé has stated her belief that this has helped them, while Jay-Z agreed in a People article that they do not \"play with [their] relationship\".[212] In 2006, Beyoncé and Jay-Z were listed as the most powerful couple for Time magazine's 100 most influential people.[213] In January 2009, Forbes ranked them as Hollywood's top-earning couple, with a combined total of $162 million.[214] They made it to the top of the list the following year, with a combined total of US$122 million between June 2008 and June 2009.[214] At the 2011 MTV Video Music Awards, Beyoncé revealed that she was pregnant with their first child.[215][216] Their daughter, Blue Ivy Carter, was born at New York's Lenox Hill Hospital on January 7, 2012.[217] Jay-Z released \"Glory\", a song dedicated to Blue Ivy, through his Life+Times website on January 9, 2012.[218] The song, produced by frequent collaborators the Neptunes, detailed the couple's pregnancy struggles, including a miscarriage Beyoncé had suffered.[218] Blue Ivy's cries were included at the end of the song, and she was officially credited on the song as \"B.I.C\"; she became the youngest person in Billboard history (at two days old) have a chart entry when \"Glory\" debuted at No. 74 on Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs.[219] On June 18, 2017, Beyoncé's father Mathew Knowles confirmed that she had given birth to twins with Jay-Z, a daughter named Rumi and a son named Sir.[220] In the following months, they purchased a US$88 million home in the Bel Air neighborhood of Los Angeles.[221] In 2023, the couple bought a house in Malibu, California, designed by the architect Tadao Ando, for $200 million. It established a record for the most expensive residence sold in California.[222] On December 2, 1999, Jay-Z, who had come to believe that record executive Lance \"Un\" Rivera was behind the bootlegging of Vol. 3..., allegedly stabbed him at the Kit Kat Klub, a now-defunct night club in Times Square, New York City, during a release party for Q-Tip's album Amplified.[223] Jay-Z's associates at the party were accused of causing a commotion within the club, which Jay-Z allegedly used as cover while he stabbed Rivera in the stomach with a five-inch (127 mm) blade.[224] He surrendered to police the following evening and was placed under arrest, although he was soon released on $50,000 bail.[225][226] When he was indicted in Manhattan Criminal Court in late January 2000, he pleaded not guilty; he and his lawyers contended that they had witnesses and videotapes proving he had been nowhere near Rivera during the incident. Nevertheless, he later pleaded guilty to third-degree assault and accepted a three-year probation sentence.[227] Jay-Z later addressed the case in his 2010 book Decoded: One night I went to Q-Tip's solo album release party and at some point in the night, I ran into the guy everyone's been telling me is behind the bootleg. So I approached him. When I told him what I suspected, to my surprise, he got real loud with me right there in the middle of the club. It was strange. We separated and I went over to the bar. I was sitting there like, \"No the fuck this nigga did not...\" I was talking to people, but I was really talking to myself out loud, just in a state of shock. Before I even realized what I was doing, I headed back over to him, but this time I was blacking out with anger. The next thing I knew, all hell had broken loose in the club. That night the guy went straight to the police and I was indicted. [...] There was no reason to put my life on the line, and the lives of everyone who depends on me, because of a momentary loss of control. [...] I vowed to never allow myself to be in a situation like that again.[228] In 2023, Rivera stated that Jay-Z lied, and was not the one that stabbed him: “No. Jay-Z was not the guy that actually stabbed me that night (...) it’s never been his history”.[229][230][231] In December 2024, Jay-Z, along with Sean \"Diddy\" Combs, was accused in a civil lawsuit of raping a 13-year-old girl at an MTV Video Music Awards after-party in 2000. Jay-Z denied the allegations and described it as a blackmail attempt.[232] Jay-Z responded to the plaintif's lawyer Tony Buzbee on social media that \"No sir, it had the opposite effect! It made me want to expose you for the fraud you are in a VERY public fashion. So no, I will not give you ONE RED PENNY!!\" and his legal team described this allegation as another in a long line of lies about Combs.[233] During his first retirement from music,[failed verification] Jay-Z became involved in philanthropy. In 2003, along with his mother, Jay-Z founded the Shawn Carter Foundation, which assists eligible students facing socio-economic hardships attend and get through college.[234] In August 2006, he met with Kofi Annan, then Secretary-General of the United Nations at the organization's New York City headquarters, where he pledged to use his upcoming world tour to raise awareness of the global water shortage, a challenge he learned about following a visit to Africa by Bono, the lead singer of U2.[235] The effort took place in partnership with the UN,[236] as well as MTV, which produced a documentary entitled Diary of Jay-Z: Water for Life, first airing in November 2006.[237] Along with Sean \"Diddy\" Combs, Jay-Z pledged $1 million to the American Red Cross's relief effort after Hurricane Katrina.[238] Jay-Z supported Kanye West after West's outburst against President George W. Bush during a live Katrina charity telethon.[239] He also addressed the Katrina disaster and the federal government's response in his one-verse song \"Minority Report\".[240] Jay-Z has said that \"the greatest form of giving is anonymous to anonymous\". In 2013, author dream hampton, who co-wrote Jay-Z's book Decoded, revealed that Jay-Z had established a trust fund for Sean Bell's children.[241] Jay-Z donated to bail out protestors arrested during 2015 activism against police brutality.[242][243] In March 2020, Jay-Z donated $1 million through the Shawn Carter Foundation to aid in relief during the COVID-19 pandemic in New York.[244] In April 2020, along with Meek Mill, he donated over 100,000 face masks to U.S. prisons to assist in protecting prison inmates from COVID-19.[245] In 2006, Jay-Z appeared with Russell Simmons in a public service announcement denouncing racism and anti-Semitism, sponsored by the Foundation for Ethnic Understanding.[246] In 2008, Jay-Z was involved in the 2008 United States presidential election, supporting enhanced voter participation.[247] He supported the 2008 presidential candidacy of Barack Obama and performed voter-drive concerts financed by the Democrats' campaign.[248] He also became acquainted with Obama, who in June 2008 said, \"Every time I talk to Jay-Z, who is a brilliant talent and a good guy, I enjoy how he thinks. That's somebody who is going to start branching out and can help shape attitudes in a real positive way.\"[249] During the 2010 mid-term elections, Jay-Z appeared with other artists in a HeadCount advertisement, urging voters, especially younger ones, to register and vote.[250] In May 2012, Jay-Z endorsed President Obama's support of same-sex marriage[251] and participated in his re-election campaign.[252] Musician and civil rights activist Harry Belafonte was critical of Jay-Z and Beyoncé for what he saw as their safe political stances, saying that they \"have turned their back on social responsibility\".[253] In the 2016 U.S. presidential election, Jay-Z and Beyoncé appeared at a Hillary Clinton rally in Cleveland.[254] Clinton praised Jay-Z for addressing racism, oppression, and the criminal justice system.[255] He described Donald Trump as a \"superbug\" and condemned remarks he perceived as racist,[256] but later said that Trump's rhetoric forced people to come together and address difficult issues such as white privilege.[257] Solo studio albums Collaborative albums In 2006, he was enstooled as the Sarkin Waka of Kwara in the Nigerian chieftaincy system.[264]",

                "content": "Shawn Corey Carter (born December 4, 1969), known professionally as Jay-Z (stylized as JAY-Z),[a] is an American rapper, songwriter, record producer, record executive, actor, and entrepreneur. He is the former CEO of Def Jam Recordings and Roc-A-Fella Records. Jay-Z co-owns The 40/40 Club and the Brooklyn Nets NBA team. He is one of the most financially successful hip-hop artists and businessmen in America.[8] Jay-Z has several nicknames, \"Jigga\", \"Hova\" and \"El Presidente\". In June 2019, it was reported that Jay-Z had become the first billionaire rapper.[9] Jay-Z was born as Shawn Corey Carter in the Brooklyn borough of New York City. He was raised in Marcy Houses, a housing project in Brooklyn's Bedford–Stuyvesant. After their father Adnis Reeves abandoned the family, Jay-Z and his three siblings were raised by their mother, Gloria Carter. Reeves would later meet and reconcile with Jay-Z shortly before dying in 2003. Jay-Z claims in his lyrics that in 1982, at age 12, he shot his older brother in the shoulder for stealing his jewelry. Along with rapper AZ he attended Eli Whitney High School in Brooklyn until it was closed. He then attended nearby George Westinghouse Career and Technical Education High School with rappers The Notorious B.I.G. and Busta Rhymes, followed by a stint at Trenton Central High School in Trenton, New Jersey, though he did not graduate. According to his interviews and lyrics, he sold crack cocaine and was shot at three times during this period. According to his mother, Jay-Z used to wake up his siblings at night banging out drum patterns on the kitchen table. She bought him a boombox for his birthday, sparking his interest in music, and he began freestyling and writing lyrics. Known as \"Jazzy\" around the neighborhood, he later adopted the stage name \"Jay-Z\" in homage to his mentor Jaz-O. Jay-Z can be briefly heard on several of Jaz-O's early recordings in the late 1980s and early 1990s, including \"H. P. Gets Busy\", \"The Originators\" and \"Hawaiian Sophie\". Jay-Z became embroiled in several battles with rapper LL Cool J in the early 1990s. He first became known to a wide audience on the posse cut \"Show and Prove\" on the 1994 Big Daddy Kane album Daddy's Home. Jay-Z has been referred to as Big Daddy Kane's hype man during this period, although Kane explains that he did not fill the traditional hype man role, and was instead basically making cameo appearances on stage. \"When I would leave the stage to go change outfits, I would bring out Jay-Z and Positive K and let them freestyle until I came back to the stage.\" The young Jay-Z appeared on a popular song by Big L, \"Da Graveyard\", and on Mic Geronimo's \"Time to Build\", which also featured early appearances by DMX and Ja Rule in 1995. His first official rap single was called \"In My Lifetime\", for which he released a music video in 1995. An unreleased music video was also produced for the B-side \"I Can't Get with That.\" In 2003, Jay-Z stopped rapping, because he found that there were not enough good rappers to compete with him. He said that the game was too easy for him. He decided to concentrate more on his producer career than his rap career. He became the president of Def Jam Recordings. He signed a lot of great artists such as Rihanna, Ne-Yo and Kanye West. He also became a businessman by creating his own clothing company, Rocawear, and owning a part of the Brooklyn Nets, an NBA basketball team. After a step back in his career, he made a decision in 2006 to come back into the game. He created the albums \"Kingdom Came\" and the year after \"American Gangster\". In 2009, he released Blue print 3, but in 2011 he teamed up with Kanye West to do an LP called Watch the Throne. This album went triple hit, made the top rap charts for August and also nominated for the Grammy for the best rap Album. Now, he is known to be one of the best rappers of all time. In April 2011 Jay-Z started a website called Life+ Times. He also took part in Barack Obama’s last elections.[10] Jay-Z's twelfth album, Magna Carta Holy Grail, was released in July 2013. The album topped the chart to number one. It was nominated for Album of the Year at the 2013 BET Hip Hop Awards. The first single on the album, \"Holy Grail\", features Justin Timberlake singing in it. It reached number four on the US Billboard 100.[11] In South Korea it reached number one. Jay-Z's wife Beyoncé sings on \"Part II (On the Run)\". In December 2013 Jay-Z was nominated for nine Grammy Awards. This was more than anyone else that year.[12] He rapped on his wife Beyoncé Knowles' fifth album Beyoncé. Together with Beyoncé, Jay-Z has three children: daughter Blue Ivy (born January 7th, 2012)[13] and twins Rumi and Sir Carter.[14] JAY-Z has released the following albums during his career:",

                "content": "Our editors will review what you’ve submitted and determine whether to revise the article. JAY-Z (born December 4, 1969, Brooklyn, New York, U.S.) is an American rapper and entrepreneur, one of the most influential figures in hip-hop in the 1990s and early 21st century. Shawn Carter grew up in Brooklyn’s often dangerous Marcy Projects, where he was raised mainly by his mother. His firsthand experience with illicit drug dealing would inform his lyrics when he began rapping under the stage name Jazzy, soon shortened to Jay-Z (a name that may also have been derived from the proximity of the J and Z subway lines to the Marcy Projects). Jay-Z and two friends founded their own company, Roc-A-Fella Records, to release his debut album, Reasonable Doubt (1996), which eventually sold more than a million copies in the United States. A string of successful albums followed at a rate of at least one per year through 2003. Vol. 2: Hard Knock Life (1998) not only was the first of Jay-Z’s releases to top the Billboard 200 album chart but also won him his first Grammy Award, for best rap album. The critically acclaimed The Blueprint (2001), featuring the triumphant hit “Izzo (H.O.V.A.),” solidified his status as one of the preeminent voices in hip-hop at the dawn of the 21st century. Shortly after its release, Jay-Z pleaded guilty to assault relating to a 1999 nightclub stabbing and received three years’ probation, but the incident did little to derail his career. Ahead of the release of The Black Album (2003), however, Jay-Z announced his retirement as a performer. The ostensible farewell recording proved to be one of his most popular, with the brash single “99 Problems,” produced by Rick Rubin, attracting considerable attention. In 2004 he assumed the presidency of Def Jam Recordings, making him one of the most highly placed African American executives in the recording industry at the time. Postretirement, Jay-Z stayed remarkably active in music. He collaborated with the rock group Linkin Park in 2004, and he appeared as a guest vocalist on the recordings of numerous other artists, including Kanye West, whose career he had helped foster, and Beyoncé, whom he had begun dating. (The two were married in 2008.) Jay-Z also developed a large portfolio of business ventures and investments, including a film-production company, a clothing line, and a stake in the New Jersey Nets of the National Basketball Association, which he later helped relocate to his hometown of Brooklyn. He formally returned to recording in 2006 with Kingdom Come. In 2007, shortly after releasing the album American Gangster, he stepped down as Def Jam president. He founded a new label, Roc Nation, in 2008, and it soon became a full-service entertainment conglomerate. Jay-Z proved that he remained one of rap’s most-bankable acts when he embarked on a highly successful tour with Mary J. Blige in 2008. The following year he released The Blueprint 3, which bore the sound of some of his most frequent producers, including West and Timbaland. The album generated such hits as “Empire State of Mind,” a musical love letter to New York City adorned with soaring guest vocals by Alicia Keys, and the determined “Run This Town,” which featured West and Rihanna. Both songs won Grammy Awards, as did two other singles from the album. Watch the Throne (2011), an ambitious and highly regarded collaboration with West, proved to be similarly fruitful, with the singles “Otis,” “Niggas in Paris,” and “No Church in the Wild” capturing Grammys as well. In between the two releases, Jay-Z published a memoir, Decoded (2010). Jay Z (having dropped the hyphen from his name) returned in 2013 with Magna Carta Holy Grail, which, in an exclusive deal with Samsung, was made available for free to users of the company’s smartphones several days ahead of its official release. Although the album, on which the rapper reflected on his massive wealth and fame, was greeted with mostly lukewarm reviews, it became his 13th release to land at number one on the Billboard 200. It also produced two Grammy wins: one for best rap/sung collaboration for “Holy Grail” and another for best music video for “Suit & Tie.” He received two more Grammys a year later for his collaboration on Beyoncé’s song “Drunk in Love.” In 2017 JAY-Z (having capitalized the letters and reinstated the hyphen in his name) released his 13th studio solo album, 4:44, an extremely candid album that was, in part, a response to Beyoncé’s Lemonade (2016), on which she accused her husband of adultery. He admitted to infidelity on various tracks and also addressed racism and politics. The couple’s albums were both released exclusively on TIDAL—a subscription-based music streaming service that JAY-Z owned alongside other artists. JAY-Z had acquired the service in 2015 when he purchased its parent, the Norwegian technology company Aspiro AB. Also in 2017 JAY-Z became the first rapper to be inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame. In 2018 he and Beyoncé, billed as the Carters, unveiled the collaborative effort Everything Is Love, for which they won the Grammy for best urban contemporary album. In 2021 JAY-Z was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.",

                "content": "Senior Writer SANTA CLARA, Calif. – The 49ers defeated the Bears 38-13 Sunday at Levi's Stadium. In the first half, Brock Purdy completed 16 of 18 passes for 258 yards with two touchdowns and a 155.8 passer rating. He finished the game connecting on 20 of 25 passes for 325 yards and a 145.4 rating. Caleb Williams threw two TD passes to Rome Odunze in the second half. The first was a 4-yarder that capped a 16-play, 70-yard drive to open the third quarter, cutting the deficit to 24-6. The second was a 14-yarder that drew the Bears to within 31-13 with 11:48 remaining in the fourth period. After the game, Thomas Brown did not sugarcoat what happened in his first game as Bears interim head coach. \"I'll always be straightforward, honest and open about things that transpired,\" Brown said. \"We've got to do a better job of putting [in] a better game plan on both sides of the ball so we execute better. Obviously [I will] continue to challenge our guys to be at their best. Also encourage those guys and also demand that we still stay unified.\" Williams completed 17 of 23 passes for 134 yards and a 116.9 passer rating before being replaced by Tyson Bagent with 1:59 remaining. The rookie quarterback extended his streak without throwing an interception to 255 pass attempts, the most in history by a Bears quarterback and an NFL rookie. The 49ers offense was led by tight end George Kittle, who had six receptions for 151 yards. Jauan Jennings caught seven passes for 90 yards and two TDs. The 49ers opened the game with a 5-play, 70-yard drive capped by Purdy's 7-yard touchdown pass to Jennings, giving San Francisco a 7-0 lead. Purdy completed 4 of 4 passes for 70 yards on the 5-play, 70-yard drive. The 49ers increased their lead to 14-0 on Isaac Guerendo's 1-yard touchdown run with 1:39 left in the first quarter. Guerendo, a rookie fourth-round pick, made his first NFL start Sunday, after Christian McCaffrey and Jordan Mason sustained season-ending injuries last Sunday night in a loss to the Bills. San Francisco extended its lead to 21-0 on Purdy's 16-yard TD pass to Jennings midway through the second quarter and made it 24-0 on Jake Moody's 23-yard field goal with 1:50 left in the first half. \"It's a grown man's business,\" Brown said. \"There is no lay down or quit in our football team, which I do love. But we've got to do a better job of trying to find ways of starting the games faster, particularly on the offensive side of the ball.\" \"It's not something that you want to do because that puts you behind in games,\" Williams said. \"When you're behind in games, which we've been in a couple of these past games, you've got to come back and it's a taller task … If you can get out and jump on people and these teams and impose your will, that's obviously what you want to do early in games and we haven't been doing that.\" After the Bears closed the gap to 24-6, the 49ers widened the margin to 31-6 on Guerendo's 4-yard TD run on the first play of the fourth quarter. After Odunze's second TD, San Francisco increased its lead to 38-13 on running back Patrick Taylor Jr.'s 3-yard TD run with 5:15 to play. With the loss, the Bears fell to 4-9. Their next game will be played a week from Monday night against the Vikings in Minneapolis. Check out the action as the Bears battle the San Francisco 49ers at Levi's Stadium. Bears rookie Caleb Williams threw three touchdown passes in the second half Thanksgiving Day in Detroit, but it wasn't enough to overcome a 16-0 halftime deficit in a 23-20 loss to the Lions. The Bears rallied in dramatic fashion to force overtime Sunday at Soldier Field, but the Vikings escaped with a 30-27 victory. The Bears nearly pulled off a remarkable comeback win over the rival Packers Sunday at Soldier Field. But Cairo Santos' 46-yard field goal attempt was blocked as time expired, enabling Green Bay to escape with a 20-19 victory. The Bears were held out of the end zone and generated only 142 yards of offense in a 19-3 loss to the Patriots Sunday at Soldier Field. The Bears were held out of the end zone and allowed 213 rushing yards in a 29-9 loss to the Cardinals Sunday in Arizona. After the Bears overcame a 12-point second-half deficit to take the lead with :25 remaining, Washington's 52-yard Hail Mary as time expired gave the Commanders an 18-15 victory Sunday at Northwest Stadium. Caleb Williams threw a career-high four touchdown passes—two to Cole Kmet and two to Keenan Allen—to lead the Bears to an exciting 35-16 win over the Jaguars Sunday at Tottenham Hotspur Stadium. A breakout performance by the offense and another stifling effort by the defense led the Bears to a dominant 36-10 win over the Panthers Sunday at Soldier Field. The defense allowed only one touchdown and running back D'Andre Swift generated 165 yards from scrimmage and a TD in leading the Bears to a 24-18 win over the Los Angeles Rams Sunday at Soldier Field. The Bears scored their only two touchdowns of Sunday's game against the Colts in the fourth quarter but couldn't overcome another double-digit deficit in a 21-16 loss at Lucas Oil Stadium. The Bears fell behind by double digits Sunday night in Houston for the second straight game. But unlike last weekend's exciting comeback win over the Titans, they were unable to mount a rally in a 19-13 loss to the Texans. © Chicago Bears. All rights reserved.",

                "content": "If not listed, please contact your TV provider. SANTA CLARA, Calif. (AP) After weeks of shaky play, the San Francisco 49ers got back to their old form with one of the most dominant first halves in years. Brock Purdy threw for 325 yards and two touchdowns and the 49ers bounced back from two blowout losses to beat Chicago 38-13 on Sunday and spoil interim coach Thomas Brown's debut for the Bears. “We just got back to being us, honestly,” linebacker Fred Warner said. “The product we were putting on the field the last couple weeks just wasn’t us. We knew that. We had a great opportunity this week to come out at home and right those wrongs and get back to playing our style and what we do best.” The 49ers (6-7) had been outscored by 53 points the past two weeks in losses at Green Bay and Buffalo that left their playoff hopes teetering with several stars such as Christian McCaffrey, Nick Bosa and Trent Williams sidelined by injuries. That prompted coach Kyle Shanahan to have Purdy and cornerback Deommodore Lenoir address the team at a meeting Saturday night that resonated with the team. “The message was we need to play with more of a sense of urgency and play desperate,” tight end George Kittle said. “Because you just hadn't really sensed that.” But San Francisco delivered a performance more reminiscent of a year ago when the Niners went to the Super Bowl, handing the Bears (4-9) their seventh straight loss after outgaining them by 315 yards on the way to a 24-0 halftime lead. Purdy delivered his third 300-yard passing game of the season with two TDs to Jauan Jennings, fill-in back Isaac Guerendo gained 128 yards from scrimmage and scored on two TD runs and Kittle had six catches for 151 yards. That helped deliver the highest-scoring game of the season for the 49ers. “I think we just all executed, did our job and kept it simple,” Purdy said. “I think guys weren’t overthinking anything. Just whatever was called we trusted in Kyle and executed.” The defense did the rest with strong pressure from the four-man line that led to rookie Caleb Williams getting sacked seven times. The Bears were looking for an emotional boost from the first in-season firing of a head coach in franchise history after letting Matt Eberflus go following a late-game clock mismanagement on Thanksgiving at Detroit. Instead they came up on the short end of one of the most lopsided first halves in recent memory. Chicago was outgained 319-4 in the first half for the ninth-largest discrepancy since 1991, managed only one first down and trailed by 24 points at the break. The Bears allowed Purdy and the San Francisco offense to move down the field with little resistance with the Niners scoring three TDs and one field goal on their first five possessions. Chicago couldn't move the ball at all on offense, generating minus-3 yards passing thanks to four sacks and losing 37 yards on five failed third down attempts. “We got our ass kicked today,” Williams said. “There’s no way around it. We got it handed to us. Offense, defense special teams, we have to come out and be better.\" Williams managed to throw two touchdown passes to Rome Odunze in the second half, but it was too late to get the Bears back into the game. Williams finished 17 for 34 for 134 yards and lost a fumble, but had his seventh straight start without an interception. Williams’ 56 sacks this season are the most for any Chicago quarterback since the 1970 AFL-NFL merger. Bears: Returner DeAndre Carter (hamstring) left in the first quarter and didn't return. ... RB Travis Homer (head) left the game in the second half. 49ers: Guerendo left the game in the fourth quarter with a foot injury. Shanahan said the team would know more about the severity on Monday. ... LG Ben Bartch (high ankle sprain) left the game in the first half and didn't return. Bartch was starting in place of the injured Aaron Banks and the Niners were forced to use third-stringer Spencer Burford the rest of the way.

                "title": "San Francisco 49ers 38, Chicago Bears 13: Grades",
                "content": "SANTA CLARA -- The San Francisco 49ers just kept their season alive with a 38-13 statement win over the Chicago Bears. Here are the 49ers' grades for this performance. One of the best performances of Brock Purdy's career. He hit 80 percent of his throws, completed passes to seven different receivers, threw for 325 yards and 2 touchdowns and posted a passer rating of 145.4. Finally, he stopped forcing passes to Deebo Samuel, who has been killing the 49ers' offense all season (more on him in a minute). Instead, Purdy threw six passes to George Kittle and eight passes to Jauan Jennings. Those are the two best receivers on the team and they should have been featured consistently this year. Last week, Kittle caught just one pass. Afterward, Purdy said his progressions didn't take him to Kittle. With all due respect, screw your progressions, Brock. Find your best players. And that's exactly what he did today. He's growing up. And now he has four more games to show he's worth a multi-year contract that will make him one of the highest-paid players in the NFL. No offense to Christian McCaffrey, but the 49ers are better without him this season. In four games with him, they averaged just 15 points per game. In 9 games without him, the 49ers are averaging 27.6 points per game. And that's because the 49ers get all of their playmakers involved when McCaffrey is out. Today, Isaac Guerendo started the first game of his career and scored two touchdowns. He also had a 30-yard run, a 27-yard catch and a 23-yard catch. He's a big play waiting to happen and he should have had a role in the offense all season. Unfortunately for the 49ers, he left the game with a foot injury after 15 carries. Perhaps he couldn't handle such a big work load. His replacement, Patrick Taylor Jr., gained just 25 yards on 7 carries. The 49ers need Guerendo to play this Thursday against the Rams. Two targets, one catch, three yards. But hey, at least he didn't fumble at the goal line like last week. Jauan Jennings was outstanding -- seven catches for 90 yards and 2 touchdowns. He deserves another contract extension. He already has outperformed the two-year deal the 49ers gave him this offseason. His counterpart, Deebo Samuel, was terrible once again -- three targets, two catches, 22 receiving yards plus five carries for a measly 13 rushing yards. The 49ers averaged just 4.4 yards per play when they handed the ball or threw it to Samuel, and a whopping 7.9 yards per play when they handed it or threw it to anyone else. The 49ers should have traded Samuel this past offseason. Instead, they restructured his contract in a way that will make him incredibly difficult to trade or release this coming offseason. Oops. One of the best games of George Kittle's career. He had six catches for 151 yards. Last week, he had one catch for 7 yards. Afterward, he told the media he hardly ran any routes and that he was open the few times he didn't have to block. Message received. Suddenly, Kyle Shanahan was calling all kinds of exotic screens and play-action passes for Kittle. Shanahan should do that every week. Kittle is the greatest tight end in franchise history and somehow he's still in his prime. They didn't block particularly well in the run game, but they didn't have Trent Williams, Aaron Banks or Ben Bartch and they still gave up just one sack. That's impressive. Yetur Gross-Matos sacked Caleb Williams three times, Leonard Floyd sacked him twice and Maliek Collins sacked him once. The 49ers needed these three to step up while Nick Bosa is out and they did. They held Bears running back D'Andre Swift to just 38 rushing yards and gave up zero rushing touchdowns. And next week, they most likely will get Dre Greenlaw back. Good news. They gave up two touchdown passes and a quarterback rating of 116.9, but they also gave up just 134 yards through the air. Plus Talanoa Hufanga returned from a wrist injury and the 49ers defense improved dramatically with him on the field. The 49ers need to find a way to re-sign him this offseason. He's the biggest playmaker in their secondary even when he's playing with just one hand. Jake Moody didn't miss any field goals but he kicked two kickoffs short of the 20-yard line, which is a penalty. He needs to go this offseason. Finally, Kyle Shanahan did the things we've been begging him to do all season: he stopped playing Kyle Juszczyk so much and instead mostly used one-back formations, he spread the ball around on offense and he called lots of screens and play-action passes which gave Brock Purdy plenty of easy throws. Where was this Kyle Shanahan all season? It seems like McCaffrey's knee injury may have brought the best out of Shanahan because he finally accepted that McCaffrey won't save him and the team this season and that he needs to build an offensive identity without him. And the offensive identity is a diverse, balanced attack featuring Kittle and Jennings, not Samuel and McCaffrey. If only Shanahan had this epiphany in September, the 49ers might not be 6-7. Now let's see if he can keep it up this Thursday against the Rams, who beat the Bills today. The Bears are sorry team that has lost seven games in a row while the Rams have won five of their past seven. The 49ers will need another a-plus performance from Shanahan to win.

                "content": "SANTA CLARA -- This is the live blog for the San Francisco 49ers' Week 14 home game against the Chicago Bears. This will be updated frequently with information and analysis from the press box. 12:15 Here are the 49ers' inactives: DE Nick Bosa (hip, oblique)LT Trent Williams (ankle)LG Aaron Banks (concussion)LB Demetrius Flannigan-Fowles (knee)CB Rock Ya-SinRB Israel AbanikandaQB Joshua Dobbs (emergency 3rd QB) 12:16 This means Talanoa Hufanga is active for today's game. Let's see if he starts in place of Ji'Ayir Brown or Malik Mustapha. 12:17 Here are the Bears' inactives: WR Tyler ScottFS Elijah HicksRB Roschon JohnsonCB Ameer SpeedC Ryan BatesOT Larry BoromDE Dominique Robinson 12:18 This means Bears starting running back D'Andre Swift is active. 12:19 The 49ers should win this game. They're only two games out of first place in their division while the Bears are all but dead. They've lost six games in a row and just fired their head coach last week. They have every excuse to mail it in this week on the road. But I expect them to play harder than the 49ers. Every team plays harder than the 49ers season. Every week, they get pushed around in the trenches. And since 2020, they're 0-5 when both Nick Bosa and Trent Williams don't play. I expect the 49ers offense to struggle on the ground because Isaac Guerendo isn't built to carry a big workload. In the passing game, I expect Brock Purdy to continue to throw short passes and scramble -- his arm seems injured. And on defense, I expect the 49ers to continue to struggle to stop the run. Rookie quarterback Caleb Williams should be able to scramble whenever he wants. FINAL SCORE PREDICTION: 49ers 16, Bears 20. 1:23 The Bears win the coin toss and defer. The 49ers will receive the opening kickoff. 1:30 On 1st and goal from the 7, Brock Purdy completes a touchdown pass to Jauan Jennings running a crossing route toward the back left pylon. Earlier in the drive, Purdy completed a checkdown pass to Isaac Guerendo who ran for 23 yards, then Purdy completed a play-action screen pass to George Kittle who ran for 33 yards. Excellent opening script from Kyle Shanahan. 49ers 7, Bears 0. 1:36 On 3rd and 7 from the Bears 26, Caleb Williams completes a 4-yard pass to backup running back Travis Homer, and the Bears go 3 and out. The 49ers defense is flying to the football and tackling. Where has this team been all year? 1:46 On 3rd and 5 from the 49ers' 49, Brock Purdy gets hit as he throws an incomplete pass over the middle. Through two drives, Isaac Guerendo has just 9 rushing yards on 3 carries. After the punt, the Bears take over at their 6-yard line. 1:51 On 3rd and 10 from the Bears 18, Caleb Williams steps up in the pocket and moves right into Yetur Gross-Matos who records the sacks. After the punt, the 49ers take over at their 36. 1:52 49ers left guard Ben Bartch has an ankle injury and his return is questionable. His replacement is Spencer Burford. 1:57 On 2nd and 6 from the Bears 28, Purdy takes a hit as he throws deep off his back foot to Guerendo who makes a stumbling catch and gets tagged down at the 1-yard line. Then on the next plays he dives into the end zone for the touchdown. The 49ers are so much better without Christian McCaffrey this season because Kyle Shanahan actually spreads the ball around. 49ers 14, Bears 0. 2:03 On 3rd and 7 from the Bears 33, Leonard Floyd sacks Caleb Williams and the Bears go 3 and out. After the punt, the 49ers take over at their 29 with 5 seconds left in the first quarter. 2:20 On 3rd and 4 from the Bears 16, Purdy throws a touchdown pass to Jauan Jennings who ran a slant and was wide open. That was a 12-play drive that took 7:24 off the clock. George Kittle already has 106 receiving yards. The 49ers should have been featuring him like this all season. 49ers 21, Bears 0. 2:24 On 3rd and 5 from the Bears 35, Maliek Collins sacks Caleb Williams. Williams is incredibly indecisive and he hasn't scrambled yet. After the punt, the 49ers take over at their 26. 2:37 On 3rd and goal from the 10, Purdy scrambles for 5 yards, and the Jake Moody makes a 23-yard field goal with 1:50 left in the first half. 49ers 24, Bears 0. 2:44 On 3rd and 2 from the Bears 48, Leonard Floyd sacks Williams and the Bears go 3 and out again. Then they punt, Brock Purdy takes a knee and the first half ends. What a half for the 49ers. 3:11 On 3rd and goal from the 4, Charvarius Ward gives up a touchdown catch to Rome Odunze near the back pylon. Then the Bears go for 2, and tight end Cole Kmet drops a pass in the end zone. 49ers 24, Bears 6. 3:18 On 3rd and 8 from the 49ers' 32, Brock Purdy air mails a deep pass intended for Ricky Pearsall and the 49ers go 3 and out. They ran the ball one time during that series and gained 7 yards. Bad play calling. After the punt, the Bears take over at their 35. 3:29 On 2nd and 8 from the 49ers 30, the ball slips out of Williams' hand as he attempts to pump fake and Evan Anderson recovers at the 49ers 38. 3:37 On 1st and goal from the 4, Guerendo sprints up the middle untouched for his second touchdown of the game. Good thing the 49ers buried him during their 3-game losing streak. 49ers 31, Bears 6. 3:44 On 2nd and 7 from the 49ers 14, Ji'Ayir Brown gives up a touchdown catch to Rome Odunze. Brown is playing in place of Talanoa Hufanga because the game essentially is over. 49ers 31, Bears 13. 4:00 Isaac Guerendo has a foot injury and his return is questionable. 4:04 On second and goal from the 3, Patrick Taylor Jr. dives into the end zone for the touchdown. 49ers 38, Bears 13. 4:10 On 3rd and 10 from the Bears 30, Yetur Gross-Matos sacks Caleb Williams for the second time in this series and the Bears go 3 and out. After the punt, the 49ers take over at midfield. This game is over. Stay tuned for their grades. 4:13 Brandon Allen just threw an interception. Hilarious. Download and follow The Cohn Zohn Podcast.

                "title": "Eagle - Wikipedia",
                "content": "See text Eagle is the common name for the golden eagle, bald eagle, and other birds of prey in the family of the Accipitridae. Eagles belong to several groups of genera, some of which are closely related. True eagles comprise the genus Aquila. Most of the 68 species of eagles are from Eurasia and Africa.[1] Outside this area, just 14 species can be found—two in North America, nine in Central and South America, and three in Australia. Eagles are not a natural group but denote essentially any kind of bird of prey large enough to hunt sizeable (about 50 cm long or more overall) vertebrates. The word \"eagle\" is borrowed into English from Anglo-Norman: eagle and Middle French: aigle, both derived ultimately from Latin: aquila (\"eagle\"). It is cognate with terms such as French: aigle, Portuguese: águia and Spanish: águila.[2] It is broadly synonymous with the less common English term \"erne\" or \"earn\", deriving from Middle English: ern, from Old English: earn, in which it acts as the usual word for the bird. The Old English term is turn derived from Proto-Germanic: *arnuz and is cognate with other synonymous words in Germanic languages such as Swedish: örn, German: Aar and Gothic: ara. Through the Proto-Indo-European root, it is further related to words such as Greek: ὄρνις (\"bird\") and Lithuanian: erelis (\"eagle\"). Although \"erne\" can be used to refer to any eagle, it is most commonly used for the golden eagle or sea-eagle.[3][4] Eagles are large, powerfully-built birds of prey, with heavy heads and beaks. Even the smallest eagles, such as the booted eagle (Hieraaetus pennatus), which is comparable in size to a common buzzard (Buteo buteo) or red-tailed hawk (B. jamaicensis), have relatively longer and more evenly broad wings, and more direct, faster flight, despite the reduced size of their aerodynamic feathers. Most eagles are larger than any other raptors, apart from some vultures. The smallest species of eagle is the Great Nicobar serpent eagle (Spilornis klossi), at 450 g (1 lb) and 40 cm (16 in). The largest species are discussed below. Like all birds of prey, eagles have very large hooked beaks for ripping flesh from their prey, strong, muscular legs, and powerful talons. The beak is typically heavier than that of most other birds of prey. Eagles' eyes are extremely powerful. It is estimated that the wedge-tailed eagle has a visual acuity twice that of a typical human.[5][6][7] This acuity enables eagles to spot potential prey from a very long distance. This keen eyesight is primarily attributed to their extremely large pupils which ensure minimal diffraction (scattering) of the incoming light. Like most diurnal raptors, eagles have little ability to see ultraviolet light.[8] The female of all known species of eagles is larger than the male.[9][10] Eagles normally build their nests, called eyries, in tall trees or on high cliffs. Many species lay two eggs, but the older, larger chick frequently kills its younger sibling once it has hatched. The parents take no action to stop the killing.[11][12] It is said[by whom?] that eagles fly above clouds but this is not true.[citation needed] Eagles fly during storms and glide from the wind's pressure. This saves the bird's energy. Due to the size and power of many eagle species, they are ranked at the top of the food chain as apex predators in the avian world. The type of prey varies by genus. The Haliaeetus and Icthyophaga eagles prefer to capture fish, though the species in the former often capture various animals, especially other water birds, and are powerful kleptoparasites of other birds. The snake and serpent eagles of the genera Circaetus, Terathopius, and Spilornis predominantly prey on the great diversity of snakes found in the tropics of Africa and Asia. The eagles of the genus Aquila are often the top birds of prey in open habitats, taking almost any medium-sized vertebrate they can catch. Where Aquila eagles are absent, other eagles, such as the buteonine black-chested buzzard-eagle of South America, may assume the position of top raptorial predator in open areas. Many other eagles, including the species-rich genus Spizaetus, live predominantly in woodlands and forests. These eagles often target various arboreal or ground-dwelling mammals and birds, which are often unsuspectingly ambushed in such dense, knotty environments. Hunting techniques differ among the species and genera, with some individual eagles having engaged in quite varied techniques based on their environment and prey at any given time. Most eagles grab prey without landing and take flight with it, so the prey can be carried to a perch and torn apart.[13] The bald eagle is noted for having flown with the heaviest load verified to be carried by any flying bird, since one eagle flew with a 6.8 kg (15 lb) mule deer fawn.[14][15] However, a few eagles may target prey considerably heavier than themselves; such prey is too heavy to fly with, thus it is either eaten at the site of the kill or taken in pieces back to a perch or nest. Golden and crowned eagles have killed ungulates weighing up to 30 kg (66 lb) and a martial eagle even killed a 37 kg (82 lb) duiker, 7–8 times heavier than the preying eagle.[13][16] Authors on birds David Allen Sibley, Pete Dunne, and Clay Sutton described the behavioral difference between hunting eagles and other birds of prey thus (in this case the bald and golden eagles as compared to other North American raptors):[17] They have at least one singular characteristic. It has been observed that most birds of prey look back over their shoulders before striking prey (or shortly thereafter); predation is after all a two-edged sword. All hawks seem to have this habit, from the smallest kestrel to the largest Ferruginous – but not the Eagles. Among the eagles are some of the largest birds of prey: only the condors and some of the Old World vultures are markedly larger. It is regularly debated[according to whom?] which should be considered the largest species of eagle. They could be measured variously in total length, body mass, or wingspan. Different lifestyle needs among various eagles result in variable measurements from species to species. For example, many forest-dwelling eagles, including the very large harpy eagle, have relatively short wingspans, a feature necessary for being able to maneuver in quick, short bursts through densely forested habitats.[13] Eagles in the genus Aquila, found almost exclusively in open country, are noted for their ability to soar, and have relatively long wings for their size.[13] These lists of the top five eagles are based on weight, length, and wingspan, respectively. Unless otherwise noted by reference, the figures listed are the median reported for each measurement in the guide Raptors of the World[18] in which only measurements that could be personally verified by the authors were listed.[13] The eagles are generally distributed in all types of habitats and nearly all parts of the world. The birds can be found in northern tundra to tropical rainforests and deserts. In North America, bald eagles and golden eagles are very common. Eagles are often informally divided into four groups.[a][25] The snake eagles are placed in the subfamily Circaetinae. The fish eagles, booted eagles, and harpy eagles have traditionally been placed in the subfamily Buteoninae together with the buzzard-hawks (buteonine hawks) and harriers. Some authors may treat these groups as tribes of the Buteoninae; Lerner & Mindell[26] proposed separating the eagle groups into their own subfamilies of Accipitridae. Sea eagles or fish eagles take fish as a large part of their diets, either fresh or as carrion. Proposed subfamily Haliaeetinae. Genera: Haliaeetus, Icthyophaga. Some authors include Gypohierax angolensis, the \"vulturine fish eagle\" (also called the palm-nut vulture) in this group.[25] However, genetic analyses indicate it is related to a grouping of Neophron–Gypaetus–Eutriorchis (Egyptian vulture, bearded vulture (lammergeier), and Madagascar serpent eagle).[27] The fish eagles have a close genetic relationship with Haliastur and Milvus; the whole group is only distantly related to the Buteo group.[27] Fish eagles exist in every continent throughout the world, except for South America.[28] Although fish eagles can be found in many different places around the world, they have been classified as \"Near Threatened\". Reasons such as overfishing, pollution, habitat destruction, and the use of pesticides have contributed to the species' rapid population drop.[29] The booted eagle is a group of eagle that typically migrates across the Sahara Desert to Europe. It usually reaches Europe around the beginning of March and leaves by the end of September. It's interesting to note that these types of eagles usually mate with the same partner and return to the same areas years later. Female booted eagles usually lay 1-4 eggs, which promptly hatch after 37 to 40 days. Researchers estimate that there are between 3600 and 6900 pairs of booted eagles in Europe, which are mostly situated in the Iberian Peninsula.[30] Booted eagles or \"true eagles\"[25][31] have feathered tarsi (lower legs). Tribe Aquililae or proposed subfamily Aquilinae. Genera: Aquila, Hieraaetus; Spizaetus, Oroaetus, Spizastur; Nisaetus;[27] Ictinaetus, Lophoaetus; Polemaetus; and Stephanoaetus.[25][31] See comments under eagle species for changes to the composition of these genera. Most snake or serpent eagles, as the name suggests, primarily prey on snakes. Despite filling the niche of a snake eagle, genetic studies suggest that the Madagascar serpent eagle (Eutriorchis) is not related to them.[27] Over several decades, a great deal of research has been done on the Snake-eagle's diet, which is mainly made up of reptiles, especially snakes. When it comes to catching snakes, it is generally accepted that the bird exhibits generalist feeding behavior, which means it does not hunt down specific types of snakes but rather feeds on them depending on their availability in the wild.[32] Harpy eagles[25] or \"giant forest eagles\"[24] are large eagles that inhabit tropical forests. The group contains two to six species, depending on the author. Although these birds occupy similar niches and have traditionally been grouped, they are not all related: the solitary eagles are related to the black hawks and the Philippine eagle to the snake eagles. Major new research into eagle taxonomy suggests that the important genera Aquila and Hieraaetus are not composed of nearest relatives, and it is likely that a reclassification of these genera will soon take place, with some species being moved to Lophaetus or Ictinaetus.[26] Family Accipitridae The modern English term for the bird is derived from Latin: aquila by way of French: aigle. The origin of aquila is unknown, but it is believed to possibly derive from aquilus (meaning dark-colored, swarthy, or blackish) as a reference to the plumage of eagles. Old English used the term earn, related to Scandinavia's ørn/örn. It is similar to other Indo-European terms for \"bird\" or \"eagle\", including Greek: ὄρνις (ornís), Russian: орёл (orël), and Welsh: eryr. In the southern part of Finland, near the Gulf of Finland, is the town of Kotka, which literally means \"eagle\", while the town of L'Aquila in the central part of Italy literally means \"the eagle\". In Britain before 1678, eagle referred specifically to the golden eagle, with the other native species, the white-tailed eagle, being known as erne. The modern name \"golden eagle\" for aquila chrysaetos was introduced by the naturalist John Ray.[33] The village of Eagle in Lincolnshire, England, has nothing to do with the bird; its name is derived from the Old English words for \"oak\" and \"wood\" (compare Oakley).[34] In the ancient Sumerian mythology, the mythical king Etana was said to have been carried into heaven by an eagle.[35] Classical writers such as Lucan and Pliny the Elder claimed that the eagle was able to look directly at the sun, and that they forced their fledglings to do the same. Those that blinked would be cast from the nest. This belief persisted until the Medieval era.[36] The eagle is the patron animal of the ancient Greek god Zeus. In particular, Zeus was said to have taken the form of an eagle in order to abduct Ganymede, and there are numerous artistic depictions of the eagle Zeus bearing Ganymede aloft, from Classical times up to the present (see illustrations in the Ganymede (mythology) page.)[37] Eagles appear metaphorically in many translations of the Old Testament. God is spoken of as carrying Israel on \"eagles' wings\" in Exodus 19:4, Isaiah 40:31 compares those who wait on the Lord to flying eagles, and Psalm 103 mentions renewing one's youth \"as the eagle\". In explaining this rejuvenation, Augustine of Hippo says in his commentary on the Psalms that eagles' beaks overgrow as they age and that they break them against rocks to restore them.[38] The translation, however, is uncertain: the word in the Hebrew, נשר, can also be translated vulture,[39] and is listed alongside specific kinds of vulture in Leviticus' discussion of unclean animals. The eagle is also often used in Christian iconography to represent the Gospel of John,[40] and eagle-shaped lecterns are common in Anglican and some Roman Catholic churches.[41] The eagle was believed to be able to look directly into the sun in the same way that the Gospel of John looks directly at Jesus' divinity, and the great distances the eagle flies represent the spread of the gospel to the ends of the earth. The United States eagle feather law stipulates that only individuals of certifiable Native American ancestry enrolled in a federally recognized tribe are legally authorized to obtain eagle feathers for religious or spiritual reasons.[42] In Canada, the poaching of eagle feathers for the booming U.S. market has sometimes resulted in the arrests of First Nations person for the crime.[43] The Moche people of ancient Peru worshiped the eagle and often depicted eagles in their art.[44] The golden eagle was sacred to the Aztec god Huitzilopochtli while the harpy eagle was sacred to Quetzalcoatl.[45] Eagles are an exceptionally common symbol in heraldry, being considered the \"King of Birds\" in contrast to the lion, the \"King of Beasts\". Whereas the lion (e.g. England) usually represents authority, the eagle is the symbol of power. They are particularly popular in Germanic countries such as Austria, due to their association with the Holy Roman Empire. The eagle of the Holy Roman Empire was two-headed, supposedly representing the two divisions, East and West, of the old Roman Empire. This motif, derived from the Byzantine (Eastern Roman) Empire was also adopted by the Russian Empire and is still featured in the Flag of Albania. The Roman eagle was preceded by the eagle of Ptolemaic Egypt and the Achaemenid Empire. In the coat of arms of Kotka, Finland, the eagle is depicted carrying an anchor and the caduceus on its feet. Heraldic eagles are most often found displayed, i.e. with their wings and legs extended. They can also occur close, i.e. with their wings folded, or rising, i.e. about to take flight. The heads, wings, and legs of eagles can also be found independently. Eagles symbolize strength, courage, and independence and are commonly found in the heraldry of many nations across the world. Albania, Andorra, Armenia, Austria, Dagestan, Egypt, Germany, Ghana, Iraq, Jordan, Kazakhstan, Mexico, Montenegro, Nigeria, Philippines, Poland, Palestine, Panama, Russia, Romania, Serbia, South Sudan, Somaliland, the United States of America, Yemen, Zambia, and Zimbabwe are the nations whose coats of arms feature an eagle. The eagle's continuing significance and worldwide appeal as a forceful symbol in national identity and imagery is demonstrated by its widespread usage.[46]",

                "content": "The Penn State Nittany Lions team represents the Pennsylvania State University in college football. The Nittany Lions compete in the NCAA Division I Football Bowl Subdivision as a member of the Big Ten Conference, which they joined in 1993 after playing as an Independent from 1892 to 1992.[3][4][5] Established in 1887, the Nittany Lions have achieved numerous on-field successes, including two consensus national championships in 1982 and 1986; four Big Ten Conference Championships in 1994, 2005, 2008, and 2016; 13 undefeated seasons in 1887, 1894, 1909, 1911, 1912, 1920, 1921, 1947, 1968, 1969, 1973, 1986 and 1994; and 53 appearances in college bowl games, with an all-time post-season bowl record of 31–20–2. The team ranks seventh among NCAA Division I college football programs in all-time total wins.[6] The Nittany Lions play their home games at Beaver Stadium, located on-campus in University Park, Pennsylvania. The first recorded game in Penn State football history occurred on November 12, 1881, when Penn State traveled to Lewisburg, Pennsylvania to play Bucknell, known until 1886 as the University at Lewisburg. Penn State won 9–0, which was nine goals to none. At the time, this was really a game of \"American rugby\". The father of American football, Walter Camp, did not develop the \"scrimmage\", the \"first down\" and the \"gridiron\" (yard markings) until 1882. Although this game was reported in two State College newspapers and the Mirror (University at Lewisburg campus newspaper), Bucknell denies that this game ever happened. Penn State did not field teams from 1882 through 1886. Penn State played its first season in 1887,[7] but had no head coach for their first five years, from 1887 to 1891.[7] The teams played its home games on the Old Main lawn on campus in State College, Pennsylvania. They compiled a 12–8–1 record in these seasons, playing as an independent from 1887 to 1890. In 1891, the Pennsylvania Intercollegiate Football Association (PIFA) was formed. It consisted of Bucknell (University at Lewisburg), Dickinson, Franklin & Marshall, Haverford, Penn State and Swarthmore. Lafayette and Lehigh were excluded because it was felt they would dominate the Association. Penn State won the championship with a 4–1–0 record. Bucknell's record was 3–1–1 (losing to Franklin & Marshall and tying Dickinson). The Association was dissolved prior to the 1892 season.[7] George W. Hoskins was the first head football coach at Penn State.[8] He posted a 17–4–4 record in his from 1892 to 1895 as head coach, and his .760 winning percentage ranks highest in program history.[8] His first team played its home game on the Old Main lawn on campus in State College, Pennsylvania, before the 500-seat Beaver Field opened in 1893.[8] He was succeeded by Samuel B. Newton,[citation needed] who posted a 12–14 (.462) record in three seasons, 1896–1898.[9] Sam Boyle coached for only one year in 1899 and compiled a 4–6–1 record (.409).[10] Pop Golden coached the Nittany Lions for three seasons from 1900 to 1902, tallying a record of 16–12–1 (.569).[11] Daniel A. Reed took over for the 1903 season and went 5–3 (.625).[12] Tom Fennell coached the Nittany Lions for five seasons from 1904 to 1908, posting a 33–17–1 (.657) record.[13] In 1907 the school adopted the Nittany Lion mascot, a mountain lion named after nearby Mount Nittany.[14][page needed] An early mascot was \"Old Coaly\", a mule that hauled stone for the original Old Main (completed in 1863 and demolished in 1929). Bill Hollenback took over the Nittany Lions as head coach for the 1909 season and went undefeated at 5–0–2,[15] but left for Missouri for 1910.[16] Bill's older brother Jack Hollenback took over for the 1910 season and went 5–2–1 (.688),[17] but Bill returned to Penn State from 1911 to 1914.[citation needed] Bill went 23–9–2 in his second tenure for a combined record of 28–9–4 (.732).[15] In 1911 and 1912, his teams went 8–0–1 and 8–0 and were awarded retroactive national championships by the National Championship Foundation which are recognized by the NCAA.[15] Head coach Dick Harlow brought a new form of defense, trying to go in-between or around offensive blockers rather than try to overpower them.[18][non-primary source needed] Harlow's Nittany Lions compiled a 20–8 (.714) record in his three seasons (1915–1917)[19] and was later inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame as a coach for his accomplishments.[18] Hugo Bezdek was Penn State's head football coach for 12 seasons[20] and was the Nittany Lions' first athletics director.[21] Bezdek posted a 65–30–11 record,[20] which included two undefeated seasons and a berth in the 1922 Rose Bowl, a game they lost.[20] Bezdek's Nittany Lions posted a losing record in only two of Bezdek's seasons, going 1–2–1 in 1918 and 3–5–1 in 1928.[20] Bezdek retired after the 1929 season and was inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame as a coach in 1954.[21] Bob Higgins returned to his alma mater and served as Penn State's head football coach for 19 seasons.[22] He compiled a 91–57–11 overall record, which included 11 winning seasons and only five losing seasons.[22] Higgins' 1947 team tied SMU in the Cotton Bowl.[23] Higgins was forced to retire due to poor health following the 1948 season.[23] He was inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame as a coach in 1954.[23] For one season, Joe Bedenk, also a Penn State alum, served as the Nittany Lions' head football coach.[24] He was promoted from offensive line coach after the retirement of his predecessor.[25] Bedenk posted a 5–4 record in his 1949,[24] his lone season as head coach, before requesting to return to his previous post as offensive line coach.[25] Rip Engle came to Penn State from Brown.[26][27] Engle posted a 104–48–4 record during his 16-season tenure as head coach and developed a game known as Angleball as a way for his players to maintain fitness in the off-season.[26][27] Engle never had a losing season at Penn State, and his 5–5 final season was his only non-winning season.[28] His 1959 and 1960 Nittany Lions teams won the Liberty Bowl, while his 1961 and 1962 teams reached the Gator Bowl, winning the first and losing the second.[28] Engle retired following the 1965 season and was inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame as a coach in 1973.[26] Penn State assistant Joe Paterno was promoted to head coach following the retirement of Engle.[25] Paterno spent 46 seasons as the head football coach, the longest tenure of any head coach in the FBS, and 16 more seasons as an assistant, making his 62 total years coaching at Penn State the most of any coach at any school.[25] Under Paterno, Penn State played as an Independent from 1966 to 1992,[25] and he continued to coach them when they joined the Big Ten Conference in 1993–2011.[25] He also served as Penn State's athletic director from 1980 to 1982. His final record is 409–136–3.[29] His teams won national championships in 1982 and 1986,[29] posted non-losing records in all seasons but five,[29] and appeared in 37 bowl games with 24 wins.[29] His teams also won the Orange Bowl in 1968, 1969, 1973 and 2005;[29] the Fiesta Bowl in 1977, 1980, 1981, 1986, 1991 and 1996;[29] the Sugar Bowl in 1982; and the Rose Bowl in 1994.[29] In June 1990,[30] Penn State's athletics program, after a century as a Division I-A independent, joined the Big Ten Conference. Beaver Stadium was expanded six times during Paterno's tenure. He was elected to the College Football Hall of Fame in 2006 and was a major reason why the longtime rule of waiting until retirement to be inducted into the Hall of Fame was changed to any coach over 75 years of age.[25] Players including Kerry Collins, Charlie Zapiec, Matt Millen, Shane Conlan, Jack Ham, Dennis Onkotz, Franco Harris, Greg Buttle, Keith Dorney, John Cappelletti, Curt Warner, Larry Johnson, LaVar Arrington and Ted Kwalick played collegiately for him.[31] He won numerous coaching and sportsman honors during his long run at Penn State.[29] Paterno has the most wins in FBS football (409). Following the Pennsylvania Attorney General's release of a grand jury summary of child sexual abuse charges involving former assistant Jerry Sandusky,[32] the Penn State board of trustees fired Paterno in November 2011.[32][33] Defensive coordinator Tom Bradley finished out the 2011 season as interim head coach after Paterno's ouster.[34] In July 2012, the NCAA decided to vacate all of the team's wins from 1998 to 2011. Paterno's statue outside Beaver Stadium was also taken down.[35] The revised record dropped Paterno from first to twelfth on the all-time wins list,[36] but on January 16, 2015, the NCAA restored Paterno's vacated wins, and thus his record as the winningest FBS football coach.[37] To many he is \"The best Penn State head coach ever.\"[38] New England Patriots offensive coordinator Bill O'Brien was hired as the 15th head football coach at Penn State, taking over the Nittany Lions football program in January 2012.[39] Early in O'Brien's tenure, the NCAA sanctioned Penn State with a four-season postseason ban and a loss of 40 scholarships due to the child sex abuse scandal.[40] O'Brien posted an 8–4 record in his first season as head coach of the Nittany Lions.[41] O'Brien's 2013 Nittany Lions team posted a 7–5 record in the second of four years they were ineligible for the postseason.[42] In January 2014, Bill O'Brien left Penn State to accept the head coaching position with the NFL's Houston Texans.[43] On January 11, 2014, Vanderbilt head coach James Franklin was hired as the 16th Penn State head football coach.[44] He is the first African American head football coach at Penn State.[45] In Franklin's first year, the NCAA lifted Penn State's postseason ban and the Nittany Lions were bowl eligible. The Nittany Lions were named to the Pinstripe Bowl where they won against Boston College on December 27, 2014, at Yankee Stadium.[46] To start off the 2015 season, Penn State lost to Temple 27–10, its first loss to the Owls since 1941. The loss was followed by victories against Buffalo, Rutgers, San Diego State, Army and Indiana. The Nittany Lions then lost to Ohio State 38–10 in Columbus before winning, 31–30, at Maryland. The victory against Maryland brought the Nittany Lions to six wins, making them bowl eligible for the second year since the postseason ban was lifted. Penn State then shut out the Illinois 39–0 in the second to last home game of the 2015 season. They then lost to Michigan in Happy Valley 28–16 and to Michigan State 55–16 at MSU. The win–loss record for Penn State in the 2015 regular season was 7–5, and 7–6 after a loss to Georgia in the Taxslayer Bowl in Jacksonville. The 2016 season featured an upset over No. 2 Ohio State during a \"White-Out\" in State College. Following the win, Penn State was ranked 24th in the AP Poll, its first ranking since 2011.[47] Penn State finished the regular season 10–2, 8–1 in Big Ten play. After winning a tiebreaker against rivals Ohio State, Penn State went on to claim the Big Ten East title and a spot in the Big Ten Championship game in Indianapolis against Big Ten West champion Wisconsin, which they won after trailing 28–14 in the first half. They outscored the Badgers 24–3 in the second half to take home the Nittany Lions' fourth Big Ten Title.[48] On August 18, 2017, Penn State announced that Franklin signed a six-year contract extension worth $5.738 million a year.[49] That deal includes retention bonuses paid at the end of each year of the contract. \"My family and I are very thankful to be a part of the Penn State community,\" Franklin said in a statement. \"I am pleased with the progress our program has made in the community, in the classroom and on the field. I look forward to diligently working with President Barron and Director of Athletics Sandy Barbour on implementing a plan that puts our University and our student-athletes in the best position to compete on the field and in life.\"[50] In addition to the guaranteed money, Franklin's contract extension has incentives including $800,000 for a national title, $400,000 for a College Football Playoff appearance and $350,000 for winning the Big Ten Championship Game. His incentives are capped at $1 million per year.[51] Penn State went to 7–0 to begin the 2017 season, before losing on consecutive weekends to Ohio State and Michigan State. Penn State finished the regular season with wins over Rutgers Nebraska and Maryland. Penn State capped the 2017 season at the Fiesta Bowl, beating Washington, 35–28.[52] In 2018 the Lions went 9–4 with a loss to Kentucky in the Citrus Bowl. The 2019 season was spectacular for Penn State going 11–2 with the losses only to Minnesota by 26–31 and to Ohio State and beat American Athletic Conference Champion Memphis who at that time was 12–1. Penn State beat Memphis 53–39 in the Cotton Bowl. The 2020 season was James Franklin's first losing season with the Nittany Lions. They started off the season with COVID-19 pandemic spring cancelations. Penn State traveled to Bloomington to take on Indiana where they lost in overtime 35–36 with Michael Penix Jr.'s pendulum touch two-point conversion winning the Game for Indiana. The Nittany Lions took on Ohio State at home with no whiteout due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Penn State lost 25–38. The Nittany Lions took on Maryland who they had not lost to since 2014. The Terrapins beat Penn State 19–35 in Beaver Stadium. The Nittany Lions traveled to Nebraska to take on the Nebraska Cornhuskers where the Nittany Lions comeback fell short and lost 23–30. The Nittany Lions fought the Iowa Hawkeyes but lost 21–41 giving Penn State its first ever 0–5 start in its history. The Nittany Lions, determined to win, traveled to Ann Arbor to defeat the Michigan Wolverines. Penn State got its first victory of the season 27–17 going 1–5. Penn State took on the Rutgers Scarlet Knights in Piscataway where they won again 23–7 thus giving them a 2–5 record. Penn State went home to take on the Michigan State. They trailed 10–21 at halftime but rallied back to win 39–24 getting a 3–5 record. For the Big Ten Championship week Penn State hosted the Fighting Illini at home. Penn State won in rout 56–21 going to a 4–5 record. Penn State players voted to not accept a bowl invitation so their final record was 4–5. A major offseason change was replacing first-year offensive coordinator Kirk Ciarrocca with Texas offensive coordinator Mike Yurcich. James Franklin is currently under a ten-year $75,000,000 contract (as of 2021). In 2021, Penn State improved upon its lackluster 2020 season going 7–6. The Nittany Lions finished the season unranked and with a 4–5 Big Ten Conference record. They went 2–3 on the road while maintaining a winning 5–2 record at Beaver Stadium. The season started strong on September 4, 2021, when Penn State defeated the #12 ranked Wisconsin Badgers football team. They won their next 4 games including a 28–20 win over the #22 Auburn Tigers football team. Then they began to struggle after a close 23–20 loss to the #3 Iowa Hawkeyes on the road October 9, 2021. On October 23, 2021, Penn State battled the Illinois Fighting Illini through an NCAA record 9 overtimes, eventually losing 20–18. The teams both scored fieldgoals in the first 2 overtimes, tying the score 16–16. Neither team scored until the 8th overtime when Illinois finally broke the stalemate, quickly followed by a run from Penn State's Noah Cain. Penn State did not score during its first conversion attempt in overtime 9, leaving the door open for Illinois to eventually score and win the game.[53] The Nittany Lions' only subsequent wins came against Maryland (31–14) and Rutgers (28–0). They closed out the 2021 season playing Arkansas at the Outback Bowl, losing the game 24–10.[54] Penn State has a strong 2022 campaign losing to only Michigan and Ohio State and defeating Pac 12 champion Utah in the 2023 Rose Bowl. Penn State has also been named national champions on seven occasions by NCAA-designated major selectors.[55][56]: 111–115 Penn State claims the 1982 and 1986 championships under Joe Paterno's tenure,[57] both of which are consensus national championships.[56]: 120 Historically, Penn State played as an independent from 1887 through 1890, then in 1891 as a member of the Pennsylvania Intercollegiate Football Association Penn State won the PIFA championship with a 4–1–0 PIFA record, losing only to Bucknell (Bucknell's record was 3–1–1). The PIFA dissolved prior to the 1892 season. Penn State then played as an independent again until joining the Big Ten Conference in 1990 and beginning play in 1993. Penn State then won its first Big Ten championship in 1994, they won two more in 2005 and 2008, and they won a fourth under James Franklin in 2016. † Co-champions † Co-champions Before the 2006 season, Beaver Stadium was updated and seasons of note were honored by being listed in front of the suite façade.[58] The following seasons are highlighted; Penn State has earned invitations to 53 bowl games. The Nittany Lions have compiled a bowl record of 31–20–2 (.604), including a 17–7–1 (.700) record in the major bowls (Rose, Orange, Sugar, Fiesta, and Cotton).[59] Coach Joe Paterno was responsible for most of these bids and victories, compiling more appearances (37) than any other coach in college football en route to his bowl record of 24–12–1 (.662). Paterno also has a record of 14–5 (.737) in \"major\" bowls and is the only coach to have won all five major college bowls during his career. James Franklin is the head coach of Penn State since the 2014 season.[60] Penn State and Maryland met in briefly interrupted stretches between 1917 and 1993, with a near-consecutive run played all but three years (1976, 1981, and 1983) between 1960 and 1993. However, the one-sided record belies what was often a competitive matchup until its final years. While Maryland only compiled one win and one tie, numerous games were narrowly lost by missed field goals and turnovers. In 1975, a field goal attempt by kicker Mike Sochko hit the upright with under a minute left, and Maryland lost 15–13. Ten years later, the Terps missed three field goals to eventually lose 20–18. After the Nittany Lions' move to the Big Ten Conference in 1993, the series was canceled. However, Maryland ended up joining the Big Ten as well, in 2014, reinstating the rivalry after more than 2 decades of being dormant. Maryland would win the first matchup by a point (20–19) after infamously declining to shake hands with Penn State captains at midfield during the coin toss at Beaver Stadium. The second meeting as conference foes would be played in Baltimore at M&T Bank Stadium and would again be decided by a point, this time a Penn State win 31–30. The last four matchups (2016–2019), all victories for Penn State have seen the Nittany Lions outscore the Terrapins by a combined score of 201–20 (38–14, 66–3, 38–3, 59–0). The latest match up was played on November 30, 2024, at Beaver Stadium, with Penn State winning 44–7. Penn State leads the series 44–3–1 through the 2024 season.[61] Prior to 1993, Penn State had never played against Michigan, but since then many of the games have been competitive duals with shots at a Big Ten title at stake, and subsequently a national championship. Michigan leads the series, 17–10.[62] Since 1993, Penn State has played Michigan State for the Land Grant Trophy. Penn State holds possession of the trophy after winning the 2023 contest. Penn State leads the series, 19–18–1 as of 2024.[63] When Penn State joined the Big Ten in 1993, Minnesota was the first conference opponent they played. To commerate this, the governors of both states commissioned a trophy called the Governor's Victory Bell to landmark this event. Since then, the trophy has traveled hands between the winners of each contest. Penn State leads the series, 11–6.[64] The rivalry began before Penn State was a member of the Big Ten. Penn State won the first four meetings of the series, which were held between 1912 and 1964. Then Ohio State won in 1975 in a game held in Columbus, Ohio and again in 1976 during the first ever matchup between the two teams in State College, Pennsylvania. Penn State and Ohio State would meet again in 1980 in their first and only postseason bowl, the 1980 Fiesta Bowl, which Penn State won. After the Fiesta Bowl, the two teams would not meet again until Penn State joined the Big Ten in 1993. Since then, the Nittany Lions and Buckeyes have played each other annually. Ohio State leads the series 25–14 through the 2024 season.[65] This is a long-standing series between in-state rivals Penn State and Pittsburgh. The rivalry, once one of the fiercest and most important in college football north of the Mason–Dixon line, began on November 6, 1893, at the inaugural game of Beaver Field in State College, and Penn State won the contest 32–0.[66] The first two decades of the series was dominated by Penn State taking 12 of 15 matchups between 1893 and 1912. From 1913 to 1949 Pitt would hold a 26–6–2 advantage, before Rip Engle took over as head coach for Penn State in 1950. With Joe Paterno as an assistant coach, Engle led Penn State to a 9–6–1 record against the Panthers from 1950 to 1965. When Paterno was named head coach in 1965, the next 31 games would swing heavily in the Nittany Lion's favor, holding a 23–7–1 advantage from 1966 to 2000.[67] The rivalry went on a 15-year hiatus prior to the scheduling of a 4-game series in 2011[68] that would see Penn State travel to Pittsburgh in 2016 & 2018 with Pitt returning to Happy Valley in 2017 & 2019. The series was branded the Keystone Classic in 2016,[69] which saw Pitt hold on for a thrilling 42–39[70] victory fending off a fierce fourth quarter comeback that fell short on an interception late in the 4th quarter.[71] The Nittany Lions would take the final three games, winning 33–13 in 2017, 51–6 in 2018, and most recently 17–10[72] in Beaver Stadium in 2019.[73] There are no future games scheduled between the two schools, although there is talk of a potential neutral site matchup sometime in the future.[74] The Nittany Lions and Panthers have met on the football field 100 times. Penn State holds a 10-win advantage in the series, 53–43–4, through the 2024 season.[75] The rivalry started in 1922, when Syracuse fought Penn State to a scoreless tie. But it was during the 1950s and 1960s that the rivalry intensified, as it enjoyed a competitive and often controversial string of contests. Syracuse football was led by Ben Schwartzwalder, and Penn State by Rip Engle, then Joe Paterno. From 1950 to 1970, Syracuse won 11 games to Penn State's 10. After Schwartzwalder retired in 1973, Syracuse floundered. Penn State won 16 straight from 1971 to 1986. Conference realignment and scheduling disagreements also dampened the intensity of the rivalry. Penn State fans and players increasingly turned their attention to the rivalry with Pittsburgh. In 1987, Coach Dick MacPherson finally led Syracuse to a resounding 48–21 victory over the Nittany Lions in the Carrier Dome. Syracuse won again the following year in Happy Valley but lost the last two games before the series was suspended in 1991. The rivalry has since been renewed three times since the series suspension — in 2008, 2009, and 2013. The Nittany Lions won all three of these contests. Penn State leads the series 43–23–5 with the most recent game played in 2013. Next meeting between the two teams is scheduled for September 4, 2027.[76] Penn State and West Virginia have played each other 59 times. The first game was in 1904 when Penn State won that game 34–0. In their most recent encounter on August 31, 2024, Penn State won 34–12 in Morgantown. This series has been dominated by the Nittany Lions who lead the series 50–9–2.[77] Though the Crimson Tide are not as much of a traditional opponent for the Nittany Lions, the two teams are still often considered among the best in the country, claim a combined 20 national titles, and have met in a bowl game three times. The series began on December 19, 1959, in that year's edition of the Liberty Bowl, a 7–0 win for No. 12 Penn State. Sixteen years later, the Nittany Lions and Crimson Tide met in the 1975 Sugar Bowl, resulting in a 13–6 Tide victory in New Orleans. Perhaps the most notable game between these two teams came four years later, in a 1979 Sugar Bowl rematch, resulting in another Alabama victory. The rivalry was intensified during the 1980s, when the Lions and Tide met in 10 consecutive seasons, all during regular season play. After this time, the rivalry went dormant for two decades before being renewed for a 2-game home-and-home series in 2010 and 2011. Alabama leads the series 10–5 with the last game played in 2011.[78] This White Out tradition dates back to a student section white out in 2004 (against Purdue) and has become one of the most eagerly anticipated games during the football season. In recent years, Penn State students have donned white clothes, paint - anything white - to show their solidarity and support for the Nittany Lions. Forming a mass of bouncing and infectious enthusiasm, the students have \"Whited Out\" Beaver Stadium, the Bryce Jordan Center and other sports venues, making them some of the noisiest and most intimidating stadiums in America.[79] Beano Cook of ESPN says, \"If you aren't impressed with the White Out, you're probably one of those people who think the moon landing was faked.\"[80] Originally named \"Paternoville\", Nittanyville is a student camp out that occurs every week of a Penn State home football game. The students camp out to support the team and to acquire the best possible seats for the weekend's upcoming game, since seating is first-come, first serve for students. While the name \"Paternoville\" came about during Penn State's 2005 football season, students have long camped out for first row seats. Prior to 1993, the university distributed non-seat-specific tickets. Starting the same year Penn State football began competition in the Big Ten Conference, students were assigned seats on a first-come-first-serve basis, so that the first students to pass through \"Gate A\" at the south-east corner of the stadium would be assigned first row seats, and so on down the line.[81] Since then, students have camped out in small to massive numbers in order to guarantee themselves a front row seat to a Penn State home football game. The 2005 season saw the naming of the tent-city. In anticipation of the 2005 contest between No. 16 Penn State and No. 6 Ohio State, students began camping six days in advance of the game outside the gate so that they would get a first row seat for, arguably, the biggest game of the 2005 season for Penn State. On Tuesday of the week preceding the game, \"Paternoville\" first appeared. Credited with the naming, freshman Dan Clark and the other students camping with him created a banner reading \"Paternoville\".[82] The name stuck, and on Wednesday morning, October 5, 2005, newspapers were already referring to the campsite as \"Paternoville\". State-wide, regional, and even national media outlets began paying attention to the show in front of Gate A. Local businesses printed t-shirts up for the students, brought truckloads of food, and distributed various things like magazines and small footballs to keep the students occupied. Throughout the week, players, coaches, and many alumni and media personalities paid visits to Paternoville.[83] On Friday, ESPN's \"Cold Pizza\" morning show was broadcast from in front of the Bryce Jordan Center, across from the stadium, with some of the cast walking through Paternoville interviewing students and taping their activities, despite the constant drizzle. The next day, ESPN's College Gameday also was broadcast in front of the Bryce Jordan Center, hours before the showdown between the cross-border rivals.[84] Before noon, the tents were packed away and hundreds of students began to line up for entry into the stadium. That night, in a historic game, the Nittany Lions upset the No. 6 ranked Buckeyes 17–10 in front of a crowd of almost 110,000. The game being decided on a fumble by Ohio State quarterback and future Heisman Trophy winner Troy Smith, caused by Penn State defensive end Tamba Hali and recovered by defensive tackle Scott Paxson. After the final whistle, the students rushed the field.[85] The Paternoville name continued after the game. Since the original \"Paternoville\", two other games have garnered comparable camp-outs. They were the 2005 game against the University of Wisconsin Badgers, which was Senior Day for the 2005 season,[86] and the 2006 contest against University of Michigan Wolverines. However, students camp out for every game, not solely the \"big\" games. On average, about 10–15 tents appear for every game, while the number of tents for the 2005 Ohio State and Wisconsin games and the 2006 Michigan game exceeded 100.[87] Prior to the 2006 season, the university placed several markers around Beaver Stadium commemorating various traditions related to Penn State football. To the left of Gate A there is a marker for the Penn State \"student section\" and to the right of the gate there is a marker for \"Paternoville\".[88] Since 2006, the practice of camping out has grown every year until 2009, when over 2,000 different students camped out for one or multiple games throughout the season. In 2011, the record was broken because of Penn State's high-powered home schedule, which included SEC powerhouse Alabama and new in-conference foe Nebraska, amongst other teams.[89] In the summer of 2012, \"Paternoville\" officially became \"Nittanyville\". As Coach Paterno was no longer the coach of Penn State's football team, the organization decided that since it was unlikely another coach would stay as long as Coach Paterno had, changing the name for each new coach would be impractical. However, aside from the name, nothing was changed and students continued to support the team and camp out for the primary seats.[90] Joe Paterno was widely known for his \"grand experiment\" in which he challenged his players to be successful both on the field and in the classroom.[91] In 2011, the Nittany Lion football team posted an 87% graduation rate, tied with Stanford for No. 10 overall among the nation's 120 Football Bowl Subdivision (FBS) institutions, above the national average of 67%.[92] The June 2012 conviction of former assistant coach Jerry Sandusky on multiple counts of child sexual abuse marred the \"Success with Honor\" image.[93] President Rodney Erickson, athletics director Dave Joyner, and head football coach Bill O'Brien, all of whom accepted their jobs in the wake of the scandal, have made statements in which they express commitment to maintaining integrity at the university and within the athletics programs.[94] In 2012, a group of alumni and supporters established a non-profit organization [501(c)(3) and registered trademark] that will build upon the \"Success with Honor\" motto. Their mission is to promote and support charitable endeavors as well as to inspire others to \"Get in the Game.\" Success with Honor is a Social Network Community that has identified more than 60+ charities. Success with Honor helps individuals to identify and connect with causes they would like to volunteer their skills, time, and/or money to. Similarly, SWH assists charities in finding individuals to meet their current needs.[95] The team is widely noted for their simple game uniforms. They only wear white pants, and the jerseys are simple blue for home games, and white for away games.[96] The team is only allowed to wear simple black Nike shoes with white calf socks for game days, though blue tights are permitted underneath the white socks for cold weather games. The helmet is white with a blue stripe down the center, and a blue on white \"Penn State\" sticker covers up the forehead helmet logo. No team logos, conference logos, numbers, or other stickers are permitted on the helmet, though two Nike logos are on facemask visors that some players choose to wear. Penn State has started to wear bowl decals only starting with 1997 Fiesta Bowl. Before that, Penn State always declined the decals so they can play out of their simple game uniforms. The blue and white uniforms replaced the school's original colors, pink and black, in 1890 after a student referendum. A common legend of the color change is that the original colors faded in the sun. Black became a hue of navy blue and the pink became such a light hue that it appeared white. The historicity of this, however, is very questionable, as evidence of it being the root cause is scarce.[97] The uniforms became even simpler for the 2011 season, as the white cuffs and collars on the home jerseys and the corresponding blue cuffs and collars on the road jerseys were eliminated, leaving the jerseys solid blue and white, respectively. In 2012 Penn State started wearing names on their uniforms for the first time as a way to note the players who stuck with the school through the scandal and a blue ribbon in support the victims of child abuse.[98] In 2013, the Nittany Lion logo was added to the base of the jersey collar along with the Big Ten logo on the right side of the jersey. Starting in 2015, the names that were added throughout the 2012–14 seasons to honor those who stayed with the program were removed and the team reverted to the traditional nameless jerseys while still retaining the Nittany Lion logo at the base of the jersey collar. The team also began sporting new Nike Elite 51 jerseys which feature a new design on the collars.[99] In addition, the team added the words \"Nittany Lions\" onto the back of the football helmets. For the 2017 homecoming game against the Indiana Hoosiers, Penn State broke tradition by donning throwback jerseys in what was dubbed the \"Generations of Greatness\" game. These uniforms integrated elements from past uniforms, including: numbers on helmets' sides, block uniform numbers, white stripes on sleeves, blue stripes on pants, striped socks, gray facemasks, white cleats, and a few other subtle changes.[100] Captains are chosen by the team, with the head coach's approval. Being named a captain is an honor almost always given to a senior, but there are some notable exceptions: Linebacker Sean Lee was named a captain in the beginning of Spring practice in 2008, the beginning of his 4th year with the team. However, he suffered a torn ACL during spring practice, redshirted in 2008, and returned as a captain again in 2009. The most recent example of a \"true\" junior being named was Paul Posluszny, who was named a captain in both 2005 and 2006, his junior and senior years, respectively. The last time a junior was named captain before Posluszny was in 1968, when Steve Smear and Mike Reid were named captains during their junior years.[101] In 2014, Christian Hackenberg became the first true sophomore to be named team captain.[102] Penn State is referred to as Linebacker U for its reputation of producing outstanding linebackers.[103][better source needed] The scandal centered on then retired Penn State football assistant coach Jerry Sandusky's sexual assault of two underage boys on or near university property. After a grand jury investigation, Sandusky was indicted on 52 counts of child molestation dating from 1994.[110] The trial started on June 11, 2012, at the Centre County Courthouse in Bellefonte, Pennsylvania,[111][112] and ended on June 22, when the jury found Sandusky guilty on 45 counts.[113][114] On October 9, 2012, Sandusky was sentenced to 30–60 years in prison.[115] Several high-level school officials were charged with perjury,[116] suspended, or dismissed for allegedly covering up the incidents or failing to notify authorities. School president Graham Spanier was forced to resign, and head football coach Joe Paterno was fired without cause late in the season, while Sandusky maintained his innocence.[117] Former FBI director Louis Freeh, whose firm was hired by the Penn State Board of Trustees to conduct an investigation, concluded, after ostensibly conducting 400 interviews and reviewing 3.5 million documents, that Paterno, Spanier, Curley and Schultz had \"repeatedly concealed critical facts relating to Sandusky's abuse from the authorities, the Board of Trustees, Penn State community, and the public at large.\"[118][119][120] In an interview on 60 Minutes Sports, the former Chief Deputy Attorney General of Pennsylvania, Frank Fina, who investigated and prosecuted Sandusky, stated he found no evidence that Paterno participated in a cover-up.[121] In July 2012, NCAA announced it had fined the Penn State football program $60 million, levied a 4-year ban from bowl games and vacated all the program's 112 wins from 1998 to 2011. The program was originally scheduled to lose 10 scholarships from incoming classes in 2013–16, which would have been a loss of 40 scholarships.[122] In September 2013, the NCAA announced they were restoring 25 of the 40 scholarships to Penn State \"[d]ue to Penn State University's continued progress toward ensuring athletics integrity\". After losing 10 scholarships from the 2013–2014 incoming class and only having 75 total players on scholarship, Penn State gained five scholarships back for 2014–15, bringing in 20 new players with 80 total on scholarship. Full scholarships were regained for 2016–17. In total they lost only 15 scholarships.[123] The decision to return the scholarships was by the executive committee of the NCAA following a recommendation from former US Sen. George Mitchell. The NCAA had appointed Mitchell to monitor progress of Penn State's reforms to enhance their \"security, ethics, governance and compliance structure\". The decision was based upon the belief the restored scholarships would provide benefits to student-athletes.[124] Lawsuits were filed against NCAA related to the levy of penalties. In 2014 the NCAA, under the auspices of favorable reports from Mitchell, announced that Penn State would be eligible for the 2014 postseason and all scholarships restored in 2015.[125] The team's wins and records that had been vacated were restored, pending full approval, as part of a legal settlement in 2015.[126][127] Penn State is one of 11 schools with five or more inductees in the Pro Football Hall of Fame.[143] Including former head coach Joe Paterno, 25 Nittany Lion players and coaches have been selected for the College Football Hall of Fame.[144] [145][146]",

                "content": "If not listed, please contact your TV provider. TAMPA, Fla. (AP) The surging Tampa Bay Buccaneers are back over .500, a fourth straight NFC South title within reach. Now, they hope to finish the task by building on a three-game winning streak that's propelled them to the top of the division following a stretch in which they lost five of six games. “It's one thing getting to first place. It's a whole other thing staying there,” coach Todd Bowles said after Sunday's sloppy 28-13 win over the reeling Las Vegas Raiders. “We've got four games left. It's going to be a battle all the way through. We have to come ready every week.” Baker Mayfield threw for 295 yards and three touchdowns, and the Bucs won for the third straight week against a last-place opponent to move ahead of fading Atlanta in the NFC South. The Falcons, who hold a tiebreaker advantage after sweeping the season series between the rivals, have lost four in a row. “It doesn't have to be pretty. Obviously, there are a lot of things that I would personally like to have back, but it's a resilient group. We play for each other,” Mayfield said. “Guys step up when other people go down and that's what football is all about. It teaches you life lessons.” Mayfield tossed scoring passes of 15 yards and 29 yards to rookie Jalen McMillan. Rachaad White scored on a 5-yard reception and a 3-yard run for the Bucs, who pulled away in the second half after the Raiders (2-11) lost quarterback Aidan O'Connell to a knee injury that coach Antonio Pierce said “doesn't look good.” O’Connell was carted off the field after being shoved to the ground by Bucs defensive lineman Calijah Kancey after throwing a pass late in the third quarter. The quarterback, in his second game back after being sidelined nearly six weeks with a broken thumb, remained on the ground after an 8-yard, third-down completion to Jakobi Meyers. Kancey chased O’Connell out of the pocket toward the Bucs sideline and shoved him from behind after the ball was released. Kancey was not penalized for a late hit. “Prayers to him. I pray for a speedy recovery,” Kancey said. “I hope everything's good on their end. I definitely took a knee and prayed for him.” White rushed for 90 yards on 17 carries. His TD run in the fourth quarter put Tampa Bay up 21-10. McMillan's second TD finished an 80-yard drive and put the game out of reach after Desmond Ridder led the Raiders to a field goal that got Las Vegas within 21-13 with three minutes remaining. The Raiders have lost an NFL-high nine straight games. “I appreciate the effort, the grit, the fight,” Pierce said. “Listen, it's tough. And these guys, they're not flinching or blinking. They still believe. ... All of those guys are fighting until the very end. Proud of the effort.” Mayfield turned the ball over three times in the first half to help the Raiders stay close. O'Connell fumbled one play after Mayfield tossed his first interception. But four plays later, Raiders linebacker Amari Burney sacked Mayfield, forcing a fumble that led to O'Connell's 1-yard TD run that trimmed Tampa Bay's early lead to 14-7. The fumble recovery by Tre'von Moehrig was the first by the Las Vegas defense this season. Jack Jones' end zone interception denied Mayfield an opportunity to build on a 14-10 lead just before halftime. Raiders tight end Brock Bowers, who began the day leading the NFL in receptions with 84, had three catches for 49 yards and broke Sam LaPorta's year-old record for receptions in a season by a rookie tight end. LaPorta had 86 catches for the Detroit Lions in 2023. \"It’s cool, but it would be cooler with some more wins,” Bowers said. “He’s having a great individual year,” Pierce added. “I wish it could lead to more success for our team.” Raiders: O'Connell left the game with 1:23 remaining in the third quarter and was replaced by Ridder. O'Connell finished 11 of 19 passing 104 yards and an interception. He was sacked once. Buccaneers: Played without LB K.J. Britt (ankle), S Mike Edwards (hamstring), CB Josh Hayes (hamstring) and OLB Joe Tryon-Shoyinka (ankle). S Antoine Winfield Jr. (knee) and RB Bucky Irving (back) left in the second quarter and did not return. WR Ryan Miller (concussion) departed in the fourth quarter.

Postseason football may have lost some of its luster thanks to the allure of the 12-team bracket, but no one enjoys the bowl calendar during the holidays as much as I do. Yes, that even includes the matchups involving 6-6 teams. We know player opt outs are coming, and there's a plethora of coaching changes this month that will alter preparation and focus, but a chance to end the season on a high note heading into the 2025 season is high on the priority scale for the 82 teams still with a game -- or more -- to play. If you can't watch the entire bowl schedule, no worries. We've got you covered with a full ranking of the entire postseason, including a few projected matchups in the quarterfinals of the playoff. Now, let's feast! All times below Eastern. Saturday, Dec. 14 | 9 p.m. -- One of a couple teams to win in the regular-season finale to earn bowl eligibility, Western Michigan's senior running back Zahir Abdus-Salaam hopes to follow up his biggest performance of the year -- 175 yards of total offense, two touchdowns -- with another memorable outing to cap his career against South Alabama. The Jaguars were a mid-tier finisher in the Sun Belt and have been pushed by seven touchdowns in the last five games from freshman playmaker Fluff Bothwell. Thursday, Dec. 19 | 7 p.m. -- One of the Sun Belt's better teams this season under Clay Helton, only two of Georgia Southern's four losses came during conference play, while the others were against Boise State and Ole Miss. The Eagles are battle-tested and play the Bearkats, who won four of their last five entering the postseason. The two-headed rushing attack for Sam Houston features Jay Ducker and Hunter Watson, who combined for 14 touchdowns on the ground. Saturday, Jan. 4 | 11 a.m. -- First-year Buffalo coach Pete Lembo and the Bulls enter this one on a four-game winning streak but have never beaten the Flames. Liberty topped Buffalo 55-27 last season, but that was with Kaidon Salter at quarterback for Jamey Chadwell's squad. Salter, however, is expected to miss the Bahamas Bowl after entering the transfer portal last week. Saturday, Dec. 28 | 2:15 p.m. -- It was a bounce-back season for the Horned Frogs under Sonny Dykes, whose team flew under the radar a bit in the Big 12. Chandler Fields has started the last month at quarterback for Louisiana, who failed to score a touchdown in the Sun Belt Championship Game against Marshall. These two programs have never met on the gridiron; for the most part, that's a rarity during bowl season these days. Thursday, Dec. 26 | 2 p.m. -- Pitt running back Desmond Reid is a multi-position threat and has already recorded a 10-catch game out of the backfield this season. Meanwhile, the Panthers will try and fend off Toledo's primary weapon at WR1 -- Jerjuan Newton. He caught 64 passes for 949 yards and 11 touchdowns this season as one of the MAC's leaders in all three categories. Jason Candle utilized his top player as often as possible in the passing game. Monday, Dec. 23 | 2:30 p.m. -- The Huskies didn't handle success and their newfound national ranking all that well after beating Notre Dame in September, but credit NIU for finding a way to recover from a 4-4 start and finish on a high note with a win over Central Michigan in the finale. Fresno State is 1-3 over its last four and won't have Mikey Keene at quarterback after he entered the portal. Tuesday, Dec. 1 | 9 p.m. -- Memphis is the reason there wasn't more of an argument for two Group of Five teams in the playoff after last month's win over Tulane halted the AAC's shot at getting in alongside Mountain West champion Boise State. Running back Mario Anderson Jr. is one of the country's more underrated players after rushing for 1,292 yards and 17 scores this season. Offensive coordinator Chad Scott will lead the Mountaineers as their interim coach for the bowl game following Neal Brown's firing. Tuesday, Dec. 17 | 5:30 p.m. -- While former JMU coach Curt Cignetti took Indiana to the playoff this season, Bob Chesney was off to an 8-2 start with the Dukes before losses to Appalachian State and Marshall to end the year. JMU scored 70 points on North Carolina and caught fire offensively late. We're expecting a ton of points from the other team in this one, too, but the Hilltoppers tumbled down the stretch with three losses over their last four games. Saturday, Dec. 28 | 4:30 p.m. -- The RedHawks saw their seven-game winning streak end over the weekend against Ohio in the MAC title game but showed impressive defense throughout the 2024 season. Now, Miami (OH) is dealing with a Rams team fueled by Avery Morrow (956 yards rushing) and Justin Marshall (662 yards rushing). This will be a line of scrimmage matchup out West. Friday, Dec. 20 | Noon -- Bowl season's only matchup pitting conference champions against one another, Jacksonville State avenged a previous loss to WKU to take the Conference USA title while Ohio captured the MAC -- for the first time since 1968 -- after winning its sixth straight to end the season. Bobcats coach Tim Albin is reportedly filling Charlotte's coaching vacancy after capping his third consecutive 10-win season at Ohio. Thursday, Dec. 26 | 9 p.m. -- Fresh off a contract extension at Arkansas State, Butch Jones can breathe a sigh of relief entering the postseason. The reason for watching this game? Harold Fannin Jr. for Bowling Green. He was unstoppable as a tight end-hybrid player after accumulating 100 catches for 1,342 yards and nine scores. Friday, Jan. 3 | 4 p.m. -- The First Responder Bowl should not have any problems selling tickets to this one for a matchup that is perfectly suited for Dallas. Insiders say it's only a matter of time before G.J. Kinne takes one of these major coaching vacancies, but first, he'll try and win an eighth game against a program the Bobcats have only beaten seven times in history. Saturday, Dec. 28 | 11 a.m. -- The Tar Heels are in the middle of a coaching search after firing Mack Brown with, of all people, former NFL coach Bill Belichick among the reported finalists. UNC will have to deal with the two-headed backfield of Cam Edwards and Durell Robinson for the Huskies, who combined for over 1,400 yards this season. Friday, Dec. 20 | 3:30 p.m. -- Florida ended Billy Napier's Year 3 with victories over LSU, Ole Miss and Florida State. Any opportunity to watch D.J. Lagway throw it around again before the offseason is welcomed. The Green Wave lost to Army in the AAC Championship Game a week after falling to Memphis in a game that squandered dark horse playoff potential. Wednesday, Dec. 18 | 9 p.m. -- The Runnin' Rebels had a shot to reach the College Football Playoff but stubbed their toe for a second time against Boise State in Friday's Mountain West Championship Game. Cal hopes to move off a .500 finish with a seventh win, which would be its best of the season considering the Bears couldn't quite close the deal against an elite Miami squad previously. Thursday, Dec. 26 | 5:30 p.m. -- The bargain-rate version of Ashton Jeanty is Scarlet Knights star Kyle Monangai, who galloped his way to 1,279 yards this season and 13 touchdowns on the ground. Rutgers started the campaign 4-0 before losing four straight and then regaining its balance. Kansas State fell short of expectations under Chris Klieman after winning the Pop-Tarts Bowl last season with Avery Johnson under center. Monday, Dec. 23 | 11 a.m. -- Nothing screams bowl season like a pre-lunch kickoff on a Monday morning at the beach. The Chanticleers get a home game here against UTSA, a competitive matchup for both. UTSA quarterback Owen McCown threw for 3,170 yards and 24 touchdowns while spreading it around to four receivers with at least 28 catches on the season. Friday, Dec. 27 | Noon or 3:30 p.m. -- Brent Venables and the Sooners effectively helped keep Alabama out of the playoff with a resounding three-touchdown win over the Crimson Tide last month in easily the team's top performance of the season. The Midshipmen (8-3) bring their option-based scheme to the Armed Forces but have one more opponent to deal with before facing off with the SEC -- and that is, of course, Army. Saturday, Dec. 28 | 5:45 p.m. -- These two in-state rivals open the 2025 season, so it's a bit shocking to see this matchup come to fruition to end the 2024 campaign. A source told CBS Sports that N.C. State initially balked at the idea of playing the Pirates, but later agreed to the contest. Spicy! The Wolfpack lead the all-time series, 19-13, and have won three straight. Saturday, Dec. 28 | 9:15 p.m. -- Jeff Monken should be up for national ncoach of the year accolades based on this season's showing with the Black Knights, whose lone loss came against Notre Dame. Army coasted through the AAC and can conclude with its 12th win over Nay on Dec. 14. Marshall's messy divorce from Charles Huff, who took the Southern Miss job, has ended with both parties happy with their new situations. Friday, Jan. 3 | 7:30 p.m. -- Who doesn't love a good mayonnaise bath to begin the new year? P.J. Fleck hopes to improve to 6-0 in bowl games with the Golden Gophers in Charlotte against the Hokies. Virginia Tech was ranked inside the preseason top 25 in August before a season-opening loss at Vanderbilt tempered expectations a bit. Three losses in November means this team is stumbling into the bowl game with the only silver-lining opportunity coming in the form of a win. Saturday, Dec. 28 | Noon -- Played at Yankee Stadium, Huskers five-star freshman Dylan Raiola is hoping this isn't the last time he travels to New York as Nebraska's star quarterback. Heading to the postseason for the first time under Matt Rhule, Nebraska matches up well against Boston College. Eagles signal-caller Thomas Castellanos is entering the transfer portal, so Grayson James will likely start to cap Bill O'Brien's first season. Monday, Dec. 30 | 2:30 p.m. -- Star wide receiver Luther Burden III won't play for the Tigers after declaring for the NFL Draft, but there's still plenty of firepower for Missouri against a Hawkeyes team that continues to be defensively driven under Kirk Ferentz. If you're interested in watching a nice and tidy afternoon game the day before New Year's Eve, you're in luck with this one. Expect minimal possessions and a final score that goes under the total. Friday, Dec. 27 | 7 p.m. -- The Red Raiders have won back-to-back bowl games under Joey McGuire, and Texas Tech is one of those teams that often reaches into their bag of tricks during bowl season. The Razorbacks are no stranger to playing in Memphis after Liberty Bowl appearances to end the 2022 and 2010 seasons, most recently. Arkansas is bringing back Sam Pittman in 2025, so momentum is key in this spot for a sideline leader on the proverbial hot seat. Tuesday, Dec. 24 | 8 p.m. -- This one's a personal favorite for family reasons; thank goodness we have a bowl game on Christmas Eve again. While you're finishing up last-minute gift wrapping and handling what's left of the egg nog, these two explosive, offensive-minded teams should provide plenty of fireworks from Hawaii. San Jose State's Nick Nash is only the fourth FBS receiver all-time to lead the country in receptions (104), receiving yards (1,382) and receiving touchdowns (16). Tuesday, Dec. 31 | 2 p.m. -- Few coaches nationally took as many transfers as Jeff Brohm, but it paid off for a Cardinals team whose wins included Georgia Tech and Clemson this season. Tyler Shough finished with 3,195 yards passing and former Alabama pass-catcher Ja'Corey Brooks broke out with 1,013 yards receiving and nine scores. Jedd Fisch knew he was in for a rebuild of sorts at Washington after the Huskies reached the national championship game last fall, but they're heading in a positive direction after finishing .500 in the Big Ten. Tuesday, Dec. 31 | 3:30 p.m. -- Brian Kelly has already promised a national championship appearance for the Tigers in 2025, so why not get an early look at what LSU may have to offer? In actuality, the roster's going to look much different next fall after the arrival of a new freshman class and heavy portal acquisitions. Baylor won six straight games to win the regular season under Dave Aranda to pull off an 8-4 finish and effectively push him off of the hot seat. Friday, Dec. 27 | 10:30 p.m. -- Are these programs heading in opposite directions? Perhaps. Lincoln Riley could bookend a disappointing season with another win over an SEC opponent if he's able to best Mike Elko and Texas A&M in Vegas. The Aggies were the SEC's lone remaining conference unbeaten at one point in November before stumbling in the final weeks. Riley will try to avoid his first losing season as a head coach with another extended look at quarterback Jayden Maiava, who beat Nebraska and UCLA in November. USC's 3-0 all-time against the Aggies, but these teams haven't met since 1977. Saturday, Dec. 28 | 7:30 p.m. -- This one's a must-watch if Shedeur Sanders and Travis Hunter suit up for Colorado, which, according to Deion Sanders, will be happening. These two Big 12 teams did not meet in the regular season, and down the stretch, it seemed like BYU (10-2) failed to get the benefit of the doubt from the playoff selection committee despite a win over SMU and other quality victories. This should be a fun game in San Antonio between top-20 teams. Tuesday, Dec. 31 | 3 p.m. -- The Gamecocks are one of college football's hottest teams and feature sensational redshirt freshman quarterback LaNorris Sellers, who may have garnered Heisman Trophy attention this fall if the first half of the campaign was as statistically noteworthy as the second. The Gamecocks have a chance to post double-digit wins for the only the fifth time in program history and first since Steve Spurrier did it in 2013. Illinois is gunning for its first 10-win campaign since 2001 under then-coach Ron Turner and has a chance to do it against the \"first team out\" of the playoff. Friday, Dec. 27 | 8 p.m. -- Fran Brown and Syracuse pushed Clemson into the ACC Championship Game during rivalry weekend with an upset win over Miami. This could be a shootout of sorts with Cougars quarterback John Mateer matching up with former Ohio State signal caller Kyle McCord. Washington State seems to play with a chip on its shoulder under Jake Dickert, and both of these teams are motivated to finish strong -- not something you always see during bowl season. Friday, Dec. 27 | Noon or 3:30 p.m. -- Welcome back to bowl season, Vanderbilt. For the first time since 2018, the Commodores are rewarded with an extra game after a better-than-expected season that included a resounding win over then-No. 1 Alabama. We're told Diego Pavia and the Commodores are motivated to perform at their best, and Clark Lea's not expecting any opt outs for his team. Haynes King and Georgia Tech upended Miami recently and nearly took out eventual SEC champion Georgia on the road. Tuesday, Dec. 31 | Noon -- First-year coach Sherrone Moore is back in the good graces of the Michigan faithful after upsetting Ohio State, the most stunning win during the Wolverines' current four-game streak against the Buckeyes. With five-star QB Bryce Underwood coming in 2025, things are looking up for the Wolverines. Alabama is one of three three-loss SEC teams ranked just outside the committee's final poll. Under Nick Saban, the Crimson Tide often flourished in this non-playoff role and saw it as a sign of disrespect. The best player on the field in Orlando will be Alabama freshman wideout Ryan Williams, one of the fastest players in the country. Thursday, Jan. 2 | 7:30 p.m. -- Who had Manny Diaz and the Blue Devils winning nine games this season? Duke's playing for respect down in Jacksonville considering the Blue Devils still aren't ranked nationally. This was a playoff-worthy Rebels team this season after beating Georgia in November, but then the loss to Florida happened. Which Ole Miss team will show in the postseason? Opt outs could be a worry here given the wealth of draft talent. Saturday, Dec. 28 | 3:30 p.m. -- As long as the Hurricanes don't have a mass exodus of talent opt outs early for the NFL Draft, this should be a great matchup in Orlando pitting Cam Ward and a high-powered offense against Rocco Becht and the Cyclones. Iowa State picked a bad time to play its worst game with three costly turnovers in the second half of Saturday's loss to Arizona State, but the carrot at the end of the stick is a shot at 11 wins. Wednesday, Jan. 1 | 1 p.m. -- Cam Skattebo captured the hearts of millions against Iowa State in the Big 12 Championship Game, and the Sun Devils looks like a team on a mission to continue proving doubters wrong. They were picked to finish last in the league this season and wound up winning 11 games. Texas hosts Clemson and Dabo Swinney in the first round. Bring it on. Tuesday, Dec. 31 | 7:30 p.m. -- There's a chance we could see a Heisman Trophy winner in action against SMU or Penn State. Perhaps SMU takes out the Nittany Lions in Happy Valley to shock the playoff field in the first round with a mild upset. At any rate, we're looking forward to this one in the desert. Wednesday, Jan. 1 | 5 p.m. -- Anyone else feel the top-seeded Ducks got a raw deal by the selection committee with this draw? They're going to have to face an elite defense or an elite offense one way or another in the quarterfinals in Pasadena, California. Oregon played Ohio State once already this season and won by a point at home. Wednesday, Jan. 1 | 8:45 p.m. -- Join us in New Orleans for Georgia's tussle with the Hoosiers or Fighting Irish. We're expecting the Bulldogs to be favored in either matchup, but imagine the bragging rights if the Big Ten -- or Notre Dame -- is able to go in the SEC's backyard and win? Thursday, Jan. 9 at 7:30 p.m. & Friday, Jan. 10 at 7:30 p.m. -- Given all four teams must play their way into these games, it is even more difficult to project and rank the matchups; however, in the first year of the 12-team CFP, it stands to reason that these will be the best games of bowl season. The possibility of Boise State vs. Georgia at the Orange Bowl in Miami is salivating. Ashton Jeanty against an uber-talented front would be a David vs. Goliath type matchup for the Group of Five champions, but the Broncos will have to earn it. Georgia, too, for that matter -- especially considering Carson Beck could be out at quarterback. Oregon facing off with Texas? Maybe the Ducks battling Arizona State for a spot in the national championship game? The storylines are bountiful for the Cotton Bowl, too. AT&T Stadium will be rocking in January for this seismic game. © 2004-2024 CBS Interactive. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED. CBS Sports is a registered trademark of CBS Broadcasting Inc.

                "content": "Taylor Alison Swift (born December 13, 1989) is an American singer-songwriter. Known for her biographical songwriting, artistic reinventions, and cultural impact, Swift is a leading figure in popular music and the subject of widespread public interest. Swift signed to Big Machine Records in 2005 starting as a country singer with the albums Taylor Swift (2006) and Fearless (2008). Her singles \"Teardrops on My Guitar\", \"Love Story\", and \"You Belong with Me\" found crossover success on country and pop radio formats. She experimented with rock on Speak Now (2010) and electronic on Red (2012), later re-calibrating her image from country to pop with the synth-pop album 1989 (2014); the ensuing media scrutiny inspired the hip-hop-imbued Reputation (2017). The albums contained the Billboard Hot 100 number-one singles \"We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together\", \"Shake It Off\", \"Blank Space\", \"Bad Blood\" and \"Look What You Made Me Do\". Shifting to Republic Records in 2018, Swift released the electropop album Lover (2019) and the autobiographical documentary Miss Americana (2020), explored indie folk styles in the 2020 albums Folklore and Evermore, and subdued pop genres on Midnights (2022) and The Tortured Poets Department (2024). She began re-recording her Big Machine albums as Taylor's Version[a] since 2021, due to an ownership dispute with the label. Through the 2020s, she garnered the US number one songs \"Cardigan\", \"Willow\", \"All Too Well\", \"Anti-Hero\", \"Cruel Summer\", \"Is It Over Now?\", and \"Fortnight\". Her sixth concert tour, the Eras Tour (2023–2024), and its accompanying concert film are respectively the highest-grossing tour and concert film of all time. Her fans are known as Swifties. Swift is one of the world's best-selling music artists, with over 200 million units sold and a record seven albums that moved one million copies first-week. She is the highest-grossing female touring act, the first billionaire with music as primary income, and the world's richest female musician. She has been listed amongst history's greatest artists by publications such as Rolling Stone, Billboard and Forbes, as well as the only individual from the arts to have been named the Time Person of the Year (2023). Her accolades include 14 Grammy Awards, a Primetime Emmy Award, 40 American Music Awards, 40 Billboard Music Awards, and 30 MTV Video Music Awards, having won the Grammy Award for Album of the Year, MTV Video Music Award for Video of the Year and the IFPI Global Recording Artist of the Year at least four times each. She is an advocate of artists' rights and women's empowerment. Taylor Alison Swift was born on December 13, 1989, in West Reading, Pennsylvania.[1] She is named after the singer-songwriter James Taylor.[2][3] Her father, Scott Kingsley Swift, was a stockbroker for Merrill Lynch, and her mother, Andrea Gardner Swift (née Finlay), worked as a mutual fund marketing executive.[4] Swift's younger brother, Austin, is an actor.[5] Their maternal grandmother, Marjorie Finlay (née Moehlenkamp), was an opera singer,[6] whose singing in church became one of Swift's earliest memories of music that shaped her career.[4] Swift is of Scottish, English, and German descent, with distant Italian and Irish ancestry.[7][8][9] Swift spent her early years on a Christmas tree farm in Pennsylvania that her father had purchased from one of his clients,[10] and she spent her summers at her family's vacation home in Stone Harbor, New Jersey, where she occasionally performed acoustic songs at a local coffee shop.[11] She is a Christian[12] and attended preschool and kindergarten at a Montessori school run by the Bernardine Sisters of St. Francis before transferring to the Wyndcroft School.[13][14] When her family moved to Wyomissing, she attended Wyomissing Area Junior/Senior High School.[15][16] As a child, she performed in Berks Youth Theatre Academy productions[17] and traveled regularly to New York City for vocal and acting lessons.[18] Her early love for country music was influenced by Shania Twain, Patsy Cline, LeAnn Rimes, and the Dixie Chicks,[14] and she spent weekends performing at local festivals and events.[19][20] After watching a documentary about Faith Hill, she became determined to pursue a country-music career in Nashville, Tennessee.[21] At 11, Swift traveled to Nashville with her mother to visit record labels and submit demo tapes of Dolly Parton and Dixie Chicks karaoke covers.[22] She was rejected by all the labels, which led her to focus on songwriting.[23] She started learning the guitar at 12 with the help of Ronnie Cremer, a computer repairman and local musician who also assisted Swift with writing an original song.[24] In 2003, Swift and her parents started working with the talent manager Dan Dymtrow. With his help, Swift modeled for Abercrombie & Fitch and had an original song included on a Maybelline compilation CD.[25] After performing original songs at an RCA Records showcase, 13-year-old Swift was given an artist development deal and began to travel regularly to Nashville with her mother.[26][27] To help Swift break into the country music scene, her father transferred to Merrill Lynch's Nashville office when she was 14 years old, and the family relocated to Hendersonville, Tennessee.[28][29] Swift attended Hendersonville High School[30] before transferring to Aaron Academy after two years, which better accommodated her touring schedule through homeschooling. She graduated one year early.[3][31] In Nashville, Swift worked with experienced Music Row songwriters such as Troy Verges, Brett Beavers, Brett James, Mac McAnally, and the Warren Brothers[32][33] and formed a lasting working relationship with Liz Rose.[34] They began meeting for two-hour writing sessions every Tuesday afternoon after school.[35] Rose called the sessions \"some of the easiest I've ever done. Basically, I was just her editor. She'd write about what happened in school that day. She had such a clear vision of what she was trying to say. And she'd come in with the most incredible hooks.\" Swift became the youngest artist signed by Sony/ATV Tree Music Publishing,[36] but left then BMG-owned RCA Records (later bought by Sony Music) at the age of 14 due to the label's lack of care and them \"cut[ting] other people's stuff\". She was also concerned that development deals can shelve artists[27][20] and recalled: \"I genuinely felt that I was running out of time. I wanted to capture these years of my life on an album while they still represented what I was going through.\"[37] At an industry showcase at Nashville's Bluebird Cafe in 2005, Swift caught the attention of Scott Borchetta, a DreamWorks Records executive who was preparing to form an independent record label, Big Machine Records. She had first met Borchetta in 2004.[39] She was one of Big Machine's first signings,[27] and her father purchased a three-percent stake in the company for an estimated $120,000.[40][41][42] She began working on her eponymous debut album with Nathan Chapman.[20] Swift wrote or co-wrote all album tracks, and co-writers included Rose, Robert Ellis Orrall, Brian Maher, and Angelo Petraglia.[43] Released in October 2006, Taylor Swift peaked at number five on the US Billboard 200, on which it spent 157 weeks—the longest stay on the chart by any release in the US in the 2000s decade.[44][45] Swift became the first female country music artist to write or co-write every track on a platinum-certified debut album.[46] Big Machine Records was still in its infancy during the June 2006 release of the lead single, \"Tim McGraw\", which Swift and her mother helped promote by packaging and sending copies of the CD single to country radio stations.[47] She spent much of 2006 promoting Taylor Swift with a radio tour and television appearances; she opened for Rascal Flatts on select dates during their 2006 tour,[48] as a replacement for Eric Church.[49] Borchetta said that although record industry peers initially disapproved of his signing a 15-year-old singer-songwriter, Swift tapped into a previously unknown market—teenage girls who listen to country music.[47][28] Following \"Tim McGraw\", four more singles were released throughout 2007 and 2008: \"Teardrops on My Guitar\", \"Our Song\", \"Picture to Burn\", and \"Should've Said No\". All appeared on Billboard's Hot Country Songs, with \"Our Song\" and \"Should've Said No\" reaching number one. \"Our Song\" made Swift the youngest person to single-handedly write and sing a Hot Country Songs number-one single,[50] and \"Teardrops on My Guitar\" was Swift's breakthrough single on mainstream radio and charts.[51][52][53] Swift released two EPs, The Taylor Swift Holiday Collection in October 2007 and Beautiful Eyes in July 2008.[54][55] She promoted her debut album extensively as the opening act for other country musicians' tours in 2006 and 2007, including those by George Strait,[56] Brad Paisley,[57] and Tim McGraw and Faith Hill.[58] Swift won multiple accolades for Taylor Swift. She was one of the recipients of the Nashville Songwriters Association's Songwriter/Artist of the Year in 2007, becoming the youngest person given the title.[59] She also won the Country Music Association's Horizon Award for Best New Artist,[60] the Academy of Country Music Awards' Top New Female Vocalist,[61] and the American Music Awards' Favorite Country Female Artist honor.[62] She was also nominated for Best New Artist at the 50th Annual Grammy Awards.[63] In 2008, she opened for Rascal Flatts again[64] and briefly dated the singer Joe Jonas.[65] Swift's second studio album, Fearless, was released in November 2008 in North America,[66] and in March 2009 in other markets.[67] On the Billboard 200, Fearless spent 11 weeks at number one, becoming Swift's first chart topper and the longest-running number-one female country album.[68] It was the bestselling album of 2009 in the US.[69] Its lead single, \"Love Story\", was her first number one in Australia and the first country song to top Billboard's Pop Songs chart,[70][71] and its third single, \"You Belong with Me\", was the first country song to top Billboard's all-genre Radio Songs chart.[72] Three other singles were released in 2008–2010: \"White Horse\", \"Fifteen\", and \"Fearless\". All five singles were Hot Country Songs top 10 entries, with \"Love Story\" and \"You Belong with Me\" topping the chart.[73] In 2009, Swift toured as an opening act for Keith Urban and embarked on her first headlining tour, the Fearless Tour.[74] \"You Belong with Me\" won Best Female Video at the 2009 MTV Video Music Awards.[75] Her acceptance speech was interrupted by the rapper Kanye West, an incident that became the subject of controversy and widespread media coverage.[76] That year, Swift won five American Music Awards, including Artist of the Year and Favorite Country Album.[77] Billboard named her the 2009 Artist of the Year.[78] She won Video of the Year and Female Video of the Year for \"Love Story\" at the 2009 CMT Music Awards, where she made a parody video of the song with rapper T-Pain called \"Thug Story\".[79] At the 52nd Annual Grammy Awards, Fearless was named Album of the Year and Best Country Album, and \"White Horse\" won Best Country Song and Best Female Country Vocal Performance.[80] At the 2009 Country Music Association Awards, Swift won Album of the Year for Fearless and was named Entertainer of the Year, the youngest person to win the honor.[81] Throughout 2009, Swift featured on and wrote other musicians' releases.

On the soundtrack album to The Hunger Games (2012), Swift wrote and recorded \"Eyes Open\" and \"Safe & Sound\"; the latter of which was co-written with the Civil Wars and T-Bone Burnett. \"Safe & Sound\" won the Grammy Award for Best Song Written for Visual Media.[123] She wrote and produced \"Sweeter than Fiction\" with Jack Antonoff for the soundtrack to One Chance (2013).[124] Swift featured on B.o.B's \"Both of Us\" (2012)[125] and provided vocals for Tim McGraw's \"Highway Don't Care\" (2013), also featuring Keith Urban.[126] She was a voice actress in The Lorax (2012),[127] made a cameo in the sitcom New Girl (2013),[128] and had a supporting role in the dystopian film The Giver (2014).[129] From 2010 to 2013, Swift was romantically involved with the actor Jake Gyllenhaal, the political heir Conor Kennedy, and the singer Harry Styles.[83] In March 2014, Swift began living in New York City, which she credited as a creative influence on her fifth studio album, 1989.[note 1] She described 1989 as her first \"official pop album\" and produced it with Jack Antonoff, Max Martin, Shellback, Imogen Heap, Ryan Tedder, and Ali Payami.[132] Released in October 2014, the album opened atop the Billboard 200 with 1.28 million copies sold.[133] Its singles \"Shake It Off\", \"Blank Space\", and \"Bad Blood\" reached number one in Australia, Canada, and the US, with the first two making Swift the first woman to replace herself at the Hot 100 top spot.[134] Other singles include \"Style\", \"Wildest Dreams\", \"Out of the Woods\", and \"New Romantics\".[135] The 1989 World Tour (2015) was the highest-grossing tour of the year with $250 million in total revenue.[136] After publishing an op-ed in The Wall Street Journal stressing the importance of albums as a creative medium for artists,[137] in November 2014, Swift removed her catalog from ad-supported, free music streaming platforms such as Spotify.[138] In a June 2015 open letter, Swift criticized Apple Music for not offering royalties to artists during its free three-month trial period and threatened to withdraw her music from the platform,[139] which prompted Apple Inc. to announce that it would pay artists during the free trial period.[140] Swift then agreed to keep 1989 and her catalog on Apple Music.[141] Big Machine Records returned Swift's catalog to Spotify among other free streaming platforms in June 2017.[142] Swift was named Billboard's Woman of the Year in 2014, becoming the first artist to win the award twice.[143] At the 2014 American Music Awards, Swift received the inaugural Dick Clark Award for Excellence.[144] On her 25th birthday in 2014, the Grammy Museum at L.A. Live opened an exhibit in her honor in Los Angeles that ran until October 4, 2015.[145][146] In 2015, Swift won the Brit Award for International Female Solo Artist.[147] \"Bad Blood\" won Video of the Year and Best Collaboration at the 2015 MTV Video Music Awards.[148] At the 58th Grammy Awards (2016), 1989 won Album of the Year and Best Pop Vocal Album, making Swift the first woman to win Album of the Year twice.[149] Swift dated the DJ Calvin Harris from March 2015 to June 2016.[150] They co-wrote the song \"This Is What You Came For\", featuring vocals from Rihanna; Swift was initially credited under the pseudonym Nils Sjöberg.[151] She recorded \"I Don't Wanna Live Forever\" with Zayn Malik for the soundtrack to Fifty Shades Darker (2017)[152] and won a Country Music Association Award for Song of the Year with \"Better Man\", which she wrote for the band Little Big Town.[153] In April 2016, Kanye West released the single \"Famous\", in which he references Swift in the line, \"I made that bitch famous.\" Swift criticized West and said she never consented to the lyric, but West claimed that he had received her approval and his then-wife Kim Kardashian released video clips of Swift and West discussing the song amicably over the phone. The controversy made Swift a subject of an online \"cancel\" movement.[154] In late 2016, after briefly dating Tom Hiddleston, Swift began a six-year relationship with Joe Alwyn and retreated herself from the public spotlight.[155][156] In August 2017, Swift successfully countersued David Mueller, a former radio jockey for KYGO-FM, who sued her for damages from loss of employment. Four years earlier, she informed Mueller's bosses that he had sexually assaulted her by groping her at an event.[157] The public controversies influenced Swift's sixth studio album, Reputation, which explored the impact of her fame and musically incorporated electropop with urban styles of hip hop and R&B.[158] Released in November 2017,[159] Reputation opened atop the Billboard 200 with 1.21 million US sales[160] and topped the charts in the UK, Australia, and Canada.[161] The album's lead single, \"Look What You Made Me Do\", was Swift's first UK number-one single[162] and topped charts in Australia, Ireland, New Zealand, and the US.[163] Its singles \"...Ready for It?\", \"End Game\", and \"Delicate\" were released to pop radio.[164] Reputation was nominated for a Grammy Award for Best Pop Vocal Album.[165] Swift featured on the country duo Sugarland's \"Babe\" (2018).[166] At the 2018 American Music Awards, Swift won four awards, which made her accumulate 23 trophies in total and become the AMAs' most awarded female musician, surpassing Whitney Houston.[167] The same year, she embarked on her Reputation Stadium Tour,[168] which became the highest-grossing North American concert tour in history and grossed $345.7 million worldwide.[169] In November 2018, Swift signed a new deal with Universal Music Group, which promoted her subsequent albums under Republic Records' imprint.[170] The contract included a provision for Swift to maintain ownership of her masters. In addition, in the event that Universal sold any part of its stake in Spotify, it agreed to distribute a non-recoupable portion of the proceeds among its artists.[171][172] Swift's first album with Republic Records, Lover, was released in August 2019.[173] She produced the album with Antonoff, Louis Bell, Frank Dukes, and Joel Little.[174] Lover peaked atop the charts of such territories as Australia, Canada, Ireland, Mexico, Norway, Sweden, the UK, and the US.[175] The album spawned five singles: \"Me!\", \"You Need to Calm Down\", \"Lover\", \"The Man\", and \"Cruel Summer\"; the first two singles peaked at number two on the Billboard Hot 100, and the lattermost single became a resurgent success in 2023, reaching number one.[176] Lover was 2019's best selling album in the US and best selling album by a solo artist worldwide.[177] The album and its singles earned three nominations at the 62nd Annual Grammy Awards in 2020.[178] At the 2019 MTV Video Music Awards, Swift won three awards including Video of the Year for \"You Need to Calm Down\", becoming the first female and second artist overall to win the category for a self-directed video.[179] While promoting Lover in 2019, Swift became embroiled in a public dispute with the talent manager Scooter Braun after he purchased Big Machine Records, including the masters of her albums that the label had released.[180] Swift said she had been trying to buy the masters, but Big Machine would only allow her to do so if she exchanged one new album for each older one under a new contract, which she refused to sign.[180] In November 2020, Swift began re-recording her back catalog, which enabled her to own the new masters and the licensing of her songs for commercial use, substituting for the Big Machine-owned masters.[181] In February 2020, Swift signed a global publishing deal with Universal Music Publishing Group after her 16-year contract with Sony/ATV expired.[182] Amidst the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, Swift surprise-released two \"sister albums\" that she recorded and produced with Antonoff and Aaron Dessner: Folklore in July and Evermore in December.[183] Joe Alwyn co-wrote and co-produced a few songs under the pseudonym William Bowery.[184] Both albums incorporated a muted indie folk and alternative rock production;[185] each was supported by three singles catering to US pop, country, and triple A radio formats. The singles were \"Cardigan\", \"Betty\", and \"Exile\" from Folklore, and \"Willow\", \"No Body, No Crime\", and \"Coney Island\" from Evermore.[186] Folklore was the bestselling album of 2020 in the US[187] and, together with \"Cardigan\", made Swift the first artist to debut a US number-one album and a number-one song in the same week; she achieved the feat again with Evermore and \"Willow\".[188] According to Billboard, Swift was the highest-paid musician in the US and highest-paid solo musician worldwide of 2020.[189] Folklore made Swift the first woman to win the Grammy Award for Album of the Year three times, winning the category at the 63rd Annual Grammy Awards (2021).[190] At the American Music Awards, Swift won three awards including Artist of the Year for a third record time (2020)[191] and Favorite Pop/Rock Female Artist and Favorite Pop/Rock Album (2021).[192] Swift played Bombalurina in the film adaptation of Andrew Lloyd Webber's musical Cats (2019), for which she co-wrote and recorded the Golden Globe-nominated original song \"Beautiful Ghosts\".[193][194] The documentary Miss Americana, which chronicled parts of Swift's life and career, premiered at the 2020 Sundance Film Festival.[195] Swift's re-recordings of her first six studio albums began with Fearless (Taylor's Version) and Red (Taylor's Version), which were released in April and November 2021. Both peaked atop the Billboard 200, and the former was the first re-recorded album to do so.[196] Fearless (Taylor's Version) was preceded by \"Love Story (Taylor's Version)\", which made Swift the second artist after Dolly Parton to have both the original and re-recorded versions of a song reach number one on Hot Country Songs.[197] Red (Taylor's Version) was supported by \"All Too Well (10 Minute Version)\", which became the longest song in history to top the Hot 100.[198] Swift's tenth studio album, Midnights, was released in October 2022.[199] The album incorporates a restrained electropop[200] and synth-pop sound[201] with elements of hip hop, R&B, and electronica.[199][202] In the US, Midnights was her fifth to open atop the Billboard 200 with first-week sales of over one million copies, and its tracks, led by the single \"Anti-Hero\", made Swift the first artist to monopolize the top 10 of the Hot 100.[203] Globally, the album broke the record for the most single-day streams and most single-week streams on Spotify and peaked atop the charts of at least 14 countries.[204] The album's two further singles, \"Lavender Haze\" and \"Karma\", both peaked at number two on the Billboard Hot 100.[205] According to Billboard, Swift was the top-earning solo artist in the US and the top-earning musician worldwide of 2021.[206][207] She won six American Music Awards including Artist of the Year in 2022.[208] At the MTV Video Music Awards, Swift won her third and fourth trophies for Video of the Year with All Too Well: The Short Film, her self-directed short film that accompanies \"All Too Well (10 Minute Version)\", in 2022[209] and \"Anti-Hero\" in 2023.[210] During this period, Swift won three Grammy Awards: Best Music Video for All Too Well: The Short Film[211] and Best Pop Vocal Album and Album of the Year for Midnights. Swift became the first artist to win Album of the Year four times in Grammy history.[212] Swift's next two re-recorded albums, Speak Now (Taylor's Version) and 1989 (Taylor's Version), were released in July and October 2023. The former made Swift the woman with the most number-one albums (12) in Billboard 200 history, surpassing Barbra Streisand,[213] and the latter was her sixth album to sell one million copies in a single week in the US, claiming her career's largest album sales week.[214] 1989 (Taylor's Version)'s single \"Is It Over Now?\" peaked at number one on the Billboard Hot 100.[215] Swift featured on Big Red Machine's \"Renegade\" and \"Birch\" (2021),[216] Haim's \"Gasoline\" (2021),[217] Ed Sheeran's \"The Joker and the Queen\" (2022),[218] and the National's \"The Alcott\" (2023).[219] For the soundtrack of Where the Crawdads Sing (2022), she wrote and recorded \"Carolina\", which received nominations for Best Original Song at the Golden Globes and Best Song Written for Visual Media at the Grammy Awards.[220] In 2023, Swift was the most streamed artist on Spotify,[221] Apple Music,[222] and Amazon Music;[223] and the first act to place number one on the year-end Billboard top artists list in three different decades (2009, 2015 and 2023).[224] She had five out of the 10 best-selling albums of 2023 in the US, a record since Luminate began tracking US music sales in 1991.[225] Besides music, Swift had a supporting role in the period comedy film Amsterdam (2022)[226] and began writing an original script for her directorial feature film debut with Searchlight Pictures.[227] In March 2023, Swift embarked on the Eras Tour, a retrospective tour covering all her studio albums. Media outlets extensively covered the tour's global cultural and economic impact,[228] and its US leg broke the record for the most tickets sold in a day.[203] Ticketmaster received public and political criticisms for mishandling the tour's ticket sales.[229] The Eras Tour became the highest-grossing tour in history.[230][231] Its concert film, released to theaters worldwide on October 13, 2023, grossed over $250 million to become the highest-grossing concert film and was nominated for the Golden Globe Award for Cinematic and Box Office Achievement.[232][233] Swift's eleventh studio album, The Tortured Poets Department, was released on April 19, 2024.[234] Topping charts globally, the album broke a string of records: it marked the first album ever to amass 1 billion Spotify streams in a week; sold 2.6 million units in its first week in the US; made Swift the first artist to monopolize the top 14 of the Billboard Hot 100 and the top 10 of Australia's ARIA Singles Chart; and went on to spend 16 weeks atop the Billboard 200—Swift's longest-running number-one album on the chart. The lead single, \"Fortnight,\" featuring Post Malone, became Swift's 12th number one song on the Hot 100.[235][236][237] After the pandemic, Swift's music releases, touring, and related activities culminated in an unprecedented height of popularity.[238] From 2023 onward, Swift found ubiquitous success, albeit more dominant than before, with the successes of the re-recordings, the Eras Tour, its concert film, Midnights, and The Tortured Poets Department, significantly increasing her net worth; Music Business Worldwide remarked this as a \"new stratosphere of global career success\" for Swift.[239][240] In 2023, she began dating the American football player Travis Kelce,[241] and in 2024, won Artist of the Year at the 2024 iHeartRadio Music Awards.[242] The same year, AI-generated fake pornographic images portraying Swift were posted to Twitter and spread to other social media platforms, spurring criticism and demands for legal reform.[243] In July, Swift and Kelce received death threats from a stalker in Gelsenkirchen, Germany,[244] and three children were killed in a stabbing attack at a Swift-themed workshop in Southport, England, leading to civil unrest in the UK.[245] In August, all three of the Eras Tour concerts in Vienna were canceled following the arrest of two suspects for allegedly planning an Islamic State-inspired terrorist attack in the city. The plan was uncovered by US Intelligence and was thwarted by Austrian police forces.[246] Swift's early musical influences were 1990s female country musicians such as Shania Twain, Faith Hill, LeAnn Rimes, and the Dixie Chicks,[247] and Keith Urban's country crossover sounds incorporating rock, pop, and blues.[248] She self-identified as a country musician and achieved prominence as a country pop singer with her first four studio albums, from Taylor Swift to Red.[249] The albums feature country signifiers such as banjo, six-string banjo, mandolin, fiddle, and a slight vocal twang, in addition to pop melodies and rock influences;[250][251] Speak Now draws on rock styles such as pop rock, pop-punk, and 1980s arena rock.[95][252] Critics argued that country was an indicator of Swift's narrative songwriting rather than musical direction[253][254] and accused her of causing mainstream country music to stray from its roots.[255][256] After the critical debate around Red's eclectic pop, rock, and electronic styles, Swift chose 1980s synth-pop as a defining sound of her recalibrated pop artistry and image, inspired by the music of Phil Collins, Annie Lennox, Peter Gabriel, and Madonna.[257][258] 1989, the first album in this direction, incorporates electronic arrangements consisting of dense synthesizers and drum machines.[259] Swift expanded on the electronic production on her next albums;[260] Reputation consists of hip hop, R&B, and EDM influences;[158][261] and Lover features eclectic elements from country, pop-punk, and folk rock.[262] When Swift embraced a pop identity, rockist critics regarded her move as an erosion of her country music songwriting authenticity,[263] but others regarded it as necessary for Swift's artistic evolution and defended her as a pioneer of poptimism.[264][265] Her 2020 albums Folklore and Evermore explore alternative and indie styles of rock and folk, and both incorporate a subtle, stripped-back soundscape with orchestration, synthesizers, and drum pads.[266][267] The latter experiments with varied song structures, asymmetric time signatures, and diverse instruments.[268][269] Critics deemed the indie styles a mature representation of Swift's artistry as a singer-songwriter.[267] Midnights and The Tortured Poets Department both incorporate a minimalist, subdued synth-pop sound, making use of analog synthesizers, sustained bass notes, and simple drum machine patterns.[270][271] With continuous musical reinventions,[272] Swift was described by Time and the BBC as a musical \"chameleon\".[273][274] Jody Rosen commented that by originating her career in Nashville, Swift made a \"bait-and-switch maneuver, planting roots in loamy country soil, then pivoting to pop\".[275] Clash wrote that she has the versatility to \"no longer [...] be defined by any genre or sound label\".[276] According to Ann Powers, Swift's sound is genre-agnostic, blending and \"reconfiguring\" elements of country, R&B, indie pop, and hip hop.[277][278] Swift possesses a mezzo-soprano vocal range[283] and a generally soft and breathy timbre that Rolling Stone deemed versatile.[284][285] Reviews of Swift's early country albums criticized her vocals as weak and strained compared to those of other female country singers.[286] Despite the criticism, most reviewers appreciated that Swift refrained from correcting her pitch with Auto-Tune and how she prioritized \"intimacy over power and nuance\" to communicate the messages of her songs with her audience[287]—a style that has been described as conversational.[288][289] According to Powers, Swift's defining vocal feature was her attention to detail to convey an exact feeling—\"the line that slides down like a contented sigh or up like a raised eyebrow\".[290] On Red and 1989, Swift's vocals are electronically processed to accompany the pop production.[291][288] Her voice on Reputation and Midnights incorporates hip-hop and R&B influences that result in a near-rap delivery which emphasizes rhythm and cadence over melody.[292][277] She uses her lower register vocals extensively in \"Cardigan\"[293] and both her lower and upper registers in Evermore; the musicologist Alyssa Barca described her timbre in the upper register as \"breathy and bright\" and the lower register as \"full and dark\".[269] Reviews in The New York Times, Variety and The Atlantic were more appreciative of Swift's vocals in her later albums.[251][294][295][296] She ranked 102nd on Rolling Stone's 2023 list of the 200 Greatest Singers of All Time: \"A decade ago, including her on this list would have been a controversial move, but recent releases like Folklore, Evermore, and Midnights officially settled the argument.\"[285] Laura Snapes of The Guardian said that Swift's \"vocal directness\" enables her to express wide-ranging feelings, highlighting some trademarks such as \"yo-yoing vocal yelp\" and \"climactic, processed cri de coeur\".[297] Amanda Petrusich praised how the clarity and tone of Swift's live vocals accentuate her lyrics.[298] Swift's fascination with songwriting began in her childhood. She credited her mother with igniting confidence and early songwriting interests by helping her prepare for class presentations.[299][300] She enjoyed Disney film soundtracks and would make up lyrics once she had run out of words singing them.[301] Her lyrical influences include female country songwriters such as Patsy Cline, Loretta Lynn, Tammy Wynette, and Dolly Parton;[19][104] 1990s songwriters such as Melissa Etheridge, Sarah McLachlan, and Alanis Morissette;[302] Joni Mitchell;[303] and Fall Out Boy.[304] She listed Paul McCartney, Bruce Springsteen, Emmylou Harris, and Kris Kristofferson as career role models, citing their both evolving and consistent songwriting outputs.[28][305] Her literary influences include the authors William Shakespeare, Nathaniel Hawthorne, F. Scott Fitzgerald,[306] and the poets William Wordsworth, Robert Frost, and Emily Dickinson;[307] the last of whom was a distant cousin of Swift.[308] In The New Yorker in 2011, Swift said she identifies as a songwriter first: \"I write songs, and my voice is just a way to get those lyrics across\".[28] Her personal experiences were a common inspiration for her early songs, which helped her navigate life.[309][310] Her \"diaristic\" technique began with identifying an emotion, followed by a corresponding melody.[311][312] On her first three studio albums, love, heartbreak, and insecurities, from an adolescent perspective, were dominant themes.[95][313] She delved into the tumult of toxic relationships on Red,[314] and embraced nostalgia and post-romance positivity on 1989.[257] Reputation was inspired by the downsides of Swift's fame,[315] and Lover detailed her realization of the \"full spectrum of love\".[316] Other themes in Swift's music include family dynamics, friendship,[317][318] alienation, self-awareness, and tackling vitriol, especially sexism.[300][319] She often references or draws inspiration from historical events and figures.[320] Swift's confessional lyrics received positive reviews from critics,[321][28][322] who highlighted their vivid details and emotional engagement, which they found uncommon in pop music,[323][324][325] although some perceived her as a fragile, juvenile artist, a label she has consistently challenged.[321] Critics also praised her melodic compositions; Rolling Stone described Swift as \"a songwriting savant with an intuitive gift for verse-chorus-bridge architecture\".[326][327] NPR dubbed Swift \"a master of the vernacular in her lyrics\",[158] remarking that her songs offer emotional engagement because \"the wit and clarity of her arrangements turn them from standard fare to heartfelt disclosures\".[327] Despite the positive reception, The New Yorker stated she was generally portrayed \"more as a skilled technician than as a Dylanesque visionary\".[28] Tabloid media often speculated and linked the subjects of her songs with her ex-lovers, a practice reviewers and Swift herself criticized as sexist.[328][329][330] Aside from clues in album liner notes, Swift avoided talking about the subjects of her songs.[331] On her 2020 albums Folklore and Evermore, Swift was inspired by escapism and romanticism to explore fictional narratives.[332] She imposed emotions onto imagined characters and story arcs, which liberated her from tabloid attention and suggested new paths for her artistry.[311] Swift explained that she welcomed the new songwriting direction after she stopped worrying about commercial success.[332] According to Spin, she explored complex emotions with \"precision and devastation\" on Evermore.[333] Consequence stated her 2020 albums convinced skeptics of her songwriting prowess, noting her transformation from \"teenage wunderkind to a confident and careful adult\".[334] Swift divides her writing into three types: \"quill lyrics\", songs rooted in antiquated poeticism; \"fountain pen lyrics\", based on modern and vivid storylines; and \"glitter gel pen lyrics\", which are lively and frivolous.[335] Fans noticed that the fifth track of every Swift album was the most emotionally vulnerable of the album.[336] Awarding her with the Songwriter Icon Award in 2021, the National Music Publishers' Association remarked that \"no one is more influential when it comes to writing music today\".[337] The Week deemed her the foremost female songwriter of modern times,[338] and the Nashville Songwriters Association International named her Songwriter-Artist of the Decade in 2022.[203] Swift has also published two original poems: \"Why She Disappeared\" and \"If You're Anything Like Me\".[339] Critics have analyzed the distinctive qualities and thematic depth in Swift's songwriting. Critic Kitty Empire opined in 2024 that Swift is \"a profoundly old-fashioned artist\", whose songs \"tell a story, in succinct, emotive ways that often scan meticulously\" unlike most pop music of the time; Empire attributed it to Swift's country beginnings.[340] Swift's bridges are often noted as one of the best aspects of her songs,[341][334] earning her the title \"Queen of Bridges\" from Time.[342] Mojo dubbed her \"a sharp narrator with a gift for the extended metaphor\".[343] Academics have variably described her as a poet laureate,[344] philosopher,[345] and bard.[346] Swift commands large audiences on stage,[347][348][349] captivating them through emotional storytelling and vocal delivery rather than relying on elaborate choreography.[350] According to V magazine's Greg Krelenstein, she possesses \"a rare gift of turning a stadium spectacle into an intimate setting\", irrespective of whether she is \"plucking a guitar or leading an army of dancers\".[351] In a 2008 review of Swift's early performances, Sasha Frere-Jones of The New Yorker called Swift a \"preternaturally skilled\" entertainer with a vibrant stage presence, adding \"she returned the crowd's energy with the professionalism she has shown since the age of fourteen.\"[352] In 2023, Adrian Horton of The Guardian noted her \"seemingly endless stamina\" on the Eras Tour,[353] and i critic Ilana Kaplan called her showmanship \"unparalleled\".[354] Swift's concert productions have been characterized by elaborate Broadway theatricality and high technology,[355] and her performances frequently incorporate a live band, with whom she has played and toured since 2007.[356] Swift also often accompanies herself with musical instruments such as electric guitar;[357] acoustic guitar; piano;[358] and sometimes twelve-string guitar,[359][360] six-string banjo,[361] or ukulele.[362] Interacting frequently with the audience, her solo acoustic performances are considered intimate and emotionally resonant, complementing her story-based lyrics and fan connection.[298][363] Lydia Burgham of The Spinoff opined that this intimacy remains \"integral to her singer-songwriter origins\".[364][358] Chris Willman of Variety called Swift \"pop's most approachable superstar\",[365] and the 21st century's most popular performer.[366] Swift emphasizes visuals as a key creative component of her music-making process.[367] She has collaborated with different directors to produce her music videos, and over time, she has become more involved with writing and directing. She developed the concept and treatment for \"Mean\" in 2011[368] and co-directed the music video for \"Mine\" with Roman White the year before.[369] In an interview, White said that Swift \"was keenly involved in writing the treatment, casting and wardrobe. And she stayed for both the 15-hour shooting days, even when she wasn't in the scenes.\"[370] From 2014 to 2018, Swift collaborated with director Joseph Kahn on eight music videos—four each from her albums 1989 and Reputation. Kahn has praised Swift's involvement.[371] She worked with American Express for the \"Blank Space\" music video (which Kahn directed) and served as an executive producer for the interactive app AMEX Unstaged: Taylor Swift Experience, for which she won a Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Interactive Program in 2015.[372] Swift produced the music video for \"Bad Blood\" and won a Grammy Award for Best Music Video in 2016.[373] Her production company, Taylor Swift Productions, is credited with producing all of her visual media, starting with the 2018 concert documentary Reputation Stadium Tour.[374] She continued to co-direct music videos for the Lover singles \"Me!\" with Dave Meyers, and \"You Need to Calm Down\" (also serving as a co-executive producer) and \"Lover\" with Drew Kirsch,[375] but first ventured into sole direction with the video for \"The Man\" (which won her the MTV Video Music Award for Best Direction).[376] After Folklore: The Long Pond Studio Sessions, Swift debuted as a filmmaker with All Too Well: The Short Film,[203] which made her the first artist to win the Grammy Award for Best Music Video as a sole director.[377] Swift has cited Chloé Zhao, Greta Gerwig, Nora Ephron, Guillermo del Toro, John Cassavetes, and Noah Baumbach as filmmaking influences.[367] Swift's discography is a \"critically hailed songbook\", as per Time's Sam Lansky.[378] She has won 14 Grammy Awards (including four for Album of the Year—the most won by an artist),[379] an Emmy Award,[380] 40 American Music Awards (the most won by an artist),[381] 39 Billboard Music Awards (the most won by an artist—tying with Drake),[382] 118 Guinness World Records,[383] 30 MTV Video Music Awards (including five Video of the Year wins—the most by an act),[384] 12 Country Music Association Awards (including the Pinnacle Award),[385] eight Academy of Country Music Awards,[386] and two Brit Awards.[147] As a songwriter, she has been honored by the Nashville Songwriters Association,[59][387] the Songwriters Hall of Fame, and the National Music Publishers' Association and was the youngest person on Rolling Stone's list of the 100 Greatest Songwriters of All Time in 2015.[388][389] At the 64th BMI Awards in 2016, Swift was the first woman to be honored with an award named after its recipient.[390] From available data, Swift has amassed over 50 million album sales and 150 million single sales as of 2019,[391][392][393] and 114 million units globally, including 78 billion streams as of 2021.[394][395] The International Federation of the Phonographic Industry ranked her as the Global Recording Artist of the Year for a record four times (2014, 2019, 2022, and 2023).[396] Swift has the most number-one albums in the UK and Ireland for a female artist this millennium,[397][398] earned the highest income for an artist on Chinese digital music platforms (CN¥ 159,000,000 as of 2021),[399] and is the first artist to occupy the entire top five[note 2] of the Australian albums chart[402][403] and the top ten of the country's singles chart.[404] Swift remains the world's highest-grossing female touring act ever, with cumulative ticket sales at $1.96 billion as of November 2023, per Pollstar.[405] The Eras Tour is the highest-grossing tour of all time and the first to surpass $1 billion in revenue.[406][407] Beginning with Fearless, each of her studio albums have opened with over one million global units.[408][409] Swift is the most-streamed act on Spotify,[410] and the most-streamed female artist on Apple Music.[411] On Spotify, she is the only artist to have received more than 250 million and 350 million streams in one day (260 million on October 27, 2023, and 380 million on April 19, 2024)[412] and was the first female act to reach 100 million monthly listeners.[413][198] The most entries and the most simultaneous entries (175 and 34 songs), and most number-ones (5) for a soloist on the Billboard Global 200, are among her feats.[414][415] Swift is the first and only artist to occupy the top nine spots on the Global 200.[414] She has the most entries (154), top-ten songs (20), and number-ones (3)[note 3] among solo acts on the Global 200 Excl. US.[414] In the US, Swift has sold over 37.3 million albums as of 2019,[393] when Billboard placed her eighth on its Greatest of All Time Artists Chart.[416] Twelve of her songs have topped the Billboard Hot 100.[417] She is the longest-reigning and the first act to spend at least 100 weeks atop the Billboard Artist 100 (120 weeks);[418][419] the soloist with the most cumulative weeks atop and in the top ten of the Billboard 200 (84 and 425);[420][421] the woman with the most Billboard 200 number-ones (14),[422] Hot 100 entries (total and single-week: 264 and 32),[423] number-one debuts (7),[note 4] top-ten songs (59),[417] top-five songs (36),[198] Streaming Songs chart-toppers (9),[417] and weeks atop the Top Country Albums chart (101);[425] and the act with the most number-one songs on Pop Airplay (13)[426] and Digital Songs (29).[417] Swift is the first woman to simultaneously chart five albums in the top 10 and eleven albums on the entire Billboard 200;[427][428] and the first act to occupy the top four spots and chart seven albums[note 5] in the top 10 on the Top Album Sales chart.[430][431] She is the second highest-certified female digital singles artist (and fifth overall) in the US, with 137.5 million total units certified by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA),[432] and the first woman to have both an album (Fearless) and a song (\"Shake It Off\") certified Diamond.[433] Swift is the only artist in Luminate history to have seven albums sell over a million copies in a week.[434] Swift has appeared in various power listings. Time included her on its annual list of the 100 most influential people in 2010, 2015, and 2019.[435] She was one of the \"Silence Breakers\" that the magazine spotlighted as Person of the Year in 2017 for speaking up about sexual assault,[436] and she received the honor again in 2023 for her cultural domination that year.[378] Time described Swift as the first Person of the Year to be recognized for \"achievement in the arts\", as well as the first woman to be recognized and appear on a Person of the Year cover more than once.[437][378] In 2014, she was named to Forbes' 30 Under 30 list in the music category[438] and again in 2017 in its \"All-Star Alumni\" category.[439] Swift became the youngest woman to be included on Forbes' list of the 100 most powerful women in 2015, ranked at number 64.[440] In 2023, she was ranked by Forbes as the fifth-most powerful woman in the world, the first entertainer to place in the top five.[441] Swift received an honorary Doctor of Fine Arts degree from New York University and served as its commencement speaker on May 18, 2022.[203] In 2024, Billboard ranked her at number 2 on its \"Greatest Pop Stars of the 21st Century\" list.[442] Swift has been credited with making a profound impact on the music industry, popular culture, and the economy.[443][444] She dominates cultural conversations,[445][446] leading some publications to describe her as a cultural \"vitality\" or zeitgeist.[447][448][449] Her music, life, and public image are points of attention in global celebrity culture.[272] Initially a teen idol,[450] she has been referred to as a pop icon;[260][451] publications describe her enormous popularity and longevity as unwitnessed since the 20th century.[452][453] In 2013, New York magazine's Jody Rosen dubbed Swift the \"world's biggest pop star\" and opined that the trajectory of her stardom has defied established patterns. Rosen added that Swift \"falls between genres, eras, demographics, paradigms, trends\", leaving her contemporaries \"vying for second place\".[275] Critics regard Swift as a rare yet successful combination of the pop star and singer-songwriter archetypes.[454] Swift's fans are known as Swifties.[229] Billboard noted that only a few artists have achieved her level of chart success, critical acclaim, and fan support.[455] Swift's million-selling albums are considered an anomaly in the streaming-dominated industry following the end of the album era in the 2010s.[456][457] Economist Alan Krueger described Swift as an \"economic genius\".[458] Although labeled by the media in her early career as \"America's Sweetheart\" for her girl next door persona,[459][460] Swift has been called by detractors \"calculated\" and manipulative of her image, a narrative bolstered by her 2016 dispute with West.[461][462] Critics have also noted that her personal life and career have been subject to intense misogyny and \"slut-shaming\",[463][464] as well as rampant media scrutiny and tabloid speculation.[465] Swift has also been a victim of numerous house break-ins and stalkers, some of whom were armed.[466][467] Swift's private jet use has drawn scrutiny for its carbon emissions.[468][469] In 2023, a spokesperson for Swift stated that she had purchased more than double the required carbon credits to offset all tour travel and personal flights.[470][471] In December 2023, Swift's lawyers sent a cease and desist letter to American programmer Jack Sweeney over tracking her private jet, alleging stalking and safety risks; media outlets have reported that the information posted by Sweeney is a synthesis of publicly available data.[472][473] In February 2024, it was reported that Swift had sold one of her two private jets.[474] \"You have different artists dominating different sectors of the industry: Some are huge at streaming, some are big draws on the road. But we're at this moment where there's no one better than Taylor Swift, whether that's on the radio, with streaming, ticket sales or just cultural impact.\" Swift helped shape the modern country music scene,[476] having extended her success beyond the Anglosphere,[275][476] pioneered the use of the internet (Myspace) as a marketing tool,[27][47] and introduced the genre to a younger generation.[477][275] Country labels have since become interested in signing young singers who write their own music;[478] her guitar performances contributed to the \"Taylor Swift factor\": a phenomenon to which an upsurge in guitar sales to women, a previously ignored demographic, is attributed.[479][480] According to Pitchfork, Swift changed the music landscape with her genre transitions, a discography that accommodates cultural shifts,[481] and Billboard notes her ability to popularize any sound in mainstream music.[482] Lyrically, in being personal and vulnerable in her songs, music journalist Nick Catucci opined Swift helped make space for later singers like Billie Eilish, Ariana Grande, and Halsey to do the same.[483] Scholars have highlighted the literary sensibility and poptimist implications of Swift.[484][485] She has been credited with legitimizing and popularizing the concept of album \"eras\".[486][487] Swift is a subject of academic study and scholarly media research.[272] Various educational institutions offer courses on Swift in literary, cultural, and sociopolitical contexts.[488][272] Swift has influenced numerous music artists, and her albums have inspired a generation of singer-songwriters.[477][266][489] Journalists praise her ability to reform industry practices, noting how her actions changed streaming policies, prompted awareness of intellectual property in new musicians,[490][491] and reshaped ticketing models.[492] Various sources deem Swift's music a paradigm representing the millennial generation;[493] Vox called her the \"millennial Bruce Springsteen\",[494] and The Times named her \"the Bob Dylan of our age\".[495] Swift earned the title Woman of the Decade (2010s) from Billboard,[496] Artist of the Decade (2010s) at the American Music Awards,[497] and Global Icon at the Brit Awards for her impact.[395] Senior artists such as Madonna,[498] Stevie Nicks,[499] Jon Bon Jovi,[500] Dolly Parton,[501] and Elton John have praised her musicianship.[502] Carole King regards Swift as her \"professional granddaughter\" and thanked Swift for \"carrying the torch forward\".[503] Springsteen called her a \"tremendous\" writer,[504] while Elvis Costello compared Swift's songwriting to that of Bob Dylan,[505] and Billy Joel considered Swift the Beatles' successor.[506] Britney Spears labeled Swift \"the most iconic pop woman of our generation\".[507] Media outlets describe Swift as a savvy businesswoman;[508][509] in 2024, she topped Billboard's annual Power 100 ranking of the top music industry executives.[510] Swift is known for her traditional album rollouts, consisting of a variety of promotional activities that Rolling Stone termed as an inescapable \"multimedia bonanza\".[511][512] Easter eggs and cryptic teasers became a common practice in contemporary pop music because of Swift.[513] Publications describe her discography as a music \"universe\" subject to analysis by fans, critics, and journalists.[514][515][516] Swift maintains an active presence on social media and a close relationship with fans, to which many journalists attribute her success.[517][444][518] Her in-house management team is called 13 Management.[519] Swift has endorsed many brands and businesses, having launched clothing lines with L.E.I. and Stella McCartney,[520][521] designed American Greetings cards and Jakks Pacific dolls,[522][523] released a number of fragrances with Elizabeth Arden,[524] and signed multi-year deals with AT&T and Capital One.[525][526] She was a spokesperson for the National Hockey League's Nashville Predators and Sony Cyber-shot digital cameras,[527][528] and became the global ambassador for New York City in 2014 and Record Store Day in 2022.[529][530] Swift identifies as a pro-choice feminist,[531] and is a founding signatory of the Time's Up movement against sexual harassment.[532] Specifically, she criticized the US Supreme Court's decision to end federal abortion rights in 2022.[533] Swift also advocates for LGBT rights,[534] and has called for the passing of the Equality Act, which prohibits discrimination based on sex, sexual orientation, and gender identity.[535][536] She performed during WorldPride NYC 2019 at the Stonewall Inn, a gay rights monument, and has donated to the LGBT organizations Tennessee Equality Project and GLAAD.[537][538][539] A supporter of the March for Our Lives movement and gun control reform in the US,[540] Swift is a vocal critic of white supremacy, racism, and police brutality.[541][531] Following the George Floyd protests, she donated to the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund and the Black Lives Matter movement,[542] called for the removal of Confederate monuments in Tennessee,[543] and advocated for Juneteenth to become a national holiday.[544] She has openly criticized former president Donald Trump.[545] In 2020, Swift urged her fans to check their voter registration ahead of elections, which resulted in 65,000 people registering to vote within one day of her post,[546] and endorsed Joe Biden and Kamala Harris in the 2020 US presidential election.[547] For the 2024 election, she endorsed Harris and Tim Walz.[548][549] Swift became a billionaire in October 2023, becoming the world's first musician to achieve the status \"solely based on her songs and performances\".[550][551] Forbes has estimated her net worth at $1.6 billion as of October 2024,[552] making her the richest female musician in the world.[553] Forbes had named her the annual top-earning female musician in 2016, 2019, 2021, and 2022.[554] She was the highest-paid celebrity of 2016 with $170 million—a feat recognized by Guinness World Records as the highest annual earnings ever for a female musician,[555] which she herself surpassed with $185 million in 2019.[556] Overall, Swift was listed as the Forbes highest-paid female artist of the 2010s, earning $825 million.[557] She has also developed a real estate portfolio worth $150 million as of 2023, with residential properties in Nashville, New York City, Los Angeles (Samuel Goldwyn Estate), and Rhode Island (High Watch).[558] Swift ranked first on DoSomething's 2015 \"Gone Good\" list,[559] having received the Star of Compassion from the Tennessee Disaster Services and the Big Help Award from the Nickelodeon Kids' Choice Awards for her \"dedication to helping others\" and \"inspiring others through action\".[560][561] Especially early in her career, Swift donated to various relief funds following natural disasters. In 2009, she donated $100,000 to the Red Cross to help the victims of the Iowa flood of 2008.[562] The same year, she performed at Sydney's Sound Relief concert, which raised money for those impacted by bushfires and flooding.[563] In 2011, Swift used a dress rehearsal of her Speak Now tour as a benefit concert for victims of recent tornadoes in the US, raising more than $750,000.[564] In response to the May 2010 Tennessee floods, she donated $500,000.[565] In 2009, Swift sang at BBC's Children in Need concert and raised £13,000 for the cause.[566] In 2016, she donated $1 million to Louisiana flood relief efforts and $100,000 to the Dolly Parton Fire Fund.[567][568] Swift donated to food banks after Hurricane Harvey struck Houston in 2017.[569] Swift donated $1 million for Tennessee tornado relief in 2020 and again in 2023,[570][571] as well as $5 million toward the reliefs efforts after Hurricane Helene and Hurricane Milton in 2024.[572] Swift has also donated to cancer research. As recipient of the Academy of Country Music's Entertainer of the Year in 2011, Swift donated $25,000 to St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Tennessee.[573] In 2012, she participated in the Stand Up to Cancer telethon, performing the charity single \"Ronan\", which she wrote in memory of a four-year-old boy who died of neuroblastoma.[574] She has also donated $100,000 to the V Foundation for Cancer Research[575] and $50,000 to the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia.[576] She has made donations to her fans several times for their medical or academic expenses.[577] During the COVID-19 pandemic, Swift donated to the World Health Organization and Feeding America[578] and supported independent record stores.[579][580] Swift performed \"Soon You'll Get Better\" on the One World: Together At Home television special, a benefit concert curated by Lady Gaga for Global Citizen to raise funds for the World Health Organization's COVID-19 Solidarity Response Fund.[581] She is a supporter of the arts.

Today she's the most recognizable country-- or formerly country? or pop?-- artist in North America, if not the world: her songwriting takes in half a dozen genres, and her economic impact changes cities. We will move through Swift's own catalogue, including hits, deep cuts, outtakes, re-recordings, considering songwriting as its own art, distinct from poems recited or silently read. We will learn how to study fan culture, celebrity culture, adolescence, adulthood and appropriation; how to think about white texts, Southern texts, transatlantic texts, and queer subtexts. We will learn how to think about illicit affairs, and hoaxes, champagne problems and incomplete closure. We will look at her precursors, from Dolly Parton to the Border Ballads, and at work about her (such as the documentary \"Miss Americana\"). And we will read literary works important to her and works about song and performance, with novels, memoirs and poems by (among others) Willa Cather, James Weldon Johnson, Tracey Thorn, and William Wordsworth.

Ones that have won playoff games, though admittedly not in a while. The longtime Pittsburgh Steelers defensive tackle, now well into his dotage in his 14th season, can't quite remember having a group like the one that he plays on now. “We have a complete team,” Heyward said. A team that began the season riddled with question marks now finds itself steamrolling toward Christmas with everything on the table. Russell Wilson threw for 158 yards and two touchdowns, Heyward recorded two sacks and the Steelers beat the Cleveland Browns 27-14 on Sunday even with leading receiver George Pickens watching from the sideline while missing the first game of his career due to a groin injury. While it took Wilson and the rest of the offense time to get going with the productive if volatile Pickens out of the mix, Wilson found his footing in the second half by connecting on touchdown passes to Pat Freiermuth and Van Jefferson as the Steelers (10-3) moved two games ahead of Baltimore for the AFC North lead with four weeks to go. Two weeks after a messy pratfall in the snow, Pittsburgh avoided being swept by the Browns for the first time since 1988 by taking advantage of the countless opportunities mistake-prone Cleveland (3-10) provided. Jameis Winston threw two interceptions, Dustin Hopkins missed two makeable field goals when the outcome was still in doubt and a series of ill-time flags added up to the Browns reaching double-digit losses for the 18th time since the franchise returned in 1999. “I don’t believe the Pittsburgh Steelers beat the Cleveland Browns,” Winston said. “I believe the Cleveland Browns beat the Cleveland Browns.” While Winston avoided the pick-6s that have dogged him throughout his career - including last week in Denver - but did little after hitting Jerry Jeudy for a 35-yard touchdown in the first quarter that gave the Browns an early lead. Winston finished 24 of 41 for 211 yards with two touchdowns and two interceptions. Nick Chubb ran for 48 yards in his return to Pittsburgh after a devastating knee injury on the same field 15 months ago forced him to miss more than a year. Yet the Steelers kept Myles Garrett relatively in check after the defensive star racked up three sacks in Cleveland's snowy upset on Nov. 21, and Pittsburgh's defense provided the spark that brought the offense to life. The surge began when Winston's screen pass intended for Chubb landed in the hands of 6-foot-4, 309-pound Steelers defensive tackle Keeanu Benton, who lugged his first career interception 11 yards. Najee Harris bulled over from 1 yard out five plays later to give the Steelers a lead they wouldn't relinquish. “That's what good teams do this time of year,” Pittsburgh coach Mike Tomlin said. “Somebody makes a play, the other side of the ball backs it up. That's what we're trying to do.” Cleveland had chances to keep the Steelers within sight, but Hopkins saw a 38-yard field goal at breezy Acrisure Stadium late in the first half sail wide left, then had a 43-yarder drift wide right early in the third quarter. “I need to find a good swing,” said Hopkins, who has an NFL-high nine misses. “The swing has been tough to find this year.” The Steelers scored on the ensuing possession when Wilson executed a perfect run-pass option by faking the ball to Jaylen Warren, rolling right and finding Jefferson wide-open in the end zone from 10 yards out to make it 20-7. Pittsburgh's Elandon Roberts stuffed Jerome Ford for a 5-yard loss on fourth down to end Cleveland's next possession, and Wilson connected with Freiermuth down the seam. The tight end stumbled into the newly painted yellow end zone to send the Browns back to Cleveland with a loss, just like they have during every regular season visit since 2004. It also sets the stage for a daunting finishing stretch for the Steelers, who face Philadelphia, Baltimore and Kansas City over the next three weeks, with two of the games coming on short rest. While Pittsburgh has quieted much of the noise that surrounded the team after a massive offensive overhaul in the offseason - led by the acquisition of Wilson - the Steelers understand the real test is still to come. “Why not test us before the playoffs, get a feel?” Freiermuth said. “They're all playoff teams we're playing, so it'll be great.” Browns: CB Mike Ford Jr. was placed in the concussion protocol in the first quarter. Steelers: DT Larry Ogunjobi (groin) left in the first half and did not return. ... DB Donte Jackson (back) exited in the third quarter.

                "content": "PITTSBURGH — The Browns couldn't get out of one franchise house of horrors with a win last Monday night when they threw away a potential win at the Denver Broncos. They had another chance to exorcise decades of disappointment in another place Sunday afternoon. Turns out, history is really hard for the Browns to shake. Cleveland went into Pittsburgh on Sunday and continued what has now turned into more than two decades of misery in the Steel City. The Browns were officially eliminated from playoff contention as they lost their 21st consecutive regular-season game in Pittsburgh with a 27-14 loss to the Steelers. The loss prevented the Browns (3-10) from achieving their first series sweep of the Steelers since 1988. Instead, it's the 16th time in 33 seasons the teams have split the season series, the same number of times Pittsburgh has swept the series in that span. The Browns were only down 13-7 at halftime. Kicker Dustin Hopkins missed a 38-yard field goal with less than 30 seconds remaining in the half that could've pulled them closer, which was made even worse when he missed a 43-yarder to open the third quarter. Pittsburgh (10-3) opened up a 27-7 lead through three quarters. Quarterback Jameis Winston was 24-of-41 passing for 211 yards with two touchdowns, two interceptions and a 68.2 passer rating. The Browns turned the ball over three times, compared to just once by the Steelers. Here's how the Browns' latest trip to the Steel City unfolded this afternoon: The Browns cornerback Greg Newsome II appeared to injure his left leg on the muffed punt late by teammate Kadarius Toney. He eventually walked to the locker room before the game ended. The Steelers' Cordarrelle Patterson was stripped by Browns defensive end Isaiah McGuire and the ball was recovered by Myles Garrett at the 50. Two plays later, quarterback Jameis Winston overthrew wide receiver Elijah Moore and the ball was intercepted by Pittsburgh's James Pierre with 3:57 remaining. The Browns pulled within 27-14 of the Steelers with 7:19 remaining. Quarterback Jameis Winston threw a 15-yard touchdown pass to tight end David Njoku, who he went up and got it over a Steelers defender in the front right corner of the end zone. The Browns had a third and 1 from the Steelers 16 on the first play of the fourth quarter. However, a false start and a sack by Cameron Heyward, with a post-play unnecessary roughness penalty on Browns offensive tackle Germain Ifedi, eventually left Cleveland with fourth and 24 from the Pittsburgh 39. The Browns are down 20 heading into the final 15 minutes of the game in Pittsburgh The rout is on for the Steelers. Pittsburgh opened up a 27-7 lead with 3:51 remaining in the third quarter when quarterback Russell Wilson found tight end Pat Freiermuth on the seam route for a 20-yard touchdown. The Browns were about a yard shy of the first down at the Pittsburgh 49. Instead of sneaking the ball with quarterback Jameis Winston, they tried a sweep with running back Jerome Ford, who was dropped for a 5-yard loss by Pittsburgh's Elandon Roberts. The game is starting to get away from the Browns. The Steelers turned the second Dustin Hopkins missed field goal into a 20-7 lead when quarterback Russell Wilson found a wide-open Van Jefferson in the end zone for a 10-yard touchdown with 8:37 remaining in the third quarter. Dustin Hopkins missed another field goal that could've help the Browns get a little closer. This time, he pushed a 38-yard field goal wide right with 12:40 remaining in the third quarter, The Browns got a spark to open the second half. Jerome Ford returned the second-half kickoff 56 yards to the Pittsburgh 39. The Browns failed to close the gap at the end of the first half. They will get the ball to start the second half. The Steelers have a 127-124 edge in total yards. Dustin Hopkins missed wide left on yet another sub-50-yard field goal attempt. This one was a 38-yarder he pushed left with 23 seconds left in the half. Pittsburgh's best true drive of the game got bogged down after an offensive pass interference call on wide receiver Mike Williams. That ultimately forced them to kick a 54-yard field goal by Chris Boswell, to push the lead to 13-7 with 4:21 remaining in the half. Pittsburgh capitalized on the interception, capping five-play drive with a 1-yard touchdown run by Najee Harris with 11 minutes remaining in the half. A big play on the drive was a 16-yard pass interference penalty against cornerback Greg Newsome II on a third-and-7 play from the Browns 28. Browns quarterback Jameis Winston threw his first interception of the game with just over 13 minutes remaining in the first half. Steelers defensive lineman Keeanu Benton stepped in front of a screen pass intended for running back Nick Chubb and intercepted it, returning it to the Browns 31. The Browns took a 7-3 lead into the second quarter over the Steelers. Cleveland has a 69-45 edge in total yards. The Browns offense managed to, with some help from a questionable roughing the passer penalty against Pittsburgh's Alex Highsmith, get to the Steelers 41. It had to punt from there, with the ball being downed at the Steelers 10. Mike Ford Jr. returned to the field on the punt. He was cleared on his head evaluation. Special teams ace Mike Ford Jr. is questionable to return for the Browns. Ford was being evaluated for a head injury. Jameis Winston avoided the pressure, as well as getting completely across the line of scrimmage, to throw a 35-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Jerry Jeudy. The pass, plus Dustin Hopkins' point-after kick, gave the Browns a 7-3 lead with 5:50 remaining in the first quarter. Winston got near the line of scrimmage, the Steelers 35, but released the ball before crossing the line. Special teams ace Mike Ford Jr. jogged to the locker room with 9:32 remaining with trainers in tow for the Browns. Ford had been taken originally to the medical tent with the NFL independent spotter going in with him after the Cleveland punt to end its first possession. There's been no immediate update on Ford's injury or status. Chris Boswell put the Steelers on the board with a 30-yard field goal with 9:32 remaining in the first quarter. That capped Pittsburgh's second drive, which started at the Cleveland 36 after a Calvin Austin 11-yard punt return. Here's the first 11 out on the field for the Browns offense: Here's the first 11 out on the field for the Browns defense: The Browns won the coin toss and deferred their choice. The Steelers elected to take the ball to open the game. So all of the pregame back-and-forth ended up being for nothing. Pittsburgh made wide receiver George Pickens inactive after the he sustained a hamstring injury during the week. Pickens and Browns cornerback Greg Newsome II were at a verbal back-and-forth during the week. The feud goes back to the teams' previous meeting on Nov. 21 in Cleveland. Newsome II was engaged with Pickens on the Steelers' final desperation Hail Mary, trying to prevent Pickens from being able to, at the very least, tip the ball to a teammate. Pickens clearly took exception and initially grabbed Newsome by the helmet and dragged him through the end zone and beyond the back line. Pickens threw Newsome down as he ripped off his helmet near the front of the stands. The two scuffled briefly before being separated, although the bad blood to carried into the postgame locker room, where Newsome called Pickens a \"fake tough guy\" while Pickens blamed the loss entirely on the snow. Asked by reporters in Pittsburgh if he planned to talk to Newsome before the game Sunday, Pickens said, \"I don't even know who that is.\" Then, asked about his postgame comments regarding the Browns not being a good team and only winning because of the snow, he replied, \"I just go by their record.\" Newsome was asked shortly after Pickens' comments for his thoughts. He responded. \"Nah, because the only way you would take something that somebody says disrespectful is if you actually care about that person,\" Newsome said Friday. \"So I don't care what he has to say or anybody has to say. So I don't take it as disrespectful because I don't care about the dude at all.\" Kickoff is at 1 p.m. Tickets for Sunday's game on StubHub can be purchased on StubHub from $108 before fees. It's a perfect mostly sunny December afternoon for football in Pittsburgh, with the temperature at kickoff expected to be a high near 47, according to the National Weather Service. Southwest wind 9 to 15 mph, with gusts as high as 25 mph. Cleveland fell to 3-9 on the season with a 41-32 loss to the Denver Broncos on Monday Night Football in Denver. Quarterback Jameis Winston set a career high and Browns franchise single-game passing record with 497 yards, but his four touchdowns were offset by three interceptions, two of which the Broncos returned for touchdowns. Wide receiver Jerry Jeudy also had a career-high 235 receiving yards in his first game back in Denver. The Steelers improved to 9-3 by beating the Cincinnati Bengals 44-38 last Sunday in Cincinnati. Quarterback Russell Wilson threw for 414 yards and three touchdowns in the win. So what should we expect from the Browns this afternoon against the Steelers? Click here to see what our writers project as the score of today's game. Today is the 148th all-time regular-season or playoff meeting between the Browns and the Steelers, which dates back to 1950. Here's a look at the series between Cleveland and Pittsburgh. Offensive tackle Jedrick Wills Jr., who has missed four of the last five games after hyperextending his right knee in Week 7 against the Cincinnati Bengals, was one of two players the Browns placed on injured reserve on Saturday. They did the same with defensive tackle Maurice Hurst II, who suffered injuries to his ankle and foot in last Monday night's loss to the Denver Broncos. Both Wills and Hurst would only be eligible to return for the season finale at the Baltimore Ravens. That would mean both will end their second consecutive season on injured reserve. For Wills, especially, it likely means the end of his Browns' career. He's a free agent after this season, having played this season on his fifth-year option. Wills' fifth season with the Browns, who took him No. 10 overall in the 2020 draft, has been marred by injuries. He didn't start practicing until Sept. 4 as he recovered from arthroscopic knee surgery he underwent last December. Hurst is making his second injured reserve appearance this season. He had an ankle injury in the season opener against the Dallas Cowboys that led to a four-game stint on the injured list. The defensive tackle did play in the previous seven games. He recorded 16 tackles and 0.5 sacks. The corresponding moves helped the Browns take care of another position of need, wide receiver. They signed both wide receivers Kadarius Toney and Michael Woods II from the practice squad to the 53-man active roster. Toney and Woods gives the Browns six wide receivers on the 53-man roster. The problem with that is that only two of the other four — Jerry Jeudy and Elijah Moore — aren't listed on the Browns injury report for Sunday's game as either out (Cedric Tillman) or questionable (Jamari Thrash). The Browns avoided using up Toney's three standard elevations by signing him to the roster. He had been elevated for the Week 11 loss at the New Orleans Saints, where he played six offensive snaps and losing seven yards on one rushing attempt, as well as last Monday night's loss at the Denver Broncos, where he played another six snaps and gained three yards on one rushing attempt while also being targeted on one pass attempt. Where Toney could potentially find steady work is in the return game. The former first-round draft pick had previous returned punts for both the New York Giants and Kansas City Chiefs. Woods was the other game-day elevation for the Denver game, his first elevation of the season. He has been on the Browns' practice squad all season after the 2022 sixth-round pick missed all of last season with an Achilles injury. The third-year pro made the most of his opportunity against the Broncos, which included a career-high 66 offensive snaps. He had three catches for 43 yards — all of which converted third downs on scoring drives — on five targets in Denver. The Browns also elevated wide receiver James Proche II from the practice squad to the gameday roster for Sunday's game at the Pittsburgh Steelers. They did the same for recently-signed defensive tackle T.Y. McGill to add depth to another position where they'll have another player — Sam Kamara — out for Sunday besides Hurst. Proche appeared in four games earlier this season for the Browns before being waived in Week 6, along with another 10 games last season with the team. He was re-signed in Week 7 to the practice squad. McGill was one of two defensive tackles, along with Michael Dwumfour, signed to the practice squad on Friday. The 10-year veteran has appeared in 58 career games with the Colts (2015-16), Browns (2017), Chargers (2018 and 2019), Eagles (2018 and 2020), Vikings (2021) and 49ers (2022-24), with 46 career tackles, 5.5 sacks and two forced fumbles. He appeared in one game with the 49ers this season. Chris Easterling can be reached at ceasterling@thebeaconjournal.com. Read more about the Browns at www.beaconjournal.com/sports/browns.

                "content": "National Football League (1970–present) The Miami Dolphins are a professional American football team based in the Miami metropolitan area. The Dolphins compete in the National Football League (NFL) as a member of the American Football Conference (AFC) East division. The team plays its home games at Hard Rock Stadium in Miami Gardens, Florida, a northern suburb of Miami. The team is owned by Stephen M. Ross. The Dolphins are the oldest professional sports team in Florida. Of the four AFC East teams, the Dolphins are the only team in the division that was not a charter member of the American Football League (AFL). The Dolphins were also one of the first professional football teams in the southeast, along with the Atlanta Falcons. The Dolphins were founded by Joe Robbie, an attorney and politician, and Danny Thomas, an actor and comedian. They began play in the AFL in 1966. The region had not had a professional football team since the days of the Miami Seahawks, who played in the All-America Football Conference in 1946, before becoming the first incarnation of the Baltimore Colts. For the first few years, the Dolphins' full-time training camp and practice facilities were at Saint Andrew's School, a private, boys boarding prep school in Boca Raton. Miami joined the NFL as a result of the 1970 AFL–NFL merger. The team played in its first Super Bowl in Super Bowl VI, losing to the Dallas Cowboys, 24–3. The following year, the Dolphins completed the NFL's only perfect season, culminating in a Super Bowl win, winning all 14 of their regular-season games, and all three of their playoff games, including Super Bowl VII. They were the third NFL team to accomplish a perfect regular season, and remain the only team to do so including playoffs since the AFL-NFL merger, the time known as the Super Bowl era. The next year, the Dolphins won Super Bowl VIII, becoming the first team to appear in three consecutive Super Bowls, and the second team (the first AFL/AFC team) to win back-to-back championships. Miami also appeared in Super Bowl XVII and Super Bowl XIX, losing both games. For most of their early history, the Dolphins were coached by Don Shula, the most successful head coach in professional football history in terms of total games won. Under Shula, the Dolphins posted losing records in only two of his 26 seasons as the head coach. During the period spanning 1983 to the end of 1999, quarterback Dan Marino became one of the most prolific passers in NFL history, breaking numerous league passing records. Marino led the Dolphins to five division titles, 10 playoff appearances, and an appearance in Super Bowl XIX before retiring following the 1999 season. Since Marino's retirement, they have experienced mediocre levels of success and have just six playoff appearances (2000, 2001, 2008, 2016, 2022, and 2023) and two division titles (2000 and 2008) with one playoff win. They currently have the longest postseason win drought in the NFL. The Miami Dolphins joined the American Football League (AFL) when an expansion franchise was awarded to lawyer Joseph Robbie and actor Danny Thomas in 1965 for $7.5 million, although Thomas would eventually sell his stake in the team to Robbie.[10] During the summer of 1966, the Dolphins' training camp was in St. Pete Beach with practices in August at Boca Ciega High School in Gulfport.[11] The Dolphins were the worst team with a 15–39–2 record in their first four seasons under head coach George Wilson, before Don Shula was hired as head coach.[12][13][14][15][16][17] Shula was a Paul Brown disciple who had been lured from the Baltimore Colts, after losing Super Bowl III two seasons earlier to the AFL's New York Jets, and finishing 8–5–1 the following season.[18][19] Shula got his first NFL coaching job from then-Detroit head coach George Wilson, who hired him as the defensive coordinator. The AFL merged with the NFL in 1970, and the Dolphins were assigned to the AFC East division in the NFL's new American Football Conference.[20] For the rest of the 20th century, the Shula-led Dolphins emerged as one of the most dominant teams in the NFL, with only two losing seasons between 1970 and 1999.[21] They were extremely successful in the 1970s, completing the first complete perfect season in NFL history by finishing with a 14–0 regular-season record in 1972 and winning the Super Bowl that year.[22] It was the first of two consecutive Super Bowl wins and one of three appearances in a row.[23][24][25][26] The 1980s and 1990s were also moderately successful. The early 80s teams made two Super Bowls despite losing both times and saw the emergence of future Hall of Fame quarterback Dan Marino, who went on to break numerous NFL passing records, holding many of them until the late 2000s.[27][28][29] After winning every game against the division rival Buffalo Bills in the 1970s, the two teams gradually developed a competitive rivalry in the 80s and 90s, often competing for AFC supremacy when Jim Kelly emerged as the quarterback for the Bills.[30] The Dolphins have also maintained a strong rivalry with the New York Jets throughout much of their history.[31] Following the retirements of Marino and Shula and the rise of Tom Brady and the New England Patriots, the Dolphins suffered a decline in the 2000s and 2010s.[32] During this period, the team's level of play was largely described as mediocre.[33][34][35] They have only made the playoffs four times since Marino's retirement and have largely been unable to find a consistent quarterback to replace him. Jimmy Johnson was hired to replace Shula prior to the 1996 season.[36] In his first season at the helm, he led the team to a 8–8 record and missed the postseason.[37] In the 1997, the team improved to a 9–7 mark and made the postseason.[38] The team saw their season end in the Wild Card Round with a 17–3 loss to the New England Patriots.[39] In the 1998 season, the team went 10–6 and made the postseason.[40] The Dolphins defeated the Bills 24–17 in the Wild Card Round before falling to the Denver Broncos 38–3 in the Divisional Round.[41][42] In the 1999 season, the Dolphins went 9–7 and made the postseason.[43] The team defeated the Buffalo Bills 24–17 in the Wild Card Round before falling 62–7 to the Jacksonville Jaguars in what would be quarterback Dan Marino's final game.[44][45] Johnson resigned following the season.[46] Going into the 2000 season, the Dolphins named Dave Wannstedt as head coach.[47] In his first season with the Dolphins, he led the team to a 11–5 record and an AFC East title.[48] The team defeated the Indianapolis Colts 23–17 in the Wild Card Round before losing 27–0 to the Oakland Raiders in the Divisional Round.[49][50] In the 2001 season, the team made the postseason with a 11–5 record and runner-up placement in the AFC East.[51] The team lost to the Baltimore Ravens 20–3 in the Wild Card Round.[52] In the 2002 season, the team failed to make the postseason despite a 9–7 record.[53] In the 2003 season, the team went 10–6 but missed the postseason.[54] Following a 1–8 start in the 2004 season, Wannstedt resigned.[55] Jim Bates finished out the year with a 3–4 mark.[56] Nick Saban coached the Dolphins in the 2005 and 2006 seasons. He went 9–7 and 6–10 in those two seasons, missing the playoffs in both.[57][58] Saban resigned following the 2006 season to leave for the University of Alabama.[59] Prior to the 2007 season, the Dolphins hired Cam Cameron has head coach.[60] The team suffered a franchise-worst 1–15 season in 2007.[61] After the 2007 season, the team fired Cameron.[62] Tony Sparano was named head coach of the Dolphins prior to the 2008 season.[63] In his first season, he led the team to an 11–5 result and an AFC East title.[64] During the season, they became the second team to make a 10-game improvement over the previous season.[65] That same season, the Dolphins upset the New England Patriots on the road during Week 3 thanks to the use of the gimmick Wildcat offense, which handed the Patriots their first regular-season loss since December 10, 2006, in which coincidentally, they were also beaten by the Dolphins. However, this success in 2008 proved to be an outlier during this period in the franchise's history; to date, it is the last season the Dolphins won the AFC East.[66] The team's season ended with a 27–9 loss to the Baltimore Ravens in the Wild Card Round.[67] The 2009 and 2010 seasons saw regression with a 7–9 record in both years.[68][69] After a 4–9 start to the 2011 season, Sparano was fired.[70] Todd Bowles finished the 6–10 season as interim coach.[71] Prior to the 2012 season, the team hired Joe Philbin as head coach.[72] In his first season at the helm, Philbin led the team to a 7–9 record.[73] In the 2013, the team improved to a 8–8 record but still missed the postseason.[74] In the 2014 season, the team added Bill Lazor as offensive coordinator. The Dolphins once again finished 8–8.[75] After a 1–3 start to the 2015 season, Philbin was fired.[76] Dan Campbell was named as interim coach and finished the year with a 5–7 mark.[77] Prior to the 2016 season, the team hired Adam Gase as head coach.[78] He led the team to a 10–6 record and a postseason berth in the 2016 season.[79] The team's season ended with a 30–12 loss to the Pittsburgh Steelers in the Wild Card Round.[80] In the 2017 season, the Dolphins regressed to a 6–10 record.[81] In the 2018 season, the Dolphins finished with a 7–9 record.[82] After a cumulative 23–25 record, Gase was fired by the Dolphins.[83][84] Prior to the 2019 season, the Dolphins hired Brian Flores as head coach.[85] He led the team to a 5–11 record in the 2019 season.[86] The team drafted Alabama quarterback Tua Tagovailoa in the first round of the 2020 NFL Draft.[87] In the 2020 season, the team improved to a 10–6 mark but still missed the postseason.[88] In the 2021 season, the team went 9–8 but missed the postseason.[89] Following the end of the 2021 season, Flores was fired as head coach.[90] Prior to the 2022 season, Mike McDaniel was hired as head coach.[91] In his first season, he led the Dolphins to a 9–8 record and a 34–31 loss to the Bills in the Wild Card Round.[92][93] In the 2023 season, the team improved to a 11–6 mark but the season again ended in the Wild Card Round with a 26–7 loss to the Kansas City Chiefs.[94][95] The Dolphins dominated the New England Patriots during the 1970s and the 1990s, but there were some notable moments as well, including a 1982 game now known as the Snowplow Game.[96] Fortunes changed when Tom Brady became the franchise quarterback for the Patriots, and during his tenure with the Patriots, New England dominated the AFC, especially the AFC East, winning 16 of 17 division titles between 2003 and 2019, with the Dolphins winning the only non-Patriots division title in that time frame when Brady was out due to injury. Miami posed the biggest divisional challenge to the Brady-led Patriots, however, winning more games against them than the Bills or Jets did during that era.[97][98] Notable wins over New England by the Dolphins include the Miracle in Miami, which involved a dramatic last-minute game-winning touchdown that paralleled \"The Night that Courage Wore Orange\", where in 2004, the Dolphins, at 2–11, upset the defending Super Bowl champion Patriots 28–29, and handed them the second of their 2 losses that season.[99] The rivalry briefly intensified in 2005 when Nick Saban, Bill Belichick's former Browns defensive coordinator was hired as their new head coach and when Saban nearly signed quarterback Drew Brees, as well as in 2008, when the two teams battled for the AFC East division title. Miami and New England are also the only two franchises to have posted undefeated regular-season records since the NFL-AFL merger, with Miami going 14–0 in 1972 and New England going 16–0 in 2007, but only the 1972 Dolphins were able to win the Super Bowl. As of the 2023 season, the Dolphins lead the all-time series 62–55.[100] The Dolphins and the Buffalo Bills have a long-standing rivalry, as there are stark characteristic differences between the cities of Miami and Buffalo, especially in climate and culture. The rivalry was extremely lopsided in favor of Miami during the 1970s, as the Dolphins won all 20 games against the Bills during that decade. Fortunes changed in the 1980s and 1990s when Jim Kelly became the Bills' starting quarterback. Though both teams were extremely dominant during that period, the Bills ultimately held the edge and dominated the Dolphins during their four playoff matchups in the 1990s, with the Dolphins' only playoff win coming after Kelly's retirement. With the rise of Tom Brady and the Patriots during the 2000s and the retirements of Kelly and Dolphins quarterback Dan Marino, the Bills-Dolphins rivalry faded in relevance, but remains somewhat intense to this day. Some former Dolphins have gone to play for the Bills as well, most notably Dan Carpenter, Chris Hogan, and Charles Clay. In the 2020s, the rivalry sharpened, with Dolphins quarterback Tua Tagovailoa, drafted in 2020, leading a resurgent Dolphins team against the Josh Allen-led Bills, who had gained a streak of success after Brady's departure from the Patriots and the division. Though Allen's career record against Miami currently stands at 11–2, Tagovailoa led the Dolphins to their first win over Bills in 8 games in 2022, and the Dolphins played the Bills tightly in the teams' two other meetings that year despite losing both, including the playoffs. As of the 2023 season, the Dolphins lead the all-time series 62–58–1.[101] The New York Jets are perhaps Miami's most bitter rivals.[102] Dolphins fans despise the Jets due to the sheer amount of New York City transplants who have moved to South Florida and the Jets' misplaced cocky demeanor. Just as the Bills-Dolphins rivalry is motivated by differences, the Dolphins-Jets series is also notable for the differences between New York and Miami. Unlike the former, this rivalry has been more consistent over the years. Some of the more memorable moments in this rivalry include Dan Marino's fake spike, Vinny Testaverde leading the Jets to a notable comeback on Monday Night Football, and former Jets quarterback Chad Pennington signing with the Dolphins and leading them to a divisional title. The two teams have also played in the 1982 AFC Championship, with Miami winning to face the Washington Redskins in Super Bowl XVII. As of the 2023 season, the Dolphins lead the all-time series 60–56–1.[103] The Dolphins have played in a minor rivalry with the Baltimore Ravens. The Ravens lead 11-8 all time in the rivalry including the playoffs. The Dolphins have taken part in a minor rivalry with the Jacksonville Jaguars as both teams are the only two AFC franchises located in Florida.[104][105] The two teams first met during the 1998 NFL season on a Monday Night Football matchup.[106] Both teams later met in the 1999 AFC Divisional Round in what would ultimately be the final career game for Dolphins' hall-of-fame quarterback Dan Marino. The Dolphins entered the game as heavy underdogs as they had finished the 1999 season 9–7, securing the lowest wild card berth. Meanwhile; the Jaguars had boasted an impressive 14–2 campaign under pro-bowl quarterback Mark Brunell; culminating in the Jaguars destroying Miami in a 62–7 blowout loss.[45] The Jaguars managed an improbable upset victory during the 2021 Season as the team had declined severely under controversial head coach Urban Meyer. Despite this; the Jaguars managed a comeback victory against the Dolphins in London during week 6.[107] The teams are tied 5–5 all time, though the Jaguars lead 1–0 in the postseason.[108] When the then-Baltimore Colts were inserted into the AFC East following the AFL/NFL merger, they sparked a heated rivalry with the Dolphins, as a controversy involving the hiring of former Colts coach Don Shula forced Miami to forfeit a first-round draft pick. The Dolphins and Colts faced off several times in the AFC playoffs during the 1970s, including the AFC championship game leading up to Super Bowl VI, which the Dolphins lost to the Dallas Cowboys. The rivalry cooled down in the 1980s after the Colts struggled and moved to Indianapolis, but heated up once again in the late 90s until the Colts were reassigned into the AFC South as a result of the 2002 realignment of the NFL's divisions.[104] As of 2023, the Dolphins lead the all-time series 48–28.[109] Since the founding of the Tampa Bay Buccaneers in 1976, the Dolphins and Buccaneers have shared a mellow in-state rivalry and were the only two teams in Florida until the Jacksonville Jaguars joined the NFL in 1995. As of the 2023 season, the Buccaneers lead the all-time series 7–5.[110] The Dolphins won a notable pair of games against the Kansas City Chiefs, defeating them in \"The Longest Game\", the final game in Municipal Stadium,[111] and then the first regular season game at Arrowhead Stadium in 1972.[112] As of the 2023 season, the Chiefs lead the all-time series 17–16.[113] The Dolphins also share historic rivalries with other AFC teams such as the Las Vegas Raiders, Los Angeles Chargers, and Pittsburgh Steelers, stemming from often competing against these teams in the playoffs during the Don Shula era. As of the 2023 season, the Raiders lead the all-time series 21–20–1.[114] The Dolphins originally played all home games in the Orange Bowl in Miami. They moved to the new Joe Robbie Stadium after the 1986 season. From 1993 to 2011, the Dolphins shared the stadium with Major League Baseball's Florida Marlins (now known as the Miami Marlins). The venue has had multiple naming rights deals since 1996, carrying the names Pro Player Stadium, Dolphins Stadium, Dolphin Stadium, LandShark Stadium, Sun Life Stadium, New Miami Stadium and, as of August 2016, Hard Rock Stadium. The facility is located in Miami Gardens, a suburb of Miami located approximately 15 miles (24 km) north of downtown Miami. The Miami Dolphins share Hard Rock Stadium with the NCAA Miami Hurricanes. The 2015–2016 season was the first season in the newly renovated Hard Rock Stadium. The Dolphins spent more than two years and over $400 million on a major overhaul to Hard Rock Stadium. Every seat was replaced and the lower-level seats were moved closer to the field. There are roughly 10,000 fewer seats.[115] St. Petersburg Beach hosted the Dolphins' first training camp in 1966. St. Andrew's School in Boca Raton hosted training camp in the late 1960s. The Dolphins subsequently trained in Miami Gardens at Biscayne College, later renamed St. Thomas University, from 1970 until 1993. In 1993, the Dolphins opened the Miami Dolphins Training Facility at Nova Southeastern University in Davie. In 2006, the facility added a domed field that allows the team to practice during thunderstorms which are common in the area during the summer.[116] In 2021, the Dolphins opened a new, 135 million training facility, dubbed the Baptist Health Training Complex, the Dolphins will practice in. The complex is located next to Hard Rock Stadium in Miami Gardens.[117] The Dolphins logo and uniforms remained fairly consistent from the team's founding through 2012. The team's colors were originally aqua and coral, with the coral color paying tribute to the Miami Seahawks and to the many natural coral reefs in Biscayne Bay. The team's original logo consisted of a sunburst with a leaping dolphin wearing a football helmet bearing the letter M. At their debut in 1966, a lighter & brighter orange was used instead of the deep coral color. The dolphin's head was near the center of the sunburst. In the 1967 season, the dolphin was centered on the sunburst, but it reverted to the original placement between 1968 and 1973. By 1974, the dolphin's body was centered on the sunburst in a slightly smaller logo than the 1967 version. The uniforms featured white pants with aqua and orange stripes, paired with either a white or aqua jersey. On the white jersey, aqua block numbers and names were outlined in orange, with aqua and orange sleeve stripes. Starting with the 1972 perfect season, these uniforms were used as the primary uniforms for road games and daytime home games, due to the extreme heat of South Florida. The team also had an aqua jersey used mainly for night home games or road games in which the opponent chose to wear white. The aqua jersey featured white block numbers and names with an orange outline, and orange and white sleeve stripes. An update was given to the logo in 1997 – the sunburst was simplified and the dolphin was darkened and given a more serious game-face expression.[118] The uniforms remained the same; however, a different block number font was used and navy drop shadows were added. On very rare occasions, an orange jersey was used for primetime games. The uniforms essentially swapped the location of orange and aqua from the aqua jersey. The orange jersey was first used on a Sunday night in 2003 against Washington, a Dolphin win. In 2004, the orange jersey was brought back for an Monday Night Football match pitting the 2–11 Dolphins against the 12–1 defending champion New England Patriots. The Dolphins scored a huge upset win after trailing by 11 points with less than 5 minutes remaining. Due to the unusual orange jerseys, the game has become known within some Dolphin circles as \"The Night That Courage Wore Orange\".[119] The orange jerseys were used for a 2009 Monday night win against the New York Jets. However, the Dolphins would lose a 2010 Sunday night matchup with the Jets, their first loss in orange, and the orange jerseys in the original style would not be worn again. In 2009, the Dolphins switched to black shoes for the first time since the early 1970s glory days, following a recent trend among NFL teams. However, by 2011, they returned to wearing white shoes. The Dolphins' final game in the original style uniforms with block numbers and the iconic leaping dolphin logo was the final game of the 2012 season, a 28–0 shutout loss to the New England Patriots in Foxboro. The white jerseys were worn for the game, and as rumors of a new look had been swirling, many fans watching knew that it would likely be the last time their team would wear the leaping dolphin logo. A new logo and new uniforms were unveiled shortly before the 2013 NFL draft.[120][121][122] The new logo features a stylized aqua dolphin swimming in front of a heavily modified version of the orange sunburst. The dolphin in the logo is more vague and artistic, and is not wearing a helmet as it is merely a silhouette of a dolphin cast in aqua and navy. Navy was incorporated as featured color for the first time, with orange becoming greatly de-emphasized. The uniforms feature both white pants and aqua pants, with a white or aqua jersey. The Dolphins continue to wear white at home, just as they had with the previous uniforms, with aqua being used for primetime home games. The white jersey features aqua numbers and names in a unique custom font, with orange and navy outlines on the numbers; however, the names only use navy as an outline color. The aqua jerseys use white numbers with an orange and aqua outline, and white names with a navy outline. The helmets are white with a white facemask, just like the final years of the previous look; however, navy is a prominent color on the helmet stripe, joining aqua and a de-emphasized orange. Both jerseys have large \"Dolphins\" text above the numbers, written in the team's new script. The pants are either aqua or white, and contain no markings other than a small team wordmark.[123] In 2018, the team made some slight modifications to the logo and uniform set: The shades of orange and aqua were tweaked, and navy blue was removed from the color scheme, only remaining on the logo.[124] In 2015, the Dolphins brought back their 1970s aqua uniforms for a few select games. Four years later, they brought back a white version from the same era as a second alternate uniform. The aqua throwbacks were worn during the now-famous 2018 Miracle in Miami play against the Patriots. On September 29, 2016, the Dolphins debuted their new Color Rush uniform in a Thursday Night Football game against the Cincinnati Bengals. The all-orange uniform marked the first time since 2010 that the Dolphins wore an orange uniform. However, the set was only used for that game as the Dolphins immediately retired the uniform soon after. In later years, the Dolphins wore similar all-aqua or all-white uniforms in select games as the NFL gradually relaxed its rules regarding hosiery. The song was written and composed by Lee Ofman, and has similar instrumentation and lyrics to the fight song of the Houston Oilers. Ofman approached the Dolphins with it before the 1972 season because he wanted music to inspire his favorite team. The fight song would soon serve as a good luck charm for the Dolphins that season. The Dolphins became the first team in NFL history to record an undefeated season, going 17–0 en route to victory over the Washington Redskins in Super Bowl VII. The following season, Miami posted an equally impressive 15–2 record and capped the season with another title, defeating the Minnesota Vikings in Super Bowl VIII. The back-to-back championship runs, coupled with the popularity of the fight song amongst Dolphins fans, have ensured the song's longevity. The Dolphins revealed a new fight song by T-Pain and Jimmy Buffett featuring Pitbull on August 7, 2009, which was introduced for the 2009 NFL season.[125] The fight song was played during the preseason home opener against the Jacksonville Jaguars on August 17, 2009, but was not played during the second preseason game against the Carolina Panthers on August 22, 2009, after being booed heavily in the first game. Furthermore, the team has preferred to play Buffett's song \"Fins\" after scores during the 2009 regular season instead of the traditional fight song. The team's cheerleaders are known collectively as the Miami Dolphins Cheerleaders.[126] The company had its debut in 1978 as the Dolphins Starbrites. (The name referred to the co-sponsor, Starbrite Car Polish.) The cheerleaders' founding choreographer was June Taylor, famed colleague of Jackie Gleason, who led the squad until her retirement in 1990. In April 2010, the Dolphins started the first Volunteer Program in the NFL. Special Teams is a unique volunteer organization created to enlist and mobilize the ongoing services of the community with the Dolphins staff, players and alumni. The mission of the Special Teams is to offer hands-on services to communities and families in need, to partner with existing organizations on worthwhile social, civic and charitable programs, to provide assistance at Miami Dolphins Foundation events, and to support community efforts in times of emergency. This program is headed by Leslie Nixon and Sergio Xiques. Since its inception, Special Teams has given over 250,000 community services hours to the South Florida and Mexico community.[127] (\"The Dolphin\") On Friday, April 18, 1997, the first \"official\" mascot of the Miami Dolphins was introduced. The 7-foot mascot made his public debut on April 19 at Pro Player Stadium during the team's draft-day party. The team then made a \"Name the Mascot\" contest that drew over 13,000 entries covering all 50 states and 22 countries. 529 names were suggested. The winning entry was announced at the annual Dolphins Awards Banquet on June 4, 1997. Denny Sym cheered on the Miami Dolphins for 33 years as a one-man sideline show, leading Miami crowds in cheers and chants in his glittering coral (orange) and aqua hat from the Dolphins' first game in 1966 until 2000. Sym died on March 18, 2007. He was 72.[128] From 1966 to 1968, and in the 1970s a live dolphin was situated in a water tank in the open (east) end of the Orange Bowl.[129] He would jump in the tank to celebrate touchdowns and field goals. The tank that was set up in the 1970s was manufactured by Evan Bush and maintained during the games by Evan Bush and Dene Whitaker. Flipper was removed from the Orange Bowl after 1968 to save costs, and in the 1970s due to stress. In August 2010, the team launched its own regional TV network to carry preseason games and in-season content such as coach and player shows. The Dolphins Television Network comprises 10 South Florida TV stations that agreed to carry the team-produced coverage.[130] Preseason games are broadcast on television through CBS-owned WFOR-TV in Miami-Dade and Broward counties, WTVX in West Palm Beach, WBBH-TV in Fort Myers, and WRDQ in Orlando. Longtime TV and radio personality Dick Stockton provides play-by-play commentary, with Dolphins Hall-of-Fame QB Bob Griese and former Dolphins WR Nat Moore providing color commentary. The radio broadcast team features Jimmy Cefalo providing play-by-play commentary and Joe Rose providing color commentary during preseason games, along with Griese for regular-season games.[131] Griese replaced longtime color commentator Jim Mandich after his death in 2011, who played for the Dolphins under Don Shula. Radio coverage as of the 2023 season is carried WINZ (940 AM) and WBGG-FM (105.9 FM). Additionally, games can also be heard in Spanish on WNMA (1210 AM), with Raúl Striker Jr. and Joaquin Duro providing play-by-play and color commentary, respectively. CBS-owned WFOR, in addition to preseason telecasts, airs most of the Dolphins' regular season games and Thursday Night Football, with rare home games moved or delayed by hurricanes carried by sister station WBFS-TV due to network conflicts, and some games carried by WSVN when flexed to Fox. When playing on Sunday night, the team's matches will be broadcast on NBC's WTVJ.

In 2015, to commemorate the Miami Dolphins' 50th NFL season, the Dolphins organization announced through voting from the South Florida Media and Miami Dolphin fans the results of the 50 greatest players in Miami Dolphins franchise history. The results were announced during halftime on Monday Night Football between the Dolphins and the Giants. Here are the 50 greatest Dolphins broken down by position.

                "content": "Senior Editor MINNEAPOLIS — One, two three. Four. Five! Sam Darnold threw a career-high five touchdown passes, finding Jordan Addison (for three scores) and Justin Jefferson (for two), as well as multiple explosive plays in a 42-21 Vikings victory Sunday over the Atlanta Falcons. Darnold also set new career highs in passing yards (347) and passer rating (157.9) in a game, and although an NFL max passer rating is 158.3, it's hard to imagine anyone playing better than Darnold did. He completed 22 of 28 passes and withstood seven hits, four sacks and multiple other pressures caused by the Falcons (6-7). Addison finished with 133 yards and three touchdowns on eight receptions. He also drew a 47-yard pass interference penalty in the first half. Jefferson posted 132 yards and two scores — his first two trips to the paint since Week 7, helping Minnesota improve to 11-2 on the season. View game action photos from the Vikings vs. Falcons matchup in Week 14 at U.S. Bank Stadium. The Vikings aerial attack flew high against a Falcons squad led by former Minnesota QB Kirk Cousins (2018-23), who visited U.S. Bank Stadium for the first time since signing with Atlanta in the offseason. Attendance for the game was announced at 67,008, which is the second-largest for a Vikings game at the venue that opened in 2016. The only game with more in attendance was the 2019 Border Battle, so intrigue was high with the matchup. Cousins opened the game 4-of-5 passing with the only incompletion a drop on his first attempt. He followed with completions of 28 yards to Darnell Mooney on third-and-8 and 16 to Drake London on second-and-15. With goal-to-go, the Falcons kept it on the ground, and Tyler Allgeier rumbled for a 6-yard touchdown. Cousins finished 23-of-37 passing for 344 yards with no touchdowns, two interceptions and a passer rating of 70.1. Darnold's first pass of the day was batted at the line of scrimmage, but he followed with a 16-yard strike to Jordan Addison on third-and-5. Minnesota's first possession, however, was upended after the Vikings advanced to the Falcons 37-yard line. Darnold was sacked by Eddie Goldman and Arnold Ebiketie on consecutive plays. But as he's shown multiple times, he bounced back, and so did the Vikings through a couple of rough patches to seize control in the fourth quarter. Here are four more observations presented by Minnesota Eye Consultants, the Proud LASIK Partner of the Minnesota Vikings, followed by a scoring summary: 1. Metellus & Murphy also catch footballs Joshua Metellus was able to record his fourth career interception and second of 2024. Metellus stepped in front of a pass intended for London early in the second quarter shortly after Minnesota tied the gam at 7 on a 49-yard touchdown to Addison. Although the ensuing drive resulted in a punt, the pick was helpful in swaying momentum for an early surge. Byron Murphy, Jr., continued showing his spectacular hands so good that he only needed one to spear a pass by Cousins just shy of the end zone. It protected a 35-21 lead with 6:26 remaining in the game. It was the sixth pick of the season for Murphy. 2. Special teams offers biggest swing The Vikings scored early in the fourth quarter on an 11-yard touchdown from Darnold to Addison to make it 28-21 with 12:59 remaining. Atlanta returned and fumbled the ensuing kickoff. Brian Asamoah II hit Ray-Ray McCloud III after a 31-yard takeback (the only one attempted by the Falcons), and C.J. Ham, who was recognized during the game as the Vikings nominee for the 2024 Walter Payton NFL Man of the Year Award, pounded on the football at the Atlanta 32. Minnesota's lead surged to 35-21 seven plays later with another touchdown to Addison. View pregame photos as the Vikings get set for the Week 14 matchup against the Falcons at U.S. Bank Stadium. 3. On the ground game The Vikings built their lead by throwing the ball and closed out the victory by running it. Minnesota drove 98 yards for its final touchdown, which included a 25-yard run by Cam Akers and finished with a 15-yard rushing touchdown by Aaron Jones, Sr. Jones led Minnesota with 73 rushing yards on 13 carries, and Akers added 37 on five. Atlanta showed its strength in the run game with Bijan Robinson rushing 22 times for 92 yards and Allgeier adding 63 yards on nine rushes. Each scored a touchdown. 4. Reichard returns Vikings kicker Will Reichard (and long snapper Andrew DePaola) returned from Injured Reserve because of injuries that each suffered against Indianapolis. Reichard went 6-for-6 on extra points, but his lone field goal try of the day hit the left upright. The kick was from 47. © 2023 Minnesota Vikings Football, LLC , All Rights Reserved.",

                "content": "Falcons Digital Team Reporter MINNEAPOLIS —All the storylines surrounding the Week 14 game between the Atlanta Falcons and Minnesota Vikings came to a close Sunday at U.S. Bank Stadium, but it wasn't the ending the visiting team needed. Final score: 42-21 Why it's important: The Falcons now drop below the 0.500 mark with a 6-7 record, and their current slide extends to four games. Since the Tampa Bay Buccaneers also won Sunday, defeating the Las Vegas Raiders, the Falcons are no longer in the NFC South lead. The Buccaneers' 7-6 record puts them in sole possession of first place entering Week 15. Key takeaway: Turnovers really ruined any chance of the Falcons beating the Vikings. More: The Falcons had three turnovers – one fumble and two interceptions — all in timely moments. The first pick came as the score was tied, preventing the Falcons from pulling ahead. The fumble led to a Vikings' touchdown that put the home team up by two scores. And the second pick set up another Vikings touchdown. Minnesota cashed in 14 points on three turnovers. Key moment: The Falcons fumbled away the opportunity to answer a Vikings' touchdown. More: The Vikings took a 28-21 lead early in the fourth quarter with an 11-yard touchdown pass from quarterback Sam Darnold to wide receiver Justin Jefferson. On the following kickoff, Falcons wide receiver Ray-Ray McCloud III fumbled the ball after returning it 31 yards. Vikings linebacker Brian Asamoah II was credited with the force and fullback C.J. Ham with the recovery at the Atlanta 32-yard line. The Vikings' offense was then back on the field and compiled a seven-play scoring drive. Darnold completed a 6-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Jordan Addison, putting the Vikings ahead by two scores. Of course, the Falcons then got another chance to at least cut into the Vikings' advantage. But Falcons quarterback Kirk Cousins was intercepted during the next drive, diminishing Atlanta's shot at a comeback. Standout performance: The Falcons' defense had four sacks against Vikings quarterback Sam Darnold, proving the unit could essentially repeat its five-sack performance from last week's loss to the Los Angeles Chargers. Sunday's count came from inside linebacker Kaden Elliss, defensive lineman Eddie Goldman, outside linebackers Matthew Judon and Arnold Ebiketie. The Falcons really used the bye in Week 12 to self-scout and improve this area of their defensive performance. Number to know: 0. The number of touchdown passes Falcons quarterback Kirk Cousins threw. For the fourth consecutive game, Cousins failed to find the end zone through the air. This extends his career-long drought. Instead, he threw two interceptions, giving him eight picks in the last four games. A quick tweet: The Falcons editorial staff of Tori McElhaney, Will McFadden, Terrin Waack and Amna Subhan share their gut reactions to Sunday's outcome in 280 characters or less. Settling the storylines: Looking forward: The Falcons have a longer week of preparation ahead since they're scheduled for the Week 15 Monday Night Football game on Dec. 16 at 8:30 p.m. ET. Atlanta will play the Las Vegas Raiders at Allegiant Stadium. Get an inside look at the matchup between the Atlanta Falcons and the Minnesota Vikings at U.S. Bank Stadium during Week 14, presented by Grady.

                "content": "If not listed, please contact your TV provider. MINNEAPOLIS (AP) Sam Darnold tossed aside his stoic demeanor for a moment after realizing he was on the videoboard, aggressively twirling a towel to further stoke the crowd's fire after the Minnesota Vikings had pulled away from Kirk Cousins and the Atlanta Falcons late in the game. “I just felt the buzz. That was pure passion, pure joy, man,” Darnold said. Darnold added yet another highlight to his brilliant first season with the Vikings, passing for 347 yards and five touchdowns, both career highs, in a 42-21 victory over the foundering Falcons on Sunday to stretch their winning streak to six games. “It just felt like it was one of those days to keep the gas pedal down,” said coach Kevin O'Connell, who enjoyed his team's first 40-point game in three seasons on the job. Darnold passed for 250 yards after halftime to help the Vikings (11-2) break a 21-all tie early in the fourth quarter and stay one game behind NFC North-leading Detroit with a final-week matchup looming with the Lions. Jordan Addison had eight catches for 133 yards and three scores and Justin Jefferson racked up seven receptions for 132 yards and two touchdowns after going the past six games without scoring. “This is something that we want to do and we can do every single week,” Jefferson said. Cousins, whose departure in free agency for Atlanta prompted Minnesota to sign Darnold as a bridge to currently injured rookie J.J. McCarthy, threw two more interceptions without a touchdown in this unhappy homecoming following a mixed six-year run with the Vikings. Booed as he took the field, Cousins and the Falcons (6-7) left with a fourth consecutive loss to tumble out of first place in the NFC South and fall one game behind Tampa Bay. “When you’re playing well you usually aren’t as good as people are telling you when they’re patting you on the back, and if you’re in a rut you’re usually not as bad as people kind of leaving you for dead,” Cousins said. “The reality’s usually somewhere in the middle. You just have to keep playing and see where the dust settles in January.” Cousins went 23 for 37 for 344 yards for the Falcons, who crossed midfield on all nine of their possessions and finished with 496 total yards. He overthrew Ray-Ray McCloud III on fourth down in the first quarter, and the Falcons settled for short field goals just before and right after halftime. Their fate was sealed when McCloud fumbled the kickoff at the 32 after the Vikings went 70 yards in six plays for the go-ahead touchdown pass to Addison, who scored again seven plays later. The Falcons handed the Vikings an earlier touchdown when Kentavious Street was called for defensive holding during a field-goal attempt late in the second quarter, giving Darnold a fresh set of downs before a 12-yard laser to Jefferson on a post route on third-and-6. “You just can’t have the self-inflicted wounds and expect to win football games like we had today,” coach Raheem Morris said. Bijan Robinson had 22 carries for 92 yards and a touchdown and Tyler Allgeier rushed nine times for 63 yards and a score for the Falcons against the NFL’s leading run defense. Cousins, who was picked off four times last week, hesitated as he wound up to throw on first down from the Minnesota 47 in a tie game early in the second quarter and then inexplicably fired a pass straight to Josh Metellus as he sat in a zone in front of Drake London. Cousins has a NFL -most 15 interceptions. Byron Murphy snagged an overthrow for the second one near the goal line with a 35-21 lead and 6:26 left. Darnold, who went 22 for 28 without a turnover-worthy play despite heavy first-half pressure, then directed a seven-play, 98-yard drive to seal it. “I think we grew up a lot today offensively,” O'Connell said. Addison and Jefferson became the first duo in Vikings history to each have 100-plus receiving yards and two-plus touchdown catches in the same game. Addison also became the first Vikings player with three receiving touchdowns in a game since Stefon Diggs caught three from Cousins in 2019. Murphy has six interceptions this season, the most for the Vikings since Jimmy Hitchcock had seven in 1998. Falcons: CB Mike Hughes (knee) was back in the lineup after missing two games. Minnesota's 2018 first-round draft pick returned an interception for a touchdown against Atlanta in his NFL debut here. Vikings: CB Stephon Gilmore (hamstring) and backup OLB Patrick Jones (knee) were out. TE Josh Oliver (wrist/ankle) returned from a two-game absence, and LS Andrew DePaola (hand) and PK Will Reichard (quadriceps) were back from four-game injured reserve stints. Both teams play next Monday night, Dec. 16: Atlanta visits Las Vegas, and Minnesota hosts Chicago. --- AP NFL: https://apnews.com/hub/NFL Copyright 2024 STATS LLC and Associated Press.

                "title": "Giant - Wikipedia",
                "content": "In folklore, giants (from Ancient Greek: gigas, cognate giga-) are beings of humanoid appearance, but are at times prodigious in size and strength or bear an otherwise notable appearance. The word giant is first attested in 1297 from Robert of Gloucester's chronicle.[1] It is derived from the Gigantes (Ancient Greek: Γίγαντες[2]) of Greek mythology. Fairy tales such as Jack the Giant Killer have formed the modern perception of giants as dimwitted and violent ogres, sometimes said to eat humans, while other giants tend to eat livestock. In more recent portrayals, like those of Jonathan Swift and Roald Dahl, some giants are both intelligent and friendly. Giants appear many times in folklore and myths. Representing the human body enlarged to the point of being monstrous, giants evoke terror and remind humans of their body's frailty and mortality. They are often portrayed as monsters and antagonists, but there are exceptions. Some giants intermingle with humans in a friendly way and can even be part of human families with their offspring being portrayed as regular humans where they are often referred to as half-giants.[3] Folklorists and historians examine the role giants are assigned in regional geomythologies. For example, Fionn mac Cumhaill is said to have built the Giant's Causeway on the island of Ireland.[4] Per a 1965 examination in an American studies journal, \"It is generally admitted today that Paul Bunyan was a synthetic figure conceived by advertising men rather than the spontaneous product of the folk mind, yet he has been adopted by the American people with enthusiasm...Paul and his blue ox Babe are supposed to have altered the appearance of the American continent; the animal's hoof prints became the lake beds of the Northwest and from its drinking trough spilled the Mississippi River.\"[5] Fossilized remains of ancient mammals and reptiles common to the Sivalik Hills of India may have influenced aspects of the Mahābhārata that tell of battles in which \"hundreds of mighty, and sometimes gigantic, heroes, horses, and war elephants are said to have died.\"[6] Claudine Cohen, in her 2002 book The Fate of the Mammoth, argued that the history of human interaction with fossil bones of prehistoric megafauna was heavily influenced by giant lore.[7] Per Cohen, the proto-scientific study of giants appears in several phases of human history: Herotodus reported that the remains of Orestes were found in Tegea; Pliny described a giant's skeleton found in Crete after an earthquake, and seemed to refer to evolution as the process by which giants become human-size over time; and Saint Augustine mentions what is believed to have been the fossilized molar of an ancient Elephantidae in his City of God, in a passage reflecting on the nature and meaning of the Noahacian deluge.[7] The academic consideration of giants continued through the Middle Ages, Renaissance, and even the early modern period. Boccaccio devoted a passage of his Genealogies of the Pagan Gods to purported archeological discoveries in Sicily that he thought might be evidence of the historicity of The Odyssey's Polyphemus.[7] Rabelais created a wholly \"fabricated giantology\" for his 16th-century Gargantua and Pantagruel.[8] Massive bones found in 1613 in France were initially assigned to Teutobochus but the examinations of them by various physicians and their publication of diverging conclusions about the bones kicked off a \"pamphlet war\" between anatomists and surgeons of the day.[7] The discovery of the so-called Claverack Giant in colonial New York triggered giantological investigations by two important early American intellectuals, Cotton Mather and Edward Taylor.[9] Genesis tells of the Nephilim before and after Noah's Flood. The word Nephilim is loosely translated as giants in some translations of the Hebrew Bible, but left untranslated in others. According to Genesis 7:23, the Nephilim were destroyed in the Flood, but Nephilim are reported after the Flood, including: The Book of Numbers[10] includes the discouraging report by the spies sent by Moses into Canaan: \"We can't attack those people; they are stronger than we are. (...) All the people we saw there are of great size. We saw the Nephilim there (the descendants of Anak come from the Nephilim). We seemed like grasshoppers in our own eyes, and we looked the same to them.\" The Book of Joshua, describing the actual conquest of Canaan in a later generation, makes reference to such people living there in (Joshua 14:12–15 and Joshua 15:13–14). The Bible also tells of Gog and Magog, who later entered European folklore, and of the famous battle between David and the Philistine Goliath. While Goliath is often portrayed as a giant in retellings of the Biblical narrative, he appears to be significantly smaller than other giants, biblical or otherwise. The Masoretic Text version of the Book of Samuel gives his height as six cubits and one span (possibly 313–372 centimetres (10 ft 3 in – 12 ft 2 in)),[15] while the Septuagint, the 1st-century Jewish historian Flavius Josephus and the 2nd–1st-centuries BCE Dead Sea Scrolls give Goliath's height as four cubits and one span (possibly 216–258 centimetres (7 ft 1 in – 8 ft 6 in)).[16] For comparison, the Anakites are described as making the Israelites seem like grasshoppers.[17] See also Gibborim. Josephus also described the Amorites as giants in his Antiquities of the Jews, circa 93 CE, indicating that some sort of fossils may have been on display at that time:[18] \"For which reason they removed their camp to Hebron; and when they had taken it, they slew all the inhabitants. There were till then left the race of giants, who had bodies so large, and countenances so entirely different from other men, that they were surprising to the sight, and terrible to the hearing. The bones of these men are still shown to this very day, unlike to any credible relations of other men.\"[19] The Book of Enoch describes giants as the offspring of Watchers and women in 7:2.[20] Hayk was known as the founder of the Armenian state. Hayk was part of a race of giants who helped construct the Tower of Babel. Ancient historian Movses Khorenatsi wrote, \"Hayk was handsome and personable, with curly hair, sparkling eyes and strong arms. Among the giants he was the bravest and most famous, opponent of all who raised their hand to become absolute ruler over the giants and heroes.\"[21] Mount Nemrut is known to have received its name from an Armenian tradition in which Nimrod was killed by an arrow shot by Hayk during a massive battle between two rival armies of giants to the south-east of Lake Van.[22] Aztec mythology features the Quinametzin, a race of giant men created in one of the previous solar eras. They are credited with the construction of Teotihuacan. Giants are rough but generally righteous characters of formidable strength living in the hills of the Basque Country. Giants stand for the Basque people reluctant to convert to Christianity who decide to stick to the old lifestyle and customs in the forest. Sometimes they hold the secret of ancient techniques and wisdom unknown to the Christians, like in the legend of San Martin Txiki, while their most outstanding feature is their strength. It follows that in many legends all over the Basque territory the giants are held accountable for the creation of many stone formations, hills and ages-old megalithic structures (dolmens, etc.), with similar explanations provided in different spots. However, giants show different variants and forms, they are most frequently referred to as jentilak and mairuak, while as individuals they can be represented as Basajaun (\"the lord of the forests\"), Sanson (variation of the biblical Samson), Errolan (based on the Frankish army general Roland who fell dead at the Battle of Roncevaux Pass) or even Tartalo (a one-eyed giant akin to the Greek Cyclops Polyphemus). In Bulgarian mythology, giants called ispolini inhabited the Earth before modern humans. They lived in the mountains, fed on raw meat and often fought against dragons. Ispolini were afraid of blackberries which posed a danger of making the giants trip and die, so they offered sacrifices to that plant.[23] There are tales of giants in the northern Chilean port town of Caldera telling of giants who play with ships moving them from one port to another.[24] Tales of the same area also tells of giants who are able to crush humans with their feet and when laying down to sleep being so long as to reach from the mountains to the sea.[24] In some stories the giants are black humanoids or black bulls.[24] In southern Chile there are stories of giants said to belong to certain volcanoes such as Calbuco and Osorno.[24] The mythical city of Tololo Pampa in northern Chile is said to be guarded by a giant known by various names including; Pata Larga, Gigante Minero and Minero Gigante.[25] The giant enters to the mountains to obtain riches to the princess of Tololo Pampa.[25] If a person manages to watch the giant while he works folklore says the person will be blessed with good luck for the rest of their life.[25] In Greek mythology, the Gigantes (γίγαντες) were (according to the poet Hesiod) the children of Uranus (Ουρανός) and Gaia (Γαία) (spirits of the sky and the earth) where some depictions had them with snake-like legs. They were involved in a conflict with the Olympian gods called the Gigantomachy (Γιγαντομαχία) when Gaia had them attack Mount Olympus. This battle was eventually settled when the hero Heracles decided to help the Olympians. The Greeks believed some of them, like Enceladus, to lie buried from that time under the earth and that their tormented quivers resulted in earthquakes and volcanic eruptions. Herodotus in Book 1, Chapter 68, describes how the Spartans uncovered in Tegea the body of Orestes, which was seven cubits long ⁠ ⁠— approximately 3.73 m, or about 12 feet 3 inches. In his book The Comparison of Romulus with Theseus, Plutarch describes how the Athenians uncovered the body of Theseus, which was \"of more than ordinary size.\" The kneecaps of Ajax were exactly the size of a discus for the boy's pentathlon, wrote Pausanias. A boy's discus was about 12 cm (4.7 in) in diameter, while a normal adult patella is around 5 cm (2.0 in), suggesting Ajax may have been nearly 14 feet (over 4 m) tall. The Cyclopes are also compared to giants due to their huge size (e.g. Polyphemus, son of Poseidon and Thoosa and nemesis of Odysseus in Homer's The Odyssey). The Elder Cyclopes were the children of Gaia and Uranus, and later made Zeus' \"master thunderbolt\", Poseidon's trident, and Hades' \"helm of darkness\", during the Titanomachy. The Hecatoncheires are giants that have 100 arms and 50 heads who were also the children of Gaia and Uranus. Other known giant races in Greek mythology include the six-armed Gegeines, the northern Hyperboreans, and the cannibalistic Laestrygonians. There are accounts stating humans grew to the size of giants during the Satya Yuga, the first of the four cyclical ages (yugas) in the Hindu reckoning of time.[26] According to Jainism, there was a time when giants walked upon this earth.[27][28] Jain cosmology divides the worldly cycle of time into two parts or half-cycles, avasarpani (age of descending purity) and ascending (utsarpani).[29] According to Jain texts, the height of Rishabhanatha, first tirthankara of the present half-cycle of time (avasarpani) was 500 dhanusa (longbow).[30] In avasarpani, as the cycle moves ahead, height of all humans and animals decreases. The following table depicts the six aras of avasarpini– In Norse mythology, the jötnar (cognate with Old English: eotenas and English: ettin) are often opposed to the gods. While often translated as \"giants\", most are described as being roughly human-sized. Some are portrayed as huge, such as some frost giants (hrímþursar), fire giants (eldjötnar), and mountain giants (bergrisar). The jötnar are the origin of most of various monsters in Norse mythology (e.g. the Fenrisulfr) and in the eventual battle of Ragnarök, the giants will storm Asgard and fight the gods until the world is destroyed. Even so, the gods themselves were related to the jötnar by many marriages and descent; there are also jötnar such as Ægir who have good relationships with the gods and bear little difference in status to them. Odin, often regarded as the chief god, is the great-grandson of the jötunn Ymir. Norse mythology also holds that the entire world of men was created from the flesh of Ymir, a giant of cosmic proportions whose name is considered by some scholars to share a root with Yama of Indo-Iranian mythology. Trolls are beings that are sometimes very large. The name troll is applied to jötnar. An old Icelandic legend says that two night-prowling giants, a man and a woman, were traversing the fjord near Drangey Island with their cow when they were surprised by the bright rays of daybreak. As a result of exposure to daylight, all three were turned into stone. Drangey represents the cow and Kerling (supposedly the female giant, the name means \"old hag\") is to the south of it. Karl (the male giant) was to the north of the island, but he disappeared long ago. A bergrisi – the traditional protector of southwestern Iceland – appears as a supporter on the coat of arms of Iceland. According to Northern Paiute oral history, the Si-Te-Cah or Sai'i are a legendary tribe of red-haired cannibalistic giants, the remains of which were allegedly found in 1911 by guano miners in Nevada's Lovelock Cave.[31] Furthermore, the Paiute creation story tells of \"beautiful giants\" who once lived between the Sierra Nevadas and the Rocky Mountains. After giving birth to a disfigured child, the giants treated the child so poorly that the Great Spirit responded by making the land hot and desolate and allowing enemies to conquer the giants. Only two giants survived: Paiute and his wife, both of whose skin became brown from eternally living in the hot desert.[32] Several Jupiter-Giant-Columns have been found in Germania Superior. These were crowned with a statue of Jupiter, typically on horseback, defeating or trampling down a giant, often depicted as a snake. They are restricted to the area of south-western Germany, western Switzerland, French Jura, and Alsace. In folklore from all over Europe, giants were believed to have built the remains of previous civilizations. The Danish historian Saxo Grammaticus thought giants had a hand in the creation of megalithic monuments. Similarly, the Old English poem The Seafarer speaks of the high stone walls that were the work of giants. Natural geologic features such as the massive basalt columns of the Giant's Causeway on the coast of Northern Ireland were attributed to construction by giants. In the Netherlands, giants are often associated with creating or forming the landscape. For instance, two giants are said to have dug a channel, until they reached the village of Akkrum, where they had an argument and each went his own way, thus splitting the channel into two separate waterways. Others threw up hills, or became hills themselves when they died on the spot. In several legends, giants were evil beings that threatened, robbed and killed travellers or locals; such as Ellert and Brammert, in the province of Drenthe. Medieval chivalry romances such as the Spanish Amadís de Gaula feature giants as antagonists, or, rarely, as allies. This is parodied famously in Cervantes' Don Quixote, when the title character attacks a windmill, believing it to be a giant. This is the source of the phrase tilting at windmills. Tales of combat with giants were a common feature in the folklore of the British Isles. Celtic giants also figure in Breton and Arthurian romances. In Kinloch Rannoch, a local myth has a local hill resembling a giant named as The Sleeping Giant. Folklore says the giant will awaken only if a specific musical instrument is played near the hill. Giants are also prominent in Welsh folklore. Many giants in English folklore were noted for their stupidity.[33] A giant who had quarrelled with the Mayor of Shrewsbury went to bury the city with dirt; however, he met a shoemaker, carrying shoes to repair, and the shoemaker convinced the giant that he had worn out all the shoes coming from Shrewsbury, and so it was too far to travel.[34] Other English stories told of how giants threw stones at each other, which was used to explain many great stones on the landscape.[35] Giants figure in folklore and fairy tales, such as Jack the Giant Killer, The Giant Who Had No Heart in His Body, Nix Nought Nothing, Robin Hood and the Prince of Aragon, Young Ronald, and Paul Bunyan. Ogres are humanoid creatures, sometimes of gigantic stature, that occur in various sorts of European folklore. Rübezahl, is a kind giant from German folklore who lived in the Giant Mountains, along with the Bergmönch, a giant mountain spirit.[36] Antero Vipunen is a giant shaman that appears in the Kalevala, meeting the epic hero Väinämöinen to teach him creation spells.[37]",

ENGL 006 Creative Writing Common Time (1 per semester/maximum of 8) This course is to be required of all B.F.A. in Creative Writing majors at Penn State Erie as long as they are students in that degree program. This means that every semester they are working toward the B.F.A. in Creative Writing they must sign up for this course, and they must complete it successfully. Successful completion is based on regular attendance at the various functions, all held at the same one hour time period each week. The purpose of this course is to provide students with the necessary experience of listening to the writers of national stature brought to campus through The Smith Series, to provide them with lectures by both faculty and outside experts to help them develop professionally as writers, to allow for essential group advising for successful completion of the major, and to foster a sense of community among the student writers in the program. Bachelor of Arts: Humanities Course Description: ENGL 10 is a one-credit course that provides group tutorial instruction in writing for students currently enrolled in ENGL 15. It is not a replacement for composition classes or individual conferences with the ENGL 15 instructor. Rather, ENGL 10 offers the opportunity to learn about and practice writing in a collaborative, group setting and to become an active part of the writing community at Penn State. Throughout ENGL 10, students work directly with texts and assignments from their ENGL 15 course. Enforced Concurrent at Enrollment: ENGL 15 ENGL 15 is an intensive, rhetorically based experience in reading and writing that will prepare you both to understand the communications that surround you and to succeed in your own communication efforts. Thus, in this course, we will focus specifically on analyzing verbal and visual texts (our reading) as well as on producing such texts (our writing), always in terms of rhetorical principles. Even if the term rhetoric isn't familiar to you, you bring a good deal of rhetorical skill to this class: you already know how to gauge the way you perceive and produce language according to the speaker, the intended audience, and the purpose. You may not always gauge perfectly, your perception may not always be accurate, and your production may not always be successful, but you still often try to interpret and choose language that is appropriate to the rhetorical situation. When you do not succeed, you often try again. The goal of ENGL 15, then, is to help you build on what you already know how to do as you become a more confident reader and writer. You will become more attuned to your goals as a writer, more aware of the ongoing conversation surrounding the topic, and more resourceful in terms of the appropriate delivery of your information, the rhetorical appeals at your disposal, and the needs and expectations of your audience. You will also learn to research and synthesize multiple outside sources in order to support your arguments effectively and ethically.

ENGL 88 Australian/New Zealand Cultural Perspectives (3) (GH)(BA) This course meets the Bachelor of Arts degree requirements. Students are expected to learn fundamental skills of close textual analysis in the context of the study of a variety of works by authors from Australia and New Zealand. Studying a range of novels, poems, plays, and works of non-fiction, students will discuss the development of Australian and New Zealander literatures in historical context and gain understanding of the historical development of societal values in nations other than the U.S.A. The course aspires to relate geography and history to emerging social and cultural developments as the state and status of the two countries changed during the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, and to track their increasing separation from the \"Mother Country\"; (i.e. Great Britain) as they developed a sense of themselves as different and separate from European societies. The process was neither comfortable nor easy, nor steadily progressive, but the record of it is an often fascinating story of human endeavor and struggle, very frequently against great odds and disappointments, which in turn affected the development of national character if such a thing can be said to exist.The literatures reflect some of the attitudes and qualities that emerged as the two societies were coming into being and forging their own unique identities.

Bachelor of Arts: Humanities In ENGL 101 students will study a wide variety of forms of literature --- poetry, novel, short story, drama, graphic novels --- from different time periods and cultures to gain a better understanding of how literature explores human values and issues. Throughout the course, students might use the texts to ask such questions as: of what value is a play, a novel, a poem, or a short story? Is literature worthwhile for its ability to tell a good story or for its questions that do not lend themselves to easy answers? Can literature improve our lives, individually and collectively? The course may also take advantage of literary events occurring on campus each semester--such as poetry readings, dramatic performances, even films relating to the course --- to enrich the experience both of literature and of campus life. Bachelor of Arts: Humanities General Education: Humanities (GH) GenEd Learning Objective: Effective Communication GenEd Learning Objective: Crit and Analytical Think GenEd Learning Objective: Key Literacies Fred Lewis Pattee's career at Penn State marks the beginning of a heyday for the study of American literature. By the 1930s, prominent American critic Granville Hicks hailed what he dubbed \"the great tradition of American literature\" as a series of key themes in American writing, including folk traditions, politics, business, labor, social critique, fugitives, and flight. Since Hicks's time, literary scholars have contested the very notion of any \"great tradition,\" because so many different authors have always participated in the American literary scene. This course examines American literature by looking at the dynamic and varied literary productions that, across time, have comprised the American literary canon, even as it calls into question the notion of whether America ever had a single literary canon, whether historically or in the present day. Students will learn how access to educational institutions, to writing equipment, and to printed and graphic materials all influenced who might become an author, and who, a reader. They will also learn how changing political and cultural institutions influenced writers' literary production and literary achievements. With text selection at the instructors' discretion, students will study poetry, fiction, non-fiction, oratory, and drama, and they will examine many of the most enduring themes in American literature: religion; moral and ethical ideals; the lure of mobility, especially upward mobility (or absence of it); gender dynamics; enslavement, abolitionism, and emancipation; race and ethnicity; the lure (and social complications) of the American West; American pragmatism; love and loss; hope and despair. Students will be asked to take up such questions as the following: Who has had a voice in American literary history? Why are some writers more frequently studied than others? Who determined what should be considered \"great\" literature inside the academy? In what ways does the study of American literary history uphold American values of freedom and freedom of expression? Who had access to publication, when, and under what circumstances? How does the publishing marketplace influence readers' choices regarding \"great\" American literature? How do educational institutions influence readers' choices? The course aims to provide a foundation for further study of American literature by equipping students with an understanding of the American literary past and its complex relationship to American culture and to American educational, political, and marketing institutions. Instructors might examine one or two key themes in the tradition, or they might ask students to learn about sweeping literary movements across time. Bachelor of Arts: Humanities United States Cultures (US) General Education: Humanities (GH) GenEd Learning Objective: Crit and Analytical Think GenEd Learning Objective: Key Literacies GenEd Learning Objective: Soc Resp and Ethic Reason This course examines the literature of the Bible. Throughout this course, students will study the language, thought, images, and structures of the book that has arguably proved the central text of Western literature. Students will also actively explore the ways in which the Bible has shaped the literature of English-speaking cultures around the world. Students will read substantial portions of the Old and New Testaments, learning to read critically and to interpret the Bible as they would any other literary text. They will also learn about the historical construction of the Bible, some history of its translation, and contemplate the competing versions of existing Biblical texts. Accordingly, reading the Bible as literature by necessity requires critical engagement with different international cultures from different historical periods.

The course synthesizes a broad scope of materials from areas such as literature, movies, television, sports, amusement parks, music, media, and advertising. While selected topics for readings, lectures, and discussion vary from class to class, all courses focus on a critical examination of a variety of popular and folk cultures in order to produce an enriched understanding of America, its past, its diverse cultures, its evolving values and traditions, and its inhabitants. To meet this goal, popular and folk cultures will be examined from a variety of perspectives, including race, gender, and class. AMST 105 may be taken by students pursuing the American Studies major; for them, the course provides preparation for more advanced courses in American folklore, American literature, and American cultural history. Non-American Studies students may use this course to fulfill the general education requirement (GH). Students will receive the US designation for this course, and it meets the Bachelor of Arts degree requirements.

The Lynd Ward Prize is awarded annually to the best graphic novel, fiction or non-fiction, published in the previous calendar year by a living U.S. or Canadian citizen or resident. The course provides background for the history of the graphic novel in the United States, with a focus on Lynd Ward's woodcut novels from the 1930s. Students also study the winning book, attend the award ceremony and public talk from the creator(s), and meet with the creator(s) to discuss their work. This is a one-credit course with limited meetings. This course focuses on Buddhism in the United States. We will overview the historical factors that led to the development of Buddhism in the U.S., the many traditions that currently exist in the U.S., the role of Buddhism in the daily lives of different types of Americans, and various problems or frameworks that have characterized American Buddhism (such as race, gender, technology, and media representations). One major theme of the course is literary expressions of American Buddhism, such as the writings of Jack Kerouac and bell hooks. A second major theme, Buddhist meditation, will be explored through interdisciplinary perspectives drawing from both the humanities and social sciences. In the final portion of the class, we will focus on Buddhism in Pennsylvania, involving students in an ethnographic exploration of the religious pluralism in our home state.

Bachelor of Arts: Humanities This course familiarizes students with the range of professional possibilities offered by the English major. This course introduces the variety of literature that has been written and published by Pennsylvania authors from the colonial era through the present day. This course explores how the literature written in Pennsylvania relates to historical developments within the Commonwealth, and to literary, cultural, and historical developments across the United States and throughout the world. Toward that end, the course provides a chronological survey of developments in the literature of Pennsylvania through readings from the work of Pennsylvania authors whose work illuminates developments in literary history and exemplifies important aspects of Pennsylvania history and culture.

From popular culture approaches to Norse myths to the ancient tales of Slavic folklore and Celtic Fairy Faith, this course builds understanding of the beliefs and foundational narratives of modern Pagan religion(s). Students will examine some of the stories of Norse, Slavic, Hellenic, Egyptian, and Celtic mythology from a Pagan perspective. Finally, this course will engage students in interpretation and analysis of the literary and religious significance of these stories.

Students will analyze the artistic, philosophical and literary representations of courtship, friendship, homoeroticism, sexuality, marriage, adultery, and familial bonds and explore how the preceding phenomena are inflected by gender roles, race and miscegenation, and class and religious differences. We will also trace the way particular narratives about love have been adapted by different artistic media. Love is a universal human experience and its study transcends disciplinary boundaries. It is a linchpin of human existence, uniting and enriching nearly any subject worthy of serious study.

Course topics can include the connections between poetry, song, and lyric; the presence of music in different kinds of drama; the textual, visual, and performative culture of specific musical traditions (such as opera, punk, hip-hop, and/or metal); ways to appreciate songwriters and performers as both musical and literary artists; and music as a medium for expressing identity and culture, primarily through written and visual texts. General Education: Humanities (GH) GenEd Learning Objective: Effective Communication GenEd Learning Objective: Crit and Analytical Think GenEd Learning Objective: Key Literacies This course explores representations of identity and community in early literature, from classical traditions through the early modern era. How did early literature engage issues of cultural contact, conflict, and/or exchange, such as those created through trade, warfare, religious conflict, migration and/or travel? How did early writers conceive of and represent difference, and to what ideological and/or aesthetic end? Additionally, students will consider how these early representations have influenced later cultural productions and events, from modern politics (nationalism, neo-paganism) to popular entertainments (films, video games, graphic novels). International Cultures (IL) General Education: Humanities (GH) GenEd Learning Objective: Effective Communication GenEd Learning Objective: Crit and Analytical Think GenEd Learning Objective: Global Learning GenEd Learning Objective: Key Literacies This course explores intersections between literature and law, with attention to issues of social justice. How are social concepts and procedures of law and justice represented in different texts and media over time, both fictional and nonfictional? How have texts worked to define and justify the law and its application at different historical moments in the United States? Course content includes select literary works with legal content and themes, and the ways in which those texts represent different forms of justice, crime, and punishment. Students may also analyze legal writing (judicial decisions, jurisprudence, statutes); examples of the 'true crime' genre (visual and textual); memoir; and/or essay writing.

How have literary and popular texts shaped cultural perceptions of agriculture in the United States? How have novels, poetry, drama, and films defined and challenged cultural understanding of the practices, participants, and values (economic, cultural, ethical) of farming? Topics might include representations of the family farm and its significance, concepts of property and cultivation, historical developments in agri-business, and/or the U.S. farm and farmer in the cultural imagination. United States Cultures (US) General Education: Humanities (GH) GenEd Learning Objective: Effective Communication GenEd Learning Objective: Crit and Analytical Think This course explores texts and traditions that were once considered non-literary but are now the object of critical inquiry and/or aesthetic appreciation. In other words, how does trash become literature? Course content includes texts and media once considered to be in bad taste or to have come from disreputable publishers and venues. Other considerations might include aesthetic and commercial issues (genre and series fiction, bestsellers); the presence of polemics and propaganda in fiction; and/or the formation and influence of different processes of critical exclusion and inclusion. General Education: Humanities (GH) GenEd Learning Objective: Effective Communication GenEd Learning Objective: Crit and Analytical Think This class studies how art, literature, film, and other media can help us to gain a perspective on one of the most horrific events in human history, the Holocaust: the genocidal murder of more than six million men, women, and children (mostly Jewish) under the Nazi regime during World War II. We will also examine the theoretical questions involved in any attempt to capture what appears to be beyond our comprehension, in terms of moral outrage and the sheer scale, inhumanity, and bureaucratic efficiency. To this end we will study literary works, such as Primo Levi's Survival in Auschwitz, films such as Steven Spielberg's Schindler's List, Roman Polanski's The Pianist, and Roberto Benigni's Life is Beautiful, as well as photographs, poems, artworks, installations, museum architecture, the design of monuments and other artifacts. We will also examine questions of memorialization (Holocaust museums and memorials), national guilt, survivor's guilt, stigmatization, and the ethics of historical representation.

Bachelor of Arts: Humanities International Cultures (IL) General Education: Humanities (GH) Honors GenEd Learning Objective: Crit and Analytical Think GenEd Learning Objective: Key Literacies READING POPULAR TEXTS explores a variety of popular texts across various media with the goal of enabling students to sharpen their ability to interpret the social, political, and cultural significance of such texts in the contemporary world. Since these texts are primarily examples of popular culture-pervasive, selfreplicating, commercialized artifacts of the contemporary scene-they are familiar to the general student outside the classroom. Too often, however, students have not seen such texts subjected to the same kind of critical readings more elite cultural forms (e.g., canonized literature, art, and music). The purpose of the course is fulfilled if such students come away from it with a sharpened awareness of the role that pupular texts play in their daily lives and the means to discuss and explain their influence-in short, to read their culture more crirically. Bachelor of Arts: Humanities General Education: Humanities (GH) GenEd Learning Objective: Effective Communication GenEd Learning Objective: Crit and Analytical Think GenEd Learning Objective: Key Literacies This course surveys the long tradition of literature that depicts the intrusion of supernatural forces into social order. The fantastic or horrific elements of these tales might be their best-known traits, but such literature can also express social desires and fears, as well as ruminate on personal and political history. The supernatural, in other words, works to reveal those individuals and institutions that face it. This course explores a range of horror writing, investigating issues raised by individual texts and considering possible connections between them. Bachelor of Arts: Humanities General Education: Humanities (GH) GenEd Learning Objective: Effective Communication GenEd Learning Objective: Crit and Analytical Think GenEd Learning Objective: Key Literacies This course will provide an introduction to Jewish American literature through a historical survey of the tradition's key texts, figures, and themes. The course will focus on the defining aspects of the literature and on what the literature \"thinks\" about Jewish American culture and identity. But rather than assuming a unity to Jewish-American culture, this course will use Jewish literature to seek ways of articulating and representing both the points of cohesion and the points of divergence that characterize Jewish life in America. The United States has absorbed large numbers of Jewish immigrants hailing from many parts of the world, holding many different ideas about Jewish practice, and affiliating themselves with many different political, social, and cultural traditions. Moreover, Jews have settled and made homes in a wide variety of American communities. This course aims to explore Jewish American culture's marked diversity by offering a literary window onto the major fault-lines running through Jewish American culture: lines demarcated by gender, by political affiliation, by geography, by pre-immigration community by religious practice, by attitude toward world Jewry, by national allegiance, and by minhag (or custom), to name just a few. The class therefore provides an opportunity to consider the constitution, origin, and development of Jewish American's identity and social formations by looking at how that identity and those social formations exist and what they \"do\" in literature written by and about Jews in America. Materials will consist predominantly of primary texts, including prose fiction and nonfiction, poetry, drama, and film. Course methodology will emphasize the close reading of these texts. The course complements offerings in Jewish Studies and English, and it will satisfy the GH and US requirements. Most obviously, the course will offer students of Jewish literature, world literature, and American literature an opportunity for contextualization. It enables students in Jewish Studies to study the rich literature of American Jews, and it adds to courses covering Jewish American history, religion, and culture. The course offers students in English a valuable, sustained introduction to an important U.S. and world sub-culture.

Bachelor of Arts: Humanities General Education: Humanities (GH) GenEd Learning Objective: Effective Communication GenEd Learning Objective: Crit and Analytical Think Rhetoric and Civic Life (RCL) is a year-long honors course offering comprehensive training in oral, written, visual, and digital communication. It unites these various modes under the flexible art of rhetoric and uses rhetoric both to strengthen communication skills and to sharpen awareness of the challenges and advantages presented by oral, written, visual, and digital modes. This portion of the course, CAS/ENGL 137 focuses particularly on two critical academic capacities: analyzing and contextualizing. In this semester, students learn to rigorously examine the rhetoric surrounding them, compellingly present their findings in various modes, and thoughtfully contextualize their research. In this course, students will: -Develop a rich understanding of rhetorical concepts -Practice application of concepts and terms in expressing understanding of effectiveness of rhetoric through analysis and contextualization of existing texts -Enhance communication skills by practicing and applying in a variety of communication modes (written, oral, digital) Cross-listed with: CAS 137H General Education: Writing/Speaking (GWS) Honors GenEd Learning Objective: Effective Communication GenEd Learning Objective: Creative Thinking GenEd Learning Objective: Integrative Thinking This course builds rhetorical skills in oral, written, visual, and digital contexts and introduces deliberation and advocacy in civic and disciplinary spheres. CAS (ENGL) 138T Rhetoric and Civic Life II (3) (GWS)ENGL/CAS 138T, Rhetoric and Civic Life II, expands knowledge and aptitudes built in ENGL/CAS 137H by asking students to use rhetorical skills and principles to develop strategies for persuasion and advocacy in the context of civic issues. The course continues the multimodal emphasis-the focus on oral, written, visual, and digital communication-used in 137H and adds new components as well. Students will develop a repertoire of communication skills through hands-on practice at composing and delivering speeches and essays, and they will work with digital media to create multimedia texts, podcasts, and websites. Students will reflect on these different modes as themselves rhetorical choices. The course's civic and ethical components take center stage as students learn how to deliberate important public issues thoughtfully and with civility and respect. They will learn the difference between persuasion and advocacy and develop strategies for both in the context of pertinent local, national, and global issues. They will participate in a public deliberation forum on topics they generate and vote on. The forum will be organized to allow small deliberative action groups as well as large forum-style meetings. The course focuses on ethics in many contexts, e.g., community action and public deliberation; ethics of persuasion; ethical controversies in the disciplines. Students will be encouraged to explore percolating disciplinary interests and to share knowledge in online disciplinary communities. Students will work throughout the semester to design and build a final electronic portfolio that represents their academic work with an eye to their imagined professional futures. The portfolio assignment offers students an opportunity to reflect on their work, assessing the merits and themes of inquiries, and to curate and present their work to both targeted and broad online audiences.

General Education: Humanities (GH) Honors GenEd Learning Objective: Effective Communication GenEd Learning Objective: Crit and Analytical Think GenEd Learning Objective: Key Literacies This course will allow students to study African American literature, culture, history, and arts in connection with an annual public event, the African American Read-In (AARI). The AARI, promoting literacy and appreciation of African American literature, is a national event established in 1990 under the auspices of the National Council of Teachers of English. It has become a regular feature of Black History Month celebrated by community, neighborhood, and church groups as well as schools and institutions of higher education throughout the United States and elsewhere on a given Sunday and Monday in February attracting more than a million participants annually. This course offers students an engaged learning experience in which they will produce original intellectual and artistic content to be presented publicly at an AARI event on campus. Students will study texts from a range of historical periods and/or genres, and thus gain a solid introduction to the African American literary tradition. At the same time, the primary organizing principle of the course will be a particular theme that both allows a broad and coherent overview of a significant cultural or historical topic and engages issues of cultural diversity in the United States. The specific theme, thus, will bring the study of African American literature into a broader interdisciplinary context that intersects with African American culture, history, identity, and the struggle for equality. Students will study texts that relate to this annual theme and participate in a relevant field trip (museum, theater, cultural site, library, etc.) to deepen their understanding of the significance and contexts, social, historical, cultural, artistic of these materials and this theme. They will then develop this knowledge through creative and critical engagements into exhibitions, presentations, or performances to communicate their insights about a particular author, text, or topic in in the African American literary tradition. As shapers of the AARI program on their campus, class members will also have a voice in designing and planning the AARI as well as a stake in its overall success. As this course necessarily spans semesters, students who enroll in the Fall course will be expected to enroll in the Spring course in order to present their projects at the AARI in February. Only students who were enrolled in the Fall course will be permitted to enroll in the Spring, as it is the culmination of the same course.

General Education: Humanities (GH) GenEd Learning Objective: Effective Communication GenEd Learning Objective: Crit and Analytical Think GenEd Learning Objective: Key Literacies Students will learn about Irish literature in the twentieth century and beyond; focus on the interplay of poltical, social, and cultural forces brought to bear on Irish literature, history, and politics from the early twentieth century to the present. The course will begin with the socio-political implications of the Home Rule movement and the important figures associated with the rise of the Irish Literary Renaissance. Instructors will spend much of the course focusing on canonical figures of modern Irish Literature (such as Joyce, Yeats, Synge, Beckett, Shaw,O'Casey,O'Flaherty, and Lady Gregory). The course will introduce students to the political context and themes of Irish Literary Renaissance (Irish Literary Renaissance), including cultural nationalism. Instructors may draw upon contemporary literary critics, such as Declan Kiberd, Seamus Deane, and Terence Brown, by way of introduction to the ILR. The class will then move on to Post-World War II Irish Literature. In this component of the course, instructors will select literature from writers who began publishing in the Post-War era. These authors may be examined as they follow the legacy of the ILR, or as they challenge it and forge new courses for Irish literature. In other words, these authors can be writing within or against the traditions and themes of ILR artists' or, more likely, doing both things at once. This component of the course will help students see the enduring legacy of the themes and forms of the ILR, as Irish authors continually reckon with its massive political and cultural inheritance. The course fulfills IL requirements in its emphasis on postcolonial relationships between Irish identity and culture and issues of British colonial occupation and the influence of American popular culture in the later twentieth century. The interpretive framework of postcolonial studies will inform the instructor's approach to the literature. Postcolonial studies seeks to examine the conditions and tropes of colonial and post-colonial writers and peoples. While postcolonial studies offers broad theories and concepts that can be applied to any postcolonial scene, the movement nonetheless has an interest in studying and honoring the regional particularities and the specific reaction of its writers to the postcolonial moment. This interplay of the unifying, international experience of colonialism with the particularity of individual nations and writers helps students to become sensitive to ideas of nation, unity, and difference. More so, the tropes of postcolonial literature, and Irish literature especially--focus on concepts of hybridity, the Other, contact zones, modernity vs. tradition, national identity, and personal identity, all on which seek to understand the self and others within an intercultural context. The literature of the IRL also explores the corrosive effects of British imperialism, which helps students to consider whether might makes right; and interrogate various forms of cultural imperialism, then and now. The literature of the IRL also promotes themes of intercultural understanding, featuring examples of reconciliation and compromise between tradition and modernity, and, more importantly, between Irish, American, and British characters. Assignments will help students focus on issues of identity construction, and social and political conflicts within and between cultures (Ireland in relationship to British and American culture and influence) within a post-colonial context. Bachelor of Arts: Humanities International Cultures (IL) General Education: Humanities (GH) GenEd Learning Objective: Effective Communication GenEd Learning Objective: Global Learning GenEd Learning Objective: Soc Resp and Ethic Reason When Thomas Jefferson elevated one pursuit to stand with life and liberty as inalienable rights, he eschewed others. The Declaration of Independence features the pursuit of happiness rather than that of amusements, consumer goods, status, money, or ease. Happiness carried a history of deeper meanings in philosophy and religion. In 1776, \"happiness\" peppered discussions of individualism, rights, civilization, economics, and government, and echoed Ancient Greek dialogues about virtue and civil society. In America, \"happiness\" joined the religious language of salvation, rapture, and joy to define states of grace. By the twentieth century, happiness became suspect as the term frequently represented a superficial type of enjoyment in needless consumption manipulated through marketing. As happiness came to be twined with wealth and goods, so too did it align increasingly with success in all pursuits. Happiness became a form of winning and a status marker whose overt pursuit was as likely to lead to psychological and social problems as to health. We open with ancient philosophers and modern positive psychologists. The pursuit of happiness reached zenith speed in the history of American literature. From transcendentalists, to pragmatists, self-help, children's fantasy, psychoanalysis, or post-modernism, genres fell out of themselves in the pursuit to merely understand happiness. Novels, poems, memoirs, films, popular psychology, medical literature, memes, and blogs addressed happiness from nearly every conceivable angle to explore strategies such as choosing positive thoughts; stilling thoughts; cultivating enriching interests and habits; influencing our moods and emotions; and optimizing strategies for securing the resources, skill-sets, possessions, and relationships that encourage happiness. Some of these achievements aligned with health and economic benefits and introduced limitations in access or cultural relevance. Bio-behaviorists are exploring correlation vs. causation and ways of assessing social and individual well-being. Bringing modern bio-behavioral methodologies into the chronological narrative creates unprecedented opportunities for integrative study. Experiential elements of wellness fulfill goals of General Health and Wellness, identifying \"wellness as a positive state of well-being, not merely the absence of disease.\" Students will learn the most promising research on generating tangible, healthful benefits in individuals and communities and be introduced to sources for further learning, continuing to learn and pursue long-term happiness.

Our states of well-being and illness are topics that, like the weather, drive our daily conversations, but we rarely have time to study and practice these vital exchanges. Spoken in emergency rooms or on long-distance calls, by medical professionals, family members, or strangers making small talk, the languages we use to share pain and recovery require our knowledge of long-established scripts and our willingness to improvise. By exploring how these encounters draw from and work as textual and dramatic performances, this course will guide students to achieve a new level of literacy in the most essential communicative art of caring. Students will analyze health conversations in literary texts, such as short stories, poems, memoirs, and graphic novels. They will explore real-life scenarios drawn from their own experiences, fieldwork, social science theories, and published case studies. Developing skills in the humanities (GH), they will see how subjective, often individual experience, historical perspectives, and creative expression help people to communicate about health and care. Developing their abilities in the social and behavioral sciences (GS), they will see how theory provides insights to predict and understand health and practices of care, investigate objective perspectives and recognize the contributions of fieldwork and data-driven studies to analyzing and improving communication when health is a main concern. They will integrate these methodologies especially to pursue these fields' common goals of making beneficial connections between individuals and groups, and managing private and public life.

Students conduct their own research on such topics as animal cognition and intelligence, animal language, anthropomorphism, animal testing and bioethics. Examples will be drawn from a range of disciplines in an effort to answer the central question: what is an animal, and what is a human? General Education: Humanities (GH) General Education: Natural Sciences (GN) General Education - Integrative: Interdomain GenEd Learning Objective: Effective Communication GenEd Learning Objective: Crit and Analytical Think GenEd Learning Objective: Soc Resp and Ethic Reason If you get a job out of college, work eight hours a day, fifty weeks a year, and retire at age 65, at that point you have will spent roughly one third of your adult, waking life at work. And that is just paid work. Add in housework, childcare, and other forms of unpaid labor and the share of your waking hours devoted to work creeps closer to one half. And those calculations may actually underestimate the influence work has over your life. What you do will determine where you live, how you live, and, perhaps, whether you believe you have ultimately done something meaningful with your life. With work playing such an outsized role in a life, you may as well understand it as best you can. Hence this class. In it, we approach the question of work from the perspective of two disciplines: labor and employment relations and literature. The field of labor and employment relations asks about the social and economic forces-markets, compensation, globalization, immigration, etc.-that shape work. By contrast, the discipline of literature takes a more subjective approach to the question of work. Very broadly speaking, it shows how the forces that shape work play out in individual lives. In short, it shows how individuals feel about the work they do or, in the case of the unemployed, they do not do. Together, the two disciplines provide a global and personal perspective on one of the most important parts of our lives. Students registering for the course will read representative selections from both domains, engage in course discussions, take exams, and write essays as they explore the variety of ways both labor and employment relations and Literature can prepare them for their work lives and help them understand the place of work in culture and society.

Approaching folklore as traditional patterns, practices, and performances, the course explains folklore to be fundamental to human cultural life, and therefore an intimate part of the identities and values that Americans express in contemporary society. It will explore these identities and values on various levels: the individual, the family, the community, the region, the nation, and the world. Folklore, you will discover, is not something confined to the past, but all around us in the present, and is continually emerging anew. Students will read and discuss a number of folk genres, including folk speech, narratives, beliefs and religious experiences, use of space, and material culture. Students will learn strategies for researching, \"reading,\" and understanding the verbal and nonverbal folklore of diverse communities. The class may include readings on cultural traditions drawn from Native American, Latinx, African American, and immigrant cultures, as well as other folk groups defined by social identities such as age, occupation, gender, sexuality, or religion. By the end of the course, students will be able to recognize the cultural, political, and historical implications of such traditions. Assignments will include a fieldwork project; involving first-hand interviews, site observations, and archival research; to document, annotate, and analyze oral traditions. Students will be evaluated on the basis of class discussion, oral presentation and group exercises, in-class examinations, and the fieldwork portfolio.

In the sample course, an understanding of the relationship between environmentalism and farming is developed through a consideration of thinking about food and food production in texts from the seventeenth through nineteenth centuries. These texts might touch on the importance of notions about the political importance of yeoman farmers, thoughts on the blending of cultivation and wildness, and late-nineteenth-century critiques of cruel and unsanitary industrial food production. The class might then turn to texts that argue for a return to sustainable agriculture in terms of Jeffersonian democracy and the ideal of the citizen-farmer. The topics raised in the first portion of the course include environmentalism, the role of labor in America, and the history of the industrialization of farming in the post-World War II era. From these origins, the course progresses into a consideration of the contemporary moment. It is clear that a great deal of change has occurred since mid-twentieth century critiques, and students are encouraged to trace the development of topics from the first portion of the syllabus in the later material. For example, the development of organic food standards by the FDA has resulted in a new system of organic industrial agriculture, which is compared to small scale agriculture by Michael Pollan, and Eric Schlosser updates muckraking investigations of labor and sanitation by turning to modern investigative journalism into the production of meat and the standards of uniformity set by fast food chains. The course ends with a consideration of the future of food as writers have imagined it. With a recommended experiential component, students are learning about the history of food production and writing about it while they encounter farmers who practice sustainable agriculture. Ideally, students learn from both the literature and from the farmer how something as practical as the production of food can be informed by philosophy and literature.

Students will practice the methods of ecologically oriented literary analysis (eco-criticism) and they will learn to contextualize the major historical periods, movements, and arguments for the necessity of literature about the natural world as it intersects with environmental studies. The course can cover anything considered \"literature,\" but namely fiction, poetry, nonfiction, and drama. Students will examine not only strategies of description, but also literature's unique ability to showcase conflict, reflection, and insight when it comes to protecting our environment. The course should include literature that addresses the human impact on nature. Students should learn about familiar environments and unfamiliar environments. Students should also come to understand the motivations of the authors. Bachelor of Arts: Humanities General Education: Humanities (GH) GenEd Learning Objective: Crit and Analytical Think GenEd Learning Objective: Integrative Thinking GenEd Learning Objective: Key Literacies Examines the interconnection of culture and nature in the Chesapeake Bay region through the literature of the region. ENGL 181A Adventure Literature: Exploring the Chesapeake Bay (4.5) The course focuses on a specific place--the Chesapeake Bay and its watershed--that has generated a distinctive regional identity and literature from its natural and social context. The course begins consideration of the concept of watershed, both as a geographical concept and a literary metaphor, before turning to an examination of the culture(s) and nature of the largest and most important tributary of the Bay, the Susquehanna River. Students will read texts associated with the history and the development of the Susquehanna, with some emphasis on logging, rafting, mining, and hydropower development. Readings here should aim at helping students see how a regional cultural identity has evolved from the river's geography and economics. Focus on the Bay itself, students can learn similar lessons. We begin by looking at the rich native cultures that occupied the region before the advent of Europeans and then move to initial European exploration and settlement. The class might then focus on development (agricultural, cultural, and industrial) of the Bay and Bay Region generally, through readings that might include regional histories and literary works like James Michener's Chesapeake: A Novel. Significant attention should be devoted to the sub-culture of the Chesapeake waterman, a regional identity that has generated its own mythology and folklore and has been the focus for numerous writers. Texts might be chosen to show the role nostalgia plays in conceptions of the Bay or the ways in which issues of race, class, and gender are raised by examining representations of the waterman culture. What students should see is how literature and culture are transformed over time, while resonances of former place identities remain. Finally, the course will turn to the Bay as it is today and how the representation of place and regional identity in literature has changed over time.This course was designed to include out-of-the-classroom educational experiences on the Susquehanna River and other tributes of the Bay and on the Chesapeake Bay itself. The trips should provide students opportunities to fully understand the interconnections of nature and culture in the Bay region. They should also allow students the chance to travel in the footsteps of the writers they read in venues throughout the region. The goal is to both see how a distinctive culture derived from the natural circumstances of the Chesapeake and to understand how that culture might continue (or not) into the future.

ENGL 181B Adventure Literature: Exploring Cape Cod (4.5) The purpose of this course is to teach students how natural and cultural contexts contribute to the production of meaning in literary texts. In this case, the locality that serves as the focus of study is Cape Cod, arguably the most written-about locale in the United States. The course begins with classes devoted to the Cape's natural history its formation and the ever-present effect of wind and water and then moves to its early human history. Readings in the first part of the course will focus on the period just before and after European settlement and readings could include selections from William Bradford's Of Plymouth Plantation or Mourt's Relation, both contemporaneous accounts of the Pilgrim's landing on and exploration of the Cape and appropriate chapters from Paul Schneider's history of the Cape, The Enduring Shore, and Nathaniel Philbrick's excellent account of the Pilgrim adventure, Mayflower. These readings could be enhanced with selections on the European settlement of the Cape in Robert Finch's anthology of writing about the Cape, A Place Apart. This introductory material will lead to the major part of the course, which will be devoted to reading and study of classic literature about the Cape, such as Thoreau's Cape Cod, Henry Beston's The Outermost House, Wyman Richardson's The House on Nauset Marsh, and John Hay's The Great Beach, as well as selections of poetry poets associated with the Cape. Each of these works, in its time, represents the writer's attempt to somehow capture and come to terms with the landscape and natural exigencies of the Cape. The focus will then turn to representations of the Cape in the work of contemporary writers, and might include work by Michael Cunningham, Annie Dillard, David Gessner, Cynthia Huntington, and Mary Oliver among others. The course ends with a brief look at Cape Cod's literary and natural future as it has been imagined over the last 140 years.This course was designed to include an out-of-the-classroom education experience on Cape Cod. The trip to the cape should include experiences related to the cultural and natural history of the region, and it should provide students the opportunities to walk in the footsteps of William Bradford, Thoreau, Beston, and Hay, as well as opportunities to see for themselves how the natural features that have inspired the classic and contemporary writers of the Cape will continue to inspire future generations of artists. Bachelor of Arts: Humanities United States Cultures (US) General Education: Humanities (GH) GenEd Learning Objective: Effective Communication GenEd Learning Objective: Integrative Thinking GenEd Learning Objective: Key Literacies GenEd Learning Objective: Soc Resp and Ethic Reason ENGL 181C -\"The Beach: Exploring the Literature of the Atlantic Shore\"-begins with some exploration of the dynamic forces at work on the barrier beach, with special attention to the ways in which great literature has taken what is described in the scientific literature and turned it into art. Examples for discussion are drawn from the work of such writers as Rachael Carson and Henry Beston. The general concerns of the course then move to environmental ethics, specifically as ethical questions are embodied in literature's representation of the human relationship with the other-than-human world, from such difficult-to-personify species as starfish, snakes, and spiders. General ethical questions then lead to specific treatments of human and wild animal interaction by various writers. The point is to explore how writers represent the optimal sort of relationship humans can have with the wild world, and what such representation might mean to the ways we personally interact with nature. From these opening considerations, the course turns to an examination of the way in which writers who focus on a specific region of the coast--South Atlantic barrier islands, for example-- establish a sense of the place in their writing. The course then narrows its focus even more, moving from a consideration of a regional cultural identity to that of specific towns or narrowly defined areas within the general region. This narrowed subject is explored in specific detail, beginning with pre-European cultures, the first explorers and settlers and then moving on to other aspects of the American culture history that make the subject area distinctive. For example, a course on the Low Country of South Carolina might start with the accounts of John Lawson, who published his journal of his own trip up the Santee River in 1701, move to accounts of the rice culture so important to the region in the nineteenth century and to the an examination of the Gullah Geechee culture established by West African slaves on Low Country plantations, and then move to writing from more recent writers, all of which help to define the area¿s distinctive cultural and particularly its literary identity. Bachelor of Arts: Humanities United States Cultures (US) General Education: Humanities (GH) GenEd Learning Objective: Effective Communication GenEd Learning Objective: Key Literacies GenEd Learning Objective: Soc Resp and Ethic Reason The purpose of ENGL 181D -\"Exploring the Literature of American Wilderness\"-is to study the literature and ideas associated with American wilderness in an experiential context; that is, the heart of this course should be an extended backpacking trip into a federally protected wilderness preserve. So the basic assumption on which this course is founded is that our understanding of literature and other cultural concerns can be enhanced by knowledge of and experience in a place. To achieve its purpose, this course will expose students to the following: - The history of wilderness in American culture, including the ongoing political debate about the meaning, value, and place of wilderness/wildness in that culture. - A representative sampling of the writing that has been directly inspired by wilderness experience. - Philosophical ideas directly associated with wilderness experience. - The rudiments of safe and low-impact backcountry travel and the manner in which to engage in that travel most ethically. - The direct experience of legally protects wilderness itself. - An opportunity, however briefly, to experiment with the Thoreavian notion of \"living deliberately.\" To accomplish this purpose, students will be asked to accomplish some reading and writing (of various types). In a version of this course previously offered, the exploration of the literary representation of wilderness over time-from Puritan historians and Enlightenment philosophers; to Thoreau, John Muir, and Theodore Roosevelt; to contemporary poets, novelists and literary journalists-is framed by reading Roderick Nash's standard history of wilderness in the United States, Wilderness and the American Mind Bachelor of Arts: Humanities United States Cultures (US) General Education: Humanities (GH) GenEd Learning Objective: Effective Communication GenEd Learning Objective: Integrative Thinking GenEd Learning Objective: Key Literacies GenEd Learning Objective: Soc Resp and Ethic Reason This course examines literature written in English from countried that were once part of the British Empire or some other European empire.

Students will analyze the reasons that the Cold War has been and continues to be a major inspiration for literary production and a transformative influence on literary style. Students will be encouraged to explore alternative methodologies for research on cold war topics including the use of primary sources, for ex. documents from the intelligence community archives that have since been declassified. In addition to a class field trip, students will be encouraged to make additional site visits to appropriate institutions in U.S. intelligence history. They'll be making a series of visits to relevant sites.

During the semester we will read short stories from various cultures and countries, ranging from stories written in the early nineteenth-century to those written within the last few years. Readings will include works from authors like Hawthorne, Melville, Tolstoy, Dostoevsky, Gogol, Bierce, Chekhov, Kafka, Chopin, Crane, Gilman, James, Cather, Joyce, Woolf, Faulkner, Hemingway, Lawrence, Orwell, O'Connor, Baldwin, Olson, Silko, Erdrich, Ondaatje, Barth, Barthelme, Atwood, Mukherjee, Walker, Tan, Calvino, Garcia Marquez, and Cortazar. All readings will be in English. This course is intended to help one learn how to read fiction, how to understand it, and how to talk about it. The desire to tell stories and to be told stories is one of the most basic human needs, and all cultures have been defined in part by the stories they hear and the stories they tell. We are not born knowing how to read the short story or any fiction for that matter. Rather it is a skill that one acquires, and the more one does it, like playing tennis or any other activity, the better one becomes at it, for we learn what to look for. We will explore the historical development of the short story genre, and examine how historical contexts relate to the content and style of the stories under discussion. We will become familiar with how stories are put together and with the vocabulary that is used to discuss fiction--terms such as plot, narrative, character, tone, language, closure, irony, imagery. and so forth. CMLIT/ENGL 184 is not required for the CmLit major but may be selected to fulfill one of the course requirements for the major or the World Literature Minor.

CMLIT 185 / ENGL 185 The Modern Novel in World Literature (3) (GH) (BA) This course meets the Bachelor of Arts degree requirements. In this course, students will read examples of the modern novel from around the world. Focusing on novels written outside of America and England, this class will explore the development of the modern novel as a genre across a number of world cultures. As an example, moving from the beginnings of literary modernism (the late nineteenth century) through the early and mid twentieth century, the course will consider works by writers such as the following: Chinua Achebe, Italo Calvino, Albert Camus, Simone deBeauvior, Fyodor Dostoevsky, Isak Dinesen, Marguerite Duras, Natalia Ginzburg, Herman Hesse, James Joyce, Thomas Mann, Gabriel Garcia Marquez, Kenzaburo Oe, and Marcel Proust. This course will address the ways in which the world novels under consideration constitute examples of various literary forms and styles. The class will examine the differences and distances between literary movements such as social realism and magical realism, modernism and postmodernism. The goals of this course will be to hone students' critical reading and writing skills while granting them the ability to think about the modern novel as a distinct genre in a comparative global context. This course will help students to develop the analytical skills necessary to analyze complex written texts..

Workman in 1987 as \"the study of the Middle Ages, the application of medieval models to contemporary needs, and the inspiration of the Middle Ages in all forms of art and thought.\" As this definition suggests, understanding medievalism and, thus, the popular works students know, such as Game of Thrones and Lord of the Rings' benefit from learning something about the Middle Ages and the reach of its re-mediation across various kinds of expression. Therefore, ENGL 190Q / INART 203Q begins by introducing students to medieval works and a few of the forms that characterize it. More particularly, the medieval works to be studied are those combining more than one genre, media, and/or form. For example, students will read and listen to (or sing!) medieval lyrics, read and perform short medieval plays such as Robin Hood, be introduced to manuscripts of the bestiary with its illuminations, historiated letters, and scribal copying. They also will be introduced to Romanesque and Gothic architecture The first medievalist remediations--works adapted in other media--to be examined will be Book I of Spenser's Faerie Queene, with the woodcut of the Redcrosse Knight and Dryden/Purcell's King Arthur, which will introduce students to Early Modern English medievalism and how it reflects prevailing values in new combinations of old and new artistic forms. Still greater emphasis will be placed on the English Medieval Revival of the nineteenth century, including John Ruskin and the PreRaphaelites poetry, paintings, and essays, as well as William Morris's poetry, painting and Arts and Crafts Movement. Then, as now, medievalism served multiple purposes, including aesthetic, political, and social. To put into practice what students learn and to engage their creativity, one assignment involves hand crafting an art project to be accompanied by an artist statement. In the last part of the course, the focus shifts to contemporary medievalist arts and theory. In keeping with the contemporary direction, another assignment asks students to remediate their handcrafted medievalist work, or to create a new one, using digital resources to engage both their creativity and understanding of key medievalist concepts.

No longer confined to a tribe, nation or tradition, science fiction narrates and explores the galactic magnitudes of both the external world of astronomical exploration (billions and billions of stars) and the inner world of subjective reality and imagination (billions and billions of neurons). This course introduces students to the surprisingly long history of science fiction as a way of exploring both the microcosm and the macrocosm, mapping a species imagining themselves into the future.

This course examines the development of literary traditions in fantasy literature from their earliest origins in mythology and folklore, through the historical development of classic fantasy works, into the books, movies and other fictions of the modern day. The course specifically considers how the fantasy genre has incorporated a range of international traditions. The course also explores different critical and theoretical approaches to the student of fantasy literature and related artistic traditions, as surrealism and magical realism.

Students will learn through an integrated and ongoing process of interpreting select comics texts and also making their own work in that same medium. Students will gain a technical vocabulary for discussing and assessing comics, which they will then apply to formal analysis of compositional and narrative elements in select assigned texts. This analysis will occur first in class discussion, facilitated by the instructors, and then through a sequence of individual written assignments. At the same time, students will receive formal instruction in making comics as they create their own work over the course of the semester, workshopping with peers and instructors as a way of gaining further insight into the creative and technical processes of the studied texts. Formal analysis and creative work will be coordinated and progressive across the course of the semester. The culmination of this collaborative learning would be an integrated understanding and appreciation of comics art.

English 194 will constitute a wide ranging study of works by American, British, and other English-speaking women writers, including novels, short stories, poems, plays, and prose. The class will approach this literature from a variety of thematic, historical, and/or generic vantages. Authors under consideration will vary from class to class, but may include writers such as Bradstreet, Wollstonecraft, C. Rosefti, M. Shelley, Austen, C. Bronte, E. Bronte, G. Eliot, D.

The course seeks to make students aware of the extensive body of literature written by women through the analysis, evaluation, and appreciation of specific works by women writers. The course also seeks to help students understand the female perspectives-the varying values and interests of women--reflected in the texts at hand and to position these perspectives within wider social, historical, and political contexts. The course also seeks to make students aware of the special problems faced by both women writers and the female inhabitants of the societies they describe in their work. As a course in women's literature, ENGL/WMNST 194 concerns itself with questions of gender. In so far as some of these women writers are black or women of color, it concerns itself with questions of race and ethnicity. In as far as the course looks at women's literature in the context of men's literature, it is concerned with the inter-relationship between dominant (male) and non-dominant (female) culture in the United States as well as in Britain. In so far as the course covers lesbian writers, it is concerned with sexual orientation. Topics under consideration will vary from class to class, but may include a chronological introduction to the development of women's literature, a consideration of a principle theme or themes common to women's literature through a number of works from across a number of historical periods, a consideration of a number of women's works in the context of historical events central to their creation, a consideration of a number of women's works in the context of formal or aesthetic elements common to those works and their various effects. This class will prepare students for advanced courses in women's literature as well as other academic courses that engage in the verbal and written analysis of complex written texts.

The course also seeks to make students aware of the special problems faced by both women writers and the female inhabitants of the societies they describe in their work. As a course in women's literature, ENGL/WMNST 194 concerns itself with questions of gender. In so far as some of these women writers are black or women of color, it concerns itself with questions of race and ethnicity. In as far as the course looks at women's literature in the context of men's literature, it is concerned with the inter-relationship between dominant (male) and non-dominant (female) culture in the United States as well as in Britain. In so far as the course covers lesbian writers, it is concerned with sexual orientation. Topics under consideration will vary from class to class, but may include a chronological introduction to the development of women's literature, a consideration of a principle theme or themes common to women's literature through a number of works from across a number of historical periods, a consideration of a number of women's works in the context of historical events central to their creation, a consideration of a number of women's works in the context of formal or aesthetic elements common to those works and their various effects. Time allofted for the study of the works under consideration will vary. This class will prepare students for advanced courses in women's literature as well as other academic courses that engage in the verbal and written analysis of complex written texts. Students will be evaluated by means of essays written in and out of class, essay exams, term-long reading journals, and class participation. Students should expect to complete a minimum of three written assignments in the course of the term. The course may be used as English Major elective credit or as credit towards the English Minor and will be offered once a year with 60 seats per offering.

ENGL 200W Introduction to Critical Reading (3)(BA) This course meets the Bachelor of Arts degree requirements. When we read a work of literature, how do we determine what it means? Why do readers and critics come up with different interpretations of the same work? How do we decide if a literary work is valuable or not? This course addresses these and other questions by introducing students to the variety of literary questions on which critics and scholars base their interpretations of literature. Each theory poses different questions about a literary text's meanings and focuses our attention on different aspects of a text's language and background. We will examine the theory and practice the application of the following schools of criticism: formalism, psychoanalytic criticism, new historicism, Marxism, and feminism. We will apply different methods to particular literary texts, and students will practice different types of approaches in in-class writing assignments as well as in four papers (4-5 pages each). At the end of the semester, each student will put together a portfolio containing careful revisions of three of those papers as well as an introductory commentary of 1-2 pages. Bachelor of Arts: Humanities Writing Across the Curriculum ENGL 201 What is Literature acquaints students with theory and practice relevant to studies of narrative, lyric poetry, and drama. This course meets the Bachelor of Arts degree requirements. English 201 will familiarize students with theories and practices that are foundational for thinking about literature, and for studying narrative fiction, poetry, and drama. The course will pose such questions as what is narrative fiction?; what is poetry?; what is drama?; It will introduce students to how conventions of literary genres operate, how they generate meaning, and how they require and manipulate reader's responses. English 201 will also encourage students to explore whether or not literary discourse, as instanced in the genres that have been named, can be distinguished from other written or spoken discourses. While asking such questions, the course will acquaint students with technical vocabularies used by literary scholars and literary historians, and will provide students with sample scholarly rationales for hypothesizing the singularity of literary discourse, for constructing literary history, and for understanding literature's relation to life. It will teach students close analytic practices of reading, both those that have shaped the discipline of English studies and those emerging currently.

Moreover, what you read, and what is read to you, introduces you to the values that your culture holds dear. Despite its importance to individuals and their culture, we-instructors, students-only rarely approach children's literature with the same seriousness that we approach other works of literature. This course sets out to correct that. It assumes that texts like Alice's Adventures in Wonderland, Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone, or Don't Let the Pigeon Drive the Bus! reward the kind of close and careful study that scholars and students usually reserve for more canonical works of literature. Students who take this course will leave it with a sense of the history and development of children's literature in English, the methods of studying children's literature, and, most of all, an understanding of how children's literature reproduces and occasionally challenges the values of the culture that produces and disseminates it. Its overall premise is that you can learn a lot about a culture-how it feels about childhood, race, gender, work, religion, and so on-by what that culture does and does not offer its children to read. General Education: Humanities (GH) GenEd Learning Objective: Effective Communication GenEd Learning Objective: Crit and Analytical Think GenEd Learning Objective: Soc Resp and Ethic Reason For many people, literature and business could not have less to do with each other. According to this view, literature escapes from reality to the imaginative, while nothing could be more focused on the real than business and its buying and selling of commodities and services. The problem is that no one told literary writers of this mutual incompatibility. For centuries, writers have peered into the world of business and brought back stories intended to document, inspire, and warn. True, writers have often, and sometimes unthinkingly, condemned business and those who follow it, but they have just as often had genuine insights into its workings. In this course, we will follow the relationship between literature and business over the course of modern history. Although one version of the course would begin with literature that dates back to the invention of capitalism in (more or less) the sixteenth century, our course will begin at the turn of the nineteenth century, with the Industrial Revolution in England and the United States, and follow the literature of business up to the present. Our aim in reading is not just to understand how writers have represented business and those who pursue it, which, it has to be admitted, has often been with contempt. But, rather, in reading more sympathetic works, to understand the drama of business, why those who pursue it find it so invigorating, and why those who have historically been excluded from it-women, African Americans, colonial subjects-have been so eager to join it. Money, of course, is one answer to those questions, but it is neither the only nor the most important one. General Education: Humanities (GH) GenEd Learning Objective: Effective Communication GenEd Learning Objective: Crit and Analytical Think GenEd Learning Objective: Soc Resp and Ethic Reason The Beatles are the most significant musical group in the history of popular music. Their songs are derived from diverse sources, such as rhythm 'n' blues, rock 'n' roll, country 'n' western, Motown, soul, folk music, folk rock, the British Music Hall, and European and Indian classical music traditions. Two ideas define their work: an emphasis on freedom, and how song texts can be interpreted in different ways. The Beatles had a great impact not only on American popular music during their heyday in the 1960s but also on the country' s popular culture in which they were considered philosopher kings. Beatle albums mirrored changing trends in the culture, from the pre-Vietnam War youthfulness of A Hard Day's Night, to the psychedelia of Revolver and Sgt. Pepper, to the countercultural mindset of The White Album. This inter-domain course will focus on how the Beatles influenced American popular culture from the 1960s to the present day. It will examine how the Beatles were a part of a mid-twentieth-century British youth subculture that was shaped by the cultural attitudes of American rock 'n' roll. The course will then turn its attention to the seismic shift initiated by the Fab Four in both music and pop culture in the US from 1964 to 1970, demonstrating how it has permeated the popular culture of the 1970s to the present day. The course will enhance the appreciation of the Beatles and their music through its interdisciplinary focus, contextualizing the Fab Four's work in order to show how both popular music and culture can influence one another. One way the course will facilitate this goal is through the inclusion of selected readings from English literature and popular culture upon which students will write reflection essays.

This course introduces students to the most salient issues and theories in writing studies. Students explore contemporary theories and issues about writing in order to understand writing as a skill and a complex object of study in various professional contexts. ENGL 211W Introduction to Writing Studies (3)Most students know that writing is something one does; they are less aware that writing is something one studies, and that doing so is a challenging and fascinating intellectual endeavor. In this class, students explore the multifaceted nature of writing. As the list of major topics indicates above, students study a broad range of contemporary theories and issues, from the socially-constituted self in the act of writing, to plagiarism as it is variably defined in professional settings, to the role of the writer in social change. The course is designed for both breadth and depth. Breadth is achieved through the many topics described above. The exams are designed to encourage students to make connections from one topic to another, to see how each builds on and intertwines with others. For example, early semester study on a writer&rsquo;s individual agency is later complicated by issues of power determined by race, class, and gender. Writers&rsquo; ethical choices are made more challenging when confronted with questions of ideology and social justice. Depth is achieved through the written essays. Each essay requires that students examine a narrow topic in depth, building on an assigned reading with limited and manageable primary and secondary research. For example, students may study their own writing as intertextual, drawing conclusions about originality and creativity in the process. Throughout the course, students are encouraged to apply issues and theories to real-world situations, in such realms as professional settings, politics, media, and social justice. Several speakers come to class throughout the semester to expose students to the many kinds of writing professional writers do, the expectations and standards required of professional writers, and the avenues to success as professional writers. Writing Across the Curriculum English 212 is a course for students who want to try writing fiction for the first time and for more seasoned writers who are ready to develop greater courage for expression, complexity of craft, and skills for analysis and revision. You will find new sources of inspiration and sharpen your senses for observation. You will master the core components of fiction, such as character, setting, point of view, dialogue, and plot, and you will learn to improve your writing by sharing and reworking it. The course typically involves short exercises designed to help you strengthen key areas of your writing; analysis of published short stories and essays for examples and advice; and, centrally, workshop settings, where you will gain experience giving and receiving generous, useful criticism. You will complete at least one longer, cohesive work of fiction, such as a short story or section of a novel. You will learn to take up the writing life with a spirit of adventure and play, even as you get serious about the disciplined work and vital stakes of making fiction. By inspiring the production, analysis, and appreciation of creative arts, this course satisfies Bachelor of Arts and General Education requirements for Arts.

ENGL 214 Introduction to Creative Nonfiction Writing (3) Creative nonfiction borrows techniques from fiction and poetry while adhering to but also sometimes questioning notions of truth. It stretches the bounds of literary or narrative journalism by asking the reader to consider it as art, primarily, versus as testimony, fact, or information-delivery. Students taking this course will explore the genre's influences in fiction, research, and poetry; critical analyses will complement this exploration, and formal experimentation will prepare students to imagine novel relationships between form and content. Discussing traditional storytelling technique, the course introduces students to story rudiments including the inciting episode, rising and falling action, climax and denouement and the so-called swerve ending. The course also introduces students to the possibilities of the nonlinear \"lyric essay\" as outlined in Seneca Review and elsewhere, as well as to the \"modular\" essay; uses of blank space for communicating the unsayable; and how poetic style can circle elusive meaning.In exploring issues of nuance and implied or glanced-at meaning, the course also discusses the place of truth in nonfiction - differing constructions and conceptions of truth; reader expectations for factuality in a work of nonfiction; and the complications of unreliability when the fallibility of memory or a multiplicity of perspectives color testimony.Finally, the course examines the role of nontraditional structure in conveying a postmodern understanding of subjectivity, for instance by looking at the use of multiple voices and personae in the works of certain contemporary authors. While ENGL 215 teaches skills for the journalist in developing feature-style journalism and narrative personal essays, ENGL 214, alternatively, will explore and exploit the influence of fiction, poetry, and other lyric forms. Students in this course will produce writing more appropriate to a literary journal than a news magazine; their writing will concern broad, sometimes disjunctive themes, and stray away from the nut-graf, news-hook, or even an obvious narrative focus. Bachelor of Arts: Arts General Education: Arts (GA) GenEd Learning Objective: Effective Communication GenEd Learning Objective: Creative Thinking GenEd Learning Objective: Crit and Analytical Think Students will be directed in a variety of commercial and professional nonfiction forms, including but not limited to blog posts, feature articles, reported narratives, investigative reporting, literary journalism, criticism, and commentary. Specifically, students will discuss the basic elements or building blocks of commercial and professional nonfiction, such as structure, setting, quotation, point of view, and narrative distance. Students will practice those techniques by producing writing exercises and longer pieces, and by reading a variety of published works that showcase these techniques and skills. Students will also participate in full-class workshops, in which each student's original writing is read and collectively discussed by the class. All students will participate in in-depth discussions of their peers' work. To hone their skills, students will practice, experiment, improvise, and revise, and in doing so, develop an appreciation for writing as a form of creative and social expression.

These links between authors and artists have exerted a formative influence on the development of modern fiction and poetry as authors and artists in various avant-garde groupings collaborated and competed to generate modes of artistic expression appropriate to modernity. This course examines those interactions. Course objectives are to bring together for comparative examination: * Formal or generic relationships between texts and images at particular historical moments; under this rubric we will consider issues such as ekphrasis. * Creative collaboration and cross-pollination between writers and artists, which have been crucially important in the history of literature and poetry; examples include Pre-Raphaelite poetry and painting, Virginia Woolf and Post-Impressionism, Gertrude Stein and Cubism * Conceptions of creativity as these have been expressed by writers using the figure of the artist; texts in this category range from Balzac's The Unknown Masterpiece, through Hawthorne's The Marble Faun, to Paul Auster's appropriation from the performance artist Sophie Calle This course explores the ways knowledge of literature and skills in critical reading can be rewardingly brought to bear on the visual arts, and considers how visual art can illuminate the workings of literature both for individual readers and in the classroom.

The terms \"feminist\" and \"homosexual\" were invented by the Victorians and reflect profound shifts in conceptions of identity. Another invention of the nineteenth century was the idea of the literary and artistic \"avant-garde\" as a minority contingent with politically and/or aesthetically advanced views. These ideas of minority culture were deeply enmeshed with one another, and have exerted profound influence ever since. This course explores that history with the objectives of expanding students' knowledge of modern art and literature, and of fostering more sophisticated understandings of how evolving socio-political ideas affect our sense of who we are and how we relate to texts and images. The course is relevant to students of American and English studies, art, art history, and women's, gender and sexuality studies.

ENGL 226 Latina and Latino Border Theories (3) (GH;US;IL)(BA) This course meets the Bachelor of Arts degree requirements. This course focuses on contemporary Latina/o cultural production, placing it in historical context and analyzing it through the framework of borders. We make connections between Latina/o groups, showing both similarities and differences. We examine the politics of representation, asking how artistic texts define community and individual identities that are coherent yet also embody the complexity of these identities. The texts cross and claim borders- cultural, sexual, gender, geographical, generational, spiritual, and institutional. We will ask how these art forms work to claim border spaces: How are cultural differences retained without constructing hierarchies of exclusion? What models of identity do these artists propose in response to structures of domination? We'll read novels, short stories, poems, history, and theoretical essays; we will also watch several films. Throughout the course, we will attend to particular histories and cultures of Latina/o groups; it is crucial to both maintain the specificity of each culture (Chicana/o, Puerto Rican, Cuban-American, and Dominican-American) and their connections to each other as Latinas/os in the U.S. Inquiring into these intersections leads one to ask the following: how can Latinos unite against the assault on immigrants and bilingual education without erasing very important differences among Latina/o populations? How can Latinas unite against ongoing sexism and homophobia within their communities and the U.S. in general? How should we view the marketing category \"Hispanic\" and/or \"Latino\" and how do artists offer alternative conceptions of group identity?

The course interrogates sexual norms and their deviations, with a particular focus on the relationships between sexuality, imagination, and ethics in the making of sexual communities and fostering activism around sexuality and gender. We will study how class, race, and gender have been shaped, and themselves shape, the production of and resistance to sexual norms. Queer Theory engages issues \"queer space\" and \"queer time,\" related concepts that relate bodies and environments to history and memory, and to fantasy, imagination, and utopianism. We will also explore the ways marginalization, shame, and criminalization have been transformed into visionary acts of \"world-making\" that have changed contemporary understandings of bodies, identities, social formations, literature and visual culture. Throughout, our focus will be on the relationships between sexuality and ethics, and how both shape the history of queer culture and activism.

This is one of two paired introductory courses developed as required courses for the Disability Studies minor. (The other is RHS 100.) Students will have wide exposure to both the lived experiences of disability, past and present, and to the unstable cultural norms that have traditionally stigmatized disability. The course explores valuable varieties of human embodiment and mindedness; it also asks central questions about what counts as \"normal,\" and who gets to say why. Making use of historical tracts, novels, poetry, movies, plays, art exhibits, memoirs, youtube clips, and activist documents, ENGL 228 offers important new dimensions and challenges to traditional accounts of human value and political agency. United States Cultures (US) General Education: Humanities (GH) GenEd Learning Objective: Crit and Analytical Think GenEd Learning Objective: Soc Resp and Ethic Reason This course will introduce students to concepts, methods, and resources for digital studies, meaning both the study of culture using digital means and the study of digital culture and digital cultural objects in themselves. In some cases, digitization and digital production enrich existing approaches to English studies; in other cases, they present new paradigms and practices, requiring the cultivation of new analytic and theoretical approaches along with new technical skills. Accordingly, the course will emphasize both that enrichment of existing approaches to English studies, in the use of computers to present and analyze English-language materials preserved in the past, and the application of computing to the creation of expressive cultural artifacts unique to networked and programmable media (at the instructor's discretion, the creation of such artifacts may be incorporated into the course). Working in this balance of modes, students will also acquire familiarity with the intellectual history of digital studies and its key debates. Topics to be covered may include the fundamentals of the digital representation of linguistic, visual, and other cultural data; differences between language and code, including the difference between human languages and artificial languages, including computer programming languages; data storage methods and media; electronic archiving and digital preservation, both personal and institutional; issues and debates in electronic publishing, including intellectual property and open access; computer-assisted methods of cultural analysis; the history of creative and expressive computing, from video games to electronic literature, code poetry, glitch culture, esoteric programming languages, etc.; data privacy and security issues; differences between the traditional qualitative approaches of humanities research and the quantitative approaches to the study of writing and language preferred by some social sciences, and what is at stake in blending these approaches. General Education: Humanities (GH) GenEd Learning Objective: Creative Thinking GenEd Learning Objective: Integrative Thinking GenEd Learning Objective: Key Literacies This course offers students a broad introduction to key moments and authors in the literary traditions that shaped US literature up to 1865. While individual authors and works discussed in class will vary, the course addresses the overall development of literatures in the United States by time periods and genres that may range from pre-Columbian oral traditions to American fiction and poetry published until the end of the Civil War. The class may feature the study of representative examples of both oral traditions and written works. In addition to highlighting enduring literary voices, the class may also highlight the development of specific genres (such as slave narratives), literary movements (such as Transcendentalism), periods of literary production (such as the American Renaissance) or other groupings of authors (such as the Fireside Poets) over the course of US literary history. Likewise, the class may include works both by authors who were popular at the time when they published their works (and thus able to impact American literature and culture during their lifetime) and those whose contributions to literary history were recognized only later. While it should be expected that no version of this course will be able to cover all authors whose works emerged before 1865, selected authors and works might include the following: examples of Native American, African American, and other oral traditions; excerpts from works by authors such as Anne Bradstreet, Edward Taylor, Cotton Mather, Phillis Wheatley, Samson Occom, Benjamin Franklin, Washington Irving, James Fenimore Cooper, Harriet Beecher Stowe, William Cullen Bryant, Henry Wadsworth Longfellow, John Greenleaf Whittier, James Russell Lowell, Oliver Wendel Holmes, Frederick Douglass, Harriet Jacobs, Edgar Allan Poe, Nathaniel Hawthorne, Henry David Thoreau, Ralph Waldo Emerson, Margaret Fuller, Herman Melville, Walt Whitman, or Emily Dickinson.

Bachelor of Arts: Humanities United States Cultures (US) General Education: Humanities (GH) GenEd Learning Objective: Effective Communication GenEd Learning Objective: Integrative Thinking GenEd Learning Objective: Key Literacies Writing Across the Curriculum This pedagogically innovative course will be team taught by an instructor from the English department and one from the Chemistry department. Both instructors will be present in the classroom throughout the semester, providing joint presentations and leading discussions. The integration of humanities and natural sciences domain content will encourage students from humanities and natural science backgrounds, as well as other interested students, to take the course and learn how to integrate these two domains of knowledge in their education and their lives after leaving Penn State. This course teaches both basic concepts of chemistry and their cultural elaboration in literature, and it models a critical assessment of the implications of chemistry and literature emerging from a shared cultural field, rather than autonomously from two separate cultures. The course seeks to provide students with a nuanced understanding of how literature and science inform each other and negotiate cultural, religious, and political tensions. Understanding the origin and development of these ideas, perspectives, and discoveries is an essential component of science and scientific achievement, but too often our methods of teaching science focus almost exclusively on teaching facts and theories at the expense of the historical discovery, creation, and development of those facts and theories. This courses teaches both the scientific facts and theories and the contexts of their production in order to sharpen students' abilities at critical evaluation of facts. The literary and scientific focus will vary from class to class, but may include writings by literary authors such as Mary Shelley, Edward Bulwer-Lytton, Bram Stoker, H. G. Wells, Garrett Serviss, Aldous Huxley, Roald Hoffmann, Carl Djerassi, Don DeLillo, William Butler Yeats, Arthur Machen, D.H. Lawrence, A. E. Waite, Aleister Crowley, Arthur Conan Doyle, Camille Flammarion, and Rachel Carson, and scientific texts by scientists such as T.H. Huxley, William Crookes, William Ramsay, Frederick Soddy, Ernest Rutherford, Wilhelm Conrad Roentgen, Henri Bequerel, J.J. Thomson, Niels Bohr, and Marie Curie. Key concepts of environmental chemistry. The specific focus of this class will vary from class to class, but all sections will spend approximately 40% of the class on units specifically devoted to key concepts in basic chemistry, 40% of the class on literary interpretations of and influences upon concepts in chemistry in specific historical periods, and 20% of the class on significant methods of theorizing the boundaries between and interrelationships of science and culture., and on the concept of the \"culture of science.\" However, these subjects will be interwoven throughout the semester. Indeed, the pedagogy of the course depends upon the literature and the science not being neatly separated from each other. Instead, students will learn up-to-date science while exploring the origins, development, and cultural dimensions of that science, and will learn to integrate their understanding of the domains of science and the humanities through the course. The course will be offered once every year with approximately 20-35 seats per offering.

This course explores the ethical issues that arise in a culture of competition, and it uses a variety of literary texts to ground that exploration. It seeks to provide students with a nuanced understanding of how dependent sports are on narratives, and how a variety of ethical issues underwrite existing narratives about sports. With a focus on \"the big three\" (baseball, basketball, and football), the course has a U.S. focus but also has opportunities for students to write about other sports and in non-U.S. contexts. The course connects issues in literature to issues that arise in real time as the semester unfolds. Through the readings, students will develop a heightened awareness of how different a sport can look from the \"inside,\" as an athlete or coach. The literature, that is, develops ethical imaginations and helps students think in a more complicated way about one of the most talked-about phenomena in American culture: athletics, at all levels. Units on baseball, basketball, and football focus on issues specific to those sports (e.g., the basketball unit features texts and discussions about Title IX and gender equity in sport; football on violence, injury, and athlete expendability. The course seeks to equip students to have more sophisticated conversations about sports issues, and to be more discerning as spectators and consumers of sports.

ENGL 235 / AFAM 235 From Folk Shouts and Songs to Hip Hop Poetry (3) (US)(BA) This course meets the Bachelor of Arts degree requirements. This course contemplates connections between African oral traditions and contemporary trends in Black poetry including hip-hop and spoken word poetry. The central objective of the course is to examine the degree to which the most contemporary forms of African American poetry continue to function as folk expression; it provides an opportunity for students to examine the oral roots of African American literature in general and contemporary hip-hop and spoken word poetry, in particular. Music, particularly the Blues and Jazz, will be a prominent feature of this class as we try to discover the peculiarities of Black poetry. Students will begin by comparing African and African American folk forms such as proverbs and epic poetry, continue with early African American poets such as Phyllis Wheatley, George Moses Horton, Frances Ellen Watkins Harper, and Paul Laurence Dunbar, and continue through the 20th century with the poetry of the Harlem Renaissance and Black Arts Movement to contemporary Hip-Hop and Spoken Word, including Def Poetry Jam recordings. Background readings will include important essays (such as James Weldon Johnson's \"Preface to the Book of Negro Poetry\" and Langston Hughes's \"The Negro Artist and the Racial Mountain\") that reveal the kinds of aesthetic issues African American artists faced in crafting their art in the face of a dominant culture that consistently questioned their capacity for artistic production. Students will listen as Margaret Walker reads her famous poem, \"For My People,\" and they will consider the importance of the Black Arts Movement, its poets and critics to the development of contemporary hip-hop and spoken word poetry. Other course materials will include videotaped interviews and poetry readings. Readings would come from an appropriate anthology and/or a combination of other appropriate texts selected by the instructor. Cross-listed with: AFAM 235 Bachelor of Arts: Humanities United States Cultures (US) The Cubists were a group of painters including George Bracques, Pablo Picasso, working in Paris in the 1910s who, in addition to other painterly innovations, depicted objects not from one perspective but from multiple perspectives simultaneously. The final painting could sometimes look like a blur, but, or so the theory went, such multiplicity of perspectives could offer a truer, more complete representation of reality than any single perspective. In this class, we shall adopt a Cubist strategy of taking multiple perspectives. But instead of a guitar or a nude, our object of study will be inequality, and the multiple perspectives will not be different angles of seeing but different disciplines: economics, sociology, education, philosophy, and literature. How does each discipline define inequality? What does each have to say about it? And what does each argue, if anything, should be done about it? The class will mostly focus on economic inequality, but as you will discover, discussions of economic inequality quickly involve discussions of other forms of inequality (principally race and gender) besides economic inequality, and we shall consider those as well.

In this course, we will discuss how poets can use letters, diaries, transcripts, and other materials to create poems that capture historical events and everyday life in order to bear witness to particular moments in time. An important element of the course will be the role of documenting our world in terms of social justice and ethical responsibility. Whether focusing on public education, poverty, race, class, disability, gender, environmentalism, or other subjects, documentary poets personalize issues that are typically represented with broader brushstrokes. As Paul Metres observes, documentary poets invite \"the real life outside the poem\" into the poem itself, thereby \"testing\" the boundaries of what Wallace Stevens called \"the pressure of reality.\" We will begin by viewing and discussing documentary poetry within the context of photography and filmmaking. Next, we will read and discuss documentary poems, including persona, collage, and erasure poems. These readings will also include interviews with select documentary poets about their processes. An overview of poetry terminology, research methods, and the ethics of documentary art will provide you with the basis for composing your own documentary poems. The last third of the course will be spent writing and workshopping your original documentary poems.

Bachelor of Arts: Humanities General Education: Humanities (GH) GenEd Learning Objective: Effective Communication GenEd Learning Objective: Crit and Analytical Think GenEd Learning Objective: Key Literacies An introduction to the dominant themes in Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender, and Queer Studies, with an emphasis on both literary & cultural studies. This course explores the history of modern, western ideas about sexual identity as manifested in literature, theater, film, and other narrative forms of popular culture. Drawing on the substantial body of \"queer theory\" generated by scholars in the humanities since the 1990s, this class examines sexuality not as a \"natural\" or consistent phenomenon, but as a set of beliefs that have changed over time and manifest themselves differently in different cultural and historical contexts. Starting in the late nineteenth century, scientific and medical authorities began categorizing individuals into sexual types based on their manifestations of gendered characteristics and their erotic attractions and practices. This medical typing corresponded with the development of subcultures associated with deviance from sexual norms; these subcultures produced a rich variety of texts, images, performances, and social forms, many of which became central to both popular and high culture. This course explores this rich archive, moving among media. It investigates constructions of sexual conformity and how sexual nonconformists positioned themselves in relation to cultural and medical group identities. It examines how distinctions between gendered, raced, and classed bodies were historically produced and culturally contested. It considers what commonalities gay identities may - or may not -- share with lesbian identities and how transgender and other identities have altered perceptions of sexual identity. The course also explores the relationship of the avant-garde to the mass media and how sexual subcultures have shaped literary and other cultural forms of expression. Comparative study of issues of sexual mobility beyond and between the borders of the United States expands the course's critical scope beyond dominant forms of western culture. This course does not propose definitive answers to the questions of identity it addresses. Instead it negotiates the ways sexualities have enabled individuals to articulate -- and disarticulate -- themselves within social bodies past and present. This course, therefore, has wide relevance for students interested in how group identities come into being and transform over time in dynamic relation to other historical forces. Exploring a wide variety of cultural forms associated with the history of sexual identity as well as a variety of interpretations of that history, this course opens students to an archive of literature, theater, film, and other narrative arts with the potential to inform and enrich their understandings of many kinds of challenges to regimes of normativity today.

This course takes up the question of genre - what it is and why it matters - using a particular literary form (the early novel, epic poetry, episodic drama, memoir detective fiction, etc.) as its focus. Students will examine specific genre iterations across time and media, with attention to how conventional forms can both value tradition and incorporate innovation. Bachelor of Arts: Humanities General Education: Humanities (GH) GenEd Learning Objective: Effective Communication GenEd Learning Objective: Crit and Analytical Think GenEd Learning Objective: Key Literacies ENGL 262 examines the critical, theoretical, and practical issues that readers face when reading fiction. Students will examine critical concepts ranging from fundamental analytical concerns such as plot structure, characterization, and themes, to broader ethical, philosophical, social, and political questions raised by fiction. As a genre course, ENGL 262 will pay special attention to the critical issues and problems raised by reading fiction, as opposed to reading poetry, drama, or non-fiction. Authors might include the following: Defoe, Richardson, Fielding, Walpole, Burney, Sterne, Smollett, C.B. Brown, Austen, J.F. Cooper, Hawthorne, Melville, Child, Chopin, Shelley, the Brontes, G.

Examining the fundamental tools of reading poetry (meter, rhyme, image, diction, poetic forms, figurative language, and other rhetorical devices), students in English 263 will pay special attention to the critical issues and problems raised by reading poetry, as opposed to reading fiction, drama, non-fiction, or social texts. Authors under consideration will vary from class to class, but may include writers such as Chaucer, Shakespeare, Marvell, Herbert, Donne, Jonson, Milton, Pope, Blake, Coleridge, Wordsworth, Byron, Shelley, Keats, Tennyson, Clare, Browning, Hopkins, Rossetti, Wheatley, Melville, Whitman, Dickinson, Poe, Dunbar, Justice, Frost, Stevens, Williams, Pound, Eliot, Moore, Loy, H.D., Cummings, Crane, Robinson, Yeats, Hughes, Cullen, Olson, O'Hara, Creeley, Duncan, Auden, Lowell, Plath, Ginsberg, Lorde, Atwood, Brooks, Baraka, GlOck, Doty, and many others. The course may be taught in a number of different ways, for instance, simply by breaking the course down into relatively equally weighted units on particular formal aspects of poetry (rhyme, meter, genre-epic, dramatic, lyric, and various sub-genres-fixed forms, and the like) and then moving on to units designed to explore how poetry addresses specific social, cultural, and historical contexts.

Biographies, autobiographies, travel narratives, science writing, and political writing could be included along with hybrid nonfiction such as graphic memoir and the video essay. As a reading (not writing) class, content will focus on the implicit contract of truth between the writer and the reader, with discussions to focus on the impact of a \"true story\" told creatively. What must the writer accomplish on the page in order for a reader to become engaged with this genre? The course will bring to the table questions of ethics and morals when applied to our latest understanding of the fallibility or reliability of memory and how authors use their memories to write nonfiction. Later weeks in the course will examine publishing trends in nonfiction and identify career paths for students wishing to further explore the scholarship of nonfiction.

Students will explore different techniques for reading drama through a literary lense, including the overlap of reading for history, reading for theory, reading for pleasure, and reading as a preparation for the eventual staging of drama. Students can expect to encounter a range of drama presented in such a way that learning outcomes explore historical trends, artistic movements, critical reception, and drama's effect on culture, society, politics, and art. Students will by the end of the course have a solid foundation in comparing and contrasting styles of drama and will also be able to engage in the scholarly dialogue of analyzing dramatic literature to a depth that goes beyond appreciating the entertainment value of a good play.

One variation will focus on Literature and Censorship by first considering general arguments for and against censorship and then by examining texts by writers who sought publication in their own country but whose books were censored or banned. The course will consider such questions as, Are there ever legitimate grounds for censorship? How do standards of censorship differ between countries? What is the relation between censorship on political and on moral grounds? What does artistic merit have to do with concern about moral or political subversion? Works from England, South Africa and the United States will be read and discussed, and where available, excerpts from trial transcripts will be read in order to examine arguments for and against publication. Readings will include works by Milton, D. H. Lawrence, Alan Paton, Nadine Gordimer, Athol Fugard, Eugene O'Neill, Henry Miller, and Alan Ginsberg.Another variation will focus on war and gender in 20th century American literature by examining the ways male and female authors write about war. Texts will vary from battlefield experiences to repercussions of war to the symbolic implications of war. Questions will be raised about literary authority: Does one need to be combatant to write about war? If not, how does one find the authority to speak, particularly as a woman? How does race and/or ethnicity complicate one's perceptions of American participation in war? Readings will include works by Ernest Hemingway, William Faulkner, Joseph Heller, Cynthia Ozick, Leslie Marmon Silko, Norman Mailer, Bobbie Mason, Tim O'Brien, and Toni Morrison.Another variation will focus specifically on the writings which emerged from the postwar African-American struggle for civil rights. The course will include not only fiction and poetry but also those speeches, sermons, editorials, and other forms of discourse to have emerged from the era. The emphasis will be both traditional literary concerns as well as on the various rhetorical strategies involved in each work. Ideally, the course would make visible to students the difficulties attendant upon any attempt to separate the concerns of rhetoric and persuasion too firmly from the concerns of literature. The course could conclude with a look at some of the various biographies, autobiographies, and histories written over the last twenty-five years, which attempt to shape our national memory.Other variations include literature as a response to Newtonian science or to Darwinism or to the American Depression or to postwar technology or to new dystopias or to AIDS or, as in the sample outline, the Civil Rights movement.

(Section subtitles may appear in the Schedule of Courses.) ENGL 403 Literature and Cultural Studies (3)(BA) This course meets the Bachelor of Arts degree requirements. Topics covered in this course will vary from semester to semester, but a broad framework will be to introduce students to literary and other texts read in relation to cultural studies. Individual instructors may take up different historical periods, while other versions may suggest ways cultural studies draws on different theoretical discourses such as rhetoric, deconstruction, feminism, or the New Historicism for its problems. All Reading Culture courses should serve as an introduction to cultural studies, moving from theoretical to practical readings of literature and culture. In any case, a common goal would involve examining cultural studies as constituted by plural theories and ends.

One central issue will be the ways in which the external history (culture, political power, geography) of the language has impacted its internal history (spelling, pronunciation, dialect) over time. In the process, we will examine several representative English texts which illustrate significant moments in this long process of language change. Other topics will include the traces of early English vocabulary and structures in modern English, sound changes and pronunciation, English's heavy lexical borrowing from other languages, the politics of language and language use, longstanding debates over what constitutes standard English, the impact of prescriptive language guides, varieties of spoken and written English, the English language and colonialism, English as a global language, and the influence of technologies.

Enforced Prerequisite at Enrollment: ENGL 281 Advanced Seminars in Creative Writing focus on a particular genre and/or topic. Genres include poetry, fiction, graphic novel, memoir, creative non-fiction, essay, or drama. Topics vary. Students work as apprentice writers, reading the work of published and expert authors, experimenting within the genre, engaging in structured peer review and group workshops, and preparing texts for publication and contest submission. Students discuss a number of issues relevant to the practice of creative writing and the production of literature, such as innovation and circulation, and numerous techniques, including the establishment of voice, creation of character plot development, pacing, and principles of prosody. Students may also consider the responsibilities of literary citizenship and the ethics of artistic representation. The courses offer an intense investigation of creative writing craft. Students develop skills in close, critical reading through the examination of exemplary works of contemporary literature and craft analysis, often reading an entire book per week. They also learn to read analytically and practically in workshop critiques of peer writing. In workshop discussion, students engage in a range of critical and editing tasks from close reading to broad conceptualization; they develop the ability to communicate ideas clearly and extemporaneously, and to negotiate meaning with others. Students experiment with and hone various writing techniques by executing focused exercises and drafting and developing pieces for final submission. They apply critical and analytical reading skills to revise and strengthen their own writing. The final project may include drafts and polished versions of two to three stories or essays, and up to a dozen poems.

ENGL 420 Writing for the Web (3)(BA) This course meets the Bachelor of Arts degree requirements. This course, designed for writers and potential writers, will explore the unique opportunities and constraints of writing for the Web. As a writing course, it should appeal to students in the Humanities; however, because of the growing importance of Web texts in fields such as business and the social sciences and given the opportunity to compose/construct a variety of fictional and non-fictional &quot;creative&quot; and informative/persuasive Web texts, this course should be of value to students across the college.In this course, students will survey a wide variety of Web texts--webs, electronic journals and books, learning to analyze these as to their efficacy in light of each text's rhetorical situation. As students learn to compose and construct such texts themselves, rhetorically based principles of audience awareness and persuasive appeal will be emphasized. Rather than focusing on writing html codes and java scripts, this course will build on the rhetorical principles taught in first-year writing courses, teaching students how to apply those principles to more sophisticated, multi-sensory, multi-media hyper textual writing.The course will be taught primarily in a hands-on workshop environment-in a PC computer lab or laptop-equipped classroom. Although no prior Web writing experience is required, some experience with Web navigation and computer word processing will be helpful. Students will be evaluated on the basis of their participation/attendance in the course's workshop environment, written web analyses, and constructed web texts.

Enforced Prerequisite at Enrollment: ENGL 412 Bachelor of Arts: Humanities Creative writing workshop focused on the environment and related issues. ENGL (ENVST) 424 Creative Writing and the Natural World (3) American literature includes a long and rich tradition of writing that focuses on the natural world. From the oral stories of indigenous people to the journals of the first European settlers, many have looked for a way to understand their own place in the world based upon their relationship to the earth and its creatures. While Puritans often discerned the pleasure or wrath of God in the environmental changes they experienced, Transcendentalists like Henry David Thoreau and Ralph Waldo Emerson sought out moments of spiritual enlightenment by immersing themselves in the natural order. More recently, such poets as Galway Kinnell, James Wright, and Robert Bly have attempted to connect with the depths of collective unconsciousness by exploring the natural world, while others, like Mary Oliver, Dan Gerber, Jim Harrison, Gary Snyder and Wendell Berry, have used transcendental thought and melded it with Christian and Buddhist insights. Still others, like Gary Paul Nabhan, Rachel Carson, and Alison Hawthorne Deming have brought science to bear upon the riches that nature, art, and scientific exploration may offer when joined in the pursuit of a deeper understanding of, and relationship with, the natural world. This course will acquaint students with the tradition of American nature writing, as well as contemporary nature writing, in the genres of nonfiction, poetry and fiction. Students will be introduced to issues of style, philosophy, and content, as they produce their own essays, poems, and stories. The course culminates in the production of a portfolio of nature writing. Much of this work will begin in class with specific assignments, which will include field work, and feedback from other students in the class. As a workshop course in creative writing, the emphasis will be upon the production of literary texts that interact with the natural world and upon the revision of those texts. Enforced Prerequisite at Enrollment: ENGL 50 or ENVST 100N Cross-listed with: ENVST 424 An in-depth study of Chicana/Chicano literature, film, and music from the inception of the Chicano Movement (1965-1975) to the present. ENGL 426 Chicana and Chicano Cultural Production: Literature, Film, and Music (3) (US)(BA) This course meets the Bachelor of Arts degree requirements. ENGL 426 will constitute an in-depth study of Chicano/a literature, film, and music from the inception of the Chicano movement (1965-1975) to the present. In addition to primary aesthetic texts, students will read historical, political, and theoretical essays designed to situate the Chicano/a cultural texts in historical and political context.The aim of the course is to give students a better understanding of Chicano/a cultural production by situating these works of art against other U. S. artistic traditions and within wider historical and political movements. Authors and artists under consideration in this class will vary, but will likely include Luis Valdez, Tomas Rivera, Estella Portillo Trambley, Oscar Zeta Acosta, Corky Gonzales, Gloria Anzaldua, Norma Alarcon, Cherrie Moraga, Richard Rodriguez, Dagoberto Gilb, Rolando Hinojosa, Alfredo Vea, Charlie Trujillo, Diego Vasquez Jr., Joe Rodriguez, Tomas Almaguer, Jose Esteban Munoz, Manuel Ramos, Lucha Corpi, Rudolfo Anaya, Michael Nave. This class will prepare students for advanced courses in Latin/a literatures as well as other academic courses that engage in the verbal and written analysis of complex texts. Students will be evaluated by means of essays written in and out of class, essay exams, group projects, term-long journals, and class participation. Students should expect to complete a minimum of three written assignments in the course of the term. The course may be used as ENGL major elective credit or as credit towards the ENGL minor and will be offered once a year with 40 seats per offering.

ENGL (J ST) 427 Topics in Jewish American Literature (3) This course will provide sustained examination of major themes, texts, and figures in the Jewish American literary tradition. The course will focus on depth rather than breadth in its analysis of the defining aspects of the literature and on what the literature reveals about Jewish American culture and identity. The United States has absorbed large numbers of Jewish immigrants from many parts of the world, holding many different ideas about Jewish practice, and affiliating themselves with many different political, social, and cultural traditions, and moreover Jews have settled and made homes in a wide variety of American communities. Close analysis of literature will therefore provide an opportunity to consider the constitution, origin, and development of Jewish America's wider cultural, political, and social contexts. Materials will consist predominantly of primary texts, including prose fiction and nonfiction, poetry, drama, and film, and the methodology will emphasize the close reading of these texts. The course complements offerings in Jewish Studies, English, and Comparative Literature. Most obviously, the course will offer students of Jewish literature, world literature, and American literature an opportunity for contextualization. It enables students in Jewish Studies to study the rich literature of American Jews, and it adds to courses covering Jewish American history, religion, and culture. The course offers students in English and Comparative Literature a valuable, sustained introduction to an important U.S. and world sub-culture and -literature.

Our goal in this class is two-fold: to orient ourselves in relation to Asian American literatures and to orient Asian American literatures in relation to other geographical formations such as the nation, the hemisphere, the transpacific, and the world. To accomplish this, we will consider how physical and geographical spaces map on to psychic and historical ones, in the process focusing on a diverse set of locations-including ethnic enclaves, detention camps, islands, the transpacific, and the hemisphere. We will engage key concepts in Asian American literary studies such as transnationalism, globalization, racialization, imperialism, history, culture, and postracialism. Additionally, we will think about how issues of identity, belonging, contestation, aesthetics, diaspora, and genre are critical to Asian American literary production. Finally, we will interrogate the constructed, pan-ethnic nature of \"Asian America\" as itself an imagined nation. In the process, we will familiarize ourselves with the richness and diversity of Asian American literature by considering a variety of genres, including short stories, novels, drama, memoir, comics, and film. In encouraging students to develop understanding of the historical backgrounds, cultural and scientific contributions, economic, social, psychological, and political circumstances of Asian Americans, they will 1) Learn to see nations, cultures, and/or social identities not in isolation, but in relation to each other; 2) Gain increased knowledge of different cultural values, traditions, beliefs, and customs; 3) Appreciate the diversity that exists among persons who share a particular social identity; 4) Recognize and be sensitive to the different ways social identities have been valued; 5) Increase their understanding of stereotypes and biases; and 6) Increase their awareness of the nature of social justice and equity. These goals are supported by every aspect of the course: the reading list, the in-class conversation and lectures, the collaborative projects, the quizzes and exams, and the analytical essays. Students are not simply exposed to texts and topics but must demonstrate engagement with, understanding of, and critical analysis in relation to the course's focus.

Departing from Concord, the course will explore Walt Whitman and Emily Dickinson, both of whom read and were inspired by Emerson. Finally, the course will include works by Herman Melville, who formed a friendship with Hawthorne prior to writing Moby-Dick. Though literature constitutes the center piece of this course, iterations of the course may bring in other parts of the cultural, social, and political landscape: slavery, abolitionism, Jacksonian Democracy, western settlement, art, science, and technology.

Percy Bysshe Shelley contended that \"poets are the unacknowledged legislators of the world,\" while John Keats declared that \"beauty is truth, truth beauty.\" Against the background of political revolution in France, the rise of industrialization and empire, and increasing social instability, Romantic writers turned to nature as a source of the self and looked back to childhood as a site of both innocence and ambivalence. Others turned their efforts to the supernatural and the gothic, hoping to inspire what Samuel Taylor Coleridge called \"that willing suspension of disbelief for the moment which constitutes poetic faith.\" This course is designed to provide an introduction to the richness and diversity of Romantic-era literature. It is not intended to be an exhaustive overview of the entire period, but rather an introduction to the best known Romantic ideas' many of which still influence the way we think about art and literature in the present day as well as an invitation to further study and engagement. In that spirit, we will not work from a predetermined definition of \"romanticism,\" but instead will build a collective, working understanding of the concept.

This course examines the Israel-Palestine conflict through an analysis of literature written by participants, victims, bystanders, and observers. We will read literature by Arabs, Jews, and Christian; by Israelis, Palestinians, and other populations affected by the conflict; and by writers in the Arab World, Europe, and the Americas in order to develop a nuanced understanding of the conflict, its history, what's at stake for its participants, antagonists, and victims. The course will emphasize close reading and aesthetic analysis, but it will also pay attention to the ways in which literature can be used to think about history, experience, and politics. The course will survey a wide array of writing from a diverse set of global traditions, including significant figures, themes, and histories, and the course will pay attention to literature's intersections with migration history, international politics, faith, nationalism, and revolutionary liberation. The course will showcase national and religious diversity. We will focus on the relationship of writing of and about the Israel-Palestine conflict to other subfields and literary study more generally, including issues such as ethnicity, culture, religion, diaspora, gender, politics, and identity. A major emphasis of the course will be on analyzing literary texts as lenses to reflect, refract, and focus on Arab, Jewish, and Palestinian identity. In addition, by way of analyzing the interrelationships between literary representation and experience, the course will attend to a number of key themes in how we think about Diaspora, with some special emphasis on American literature about the Israel-Palestine conflict: how have American writers, and especially American writers of Arab, Jewish, and Muslim heritage, articulated their identities in relation to the Israel-Palestine conflict and the Middle East more generally, including the long history of US involvement in the Middle East? The course will cover both English-language literature and literature in translation from other languages.

Cross-listed with: JST 459 Bachelor of Arts: Humanities Bachelor of Arts: World Cultures International Cultures (IL) General Education: Humanities (GH) GenEd Learning Objective: Crit and Analytical Think GenEd Learning Objective: Global Learning An investigation into how writers and the cultures in which they write have represented business and those engaged in it. For many people, literature and business could not have less to do with each other. According to this view, literature escapes from reality to the imaginative, while nothing could be more focused on the real than business and its buying and selling of commodities and services. The problem is that no one told literary writers of this mutual incompatibility. For centuries, writers have peered into the world of business and brought back stories intended to document, inspire, and warn. True, writers have often, and sometimes unthinkingly, condemned business and those who follow it, but they have just as often had genuine insights into its workings. In this course, we will follow the relationship between literature and business over the course of modern history. Although one version of the course would begin with literature that dates back to the invention of capitalism in (more or less) the sixteenth century, our course will begin at the turn of the nineteenth century with the Industrial Revolution in England and the United States and follow the literature of business up to the present. Our aim in reading is not just to understand how writers have represented business and those who pursue it, which, it has to be admitted, has often been with contempt. But, rather, in reading more sympathetic works, to understand the drama of business, why those who pursue it find it so invigorating. Money, of course, is one answer to that question, but it is neither the only nor the most important one. Texts may vary, but they are almost certain to include Charles Dickens's Dombey and Son (1847); Herman Melville's \"Bartleby the Scrivener\" (1853); the \"Economy\" chapter of Henry David Thoreau's Walden (1854); Anthony Trollope's The Way We Live Now (1875); Thorstein Veblen's Theory of the Leisure Class (1899); George Bernard Shaw's Major Barbara (1905); Theodore Dreiser's The Financier (1912); Sinclair Lewis's Babbitt (1922); Edwin Lefevre's Reminiscences of a Stock Operator (1922); James M. Cain's hardboiled masterpiece Mildred Pierce (1941); F. Scott Fitzgerald's unfinished novel The Love of the Last Tycoon (1941); Arthur Miller's Death of a Salesman (1949); Sloan Wilson's The Man in the Gray Flannel Suit (1955); Ayn Rand's Atlas Shrugged (1957); Ken Kesey's Sometimes a Great Notion (1962); Joseph Heller's Something Happened (1974); William Gaddis's J R (1975); David Mamet's Glengarry Glen Ross (1984); Michael Lewis's Liars Poker (1987); and Richard Powers' Gain (1998).

ENGL 463 African American Autobiography (3) (US)(BA) This course meets the Bachelor of Arts degree requirements. Starting with the slave narratives which initiate the literary quest of African Americans for identity, this upper-division course will examine the trope of writing (the &quot;talking&quot; book) as the (w)rite of passage into the dominant Euro-American culture. The course will identify, describe, and analyze how the major elements of the &quot;quest&quot; found in the slave autobiographies have been adapted as textual strategies by many contemporary African American writers of autobiography, semi-autobiography, and fictional autobiography. Authors under consideration will vary from class to class, but may include writers such as Frederick Douglass, Harriet Jacobs, W. E. B. Du Bois, Ida B. Wells, Richard Wright, Zora Neale Hurston, Maya Angelou, Martin Luther King, Alex Haley, Harriet E. Wilson, James Weldon Johnson, and Ernest Gaines. Topics explored will vary from class to class, but will likely consider slave narratives, the role of autobiography in the fashioning of identity and self, gender issues, genre questions, and the historical development of the genre and its shifting preoccupation from slave times through the early twentieth-century, the pre-Civil Rights era, the Civil Rights Movement, the Black Power Movement, and the present. The course will prepare students for other courses that engage in the verbal and written analysis of complex written texts, and will also prepare students to consider the social and cultural issues involved in the role of race in American history. Students will be evaluated by means of essays written out of class, essay and short answer exams, a term-long reading journal reflecting upon issues of the student's own &quot;autobiography,&quot; an oral class presentation, and class participation.

From the earliest novels, written during the period of slavery, through the Reconstruction era, the nadir of Black Codes and Jim Crow Supreme Court decisions, and into the Renaissance heralded by Alain Locke and others, course readings encompass a broad range of styles and genres, from early proto-documentary modes, through the realism and naturalism of a later time. The course takes up Robert S. Levine's claim that \"the history of the early African American novel is not fixed or stable\" by mapping the genre's early history and by developing an understanding of the novel as genre according to both early African American authors and later scholars. It addresses the fact that this history continues to be updated and that some texts whether in part or in whole remain lost. Authors covered in the course might include William Wells Brown, Frederick Douglass, Frank J. Webb, Julia C. Collins, Hannah Crafts, Martin Delany, Frances Ellen Watkins Harper, Charles Chesnutt, Pauline Hopkins, Paul Laurence Dunbar, Sutton Griggs, James Weldon Johnson, Oscar Micheaux, Nella Larsen, Jessie Fauset, and others. Scholarly readings accompany primary texts in order to give students a sense of the critical work that has gone into and continues to go on in the study of African American literature. Course topics may include the issue of firsts; the challenges of publication and the attendant realities of early African American print cultures; questions of tradition and influence; and the political, social, religious, and philosophical aims of early African American novels. Readings and discussions also attend to questions of form, specifically regarding intertextuality and generic blurring and hybridity. The study of early African American novels necessarily includes attention to issues of race, identity, nation, diaspora, and the question of authenticity, and each is taken up in turn. Course assignments and discussions engage students in critical work that demands careful attention to both content and context in order that all students might strengthen their close reading capabilities and engage with course figures and materials within their historical milieus.

It follows the genre's evolution into the twenty-first century, outlining the relationships among the texts that form the body of African American narrative as well as the relationships of those texts to the constantly shifting cultural and political realities surrounding their writing. From the Renaissance heralded by Alain Locke, through the Civil Rights and Black Power Movements -and their attendant Black Arts Movement- and into the era of the Movement for Black Lives, course readings encompass a broad range of styles and genres, from realism, naturalism, and naturalist primitivism, through the experimental forms, magical realism, and \"postrace aesthetics\" of later times. The course invites students to think critically about the African American novel as a socially and politically engaged form, and to identify and analyze the long tradition of resistance that variously informs its development. Authors covered in the course might include major figures such as Claude McKay, Zora Neale Hurston, Nella Larsen, Wallace Thurman, Richard Wright, Ralph Ellison, Ann Petry, James Baldwin, Ishmael Reed, Earnest Gaines, Alice Walker, Toni Morrison, Toni Cade Bambara, Octavia Butler, Gayle Jones, Samuel Delany, Charles Johnson, John Edgar Wideman, Colson Whitehead, and others. Still, the course gives due attention to lesser known/studied materials from the period, including graphic novels, satire, speculative fiction, performance novels, and various other experimental forms. Course readings and instruction give particular attention to how African American novels of the twentieth and twenty-first centuries variously engage social identity categories, like race, gender, class, and sexuality, and how they engage and resist various literary conventions associated with naturalism, modernism, and postmodernism. The course also traces the development of new thematic and aesthetic interests in a generation of writers whose fiction has been influenced by the explosion of interest in the graphic novel, the popularity of cultural forms such as hip hop, and the ascendancy of the digital age. Scholarly readings accompany primary texts to give students a sense of the critical work that has gone into and continues to go on in the study of African American literature. In this course, students learn how to analyze literature, do close and careful readings of texts, conduct related research, and write persuasively about literary works. Assignments and discussions are designed such that students may engage with course figures and materials within their historical milieus.

The myriad aesthetic forms and concomitant political functions of black poetry and poetics should be seriously considered as grounds for broader and more nuanced theoretical and sociocultural claims.\" This course takes as its subject matter these aesthetic forms and political functions of the poetry of black America. It surveys the broad history of African American poetry and poetics, tracing the evolution of formal structures and aesthetics, but also taking a critical view of the reception of African American verse. Whether reading Phillis Wheatley or the contemporary poet Ed Roberson, all the poets included in this course have contended within the writing itself with the racially striated nature of the literary spaces they occupy. Course readings may come from poets including Wheatley, Frances Ellen Watkins Harper, Paul Laurence Dunbar, Alice Dunbar Nelson, Claude McKay, Langston Hughes, Robert Hayden, Melvin Tolson, Gwendolyn Brooks, Amiri Baraka, John Coltrane, Ishmael Reed, Nathaniel Mackey, Rita Dove, Maya Angelou, Audre Lorde, Natasha Tretheway, Sonia Sanchez, Nikki Giovanni, Nikky Finney, Roberson, Claudia Rankine, and others. The course addresses works by many of the key figures of this American literary tradition so that students may develop an understanding of the various contributions and legacies formal, musical, cultural, critical, political of African American poetry from the eighteenth century to today. Scholarly readings accompany primary texts to give students a sense of the critical work that has gone into and continues to go on in the study of African American poetry and poetics. The course surveys early African American poetry through works from the Harlem Renaissance and the Black Arts Movement, and through contemporary movements and formations. Topics will cover a range of thematic and formal issues relevant to individual poets, to major movements and periods, to regions, and to various smaller organizations and collectives. Course assignments, lectures, and discussions engage students in critical work that requires careful attention to form, content, and context such that all students might strengthen their explicatory skills and approach course figures and texts from an informed, analytical perspective.

Harper, James Weldon Johnson, Langston Hughes, Claude McKay, Sterling Brown, Booker T. Washington, Harriet Jacobs, W. W. Brown, Harriet Wilson, Margaret Walker, Arna Bontemps, D. Bradley, S. A. Williams, Toni Morrison, Ishmael Reed, and Charles Johnson. The course will focus on the complex relationship of slavery to the literary imagination of Americans of African descent as they increasingly discovered the limitations and possibilities of reading and writing themselves into freedom, literacy, and wholeness as human beings and American citizens. Topics covered will vary, but will include issues of the legacy of slavery in the west; the political aims and rhetorical conventions of African-American autobiography; the myths and realities of slavery; economic, political, ethical, and aesthetic issues of the representation of slavery; understandings of black consciousness and black culture on the road from slavery to freedom; the rise of African American realism as a response to the legacy of slavery; Black Feminism and issues of slavery; the role of history and memory in the construction of slavery; post-modern configurations of slavery; and the like.

Let's say you are a student who has always dreamed of combining help for food-insecure people with support for the mentally ill homeless. You've written papers about it for classes; you've read lots of research that points to past pitfalls and future innovative possibilities--but now you want to make it real by finding funding for the program you've envisioned. Or maybe you have your sights set on finding an existing non-profit foundation that might serve as a fiscal conduit for grants that will feed the cause you feel passionately about. These scenarios and many others call for finding and winning a grant. Here's what grants can't do: Write themselves. Given that writers of grants do not have one how-to professional manual to rely on, professional grant-seekers must learn to have flexible responses to a variety of writing situations. Every grant proposal is different, as is every population with a problem to solve, and every organization hoping to help with the solution. A successful grant-writer achieves confidence with hands-on practice-confidence earned from mastering the underlying principles of effective research and outreach; feasible and complete content-generation; and the writing of precise, clear, audience-centered prose. English 478 will provide you with the basic knowledge and practice needed to get you on your way to professional confidence. Six Main Learning Goals: * Comprehensive understanding of the grant-writing field * Strategic use of research skills to match program to foundation, need to grant-maker * Beginning mastery of all elements of the basic proposal, including: mission match, objectives that fill a proven need, evaluation strategies that reliably measure outcome, a feasible budget, and proof of capacity and sustainability * Practice of skills most needed in the current economic and political climate, including collaboration, diversified funding, and innovation within an established organization * Practical use of social media and cultivation skills for sustainability of project * Mastery of applied rhetorical style emphasizing clarity and precision Enforced Prerequisite at Enrollment: (ENGL 15 or ENGL 15A or ENGL 15S or ENGL 15E or ESL 15 or ENGL 30H or ENGL 30T or ENGL 137H or CAS 137H) and (ENGL 202A or ENGL 202B or ENGL 202C or ENGL 202D) This course explores visual design, non-verbal communication, and software packages used in professional settings to most effectively present written communications.

ENGL 486 The World Novel in English (3) (IL) This course examines the nature of the novel as written in English by writers outside of the United States and Great Britain. Such a study necessarily involves both an aesthetic and a political perspective, in that the tradition of the novel in these landscapes so often involves the aesthetic and political suppression of native literary forms and voices. Thus, this course looks at the novel as written both by the colonizer and by the colonized. It considers the politics of the aboriginal author writing in an adopted language, and the ways in which such an adoption bears upon related ethnic and gender matters; it also considers the sorts of artistic and political tensions that emerge in the work of writers who write in what might be called the dominant English tradition. This course also studies the work of what might be called the multi-cultural writer, or the writer perforce extracted from a native, non-English-speaking culture and placed within a larger, colonial, English-speaking culture. Matters of novelistic form, as they are related to ethnic and cultural identity, are also discussed. One intent of the course is to reveal the cultural, racial, and gender diversity that naturally adheres to these particular literary traditions.

ENGL (WMNST) 489 British Women Writers (3) This course provides the opportunity to study writing by British Women from a historical perspective and to explore the views these women have of themselves as artists. The course will concentrate on a careful reading of works by a variety of authors. It will address the question of the role gender plays in the selection of literary forms and the development of character, theme, symbols, and rhetorical strategies. It will also explore what particular dimensions British women writers have brought to the British literary tradition.Students will be active learners through keeping reading journals, presenting background reports on the history of women in England, participating in small-group discussions about the texts, and writing 2 shorter essays and one longer research essay for the class. This course focuses on an area of British literature, which more traditionally structured courses tend to obscure. The course will be attractive to students from a variety of programs, including English majors, Women's Studies minors, and Interdisciplinary Humanities students. The course will be offered once every two years. Estimated class size 20.

ENGL (WMNST) 490 Women Writers and Their Worlds (3) (US;IL)(BA) This course meets the Bachelor of Arts degree requirements. ENGL/WMNST 490 covers particular aspects of American and British literature written from the perspective of women. The courses stress the diversity of women's authorial worlds, both through time and/or space. The readings and specific focus vary from semester to semester. ENGL/WMNST 490 seeks to make students aware of the extensive body of literature written by women, but, unlike ENGL 194, which is a survey course of women's literature, ENGL/WMNST 490 can be a more intensive course, focusing on selected themes and topics of particular concern to women as reflected in the poetry and fiction of twentieth-century American and British women writers. The class can also be taught in relationship to earlier periods, dealing, for instance, with English women novelists from 1775-1865. In such a class, readings would include fiction by Fanny Burney, Mary Wolistonecraft, Ann Radcliffe, Jane Austen, Mary Shelly, Emily Bronte, Elizabeth Gaskell, and George Eliot. The course would then place each novel in its historical, social, intellectual, and literary context, and explore the various ways in which some of England's best writers transformed their female experience of the world into fiction that extended the range and influenced the development of the novel. Regardless of the particular focus, all sections of the course pose the following questions throughout: Do women use the same myths, archetypes, and literary conventions as male writers? Or do they sometimes have to modify the myths, archetypes, and literary conventions originated by their male precursors in order to adapt them to female experience? Is there such a thing as a distinctively female imagination, with a symbolic language of its own? Is there such a thing as a chain of literary influence linking women writers to each other? What are the strategies for coping with the anxieties of authorship? What is the interaction between gender and genre? In what ways are creativity and procreativity modes of defying prevailing ideologies? Does a woman's psychological development have an effect on the plots a woman novelist conceives? How does women's literature reflect the realities of women's lives? As a course in women's literature, ENGL/WMNST 490 concerns itself with questions of gender. In so far as some of these women writers are black or women of color, it concerns itself with questions of race and ethnicity. In as far as the course looks at women's literature in the context of men's literature, it is concerned with the inter-relationship between dominant (male) and non-dominant (female) culture in the United States as well as in Britain. In so far as the course covers lesbian writers, it is concerned with sexual orientation. Students should expect to complete a minimum of three written assignments in the course, two course papers, and an essay final exam in class. The papers each will ask students to choose a text to analyze in relationship to one of the thematic modules the course has chosen, for instance, to discuss how Virginia Woolf s Mrs. Dalloway analyzes the position of upper-middle class women in a particular moment in history when women had achieved the vote, but were still largely constrained by patriarchal social norms. In addition to written assignments, students will be evaluated on class discussion and general participation. The course not only prepares students for taking up literary and cultural analysis in English classes, but also in any other class that engages in the verbal and written analysis of complex written texts, and in other classes in Women's Studies or in other Penn State departments that address the social, cultural, or ethical issues of gender. The course may be used as English Major elective credit or as credit towards the English Minor; it may also be used in the Women's Studies major and minor. It will be offered once a year with 40 seats per offering.
