                "content": "28 Years Later is an upcoming post-apocalyptic horror film directed by Danny Boyle, who co-wrote the screenplay with Alex Garland. It is the third installment in the 28 Days Later film series, following 28 Days Later (2002) and 28 Weeks Later (2007). Cillian Murphy reprises his role from the first film and stars alongside Aaron Taylor-Johnson, Jodie Comer, Ralph Fiennes, Jack O'Connell, Erin Kellyman, and Edvin Ryding. Produced by Columbia Pictures[3] in association with the British Film Institute, Decibel Films, and DNA Films, 28 Years Later marks the returns of Boyle and Garland as director and writer after they served only as executive producers on the second film. It is scheduled to be released in the United States by Sony Pictures Releasing on June 20, 2025. It was shot on an iPhone back-to-back with its sequel 28 Years Later Part II: The Bone Temple, which will be directed by Nia DaCosta, written and produced by Boyle and Garland, and starring Murphy. Twenty eight years after the events of 28 Weeks Later, the Rage Virus has returned, and a group of survivors must face a world ravaged by hordes of the infected.[4] In June 2007, Fox Atomic confirmed development on a third 28 Days Later film, dependent upon the financial performance of 28 Weeks Later following its home video release.[5] In July of the same year, Danny Boyle said that the story for a third installment had been mapped out.[6] By October 2010, Alex Garland stated that due to differences involving the film rights, the project had been delayed.[7] In January 2011, Boyle stated that he believed the project would be realized, stating confirming further developments for the story.[8] By April 2013, however, the filmmaker expressed uncertainty as to whether the movie would be made.[9] In January 2015, Garland addressed the project's status, confirming that while it had fallen into development hell there were serious discussions going on behind the scenes to produce the project. Reiterating that development was progressing, stating that the script he was working on would tentatively be titled 28 Months Later.[10] In June 2019, Boyle confirmed that he and Garland had been working on the third installment.[11] In March 2020, Imogen Poots expressed interest in reprising her role from the second film,[12] followed by Cillian Murphy in May 2021.[13] In November 2022, Boyle, Garland and actor Murphy all indicated their interest in making a sequel to 28 Days Later.[14] In June 2023, Boyle and Garland expressed in collaboration their intentions to \"seriously\" and \"diligently\" see the project enter production; while announcing that the script was now titled 28 Years Later, acknowledging the years it had taken to be developed. Boyle stated that he would like to serve as director, unless Garland chooses to.[15] By July of the same year, Murphy stated that he had recently discussed the possibility of a third film with Boyle; once again expressing interest in reprising his role if Boyle and Garland return to the franchise in their creative roles.[16] In January 2024, it was announced that a third film titled 28 Years Later was officially in development; with plans for the project to be the first of a new trilogy of sequels. Danny Boyle will direct the first installment, with a script written by Alex Garland; while the latter will also write the scripts for each of planned sequels. Boyle, Garland, Andrew Macdonald, and Peter Rice will serve as producers.[17][18] In February of the same year, Murphy discussed his potential involvement with the project.[19] In March 2024, Garland confirmed that he is writing a trilogy of sequel films.[20] The following month, the writer stated that the film Kes was a major influence on his work for 28 Years Later.[21] Murphy was revealed as an executive producer later that month.[22] In April, Aaron Taylor-Johnson, Jodie Comer and Ralph Fiennes were cast to star it,[23] with Jack O'Connell joining the cast,[24] and Murphy being confirmed to reprise his role as Jim.[25] Erin Kellyman would be added to the cast in June.[26] Principal photography began on May 7, 2024, in Northumberland,[27][28] with Anthony Dod Mantle serving as the cinematographer.[29] Filming wrapped on July 29.[30] The film was notably shot on an iPhone 15 Pro Max with the aid of numerous specialised attachments.[31] Filming locations include Holy Island (Lindisfarne) off the Northumberland Coast (the village and the causeway seen in aerial view in the first trailer), Hexham, Bellingham, Kielder Forest, Rothbury (Northumberland), Newcastle upon Tyne (Tyne and Wear), Waskerley (County Durham), Melsonby, Ripon , Fountains Abbey, Aysgarth Falls, Redmire (North Yorkshire) and Bradford (West Yorkshire).[32][33][34][35][36] Some scenes were filmed at Plankey Mill Farm, near Langley and Bardon Mill (Northumberland).[33] 28 Years Later is scheduled to be released in the United States and Canada by Sony Pictures Releasing on June 20, 2025.[37] In April 2024, Nia DaCosta entered early negotiations to direct the second film in the new trilogy of sequels, with Boyle, Garland, Andrew Macdonald, Peter Rice, and Bernie Bellew attached as producers.[38] The following month, DaCosta was confirmed to have signed onto the project as director. The movie is filming back-to-back with 28 Years Later,[38] with principal photography beginning on August 19, 2024.[39] The film's title was revealed as 28 Years Later Part II: The Bone Temple.[40]",

                "content": "The UEFA Champions League (abbreviated as UCL) is an annual club association football competition organised by the Union of European Football Associations (UEFA) that is contested by top-division European clubs. The competition begins with a round robin league phase to qualify for the double-legged knockout rounds, and a single-leg final. It is the most-watched club competition in the world and the third most-watched football competition overall, behind only the UEFA European Championship and the FIFA World Cup. It is one of the most prestigious football tournaments in the world and the most prestigious club competition in European football, played by the national league champions (and, for some nations, one or more runners-up) of their national associations. Introduced in 1955 as the Coupe des Clubs Champions Européens (French for European Champion Clubs' Cup), and commonly known as the European Cup, it was initially a straight knockout tournament open only to the champions of Europe's domestic leagues, with its winner reckoned as the European club champion. The competition took on its current name in 1992, adding a round-robin group stage in 1991 and allowing multiple entrants from certain countries since the 1997–98 season.[1] While only the winners of many of Europe's national leagues can enter the competition, the top 5 leagues by coefficient provide four teams each by default,[2] with a possibility for additional spots based on performance during the previous season.[3][4] Clubs that finish below the qualifying spots are eligible for the second-tier UEFA Europa League competition, and since 2021, for the third-tier UEFA Conference League.[5] In its present format, the Champions League begins in early July with three qualifying rounds and a play-off round, all played over two legs. The seven surviving teams enter the league phase, joining 29 teams qualified in advance. The 36 teams each play eight opponents, four home and four away. The 24 highest-ranked teams proceed to the knockout phase that culminates with the final match in late May or early June.[6] The winner of the Champions League automatically qualifies for the following year's Champions League, the UEFA Super Cup, the FIFA Intercontinental Cup and the FIFA Club World Cup.[7][8] Spanish clubs have the most victories (20 wins), followed by England (15 wins) and Italy (12 wins). England has the most winning teams, with six clubs having won the title. The competition has been won by 23 clubs and 13 of them have won it more than once.[9] Real Madrid is the most successful club in the tournament's history, having won it 15 times. Madrid is the only club to have won it five times in a row (the first five editions).[10] Only one club has won all of their matches in a single tournament en route to the tournament victory: Bayern Munich in the 2019–20 season.[11] Real Madrid is the current European champion, having beaten Borussia Dortmund 2–0 in the 2024 final for their fifteenth title. The first time the champions of two European leagues met was in what was nicknamed the 1895 World Championship, when English champions Sunderland beat Scottish champions Heart of Midlothian 5–3.[12] The first pan-European tournament was the Challenge Cup, a competition between clubs in the Austro-Hungarian Empire.[13] Three years later, in 1900, the champions of Belgium, Netherlands and Switzerland, which were the only existing leagues in continental Europe at the time, participated in the Coupe Van der Straeten Ponthoz, thus being dubbed as the \"club championship of the continent\" by the local newspapers.[14][15] The Mitropa Cup, a competition modelled after the Challenge Cup, was created in 1927, an idea of Austrian Hugo Meisl, and played between Central European clubs.[16] In 1930, the Coupe des Nations (French: Nations Cup), the first attempt to create a cup for national champion clubs of Europe, was played and organised by Swiss club Servette.[17] Held in Geneva, it brought together ten champions from across the continent. The tournament was won by Újpest of Hungary.[17] Latin European nations came together to form the Latin Cup in 1949.[18] After receiving reports from his journalists over the highly successful South American Championship of Champions of 1948, Gabriel Hanot, editor of L'Équipe, began proposing the creation of a continent-wide tournament.[19] In interviews, Jacques Ferran (one of the founders of the European Champions Cup, together with Gabriel Hanot),[20] said that the South American Championship of Champions was the inspiration for the European Champions Cup.[21] After Stan Cullis declared Wolverhampton Wanderers \"Champions of the World\" following a successful run of friendlies in the 1950s, in particular a 3–2 friendly victory against Budapest Honvéd, Hanot finally managed to convince UEFA to put into practice such a tournament.[1] It was conceived in Paris in 1955 as the European Champion Clubs' Cup.[1] The first European Cup took place during the 1955–56 season.[22][23] Sixteen teams participated (some by invitation): AC Milan (Italy), AGF Aarhus (Denmark), Anderlecht (Belgium), Djurgården (Sweden), Gwardia Warszawa (Poland), Hibernian (Scotland), Partizan (Yugoslavia), PSV Eindhoven (Netherlands), Rapid Wien (Austria), Real Madrid (Spain), Rot-Weiss Essen (West Germany), Saarbrücken (Saar), Servette (Switzerland), Sporting CP (Portugal), Reims (France) and Vörös Lobogó (Hungary).[22][23] The first European Cup match took place on 4 September 1955, and ended in a 3–3 draw between Sporting CP and Partizan.[22][23] The first goal in European Cup history was scored by João Baptista Martins of Sporting CP.[22][23] The inaugural final took place at the Parc des Princes between Stade de Reims and Real Madrid on 13 June 1956.[22][23][24] The Spanish squad came back from behind to win 4–3 thanks to goals from Alfredo Di Stéfano and Marquitos, as well as two goals from Héctor Rial.[22][23][24] Real Madrid successfully defended the trophy next season in their home stadium, the Santiago Bernabéu, against Fiorentina.[25][26] After a scoreless first half, Real Madrid scored twice in six minutes to defeat the Italians.[24][25][26] In 1958, Milan failed to capitalise after going ahead on the scoreline twice, only for Real Madrid to equalise.[27][28] The final, held in Heysel Stadium, went to extra time where Francisco Gento scored the game-winning goal to allow Real Madrid to retain the title for the third consecutive season.[24][27][28] In a rematch of the first final, Real Madrid faced Stade Reims at the Neckarstadion for the 1959 final, and won 2–0.[24][29][30] West German side Eintracht Frankfurt became the first team not to compete in the Latin cup to reach the European Cup final.[18][31][32] The 1960 final holds the record for the most goals scored, with Real Madrid beating Eintracht Frankfurt 7–3 at Hampden Park, courtesy of four goals by Ferenc Puskás and a hat-trick by Alfredo Di Stéfano.[24][31][32] This was Real Madrid's fifth consecutive title, a record that still stands today.[9] Real Madrid's reign ended in the 1960–61 season when bitter rivals Barcelona dethroned them in the first round.[33][34] Barcelona were defeated in the final by Portuguese side Benfica 3–2 at the Wankdorf Stadium.[33][34][35] Reinforced by Eusébio, Benfica defeated Real Madrid 5–3 at the Olympic Stadium in Amsterdam and kept the title for a second consecutive season.[35][36][37] Benfica wanted to repeat Real Madrid's successful run of the 1950s after reaching the showpiece event of the 1962–63 European Cup, but a brace from Brazilian-Italian José Altafini at Wembley gave the spoils to Milan, making the trophy leave the Iberian Peninsula for the first time ever.[38][39][40] Inter Milan beat an ageing Real Madrid 3–1 at the Ernst-Happel-Stadion to win the 1963–64 season and replicate their local-rival's success.[41][42][43] The title stayed in Milan for the third year in a row after Inter beat Benfica 1–0 at their home ground, the San Siro.[44][45][46] Under the leadership of Jock Stein, Scottish club Celtic beat Inter Milan 2–1 in the 1967 final to become the first British club to win the European Cup.[47][48] The Celtic players that day, all of whom were born within 30 miles (48 km) of Glasgow, subsequently became known as the \"Lisbon Lions\".[49] The 1967–68 season saw Manchester United become the first English team to win the European Cup, beating two-times winners Benfica 4–1 in the final.[50] This final came ten years after the Munich air disaster, which had claimed the lives of eight United players and left their manager, Matt Busby, fighting for his life.[51] In the 1968–69 season, Ajax became the first Dutch team to reach the European Cup final, but they were beaten 4–1 by Milan, who claimed their second European Cup, with Pierino Prati scoring a hat-trick.[52] The 1969–70 season saw the first Dutch winners of the competition. Feyenoord knocked out the defending champions, Milan in the second round,[53] before beating Celtic in the final.[54] In the 1970–71 season, Ajax won the title, beating Greek side Panathinaikos in the final.[55] the season saw a number of changes, with penalty shoot-outs being introduced, and the away goals rule being changed so that it would be used in all rounds except the final.[56] It was also the first time a Greek team reached the final, as well as the first season that Real Madrid failed to qualify, having finished sixth in La Liga the previous season.[57] Ajax went on to win the competition three years in row (1971 to 1973), which Bayern Munich emulated from 1974 to 1976, before Liverpool won their first two titles in 1977 and 1978.[58] The following seasons saw victories in 1978–79 and 1979–80 for Brian Clough's Nottingham Forest. The following year Liverpool won their third title before Aston Villa continued the sense of English dominance in 1982. In 1982–83, Hamburger SV broke the English dominance. Liverpool regained it in 1983–84 before losing to Juventus (1984–85); Steaua București then won in 1985–86, Porto in 1986–87, PSV Eindhoven in 1987–88; Milan (2), Red Star Belgrade and Barcelona became champions before the competition was re-formulated as the UEFA Champions League. All English clubs were banned for five years (Liverpool for six years) following the 1985 European Cup final due to the Heysel Stadium disaster. \"Magic...it's magic above all else. When you hear the anthem it captivates you straight away.\" The UEFA Champions League anthem, officially titled simply as \"Champions League\", was written by Tony Britten, and is an adaptation of George Frideric Handel's 1727 anthem Zadok the Priest (one of his Coronation Anthems).[60][61] UEFA commissioned Britten in 1992 to arrange an anthem, and the piece was performed by London's Royal Philharmonic Orchestra and sung by the Academy of St. Martin in the Fields.[60] Stating that \"the anthem is now almost as iconic as the trophy\", UEFA's official website adds it is \"known to set the hearts of many of the world's top footballers aflutter\".[60] The chorus contains the three official languages used by UEFA: English, German, and French.[62] The climactic moment is set to the exclamations 'Die Meister! Die Besten! Les Grandes Équipes! The Champions!'.[63] The anthem's chorus is played before each UEFA Champions League game as the two teams are lined up, as well as at the beginning and end of television broadcasts of the matches. In addition to the anthem, there is also entrance music, which contains parts of the anthem itself, which is played as teams enter the field.[64] The complete anthem is about three minutes long, and has two short verses and the chorus.[62] Special vocal versions have been performed live at the Champions League final with lyrics in other languages, changing over to the host nation's language for the chorus. These versions were performed by Andrea Bocelli (Italian; Rome 2009, Milan 2016 and Cardiff 2017), Juan Diego Flores (Spanish; Madrid 2010), All Angels (Wembley 2011), Jonas Kaufmann and David Garrett (Munich 2012) and Mariza (Lisbon 2014). In the 2013 final at Wembley, the chorus was played twice. In the 2018 and 2019 finals, held in Kyiv and Madrid respectively, the instrumental version of the chorus was played, by 2Cellos (2018) and Asturia Girls (2019).[65][66] In the 2023 final, held in Istanbul, Hungarian pianist Ádám György performed the piano version of the anthem.[67] The anthem has been released commercially in its original version on iTunes and Spotify with the title of Champions League Theme. In 2018, composer Hans Zimmer remixed the anthem with rapper Vince Staples for EA Sports' video game FIFA 19, with it also featuring in the game's reveal trailer.[68] In 1991, UEFA asked its commercial partner, Television Event and Media Marketing (TEAM), to help brand the Champions League. This resulted in the anthem, \"house colours\" of black and white or silver and a logo, and the \"starball\". The starball was created by Design Bridge, a London-based firm selected by TEAM after a competition.[69] TEAM gives particular attention to detail in how the colours and starball are depicted at matches. According to TEAM, \"Irrespective of whether you are a spectator in Moscow or Milan, you will always see the same stadium dressing materials, the same opening ceremony featuring the 'starball' centre circle ceremony, and hear the same UEFA Champions League Anthem\". Based on research it conducted, TEAM concluded that by 1999, \"the starball logo had achieved a recognition rate of 94 percent among fans\".[70] The UEFA Champions League used to begin with a double round-robin group stage of 32 teams until it evolved into a league phase of 36 teams, which is preceded by two qualification 'streams' for teams that do not receive direct entry to the tournament proper. The two streams are divided between teams qualified by virtue of being league champions, and those qualified by virtue of finishing second, third or fourth in their national championship. The number of teams that each association enters into the UEFA Champions League is based upon the UEFA coefficients of the member associations. These coefficients are generated by the results of clubs representing each association during the previous five Champions League, Europa League and Conference League seasons. The higher an association's coefficient, the more teams represent the association in the Champions League, and the fewer qualification rounds the association's teams must compete in. Five of the remaining seven qualifying places are granted to the winners of a four-round qualifying tournament between the remaining 43 or 44 national champions, within which those champions from associations with higher coefficients receive byes to later rounds. The other two are granted to the winners of a three-round qualifying tournament between ten and eleven clubs from the associations ranked 5–6 through 15, which have qualified based upon finishing second, third or fourth in their respective national league. In addition to sporting criteria, any club must be licensed by its national association to participate in the Champions League. To obtain a license, the club must meet certain stadium, infrastructure and finance requirements. In 2005–06, Liverpool and Artmedia Bratislava became the first teams to reach the Champions League group stage after playing in all three qualifying rounds. Real Madrid and Barcelona hold the record for the most appearances in the group stage, having qualified 25 times, followed by Porto and Bayern Munich on 24.[71] Between 1999 and 2008, no differentiation was made between champions and non-champions in qualification. The 16 top-ranked teams spread across the biggest domestic leagues qualified directly for the tournament group stage. Prior to this, three preliminary knockout qualifying rounds whittled down the remaining teams, with teams starting in different rounds. An exception to the usual European qualification system happened in 2005, after Liverpool won the Champions League the year before, but did not finish in a Champions League qualification place in the Premier League that season. UEFA gave special dispensation for Liverpool to enter the Champions League, giving England five qualifiers.[72] UEFA subsequently ruled that the defending champions qualify for the competition the following year regardless of their domestic league placing. However, for those leagues with four entrants in the Champions League, this meant that, if the Champions League winner fell outside of its domestic league's top four, it would qualify at the expense of the fourth-placed team in the league. Until 2015–16, no association could have more than four entrants in the Champions League.[73] In May 2012, Tottenham Hotspur finished fourth in the 2011–12 Premier League, two places ahead of Chelsea, but failed to qualify for the 2012–13 Champions League, after Chelsea won the 2012 final.[74] Tottenham were demoted to the 2012–13 UEFA Europa League.[74] In May 2013,[75] it was decided that, starting from the 2015–16 season (and continuing at least for the three-year cycle until the 2017–18 season), the winners of the previous season's UEFA Europa League would qualify for the UEFA Champions League, entering at least the play-off round, and entering the group stage if the berth reserved for the Champions League title holders was not used. The previous limit of a maximum of four teams per association was increased to five, meaning that a fourth-placed team from one of the top three ranked associations would only have to be moved to the Europa League if both the Champions League and Europa League winners came from that association and both finished outside the top four of their domestic league.[76] In 2007, Michel Platini, the UEFA president, had proposed taking one place from the three leagues with four entrants and allocating it to that nation's cup winners. This proposal was rejected in a vote at a UEFA Strategy Council meeting.[77] In the same meeting, however, it was agreed that the third-placed team in the top three leagues would receive automatic qualification for the group stage, rather than entry into the third qualifying round, while the fourth-placed team would enter the play-off round for non-champions, guaranteeing an opponent from one of the top 15 leagues in Europe. This was part of Platini's plan to increase the number of teams qualifying directly into the group stage, while simultaneously increasing the number of teams from lower-ranked nations in the group stage.[78] In 2012, Arsène Wenger referred to qualifying for the Champions League by finishing in the top four places in the Premier League as the \"4th Place Trophy\". The phrase was coined after a pre-match conference when he was questioned about Arsenal's lack of a trophy after exiting the FA Cup. He said \"The first trophy is to finish in the top four\".[79] At Arsenal's 2012 AGM, Wenger was also quoted as saying: \"For me there are five trophies every season: Premier League, Champions League, the third is to qualify for the Champions League...\"[80] Beginning with the 2024–25 season, UEFA changed the format of their three club competitions, abandoning the group stage in favour of an expanded league phase.[81] The number of participating teams was increased from 32 to 36 teams. Teams are no longer divided into groups of four teams each but are ranked in a single table. Each team plays eight matches against eight different opponents. For the draw of the league phase, teams are divided into four seeding pots according to their UEFA coefficient. Each team will play against two teams from each pot, one home and one away. The league phase is played from September to January, while the knockout phase begins in February, with matches predominantly played on Tuesday and Wednesday nights. After the league phase, a two-legged knockout play-off round is played between teams finishing 9–16 (seeded) and 17–24 (unseeded) in the league phase. Teams finishing in the top eight of the league phase receive a bye to the round of 16 as seeded teams, while the eight winning teams from the knockout play-off round will enter the round of 16 draw as unseeded teams. Teams finishing 25th–36th place in the league phase and the eight losers of the knockout play-offs are eliminated from the competition and from European football since it is no longer possible to enter the Europa League from the league phase onwards. After the round of 16 the competition follows the traditional knockout format with quarter-finals, semi-finals (both two legged and without association draw protection) and then the final at a venue chosen prior to the season. The final is typically held in late May or early June. Prior to the 2024–25 season, the tournament proper began with a group stage of 32 teams, divided into eight groups of four.[82] The draw to determine which teams entered each group was seeded based on each team's UEFA coefficient, and no group could contain more than one club from each association. Each team played six group stage games, meeting the other three teams in its group home and away in a round-robin format.[82] The first place team and the runners-up from each group then progressed to the next round. The third-placed teams entered the Europa League's knockout round and the fourth-placed teams were eliminated from the competition. For the next stage – the last 16 – the winning team from one group played against the runners-up from another group, but teams from the same association could not be drawn against each other (see random two-sided matching). From the quarter-finals onwards, the draw was entirely random, without association protection.[83] The group stage was played from September to December, whilst the knockout stage began in February, with matches usually played on Tuesday and Wednesday nights. The knockout ties were played in a two-legged format, with the exception of the final. In the 2019–20 season, due to the COVID-19 pandemic the tournament was suspended for five months. The format of the remainder of the tournament was temporarily amended as a result, with the quarter-finals and semi-finals being played as single match knockout ties at neutral venues in Lisbon, Portugal in the summer with the final taking place on 23 August 2020.[84] The following is the default access list. Changes will be made to the access list above if the Champions League or Europa League title holders qualify for the tournament via their domestic leagues. Each year, the winning team is presented with the European Champion Clubs' Cup, the current version of which has been awarded since 1967. From the 1968–69 season and prior to the 2008–09 season any team that won the Champions League three years in a row or five times overall was awarded the official trophy permanently.[86] Each time a club achieved this, a new official trophy had to be forged for the following season.[87] Five clubs own a version of the official trophy: Real Madrid, Ajax, Bayern Munich, Milan and Liverpool.[86] Since 2008, the official trophy has remained with UEFA and the clubs are awarded a replica.[86] The current trophy is 74 cm (29 in) tall and made of silver, weighing 11 kg (24 lb). It was designed by Jürg Stadelmann, a jeweller from Bern, Switzerland, after the original was given to Real Madrid in 1966 in recognition of their six titles to date, and cost 10,000 Swiss francs. As of the 2012–13 season, 40 gold medals are presented to the Champions League winners, and 40 silver medals to the runners-up.[88] Starting with the 2024–25 season, the distribution of the prize money is as follows.[89] A large part of the distributed revenue from the UEFA Champions League is linked to the \"market pool\", the distribution of which is determined by the value of the television market in each nation. For the 2019–20 season, Paris Saint-Germain, who were the runners-up, earned nearly €126.8 million in total, of which €101.3 million was prize money, compared with the €125.46 million earned by Bayern Munich, who won the tournament and were awarded €112.96 million in prize money.[90] Like the FIFA World Cup, the UEFA Champions League is sponsored by a group of multinational corporations, in contrast to the single main sponsor typically found in national top-flight leagues. When the Champions League was created in 1992, it was decided that a maximum of eight companies should be allowed to sponsor the event, with each corporation being allocated four advertising boards around the perimeter of the pitch, as well as logo placement at pre- and post-match interviews and a certain number of tickets to each match. This, combined with a deal to ensure tournament sponsors were given priority on television advertisements during matches, ensured that each of the tournament's main sponsors was given maximum exposure.[91] From the 2012–13 knockout phase, UEFA used LED advertising hoardings installed in knockout participant stadiums, including the final. From the 2015–16 season onwards, UEFA has used such hoardings from the play-off round until the final.[92] Since 2021, the UEFA also used Virtual Board Replacement (VBR) technology to offer region-based advertising; regional sponsors are inserted into the hoardings as shown on the broadcast feed in specific regions along with the global sponsors.[93][94] Individual clubs may wear jerseys with advertising. However, only two sponsorships are permitted per jersey in addition to that of the kit manufacturer, at the chest and the left sleeve.[95] Exceptions are made for non-profit organisations, which can feature on the front of the shirt, incorporated with the main sponsor or in place of it; or on the back, either below the squad number or on the collar area.[96] If a club plays a match in a nation where the relevant sponsorship category is restricted (such as France's alcohol advertising restriction), then they must remove that logo from their jerseys. For example, when Rangers played French side Auxerre in the 1996–97 Champions League, they wore the logo of the holiday chain Center Parcs instead of their primary sponsor, McEwan's Lager (both companies at the time were subsidiaries of Scottish & Newcastle).[97] The tournament's main sponsors for the 2024–27 cycle are: Adidas is a secondary sponsor and supplies the official match ball, while Macron supplies the referee kits.[107] The competition attracts an extensive television audience, not just in Europe, but throughout the world. The final of the tournament has been, in recent years, the most-watched annual sporting event in the world.[108] The final of the 2012–13 tournament had the competition's highest TV ratings to date, drawing approximately 360 million television viewers.[109] Notes Players that are still active in Europe are highlighted in boldface. The table below does not include appearances made in the qualification stage of the competition. Starting from the 2021–22 edition, UEFA introduced the UEFA Champions League Player of the Season award. The jury is composed of the coaches of the clubs that participated in the group stage of the competition, as well as 55 journalists selected by the European Sports Media (ESM) group, one from each UEFA member association. In the same season, UEFA also introduced the UEFA Champions League Young Player of the Season award.",

The teams are selected because of good performances in their respective domestic leagues. The teams used to have to win their countries' league, but more than one team can play in the competition depending on how good their league is.

                "content": "An evacuation order is in place near the city of Malibu in the US state of California after a fast-moving wildfire broke out and burned hundreds of acres of vegetation. The blaze has been dubbed the Franklin Fire by authorities, who say it started in Malibu Canyon at about 22:50 local time on Monday (06:50 GMT). Firefighters are on the scene and a mandatory evacuation order is in place for a wide swathe of eastern Malibu. A shelter-in-place order applies to much of nearby Pepperdine University. It is not yet clear what caused the blaze, which has been labelled a brush fire - meaning a type of blaze that affects lower-lying vegetation such as grasses. Wildfires more generally in California have the capacity to burn through tens of thousands of acres of vegetation, meaning that this blaze is relatively small - although officials were quick to highlight its speed of spread. Malibu city authorities initially said the fire was about three miles (4.8km) north of the Pacific Coast Highway (PCH), but later spread south across the road into the Malibu Pier area. The pier itself and other structures had been affected, they said. Malibu itself is a small, upmarket city west of Los Angeles popular with wealthy celebrities. More than 1,800 acres of land have so far been burned, according to the latest update from the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection (Cal Fire). The evacuation order covered a region east of Malibu Canyon Road and South of Piuma Road as well as the Serra Retreat area, the County of Los Angeles Fire Department said. The blaze broke out near Pepperdine University. The university said its community was sheltering in place. Power to the much of the campus and wider area had been cut and was expected to stay that way for the \"foreseeable future\", it added. The latest incident comes about a month after another fire forced thousands of people to evacuate another nearby city, Moorpark. California is a state that is prone to wildfires. The amount of burned areas in the summer in northern and central California increased five times from 1996 to 2021 compared with the 24-year period before, which scientists have attributed to human-caused climate change. Not all wildfires can automatically be linked directly to climate change. The science is complicated and human factors, including how we manage land and forests, also contribute. However, scientists say that climate change is making weather conditions that lead to wildfires, such as heat and drought, more likely. Have you been asked to evacuate because of the fire?

                "content": "Manage your account A wildfire in Southern California has destroyed homes and prompted evacuations in Malibu, the iconic, affluent and mountainous beach community northwest of Los Angeles. The wildfire sprang up late Monday night had exploded in size by Tuesday morning, burning over 2,000 acres and forcing firefighters to go door-to-door to evacuate parts of Malibu. The Franklin Fire had burned 100 acres when firefighters were dispatched at 10:52 p.m. Monday, the Los Angeles County Fire Department told USA TODAY in an email. Tuesday morning, it was at 2,200 acres and 0% containment, according to CalFire. Some homes have been destroyed in the fire, but officials did not have a number of damaged structures yet, Fire Chief Anthony C. Marrone said at a news briefing Tuesday morning. There were no reports of serious injuries or fatalities, he said. One sheriff deputy's cruiser was damaged in the fire. The fire was fueled by strong Santa Ana winds and low humidity, creating red flag conditions in the region. \"We remain under an immediate threat because of the red flag conditions,\" Marrone said. The fire, located on South Malibu Canyon Road, started near Pepperdine University in Malibu, local outlet KTLA 5 reported. It's threatening structures including the Malibu Pier, which is 2 miles away from the university, according to the City of Malibu. Multiple areas in the City of Malibu are under mandatory evacuation, according to the city's website. Most of Malibu had its power shut off while firefighters worked to gain control of the fire, and all schools there were closed Tuesday. Mayor Pro Tem Marianne Riggins said City Hall was also in the mandatory evacuation zone. Pepperdine University lifted its shelter-in-place status and said the campus was safe for residents, but said the school community was urged to remain on campus and leave Malibu roads clear for emergency personnel. Power was out for most of campus, the university said. The cause of the fire is under investigation, according to CalFire. Wildfires: 'Volatile conditions' prompt red flag warnings across Southern California The LA County Fire Department and LA County Sheriffs are performing evacuations door-to-door. Sheriff Robert Luna said at a Tuesday news briefing that there are over 8,000 structures within the affected zone. Of those, over 2,000 are under mandatory evacuation orders and another about 6,000 were under evacuation warnings. \"Follow evacuation directions from police and fire officials,\" the city said in an emergency alert. The fire was discovered after the National Weather Service issued a red flag warning over the weekend for most of Ventura and Los Angeles counties because of critical fire conditions expected to occur from Monday to Wednesday, reported the Ventura County Star, a part of the USA TODAY Network. The warning is set to stay in place from 10 a.m. Monday to 6 p.m. on Wednesday. This story has been updated to add new information.

                "content": "Watch CBS News By Matthew Rodriguez, Chelsea Hylton, Dean Fioresi, Julie Sharp Updated on: December 10, 2024 / 9:52 AM PST / KCAL News The Franklin Fire in Malibu exploded overnight near the Pepperdine University campus, burning more than 2,200 acres and forcing thousands of people to evacuate the area. In a news conference Tuesday morning, county officials said that a small but undetermined number of homes have been destroyed, with further damage spared due to the work of firefighters on the scene. The massive fire was first reported a little after 10:45 p.m. Monday near South Malibu Canyon Road and Station Boundary just south of the Piuma area, according to the Los Angeles County Fire Department. Los Angeles County Sheriff Robert Luna said Tuesday that approximately 18,000 people and 8,100 structures are in the affected area. Of the 8,100 structures, 2,043 are under evacuation orders and 6,046 are under evacuation warnings. Los Angeles County Fire Department Chief Anthony Marrone said a 5-acre fire that began at Malibu Canyon Road and the tunnel at Pacific Coast Highway was quickly spread by Santa Ana winds. The flames rapidly spread towards Pepperdine University over night. By 3 a.m., the Franklin Fire spread south across Pacific Coast Highway to Malibu Road, near Webb Way. It moved toward the Malibu Pier area and threatened some nearby structures along Malibu Knolls Road and the Sweetwater Mesa area. City of Malibu information officer Matt Myerhoff said early Tuesday morning that the pier is safe. \"I think the preponderance of structures being impacted around here are going to be homes,\" he said. \"We don't have information yet if they are damaged or if they are destroyed, that's too soon to say ... we just know fire crews are battling those.\" Marrone said Tuesday that there are no reports of serious injuries or fatalities, but he warned the fire is not contained. \"We remain under immediate threat because of the Red Flag conditions,\" he said. \"We would like to get some containment by this afternoon.\" Gov. Gavin Newsom announced Tuesday that the state secured a Fire Management Assistance Grant from FEMA to ensure resources are available to help fight the blaze. Arson investigators are looking into the cause of the fire. RELATED: What is defensible space and how to protect your home from wildfires Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department deputies were working to evacuate residents living in zone MAL-C112, which includes the area east of Malibu Canyon Road and South of Piuma Road as well as the Serra Retreat. More information on evacuations is available on the Malibu city website. \"The way evacuations are conducted by the Sheriff's department is they go door to door. They drive up and down the streets with a blowhorn and they knock on every single door. They wake people up and get them out of their houses,\" Myerhoff said. He said using lessons learned from the 2018 Woolsey Fire, first responders are communicating by way of LA-RICS radios that the city purchased, as power outages affect cell phone service and all other forms of communication. \"We are safe. All retreats evacuated safely,\" the Serra Retreat said. \"Looks like the fire is on the retreat center property but there are several fire trucks there. Hopefully, they can contain it. \" A resident named Linda said her boss' house was destroyed while she was trying to evacuate horses. \"It's happening so quickly,\" she said. \"I'm worried about two horses that I left in there. I know the house is gone. I went back in there to find the two horses but it was too dangerous.\" Below is a real-time map outlining evacuation orders and warnings. A temporary evacuation center was opened as the Palisades Recreation Center, located at 851 Alma Real Drive. Large animals could be taken to Pierce College in Winnetka. \"Stay away from the Malibu area, if you can, at all costs,\" Deputy Tracy Koerner said. \"Avoid coming into Malibu. A lot of people commute through Malibu from Ventura and Santa Monica, those people need to stay on the 101 Freeway today.\" Pepperdine school officials released a statement to note that they were closely monitoring the fire. \"The fire is not currently affecting any University campus,\" the statement said. \"The Malibu Campus and local area may experience some power outages related to this incident.\" However, at 1:10 a.m. the fire continued to crawl closer and closer to the university, forcing the administration to issue a shelter-in-place order. \"All community members on the Malibu campus are directed to shelter in place in the Tyler Campus Center or Payson Library,\" the administration posted on X. \"Despite any evacuation orders from Malibu city or surrounding areas, the University community should follow University instructions.\" The administration stated that their \"protocol is approved by LA County Fire and executed with their cooperation.\" Pepperdine canceled all classes and finals for Tuesday following the fire. \"Normal operations on the Malibu Campus are suspended for Tuesday. This includes canceling classes and finals for the day,\" the university tweeted. The worst of the fire pushed past Pepperdine by 3:30 a.m., but some smaller blazes continued to burn around the campus. The hotspots did not threaten structures or lives, according to the administration. \"Additionally, power remains out for much of Malibu and therefore, to ensure the safety of our community, we will maintain the shelter-in-place protocol until at least daylight,\" the university posted on X. \"The EOC will continue to update the community.\" The school lifted the shelter in place order around 7:30 a.m. Tuesday. \"After assessing campus conditions at daybreak, the EOC is lifting the shelter-in-place protocol. Campus conditions are safe for members of the community to return to student residences and on-campus homes,\" the university wrote. Power remained out for much of the campus, and students were advised to not use elevators. The Santa Monica-Malibu Unified School District announced that all Malibu schools are closed Tuesday, Dec. 10 until further notice. \"Authorities are urging residents and visitors to stay clear of the area, as the fire continues to pose a significant threat,\" Superintendent, Dr. Antonio Shelton wrote in a community announcement. \"At this time, many Webster families are under evacuation orders, and several families in other Malibu neighborhoods are under evacuation watch due to the Franklin Fire. Our district's Emergency Operations Center (EOC) is closely monitoring the situation, and we are prepared to respond as conditions evolve.\" The Los Angeles Unified School District, with schools in the neighboring Topanga and Pacific Palisades area, said schools are open and they are \"closely monitoring the Franklin Fire and its potential impact on our communities.\" Weather officials raised concerns over fire danger that would impact most of Southern California. Unusually low humidity paired with a powerful Santa Ana winds movement created dangerous conditions, which led them to issue a \"particularly dangerous situation red flag warning\" beginning Monday night. In response, SoCal Edison warned tens of thousands of residents living throughout Los Angeles County that their service may be shut off if the winds intensify. Tuesday morning, winds in Malibu were gusting 40 mph, with peak winds expected from 7 a.m. to 11 a.m. Tuesday. KCAL News meteorologist Paul Deanno said while the strongest winds are expected around 7 a.m., the fire danger remains high even after the worst of the winds have passed because of low humidity. Conditions are similar to the weather when the Mountain Fire erupted in Ventura County in early November. That blaze torched nearly 20,000 acres and destroyed more than 200 structures.

                "title": "Bill Belichick - Wikipedia",
                "content": "William Stephen Belichick (/ˈbɛlɪtʃɪk, ˈbɛlɪtʃɛk/; born April 16, 1952) is an American sports analyst and American football coach. Widely regarded as one of the greatest head coaches of all time,[1][2][3] he holds numerous coaching records, including the record of most Super Bowl wins (six) as a head coach, all with the New England Patriots, along with two more during his time as the defensive coordinator of the New York Giants, for a record eight combined total Super Bowl victories as coach and coordinator.[4] A renowned American football historian, Belichick is often referred to as a \"student of the game\" with a deep knowledge of the intricacies of each player position.[5][6][7][8] During his tenure with the Patriots, Belichick was a central figure as the head coach and de facto general manager during the franchise's dynasty from 2001 to 2019.[9] Belichick is a descendant of the Bill Parcells coaching tree. He began his coaching career in 1975 as an assistant for the Baltimore Colts and became the defensive coordinator for New York Giants head coach Bill Parcells by 1985. Parcells and Belichick won two Super Bowls together before Belichick left to become the head coach of the Cleveland Browns in 1991. He remained in Cleveland for five seasons but was fired following the team's 1995 season. Belichick rejoined Parcells, first in New England where the team lost Super Bowl XXXI, and later with the New York Jets. After being named head coach of the Jets, Belichick resigned after only one day on the job to accept the head coaching job for the Patriots on January 27, 2000. In 24 seasons under Belichick, the Patriots won 17 AFC East division titles, made 13 appearances in the AFC Championship Game, and appeared in nine Super Bowls, with a record six wins. Overall, Belichick has won eight Super Bowl titles (the most of any individual in NFL history) and finished as runner-up four times from his combined time as an assistant and head coach. At the time Belichick left the Patriots, he was the NFL's longest-tenured active head coach. Belichick has the most playoff coaching wins all-time with 31 and ranks third in regular season coaching wins in the NFL with 302.[10] He is also in second place for combined regular season and postseason wins, and also second place for most regular season coaching wins with one franchise.[11] Belichick is one of only three head coaches who have won six NFL titles.[12] He was named the AP NFL Coach of the Year for the 2003, 2007, and 2010 seasons. Belichick has also been selected to the NFL 2000s All-Decade Team, NFL 2010s All-Decade Team, as well as the NFL 100th Anniversary All-Time Team. Belichick was born in Nashville, Tennessee, on April 16, 1952,[13] the son of Jeannette (née Munn) and Steve Belichick.[14] Belichick was named after College Football Hall of Fame coach Bill Edwards, who was his godfather.[15] He is of Croatian ancestry;[16] his paternal grandparents, Marija Barković and Ivan Biličić, emigrated from Draganić in 1897 and settled in Monessen, Pennsylvania, having changed their names to Mary and John Belichick at the suggestion of immigration officers.[17] Belichick was raised in Annapolis, Maryland,[18] where his father was an assistant football coach at the United States Naval Academy. Belichick has said his father is one of his most important football mentors, and Belichick often studied football with him.[19] Bill reportedly learned to break down game films at a young age by watching his father and the Navy staff do their jobs.[20] Belichick graduated from Annapolis High School in 1970, where he was a classmate of Sally Brice-O'Hara, who would later become the Vice Commandant of the Coast Guard.[21][22] While there, Belichick played football and lacrosse, with the latter being his favorite sport.[23] Belichick enrolled at Phillips Academy in Andover, Massachusetts, for a postgraduate year, with the intention of improving his grades and test scores to be admitted into a quality college.[24] The school honored Belichick 40 years later by inducting him into its Athletics Hall of Honor in 2011.[25] Belichick attended Wesleyan University in Middletown, Connecticut, where he played center and tight end. In addition to being a member of the football team, Belichick played lacrosse and squash, serving as the captain of the lacrosse team during his senior season. A member of Chi Psi fraternity,[26] Belichick earned a bachelor's degree in economics in 1975.[27] Eventually, he was part of the inaugural induction class into the university's Athletics Hall of Fame in spring 2008.[28] After graduating, Belichick took a $25-per-week job as an assistant to Baltimore Colts head coach Ted Marchibroda in 1975.[29] In 1976, Belichick joined the Detroit Lions as their assistant special teams coach before adding tight ends and wide receivers to his coaching duties in 1977.[30] Belichick was dismissed along with head coach Tommy Hudspeth and the rest of the coaching staff on January 9, 1978.[31] He spent the 1978 season with the Denver Broncos as their assistant special teams coach and defensive assistant while also serving as director of films.[32][33] In 1979, Belichick began a 12-year stint with the New York Giants alongside head coach Ray Perkins as a defensive assistant and special teams coach.[34] Belichick added linebackers coaching to his duties in 1980 and was named defensive coordinator in 1985 under head coach Bill Parcells, who had replaced Perkins in 1983. The Giants won Super Bowl XXI and Super Bowl XXV following the 1986 and 1990 seasons.[35][36] Belichick's defensive game plan from the New York Giants' 20–19 upset of the Buffalo Bills in Super Bowl XXV has been placed in the Pro Football Hall of Fame.[37] From 1991 until 1995, Belichick was the head coach of the Cleveland Browns. During his tenure in Cleveland, Belichick compiled a 36–44 record, leading the team to the playoffs in 1994, his only winning year with the team.[38] Coincidentally, Belichick's lone playoff victory during his Browns tenure was achieved against the New England Patriots, who were coached by former Giants head coach Bill Parcells, in the Wild Card Round during that postseason.[39] In Belichick's final season in Cleveland, the Browns finished 5–11 despite starting 3–1.[40] One of his most controversial moves was cutting quarterback Bernie Kosar midway through the 1993 season. Kosar was signed by the Dallas Cowboys two days later and won a Super Bowl with the Cowboys in Super Bowl XXVIII as a backup. In November 1995, in the middle of the ongoing football season, Browns owner Art Modell had announced he would move his franchise to Baltimore after the season.[41] After first being given assurances that he would coach the new team that would later become the Baltimore Ravens, Belichick was instead fired on February 14, 1996, a week after the shift was officially announced.[42] In the 2013 episode of A Football Life on the Cleveland Browns relocation controversy, many sports journalists who had covered the Browns at the time had said that in retrospective, Belichick had laid the groundwork for the Ravens success in the ensuring decades including their win in Super Bowl XXXV (with Cleveland holdovers Matt Stover and Rob Burnett still with the team at that point), setting up the infrastructure by giving recently retired tight end Ozzie Newsome his first front-office job and had planned on drafting Ray Lewis in the 1996 NFL Draft if Belichick and the team stayed in Cleveland. (Indeed, the newly-christened Ravens did draft Lewis, who went on to a 17-year Hall of Fame career with the team.) Those who had covered the Browns went on to state that if the original Browns had stayed in Cleveland, Belichick would have seen his work through. For his part, Belichick stated that he was able to learn from some mistakes he had made with the Browns while largely sticking to his blueprint from Cleveland when resurrecting the Patriots, such as factoring in off-the-field issues that can affect performance. Among those interviewed, the general consensus was that Belichick's failure in Cleveland was more to do with Modell's financial struggles (even paying a young Scott Pioli only $14,000/year--equivalent to $32,447 in 2024--as a scout) that eventually led the NFL to force the sale of the Ravens to Steve Bisciotti than Belichick's own doing.[43] After his dismissal by the Cleveland Browns, Belichick served under Parcells again as assistant head coach and defensive backs coach with the New England Patriots for the 1996 season. The Patriots finished with an 11–5 record and won the AFC Championship over the Jacksonville Jaguars, but they lost to the Green Bay Packers in Super Bowl XXXI amid rumors of Parcells's impending defection.[44][45] Belichick had two stints as the head coach of the New York Jets without ever coaching a game. In February 1997, Belichick, who had been an assistant coach under Bill Parcells with the New York Giants and New England Patriots, was named the Jets interim head coach while the Jets and Patriots continued to negotiate compensation to release Parcells from his contract with the Patriots and allow Parcells to coach the Jets.[46] Six days later, the Patriots and Jets reached an agreement that allowed Parcells to coach the Jets, and Belichick became the team's assistant head coach and defensive coordinator.[47] When Parcells stepped down as head coach after the 1999 season, he had already arranged with team management to have Belichick succeed him. However, Belichick was the Jets' head coach for only one day. On January 4, 2000, when Belichick was introduced as head coach to the media—the day after his hiring was publicized—he turned it into a surprise resignation announcement. Before taking the podium, Belichick scrawled a resignation note on a napkin that read, in its entirety, \"I resign as HC of the NYJ.\" He then delivered a half-hour speech explaining his resignation to the assembled press corps.[48] Soon after this bizarre turn of events, Belichick was introduced as the Patriots' 12th full-time head coach, succeeding the recently fired Pete Carroll.[49] The Patriots had inquired to the Jets about permission to interview him for their vacant spot at head coach just prior to Parcells stepping down.[50] Parcells and the Jets claimed that Belichick was still under contract to the Jets, and demanded compensation from the Patriots. NFL Commissioner Paul Tagliabue agreed, and the Patriots gave the Jets a first-round draft pick in 2000 in exchange for the right to hire Belichick.[51] Soon after hiring Belichick, owner Robert Kraft gave him near-complete control over the team's football operations, making him the de facto general manager as well. Until 2009, Belichick split many of the duties normally held by a general manager on other clubs with player personnel director Scott Pioli, though Belichick had the final say on football matters.[52] Pioli left for the Kansas City Chiefs after the 2008 season.[53] The Patriots went 5–11 in the 2000 regular season and missed the playoffs.[54] In 2001, the Patriots went 11–5 in the regular season, and in the playoffs defeated the Oakland Raiders (in the \"Tuck Rule Game\") and Pittsburgh Steelers on the way to the Super Bowl.[55][56] In Super Bowl XXXVI, Belichick's defense held the St. Louis Rams' offense, which had averaged 31 points during the season, to 17 points, and the Patriots won on a last-second field goal by Adam Vinatieri.[57] The win was the first Super Bowl championship in Patriots history.[58] The following season (2002)—the first in Gillette Stadium—the Patriots went 9–7 and missed the playoffs.[59] New England finished with the same record as the New York Jets and the Miami Dolphins, but the Jets won the AFC East title as a result of the third tiebreaker (record among common opponents).[60] The Patriots' 2003 season started with a 31–0 loss to the Buffalo Bills in Week 1, a few days after they released team defensive captain Lawyer Milloy.[61][62] However, they dominated through the remainder of the season to finish 14–2, setting a new franchise record for wins in a season.[63] In the final week of the regular season, the Patriots avenged their loss to the Bills by the same 31–0 score.[64] They defeated the Tennessee Titans in the divisional round of the playoffs. Playing against the Indianapolis Colts and Co-MVP Peyton Manning in the AFC Championship Game (Steve McNair of the Titans was also Co-MVP), the Patriots recorded four interceptions, and advanced to Super Bowl XXXVIII, where they defeated the Carolina Panthers 32–29 on a late Adam Vinatieri field goal.[65][66] Belichick was awarded the NFL Coach of the Year Award. In 2004, the Patriots once again finished with a 14–2 record, and they defeated the Indianapolis Colts in the divisional round of the playoffs.[67][68] They opened the season at 6–0, which combined with the 15 straight wins to end the previous season, gave New England 21 consecutive victories to break the record for most wins in a row formerly held by the Miami Dolphins with 18 straight victories in the 1972 and 1973 seasons. They defeated the Pittsburgh Steelers in the AFC Championship Game. In Super Bowl XXXIX, the Patriots beat the Philadelphia Eagles and became only the second team to win three Super Bowls in four years.[69][70] Belichick is the only coach to accomplish the feat as the Dallas Cowboys had two head coaches in the stretch they won three of four from 1992 to 1995. With a new defensive coordinator in Eric Mangini and no named offensive coordinator, the Patriots went 10–6 in the 2005 season and defeated the Jacksonville Jaguars in the Wild Card Round before losing to the Denver Broncos in the Divisional Round.[71][72][73] Earlier, with a season-opening win over the Oakland Raiders, Belichick notched his 54th win with the Patriots, passing Mike Holovak as the winningest coach in Patriots history. The Patriots finished with a 12–4 record in the 2006 season and defeated the New York Jets by a score of 37–16 in the Wild Card Round.[74][75] They then beat the San Diego Chargers the next week in the Divisional Round, before losing to the eventual Super Bowl XLI champion Indianapolis Colts in the AFC Championship by a score of 38–34.[76][77] The Patriots led 21–3 midway through the second quarter, but the Colts mounted one of the great comebacks in playoff history.[78] In 2007, Belichick led the Patriots to the first perfect regular season since the introduction of the 16-game regular season schedule in 1978, only the fourth team to do so in National Football League history after the 1934[79] and 1942 Chicago Bears[80] and 1972 Miami Dolphins. In the Divisional Round of the playoffs, they defeated the Jacksonville Jaguars by a score of 31–20. In the AFC Championship, the Patriots defeated the San Diego Chargers by a score of 21–12. The Patriots were upset in Super Bowl XLII 17–14 by the New York Giants, his former team, due to the defense allowing a famous play to David Tyree near the end of regulation.[81] The Patriots' failure to attain a \"perfect season\" (undefeated and untied, including playoffs) preserved the Miami Dolphins as the sole team to do so, having finished their 1972 regular season at 14–0 and having won three games in the playoffs. Only two other teams in professional football have recorded a perfect season—the 1948 Cleveland Browns (14–0) of the then All-America Football Conference and the 1948 Calgary Stampeders (12–0) of the Canadian Football League. No team in the former American Football League ever had a perfect season. During the Patriots' 2008 season-opener against the Kansas City Chiefs, quarterback Tom Brady sustained a season-ending injury in the first quarter.[82] Backup quarterback Matt Cassel was named the starter for the remainder of the season. However, with a win in Week 2, the Patriots broke their own record for regular season wins in a row with 21 (2006–08). After losing over 12 players to the injured reserve list, including Rodney Harrison, Adalius Thomas, and Laurence Maroney, the Patriots still managed their league-leading eighth consecutive season with a winning record, going 11–5.[83] However, the Patriots, who finished second in the AFC East, missed the playoffs for the first time since 2002, losing on tiebreakers to the Miami Dolphins (who won the division on the fourth tiebreaker, better conference record) and the Baltimore Ravens (who beat out the Patriots for the last playoff spot due to a better conference record).[84] The 1985 Denver Broncos are the only other 11-win team to miss the playoffs in a 16-game season.[85] In 2009, with a fully healthy Tom Brady back as the starting quarterback, Belichick was able to guide the Patriots to yet another AFC East division title with a 10–6 record.[86] However, the Patriots lost to the Baltimore Ravens in the Wild Card Round.[87] In an incident dubbed \"Spygate\",[88] on September 9, 2007, NFL security caught a Patriots video assistant taping the New York Jets' defensive signals from the sidelines, which is not an approved location. The NFL rules state: \"No video recording devices of any kind are permitted to be in use in the coaches' booth, on the field, or in the locker room during the game.\" Jets coach Eric Mangini, a former Patriots assistant, tipped off league officials that the Patriots might have been filming their signals. After the game, the Jets formally complained to the league. On September 13, the NFL fined Belichick $500,000—the largest fine ever imposed on a coach in the league's 87-year history,[89] and fined the Patriots $250,000. Additionally, the Patriots forfeited their first-round draft pick in the 2008 NFL draft. NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell, a former employee of the Jets, said that he fined the Patriots as a team because Belichick exercises so much control over the Patriots' on-field operations that \"his actions and decisions are properly attributed to the club.\" Goodell considered suspending Belichick but decided that taking away draft picks would be more severe in the long run.[90] Gary Myers, a columnist for New York's Daily News columnist, stated Belichick should have been suspended by Goodell for the Patriots' next game against the Jets.[91] Belichick later issued the following statement: I accept full responsibility for the actions that led to tonight's ruling. Once again, I apologize to the Kraft family and every person directly or indirectly associated with the New England Patriots for the embarrassment, distraction and penalty my mistake caused. I also apologize to Patriots fans and would like to thank them for their support during the past few days and throughout my career. [...] As the Commissioner acknowledged, our use of sideline video had no impact on the outcome of last week's game. We have never used sideline video to obtain a competitive advantage while the game was in progress. [...] Part of my job as head coach is to ensure that our football operations are conducted in compliance of the league rules and all accepted interpretations of them. My interpretation of a rule in the Constitution and Bylaws was incorrect. [...] With tonight's resolution, I will not be offering any further comments on this matter. We are moving on with our preparations for Sunday's game. The sanctions against Belichick were the harshest imposed on a head coach in league history until the New Orleans Saints' Sean Payton was suspended for the entire 2012 season for covering up a scheme in which bounties were paid for deliberately knocking opponents out of games. Following the incident and its fallout, Belichick led the Patriots to a perfect 16–0 regular season record, and was awarded the 2007 NFL Coach of the Year Award, as voted on by the Associated Press.[92] In the 2010 season, Belichick and the Patriots finished with a 14–2 record for the top seed in the AFC.[93] However, their postseason ended quickly with a 28–21 loss to the New York Jets in the divisional round.[94] In the 2011 season, the Patriots topped the AFC with a 13–3 record.[95] Following a victory over the Denver Broncos in the divisional round of the playoffs, the Patriots won the AFC Championship game, beating the Baltimore Ravens 23–20 when the Ravens failed to score a touchdown and Baltimore's kicker, Billy Cundiff, missed a routine 32-yard field goal attempt to tie the game and send it into overtime.[96][97] This sent New England to their fifth Super Bowl under Belichick. In Super Bowl XLVI, the Patriots lost in the Super Bowl XLII rematch to the New York Giants by a score of 21–17.[98] On September 26, 2012, following a 31–30 loss to the Baltimore Ravens, Belichick was fined $50,000 for grabbing a replacement official's arm while asking for more specific clarity on a ruling after Baltimore had narrowly converted a last-second field goal attempt to secure the win.[99] The Patriots finished the 2012 regular season with a 12–4 record. In the divisional round of the playoffs, they defeated the Houston Texans by a score of 41–28 and made it to the AFC Championship Game, where they lost to the eventual Super Bowl XLVII champion Baltimore Ravens by a score of 28–13, ending their season.[100][101] The Patriots began the 2013 season with much upheaval on the offensive side of the ball with the injury of Rob Gronkowski, the arrest and subsequent release of Aaron Hernandez, the departures of Wes Welker to the Denver Broncos and Danny Woodhead to the San Diego Chargers in free agency, and the release of Brandon Lloyd. To replace them, the Patriots signed Danny Amendola in free agency, drafted rookies Aaron Dobson and Josh Boyce, and signed undrafted rookie free agent Kenbrell Thompkins. The team finished the season with a 12–4 record, winning the AFC East and securing a playoff berth and a first-round bye, seeding second in the AFC standings.[102] In the Divisional Round, they defeated the Indianapolis Colts by a score of 43–22.[103] They lost to the Denver Broncos in the AFC Championship Game by a score of 26–16.[104] In the 2014 season, Belichick's Patriots started 2–2. At a mid-week press conference following a 41–14 loss to the Kansas City Chiefs, Belichick famously uttered, \"We're on to Cincinnati\" (referring to the Patriots' next opponent), several times in response to follow-up questions and criticisms of his team, Brady in particular.[105] Ultimately, they recorded a 12–4 record for the third straight season.[106] In the Divisional Round, they defeated the Baltimore Ravens by a score of 35–31.[107] During the AFC Championship Game, they defeated the Indianapolis Colts by a score of 45–7.[108] They reached Super Bowl XLIX, where they defeated the Seattle Seahawks by a score of 28–24.[109] With his fourth championship as head coach, Belichick tied Chuck Noll for most Super Bowl wins by a head coach.[110] In the 2015 season, the Patriots recorded a 12–4 record for the fourth straight season.[111] They defeated the Kansas City Chiefs in the Divisional Round by a score of 27–20.[112] During the AFC Championship Game, the Patriots narrowly lost to the eventual Super Bowl 50 champion Denver Broncos by a score of 20–18.[113] In the 2016 season, the Patriots recorded a 14–2 record, which earned them the #1 seed for the AFC playoffs.[114] In the Divisional Round, they defeated the Houston Texans by a score of 34–16.[115] During the AFC Championship Game, they defeated the Pittsburgh Steelers by a score of 36–17.[116] They reached Super Bowl LI, where they defeated the Atlanta Falcons in a comeback victory by a score of 34–28 in overtime.[117] The Patriots were down 28–3 at one point in the third quarter.[118] With the victory, Belichick won his record fifth Super Bowl title as a head coach.[119] In the 2017 season, the Patriots went 13–3, setting an NFL record eighth consecutive 12-or-more-win seasons, capturing their ninth consecutive AFC East title and their 15th of the last 17 seasons. They defeated the Tennessee Titans in the Divisional Round by a score of 35–14 and the Jacksonville Jaguars in the AFC Championship Game by a score of 24–20, claiming their second consecutive AFC title, while also extending their record of consecutive AFC Championship Game appearances with seven.[120][121] Super Bowl LII was Belichick's eighth title game as head coach and his eleventh overall in any capacity, which was also the Patriots' tenth appearance, all extending NFL records. The Ringer wrote that Belichick's \"team is different from many of New England's famous teams from the previous decade: The first iteration of the Patriots dynasty relied on defense. This year, they are 29th in yards allowed (though fifth in points allowed) and instead have perfected the art of situational football.\" The latter Patriots teams were noted for mounting late comebacks in playoff games.[122][123] However, the Patriots fell to the Philadelphia Eagles in Super Bowl LII, 41–33, as Eagles quarterback Nick Foles repeated his dominant NFC Championship Game performance and led Philadelphia to victory in a high-scoring game. The Patriots were down early, as they had been in most of their Super Bowl wins. However, they could not make a comeback this time, although they came very close. Eagles defensive end Brandon Graham strip-sacked Tom Brady to get the ball back with about two minutes to go in the fourth quarter. The Patriots did get the ball again before the end of the game, but they ran out of time to score.[124] In the 2018 season, the Patriots went 11–5, failing to win 12 or more games for the first time since 2009. Despite this, they still captured their 10th consecutive AFC East title and their 16th of the last 18 years. They defeated the Los Angeles Chargers in the Divisional Round by a score of 41–28 and the Kansas City Chiefs during the AFC Championship Game 37–31 in a tough overtime game in Kansas City to advance to their third straight Super Bowl.[125][126] In Super Bowl LIII, the Patriots defeated the Los Angeles Rams 13–3 to give Belichick his sixth Super Bowl championship as a head coach and his eighth overall to have the most Super Bowl rings in NFL history. His six championships matched both George Halas and Curly Lambeau for most championships as a head coach. The Patriots' defense held the high-scoring Rams offense to only 260 total yards.[127][128] On May 13, 2019, Belichick announced that he would assume another role as the Patriots' defensive coordinator starting the 2019 season.[129] On October 27, 2019, with the Patriots' win over the Cleveland Browns, Belichick obtained his 300th win, regular and postseason combined, as a head coach.[130] The Patriots finished the 2019 regular season with a 12–4 record, winning their 11th consecutive AFC East title.[131] However, the Patriots were defeated in the Wild Card Round of the playoffs by the Tennessee Titans, led by former Patriots linebacker Mike Vrabel, by a score of 20–13.[132] Following the departure of Tom Brady to the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, Belichick and the Patriots were faced with an uncertain quarterback situation for the first time in nearly two decades.[133] During the offseason, the Patriots signed former Carolina Panthers starter Cam Newton for the 2020 NFL season.[134] The off-season routines and schedules, as well as the normal processes of regular season were severely disrupted by the worldwide COVID-19 pandemic. Despite the unanticipated difficulties and challenges of the pandemic, the Patriots were in the hunt for a playoff spot until late in the season, ultimately finishing 7–9. The 2020 season was Belichick's first losing season since his first year in New England.[135] In the 2021 NFL draft, the Patriots selected quarterback Mac Jones with the 15th overall pick.[136] After Jones and Newton competed for the starting job during the preseason, Belichick made the decision to release Newton and name Jones the starter for the upcoming season.[137][138] During Week 4, Brady's Tampa Bay Buccaneers visited the Patriots in his first trip to Gillette Stadium since signing with the Buccaneers. A missed 56-yard field goal by Patriots kicker Nick Folk allowed Tampa Bay to narrowly escape with a 19–17 victory.[139] Immediately after the game, Brady and Belichick shared a quick embrace on the field before Brady greeted his former teammates and other members of the Patriots organization.[140] Though fans criticized Belichick for his lack of warmth displayed towards his former quarterback, the two privately spoke at length in the Buccaneers locker room following the match.[141] Belichick helped lead the Patriots to a 10–7 record in 2021. The team fell to the Buffalo Bills in the Wild Card Round by a score of 47–17.[142] In the 2022 season, despite starting quarterback Mac Jones being injured in Week 3 and subsequently missing three more weeks, the Patriots remained in the hunt for a playoff spot until the last week, finishing with a record of 8–9.[143][144] During Week 4 of the 2023 season, the Patriots lost to the Dallas Cowboys by a score of 38–3.[145] In doing so, Belichick suffered the worst loss of his coaching career (35 points).[146] The following week, the Patriots lost to the Saints by a score of 34–0, giving Belichick his worst home loss of his career.[147] Two weeks later, New England upset the Buffalo Bills 29–25 to earn Belichick his 300th career regular season win as an NFL head coach.[148] After a Week 10 10–6 loss to the Indianapolis Colts in Germany and subsequent bye week, Belichick named Bailey Zappe the team's starting quarterback.[149] In Belichick's final game with New England, the Patriots lost to the New York Jets 17–3, snapping the team's 15-game winning streak over the Jets. The Patriots finished the season with a 4–13 record, the team's worst in Belichick's 24 seasons as head coach.[150] On January 11, 2024, Belichick and the Patriots mutually agreed to part ways.[151] On January 15, Belichick was interviewed by the Atlanta Falcons for their head coaching position, but ultimately did not get the job as the Falcons hired Raheem Morris instead.[152] Under Belichick, the Patriots had a regular-season record of 266–121–0 over 24 seasons.[153] Belichick is the most successful coach in Patriots history; his 266 wins with the franchise are more than quadruple those of runner-up Mike Holovak.[154] Belichick also compiled a 30–12 record in the playoffs with New England, including a 6–3 record in Super Bowls. He led the Patriots to 17 divisional titles, including five consecutive titles from 2003 to 2007 and eleven consecutive titles from 2009 to 2019. This streak of 11 consecutive playoff appearances is the most in NFL history for any team.[155] While still serving as head coach for the Patriots in 2019, Belichick appeared as one of three main analysts, alongside host Rich Eisen and Cris Collinsworth, for the NFL 100 All-Time Team series on NFL Network, serving as a voter, in addition to providing his analysis of each member's significance and breaking down tape of highlight plays. Belichick was chosen in these roles due to his exceptional knowledge of American football, to the extent that he and fellow former head coach John Madden were specifically assigned to look over film of the earliest players selected to the team.[156] Belichick was awarded a Sports Emmy in 2021 for his contributions to the series.[157] After mutually parting ways with the Patriots in 2024, Belichick, while still declaring himself an active head coach, officially agreed to appear every Monday afternoon during the 2024 NFL season with ESPN's The Pat McAfee Show, first appearing as an analyst on the show during its \"5th Annual Draft Spectacular\", covering the 2024 NFL draft, following a guest appearance weeks prior.[158][159] \"I can't tell you the advantage to having a defensive coach to take the quarterback behind the ropes on that defense, it made me a better quarterback, so Bill's gonna do that. I think the audience is going to be fascinated at how smart he is. Look, you guys saw how witty he is. I watched the Draft show you guys did; it was awesome. He's quick-witted, he's funny and like I said, he's brilliant when it comes to defense and offense, the guy can flat-out coach.\"[160] –Peyton Manning on Belichick as an analyst, May 2024 Peyton Manning revealed during the Netflix special The Roast of Tom Brady that Belichick would join another ESPN program, joining the Manning brothers (Peyton and Eli) in the Manningcast, an alternate live television broadcast of Monday Night Football.[161] A week afterward, Manning stated during an appearance on The Pat McAfee Show that Belichick would appear on every Manningcast broadcast during the 2024 season.[160] Coaching record accurate as of final week of the 2023 NFL season.[162] Bill Belichick has worked under six head coaches: Twenty of Belichick's assistant coaches have become NFL or NCAA head coaches (not including interim tenures): During the offseason, Belichick visits other football programs to learn from their experiences. For example, he has studied the Navy run offense, sought Bill Walsh (in past years) to understand more about the San Francisco 49ers as an organization and the West Coast offense as a system,[190] and spent time with Jimmy Johnson to learn about drafting and contract negotiations.[191] The track record of Belichick's coaching tree has been characterized as poor. Former assistant coaches under Belichick had a combined 208–296–1 (.413) record as head coaches of their own teams through November 28, 2020, and a number of them ended their brief tenures as head coaches by being fired midseason.[192] As of the end of the 2020 season, the only members of this coaching tree to have career NFL head coaching records above .500 were former coaches Groh (9–7) and O'Brien (52–48 during season, 2–4 in playoffs).[193] Nick Saban and Belichick are good friends. In 2007, when Belichick spoke about their relationship, he said: \"Two successful Croats in the same division of NFL. You must admit, you don't see that every day.\"[194] In May 2018, President Donald Trump appointed Belichick to be a member of his Council on Sports, Fitness & Nutrition.[195] Belichick has an Alaskan Klee Kai dog named Nike.[196] Interest in the breed surged after Nike made an appearance on camera during the 2020 NFL draft.[197] Belichick has dual Croatian/American citizenship.[198] He received Croatian citizenship on June 3, 2024, in Banski dvori in Zagreb from the Croatian prime minister Andrej Plenković.[199] He was also special guest of the association football friendly match on Stadion Rujevica between Croatia and North Macedonia.[200] Belichick was married to Debby Clarke from 1977 to 2006.[201][202] They have three children. Daughter Amanda played lacrosse at Wesleyan University. She is the head women's lacrosse coach at the College of the Holy Cross in Massachusetts in July 2015.[203] Son Stephen played lacrosse and football at Rutgers University, served as assistant coach with the Patriots, and is currently defensive coordinator for the University of Washington.[204] Son Brian is an assistant coach with the Patriots.[205] Starting in 2007, Belichick was in a relationship with Linda Holliday, the executive director of the Bill Belichick Foundation.[206][207] The relationship ended in 2023. In June 2024 it was reported that Belichick was in a relationship with Jordon Hudson, who is a 24-year-old former cheerleader.[208] On January 10, 2021, Politico reported then-President Donald Trump planned to award Belichick the Presidential Medal of Freedom.[209] Belichick indicated that he was flattered to be considered for the honor, but declined the award in a statement issued the next day.[210] His statement referenced the January 6 United States Capitol attack, which the House of Representatives had accused Trump of provoking when it impeached for the second time of his presidency, and cited Belichick's \"great reverence for our nation's values, freedom and democracy\" in light of that event.[211][212] A number of Massachusetts politicians, including Senator Ed Markey and Representative Jim McGovern, had previously called on him to decline after news of the award became public.[213] # denotes interim head coach # denotes de facto general manager # denotes interim head coach # denotes de facto general manager",

                "content": "If not listed, please contact your TV provider. Legendary NFL coach Bill Belichick confirmed Monday during an interview on \"The Pat McAfee Show\" that he has had conversations with North Carolina and school chancellor Lee Harriss Roberts to potentially fill the Tar Heels' coaching vacancy. This comes amid multiple reports indicating mutual interest between the 72-year old Belichick and North Carolina. \"We've had a couple of good conversations,\" Belichick said. \"We'll see how it goes.\" Belichick has not coached since 2023 when he led the New England Patriots to a 4-13 record. Belichick and the Patriots agreed to mutually part ways in January 2024. Belichick has been open to a return to coaching since leaving the Patriots. In January, shortly after the parting of ways, Belichick was interviewed by the Atlanta Falcons for their head coaching vacancy. The Falcons eventually hired Raheem Morris. \"I think anytime as a coach you join with an organization, whether it's -- whatever level it's at, you just want to share a vision with that person,\" Belichick said. Talking through a lot of things -- I don't think it really matters where the program is. There are a lot of things that go into that. Team building and the structure of the program and so forth that take some time to just talk through. It's a discussion. It's not an argument or a debate. It's just understanding what resources are available. What we need. How does that mix together? Who's working for who? That's all pretty common. \"Every interview I've had has had an element of that in it. This will be no different. Whatever the organization or team is, there still has to be a structure to it and I'd say a common vision for it to work well.\" Were something to materialize, this would be Belichick's first foray into the college coaching world. He did grow up around the game under his father, Steve Belichick, who was an assistant coach at Vanderbilt, North Carolina and Navy from 1949-89. Belichick is an eight-time Super Bowl winner. He took home the NFL's top prize twice as a defensive coordinator with the New York Giants from 1985-90 and led the New England Patriots to six Super Bowl wins during his 23-year tenure as head coach. With a 302-165 overall record through his stints with the Patriots and the Cleveland Browns, he is also second all-time in NFL head coach wins. Despite Belichick's professional success, there are some concerns about his ability to acclimate to the college game. Belichick did note that he has spent the last year studying college football and paying closer attention to its inner workings on his own time. He also laid out his vision if -- and Belichick emphasized the if -- he gets the opportunity to run a college program. \"If I was in a college program, the college program would be a pipeline to the NFL for the players that had the ability to play in the NFL,\" Belichick said. \"It would be a professional program. Training, nutrition, scheme, coaching, techniques that would transfer to the NFL. It would be an NFL program at a college leve and an education that would get the players ready for their career after football, whether that was the end of their college career or the end of their pro career.\" North Carolina is searching for a new coach after moving on from Mack Brown, who had two separate stints leading the Tar Heels. The 73-year old Brown went 44-33 during his second tenure at North Carolina from 2019-24. © 2004-2024 CBS Interactive. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.

                "content": "Editions: En/nfl The six-time Super Bowl champion head coach is 48 years older than his woman Former New England Patriots head coach Bill Belichick \"couldn't care less\" about the 48 years between himself and his new girlfriend, Jordon Hudson, as he faces criticism that he's too old for the 24-year-old. Hudson met the six-time Super Bowl champion on a flight where they discussed psychology, and they remained in touch with each other afterwards, before reportedly beginning dating sometime in 2022. \"[Belichick] couldn't care less about the age difference because he appreciates Jordon for the woman that she is,\" a source told PageSix.com. \"Jordon is an old soul so she and Bill connect on a deep level. \"Age is just a number to them. [They] don't listen to the haters because their relationship is the real deal. [They] don't care what anybody thinks.\" Their relationship has largely remained out of the spotlight due to Belichick's forced sabbatical from the NFL when the Patriots axed him as their head coach and general manager after two decades in the role. Whilst he is listed as an active coach, he currently is not registered to any team and works as a pundit for FOX Sports and often collaborates with Pat McAfee. The 72-year-old recently made his red carpet debut with his beau as they attended The Museum Gala at New York City's American Museum of Natural History on December 5 and now an insider reports his passionate defense of her. The young woman and senior citizen have bonded over their shared love of football, as well as nature and the outdoor world and despite criticism, they are said to genuinely like each other. \"Bill was so proud to have Jordon by his side,\" the insider tells PageSix.com of the trip to the Museum. \"They have a genuine connection and mutual respect for one another. \"[They] connect on so many levels despite what some may think.

The 17-year-old phenom chose BYU over powerhouse programs such as Kansas, UNC, and Alabama. For Dybantsa, the decision was an easy one. The projected 2026 No. 1 pick made his announcement on ESPN’s “First Take.” He explained his decision to Stephen A. Smith and Shannon Sharpe, crediting the NBA experience BYU’s coaching staff brings to the table. “At BYU, the whole staff from the head coach on down came from the NBA,\" Dybantsa said (h/t ESPN). \"Head coach Kevin Young coached my favorite player in KD (Kevin Durant) and coached Devin Booker. Both had a lot of good things to say about him. We watched clips of both. \"Coach Young's NBA background played a big factor in my decision. He came from the NBA. He coached NBA players. You cannot get any closer to where I want to be.\" Dybantsa’s NBA aspirations fueled his groundbreaking decision, and that decision should help BYU recruit more talent in the future. With first-year head coach Kevin Young — a former assistant coach for the Phoenix Suns — already helping the Cougars land a player like Dybantsa, the future is bright for this Big 12 squad. Dybantsa is expected to receive nearly $7 million from his NIL deal. This will mark the largest NIL deal ever signed in college basketball. As expected, Dybantsa aims to be a one-and-done prospect. Dybantsa’s signing with BYU marks a historic moment for the program, giving the Cougars their first-ever five-star recruit since the ESPN recruiting database began in 2007. Standing at 6-foot-9 with an incredibly versatile skill set, Dybantsa averaged 21.4 points, 9.4 rebounds, and 3.5 assists during his junior year of high school. “I play like a mix of Tracy McGrady and Shai (Gilgeous-Alexander),” Dybantsa told First Take. The superstar wing clearly has the confidence and swagger of a future No. 1 pick. Dybantsa will look to prepare himself for the NBA with development under a supreme Cougars coaching staff, but his main goal is still a national championship. “The goal is to win a national championship,\" Dybantsa said. \"Individually their plan is to make me NBA-ready, the No. 1 overall draft pick. They will help me with my 3-point shot and put me in different spots that I would play in the NBA.\" Dybantsa’s groundbreaking decision made waves throughout the college basketball fanbase, and it should send a message to programs across the country that coaching staffs with NBA experience can make a monumental difference.

[1] He was named the Massachusetts Boys' Basketball Gatorade Player of the Year following his freshman season after averaging 19.1 points, 9.6 rebounds, 2.9 assists and 2.5 blocks per game.[2] Dybantsa helped lead Saint Sebastian's to the NEPSAC Class A state championship, but lost to Milton Academy 77–76.[1] Dybantsa transferred to Prolific Prep in Napa, California at the end of his freshman year, where he teamed up with the second-ranked player in the 2026 class, Tyran Stokes.[2][3] In July 2023, Dybantsa led the Nike Peach Jam in scoring with 25.8 points per game[4] as a member of Expressions Elite, an Amateur Athletic Union team from Boston.[5] Dybantsa will conclude his high school basketball career playing at Utah Prep in Hurricane, Utah, where he transferred for the 2024-25 season.[6] Utah Prep was previously RSL Basketball Academy in Herriman.

He scored 12 points in the gold medal game and averaged 13.8 points for the tournament.[4][7]",

The Utah Prep star is projected as a potential No. 1 pick in the 2026 NBA draft. Kevin Young coached with the Phoenix Suns and Philadelphia 76ers and has a staff of coaches and support staff who have also worked in the league.

                "content": "Taylor Lorenz is an American journalist who writes the Substack publication \"User Mag\". She was previously a columnist for The Washington Post, a technology reporter for The New York Times, The Daily Beast, and Business Insider, and social media editor for the Daily Mail. She is particularly known for covering Internet culture. In 2023, she published a book called Extremely Online: The Untold Story of Fame, Influence, and Power on the Internet. In 2024, she was a podcaster for Vox Media, hosting a show called Power User. Lorenz was born in New York City[1] and grew up in Old Greenwich, Connecticut, attending nearby Greenwich High School.[2] She attended college at the University of Colorado Boulder and later transferred to Hobart and William Smith Colleges, where she graduated with a degree in political science.[3][4] Lorenz has said that the social media site Tumblr caused her to become interested in Internet culture.[5] According to The Caret, Lorenz's reporting frequently concerns \"Silicon Valley venture capitalists, marketers and ... anyone curious about how the internet is shaping the ways in which humans express themselves and communicate\".[6] Fortune named her to its \"40 Under 40\" list in 2020, saying that she has \"cemented herself as a peerless authority\" whose name became \"synonymous with youth culture online\" during her time at The Daily Beast and The Atlantic.[7] The same year, Adweek included her on its list of \"Young Influentials Who Are Shaping Media, Marketing and Tech\", saying that she \"contextualizes the internet as we live it\".[8] Reason magazine credited her with popularizing the term \"OK boomer\" in a story declaring \"the end of friendly generational relations\".[9] According to TheWrap, \"since her time at the Times, she's attracted an inordinate amount of online criticism, particularly from those in the right-wing media\".[10] Lorenz worked as a social media editor for the Daily Mail from 2011 to 2014, becoming its head of social media.[11] After a short stint writing for The Daily Dot in 2014,[12] she was a technology reporter for Business Insider from 2014 to 2017.[13] In 2017, she wrote briefly for The Hill's blog section,[14][15] and was assaulted by a counter-protester[16] while covering the Unite the Right rally in Charlottesville, Virginia.[17] From 2017 to 2018, she worked as a technology reporter for The Daily Beast.[18] In 2019, she was a visiting fellow at Harvard University's Nieman Foundation for Journalism.[19] From 2019 to 2022, she was a technology reporter for The New York Times.[20] In March 2022, Lorenz left the Times and joined The Washington Post as a columnist.[3][21] In April 2022, Lorenz wrote an article for the Post that publicized the identity of Chaya Raichik as the owner of the far-right Twitter account Libs of TikTok. The details were retrieved from early iterations of the account[22] as well as previous reporting.[23] In attempt to discredit the article and Lorenz herself,[23][24] Raichik attacked Lorenz, claiming that Lorenz doxxed her.[25][26] According to The Times of London, \"supporters of Lorenz meanwhile pointed out that Raichik's followers were only too enthusiastic about doxing when it came to teachers being smeared as paedophiles\".[27] In a tweet, Lorenz said that her \"whole family was doxed again this morning ... trolls have now moved on to doxing and stalking any random friends I've tagged on Instagram\".[28] Lorenz later interviewed Raichik for an article about Libs of TikTok in February 2024.[29] In June 2022, the Post published an article by Lorenz about the eco-system of online content creators and influencers covering the Depp v. Heard trial. The article incorrectly said that two YouTubers mentioned in passing in the article had been contacted for comment, when the Post later reported that only one had been before publication,[30] though this is disputed by both YouTubers.[31] Ultimately, after editorial corrections were made, the Editor's Note on the article acknowledged that only one of the creators had been contacted before publication, and that stealth editing had occurred against the paper's policy, however Lorenz did not make the stealth edit. In a tweet thread agreed upon by Lorenz, her editors, and Post management, Lorenz stated that the errors were due to a miscommunication with her editor.[10][32][33] In August 2024, The Washington Post began an internal investigation for evidence of bias after Lorenz shared an image on a private Instagram story depicting President Joe Biden with the caption \"war criminal :(\", referencing a meme.[34] Lorenz initially denied making the post, and later said that a friend created the captioned picture, which Lorenz shared. According to NPR, four people with direct knowledge of the post confirmed its authenticity.[35] Lorenz never published another article for The Post, which did not announce its findings, and in October 2024, left the paper to focus on her own ventures.[36][34] In February 2024, it was announced that Lorenz would be launching a podcast with Vox Media called Power User.[37] In December 2024, it was announced that her distribution partnership would not be renewed.[38] Lorenz left The Washington Post in October 2024 to start her own Substack publication called \"User Mag\". Substack co-founder Hamish McKenzie told The Hollywood Reporter that she is an \"accomplished reporter with deep experience covering internet trends and culture\" whom the platform thinks \"will thrive...with the direct support of her audience.\"[39] In October 2023, her book Extremely Online: The Untold Story of Fame, Influence, and Power on the Internet was published by Simon & Schuster.[40] Lorenz has been the subject of online harassment, often used as a tactic to attempt to discredit her reporting and skills as a journalist.[24] The harassment has included graphic rape threats, death threats, and even threats against her parents and other family members, some of them children.[41] Some of the harassment that has targeted Lorenz has been coordinated, often boosted by right wing media personalities, such as Tucker Carlson.[42][43] The online harassment has spilled over into the physical world as well. Lorenz has been stalked,[24] and in 2022 \"a man who had been live-streaming violent threats about her turned up,\" at a conference she was speaking at, necessitating her to \"be escorted to safety\".[44] Furthermore, both she and her parents have been the victims of swatting.[44] In December 2022, Twitter owner Elon Musk temporarily suspended Lorenz's Twitter account, with Musk tweeting that the suspension was for \"prior doxxing action\".[45] Lorenz said she was suspended after asking Musk for comment on a story. The suspension followed a series of suspensions of journalists under Musk's new ownership of Twitter.[46] Lorenz announced her engagement to Christopher Mims, a technology columnist at The Wall Street Journal, in January 2015.[47] She identified herself as a vegan in 2022.[48] She has said in interviews that she is immunocompromised.[49]",

                "content": "Welcome to the Urgent Futures podcast! This podcast tries to clarify the chaos, from culture to the cosmos. Each episode, I sit down with leading thinkers for big idea dialogues about the research, concepts, and questions that animate their approaches to reality. 🎥 YouTube: 🎧 Apple Podcasts | Spotify Taylor Lorenz is a technology columnist for The Washington Post's business section covering online culture and the content creator industry. She was previously a technology reporter for The New York Times business section, The Atlantic, and The Daily Beast. Her writing has appeared in New York magazine, Rolling Stone, Outside magazine, and more. She frequently appears on NBC, CNN, MSNBC, CBS, and the BBC. She was a 2019 Knight Visiting Nieman Fellow at Harvard University and is a former affiliate at Harvard's Berkman Klein Center for Internet and Society. More bio information can be found here. Taylor's work hits one of the main goals I have in doing a podcast in the first place. I started Reality Studies because, over the past few years, I realized that a lot of us were asking variations of the same question: What happened to reality? And of course follow-ups of how and why did it get so weird? Are we living in a simulation? So I started researching these questions and even if I wasn't going to be able to answer them I wanted deeper context for them. I've written about some of the fruits of this research in the newsletter, but the podcast is a place to spotlight the folks who are doing the critical work of identifying and translating cultural shifts. Taylor epitomizes this. For years, she's been finding the niche corners of the internet and tech culture that the rest of mainstream media isn't taking seriously or outright dismissing. Her stories have documented how the commodification of attention has brought about new power structures, new economies, new creative ecosystems, new celebrities, and her book, Extremely Online, is out next week (Oct. 3). With Extremely Online, Taylor looks back more than 20 years to the early aughts to the days when bloggers first began to reshape our understandings of media, all the way through the present moment, when TikTok has become a medium for activists and political speech. Like her reporting, the book sidesteps the conventional hero narratives of Silicon Valley giants, instead foregrounding the stories of platform users and lesser-known innovators whose contributions have had deep impacts on our lives—which are now, of course, extremely online. Jesse Damiani: Taylor, thank you for being on the Reality Studies Podcast. Taylor Lorenz: Thanks for having me. JD: I'm really excited to talk about Extremely Online with you today. And the first thing that comes to mind with this book is a structural question. The history unfolds across a series of precedents that seem kind of obvious in hindsight—like the fact that YouTubers would need agents and security and sort of be treated like regular celebrities—but that wasn't necessarily clear early in the trajectory of creator culture. So these were like social experiments that were occurring in real time. What have you learned about creator culture in mapping these precedent-setting moments? TL: Yeah, well, one thing I learned is that the media is always kind of wrong and behind. It was funny to go back and read mainstream media news articles about the Internet and, literally I would say for the past 25 years they have downplayed it and minimized it every step of the way—not even just about creator culture but sort of everything and it was just interesting to reread it and just be like, God, time and time again, they keep getting it wrong, or they misread why something is compelling. I found actually that the most useful kind of coverage of that industry when I was doing my research was just not the mainstream media, it was more like blogs or some digital media and just kind of individual people that just wrote a lot about the times. It was interesting also how the industry evolved; it used to be very platform-specific. I write about this in the book, but, after Vine died, you see this era of multi-platform creators. So it's just interesting how one little event could have ripple effects across the industry. JD: My first real entry into social media was MySpace—and when I was reading this and seeing the different waves and the different ways that different companies either succeeded or didn't, I wondered: do you think these events were preordained to happen the way that they did? Or were they the type of things that were just circumstantial and we could have lived in a world where MySpace would have been the main player in the social media game? TL: I think, you know, so much of it’s about timing. I think MySpace was so ahead of its time. This is another trend that I saw in writing is that there were these people who were so early, and actually saw the future before anybody else. I think MySpace's vision of the future and how they talked about entertainment and media is 100% basically the way TikTok talks about it now—MySpace had MySpace TV but it was still very web-based back then. They were thinking about social media how it would be thought about in 15 years, but they were trying to build it at this time when being online itself was still very stigmatized and weird and people didn't necessarily want to add a lot of friends online; that wasn’t the norm yet outside of teenagers and people our age who thought it was cool. The technology itself and the social norms had to change for the right products to take off. I would say it’s 50% right place-right time, because there were a lot of people I think would’ve been very successful if they had just been a little bit later. JD: One thing that we take for granted now is this (very contested) notion of cancel culture, but you referenced this early moment from 2002 with the ‘Internet's First Scalp.’ I'd love if you could share what happened there and what you see it communicating about this clash between old and new media formats. TL: Yeah, I talk about Josh Marshall, who was an early political blogger. He worked at the American Prospect by day, but he would blog by night at Talking Points Memo, which is now actually his independent media company. It was a birthday party for Strom Thurmond. There was a toast given by Senate Majority Leader at the time, Trent Lott, who basically made a bunch of praise for some of the worst of Strom Thurmond's ideologies and seemed to support segregation. And this was something that went over the heads of a lot of inside political writers in the mainstream media, who kind of ignored those comments and just wrote a quick item about the birthday celebration. But Josh noticed that comment, he pulled it out, and he did what bloggers do best, which is do like 20 posts on it, and relentlessly cover it until Trent Lott was forced to resign. The New York Post ran a headline that was titled, “The Internet’s First Scalp,” and it was about how people on the Internet, specifically bloggers and Josh Marshall were able to get Trent Lott kicked out of office. There were so many examples of things like this, actually, I really just liked that headline—and because it affected our entire political landscape. But you saw these little moments time and time again of the insurgent power of people online to have real meaningful change and to circumvent the mainstream media and up-end politics, fashion, sports, you name it. JD: This history really looks at the past two decades, and this period is this crucible in which social media is forged. There are countless instances where the “old guard” has totally dismissed or tried to bypass social media platforms and practices. Toward the end of the book, for example, you reference venture capitalists trying to use their positions with startups like Clubhouse to burnish their own brands as influencers, but then Clubhouse didn't necessarily find the success that they were hoping for. Has this dynamic just repeated itself again and again, or have you found that the old guard ever gets savvier? TL: Yeah, it's very funny because I think venture capitalists learn that you cannot force specific people to be popular on your platform, which Elon is learning today. You can try to force-feed these people down other people's throats and you're going to lose users that way. Clubhouse found that out the hard way. My book ends a couple years into the pandemic, that's when everyone was really forced, obviously, to all be extremely online, and that's when a lot of institutional powers were forced to take it seriously, because suddenly everyone was online. And they were like, “Wait a minute, what's happening over here? This world we've ignored for literally 20 years…maybe there's something here.” So you saw VCs pour money into the dumbest startups alive, to be honest, because they had ignored it for decades, and then they were funding things that nobody wanted or needed—also there's already this robust half a trillion dollar industry that they just ignored. I was talking to a friend of mine who's a VC, and she read the book as well, and she's like, “Not all VCs,” and it's true, like The Chernin Group invested in Barstool Sports early and a bunch of other creator-driven media companies—but they're not generally the Silicon Valley tech VCs, who are notorious for coming in at the last minute and trying to make money off something they have no idea about. I think they’re all in AI world right now. So it was just kind of funny to see they had missed the boat on that so badly, because the ones that did get into it in 2010, or even 2007, and recognized this stuff early, they made a lot of money. In terms of traditional media: I work in traditional media and I can tell you they absolutely do not get it at all. I think they've tried a little bit more and they recognize that they have to use the internet. There are people within these institutions that are brilliant and amazing; it's not really the workers, it's the management that sort of is just very slow to sort of grasp that it’s not the nineties and they don't control the media. The media is the internet now. The media is not the New York Times and The Washington Post—for good or bad. There's a lot of pluses and minuses to that. [MySpace was] thinking about social media how it would be thought about in 15 years, but they were trying to build it at this time when being online itself was still very stigmatized and weird … a lot of people I think would’ve been very successful if they had just been a little bit later. JD: Would you be willing to share a little bit more about like, you're somebody who kind of dances across both of these worlds, like, when you're thinking about your work of covering creator culture, and in some ways, sort of adopting creator tactics, while also being somebody who's a columnist at, I mean, your pedigree is all these major media organizations. How are you thinking about that, that balance? TL: Yeah, I am very much from the internet and I always sort of care about the internet more than I care about traditional media. But working in traditional media has been so interesting, because I've really seen why they can’t catch up. I used to write a lot of really negative things about the mainstream media when I was a blogger, and now that I work in it, I have a lot more empathy for it, for the people inside of it. Again, it's generally not the reporters. It's this management level; it's the same as in Congress. Our whole country is like run by this gerontocracy that refuses to give up power and is not with the times, and that's true for media, it's true for politics, it's true for literally name any industry—so I think there has to be some turnover before anything really changes. JD: So you referenced blogging. One thing I was really struck by early in the book that I maybe peripherally understood, but you bring into focus, is the impact of “mommy bloggers.” Your book is chronicling the commoditization of attention as power and mommy bloggers are this first kind of, I don't know, flashpoint in that trajectory. Could you share a little bit about the role that mommy bloggers have played? TL: Yeah, I would say they were like literal mothers to this whole industry. It's kind of crazy. I think a lot of people think of the creator industry as like YouTubers, or beginning with YouTubers, and that's not true. It really began with bloggers and specifically mommy bloggers, because mommy bloggers—which itself is this very fraught term that some women came to embrace and a lot of other women felt was deeply misogynistic—they dealt with so much misogyny and hate for what they were doing. But as I mentioned, there were these other bloggers, especially in tech and politics, that were getting lauded and able to get attention online, people like Josh Marshall. And then you had moms, a lot of mothers, basically a whole generation of Gen X mothers that were shut out of the workplace and turned to blogging to express themselves. They were the first to build a personal brand online and then monetize it. And they were just brutalized for it. People were just so angry that mothers would make money online. It was like this notion that motherhood was so sacred and like, ‘How could you monetize your life as a mother?’ They were attacked as being attention seekers. Like, ‘Why do you have to blog about your life?’ You know, ‘Why aren't you just happy at home? You should be cooking for your children, why are you on the Internet?’ The thing is, the Internet was such a lifeline for these mothers because motherhood is incredibly isolating and women's media at the time was deeply misogynist. I went back and read so much women's media from the ‘90s and Aughts for this book and it was just disgusting. It's actually like bizarre; stuff from 2005 reads like it’s from the 1950s. Mommy bloggers were the ones that normalized things like postpartum depression, and, you know, not always loving your kids, and just having a hard time, struggling, coping with addiction, turning to wine during playtime to make it through, hating your husband—just all these taboo topics that had never really been expressed in traditional media, mothers were able to go online and talk about and then make money, supporting themselves through it. So it was just really liberating and fascinating. JD: And you reference some highly visible misogynistic moments, like with Julia Allison and other women throughout the book, which is a parallel stream to women and femmes being the ones who often were the innovators of particular cultural and social practices. Can you talk a little bit more about that dynamic? TL: Yeah, this whole industry was built primarily by women and then secondarily other people that were basically marginalized, a lot of LGBTQ people, people of color, just people that would have never ended up in mainstream media. That's who fostered this whole blogging ecosystem and then really used the Internet very early to monetize. I don't get it into it in my book because it was so niche and separate from this main industry, but sex workers were also really early adopters of the internet and online monetization. I talk about that later with OnlyFans, which I think was the first true creator-driven sex work platform. But yeah, it was just all women and people were obviously livid at it because I think since the beginning there's just been this deep misogyny against women and women's work and women's role in society. JD: You also brought up BIPOC creators; 2020 was this big year of reckoning around systemic oppression broadly, but within the creator subsection it was also a moment of reckoning around people of color being exploited and extracted from in social media platforms. Could you A) describe that for listeners, and then B) I'm curious what you've observed, you know, it's been three years now, what movement or not you’ve seen on that front? TL: Throughout the Aughts and 2010s, you had a lot of viral moments coming from people of color, I talk about Tay Zonday, Adam Bahner, in my book, who wrote the “Chocolate Rain” song, and there's Peaches Monroee, who created the phrase “on fleek,” and so many vines specifically, there was just a lot of obviously, culture, created from those communities. And then in 2020, obviously, there was this big reckoning and people started to talk about credit and ownership. I talk about Jalaiah Harmon, who made the “Renegade” dance, who was a story that I wrote about this 14 year old that made one of the biggest dances on the internet and also never got credit until we wrote the story for the New York Times, basically. And so, there was this moment when people started to go like, “Oh, actually we should pay these people.” Unfortunately, as with every other bit of progress that was made in 2020, it flipped back very hard the other way. And now almost no one cares—there’s no discussion of it at brands. I saw a chart released by some company recently where they show spending on creators of color has gone down from pre-2020 levels. So they're in sort of a worse position than they were previously. I think unfortunately that's just the case with all the social progress that was made in 2020. I've talked to people about why this is, and it’s because, for so many reasons, but there was no sustained pressure. Nobody wanted to make systemic change. A lot of people wanted to talk about it because it was trendy at the time, but nobody actually wanted to change the system. So we have a worse system now, which sucks. The reason I end the book where I do, which is in 2022-ish, is because I think that was the end of a certain chapter of social media. JD: Related to that, another thing that really emerged in 2020 was TikTok as a vector for political communication, both from politicians externally, but more predominantly people spreading political messaging and fostering information ecosystems. When you bring up progress, how are you feeling as we're heading into another election year, with TikTok as strong as it ever was and more vehicles for video-based messaging? TL: TikTok has always been such a really important platform for activism and activists, especially youth activism, young people who want social change have leveraged TikTok very effectively. I think that's why you see all these Republicans embracing it—Vivek Ramaswamy was out with Jake Paul on TikTok the other day—so it's just going to play a bigger and bigger role in our political system because it's the default social network for millions of young people. I always describe TikTok as a combination of Twitter and YouTube, where there was all this like academia and like political discussion and actually a lot of smart people and journalists and stuff. Actually, not as many journalists as Twitter, but you know, there's enough like media on there—and then also with YouTube culture where it's very video based. Commentary culture is really huge on TikTok. So I think it’s just going to play a bigger and bigger role in our election cycles. Not the platform itself. People like to think that it's being programmed by China or something. It's not, or there's absolutely no evidence of that. I just mean people leveraging the platform, activists and people leveraging the platform to get the word out about whatever they're trying to talk about. JD: So this is not in the book, but, just to piggyback off that question, because I've seen you speak about this elsewhere and I'd love to discuss it with you. There's a lot of geopolitical positioning around TikTok in particular. What do you make of that relative to the sort of Western tech giants? Yeah, it's so hilarious to listen to these people talk about TikTok as if it's the greatest threat when we have Facebook here in our own country. They're worried that TikTok could potentially, you know, disrupt an election, when we have actual evidence that Facebook has done that many, many times. They're worried that Tiktok could like, lead people to violence when we have so many examples of Facebook facilitating genocide in other countries. It's like all of the stuff that they're accusing that TikTok might do, that there's no evidence TikTok has actually done or facilitated, we have overwhelming with so many examples of Facebook actually doing those things and actually facilitating those things. So it's just like, ‘Oh, but it's fine because it's America.” Also, by the way, the whole data privacy thing is such a farce. If they cared about data privacy, they would pass comprehensive data privacy reform. But if you shut down TikTok tomorrow, first of all there's still so many other Chinese apps and gaming, which is the bigger form of entertainment than anything else and is like half-owned by Chinese companies. So I can't even get into that, but like, also: China could buy our data from a third-party Facebook vendor. We have no data privacy. So if you're actually caring about data privacy to the extent that you want to shut down an app, make such an unprecedented decision, then you should actually pass a lot more comprehensive data privacy reform before anything like that ever even happens. But of course, they don't want to do that. They just want to make a political bogeyman. And it is this place for young progressive activism, that's why you see the Republicans and right-wing parties wanting to shut it down, because it's a place where young people congregate and push a lot of progressive ideology. JD: You prompted me to think about that report from the Wall Street Journal about Facebook knowing that Instagram was detrimental to adolescent women's mental health. And mental health comes up in Extremely Online as well, with this metrics game-the-algorithm culture, which I think would have felt really foreign if you'd rewound to the nineties and talked to the techno-utopians and said, “People are going to feel so strung out because they're running on this hamster wheel, and that's one of the primary effects of these platforms.” Could you share a little bit about, some of what's happened relative to mental health on these platforms and among creator communities? TL: These platforms basically put their creators, as you said, on a treadmill. There's no off-ramp. Being a creator is incredibly, incredibly difficult and there's almost no respect for it. There's no like institutional respect in the sense that we don't have a social safety net in this country at all. So these, these people are essentially independent contractors for these companies, but they have no benefits. They have no support. They can't take a week off without losing followers, losing money. So it's a very hard job. And it of course affects mental health and social media. I think making metrics public was the original sin of social media. It's so negative because it puts this social pressure on everyone to like, make sure you get that extra like, or make sure you get an extra hit, a certain follower numbers, because that says something about your social value. It's just very toxic. And I don't think that the Internet is inherently toxic, or the fact that it facilitates connection, the notion of social technology, I think is not toxic. We should be more connected. I hate this idea of like, “Oh, you just have to log off and the more you log off, the more mentally healthy you are.” I think you can spend literally 24/7 online. It's just that the way that we use the Internet and most of the platforms that we're forced to rely on right now are these really predatory ones. I wish that wasn't the case, I wish we had a much better social media landscape. But I hate that the the focus is on logging off. It's like, don't tell everyone to stop logging on. Tell everyone to like, let's build better systems to facilitate better connection. Because people's lives aren't inherently better when they log off either. JD: Yeah, it's often discounted that this is a whole architecture of power. It's a driver of the entire global economy now. And you sort of make the point, like, even if you're not part of any, platform you'll still be in other people's photos, your footprint is still traveling around these platforms. I'd love to talk a little bit about fandom with you. It's funny for me as a millennial, I feel like I grew up with all these platforms, and I had varying degrees of connection to them and to what was going on. I saw this stuff happening in the background, but it was kind of in the background of my everyday life. One service that I think this book provides is it really contextualizes things and gives you this 20 year history with the flashpoint moments to engage with. One thread that I saw evolving throughout is this idea of fandom. Can you describe how you've seen fandom evolve and maybe some moments, like some of the tours, that rendered visible how different, creator culture was? Or rather, how much more social capital being a creator had than people originally realized? TL: Creators were building these fandoms online, but they were very segregated to the internet, right? People that didn't spend time online could sort of write it off, they didn't have visibility into those fandoms because they weren't spending time online. They didn't see it. So once things started to really manifest in the real world was when people started to notice. I talk about this early Vine meet up, that a bunch of Vine creators had in Central Park, and that being kind of a moment. It used to be creators meeting up with each other. There were things like the 777 Meetup on July 7th, 2007 in Washington Square Park, where a bunch of YouTubers met up. But at that time, like in, I would say 2010 and earlier, it was more about like YouTubers meeting up with each other. Even the first VidCon was still very much like YouTubers meeting up with each other, but I would say that actually the first VidCon was also this turning point because there were fans, but it was very early fandom and they had full access to the creators. There wasn't this strong delineation between who was a creator and who was a fan. It really wasn't until kind of like 2013, 2014, 2015, when you started to see these real fandoms emerge, that's when you saw tours. You had content creators going on mall tours. Companies like Buca di Beppo even had a content creator tour. That was my favorite example because I found all their signage for it and it was so funny. Like, “Hey, look, we have like Internet stars at book Buca di Beppo, come to Buca di Beppo!” Like, what? But they were trying to capitalize on this like youth fandom. Obviously Magcon, if you guys haven't watched Chasing Cameron on Netflix, it's such a time capsule. It's a documentary about Magcon from like 2015 or 2016. Magcon was one of the original influencer tourists, it stands for “meet and greet.” So yeah, you started to see fandom manifest IRL. And then now I think all the platforms are so big and everyone is online that it's very clear who has fans; like you see the fandom. It's become more pervasive and recognized. It used to be like, “Oh, those are just like internet fans,” and now it’s like, “Oh, it’s all the same.” [Misogyny] was such a through line in reporting this book: all these incredible women who have been driven off the internet by hate. JD: I remember when BeReal was having its moment in the sun, there was a lot of talk about how it was somehow not playing into some of these more complicated threads of social media. What are you thoughts on that? Do you see any other glimmers that social media is shifting toward less rankings or gamified examples, or is it really just doubling down? TL: I would say mostly it's doubling down, but yeah, there's a lot of small viral apps that haven't proven to have staying power, but they sort of tap into something. BeReal’s an example of that. The reason I end the book where I do, which is in 2022-ish, is because I think that was the end of a certain chapter of social media. As the pandemic has pushed everyone online, especially in 2020, I think there's a level of exhaustion. I think people today are starting to value privacy more. We've gone so far where like, we are in this mass surveillance culture where everyone just records everyone else. You know, “Oh, I see something crazy. I'm going to record it because that could be a viral moment online, because we all understand that that's a commodity now.” I think that's why you see people actually wanting to use these smaller platforms like BeReal where it's more contained or like group chat or Discord or places where you're not default sharing everything publicly and permanently. That era of social media, it's a little bit over. It's not really novel to like, have every thought be public. I think if you want to reach everyone, you can post on these platforms, but it's more about reaching who you want to. Even TikTok is more about reaching who you want to than Instagram, Twitter, or YouTube, because the algorithm segments you and you trust that it will deliver your content to the relevant audience. Whereas all these other problems you're posting publicly and you have to build your own subscribers and it's a lot of burden on the user. JD: Do you see part of where you chose to draw this line around 2022ish correlating it all to Gen Z officially being the “it” generation or are those two things incidental to each other? TL: I think 2017 was the moment that Gen Z became the “it” generation. I wrote a piece that year actually about Gen Z consultants and how consulting for Gen Z stuff was taking off. That's when brands really started to flip and target Gen Z. So I think we're actually more in the middle of Gen Z; it's more just like average people have all gotten very online. The pandemic accelerated a lot of change that was happening, but now we're there. Everyone has an online footprint. Everyone's online. It's not just the kids. It's affecting politics, sports, fashion, entertainment—every single aspect of our culture is so shaped and driven by the Internet now. And so I wanted to end it there because I felt like we had reached that point. It was less about a specific generation maturing. I did see some marketing report about Gen Alpha recently and I was like, “Are we even thinking about that already?” Like there's so many generations. One other thing that I thought was notable or kind of changed my own perception is I think as a millennial—I'm with you. I'm like smack—dab, like true millennial millennial. I had always thought that millennials were the first generation to really leverage the internet and grow up on social media, which is sort of true, but actually all those early bloggers were Gen X—like those mommy bloggers were Gen X—and even Keemstar or Ethan Klein at H3H3, like these big YouTubers, are Gen X. A lot of them are a little bit older than we think. The Internet is thought of as this thing that's driven by young people. I mean, Jeffree Star is Gen X! So many Gen Xers actually have shaped the Internet. And I think they deserve more credit. I know people say that they're always an overlooked generation, and I think their contributions to the Internet have been overlooked. I know they're cringy online sometimes, but they really did a lot. JD: My partner's son is a Gen Alpha and there's definitely a sense that like, no matter how cool I would ever want to try to be on the internet, that I'm always going to be cringe. So I think there's this generational thing where you sort of reject whatever the previous generation did—and I wonder how long that lasts too. Because as you're describing, Gen X bust down the walls, millennials are much more platform-oriented, and now there's this proliferation of platforms, but then how different does that become in the future? That depends on a lot of factors in terms of technology and other things that are out of our ability to accurately forecast. Thinking about your rolein this: you kind of defined the digital culture beat. It wasn't something people took seriously, before you. And now there's a whole crop of people who cite you as their main influence in this type of coverage. This being your first big book, can you talk me through a little bit of the creative process and decision-making process in picking what pieces of this puzzle to highlight? Because in some ways, there are inevitably holes, because there were so few people even covering it in the first place—so even going back to the historical work I assume was pretty complicated. TL: Yeah, it was really hard. From 2009-on, that's when I was writing and covering things. I lived through this and I have sources, so it was easy. What was very hard was the Aughts. I would say shout out to Todd Spangler at Variety. I don't know that I could have written this book without Todd's writing. He deserves more credit. I should have given him acknowledgement; I gave it to a lot of women, but like there were these writers. Josh Constine at TechCrunch was another one. They ended up covering a lot of this stuff really early and really well, on digital media sites generally. But yeah, the Aughts were what was really hard. I had to go back and just interview so many people. I have interviewed hundreds of people for the book, but there was a lot of what I've learned now is called link rot—which actually happened to me; my earliest, my first bylines are not even on the internet anymore because the websites I wrote for were like bought and defunct or pivoted or whatever. I could have never written this book without the Internet Archive. Like the internet archive is such an important resource. It's so funny because Elon Musk was saying that my family owned it or something a while ago, and the founder was like, “We don't know her and we don't claim her,” But they deserve all the money in the world because the work that they're doing to preserve websites and old pieces of media is just really important because I was relying on that heavily. I opened with this story about this blog called Socialite Rank; if that wasn't completely preserved on the Internet Archive, we would not have a historical record of it. We would have, like, maybe a New York magazine article that was written after the fact that was sort of a short piece that didn't cover everything. It's just so important to have that source material. I'll say one other thing. I'm just so glad that there's more writers now. There's not even nearly enough. I mean, there's more reporters covering Facebook—just Facebook as a company—than there are Internet culture reporters. And I think that says so much about how we view tech reporting. I wish that we had like 50 more reporters on this beat. JD: Why do you think there's resistance? When I look at your work and when I look at Kat Tenbarge’s work, Katie Notopoulos’s work, I'm assuming highly trafficked stories. It's not as if these are not proving themselves out in the metrics. What do you think the resistance is in terms of staffing appropriately to cover these stories? TL: It’s what comes with it. The attention that the attention is the problem. Every major story I do goes viral because I'm writing about huge personalities. I'm writing about people usually with millions of followers that are going to respond. I'm writing about things that everyone's talking about or has strong opinions on or that's trending or whatever. If you do the job well, you are in their world, right? You are in this content creator universe where it's crazy. You're operating in this new media ecosystem that's an attention driven ecosystem that's been weaponized by the worst people in the world. So you as a media company need to stand by your reporters. This is why the New York Times—no offense—doesn't do internet culture reporting well, because they're not willing to go into those spaces and truly cover them. You have a couple of reporters that might dip in one, you know, now and then, but they don't have anybody actually covering it. That's why they cover everything like two months too late. I will say though, Jessica Roy is very good and she's been writing for them lately, and she's extremely with it, and Joe Bernstein as well, but I think it's so funny that those two writers are on the style section. That just shows how they view it, like, “Oh, it's this silly little thing over here. It's not like a core thing that's upending everything in our political landscape and economy.” I think it's just so hard for traditional media. They're very scared of the Internet. They're very scared of it and they don't know how to react when when attention is driven their way. And they don't they don't know what to do, and the reporters themselves are often driven out of the industry. I can think of three women right now who are phenomenal, phenomenal reporters who were driven out of the industry—off of this beat specifically—because of online harassment and hate and doxing and crazy shit that they've had to deal with. So you also have to be really good at dealing with that. And I would say, I started in this world in 2009, and I feel like—what is the metaphor of the boiling frog? Like, everything that happened to me with, like, writing about Libs of TikTok, I was like, Jake Paul fans have done this to me years before. I'm old enough too where it doesn't affect my life as much, but these young reporters, they're even more online. Their lives are even more mediated by the Internet. It's very hard for them. And if they don't have institutional support they can't do their job. JD: I'm remembering this moment where, I think it was either right before or right after you had departed New York Times, there was this public exchange with Maggie Haberman that I found to be really telling. And it's not necessarily age or generational, because of course, as you sort of pointed out, there are very savvy and thoughtful, older reporters—but it was kind of an older sensibility about how a reporter is supposed to comport themselves and the certain types of objectivity they're supposed to maintain, and the persona— TL: It wasn't about objectivity, though, it was about having a personal brand. First of all, I don't believe in objectivity. It's a lie. And I think Wes Lowery has written excellent pieces dismantling that notion. But yeah. I had said in an interview—actually, I was asked the question about journalists having personal brands—and I was like, yes, journalists have to have personal brands, especially on the internet these days. It's a very talent driven industry. And Maggie, who had of course 1.7 million followers, and I would say almost no one is more of a personal brand than her, especially during the Trump administration, came after me for it and said that I was an attention-seeker and all this negative stuff. I just thought that was hilarious because, look in the mirror, what are you talking about? You are a perfect example of this. You have 1. 7 million Twitter followers; don't talk to me about personal brands. But I think as you said, it's this old-school notion—she didn't have to build her personal brand. She didn't have to do any of that because she relied on the platform of the institution. Now institutions don't have power. And if you want to survive in this landscape where we're all getting laid off 24/7, which any millennial that worked in digital media or any Gen Z person can relate to, you do actually have to have a brand on the Internet. I don't think that that's necessarily a great thing because I think there's a lot of amazing reporters that don't want to cultivate it necessarily. I talked to a friend who's actually still at the New York Times, a phenomenal investigative reporter, and he's like, “Yeah, even I have to have a personal brand. That doesn't mean that I'm on TikTok, but I'm known as this investigator and I have to be really careful to cultivate this personality around that and cultivate my image around it. You have to do that just to operate—media has always been this way. Look at Anderson Cooper. Look at Barbara Walters. Look at like any big journalist, Woodward and Bernstein, right? It's a talent business. So yes, unfortunately we have to have brands. And we all have to have brands, by the way. JD: Yeah I was very surprised to see that as well. And just building on that, do you have a heuristic or a set of boundaries in your mind for how a reporter can maintain a certain degree of reliability and authenticity with audience that you are attempting to cover something in a fair and balanced way (not in the weaponized sense)? In terms of having a brand that participates in creator culture while also being respected as somebody covering it. Are there any guardrails you can reference? TL: That's always been true for any culture reporter, right? It's like, of course, culture reporters that wrote about music and film or whatever, just culture in general, we live in culture, all of us do. You can't opt out of culture. And by the way, same with politics, like these political reporters like to think that, “Oh, I'm objective or I don't vote because I, because I'm a political reporter” It's like, what are you talking about? We all live in a political world. This is just the world that we all live in. I think the most important thing is to be fair and to be accurate and to be truthful. That's the most important thing. So sometimes I'm writing about somebody that maybe I don't personally love, but I'm accurate and truthful and fair, and I think it's better for me to be open and be like, “Look, yeah, I'm not personally a fan of this YouTuber or something, but I'm reporting on them fairly, and everything that's reported is truthful and accurate.” Just the way that a music writer, of course, they're not going to not listen to music and abstain from music because they have to be objective, like, they're going to like certain artists better than others, and that might shape what they choose to cover; they might want to cover a band that they really like that maybe wouldn't normally get covered or something. But, you know, it's their job to report on the industry, whether, you know, whether or not they like Taylor Swift, right? Like they're going to have to report on her tour being a huge success. This is what I think Wes Lowery is just so good at. He wrote this excellent piece and he's more articulate than I am on it, but it's like this false idea of objectivity where objectivity is really just one ideology and set of opinions that a lot of old white rich men hold. And that's considered the objective opinion, right? It's obviously a farce. The most important thing is to be truthful. I'm such an open book. If somebody asked me my opinion on something, I'll happily tell my opinion, but I don't let that opinion affect my work. I mean, we all decide what to cover based off things we're interested in, of course, or accountability things that we're focused on, but you know, it's so silly, all those conversations, because this has always been the case. And by the way, newspapers make political decisions all the time. Any kind of investigative journalism is inherently political, you know, if you're investigating gun violence deaths and putting together this big picture around gun violence, that says you have a specific outcome that you want. So I think we should just be more transparent about it because what readers don't trust is when you try and say that, “Oh no, I'm a completely neutral person.” It's like, well, no one is, we all live in the world. JD: You referenced rich white men and bias, and of course everybody's talking about Isaacson’s biography: the elephant in the room of media discourse is Elon Musk for the foreseeable future. Do you have any thoughts about where that is all heading? TL: Yeah. I definitely was reading all the excerpts that I could because I cover Elon sometimes and I wanted to know what he'd found. I wanted to write my book because my reporting always focuses not on those people. I wanted to write a book that was about the other side of tech, because I think so much of how we've understood the rise of social media is through these corporate narratives that center these men, like, I mean, The Social Network, right? That's the defining way that people understand the rise of social media, is through these narratives that just center Silicon Valley boy geniuses and powerful men. And every single tech book has to be like a company book. You know, we have like 10 WeWork books or we have the YouTube book and the Instagram book—which I love, by the way, Sarah Frier’s No Filter’s right behind me [referencing her bookshelf], it’s extremely good—but I think we need alternatives to that too. We need books that zoom out and tell the users’ side and look at these creators and look at the industry around it and how it's been shaped, because social platforms are very unique. They have a very symbiotic relationship with the user base. It's not like these tech geniuses just built these products and then everyone uses them how they want. In fact, quite the opposite. Usually the tech people had no idea what's going on, and a lot of them succeeded despite themselves. So for me, I didn't want to write another tech book that was just about some, you know, powerful man or some man that fell from grace, like SBF or whatever. I wanted to write about these other people who have been basically written out of history, and tell the story of social media through a cultural lens, not just through these tech Silicon Valley narratives. JD: I really appreciate that. And it makes for a much more, surprising and enriching reading experience. I have a few recurring, lightning-round style questions. You've answered them to a certain extent earlier, so feel free to repeat yourself. What's one thing you wish people paid more attention to? TL: Oh God, I mean misogyny on the internet. I'm gonna say it. Because that was such a through line in reporting this book: all these incredible women who have been driven off the internet by hate and it made me sad. JD: What's one resource you would recommend for making better sense of reality? TL: Oh, really good question. TikTok, I think people that don't use Tik Tok should spend time on it because it is a real window into culture today. It's such a defining, important platform. I think people should check it out. JD: What's one moment where your sense of reality was disrupted? TL: I guess when COVID hit, I was like, what is happening? I actually had a lot of beliefs about human nature and all this stuff before COVID that I now have completely changed my mind on. I used to think people were inherently good and I don't think that anymore. I think people are inherently evil. JD: You just feel like because of what was put on display when the pandemic came down? TL: Actually, it was what happened after in 2020. That was a really good year in the sense that people had a lot of solidarity and seem to care about other people. I'm severely immunocompromised and very sick. And so in 2020 was like, “Oh, people are having solidarity and clapping for the healthcare workers,” and now it’s like, “Oh, they’re banning masks and everyone can die. And we're going to have absolutely no systemic solutions to this virus that continues to maim and kill millions of people.” I lost another person I love to it that just several months ago, it's just horrible. It's horrible. And no one cares. In fact, there's real hostility, and I think a real eugenicist sort of thinking that's emerged out of COVID—which I learned is actually very common. Following the previous pandemic in 1919 as well, eugenics became this huge thing. I think we're seeing that now with this notion of vulnerable people where you can just die, like, hurry up and die because the rest of us are going to be fine. That's not true. Eventually you will get sick and die. That is true for everyone, whether it's old age or cancer or something. We all die, actually, and we all become vulnerable. You might not be medically vulnerable now, but you will be. And so I think it's really horrifying. The public sentiment, especially from political leaders, that’s what's really scary, the normalization of that thinking. And I'm like, “Oh damn, I thought we were better than that.” Now I think everyone is sort of inherently bad and we have to build societies to facilitate good behavior among people and caring about other people. We don't have a very collectivist society. We live in like one of the most individualistic countries in the world. And I think that's why we have, outside of China, which is just so much bigger than us, the highest rate of COVID deaths in the world still right now. JD: I remember reading—all caveats that the numbers could be off and whatever. But I remember reading something to the effect that, given the projected spread of COVID over the next 10 or 20 years or something like that, that we're essentially going to be dealing with like 20 percent of the population, in some way, large and small, affected by long term deleterious health impacts from COVID, which was really striking when you have, yeah, political leaders saying like, “It's done, let's go back to work.” TL: Yeah, sorry to all the sick and disabled people. You can just die. And by the way, there's absolutely no safety net for you. So if you do get disabled, you are dead to the world because we're living in this hyper-capitalist society where as soon as you lose value as a worker, your life loses value. And it's very sad to see leftists parrot at this stuff. Because no one has defended the capitalist state more than these leftists that also want to pretend that COVID is over. And it's scary because people have, like, socialist in their bio, and they're just like, “Oh, you can't work. You're useless.” It's like, “What are you guys talking about?” So it makes me very sad, it's one of the few things that I would have thought that nothing could get me to change my mind about previously. But now my mind is totally changed. JD: Let's rewind to pre-Covid because one thing I really did want to talk about with you is, you reference in your acknowledgements how Tumblr saved your life, and also that your taylorlorenz3.0 community was really supportive in making decisions around the book. I'd love to hear a little bit about those episodes in your life. TL: Yeah, I do think tumblr saved my life because I was so depressed before tumblr. So I got on tumblr in 2009. I wasn't really on the Internet before. I actually didn't have MySpace. I had Facebook in college, obviously, like every other person, but I wasn't really online until Tumblr and, Tumblr completely opened my world and got me everything in life. So I love Tumblr. And yeah, I have a bunch of accounts online that are just for fun, including my like, funny meme account. I've always had accounts like that. But I just love the community that I have online and my community of followers. I'm the most indecisive person ever, so when I had to make decisions about the book, I would always do polls and stuff, and they would always give me advice and help me, and obviously they're the ones that have pre-ordered my book and really supported me throughout my career and they support my work. I'm just so grateful to anyone that follows me and engages with my work and supports my work because I couldn't do it without them, you know, so shout out to all the followers. JD: Are there things that could happen at the level of creator culture or tech infrastructure of social media platforms that would maybe give you some more faith in the inherent goodness for humanity? Or maybe a cleaner way of phrasing the question is: what would you identify as something that's desperately needed in the social media creator ecosystems? TL: Well, I think because people are so inherently evil and bad that we really need technology to bring out the best in us. We need technology that brings us together and helps us create community in powerful and meaningful ways, and can help facilitate true connection between people and true understanding and empathy. Right now we have platforms that strip empathy, right? We have platforms that sew division and actually feed into the worst of human nature. My hope is that we build new, less profit-driven social technology that can help connect us and help build bonds. The Internet's power is as a connector of people. That is the whole point of the internet is to connect people. So I think we need to build more platforms that actually do that. And, you know, I don't know what that looks like, but it definitely does not look like Facebook and Twitter and Instagram, you know? JD: Definitely. All right, well, the book, I've got Extremely Online here, but you also have the official copies on your shelf. It's out October 3rd. TL: Yes, you have the rare collector's edition before I changed the cover to gold. Actually, it's out on pre-order now, so please pre-order. Pre-orders are like the only thing that matters for books, but you can get it officially in bookstores October 3rd. JD: Amazing. And where can people find you and information about the book in the meantime? TL: Yeah, on Instagram. I'm just at Taylor Lorenz on Instagram. I'm also on TikTok. And I'm on YouTube now at Taylor Lorenz. So the only platform I don't use anymore for news and tech stuff is Twitter. So everywhere else you can follow me. I'm on threads. We'll see if that goes anywhere and blue sky and all those other. JD: Amazing. Well, Taylor, thank you so much for being here. It's been a super illuminating conversation, and I really appreciate your book. TL: Thank you so much for having me. This was so fun. This podcast is edited and produced by me, Jesse Damiani.

                "content": "McDonald's restaurant, where an employee alerted authorities to a customer who was found with a weapon and writings linking him to the the brazen Manhattan killing of UnitedHealthcare's CEO, Monday, Dec. 9, 2024, in Altoona, Pa. (AP Photo/Gene J. Puskar)AP Negative online reviews for McDonald’s restaurants in Altoona, Pa. started piling up Monday after an employee called police, leading to the arrest of a customer in connection with the killing of the UnitedHealthcare CEO. Negative comments rolled in for at least five different McDonald’s locations listed in Altoona on the Yelp website. One restaurant that normally received one Yelp review every month or two, received about 100 one-star reviews, the lowest ranking possible, on Monday. Many reviews featured outlandish stories or jokes with political commentary about the killing, which has sparked a nationwide discussion about health insurance companies denying claims. “This fast food restaurant houses a traitor among its employees,” the first review posted Monday said. “The working class has betrayed humanity.” Other reviews mentioned finding “rats,” a reference to someone who deserts one’s side or cause. “Very large rat behind the counter,” another reviewer said. “Not very nutritional food. I’ve heard the employees get free food for working a shift--hope they have health insurance to cover the future heart attacks. .! oh wait.” United Healthcare appeared to have made its coverage policies and procedures more stringent during CEO Brian Thompson’s tenure, according to Fortune. According to personal finance platform ValuePenguin, UnitedHealthcare denies 32% of claims compared with the industry average of 16 percent. Bullet casings found at the scene of the killing had the words: deny, defend, and depose written on them, echoing a phrase commonly used to describe insurer tactics to avoid paying claims. Thompson, 50, was killed Dec. 4 outside of a NYC hotel where United Healthcare was planning to hold its annual conference. In the days after the killing, support has grown in some quarters online for the attention the killing raised about perceptions that insurance companies place shareholder profits and executive suite pay above their customers’ medical needs and lives. Many online are expressing support for the killer, as if he were some kind of folk hero, while others found the jokes and expressions of support for a premeditated murder despicable. Thompson left behind a wife and two sons. The motive in the killing remains unknown. Luigi Mangione, 26, a University of Pennsylvania grad who was arrested while eating at the McDonald’s in Altoona, has a court hearing scheduled for 6 p.m. in Blair County on a gun charge. Police say he had a ghost gun, or one made with a 3D printer, on him when they arrested him. It’s unclear if the employee who called eventually will get a $50,000 reward that was being offered by the FBI for information in connection with Thompson’s killing. “The fries were sad and cold, like that snitches heart,” another review said. “Pretty depressing atmosphere too. Feels likes someone might rat out on you.” Another reviewer posted: “Never eating at this McDonald’s again. Imagine going to grab a Big Mac and witnessing Officer Snitchy McSnitch (Employee of the Month) calling the feds on a HERO. Dude was just trying to enjoy his McNuggets after literally uniting Americans, and this cashier speedran dialing 911 faster than he’s ever assembled a McFlurry.” The bad online reviews for the McDonald’s franchises in Altoona followed a similar reaction against the Upper West Side hostel where officials believe the suspected killer stayed during his time in New York City, according to the New York Times. Some people called the workers there “narcs.” The business has been cooperating with the police. It is unclear what motivated the killing or whether it was tied to Thompson’s work in the industry. Mangione’s social media page on X, formerly Twitter, includes a photo of a man’s x-ray showing four large screws inserted into the spine, similar to a spinal fusion surgery to address back pain. An list of books read by Mangione posted on the website Good Reads included five related to back pain.

                "content": "Eric Marlon Bishop (born December 13, 1967),[2][3][4] known professionally as Jamie Foxx, is an American actor, comedian, and singer. He gained his career breakthrough as a featured player in the sketch comedy show In Living Color from 1991 to 1994. Following this success, he was given his own sitcom, The Jamie Foxx Show, in which he starred, co-created and produced from 1996 to 2001. Foxx received acclaim for his portrayal of Ray Charles in the film Ray (2004), winning the Academy Award for Best Actor. That same year, he was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor for his role in the crime film Collateral. He gained further prominence for his film roles in Ali (2001), Jarhead (2005), Dreamgirls (2006), Miami Vice (2006), Horrible Bosses (2011), Django Unchained (2012), Annie (2014), Baby Driver (2017), and Soul (2020). He also played Electro in The Amazing Spider-Man 2 (2014) and Spider-Man: No Way Home (2021) and Walter McMillian in Just Mercy (2019). Foxx also embarked on a successful career as an R&B singer in the 2000s. He earned two number-one singles on the Billboard Hot 100, with his features on the singles \"Slow Jamz\" by Twista alongside Kanye West, and \"Gold Digger\" by the former. His single \"Blame It\" won him the Grammy Award for Best R&B Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocals. Four of his five studio albums have charted in the top ten of the U.S. Billboard 200: Unpredictable (2005), which topped the chart, Intuition (2008), Best Night of My Life (2010), and Hollywood: A Story of a Dozen Roses (2015). Since 2017, Foxx has served as the host and executive producer of the Fox game show Beat Shazam. In 2021, he wrote his autobiography Act Like You Got Some Sense. Born in Terrell, Texas,[5] Foxx is the son of Darrell Bishop (renamed Shahid Abdula following his conversion to Islam),[6] who sometimes worked as a stockbroker, and Louise Annette Talley Dixon. Shortly after his birth, Foxx was adopted and raised by his mother's adoptive parents, Esther[7] Marie (née Nelson), a domestic worker and nursery operator, and Mark Talley, a yard worker.[8][9] He has had little contact with his birth parents, who were not part of his upbringing.[10] He was raised in the black quarter of Terrell, which at the time was a racially segregated community.[10] He has often acknowledged his grandmother's influence as one of the greatest reasons for his success.[8][11] Foxx began playing the piano when he was five years old.[12] He had a strict Baptist upbringing[8][13] and as a teenager was a part-time pianist and choir leader in Terrell's New Hope Baptist Church.[10] His natural talent for telling jokes was already in evidence as a third grader, when his teacher used him as a reward: if the class behaved well, Foxx would tell them jokes. He attended Terrell High School, where he received top grades and played basketball and football (as quarterback). His ambition was to play for the Dallas Cowboys, and he was the first player in the school's history to pass for more than 1,000 yards.[10][14] He also sang in a band called Leather and Lace.[10] After high school, Foxx received a scholarship to United States International University, where he studied musical and performing arts composition.[10][15] Foxx first told jokes at a comedy club's open mic night in 1989, after accepting a girlfriend's dare. When he found that female comedians were often called first to perform, he chose the stage name of Jamie Foxx, which he felt was ambiguous enough to disallow any biases,[10][16] with his surname being a tribute to the black comedian Redd Foxx.[16] Foxx joined the cast of In Living Color in 1991, where his recurrent character Wanda also shared a name with Redd's friend and co-worker, LaWanda Page. Following a recurring role in the comedy-drama sitcom Roc,[17] Foxx went on to star in his own sitcom The Jamie Foxx Show, from 1996 to 2001, which he also co-created and produced through his company Foxx Hole Productions and was aired on the WB network. Foxx made his film debut in the 1992 comedy Toys. His first dramatic role came in Oliver Stone's 1999 film Any Given Sunday, where he was cast as a hard-partying quarterback,[8] partly because of his own football background.[8] During filming, Foxx fought with costar LL Cool J.[18][19] In 2001, Foxx starred opposite Will Smith in Michael Mann's biographical drama Ali. Three years later, Foxx played taxi driver Max Durocher in the Mann film Collateral alongside Tom Cruise, for which he received outstanding reviews. Critic Roger Ebert praised Foxx's performance, stating that, \"Jamie Foxx's work is a revelation. I've thought of him in terms of comedy (\"Booty Call,\" \"Breakin' all the Rules\"), but here he steps into a dramatic lead and is always convincing and involving\".[20] He went on to receive a nomination for the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor for his performance.[8] In 1994, Foxx released an album (on the Fox record label) entitled Peep This, which was not commercially successful. In 2003, Foxx made a cameo in Benzino's music video for \"Would You\", which features LisaRaye McCoy and Mario Winans. In 2003, Foxx featured on the rapper Twista's song, \"Slow Jamz\", together with Kanye West, which reached No. 1 on the U.S. Billboard Hot 100 singles chart and #3 on the UK Singles chart. His second collaboration with Kanye West, \"Gold Digger,\" in which Foxx sang the Ray Charles-influenced \"I Got a Woman\" hook, then went straight to No. 1 on the Billboard Hot 100, remaining there for 10 weeks. In 2005, Foxx featured on the single \"Georgia\" by Atlanta rappers Ludacris and Field Mob, which sampled Ray Charles' hit \"Georgia on My Mind\". Foxx would also portray Ray Charles in the biographical film Ray (2004), for which he won the Academy Award for Best Actor[8] and the BAFTA Award for Best Actor in a Leading Role. Foxx is the third male in history (after Barry Fitzgerald and Al Pacino) to receive two acting Oscar nominations in the same year for two different movies, Collateral and Ray. In 2005, Foxx was invited to join the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences.[21] Foxx released his second studio album, Unpredictable, in December 2005. It debuted at No. 2, selling 598,000 copies in its first week,[22] rising to No. 1 the following week and selling an additional 200,000 copies.[23] To date, the album has sold 1.98 million copies in the United States, and was certified double Platinum by the RIAA.[24][25] The album also charted on the UK Albums Chart, where it peaked at No. 9.[26] Foxx became the fourth artist to have both won an Academy Award for an acting role and to have achieved a No. 1 album in the U.S, joining Frank Sinatra, Bing Crosby and Barbra Streisand. Foxx's first single from the album, the title track \"Unpredictable\" (featuring Ludacris), peaked in the Billboard Hot 100 Top 10 singles and also made the UK Top 20 singles chart; the track samples \"Wildflower\" by New Birth. The second U.S. single from the album was \"DJ Play a Love Song,\" which reunited Foxx with Twista. In the UK, the second single was \"Extravaganza\", which saw Foxx once again collaborate with Kanye West, although Foxx did not feature in the song's music video. At the 2006 BET Awards, Foxx won Best Duet/Collaboration with Kanye West for \"Gold Digger\" and tied with Mary J. Blige's \"Be Without You\" for Video of the Year. On December 8, 2006, Foxx received four Grammy Award nominations, which included Best R&B Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocals for Love Changes featuring Mary J. Blige, Best R&B Album for Unpredictable, Best Rap Performance by a Duo or Group for Georgia by Ludacris & Field Mob featuring Jamie Foxx, and Best Rap/Sung Collaboration for Unpredictable featuring Ludacris. Following on from these successes, Foxx went on to appear in the box-office hits Jarhead, Miami Vice, and Dreamgirls, which lifted his profile even higher as a bankable star in Hollywood. 2007 brought him the lead role in the action thriller film The Kingdom opposite Chris Cooper, Jason Bateman, Jennifer Garner and Ashraf Barhom. In September 2007, Foxx was awarded a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame: \"[it was] one of the most amazing days of my life,\" said Foxx.[27] In April 2009, Foxx played the lead role in the dramatic film The Soloist. A few months later in October 2009, he played a starring role alongside Gerard Butler in the thriller Law Abiding Citizen. In 2007, his company FoxxKing Entertainment signed deals with MTV and VH1.[28] Foxx released his third album titled Intuition in 2008, featuring Kanye West, T.I., Ne-Yo, Lil' Kim and T-Pain. The album's first single, \"Just Like Me\" featuring T.I., was promoted by a video directed by Brett Ratner which featured an appearance by actress Taraji P. Henson. The second single \"Blame It\" featured T-Pain and became a top 5 single on the Billboard Hot 100 and a number-one single on the Billboard Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs chart. The song received many accolades for Foxx, including a Grammy Award for Best R&B Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocals at the 52nd Annual Grammy Awards. The \"Blame It\" music video, directed by Hype Williams, features cameo appearances by Forest Whitaker, Samuel L. Jackson, Ron Howard, Quincy Jones and his Jarhead co-star Jake Gyllenhaal, amongst others. Foxx's musical career has also included a number of collaborations. In 2007, he recorded the song \"She Goes All the Way\" with country superstars Rascal Flatts for their Still Feels Good album. Foxx performed backing vocals for artist/songwriter Tank. He featured alongside The-Dream on Plies' \"Please Excuse My Hands.\" He also appeared alongside Fabolous on the remix of Ne-Yo's \"Miss Independent\". Foxx collaborated with rapper The Game on the track \"Around the World\". Foxx also featured on T.I.'s single \"Live in the Sky\" from the album King. On January 22, 2007, Foxx launched The Foxxhole, a channel on Sirius Satellite Radio featuring talk-radio programs, stand-up comedy albums and music primarily by African-American performers, as well as much of Foxx's own material. Foxx's own talk-radio variety program The Jamie Foxx Show airs Friday evenings on The Foxxhole with guests including musicians, actors and fellow comedians; co-hosts have included Johnny Mack, Speedy, Claudia Jordan, The Poetess, Lewis Dix, Yvette Wilson, T.D.P and Tyrin Turner. On the April 17, 2009, episode of The Jamie Foxx Show, Foxx and his co-hosts made several sexually suggestive and disparaging jokes regarding the teenage singer Miley Cyrus.[29] Several days later Foxx issued a public apology on The Tonight Show with Jay Leno in response to growing public outcry and televised criticism by Cyrus's father, country singer Billy Ray Cyrus.[30] On April 6, 2009, Foxx, a longtime fan of country music, performed the George Strait song \"You Look So Good in Love\" at the George Strait Artist of the Decade All-Star Concert. Jamie Foxx hosted the 2009 BET Awards ceremony on June 28, 2009, which featured several tributes to pop star Michael Jackson, who had died three days prior to the show. As well as performing \"Blame It\" with T-Pain and \"She Got Her Own\" with Ne-Yo and Fabolous, Foxx opened the show with a rendition of Jackson's \"Beat It\" dance routine and closed the show with a cover of the Jackson 5's \"I'll Be There\" with Ne-Yo. \"We want to celebrate this black man. He belongs to us and we shared him with everybody else.\", said Foxx during the ceremony. In April 2011, Foxx voiced the cartoon canary Nico in the movie Rio. During the summer of 2011, Foxx was involved as a producer of In the Flow with Affion Crockett on Fox.[31] Foxx released his fourth album, Best Night of My Life, on December 21, 2010,[32] featuring the singles \"Winner\" (featuring Justin Timberlake and T.I.), \"Living Better Now\" (featuring rapper Rick Ross) and \"Fall for Your Type\" (featuring rapper Drake).[32] On October 7, the RCA Music Group announced that it was disbanding J Records along with Arista Records and Jive Records, meaning that all artists (including Foxx) previously signed to the three labels will release their future material on the RCA Records brand.[33][34] In 2011, Jamie Foxx also featured on the rapper Pitbull's album Planet Pit, in the song \"Where Do We Go\". In 2012, Foxx starred in the title role of the Quentin Tarantino written and directed Django Unchained.[35] Foxx starred alongside his Ray co-star Kerry Washington, as well as Christoph Waltz, Leonardo DiCaprio and Samuel L. Jackson. In an interview about Django Unchained, Foxx told Vibe magazine: \"As a black person it's always racial. ... when I get home my other homies are like how was your day? Well, I only had to be white for at least eight hours today, [or] I only had to be white for four hours.\"[36] The filming was emotional as Foxx said, \"It's tough shooting when you're in plantation row and that's where your ancestors were persecuted and killed.\"[37] On November 25, 2012, at BET's Soul Train Awards, Foxx joked: \"It's like church in here. First of all, giving honor to God and our lord and savior Barack Obama.\"[38] The joke led to condemnation from some Christians, to which Foxx responded: \"I'm a comic [and] sometimes I think people get a little too tight.\"[39] While hosting Saturday Night Live on December 8, 2012, to promote Django Unchained, Foxx joked about being excited \"to kill all the white people in the movie\".[40] Appearing at the 2013 NAACP Image Awards, Foxx praised the achievements of black people, saying that \"black people are the most talented people in the world\".[41] In 2013, Foxx was cast as President James Sawyer in White House Down alongside Channing Tatum.[42] The following year, Foxx appeared in The Amazing Spider-Man 2 as the villain Electro, and co-starred with Quvenzhané Wallis in Annie, Sony's Will Smith and Jay-Z produced update of the comic strip-turned-musical.[43] In 2017, Foxx starred as Bats, a trigger-happy gang member, in Edgar Wright's action film Baby Driver. Foxx's October 2014 Deja Vu duet with Dionne Warwick appears on the Feels So Good album released by Warwick. He released his fifth studio album, Hollywood: A Story of a Dozen Roses, on May 18, 2015. It debuted atop the Top R&B/Hip-Hop Albums charts and at No. 10 on the Billboard 200.[44] In 2015, Foxx's voice was featured in the chorus on the Ariana Grande song, \"Focus\".[45] Since its debut in 2017, Foxx has been the host and executive producer of the Fox game show Beat Shazam, whose premise is similar to the once-popular game show format Name That Tune. On the show, three sets of two partners try to beat the software application Shazam in correctly identifying the titles of popular songs for increasingly higher amounts of money, with one team eventually vying for a potential prize of $1 million. Foxx's daughter Corinne began co-hosting the show in its second season in 2018, replacing DJ October Gonzalez.[46] The show has aired four seasons so far.[47] Foxx co-executive produced the 2017 Showtime sitcom White Famous, which starred Jay Pharoah as a young aspiring African-American comic, and was based on Foxx's own early career. Foxx also occasionally appeared on the show as himself. White Famous got middling reviews and ratings, and was cancelled after one season.[48] On May 22, 2019, Foxx appeared as George Jefferson in Live in Front of a Studio Audience: Norman Lear's All in the Family and The Jeffersons on ABC.[49] That year, he played wrongly convicted death row prisoner Walter McMillian in the drama film Just Mercy, for which he received significant critical acclaim.[50] Foxx starred in Project Power, directed by Ariel Schulman and Henry Joost, opposite Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Dominique Fishback, which was released on August 14, 2020, by Netflix.[51][52] That September, Foxx signed an overall deal with Sony Pictures Entertainment.[53] Foxx then voiced the main character, jazz pianist and music teacher Joe Gardner, in the Pixar animated film Soul (2020).[54] Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, Soul was released direct-to-streaming on Disney+ in most countries, including the United States,[55] though it did get a theatrical release in some countries.[56][57] USA Today's Brian Truitt commended Foxx's performance, saying he brought \"warmth, humor and an occasional touch of exasperation\" to the role.[58] Foxx co-created, executive produced and starred in the 2021 Netflix sitcom Dad Stop Embarrassing Me!, in which he played the single father of two teenage girls. The series marked Foxx's return to the sitcom format after The Jamie Foxx Show ended in 2001.[59] The entire eight-episode series premiered April 14, 2021, on Netflix. It was cancelled after one season.[60] He reprised his role as Electro in Spider-Man: No Way Home (2021), set in the Marvel Cinematic Universe.[61] In 2021, Foxx released the memoir Act Like You Got Some Sense: And Other Things My Daughters Taught Me, which focused on his family life, both as a child and as an adult.[62] On May 29, 2018, Foxx was cast as Al Simmons in King Spawn, to be directed by Todd McFarlane.[63] In 2015, Foxx became attached to portray former boxer Mike Tyson in a biographical drama film Finding Mike; in 2020, he began to exercise in order to gain muscle for the role.[64] In 2021, the project turned into a miniseries, to be directed by Antoine Fuqua.[65] Foxx has two daughters: model, actress, and television producer Corinne Foxx, born in 1994;[10] and another daughter born in 2009.[66] Corinne made her formal debut at the Bal des débutantes in November 2014 and was named Miss Golden Globe 2016 on November 18, 2015.[67] In 2008, Foxx filmed a public service announcement for Do Something to promote food drives in local communities.[68] From 2013 to 2019, Foxx was rumored to be in a relationship with actress Katie Holmes.[69][70] On January 18, 2016, he rescued a young man from a burning vehicle that crashed outside his home. The driver, Brett Kyle, was driving his truck \"at a high rate of speed\" when it left the road, traveled into a drainage ditch, and rolled over several times. Kyle was arrested for driving under the influence of alcohol.[71][72] On October 26, 2020, Foxx announced that his sister Deondra Dixon had died. She was 36 years old and had been born with Down syndrome. She had been an ambassador for the Global Down Syndrome Foundation.[73] On April 12, 2023, his daughter Corinne announced that he had been hospitalized after an unspecified medical emergency, but was recovering.[74][75] On May 12, amid conflicting reports about the nature of his condition, including rumors that he was gravely ill, Corinne said that her father had been \"out of the hospital for weeks, recuperating\".[76] He was reportedly treated in a \"physical rehab facility in Chicago\" that specializes in \"strokes and brain injuries\".[77] On July 22, Foxx posted a video clip commenting about his health, saying that he had been to \"hell and back\".[78][79][80] On December 3, 2023, he made his first public appearance since the hospitalization, to accept a Critics Choice Association's Vanguard Award. In his speech, he disclosed that he couldn't walk at first and discussed his recovery, without detailing exactly what led to his hospitalization.[81] Despite the news of his health challenges, he walked his daughter Corinne down the aisle in September 21, 2024 at his home in Thousand Oaks, California.[82][83] On December 10, 2024, Foxx revealed that he had a stroke that led to his hospitalization in April 2023 in his Netflix comedy special, Jamie Foxx: What Had Happened Was....[84] In April 2003, Foxx and his sister Deondra Dixon were confronted by security guards and had a physical struggle with police officers who arrested them at Harrah's casino in New Orleans. Employees said the Foxx party failed to show identification upon entry and \"started yelling profanities\" and fought with police officers after being told to leave.[85] Foxx's sister was subdued by pepper spray after breaking free while being handcuffed and then using the handcuffs to strike out at the police officers.[85] Two police officers were injured in the incident.[85] Originally charged with trespassing, disturbing the peace, battery on police officers, and resisting arrest, Foxx pleaded no contest to disturbing the peace in exchange for the other charges being dropped and was sentenced to a six-month suspended jail term with two years of probation and a $1,500 fine.[85][86] In November 2023, Foxx was sued by a woman who accused him of sexually assaulting her in 2015.[87][88] Fox has denied the alleged wrongdoing.[89] Foxx, Jamie, with Nick Chiles (2021).

                "title": "Luigi Mangione: Who is the suspect in the shooting of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson?",
                "content": "A profile is emerging of the 26-year-old man charged with murder over last week's fatal shooting of UnitedHealthcare's chief executive, Brian Thompson, in New York City. Police announced on Monday they had arrested Luigi Mangione after he was recognised at a McDonald's in Altoona, Pennsylvania. The Baltimore, Maryland, native was found in possession of a so-called ghost gun, a largely untraceable firearm, and a three-page handwritten document that indicated \"motivation and mindset\", officials said. Mr Mangione was born and raised in Maryland and has ties to San Francisco, California, according to New York Chief of Detectives Joseph Kenny. He has no prior arrests in New York and his last previous address was in Honolulu, Hawaii, police said. He is from a prominent Baltimore family, and attended a private, all-boys high school in Baltimore, called the Gilman School, according to school officials. Mr Mangione was named as the valedictorian, which is usually the student with the highest academic achievements in a class. In a statement, the school called the situation \"deeply distressing\". A former classmate, Freddie Leatherbury, told the Associated Press news agency that Mr Mangione came from a wealthy family, even by that private school's standards. \"Quite honestly, he had everything going for him,\" Mr Leatherbury said. Speaking to the BBC's US partner, CBS News, another classmate described themselves anonymously as a close friend of Mr Mangione - saying the shooting suspect \"didn't have any enemies\" and was a \"valedictorian for a reason\". Mr Mangione went on to graduate from the University of Pennsylvania, where he received a bachelor's and master's degree in computer science, according to the school, and founded a video game development club. A friend who attended the Ivy League college at the same time as Mr Mangione described him as a \"super normal\" and \"smart person\". Mr Mangione was employed as a data engineer for TrueCar, a digital retailing website for new and used cars, according to his social media profiles. A company spokesman told the BBC he had not worked there since 2023. According to his LinkedIn profile, Mr Mangione previously worked as a programming intern for Firaxis, a video game developer. He also spent time in a co-living surfing community in Hawaii called Surfbreak. Sarah Nehemiah, who knew him then, told CBS he left due to his back injury which had worsened from surfing and hiking. The three-page, handwritten document found on him suggested a motive, according to investigators. The pages expressed \"ill will\" towards corporate America, they said. A senior law enforcement official told the New York Times it said: \"These parasites had it coming\" and \"I do apologise for any strife and trauma, but it had to be done\". Investigators say the words \"deny\", \"defend\" and \"depose\" were written on shell casings found at the scene of Mr Thompson's murder. Critics of healthcare insurers call these the \"three Ds of insurance\" - tactics used by companies to reject payment claims by patients. Friends have told US media he had surgery on his back. The background image on an X account believed to belong to Mangione shows an x-ray of a spine with hardware in it. However, it is unclear how much his own experience of the healthcare system shaped his views. A person matching his name and photo had an account on Goodreads, a user-generated book review site, where he read two books about back pain in 2022, one of them called Crooked: Outwitting the Back Pain Industry. He also gave four stars to a text called Industrial Society and Its Future by Theodore Kaczynski – also known as the Unabomber manifesto. Starting in 1978, Kaczynski carried out a bombing campaign that killed three people and injured dozens of others, until he was arrested in 1996. In his review, Mr Mangione acknowledged Kaczynski was a violent individual who killed innocent people but the book should not be dismissed as the manifesto of a lunatic, rather the work of an extreme political revolutionary. His social media profiles also suggest that he had fallen out of touch with family and friends in recent months. In a post on X from October, someone tagged an account believed to be Mr Mangione's and wrote: \"Hey, are you ok? Nobody has heard from you in months, and apparently your family is looking for you.\" Mr Mangione comes from a prominent family in the Baltimore area who are known for businesses including country clubs, nursing homes and a radio station according to local media. The suspect's paternal grandparents, Nicholas and Mary Mangione, were real estate developers who purchased the Turf Valley Country Club in 1978 and Hayfields Country Club in Hunt Valley in 1986. Shortly after the suspect was charged, Republican state lawmaker Nino Mangione - believed to be Mr Mangione's cousin - released a statement saying the family was \"shocked and devastated\". \"We offer our prayers to the family of Brian Thompson and we ask people to pray for all involved\", the statement read, signing off as \"The Mangione Family\". A customer at the fast-food outlet thought his friends were kidding when they pointed out the likeness between a patron and the shooting suspect. The Franklin brush fire has burned hundreds of acres in an upmarket area of the US state of California. The blaze has burned more than 300 acres with a \"rapid rate of spread\", say authorities. The 26-year-old was taken into custody at a McDonald's in Pennsylvania, in connection to the killing of United Health CEO Brian Thompson. The court says Murdoch acted in \"bad faith\" by trying to give control of his empire to his eldest son. Copyright 2024 BBC. All rights reserved.

End of story.” On Etsy, WIRED found almost 100 listings featuring products with Mangione’s name or image. These include a tote bag featuring pictures of the alleged shooter alongside the phrase “Mama, I’m in love with a criminal” and PDF copies of a mocked-up cover of Time magazine featuring Mangione as Person of the Year and the tagline “Healthcare revolutionary, leading the charge to transform global health.” These sellers are trying to cash in on the internet’s peculiar fascination with Mangione, whose good looks and privileged background have garnered him fans despite him being accused of a high-profile murder in broad daylight. The fascination with Mangione is a worrying trend, researchers say, that shows behavior that used to be confined to the fringes of the internet becoming mainstream. Much of the merchandise is being sold by print-on-demand websites, which allow anyone to design and sell a range of products. On one such site, called My Porch Prints, one seller is offering a mug featuring a heart-shaped image of a topless Mangione alongside the words “I love my boyfriend.” A number of print-on-demand merchants are selling a stylized version of the Luigi character from Nintendo's Mario video games holding a gun and wearing a green hoodie. Another hoodie available on multiple online stores, including one called Chill Guy, features an image of Mangione surrounded by love hearts. There are also multiple different T-shirts and hoodies being sold on sites like Nobele T-Shirt, featuring designs with the phrase “Free Luigi” on them, while many others use the phrase “Deny, Defend, Depose,” the words Mangione allegedly inscribed on some ammunition. Finally, a T-shirt featuring the McDonald’s logo with the word Mangione superimposed on it is also being sold online by custom gift shop ModParty, referring to the fact Mangione was captured after staff at the fast food restaurant in Altoona, Pennsylvania, identified him and called the police. Etsy, My Porch Prints, Chill Guy, Noble T-Shirts, and ModParty did not immediately respond to requests for comment. This unusual situation meant that as internet sleuths worked to discover as much information about Mangione as possible, platforms such as YouTube and Instagram were working to shut down his accounts. X initially shut down Maglione’s account, but after CEO Elon Musk said he was \"looking into it\" the account was restored. Google was also forced to remove reviews of the McDonald’s where Mangione was identified on Monday, after Mangione supporters review-bombed it with negative comments and one-star reviews. Before his identity was revealed on Monday, his online supporters, primarily on TikTok, Bluesky, and X, had created an entire fictionalized version of the shooter as a left-wing revolutionary hero who was standing up for the millions of Americans whose lives have been impacted negatively by interactions with the health care system. Videos glorifying the killer flooded TikTok, while one person decided to get a tattoo of the alleged shooter’s face. In Washington Square Park in New York City, a look-alike competition was held on Saturday. Indeed, “Deny, Defend, Depose,” which is widely viewed as a pointed critique of the health insurance industry in America, has become a rallying cry online in recent days as the focus moved away from the shooting itself and onto the shooter and his motives. However, the fictionalized version of the shooter that was created online does not match reality. Mangione, who allegedly had a handwritten manifesto admitting to the killing in his possession when arrested, is a software engineer from a privileged background. He also follows popular right-wing influencers, such as Tucker Carlson, Joe Rogan, and Jordan Peterson—though he has also criticized some of the arguments put forward by these figures. During a brief court appearance on Monday night, the police did not outline a motive for the shooting, but based on Mangione’s online posts and reading lists, it appears that the pain from an injury suffered while surfing could have played a significant part in his motivation. Despite Mangione not fitting the idealized hero that many online created in the time between the shooting and his arrest, the alleged shooter’s fans have continued to post fan fiction about him. On Archive of Our Own, a repository of fan fiction, half a dozen pieces of prose about Mangione were posted in the hours after he was identified. In one piece entitled “McGuire Road Designated Dispersed Campsite,” an author with the username basedIdiot imagines Mangione and another man on a road trip trying to escape from New York. “‘Oh, am I not your beloved?’ Luigi Mangione mockingly fainted into the other man’s arms,” the author wrote. In another, an anonymous author imagines Mangione in Texas where he is planning to assassinate Tesla, SpaceX, and X CEO Elon Musk, inscribing the bullets he was going to use to kill the billionaire. “For Musk, he’s kept it simple. X. X. And lastly, X. Mocking goodbye kisses,” the author wrote. “But also a reference to one spoilt, psychotic rich brat’s latest 44-billion-dollar toy to break.” Another imagines the suspect as the author’s lover while at the University of Pennsylvania, where Mangione studied engineering. “Luigi Mangione turns to you,” writes an author with the username Princesscockdestroyer, who claims she’s writing this fan fiction during her final exams. “He mouths ‘I love you’ then takes off down the street. As you watch him disappear from you, from your life, from any promise of a future together, you can’t help but finally realize that you love him too.” One of the posts imagines Mangione hooking up with a K-pop star in a motel in Ohio while on the run. On TikTok, videos with images of Mangione’s smiling face, featuring the Britney Spears song “Criminal,” are also racking up tens of thousands of views, while hundreds of videos with the hashtag TeamLuigi have been posted on TikTok in the hours after Mangione was arrested. A report published last week by the Network Contagion Research Institute called the phenomenon of online accounts glorifying the shooter as a “cause for concern,” pointing out that it mimics the type of response typically seen on fringe platforms like 4chan and 8chan in the wake of mass shootings. “While this phenomenon was once largely confined to niche online subcultures, we are now witnessing similar dynamics emerging on mainstream platforms, amplifying the risk of further escalation,” the report’s authors wrote.

                "content": "• Luigi Mangione, the suspect in the killing of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson, has been charged with murder in New York and is facing four other charges including one count of forging a document and criminally possessing a firearm, online court documents show. • Mangione was arrested on a gun charge after being picked up while eating at a McDonald’s in Altoona, Pennsylvania, following an employee calling the cops, the NYPD chief of detectives said. The 26-year-old had multiple fake IDs and a 3D-printed gun with a suppressor, according to officials. • Altoona police said when officers asked Mangione if he had been to New York recently, he “became visibly nervous” and started “kind of shaking.” Authorities said the suspect has been in the state for “several days.” • Mangione was ordered held without bail and did not enter a plea in his first court appearance today in Hollidaysburg, Pennsylvania. Our live coverage has moved. Follow today’s live updates on the arrest of Luigi Mangione, the suspect in the killing of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson and read through Monday’s posts below. Luigi Mangione has been charged with one count of second-degree murder, two counts of second-degree criminal possession of a weapon, one count of second-degree possession of a forged document, and one count of third-degree criminal possession of a weapon, online court documents show. CNN is working to identify Mangione’s legal representative. Luigi Mangione, the 26-year-old who has been named the suspect in the killing of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson, was criminally cited last year by the Hawaii Department of Land and Natural Resources for going into an area that was closed inside a state park. According to the criminal affidavit, Mangione was cited on November 12, 2023, in Honolulu for “knowingly, intentionally, or recklessly, fail to observe and abide by an officially posted sign authorized by the board or its authorized representative designating a closed area, to wit, a State Parks sign located at the Nuuanu Pali Lookout.” In court records, Mangione was found guilty and had to pay a $100 fine. The family of suspected shooter Luigi Mangione released a statement Monday night through his cousin, who is a Maryland state delegate. “Our family is shocked and devastated by Luigi’s arrest,” Nino Mangione said in a written statement signed with The Mangione Family. “We offer prayers to the family of Brian Thompson and we ask people to pray for all involved.” The statement says the family only knows the facts of the case that have been released in the news. “We are devastated by this news,” the short statement says. The Pennsylvania Department of Corrections has released an intake photo of Luigi Mangione, the suspect in the killing of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson. Mangione, a 26-year-old Ivy League graduate from Maryland, was apprehended at a McDonald’s in Altoona, Pennsylvania – after an employee tipped off police that he resembled photos of the suspect widely distributed by New York City police. He did not enter a plea at his first court appearance Monday evening, which took place just hours after his arrest. Police in Altoona, Pennsylvania, released this photo tonight of Luigi Mangione, the suspect in the killing of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson, in a holding cell after he was taken into custody on Monday. After a court appearance, Mangione was moved to the State Correctional Institution in Huntingdon, Pennsylvania. The suspected gunman appeared to make a reference to UnitedHealthcare writing that “United” is one of the largest companies by market capitalization in the United States, according to a law enforcement source who has read the document. There is no mention of Thompson specifically. Luigi Mangione, the suspect in the killing of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson, has arrived at the State Correctional Institution (SCI) in Huntingdon, Pennsylvania, Maria Bivens, Pennsylvania Department of Corrections press secretary, told CNN Monday evening. “SCI Huntingdon is Pennsylvania’s oldest State Correctional Institution in continuous operation, opening its gates in 1889,” the state’s official website says. Much of the evidence officials obtained when they searched Luigi Mangione on Monday, including the multiple fake IDs, will be sent to New York when the suspect is transported back there, a law enforcement official told CNN, although it’s unclear when the gun found in Mangione’s backpack will be sent to New York. Investigators will be executing search warrants on all of Mangione’s known home addresses and will look to collect electronic devices and anything else that could be evidence or point to motive, the law enforcement official said. The idea that Luigi Mangione is the suspect in the in the killing of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson, is “unfathomable,” his former roommate R.J. Martin told CNN’s Erin Burnett Monday night. Martin said he’s “beyond shocked” by the news. Martin said the two — who lived together in a co-living and co-working community in Hawaii — weren’t just roommates, they were friends. “He was a very thoughtful person. Communicated really well, was friendly, had good relationships with everyone. He was even, in some ways, a bit of a leader,” Martin said. Martin said he interviewed Mangione before Mangione moved in to make sure he was a good fit. During the interview, Mangione told Martin he had a back issue. “When I first interviewed him, before he moved in, I remember he said he had a back issue, and he was hoping to get stronger in Hawaii,” Martin said. Martin said Mangione took a basic surf lesson that ended up leaving him in bed for about and week and that “it was really traumatic and difficult.” Martin also said Mangione had surgery earlier this year that left him with screws in his body. “He sent me the X-rays,” Martin said. “It looked heinous, with just giant screws going into his spine. After that, he called me once, I didn’t pick up.” The communication between the two kind of fizzled out after that. Martin said Mangione “never once talked about guns, never once talked about violence.” “He was absolutely a not violent person, as far as I could tell,” Martin said. Meta on Monday removed the Facebook account and Instagram account belonging to the suspected gunman in the fatal shooting of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson, a company spokesperson confirmed to CNN. When talking to Luigi Mangione at McDonald’s on Monday morning, Altoona police officers suspected he was the man sought in connection with the killing of Brian Thompson. According to Altoona Deputy Chief of Police Derek Swope, they asked Mangione whether he had been to New York recently. “And that really invoked a physical reaction from the suspect. He became visibly nervous, kind of shaking at that question. And he didn’t really answer it directly,” Swope said during a news conference. Altoona Deputy Police Chief Derek Swope The suspect in the killing of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson has been in Pennsylvania for “several days” after the shooting in Manhattan, according to Lt. Col. George Bivens of the Pennsylvania State Police. Bivens said at a news conference on Monday that law enforcement officials are working to piece together where the suspect went. He added that as police sort through all of the evidence, he is “confident we’ll have a much better idea of his activities over the past, you know, number of days in New York and in Pennsylvania.” Some of this evidence includes electronic devices that “are in the process of being downloaded.” There are also other items the suspect had with him when he was arrested in Altoona earlier Monday. “So part of that investigation will also focus on trying to retrace his steps,” Bivens said. “We’ve already identified businesses, for example, that he frequented in this area and activities that he engaged in — that led us to more evidence, and so all of that is becoming kind of a mountain of evidence that has to be analyzed and and looked at.” Some more context: Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro said earlier in the news conference the suspect traveled between Philadelphia and Pittsburgh, making stops in between, including in Altoona where he was arrested. New York police also said previously they believed the suspect left New York City on an interstate bus after the shooting, after video cameras captured him entering the George Washington Bridge Bus Station on 178th Street but not leaving. YouTube on Monday removed three channels belonging to Luigi Mangione, the suspect in the killing of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson, as well as a channel that was altered Monday to look as if it belonged to him, Jack Malon, Google policy communications manager, confirmed to CNN. Mangione’s own YouTube channels — which Malon said had not posted any content for seven months — were removed under the platform’s creator responsibility guidelines. The other channel was removed for violating YouTube’s impersonation policies, after the channel name and handle were updated on Monday following news of Mangione’s arrest to appear as if it belonged to the suspect. That channel on Monday posted a cryptic countdown video that said, “If you see this, I’m already under arrest.” Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro said Luigi Mangione, the suspect in the killing of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson, “is no hero.” “In America, we do not kill people in cold blood to resolve policy differences or express a viewpoint,” Shapiro said during a news conference Monday night following Mangione’s court appearance. “He is no hero,” Shapiro said. “The real hero in this story is the person who called 911 at McDonald’s this morning,” he added. Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro said the suspect in the shooting of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson traveled between Philadelphia and Pittsburgh, making stops in between, including in in Altoona where he was arrested Monday. Speaking at a news conference, the governor also called on residents to continue to call in tips to police. The suspect was arrested after an employee at an Altoona McDonalds recognized him and called authorities. Shapiro said that person acted like “a hero.” “I want to ask all of our fellow Pennsylvanians to demonstrate the same type of thoughtfulness and courage and smarts as the individual at McDonald’s did this morning and help law enforcement here in Pennsylvania as we continue with our investigation,” Shapiro said. He thanked the local officers who responded quickly and calmly, adding that he also received a briefing from New York City Police Commissioner Jessica Tisch and New York City Mayor Eric Adams earlier today. When two police officers arrived at the McDonald’s in Altoona, Pennsylvania, where Luigi Mangione was eventually arrested, they found a man “wearing a medical mask and a beanie” and sitting “in the rear of the building at a table,” looking at a laptop, according to a criminal complaint. Officers asked him to pull down the mask to see his face — and “immediately recognized him as the suspect,” the complaint says. The officers asked the man for identification, and he gave them a New Jersey ID with the name Mark Rosario. When they asked him if he had been to New York City recently, he “became quiet and started to shake,” the complaint says. Police were unable to find any records that matched the ID given and told the man he was under an official police investigation. He then told officers his real name: Luigi Mangione. When an officer asked why he used a false name, he replied “I clearly shouldn’t have,” according to the complaint. Luigi Mangione, the man who police have identified as the suspect in the fatal shooting of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson, made his first appearance in a Pennsylvania court Monday night. The judge read the entire criminal complaint out loud to Mangione after the suspect said that no one had read it to him prior to that moment. Mangione verbally pushed back against two claims from prosecutors in court — first a claim that because Mangione was found with $8,000 in cash on him that he was trying to evade authorities. The other claim was that because he had a Faraday bag on him, which blocks cell signal — this showed evidence of criminal sophistication. Mangione said to the first claim that he did not know where the money he had on him came from, saying maybe it was planted. On the second claim, he said that the bag was waterproof and he didn’t know about criminal sophistication. He was ordered held without bail. He did not enter a plea. His next court appearance will be on December 23 in Pennsylvania pending an expected warrant from New York. After Luigi Mangione was arrested, an officer searched a backpack he had with him and found “a black 3D-printed pistol and a black silencer,” which was also 3D printed, according to the criminal complaint. The pistol “has one loaded Glock magazine with six nine-millimeter full metal jacket rounds,” as well as one “loose nine-millimeter hollow point round,” the complaint says. The pistol was also accompanied by a metal slide and plastic handle with metal threaded barrel, the complaint said. Law enforcement officials in Pennsylvania are giving an update on the man suspected of killing Brian Thompson, the CEO of UnitedHealthcare. Luigi Mangione appeared in person for a preliminary arraignment earlier this evening in Blair County. He was arrested on gun charges in nearby Altoona Monday morning at a McDonalds following a tip from an employee. Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro, state police and other local law enforcement officials are expected to speak, according to a statement from the governor’s office. Luigi Mangione, the suspect in the killing of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson, was charged with five counts, according to a criminal complaint released Monday. He is charged with one felony count of forgery, one felony count of carrying a firearm without a license, one misdemeanor count of tampering with records or identification, one misdemeanor count of possessing instruments of a crime and one misdemeanor count of false identification to law enforcement authorities, the complaint says. Luigi Mangione has arrived at the Blair County Courthouse in Hollidaysburg, Pennsylvania, video from outside the courthouse shows. He has been interviewed by police, an Altoona police officer told CNN. Law enforcement sources say that Luigi Mangione, suspected killer of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson, “wrote a hand-written document that speaks to both his motivations and mindset.” Police in Pennsylvania found the document when they apprehended the suspect earlier today. CNN’s Josh Campbell breaks down what we know so far. Law enforcement sources say that Luigi Mangione, suspected killer of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson, “wrote a hand-written document that speaks to both his motivations and mindset.” CNN’s Josh Campbell breaks down what we know so far. #news #cnn #unitedhealth Luigi Mangione, the man arrested in connection with the fatal shooting of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson, will have a preliminary arraignment tonight in Hollidaysburg, Pennsylvania, at 6 p.m. ET, according to a spokesperson for the Pennsylvania State Courts. Mangione will appear in person. Hollidaysburg is a borough in Pennsylvania about about 7 miles south of Altoona. The suspect police are questioning in the slaying of the UnitedHealthcare CEO is an Ivy League graduate software engineer from a prominent Baltimore family who appears to have favorably reviewed the manifesto of the Unabomber on a book website. Luigi Mangione, 26, was identified by New York police Monday as a “strong person of interest” in the shooting of CEO Brian Thompson last week. Family: The suspect is the grandson of Nicholas Mangione, a prominent Baltimore real estate developer, and his wife, Mary C. Mangione, a philanthropist who died last year. The Mangione family owns Lorien Health Systems, a nursing home chain in Maryland, and Luigi volunteered there in 2014, according to his LinkedIn page. Education: Mangione graduated from the prestigious Gilman School, an all-boys school that is known as one of Baltimore’s toniest private schools, and was the high school valedictorian in 2016. He also attended the University of Pennsylvania, where he graduated in 2020 with a master’s and bachelor’s degree in computer science and a minor in mathematics, a university spokesperson told CNN. Mangione was a member of the Phi Kappa Psi fraternity, social media photos show. Work: After graduating, Mangione worked as a software engineer for the online car sales company TrueCar, according to his LinkedIn page. His most recent address was in Hawaii, NYPD officials said. Mangione is registered to vote at his family’s address in Cockeysville, Maryland, a Baltimore suburb, and is registered as unaffiliated with a political party, according to the state’s voter registration lookup website. He is the cousin of Maryland State Delegate Nino Mangione, a Republican, the state lawmaker’s office confirmed to local media. Private security guards were blocking access to the family’s house on a golf club Monday afternoon. Read more about what we know about the suspect. CNN has obtained photos of the firearm and a fake ID that were found while searching suspect Luigi Mangione after his arrest on a gun charge Monday. While searching Mangione, police found multiple fake IDs, including one the NYPD believes was used by the suspect in New York City, officials say. New York City Police Commissioner Jessica Tisch said on Monday a firearm was found while searching the suspect. Chief of Detectives Joseph Kenny said the gun was a ghost gun “that had the capability of firing a 9mm round,” and it may have been 3D printed. The NYPD and FBI are now in Altoona, Pennsylvania, as investigators look to interview the suspect in the killing of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson, according to Republican Rep. John Joyce of Pennsylvania. “Just in the last 30 minutes, the FBI and the NYPD have arrived at the Altoona Police Department’s headquarters,” Joyce, who represents the Altoona area, told CNN’s Jake Tapper. The suspect was arrested on gun charges at a McDonalds in the central Pennsylvania city after an employee recognized him and called police. The suspect would need to be extradited him to New York to face any charges there. The Altoona area, Joyce said, has “great availability” to modes of transportation, including interstate highways, trains and bus routes. The suspect was believed to have left New York City on an interstate bus, police officials said last week, after video cameras captured him entering the George Washington Bridge Bus Station on 178th Street in upper Manhattan but not exiting. Joyce praised the McDonald’s employee, calling their actions “very courageous.” The head of the private school where the UnitedHealthcare CEO shooting suspect graduated from sent an email to parents and members of the school community, calling the news “deeply distressing.” “This is deeply distressing news on top of an already awful situation. Our hearts go out to everyone affected,” Gilman School Head of School Henry P.A. Smyth said in the email. The Gilman School is a private school in Baltimore for students from kindergarten through 12th grade. Smyth acknowledged Luigi Mangione graduated in 2016 but said the school has no other information other than what’s being reported in the news. A GoodReads profile that appears to belong to Luigi Mangione shows that earlier this year, Mangione reported having read the 1995 anti-technology manifesto written by the Unabomber Ted Kaczynski, the infamous domestic terrorist and mathematician known for sending deadly bombs through the mail between 1978 and 1995. “It’s easy to quickly and thoughtless[ly] write this off as the manifesto of a lunatic, in order to avoid facing some of the uncomfortable problems it identifies. But it’s simply impossible to ignore how prescient many of his predictions about modern society turned out,” Mangione wrote in a review of the book in January. “He was a violent individual - rightfully imprisoned - who maimed innocent people. While these actions tend to be characterized as those of a crazy luddite, however, they are more accurately seen as those of an extreme political revolutionary.” In his review, he also wrote thoughts someone else had shared about the Unabomber in a Reddit thread online, quoting a commenter who had described Kaczynksi’s acts as “war and revolution,” saying that he “had the balls to recognize that peaceful protest has gotten us absolutely nowhere” and that “‘violence never solved anything” is a statement uttered by cowards and predators.” Other books Mangione reported reading or wanting to read included a book about mental illness, a biography of the creator of the atomic bomb and Michael Pollan’s popular book on the science of psychedelics. Also on GoodReads, he reported reading or wanting to read a number of books about coping with chronic back pain. An X account that appears to belong to him features a background profile photo of what looks like an X-ray image of a spine with hardware from a surgery. Police are questioning a man in Altoona, Pennsylvania, in connection with the fatal shooting of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson last week in Manhattan. NYPD officials on Monday identified the man as 26-year-old Luigi Mangione. He is under arrest on gun charges, police said. Here’s what else we learned: Catch up on other key developments: One former University of Pennsylvania classmate of Luigi Mangione, the 26-year-old man arrested in connection with the killing of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson, recalls him being a “totally normal guy.” The former college classmate asked not to be named. A private memorial service for UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson is being held Monday, according to a person familiar with the plans. The service comes five days after Thompson, who leaves behind a widow and two sons, was gunned down outside a midtown Manhattan hotel while on his way to attend his company’s annual investor conference. NYPD officials on Monday identified the suspect in Thompson’s killing as 26-year-old Luigi Mangione, who was arrested in Pennsylvania on gun charges after a McDonald’s employee saw him and called police. Now that police are holding a suspect in custody in connection to the killing of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson, they will continue to try to tie him to recovered evidence, according to CNN security correspondent Josh Campbell. When the man was arrested at a McDonald’s in Altoona, Pennsylvania, Monday morning, local police said he had a gun with a suppressor. He was arrested on charges relating to the gun, officials said. NYPD Chief of Detectives Joseph Kenny later said that gun was a “ghost gun” — meaning it is more difficult to tie to past crimes, according to Campbell. But, police will now test to see if the ballistics match the shell casings found at the scene of the shooting in Manhattan last week, he added. “When you look at firearm testing, it’s very much like a fingerprint. Whenever a projectile leaves the end of that gun, there are unique markings,” Campbell said. Law enforcement, often with the help of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF), capture the bullet that is fired and the casing that gets ejected, he said. They then “essentially take it under a microscope and actually look for those unique patterns whenever the shell casing makes contact with that gun,” according to Campbell. If those ballistics match, Campbell said it could be “very strong evidence.” Police have also tested a fingerprint recovered from a purported burner phone thought to have belonged to the suspect and DNA recovered from a water bottle and energy bar wrapper he is said to have bought — but so far, neither have turned up any matches. “They’re going to take DNA swabs from him, even if they need a search warrant to get that and then compare that to DNA recovered here,” according to CNN chief law enforcement and intelligence analyst John Miller. UnitedHealth thanked law enforcement for apprehending the man suspected of shooting and killing CEO Brian Thompson in midtown Manhattan last week. “Our hope is that today’s apprehension brings some relief to Brian’s family, friends, colleagues, and the many others affected by this unspeakable tragedy,” a spokesperson for UnitedHealth Group said in a statement Tuesday. UnitedHealth Group is the parent company of health insurance company UnitedHealthcare. The company is working with authorities on the ongoing investigation, the statement said. “We thank law enforcement and will continue to work with them on this investigation. We ask that everyone respect the family’s privacy as they mourn,” the statement added. A multi-page, handwritten document was recovered from the person of interest arrested in the UnitedHealthcare CEO shooting, NYPD Chief of Detectives Joseph Kenny said Tuesday. “We don’t think there’s any specific threats to other people mentioned in that document, but it does seem that he has some ill will towards corporate America,” Kenny said. The document is currently in the possession of the Altoona Police Department, he noted. Police recovered an enormous amount of evidence in the investigation, which is ongoing, Kenny said. The man arrested in Pennsylvania had a “ghost gun” when he was searched by local police at a McDonald’s, according to NYPD Chief of Detectives Joseph Kenny. “He was in possession of a ghost gun that had the capability of firing a 9mm round and a suppressor,” he said. Kenny added that the gun may have been 3D printed and that police will learn more details after ballistics testing. Some context: Ghost guns are untraceable, self-assembled firearms, often put together with parts sold online, sometimes in as little as 30 minutes. The weapons, sometimes referred to by officials as “privately made firearms,” or PMFs, do not have serial numbers, making them all the more difficult to track and regulate. Purchasing kits to build ghost guns online does not require a background check, so buyers can sidestep the typical requirements that might come with buying a firearm. CNN’s Dakin Andone contributed reporting to this post. Among the lines in the two-page document found on “strong person of interest” Luigi Mangione are the following two quotes: “These parasites had it coming” and “I do apologize for any strife and trauma, but it had to be done,” a police official who has seen the document told CNN. In the note, Mangione says he acted alone and that he was self-funded. The document railed against the health care industry and suggested violence is the answer, according to the official. Investigators believe Luigi Mangione, the person of interest in the killing of the UnitedHealthcare CEO, acted alone. “We believe at this point — our investigation is leaning toward he was acting alone,” said NYPD Chief of Detectives Joseph Kenny said on Monday. He added that the investigation is ongoing. The person of interest in the killing of UnitedHealthcare’s CEO was “sitting there eating” at a McDonald’s in Altoona, Pennsylvania, when an employee of the restaurant called police, NYPD Chief of Detectives Joseph Kenny said. Kenny credited the tip to the wide circulation of a photo the NYPD released last week of the person without a mask on. “Luckily, a citizen in Pennsylvania recognized our subject and called local law enforcement,” he said. Kenny said that “at this point in our investigation, we don’t think he was trying to flee the country.” New York Police Department Commissioner Jessica Tisch credited investigators and the public after a person of interest was taken into custody in connection to the killing of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson. “For just over five days, our NYPD investigators combed through thousands of hours of video, followed up on hundreds of tips and processed every bit of forensic evidence — DNA, finger prints, IP addresses and so much more — to tighten the net,” Tisch said. Investigators deployed drones, K-9 units and even scuba divers during the search, she said. Detectives also went door-to-door “interviewing potential witnesses and doing the good old-fashioned police work that our investigators are famous for,” Tisch added. A combination of old school detective work and new-age technology “is what led to this result today,” the commissioner said. She also acknowledged the crucial role the media and public played in this case. Tips received led to the recovery of crucial evidence. “We should never underestimate the power of the public to be our eyes and our ears in these investigations,” Tisch said. The man who police in Pennsylvania were interviewing in connection to UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson’s killing had no prior arrests in New York, according to NYPD Chief of Detectives Joseph Kenny. The person was arrested on gun charges earlier Monday at a McDonald’s after officials received a tip from an employee, a law enforcement official said. In searching the man, they found a gun with a suppressor like the one used in the killing and multiple fake IDs, including one that the NYPD believes was used by the suspect in New York City, the officials say. “Members of the NYPD detective bureau are currently traveling to Pennsylvania with members of the district attorney’s office to interview this subject,” Kenny said at a news conference. He said the man is 26 years old and was born in Maryland. His last known address was in Honolulu, Hawaii, Kenny said. Altoona Police arrested 26-year-old Luigi Mangione, the person of interest in the fatal shooting of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson, New York City Police Commissioner Jessica Tisch said in a news conference Monday. “At this time, he is believed to be our person of interest in the brazen, targeted murder of Brian Thompson, CEO of UnitedHealthcare, last Wednesday in midtown Manhattan,” Tisch said. Mangione was arrested on firearms charges, Tisch said. NYPD detectives are on their way to Pennsylvania, where they hope to interview the suspect further, she noted. Mangione was found carrying multiple fraudulent IDs, a US passport, a firearm and suppressor “consistent with the weapon used in the murder,” Tisch said. Multiple sources briefed on the matter also told CNN the man being held in connection with the killing is Luigi Mangione. New York City police have “a strong person of interest” in the fatal shooting of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson, the city’s mayor said Monday. Mayor Eric Adams said at a news conference the person “matches the description of the identification.” “He’s also in possession of several items that we believe will connect him to this incident,” Adams said. New York City Mayor Eric Adams, along with police officials, is holding a news conference. They are expected to address the arrest of a man in connection with the fatal shooting of UnitedHealthCare CEO Brian Thompson. Altoona police arrested a man “matching the description of the United HealthCare CEO murder suspect” on Monday morning, according to a news release from the Altoona Police Department. Altoona officers were dispatched to a McDonald’s restaurant at 9:14 a.m. ET, according to the news release. The department is “cooperating with local, state, and federal agencies” and says more information will be released this evening. The man who is being held in Pennsylvania was also in possession of a two-page document railing against the health care industry and suggesting that violence is the answer, a police official who has seen the document told CNN. New York City Mayor Eric Adams is expected to speak at a scheduled news conference around 1:30 p.m. ET. He will be joined by police officials. A man being questioned in the fatal shooting of UnitedHealthcare’s CEO in New York City is under arrest in Altoona, Pennsylvania, in connection with charges to the gun police recovered, according to a law enforcement official. The man is being held in Pennsylvania, the official said. He would need to be extradited him to New York to face any charges there. The man was found Monday at an Altoona McDonald’s with a gun and a suppressor like those used in the December 4 homicide, law enforcement officials briefed on the situation tell CNN. The man being questioned by police in connection to the killing of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson was picked up in a McDonald’s in Altoona, Pennsylvania, after an employee thought he resembled the man in the NYPD’s photos and called the cops, multiple law enforcement officials briefed on the situation tell CNN. Altoona police responded to the call and picked up the man, who they say is 26 years old, and searched him. In the search, they found a gun with a suppressor — a device that muffles the sound of a firearm — like that used in the homicide and multiple fake IDs, including one that the NYPD believes was used by the suspect in New York City, the officials say. The man is under arrest on charges in connection with the gun recovered by police, according to a law enforcement official. The suspect was in possession of some documents that investigators also want to examine as potentially relating to motive, though further details on the documents were not clear. Altoona police are waiting for NYPD detectives, who are on their way. This post has been updated with additional details. CNN’s Mark Morales contributed reporting. Police are questioning a man in Altoona, Pennsylvania, in connection with the shooting and killing of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson, two law enforcement officials familiar with the matter tell CNN. Working off of a tip, police stopped an individual who was traveling by bus and recovered a suppressor — a device that muffles the sound of a firearm — and a number of false ID’s, one of the officials added. That man is now in custody and being questioned. New York Gov. Kathy Hochul condemned online rhetoric about the killing of UnitedHealthcare’s CEO as police continue to search for the shooter on Monday. “You can feel what you want about insurance companies; I’m not a big fan, and there’s a lot of people who are suffering because they’ve not had the support they’ve needed when their families or they themselves have been sick,” the governor said, answering questions from reporters after a presentation of the 2025 State of the State Agenda in New York City. “That is a real feeling, but that will never justify the commentary that is going on out there about the loss of a human being, the assassination of an individual on the streets of New York; we should all be shocked and outraged by that as I am,” she added. Online reaction: UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson’s killing unleashed a flurry of rage and frustration from social media users over denials of their medical claims, a public display of Americans’ pent-up anger at the nation’s complex health insurance industry. Police continue to look into whether words found on the shell casings from the scene — “delay, deny, defend,” according to NYPD Chief Detective Joseph Kenny — may point to a motive. A 2010 book critiquing the insurance industry is titled “Delay Deny Defend,” a common description of its tactics. The majority of insured US adults had at least one issue, including denial of claims, with their health insurance in the span of a year, according to a survey released in June 2023 by KFF, a nonprofit health policy research group. Detectives from the NYPD conducted parts of their investigation into the killing UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson over the weekend in Atlanta before returning to New York, two law enforcement officials tell CNN. The detectives reviewed surveillance footage from the Greyhound bus station in downtown Atlanta, but had not identified the shooter boarding one of the buses from the location by the time they left, according to the officials. The bus that police believe the killer traveled to New York on originated in Atlanta. Detectives investigating the killing of UnitedHealthcare’s chief executive have recovered possible DNA evidence from items found at the scene and have now turned it over to a lab for testing, according to a senior law enforcement official briefed on the investigation. However, a partial fingerprint and DNA have so far not yielded matches when compared against respective law enforcement databases, according to a law enforcement official on Monday. Police are testing a fingerprint recovered from a purported burner phone thought to have belonged to the suspect and DNA recovered from a water bottle and energy bar wrapper he is said to have bought — but so far neither have turned up any matches. The official told CNN that NYPD investigators finished processing the items and turned the samples over to the Office of the Chief Medical Examiner for testing Friday. Why this matters: The various pieces of evidence being uncovered by police are crucial not only for finding the gunman — but also for his prosecution. “The DNA evidence is important. Everything is for courtroom testimony so we can link him to the crime,” retired NYPD Detective Michael Alcazar told CNN on Friday. In addition to the water bottle and the cell phone, investigators also have a trail of surveillance video sightings as well as ammunition with the words “delay,” “deny” and “depose” written on them left at the scene of the crime, sources told CNN. The NYPD also released new images of the person of interest without a mask at the hostel where they believe he was staying at before the shooting. “Our DNA, our fingerprints are left everywhere — It could be on the countertop of that hostel, so as prepared as you think you might be, there’s mistakes that people make all the time and law enforcement relies on that,” Alcazar said. Police are piecing together the suspect’s movements in the days leading up to the fatal shooting of Brian Thompson, UnitedHealthcare’s CEO. Thompson was killed outside a Manhattan hotel on Wednesday, but police say the suspected gunman was in the city for more than a week before that. The suspected gunman traveled on a Greyhound bus that started its route in Atlanta, law enforcement sources told CNN. Authorities do not know whether the suspect boarded in Atlanta or elsewhere, sources said. The Atlanta Police Department will provide assistance to the NYPD as needed in the investigation, department officials announced Friday. Police believe the assailant arrived at New York City’s Port Authority bus terminal on November 24 — 10 days before the shooting — then checked into the Upper West Side hostel, a law enforcement official said. After that, he appears to have moved around the city, the official said. The suspected shooter appeared to wear a mask throughout most of his stay at the hostel, law enforcement sources told CNN. He was housed in a multi-person room with two other males, one source said. However, police did release an image of the suspect on Thursday that shows him at the hostel without a mask. The suspect checked out of the hostel on November 29 and checked back in on November 30, law enforcement sources told CNN. He paid the establishment in cash, according to one source — checking into the hostel using a fake New Jersey driver’s license, a law enforcement official previously told CNN. © 2024 Cable News Network.

The reasons for such a distinction didn't have much to do with the game's postseason implications — Cincinnati's playoff hopes are on their last legs, while Dallas' have already evaporated. Rather, this was a spectacle, just the sort that Jerry Jones envisioned when drawing up the plans for AT&T Stadium, the booming metropolis he hoped would house championship-caliber teams. So, how is that plan going along thus far? Well, on Monday, the Cowboys added a new low to a season increasingly filled with them, falling to the Bengals 27-20 under the MNF banner. MORE BENGALS-COWBOYS NEWS: A defeat to Cincinnati and its talismanic battery of Joe Burrow and Ja'Marr Chase wouldn't be a cause of much concern in normal circumstances. The pairing was as lively as ever on Monday, with Burrow completing 75 percent of his pass attempts and accounting for 369 yards and three touchdowns worth of passing offense. Chase collected 14 catches for 177 yards and two scores on the night, further cementing his place as a legitimate Offensive Player of the Year contender. For all of Burrow and Chase's heroics, it was Dallas that looked the likelier victors with two minutes left. Nick Vigil burst through the mire, got his harrowing mitts to Ryan Rehkow's attempted punt, and batted it down to a mere trickle off Rehkow's foot. The ball sidled back and forth like a tumbleweed as it bounded harmlessly toward midfield, seemingly foreshadowing some sort of Cowboys win. Right? Not exactly. Gunner Amani Oruwariye attempted to field the bouncing ball, only to mishandle the wild feather. It bounced into Cincinnati's hands afterward. League rules insist that in such a circumstance, the kicking team receives the ball with a full set of downs. Burrow and Chase went to work, chopped down Dallas' secondary in one fell swoop, and walked out fortunate victors. The Cowboys, meanwhile, were left rueing another seemingly incomprehensible defeat. The Sporting News tracked live scoring updates and highlights from Cowboys vs. Bengals. Below is the full record of what went down when Dallas and Cincinnati dueled with one another in AT&T Stadium.

However, Amani Oruwariye touched the ball but failed to recover it, giving Cincinnati the chance to recover the twirling ball and receive a new set of downs as a result. The Cowboys blocks the punt... but it was then touched by a Dallas player... and then recovered by the Bengals 🤯Chaos. @Bengals ball pic.twitter.com/Uw0l4ebH3v 11:05 p.m.: Dallas' defense breaches the gates, bringing Burrow to the canvas on the third-and-long blitz. The Cowboys are going to get the ball back as we sink below two minutes. 10:59 p.m.: Burrow's return to the field coincided with a new fashion choice: after being swept away in Dallas' pass rush last possession, he's sporting a bulky sleeve across his left knee — the same one he injured as a rookie. 10:55 p.m.: Dallas returns the favor, recording a three-and-out of its own. The Bengals will take control with about 5:40 left in the fourth. 10:48 p.m.: Cincinnati is forced to boot the ball away. However, it's fairly apparent that a rusher grab a fistful of Burrow's facemark prior to him getting wrapped in a sack. Nevertheless, the call wasn't made. As such, the Bengals are forced to kick it away. 10:45 p.m.: Tanner Hudson is the latest name to get involved in the offensive action, gobbling up 19 yards after absorbing a Burrow bolt. 10:41 p.m.: Cincinnati's defense bursts into life, stacking the deck to force a Dallas three-and-out.

Cowboys 20, Bengals 20 10:32 p.m.: Cincinnati returning to form quite quickly after Burrow's interception.

York sinks another field goal to push Cincy's lead to a touchdown-sized edge. Bengals 17, Cowboys 10 9:30 p.m.: Chase continues to flex his might over this weary Cowboys secondary.

Looks to be getting whatever he wants on offense, even when matched up against notable corners Bland and Diggs. 9:22 p.m.: Dallas falls flat on the ensuing drive, with the Bengals forcing a punt following a swift three-and-out. Cincinnati will have a chance to add to its advantage as the first half draws to a close. 9:14 p.m.: TOUCHDOWN! Brown fields Burrow's throw, races down the sidelines and dashes beyond a gaggle of Cowboys mercenaries, using Iosivas' timely block to take his place in the end zone.

They're making another trek deep into Cincinnati territory. 8:59 p.m.: Dallas shuts the door on fourth down. 8:55 p.m.: Chase finding it quite easy to get involved early. Just snagged another Burrow dot as Cincinnati gets a new se too downs. He's up to four catches for 46 yards and a score thus far. 8:52 p.m.: INTERCEPTION! Miscommunication between Rush and Lamb ends in heartbreak. Anticipating the slant pattern, Rush fired a ball towards Lamb's general vicinity. Unfortunately for the Dallas signal-caller, Lamb was displaced, caught under the weight of an incidental collision with his marker. The result? A deflected ball that eventually landed in Geno Stone's grasp. Cincinnati's defense records a much-desired turnover to halt Dallas' red zone progress.

Burrow has hit a stride, using Chase Brown and Ja'Marr Chase's chicanery to great effect as Cincinnati traipses towards Dallas' end zone. 8:24 p.m.: TOUCHDOWN! Lamb bursts beyond his opposite number, finds open space in the end zone and collects Rush's lofted effort on fourth-and-one. That's one way to make an impression in the game's opening minutes.

We'll see if Rush can take advantage. 8:18 p.m.: Trevon Diggs knocks the ball away from Tee Higgins as the Cowboys hold the high-powered Cincinnati offense to a three-and-out. A solid KaVontae Turpin return sets up Cooper Rush and Co. with good field position ahead of their first possession of the game. 8:15 p.m.: Brandon Aubrey sends the ball into the deep Dallas sky.

                "content": "The Cincinnati Bengals have snapped their three-game skid. Cincinnati defeated the Dallas Cowboys on the road in the Week 14 edition of “Monday Night Football,” 27-20. Wide receiver Ja’Marr Chase continued his incredible run with two more touchdowns, including a 40-yard catch-and-run that ended up being the game winner. That score made it eight touchdowns for the wideout in his last four games and extended his league lead to 15 receiving touchdowns this year. Chase might not have had a chance to score that touchdown if not for a wild sequence a few plays earlier. Bengals punter Ryan Rehkow’s punt was blocked by a Cowboys defender on fourth down coming out of the two-minute warning. But the tipped ball ended up bouncing off of the arms of cornerback/special teamer Amani Oruwariye, and Cincinnati recovered the fumble just shy of midfield. NFL STATS CENTRAL: The latest NFL scores, schedules, odds, stats and more. Three plays later, Chase took the game-winner to the house. Here’s the full story of how the Bengals finally won a one-score game after dropping three straight entering this week: DO YOU LIKE FOOTBALL? Then you'll enjoy getting our NFL newsletter delivered to your inbox A Bart Simpson-to-Lisa Simpson touchdown play won the game for the Bengals during \"The Simpsons\" alt-cast. Cooper Rush's pass attempt to Jake Ferguson on fourth-and-7 from the Cowboys' 48-yard line and 31 seconds remaining in the game fell incomplete. The Bengals prevailed, 27-20, thanks to that wild muffed blocked punt-to-long touchdown sequence. The Cowboys' Amani Oruwariye attempted to field a blocked punt, and it turned out to be quite costly for Dallas. Oruwariye couldn't field the blocked kick cleanly and turned it over the Bengals, who immediately took advantage of their great fortune. Instead of getting the ball back with two minutes remaining, the Cowboys got burned by Bengals receiver Ja'Marr Chase for a 40-yard touchdown pass from Joe Burrow. Chase finished the game with 14 catches for 177 yards and two touchdowns. The 14 receptions ties a record for the most in a \"Monday Night Football\" game. It was a stunning turn over events at AT&T Stadium. And for Cowboys fans, Oruwariye's muff might live in infamy alongside Leon Lett's gaffe on Thanksgiving Day 1993. Cade York knocked through his second field goal attempt of the night, this one from 29 yards out, to draw the game back even. Early in the fourth quarter, DeMarvion Overshown was in on a tackle of Bengals running back Chase Brown. After the play, the Cowboys' linebacker remained on the ground and needed the help of two Cowboys trainers to walk off of the field. Overshown has been declared out with a knee injury. Overshown, a member of the 2023 NFL draft class, missed the entirety of his rookie season after tearing his ACL in a preseason game. He had played in all 12 games for the Cowboys entering Monday night's game. Former MLS first-round draft pick Brandon Aubrey nailed his second field goal attempt of the night to give the Cowboys another lead. Dallas leads, 20-17, five seconds into the fourth quarter. Dallas has the ball on Cincinnati's 29-yard line on fourth-and-10 and will attempt a field goal to begin the fourth quarter. Joe Burrow overthrew Ja'Marr Chase deep downfield, and his pass ended in the hands of the Cowboys' safety instead. Dallas will take over possession on its own 17-yard line with 6:50 to play in the third quarter. Over on \"The Simpsons\" alt-cast, it was Cowboys safety Homer Simpson who intercepted Bengals quarterback Bart Simpson on the play. The Cowboys scored on their first possession of the second half thanks to Brandin Cooks' efforts in the end zone. The receiver ripped through a defensive hold by cornerback Josh Newton, and Cooper Rush found him in the back of the end zone for the score. It's 17-17 with 10:32 left in the third quarter. The Cowboys went three-and-out on their final possession of the first half, and this \"Monday Night Football\" matchup goes to halftime with the Bengals holding a seven-point lead. Dallas will receive the second half kickoff. The Bengals drove down to the red zone before they were stopped by Dallas' defense at the 19. Cade York hit a 37-yard field goal to give Cincinnati a 17-10 lead with 30 seconds left in the second quarter. Dallas will have one last possession before it receives the second half kickoff. Did you know York is dating a Cowboys cheerleader? Chase Brown took a swing pass from Joe Burrow to the house and celebrated his score by jumping into the Salvation Army kettle behind the end zone. Though the running back was initially declared out of bounds at the 3-yard line, the call was overturned after a review. The touchdown gave Cincinnati its first lead of the game. The Bengals lead, 13-10, with 3:30 left in the first half. Over on \"The Simpsons\" alt-cast, Lisa Simpson — who displayed her athletic abilities as a hockey goalie in the episode \"Lisa on Ice\" — came into the game for the Bengals as the running back and took Joe Burrow's pass to the end zone. Dallas is unable to take full advantage of the good field position when its drive stalls at the Bengals' 17-yard line. Brandon Aubrey knocks through a 35-yard field goal to make it 10-7 Cowboys with 6:23 left in the second quarter. The Bengals opted to go for it facing a fourth-and-3 in Dallas territory. DeMarvion Overshown managed to break forward to defend Joe Burrow's touch pass attempt to running back Chase Brown, which fell to the ground incomplete. The Cowboys will take over near midfield with just under 10 minutes to go in the first half. On the first play of the second quarter, Cooper Rush's pass attempt was tipped by cornerback Cam Taylor-Britt and intercepted by Geno Stone inside the Bengals' 5-yard line. Cincinnati takes over on its own 4 five seconds into the period. Dallas and Cincinnati are knotted at one score apiece after 15 minutes, but the Cowboys will have second-and-10 from the Bengals' 12-yard line to start the second quarter. After CeeDee Lamb caught a screen pass behind the line of scrimmage, Bengals linebacker Germaine Pratt got his hands on the receiver almost immediately. The veteran wideout was able to escape the tackle and ran across the width of the field before turning upfield for a massive gain. The play brought the Cowboys from their own 33-yard line to just outside of the red zone with less than two minutes left in the first quarter. Bengals quarterback Joe Burrow marched his team down the field on an 11-play, 70-yard drive that concluded with Ja'Marr Chase hauling in a contested catch in the end zone. It's the wideout's seventh touchdown in his last four games. This game is tied, 7-7, with 2:45 remaining in the first quarter. Over on \"The Simpsons\" alt-cast, Bart Simpson enters the game to play quarterback for the Bengals and throws a touchdown pass to Ralph Wiggum, who somehow got position for the reception against the Cowboys' Pro Bowl cornerback DaRon Bland. Bart Simpson has shown significant improvement at the position ever since his infamous tenure as a quarterback in the episode \"Bart Star.\" After a three-and-out by the Bengals' offense, Cowboys quarterback Cooper Rush led a nine-play, 60-yard touchdown drive to open the scoring. Rush found Lamb in the back-right corner of the end zone on a fourth-and-1 play from the Cincinnati 11-yard line. Over on \"The Simpsons\" alt-cast, quarterback Homer Simpson came in to connect with Lamb for the touchdown play.

Welcome to 2024 and this battle of the streaming wars, as Disney and ESPN unveil its most alternative alt-cast for \"Monday Night Football\" as the Cowboys host the Bengals. “We were just so lucky also that the Cowboys are sort of like a Homer Simpson-type team, American team, and Mike McCarthy might be a Homer-type guy, one might imagine,” “The Simpsons” showrunner Matt Selman said on a conference call last week. “And then you have Joe Burrow on the other side who is a cool young, spiky-haired, blonde bad boy – he's like Bart. And that fits our character archetypes so perfectly.” — Chris Bumbaca Here's how the USA TODAY Sports staff feels the Cowboys vs. Bengals \"MNF\" matchup will sway: The Bengals are favorites to defeat the Cowboys, according to the BetMGM NFL odds.

Dak Prescott suffered a partial hamstring avulsion – a tear during which part of the tendon rips off the bone – during Dallas' 27-21 loss to the Falcons in Week 9. He told reporters after the contest that he wasn't sure if the injury occurred while he was running or being tackled. \"It's something I’ve never felt,\" Prescott said while describing the injury. \"I saw the medical team and asked could I make it worse. At that point they said I wouldn’t be able to protect myself and made the call to hold me out.\" According to BetMGM Sportsbook, the Cowboys have +3000 odds to to make the playoffs entering Week 14. That implied probability gives Dallas a 3.23% chance of qualifying for the postseason. That's greater than the estimated 1% chance that the New York Times gives the Cowboys to win their way into the postseason. That speaks to the fact that Dallas would likely need to win out and receive plenty of help to claw its way back into the NFC playoff race after a 3-7 start to the season. The Cowboys' five remaining opponents have a combined winning percentage of .508, per Tankathon. That makes Dallas' remaining schedule the 17th toughest of the NFL's 32 teams entering Week 14. The said, the Cowboys will face a test on \"Monday Night Football\" in Week 14 against a high-flying Cincinnati Bengals offense. Dallas will also end the season with two divisional games, so that will make it difficult to win out. That makes it easy to understand why oddsmakers aren't bullish the Cowboys' chances of making a playoff push, especially considering that they would need a team in front of them, like the Commanders, to falter. Below is a full look at Dallas' schedule: In the hunt: x – clinched playoff berth Should the Cowboys opt to move on from Mike McCarthy following the 2024 season, there are several options who could be targeted as next Dallas head coach: The Bengals travel to Jerry World on Monday night.

                "content": "ARLINGTON, Texas -- Bengals wide receiver Ja'Marr Chase re-gained the NFL receiving lead with a season-high 14 catches, the last one a spectacular 40-yard-catch-and-run touchdown with 1:01 left that gave the Bengals a 27-20 win over the Cowboys Monday night. Former Bengals linebacker Nick Vigil blocked rookie punter Ryan Rehkow's punt on the first play after two-minute warning, but a Cowboy touched it, and Bengals rookie linebacker Maema Njongmeta recovered to give Cincinnati a new set of downs. Quarterback Joe Burrow had his fifth straight game of at least three touchdown passes and his fourth straight 300-yard day with 369 yards, 177 to Chase. Ja’Marr Chase caught a swing pass from Joe Burrow on the game's first play from scrimmage, marking his 80th reception of the season. He became the first player in NFL history to record 80+ catches, 1,000+ receiving yards and 7+ receiving touchdowns in each of his first four career seasons. On his game-winning touchdown catch late in the fourth period, Chase surpassed 5,000 career receiving yards. Playing in his 58th regular-season game, he tied former Saints receiver Michael Thomas as the fifth-fastest player in league history to reach 5K receiving yards. Chase's final tally was 14 receptions for 177 yards and two scores. His 14 grabs were the second-most in his career, and tied for the second-most in any game in Bengals history. Burrow Joins Elite Company Burrow completed 33 of 44 passes for 369 yards and three touchdowns with an interception, good for a passer rating of 112.8. He became the sixth quarterback all-time to throw for 300+ yards and 3+ touchdowns in four consecutive games. The record for most such consecutive games belongs to Steve Young, who hit those numbers in five straight contests in 1998. Drew Brees (2011-12), Peyton Manning (2012), Aaron Rodgers (2012-13) and Patrick Mahomes (2018) are the other quarterbacks who did it in four straight. Burrow found Chase in the end zone on a second-and-goal play to give Cincinnati its first points of the game with 2:45 left in the first quarter. It was Chase's 14th receiving touchdown of the season, which extended his league-leading total and set a new career high. His previous career high of 13 touchdowns came in his 2021 rookie campaign. Chase's 14 receiving scores also stand alone as the second-most in a season in Bengals history, three shy of Carl Pickens' record 17 touchdowns in 1995. The touchdown additionally was the 43rd of Chase's career, which surpassed former Patriots tight end Rob Gronkowski (42) for the fourth-most within a player's first four seasons in NFL history. Only Hall of Famers Randy Moss (53), Randy Moss (49) and Bob Hayes (45) caught more touchdowns in their first four years. Chase eclipsed 100 yards on the night with his ninth catch early in the third quarter. It marked his 18th career game with 100+ receiving yards (fourth this season), which tied former receiver Cris Collinsworth for the fifth-most in Bengals history. Chase finished the night with 14 catches for 177 yards and two touchdowns. Second-year halfback Chase Brown finished the night with 58 rushing yards on 14 attempts and 65 receiving yards on six catches, good for 123 total yards from scrimmage. It marked his fifth game this season with over 100 scrimmage yards. In the process, he also surpassed 1,000 scrimmage yards on the year, moving up to 1,037. Vote for The 2025 Pro Bowl Games! Send your favorite Bengals to Orlando for the 2025 Pro Bowl Games! Brown took a Burrow swing pass and raced 19 yards to the pylon to give Cincinnati a 14-10 lead late in the second quarter. It was Brown's third scoring reception of the season, and his 10th career touchdown overall (six rushing, four receiving). Brown now has nine touchdowns over his last 10 games played, dating back to Week 4 at Carolina. Geno Stone came up with his second interception of the season midway through the second quarter, when he secured a pass that was deflected by Cam Taylor-Britt to end a Cowboys drive that reached Cincinnati's 12-yard line. It also was the 10th pick of Stone's career. Check out the best photos from Cowboys-Bengals Week 14 matchup. The Bengals line up for the snap against the Cowboys in Dallas, Monday, December 9, 2024.

                "title": "Daniel Penny found not guilty in chokehold death of Jordan Neely",
                "content": "Profile Sections Local tv Featured More From NBC Follow NBC News news Alerts There are no new alerts at this time Daniel Penny was acquitted Monday of criminally negligent homicide in the chokehold death of Jordan Neely, a 30-year-old homeless man with a history of mental illness whose final moments on a New York City subway train were captured on bystander video that set off weeks of protests and drew national attention. The decision, on the fifth day of deliberations, came after the jury deadlocked Friday on the more serious charge of manslaughter, leading the judge to dismiss it. Penny faced up to four years in prison. As the jury foreperson read the “not guilty” verdict, some observers in the courtroom applauded. Others began to audibly sob and yell, including Neely’s father, Andre Zachery, who was escorted out. “This is America. That is the sound of Black pain,” one person said outside of the courtroom in Lower Manhattan to the reaction. Chants of “no justice, no peace,” could be heard echoing from outside. The case divided people in New York — and beyond — in some cases along political and racial lines. Neely was Black. Penny is white. Some people viewed Penny as callous and his actions as criminal on the day he encountered Neely, who had been shouting and acting erratically when he boarded a subway train in Manhattan on May 1, 2023. Others contend Penny was selfless in his attempt to protect fellow passengers. Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg said he respected the jury's verdict. The jury deliberated for about an hour on the criminally negligent homicide charge after about four days spent considering the manslaughter charge. “Their lengthy deliberation — and the totality of the facts and the evidence — underscored why this case was put in front of a jury of Mr. Penny's peers,” Bragg said in a statement. The anonymous jury, made up of seven women and five men, were told before they began deliberating that they had to come to a unanimous decision on the top charge of manslaughter in the second degree before moving on to consider criminally negligent homicide. But Judge Maxwell Wiley changed that order Friday after jurors twice sent a note saying they could not reach an agreement. The judge had also instructed jurors to decide whether Penny’s actions caused Neely’s death and, if so, whether he had acted recklessly and in an unjustified manner. Before he encountered Penny, Neely, a former Michael Jackson impersonator, ranted about being hungry and thirsty and said that he wanted to return to jail and didn’t care if he lived or died, witnesses testified. Penny, 26, a former Marine and Long Island native, placed Neely in a chokehold that prosecutors said lasted almost six minutes. A New York City medical examiner ruled that Neely died from compression to his neck as a result of the chokehold. Neely’s uncle, Christopher Neely, said he was “taken aback” as the verdict was announced because he thought the jury would at least convict him on the lesser charge. “At least give him a charge because it should be some type of penalty that should have been been handed down to Danny Penny period. They gave him no penalty, and I feel like the jury gave up on us,” Neely said. Donte Mills, a lawyer representing Neely's family, said at a news conference that he was disheartened by the verdict Monday, as supporters held up a picture of Neely dressed as Jackson. Mills asked that Neely's death have meaning, and urged that others, instead of becoming physical with someone who may be hungry, offer them food. “He had a muffin in his pocket,” Mills said of what police later discovered in Neely's jacket. “Jordan just wanted someone to acknowledge him on the train, but instead, he was choked to death.” Lawyers for Penny could not immediately be reached for comment about the verdict, but had earlier expressed concern Monday to the judge that the jury could be influenced by the demonstrators' chanting coming from outside the courthouse. During the trial, Penny’s attorneys told jurors that he stepped in because he believed Neely might attack other passengers and he intended only to restrain him until police arrived, which Penny also told police. They also argued that Neely was not killed by the chokehold and that it was impossible to measure how much pressure Penny had applied. A forensic pathologist hired by the defense testified that Neely died from a combination of his schizophrenia, synthetic marijuana, sickle cell trait and the struggle from being in Penny’s restraint. But the medical examiner who performed the autopsy on Neely, Dr. Cynthia Harris, told jurors it was her medical opinion “that there are no alternative reasonable explanations” for his death and that those proposed by the defense were “so improbable — that it stands shoulder to shoulder with impossibility.” During cross-examination, one of Penny’s attorneys, Steven Raiser sought to cast doubt on Harris’ testimony about how she and her colleagues had come to a unanimous decision as to Neely’s cause of death. Raiser suggested that they had failed to consider all the facts before making that determination. He revisited that claim in his closing argument last week. “I submit to you there was a rush to judgment, based on something other than medical science,” he told jurors. The case also spurred debates about safety within the city’s subway system and failures in addressing homelessness and mental illness, both of which Neely had struggled with. Jumaane Williams, a Black Democrat who is New York City’s public advocate, was among those who questioned why police let Penny go after questioning him at a precinct hours after Neely’s killing. New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, also a Democrat, said Neely had been “murdered.” Prominent Republicans like Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis and Matt Gaetz praised Penny and promoted a fundraiser for his legal fund, which has raised more than $3 million. His defense team includes Thomas Kenniff, a Republican who ran unsuccessfully for Manhattan District Attorney in 2021. Vice President-elect JD Vance said on X in response to the verdict that “justice was done in this case. It was a scandal Penny was ever prosecuted in the first place.” Prosecutors did not dispute that Neely’s actions on the train scared many of the passengers or that he was on synthetic cannabinoids, which were found in his system. In her opening statement, Dafna Yoran, an assistant prosecutor with the Manhattan District Attorney’s Office, said that Neely had “demanded to be seen” and that despite his not having touched anyone and not having displayed a weapon or threatened to use one, many people in the subway car were frightened of what he might do. She has said Penny’s “initial intent was even laudable,” but that he was reckless when he continued to choke Neely even after he posed no threat, including after the train doors had opened at the next station and passengers could exit. For some of that time, she said and video showed, two other men helped restrain Neely. One of those men testified that he believed Penny had held the chokehold for too long. At times, Yoran said, he even ignored the pleas of bystanders to let Neely go. In her closing argument, Yoran said that “no one had to die” and that Penny was not justified in his use of physical deadly force. “You obviously cannot kill someone because they are crazy and ranting and looking menacing,” Yoran told jurors in her closing argument. “No matter what it is that they are saying.” She also said that Penny “could have easily restrained” Neely “without choking him to death.” In his closing argument, Raiser prompted jurors to imagine that they were on the train the day Neely boarded “filled with rage and not afraid of any consequences.” “With you sitting much as you are now in this tightly confined space, looking up at Mr. Neely,” he said. “You have very little room to move and nowhere to run.” “Danny,” as the defense attorneys referred to Penny throughout the trial, “put his life on the line” and stepped up in the absence of police, Raiser said. But Yoran challenged the portrayal of Penny as a self-sacrificing and benevolent subway rider. In her opening statement she said that Penny failed to acknowledge Neely’s humanity. She continued that thread in her closing argument, playing video of Penny twice referring to Neely as a “crackhead” in an interview with police and telling jurors that he never asked about Neely’s condition. “There is something else that is glaringly missing from his statement. Any regret. Any remorse. Any self reflection,” she said. She added: “He never expresses any sorrow about the man’s death.” During deliberations, jurors asked to rewatch bystander videos of Penny restraining Neely, responding officers’ body camera videos and video of Penny’s subsequent interview with two police detectives at a precinct. They also asked to rehear the medical examiner’s testimony about issuing a death certificate before Neely’s full toxicology reports were completed. They also asked for the judge to read back the definitions of recklessness and criminal negligence and to have the definitions in writing. Penny chose not to testify. During the trial, jurors heard from more than 40 witnesses — subway passengers who witnessed Penny restrain Neely, police officers who responded to the scene, a Marine Corps instructor who taught Penny various chokeholds, the two pathologists, a psychiatric expert and six character witnesses, who included two Marines, Penny’s mother and one of his sisters. On Wednesday, Neely’s father sued Penny accusing him of negligent contact, assault and battery that caused Neely’s death. The civil suit was filed in New York state’s Supreme Court, a trial-level court in New York state. Janelle Griffith is a national reporter for NBC News focusing on issues of race and policing.

                "content": "Watch CBS News By Alice Gainer, Dick Brennan, Tim McNicholas Updated on: December 10, 2024 / 8:17 AM EST / CBS New York NEW YORK -- Daniel Penny was found not guilty of criminally negligent homicide in the chokehold death of Jordan Neely on a New York City subway car in 2023. Penny, a 26-year-old Marine veteran, had pleaded not guilty to charges of second-degree manslaughter and criminally negligent homicide. The judge dismissed the manslaughter charge on Friday after jurors said they could not come to a unanimous decision. The jury could only consider the negligent homicide charge if Penny was cleared of manslaughter. Word of the verdict came after jurors deliberated for more than 20 hours. Penny appeared to smile, as his attorneys hugged each other. \"We couldn't be more pleased that a jury of Danny's peers acquitted him of any wrongdoing. And now New Yorkers can take some comfort in knowing that we can continue to stand up for one another without sacrificing our rights or our freedoms,\" his lawyers said in a statement. His attorneys later shared a photo on social media showing them raise a glass at a bar after the verdict. CBS News New York's Alice Gainer was inside the courtroom when the decision came down. She reported it was chaos, as some cheered in support of Penny, and Neely's father, Andre Zachery, had to leave the room because he stood up and was heard swearing. Zachery told CBS News New York, \"My son didn't have to go through this. I didn't have to go through this, either. It hurts. It really, really hurts,\" adding, \"What's going to happen to us now? Had enough of this. System is rigged. Come on, people. Let's do something about this.\" Penny faced a maximum possible sentence of 15 years in prison on the manslaughter charge, or four years on the negligent homicide charge. There was no minimum sentence. Protesters lined up outside the courthouse Monday, chanting \"Justice for Jordan Neely!\" Inside, Penny's defense team asked for a mistrial and once again was denied. The defense also raised concerns that jurors could potentially hear some of what the demonstrators were saying. They said the demonstrators were using megaphones and bullhorns, chanting things like, \"Murdered!\" and \"Subway strangler!\" The judge agreed he also heard the commotion and reminded the jury to ignore things they may hear or read about the case. One activist who had been outside demonstrating every morning was inside and yelled something at Penny along the lines of \"It's a small world, buddy.\" \"Our call to action is to take care of each other. We can't rely on outside people. If we see someone asking for food, we have to take the responsibility to give it to them. If we see someone cold, to give them a coat. If we see someone going through something, to ask them if they're OK,\" Donte Mills, attorney for the Neely family, said during a news conference outside the courthouse. \"That's how we help each other, because we can't rely on the system to do it for us.\" Eric Garner's mother, Gwen Carr, also spoke outside the courthouse, saying, \"No one deserves to be choked to death,\" adding, \"I tell this family, do not give up, because that's what they want you to do. They want to discourage you, just like they tried to discourage me. Ten years later, I'm still fighting.\" The Rev. Al Sharpton, who spoke at Neely's funeral, put out a statement, which read, in part, \"This verdict represents the blatant legalization of civilian vigilantism, sending a dangerous message that citizens can now take matters into their own hands, even if it leads to someone's death.\" \"It was foolish of us to think that a Black man would get justice in a system that is designed to keep him oppressed,\" added Chivona Newsome, co-founder of Black Lives Matter Greater New York. The verdict drew praise from Vice President-elect JD Vance and New York Congressman Mike Lawler, who both criticized Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg for prosecuting Penny. Bragg released a statement following the verdict, saying: \"As with every case, we followed the facts and the evidence from beginning to end. A Grand Jury voted to indict, and the Office carefully presented this case to a trial jury. \"Over the course of the trial, we introduced medical records, videos, bodycam footage, and testimony from over 30 witnesses, including from the City's Office of the Chief Medical Examiner. \"The jury carefully deliberated for four days. They requested readbacks of testimony and asked for video footage to re-watch, as well as written definitions of the law. Their lengthy deliberation - and the totality of the facts and the evidence -- underscored why this case was put in front of a jury of Mr. Penny's peers. \"The jury has now spoken. At the Manhattan D.A.'s Office we deeply respect the jury process and we respect their verdict. \"Unfortunately, over the duration of this trial, talented career prosecutors and their family members were besieged with hate and threats -- on social media, by phone and over email. Simply put, this is unacceptable, and everyone, no matter your opinion on this case, should condemn it. These are prosecutors who have dedicated decades of their lives to public service and to the safety of Manhattan. I am grateful to them, as well as to the NYPD for their hard work and commitment on not only this matter, but for all they do on behalf of New Yorkers. I also want to thank Judge Wiley for presiding over this case. Finally, I want to thank the members of the jury who took time out of their lives to diligently evaluate the evidence.\" Mayor Eric Adams was asked by reporters if he thinks the verdict says anything about the mood of the city, and if he feels like it could open the door for more of these interactions of people exacting their own justice. \"Good question. And I'll answer the latter first. Of what you see, of what people often do, a lot of people make interpretations, you know, about trials, but juries are in the courtroom. They're hearing every piece of evidence, they are hearing the testimonies. They have to make the decision. And that's the system that we have,\" he replied. \"And actually, it is probably one of the best systems on the globe. And I think the jury's heard the evidence and made a determination based on the evidence that they heard. And the ... does it impact what's going to happen throughout the city that people are not going to take action or going to take action? I don't think it does. \"I think that oftentimes people make these decisions when they are in the midst of it. And there's a desire of New Yorkers to help out those who are in need. There's a desire of New Yorkers is to always respond when they believe it's necessary. And I don't think that is going to change in any way. This is not the first time, and I'm sure it's not going to be the last time that individuals take actions and people are going to question about those actions that happened. \"But at the cornerstone and at the heart of this is that, of this young man, like so many others that are on our subway systems, I made it clear that's not a place to sleep, to live. That's not a place to be. And when they need help, we need to give them the help of that they have.\" In order to be convicted of manslaughter, prosecutors had to prove: In order to be convicted of criminally negligent homicide, prosecutors had to prove: Police and witnesses said Neely, 30, boarded an F train in SoHo on May 1, 2023 and began shouting, throwing things and making threats. Penny, a passenger on the train, approached Neely from behind and tried to restrain him. Video shows Penny holding Neely in a chokehold on the floor of the train for several minutes until Neely stopped moving. After police arrived, officers administered Narcan to Neely, performed CPR and used an AED, but were unable to revive him. Neely was pronounced dead at the scene. Police said Neely did not have any weapons on him. A medical examiner ruled Neely's death a homicide three days later, with the cause as compression of the neck. Toxicology reports showed Neely had synthetic marijuana in his system when he died. Neely was a street performer and Michael Jackson impersonator who was experiencing homelessness and had struggled with mental illness after his mother was murdered in 2007. Video of Penny holding Neely in the chokehold was widely circulated online. Neely's death sparked protests across New York City, with many raising concerns about the need for better mental health care in the city, and Neely's family called for Penny's arrest. Penny turned himself in on May 12, 2023, and was initially charged with second-degree manslaughter and released on $100,000 bail. He was arraigned in June and pleaded not guilty to criminally negligent homicide and second-degree manslaughter. Penny defended his actions, saying he was trying to protect other passengers on the train by restraining Neely. In late October 2024, a 12-person jury and four alternates were selected and sworn in. They included seven women and five men, with at least seven White people, one Hispanic person, one Filipino person, one Black person and one person of Middle Eastern descent. The trial began Nov. 1. The prosecution argued in their opening statements that Penny, though he had good intentions, recklessly used excessive force without trying any other means of deescalating the situation. The defense, meanwhile, argued Penny was protecting other passengers and there was no other way to deescalate due to Neely's behavior. Jurors heard testimony from multiple witnesses, including police officers, MTA employees, passengers on the train and a bystander who helped Penny restrain Neely. Penny's Marine Corps martial arts instructor and the medical examiner who performed Neely's autopsy also took the stand. The defense called Penny's mother and platoon sergeants as character witnesses, along with a forensic pathologist who said he disagreed with the medical examiner's cause of death. Jurors began their deliberations last Tuesday. They sent two notes back to the judge. The first requested a readback of part of the judge's instructions. The second note asked the judge if they could return for deliberations Wednesday, which is a day they would normally have had off. The judge approved that request. Wednesday morning, jurors sent another note, asking to see a video compilation of police bodycams from the incident, as well as footage of Penny's police station interview. Jurors also asked for readback of the medical examiner's cross-examination. Friday morning, on the fourth day of deliberations, they sent a note to the judge indicating they couldn't reach a unanimous verdict on his manslaughter charge.

                "title": "Daniel Penny found not guilty in NY subway chokehold death of Jordan Neely",
                "content": "A 26-year-old man has been acquitted of homicide for putting an unarmed homeless man in a fatal chokehold, a case that sparked weeks of protests and reignited debates over public safety, mental illness and race. Jurors deliberated for five days before declaring Daniel Penny not guilty beyond a reasonable doubt in the death of 30-year-old Jordan Neely on a New York City subway train on 1 May 2023. The verdict comes after prosecutors agreed to drop a more serious charge of second-degree manslaughter on Friday, as jurors could not reach an agreement. The move allowed the jurors to move on to consider the second lesser charge of criminally negligent homicide. The verdict, announced on Monday, was met with loud applause in the Manhattan court. Mr Penny - who served four years in the Marines before studying architecture - appeared to smile while his attorneys hugged. \"We couldn't be more pleased that a jury of Danny's peers acquitted him of any wrongdoing,\" his lawyers said in a statement afterwards. \"New Yorkers can take some comfort in knowing that we can continue to stand up for one another without sacrificing our rights or our freedoms.\" Mr Neely's father, Andre Zachery, was removed from court for shouting after the verdict. Chants of \"no justice, no peace\" could be heard echoing outside. \"It hurts. It really, really hurts,\" Mr Zachery said outside court. \"What's gonna happen to us now? I've had enough of this.\" Mr Neely’s death sparked protests across the city and reignited debates over public transportation safety and how the city cares for those struggling with mental health issues and homelessness. Some also highlighted the issue of race - Mr Neely was black; Mr Penny is white. \"Jordan Neely was murdered,\" New York congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, a left-wing Democrat, wrote on X at the time of his death, adding, \"he was houseless and crying for food in a time when the city is raising rents and stripping services\". But many conservatives defended Mr Penny's actions, saying he had stepped in to keep the public safe. On Monday, following the verdict, Vice-President-elect JD Vance wrote on X that \"it was a scandal Penny was ever prosecuted in the first place\". \"Thank God justice was done in this case,\" he said. Last spring, witnesses said that Mr Neely - who suffered from severe mental illnesses - began shouting at other subway passengers, asking for money and screaming that he was hungry and wanted to go back to jail. One woman on the train said that Mr Neely made lunging movements that scared her enough to shield her young child from him. Prosecutors said Mr Penny placed Mr Neely in a chokehold for six minutes, compressing his neck even after he stopped moving. They argued that Mr Penny had acted \"recklessly\" by restraining Mr Neely for several minutes even after he lost consciousness. \"He's dying,\" said an unseen bystander in one passenger's video. \"Let him go!\" Mr Penny's legal team argued that he only stepped in after Mr Neely began threatening passengers. They also cited testimony from a forensic pathologist who said Mr Neely could have died from other contributing factors. A medical examiner ruled Mr Neely's cause of death as compression to the neck. Mr Neely was a Michael Jackson impersonator who performed in Times Square. He had dozens of previous arrests on charges such as evading fares, theft and assaults on three women. Family members say his mental health issues began more than 15 years earlier, when his mother was strangled to death and stuffed in a suitcase by her boyfriend. In a statement released on Monday afternoon, Neely family attorney Donte Mills said they were \"devastated\". \"Everyone matters. Even if you're homeless, have mental health issues, have an addiction - you matter,\" Mr Mills said. \"This verdict says otherwise. Daniel Penny got away with murder.\" The manslaughter charge against Mr Penny would have carried a 15-year maximum sentence, while the negligent homicide charge would have carried a four-year-maximum. A customer at the fast-food outlet thought his friends were kidding when they pointed out the likeness between a patron and the shooting suspect. The Franklin brush fire has burned hundreds of acres in an upmarket area of the US state of California. The blaze has burned more than 300 acres with a \"rapid rate of spread\", say authorities. The 26-year-old was taken into custody at a McDonald's in Pennsylvania, in connection to the killing of United Health CEO Brian Thompson. The court says Murdoch acted in \"bad faith\" by trying to give control of his empire to his eldest son. Copyright 2024 BBC. All rights reserved.

        "Joe Burrow": [
            {
                "title": "Joe Burrow - Wikipedia",
                "content": "Joseph Lee Burrow (born December 10, 1996) is an American professional football quarterback for the Cincinnati Bengals of the National Football League (NFL). After beginning his college football career with the Ohio State Buckeyes, Burrow played for the LSU Tigers, winning the Heisman Trophy and the College Football Playoff National Championship as a senior. He was selected by the Bengals first overall in the 2020 NFL draft. Burrow had a breakout season in 2021 when he led the Bengals to their first playoff win since 1990, ending the longest active drought in the four major North American sports, and an appearance in Super Bowl LVI. The following year, he led the Bengals to their first consecutive division title in franchise history. Burrow has been nicknamed \"Joe Cool\" and \"Joe Brrr\" by sportswriters and other players for his calmness under pressure. Ahead of the 2023 season, Burrow signed an extension with the Bengals, with the contract being the largest in NFL history in terms of annual salary at the time of the signing. Burrow was born in Ames, Iowa, on December 10, 1996,[2][3][4] the son of Robin and Jim Burrow. Jim is a former football player and coach whose career lasted over 40 years.[5] Burrow was born in Ames when his father was on the coaching staff at Iowa State University.[6] According to a 2019 Sports Illustrated story, \"The Burrow athletic lineage dates back nearly a century.\" In the 1940s, his paternal grandmother set a Mississippi state high school record with an 82-point game in basketball.[7][8] His paternal grandfather played basketball at Mississippi State; his uncle, John Burrow, played football at Ole Miss (the University of Mississippi); and two older brothers also played football at Nebraska.[9] He attended the 2002 Rose Bowl at age five, because his father was an assistant coach for the University of Nebraska in Lincoln. Not long after, he began playing in youth football leagues. Unlike his father, uncle, and brothers, who all played on defense, Burrow started out as a quarterback, because his first youth team had no one else who could play the position.[9] The Burrow family moved to North Dakota in 2003 when his father was hired as the defensive coordinator at North Dakota State University in Fargo. One day, while Jim was visiting his office, future Central Michigan head coach Dan Enos commented that the seven-year-old Joe had a future in football.[10] The Burrows spent two years in Fargo before Jim accepted the defensive coordinator position at Ohio University in Athens.[11] Burrow attended Athens High School (2011–14) in The Plains, Ohio, leading the school to three straight playoff appearances and the school's first seven playoff victories in school history.[12] During his career, he passed for 11,416 yards with 157 passing touchdowns and rushed for 2,067 yards with 27 rushing touchdowns.[13] He was awarded the state's Mr. Football Award and Gatorade Player of the Year award as a senior in 2014. He and his Bulldog teammates went 14–1 that season. He was also a standout basketball player, and was named first-team all-state at point guard his senior year.[12] Burrow was rated as a four-star football recruit, and was the eighth-highest ranked dual-threat quarterback in the class of 2015, according to the 247Sports Composite.[14] He committed to Ohio State to play football on May 27, 2014.[15][16] In December 2019, the Athens City School District school board unanimously approved a measure to rename the school's football stadium in honor of Burrow.[17] Burrow's connection with the area remains strong as such that during the 2020 NFL Draft, he wore a T-shirt with the number 740 in reference to the area code for Athens as well as Appalachian Ohio in general.[18] After redshirting his first year at Ohio State in 2015, Burrow spent the next two years as a backup to J. T. Barrett, during which he played in 10 games, completing 29 of 39 passes for 287 yards and two touchdowns.[19] During Ohio State's spring game in 2018, Burrow completed 15 of 22 pass attempts for 238 yards and two touchdowns.[20] The game was further part of Ohio State's competition for the starting quarterback position, contested by Burrow, Barrett, and Dwayne Haskins.[20] Following the game, Burrow told reporters \"I didn't come here to sit on the bench for four years. I know I'm a pretty good quarterback. I want to play somewhere.\"[20] Realizing that Haskins would be named starting quarterback at Ohio State, Burrow transferred to Louisiana State University (LSU) on May 18, 2018.[21][22] Burrow had graduated from Ohio State in three years with a degree in consumer and family financial services, and would be immediately eligible as a graduate transfer.[23] In his first year at LSU, Burrow was named the starting quarterback as a redshirt junior in 2018.[23] In an early season road trip to then-No. 7 Auburn, Burrow threw for 249 yards and a touchdown en route to a 22–21 win. He was named the Southeastern Conference (SEC) Offensive Player of the Week following the victory.[24] He again earned SEC Offensive Player of the Week honors following a 292-yard, three-touchdown performance against Ole Miss two weeks later.[25] Burrow played in LSU's 7-overtime and 5-hour long loss to Texas A&M.[26] After the game, Burrow experienced fatigue and had to be receive IV therapy from trainers.[26] Burrow helped lead the Tigers to a 10–3 record, including a win over UCF in the Fiesta Bowl, and a No. 6 ranking in the final AP Poll.[27][28] Burrow finished the season with 2,894 yards passing, 16 touchdowns, and five interceptions. He added 399 rushing yards and seven rushing touchdowns.[29] Burrow was again named LSU's starting quarterback heading into his redshirt senior season in 2019. In the Tigers' season opener against Georgia Southern, Burrow threw for 278 yards and five touchdowns in a 55–3 win, and was later named SEC Co-Offensive Player of the Week (with Tua Tagovailoa).[30] In a Week 2 road trip to ninth-ranked Texas, Burrow threw for 471 yards, four touchdowns, and an interception in a 45–38 win. His 471 yards were the second-most in school history and the most since Rohan Davey's 528 against Alabama in 2001.[31] He was named Walter Camp National Offensive Player of the Week and SEC Offensive Player of the Week following the performance.[32] Burrow earned his third SEC Offensive Player of the Week honors on September 21 during LSU's game against Vanderbilt. He threw for 398 yards and a school-record six passing touchdowns in the Tigers' 66–38 win.[33] He became the first LSU quarterback to throw for over 350 yards in three consecutive games.[34] In a 42–6 win over Utah State, Burrow threw for 344 yards and five touchdowns, and became the first Tiger quarterback to throw for 300-plus yards in four consecutive games.[35] The streak came to an end the next week against seventh-ranked Florida, but Burrow's 293 yards and three touchdown passes helped lead the Tigers to another win, 42–28.[36] The next week, in LSU's seventh game of the season, Burrow eclipsed the LSU single-season passing touchdowns record of 28 when he added four more in a win against Mississippi State.[37] In their next game, Burrow led LSU against ninth-ranked Auburn and LSU defeated another top 10 opponent, as Burrow's 321-yard, two-total-touchdowns performance set a new school record of eight career 300-yard games.[38] When LSU played Alabama on November 9, the two schools were ranked higher than they had been since they had played in the 2012 BCS National Championship Game; LSU was ranked second and Alabama third when the season's inaugural College Football Playoff rankings had been released the prior week. The game also featured two leading candidates for the Heisman Trophy in Burrow and Alabama quarterback Tua Tagovailoa.[39] Burrow and the Tigers came away victorious in a 46–41 shootout. Burrow passed for 393 yards and three touchdowns in the game,[40] and was again named Walter Camp National Offensive Player of the Week and SEC Co-Offensive Player of the Week, sharing the latter with teammate Clyde Edwards-Helaire.[41] The following week against Ole Miss, Burrow threw for 489 yards and five touchdown passes, and his single-season passing yards surpassed the LSU record set by Rohan Davey in 2001. Burrow also set an LSU record for consecutive completed passes with 17 during the game.[42] On November 30, Burrow and LSU secured an undefeated regular season with a 50–7 win over Texas A&M, in which Burrow threw for 352 yards and three touchdowns. During the game, he broke the SEC record for single-season passing yards – previously set by Kentucky's Tim Couch – and tied the conference record for single-season touchdowns (which had been set by Missouri's Drew Lock).[43] Burrow took sole possession of the SEC single-season touchdown record the following week in the SEC Championship Game, throwing for four touchdowns in LSU's 37–10 win over Georgia that secured the Tigers' place in the College Football Playoff.[44] On December 14, 2019, Burrow was awarded the 2019 Heisman Trophy, receiving 1,846 more votes than runner-up Jalen Hurts.[45] It was the largest victory margin in the history of the award, with Burrow receiving the highest-ever share of available points.[46] Burrow's Heisman acceptance speech referred to the rampant poverty and food insecurity affecting his hometown; shortly after his speech, the Athens County food bank was the recipient of $450,000 in donations.[47] Burrow received many other awards during college football award season, including SEC Offensive Player of the Year,[48] AP Player of the Year,[49] Maxwell Award,[50] Walter Camp Award,[51] Johnny Unitas Golden Arm Award,[52] Davey O'Brien Award,[53] Lombardi Award,[54] and Manning Award.[55] He was named as a Consensus All-American.[56] In LSU's College Football Playoff semifinal game against fourth-ranked Oklahoma in the 2019 Peach Bowl, Burrow threw for seven touchdowns during the first half of the contest and had a total of 493 passing yards – along with scoring a rushing touchdown – in a 63–28 victory for the Tigers.[57] Burrow's eight total touchdowns were all scored within the first 35 minutes[58] of the 60-minute game, after which the quarterback was taken out for the sake of giving him rest.[59] Analysts have called the performance one of the greatest in college football history.[60][61] In the 2020 National Championship Game against Clemson, Burrow threw for 463 yards with six total touchdowns, five of which were passing, which led LSU to a 42–25 victory and him being named the game's offensive MVP.[62] He finished his 2019 season with 60 passing touchdowns, which broke the single-season FBS record previously set by Colt Brennan's 58 in 2006.[62][n 2] Burrow also set a FBS single-season record with 65 total touchdowns (which would be tied by Bailey Zappe in 2021).[64][63] His 5,671 passing yards is now tied (with Case Keenum in 2009) for fourth-most in an FBS season.[62] His passer rating of 202 for the season was a record at the time.[62][65] Several sportswriters deemed the season to be the greatest ever by a college quarterback.[66][67][68][69] Burrow was one of 58 players invited to the 2020 NFL draft, where he was selected first overall by the Cincinnati Bengals.[72][73] He was the third-consecutive Heisman-winning quarterback to be selected first overall, following Baker Mayfield and Kyler Murray.[74] Burrow signed his four-year rookie contract, worth $36.1 million, on July 31, 2020.[75] Prior to the season, Burrow was considered the favorite to win the NFL Offensive Rookie of the Year award.[76][77][78] Burrow was the only rookie quarterback from his draft class to start on opening week.[79] In his debut, Burrow threw for 193 passing yards and an interception, while adding 46 rushing yards and a rushing touchdown in a 16–13 loss against the Los Angeles Chargers.[80] During the next game against the Cleveland Browns, Burrow threw his first career passing touchdown, a 23-yard pass to tight end C. J. Uzomah. Although the Bengals lost the game, 35–30, he attempted 61 passes, completing 37 of them for 316 yards and three touchdowns, which broke the NFL record for most completions by a rookie quarterback in a single game.[81][82] Two weeks later, Burrow earned his first career win by defeating the Jacksonville Jaguars. He also became the first rookie quarterback to throw for 300 or more yards in three straight games.[83] In a Week 7 game against the Browns, Burrow had 406 passing yards, three passing touchdowns, one rushing touchdown, and one interception in a 37–34 loss.[84] He became the first rookie in NFL history with at least 400 passing yards, three passing touchdowns, and a rushing touchdown in a single game,[85] and had completed more passes (221) than any other player in NFL history during their first eight games.[86] In the second half of a Week 11 game against the Washington Football Team, Burrow was hit low while throwing a pass and subsequently tore his ACL and MCL in his left knee, among other damage to his PCL and meniscus.[87][88] He was later placed on injured reserve, ending his rookie season.[89] Undergoing knee surgery in December, Burrow continued to review game film despite being out for the season.[90] On September 6, the Bengals confirmed Burrow had completed his rehab and would be the starter for Week 1.[91] Burrow returned from his injury and helped lead the Bengals to a 2–1 start. In Week 4, Burrow completed 25 of 32 passes for 348 yards and two touchdowns in a 24–21 win over the Jaguars, earning AFC Offensive Player of the Week.[92] Against the Baltimore Ravens in Week 16, Burrow completed 37 of 46 passes, threw for a career-high 525 yards, while also throwing four touchdowns without an interception, for a career-high 143.2 passer rating in the 41–21 win. Burrow's 525 yards were the fourth most passing yards in a game in NFL history, and broke Boomer Esiason's franchise record for most passing yards in a game as a result.[93] The victory in this game was Cincinnati's ninth of the year, clinching the first winning record for the team since the 2015 season, and put the Bengals in first place of the AFC North. Burrow was named AFC Offensive Player of the Week as a result of his performance.[94] The next week against the Kansas City Chiefs, Burrow threw for 446 yards, four touchdowns, and no interceptions in the 34–31 win. The win helped the Bengals clinch the AFC North and a playoff berth for the first time since 2015.[95] Burrow finished the season playing in 16 games with 4,611 passing yards and 34 passing touchdowns, both franchise records.[96] He also led the league in completion percentage (70.4%) and yards per pass attempt (8.9), but also led the league in sacks taken.[97] He was named Comeback Player of the Year by the Associated Press and the PFWA.[98][99] In his playoff debut, Burrow threw for 244 yards and two touchdowns in the 26–19 win against the Las Vegas Raiders in the Wild Card Round, ending the Bengals' playoff win drought that had been active since the 1990 season.[100] During the Divisional Round against the top-seeded Tennessee Titans, Burrow threw for 348 yards and an interception in the 19–16 win, which was the first time in franchise history the Bengals won a playoff game on the road.[101] The victory occurred despite Burrow being sacked nine times, tying Warren Moon in 1993 for the most times sacked in a playoff game and becoming the most-sacked quarterback to win a playoff game.[102] In the AFC Championship Game against the Chiefs, Burrow threw for 250 yards, two touchdowns, an interception, and helped the Bengals overcome a 21–3 deficit to win 27–24 in overtime. The 18-point comeback was tied with the Indianapolis Colts in 2006 for the largest in a conference championship.[103] With the victory, the Bengals reached Super Bowl LVI, their first appearance since Super Bowl XXIII in 1988.[104] In the Super Bowl, Burrow threw for 263 yards and a touchdown, but was sacked 7 times, ultimately losing to the Los Angeles Rams 23–20.[105] Burrow set a playoff record for most times sacked in a single postseason, being sacked 19 times, surpassing the previous record set by Wade Wilson in 1987, with 14.[106] He was ranked 21st by his fellow players on the NFL Top 100 Players of 2022.[107] Burrow underwent emergency surgery to remove his appendix on July 26, 2022 as a result of severe appendicitis.[108] In Week 1 against the Pittsburgh Steelers, Burrow committed a career-high five turnovers, which included losing a fumble and throwing four interceptions, along with being sacked seven times in the 23–20 overtime loss.[109] Burrow returned to the state of Louisiana in Week 6 against the New Orleans Saints, returning to the Caesars Superdome for the first time since winning the College National Championship. Burrow threw for 300 yards and three touchdowns in the 30–26 victory, two of which to former college teammate Ja'Marr Chase.[110] The following week against the Atlanta Falcons, Burrow finished the game throwing for 481 yards in the 35–17 win.[111] The game was Burrow's fifth game with over 400 passing yards, setting an NFL record for the most 400-yard games in a player's first three seasons. It was also his second game with over 500 yards of offense and four touchdowns, making him the first player to accomplish this multiple times.[112] Burrow was named AFC Offensive Player of the Week as a result of his performance.[113] In Week 13, Burrow threw for 286 yards and two touchdowns, along with 46 rushing yards and a touchdown in a 27–24 win over the Chiefs, earning AFC Offensive Player of the Week.[114] On December 21, Burrow was selected to the Pro Bowl for the first time in his career.[115] In their Week 15 matchup against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, the Bengals found themselves down 17–3 at halftime. Burrow orchestrated a remarkable comeback in the second half, leading the team to 31 unanswered points and throwing four touchdown passes to four different receivers to lead the team to a 34–23 win.[116] The next week, Burrow threw for 375 yards and three touchdowns in a 22–18 win over the New England Patriots, earning his third AFC Offensive Player of the Week honor of the season.[117] The Bengals' Week 17 game against the Buffalo Bills was declared a no contest due to Bills' safety Damar Hamlin suffering cardiac arrest in-game. This resulted in the Bengals being declared AFC North champions ahead of their final week match against Baltimore, marking the first time the franchise won consecutive division titles.[118] He finished the season ranked fifth in the NFL in both completions (414) and passing yards (4,475), while his franchise record 35 touchdown passes ranked in 2nd.[119][120] Meanwhile, the Bengals finished 12–4 on the season, their best record since 2015, and won their last eight games consecutively.[121] In the 2022–23 NFL playoffs, Burrow led the Bengals to a narrow win over the Ravens in the Wild Card Round and a decisive victory over the Bills in the Divisional Round en route to their second consecutive AFC Championship appearance.[122][123] In a rematch of the previous AFC Championship Game, the Bengals lost to the eventual Super Bowl champion Chiefs 23–20.[124] He was ranked 6th by his fellow players on the NFL Top 100 Players of 2023, his first ever top ten on the list.[107] Ahead of the season, Burrow suffered a right calf strain during training camp.[125] Bengals head coach Zac Taylor initially stated that Burrow was to be sidelined for \"several weeks\",[126] with no clear timeline in place for his return, but later made a bold announcement that he was \"better than he's ever looked,\" implying a more positive than expected recovery.[127] On September 7, 2023, Burrow signed a five-year, $275 million contract extension, surpassing Justin Herbert to become the highest-paid player in NFL history on an annual basis, with an average annual salary of $55 million.[128] In Week 8, Burrow threw for 283 yards and three touchdowns while completing 87.5% of passes in a 31–17 win over the 49ers, earning AFC Offensive Player of the Week honors.[129] During the first half of the game, Burrow reset his career high with 19 consecutive completed passes.[130] On November 16, Burrow suffered a torn Scapholunate ligament in his right wrist in the first half of the Bengals' Week 11 game against the Ravens.[131] The next day, the Bengals announced that Burrow was to miss the remainder of the season.[132] Burrow was placed on the injured reserve on November 25,[133] and soon thereafter underwent surgery.[134] On November 17, 2023, NFL launched an investigation into whether the Bengals were compliant with the injury report policy as the Bengals had posted then deleted a video on X of Burrow wearing what appeared to be a soft cast on his right hand the day before.[135] On December 9, 2023, NFL concluded their investigation and found the Bengals were compliant with the league's injury report policy.[136] Burrow continued to be involved with team activities and supported his teammates, particularly backup quarterback Jake Browning, from the sidelines for all remaining games of the 2023 season.[137][138][139] Burrow fully recovered from his wrist surgery in time for the 2024 season. He and the Bengals opened the season 0–2 for the third consecutive season following losses to the Patriots and Chiefs.[140] They dropped to 0–3 following a loss to the Washington Commanders, despite 324 yards, three passing touchdowns, and zero turnovers from Burrow.[141] Before their Week 4 matchup against the Carolina Panthers, Burrow delivered an uncharacteristic pregame speech. The speech resonated with the team as the Bengals won their first game of the season, with Burrow passing for 232 yards and two touchdowns, both of which came in the first half.[142] In Week 5, Burrow threw for 353 yards and a career-high five touchdown passes in a 41–38 overtime loss to the Baltimore Ravens.[143] Sitting at 1–4, Burrow led victories over the New York Giants and Cleveland Browns, including a career-long 47-yard touchdown run against the Giants and two second half touchdowns against the Browns.[144][145] In Week 9, Burrow threw for 251 yards, a career-high-tying five touchdown passes and one interception in a 41–24 win over the Las Vegas Raiders.[146] After beating the Raiders, Burrow threw for 428 yards and four touchdowns against the Ravens, followed by a 356-yard, three-touchdown performance against the Chargers. Despite his efforts, the Bengals lost both games, making Burrow the first player to throw for over 300 yards with at least three touchdowns and no interceptions in consecutive games and lose both in regulation.[147] \"Burrow is considered a relatively quiet, occasionally quirky guy. But he's beloved in the LSU locker room, largely because he plays with a competitiveness that borders on fanatical.\" At the NFL combine, Burrow was measured to be 6 ft 3 in and 221 lbs; his hands were measured to be 9 inches.[71] In 2021, Sports Illustrated writer Mike Santagata wrote that Burrow is \"bigger than he looks at about 230 pounds,\" while also noting his athleticism and strength.[149] Through his junior year at LSU, Burrow \"initial run through the [NFL's] scouting machine resulted in such an underwhelming consensus\".[148] Many scouts viewed Burrow as an \"NFL draft afterthought\", and considered him \"a late-round project and potential backup.\"[148] He was seen as having limited physical traits and average production prior to his senior season.[148] SEC analyst Jordan Rodgers opined that Burrow was \"wildly inconsistent, and frankly very poor against good competition\" in 2018.[150] Burrow's 2019 season was cited as helping draw more attention to scouts to reconsider their evaluation of him,[148] and his football IQ, accuracy, pocket mobility, and playmaking outside of the pocket have all been cited as strengths of his game.[151] The Bengals caught attention of these traits in 2019, making Burrow a top pick in the 2020 NFL draft.[149][151] Burrow's football IQ has often been cited by writers, coaches, coordinators, and other players as a critical aspect of Burrow's game. He has been analyzed as being capable of processing opposing defenses quickly.[149] Burrow participated in game plan meetings during his tenure at LSU to discuss the next opponent, where he pitched game plan ideas with LSU passing game coordinator Joe Brady and offensive coordinator Steve Ensminger.[150] The two coaches also trusted Burrow with presnap play calls and Burrow was noted by Sports Illustrated for his tendency to \"often change receiver routes based on defensive formations.\"[150] College GameDay analyst Kirk Herbstreit likened Burrow to a \"co-offensive coordinator\", stating \"That's the NFL model, when you have a quarterback able to invest and communicate at that level. [Burrow] is the cutting edge of that mold. When I watch LSU, it's not just Joe Brady's offense—it's Joe Brady and Joe Burrow's offense.\"[150] As a Bengal, Burrow was noted to have successfully called his own plays during the 2021 Divisional Round game against Tennessee.[152] Burrow plays chess in his spare time, as well as during game preparation. He keeps a chessboard in his locker.[153] Prior to Super Bowl LVI, Burrow played ten matches of online chess.[154] Bengals cornerback Chidobe Awuzie, who plays chess with Burrow, commented \"The fact that he plays chess lets you know that he's able to prioritize certain things and articulate things very fast and have formation recognition.\"[153] Sportswriters have praised Burrow's accuracy, calling his ball placement elite.[149] Bengals offensive coordinator Brian Callahan has stated that Burrow has \"an uncanny ability to place the ball accurately on the move anywhere on the field.\"[151] Charlie Goldsmith of The Cincinnati Enquirer wrote that Burrow possess elite traits in regards to his \"combination of picking up the blitz and his accuracy outside the pocket\".[151] Burrow's pocket management, particularly his movement and footwork within the pocket to help him avoid sacks, has been noted by sportswriters.[149] The Athletic wrote positively of Burrow's \"ability to work a broken pocket,\" stating that Burrow evades defenders and is able to both find space to deliver a throw or run with the ball himself.[155] Intangibles such as dedication, work ethic, and leadership also contributed to the Bengals' decision to pick him first overall.[90] Former New England Patriots running back Kevin Faulk compared Burrow to Tom Brady, noting the former's poise and competitiveness.[150] Once in the NFL, Burrow drew further comparisons to Brady from Chiefs defensive coordinator Steve Spagnuolo.[156] Burrow's leadership has also been noted by teammates and opponents alike; veteran Mike Daniels spoke on Burrow being voted a team captain as a rookie, stating that Burrow earned the respect of his veteran teammates before even playing.[157] Kansas City Chiefs quarterback Patrick Mahomes has stated \"Not only is he a great football player, I think he's a great leader. He has that special knack where he can lead anybody.\"[156] Mahomes and Baltimore Ravens linebacker Patrick Queen have also noted Burrow's \"swag\" or \"swagger\".[156][158] Indeed, Burrow has been noted by writers for his \"cool\" demeanor both on and off the field.[159][160] ProFootballTalk writer Peter King wrote that \"Burrow's steely mentality and his right arm are putting him on the path to greatness. I wouldn't bet against him.\"[161] Burrow's attitude has been attributed as a factor in his ability to remain calm under pressure in-game, earning him the \"Joe Cool\" and \"Joe Brrr\" nicknames.[162][163][164] Burrow spent one summer during college interning at Goldman Sachs.[26] After signing his rookie contract with the Bengals, Burrow stated that he planned to save all of his contract money and instead live through income received from endorsements.[173] Burrow is a fan of the Super Smash Bros. video game series.[174] In a 2023 interview, Burrow stated that he usually plays Super Smash Bros. Ultimate on flights to road games with his teammates, and that he frequently plays as Ness from Earthbound.[175] Burrow is an avid fan of Kid Cudi, often listening to his music prior to Bengals games.[176] In February 2022, Burrow appeared on-stage with Cudi during a Super Bowl afterparty.[177] Later in the year, Cudi included a bonus track named after Burrow on his Entergalactic album.[178] In January 2023, Burrow was among a coalition of about a dozen athletes, including Blake Griffin and Kevin Gausman, who purchased a 104-acre north Iowa farm with plans to further acquire a diverse set of agricultural assets.[179] In the wake of the Roe v. Wade being overturned in June 2022, Burrow spoke out on Instagram in favor of abortion rights in the United States.[180] Following the Uvalde elementary school shooting, Burrow expressed his support for stricter gun control reforms during a press conference.[181]",

                "content": "Joseph Lee Burrow (born December 10, 1996) is an American quarterback who plays for the NFL's Cincinnati Bengals. He started his college career as a backup quarterback for the Ohio State Buckeyes, before transferring to Louisiana State University (LSU). During his senior year at LSU, he passed for over 5,600 yards and 60 touchdowns, and was awarded the Heisman Trophy. He also led the Tigers to an undefeated season and College Football National Championship. After college, he was drafted first overall by the Bengals in 2020. He led the Bengals to an appearance in Super Bowl LVI. Joseph Lee Burrow was born in Ames, Iowa on December 10, 1996,[1][2][3] the son of Robin and Jim Burrow. Jim is a former football player and coach whose career lasted over 40 years.[4] Burrow was born in Ames when his father was on the staff for the Iowa State Cyclones.[5] Joe's family is notably involved in sports. According to a 2019 Sports Illustrated story, \"the Burrow athletic lineage dates back nearly a century.\"[6] From 2011–2014, Burrow attended Athens High School in The Plains, Ohio, leading the school to three straight playoff appearances and the school's first seven playoff victories in school history.[7] During his high school career, he passed for 11,416 yards and 157 touchdowns, while also rushing for 2,067 yards with 27 rushing touchdowns.[8] He was awarded the state's Mr. Football Award and Gatorade Player of the Year award as a senior in 2014. He and his Bulldog teammates went 14–1 that season. During high school, Burrow also played basketball at a high level and was named first-team all-state at point guard his senior year.[7] Burrow was rated as a four-star football recruit, and was the eighth-highest ranked dual-threat quarterback in the class of 2015 according to the 247SportsmComposite.[9] On May 27, 2014, he committed to Ohio State University to play football for the Buckeyes.[10][11] Joe Burrow played college football at Ohio State University for the Buckeyes. He was a redshirt freshman in 2015, meaning he did not play his first year of college. He was then a backup to J. T. Barrett for the next two years. During that time, he played in 10 games, completing 29-of-39 pass attempts for 287 yards and two touchdowns.[12] Dwayne Haskins was then named the starting quarterback for the Buckeyes. Because of this, Burrow decided to transfer to Louisiana State University (LSU) to play for the Tigers.[13][14] Burrow graduated from Ohio State in three years with a degree in consumer and family financial services, and would be immediately eligible as a graduate transfer.[15] In his first year as a Tiger, in 2018, Burrow was named the starter as a redshirt junior. He earned 2 SEC Player of the Week honors during the season.[16] The Tigers finished the season with a 10–3 record. Burrow has 2,894 passing yards and 16 passing touchdowns to 5 interceptions. While rushing the football, Burrow had 399 yards and 7 touchdowns. The following season, Burrow had what many sportswriters and football experts described as the best season by a college quarterback.[17][18][19][20] In a blowout win against Texas A&M, Burrow set the single-season Southeastern Conference (SEC) record in passing yards and tied the single-season record for passing touchdowns.[21] The following week, Burrow led the Tigers to a 37–10 win in the SEC Championship Game against the Georgia Bulldogs, securing the Tigers' place in the College Football Playoff.[22] He was named the game's Most Valuable Player (MVP) and during the win, Burrow set the single-season SEC record for passing touchdowns.[22] Later, on December 14, 2019, Burrow was awarded the 2019 Heisman Trophy, winning the award by a record-margin of votes.[23] In the playoff semifinal game at the 2019 Peach Bowl, Burrow led the Tigers to a 63–28 win over the fourth-ranked Oklahoma Sooners.[24] In the win, Burrow completed 29-of-39 pass attempts for 493 passing yards and seven passing touchdowns, to go along with five rushes for 22 rushing yards and a rushing touchdown.[24] Burrow's eight total touchdowns were an FBS bowl game record and SEC single game record, and were recorded in just over one half of play before Burrow was rested.[25] Analysts have called Burrow's performance one of the greatest in college football history.[26][27] In the 2020 College Football Playoff National Championship Game against Clemson, Burrow threw for 463 yards and five passing touchdowns. Burrow also ran for a touchdown in the game and was named the game's offensive MVP, as he led LSU to a 42–25 victory.[28] With the win, LSU finished with an undefeated 15–0 season. He finished his 2019 season with 60 passing touchdowns, which set the single-season NCAA Division I Football Bowl Subdivision (FBS) record.[28] Burrow's record has since been passed by Bailey Zappe of Western Kentucky, who threw for 62 touchdowns in 2021.[29] Burrow also set a new FBS single-season record in combined passing and rushing touchdowns, with 65.[30] Zappe tied this record in 2021.[29] Burrow also finished the year with 5,671 passing yards, which is tied for fourth all-time in an FBS season.[28] His passer rating of 202 for the season was also a record until it was passed by Mac Jones in 2020.[28][31] After his first year at LSU, Burrow was not expected to be a first-round NFL Draft pick.[32] However, after his senior season, Burrow became the heavy favorite to be picked first overall.[33] A Draft Network analysis of Burrow's skill set before the draft complimented Burrow for his \"elite football intelligence,\" but stated Burrow doesn't have \"elite arm strength and throwing power.\" Their final evaluation stated: Coming off the greatest season in SEC quarterback history, Joe Burrow features a high-level skill set with the makeup of being a dynamic franchise quarterback. His blend of accuracy, ability to handle pressure, mechanics and mental processing skills are all bluechip traits that make him NFL ready in Year One. Burrow may lack elite throwing power, but it's a minor knock in an overall impressive package.[3] The Cincinnati Bengals would indeed draft Burrow first overall in the 2020 NFL Draft.[32] Burrow signed his four-year rookie contract, worth $36.1 million, on July 31, 2020.[34] During the off-season and the preseason, Burrow was thought to be the favorite to win the NFL Offensive Rookie of the Year award.[35][36][37] Burrow was the only rookie quarterback from his draft class to start in the first week of the 2020 season.[38] In his first game, Burrow threw for 193 passing yards and an interception, and rushed for 46 yards and a touchdown in a 16–13 loss against the Los Angeles Chargers.[39] In their next game, the Bengals went against the Cleveland Browns. In the game, Burrow threw his first career passing touchdown, a 23-yard pass to tight end C. J. Uzomah. The Bengals lost the game 35–30, but Burrow set an NFL rookie record for pass completions, with 37.[40][41] In Week 4 of the season, Burrow earned his first career win as he led the Bengals over the Jacksonville Jaguars. It was also his third straight game throwing for 300 or more passing yards, making him the first rookie quarterback to do so.[42] In the second half of a Week 11 game against the Washington Football Team, Burrow was hit while throwing a pass. This caused tears to his ACL and MCL in his left knee, among other damage to his PCL and meniscus.[43][44] He was later placed on injured reserve, ending his rookie season.[45] Even while injured, Burrow was noted to continue preparing for games by watching game film.[46] He finished his rookie season with a 2–7–1 record as a starter, 2,688 passing yards, and 13 passing touchdowns to 5 interceptions.[47] He also rushed for 142 yards and 3 touchdowns during the season. In Week 4, Burrow completed 25-of-32 passes for 348 yards and two touchdowns in a 24–21 win over the Jaguars. His performance earned him AFC Offensive Player of the Week.[48] Against the division rival Baltimore Ravens in Week 16, Burrow completed 37-of-46 passes as he threw for a career-high and franchise record 525 passing yards.[49] Burrow also threw for four touchdowns and finished the game with a career-high 143.2 passer rating, as his strong performance in the game helped the Bengals win 41–21.[49] During the season, Burrow's play was noted by football coaches and sportswriters as being impressive and having improved greatly.[50][51][52] In December 2021, Charlie Goldsmith of The Cincinnati Enquirer wrote: The best areas of Burrow's game in college are becoming his standout traits in the NFL. In 2019, Burrow impressed the Bengals with his competitiveness, his football IQ, his accuracy, his ability to move in the pocket and his ability to make plays outside of the pocket. For every quality the coaching staff saw on Burrow's college tape, there's a throw from the last month that highlights it.[50] The Bengals finished the regular season with a 10–7 record. They also finished as the winners of their AFC North Division. Burrow finished the regular season completing a league-leading 70.4% of his passes. He had 366 pass completions on 520 attempts for 4,611 yards. His 8.9 yards per pass attempt also led the league. Burrow threw 34 touchdowns to 14 interceptions and finished with a 108.3 passer rating. He led the Bengals to their first playoff appearance since 2015. In the playoffs, Burrow helped the Bengals defeat the Las Vegas Raiders in the Wild Card Round. This was the Bengals' first playoff win since 1990. The next weekend, Burrow led the Bengals to a road win over the Tennessee Titans in the Divisional Round of the playoffs.[53] This win marked the first road win in Bengals franchise history.[53] In the AFC Championship Game, Burrow and the Bengals beat the Kansas City Chiefs 27–24 in overtime.[54] Burrow helped lead a comeback after the Bengals went down 21–3 in the first half.[55] The Bengals faced the Los Angeles Rams in Super Bowl LVI, losing 20–23.[56] In the Super Bowl, Burrow had 22 pass completions on 33 attempts and threw for 263 yards and 1 touchdown.[56] The Bengals started the 2022 season by losing their first two games. However, Burrow helped the Bengals turn it around as the team won the AFC North again and finished with a 12–4 record.[57] This was the first time the Bengals won their division two years in a row.[58] After throwing for 481 yards and 3 touchdowns against the Atlanta Falcons in Week 7, he was named AFC Offensive Player of the Week.[59] Burrow was also picked for the Pro Bowl.[60] He finished the season passing for 4,475 yards and 35 touchdowns, while also completing 68.3% of his throws.[61] His 35 touchdowns set a new Bengals team record.[62] In the playoffs, Burrow helped the Bengals win over the Ravens and the Buffalo Bills.[63][64] However, the Bengals lost in the AFC Championship game to the Chiefs, 20–23.[65] After signing his rookie contract with the Bengals, Burrow stated that he planned to save all of his contract money and instead live through income received from endorsements.[69] Burrow has been reported to be dating Olivia Holzmacher, who also went to Ohio State.[46][70]",

                "content": "An earthquake – also called a quake, tremor, or temblor – is the shaking of the Earth's surface resulting from a sudden release of energy in the lithosphere that creates seismic waves. Earthquakes can range in intensity, from those so weak they cannot be felt, to those violent enough to propel objects and people into the air, damage critical infrastructure, and wreak destruction across entire cities. The seismic activity of an area is the frequency, type, and size of earthquakes experienced over a particular time. The seismicity at a particular location in the Earth is the average rate of seismic energy release per unit volume. In its most general sense, the word earthquake is used to describe any seismic event that generates seismic waves. Earthquakes can occur naturally or be induced by human activities, such as mining, fracking, and nuclear tests. The initial point of rupture is called the hypocenter or focus, while the ground level directly above it is the epicenter. Earthquakes are primarily caused by geological faults, but also by volcanic activity, landslides, and other seismic events. The frequency, type, and size of earthquakes in an area define its seismic activity, reflecting the average rate of seismic energy release. Significant historical earthquakes include the 1556 Shaanxi earthquake in China, with over 830,000 fatalities, and the 1960 Valdivia earthquake in Chile, the largest ever recorded at 9.5 magnitude. Earthquakes result in various effects, such as ground shaking and soil liquefaction, leading to significant damage and loss of life. When the epicenter of a large earthquake is located offshore, the seabed may be displaced sufficiently to cause a tsunami. Earthquakes can trigger landslides. Earthquakes' occurrence is influenced by tectonic movements along faults, including normal, reverse (thrust), and strike-slip faults, with energy release and rupture dynamics governed by the elastic-rebound theory. Efforts to manage earthquake risks involve prediction, forecasting, and preparedness, including seismic retrofitting and earthquake engineering to design structures that withstand shaking. The cultural impact of earthquakes spans myths, religious beliefs, and modern media, reflecting their profound influence on human societies. Similar seismic phenomena, known as marsquakes and moonquakes, have been observed on other celestial bodies, indicating the universality of such events beyond Earth. An earthquake is the shaking of the surface of Earth resulting from a sudden release of energy in the lithosphere that creates seismic waves. Earthquakes may also be referred to as quakes, tremors, or temblors. The word tremor is also used for non-earthquake seismic rumbling. In its most general sense, an earthquake is any seismic event—whether natural or caused by humans—that generates seismic waves. Earthquakes are caused mostly by the rupture of geological faults but also by other events such as volcanic activity, landslides, mine blasts, fracking and nuclear tests. An earthquake's point of initial rupture is called its hypocenter or focus. The epicenter is the point at ground level directly above the hypocenter. The seismic activity of an area is the frequency, type, and size of earthquakes experienced over a particular time. The seismicity at a particular location in the Earth is the average rate of seismic energy release per unit volume. One of the most devastating earthquakes in recorded history was the 1556 Shaanxi earthquake, which occurred on 23 January 1556 in Shaanxi, China. More than 830,000 people died.[2] Most houses in the area were yaodongs—dwellings carved out of loess hillsides—and many victims were killed when these structures collapsed. The 1976 Tangshan earthquake, which killed between 240,000 and 655,000 people, was the deadliest of the 20th century.[3] The 1960 Chilean earthquake is the largest earthquake that has been measured on a seismograph, reaching 9.5 magnitude on 22 May 1960.[4][5] Its epicenter was near Cañete, Chile. The energy released was approximately twice that of the next most powerful earthquake, the Good Friday earthquake (27 March 1964), which was centered in Prince William Sound, Alaska.[6][7] The ten largest recorded earthquakes have all been megathrust earthquakes; however, of these ten, only the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake is simultaneously one of the deadliest earthquakes in history. Earthquakes that caused the greatest loss of life, while powerful, were deadly because of their proximity to either heavily populated areas or the ocean, where earthquakes often create tsunamis that can devastate communities thousands of kilometers away. Regions most at risk for great loss of life include those where earthquakes are relatively rare but powerful, and poor regions with lax, unenforced, or nonexistent seismic building codes. Tectonic earthquakes occur anywhere on the earth where there is sufficient stored elastic strain energy to drive fracture propagation along a fault plane. The sides of a fault move past each other smoothly and aseismically only if there are no irregularities or asperities along the fault surface that increases the frictional resistance. Most fault surfaces do have such asperities, which leads to a form of stick-slip behavior. Once the fault has locked, continued relative motion between the plates leads to increasing stress and, therefore, stored strain energy in the volume around the fault surface. This continues until the stress has risen sufficiently to break through the asperity, suddenly allowing sliding over the locked portion of the fault, releasing the stored energy.[8] This energy is released as a combination of radiated elastic strain seismic waves,[9] frictional heating of the fault surface, and cracking of the rock, thus causing an earthquake. This process of gradual build-up of strain and stress punctuated by occasional sudden earthquake failure is referred to as the elastic-rebound theory. It is estimated that only 10 percent or less of an earthquake's total energy is radiated as seismic energy. Most of the earthquake's energy is used to power the earthquake fracture growth or is converted into heat generated by friction. Therefore, earthquakes lower the Earth's available elastic potential energy and raise its temperature, though these changes are negligible compared to the conductive and convective flow of heat out from the Earth's deep interior.[10] There are three main types of fault, all of which may cause an interplate earthquake: normal, reverse (thrust), and strike-slip. Normal and reverse faulting are examples of dip-slip, where the displacement along the fault is in the direction of dip and where movement on them involves a vertical component. Many earthquakes are caused by movement on faults that have components of both dip-slip and strike-slip; this is known as oblique slip. The topmost, brittle part of the Earth's crust, and the cool slabs of the tectonic plates that are descending into the hot mantle, are the only parts of our planet that can store elastic energy and release it in fault ruptures. Rocks hotter than about 300 °C (572 °F) flow in response to stress; they do not rupture in earthquakes.[11][12] The maximum observed lengths of ruptures and mapped faults (which may break in a single rupture) are approximately 1,000 km (620 mi). Examples are the earthquakes in Alaska (1957), Chile (1960), and Sumatra (2004), all in subduction zones. The longest earthquake ruptures on strike-slip faults, like the San Andreas Fault (1857, 1906), the North Anatolian Fault in Turkey (1939), and the Denali Fault in Alaska (2002), are about half to one third as long as the lengths along subducting plate margins, and those along normal faults are even shorter. Normal faults occur mainly in areas where the crust is being extended such as a divergent boundary. Earthquakes associated with normal faults are generally less than magnitude 7. Maximum magnitudes along many normal faults are even more limited because many of them are located along spreading centers, as in Iceland, where the thickness of the brittle layer is only about six kilometres (3.7 mi).[13][14] Reverse faults occur in areas where the crust is being shortened such as at a convergent boundary. Reverse faults, particularly those along convergent boundaries, are associated with the most powerful earthquakes (called megathrust earthquakes) including almost all of those of magnitude 8 or more. Megathrust earthquakes are responsible for about 90% of the total seismic moment released worldwide.[15] Strike-slip faults are steep structures where the two sides of the fault slip horizontally past each other; transform boundaries are a particular type of strike-slip fault. Strike-slip faults, particularly continental transforms, can produce major earthquakes up to about magnitude 8. Strike-slip faults tend to be oriented near vertically, resulting in an approximate width of 10 km (6.2 mi) within the brittle crust.[16] Thus, earthquakes with magnitudes much larger than 8 are not possible. In addition, there exists a hierarchy of stress levels in the three fault types. Thrust faults are generated by the highest, strike-slip by intermediate, and normal faults by the lowest stress levels.[17] This can easily be understood by considering the direction of the greatest principal stress, the direction of the force that \"pushes\" the rock mass during the faulting. In the case of normal faults, the rock mass is pushed down in a vertical direction, thus the pushing force (greatest principal stress) equals the weight of the rock mass itself. In the case of thrusting, the rock mass \"escapes\" in the direction of the least principal stress, namely upward, lifting the rock mass, and thus, the overburden equals the least principal stress. Strike-slip faulting is intermediate between the other two types described above. This difference in stress regime in the three faulting environments can contribute to differences in stress drop during faulting, which contributes to differences in the radiated energy, regardless of fault dimensions. For every unit increase in magnitude, there is a roughly thirty-fold increase in the energy released. For instance, an earthquake of magnitude 6.0 releases approximately 32 times more energy than a 5.0 magnitude earthquake and a 7.0 magnitude earthquake releases 1,000 times more energy than a 5.0 magnitude earthquake. An 8.6-magnitude earthquake releases the same amount of energy as 10,000 atomic bombs of the size used in World War II.[18] This is so because the energy released in an earthquake, and thus its magnitude, is proportional to the area of the fault that ruptures[19] and the stress drop. Therefore, the longer the length and the wider the width of the faulted area, the larger the resulting magnitude. The most important parameter controlling the maximum earthquake magnitude on a fault, however, is not the maximum available length, but the available width because the latter varies by a factor of 20. Along converging plate margins, the dip angle of the rupture plane is very shallow, typically about 10 degrees.[20] Thus, the width of the plane within the top brittle crust of the Earth can reach 50–100 km (31–62 mi) (such as in Japan, 2011, or in Alaska, 1964), making the most powerful earthquakes possible. The majority of tectonic earthquakes originate in the Ring of Fire at depths not exceeding tens of kilometers. Earthquakes occurring at a depth of less than 70 km (43 mi) are classified as \"shallow-focus\" earthquakes, while those with a focal depth between 70 and 300 km (43 and 186 mi) are commonly termed \"mid-focus\" or \"intermediate-depth\" earthquakes. In subduction zones, where older and colder oceanic crust descends beneath another tectonic plate, deep-focus earthquakes may occur at much greater depths (ranging from 300 to 700 km (190 to 430 mi)).[21] These seismically active areas of subduction are known as Wadati–Benioff zones. Deep-focus earthquakes occur at a depth where the subducted lithosphere should no longer be brittle, due to the high temperature and pressure. A possible mechanism for the generation of deep-focus earthquakes is faulting caused by olivine undergoing a phase transition into a spinel structure.[22] Earthquakes often occur in volcanic regions and are caused there, both by tectonic faults and the movement of magma in volcanoes. Such earthquakes can serve as an early warning of volcanic eruptions, as during the 1980 eruption of Mount St. Helens.[23] Earthquake swarms can serve as markers for the location of the flowing magma throughout the volcanoes. These swarms can be recorded by seismometers and tiltmeters (a device that measures ground slope) and used as sensors to predict imminent or upcoming eruptions.[24] A tectonic earthquake begins as an area of initial slip on the fault surface that forms the focus. Once the rupture has been initiated, it begins to propagate away from the focus, spreading out along the fault surface. Lateral propagation will continue until either the rupture reaches a barrier, such as the end of a fault segment, or a region on the fault where there is insufficient stress to allow continued rupture. For larger earthquakes, the depth extent of rupture will be constrained downwards by the brittle-ductile transition zone and upwards by the ground surface. The mechanics of this process are poorly understood because it is difficult either to recreate such rapid movements in a laboratory or to record seismic waves close to a nucleation zone due to strong ground motion.[25] In most cases, the rupture speed approaches, but does not exceed, the shear wave (S wave) velocity of the surrounding rock. There are a few exceptions to this: Supershear earthquake ruptures are known to have propagated at speeds greater than the S wave velocity. These have so far all been observed during large strike-slip events. The unusually wide zone of damage caused by the 2001 Kunlun earthquake has been attributed to the effects of the sonic boom developed in such earthquakes. Slow earthquake ruptures travel at unusually low velocities. A particularly dangerous form of slow earthquake is the tsunami earthquake, observed where the relatively low felt intensities, caused by the slow propagation speed of some great earthquakes, fail to alert the population of the neighboring coast, as in the 1896 Sanriku earthquake.[25] During an earthquake, high temperatures can develop at the fault plane, increasing pore pressure and consequently vaporization of the groundwater already contained within the rock.[27][28][29] In the coseismic phase, such an increase can significantly affect slip evolution and speed, in the post-seismic phase it can control the Aftershock sequence because, after the main event, pore pressure increase slowly propagates into the surrounding fracture network.[30][29] From the point of view of the Mohr-Coulomb strength theory, an increase in fluid pressure reduces the normal stress acting on the fault plane that holds it in place, and fluids can exert a lubricating effect. As thermal overpressurization may provide positive feedback between slip and strength fall at the fault plane, a common opinion is that it may enhance the faulting process instability. After the mainshock, the pressure gradient between the fault plane and the neighboring rock causes a fluid flow that increases pore pressure in the surrounding fracture networks; such an increase may trigger new faulting processes by reactivating adjacent faults, giving rise to aftershocks.[30][29] Analogously, artificial pore pressure increase, by fluid injection in Earth's crust, may induce seismicity. Tides may trigger some seismicity. Most earthquakes form part of a sequence, related to each other in terms of location and time.[31] Most earthquake clusters consist of small tremors that cause little to no damage, but there is a theory that earthquakes can recur in a regular pattern.[32] Earthquake clustering has been observed, for example, in Parkfield, California where a long-term research study is being conducted around the Parkfield earthquake cluster.[33] An aftershock is an earthquake that occurs after a previous earthquake, the mainshock. Rapid changes of stress between rocks, and the stress from the original earthquake are the main causes of these aftershocks,[34] along with the crust around the ruptured fault plane as it adjusts to the effects of the mainshock.[31] An aftershock is in the same region as the main shock but always of a smaller magnitude, however, they can still be powerful enough to cause even more damage to buildings that were already previously damaged from the mainshock.[34] If an aftershock is larger than the mainshock, the aftershock is redesignated as the mainshock and the original main shock is redesignated as a foreshock. Aftershocks are formed as the crust around the displaced fault plane adjusts to the effects of the mainshock.[31] Earthquake swarms are sequences of earthquakes striking in a specific area within a short period. They are different from earthquakes followed by a series of aftershocks by the fact that no single earthquake in the sequence is the main shock, so none has a notably higher magnitude than another. An example of an earthquake swarm is the 2004 activity at Yellowstone National Park.[35] In August 2012, a swarm of earthquakes shook Southern California's Imperial Valley, showing the most recorded activity in the area since the 1970s.[36] Sometimes a series of earthquakes occur in what has been called an earthquake storm, where the earthquakes strike a fault in clusters, each triggered by the shaking or stress redistribution of the previous earthquakes. Similar to aftershocks but on adjacent segments of fault, these storms occur over the course of years, with some of the later earthquakes as damaging as the early ones. Such a pattern was observed in the sequence of about a dozen earthquakes that struck the North Anatolian Fault in Turkey in the 20th century and has been inferred for older anomalous clusters of large earthquakes in the Middle East.[37][38] It is estimated that around 500,000 earthquakes occur each year, detectable with current instrumentation. About 100,000 of these can be felt.[4][5] Minor earthquakes occur very frequently around the world in places like California and Alaska in the U.S., as well as in El Salvador, Mexico, Guatemala, Chile, Peru, Indonesia, the Philippines, Iran, Pakistan, the Azores in Portugal, Turkey, New Zealand, Greece, Italy, India, Nepal, and Japan.[40] Larger earthquakes occur less frequently, the relationship being exponential; for example, roughly ten times as many earthquakes larger than magnitude 4 occur than earthquakes larger than magnitude 5.[41] In the (low seismicity) United Kingdom, for example, it has been calculated that the average recurrences are: an earthquake of 3.7–4.6 every year, an earthquake of 4.7–5.5 every 10 years, and an earthquake of 5.6 or larger every 100 years.[42] This is an example of the Gutenberg–Richter law. The number of seismic stations has increased from about 350 in 1931 to many thousands today. As a result, many more earthquakes are reported than in the past, but this is because of the vast improvement in instrumentation, rather than an increase in the number of earthquakes. The United States Geological Survey (USGS) estimates that, since 1900, there have been an average of 18 major earthquakes (magnitude 7.0–7.9) and one great earthquake (magnitude 8.0 or greater) per year, and that this average has been relatively stable.[43] In recent years, the number of major earthquakes per year has decreased, though this is probably a statistical fluctuation rather than a systematic trend.[44] More detailed statistics on the size and frequency of earthquakes is available from the United States Geological Survey.[45] A recent increase in the number of major earthquakes has been noted, which could be explained by a cyclical pattern of periods of intense tectonic activity, interspersed with longer periods of low intensity. However, accurate recordings of earthquakes only began in the early 1900s, so it is too early to categorically state that this is the case.[46] Most of the world's earthquakes (90%, and 81% of the largest) take place in the 40,000-kilometre-long (25,000 mi), horseshoe-shaped zone called the circum-Pacific seismic belt, known as the Pacific Ring of Fire, which for the most part bounds the Pacific plate.[47][48] Massive earthquakes tend to occur along other plate boundaries too, such as along the Himalayan Mountains.[49] With the rapid growth of mega-cities such as Mexico City, Tokyo, and Tehran in areas of high seismic risk, some seismologists are warning that a single earthquake may claim the lives of up to three million people.[50] While most earthquakes are caused by the movement of the Earth's tectonic plates, human activity can also produce earthquakes. Activities both above ground and below may change the stresses and strains on the crust, including building reservoirs, extracting resources such as coal or oil, and injecting fluids underground for waste disposal or fracking.[51] Most of these earthquakes have small magnitudes. The 5.7 magnitude 2011 Oklahoma earthquake is thought to have been caused by disposing wastewater from oil production into injection wells,[52] and studies point to the state's oil industry as the cause of other earthquakes in the past century.[53] A Columbia University paper suggested that the 8.0 magnitude 2008 Sichuan earthquake was induced by loading from the Zipingpu Dam,[54] though the link has not been conclusively proved.[55] The instrumental scales used to describe the size of an earthquake began with the Richter scale in the 1930s. It is a relatively simple measurement of an event's amplitude, and its use has become minimal in the 21st century. Seismic waves travel through the Earth's interior and can be recorded by seismometers at great distances. The surface-wave magnitude was developed in the 1950s as a means to measure remote earthquakes and to improve the accuracy for larger events. The moment magnitude scale not only measures the amplitude of the shock but also takes into account the seismic moment (total rupture area, average slip of the fault, and rigidity of the rock). The Japan Meteorological Agency seismic intensity scale, the Medvedev–Sponheuer–Karnik scale, and the Mercalli intensity scale are based on the observed effects and are related to the intensity of shaking. The shaking of the earth is a common phenomenon that has been experienced by humans from the earliest of times. Before the development of strong-motion accelerometers, the intensity of a seismic event was estimated based on the observed effects. Magnitude and intensity are not directly related and calculated using different methods. The magnitude of an earthquake is a single value that describes the size of the earthquake at its source. Intensity is the measure of shaking at different locations around the earthquake. Intensity values vary from place to place, depending on the distance from the earthquake and the underlying rock or soil makeup.[56] The first scale for measuring earthquake magnitudes was developed by Charles Francis Richter in 1935. Subsequent scales (seismic magnitude scales) have retained a key feature, where each unit represents a ten-fold difference in the amplitude of the ground shaking and a 32-fold difference in energy. Subsequent scales are also adjusted to have approximately the same numeric value within the limits of the scale.[57] Although the mass media commonly reports earthquake magnitudes as \"Richter magnitude\" or \"Richter scale\", standard practice by most seismological authorities is to express an earthquake's strength on the moment magnitude scale, which is based on the actual energy released by an earthquake, the static seismic moment.[58][59] Every earthquake produces different types of seismic waves, which travel through rock with different velocities: Propagation velocity of the seismic waves through solid rock ranges from approx. 3 km/s (1.9 mi/s) up to 13 km/s (8.1 mi/s), depending on the density and elasticity of the medium. In the Earth's interior, the shock- or P waves travel much faster than the S waves (approx. relation 1.7:1). The differences in travel time from the epicenter to the observatory are a measure of the distance and can be used to image both sources of earthquakes and structures within the Earth. Also, the depth of the hypocenter can be computed roughly. P wave speed S waves speed As a consequence, the first waves of a distant earthquake arrive at an observatory via the Earth's mantle. On average, the kilometer distance to the earthquake is the number of seconds between the P- and S wave times 8.[60] Slight deviations are caused by inhomogeneities of subsurface structure. By such analysis of seismograms, the Earth's core was located in 1913 by Beno Gutenberg. S waves and later arriving surface waves do most of the damage compared to P waves. P waves squeeze and expand the material in the same direction they are traveling, whereas S waves shake the ground up and down and back and forth.[61] Earthquakes are not only categorized by their magnitude but also by the place where they occur. The world is divided into 754 Flinn–Engdahl regions (F-E regions), which are based on political and geographical boundaries as well as seismic activity. More active zones are divided into smaller F-E regions whereas less active zones belong to larger F-E regions. Standard reporting of earthquakes includes its magnitude, date and time of occurrence, geographic coordinates of its epicenter, depth of the epicenter, geographical region, distances to population centers, location uncertainty, several parameters that are included in USGS earthquake reports (number of stations reporting, number of observations, etc.), and a unique event ID.[62] Although relatively slow seismic waves have traditionally been used to detect earthquakes, scientists realized in 2016 that gravitational measurement could provide instantaneous detection of earthquakes, and confirmed this by analyzing gravitational records associated with the 2011 Tohoku-Oki (\"Fukushima\") earthquake.[63][64] The effects of earthquakes include, but are not limited to, the following: Shaking and ground rupture are the main effects created by earthquakes, principally resulting in more or less severe damage to buildings and other rigid structures. The severity of the local effects depends on the complex combination of the earthquake magnitude, the distance from the epicenter, and the local geological and geomorphological conditions, which may amplify or reduce wave propagation.[65] The ground-shaking is measured by ground acceleration. Specific local geological, geomorphological, and geostructural features can induce high levels of shaking on the ground surface even from low-intensity earthquakes. This effect is called site or local amplification. It is principally due to the transfer of the seismic motion from hard deep soils to soft superficial soils and the effects of seismic energy focalization owing to the typical geometrical setting of such deposits. Ground rupture is a visible breaking and displacement of the Earth's surface along the trace of the fault, which may be of the order of several meters in the case of major earthquakes. Ground rupture is a major risk for large engineering structures such as dams, bridges, and nuclear power stations and requires careful mapping of existing faults to identify any that are likely to break the ground surface within the life of the structure.[66] Soil liquefaction occurs when, because of the shaking, water-saturated granular material (such as sand) temporarily loses its strength and transforms from a solid to a liquid. Soil liquefaction may cause rigid structures, like buildings and bridges, to tilt or sink into the liquefied deposits. For example, in the 1964 Alaska earthquake, soil liquefaction caused many buildings to sink into the ground, eventually collapsing upon themselves.[67] Physical damage from an earthquake will vary depending on the intensity of shaking in a given area and the type of population. Underserved and developing communities frequently experience more severe impacts (and longer lasting) from a seismic event compared to well-developed communities.[68] Impacts may include: With these impacts and others, the aftermath may bring disease, a lack of basic necessities, mental consequences such as panic attacks and depression to survivors,[69] and higher insurance premiums. Recovery times will vary based on the level of damage and the socioeconomic status of the impacted community. Earthquakes can produce slope instability leading to landslides, a major geological hazard. Landslide danger may persist while emergency personnel is attempting rescue work.[70] Earthquakes can cause fires by damaging electrical power or gas lines. In the event of water mains rupturing and a loss of pressure, it may also become difficult to stop the spread of a fire once it has started. For example, more deaths in the 1906 San Francisco earthquake were caused by fire than by the earthquake itself.[71] Tsunamis are long-wavelength, long-period sea waves produced by the sudden or abrupt movement of large volumes of water—including when an earthquake occurs at sea. In the open ocean, the distance between wave crests can surpass 100 kilometres (62 mi), and the wave periods can vary from five minutes to one hour. Such tsunamis travel 600–800 kilometers per hour (373–497 miles per hour), depending on water depth. Large waves produced by an earthquake or a submarine landslide can overrun nearby coastal areas in a matter of minutes. Tsunamis can also travel thousands of kilometers across open ocean and wreak destruction on far shores hours after the earthquake that generated them.[72] Ordinarily, subduction earthquakes under magnitude 7.5 do not cause tsunamis, although some instances of this have been recorded. Most destructive tsunamis are caused by earthquakes of magnitude 7.5 or more.[72] Floods may be secondary effects of earthquakes if dams are damaged. Earthquakes may cause landslips to dam rivers, which collapse and cause floods.[73] The terrain below the Sarez Lake in Tajikistan is in danger of catastrophic flooding if the landslide dam formed by the earthquake, known as the Usoi Dam, were to fail during a future earthquake. Impact projections suggest the flood could affect roughly five million people.[74] Earthquake prediction is a branch of the science of seismology concerned with the specification of the time, location, and magnitude of future earthquakes within stated limits.[75] Many methods have been developed for predicting the time and place in which earthquakes will occur. Despite considerable research efforts by seismologists, scientifically reproducible predictions cannot yet be made to a specific day or month.[76] Popular belief holds earthquakes are preceded by earthquake weather, in the early morning.[77][78] While forecasting is usually considered to be a type of prediction, earthquake forecasting is often differentiated from earthquake prediction. Earthquake forecasting is concerned with the probabilistic assessment of general earthquake hazards, including the frequency and magnitude of damaging earthquakes in a given area over years or decades.[79] For well-understood faults the probability that a segment may rupture during the next few decades can be estimated.[80][81] Earthquake warning systems have been developed that can provide regional notification of an earthquake in progress, but before the ground surface has begun to move, potentially allowing people within the system's range to seek shelter before the earthquake's impact is felt. The objective of earthquake engineering is to foresee the impact of earthquakes on buildings, bridges, tunnels, roadways, and other structures, and to design such structures to minimize the risk of damage. Existing structures can be modified by seismic retrofitting to improve their resistance to earthquakes. Earthquake insurance can provide building owners with financial protection against losses resulting from earthquakes. Emergency management strategies can be employed by a government or organization to mitigate risks and prepare for consequences. Artificial intelligence may help to assess buildings and plan precautionary operations. The Igor expert system is part of a mobile laboratory that supports the procedures leading to the seismic assessment of masonry buildings and the planning of retrofitting operations on them. It has been applied to assess buildings in Lisbon, Rhodes, and Naples.[82] Individuals can also take preparedness steps like securing water heaters and heavy items that could injure someone, locating shutoffs for utilities, and being educated about what to do when the shaking starts. For areas near large bodies of water, earthquake preparedness encompasses the possibility of a tsunami caused by a large earthquake. From the lifetime of the Greek philosopher Anaxagoras in the 5th century BCE to the 14th century CE, earthquakes were usually attributed to \"air (vapors) in the cavities of the Earth.\"[83] Thales of Miletus (625–547 BCE) was the only documented person who believed that earthquakes were caused by tension between the earth and water.[83] Other theories existed, including the Greek philosopher Anaxamines' (585–526 BCE) beliefs that short incline episodes of dryness and wetness caused seismic activity. The Greek philosopher Democritus (460–371 BCE) blamed water in general for earthquakes.[83] Pliny the Elder called earthquakes \"underground thunderstorms\".[83] In Norse mythology, earthquakes were explained as the violent struggle of the god Loki. When Loki, god of mischief and strife, murdered Baldr, god of beauty and light, he was punished by being bound in a cave with a poisonous serpent placed above his head dripping venom. Loki's wife Sigyn stood by him with a bowl to catch the poison, but whenever she had to empty the bowl, the poison dripped on Loki's face, forcing him to jerk his head away and thrash against his bonds, which caused the earth to tremble.[84] In Greek mythology, Poseidon was the cause and god of earthquakes. When he was in a bad mood, he struck the ground with a trident, causing earthquakes and other calamities. He also used earthquakes to punish and inflict fear upon people as revenge.[85] In Japanese mythology, Namazu (鯰) is a giant catfish who causes earthquakes. Namazu lives in the mud beneath the earth and is guarded by the god Kashima, who restrains the fish with a stone. When Kashima lets his guard fall, Namazu thrashes about, causing violent earthquakes.[86] In the New Testament, Matthew's Gospel refers to earthquakes occurring both after the death of Jesus (Matthew 27:51, 54) and at his resurrection (Matthew 28:2).[87] Earthquakes form part of the picture through which Jesus portrays the beginning of the end of time.[88] In modern popular culture, the portrayal of earthquakes is shaped by the memory of great cities laid waste, such as Kobe in 1995 or San Francisco in 1906.[89] Fictional earthquakes tend to strike suddenly and without warning.[89] For this reason, stories about earthquakes generally begin with the disaster and focus on its immediate aftermath, as in Short Walk to Daylight (1972), The Ragged Edge (1968) or Aftershock: Earthquake in New York (1999).[89] A notable example is Heinrich von Kleist's classic novella, The Earthquake in Chile, which describes the destruction of Santiago in 1647. Haruki Murakami's short fiction collection After the Quake depicts the consequences of the Kobe earthquake of 1995. The most popular single earthquake in fiction is the hypothetical \"Big One\" expected of California's San Andreas Fault someday, as depicted in the novels Richter 10 (1996), Goodbye California (1977), 2012 (2009), and San Andreas (2015), among other works.[89] Jacob M. Appel's widely anthologized short story, A Comparative Seismology, features a con artist who convinces an elderly woman that an apocalyptic earthquake is imminent.[90] Contemporary depictions of earthquakes in film are variable in the manner in which they reflect human psychological reactions to the actual trauma that can be caused to directly afflicted families and their loved ones.[91] Disaster mental health response research emphasizes the need to be aware of the different roles of loss of family and key community members, loss of home and familiar surroundings, and loss of essential supplies and services to maintain survival.[92][93] Particularly for children, the clear availability of caregiving adults who can protect, nourish, and clothe them in the aftermath of the earthquake and help them make sense of what has befallen them is more important to their emotional and physical health than the simple giving of provisions.[94] As was observed after other disasters involving destruction and loss of life and their media depictions, recently observed in the 2010 Haiti earthquake, it is also believed to be important not to pathologize the reactions to loss and displacement or disruption of governmental administration and services, but rather to validate the reactions to support constructive problem-solving and reflection.[95] Phenomena similar to earthquakes have been observed on other planets (e.g., marsquakes on Mars) and on the Moon (e.g., moonquakes).",

                "content": "Our editors will review what you’ve submitted and determine whether to revise the article. Over the centuries, earthquakes have been responsible for millions of deaths and an incalculable amount of damage to property. Depending on their intensity, earthquakes (specifically, the degree to which they cause the ground’s surface to shake) can topple buildings and bridges, rupture gas pipelines and other infrastructure, and trigger landslides, tsunamis, and volcanoes. These phenomena are primarily responsible for deaths and injuries. Very great earthquakes occur on average about once per year. Earthquake waves, more commonly known as seismic waves, are vibrations generated by an earthquake and propagated within Earth or along its surface. There are four principal types of elastic waves: two, primary and secondary waves, travel within Earth, whereas the other two, Rayleigh and Love waves, called surface waves, travel along its surface. In addition, seismic waves can be produced artificially by explosions. Magnitude is a measure of the amplitude (height) of the seismic waves an earthquake’s source produces as recorded by seismographs. Seismologist Charles F. Richter created an earthquake magnitude scale using the logarithm of the largest seismic wave’s amplitude to base 10. Richter’s scale was originally for measuring the magnitude of earthquakes from magnitudes 3 to 7, limiting its usefulness. Today the moment magnitude scale, a closer measure of an earthquake’s total energy release, is preferred. Earthquakes can occur anywhere, but they occur mainly along fault lines (planar or curved fractures in the rocks of Earth’s crust), where compressional or tensional forces move rocks on opposite sides of a fracture. Faults extend from a few centimetres to many hundreds of kilometres. In addition, most of the world’s earthquakes occur within the Ring of Fire, a long horseshoe-shaped belt of earthquake epicentres, volcanoes, and tectonic plate boundaries fringing the Pacific basin. earthquake, any sudden shaking of the ground caused by the passage of seismic waves through Earth’s rocks. Seismic waves are produced when some form of energy stored in Earth’s crust is suddenly released, usually when masses of rock straining against one another suddenly fracture and “slip.” Earthquakes occur most often along geologic faults, narrow zones where rock masses move in relation to one another. The major fault lines of the world are located at the fringes of the huge tectonic plates that make up Earth’s crust. (See the table of major earthquakes.) Little was understood about earthquakes until the emergence of seismology at the beginning of the 20th century. Seismology, which involves the scientific study of all aspects of earthquakes, has yielded answers to such long-standing questions as why and how earthquakes occur. About 50,000 earthquakes large enough to be noticed without the aid of instruments occur annually over the entire Earth. Of these, approximately 100 are of sufficient size to produce substantial damage if their centres are near areas of habitation. Very great earthquakes occur on average about once per year. Over the centuries they have been responsible for millions of deaths and an incalculable amount of damage to property. Earth’s major earthquakes occur mainly in belts coinciding with the margins of tectonic plates. This has long been apparent from early catalogs of felt earthquakes and is even more readily discernible in modern seismicity maps, which show instrumentally determined epicentres. The most important earthquake belt is the Circum-Pacific Belt, which affects many populated coastal regions around the Pacific Ocean—for example, those of New Zealand, New Guinea, Japan, the Aleutian Islands, Alaska, and the western coasts of North and South America. It is estimated that 80 percent of the energy presently released in earthquakes comes from those whose epicentres are in this belt. The seismic activity is by no means uniform throughout the belt, and there are a number of branches at various points. Because at many places the Circum-Pacific Belt is associated with volcanic activity, it has been popularly dubbed the “Pacific Ring of Fire.” A second belt, known as the Alpide Belt, passes through the Mediterranean region eastward through Asia and joins the Circum-Pacific Belt in the East Indies. The energy released in earthquakes from this belt is about 15 percent of the world total. There also are striking connected belts of seismic activity, mainly along oceanic ridges—including those in the Arctic Ocean, the Atlantic Ocean, and the western Indian Ocean—and along the rift valleys of East Africa. This global seismicity distribution is best understood in terms of its plate tectonic setting. Earthquakes are caused by the sudden release of energy within some limited region of the rocks of the Earth. The energy can be released by elastic strain, gravity, chemical reactions, or even the motion of massive bodies. Of all these the release of elastic strain is the most important cause, because this form of energy is the only kind that can be stored in sufficient quantity in the Earth to produce major disturbances. Earthquakes associated with this type of energy release are called tectonic earthquakes.",

                "title": "Game Recap: Cowboys fall to Bengals, 27-20",
                "content": "Editor of Dallas Cowboys Star Magazine / Dallas Cowboys Game Program The little things can be the difference between winning and losing. Fighting to keep their slim playoff hopes alive, the Cowboys gave Cincinnati one chance too many when a partially blocked punt – normally a good thing – instead resulted in an eventual 27-20 victory for the Bengals. With that, Dallas's record fell to 5-8, the team's road to any kind of playoff contention becoming that much tougher. Facing a defense that ranks among the worst in the NFL, the Cowboys were able to rack up 322 yards of offense. Running back Rico Dowdle followed up his 100-yard effort last week by again topping the century mark, rushing for a career-high 130 yards on 18 carries for an impressive 7.3 average. And they needed every bit of that ground production because the aerial attack again struggled. Cooper Rush was able to spread the ball around with 11 different players targeted and eight recording a catch. CeeDee Lamb led the effort with six grabs for 93 yards and a score, but the short game overall resulted in just 183 yards passing for Rush with two touchdowns and one interception for a 77.8 mark rating. Conversely, in the end, despite a valiant effort by the defense, the Cowboys just couldn't stop Rush's counterpart. Bengals quarterback Joe Burrow, who is having an MVP-type season, wound up completing 75 percent of his passes for 369 yards, three touchdowns and one pick for a 112.8 mark. Burrow's primary target was Ja'Marr Chase, the star wideout hauling in 18 passes for 177 yards and two of those scores. He was joined by running back Chase Brown, who picked up 123 yards from scrimmage. And in a case of when it rains it pours, the injury bug again bit the Cowboys. Starting center Cooper Beebe didn't return in the second half due to a concussion. Then special teams ace C.J. Goodwin (hamstring) and electrifying linebacker DeMarvion Overshown (knee) both headed to the sideline in the fourth quarter. First Quarter The Cowboys couldn't have asked for a better start in the game's opening minutes. First, their defense forced a quick three-and-out for the Bengals, which was followed by KaVontae Turpin returning the ensuing punt 20 yards to the Dallas 40. Rush then led the offense on a nine-play drive across the goal line, the score coming when he lofted a high pass that dropped right into the arms of Lamb, who was all alone in the back-right corner of the end zone. Cincinnati came right back, though, with their own 11-play, 70-yard drive to tie things up at 7-7 before the quarter was done. Chase had a 14-yard run around the left end, hauled in a 14-yard pass and then capped off the drive with a 5-yard catch for the touchdown. Second Quarter Dallas was on the move as the second frame got underway, having reached the Bengals' 12-yard line. But on the first snap of the quarter, Rush was picked off by safety Geno Stone, the Cincinnati interception bringing an abrupt halt to the Cowboys' threat. No worries, the defense soon stopped the Bengals on fourth-and-3 at the Dallas 44-yard line, which in turn gave the Cowboys good field position for their next try. Seven plays later, out came Brandon Aubrey to split the uprights on a 35-yard field goal. Unfortunately, the Cowboys headed into the break trailing as the Bengals put up 10 points over the final six-plus minutes of the first half. It started with Burrows orchestrating a six-play, 64-yard drive that took only 2:53 off the clock. That ended with Brown taking a swing pass on the left side and darting down the sideline 16 yards for the touchdown. The Cowboys had time to respond, but they quickly went three-and-out, forced to punt just after the two-minute warning. That led to a 37-yard field goal for the visitors, Cincinnati going into halftime with a 17-10 advantage. Third Quarter Although without Beebe, the Dallas offense came out on its opening possession of the third quarter and rumbled 70 yards in eight plays to the end zone. Rush hit Turpin on a 16-yard completion and Dowdle picked up 27 yards on a run off right tackle. Scoring the touchdown, though, was Brandin Cooks on a 3-yard catch, his second in as many games since returning from a knee injury. And the big men up front kept moving people. After safety Malik Hooker corralled his second interception of the season at the Dallas 17-yard line, the Cowboys were able to work their way across midfield as the third quarter came to a close. Fourth Quarter The drive, though, was hampered by a 15-yard unnecessary roughness penalty, but the Dallas offense reached the Cincinnati 29-yard line after Dowdle burst up the middle for a 14-yard gain on the last play of the third. That left it to Aubrey to open up the fourth with a 47-yard field goal to give the Cowboys' a 20-17 lead. But it didn't last long. Burrow and company wasted no time evening the score again. Cincinnati managed to reach the Dallas 10-yard line, but on third-and-2, a pass to Tee Higgins in the end zone was well-covered by cornerback DaRon Bland, the ball falling incomplete. The Bengals then had to settle for a 29-yard field goal. With the defense on both sides taking control, the Cowboys thought they were getting the ball back when Cincinnati was forced to punt right after the two-minute warning. But although Dallas' Nick Vigil was able to partially block the punt, the ball traveled 13 yards. And that's where Amani Oruwariye touched the ball trying to recover it. When he was unable to, the Bengals fell on the prize to retain possession. Three snaps later, Burrows threw a short pass to Chase, who then raced down the right sideline 40 yards for the touchdown, giving the Bengals the 27-20 lead. The Cowboys had one more shot, taking possession with 1:01 remaining on the clock, but Rush's pass attempt to Jake Ferguson on fourth-and-7 at the Dallas 48-yard line sailed high, game over. The Cowboys send the fans home happy with a 27-20 Thanksgiving Day win over the rival New York Giants. The game was ugly at times, but in the end it was simply beautiful as the Cowboys earned a 34-26 victory over the Commanders. Not only did the Cowboys lose to their state rivals in Houston, 34-10, but their already depleted roster suffered even more injuries to key players. With quarterback Dak Prescott now sidelined, the Cowboys were unable to get much going on offense in a blowout 34-6 loss to the rival Eagles. The Cowboys fall 27-21 to the Falcons but also suffer key injuries to Dak Prescott and potentially CeeDee Lamb. Despite a halftime lead and a valiant fourth-quarter rally, the Cowboys can't overcome the 49ers' 21 unanswered points in the third quarter, losing 30-24. The undermanned Cowboys were no match in their showdown against Detroit, losing to the Lions in a blowout, 47-9 Despite injuries and turnovers early on, the Cowboys orchestrate a late-game comeback for a 20-17 victory over the Steelers. The game wasn't always pretty, but the Cowboys outlasted the Giants to capture a 20-15 victory over their NFC rivals. Despite a furious fourth quarter rally, the Cowboys' comeback falls short as they lose to the Ravens, 28-25. The Dallas defense had no answer for the Saints, who marched in and marched over the Cowboys, 44-19. ©2024 Dallas Cowboys. All rights reserved.

The reasons for such a distinction didn't have much to do with the game's postseason implications — Cincinnati's playoff hopes are on their last legs, while Dallas' have already evaporated. Rather, this was a spectacle, just the sort that Jerry Jones envisioned when drawing up the plans for AT&T Stadium, the booming metropolis he hoped would house championship-caliber teams. So, how is that plan going along thus far? Well, on Monday, the Cowboys added a new low to a season increasingly filled with them, falling to the Bengals 27-20 under the MNF banner. MORE BENGALS-COWBOYS NEWS: A defeat to Cincinnati and its talismanic battery of Joe Burrow and Ja'Marr Chase wouldn't be a cause of much concern in normal circumstances. The pairing was as lively as ever on Monday, with Burrow completing 75 percent of his pass attempts and accounting for 369 yards and three touchdowns worth of passing offense. Chase collected 14 catches for 177 yards and two scores on the night, further cementing his place as a legitimate Offensive Player of the Year contender. For all of Burrow and Chase's heroics, it was Dallas that looked the likelier victors with two minutes left. Nick Vigil burst through the mire, got his harrowing mitts to Ryan Rehkow's attempted punt, and batted it down to a mere trickle off Rehkow's foot. The ball sidled back and forth like a tumbleweed as it bounded harmlessly toward midfield, seemingly foreshadowing some sort of Cowboys win. Right? Not exactly. Gunner Amani Oruwariye attempted to field the bouncing ball, only to mishandle the wild feather. It bounced into Cincinnati's hands afterward. League rules insist that in such a circumstance, the kicking team receives the ball with a full set of downs. Burrow and Chase went to work, chopped down Dallas' secondary in one fell swoop, and walked out fortunate victors. The Cowboys, meanwhile, were left rueing another seemingly incomprehensible defeat. The Sporting News tracked live scoring updates and highlights from Cowboys vs. Bengals. Below is the full record of what went down when Dallas and Cincinnati dueled with one another in AT&T Stadium. STREAM: Watch Cowboys vs. Bengals with Fubo NFL HQ: Live NFL scores | Updated NFL standings | Full NFL schedule All times ET. 11:19 p.m.: Rush's attempt at a game-tying drive falls short. His fourth down throw spurns Cooks' grasp, gifting the Bengals what looked an unlikely win. 11:13 p.m.: TOUCHDOWN! Chase turns Bland loose on the curl route and makes a house call from 40 yards out.

Nick Vigil burst through the mire to swat away Ryan Rehkow's attempted punt. However, Amani Oruwariye touched the ball but failed to recover it, giving Cincinnati the chance to recover the twirling ball and receive a new set of downs as a result. The Cowboys blocks the punt... but it was then touched by a Dallas player... and then recovered by the Bengals 🤯Chaos. @Bengals ball pic.twitter.com/Uw0l4ebH3v 11:05 p.m.: Dallas' defense breaches the gates, bringing Burrow to the canvas on the third-and-long blitz. The Cowboys are going to get the ball back as we sink below two minutes. 10:59 p.m.: Burrow's return to the field coincided with a new fashion choice: after being swept away in Dallas' pass rush last possession, he's sporting a bulky sleeve across his left knee — the same one he injured as a rookie. 10:55 p.m.: Dallas returns the favor, recording a three-and-out of its own. The Bengals will take control with about 5:40 left in the fourth. 10:48 p.m.: Cincinnati is forced to boot the ball away. However, it's fairly apparent that a rusher grab a fistful of Burrow's facemark prior to him getting wrapped in a sack. Nevertheless, the call wasn't made. As such, the Bengals are forced to kick it away. 10:45 p.m.: Tanner Hudson is the latest name to get involved in the offensive action, gobbling up 19 yards after absorbing a Burrow bolt. 10:41 p.m.: Cincinnati's defense bursts into life, stacking the deck to force a Dallas three-and-out. Now, the Bengals' high-powered attack returns to the field with a chance to take the lead. 10:34 p.m.: FIELD GOAL! York evens the score with his third successful try of the day. Cowboys 20, Bengals 20 10:32 p.m.: Cincinnati returning to form quite quickly after Burrow's interception.

Aubrey's line drive finds its target, pushing Dallas back out in front. Cowboys 20, Bengals 17 10:09 p.m.: INTERCEPTION! Burrow suffers his first major misstep of the night, misfiring and sending his errant effort towards the waiting hands of Dallas safety Malik Hooker.

Rush will look to lead his offense back to its early game best after seeing three straight drives end in three-and-outs. 9:33 p.m.: FIELD GOAL! York sinks another field goal to push Cincy's lead to a touchdown-sized edge. Bengals 17, Cowboys 10 9:30 p.m.: Chase continues to flex his might over this weary Cowboys secondary. He's up to seven grabs for 87 yards. Looks to be getting whatever he wants on offense, even when matched up against notable corners Bland and Diggs. 9:22 p.m.: Dallas falls flat on the ensuing drive, with the Bengals forcing a punt following a swift three-and-out. Cincinnati will have a chance to add to its advantage as the first half draws to a close. 9:14 p.m.: TOUCHDOWN! Brown fields Burrow's throw, races down the sidelines and dashes beyond a gaggle of Cowboys mercenaries, using Iosivas' timely block to take his place in the end zone.

Six targets, five catches, 60 yards and a score thus far. 9:11 p.m.: Burrow pulls off some more razzle-dazzle, sneaking beyond the oncoming pass-rush, stepping up in the pocket and delivering a bolt to Andrei Iosivas, who rumbled forward for 23 yards. 9:06 p.m.: FIELD GOAL! Dallas is unable to penetrate break through Cincinnati's defense for seven. Instead, Aubrey hits the mark from short range as the Cowboys pull out in front once more. Cowboys 10, Bengals 7 9:04 p.m.: The Cowboys continue to operate efficiently. They're making another trek deep into Cincinnati territory. 8:59 p.m.: Dallas shuts the door on fourth down. 8:55 p.m.: Chase finding it quite easy to get involved early. Just snagged another Burrow dot as Cincinnati gets a new se too downs. He's up to four catches for 46 yards and a score thus far. 8:52 p.m.: INTERCEPTION! Miscommunication between Rush and Lamb ends in heartbreak. Anticipating the slant pattern, Rush fired a ball towards Lamb's general vicinity. Unfortunately for the Dallas signal-caller, Lamb was displaced, caught under the weight of an incidental collision with his marker. The result? A deflected ball that eventually landed in Geno Stone's grasp. Cincinnati's defense records a much-desired turnover to halt Dallas' red zone progress.

More Burrow heroics on third down. Who could've predicted that? 8:35 p.m.: The Bengals are methodically working their way down the field. Burrow has hit a stride, using Chase Brown and Ja'Marr Chase's chicanery to great effect as Cincinnati traipses towards Dallas' end zone. 8:24 p.m.: TOUCHDOWN! Lamb bursts beyond his opposite number, finds open space in the end zone and collects Rush's lofted effort on fourth-and-one. That's one way to make an impression in the game's opening minutes.

The Bengals have one of the worst defenses in football. We'll see if Rush can take advantage. 8:18 p.m.: Trevon Diggs knocks the ball away from Tee Higgins as the Cowboys hold the high-powered Cincinnati offense to a three-and-out. A solid KaVontae Turpin return sets up Cooper Rush and Co. with good field position ahead of their first possession of the game. 8:15 p.m.: Brandon Aubrey sends the ball into the deep Dallas sky.

                "content": "The Cincinnati Bengals have snapped their three-game skid. Cincinnati defeated the Dallas Cowboys on the road in the Week 14 edition of “Monday Night Football,” 27-20. Wide receiver Ja’Marr Chase continued his incredible run with two more touchdowns, including a 40-yard catch-and-run that ended up being the game winner. That score made it eight touchdowns for the wideout in his last four games and extended his league lead to 15 receiving touchdowns this year. Chase might not have had a chance to score that touchdown if not for a wild sequence a few plays earlier. Bengals punter Ryan Rehkow’s punt was blocked by a Cowboys defender on fourth down coming out of the two-minute warning. But the tipped ball ended up bouncing off of the arms of cornerback/special teamer Amani Oruwariye, and Cincinnati recovered the fumble just shy of midfield. NFL STATS CENTRAL: The latest NFL scores, schedules, odds, stats and more. Three plays later, Chase took the game-winner to the house. Here’s the full story of how the Bengals finally won a one-score game after dropping three straight entering this week: DO YOU LIKE FOOTBALL? Then you'll enjoy getting our NFL newsletter delivered to your inbox A Bart Simpson-to-Lisa Simpson touchdown play won the game for the Bengals during \"The Simpsons\" alt-cast. Cooper Rush's pass attempt to Jake Ferguson on fourth-and-7 from the Cowboys' 48-yard line and 31 seconds remaining in the game fell incomplete. The Bengals prevailed, 27-20, thanks to that wild muffed blocked punt-to-long touchdown sequence. The Cowboys' Amani Oruwariye attempted to field a blocked punt, and it turned out to be quite costly for Dallas. Oruwariye couldn't field the blocked kick cleanly and turned it over the Bengals, who immediately took advantage of their great fortune. Instead of getting the ball back with two minutes remaining, the Cowboys got burned by Bengals receiver Ja'Marr Chase for a 40-yard touchdown pass from Joe Burrow. Chase finished the game with 14 catches for 177 yards and two touchdowns. The 14 receptions ties a record for the most in a \"Monday Night Football\" game. It was a stunning turn over events at AT&T Stadium. And for Cowboys fans, Oruwariye's muff might live in infamy alongside Leon Lett's gaffe on Thanksgiving Day 1993. Cade York knocked through his second field goal attempt of the night, this one from 29 yards out, to draw the game back even. Early in the fourth quarter, DeMarvion Overshown was in on a tackle of Bengals running back Chase Brown. After the play, the Cowboys' linebacker remained on the ground and needed the help of two Cowboys trainers to walk off of the field. Overshown has been declared out with a knee injury. Overshown, a member of the 2023 NFL draft class, missed the entirety of his rookie season after tearing his ACL in a preseason game. He had played in all 12 games for the Cowboys entering Monday night's game. Former MLS first-round draft pick Brandon Aubrey nailed his second field goal attempt of the night to give the Cowboys another lead. Dallas leads, 20-17, five seconds into the fourth quarter. Dallas has the ball on Cincinnati's 29-yard line on fourth-and-10 and will attempt a field goal to begin the fourth quarter. Joe Burrow overthrew Ja'Marr Chase deep downfield, and his pass ended in the hands of the Cowboys' safety instead. Dallas will take over possession on its own 17-yard line with 6:50 to play in the third quarter. Over on \"The Simpsons\" alt-cast, it was Cowboys safety Homer Simpson who intercepted Bengals quarterback Bart Simpson on the play. The Cowboys scored on their first possession of the second half thanks to Brandin Cooks' efforts in the end zone. The receiver ripped through a defensive hold by cornerback Josh Newton, and Cooper Rush found him in the back of the end zone for the score. It's 17-17 with 10:32 left in the third quarter. The Cowboys went three-and-out on their final possession of the first half, and this \"Monday Night Football\" matchup goes to halftime with the Bengals holding a seven-point lead. Dallas will receive the second half kickoff. The Bengals drove down to the red zone before they were stopped by Dallas' defense at the 19. Cade York hit a 37-yard field goal to give Cincinnati a 17-10 lead with 30 seconds left in the second quarter. Dallas will have one last possession before it receives the second half kickoff. Did you know York is dating a Cowboys cheerleader? Chase Brown took a swing pass from Joe Burrow to the house and celebrated his score by jumping into the Salvation Army kettle behind the end zone. Though the running back was initially declared out of bounds at the 3-yard line, the call was overturned after a review. The touchdown gave Cincinnati its first lead of the game. The Bengals lead, 13-10, with 3:30 left in the first half. Over on \"The Simpsons\" alt-cast, Lisa Simpson — who displayed her athletic abilities as a hockey goalie in the episode \"Lisa on Ice\" — came into the game for the Bengals as the running back and took Joe Burrow's pass to the end zone. Dallas is unable to take full advantage of the good field position when its drive stalls at the Bengals' 17-yard line. Brandon Aubrey knocks through a 35-yard field goal to make it 10-7 Cowboys with 6:23 left in the second quarter. The Bengals opted to go for it facing a fourth-and-3 in Dallas territory. DeMarvion Overshown managed to break forward to defend Joe Burrow's touch pass attempt to running back Chase Brown, which fell to the ground incomplete. The Cowboys will take over near midfield with just under 10 minutes to go in the first half. On the first play of the second quarter, Cooper Rush's pass attempt was tipped by cornerback Cam Taylor-Britt and intercepted by Geno Stone inside the Bengals' 5-yard line. Cincinnati takes over on its own 4 five seconds into the period. Dallas and Cincinnati are knotted at one score apiece after 15 minutes, but the Cowboys will have second-and-10 from the Bengals' 12-yard line to start the second quarter. After CeeDee Lamb caught a screen pass behind the line of scrimmage, Bengals linebacker Germaine Pratt got his hands on the receiver almost immediately. The veteran wideout was able to escape the tackle and ran across the width of the field before turning upfield for a massive gain. The play brought the Cowboys from their own 33-yard line to just outside of the red zone with less than two minutes left in the first quarter. Bengals quarterback Joe Burrow marched his team down the field on an 11-play, 70-yard drive that concluded with Ja'Marr Chase hauling in a contested catch in the end zone. It's the wideout's seventh touchdown in his last four games. This game is tied, 7-7, with 2:45 remaining in the first quarter. Over on \"The Simpsons\" alt-cast, Bart Simpson enters the game to play quarterback for the Bengals and throws a touchdown pass to Ralph Wiggum, who somehow got position for the reception against the Cowboys' Pro Bowl cornerback DaRon Bland. Bart Simpson has shown significant improvement at the position ever since his infamous tenure as a quarterback in the episode \"Bart Star.\" After a three-and-out by the Bengals' offense, Cowboys quarterback Cooper Rush led a nine-play, 60-yard touchdown drive to open the scoring. Rush found Lamb in the back-right corner of the end zone on a fourth-and-1 play from the Cincinnati 11-yard line. Over on \"The Simpsons\" alt-cast, quarterback Homer Simpson came in to connect with Lamb for the touchdown play. The Bengals head south to AT&T Stadium in Arlington, Texas, to take on the Cowboys in prime time on Monday night. ESPN again is the broadcast home of \"Monday Night Football.\" The longtime team of Joe Buck (play-by-play) and Troy Aikman (color) will be on the call, with Lisa Salters adding reports from the sideline.

Welcome to 2024 and this battle of the streaming wars, as Disney and ESPN unveil its most alternative alt-cast for \"Monday Night Football\" as the Cowboys host the Bengals. “We were just so lucky also that the Cowboys are sort of like a Homer Simpson-type team, American team, and Mike McCarthy might be a Homer-type guy, one might imagine,” “The Simpsons” showrunner Matt Selman said on a conference call last week. “And then you have Joe Burrow on the other side who is a cool young, spiky-haired, blonde bad boy – he's like Bart. And that fits our character archetypes so perfectly.” — Chris Bumbaca Here's how the USA TODAY Sports staff feels the Cowboys vs. Bengals \"MNF\" matchup will sway: The Bengals are favorites to defeat the Cowboys, according to the BetMGM NFL odds. Not interested in this game? Check out expert picks and best bets for every NFL game this week. Dak Prescott suffered a partial hamstring avulsion – a tear during which part of the tendon rips off the bone – during Dallas' 27-21 loss to the Falcons in Week 9. He told reporters after the contest that he wasn't sure if the injury occurred while he was running or being tackled. \"It's something I’ve never felt,\" Prescott said while describing the injury. \"I saw the medical team and asked could I make it worse. At that point they said I wouldn’t be able to protect myself and made the call to hold me out.\" According to BetMGM Sportsbook, the Cowboys have +3000 odds to to make the playoffs entering Week 14. That implied probability gives Dallas a 3.23% chance of qualifying for the postseason. That's greater than the estimated 1% chance that the New York Times gives the Cowboys to win their way into the postseason. That speaks to the fact that Dallas would likely need to win out and receive plenty of help to claw its way back into the NFC playoff race after a 3-7 start to the season. The Cowboys' five remaining opponents have a combined winning percentage of .508, per Tankathon. That makes Dallas' remaining schedule the 17th toughest of the NFL's 32 teams entering Week 14. The said, the Cowboys will face a test on \"Monday Night Football\" in Week 14 against a high-flying Cincinnati Bengals offense. Dallas will also end the season with two divisional games, so that will make it difficult to win out. That makes it easy to understand why oddsmakers aren't bullish the Cowboys' chances of making a playoff push, especially considering that they would need a team in front of them, like the Commanders, to falter. Below is a full look at Dallas' schedule: In the hunt: x – clinched playoff berth Should the Cowboys opt to move on from Mike McCarthy following the 2024 season, there are several options who could be targeted as next Dallas head coach: The Bengals travel to Jerry World on Monday night. The Week 14 “MNF” matchup will kick off at AT&T Stadium in Arlington, Texas. AT&T Stadium has hosted one Super Bowl — Super Bowl XLV between the Green Bay Packers and Pittsburgh Steelers. It also was the host site for the 2018 NFL draft. The stadium also hosted the first College Football Playoff national championship game in 2015, which was won by the Ohio State Buckeyes against the Oregon Ducks. ➤ Ranking NFL's stadiums from 1 to 30: Where does Cowboys' AT&T Stadium rate? The roof is closed at AT&T Stadium in Arlington, Texas, so weather will not be a factor in Monday night’s game. The New England Patriots and Pittsburgh Steelers are tied for the most Super Bowl wins with six. The Dallas Cowboys are tied with the San Francisco 49ers for the second-most Super Bowls titles with five. While the Cowboys have made eight Super Bowl appearances (tied for the second-most with the 49ers and Steelers), the team hasn't played for the NFL title since the 1995 season when it won Super Bowl XXX. The Cincinnati Bengals have made three Super Bowl appearances, the most recent being during the 2021 season when they lost to the Los Angeles Rams in Super Bowl 56.

Epic Games, the company responsible for Fortnite, agreed to pay money to settle FTC allegations related to in-game purchases. According to the FTC, the company unlawfully charged players for unwanted purchases, let children rack up unauthorized charges without their parents’ permission, and blocked some users who disputed wrongful charges from accessing their purchased content. The settlement also requires the company to get positive consent before charging users and banned it from locking players out of their accounts for disputing unauthorized charges.

Tags: The Federal Trade Commission is sending refunds totaling more than $72 million to consumers who were tricked by Epic Games, maker of the popular video game Fortnite, into making unwanted purchases. As part of a settlement first announced in December 2022, the FTC obtained an order requiring Epic Games to pay $245 million to resolve allegations that the game maker used design tactics known as dark patterns to trick players into making unwanted purchases, let children rack up unauthorized charges without any parental involvement, and blocked some users who disputed unauthorized charges from accessing their purchased content. The FTC alleged that Fortnite’s counterintuitive, inconsistent, and confusing button configuration led players of all ages to incur unwanted charges based on the press of a single button. For example, players could be charged while attempting to wake the game from sleep mode, while the game was in a loading screen, or by pressing an adjacent button while attempting simply to preview an item. The FTC is sending its first round of payments in this matter and will distribute additional money at a later date. Today, the FTC is sending 629,344 total payments, about half of which are PayPal payments and the other half are checks. Consumers selected their payment method when they completed their claim form. Recipients should redeem their PayPal payment within 30 days and cash their checks within 90 days, as indicated on the check. The average payment is about $114. Consumers who have questions about their payment should contact the refund administrator, Rust Consulting, Inc., at 1-833-915-0880 or by email at admin@fortniterefund.com, or visit the FTC website to view frequently asked questions about the refund process. The Commission never requires people to pay money or provide account information to get a refund. Eligible consumers can still submit a claim online. The claim form is available at www.ftc.gov/fortnite. The Commission’s interactive dashboards for refund data provide a state-by-state breakdown of refunds in FTC cases. In 2023, FTC actions led to $330 million in refunds to consumers across the country. The Federal Trade Commission works to promote competition and protect and educate consumers. The FTC will never demand money, make threats, tell you to transfer money, or promise you a prize.

                "content": "The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) has started distributing refunds totaling more than $72 million to players impacted by Fortnite's billing practices. This refund follows a $245-million settlement with Fortnite developer Epic Games, announced in December 2022, over allegations that the game maker used \"dark patterns\" to trick players into unwanted purchases. The FTC alleged that Fortnite's design caused players to incur unwanted charges through misleading and confusing button configurations. These included charges occurring during sleep mode, on loading screens, or while previewing items. FTC chair Lina Khan wrote on X, formerly Twitter, Monday that the company had been \"tricking players.\" \"The @FTC previously ordered Epic Games to pay $245 million for tricking players into making unwanted purchases & letting kids rack up unauthorized charges,\" she wrote. \"We are now sending the first round of refunds totaling more than $72 million to those harmed.\" Epic Games acknowledged the settlement in a 2022 statement, saying, \"No developer creates a game with the intention of ending up here,\" but denied it had broken the law. \"Statutes written decades ago don't specify how gaming ecosystems should operate,\" the company said in the statement. \"The laws have not changed, but their application has evolved and long-standing industry practices are no longer enough. We accepted this agreement because we want Epic to be at the forefront of consumer protection and provide the best experience for our players.\" In a statement to Newsweek, FTC spokesperson Juliana Gruenwald Henderson said that this was just the first round of payments, \"additional money will be distributed later. People can still submit a claim if they haven't done so already through January 10,\" she said. Newsweek has contacted Epic Games via social media for comment. Refunds are being sent to 629,344 claimants in the form of PayPal payments or checks, with the average payout approximately $114. Eligible consumers who missed the October 2024 filing deadline can still file claims until January 10, 2025. Players eligible for a refund must meet specific criteria and file a claim online. You may qualify for a refund if you were charged for unwanted items between January 2017 and September 2022, your child made unauthorized charges between January 2017 and November 2018, or your Fortnite account was locked after disputing wrongful charges. Claims can be filed at www.ftc.gov/fortnite or www.fortniterefund.com/file-a-claim. Claimants need either a claim number or their Epic Account ID. If you are under 18, a parent or guardian must submit the claim on your behalf. No fees are required to apply, and the FTC has warned against scams asking for payments to process refunds. Refund payments will be delivered through the payment method selected when filing the claim. PayPal payments must be redeemed within 30 days, while checks must be cashed within 90 days. Consumers with questions can contact Rust Consulting, the refund administrator, at 1-833-915-0880 or email admin@fortniterefund.com.

This week on Bella-stone... Bella Hadid stunned Yellowstone viewers by making an unexpected cameo on the Dec. 8 episode of the Paramount+ series' final season alongside her professional cowboy boyfriend Adan Banuelos. The model played the role of Sadie, the girlfriend of horse trainer Travis Wheatley, who is played by series creator Taylor Sheridan. The 28-year-old first appeared in the episode answering the door in a cowboy hat and tank top at Travis' Texas ranch after Kelly Reilly's character Beth Dutton shows up for a horse auction and instead finds the group—which includes Adan—playing strip poker. In a subsequent scene, Beth questions why Sadie is dating Travis, who she deems \"misogynistic,\" \"condescending\" and \"the most arrogant man\" she's ever met. She also notes that he's 25 years older than Bella's character. After Sadie asks her if she's \"ever seen him ride before,\" the duo watches him get on a horse, which prompts Beth to admit, \"OK, yeah, I get it.\" Bella—who used to compete in equestrian competitions—put her own skills on display later in the episode when her character rides around during a horse auction at the Yellowstone ranch. Yellowstone viewers were stunned by the Real Housewives of Beverly Hills alum's cameo, with one person saying that it \"definitely wasn't on my 2024 bingo card.\" Another person joked that \"bella hadid takes that cowboy s--t for real serious cause why is she playing strip poker with taylor sheridan on yellowstone right now.\" A third user called it \"objectively hilarious\" that Yellowstone's creator cast a model as his character's girlfriend on the show. Bella's cowgirl cameo comes over a year into her relationship with Adan, who she was first linked to when they were spotted making out with one another in October 2023. The Victoria's Secret model made thie relationship Instagram official back in February. Just a couple months later, she revealed that she'd moved to Texas—where Adan lives—after becoming disillusioned with modeling. \"After 10 years of modeling,\" Bella told Allure in April, \"I realized I was putting so much energy and love and effort into something that, in the long run, wasn't necessarily giving it back to me.\" The couple did return to New York for an appearance together, though, when they rode horses alongside one another outside of the Horse Sense premiere in Manhattan. \"My love brought Texas to NYC,\" Bella captioned an Instagram carousel post from the event Sept. 17. \"Lucky me.\" Keep reading for the fate of other fan-favorite shows amid Yellowstone's final season.

                "title": "Bella Hadid Showed Up on ‘Yellowstone’ For Some Reason",
                "content": "Manage your account WE'RE IN CRUNCH time on what just may be the final season of Yellowstone; the only episode left to air is season 5, episode 14, which just might be the series finale (though Paramount Network's marketing has yet to refer to it as that). There are several storylines still open, several mysteries still to be solved, and several characters desperately needing closure. So, with time running out, what does Yellowstone co-creator and showrunner Taylor Sheridan do? Well, of course, he gives the character played by Taylor Sheridan a whole bunch of screen time and a never-before-seen girlfriend played by a famous supermodel, that's what! Look, guys. At this point, you have to kind of realize that with Yellowstone, this is part of the deal. Sheridan is without a doubt a talented screenwriter; his work on movies like Sicario and Hell or High Water proved that without question. If you want tightly-crafted TV stories from Taylor Sheridan, you can look to something like Lioness or the Yellowstone spinoffs 1883 and 1923. For the last couple years, Sheridan has treated Yellowstone kind of like his free jazz project, with storylines and character beats that come out of nowhere and stop as quickly as they start. He's trying things, and doing whatever he wants—and, look, he made this show into a massive hit, so who could blame him? Sheridan's character on Yellowstone is Travis Wheatley, a famous horse trainer and friend of Rip (Cole Hauser) who's been a recurring character on the show since the very first season. He's always popped in and out, but in season 5, episode 13, titled \"Give the World Away,\" we get to see more of Travis than ever before as Beth travels to his ranch as they try to get his help to sell the Dutton Ranch horses for as much as they possibly can. We already knew that Travis was an expert-level horse trainer, but our extended screen time in this episode showed that he also owns and runs his own ranch, plays a seemingly-constant game of strip poker with younger women in various states of undress, is an expert showman and deceptive salesman, and has a girlfriend played by supermodel Bella Hadid. To Sheridan's credit, while he does write his own character as essentially the best and coolest guy in the world, he does at least make Beth (Kelly Reilly) skeptical. While watching Travis ride and showcase the horses being sold, she asks Sadie (the Bella Hadid character) what, exactly she's doing; he's arrogant, condescending, misogynistic, and 25 years older than her. What is the deal? Sadie doesn't hesitate, and also doesn't deny anything Beth said. But she tells her exactly what it is she is drawn to: he's one hell of a horse-rider. And they both look on in awe, unable to deny his talent there. Ok then! Ultimately, Travis proves to be not only a great horse rider and salesman, but—after messing with Beth a little—a good guy who's willing to help out with the Dutton Ranch firesale. By the end of the episode, they've sold off all of their cattle, horses, and assets, making up $30 million, much thanks to Travis without a doubt. While we'll have to wait for the Yellowstone finale to learn the fate of the Duttons and the Yellowstone ranch, we can be sure of one thing: Travis is living the good life. If you thought Travis's girlfriend, Sadie, on Yellowstone looked familiar, that's because she's played by Bella Hadid—one of the most famous supermodels in the world. At the moment she has 61.5 million Instagram followers. If you're wondering why Bella Hadid made a random surprise guest appearance on Yellowstone as Travis's girlfriend, well, that's a pretty good question. But we've also got a pretty good answer. Bella Hadid's current boyfriend, Adan Banuelos, is a cowboy and horse-trainer in real life—and he also made a cameo in season 5, episode 13 of Yellowstone, as one of the dudes playing in Travis's strip poker game. Since the duo have been dating in the last year and change, she's shown up at all sorts of rodeo and horse-riding events, including at the 2024 American Performance Horseman competition that was held in Arlington, Texas back in March. In addition to her Western swing, Hadid has also begun dabbling in acting. While she's an experienced model and has previously appeared in music videos, she made her TV debut back in 2022 when she played a character named Lena in the third season of Hulu's acclaimed series Ramy. We know that Taylor Sheridan is good to his actors—maybe we'll see her again in one of his shows soon?

Following a flurry of deaths on the show in recent weeks, the supermodel played the girlfriend of Travis Wheatley, a horse trainer portrayed by series creator Taylor Sheridan, who has appeared in nearly a dozen episodes during the show’s run. The pair’s interaction in the series’ penultimate episode before the finale definitely raised viewers’ eyebrows. So, what exactly happened? Hadid first appeared on the episode when Beth Dutton, played by Kelly Reilly, pays Travis a visit. She was taken aback, though, by Hadid’s character, Sadie, who opens the door. “You the masseuse?” Sadie asks, to which Beth fires back, “Do I look like a f------ masseuse?” “A very expensive one,” Sadie replies. Beth walks into the house and sees Travis engaged in a game of strip poker with a bunch of people, including one person played by Hadid’s real-life boyfriend, Adan Banuelos. Beth yells at Travis to go to a horse auction he is hosting where buyers are waiting, which is what brought her to Texas. Beth and Sadie interact again at the auction when Beth, who calls him “the most arrogant I’ve ever met in my life,” asks why Sadie is interested in Travis in the first place. “You ever seen him ride before?” Sadie asks. “OK, yeah, I get it,” Beth responds after watching him in the ring. Hadid appears again in the episode when she’s seen riding a horse. Hadid's role certainly had people talking on X, where the reactions ran the gamut. “Taylor Sheridan making Bella Hadid his girlfriend in ‘Yellowstone’ is objectively hilarious” one person wrote. “Taylor Sheridan writing in Bella Hadid as his girlfriend on Yellowstone is hilarious by the way (realest thing he’s ever done)” another person joked. “Bella Hadid on Yellowstone is the greatest addition to the show,” someone else commented. “I didn’t think Yellowstone could get any better … then I saw Bella Hadid,” another user raved. Other fans commented on Sheridan's appearance. Sheridan began his career as an actor, so stepping in front of the camera isn’t exactly new fare for him. In fact, he has made three appearances as Army Delta Force operator Cody Spears on “Lionness,” another Paramount+ series he created. But \"Yellowstone\" viewers used his appearance to comment on the direction the show is going in under his leadership. “I’ve got to believe that Taylor Sheridan is just as arrogant and obnoxious in real life as is his character on #Yellowstone. I’m not sure he’s acting,” someone chided. “All the abandoned plot-lines and people are still praising Taylor Sheridan like this isn’t the worst last season ever possible for Yellowstone. The show is garbage now,” another person criticized. “The Taylor Sheridan Midlife Crisis Episodes. I know it’s his show but this?? We’ve seen him numerous times on the show work with his horses and now we see his half naked juiced self? Very selfish of him to hog time from the real cast we care about,” a different viewer wrote. In May 2023, Paramount announced \"Yellowstone\" would end after its fifth and final season, although Sheridan is helming other ongoing spinoffs like \"1923.\" Drew Weisholtz is a reporter for TODAY Digital, focusing on pop culture, nostalgia and trending stories.
