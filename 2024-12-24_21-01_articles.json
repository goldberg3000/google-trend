                "content": "National Football League (1921–present) The Green Bay Packers are a professional American football team based in Green Bay, Wisconsin. The Packers compete in the National Football League (NFL) as a member of the National Football Conference (NFC) North division. They are the third-oldest franchise in the NFL, established in 1919,[11][12] and are the only non-profit, community-owned major league professional sports team based in the United States.[a][13] Since 1957, home games have been played at Lambeau Field. They hold the record for the most wins in NFL history.[14][15] The Packers are the last of the \"small-town teams\" that were common in the NFL during the league's early days of the 1920s and 1930s.[16] Founded in 1919 by Earl \"Curly\" Lambeau and George Whitney Calhoun, the franchise traces its lineage to other semi-professional teams in Green Bay dating back to 1896. Between 1919 and 1920, the Packers competed against other semi-pro clubs from around Wisconsin and the Midwest, before joining the American Professional Football Association (APFA), the forerunner of today's NFL, in 1921. In 1933, the Packers began playing part of their home slate in Milwaukee until changes at Lambeau Field in 1995 made it more lucrative to stay in Green Bay full-time; Milwaukee is still considered a home media market for the team.[17][18][19] Although Green Bay is the smallest major league professional sports market in North America,[a][20] Forbes ranked the Packers as the world's 27th-most-valuable sports franchise in 2019, with a value of $2.63 billion.[21] The Packers have won 13 league championships, the most in NFL history, with nine pre-Super Bowl NFL titles and four Super Bowl victories. The Packers, under coach Vince Lombardi, won the first two Super Bowls in 1966 and 1967; they were the only NFL team to defeat the American Football League (AFL) before the AFL–NFL merger. After Lombardi retired, the Super Bowl trophy was named for him, but the team struggled through the 1970s and 1980s. Since 1993, the team has enjoyed much regular-season success, making the playoffs 23 times and winning two Super Bowls in 1996 under head coach Mike Holmgren and 2010 under head coach Mike McCarthy.[22][23] The Packers have the most wins (826) and the second-highest win–loss record (.571) in NFL history, including both regular season and playoff games.[24][25][26] The Packers are longstanding adversaries of the Chicago Bears, Minnesota Vikings, and Detroit Lions, who today form the NFL's NFC North division (formerly known as the NFC Central Division). They have played more than 100 games against each of those teams, and have a winning overall record against all of them, a distinction only shared with the Kansas City Chiefs, Dallas Cowboys, and Miami Dolphins. The Bears–Packers rivalry is one of the oldest rivalries in U.S. professional sports history, dating to 1921. The Green Bay Packers were founded on August 11, 1919,[1] by former high-school football rivals Earl \"Curly\" Lambeau and George Whitney Calhoun.[27] Lambeau solicited funds for uniforms from his employer, the Indian Packing Company, a meat packing company.[28] He was given $500 ($8,800 today) for uniforms and equipment, on the condition that the team be named after its sponsor.[29] The Green Bay Packers have played in their original city longer than any other team in the NFL. On August 27, 1921, the Packers were granted a franchise in the American Professional Football Association, a new national pro football league that had been formed the previous year. The APFA changed its name to the National Football League a year later. Financial troubles plagued the team, and the franchise was forfeited within the year before Lambeau found new financial backers and regained the franchise the next year. These backers, known as \"The Hungry Five\", formed the Green Bay Football Corporation.[30] After a near-miss in 1927, Lambeau's squad claimed the Packers' first NFL title in 1929 with an undefeated 12–0–1 campaign, behind a stifling defense which registered eight shutouts.[31] Green Bay would repeat as league champions in 1930 and 1931, bettering teams from New York, Chicago and throughout the league, with all-time greats and future Hall of Famers Mike Michalske, Johnny (Blood) McNally, Cal Hubbard and Green Bay native Arnie Herber.[32][33] Among the many impressive accomplishments of these years was the Packers' streak of 29 consecutive home games without defeat, an NFL record which still stands.[34] The arrival of the end Don Hutson from Alabama in 1935 gave Lambeau and the Packers the most feared and dynamic offensive weapon in the game. Credited with inventing pass patterns, Hutson would lead the league in receptions in eight seasons and spur the Packers to NFL championships in 1936, 1939 and 1944. An Iron Man, Hutson played both ways, leading the league in interceptions as a safety in 1940. Hutson claimed 18 NFL records when he retired in 1945, many of which still stand.[35] In 1951, his number 14 was the first to be retired by the Packers, and he was inducted as a charter member of the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 1963.[36][37] After Hutson's retirement, Lambeau could not stop the Packers' slide. He purchased a large lodge near Green Bay for team members and families to live in. Rockwood Lodge was the home of the 1946–49 Packers. The 1947 and 1948 seasons produced a record of 12–10–1, and 1949 was even worse at 3–9. The lodge burned down on January 24, 1950, and insurance money paid for many of the Packers' debts.[38] Curly Lambeau departed after the 1949 season. Gene Ronzani and Lisle Blackbourn could not coach the Packers back to their former magic, even as a new stadium was unveiled in 1957.[39][40] The losing would descend to the disastrous 1958 campaign under coach Ray \"Scooter\" McLean, whose lone 1–10–1 year at the helm is the worst in Packers history.[41] Former New York Giants assistant Vince Lombardi was hired as Packers head coach and general manager on February 2, 1959.[42] Few suspected the hiring represented the beginning of a remarkable, immediate turnaround. Under Lombardi, the Packers would become the team of the 1960s, winning five championships over seven years, including victories in the first two Super Bowls. During the Lombardi era, the stars of the Packers' offense included Bart Starr, Jim Taylor, Carroll Dale, Paul Hornung (as halfback and placekicker), Forrest Gregg, and Jerry Kramer. The defense included Willie Davis, Henry Jordan, Willie Wood, Ray Nitschke, Dave Robinson, and Herb Adderley. The Packers' first regular-season game under Lombardi was on September 27, 1959, a 9–6 victory over the Chicago Bears in Green Bay. After winning their first three, the Packers lost the next five before finishing strong by sweeping their final four. The 7–5 record represented the Packers' first winning season since 1947, enough to earn rookie head coach Lombardi the NFL Coach of the Year.[43][44] The next year, the Packers, led by Paul Hornung's 176 points, won the NFL West title and played in the NFL Championship against the Philadelphia Eagles at Philadelphia.[45][46] In a see-saw game, the Packers trailed by only four points when All-Pro Eagle linebacker Chuck Bednarik tackled Jim Taylor just nine yards short of the goal line as time expired.[47] The Packers returned to the NFL Championship game the following season and faced the New York Giants in the first league title game to be played in Green Bay. The Packers scored 24-second-quarter points, including a championship-record 19 by Paul Hornung, on special \"loan\" from the Army (one touchdown, four extra points, and three field goals), powering the Packers to a 37–0 rout of the Giants, their first NFL Championship since 1944.[48][49] It was in 1961 that Green Bay became known as \"Titletown\".[50] The Packers stormed back in the 1962 season, jumping out to a 10–0 start on their way to a 13–1 season.[51] This consistent level of success would lead to Lombardi's Packers becoming one of the most prominent teams of their era, and to be featured as the face of the NFL on the cover of Time on December 21, 1962, as part of the magazine's cover story on \"The Sport of the '60s\".[52] Shortly after Time's article, the Packers faced the Giants in a much more brutal championship game than the previous year, but the Packers prevailed on the kicking of Jerry Kramer and the determined running of Jim Taylor. The Packers defeated the Giants in New York, 16–7.[53] The 1963 team went 11–2–1 but finished second in the NFL West.[54] The 1964 went 8–5–1 and finished second in the NFL West.[55] The Packers returned to the championship game in 1965 following a two-year absence when they defeated the Colts in a playoff for the Western Conference title.[56] That game would be remembered for Don Chandler's controversial tying field goal in which the ball allegedly went wide right, but the officials signaled \"good\".[57] The 13–10 overtime win earned the Packers a trip to the NFL Championship game, where Hornung and Taylor ran through the defending champion Cleveland Browns, helping the Packers win, 23–12, to earn their third NFL Championship under Lombardi and ninth overall.[58] Goalpost uprights would be made taller the next year.[59] The 1966 season saw the Packers led to the first-ever Super Bowl by MVP quarterback Bart Starr.[60] The team went 12–2, and as time wound down in the NFL Championship against the Dallas Cowboys, the Packers clung to a 34–27 lead.[61] Dallas had the ball on the Packers' two-yard line, threatening to tie the ballgame. But on fourth down the Packers' Tom Brown intercepted Don Meredith's pass in the end zone to seal the win.[62] The team crowned its season by rolling over the AFL champion Kansas City Chiefs 35–10 in Super Bowl I.[63] The 1967 season was the last for Lombardi as the Packers' head coach.[64] The NFL Championship game, a rematch of the 1966 contest against Dallas, became indelibly known as the \"Ice Bowl\" as a result of the brutally cold conditions at Lambeau Field.[65] Still the coldest NFL game ever played, it remains one of the most famous football games at any level in the history of the sport.[66] With 16 seconds left, Bart Starr's touchdown on a quarterback sneak brought the Packers a 21–17 victory and their still unequaled third straight NFL Championship.[67] They then won Super Bowl II with a 33–14 victory over the Oakland Raiders.[68] Lombardi stepped down as head coach after the game, and Phil Bengtson was named his successor.[69] Lombardi remained as general manager for one season but left in 1969 to become head coach and minority owner of the Washington Redskins.[70] After Lombardi died of cancer on September 3, 1970, the NFL renamed the Super Bowl trophy the Vince Lombardi Trophy in recognition of his accomplishments with the Packers.[71] The city of Green Bay renamed Highland Avenue in his honor in 1968, placing Lambeau Field at 1265 Lombardi Avenue ever since.[72] For about a quarter-century after Lombardi's departure, the Packers had relatively little on-field success. In the 24 seasons from 1968 to 1991, they had only five seasons with a winning record, one being the shortened 1982 strike season.[73][74] They appeared in the playoffs twice, with a 1–2 record. The period saw five different head coaches—Phil Bengtson, Dan Devine, Bart Starr, Forrest Gregg, and Lindy Infante—two of whom, Starr and Gregg, were Lombardi's era stars, while Bengtson was a former Packer coach. Each led the Packers to a worse record than his predecessor. Poor personnel decisions were rife, notoriously the 1974 trade by acting general manager Dan Devine which sent five 1975 or 1976 draft picks (two first-rounders, two-second-rounders and a third) to the Los Angeles Rams for aging quarterback John Hadl, who would spend only 11⁄2 seasons in Green Bay.[75] Another came in the 1989 NFL draft, when offensive lineman Tony Mandarich was taken with the second overall pick ahead of future Hall of Fame inductees Barry Sanders, Derrick Thomas, and Deion Sanders.[76] Though rated highly by nearly every professional scout at the time, Mandarich's performance failed to meet expectations, earning him ESPN's ranking as the third \"biggest sports flop\" in the last 25 years.[77] The Packers' performance in the 1970s, 1980s, and early 1990s led to a shakeup, with Ron Wolf hired as general manager and given full control of the team's football operations to start the 1991 season.[78] In 1992, Wolf hired San Francisco 49ers offensive coordinator Mike Holmgren as the Packers' new head coach.[79] Soon afterward, Wolf acquired quarterback Brett Favre from the Atlanta Falcons for a first-round pick.[80] Favre got the Packers their first win of the 1992 season, stepping in for injured quarterback Don Majkowski and leading a comeback over the Cincinnati Bengals.[81] He started the following week, a win against the Pittsburgh Steelers, and never missed another start for Green Bay through the end of the 2007 season. He would go on to break the record for consecutive starts by an NFL quarterback, starting 297 consecutive games including stints with the New York Jets and Minnesota Vikings with the streak finally coming to an end late in the 2010 season.[82] The Packers had a 9–7 record in 1992 and began to turn heads around the league when they signed perhaps the most prized free agent in NFL history in Reggie White on the defense in 1993.[83] White believed that Wolf, Holmgren, and Favre had the team heading in the right direction with a \"total commitment to winning\". With White on board, the Packers made it to the second round of the playoffs during both the 1993 and 1994 seasons but lost their 2nd-round matches to their playoff rival, the Dallas Cowboys, playing in Dallas on both occasions.[84][85] In 1995, the Packers won the NFC Central Division championship for the first time since 1972. After a home playoff 37–20 win against Favre's former team, the Atlanta Falcons, the Packers defeated the defending Super Bowl champion San Francisco 49ers 27–17 in San Francisco on the road to advance to the NFC Championship Game, where they lost again to the Dallas Cowboys 38–27.[86][87] In 1996, the Packers' turnaround was complete. The team posted a league-best 13–3 record in the regular season, dominating the competition and securing home-field advantage throughout the playoffs.[88] They were ranked no. 1 in offense with Brett Favre leading the way, no. 1 in defense with Reggie White as the leader of the defense, and no. 1 in special teams with former Heisman Trophy winner Desmond Howard returning punts and kickoffs for touchdowns.[89] After relatively easy wins against the San Francisco 49ers in a muddy 35–14 beatdown and Carolina Panthers 30–13, the Packers advanced to the Super Bowl for the first time in 29 years. In Super Bowl XXXI, Green Bay defeated the New England Patriots 35–21 to win their 12th championship. Desmond Howard was named MVP of the game for his kickoff return for a touchdown that ended the Patriots' bid for a comeback.[90] Then-Packers president Bob Harlan credited Wolf, Holmgren, Favre, and White for ultimately changing the fortunes of the organization and turning the Green Bay Packers into a model NFL franchise. A 2007 panel of football experts at ESPN ranked the 1996 Packers the 6th-greatest team ever to play in the Super Bowl. The following season the Packers recorded another 13–3 record and won their second consecutive NFC championship.[91] After defeating the Tampa Bay Buccaneers 21–7 and San Francisco 49ers 23–10 in the playoffs, the Packers returned to the Super Bowl as an 11⁠1/2⁠ point favorite. The team ended up losing in an upset to John Elway and the Denver Broncos in Super Bowl XXXII, by the score of 31–24.[92] In 1998, the Packers went 11–5 and met the San Francisco 49ers in the first round of the NFC playoffs. It was the fourth consecutive year these teams had met in the playoffs and the sixth overall contest since the 1995 season. The Packers had won all previous games, and the media speculated that another 49ers loss would result in the dismissal of San Francisco head coach Steve Mariucci. Unlike the previous playoff matches, this game was hotly contested, with the teams frequently exchanging leads. With 4:19 left in the 4th quarter, Brett Favre and the Packers embarked on an 89-yard drive, which concluded with a Favre touchdown pass to receiver Antonio Freeman. This play appeared to give Green Bay the victory. But San Francisco quarterback Steve Young led the 49ers on an improbable touchdown drive, which culminated when Terrell Owens caught Young's pass between several defenders to give the 49ers a lead with three seconds remaining. Afterward, the game was mired in controversy. Many argued that during the 49ers game-winning drive, Niners receiver Jerry Rice fumbled the ball but officials stated he was down by contact. Television replays confirmed the fumble, but referees were unable to review the play; the next season the NFL reinstituted an instant replay system.[93] In the end, this game turned out to be the end of an era in Green Bay. Days later Mike Holmgren left the Packers to become vice president, general manager, and head coach of the Seattle Seahawks. Much of Holmgren's coaching staff went with him, and Reggie White also retired after the season (but later played one season for the Carolina Panthers in 2000). In 1999, the team struggled to find an identity after the departure of so many of the individuals responsible for their Super Bowl run. Ray Rhodes was hired in 1999 as the team's new head coach.[94] Rhodes had served around the league as a highly regarded defensive coordinator and more recently experienced moderate success as head coach of the Philadelphia Eagles from 1995 to 1998. Ron Wolf believed that Rhodes' experience and player-friendly demeanor would fit nicely in Green Bay's veteran locker room, but Rhodes was fired after one 8–8 season.[95] Wolf visited team practice late in the 1999 season and believed that players had become too comfortable with Rhodes' style, and said the atmosphere resembled a country club. In 2000, Wolf replaced Rhodes with Mike Sherman.[96] Sherman had never been a head coach at any level of football and was relatively unknown in NFL circles. He had only coached in professional football for three years starting as the Packers' tight ends coach in 1997 and 1998. In 1999, he followed Mike Holmgren to Seattle and became the Seahawks' offensive coordinator, although Sherman did not call the plays during games. Despite Sherman's apparent anonymity, Wolf was blown away in the interview process by the coach's organizational skills and attention to detail. Sherman's inaugural season started slowly, but the Packers won their final four games to achieve a 9–7 record. Brett Favre praised the atmosphere Sherman had cultivated in Green Bay's locker room and fans were optimistic about the team's future. In the offseason, however, Wolf suddenly announced his own resignation as general manager to take effect after the April 2001 draft. Packers' president Bob Harlan was surprised by Wolf's decision and felt unsure of how to replace him. Harlan preferred the structure Green Bay had employed since 1991; a general manager who ran football operations and hired a subservient head coach. But with the momentum and locker room chemistry that was built during the 2000 season, Harlan was reluctant to bring in a new individual with a potentially different philosophy. Wolf recommended that Harlan give the job to Sherman. Though Harlan was wary of the structure in principle, he agreed with Wolf that it was the best solution. In 2001, Sherman assumed the duties of both general manager and head coach. From 2001 to 2004, Sherman coached the Packers to respectable regular-season success, led by the spectacular play of Brett Favre, Ahman Green, and a formidable offensive line. But Sherman's teams faltered in the playoffs. Before 2003, the Packers had never lost a home playoff game since the NFL instituted a post-season in 1933 (they were 13–0, with 11 of the wins at Lambeau and two more in Milwaukee.). That ended on January 4, 2003, when the Atlanta Falcons defeated the Packers 27–7 in an NFC Wild Card game. The Packers would also lose at home in the playoffs to the Minnesota Vikings two years later. By the end of the 2004 season, the Packers' team depth appeared to be diminishing. Sherman also seemed overworked and reportedly had trouble communicating with players on the practice field with whom he was also negotiating contracts. Harlan felt the dual roles were too much for one man to handle and removed Sherman from the general manager position in early 2005 while retaining him as a head coach. Harlan hired the Seattle Seahawks' vice president of operations Ted Thompson as the new executive vice president, general manager, and director of football operations. The relationship between Thompson and Sherman appeared strained, as Thompson immediately began rebuilding Green Bay's roster. Following a dismal 4–12 season, Thompson fired Sherman.[97] In 2006, Thompson hired Mike McCarthy, the former offensive coordinator for the San Francisco 49ers and New Orleans Saints, as his new head coach.[98] McCarthy had also previously served as the quarterbacks coach for the Packers in 1999. In McCarthy's debut year coaching the Packers, the team began the season with a 4–8 record. Then, Brett Favre sustained injuries, as did the backup quarterback, Aaron Rodgers. Despite the injuries, McCarthy coached the team to four consecutive wins, finishing with an 8–8 record.[99][100] After missing the playoffs in 2006, Brett Favre announced that he would return for the 2007 season; under McCarthy, it would turn out to be one of his best.[101] The Packers won 10 of their first 11 games and finished 13–3, earning a first-round bye in the playoffs. That was sufficient to propel McCarthy to secure the best record among active coaches through their first 25 games.[102] The Packers' passing offense, led by Favre and a very skilled wide receiver group, finished second in the NFC, behind the Dallas Cowboys, and third overall in the league. Running back Ryan Grant, acquired for a sixth-round draft pick from the New York Giants, became the featured back in Green Bay and rushed for 956 yards and 8 touchdowns in the final 10 games of the regular season. In the divisional playoff round, in a heavy snowstorm, the Packers beat the Seattle Seahawks 42–20. Grant rushed for 201 yards and three touchdowns, while Favre tossed an additional three touchdown passes to receiver Donald Driver (as well as a snowball, which Favre memorably threw at Driver in celebration).[103] On January 20, 2008, Green Bay appeared in their first NFC Championship Game in 10 years facing the New York Giants in Green Bay. The game was lost 23–20 on an overtime field goal by Lawrence Tynes. This would be Brett Favre's final game as a Green Bay Packer with his final pass being an interception in overtime.[104] Mike McCarthy coached the NFC team during the 2008 Pro Bowl in Hawaii. Al Harris and Aaron Kampman were also picked to play for the NFC Pro Bowl team as starters. Donald Driver was named as a third-string wideout on the Pro Bowl roster. Brett Favre was named the first-string quarterback for the NFC, but he declined to play in the Pro Bowl and was replaced on the roster by Tampa Bay quarterback Jeff Garcia. The Packers also had several first alternates, including offensive tackle Chad Clifton and linebacker Nick Barnett. In December 2007, Ted Thompson was signed to a 5-year contract extension with the Packers.[105] In addition, on February 5, 2008, head coach Mike McCarthy signed a 5-year contract extension.[106] On March 4, 2008, Brett Favre announced his retirement.[107] Within five months, however, he filed for reinstatement with the NFL on July 29. Favre's petition was granted by Commissioner Roger Goodell, effective August 4, 2008.[108] On August 6, 2008, it was announced that Brett Favre was traded to the New York Jets for a conditional draft pick in 2009.[109] The Packers began their 2008 season with their 2005 first-round draft pick, quarterback Aaron Rodgers, under center, as the first QB other than Favre to start for the Packers in 16 years. Rodgers played well in his first year starting for the Packers, throwing for over 4,000 yards and 28 touchdowns. However, injuries plagued the Packers' defense, as they lost 7 close games by 4 points or fewer, finishing with a 6–10 record.[110] After the season, eight assistant coaches were dismissed by the organization, including Bob Sanders, the team's defensive coordinator, who was replaced by Dom Capers.[111] In March 2009, the organization assured fans that Brett Favre's jersey number would be retired, but not during the 2009 season. In April 2009, the Packers selected nose tackle B. J. Raji of Boston College as the team's first pick in the draft. The team then traded three draft picks (including the pick the Packers acquired from the Jets for Brett Favre) for another first-round pick, selecting linebacker Clay Matthews III of the University of Southern California. During the 2009 NFL season, two matchups between the franchise and its former quarterback Brett Favre were highly anticipated after Favre's arrival with the division-rival Vikings in August. The first encounter took place in Week 4, on a Monday Night Football game that broke several TV audience records. The scheduling of this game was made possible when Baseball Commissioner and Packer board of directors member Bud Selig forced baseball's Minnesota Twins to play 2 games within 12 hours. The Vikings won the game 30–23. Brett Favre threw 3 TDs, no interceptions, and had a passer rating of 135.[112] The teams met for a second time in Week 8, Favre leading the Vikings to a second win, 38–26, in Green Bay. Rodgers was heavily pressured in both games, being sacked 14 times total, but still played well, throwing five touchdowns and only one interception. The next week, the Packers were upset by the winless Tampa Bay Buccaneers. Following a players-only meeting, the team found some stability on the offensive line with the return of right tackle Mark Tauscher bringing a minor halt to sacks to Rodgers and opening the running game to Ryan Grant and the other running backs. Green Bay finished the season strongly, winning 7 out of their last 8 games, including winning their 16th regular-season finale in the past 17 seasons, and earning an NFC wild-card playoff bid with an 11–5 regular-season record.[113] The Packers defense was ranked No. 2 and the offense was ranked No. 6 with rookies Brad Jones and Clay Matthews III becoming sensations at linebacker and young players like James Jones, Brandon Jackson, Jermichael Finley and Jordy Nelson becoming threats on offense. Rodgers also became the first quarterback in NFL history to throw for at least 4,000 yards in each of his first two seasons as a starter. Also, cornerback Charles Woodson won NFL Defensive Player of the Year honors after recording 9 interceptions, forcing four fumbles, 3 touchdowns, and registering 74 tackles and 2 sacks. In fact, Woodson's 9 interceptions were more than the 8 collected by all Packer opponents that season. Though the defense was ranked high, injuries to Al Harris, Tramon Williams, Will Blackmon, Atari Bigby and Brandon Underwood severely limited the depth of the secondary and teams like the Minnesota Vikings and Pittsburgh Steelers used that to their advantage by unleashing aerial assaults against inexperienced players with the NFL's best receivers. The season ended with an overtime loss in a wild card round shootout at the Arizona Cardinals, 51–45.[114] It was the second time McCarthy led the Packers to the postseason.[115] While they weren't as successful as their 90s counterparts in the postseason, the 2000s were by no means a dark time for the Packers.[116] The team finished the decade with the 5th highest winning percentage.[117] The team lost Johnny Jolly to a season long suspension after he violated the NFL drug policy.[118] Their running corps suffered a blow when RB Ryan Grant sustained a season ending ankle injury in Week 1.[119] By the end of the season, the team had 16 people on injured reserve, including 7 starters: running back Ryan Grant, tight end Jermichael Finley, inside linebacker Nick Barnett, safety Morgan Burnett, inside linebacker Brandon Chillar, right tackle Mark Tauscher, and outside linebacker Brad Jones. Key injuries didn't stop Mike McCarthy's team from finishing the regular season with a 10–6 record.[120] In week 7, the team faced the Minnesota Vikings, then led by former Packers quarterback Brett Favre. Green Bay beat Favre's new team 28–24 when Favre's final pass to Randy Moss in the end zone flew incomplete. In week 17, the Packers clinched their playoff berth with a 10–3 victory over the Chicago Bears at Lambeau Field, aided in large part by Nick Collins' interception of Jay Cutler's throw that allowed Green Bay to run out the clock.[121][122] The Packers 10–6 record allowed them to clinch the No. 6 seed in the NFC playoffs. They first faced No. 3 seeded Philadelphia, winning 21–16. In the Divisional round, they defeated No. 1 seed Atlanta 48–21. They then played the Chicago Bears at Soldier Field in the NFC Championship Game—only the second playoff meeting between the two storied rivals (the other a 33–14 Chicago victory which sent them to the 1941 NFL Championship Game). McCarthy's Packers won 21–14 to move on to Super Bowl XLV, having secured a 3–0 record in the postseason.[123] On the evening before the Super Bowl, McCarthy had each player fitted for a championship ring.[124] Aware of the motivational tactic, team president Mark Murphy instructed his organization to begin designing the ring.[125] The following day on February 6, 2011, they defeated the AFC champion Pittsburgh Steelers 31–25, becoming the first No. 6 seed from the NFC to win a Super Bowl. It was the first time the Packers had won the Lombardi Trophy since 1996.[126] Aaron Rodgers was named Super Bowl MVP.[127][128] During Super Bowl XLV, McCarthy's team initially enjoyed a comfortable 21–3 lead over the Steelers. Then, Charles Woodson had to leave the game with a broken collarbone and the Steelers' Hines Ward found the endzone to make the score 21–10 by halftime. During the third quarter, Pittsburgh scored 7 more points to make the score 21–17. In the fourth quarter, Green Bay's Clay Matthews tackled Pittsburgh's Rashard Mendenhall, and Desmond Bishop recovered the ball for a key turnover.[129][130] In 2011, coming off their victory in Super Bowl XLV, the Packers won their first 13 games, eventually finishing the season 15–1. The 15 victories marked the franchise record for wins in a season and tied for the second-most regular-season wins in NFL history, behind only the 2007 Patriots who went 16–0. Following the season, Aaron Rodgers would be named the NFL's MVP, his first such award. During that year, McCarthy's offensive strategies aided Rodgers in throwing for 4,643 yards and 45 touchdowns.[131] These strategies also propelled the Packers to lead the NFL in scoring that year.[132] Despite receiving homefield advantage, Green Bay lost their first postseason game to eventual Super Bowl XLVI champion New York Giants, 37–20.[133] Finishing the 2012 season with an 11–5 record and their second straight division title, the Packers beat the Minnesota Vikings in the NFC wild-card round 24–10, but lost in the divisional round of the playoffs to the eventual NFC Champion San Francisco 49ers by a score of 45–31.[134] The Packers offense finished the season fifth in points and 11th in yards per game. Under McCarthy, Rodgers passed for 4,295 yards.[135] The defense finished 11th in points allowed and 22nd in yards allowed per game. The Packers topped the first-ever AP Pro32 rankings, a new pro football version of the AP Top 25 college football and basketball polls.[136] In 2013, the Packers started 5–2, leading up to a Week 9 match up against the Bears. It was in that game that the Packers lost Aaron Rodgers to a broken collarbone;[137] Rodgers would miss the next six games, during which the club would go 2–3–1 under three different quarterbacks: Seneca Wallace (injured during first start), Scott Tolzien (benched), and Matt Flynn. Despite having a 7–7–1 record, the Packers were still in a position to win the NFC North division, if they were able to win their final game. With Rodgers returning, the Packers managed to beat the Bears in a Week 9 rematch, 33–28. Finishing at 8–7–1, the Packers won their division and were awarded a home playoff game. It was the fifth consecutive time that McCarthy led his team to a playoff appearance.[138] However, despite Rodgers' return, the Packers would lose to the San Francisco 49ers 20–23 in the first round of the playoffs.[139] The Packers recorded their 700th victory, against the Bears, in Week 4.[140] The team went undefeated at home for the first time since the 2011 season; they also led the league in scoring, with 486 points, the second-most in franchise history. The 2014 season also marked the first time since 2009 that the team had a 4,000-yard passer, two 1,000-yard receivers, and a 1,000-yard rusher. McCarthy led an offense that finished sixth in the league in total offense.[141] After winning against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers in Week 16, McCarthy (99 wins) passed Hall of Famer Vince Lombardi (98) on the all-time wins list for the Packers.[142] Overall, the team went 12–4, clinching the No. 2 seed in the NFC and a fourth consecutive NFC North division title, making the playoffs for the sixth straight season, tying a franchise record. The Packers beat the Cowboys in the divisional round, advancing to the NFC Championship to face the Seattle Seahawks. After leading throughout most of regulation, the Packers lost 28–22 in a historic overtime rally by Seattle.[143] Following the season, quarterback Aaron Rodgers was named the league's Most Valuable Player for the second time.[144] During Week 2 of the preseason against the Pittsburgh Steelers, wide receiver Jordy Nelson caught an eight-yard pass from Aaron Rodgers but then fell to the turf without contact. A few days later, it was revealed that Nelson had torn his ACL. He would remain inactive for the rest of the 2015 season.[145] Even without Nelson, the Packers managed to get off to a 6–0 start, but the Packers then lost four of their next five games, falling to 7–4.[146] On December 3, against the Detroit Lions, the Packers quickly fell to a 20–0 deficit going into halftime. Green Bay started to make a comeback in the second half thanks to a touchdown by Davante Adams and a 27-yard touchdown run by Aaron Rodgers to bring the game within two points at 23–21. The Packers then got the ball back in their possession with 23 seconds left in the game. While attempting a \"lateral\" play, Rodgers was sacked with no time remaining but then a flag was thrown for a facemask penalty on Detroit. The Packers now had one more un-timed play, which Aaron Rodgers threw a 61-yard Hail Mary touchdown to tight end Richard Rodgers II.[147] It was the longest Hail Mary touchdown pass thrown in NFL history.[148] Up until week 14, McCarthy delegated playcalling duties to associate head coach Tom Clements. However, the team's struggling offense made McCarthy decide to take back play-calling duties. During that first game that McCarthy resumed play calling, the Packers ran the ball for 230 yards in 44 carries.[149] Green Bay then finished the season 10–6 and 2nd in the NFC North behind the Minnesota Vikings. The Packers beat the Washington Redskins in the NFC wild-card game to advance to the divisional round with the Arizona Cardinals. A similar play to tie the game against the Cardinals happened between Aaron Rodgers and Jeff Janis. Janis caught a 41-yard touchdown from Rodgers which sent the game into overtime. However, the Packers fell to Arizona 26–20, ending their season.[150] After a 4–6 start to the season, the Packers went on a six-game winning streak to finish the regular season with a 10–6 record. The team clinched the NFC North for the fifth time in six years with their Week 17 win over the Detroit Lions. After the regular season, the success of his team made McCarthy the fourth head coach in NFL history to guide his team to eight or more consecutive playoff appearances.[151] They routed the fifth-seeded New York Giants, 38–13, in the wild-card round of the playoffs and upset the top-seeded Dallas Cowboys, 34–31, in the divisional round of the playoffs, but their season came to an end when they were beaten by the second-seeded Atlanta Falcons in the NFC Championship Game, 44–21.[152][153][154] The Green Bay Packers began the 2017 regular season with a 4–2 record.[155] On October 15, during a week 6 game against the Minnesota Vikings, Aaron Rodgers was driven to the ground by Vikings linebacker Anthony Barr after throwing a pass. Rodgers suffered a broken collarbone during the play,[156] and the Packers placed him on injured reserve on October 20, with the stipulation that he could return in eight weeks (following NFL rules), especially if the injury healed quickly and the Packers were still in playoff contention.[157] Rodgers did indeed return to the field for a week 15 game against the Carolina Panthers on December 17, but the Packers were eliminated from the playoff hunt after a 31–24 loss. The team placed Rodgers back on injured reserve after the game, a move that prompted several teams to complain that the Packers had violated the NFL's rules about reactivating injured players.[158] During Rodgers' absence, backup quarterback Brett Hundley stepped into the starting role for the first time in his professional career, but struggled to replicate Rodgers' success, despite a Pro Bowl-caliber season by receiver Davante Adams.[159] In a 23–0 loss to the Baltimore Ravens in week 11, the Packers suffered their first shutout at Lambeau Field in 11 years (the last time was a 35–0 loss to the New England Patriots in 2006).[160] The Packers finished the season at 7–9, missing the playoffs for the first time since 2008. Off the field, the Packers organization opened the Titletown District adjacent to Lambeau Field. This shopping, entertainment, and restaurant district includes a public plaza, park, and various commercial businesses.[161] In 2018, the Packers again failed to qualify for the playoffs, finishing third in the NFC North with a record of 6–9–1.[162][163] Following a Week 13 loss to the Arizona Cardinals, Mike McCarthy was released as head coach, replaced by Offensive Coordinator Joe Philbin on an interim basis.[164][165][166] McCarthy left Green Bay having tallied a 125–77–2 (.618) regular season record, as well as a postseason record of 10–8 (.556). His total record with the Packers was 135–85–2. McCarthy had brought the team to nine playoff berths and facilitated one Super Bowl win.[167] Following the season, Matt LaFleur, the Offensive Coordinator of the Tennessee Titans the prior season, was hired as the Packers' new coach.[168] Under first-year head coach Matt LaFleur, Aaron Rodgers and the Packers opened the season by defeating the Chicago Bears in the season's opening game, the first time since 2003 that the league-wide kickoff game did not feature the defending Super Bowl champions, with the Packers and Bears being selected for their historic rivalry in the NFL's 100th season.[169] The Packers returned to the playoffs for the first time since 2016, finishing with a record of 13–3 and securing a first-round bye as the NFC's second seed.[170] They defeated the Seattle Seahawks 28–23 in the NFC Divisional round to advance to the NFC Championship game, where they were defeated 37–20 by the San Francisco 49ers.[171] In 2020, the Green Bay Packers won the NFC North Division for the second consecutive year.[172] They also earned a first-round bye, with the top seed in the NFC. They defeated the Los Angeles Rams 32–18 in the Divisional Round,[173] but fell to the underdog Tampa Bay Buccaneers in the NFC championship[174]- their fourth straight loss in the game in five appearances under Rodgers. Rodgers won his third MVP award during the season.[175] The next year, they clinched the top seed in the NFC again, with a 13–4 record, before losing 13–10 to the 49ers in the Divisional round. The special teams unit was consistently the worst in the NFL during the season, though their defense was noted as an improvement from previous seasons.[176] The special teams was especially costly in the postseason game as a field goal attempt and punt were both blocked, the latter of which the 49ers returned for a touchdown.[177] The defense did not allow any touchdowns in that game, as the only other points the 49ers scored were off two field goals. Matt LaFleur became the first coach to have three straight 13-win seasons, however, none of them ended with a trip to the Super Bowl.[178] For his performance in the season, Aaron Rodgers won his fourth MVP award- the second most for any quarterback, only behind Peyton Manning who has five.[179] In the 2022 season, the Green Bay Packers struggled and were eliminated from advancing to the NFL's wild-card playoffs when they lost their last regular-season game 20–16 to the Detroit Lions.[180] This was the first time the team missed the playoffs during Matt LaFleur's coaching stint. The team finished with an 8–9 record.[181] The 2023 season was the first without longtime quarterback Aaron Rodgers, who was traded to the New York Jets during the offseason.[182] Jordan Love, who was drafted to the Green Bay Packers in 2020,[183] took over as starting quarterback. The team finished with an 9–8 record which secured 2nd place in the NFC North division, and the 7th seed in the NFC.[184] The Packers defeated the 2nd seed Dallas Cowboys 48–32 in their Wild-Card matchup, becoming the first 7th seed team to win a playoff game.[185] The Packers would go on to lose to the 1st seed San Francisco 49ers 24–21 in the Divisional round.[186] Following the loss, the team announced that Defensive coordinator Joe Barry would not return next season.[187] The Packers are the only community-owned franchise in North America's four traditional major leagues.[a][13][188][189] Rather than being the property of an individual, partnership, or corporate entity, they are held by stockholders, more than 537,000 in total as of 2022. No one is allowed to hold more than 200,000 shares.[5] It is this broad-based community support and non-profit structure[190] which has kept the team in Green Bay for nearly a century even though it is the smallest market in North American professional sports.[a] The city of Green Bay had a population of only 107,395 as of the 2020 census,[191] and 600,000 in its television market, significantly less than the average NFL figures. The team, however, has long had an extended fan base throughout Wisconsin and parts of the Midwest, thanks in part to playing one pre-season and three regular-season home games each year in Milwaukee through 1995. It was only when baseball-only Miller Park preempted football there that the Packers' home slate became played entirely in Green Bay. As of 2021, there have been six stock sales to fund Packer operations over the team's history, beginning with $5,000 being raised through 1,000 shares offered at $5 apiece in 1923.[192] The latest was in November 2021, where they sold almost 200,000 shares.[193] The original \"Articles of Incorporation for the Green Bay Football Corporation\", enacted in 1923, specified that should the franchise be sold, any post-expenses money would have gone to the Sullivan-Wallen Post of the American Legion to build \"a proper soldier's memorial\". This stipulation was included to ensure there could never be any financial inducement for shareholders to move the club from Green Bay. At the November 1997 annual meeting, shareholders voted to change the beneficiary from the Sullivan-Wallen Post to the Green Bay Packers Foundation, which makes donations to many charities and institutions throughout Wisconsin.[194] Even though it is referred to as \"common stock\" in corporate offering documents, a share of Packers stock does not share the same rights traditionally associated with common or preferred stock. It does not include an equity interest, does not pay dividends, cannot be traded, has no securities-law protection, and brings no season ticket purchase privileges. All shareholders receive are voting rights, an invitation to the corporation's annual meeting, and an opportunity to buy exclusive shareholder-only merchandise.[190] Shares of stock cannot be resold, except back to the team for a fraction of the original price. While new shares can be given as gifts, transfers are technically allowed only between immediate family members once ownership has been established.[194] Green Bay is the only team with this form of ownership structure in the NFL, which does not comply with current league rules stipulating a maximum of 32 owners per team, with one holding a minimum 30% stake. The Packers' corporation was grandfathered when the NFL's current ownership policy was established in the 1980s.[195] As a publicly held nonprofit, the Packers are also the only American major-league sports franchise to release its financial balance sheet every year. Green Bay Packers, Inc., is governed by a seven-member executive committee elected from a 45-member board of directors. It consists of a president, vice president, treasurer, secretary, and three members-at-large; only the president is compensated. Responsibilities include directing corporate management, approving major capital expenditures, establishing broad policy, and monitoring management performance. The team's elected president normally represents the Packers in NFL owner's meetings. During his time as coach, Vince Lombardi generally represented the team at league meetings in his role as general manager, except at owners-only meetings, where president Dominic Olejniczak appeared.[1] The team created the Green Bay Packers Foundation in December 1986. It assists in a wide variety of activities and programs benefiting education, civic affairs, health services, human services and youth-related programs.[196] At the team's 1997 annual stockholders meeting the foundation was designated in place of a Sullivan-Wallen Post soldiers memorial as the recipient of any residual assets upon the team's sale or dissolution. The Packers have an exceptionally loyal fan base. Regardless of team performance, every game played in Green Bay—preseason, regular season, and playoffs—has been sold out since 1960.[197] Despite the Packers having by far the smallest local TV market, the team consistently ranks as one of the most popular in the NFL.[198] They also have one of the longest season ticket waiting lists in professional sports: 140,000 names long, more than there are seats at Lambeau Field.[199][200][201] The average wait is said to be over 30 years,[202] but with only 90 or so tickets turned over annually it would be 955 years before the newest name on the list got theirs.[200] As a result, season tickets are willed to next of kin, and newborns are placed optimistically on the waiting list.[203] Packers fans are often referred to as cheeseheads,[204] a nickname for Wisconsin residents reflecting the state's bountiful cheese production first leveled as an insult at a 1987 game between the Chicago White Sox and Milwaukee Brewers. Instead, it came to be a statewide source of pride, and particularly since 1994 has been embraced by Packers fans.[204] Bright orange triangular cheesehead hats are a fixture wherever the team plays. During training camp in the summer months, held outside the Don Hutson Center, young Packers fans can bring their bikes and have their favorite players ride them from the locker room to practice at Ray Nitschke Field. This old tradition began around the time of Lambeau Field's construction in 1957. Gary Knafelc, a Packers end at the time, said, \"I think it was just that kids wanted us to ride their bikes. I can remember kids saying, 'Hey, ride my bike.'\"[205] The team holds an annual scrimmage called Family Night, typically an intra-squad affair, at Lambeau Field. During 2004 and 2005 sellout crowds of over 60,000 fans showed up, with an all-time mark of 62,492 set in 2005 when the Buffalo Bills appeared.[206] In August 2008, ESPN.com ranked Packers fans as second-best in the NFL.[207] The team initially finished tied with the Pittsburgh Steelers (who finished ahead of the Packers) as having the best fans, but the tie was broken by ESPN's own John Clayton, a Pittsburgh native. Needing to outfit his new squad, team founder Curly Lambeau solicited funds from his employer, the Indian Packing Company. He was given $500 for uniforms and equipment in return for the team being named for its sponsor. An early newspaper article referred to the fledglings as \"the Indians\", but by the time they played their first game \"Packers\" had taken hold. Indian Packing was purchased in 1920 by the Acme Packing Company. Acme continued to support the team, which played its first NFL season with \"ACME PACKERS\" emblazoned on its jerseys. Lambeau, a Notre Dame alumnus, borrowed its Irish's navy blue and gold team colors, much as George Halas borrowed his Illinois alma mater's for the Chicago Bears. As a result, the early Packers were often referred to as the \"Bays\" or the \"Blues\" (and even occasionally as \"the Big Bay Blues\"). By 1950, Green Bay replaced navy blue with kelly green but kept what was by then a lighter shade of athletic gold. Navy blue was kept as a secondary color, seen primarily on sideline capes, but was quietly dropped on all official materials shortly after that. In 1958, this kelly green was replaced by a darker hunter green; it and athletic gold have served as the team colors since. The team's current uniform combination of forest green or white jerseys and metallic gold pants was adopted soon after Vince Lombardi arrived in 1959. However, to celebrate the NFL's 75th anniversary in 1994, the Packers joined in a league-wide donning of \"throwback\" jerseys, back to navy blue and gold. The team would go throwback again for two Thanksgiving Day games against the Detroit Lions, in blue and gold 1930s-era uniforms in 2001, and 1960s green and gold (only slightly different from the current ones) in 2003.[209][210] In 1951, the team finally stopped wearing leather helmets, adopting the metallic gold plastic headgear it has used ever since. The oval \"G\" logo was added in 1961 when Lombardi asked Packers equipment manager Gerald \"Dad\" Braisher to design a logo. Braisher tasked his assistant, St. Norbert College art student John Gordon. Satisfied with a football-shaped letter \"G\", the pair presented it to Lombardi, who then approved the addition.[211] Tiki Barber falsely reported[212] it to stand for \"greatness\" without a reliable source to back up his claims. Other reputable media outlets then published similar stories using Barber's false claim as a source.[213] The Packers' Assistant Director of PR and Corporate Communications had the following to say: \"There's nothing in our history that suggests there's any truth to this. The Packers Hall of Fame archivist said the same thing.\"[214] The team used several different logos before 1961, but the \"G\" is the only logo that has ever appeared on the helmet.[215][216] The Packers hold the trademark on the \"G\" logo, and have granted limited permission to other organizations to utilize a similar logo, such as the University of Georgia and Grambling State University, in addition to the city of Green Bay itself as part of its civic logo.[217] Adopted in 1964, the Georgia \"G\", though different in design and color, was similar to the Packers' \"G\". Then-Georgia head coach Vince Dooley thought it best to clear the use of Georgia's new emblem with the Packers.[218] While several NFL teams choose to wear white jerseys at home early in the season due to white's ability to reflect the late summer sun rays, the Packers have done so only twice, during the opening two games of the 1989 season. In 2016, the Packers debuted their Color Rush uniform, wearing white pants and socks with a white uniform.[219] This set has been worn five times, four of them at home and two against the Chicago Bears. In 2024, the all-white Color Rush uniform would be paired with a new alternate white helmet, which is essentially the primary helmet minus the gold elements.[220] Although alternate gold jerseys with green numbers are sold on a retail basis, the team currently has no plans to introduce such a jersey to be used in actual games. During the 2010 season, the Packers paid tribute to their historical roots with a throwback jersey modeled after that worn by the club in 1929, during its first championship season. The jersey was navy blue with a gold circle and navy numbers, again making the Packers \"the Blues\".[221][222] These were then changed in 2015 to the navy blue throwback worn from 1937 to 1949, featuring gold shoulders and numbers.[223] In 2021, the Packers changed their throwback thirds to an all-green design, resembling the uniforms worn from 1950 to 1953.[224] Originally, the Packers wore brown helmets with the throwbacks, but in 2013, they started wearing their gold helmets without any decals due to the then-implementation of the NFL's one-shell rule; this rule has been abolished in 2022. As a result, they changed their throwbacks in both 2015 and 2021 to properly recreate those original uniforms, which had gold helmets with them. Upon the NFL's switch of uniform suppliers in 2012 to Nike from Reebok,[225] the Packers refused any changes to their uniform in any way outside of the required supplier's logo and new league uniform logos, declining all of Nike's \"Elite 51\" enhancements, including retaining the traditional striped collar of the jersey rather than Nike's new collar design.[226] The Packers and Chicago Bears have been rivals since their team's inception in 1920, becoming one of the oldest and most storied rivalries in the league's history. The Packers currently lead the series 107–95–6,[227] and the teams have met twice in the postseason. The Bears won the 1941 meeting, 33–14, and eventually defeated the New York Giants in the 1941 NFL Championship Game, and the Packers won the 2011 meeting, 21–14, en route to a Super Bowl XLV win over the Pittsburgh Steelers. The teams' first meeting was a victory for the Bears (known as the Staleys at the time) in 1921 in a shutout, 20–0. The Packers claimed their first win over the Bears in 1925, 14–10. The 1924 matchup (which ended in a 3–0 win for Chicago) was notable for featuring the first-ever ejection of players in a game in NFL history, as Frank Hanny of the Bears and Walter Voss of the Packers were ejected for punching each other.[228] The rivalry also featured one of the last successful fair catch kicks in 1968, when Bears kicker Mac Percival kicked the game-winning field goal.[229] As of the 2023 season, the Packers lead the all-time series 107–95–6.[230] The rivalry between the Packers and Minnesota Vikings began in 1961, similar to their other divisional rivalries. It is also considered to be one of the most intense rivalries in the NFL, due to the intensity of most of the matchups over the years, As is the case with many of their respective state's college teams sharing a rivalry; (Minnesota and Wisconsin) have a rivalry in multiple sports, seen between the Big Ten rivals, the University of Wisconsin and University of Minnesota. Events such as Randy Moss mooning the Green Bay crowd in the first playoff game between these two teams (won by the Vikings), and former Packer great Brett Favre's move to the Vikings have created more resentment between these teams. The Packers lead the all-time series 66–59–3, despite the two teams splitting their two playoff contests.[231] The Packers' rivalry with the Detroit Lions has been another one of the oldest regular matchups in the NFL. They first met in 1930 when the Lions were known as the Portsmouth Spartans and based in Portsmouth, Ohio. The team eventually moved to Detroit for the 1934 season. The Lions and Packers have been division rivals since 1933 and have always met at least twice a season since 1932, without any canceled games between both rivals. The Packers lead the series 106–76–7 as of the end of the 2022 season, the first time in NFL history that a team has recorded 100 wins over an opponent.[232] The rivalry between the Packers and Dallas Cowboys has resulted in several notable games in league history, including the \"Ice Bowl\" and other games impacting the playoff race.[233] The rivalry heated up during the 2010s, with several of their games impacting the NFC playoff race during that decade. During the Brett Favre era in Green Bay, the Cowboys dominated the rivalry, going 9–2 (including 9–0 in Dallas) against the Packers when Favre was the quarterback. However, in the Aaron Rodgers era from 2008 to 2022, the Packers have dominated the rivalry, as Rodgers had an 8–2 record against the Cowboys with Green Bay, including a perfect 3–0 record in Dallas. The Packers lead the all-time series 22–17. The Packers lead 5–4 in the playoffs, with the last playoff match taking place in January 2024 at AT&T Stadium in the Wild Card round with a 48–32 Packers win.[234] The rivalry between the Packers and the San Francisco 49ers ignited during the 1990s, with the two teams facing each other in four consecutive playoff games. The Packers won four of five playoff games against the 49ers with Brett Favre as its quarterback, with four of those games pitting Favre against the 49ers' Hall of Fame quarterback Steve Young. Since 2012, the 49ers have defeated the Aaron Rodgers-led Packers four times in the playoffs.[235] The Packers currently lead the series 38–33–1, but the 49ers have won the last four postseason meetings to take a 5–4 lead.[236][237] Following Seattle's relocation to the NFC in 2002, the Packers have faced the Seattle Seahawks multiple times in the playoffs, developing an intense rivalry as well. Some notable moments include the clubs' first playoff meeting in 2003 in which Seahawks quarterback Matt Hasselbeck threw a game-losing pick-six in overtime after guaranteeing a game-winning drive,[238] the Fail Mary, and Russell Wilson overcoming four interceptions and a 16–0 Packers lead to lead Seattle to a 28–22 overtime win to advance to Super Bowl XLIX.[239] As of the 2023 season, the Packers lead the all-time series 15–9.[240] The series between the Packers and New York Giants has been one of the oldest regular matchups in the league as the two teams first met in 1928. The two teams have played since 1970 in the National Football Conference, and they play each other in the regular season either every three years or depending on its NFC division placement, and in the postseason, The Packers lead the all-time series 34–27–2 and postseason series 5–3.[241] The Tampa Bay Buccaneers and Packers were division rivals from 1977 to 2002 when both were in the NFC Central division. The teams have played several notable games, including a Snow Bowl game in 1985, a playoff game in 1998 and the NFC Championship Game in 2021.[242] As of the 2023 season, the Packers lead the series 34–23–1.[243] After their early seasons at Bellevue Park and Hagemeister Park, the Packers played home games in City Stadium from 1925 to 1956.[244] The team won its first six NFL championships there. By the 1950s, the wooden 25,000-seat arena was considered outmoded.[245] The NFL threatened to move the franchise to Milwaukee full-time unless it got a better stadium.[246] The city responded by building a new 32,150 seat City Stadium for the team, the first built exclusively for an NFL team, which opened in time for the 1957 season.[247] It was renamed Lambeau Field in 1965 to honor Curly Lambeau, who had died earlier in the year.[248] Expanded seven times before the end of the 1990s, Lambeau Field capacity reached 60,890. In 2003, it was extensively renovated to expand seating, modernize stadium facilities, and add an atrium area. Even with a current seating capacity of 72,928, ticket demand far outpaces supply, as all Packers games have been sold out since 1960. About 86,000 names are on the waiting list for season tickets.[200] The Packers played part of their home slate in Milwaukee starting in 1933, including two to three home games each year in Milwaukee's County Stadium from 1953 to 1994. Indeed, County Stadium had been built partly to entice the Packers to move to Milwaukee full-time. The Packers worked to capture their growing fan base in Milwaukee and the larger crowds. By the 1960s, the threat of an American Football League franchise in Milwaukee prompted the Packers to stay, including scheduling a Western Conference Championship game in 1967. County Stadium was built primarily as a baseball stadium and made only the bare minimum adjustments to accommodate football. At its height, it only seated 56,000 people, just barely above the NFL minimum; many of those seats were badly obstructed. The field was just barely large enough to fit a football field. Both teams shared the same sideline (separated by a piece of tape) and the end zones extended onto the warning track. By 1994, improvements and seating expansions at Lambeau, along with the Brewers preparing to campaign for their new stadium prompted the Packers to play their full slate in Green Bay for the first time in 62 years. Former season ticketholders for the Milwaukee package continue to receive preference for one pre-season and the second and fifth regular-season games at Lambeau Field each season, along with playoff games through a lottery under the \"Gold Package\" plan.[249] The Packers have three practice facilities across the street from Lambeau Field in Ashwaubenon, Wisconsin: the Don Hutson Center, an indoor facility; Ray Nitschke Field, an outdoor field with artificial FieldTurf; and Clarke Hinkle Field, an outdoor field with natural grass.[250] The Packers Pro Shop has been the official retail store of the Packers since 1989. The primary retail store is located at Lambeau Field, having been expanded numerous times since it opened. The Pro Shop reported sales of over $7 million in 2015.[251][252] This is a partial list of the Packers' last five completed seasons. For the full season-by-season franchise results, see List of Green Bay Packers seasons.[253] Note: The Finish, Wins, Losses, and Ties columns list regular season results and exclude any postseason play. As of January 2023 The Packers have been league champions a record 13 times,[25] topping their nearest rival, the Chicago Bears, by four. The first three were decided by league standing, the next six by the NFL Title Game, and the last four by Super Bowl victories. The Packers are also the only team to win three consecutive NFL titles, having accomplished this twice—from 1929 to 1931 under Lambeau, and from 1965 to 1967 under Lombardi. Starting in 1966, the NFL began holding the Super Bowl. The Packers have won four Super Bowls.[258] From 1933 to 1969, the NFL held a championship game to decide their champion. The Packers won 8 NFL Championship Games. From 1966 to 1969, the NFL Championship Game was followed by the Super Bowl.[259] The Packers have won three NFC Championship Games, with twice as many losses. NFC Championships did not exist before the AFL–NFL merger in 1970.[260] From 1920 to 1932, the NFL championship was awarded based on standings, with no championship game taking place. The Packers won three such championships.[261] The Packers have won 21 divisional championships. Running backs (RB) Wide receivers (WR) Tight ends (TE) Defensive linemen (DL) Defensive backs (DB) Special teams Reserve 53 active, 4 reserve, 16 practice squad (+1 exempt) The Packers have the second most members in the Pro Football Hall of Fame with 30, 25 of which were inducted as Packers. They trail only the Chicago Bears with 37 Hall of Famers, 30 of which were inducted as Bears.[262] Many Packers players and coaches are also enshrined in the Wisconsin Athletic Hall of Fame.[263] In 2018 Ron Wolf, the most recent Packers contributor to be honored, was inducted.[264] In nearly nine decades of Packers football, the Packers have formally retired six numbers.[265] All six Packers are members of the Pro Football Hall of Fame and their numbers and names are displayed on the green facade of Lambeau Field's north endzone as well as in the Lambeau Field Atrium. The Green Bay Packers Hall of Fame was the first hall of fame built to honor a single professional American football team. John P. Holloway, a Brown County administrator and arena director, and William L. Brault, a Green Bay restaurateur and Packers fan, co-founded the Packer Hall of Fame museum[266] in 1966. As of 2019, the Packers Hall of Fame has inducted 162 people, 24 of whom have been inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame.[267] → Coaching staff → Front office → More NFL staffs [268] *Interim head coaches The Packers are unique in having their market area cover two media markets, both Green Bay and Milwaukee. NFL blackout restrictions for the team apply within both areas. However, Packers games have not been blacked out locally since 1972 (the last year home game local telecasts were prohibited regardless of sellout status) due to strong home attendance and popularity. As mentioned above, every Packers home game—preseason, regular season and playoffs—has been sold out since 1960.[269] The flagship station of the Packers Radio Network is Good Karma Brands's WTMJ in Milwaukee, which was the former flagship of the Journal Broadcast Group before its merger with E. W. Scripps Company in April 2015; Scripps itself sold their Milwaukee radio assets to GKB in November 2018, and the team then brought their broadcast operations in-house, thus the personnel is directly employed by the team. WTMJ has aired Packers games since 1929, the longest association between a radio station and an NFL team to date, and the only rights deal in American professional sports where a station outside of the team's main metro area is the radio flagship. While this might be unusual, the station can be heard at city-grade strength at all hours in Green Bay proper. Games air in Green Bay on WTAQ (1360/97.5) and WIXX-FM (101.1), and WAPL (105.7) and WHBY (1150) in Appleton and the Fox Cities.[270] Wayne Larrivee is the play-by-play announcer and Larry McCarren is the color analyst. Larrivee joined the team after many years as the Chicago Bears' announcer.[271] Jim Irwin and Max McGee were the longtime radio announcers before Larrivee and McCarren. When victory is assured for the Packers, either a game-winning touchdown, interception or a crucial 4th down defensive stop, Larrivee's trademark declaration of \"And there is your dagger!\" signifies the event. In limited circumstances where the Milwaukee Brewers are in either playoff or post-season contention and their play-by-play takes priority, WTMJ's sister FM station WKTI (94.5) currently airs Packer games to avert game conflicts. Surrounding pre-game programming is also carried on sister station WAUK (540), an ESPN Radio affiliate and former competitor which produced unofficial Packers programming for years. On October 27, 2021, the Packers announced that it would end its longtime association with WTMJ at the end of the season, with iHeartMedia's sports radio station WRNW (97.3) becoming the team's Milwaukee radio affiliate in 2022.[272] The TV rights for pre-season games not nationally broadcast are held by E. W. Scripps Company-owned television stations WGBA-TV (channel 26) in Green Bay and WTMJ-TV (channel 4) in Milwaukee;[273] the game broadcasts are distributed to 19 further TV stations in Wisconsin, Michigan, North Dakota, South Dakota, Iowa, Nebraska, Illinois, Missouri, and Alaska, as well as Spanish-language WYTU-LD \"Telemundo Wisconsin\" in Milwaukee.[274] The deal marked a change in affiliate in Green Bay from WFRV-TV; in the wake of the 2012 deal, McCarren resigned his duties as sports director of WFRV to move to WTMJ/WGBA as a Packers analyst, becoming WGBA's official sports director on April 1, 2013.[275][276] McCarren left WGBA in 2015 and became a team employee.[277] The team's intra-squad Lambeau scrimmage at the beginning of the season, marketed as Packers Family Night, was produced for over a decade by WLUK-TV in Green Bay and broadcast by the state's Fox affiliates through the 2016 season.[278] In 2017, Scripps and the Packers Television Network began to originate the Packers Family Night broadcast.[279] Preseason television games are announced by Kevin Harlan, son of former Packers president Bob Harlan, and color commentator Rich Gannon.[274] Regular-season and postseason games not aired on a broadcast network are simulcast on broadcast stations in the Green Bay and Milwaukee markets. On the television sitcom That '70s Show, in season 7 episode 14, Donna Pinciotti gave the gang—including Red Forman, a long-time Packer fan—six free tickets to Lambeau Field for a game against the Chicago Bears. Eric comes back wearing Bears Jersey # 34 Sweetness Walter Payton causing the crowd to boo and make negative comments towards him. Eric doesn't understand football in general. In the season 8 finale, Red declined to move to Florida after Steven Hyde bought him season tickets.[280] In 2015, five members of the Packers (David Bakhtiari, Don Barclay, T. J. Lang, Clay Matthews, and Josh Sitton) made an appearance as an a cappella group in the musical comedy Pitch Perfect 2. Aaron Rodgers' brother Jordan also appeared.[281] That same year, Rodgers himself appeared in an episode of the sketch comedy television series Key & Peele, along with Ha Ha Clinton-Dix.[282] In the television series Danny Phantom, the main antagonist, Vlad Masters/Vlad Plasmius, is a Packers \"Fanatic\". His prized possession is a football autographed by Ray Nitschke, and his dream is to own the team.[283] In the 1998 film There's Something about Mary, Mary, played by actress Cameron Diaz, consistently talks about her boyfriend \"Brett\". It is revealed towards the end of the film that \"Brett\" is then-Packers' quarterback Brett Favre.[284]",

                "content": "Watch CBS News By Dave Pehling Updated on: December 23, 2024 / 7:36 PM PST / CBS San Francisco A part of the Santa Cruz Wharf collapsed Monday afternoon during a high-surf warning, with authorities confirming two people had to be pulled from the water. The collapse of the municipal wharf was just one of multiple impacts in the weather-battered region as high surf and flooding led to multiple road closures and some coastal evacuations in Capitola. Santa Cruz officials later said that the collapse happened at around 12:45 p.m. The National Weather Service Bay Area X account posted information and video from an X user about the collapse at 1:1:18 p.m. Monday. KPIX First Alert Weather: Current conditions, alerts, maps for your area \"A portion of the Santa Cruz pier has collapsed, and is floating away,\" the post read. \"Look at the ominous wave action on the horizon. You are risking your life, and those of the people that would need to try and save you by getting in or too close to the water.\" 🚨🚨A portion of the Santa Cruz Pier has collapsed, and is floating away. Look at the ominous wave action on the horizon. You are risking your life, and those of the people that would need to try and save you by getting in or too close to the water. #CAwx 🚨🚨 https://t.co/5vCNQogvtI Santa Cruz Fire confirmed two people needed assistance being pulled from the water by life guards and a third person was able to get out of the surf on their own without help. The Santa Cruz Police Department was also at the scene. The Santa Cruz Wharf has been closed until further notice, officials said. The public is being asked to stay away from the area. Santa Cruz Mayor Fred Keeley and other city officials spoke about the incident shortly before 2:30 p.m. Keeley noted that the part of the pier that collapsed \"was a portion of the municipal wharf that has already been determined to need to be taken down and repaired over time.\" It included the Dolphin restaurant and one of the public bathrooms on the wharf. Keeley also confirmed that the people who fell into the water were city personnel who were working on the wharf at the time, but said that there were no injuries and all people were accounted for. The area of the wharf that washed away has been closed to the public since January of this year, officials said. The mayor noted that in the collapse, they lost \"many pilings, a lot of the deck of the wharf itself, as well as the restroom and what remained of the Dolphin restaurant.\" The public restroom had already washed ashore on the beach, but the mayor said that the rest of the debris that remained in the water presented \"serious hazards for people and for any kind of navigation\" and asked that people stay out of the water and off the beach for their safety and keep \"their vehicles, their boats or other devices out in the water.\" The mayor said city personnel were \"assessing...the structural integrity of the wharf\" given the incoming storm that would likely have additional impacts. Gov. Gavin Newsom's office confirmed the governor was briefed on the damage and said the California Office of Emergency Services was coordinating with local officials to help provide support. The collapse of the pier comes after the National Weather Service issued a high surf warning that remains in effect through noon Tuesday for San Francisco, the North Bay coast including Point Reyes National Seashore, the Peninsula coast, the Monterey Bay, and Big Sur Coast. Breaking waves of 30 to 35 feet are expected along the coast. Further south from the wharf, Santa Cruz County authorities confirmed to KPIX that a man died at Sunset State Beach after a large wave trapped him underneath washed-up debris. A second person remained missing after going into the water at Marina State Beach in Monterey County Monday afternoon. The Santa Cruz Beach Boardwalk announced the closure of the Boardwalk, the Casino Arcade and Neptune's Kingdom due to the weather current conditions shortly after 1:30 p.m. for the remainder of the day Monday. However, the Boardwalk Bowl remained open. The pier was also damaged during the powerful bomb cyclone that caused extensive damage in Santa Cruz, Capitola and other coastal towns in January of 2023. The high surf was having additional impacts Monday as the day wore on. The Santa Cruz office of the CHP confirmed shortly after 3 p.m. that flooding had closed East Cliff at 9th Ave., East Cliff at Moran Lake, Marina Ave. at Aptos Beach Dr., Moosehead Dr., and Rio Del Mar at Aptos Beach Dr. 🌊🚧 **IMPORTANT ALERT** 🚧🌊Heads up! East Cliff Dr is CLOSED between 26th Avenue and Palisades Avenue due to significant flooding. 🚫 Please do not attempt to drive across flooded areas or ignore road closures—it’s crucial for your safety. 🙏 pic.twitter.com/hLH84VuQ27 There were also some evacuations in Capitola after the Capitola Village was closed by the flooding from the high surf, with waves pushing seawater into the area.

And that paid off against the Bucs, as he not only kicked the Cowboys to a win, but set an NFL record along the way. Early Start The Cowboys Week 17 matchup against the Philadelphia Eagles has been flexed to the Noon kickoff slot. Grinch SZN The holiday season is usually about giving, but the Dallas Cowboys are interested in only one thing to end their year: playing the role of Grinch in every matchup to come. Spicing It Up It's been a long time coming, but after overcoming a foot injury that stole most of his 2024 season, DaRon Bland delivered one of the biggest takeaways of the year for the Cowboys. The Cowboys had to deal with crushing disappointment before Sunday night's game, writes @spags52, but they still showed plenty of pride in taking down the Buccaneers. Let's rank the top five moments from primetime games in 2024 that fans will reminisce for years to come. With his 14th made field goal from beyond 50 yards on Sunday night, Brandon Aubrey now holds the NFL record for the most 50+ yard field goal makes in a single season. For that reason, he's Dallas' ultimate weapon. The holiday season is usually about giving, but the Dallas Cowboys are interested in only one thing to end their year: playing the role of Grinch in every matchup to come. Despite being eliminated from the playoffs four hours before kickoff, the Cowboys actually took the field like it was a playoff game, providing plenty of effort and fight. Even though the Cowboys were eliminated from playoff contention before Sunday night's game, Mike McCarthy and his team still played as though everything was on the line ina 26-24 win over Tampa Bay. It's been a long time coming, but after overcoming a foot injury that stole most of his 2024 season, DaRon Bland delivered one of the biggest takeaways of the year for the Cowboys. As if what CeeDee Lamb is doing this season, against all odds and adversity, isn't impressive enough, now you can add two more records to his Cowboys' resume. Plays that might be forgotten include a pair of drops by the Bucs, both on offense and defense. Although eliminated from the playoffs earlier in the day, the Cowboys came out with something to prove, defeating the Buccaneers, 26-24. After Washington's last-second win over the Eagles, the Commanders improved to 10-5, which has officially eliminated the Cowboys from the playoffs. With injuries, heartbreak, and slim playoff hopes, the Cowboys face a grueling three-game stretch that could determine their postseason fate. Two of the hottest teams in the NFL square off here in a late-December matchup at AT&T Stadium. The Cowboys have won three of four but the Bucs are riding a four-game winning streak. The last few battles between the Cowboys and the Bucs were must-see TV, and these players could make sure the coming matchup is as well. The Cowboys have been scorching hot on the ground and in the pass rush, and will need to lean on that again Sunday night against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers if they want to keep their playoff hopes alive. There might be a bit of revenge on the minds of the Buccaneers when they visit the Cowboys at AT&T Stadium, despite the cast for both being different. As Cooper Rush heads into his seventh start as the Cowboys quarterback, he talked about the challenges that Todd Bowles and the Tampa Bay Buccaneers present defensively, as well as cleaning up his issue with fumbles. When it comes to his future with the Dallas Cowboys, and also the possibility of a training camp holdout, Micah Parsons could not be more clear on his stance. Let's take a look at some of the greatest players in the history of the Cowboys who somehow weren't drafted but still found undeniable success. Welcome to \"The Science Lab\", a place where football facts and in-depth analysis always triumph over feelings. Just how tough is CeeDee Lamb? @spags52 breaks it down in his weekly Mick Shots. Plus, the foot is back, what KaVontae Turpin is wishing for, Mike Zimmer on Micah Parsons and more. Here are 10 more notable 'big facts' to remember ahead of Sunday's 7:20pm kickoff on NBC. Carl Lawson's had a difficult, injury-filled career in the NFL. Now that he's healthy, he's back to playing some of his best football yet and knows there are higher levels that he can reach. There are several reasons Marist Liufau has progressed quickly as a Cowboys' rookie, one being DeMarvion Overshown's influence, and the other is his own fiery internal motor. With so many players banged up for the Dallas Cowboys, their undrafted free agents have made the most of their opportunities to contribute and play winning football. Head Coach Mike McCarthy met with the media on Monday to discuss the 26-24 victory over the Tampa Bay Buccaneers and what the last 5 games have meant for this team.

                "content": "The Dallas Cowboys are a professional American football team based in the Dallas–Fort Worth metroplex. The Cowboys compete in the National Football League (NFL) as a member of the National Football Conference (NFC) East division. The team is headquartered in Frisco, Texas, and has played its home games at AT&T Stadium in Arlington, Texas, since its opening in 2009. The stadium took its current name prior to the 2013 season, following the team's decision to sell the stadium's naming rights to telecommunications company AT&T.[6][7] In January 2020, Mike McCarthy was hired as head coach of the Cowboys.[8] He is the ninth in the team's history.[9] McCarthy follows Jason Garrett, who coached the team from 2010 to 2019.[9] The Cowboys joined the NFL as an expansion team in 1960.[10] The team's national following might best be represented by its NFL record of consecutive sell-outs. The Cowboys' streak of 190 consecutive sold-out regular and post-season games (home and away) began in 2002.[11] The franchise has made it to the Super Bowl eight times, tying it with the Pittsburgh Steelers, Denver Broncos, and San Francisco 49ers for second-most Super Bowl appearances in history behind the New England Patriots' record 11 appearances. Their eight NFC championships are tied for most in the conference's history. The Cowboys are the only NFL team to record 20 straight winning seasons (from 1966 to 1985) during which they missed the playoffs only twice (1974 and 1984).[12] In 2015, the Dallas Cowboys became the first sports team to be valued at $4 billion, making it the most valuable sports team in the world, according to Forbes.[13] The Cowboys also generated $620 million in revenue in 2014, a record for a U.S. sports team.[13] In 2018, they also became the first NFL franchise to be valued at $5 billion[14] and making Forbes' list as the most valued NFL team for the 12th straight year.[15] Prior to the formation of the Dallas Cowboys, there had not been an NFL team south of Washington, D.C. since the Dallas Texans folded in 1952 after only one season. Two businessmen had tried and failed to get Dallas a team in the NFL: Lamar Hunt responded by forming the American Football League with a group of owners, which would spur the NFL to expand beyond twelve teams. Oilman Clint Murchison Jr. persisted with his intent to bring a team to Dallas, but George Preston Marshall, owner of the Washington Redskins, had a monopoly in the South (after the addition of Dallas, the South would see three further teams - NFL teams in Atlanta and New Orleans, and an AFL team in Miami - added in the next six years).[16] Murchison had tried to purchase the Washington Redskins (now Commanders) from Marshall in 1958 with the intent of moving them to Dallas. An agreement was struck, but as the deal was about to be finalized, Marshall called for a change in terms, which infuriated Murchison, and he called off the deal.[17] Marshall then opposed any franchise for Murchison in Dallas. Since NFL expansion needed unanimous approval from team owners at that time, Marshall's position would prevent Murchison from joining the league. Marshall had a falling out with the Redskins band leader Barnee Breeskin, who had written the music to the Redskins fight song \"Hail to the Redskins\", and Marshall's wife had penned the lyrics. Breeskin owned the rights to the song and was aware of Murchison's plight to get an NFL franchise. Angry with Marshall, Breeskin approached Murchison's attorney to sell him the rights to the song before the expansion vote in 1959: Murchison subsequently purchased \"Hail to the Redskins\" for $2,500.[18] Before the vote to award franchises in 1959, Murchison revealed to Marshall that he now owned the song, and barred Marshall from playing it during games. After Marshall launched an expletive-laced tirade, Murchison sold the rights to \"Hail to the Redskins\" back to Marshall in exchange for his vote, the lone one against Murchison getting a franchise at that time, and a rivalry was born.[18] Murchison hired CBS Sports executive and former Los Angeles Rams general manager Tex Schramm as team president and general manager,[19] San Francisco 49ers scout Gil Brandt as head of player personnel,[20] and New York Giants defensive coordinator Tom Landry as head coach,[21] thus forming a triumvirate that would lead the Cowboys' football operations for three decades. Like most expansion teams, the Cowboys struggled at first. They failed to win a game in their inaugural season.[23] However, Landry slowly brought the team to respectability. In 1965, they finally got to .500. They broke all the way through a year later, winning consecutive Eastern Conference titles in 1966 and 1967. However, they lost the NFL Championship Game each time to the Green Bay Packers with the second loss coming in the 1967 Ice Bowl.[24] They would win consecutive division titles in 1968 and 1969 when the NFL adopted a divisional format, but were defeated in the playoffs both years by the Cleveland Browns. From 1970 through 1979, the Cowboys won 105 regular season games, more than any other NFL franchise during that time span.[25] In addition, they appeared in five Super Bowls, winning two (1971 and 1977). Led by quarterback Craig Morton, the Cowboys had a 10–4 season in 1970. They defeated Detroit 5–0 in the lowest-scoring playoff game in NFL history[26] and then defeated San Francisco 17–10 in the first-ever NFC Championship Game to qualify for their first Super Bowl appearance in franchise history, a mistake-filled Super Bowl V, where they lost 16–13 to the Baltimore Colts courtesy of a field goal by Colts' kicker Jim O'Brien with five seconds remaining in the contest. Despite the loss, linebacker Chuck Howley was named the Super Bowl MVP, the first and only time in Super Bowl history that the game's MVP did not come from the winning team.[27][28] The Cowboys moved from the Cotton Bowl to Texas Stadium in week six of the 1971 season. Landry named Staubach as the permanent starting quarterback to start the second half of the season, and Dallas was off and running. The Cowboys won their last seven regular season games (finishing 11–3) before dispatching the Minnesota Vikings and San Francisco 49ers in the playoffs to return to the Super Bowl. In Super Bowl VI, behind an MVP performance from Staubach and a then Super Bowl record 252 yards rushing, the Cowboys crushed the upstart Miami Dolphins, 24–3, to finally bury the \"Next Year's Champions\" stigma.[29] After missing the playoffs in 1974, the team drafted well the following year, adding defensive lineman Randy White (a future Hall of Fame member) and linebacker Thomas \"Hollywood\" Henderson. The fresh influx of talent helped the Cowboys back to the playoffs in 1975 as a wild card, losing to the Pittsburgh Steelers, 21–17, in Super Bowl X.[30] Dallas began the 1977 season 8–0, finishing 12–2. In the postseason, the Cowboys routed the Chicago Bears 37–7 and Minnesota Vikings 23–6 before defeating the Denver Broncos 27–10 in Super Bowl XII in New Orleans.[31] As a testament to Doomsday's dominance in the hard-hitting game, defensive linemen Randy White and Harvey Martin were named co-Super Bowl MVPs, the first and only time multiple players have received the award. Dallas returned to the Super Bowl, following the 1978 season, losing to Pittsburgh 35–31. Bob Ryan, an NFL Films editor, dubbed the Cowboys \"America's Team\" following the Super Bowl loss, a nickname that has earned derision from non-Cowboys fans but has stuck through both good times and bad.[32] Danny White became the Cowboys' starting quarterback in 1980 after quarterback Roger Staubach retired. Despite going 12–4 in 1980, the Cowboys came into the playoffs as a Wild Card team. In the opening round of the 1980–81 NFL playoffs they avenged their elimination from the prior year's playoffs by defeating the Rams. In the Divisional Round they squeaked by the Atlanta Falcons 30–27. For the NFC Championship they were pitted against division rival Philadelphia Eagles, the team that won the division during the regular season. The Eagles captured their first conference championship and Super Bowl berth by winning 20–7. 1981 brought another division championship for the Cowboys. They entered the 1981–82 NFL playoffs as the number 2 seed. Their first postseason saw them blow out Tampa Bay in a 38–0 shutout. The Cowboys then advanced to the NFC Championship Game against the San Francisco 49ers, the number 1 seed. Despite having a late 4th quarter 27–21 lead, they would lose to the 49ers 28–27. 49ers quarterback Joe Montana led his team on an 89-yard game-winning touchdown drive, connecting with Dwight Clark in a play known as The Catch.[33] The 1982 season was shortened after a player strike. With a 6–3 record Dallas made it to the playoffs for the 8th consecutive season. As the number 2 seed for the 1982–83 NFL playoffs they eliminated the Buccaneers 30–17 in the Wild Card round and dispatched the Packers 37–26 in the Divisional round to advance to their 3rd consecutive Conference championship game. However, the third time was not the charm for the Cowboys as they fell 31–17 to their division rival and eventual Super Bowl XVII champions, the Washington Redskins. Although it was not apparent at the time, the loss in the 1982 NFC title game marked the end of an era. For the 1983 season the Cowboys went 12–4 and made it once again to the playoffs but were upset at home in the Wild Card by the Rams 24–17. However, 1983 was a missed opportunity as prior to their playoff defeat, the Cowboys had a chance to clinch the NFC East and home-field advantage throughout the playoffs against Washington in the penultimate week of the regular season, but were defeated soundly 31–10 at home, and conceded control of the division to the Redskins in which they would not relinquish a week later. Prior to the 1984 season, Murchison sold the Cowboys to another Texas oil magnate, H.R. \"Bum\" Bright and his ten partners.[34] Dallas posted a 9–7 record that season but missed the playoffs for the first time in 10 seasons and only the second time in 18 years. After going 10–6 in 1985 and winning a division title, the Cowboys were shut out 20–0 by the Rams in the Divisional round in Los Angeles.[35][36] Hard times came for the organization as they went 7–9 in 1986, 7–8 in 1987, and 3–13 in 1988.[37][38][39] During this time period, Bright became disenchanted with the team. During an embarrassing home loss to Atlanta in 1987, Bright told the media that he was \"horrified\" at Landry's play calling. During the savings and loan crisis, Bright's savings and loan was taken over by the FSLIC. With most of the rest of his money tied up in the Cowboys, Bright was forced to sell the team to Jerry Jones on February 25, 1989, for $150 million.[40] Jones immediately fired Tom Landry, the only head coach in franchise history, replacing him with University of Miami head coach Jimmy Johnson, who was also Jones' teammate at the University of Arkansas as a fellow defensive lineman.[41] The hiring of Johnson also reunited Johnson with second-year wide receiver Michael Irvin, who had played collegiately at Miami. With the first pick in the draft, the Cowboys selected UCLA quarterback Troy Aikman. Later that same year, they would trade veteran running back Herschel Walker to the Minnesota Vikings for five veteran players and eight draft choices. Although the Cowboys finished the 1989 season with a 1–15 record, their worst in almost 30 years, \"The Trade\" later allowed Dallas to draft a number of impact players to rebuild the team.[42][43] Johnson quickly returned the Cowboys to the NFL's elite. Skillful drafts added fullback Daryl Johnston and center Mark Stepnoski in 1989, running back Emmitt Smith in 1990, defensive tackle Russell Maryland and offensive tackle Erik Williams in 1991, and safety Darren Woodson in 1992. The young talent joined holdovers from the Landry era such as wide receiver Michael Irvin, guard Nate Newton, linebacker Ken Norton Jr., and offensive lineman Mark Tuinei, defensive lineman Jim Jeffcoat, and veteran pickups such as tight end Jay Novacek and defensive end Charles Haley. Things started to look up for the franchise in 1990. On Week 1 Dallas won their first home game since September 1988 when they defeated the San Diego Chargers 17–14. They went 2–7 in their next 9 games but won 4 of their last 6 games to finish the season with a 4th place 7–9 record.[44] Coming into 1991 the Cowboys replaced offensive coordinator Dave Shula with Norv Turner; the Cowboys raced to a 6–5 start, then defeated the previously unbeaten Redskins despite injury to Troy Aikman. Backup Steve Beuerlein took over and the Cowboys finished 11–5. In the Wild Card round they defeated the Bears 17–13 for the Cowboys' first playoff win since 1982. In the Divisional round their season ended in a 38–6 playoff rout by the Lions.[45] In 1992 Dallas set a team record for regular-season wins with a 13–3 mark.[46] They started off the season by defeating the defending Super Bowl champion Redskins 23–10.[47] Going into the playoffs as the number 2 seed they had a first-round bye before facing division rival the Philadelphia Eagles.[48] The Cowboys won that game 34–10 to advance to the NFC Conference Championship game for the first time in 10 years.[49] They were pitted against the San Francisco 49ers, the top seed. On January 17, 1993, the Cowboys went to Candlestick Park and defeated the 49ers 30–20 to clinch their first Super Bowl berth since 1978.[50] Dallas defeated the Buffalo Bills 52–17 in Super Bowl XXVII, during which they forced a record nine turnovers.[51] Johnson became the first coach to claim a national championship in college football and a Super Bowl victory in professional football.[52] Despite starting the 1993 season 0–2, Dallas finished the regular season 12–4 as the number 1 seed of the NFC.[53][54] Dallas sent a then-NFL record 11 players to the Pro Bowl in 1993: Aikman, safety Thomas Everett, Irvin, Johnston, Maryland, Newton, Norton, Novacek, Smith, Stepnoski, and Williams.[55] They defeated the Green Bay Packers 27–17 in the divisional round.[56] In the NFC Conference Championship, Dallas beat the 49ers in Dallas, 38–21.[57] The Cowboys again defeated the Buffalo Bills in Super Bowl XXVIII, 30–13 (becoming the first team in NFL history to win a Super Bowl after starting 0–2). [58] Only weeks after Super Bowl XXVIII, however, friction between Johnson and Jones culminated in Johnson stunning the football world by announcing his resignation.[59] Jones then hired former University of Oklahoma head coach Barry Switzer to replace Johnson.[60] The Cowboys finished 12–4 in 1994.[61] They once again clinched a first-round bye and defeated Green Bay 35–9 in the Divisional Round.[62] They missed the Super Bowl, however, after losing to the San Francisco 49ers in the NFC Championship Game, 38–28.[63] Prior to the start of 1995 season Jerry Jones lured All-Pro cornerback Deion Sanders away from San Francisco.[64] Dallas started the season 4–0 including shutting out their division rival New York Giants 35–0 at Giants Stadium to open their season. Emmitt Smith set an NFL record with 25 rushing touchdowns that season.[65] They ended the season 12–4 and went into the playoffs as the number 1 seed.[66] In the Divisional round, they dispatched their division rival Eagles 30–11 to advance to their fourth consecutive NFC Conference Championship Game, in which they defeated Green Bay, 38–27.[67][68] In Super Bowl XXX the Cowboys defeated the Pittsburgh Steelers 27–17 at Sun Devil Stadium for their fifth Super Bowl championship, tied with the San Francisco 49ers for the most by any NFC team.[69] Switzer joined Johnson as the only coaches to win a college football national championship and a Super Bowl.[70] The glory days of the Cowboys were again beginning to dim as free agency, age, and injuries began taking their toll. Star receiver Michael Irvin was suspended by the league for the first five games of 1996 following a drug-related arrest; he came back after the Cowboys started the season 2–3.[71] They finished the regular season with a 10–6 record, won the NFC East title, and entered the playoffs as the number 3 seed in the NFC.[72] They defeated Minnesota 40–15 in the Wild Card round but were eliminated in the Divisional Round of the playoffs 26–17 by the Carolina Panthers.[73][74] The Cowboys went 6–10 in 1997, losing the last six consecutive games of the season, with discipline and off-field problems becoming major distractions.[75][76] As a result, Switzer resigned as head coach in January 1998 and former Steelers offensive coordinator Chan Gailey was hired to take his place.[77] Gailey led the team to two playoff appearances with a 10–6 record in 1998 and an NFC East championship, the Cowboys' sixth in seven years, but the Cowboys were upset at home in the Wild Card Round of the playoffs by the Arizona Cardinals 20–7. In 1999 Dallas went 8–8 in a season that featured Irvin suffering a career-ending cervical spine injury in a loss to the Philadelphia Eagles at Veterans Stadium. The season ended in a 27-10 Wild Card playoff loss to the Minnesota Vikings. Gailey was fired and became the first Cowboys coach who did not take the team to a Super Bowl.[78] Defensive coordinator Dave Campo was promoted to head coach for the 2000 season.[79] Prior to the season starting cornerback Deion Sanders was released after 5 seasons with the team.[80] He later signed with the division rival Washington Redskins. In Week 1, they were blown out 41–14 by the Philadelphia Eagles. That game was very costly when veteran quarterback Troy Aikman suffered a serious concussion which ultimately ended his career. Longtime NFL quarterback Randall Cunningham filled in for Aikman for the rest of the season at quarterback. The Cowboys finished the season in 4th place with a 5–11 record. The only highlights of 2000 were Emmitt Smith having his 10th consecutive 1,000-yard rushing season and a season sweep over the Redskins.[81] 2001 was another hard year in Dallas. Prior to the season starting Aikman was released from the team and he retired due to the concussions he had received.[82][83] Jerry Jones signed Tony Banks as a quarterback. Banks had been a starter for half of the season the previous year for the Super Bowl XXXV champion Baltimore Ravens before being benched. Jones also drafted quarterback Quincy Carter in the second round of that year's draft, and Banks was released during the preseason. Ryan Leaf, Anthony Wright, and Clint Stoerner all competed for the quarterback position that season. Dallas again finished at 5–11, last place in the NFC East, but they swept the Washington Redskins for the 4th consecutive season. Prior to the 2002 season Dallas drafted safety Roy Williams with the 8th overall pick. The season started out low as the Cowboys lost to the expansion Houston Texans 19–10 in Week 1. By far the highlight of 2002 was on October 28, when during a home game against the Seattle Seahawks, Emmitt Smith broke the all-time NFL rushing record previously held by Walter Payton. Their Thanksgiving Day win over the Washington Redskins was their 10th consecutive win against the Redskins. However, that was their final 2002 win as the team lost their next four games to finish with another last-place 5–11 record. The losing streak was punctuated with a Week 17 20–14 loss against the Redskins. That game was Smith's last game as a Cowboys player; he was released during the offseason.[84] Campo was immediately fired as head coach at the conclusion of the season.[85] Jones then lured Bill Parcells out of retirement to coach the Cowboys.[86] The Cowboys became the surprise team of the 2003 season getting off to a hot 7–2 start, but went 3–4 for the rest of the season.[87] They were able to grab the second NFC wild-card spot with a 10–6 record but lost in the Wild Card round to eventual conference champion Carolina Panthers, 29–10.[88] In 2004 Dallas was unable to replicate their 2003 success and ended 6–10.[89] Quincy Carter was released during the preseason and was replaced at quarterback by Vinny Testaverde.[90][91] Dallas got off to a great 7–3 start for the 2005 season but ended up only in 3rd place with a 9–7 record.[92] Prior to the beginning of that season, they signed veteran Drew Bledsoe as starting quarterback.[93] 2006 was an interesting year for the Cowboys. Prior to the season, they signed free agent wide receiver Terrell Owens who was talented yet controversial.[94] The Cowboys started the season 3–2. During a week 7 matchup against the New York Giants, Bledsoe, who had been struggling since the start of the season, was pulled from the game and was replaced by backup Tony Romo.[95] Romo was unable to salvage that game and Dallas lost 36–22. However, Romo was named the starter for the team and went 5–1 in his first 6 games. Dallas ended the season with a 9–7 2nd-place finish.[96] They were able to clinch the number 5 playoff seed. They traveled to play the Seattle Seahawks where the Seahawks won 21–20.[97] After the season Parcells retired and was replaced by Wade Phillips.[98][99] Dallas started the 2007 season with a bang, winning their first five games. They won 12 of their first 13 games, with their only loss during that span being to the New England Patriots, who went undefeated that season. Despite dropping two of their last three regular-season games, the Cowboys clinched their first number 1 NFC seed in 12 years, which also granted them a first-round bye and home-field advantage throughout the playoffs.[100][101] They lost in the divisional round 21–17 to the eventual Super Bowl champion New York Giants.[102] In the tumultuous 2008 season, the Cowboys started off strong, going 3–0 for the second straight year, en route to a 4–1 start. However, things soon went downhill from there, after quarterback Tony Romo suffered a broken pinkie in an overtime loss to the Arizona Cardinals. With Brad Johnson and Brooks Bollinger playing as backups, Dallas went 1–2 during a three-game stretch. Romo's return showed promise, as Dallas went 3–0. However, injuries mounted during the season, with the team losing several starters for the year, such as Kyle Kosier, Felix Jones, safety Roy Williams, punter Mat McBriar, and several other starters playing with injuries.[103] Entering December, the 8–4 Cowboys underperformed, finishing 1–3. They failed to make the playoffs after losing to the Philadelphia Eagles in the final regular-season game which saw the Eagles reach the playoffs instead.[104] On May 2, 2009, the Dallas Cowboys' practice facility collapsed during a wind storm.[105] The collapse left twelve Cowboys players and coaches injured. The most serious injuries were special teams coach Joe DeCamillis, who suffered fractured cervical vertebrae and had surgery to stabilize fractured vertebrae in his neck, and Rich Behm, the team's 33-year-old scouting assistant, who was permanently paralyzed from the waist down after his spine was severed.[106] The 2009 season started positively with a road win against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, but fortunes quickly changed as Dallas fell to a 2–2 start. In week five, with starting wide receiver Roy Williams sidelined by injury, receiver Miles Austin got his first start of the season and had a record-setting day (250 yards receiving and 2 touchdowns) to help lead Dallas to an overtime win over the Kansas City Chiefs.[107] Following their bye week, they went on a three-game winning streak including wins over the Atlanta Falcons and NFC East division rival Philadelphia Eagles. Despite entering December with a record of 8–3, they lost their slim grip on 1st place in the division with losses to the New York Giants and San Diego Chargers. Talks of past December collapses resurfaced, and another collapse in 2009 seemed validated. However, the team surged in the final three weeks of the season with a 24–17 victory against the eventual Super Bowl XLIV champion New Orleans Saints at the Louisiana Superdome, ending the Saints' previously unbeaten season in week 15. For the first time in franchise history, they posted back-to-back shutouts when they beat their division rivals, the Washington Redskins (17–0) and Philadelphia Eagles (24–0) to end the season. In the process, the Cowboys clinched their second NFC East title in three years as well as the third seed in the NFC Playoffs.[108][109] Six days later, in the wild-card round of the playoffs, Dallas played the Eagles in a rematch of week 17. The Cowboys defeated the Eagles for the first Cowboys post-season win since the 1996 season, ending a streak of six consecutive NFL post-season losses.[110] However, their playoff run ended after being routed 34–3 in the Divisional Round against the Minnesota Vikings.[111] After beginning the 2010 season at 1–7, Phillips was fired as head coach and was replaced by offensive coordinator Jason Garrett as the interim head coach.[112] With Garrett as interim head coach, the Cowboys finished the 2010 season 6–10 after beginning at 1–7.[113] With this improvement, the Cowboys signed Garrett as the head coach for the 2011 season.[114][115] To start the 2011 season the Cowboys played the New York Jets on a Sunday night primetime game in New York, on September 11. The Cowboys held the lead through most of the game, until a fumble, blocked punt, and interception led to the Jets coming back to win the game. In week 2 the Cowboys traveled to San Francisco to play the San Francisco 49ers. In the middle of the 2nd quarter, while the Cowboys trailed 10–7, Tony Romo suffered a rib injury and was replaced by Jon Kitna. Kitna threw 1 touchdown and 2 interceptions until Romo returned in the 3rd quarter as Dallas trailed 17–7. Romo then threw 3 touchdown passes to Miles Austin as the Cowboys rallied to send the game into overtime. On their opening possession after a 49ers punt, Romo found wide receiver Jesse Holley on a 78-yard pass, which set up the game-winning field goal by rookie kicker Dan Bailey.[116] The Cowboys ended the season 8–8. They were in a position to win the NFC East but lost to the New York Giants in a Week 17 primetime Sunday Night game on NBC which allowed the Giants to win the division.[117] The Giants would go on to win Super Bowl XLVI.[118] The Cowboys started off the 2012 season on a high note by defeating the defending Super Bowl champion New York Giants 24–17 on the opening night of the season.[119] They would hover around the .500 mark for the majority of the season. They lost a close Week 6 game to eventual Super Bowl XLVII champion Baltimore Ravens 31–29 at M&T Bank Stadium in Baltimore. Going into Week 17 they found themselves once again one win away from winning the division. Standing in their way were the Washington Redskins, who had beaten them on Thanksgiving at AT&T Stadium and who were one win away from their first division title since 1999. Led by Robert Griffin III the Redskins defeated the Cowboys at home 28–18.[120] Dallas once again finished the season 8–8.[121] In the 2013 season the Cowboys started off by defeating the New York Giants for the second straight year; this time 36–31. It was the first time since 2008 that the Cowboys were able to defeat the Giants at home. The win was punctuated by Brandon Carr intercepting an Eli Manning pass for a touchdown late in the 4th quarter. For the third straight year, Dallas once again found itself stuck in the .500 area. In Week 5, they lost a shootout to the eventual AFC champion Denver Broncos 51–48.[122] They battled it out with the Philadelphia Eagles for control of the division throughout the season. In December however they lost 2 crucial back-to-back games to the Chicago Bears and Green Bay Packers. They were very successful in division games having a 5–0 division record heading into another Week 17 showdown for the NFC East crown against the Eagles. That included beating the Washington Redskins 24–23 on Week 16 thanks to the late-game heroics of Tony Romo. However, Romo received a severe back injury in that game which prematurely ended his season. The Cowboys called upon backup quarterback Kyle Orton to lead them into battle on the final week of the season. Orton was unsuccessful who threw a game-ending interception to the Eagles which allowed the Eagles to win 24–22. Dallas ended the year at 8–8 for the third year in a row. The two differences from this 8–8 ending compared to the others was that Dallas ended the season in second place compared to the 2 previous 3rd-place finishes, along with their season-ending defeat taking place at home instead of on the road.[123] To start off the 2014 season Dallas began by losing to the San Francisco 49ers 28–17. After that, they went on a 6-game winning streak. The highlight of this streak was defeating the Super Bowl XLVIII champion Seattle Seahawks at CenturyLink Field 30–23. In Week 8, the Washington Redskins ended the Cowboys' winning streak by winning in overtime 20–17, and Romo injured his back again. He missed next week, a home loss to the Arizona Cardinals 28–17 with backup quarterback Brandon Weeden. Romo returned in Week 9 to lead a 31–17 victory over the Jacksonville Jaguars, which was played at Wembley Stadium in London, England as part of the NFL International Series. Dallas played their traditional Thanksgiving home game against their division rival Philadelphia Eagles. Both teams were vying for first place in the division with identical 8–3 records. The Eagles got off to a fast start and the Cowboys were unable to catch up, losing 33–10. They would rebound the next week when they defeated the Chicago Bears 41–28. Week 15 was a rematch against 1st place Philadelphia. This time it was the Cowboys who got off to a fast start going up 21–0. Then the Eagles put up 24 points but Dallas came back to win 38–27 to go into first place for the first time in the season and improve to 10–4. Going into their Week 16 matchup at home against the Indianapolis Colts, Dallas was in a position to clinch their first division title since 2009 by defeating the Colts 42-7 and the Eagles losing that week to the Redskins. They became the 2014 NFC East Champions, eliminating the Eagles from the playoffs. Dallas ended the regular season with a 12–4 record and an 8–0 away record when they won on the road against Washington 44–17.[124] On January 4, 2015, the Cowboys, as the number 3 seed, hosted the number 6 seed Detroit Lions in the wild-card round of the NFL playoffs. In the game, the Lions got off to a hot start, going up 14–0 in the first quarter. Dallas initially struggled on both sides of the ball. However, towards the end of the second quarter, Romo threw a 76-yard touchdown pass to Terrance Williams. Matt Prater of the Lions would kick a field goal before halftime to go up 17–7. Dallas came out swinging to start the second half by picking off Detroit quarterback Matthew Stafford on the first play of the third quarter. However, the Cowboys failed to capitalize on the turnover, as Dan Bailey missed a field goal during Dallas's ensuing drive. Detroit then kicked another field goal to make the score 20–7. A DeMarco Murray touchdown later in that quarter closed the gap to 20–14. A 51-yard Bailey field goal almost 3 minutes into the fourth quarter trimmed the Cowboys' deficit to 3. The Lions got the ball back and started driving down the field. On 3rd down-and-1 of that Lions drive, Stafford threw a 17-yard pass intended for Lions tight end Brandon Pettigrew, but the ball hit Cowboys linebacker Anthony Hitchens in the back a fraction of a second before he ran into Pettigrew. The play was initially flagged as defensive pass interference against Hitchens. However, the penalty was then nullified by the officiating crew. The Cowboys got the ball back on their 41-yard line and had a successful 59-yard drive which was capped off by an 8-yard touchdown pass from Romo to Williams to give the Cowboys their first lead of the game at 24–20. The Lions got the ball back with less than 2:30 to play in regulation. Stafford fumbled the ball at the 2-minute mark. The fumble was recovered by Cowboys defensive end DeMarcus Lawrence, who then fumbled the ball which was recovered by the Lions. Lawrence would redeem himself by sacking Stafford on a 4th down-and-3 play. The sack led to Stafford fumbling the ball again, which Lawrence recovered to seal the game for the Cowboys, who won 24–20.[125] This was the first time in franchise playoff history that Dallas had been down by 10 or more points at halftime and rallied to win the game. The following week, the Cowboys traveled to Lambeau Field in Green Bay, Wisconsin to play the Green Bay Packers in the Divisional Round. Despite having a 14–7 halftime lead, the Cowboys fell to the Packers 26–21, thus ending their season. The season ended on an overturned call of a completed catch by Dez Bryant. The catch was challenged by the Packers, and the referees overturned the call because of the \"Calvin Johnson rule.\"[126] During the 2015 offseason the Cowboys allowed running back DeMarco Murray to become a free agent. Murray signed with the division rival Philadelphia Eagles.[127] On July 15 wide receiver Dez Bryant signed a 5-year, $70 million contract.[128] The Cowboys started the 2015 season at home against the New York Giants, in which Dallas won 27–26. Dez Bryant left the game early with a fractured bone in his foot. On the road against the Philadelphia Eagles, Romo suffered a broken left collarbone, the same one he injured in 2010, and Brandon Weeden replaced him. Dallas won 20–10 to begin the season 2–0, but then went on a seven-game losing streak. They finished the season 4–12 and last in their division.[129] In 2016, after a preseason injury to Tony Romo, rookie quarterback Dak Prescott was slated as the starting quarterback, as Romo was expected to be out 6–8 weeks.[130] In week 1 against the New York Giants, Dallas lost 20–19. After this loss, Dallas would go on an eleven-game winning streak. After much speculation leading to a potential quarterback controversy, Romo made an announcement that Prescott had earned the right to take over as the Cowboys starting quarterback.[131] In game 10, Romo suited up for the first time in the season and was the backup quarterback. Dallas defeated the Baltimore Ravens to win their 9th straight game, breaking a franchise record of 8 straight games set in 1977. It also marked rookie running back Ezekiel Elliott breaking Tony Dorsett's single-season rushing record for a Cowboys rookie. Prescott also tied an NFL rookie record held by Russell Wilson and Dan Marino by throwing multiple touchdowns in 5 straight games. Dallas finished 13–3, tying their best 16-game regular-season record. While Dallas defeated the Green Bay Packers at Lambeau Field in week 6, the Packers would win at AT&T Stadium in the divisional round of the NFL playoffs on a last-second field goal, ending the Cowboys’ season.[132] Dak Prescott was named NFL Rookie of the Year in the NFL honors on February 4, 2017, and Ezekiel Elliott led the league in rushing yards. Jason Garrett was named Coach of the Year. Both Prescott and Elliott made the 2017 Pro Bowl. This is the first time the Cowboys sent two rookies to the Pro Bowl.[133] 2017 was the first season since 2002 without quarterback Tony Romo, who retired on April 4 after 14 seasons with the Cowboys.[134] The season also featured second-year running back Ezekiel Elliott being suspended for 6 games after violating the league's conduct policy.[135] The suspension was to begin at the start of the year but was pushed back to November.[136] The Cowboys finished the year at 9-7 without making the playoffs. Following the season, Dez Bryant was released after eight seasons in Dallas and tight end Jason Witten, who holds several franchise receiving records, retired after 15 seasons, ending an era.[137][138] The Dallas Cowboys' 2017 season was the subject of the third season of Amazon's sports documentary series All or Nothing. The series is produced by NFL Films.[139] In the 2018 season, the Cowboys finished with a 10–6 record and won the NFC East.[140] In the Wild Card Round, the Cowboys defeated the Seattle Seahawks 24–22 before losing 30–22 to the Los Angeles Rams in the Divisional Round.[141][142] Following the end of the 2019 season, where the Cowboys missed the playoffs for the 7th time in the last 10 seasons, it was announced that the team had parted ways with longtime head coach Jason Garrett. Both Marvin Lewis (former Bengals coach) and Mike McCarthy (former Packers coach who led Green Bay to a Super Bowl win) were interviewed for the head coaching position.[143] McCarthy and the Cowboys picked up the first win against the Atlanta Falcons in Week 2.[144] On October 11, the Cowboys’ 2020 season was all but lost when quarterback Dak Prescott suffered a grievous ankle injury that ended his season.[145] Despite the loss of Prescott, McCarthy's first year Cowboys still remained in the running for a playoff appearance throughout most of the regular season. They would go on to finish the season with a 6–10 record, which ranked the team third in the NFC East Division.[146] Throughout the 2020 season, the Cowboys’ defense struggled massively. Following the season, defensive coordinator Mike Nolan and defensive line coach Jim Tomsula were dismissed.[147] The Cowboys' 2021 season resulted in the first winning season since 2018, and with the San Francisco 49ers' Week 16 loss to the Tennessee Titans, the Cowboys clinched their first playoff berth also since 2018. Following a Denver Broncos' loss to the Las Vegas Raiders, the Cowboys clinched the NFC East, based on strength-of-victory tiebreakers; this was their first division title since 2018.[148] They swept the NFC East for the first time since 1998. Rookie Micah Parsons was awarded as Defensive Rookie of the Year, and contributed to a league-leading defense.[149] The Cowboys' strong offense finished the year with 530 points, the most in the league, and a team record.[150] They finished the season with a 12–5 record, their best since 2016. But despite high expectations, the Cowboys lost in the wild card round of the playoffs to the San Francisco 49ers 23–17.[151] The 2022 season saw a repeat of the 12–5 record. Despite losing to the Jacksonville Jaguars in Week 15, the Cowboys clinched a playoff berth after a loss by the Washington Commanders later that day. This marked the first time since 2006–2007 the Cowboys qualified for the postseason in consecutive seasons.[152] Quarterback Dak Prescott was awarded as Walter Payton NFL Man of the Year, for his contributions to the community and charity.[153] In the wild-card round of the playoffs, the Cowboys defeated the Tampa Bay Buccaneers to win their first road playoff game since their Super Bowl-winning 1992 season, and ended their winless streak against Tom Brady in what proved to be Brady's last game in his career.[154] However, they were defeated by the San Francisco 49ers for the second consecutive season, this time in the divisional round, their seventh consecutive divisional round defeat.[155] On February 16, 2022, a settlement of $2.4 million was paid after four cheerleaders accused Rich Dalrymple, the now-retired senior vice president of public relations and communications, of voyeurism in their locker room as they undressed during a 2015 event at AT&T Stadium.[156][157] After the NFL allowed teams to seek blockchain sponsorships,[158] the Cowboys became the first team to do so, signing a multi-year contract with the platform Blockchain.com on April 13, 2022.[159] In 2023, the Cowboys again achieved a 12–5 record, for the third year in a row.[160] The team won the NFC East division for the first time since the 2021 season and the second time in three seasons.[161] They ended up in a three-way tie with the San Francisco 49ers and the Detroit Lions for first place in the NFC at 12–5. However, they lost the conference record tiebreaker to the 49ers but won the head to head tiebreaker over the Lions, giving them the second seed in the playoffs.[162] Although the Cowboys lost to the Buffalo Bills in Week 15, they clinched their third straight playoff berth before taking the field when the Green Bay Packers and Atlanta Falcons lost to the Tampa Bay Buccaneers and Carolina Panthers, respectively.[163] This marked the Cowboys' first run of three consecutive postseason appearances since appearing in six straight from 1991 to 1996. However, the Cowboys collapsed in the playoffs, and, despite having one of the best-ranked offenses and defenses of the league, were crushed 48–32 by their rival, seventh-seeded Green Bay Packers in the Wild Card round, at one point trailing 48–16 during the fourth quarter.[164][165][166] With the loss, the Cowboys became the first team to lose to a #7 seed since the playoff bracket expanded for the 2020–21 NFL playoffs.[167][168][169] This also marked the first time a team failed to reach a Conference Championship Game despite winning at least 12 games in three consecutive seasons.[170] In their seventh season in 1966, the Cowboys agreed to host a second NFL Thanksgiving game; the tradition of a team hosting on Thanksgiving had been popularized by the Detroit Lions (who had hosted a game on the day mostly un-interrupted since moving to Detroit in 1934). General manager Tex Schramm wanted to find a way to boost publicity on a national level for his team, which had struggled for most of the 1960s. In fact, the NFL guaranteed a cut of the gate revenue in the belief that the game would not be a hit because of said struggle. With a kickoff just after 5 p.m. CST,[171] over eighty thousand fans (and millions viewing on CBS) saw the Cowboys beat the Cleveland Browns 26–14 at the Cotton Bowl.[172][173][174] In 1975 and 1977, at the behest of Commissioner Pete Rozelle, the St. Louis Cardinals replaced Dallas as a host team. Dallas then hosted St. Louis in 1976 in an effort by the NFL to give St. Louis national exposure. Although the Cardinals, at the time known as the \"Cardiac Cards\" due to their propensity for winning very close games, were a modest success at the time, the games did not prove as successful. Owing to factors that ranged from ugly contests to opposition from the Kirkwood–Webster Groves Turkey Day Game (a local high school football contest) led to Dallas resuming regular hosting duties in 1978. It was then, after Rozelle asked Dallas to resume hosting Thanksgiving games, that the Cowboys requested (and received) an agreement guaranteeing the Cowboys a spot on Thanksgiving Day for good; as such, the Cowboys play in the late afternoon.[175] The Dallas Cowboys' blue star logo, which represents Texas as \"The Lone Star State,\" is one of the most well-known team logos in professional sports. The blue star originally was a solid shape until a white line and blue border were added in 1964. The logo has remained the same since. Today, the blue star has been extended to not only the Dallas Cowboys, but owner Jerry Jones' defunct AFL team, the Dallas Desperados that used a similar logo based on that of the Cowboys. The blue star also is used on other entries like an imaging facility and storage facility. The Dallas Cowboys' white home jersey has royal blue (PMS 287 C) solid socks, numbers, lettering, and two stripes on the sleeves outlined in black. The home pants are a common metallic silver-green color (PMS 8280 C) that helps bring out the blue in the uniform. The navy (PMS 289 C) road jerseys (nicknamed the \"Stars and Stripes\" jersey) have white lettering and numbers with navy pinstripes. A white/gray/white stripe is on each sleeve as well as the collared V-neck, and a Cowboys star logo is placed upon the stripes. A \"Cowboys\" chest crest is directly under the NFL shield. The away pants are a pearlish metallic-silver color (PMS 8180 C) and like the home pants, enhance the navy in the uniforms. The team uses a serifed font for the lettered player surnames on the jersey nameplates.[4][5] The team's helmets are also a unique silver with a tint of blue known as \"Metallic Silver Blue\" (PMS 8240 C) and have a blue/white/blue vertical stripe placed upon the center of the crown. The Cowboys also include a unique, if subtle, feature on the back of the helmet: a blue strip of Dymo tape with the player's name embossed, placed on the white portion of the stripe at the back of the helmet. When the Dallas Cowboys franchise debuted in 1960, the team's uniform included a white helmet adorned with a simple blue star and a blue-white-blue stripe down the center crown. The team donned blue jerseys with white sleeves and a small blue star on each shoulder for home games and the negative opposite for away games. Their socks also had two horizontal white stripes overlapping the blue. In 1964, the Cowboys opted for a simpler look (adopting essentially the team's current uniform) by changing their jersey/socks to one solid color with three horizontal stripes on the sleeves; the white jersey featured royal blue stripes with a narrow black border, the royal blue jersey white stripes with the same black outline. The star-shouldered jerseys were eliminated; \"TV\" numbers appeared just above the jersey stripes. The new helmet was silver-blue, with a blue-white-blue tri-stripe down the center (the middle white stripe was thicker). The blue \"lone star\" logo was retained, but with a white border setting it off from the silver/blue. The new pants were silver/blue, with a blue-white-blue tri-stripe. In 1964, the NFL allowed teams to wear white jerseys at home; several teams did so, and the Cowboys have worn white at home ever since, except on certain and special \"throwback\" days.[176][177][178] In 1966, the team modified the jerseys, which now featured only two sleeve stripes, slightly wider; the socks followed the same pattern. In 1967 the \"lone star\" helmet decal added a blue outline to the white-bordered star, giving the logo a bigger, bolder look. The logo and this version of the uniform have seen little change to the present day. The only notable changes from 1970 to the present were: During the 1976 season, the blue-white-blue stripe on the crown of the helmets was temporarily changed to red-white-blue to commemorate the United States' bicentennial anniversary. This stripe configuration returned in 2021 and is now worn for one regular season game annually when the team pays tribute to Medal of Honor recipients.[179] In 1994, the NFL celebrated their 75th Anniversary, and the Dallas Cowboys celebrated their back-to-back Super Bowl titles by unveiling a white \"Double-Star\" jersey on Thanksgiving Day. This jersey was used for special occasions and was worn throughout the 1994–95 playoffs. During the same season, the Cowboys also wore their 1960–63 road jersey with a silver helmet for one game as part of a league-wide \"throwback\" policy. During the 1995 season, the team wore the navy \"Double-Star\" jersey for games at Washington and Philadelphia and permanently switched to solid color socks (royal blue for the white uniform, and navy blue for the dark uniform). The navy \"Double-Star\" jersey was not seen again until the NFL's Classic Throwback Weekend on Thanksgiving Day 2001–2003. In 2004, the Cowboys resurrected their original 1960–1963 uniform on Thanksgiving Day. This uniform became the team's alternate or \"third jersey\" and was usually worn at least once a year, primarily Thanksgiving Day. Two exceptions were when the Cowboys wore their normal white uniforms on Thanksgiving in 2007 and 2008. While the team didn't wear the throwback uniform exactly on Thanksgiving Day in those two years, Dallas wore them on a date around Thanksgiving for those two years. In 2007 Dallas wore the throwback uniform on November 29, 2007, against the Green Bay Packers. In 2008 Dallas wore the throwback uniform on November 23, 2008, against the San Francisco 49ers. The team went back to wearing this uniform at home on Thanksgiving Day in 2009 while their opponent was the Oakland Raiders who wore their AFL Legacy Weekend throwbacks. Dallas wore this alternate uniform on October 11, 2009, as part of one of the NFL's AFL Legacy Weekends when they traveled to Kansas City to play the Chiefs who were sporting their AFL Dallas Texans' uniforms. This created a rare game in which neither team wore a white jersey and the first time the Cowboys wore the alternative uniform as a visiting team. The 1960–1963 uniform may also be used on other special occasions. Other instances include the 2005 Monday Night game against the Washington Redskins when the team inducted Troy Aikman, Emmitt Smith, and Michael Irving into the Cowboys Ring of Honor, and the 2006 Christmas Day game against the Philadelphia Eagles. In 2013, the NFL issued a new helmet rule stating that players would no longer be allowed to use alternate helmets due to the league's enhanced concussion awareness. This caused the Cowboys' white 1960s throwback helmets to become non-compliant. However, this rule became moot in 2022 when the NFL once again allowed teams to use an alternate helmet again, and the Cowboys reintroduced the 1960s white helmet. During the \"one-shell era\", in 2013,[180] 2014,[181] 2016,[182] and 2017,[183] the team wore their normal blue jerseys at home for Thanksgiving; the only exceptions were in 2015[184] and 2020[185] when the Cowboys wore the \"Color Rush\" uniforms (see below), and in 2018,[186] 2019[187] and 2021[188] when they wore their regular white uniforms.[189] In 2017, the team initially announced that they will wear blue jerseys at home on a more regular basis, only to rescind soon after.[3][190] In 2015, the Cowboys released their Color Rush uniform, featuring a variation of the 1990s \"Double Star\" alternates with white pants and socks. The uniform was first used in a Thanksgiving game against the Carolina Panthers and in subsequent Thursday Night Football games since 2016. In 2022, the \"Color Rush\" uniforms would be worn with a white helmet; this design would emulate their current silver helmets but without any silver elements.[191] The Cowboys also unveiled a navy uniform-white pants combination which was first used on December 10, 2017, against the Giants. In 1964, Tex Schramm started the tradition of the Cowboys wearing their white jersey at home, contrary to an unofficial rule that teams should wear colored jerseys at home. Schramm did this because he wanted fans to see a variety of opponents' colors at home games.[189][192][193][194][195][176] According to current Cowboys' Equipment Director, Mike McCord, another reason why the team chose to wear white uniforms at home was because of the intense Texas heat during the early part of the season at Texas Stadium.[196][197] Throughout the years, the Cowboys' blue jersey has been popularly viewed to be \"jinxed\" because the team often seemed to lose when they wore them. This purported curse drew attention after the team lost Super Bowl V with the blue jerseys.[198] However, the roots of the curse likely date back earlier to the 1968 divisional playoffs, when the blue-shirted Cowboys were upset by the Cleveland Browns in what turned out to be Don Meredith's final game with the Cowboys. Another example was a 1976 regular season road game against the St. Louis Cardinals, in which the Cardinals elected to wear white as the home team and promptly defeated the then-undefeated Cowboys 21–17 for their first loss in six games.[199] Since the white home uniform tradition began in 1964, the only season Dallas never wore blue uniforms in a regular season game was in the 1972 season, even though they wore them thrice in the preseason.[200] The only other times Dallas wore blue in one regular season game came in 1968,[201] 1975,[202] 1976,[203] 1977,[204] 1998,[205] 2010,[206] and 2020.[207] Conversely, the 2019 season saw Dallas wear their blue uniforms eight times, the most of any season.[208][209] Since the 1970 NFL-AFL merger, league rules were changed to allow the Super Bowl home team to pick their choice of jersey. Most of the time, Dallas will wear their blue jerseys when they visit Washington, Philadelphia (sometimes), Miami, or one of the handful of other teams that traditionally wear their white jerseys at home during the first half of the season due to the hot climates in their respective cities or other means. Occasionally opposing teams will wear their white jerseys at home to try to invoke the curse,[210] such as when the Philadelphia Eagles hosted the Cowboys in the 1980 NFC Championship Game,[211] as well as their November 4, 2007, meeting. Various other teams followed suit in the 1980s. Although Dallas has made several tweaks to their blue jerseys over the years, Schramm said he did not believe in the curse.[212] Since the league began allowing teams to use an alternate jersey, the Cowboys' alternates have been primarily blue versions of past jerseys and the Cowboys have generally had success when wearing these blue alternates. With the implementation of the 2013 NFL helmet rule for alternate jerseys, the team decided instead to wear their regular blue jerseys for their Thanksgiving game, something they have not done at home since Schramm started the white-jersey-at-home tradition.[189] As of the 2023 season, the Cowboys have a cumulative 97–100–3 regular season record in their blue uniforms. They are also 15–11 at home while wearing the blue uniforms since 2001. The Cowboys also sport a 8–2 record when wearing the primary blue uniform/white pants combination since its 2017 debut. The Cowboys are 2–6 in playoff games while wearing the blue uniforms. The only victories with the blue uniforms came in the 1978 NFC Championship Game against the Los Angeles Rams, and the 2022 NFC Wild Card Round against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers.[213] With the Dallas Cowboys traditionally hosting Thanksgiving Day games, the team donned new uniforms when they unveiled their white \"Double-Star\" jersey for the first time on November 24, 1994.[214] This game later became synonymous with future Cowboys Head Coach (2010–2019); then 3rd string Quarterback Jason Garrett as he led a come-from-behind victory against the Green Bay Packers.[215] In the 2004 season, the team went further into Cowboys history by choosing to don blue jerseys worn in their first 4 years of existence, which included white helmets and pants. However, keeping consistent with modern marketing, navy blue was used for this version as opposed to the original 1960-1963 royal color jersey.[3] Aside from the 2007 and 2008 seasons, the Cowboys continued to use this \"throwback\" uniform through Thanksgiving Day 2012. Before the start of the 2013 season, the NFL announced a \"One-helmet\" rule to help prevent potential player concussions.[216] This regulation also prevented the Cowboys from pairing the white helmets with the throwback uniforms, as the team will often use the traditional silver-blue as their primary helmets throughout the season. In the 2015 season, the Cowboys chose to wear a variation of the 1994 \"Double-Star\" jersey as their Color Rush on Thanksgiving Day against the Carolina Panthers on November 26, 2015.[217] Since then, the Color Rush was only used again on Thanksgiving against the Washington Football Team on November 26, 2020.[218] In all other seasons, the team opted to wear their standard white or blue uniforms. In 2022, the NFL restored the use of alternate helmets and the Cowboys reinstated the white helmet and navy 'throwback\" uniforms on November 24, 2022, against the New York Giants.[219] The Cotton Bowl is a stadium which opened in 1932 and became known as \"The House That Doak Built\" due to the immense crowds that former SMU running back Doak Walker drew to the stadium during his college career in the late 1940s. Originally known as the Fair Park Bowl, it is located in Fair Park, site of the State Fair of Texas. Concerts or other events using a stage allow the playing field to be used for additional spectators. The Cotton Bowl was the longtime home of the annual Cotton Bowl Classic college football bowl game, for which the stadium is named. (Beginning with the January 2010 game, the Cotton Bowl Classic has been played at AT&T Stadium in Arlington.) The Dallas Cowboys called the Cotton Bowl home for 11 years, from the team's formation in 1960 until 1971, when the Cowboys moved to Texas Stadium. It is the only Cowboys stadium within the Dallas city limits. The Cowboys hosted the Green Bay Packers for the 1966 NFL Championship at the Cotton Bowl.[220] For the majority of the franchise's history the Cowboys played their home games at Texas Stadium. Just outside the city of Dallas, the stadium was located in Irving. The stadium opened on October 24, 1971, at a cost of $35 million and with a seating capacity of 65,675. The stadium was famous for its hole-in-the-roof dome. The roof's worn paint had become so unsightly in the early 2000s that it was repainted in the summer of 2006 by the City of Irving. It was the first time the famed roof was repainted since Texas Stadium opened. The roof was structurally independent from the stadium it covered. The Cowboys lost their final game at Texas Stadium to the Baltimore Ravens, 33–24, on December 20, 2008. After Cowboys Stadium was opened in 2009, the Cowboys turned over the facility to the City of Irving. In 2009, it was replaced as home of the Cowboys by Cowboys Stadium, which officially opened on May 27, 2009, in Arlington.[221] Texas Stadium was demolished by implosion on April 11, 2010.[222] AT&T Stadium, previously named Cowboys Stadium, is a domed stadium with a retractable roof in Arlington. After failed negotiations to build a new stadium on the site of the Cotton Bowl, Jerry Jones, along with the city of Arlington, Texas, a suburb of Fort Worth, funded the stadium at a cost of $1.3 billion.[223] The stadium is located in Tarrant County, the first time the Cowboys has called a stadium home outside of Dallas County. It was completed on May 29, 2009, and seats 80,000, but is expandable to seat up to 100,000. AT&T Stadium is among the largest domed stadiums in the world.[224] A highlight of AT&T Stadium is its gigantic, center-hung high-definition television screen, at one point the largest in the world.[225] The 160 by 72 feet (49 by 22 m), 11,520-square-foot (1,070 m2) scoreboard surpassed the 8,736 sq ft (812 m2) screen that opened in 2009 at the renovated Kauffman Stadium in Kansas City as the world's largest.[226][227][228] In 2011, Charlotte Motor Speedway unveiled its plans for a new HDTV screen larger than the one in AT&T Stadium;[225] that larger screen has since been completed.[229] At the debut pre-season game of Cowboys Stadium, a punt by Tennessee Titans kicker, A. J. Trapasso, hit the 2,100 in. screen above the field. The punt deflected and was ruled in-play until Titans coach Jeff Fisher informed the officials that the punt struck the scoreboard. (Many believe Trapasso was trying to hit the suspended scoreboard, based on replays and the angle of the kick.) The scoreboard is, however, within the regulation of the NFL guidelines – hanging approximately five feet above the minimum height. No punts hit the scoreboard during the entire 2009 regular season during an actual game. Also, on August 22, 2009, the day after AJ Trapasso hit the screen, many fans touring the facility noted that half of the field was removed with large cranes re-positioning the screen. According to some fans, a tour guide explained that Jerry Jones invited a few professional soccer players to drop kick soccer balls to try to hit the screen. Once he observed them hitting it consistently he had the screen moved up another 10 feet. The first regular season home game of the 2009 season was against the New York Giants. A league record-setting 105,121 fans showed up to fill Cowboys Stadium for the game before which the traditional \"blue star\" at the 50-yard line was unveiled for the first time; however, the Cowboys lost in the final seconds, 33–31.[230] The Cowboys got their first regular-season home win on September 28, 2009. They beat the Carolina Panthers 21–7 with 90,588 in attendance. The game was televised on ESPN's Monday Night Football and marked a record 42nd win for the Cowboys on Monday Night Football.[231] On July 25, 2013, the Cowboys announced that AT&T would be taking over the rights to the name of the stadium.[232] Dallas Cowboys training camp locations:[233] Ever since the team joined the NFL in 1960, the franchise have garnered strong fan support in both the Dallas–Fort Worth metroplex and the state of Texas. With its strong fanbase across the country, including the notable presence of fans at road games, the Cowboys are often referred to as \"America's Team\".[234][235][236] Despite the historical success of the franchise and a large Cowboys' fanbase, many fans of other NFL teams have come to dislike the Cowboys.[237][238][239][240] Over the years, the Cowboys' fanbase had been labeled as the most annoying in all of sports.[241] ESPN host and commentator Stephen A. Smith has validated this claim.[242] The NFC East, composed of the Cowboys, Philadelphia Eagles, the Washington Commanders and New York Giants, is one of the least-changed divisions of the original six formed in the wake of the NFL-AFL merger (its only major changes being the relocation of the Cardinals franchise from St. Louis to Arizona and its subsequent move to the NFC West in the league's 2002 realignment). Three of the four teams have been division rivals since the Cowboys' entry into the NFL. As such, the Cowboys have some of the longest and fiercest rivalries in the sport. The competition between the Cowboys and the Philadelphia Eagles has been particularly intense since the late 1970s, when the long-moribund Eagles returned to contention.[243] In January 1981, the two teams faced off in the NFC Championship, with Philadelphia winning 20–7. A series of other factors heightened tensions during the 1980s and 1990s, including several provocative actions by Philadelphia fans and Eagles head coach Buddy Ryan. Among these were the 1989 Bounty Bowls in which Ryan allegedly placed a bounty on Dallas kicker Luis Zendejas and Veterans Stadium fans pelted the Cowboys with snowballs and other debris. A 1999 game in Philadelphia saw Eagles fans cheering as Michael Irvin lay motionless on the field at Veterans Stadium. In 2008, the rivalry became more intense when in the last game of the year in which both teams could clinch a playoff spot with a victory, the Philadelphia Eagles defeated the Cowboys 44–6. The following season, the Cowboys avenged that defeat by beating the Eagles three times: twice during the regular season to claim the title as NFC East champions and once more in a wild-card playoff game by a combined score of 78–30, including a 24–0 shutout in week 17. That three-game sweep was Dallas' first over any opponent and the longest winning streak against the Eagles since 1992–1995 when Dallas won seven straight matches against Philadelphia. During the 2013 season, Dallas won the first meeting 17–3 at Lincoln Financial Field in Philadelphia. The two teams met again in Week 17 at AT&T Stadium with the winner clinching the 2013 NFC East title. The Cowboys came into the game at a disadvantage with starting quarterback Tony Romo out with a season-ending back injury, which put backup Kyle Orton as the starter. It was a tight game with the Eagles up 24–22 with less than 2 minutes to go in regulation. Orton got the ball and started driving down the field when he was intercepted by the Eagles defense, which ended the game and the Cowboys season. In 2014, the Cowboys and Eagles both won against each other on the road with Philadelphia posting a dominant 33–10 win on Thanksgiving Day in Dallas, and Dallas returning the favor two weeks later by defeating the Eagles 38–27 at Lincoln Financial Field in Philadelphia. The second game between these rivals clinched a playoff spot for Dallas and led to formerly first-place Philadelphia missing out on the post-season. Dallas leads the all-time series 73–56.[244] The first game ever played between the New York Giants and Cowboys was a 31–31 tie on December 4, 1960. Dallas logged its first win in the series on October 29, 1961, and New York's first was on November 11, 1962. Among the more notable moments in the rivalry was the Giants' defeat of Dallas in the 2007 playoffs en route to their victory in Super Bowl XLII and winning the first regular-season game played at Cowboys Stadium in 2009. Dallas currently leads the all-time series 75–47–2.[245] The Washington Commanders and the Dallas Cowboys enjoy what has been called by Sports Illustrated the top NFL rivalry of all time and \"one of the greatest in sports.\" Some sources trace the enmity to before the Cowboys were even formed, due to a longstanding disagreement between Washington owner George Preston Marshall and Cowboys founder Clint Murchison, Jr. over the creation of a new football team in the South, due to Marshall's TV monopoly in that region. The two teams' storied on-field rivalry goes back to 1960 when the two clubs first played each other, resulting in a 26–14 Washington victory. Since that time, the two teams have met in 126 regular-season contests and two NFC Championships. Dallas leads the regular season all-time series 78–46–2, and Washington leads the all-time playoff series 2–0.[246] The Cowboys currently have a 14–7 advantage over Washington at FedEx Field. Some notable moments in the rivalry include Washington's victory over Dallas in the 1982 NFC Championship and the latter's 1989 win over Washington for their only victory that season. The last Cowboys game with Tom Landry as coach was a win over Washington on December 11, 1988. In the 2010s, Washington has struggled to consistently compete for the Division title, but still play the Cowboys particularly tough, posting an impressive upset victory against Dallas in 2014, despite being outclassed by the Cowboys in the overall standings. The 2010s also included an important game in week 17 of 2012 which saw Washington defeat Dallas 28–18 to win the NFC East. The bitter rivalry between the Dallas Cowboys and San Francisco 49ers has been going on since the 1970s.[247][248] The NFL Top 10 ranked this rivalry to be the tenth best in the history of the NFL. San Francisco has played Dallas in seven postseason games. The Cowboys defeated the 49ers in the 1970 and 1971 NFC Championship games, and again in the 1972 Divisional Playoff Game. The 1981 NFC Championship Game in San Francisco, which saw the 49ers' Joe Montana complete a game-winning pass to Dwight Clark in the final minute (now known as The Catch) is one of the most famous games in NFL history. The rivalry became even more intense during the 1992–1994 seasons. San Francisco and Dallas faced each other in the NFC Championship Game three separate times. Dallas won the first two match-ups, and San Francisco won the third. In each of these pivotal match-ups, the game's victor went on to win the Super Bowl. Both the Cowboys and the 49ers are tied for third all-time in Super Bowl victories to the Pittsburgh Steelers and New England Patriots, with five each. The 49ers-Cowboys rivalry is also part of the larger cultural rivalry between California and Texas. The 49ers lead the all-time series with a record of 20–19–1.[249] The rivalry between the Dallas Cowboys and the Green Bay Packers[250] is one of the best known intra-conference rivalries in the NFL. The two teams do not play every year; instead, they play once every three years due to the NFL's rotating division schedules, or if the two teams finish in the same place in their respective divisions, they would play the ensuing season. The rivalry has also resulted in notable playoff games.[251][252] The all-time regular seasons series record is 20–17 in favor of the Packers, and the postseason series is also in favor of the Packers at 5–4.[253] The Cowboys also had a fierce rivalry with the Los Angeles Rams, particularly during the 1970s and 1980s. The two teams played eight postseason games during this period, including two NFC championship games. Between 1975 and 1980, the Cowboys faced the Rams in the playoffs five times in a six-year period. In both 1975 and 1978, the Cowboys won the NFC championship on the road in blowout fashion, only to be followed by close defeats at home in next year's divisional round. The 1980 Wild Card Round saw Dallas follow up last year's playoff defeat with another blowout victory. As of 2022, the Cowboys and Rams tied the all-time regular season series 18–18, but the Rams lead the all-time playoff series 5–4, having recently defeated the Cowboys in the 2018 Divisional Round.[254][255] Between the Dallas Cowboys and Minnesota Vikings,[256] the Cowboys lead the all-time series 18–15. The teams have met seven times in the post-season, the Cowboys third most played playoff opponent. The rivalry is home to many key memories, including the famous 1975 Hail Mary pass against the Vikings, the Herschel Walker trade, the Randy Moss Thanksgiving game, and Brett Favre torching the Cowboys in what would be his last playoff win of his career in 2009. As of the 2023 season, the Cowboys lead the all-time series 19–15.[257] The Cowboys have an intrastate interconference rivalry with the Houston Texans for which they compete in either a preseason or regular season game for bragging rights in Texas, a tradition started between the teams prior to the Oilers relocating to Nashville, Tennessee to become the Tennessee Titans. The Texans defeated the Cowboys in the team's inaugural season in 2002. The Cowboys lead the all-time series 4–2.[258] The two teams met in the first regular-season game the Cowboys ever played in 1960 (a 35–28 loss to the Steelers), the first-ever regular-season victory for the expansion Cowboys in 1961, and would later meet in three Super Bowls, all of them closely contested events. The Steelers-Cowboys is to date the Super Bowl matchup with the most contests. The Steelers won Super Bowl X and Super Bowl XIII; both games were decided in the final seconds, first on a last-second throw by Roger Staubach, then as a fourth-quarter rally by Dallas fell short on an onside kick.[259][260] The Cowboys won Super Bowl XXX in January 1996.[261] It is said that the rivalry was fueled in the 1970s due to the stark contrast of the teams: the Cowboys, being more of a \"flashy\" team with Roger Staubach's aerial attack and the \"flex\" Doomsday Defense; while the Steelers were more of a \"blue-collar\" team with a strong running game and the 1970s-esque Steel Curtain defense, a contrast that still exists today.[262] In addition, both teams have national fan bases rivaled by few NFL teams, and both come from areas with a strong following for football at all levels. Dallas leads the all-time series 17–16 including the playoffs.[245] Running backs (RB) Wide receivers (WR) Tight ends (TE) Defensive linemen (DL) Defensive backs (DB) Special teams Reserve 53 active, 13 reserve, 15 practice squad (+1 exempt) [263] The Cowboys have had seven players win Super Bowl MVP.[290] Unlike many NFL teams, the Cowboys do not retire jersey numbers of past standouts as a matter of policy. Instead, the team has a \"Ring of Honor\", which is on permanent display encircling the field. Originally at Texas Stadium, the ring is now on display at AT&T Stadium in Arlington. The first inductee was Bob Lilly in 1975 and by 2005, the ring contained 17 names, all former Dallas players except for one head coach and one general manager/president. The Ring of Honor has been a source of controversy over the years. Tex Schramm was believed to be a \"one-man committee\" in choosing inductees and many former Cowboys players and fans felt that Schramm deliberately excluded linebacker Lee Roy Jordan because of a bitter contract dispute the two had during Jordan's playing days. When Jerry Jones bought the team he inherited Schramm's Ring of Honor \"power\" and immediately inducted Jordan. Jones also has sparked controversy regarding his decisions in handling the \"Ring of Honor\". For four years he was unsuccessful in convincing Tom Landry to accept induction. Meanwhile, he refused to induct Tex Schramm (even after Schramm's induction to the Pro Football Hall of Fame). In 1993, thanks in part to the efforts of Roger Staubach as an intermediary, Landry accepted induction and had a ceremony on the day of that year's Cowboys-Giants game (Landry had played and coached for the Giants). In 2003, Jones chose to induct Tex Schramm. Schramm and Jones held a joint press conference at Texas Stadium announcing the induction. Unfortunately, Schramm did not live to see his ceremonial induction at the Cowboys-Eagles game that fall. Troy Aikman, all-time NFL leading rusher Emmitt Smith, and Michael Irvin, known as \"The Triplets,\" were inducted into the Ring of Honor during halftime at a Monday Night Football home game against the archrival Washington Redskins on September 19, 2005.[291] Defensive end Charles Haley, offensive lineman Larry Allen, and wide receiver Drew Pearson were inducted into the Ring of Honor during halftime of the Cowboys' game vs. the Seattle Seahawks on November 6, 2011.[292] Safety Darren Woodson was inducted on November 1, 2015.[293] Executive Gil Brandt was inducted on November 29, 2018.[294] The most recent inductees were DeMarcus Ware, who was inducted on October 29, 2023, and Jimmy Johnson, who was inducted on December 30, 2023.[295][296] The Dallas Cowboys do not officially retire jersey numbers; however, some are kept \"unofficially inactive\".[298][299] As of 2022, six numbers have been kept out of circulation: Troy Aikman's No. 8, Roger Staubach's No. 12, Bob Hayes' and Emmitt Smith's No. 22,[300] Bob Lilly's No. 74, and Jason Witten's No. 82.[301] The Cowboys are one of three NFL teams that do not officially retire numbers, with the other two being the Atlanta Falcons and Las Vegas Raiders. The Cowboys have had the number one overall pick in the NFL Draft on three occasions.[319] → Coaching staff → Front office → More NFL staffs As of 2010[update], the Cowboys' flagship radio station is KRLD-FM.[320] Brad Sham is the team's longtime play-by-play voice.[321] Working alongside him is former Cowboy quarterback Babe Laufenberg, who returned in 2007 after a one-year absence to replace former safety Charlie Waters.[322] The Cowboys, who retain rights to all announcers, chose not to renew Laufenberg's contract in 2006 and brought in Waters. However, Laufenberg did work as the analyst on the \"Blue Star Network\", which televises Cowboys preseason games not shown on national networks. The anchor station is KTVT, the CBS owned and operated station in Dallas. Previous stations which aired Cowboys games included KVIL-FM, KRLD, and KLUV-FM. Kristi Scales is the sideline reporter on the radio broadcasts.[323] During his tenure as Cowboys coach, Tom Landry co-hosted his own coach's show with late veteran sportscaster Frank Glieber and later with Brad Sham. Landry's show was famous for his analysis of raw game footage and for him and his co-host making their NFL \"predictions\" at the end of each show. Glieber is one of the original voices of the Cowboys Radio Network, along with Bill Mercer, famous for calling the Ice Bowl of 1967 and both Super Bowl V and VI. Mercer is perhaps best known as the ringside commentator of WCCW in the 1980s. Upon Mercer's departure, Verne Lundquist joined the network, and became their play-by-play announcer by 1977, serving eight years in that capacity before handing those chores permanently over to Brad Sham, who joined the network in 1977 as the color analyst and occasional fill-in for Lundquist. Longtime WFAA-TV sports anchor Dale Hansen was the Cowboys color analyst with Brad Sham as the play-by-play announcer from 1985 to 1996.[324] Dave Garrett served as the Cowboys' play-by-play announcer from 1995 to 1997, when Brad Sham left the team and joined the Texas Rangers' radio network team as well as broadcast Sunday Night Football on Westwood One. Seeking to expand its radio broadcasting scope nationally, the Cowboys began a five-year partnership with Compass Media Networks on February 2, 2011. The result was the America's Team Radio Network, a supplement to the franchise's regional one.[325] Beginning with the 2011 season, Kevin Burkhardt and Danny White handled the broadcasts, with Jerry Recco as the studio host.[326] The Dallas Cowboys fight song, \"Cowboys Stampede March\" by Tom Merriman Big Band was the official fight song of the Dallas Cowboys.[327] The Cowboys now play We Dem Boyz by Wiz Khalifa for starting defensive line, because of the saying \"How Bout Dem Cowboys.\" For every touchdown scored by the Cowboys at a home game the song \"Cowboys and Cut Cigars\" by The Burning of Rome is played after a train horn.[328]",

                "title": "Matt Gaetz - Wikipedia",
                "content": "Matthew Louis Gaetz II (/ɡeɪts/ GAYTS; born May 7, 1982) is an American politician and lawyer who served as the U.S. representative for Florida's 1st congressional district from 2017 until his resignation in 2024. His district included all of Escambia, Okaloosa, and Santa Rosa counties, and portions of Walton County. A member of the Republican Party and a self-described libertarian populist, Gaetz is widely regarded as a proponent of far-right politics as well as a staunch ally of Donald Trump.[1] The son of prominent Florida politician Don Gaetz and grandson of North Dakota politician Jerry Gaetz, Gaetz was raised in Fort Walton Beach, Florida. After graduating from William & Mary Law School, he briefly worked in private practice before running for state representative. He served in the Florida House of Representatives from 2010 until 2016, and received national attention for defending Florida's \"stand-your-ground law\". In 2016, he was elected to the U.S. House of Representatives, and was re-elected in 2018, 2020, 2022, and 2024. In 2020, Gaetz was accused of sex trafficking and having sexual relationships with minors. After an investigation, the United States Department of Justice (DOJ) decided not to charge him. Prior to his resignation as a representative, Gaetz was being investigated by the House Ethics Committee. In October 2023, Gaetz filed a motion to vacate which led to the removal of Kevin McCarthy as speaker of the U.S. House of Representatives. President-elect Donald Trump announced he would nominate Gaetz to serve as United States attorney general on November 13, 2024, which led to a negative reception from some Senate Republicans. Upon Trump's announcement, Gaetz resigned from the House of Representatives. A week later, Gaetz withdrew himself from consideration for the post of attorney general. Though he had already won reelection to the 119th United States Congress, he has said he does not intend to rejoin Congress. Gaetz is set to host a political talk show airing weeknights on One America News Network, airing from January 2025 onwards. In December 2024, the House Ethics Committee released a report which found evidence that Gaetz paid for sex—including with a 17-year-old—and abused illegal drugs during his tenure in the U.S. House of Representatives.[2] Matthew Louis Gaetz II was born on May 7, 1982, in Hollywood, Florida, to Victoria (née Quertermous) and Don Gaetz, who later became a prominent local politician,[3][4][5] earning Matthew Gaetz the nickname \"Baby Gaetz\".[6] He has a younger sister.[7] He grew up in a conservative and religious family near Fort Walton Beach, and graduated from Niceville High School.[8][9] He graduated from Florida State University in 2003 with a Bachelor of Science in interdisciplinary sciences, and from the William & Mary Law School in 2007 with a Juris Doctor.[10][11] Gaetz was admitted to the Florida Bar on February 6, 2008.[12] Gaetz's father represented parts of northwest Florida as a member of the Florida State Senate from 2006 to 2016, was Senate president from 2012 to 2014, and was elected to the Florida Senate again in 2024.[13] Gaetz's grandfather, Jerry Gaetz, was the mayor of Rugby, North Dakota, and a candidate for lieutenant governor of North Dakota at the 1964 North Dakota Republican Party state convention, where he died of a heart attack.[14] After graduating from law school,[15] Gaetz worked at the law firm Keefe, Anchors & Gordon (now AnchorsGordon)[16] in Fort Walton Beach.[7] In October 2021, the Florida bar suspended Gaetz from practicing law due to unpaid fees.[17] He was reinstated after the $265 fee was paid.[18] In March 2010, after Republican state representative Ray Sansom's resignation on corruption charges in February 2010,[19] Gaetz ran in the special election to succeed Sansom in the 4th district, which included southern Santa Rosa County and Okaloosa County.[20] In a crowded Republican primary that included Craig Barker, Kabe Woods, Jerry G. Melvin, and Bill Garvie, Gaetz won with 43 percent of the vote.[20] In the special general election, Gaetz defeated Democratic nominee Jan Fernald with 66 percent of the vote.[21] During his campaign, Gaetz received almost $480,000 in contributions, about five times more than anyone else in the field, and almost 50 times more than Fernald, including $100,000 of his own money.[7] Gaetz was unopposed for a full term in 2010.[22] In 2012, following the reconfiguration of Florida House of Representatives districts, Gaetz's district no longer contained any of Santa Rosa County. He was reelected unopposed in 2012[23] and 2014.[24] While serving in the state house, Gaetz and state senator Joe Negron proposed legislation that would hasten the execution of many inmates on Florida's death row by requiring the governor to sign an execution warrant for those who had exhausted their appeals.[25] He also joined state senator Greg Evers in proposing legislation to eliminate the federal ethanol content mandate that 10 percent of gasoline sold in Florida contain ethanol;[26][27] Governor Rick Scott signed the legislation in May 2013.[28] In 2015, Gaetz was one of two members to vote against a Florida bill which criminalized revenge porn, due to \"personal animosity\". He had successfully blocked the bill previously.[29] Florida House speaker Will Weatherford announced that he would order hearings on the stand-your-ground law.[30] Gaetz, the chairman of the Criminal Justice Subcommittee, was tasked with reviewing the legislation; he announced before hearings that he would not support changing \"one damn comma\", but said he would listen to both sides' testimony.[31][32] After the hearings, he authored legislation to allow defendants who successfully used a stand-your-ground defense during trial to be able to expunge relevant information from their criminal records.[33] When his subcommittee was considering legislation that would keep suspects' mugshots off the Internet until their convictions, Gaetz brought up his 2008 arrest and non-conviction, arguing that his mistakes made him who he is and that publicly available mugshots \"could be a problem for those unaccustomed to publicity\".[34] In 2015, Gaetz supported the presidential campaign of Jeb Bush.[35] Bush emailed Gaetz about introducing a bill to change the 2016 Florida Republican presidential primary to an earlier date in order to benefit Bush, Florida's former governor.[36] Don Gaetz, then the president of the Florida Senate, also endorsed Bush, along with several other members of Florida's state legislature.[37] In 2013, Gaetz announced that, in 2016, he would run for the 1st district State Senate seat held by his father, Don Gaetz, who was term-limited in 2016.[38] On March 21, 2016, Gaetz withdrew from the race, choosing instead to run for the U.S. House seat representing Florida's 1st congressional district; the incumbent, Jeff Miller, had announced 11 days earlier that he would not seek reelection.[39] On August 30, 2016, Gaetz won the Republican primary with 35.7 percent of the vote to Greg Evers's 21.5 percent and Cris Dosev's 20.6 percent, along with five other candidates.[40] This virtually assured Gaetz of victory in the general election; with a Cook Partisan Voting Index of R+22, the 1st is Florida's most Republican district, and one of the most Republican in the nation. In the November 8 general election, Gaetz defeated Democratic nominee Steven Specht with 69 percent of the vote.[41] He is only the seventh person to represent this district since 1933 (the district was numbered the 3rd before 1963). Though a financial disclosure form Gaetz filed in 2016 showed a net worth of $388,000, he donated $200,000 of his own money to his congressional campaign. He also resigned from two Florida House political action committees he had started and chaired; the PACs closed down and transferred $380,000 to a federal super PAC, North Florida Neighbors, whose purpose was to support Gaetz's congressional campaign.[7] Following the death of Miami Marlins pitcher José Fernández, Gaetz criticized the athletes protesting during the national anthem in a tweet on September 25, 2016.[42][43] Gaetz was listed as a member of the moderate Republican Main Street Partnership from at least January to June 2017.[44][45][46] Gaetz served as a top campaign adviser to Ron DeSantis during his 2018 gubernatorial campaign. He managed debate preparations and \"drafted early administration organizational charts, helped steer early policy decisions and played a huge role in DeSantis' appointments\", according to Politico.[47] Gaetz hired Darren Beattie as a speechwriter in April 2019. Beattie had previously been fired as a speechwriter for the Trump administration after attending a conference associated with white nationalists.[48] Gaetz attended political rallies in 2018 and 2019 at which members of the Proud Boys were present.[49][50] After the 2020 State of the Union Address, Gaetz filed an ethics complaint against speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi, arguing that she had committed a \"flagrant violation of decorum\" and perhaps broken the law by ripping up her copy of the speech.[51] Gaetz announced that he would no longer accept campaign contributions from federal political action committees in February 2020.[52] House Republican leader Kevin McCarthy complained on a January 10, 2021, phone call that Gaetz was unnecessarily \"putting people in jeopardy\", noting that the rioters at the U.S. Capitol on January 6 \"came prepared with rope\". The conversation was reported in April 2022.[53] Gaetz and Georgia representative Marjorie Taylor Greene began a nationwide \"America First Tour\" on May 7, 2021, in The Villages, Florida.[54] During the tour, Gaetz and Greene repeated debunked claims of fraud in the 2020 election, attacked Big Tech and, at one event, argued that the Second Amendment was for \"maintaining, within the citizenry, the ability to maintain an armed rebellion against the government, if that becomes necessary.\"[55][56] As a consequence of the controversy the speakers had generated, their appearance at a conference site at Laguna Hills, in Orange County, California, was canceled.[57] Gaetz was one of 21 House Republicans to vote against a resolution to give the Congressional Gold Medal to police officers who defended the U.S. Capitol on January 6 in June 2021.[58] Gaetz invited Corey Ryan Beekman to lead the pledge of allegiance at a Judiciary Committee hearing in February 2023. Beekman was charged with murder in 2019 in Michigan, and the victim's family criticized the invitation.[59][60][61] Gaetz apologized to the family.[62] Republicans regained a narrow House majority in the 2022 midterm elections. Although sitting minority Leader Kevin McCarthy sought the speakership and had the support of 213 members, he needed five more votes to reach a majority to be elected. Certain members of the Freedom Caucus, including Gaetz, could contribute the required margin. Democrats held 212 votes, with one seat unfilled due to the November death of a holdover incumbent. The anti-McCarthy members withheld more than four votes through 14 ballots. They were thought to be holding out for substantial concessions regarding House rules and committee chair assignments. Their withholding of votes prevented McCarthy earning a majority of votes needed for the speakership.[63] Thirteen months earlier, Gaetz had discussed with former president Trump the possibility of getting Trump elected to the speakership, for which House membership is not required.[64] Gaetz nominated him once and voted for Trump on the 7th, 8th and 11th ballots.[65] After midnight, January 7, on the 15th and last ballot, Gaetz switched his vote to \"present\", lowering the number of votes McCarthy needed and allowing him to win the speakership.[66] On October 2, 2023, Gaetz filed a resolution to oust McCarthy from his role as speaker of the U.S. House of Representatives after the latter had negotiated with Democrats to pass a shutdown-averting continuing resolution which did not include fiscally conservative reforms.[67][68] Gaetz's resolution ended up passing by a vote of 216–210.[69] In April 2024, McCarthy accused Gaetz of filing the motion to oust him as a means of protecting himself against allegations of having had sex with a 17-year-old minor.[70][71][72] According to McCarthy, the House ethics committee had been investigating the case since 2021, prior to McCarthy's appointment as speaker of the House.[73] On February 26, 2019, the night before the scheduled public hearing of Michael Cohen, Trump's former personal attorney, before the House Oversight Committee, Gaetz directed a tweet to Cohen that implied without evidence that Cohen had had multiple extramarital affairs and also suggested his wife might be unfaithful while he was imprisoned due to new information disclosed to her.[74] Other members of Congress saw the tweet as an attempt to intimidate a witness.[75][76] Gaetz initially defended his tweet, saying it was part of \"witness testing, not witness tampering\" and \"I don't threaten anybody.\" Asked to clarify, he said his \"tweet speaks for itself\".[77][78] After sharp criticism from other members of Congress and an implicit rebuke by speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi,[79][80] Gaetz deleted the tweet and posted a tweet in which he apologized.[78][76][81] Despite not being a member of the House Oversight Committee,[78] Gaetz appeared at Cohen's hearing, saying that he wanted to observe and ask questions.[82] During the hearing, U.S. Virgin Islands delegate Stacey Plaskett, a member of the Oversight Committee, recommended that Gaetz be referred to both the House Ethics Committee and criminal prosecutors for witness intimidation and tampering.[80][83] After the hearing, Gaetz reportedly texted an apology to Cohen, who thanked him for it.[84] The Florida Bar opened an investigation into Gaetz for the tweet,[85][86] as did the House Ethics Committee.[87] In August 2019, the Florida Bar announced it had found no probable cause that Gaetz had violated its rules.[88] Politico reported in April 2020 that Gaetz had spent nearly $200,000 of taxpayer funds renting an office from Collier Merrill, a Pensacola real estate developer and restaurateur and longtime friend, adviser, campaign donor, and legal client.[89] Gaetz and Merrill separately told Politico that Gaetz paid below-market rent for the space, but Gaetz later said that the rent was \"at or below market rate\".[90] House rules explicitly disallow below-market rentals, and require that parties to such leases \"have [not] had, [n]or continue to have, a professional or legal relationship (except as a landlord and tenant)\".[89] On July 1, 2020, the Office of Congressional Ethics notified Gaetz it had terminated its review of the lease arrangements.[91] In July 2020, Politico reported that its investigation had found expenditures by Gaetz that appeared to violate the House ethics rules: spending tens of thousands of dollars for a speech-writing consultant and having a private company install a television studio in his father's home in Niceville, Florida, which Gaetz uses when he appears on television.[92] Gaetz's office acknowledged that he spent $28,000 on speech-writing services, which is prohibited by House rules except in special circumstances and with prior approval from congressional officials, but said that it was a clerical error that would be fixed.[93][94] Of the television studio, Gaetz said that the company received $100 per month from his office, an amount not reported in his congressional spending records, and also charged television networks each time a network connected to the studio.[92] A statement from Gaetz's office said the arrangement complied with House rules, and that during the setup process, his office consulted with the House Ethics Committee and the House Administration Committee.[94] Gaetz and a dozen other Republican House members skipped votes and enlisted others to vote for them in late February 2021, citing the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. But he and the other members were actually attending the Conservative Political Action Conference, which was held at the same time as their absences.[95] In response, the Campaign for Accountability, an ethics watchdog group, filed a complaint with the House Committee on Ethics and requested an investigation into Gaetz and the other lawmakers.[96] The Intercept reported in March 2023 that Gaetz had hired Derrick Miller as his military legislative aide. Miller spent eight years in prison after he was convicted of murdering a civilian during his army service in Afghanistan.[97] For the 118th Congress:[98] President-elect Trump announced he would nominate Gaetz to serve as United States attorney general on November 13, 2024.[104] Gaetz resigned from the U.S. House of Representatives shortly after the announcement.[105] His planned nomination was received negatively by multiple Senate Republicans, several of whom indicated that they would not support it due to standing allegations against him and perceived lack of qualifications.[106][107] Gaetz announced on X that he was withdrawing his name from consideration as attorney general, citing the fact that his nomination was becoming a distraction for the Trump transition, on November 21, 2024.[108][109] Though he had already won reelection to the 119th United States Congress, he has said he does not intend to rejoin Congress.[110] The procedure for determining the next representative to fill Gaetz's former seat in the US House is to hold an interim election in Gaetz's former Florida district. Florida Governor Ron DeSantis has already requested for such an election to be scheduled.[111] Gaetz will host a political talk show airing weeknights on One America News Network at 9 p.m. Eastern starting in January 2025.[112] Gaetz has self-identified as a \"libertarian populist\".[113] Observers have described his views as far-right.[1] In January 2018, Gaetz invited Charles C. Johnson, an alt-right activist and Holocaust denier, to attend Donald Trump's State of the Union address.[114] Johnson previously raised money for the neo-Nazi website The Daily Stormer.[115] Gaetz defended Johnson in an interview, saying that Johnson was neither a Holocaust denier nor a white supremacist.[114] Gaetz has endorsed the white nationalist Great Replacement theory. In 2021, he called the Anti-Defamation League a \"racist organization\" after it condemned Tucker Carlson's promotion of Great Replacement theory. Gaetz said that Carlson \"is CORRECT about Replacement Theory as he explains what is happening to America.\"[116][117] Gaetz was an early supporter of Trump and his appeal to the Republican Party base, echoing his talking points. In several commercials during his 2016 congressional campaign, Gaetz promised to \"kill Muslim terrorists and build the wall\".[118] In a September 2022 episode of Steve Bannon's War Room podcast, Gaetz said that Republicans should prioritize \"impeachment inquiries\" against Democrats \"to investigate them and to hold them accountable\" if Republicans won the 2022 U.S. House of Representatives elections. He added, \"it should be investigations [of Democrats] first—[and] policy, bill-making, to support the lobbyists and the PACs, as a far, far diminished priority.\"[119] Gaetz has introduced legislation to reclassify cannabis from Schedule I to Schedule III under the Controlled Substances Act.[120][121] He has also introduced legislation to loosen federal restrictions on the cultivation of cannabis for research purposes.[122][123] Gaetz has criticized the federal government for having \"lied to the American people for a generation\" about the medical benefits of cannabis.[124] As a member of the Florida House, he sponsored a bill, eventually signed into law,[125] to expand the state's Right to Try Act to include the medical use of cannabis.[126][127] In September 2017, Gaetz keynoted the American Medical Marijuana Physicians Association's annual conference.[128] In November 2019, Gaetz was one of only two Republicans on the House Judiciary Committee to vote for the Marijuana Opportunity Reinvestment and Expungement (MORE) Act, which among other reforms sought to remove cannabis from the Controlled Substances Act.[129] He was also the only Republican cosponsor of the bill (of 55 cosponsors) at the time of its passage.[130] Gaetz introduced the STATES Act to prevent federal interference in states that have legalized cannabis for medical or recreational purposes.[131] Gaetz said he had multiple conversations with President Trump about cannabis policy.[132] Nonetheless, Gaetz did not find positions on marijuana to be a dealbreaker in the 2024 Republican Speaker nominee selection, repeatedly supporting anti-cannabis candidates.[133][134][135] Worried about protesters disrupting his appearance at his town hall in Pace, Florida, Gaetz prepared what his staffers called a nonverbal town hall on February 23, 2017. He printed out part of his speech onto giant boards that he would hold up if he was unable to speak.[136] Gaetz arrived 30 minutes late to the meeting, where at least 500 constituents crowded into a bowling alley. At the meeting, he was questioned about his relationship with Trump, his stance on repealing the Affordable Care Act, and his proposal to abolish the Environmental Protection Agency. He said that Trump should release his tax returns, but stopped short of saying Congress should subpoena them. Gaetz closed his town hall by shouting Trump's 2016 campaign slogan, \"Make America Great Again\".[137][138][139] Gaetz is seen as a vocal ally of Trump.[140] Politico called Gaetz \"one of the most enthusiastic defenders of president Trump on cable news\" and a \"proud Trump protégé\" in April 2018.[141] Aaron Blake of The Washington Post called him one of Congress' \"most controversial members\", and one who has \"unabashedly aligned himself with Trump on basically all things\".[74][142] In May 2018, Gaetz was one of 18 House Republicans to vote to nominate Trump for the Nobel Peace Prize for his role in peace talks with North Korea.[143][144] Appearing on The View in February 2020, shortly before Trump associate Roger Stone was sentenced, Gaetz said he would support a pardon for Stone.[145] Gaetz is a member of the House Judiciary Committee, but not of the Intelligence, Foreign Affairs, or Oversight and Reform Committees, and so was not allowed to join lawmakers' closed-door deposition of former White House Russia aide Fiona Hill in October 2019. He told reporters that, since his committee oversees impeachment, he should have been allowed to be part of depositions related to the Trump impeachment inquiry.[146] On April 6, The New York Times reported that during the final weeks of Trump's first presidency, Gaetz privately asked the White House for a blanket pardon for himself and some unknown congressional allies for any crimes they may have committed.[147] The White House reportedly never seriously considered the request, because it was decided that issuing preemptive pardons would set a bad precedent.[148][149][147] The Times also reported that aides had told Trump of the request. On April 7, Trump denied that Gaetz had asked him for a pardon and noted that Gaetz \"totally denied the accusations against him\".[150] The same day, CNN's Maggie Haberman revealed that Trump had reportedly wanted to defend Gaetz, but that his advisors talked him out of it due to the seriousness of the allegations.[151][152] In November 2017, Gaetz introduced a congressional resolution calling for Robert Mueller to recuse himself as special counsel because of what were said to be conflicts of interest.[153] He also asked for a special counsel investigation into the Federal Bureau of Investigation's handling of the Hillary Clinton email controversy, undue interference by U.S. attorney general Loretta Lynch in the investigation, and the Russian state corporation Rosatom's acquisition of Uranium One during Mueller's time as FBI director.[154][155] Gaetz said he did not trust Mueller to lead the investigation because of Mueller's alleged involvement in approval of the Uranium One deal and alleged close relationship with dismissed FBI director James Comey, a probable person of interest in a proposed new investigation.[156][157] After Ohio congressman Jim Jordan denied that he was aware of the sexual abuse of Ohio State University wrestlers during the period when Jordan was a coach there,[158] Gaetz said that the allegations came from people in the \"deep state\" and were intended to reduce the credibility of Jordan's criticism of Mueller's investigation of the Trump campaign and Russia.[159][160] Gaetz said of then–U.S. attorney general Jeff Sessions that \"over at the Department of Justice, he's got Stockholm syndrome, he's become sympathetic with his captors over there in the Deep State.\"[161] During Mueller's testimony to two congressional committees on July 24, 2019, Gaetz told him, \"If Russians were lying to Christopher Steele to undermine our confidence in our newly elected president, that would be precisely in your purview because you stated in your opening that the organizing principle was to fully and thoroughly investigate Russian interference. But you weren't interested in whether the Russians interfered through Steele—and if Steele was lying, then you should have charged him with lying like you charged a variety of other people.\"[162] In October 2019, Gaetz organized a \"storming\" of a Sensitive Compartmented Information Facility on Capitol Hill by about two dozen Republican congressmen, including House minority whip Steve Scalise, in an effort to sit in on and hear the deposition of a Pentagon official during the impeachment inquiry into Trump. The congressmens' cell phones and other devices put the secure facility, and U.S. national security, at risk.[163][164][165] One committee member said, \"It was the closest thing I've seen around here to mass civil unrest as a member of Congress.\"[166][167] House Homeland Security Committee chairman Bennie Thompson of Mississippi wrote to the House sergeant-at-arms about Gaetz and others, requesting that he take action regarding their \"unprecedented breach of security\". South Carolina's senior U.S. senator, Lindsey Graham, admonished the House members, calling them \"nuts\" for having made a \"run on the SCIF\".[168][165] Ohio representative Jim Jordan said, \"The members have just had it, and they want to be able to see and represent their constituents and find out what's going on.\"[165] A day later, Jordan appeared on Fox News to justify the intrusion, saying of the chair of the committee: \"Adam Schiff is doing this unfair, partisan process in secret and our members finally said, 'Enough'. We're so frustrated. They reached a boiling point and these guys marched in and said we want to know what's going on.\"[168] In the 116th Congress, Pelosi, who is a committee member ex officio, appointed Schiff and 12 Democratic members of the House Intelligence Committee.[169] House minority leader Kevin McCarthy, also an ex officio member, appointed the ranking member, Devin Nunes, and eight other Republicans to the committee.[170] Each side got equal time to question witnesses.[166] The disruption delayed Deputy Assistant Defense Secretary Laura Cooper's testimony by many hours.[164][165] On January 7, 2021, after Trump supporters violently broke into the U.S. Capitol, Gaetz falsely blamed antifa for the attack, suggesting that rioters were \"masquerading as Trump supporters\".[171][172] Joel Valdez, a senior communications aide to Gaetz, posted a video on Parler hours before the storming of the Capitol with the caption \"From the top of the Capitol office buildings, WE HEAR YOU LOUD AND CLEAR! #StopTheSteal\".[173] Gaetz voted against the second impeachment of Donald Trump. Gaetz co-sponsored a resolution by Andy Biggs to impeach Secretary of Homeland Security Alejandro Mayorkas in August 2021.[174] Later that month, Gaetz co-sponsored a resolution by Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene to impeach president Biden.[175] In September 2022, he called impeaching Biden a \"priority\".[176] He expressed the belief that many Republicans in Congress were hesitant to impeach Biden, but that Republican voters would feel \"betrayed\" if they did not.[177] Very early into the 118th Congress, Gaetz cosponsored another resolution to impeach Mayorkas.[178] In May 2023, Gaetz co-sponsored resolutions by Marjorie Taylor Greene to impeach Biden and Mayorkas.[179][180] During an invitation-only video conference moderated by Steve Bannon days after a Biden impeachment inquiry was opened in September 2023, Gaetz denounced the impeachment effort as a political stunt. Gaetz said, \"I don't believe that we are endeavoring upon a legitimate impeachment of Joe Biden ... I think it's for the sake of having another bad thing to say about Joe Biden.\"[181] Gaetz voted for the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017.[182] He acknowledged that the bill's pass-through tax deduction would benefit Trump, but added, \"so many Americans benefit when commercial real estate becomes easier and more accessible.\"[183] Gaetz was among the 71 Republicans who voted against final passage of the Fiscal Responsibility Act of 2023 in the House.[184] Gaetz acknowledged global warming in 2016 but said he disagrees with the scientific consensus on climate change that human activity is the primary cause.[185] In April 2017, the Center for American Progress and Vice Media said Gaetz was a climate change denier, citing his 2016 statements.[186][non-primary source needed][187] Gaetz proposed legislation to abolish the Environmental Protection Agency in January 2017, claiming that it hurts small businesses via the costs associated with compliance.[27][188] Gaetz joined the bipartisan Climate Solutions Caucus in November 2017.[189][190] He said he advocated technological innovation and economic incentives that address climate change, and increased federal funds for global warming research by NASA, NOAA and universities, but remained opposed to increased environmental regulation.[191] Gaetz and Democratic Representative Scott Peters introduced the bipartisan Super Pollutants Act, which aimed to slow climate change by regulating greenhouses gases, especially black carbon, hydrofluorocarbons, and methane, in 2019.[192] A press release stated, \"These short-lived climate pollutants, also called super pollutants, are significantly more potent than carbon dioxide.\"[193] In 2021, Gaetz was one of 14 House Republicans to vote against a measure condemning the Myanmar coup d'état that overwhelmingly passed, for reasons reported to be unclear.[194] On October 12, 2017, Gaetz introduced a resolution affirming the connection between the Jewish people and Jerusalem and condemning UNESCO's efforts to the contrary.[195] In December 2017, he supported Trump's decision to recognize Jerusalem as Israel's capital and said that the move would pressure Palestine to recognize Israel.[196] In 2019, Gaetz was one of 60 representatives to vote against condemning Trump's withdrawal from Syria.[197] In April 2019, after the House passed a resolution withdrawing American support for the Saudi Arabian-led intervention in Yemen, Gaetz was one of nine lawmakers to sign a letter to Trump requesting a meeting with him and urging him to sign Senate Joint Resolution 7, which invokes the War Powers Act of 1973, to end unauthorized US military participation in the Saudi-led coalition's armed conflict against Houthi forces in Yemen.[198] In June 2021, Gaetz was one of 49 House Republicans to vote to repeal the Authorization for Use of Military Force Against Iraq Resolution of 2002.[199][200] In 2023, Gaetz was among 47 Republicans to vote in favor of H.Con.Res. 21, which directed president Joe Biden to remove U.S. troops from Syria within 180 days.[201][202] He voted to provide Israel with support following 2023 Hamas attack on Israel.[203][204] In March 2024, Niger announced it was ending its security relationship with the United States, which had been in place since 2012.[205] In a report issued by Gaetz the following month, Gaetz stated that the United States embassy in Niger was suppressing information related to the decay of Niger-United States diplomatic relations.[205] According to Gaetz's report, Niger has not authorized flights for United States Department of Defense efforts, including the sending of food, equipment, mail, or medical supplies.[205] In April 2024, Gaetz voted against the $60 billion military aid package for Ukraine, although much of the money would have gone to his constituency.[206] On June 1, 2020, during the nationwide George Floyd protests, Gaetz tweeted, \"Now that we clearly see antifa as terrorists, can we hunt them down like we do those in the Middle East?\" In response, Twitter hid the tweet and labeled it as \"[violating] the Twitter Rules about glorifying violence\". Gaetz called the label a \"badge of honor\", accused Twitter of enabling antifa, and again said that \"[o]ur government should hunt [Antifa] down\".[207] On August 26, 2020, Gaetz tweeted \"The mob wants to destroy America. We need PATRIOTS who will defend her\"[208] in support of Kyle Rittenhouse, a 17-year-old from Antioch, Illinois, who traveled to Kenosha, Wisconsin, and shot and killed two people in self-defense during the protests of the Jacob Blake shooting.[209][210][211] Gaetz was one of three representatives to offer Rittenhouse a Congressional internship.[212] Former National Rifle Association president Marion Hammer called Gaetz \"one of the most pro-gun members to have ever served in the Florida Legislature\".[213] Gaetz is a lifetime member of the NRA,[213] and has an A+ rating from it.[214] When Gaetz served in the Florida House of Representatives, he led an unsuccessful effort to allow Floridians with concealed-weapons permits to carry those weapons openly in public.[215] In lobbying for the bill, he said that the open carry of weapons was a right \"granted not by government but by God\".[216] Gaetz supports Florida's stand-your-ground law and supported legislation that strengthened it against legal challenges.[217] He also supports concealed carry reciprocity.[217] During a May 2021 \"America First\" rally with Marjorie Taylor Greene, Gaetz told an audience: \"We have a Second Amendment in this country, and I think we have an obligation to use it!\" He then said this meant allowing Americans \"the ability to maintain an armed rebellion against the government if that becomes necessary\".[218][219] Immediately before his remarks on the Second Amendment, Gaetz criticized Big Tech companies for trying to \"suppress us, discourage us\", saying, \"Silicon Valley can't cancel this movement, or this rally, or this congressman\". As a result, politicians including Ted Lieu accused Gaetz of inciting violence against Silicon Valley employees, which Gaetz denied.[220][221] In October 2017, Gaetz argued that the Medicaid expansion permitted by the Affordable Care Act fueled the opioid crisis.[222] PolitiFact rated the claim \"mostly false\", noting that \"experts were universal in saying that the evidence that Medicaid expansion is somehow fueling the opioid crisis doesn't exist.\"[222] In June 2021, Gaetz introduced the Digital Health Pass Prevention Act (DHPPA), a bill aimed at preventing the federal government from funding and enforcing any digital passes associated with COVID-19 vaccination status, with the support of representatives Louie Gohmert and Lance Gooden.[223] The full title of the bill is \"To prohibit Federal funds from being used to implement, administer, enforce, or carry out programs with respect to digital health passes, and for other purposes.\"[224] It was sent to the House Committee on Energy and Commerce which referred it to the Subcommittee on Health. No further action was reported.[225] In early March 2020, Gaetz wore a gas mask during a House debate on funds to combat the COVID-19 pandemic.[226] He argued that wearing the gas mask was not an act of mockery but a way of \"demonstrating his concern\".[227] Several journalists characterized the decision as a stunt.[228][229][230] A few days later, on March 9, Gaetz's office reported that he had been in contact with a Conservative Political Action Conference attendee who tested positive for COVID-19. As a result, Gaetz was placed under self-quarantine for 14 days. On March 10, he said his test was negative, but that he would stay under self-quarantine until the 14-day period ended on March 12.[231] On April 14, Gaetz said the Wuhan Institute of Virology \"birthed a monster\", a reference to the hypothesis that COVID-19 was leaked out of a Chinese research lab.[232] He also stated that the National Institutes of Health had given the Institute a $3.7 million grant. The U.S.-based EcoHealth Alliance that worked with the Institute under a grant the Trump administration approved, eventually had that funding withdrawn.[232] The EcoHealth Alliance later said that, under the grant, it had enhanced a bat coronavirus so it became potentially more infectious to humans, which the NIH said was an \"unexpected result\" of the research it had funded that was carried out in partnership with the Wuhan Institute. Nevertheless, the NIH denied it had helped create the virus that sparked the COVID-19 pandemic.[233][234] After Politico reported on November 7 that Gaetz had tested positive for COVID-19, he texted Politico \"I have tested positive for antibodies\" and \"I have no live virus\". He said he had no symptoms and was not sure when he had contracted the disease.[235] On December 4, 2020, Gaetz attended an indoor New York Young Republicans Club conference in Jersey City, New Jersey, during a period of surging COVID-19 cases throughout the state and the country. He was seen posing for photos in a crowd of unmasked attendees, prompting New Jersey governor Phil Murphy and Jersey City mayor Steven Fulop to publicly condemn him. Gaetz and other GOP members mocked Democrats and their COVID-19 regulations on social media. Murphy also said state officials were investigating whether the event violated the state's COVID-19 regulations.[236] After a contentious House committee hearing on June 10, 2021, Gaetz said a Chinese whistle-blower possessed text messages and documents concerning COVID-19's origins that US government investigators had failed to pursue.[237] On July 31, Gaetz said of COVID-19 variants that \"next it'll be the Chi Omega variant or the Pi Kappa Psi variant. I got the Florida variant. I got the freedom variant. It affects the brain. It gets you to think for yourself where you don't just surrender to the truth that they're trying to create in corrupt big media.\"[238] Gaetz opposes abortion. On July 23, 2022, he gave a speech at a Student Action Summit gathering in Tampa, Florida, in which he said that overweight or unattractive women were unlikely to become pregnant and mocked them for supporting abortion rights, saying, \"They're like 5'2\", 350 pounds, and they're like, 'Give me my abortions or I'll get up and march and protest.'\"[239][240] Olivia Julianna, a Texas teenager, tweeted a post mocking Gaetz, who responded with a photo of her that, according to NPR, implied his comments had touched a nerve; she used the incident to raise over $2 million for abortion funds.[239][241] On December 19, 2017, Gaetz was the only representative to vote against the Combating Human Trafficking in Commercial Vehicles Act, a bill allocating additional government resources to help combat human trafficking.[242][243][244] Gaetz later explained that his vote was due to his small government principles and his belief that existing federal agencies could adequately combat human trafficking.[244][245] On February 27, 2018, Gaetz voted against the Allow States and Victims to Fight Online Sex Trafficking Act, which had by then been combined with the Stop Enabling Sex Traffickers Act. It passed, 388–25.[246] On July 26, 2022, Gaetz voted against the Frederick Douglass Trafficking Victims Prevention and Protection Reauthorization Act, which passed 401–20.[247] Gaetz opposes sanctuary cities, which limit their cooperation with the federal government in enforcing immigration law.[248] Upon announcing his run for Congress in 2016, he said that undocumented immigrants were \"sucking us dry\".[249] In January 2018, Gaetz defended a statement by Trump that reportedly said Haiti and African nations were \"shithole\" countries, saying that Haiti was covered by \"sheet metal and garbage\" and in \"disgusting\" condition.[250] In October 2018, Gaetz falsely stated that George Soros paid for a caravan of migrants from Central America to the United States.[251] Gaetz voted against the Further Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2020 which authorizes DHS to nearly double the available H-2B visas for the remainder of FY 2020.[252][253] Gaetz voted against Consolidated Appropriations Act (H.R. 1158), an act which effectively prohibits ICE from cooperating with Health and Human Services to detain or remove illegal alien sponsors of unaccompanied alien children (UACs).[254][255] Gaetz tweeted on June 23, 2021 that the FBI should be defunded. At that time, it was investigating him for alleged sex trafficking and having sex with a minor. He wrote, \"If Democrats want to defund the police, they should start with the FBI.\"[256] Gaetz later deleted the tweet.[257][258] The week before, he claimed without evidence that \"FBI operatives organized and participated in the January 6th Capitol riot.\"[256] As of 2024[update], there is still no evidence for such a claim.[259] As a Florida state representative in 2015, Gaetz and Representative David Richardson sponsored an amendment to repeal the state ban on same-sex adoptions.[260] He also persuaded his father, in the Florida State Senate, to support the repeal.[261] In 2015, after the U.S. Supreme Court decided Obergefell v. Hodges, which established the legal recognition of same-sex marriage in the United States, Gaetz said he disagreed with the court's ruling, saying that each state should have the right to decide for itself whether to allow same-sex marriage. He argued that the decision was an example of \"judicial activism\" that posed \"a threat to our democracy\".[262] During the 116th Congress, Gaetz voted against the Equality Act,[263] which would ban discrimination on the basis of sex, sexual orientation, and gender identity in federal law. In 2022, Gaetz voted against the Respect for Marriage Act,[264] which repealed the Defense of Marriage Act, which restricted legal recognition of marriage to opposite-sex marriage in federal law. In 2024, Gaetz condemned schools for promoting what he described as \"degenerate LGBT and anti-White propaganda\" as he introduced his \"National Prayer In School Act\".[265][266][267] Gaetz was one of 39 Republicans to vote for the Merger Filing Fee Modernization Act of 2022, an antitrust package that would crack down on corporations for anti-competitive behavior.[268][269] Gaetz's tenure as congressman was widely criticized and controversial, with The New York Times noting accusations of:[107] sexual misconduct and illicit drug use; sharing inappropriate images or videos on the House floor; misusing state identification records; converting campaign funds to personal use; and accepting impermissible gifts under House rules.[107] Gaetz routinely conflicted with members of Republican leadership. In October 2023, Gaetz filed a motion to vacate which led to the removal of Kevin McCarthy as speaker of the U.S. House of Representatives.[68] Former White House aide Cassidy Hutchinson wrote in her memoir that, during a trip to Camp David in 2020, Gaetz made \"repeated passes\" at her and asked her to \"escort\" him to his room. Gaetz has denied these actions.[270] In January 2020, the U.S. Secret Service reportedly received a tip that, in April 2018, Gaetz had accompanied Seminole County tax collector Joel Greenberg to a government office where Greenberg was producing fake IDs.[271] Greenberg was indicted in August 2020 on an array of charges, including sex trafficking a 17-year-old girl in 2017 and creating fake IDs to facilitate sex trafficking.[272][273] The investigation of Greenberg led federal officials to look into some of Gaetz's related activities.[271] In late 2020, the Justice Department opened its investigation of Gaetz for allegedly sex trafficking the same 17-year-old girl in 2017 and whether he had violated federal sex trafficking laws by paying her to travel with him across state lines.[272][274][275] As part of his plea bargain, Greenberg cooperated with the investigation of Gaetz and others.[276][277] Axios reported that Gaetz was \"seriously considering not seeking re-election and possibly leaving Congress early for a job at Newsmax\" on March 30, 2021.[278] The same day, The New York Times reported the Justice Department's investigation of Gaetz.[272] According to CNN, a person briefed on the matter said investigators also examined whether Gaetz used campaign money in his relationships with young women for travel and expenses and whether cash and drugs were involved.[279] By April 2, the Justice Department was examining whether Gaetz asked women to recruit others for sex.[280][281] According to the 2021 reports, federal investigators were looking into Gaetz's September 2018 trip to the Bahamas.[273] Gaetz was reportedly joined by marijuana entrepreneur and hand surgeon Jason Pirozzolo, who allegedly paid trip accommodations, traveling expenses, and escort services. Investigators were reportedly exploring whether the escorts were sexually trafficked for Gaetz and whether Gaetz accepted paid escorts in exchange for political access or legislative favors for Pirozzolo, who at the time chaired the board of the Medical Marijuana Physicians Association. Gaetz made two speeches for the organization while in Congress, and Pirozzolo gave two separate donations of $1,000 to Gaetz's campaign arm, \"Friends of Matt Gaetz\", in March 2016 and May 2017.[282] A spokeswoman for Gaetz denied the new allegations.[283] A woman on the Bahamas trip—a Capitol Hill intern who did not work in Gaetz's office but who was dating him—reportedly agreed in May 2021 to cooperate with investigators, who believe she has information about Gaetz's financial transactions on the trip.[284][285] Investigators believe that Greenberg met women through a website for sex and introduced them to Gaetz, who also had sex with them.[272] Evidence including mobile payment receipts reportedly suggesting Gaetz had illegally exchanged money for sex, such as May 2018 Venmo transaction records showing Gaetz sending $900 (with a memo referring to a woman) to Greenberg, who then relayed the money (with the memos \"tuition\" and \"school\") to three women, one of whom was 18.[286] Joseph Ellicott, an associate of both Gaetz and Greenberg, pleaded guilty in January 2022 to two charges related to this investigation and is also cooperating with authorities.[287] Gaetz had argued in a November 2020 Fox News appearance that Trump \"should pardon Michael Flynn [and] everyone from himself to his administration officials to Joe Exotic\".[288][289] In late 2020, Greenberg apparently attempted to secure a pardon from the Trump administration via a confession letter (first reported by The Daily Beast in April 2021), writing that he and Gaetz had had sex with a 17-year-old girl they believed was 19, which Greenberg learned of on September 4, 2017, and that payments had been made on behalf of Gaetz to her and other women in exchange for sex.[290] Greenberg attempted to bribe Roger Stone with a $250,000 Bitcoin payment to secure a presidential pardon, texting Stone, \"They know [Gaetz] paid me to pay the girls and that he and I both had sex with the girl who was underage.\"[290] By the end of the Trump administration, Greenberg was under indictment, investigators had been questioning some Gaetz associates, and federal agents had seized the phone of one of Gaetz's former girlfriends.[291] Gaetz's phone was also seized, and he changed his phone number in late December.[273] Denying any sexual relationships with minors, Gaetz said on March 30, 2021, that he did not plan to resign from the House.[272] That same day, he tweeted that he and his family were \"victims of an organized criminal extortion involving a former DOJ official seeking $25 million\".[272][292] This allegedly began on March 16, with a text message to his father demanding money in exchange for making sex trafficking allegations \"go away\".[293] Gaetz and his father purportedly received communications saying that the FBI had photographs of Gaetz engaged in a \"sexual orgy with underage prostitutes\". The sender demanded millions of dollars to help secure the release of U.S. federal agent Robert Levinson (who had disappeared in Iran in 2007 and had already been presumed and declared dead),[294][295] proposing that president Joe Biden would pardon Gaetz as a reward for freeing Levinson.[296][297] The sender was later identified as Florida developer Stephen Alford, who was arrested on August 31.[298][299] Gaetz said his attorneys contacted the FBI, whom he said had informed them that Gaetz was a subject, not a target, of an investigation. He also said his father agreed to wear a \"wire\" to help the FBI record the alleged extortionists.[300] Gaetz sent Axios screenshots of text messages, emails and documents outlining the alleged extortion scheme, which he asserted was being run by David McGee,[301] a former federal prosecutor who has been a private attorney since 2005[302] and has represented the Levinson family.[303] McGee's law firm called Gaetz's allegation \"completely, totally false\" and defamatory,[293] telling The Daily Beast that Gaetz was attempting to distract from the sex trafficking investigation.[304] Alford, who has previously been federally convicted of fraud and is represented by McGee, was federally indicted in August 2021 for allegedly conducting the scheme. Prosecutors alleged that Alford said he had contacts in the Justice Department who could arrange for a presidential pardon for Gaetz and directed Don Gaetz to wire the money to a trust account managed by McGee. McGee reportedly met with Don Gaetz before Alford did,[303][305] but apparently did not discuss a presidential pardon, which Alford later admitted to the FBI that he had lied about his ability to arrange.[295] Also on March 30, Tucker Carlson interviewed Gaetz on Fox News. In addition to denying the allegations about his relationship with a 17-year-old girl, Gaetz denied a previously unreported claim that he had been photographed \"with child prostitutes\", and said that the FBI had urged a friend of his (whom Carlson had supposedly met) to claim Gaetz was \"involved in some pay-for-play scheme\". He also argued that \"Providing for flights and hotel rooms for people that you're dating who are of legal age is not a crime.\"[306][307][308] House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy said he had no plans to remove Gaetz from his seats on the Judiciary and Armed Services Committees on March 31, 2021, but that he might change his mind if Gaetz \"gets indicted\"[309] or \"if it comes out to be true\".[310] CNN reported on April 1 that Gaetz had shown pictures of naked women to colleagues on the House floor. Gaetz had allegedly claimed to have slept with the women in the photos.[311] The next day, his communications director, Luke Ball, and his legislative director, Devin Murphy, resigned. Both had begun working for Gaetz when he joined Congress in 2017.[312][313][314] On April 6, The New York Times reported that in the last weeks of the Trump administration, Gaetz privately requested a blanket presidential pardon for himself and others, which was reportedly denied because it would set a bad precedent.[289] The next day, Trump publicly denied that Gaetz had asked him for a pardon.[315] On April 7, journalist Maggie Haberman revealed on CNN that Trump had reportedly wanted to defend Gaetz but was told to stand down due to the seriousness of the allegations.[151][152] Gaetz's congressional office released a statement purportedly from his female employees vouching for his character, stating they \"uniformly reject these allegations as false\" on April 8. Gaetz's new communications director, Joel Valdez, told Forbes that \"all of the office's eight female staffers signed it\", but the version of the statement that was released did not have anyone's signature or identify any specific employee.[316] That evening, Representative Adam Kinzinger tweeted that Gaetz should resign, becoming the first congressional Republican to make such a call.[317][318] The House Ethics Committee opened an investigation on April 9 into allegations that Gaetz \"may have engaged in sexual misconduct and/or illicit drug use, shared inappropriate images or videos on the House floor, misused state identification records, converted campaign funds to personal use, and/or accepted a bribe, improper gratuity, or impermissible gift\".[319] The committee deferred its investigation at the request of the Justice Department, but resumed it in June 2023.[320][321] In late April, Gaetz fundraised to run his own political ads, claiming that he was under attack by powerful interests such as \"big government, big tech, big business, big media\" that perceived him as a political threat.[322] A public relations firm hired by Gaetz issued a denial statement regarding The Daily Beast's reporting on Greenberg's correspondence implicating him and Gaetz.[290] Greenberg pleaded guilty to multiple crimes on May 17 in a plea bargain in which he would have to cooperate with prosecutors.[277] By June, the federal investigation had reportedly broadened to include obstruction of justice, relating to Gaetz's phone conversation with a witness.[323][324] Later in June, ABC News reported that the investigation had engulfed many in the Central Florida political scene and that prosecutors could decide whether to bring charges against Gaetz as early as July.[325] In August, ABC News reported that Greenberg had \"provided investigators with years of Venmo and Cash App transactions and thousands of photos and videos, as well as access to personal social media accounts\". These include September 2018 text messages between Greenberg and a woman engaging in prostitution, which indicate that a prostitute was arranged for Gaetz and that MDMA may have been proffered. A spokesperson for Gaetz said, \"not one woman has come forward to accuse Rep. Gaetz of wrongdoing\" and that Gaetz had \"addressed the debunked allegations against him\" on his new podcast, Firebrand.[326][327] According to Greenberg, he made the arrangements for Gaetz.[326] Two top Washington prosecutors—a public corruption investigator with expertise in child exploitation crimes and a leader of the public corruption unit—have worked on Gaetz's case since at least mid-2021.[328] Greenberg's sentencing hearing was originally scheduled for August 2021,[329] but due to his cooperation in related investigations, had been repeatedly delayed.[330][331] In January 2022, an ex-girlfriend of Gaetz's testified before a grand jury after being granted immunity;[332] she reportedly had information relevant to two of three criminal charges being considered for Gaetz: sex trafficking a minor and obstruction of justice.[332] (A year later, her attorney said that Justice Department prosecutors made the right decision not to charge Gaetz because \"they didn't have evidence to prove a crime\".)[333] Gaetz was also accused of violating the Mann Act, which prohibits sex trafficking across state lines.[334] Later in January 2022, Joseph Ellicott confessed that on September 4, 2017, he witnessed Greenberg telling Gaetz over the phone that the woman they had both had sex with was underage.[335][336][337] Thanks to his assistance with the prosecutors in a series of investigations, including those involving Gaetz, Greenberg was sentenced to 11 years in prison, plus 10 years of supervised release, on December 1, 2022.[338] The sentencing judge, Gregory A. Presnell, said, \"He has provided substantial cooperation to the government...more than I've seen in 22 years.\"[338] Court documents filed in September 2024 stated that, according to multiple eyewitnesses, Gaetz had attended a party in 2017 alongside a 17-year-old girl, at the home of lobbyist Chris Dorworth where people engaged in sexual activities and did drugs, including cocaine, ecstasy, and cannabis.[339][340] A September 2022 Washington Post article reported that prosecutors had recommended not to charge Gaetz in the sex trafficking investigation, telling Justice Department superiors that a conviction is unlikely in part because of credibility questions about the two central witnesses.[341] In February 2023, the DOJ communicated to the attorneys for Gaetz that they had concluded their investigation and would not be laying charges against him, effectively ending a multiyear probe including allegations of misconduct.[342] The House Ethics Committee began its probe in April 2021 into Gaetz's alleged misconduct but soon paused it while the DOJ investigated. Shortly after the February 2023 conclusion of the DOJ investigation, the House Ethics Committee reopened its probe.[343][344] Two women, both represented by attorney Joel Leppard, testified that Gaetz paid them for sex. One of those women said that in July 2017, she saw Gaetz having sex with her 17-year-old friend and that once Gaetz became aware of the girl's age, he paused the relationship until she turned 18.[345] The woman who was 17 at the time of the incident told the House Ethics Committee that she had two sexual encounters with Gaetz at the same party.[346] The DOJ had charted payments showing that, between July 2017 and January 2019, Gaetz paid both women a total of over $10,000 across 27 Venmo transactions and a check. The committee received this chart from the DOJ, but the DOJ did not turn over other information the committee requested.[347][348] The committee also contacted Gaetz's ex-girlfriend who in 2022 had received immunity and testified in the criminal investigation, though reportedly it did not expect her to cooperate in the ethics investigation voluntarily.[349] In mid-November 2024, days before the committee was scheduled to vote whether to release its report, which was nearly complete and which insiders said was \"highly critical\" of Gaetz,[350][351][352] Gaetz resigned from the House, in part due to an announcement of his nomination as United States Attorney General for Donald Trump's second term.[353] This caused the committee to lose jurisdiction to continue its probe[354] and, under the House's own rules, it cannot release the report either. (Despite this internal rule, the House has released reports on former members before.)[355] House Speaker Mike Johnson said he would \"strongly request that the Ethics Committee not issue the report\".[356] Given the Senate's role in approving Gaetz's nomination for Attorney General, several senators including Joni Ernst, John Curtis, John Cornyn, and Markwayne Mullin called on the House to allow them to review the Ethics Committee report.[357][358] Attorneys for the two women called for the report to be released publicly: John Clune (representing the woman who had been 17 at the time of the incident) and Joel Leppard (representing the witness).[355][359] The sworn testimony of the woman who said she had sex with Gaetz in 2017 when she was 17, along with corroborating eyewitness testimony to that sexual encounter, was obtained by a hacker on November 18. A lawyer on the case noticed the suspicious download. The hacker did not immediately leak the material.[360] The House Ethics Committee decided that by December 5, it would finish its report and vote on whether to release it.[361][362] Gaetz withdrew his nomination for attorney general on November 21,[363] and indicated the following day that he would not return to the House.[364] In December 2024, the House Ethics Committee voted to release its report.[365] It was made public on December 23. The Ethics Committee report concluded that Gaetz had violated Florida state laws, including those prohibiting statutory rape, procurement of prostitution, and illicit drug use, but that Gaetz did not engage in sex trafficking across state lines. The committee identified at least 20 occasions on which he had paid women for sex or drugs. It found a total of over $90,000 in payments to the 17-year-old girl and 11 other women.[366][367][368][369] Gaetz was arrested for driving under the influence as he was driving back from a nightclub on Okaloosa Island, Florida, in 2008. Police recorded him driving 48 mph (77 km/h) in a 35 mph (56 km/h) zone and noted that he showed physical signs of intoxication.[370] Gaetz initially denied that he had drunk alcohol, but later admitted to drinking two beers. He failed an eye test twice, then declined field sobriety tests. After Gaetz was arrested, he refused to take a breathalyzer test.[370] Shortly after Gaetz's case was referred to state attorney Steve Meadows, Gaetz's driving license was reinstated. Though Florida law requires a year's suspension when a driver refuses a breathalyzer test, Gaetz's suspension was less than a year. His refusal also did not lead to a criminal prosecution, during which it could have been used against him. A field officer for the Florida Department of Highway Safety and Motor Vehicles declared there was no evidence that Gaetz refused a breathalyzer test, despite the arresting police officer having documented it in an affidavit and the arrest report and Gaetz's own attorney also having documented it, too. Gaetz's attorney also argued that an unnamed witness who knew Gaetz \"observed no indication of impairment\".[370] The charges against Gaetz were dismissed.[370] Gaetz has published a 2020 book and a 2021 podcast, both titled Firebrand. In both, he criticizes former House speaker Paul Ryan for joining the board of Fox News's parent company and blames him for canceling Lou Dobbs Tonight.[327][371] In the book, while discussing dating in Washington, he writes, \"I knew going in how many people had been brought down by sexual missteps in this town, so I set some rules to help me err on the safe(r) side ... [including] no dating your staff members, [etc.].\"[371] In December 2020, Gaetz announced his engagement to his girlfriend, Ginger Luckey, the sister of Oculus VR founder and major Republican donor Palmer Luckey.[372] They married in August 2021.[373] Gaetz is a Baptist.[374] On several occasions he has mentioned that he had regarded his ex-girlfriend's younger brother, Nestor Galbán, as his family.[375] Though Gaetz has referred to Galbán as his son in the past, the two are not related genetically or legally.[376][377][378]",

In January 2018, Gaetz invited alt-right Holocaust denier Charles C. Johnson to Donald Trump's State of the Union address.[33] Gaetz has gone to political rallies in 2018 and 2019 at which members of the Proud Boys were present.[34][35] On January 10, 2021, House Republican leader Kevin McCarthy argued with Gaetz on a phone call that he was unnecessarily \"putting people in jeopardy\" during the January 6 United States Capitol attack.[36] In June 2021, Gaetz was one of 21 House Republicans to vote against a resolution to give the Congressional Gold Medal to police officers who defended the U.S. Capitol on January 6.[37] Gaetz, a critic of Kevin McCarthy, voted against him for Speaker of the U.S. House, instead nominating former President Donald Trump.[38][39][40] He made it harder for McCarthy to become speaker, however changed his vote on January 7, 2023.[41] However, in October 2023, Gaetz successfully filed a resolution to remove McCarthy from his role as speaker.[42] In April 2024, McCarthy said that Gaetz wanted to remove him as speaker to protecting himself against allegations of having had sex with a 17 year old minor.[43][44][45] Gaetz resigned from the U.S. House of Representatives on November 13, 2024 after he was nominated as United States Attorney General.[9] In November 2024, President-elect Donald Trump announced he would nominate Gaetz to serve as United States attorney general during his second administration.[8] His nomination surprised many Republicans and some did not like it.[46] After his nomination, there was controversy about Gaetz paying minors for sex along with accusations of sex trafficking.[10] Gaetz withdrew his nomination on November 21, 2024.[10] In December 2020, Gaetz announced his engagement to his girlfriend, Ginger Luckey.[47] They married in August 2021.[48] Gaetz is a Baptist.[49] In 2020, Gaetz was accused of sex trafficking and having sexual relationships with minors. After an investigation, the United States Department of Justice (DOJ) decided not to charge him, although Gaetz remained under investigation of the House Ethics Committee up until his resignation.[5] In March 2021, Gaetz was being investigated for having a sexual relationship with a 17-year-old girl in 2019, and that investigators were examining whether he had violated federal sex trafficking laws by allegedly paying her to travel with him.[50][51] A few weeks later, Axios reported that Gaetz was \"seriously considering not seeking re-election and possibly leaving Congress early for a job at Newsmax\".[52] Former White House aide Cassidy Hutchinson wrote in her memoir that Gaetz harassed her many times.[53] She wrote that during a trip to Camp David in 2020 he interrupted her meeting with Kevin McCarthy, repeatedly asking her to \"escort\" him to his room. Gaetz has said that this is not true.[54]",

                "content": "William Jefferson Clinton (né Blythe; born August 19, 1946) is an American lawyer and politician who served as the 42nd president of the United States from 1993 to 2001. A member of the Democratic Party, he previously served as the attorney general of Arkansas from 1977 to 1979 and as the governor of Arkansas from 1979 to 1981, and again from 1983 to 1992. Clinton, whose policies reflected a centrist \"Third Way\" political philosophy, became known as a New Democrat. Born and raised in Arkansas, Clinton graduated from Georgetown University in 1968, and later from Yale Law School, where he met his future wife, Hillary Rodham. After graduating from law school, Clinton returned to Arkansas and won election as state attorney general, followed by two non-consecutive tenures as Arkansas governor. As governor, he overhauled the state's education system and served as chairman of the National Governors Association. Clinton was elected president in the 1992 election, defeating the incumbent Republican Party president George H. W. Bush, and the independent businessman Ross Perot. He became the first president to be born in the Baby Boomer generation. Clinton presided over the longest period of peacetime economic expansion in American history. He signed into law the North American Free Trade Agreement and the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act but failed to pass his plan for national health care reform. Starting in the mid-1990s, he began an ideological evolution as he became much more conservative in his domestic policy, advocating for and signing the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Act, the State Children's Health Insurance Program and financial deregulation measures. He appointed Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Stephen Breyer to the U.S. Supreme Court. In foreign policy, Clinton ordered U.S. military intervention in the Bosnian and Kosovo wars, eventually signing the Dayton Peace agreement. He also called for the expansion of NATO in Eastern Europe and many former Warsaw Pact members joined NATO during his presidency. Clinton's foreign policy in the Middle East saw him sign the Iraq Liberation Act which gave aid to groups against Saddam Hussein. He also participated in the Oslo I Accord and Camp David Summit to advance the Israeli–Palestinian peace process, and assisted the Northern Ireland peace process. Clinton won re-election in the 1996 election, defeating Republican nominee Bob Dole and Reform Party nominee Perot. In his second term, Clinton made use of permanent normal trade. Most of the accomplishments of his second term were overshadowed by the Clinton–Lewinsky scandal, when it was revealed that he had been engaging in a years-long sexual relationship with White House intern Monica Lewinsky. In 1998, news of the affair made tabloid headlines.[1] This scandal escalated throughout the year, culminating in December when Clinton was impeached by the House of Representatives, becoming the first U.S. president to be impeached since Andrew Johnson. The two impeachment articles that the House passed were centered around perjury and Clinton using the powers of the presidency to commit obstruction of justice. In January 1999, Clinton's impeachment trial began in the Senate, where he was acquitted two months later on both charges. During the last three years of Clinton's presidency, the Congressional Budget Office reported a budget surplus—the first such surplus since 1969. Clinton left office in 2001 with the joint-highest approval rating of any U.S. president. His presidency ranks among the middle to upper tier in historical rankings of U.S. presidents. However, his personal conduct and misconduct allegations have made him the subject of substantial scrutiny. Since leaving office, Clinton has been involved in public speaking and humanitarian work. He created the Clinton Foundation to address international causes such as the prevention of HIV/AIDS and global warming. In 2009, he was named the United Nations special envoy to Haiti. After the 2010 Haiti earthquake, Clinton founded the Clinton Bush Haiti Fund with George W. Bush and Barack Obama. He has remained active in Democratic Party politics, campaigning for his wife's 2008 and 2016 presidential campaigns. Clinton was born William Jefferson Blythe III on August 19, 1946, at Julia Chester Hospital in Hope, Arkansas.[2] He is the son of William Jefferson Blythe Jr., a traveling salesman who died in an automobile accident three months before his birth, and Virginia Dell Cassidy (later Virginia Kelley).[3] Blythe had initially survived the crash, but drowned in a drainage ditch. His parents had married on September 4, 1943, but this union later proved to be bigamous, as Blythe was still married to his fourth wife.[4] Virginia traveled to New Orleans to study nursing soon after Bill was born, leaving him in Hope with her parents Eldridge and Edith Cassidy, who owned and ran a small grocery store.[5] At a time when the southern United States was racially segregated, Clinton's grandparents sold goods on credit to people of all races.[5][6][7][8][9] In 1950, Bill's mother returned from nursing school and married Roger Clinton Sr., who co-owned an automobile dealership in Hot Springs, Arkansas, with his brother and Earl T. Ricks.[5] The family moved to Hot Springs in 1950.[10] Although he immediately assumed use of his stepfather's surname, it was not until Clinton turned 15[11] that he formally adopted the surname Clinton as a gesture toward him.[5] Clinton has described his stepfather as a gambler and an alcoholic who regularly abused his mother and half-brother, Roger Clinton Jr. The physical abuse only ceased after a then-14-year-old Bill challenged his stepfather to \"stand and face\" him, though the verbal/emotional abuse continued.[12] Bill would eventually forgive Roger Sr. for his abusive actions near the latter's death.[13][14] In Hot Springs, Clinton attended St. John's Catholic Elementary School, Ramble Elementary School, and the segregated Hot Springs High School, where he was an active student leader, avid reader, and musician.[5] Clinton was in the chorus and played the tenor saxophone, winning first chair in the state band's saxophone section. While in high school, Clinton performed for two years in a jazz trio, The 3 Kings, with Randy Goodrum, who became a successful professional pianist.[15] In 1961, Clinton became a member of the Hot Springs Chapter of the Order of DeMolay, a youth group affiliated with Freemasonry, but he never became a Freemason.[16] He briefly considered dedicating his life to music, but as he noted in his autobiography My Life: Clinton began an interest in law at Hot Springs High, when he took up the challenge to argue the defense of the ancient Roman senator Catiline in a mock trial in his Latin class.[17] After a vigorous defense that made use of his \"budding rhetorical and political skills\", he told the Latin teacher Elizabeth Buck it \"made him realize that someday he would study law\".[18] Clinton has identified two influential moments in his life, both occurring in 1963, that contributed to his decision to become a public figure. One was his visit as a Boys Nation senator to the White House to meet President John F. Kennedy.[12] The other was watching Martin Luther King Jr.'s 1963 \"I Have a Dream\" speech on TV, which impressed him so much that he later memorized it.[19] With the aid of scholarships, Clinton attended the School of Foreign Service at Georgetown University in Washington, D.C., receiving a Bachelor of Science in foreign service degree in 1968. Georgetown was the only university where Clinton applied.[20] In 1964 and 1965, Clinton won elections for class president.[21] From 1964 to 1967, he was an intern and then a clerk in the office of Arkansas Senator J. William Fulbright.[5] While in college, he became a brother of service fraternity Alpha Phi Omega[22] and was elected to Phi Beta Kappa. He is a member of Kappa Kappa Psi honorary band fraternity.[23] Upon graduating from Georgetown in 1968, Clinton won a Rhodes Scholarship to University College, Oxford, where he initially read for a B.Phil. in philosophy, politics, and economics but transferred to a B.Litt. in politics and, ultimately, a B.Phil. in politics.[24] Clinton did not expect to return for the second year because of the draft and so he switched programs; this type of activity was common among other Rhodes Scholars from his cohort. He had received an offer to study at Yale Law School, and so he left early to return to the United States and did not receive a degree from Oxford.[12][25][26] During his time at Oxford, Clinton befriended fellow American Rhodes Scholar Frank Aller. In 1969, Aller received a draft letter that mandated deployment to the Vietnam War. Aller's 1971 suicide had an influential impact on Clinton.[24][27] British writer and feminist Sara Maitland said of Clinton, \"I remember Bill and Frank Aller taking me to a pub in Walton Street in the summer term of 1969 and talking to me about the Vietnam War. I knew nothing about it, and when Frank began to describe the napalming of civilians I began to cry. Bill said that feeling bad wasn't good enough. That was the first time I encountered the idea that liberal sensitivities weren't enough and you had to do something about such things\".[24] Clinton was a member of the Oxford University Basketball Club and also played for Oxford University's rugby union team.[28] While Clinton was president in 1994, he received an honorary Doctor of Civil Law degree and a fellowship from the University of Oxford, specifically for being \"a doughty and tireless champion of the cause of world peace\", having \"a powerful collaborator in his wife\", and for winning \"general applause for his achievement of resolving the gridlock that prevented an agreed budget\".[25][29] During the Vietnam War, Clinton received educational draft deferments while he was in England in 1968 and 1969.[30] While at Oxford, he participated in Vietnam War protests and organized a Moratorium to End the War in Vietnam event in October 1969.[5] He was planning to attend law school in the U.S. and knew he might lose his deferment. Clinton tried unsuccessfully to obtain positions in the National Guard and the Air Force officer candidate school, and he then made arrangements to join the Reserve Officers' Training Corps (ROTC) program at the University of Arkansas.[31][32] He subsequently decided not to join the ROTC, saying in a letter to the officer in charge of the program that he opposed the war, but did not think it was honorable to use ROTC, National Guard, or Reserve service to avoid serving in Vietnam. He further stated that because he opposed the war, he would not volunteer to serve in uniform, but would subject himself to the draft, and would serve if selected only as a way \"to maintain my political viability within the system\".[33] Clinton registered for the draft and received a high number (311), meaning that those whose birthdays had been drawn as numbers 1 to 310 would be drafted before him, making it unlikely he would be called up. (In fact, the highest number drafted was 195.)[34] Colonel Eugene Holmes, the Army officer who had been involved with Clinton's ROTC application, suspected that Clinton attempted to manipulate the situation to avoid the draft and avoid serving in uniform. He issued a notarized statement during the 1992 presidential campaign: During the 1992 campaign, it was revealed that Clinton's uncle had attempted to secure him a position in the Navy Reserve, which would have prevented him from being deployed to Vietnam. This effort was unsuccessful and Clinton said in 1992 that he had been unaware of it until then.[36] Although legal, Clinton's actions with respect to the draft and deciding whether to serve in the military were criticized during his first presidential campaign by conservatives and some Vietnam veterans, some of whom charged that he had used Fulbright's influence to avoid military service.[37][38] Clinton's 1992 campaign manager, James Carville, successfully argued that Clinton's letter in which he declined to join the ROTC should be made public, insisting that voters, many of whom had also opposed the Vietnam War, would understand and appreciate his position.[39] After Oxford, Clinton attended Yale Law School and earned a Juris Doctor (J.D.) degree in 1973.[12] In 1971, he met his future wife, Hillary Rodham, in the Yale Law Library; she was a class year ahead of him.[40] They began dating and were soon inseparable. After only about a month, Clinton postponed his summer plans to be a coordinator for the George McGovern campaign for the 1972 United States presidential election in order to move in with her in California.[41] The couple continued living together in New Haven when they returned to law school.[42] Clinton eventually moved to Texas with Rodham in 1972 to take a job leading McGovern's effort there. He spent considerable time in Dallas, at the campaign's local headquarters on Lemmon Avenue, where he had an office. Clinton worked with future two-term mayor of Dallas Ron Kirk,[43] future governor of Texas Ann Richards,[44] and then unknown television director and filmmaker Steven Spielberg.[45] After graduating from Yale Law School, Clinton returned to Arkansas and became a law professor at the University of Arkansas. In 1974, he ran for the House of Representatives. Running in the conservative 3rd district against incumbent Republican John Paul Hammerschmidt, Clinton's campaign was bolstered by the anti-Republican and anti-incumbent mood resulting from the Watergate scandal. Hammerschmidt, who had received 77 percent of the vote in 1972, defeated Clinton by only a 52 percent to 48 percent margin. In 1976, Clinton ran for Arkansas attorney general. Defeating the secretary of state and the deputy attorney general in the Democratic primary, Clinton was elected with no opposition at all in the general election, as no Republican had run for the office.[46][12] In 1978, Clinton entered the Arkansas gubernatorial primary. At just 31 years old, he was one of the youngest gubernatorial candidates in the state's history. Clinton was elected governor of Arkansas in 1978, having defeated the Republican candidate Lynn Lowe, a farmer from Texarkana. Clinton was only 32 years old when he took office, the youngest governor in the country at the time and the second youngest governor in the history of Arkansas.[47] Due to his youthful appearance, Clinton was often called the \"Boy Governor\".[48][49][50] He worked on educational reform and directed the maintenance of Arkansas's roads, with wife Hillary leading a successful committee on urban health care reform. However, his term included an unpopular motor vehicle tax and citizens' anger over the escape of Cuban refugees (from the Mariel boatlift) detained in Fort Chaffee in 1980. Monroe Schwarzlose, of Kingsland in Cleveland County, polled 31 percent of the vote against Clinton in the Democratic gubernatorial primary of 1980. Some suggested Schwarzlose's unexpected voter turnout foreshadowed Clinton's defeat by Republican challenger Frank D. White in the general election that year. As Clinton once joked, he was the youngest ex-governor in the nation's history.[12] After leaving office in January 1981, Clinton joined friend Bruce Lindsey's Little Rock law firm of Wright, Lindsey and Jennings.[51] In 1982, he was elected governor a second time and kept the office for ten years. Effective with the 1986 election, Arkansas had changed its gubernatorial term of office from two to four years. During his term, he helped transform Arkansas's economy and improved the state's educational system.[52] For senior citizens, he removed the sales tax from medications and increased the home property-tax exemption.[53] He became a leading figure among the New Democrats, a group of Democrats who advocated welfare reform, smaller government, and other policies not supported by liberals. Formally organized as the Democratic Leadership Council (DLC), the New Democrats argued that in light of President Ronald Reagan's landslide victory in 1984, the Democratic Party needed to adopt a more centrist political stance in order to succeed at the national level.[53][54] Clinton delivered the Democratic response to Reagan's 1985 State of the Union Address and served as chair of the National Governors Association from 1986 to 1987, bringing him to an audience beyond Arkansas.[12] In the early 1980s, Clinton made reform of the Arkansas education system a top priority of his gubernatorial administration. The Arkansas Education Standards Committee was chaired by Clinton's wife Hillary, who was also an attorney as well as the chair of the Legal Services Corporation. The committee transformed Arkansas's education system. Proposed reforms included more spending for schools (supported by a sales-tax increase), better opportunities for gifted children, vocational education, higher teachers' salaries, more course variety, and compulsory teacher competency exams. The reforms passed in September 1983 after Clinton called a special legislative session—the longest in Arkansas history.[52] Many have considered this the greatest achievement of the Clinton governorship.[12][53] He defeated four Republican candidates for governor: Lowe (1978), White (1982 and 1986), Jonesboro businessmen Woody Freeman (1984), and Sheffield Nelson of Little Rock (1990).[46] Also in the 1980s, the Clintons' personal and business affairs included transactions that became the basis of the Whitewater controversy investigation, which later dogged his presidential administration.[55] After extensive investigation over several years, no indictments were made against the Clintons related to the years in Arkansas.[12][56] According to some sources, Clinton was a death penalty opponent in his early years, but he eventually switched positions.[57][58] However he might have felt previously, by 1992, Clinton was insisting that Democrats \"should no longer feel guilty about protecting the innocent\".[59] During Clinton's final term as governor, Arkansas performed its first executions since 1964 (the death penalty had been reinstated in 1976).[60] As Governor, he oversaw the first four executions carried out by the state of Arkansas since the death penalty was reinstated there in 1976: one by electric chair and three by lethal injection.[61] To draw attention to his stance on capital punishment, Clinton flew home to Arkansas mid-campaign in 1992, in order to affirm in person that the controversial execution of Ricky Ray Rector, would go forward as scheduled.[62][63] During his time as governor in the 1980s, Arkansas was the center of a drug smuggling operation through Mena Airport. CIA agent Barry Seal allegedly imported three to five billion dollars worth of cocaine through the airport, and the operation was linked to the Iran–Contra affair.[64] Clinton was accused of knowing about this operation, although nothing could be proven against him.[65][66] Journalist Sam Smith tied him to various questionable business dealings.[67] Clinton was also accused by Gennifer Flowers to have used cocaine as governor[68] and his half-brother Roger was sentenced to prison in 1985 for possession and smuggling of cocaine, but was later pardoned by his brother after serving his sentence.[69] During his time in Arkansas, there were also other scandals such as the Whitewater controversy[70] involving the Clintons' real estate dealings, and Bill Clinton was accused of serious sexual misconduct in Arkansas, including allegations of using the Arkansas State Police to gain access to women (Troopergate affair).[71] The killing of Don Henry and Kevin Ives in 1987 started various conspiracy theories that accused Clinton and the Arkansas state authorities of covering up the crime.[72] In 1987, the media speculated that Clinton would enter the presidential race. Clinton decided to remain as Arkansas governor (following consideration for the potential candidacy of Hillary for governor, initially favored—but ultimately vetoed—by the First Lady).[73] For the nomination, Clinton endorsed Massachusetts governor Michael Dukakis. He gave the nationally televised opening night address at the 1988 Democratic National Convention, but his speech, which was 33 minutes long and twice the length it was expected to be, was criticized for being too long.[74] Clinton presented himself both as a moderate and as a member of the New Democrat wing of the Democratic Party, and he headed the moderate Democratic Leadership Council in 1990 and 1991.[53][75] In the first primary contest, the Iowa Caucus, Clinton finished a distant third to Iowa senator Tom Harkin. During the campaign for the New Hampshire primary, reports surfaced that Clinton had engaged in an extramarital affair with Gennifer Flowers. Clinton fell far behind former Massachusetts senator Paul Tsongas in the New Hampshire polls.[12] Following Super Bowl XXVI, Clinton and his wife Hillary went on 60 Minutes to rebuff the charges.[76] Their television appearance was a calculated risk, but Clinton regained several delegates. He finished second to Tsongas in the New Hampshire primary, but after trailing badly in the polls and coming within single digits of winning, the media viewed it as a victory. News outlets labeled him \"The Comeback Kid\" for earning a firm second-place finish.[77] Winning the big prizes of Florida and Texas and many of the Southern primaries on Super Tuesday gave Clinton a sizable delegate lead. However, former California governor Jerry Brown was scoring victories and Clinton had yet to win a significant contest outside his native South.[12][75] With no major Southern state remaining, Clinton targeted New York, which had many delegates. He scored a resounding victory in New York City, shedding his image as a regional candidate.[75] Having been transformed into the consensus candidate, he secured the Democratic Party nomination, finishing with a victory in Jerry Brown's home state of California.[12] During the campaign, questions of conflict of interest regarding state business and the politically powerful Rose Law Firm, at which Hillary Rodham Clinton was a partner, arose. Clinton argued the questions were moot because all transactions with the state had been deducted before determining Hillary's firm pay.[78] Further concern arose when Bill Clinton announced that, with Hillary, voters would be getting two presidents \"for the price of one\".[79] Clinton was still the governor of Arkansas while campaigning for U.S. president, and he returned to his home state to see that Ricky Ray Rector would be executed. After killing a police officer and a civilian, Rector shot himself in the head, leading to what his lawyers said was a state where he could still talk but did not understand the idea of death. According to both Arkansas state law and federal law, a seriously mentally impaired inmate cannot be executed. The courts disagreed with the allegation of grave mental impairment and allowed the execution. Clinton's return to Arkansas for the execution was framed in an article for The New York Times as a possible political move to counter \"soft on crime\" accusations.[57][80] Bush's approval ratings were around 80 percent during the Gulf War, and he was described as unbeatable. When Bush compromised with Democrats to try to lower federal deficits, he reneged on his promise not to raise taxes, which hurt his approval rating. Clinton repeatedly condemned Bush for making a promise he failed to keep.[75] By election time, the economy was souring and Bush saw his approval rating plummet to just slightly over 40 percent.[75][81] Finally, conservatives were previously united by anti-communism, but with the end of the Cold War, the party lacked a uniting issue. When Pat Buchanan and Pat Robertson addressed Christian themes at the Republican National Convention—with Bush criticizing Democrats for omitting God from their platform—many moderates were alienated.[82] Clinton then pointed to his moderate, \"New Democrat\" record as governor of Arkansas, though some on the more liberal side of the party remained suspicious.[83] Many Democrats who had supported Ronald Reagan and Bush in previous elections switched their support to Clinton.[84] Clinton and his running mate, Al Gore, toured the country during the final weeks of the campaign, shoring up support and pledging a \"new beginning\".[84] On March 26, 1992, during a Democratic fund raiser of the presidential campaign, Robert Rafsky confronted then Gov. Bill Clinton of Arkansas and asked what he was going to do about AIDS, to which Clinton replied, \"I feel your pain\".[85] The televised exchange led to AIDS becoming an issue in the 1992 presidential election. On April 4, then candidate Clinton met with members of ACT UP and other leading AIDS advocates to discuss his AIDS agenda and agreed to make a major AIDS policy speech, to have people with HIV speak to the Democratic Convention, and to sign onto the AIDS United Action five point plan.[86] Clinton won the 1992 presidential election (370 electoral votes) against Republican incumbent George H. W. Bush (168 electoral votes) and billionaire populist Ross Perot (zero electoral votes), who ran as an independent on a platform that focused on domestic issues. Bush's steep decline in public approval was a significant part of Clinton's success.[84] Clinton's victory in the election ended twelve years of Republican rule of the White House and twenty of the previous twenty-four years. The election gave Democrats full control of the United States Congress,[3] the first time one party controlled both the executive and legislative branches since Democrats held the 96th United States Congress during the presidency of Jimmy Carter.[87][88] According to Seymour Martin Lipset, the 1992 election had several unique characteristics. Voters felt that economic conditions were worse than they actually were, which harmed Bush. A rare event was the presence of a strong third-party candidate. Liberals launched a backlash against 12 years of a conservative White House. The chief factor was Clinton's uniting his party, and winning over a number of heterogeneous groups.[89] Clinton's \"third way\" of moderate liberalism built up the nation's fiscal health and put the nation on a firm footing abroad amid globalization and the development of anti-American terrorist organizations.[90] During his presidency, Clinton advocated for a wide variety of legislation and programs, most of which were enacted into law or implemented by the executive branch. His policies, particularly the North American Free Trade Agreement and welfare reform, have been attributed to a centrist Third Way philosophy of governance.[91][92] His policy of fiscal conservatism helped to reduce deficits on budgetary matters.[93][94] Clinton presided over the longest period of peacetime economic expansion in American history.[95][96] The Congressional Budget Office reported budget surpluses of $69 billion in 1998, $126 billion in 1999, and $236 billion in 2000,[97] during the last three years of Clinton's presidency.[98] Over the years of the recorded surplus, the gross national debt rose each year. At the end of the fiscal year (September 30) for each of the years a surplus was recorded, the U.S. Treasury reported a gross debt of $5.413 trillion in 1997, $5.526 trillion in 1998, $5.656 trillion in 1999, and $5.674 trillion in 2000.[99][100] Over the same period, the Office of Management and Budget reported an end of year (December 31) gross debt of $5.369 trillion in 1997, $5.478 trillion in 1998, $5.606 in 1999, and $5.629 trillion in 2000.[101] At the end of his presidency, the Clintons moved to 15 Old House Lane in Chappaqua, New York, in order to quell political worries about his wife's residency for election as a U.S. Senator from New York.[102] \"Our democracy must be not only the envy of the world but the engine of our own renewal. There is nothing wrong with America that cannot be cured by what is right with America.\" After his presidential transition, Clinton was inaugurated as the 42nd president of the United States on January 20, 1993. Clinton was physically exhausted at the time, and had an inexperienced staff. His high levels of public support dropped in the first few weeks, as he made a series of mistakes. His first choice for attorney general had not paid her taxes on babysitters and was forced to withdraw. The second appointee also withdrew for the same reason. Clinton had repeatedly promised to encourage gays in the military service, despite what he knew to be the strong opposition of the military leadership. He tried anyway, and was publicly opposed by the top generals, and forced by Congress to a compromise position of \"Don't ask, don't tell\" whereby gays could serve if and only if they kept it secret.[104] He devised a $16-billion stimulus package primarily to aid inner-city programs desired by liberals, but it was defeated by a Republican filibuster in the Senate.[105] His popularity at the 100 day mark of his term was the lowest of any president at that point.[106] Public opinion did support one liberal program, and Clinton signed the Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993, which required large employers to allow employees to take unpaid leave for pregnancy or a serious medical condition. This action had bipartisan support,[107] and was popular with the public.[108] Two days after taking office, on January 22, 1993—the 20th anniversary of the U.S. Supreme Court decision in Roe v. Wade—Clinton reversed restrictions on domestic and international family planning programs that had been imposed by Reagan and Bush.[109] Clinton said abortion should be kept \"safe, legal, and rare\"—a slogan that had been suggested by political scientist Samuel L. Popkin and first used by Clinton in December 1991, while campaigning.[110] During the eight years of the Clinton administration, the abortion rate declined by 18 percent.[111] On February 15, 1993, Clinton made his first address to the nation, announcing his plan to raise taxes to close a budget deficit.[112] Two days later, in a nationally televised address to a joint session of Congress, Clinton unveiled his economic plan. The plan focused on reducing the deficit rather than on cutting taxes for the middle class, which had been high on his campaign agenda.[113] Clinton's advisers pressured him to raise taxes, based on the theory that a smaller federal budget deficit would reduce bond interest rates.[114] President Clinton's attorney general Janet Reno authorized the FBI's use of armored vehicles to deploy tear gas into the buildings of the Branch Davidian community near Waco, Texas, in hopes of ending a 51 day siege. During the operation on April 19, 1993, the buildings caught fire and 75 of the residents died, including 24 children. The raid had originally been planned by the Bush administration; Clinton had played no role.[115][116] In August, Clinton signed the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993, which passed Congress without a Republican vote. It cut taxes for 15 million low-income families, made tax cuts available to 90 percent of small businesses,[117] and raised taxes on the wealthiest 1.2 percent of taxpayers. Additionally, it mandated that the budget be balanced over many years through the implementation of spending restraints.[118] On September 22, 1993, Clinton made a major speech to Congress regarding a health care reform plan; the program aimed at achieving universal coverage through a national health care plan. This was one of the most prominent items on Clinton's legislative agenda and resulted from a task force headed by Hillary Clinton. The plan was well received in political circles, but it was eventually doomed by well-organized lobby opposition from conservatives, the American Medical Association, and the health insurance industry. However, Clinton biographer John F. Harris said the program failed because of a lack of coordination within the White House.[56] Despite the Democratic majority in Congress, the effort to create a national health care system ultimately died when compromise legislation by George J. Mitchell failed to gain a majority of support in August 1994. The failure of the bill was the first major legislative defeat of the Clinton administration.[53][56] On November 30, 1993, Clinton signed into law the Brady Bill, which mandated federal background checks on people who purchase firearms in the United States. The law also imposed a five-day waiting period on purchases, until the NICS system was implemented in 1998. He also expanded the Earned Income Tax Credit, a subsidy for low-income workers.[56] In December of the same year, allegations by Arkansas state troopers Larry Patterson and Roger Perry were first reported by David Brock in The American Spectator. In the affair later known as \"Troopergate\", the officers alleged that they had arranged sexual liaisons for Clinton back when he was governor of Arkansas. The story mentioned a woman named Paula, a reference to Paula Jones. Brock later apologized to Clinton, saying the article was politically motivated \"bad journalism\", and that \"the troopers were greedy and had slimy motives\".[119] That month, Clinton implemented a Department of Defense directive known as \"Don't Ask, Don't Tell\", which allowed gay men and women to serve in the armed services provided they kept their sexual orientation a secret. The Act forbade the military from inquiring about an individual's sexual orientation.[120] The policy was developed as a compromise after Clinton's proposal to allow gays to serve openly in the military met staunch opposition from prominent Congressional Republicans and Democrats, including senators John McCain (R-AZ) and Sam Nunn (D-GA). According to David Mixner, Clinton's support for the compromise led to a heated dispute with Vice President Al Gore, who felt that \"the President should lift the ban ... even though [his executive order] was sure to be overridden by the Congress\".[121] Some gay-rights advocates criticized Clinton for not going far enough and accused him of making his campaign promise to get votes and contributions.[122] Their position was that Clinton should have integrated the military by executive order, noting that President Harry S. Truman used executive order to racially desegregate the armed forces. Clinton's defenders argued that an executive order might have prompted the Senate to write the exclusion of gays into law, potentially making it harder to integrate the military in the future.[53] Later in his presidency, in 1999, Clinton criticized the way the policy was implemented, saying he did not think any serious person could say it was not \"out of whack\".[123] The policy remained controversial, and was finally repealed in 2011, removing open sexual orientation as a reason for dismissal from the armed forces.[124] On January 1, 1994, Clinton signed the North American Free Trade Agreement into law.[125] Throughout his first year in office, Clinton consistently supported ratification of the treaty by the U.S. Senate. Clinton and most of his allies in the Democratic Leadership Committee strongly supported free trade measures; there remained, however, strong disagreement within the party. Opposition came chiefly from anti-trade Republicans, protectionist Democrats and supporters of Ross Perot. The bill passed the house with 234 votes in favor and 200 votes opposed (132 Republicans and 102 Democrats in favor; 156 Democrats, 43 Republicans, and one independent opposed). The treaty was then ratified by the Senate and signed into law by the president.[125] On July 29, 1994, the Clinton administration launched the first official White House website, whitehouse.gov.[126] The site was followed with three more versions, with the final version being launched on July 21, 2000.[126] The White House website was part of a wider movement of the Clinton administration toward web-based communication. According to Robert Longley, \"Clinton and Gore were responsible for pressing almost all federal agencies, the U.S. court system and the U.S. military onto the Internet, thus opening up America's government to more of America's citizens than ever before. On July 17, 1996, Clinton issued Executive Order 13011—Federal Information Technology, ordering the heads of all federal agencies to utilize information technology fully to make the information of the agency easily accessible to the public.\"[127] The Omnibus Crime Bill, which Clinton signed into law in September 1994,[128] made many changes to U.S. crime and law enforcement legislation including the expansion of the death penalty to include crimes not resulting in death, such as running a large-scale drug enterprise. During Clinton's re-election campaign he said, \"My 1994 crime bill expanded the death penalty for drug kingpins, murderers of federal law enforcement officers, and nearly 60 additional categories of violent felons.\"[129] It also included a subsection of assault weapons ban for a ten-year period.[130] After two years of Democratic Party control, the Democrats lost control of Congress to the Republicans in the mid-term elections in 1994, for the first time in forty years.[131] A speech delivered by President Bill Clinton at the December 6, 1995 White House Conference on HIV/AIDS projected that a cure for AIDS and a vaccine to prevent further infection would be developed. The President focused on his administration's accomplishments and efforts related to the epidemic, including an accelerated drug-approval process. He also condemned homophobia and discrimination against people with HIV. Clinton announced three new initiatives: creating a special working group to coordinate AIDS research throughout the federal government; convening public health experts to develop an action plan that integrates HIV prevention with substance abuse prevention; and launching a new effort by the Department of Justice to ensure that health care facilities provide equal access to people with HIV and AIDS.[132] 1996 would mark the first year since the beginning of the HIV/AIDS epidemic that the number of new HIV/AIDS diagnoses would decline, with the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) even later reporting a significant 47% decline in the number of AIDS-related deaths in 1997 compared to the previous year.[133][134][135] Credit for this decline would be given to the growing effectiveness of new drug therapy which was promoted by the Clinton Administration's Department of Health and Human Services, such as highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART).[134][135] On September 21, 1996, Clinton signed into law the Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA), which defined marriage for federal purposes as the legal union of one man and one woman; the legislation allowed individual states to refuse to recognize gay marriages that were performed in other states.[136] Paul Yandura, speaking for the White House gay and lesbian liaison office, said Clinton's signing DOMA \"was a political decision that they made at the time of a re-election\". In defense of his actions, Clinton has said that DOMA was intended to \"head off an attempt to send a constitutional amendment banning gay marriage to the states\", a possibility he described as highly likely in the context of a \"very reactionary Congress\".[137] Administration spokesman Richard Socarides said, \"the alternatives we knew were going to be far worse, and it was time to move on and get the president re-elected.\"[138] Clinton himself said DOMA was something \"which the Republicans put on the ballot to try to get the base vote for Bush up, I think it's obvious that something had to be done to try to keep the Republican Congress from presenting that\";[139] others were more critical. The veteran gay rights and gay marriage activist Evan Wolfson has called these claims \"historic revisionism\".[138] Despite this, it has been noted that other than a brief written response to a Reader's Digest that questioned whether he agreed with it, Clinton had made no documented reference to the issue of gay marriage until May 1996.[140] In a July 2, 2011, editorial The New York Times opined, \"The Defense of Marriage Act was enacted in 1996 as an election-year wedge issue, signed by President Bill Clinton in one of his worst policy moments.\"[141] Ultimately, in United States v. Windsor, the U.S. Supreme Court struck down DOMA in June 2013.[142] Despite DOMA, Clinton was the first president to select openly gay persons for administrative positions,[143] and he is generally credited as being the first president to publicly champion gay rights.[144] During his presidency, Clinton issued two substantially controversial executive orders on behalf of gay rights, the first lifting the ban on security clearances for LGBT federal employees[145] and the second outlawing discrimination based on sexual orientation in the federal civilian workforce.[146] Under Clinton's leadership, federal funding for HIV/AIDS research, prevention and treatment more than doubled.[147] Clinton also pushed for passing hate crimes laws for gays and for the private sector Employment Non-Discrimination Act, which, buoyed by his lobbying, failed to pass the Senate by a single vote in 1996.[148] Advocacy for these issues, paired with the politically unpopular nature of the gay rights movement at the time, led to enthusiastic support for Clinton's election and reelection by the Human Rights Campaign.[144] Clinton came out for gay marriage in July 2009[149] and urged the Supreme Court to overturn DOMA in 2013.[150] He was later honored by GLAAD for his prior pro-gay stances and his reversal on DOMA.[151] \"When I took office, only high energy physicists had ever heard of what is called the Worldwide Web ... Now even my cat has its own page.\" The 1996 United States campaign finance controversy was an alleged effort by China to influence the domestic policies of the United States, before and during the Clinton administration, and involved the fundraising practices of the administration itself.[153][154] Despite the evidence,[153][155] the Chinese government denied all accusations.[156] As part of a 1996 initiative to curb illegal immigration, Clinton signed the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act (IIRIRA) on September 30, 1996. Appointed by Clinton,[157] the U.S. Commission on Immigration Reform recommended reducing legal immigration from about 800,000 people a year to about 550,000.[158][159] In November 1996, Clinton narrowly escaped possible assassination in the Philippines,[160] which was a bridge bomb planted by al-Qaeda and was masterminded by Osama bin Laden. During Clinton's presidency, the attempt remained top secret,[161] and it remains classified as of March 2024[update], when Reuters reported having spoken with eight retired secret service agents about the incident.[162] Leading up to the 1996 presidential election, Clinton's chances of being re-elected initially seemed slim, partially due to his growing untrust among the general public due to the Whitewater controversy[163][164] and the lopsided defeat of national Democrats in the 1994 elections.[165][166] His approval rating got as low as 40 percent in early 1995, which led to several high-profile Democrats suggesting he drop out of the race.[167][168] However in mid-1995, as a result of a rebounding economy and the growing unpopularity of congressional Republicans, public opinion of Clinton steadily up-ticked[169][170][171] and early 1996 polls found he had a lead of up to 20 points over his likely Republican opponent Bob Dole.[172] Unlike Bush in the 1992 election, Clinton's incumbency greatly benefited him in the general election,[173] as most Americans felt the country was going in the right direction.[174] Along with Dole, Clinton once again faced Ross Perot, who was nominated by the Reform Party, but he garnered significantly less support than he did in the 1992 election.[175] In the month leading up the election, pundits were predicting a big win for Clinton, as his approval rating saw a high of 60 percent[176] and pollsters finding he was favored with voters in over 30 states.[177][178][179] On election day, Clinton won 379 electoral votes, securing reelection and defeating Dole, who received 159 electoral votes.[180] Clinton garnered 49.2 percent of the popular vote to Dole's 40.7 percent and Perot's 8.4 percent. With his victory, he became the first Democrat to win two consecutive presidential elections since Franklin D. Roosevelt.[181][182] In the January 1997, State of the Union address, Clinton proposed a new initiative to provide health coverage to up to five million children. Senators Ted Kennedy—a Democrat—and Orrin Hatch—a Republican—teamed up with Hillary Rodham Clinton and her staff in 1997, and succeeded in passing legislation forming the State Children's Health Insurance Program (SCHIP), the largest (successful) health care reform in the years of the Clinton Presidency. That year, Hillary Clinton shepherded through Congress the Adoption and Safe Families Act and two years later she succeeded in helping pass the Foster Care Independence Act. Bill Clinton negotiated the passage of the Balanced Budget Act of 1997 by the Republican Congress. In October 1997, Clinton announced he was getting hearing aids, due to hearing loss attributed to his age, and his time spent as a musician in his youth.[183] In 1999, he signed into law the Financial Services Modernization Act also known as the Gramm–Leach–Bliley Act, which repealed the part of the Glass–Steagall Act that had prohibited a bank from offering a full range of investment, commercial banking, and insurance services since its enactment in 1933.[184] In November 1993, David Hale—the source of criminal allegations against Bill Clinton in the Whitewater controversy—alleged that while governor of Arkansas, Clinton pressured Hale to provide an illegal $300,000 loan to Susan McDougal, the Clintons' partner in the Whitewater land deal.[185] A U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission investigation resulted in convictions against the McDougals for their role in the Whitewater project, but the Clintons themselves were never charged, and Clinton maintains his and his wife's innocence in the affair.[186] Investigations by Robert B. Fiske and Ken Starr found insufficient to evidence to prosecute the Clintons.[187][188] The White House FBI files controversy of June 1996 arose concerning improper access by the White House to FBI security-clearance documents. Craig Livingstone, head of the White House Office of Personnel Security, improperly requested, and received from the FBI, background report files without asking permission of the subject individuals; many of these were employees of former Republican administrations.[189] In March 2000, Independent Counsel Robert Ray determined there was no credible evidence of any crime. Ray's report further stated, \"there was no substantial and credible evidence that any senior White House official was involved\" in seeking the files.[190] On May 19, 1993, Clinton fired seven employees of the White House Travel Office. This caused the White House travel office controversy even though the travel office staff served at the pleasure of the president and could be dismissed without cause. The White House responded to the controversy by claiming that the firings were done in response to financial improprieties that had been revealed by a brief FBI investigation.[191] Critics contended that the firings had been done to allow friends of the Clintons to take over the travel business and the involvement of the FBI was unwarranted.[192] The House Government Reform and Oversight Committee issued a report which accused the Clinton administration of having obstructed their efforts to investigate the affair.[193] Special counsel Robert Fiske said that Hillary Clinton was involved in the firing and gave \"factually false\" testimony to the GAO, congress, and the independent counsel. However Fiske said there was not enough evidence to prosecute.[194][193] After a House inquiry, Clinton was impeached on December 19, 1998, by the House of Representatives. The House voted 228–206 to impeach him for perjury to a grand jury[195] and voted 221–212 to impeach him for obstruction of justice.[196] Clinton was only the second U.S. president (the first being Andrew Johnson) to be impeached.[197] Impeachment proceedings were based on allegations that Clinton had illegally lied about and covered up his relationship with 22-year-old White House (and later Department of Defense) employee Monica Lewinsky.[198] After the Starr Report was submitted to the House providing what it termed \"substantial and credible information that President Clinton Committed Acts that May Constitute Grounds for an Impeachment\",[199] the House began impeachment hearings against Clinton before the mid-term elections. To hold impeachment proceedings, Republican leadership called a lame-duck session in December 1998. While the House Judiciary Committee hearings ended in a straight party-line vote, there was lively debate on the House floor. The two charges passed in the House (largely with Republican support, but with a handful of Democratic votes as well) were for perjury and obstruction of justice. The perjury charge arose from Clinton's testimony before a grand jury that had been convened to investigate perjury he may have committed in his sworn deposition during Jones v. Clinton, Paula Jones's sexual harassment lawsuit.[200] The obstruction charge was based on his actions to conceal his relationship with Lewinsky before and after that deposition. The Senate later acquitted Clinton of both charges.[201] The Senate refused to meet to hold an impeachment trial before the end of the old term, so the trial was held over until the next Congress. Clinton was represented by Washington law firm Williams & Connolly.[202] The Senate finished a twenty-one-day trial on February 12, 1999, with the vote of 55 not guilty/45 guilty on the perjury charge[201] and 50 not guilty/50 guilty on the obstruction of justice charge.[203] Both votes fell short of the constitutional two-thirds majority requirement to convict and remove an officeholder. The final vote was generally along party lines, with no Democrats voting guilty, and only a handful of Republicans voting not guilty.[201] On January 19, 2001, Clinton's law license was suspended for five years after he acknowledged to an Arkansas circuit court he had engaged in conduct prejudicial to the administration of justice in the Jones case.[204][205] On October 1, the U.S. Supreme Court suspended Clinton from practicing law in the high court, citing fallout from the Lewinsky scandal,[206] but rather than appealing the decision he resigned from the bar entirely.[207] Clinton issued 141 pardons and 36 commutations on his last day in office on January 20, 2001.[56][208] Controversy surrounded Marc Rich and allegations that Hillary Clinton's brother, Hugh Rodham, accepted payments in return for influencing the president's decision-making regarding the pardons.[209] Federal prosecutor Mary Jo White was appointed to investigate the pardon of Rich. She was later replaced by then-Republican James Comey. The investigation found no wrongdoing on Clinton's part.[210] Clinton also pardoned four defendants in the Whitewater Scandal, Chris Wade, Susan McDougal, Stephen Smith, and Robert W. Palmer, all of whom had ties to Clinton when he was governor of Arkansas.[211] Former Clinton HUD Secretary Henry Cisneros, who pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI, was also among Clinton's pardons.[212] In February 1997 it was discovered upon documents being released by the Clinton Administration that 938 people had stayed at the White House and that 821 of them had made donations to the Democratic Party and got the opportunity to stay in the Lincoln bedroom as a result of the donations.[213][214] Some donors included Steven Spielberg, Tom Hanks, Jane Fonda, and Judy Collins. Top donors also got golf games and morning jogs with Clinton as a result of the contributions.[214] Janet Reno was called on to investigate the matter by Trent Lott, but she refused.[215] In 1996, it was found that several Chinese foreigners made contributions to Clinton's reelection campaign and the Democratic National Committee with the backing of the People's Republic of China. Some of them also attempted to donate to Clinton's defense fund.[216] This violated United States law forbidding non-American citizens from making campaign contributions. Clinton and Al Gore also allegedly met with the foreign donors.[217][218][219][220] A Republican investigation led by Fred Thompson found that Clinton was targeted by the Chinese government. However, Democratic senators Joe Lieberman and John Glenn said that the evidence showed that China only targeted congressional elections and not presidential elections.[221] American troops had first entered Somalia during the Bush administration in response to a humanitarian crisis and civil war. Though initially involved to assist humanitarian efforts, the Clinton administration shifted the objectives set out in the mission and began pursuing a policy of attempting to neutralize Somali warlords. In 1993, during the Battle of Mogadishu, two U.S. helicopters were shot down by rocket-propelled grenade attacks to their tail rotors, trapping soldiers behind enemy lines. This resulted in an urban battle that killed 18 American soldiers, wounded 73 others, and resulted in one being taken prisoner.[222] Television news programs depicted the supporters of warlord Mohammed Aidid desecrating the corpses of troops.[222] The backlash resulting from the incident prompted in a drop in support for American intervention in the country and coincided with a more cautious use of troops throughout the rest of the Clinton administration.[222] Following a subsequent national security policy review, U.S. forces were withdrawn from Somalia and later conflicts were approached with fewer soldiers on the ground.[223][224] In April 1994, genocide broke out in Rwanda. Intelligence reports indicate that Clinton was aware a \"final solution to eliminate all Tutsis\" was underway, long before the administration publicly used the word \"genocide\".[225][226][227] Fearing a reprisal of the events in Somalia the previous year, Clinton chose not to intervene.[228] Clinton has called his failure to intervene one of his main foreign policy failings, saying \"I don't think we could have ended the violence, but I think we could have cut it down. And I regret it.\"[229] In 1993 and 1994, Clinton pressured Western European leaders to adopt a strong military policy against Bosnian Serbs during the Bosnian War. This strategy faced staunch opposition from the United Nations, NATO allies, and Congressional Republicans, leading Clinton to adopt a more diplomatic approach.[230] In 1995, U.S. and NATO aircraft bombed Bosnian Serb targets to halt attacks on UN safe zones and pressure them into a peace accord that would end the Bosnian war. Clinton deployed U.S. peacekeepers to Bosnia in late 1995, to uphold the subsequent Dayton Agreement.[231] In 1992, before his presidency, Clinton proposed sending a peace envoy to Northern Ireland, but this was dropped to avoid tensions with the British government. In November 1995, in a ceasefire during the Troubles, Clinton became the first president to visit Northern Ireland, examining both of the two divided communities of Belfast.[232] Despite unionist criticism, Clinton used his visit as a way to negotiate an end to the violent conflict, playing a key role in the peace talks that produced the Good Friday Agreement in 1998.[233] Clinton sought to continue the Bush administration's policy of limiting Iranian influence in the Middle East, which he laid out in the dual containment strategy. In 1994, Clinton declared that Iran was a \"state sponsor of terrorism\" and a \"rogue state\", marking the first time that an American President used that term.[234] Subsequent executive orders heavily sanctioned Iran's oil industry and banned almost all trade between U.S. companies and the Iranian government. In February 1996, the Clinton administration agreed to pay Iran US$131.8 million (equivalent to $256.05 million in 2023) in settlement to discontinue a case brought by Iran in 1989 against the U.S. in the International Court of Justice after the shooting down of Iran Air Flight 655 by the U.S. Navy guided missile cruiser.[235] In Clinton's 1998 State of the Union Address, he warned Congress that Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein was building an arsenal of chemical, biological and nuclear weapons.[236] Clinton signed the Iraq Liberation Act of 1998 on October 31, 1998, which instituted a policy of \"regime change\" against Iraq, though it explicitly stated it did not provide for direct intervention on the part of American military forces.[237][238] The administration then launched a four-day bombing campaign named Operation Desert Fox, lasting from December 16 to 19, 1998. At the end of this operation Clinton announced that \"So long as Saddam remains in power, he will remain a threat to his people, his region, and the world. With our allies, we must pursue a strategy to contain him and to constrain his weapons of mass destruction program, while working toward the day Iraq has a government willing to live at peace with its people and with its neighbors.\"[239] American and British aircraft in the Iraq no-fly zones attacked hostile Iraqi air defenses 166 times in 1999 and 78 times in 2000.[240] Capturing Osama bin Laden was an objective of the U.S. government during the Clinton presidency (and continued to be until bin Laden's death in 2011).[241] Despite claims by Mansoor Ijaz and Sudanese officials that the Sudanese government had offered to arrest and extradite bin Laden, and that U.S. authorities rejected each offer,[242] the 9/11 Commission Report stated that \"we have not found any reliable evidence to support the Sudanese claim\".[243] In response to a 1996 State Department warning about bin Laden[244] and the 1998 bombings of U.S. embassies in East Africa by al-Qaeda (which killed 224 people, including 12 Americans), Clinton ordered several military missions to capture or kill bin Laden, all of which were unsuccessful. In August 1998, Clinton ordered cruise missile strikes on terrorist targets in Afghanistan and Sudan, targeting the Al-Shifa pharmaceutical factory in Sudan, which was suspected of assisting bin Laden in making chemical weapons, and bin Laden's terrorist training camps in Afghanistan. The factory was destroyed by the attack, resulting in the death of one employee and the wounding of 11 other people.[245] After the destruction of the factory, there was a medicine shortage in Sudan due to the plant providing 50 percent of Sudan's medicine, and the destruction of the plant led to a shortage of chloroquine, a drug which is used to treat malaria.[246] U.S. officials later acknowledged that there was no evidence the plant was acknowledging manufacturing or storing nerve gas.[247] The attack provoked criticism of Clinton from journalists and academics including Christopher Hitchens,[248] Seymour Hersh,[249] Max Taylor,[250] and others.[251] In the midst of a brutal crackdown on ethnic Albanian separatists in the province of Kosovo by the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, Clinton authorized the use of U.S. Armed Forces in a NATO bombing campaign against Yugoslavia in 1999, named Operation Allied Force.[252] The stated reasoning behind the intervention was to stop the ethnic cleansing (and what the Clinton administration labeled genocide)[253][254] of Albanians by Yugoslav anti-guerilla military units. General Wesley Clark was Supreme Allied Commander of NATO and oversaw the mission. With United Nations Security Council Resolution 1244, the bombing campaign ended on June 10, 1999. The resolution placed Kosovo under UN administration and authorized a peacekeeping force to be deployed to the region.[255] NATO announced its soldiers all survived combat,[256] though two died in an Apache helicopter crash.[257] Journalists in the popular press criticized genocide statements by the Clinton administration as false and greatly exaggerated.[258][259] Prior to the bombing campaign on March 24, 1999, estimates showed that the number of civilians killed in the over year long conflict in Kosovo had been approximately 1,800, with critics asserting that little or no evidence existed of genocide.[260][261] In a post-war inquiry, the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe noted \"the patterns of the expulsions and the vast increase in lootings, killings, rape, kidnappings and pillage once the NATO air war began on March 24.\"[262] In 2001, the UN-supervised Supreme Court of Kosovo ruled that genocide (the intent to destroy a people) did not take place, but recognized \"a systematic campaign of terror, including murders, rapes, arsons and severe maltreatments\" with the intention being the forceful departure of the Albanian population.[263] The term \"ethnic cleansing\" was used as an alternative to \"genocide\" to denote not just ethnically motivated murder but also displacement, though critics charge there is little difference.[264] Slobodan Milošević, the president of Yugoslavia at the time of the atrocities, was eventually brought to trial before the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia in the Hague on charges including crimes against humanity and war crimes for his role in the war.[265] He died in 2006, before the completion of the trial.[265][266] Clinton aimed to increase trade with China, minimizing import tariffs and offering the country most favoured nation status in 1993, his administration minimized tariff levels in Chinese imports. Clinton initially conditioned extension of this status on human rights reforms, but ultimately decided to extend the status despite a lack of reform in the specified areas, including free emigration, treatment of prisoners in terms of international human rights, and observation of human rights specified by UN resolutions, among others.[267] Relations were damaged briefly by the American bombing of the Chinese embassy in Belgrade in May 1999. Clinton apologized for the bombing, stating it was accidental.[268] On October 10, 2000, Clinton signed into law the United States–China Relations Act of 2000, which granted permanent normal trade relations (PNTR) trade status to China.[269] The president asserted that free trade would gradually open China to democratic reform.[270][271] In encouraging Congress to approve the agreement and China's accession to the World Trade Organization (WTO), Clinton stated that more trade with China would advance America's economic interests, saying that \"economically, this agreement is the equivalent of a one-way street. It requires China to open its markets—with a fifth of the world's population, potentially the biggest markets in the world—to both our products and services in unprecedented new ways.\"[272] Clinton attempted to end the Israeli–Palestinian conflict. Secret negotiations mediated by Clinton between Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin and Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) Chairman Yasser Arafat led to a historic declaration of peace in September 1993, called the Oslo Accords, which were signed at the White House on September 13. The agreement led to the Israel–Jordan peace treaty in 1994 and the Wye River Memorandum in October 1998, however, this did not end the conflict. He brought Israeli prime minister Ehud Barak and Palestinian Authority chairman Yasser Arafat together at Camp David for the 2000 Camp David Summit, which lasted 14 days in July.[56] Following another attempt in December 2000 at Bolling Air Force Base, in which the president offered the Clinton Parameters, the situation broke down completely after the end of the Taba Summit and with the start of the Second Intifada.[56] Clinton appointed two justices to the Supreme Court: Ruth Bader Ginsburg in 1993[273] and Stephen Breyer in 1994.[274] Both justices went on to serve until the 2020s, leaving a lasting judicial legacy for President Clinton.[275] Clinton was the first president in history to appoint more women and minority judges than white male judges to the federal courts.[276] In his eight years in office, 11.6% of Clinton's court of appeals nominees and 17.4% of his district court nominees were black; 32.8% of his court of appeals nominees and 28.5% of his district court nominees were women.[276] Throughout Clinton's first term, his job approval rating fluctuated in the 40s and 50s. In his second term, his rating consistently ranged from the high-50s to the high-60s.[277] After his impeachment proceedings in 1998 and 1999, Clinton's rating reached its highest point.[278] According to a CBS News/New York Times poll, Clinton left office with an approval rating of 68 percent, which matched those of Ronald Reagan and Franklin D. Roosevelt as the highest ratings for departing presidents in the modern era.[279] Clinton's average Gallup poll approval rating for his last quarter in office was 61 percent, the highest final quarter rating any president has received for fifty years.[280] Forty-seven percent of the respondents identified themselves as being Clinton supporters.[280] As he was leaving office, a CNN/USA Today/Gallup poll revealed that 45 percent of Americans said they would miss him; 55 percent thought he \"would have something worthwhile to contribute and should remain active in public life\"; 68 percent thought he would be remembered more for his \"involvement in personal scandal\" than for \"his accomplishments\"; and 58 percent answered \"No\" to the question \"Do you generally think Bill Clinton is honest and trustworthy?\"[280] The same percentage said he would be remembered as either \"outstanding\" or \"above average\" as a president, while 22 percent said he would be remembered as \"below average\" or \"poor\".[280] ABC News characterized public consensus on Clinton as, \"You can't trust him, he's got weak morals and ethics—and he's done a heck of a good job.\"[281] During his first term, roughly 7 in 10 Americans believed that the media unfairly covered Clinton's character flaws, according to polling.[282] A year after he left office, a Gallup poll found that 51 percent of respondents said they approved of the overall job Clinton did as president.[283] In May 2006, a CNN poll comparing Clinton's job performance with that of his successor, George W. Bush, found that a strong majority of respondents said Clinton outperformed Bush in six different areas questioned.[284] A June 2006 poll by Gallup found that 61 percent of Americans said they approved of the job Clinton did as president, a 10-point increase from the 2002 poll.[285] Gallup polls in 2007 and 2011 showed that Clinton was regarded by 13 percent of Americans as the greatest president in U.S. history.[286][287] In 2010, 69 percent of respondents in a Gallup survey said they approved of the job Clinton did as president, including 47 percent of Republicans and 68 percent of independents. His sudden spike in popularity during this time was attributed to Americans comparing him to then-incumbent Democratic president Barack Obama, who had low approval ratings.[288] In 2014, 18 percent of respondents in a Quinnipiac University Polling Institute poll of American voters regarded Clinton as the best president since World War II, making him the third most popular among postwar presidents, behind John F. Kennedy and Ronald Reagan.[289] The same poll showed that just 3 percent of American voters regarded Clinton as the worst president since World War II.[289] A 2015 poll by The Washington Post asked 162 scholars of the American Political Science Association to rank all the U.S. presidents in order of greatness. According to their findings, Clinton ranked eighth overall, with a rating of 70 percent.[290] Clinton was the first baby boomer president.[291] Authors Martin Walker and Bob Woodward stated that Clinton's innovative use of sound bite-ready dialogue, personal charisma, and public perception-oriented campaigning were a major factor in his high public approval ratings.[292][293] When Clinton played the saxophone on The Arsenio Hall Show, he was described by some religious conservatives as \"the MTV president\".[294][295] Opponents sometimes referred to him as \"Slick Willie\", a nickname which was first applied to him in 1980 by Pine Bluff Commercial journalist Paul Greenberg;[296] Greenberg believed that Clinton was abandoning the progressive policies of previous Arkansas Governors such as Winthrop Rockefeller, Dale Bumpers and David Pryor.[296] The claim \"Slick Willie\" would last throughout his presidency.[297] His folksy manner led him to be nicknamed Bubba starting from the 1992 presidential election.[298] Since 2000, he has frequently been referred to as \"The Big Dog\" or \"Big Dog\".[299][300] His prominent role in campaigning for Obama during the 2012 presidential election and his widely publicized speech at the 2012 Democratic National Convention, where he officially nominated Obama and criticized Republican nominee Mitt Romney and Republican policies in detail, earned him the nickname \"Explainer-in-Chief\".[301][302] Clinton drew strong support from the African American community and insisted that the improvement of race relations would be a major theme of his presidency.[303] In 1998, Nobel laureate Toni Morrison called Clinton \"the first black president\", saying, \"Clinton displays almost every trope of blackness: single-parent household, born poor, working-class, saxophone-playing, McDonald's-and-junk-food-loving boy from Arkansas\".[304] Morrison noted that Clinton's sex life was scrutinized more than his career accomplishments, and she compared this to the stereotyping and double standards that, she said, black people typically endure.[304] Many viewed this comparison as unfair and disparaging both to Clinton and to the African-American community.[305] Several women have publicly accused Clinton of sexual misconduct, including rape, harassment, and sexual assault. Additionally, some commentators have characterized Clinton's sexual relationship with former White House intern Monica Lewinsky as predatory or non-consensual, despite the fact that Lewinsky called the relationship consensual at the time. These allegations have been revisited and lent more credence in 2018, in light of the #MeToo movement, with many commentators and Democratic leaders now saying Clinton should have been compelled to resign after the Lewinsky affair.[306][307][308] In 1994, Paula Jones initiated a sexual harassment lawsuit against Clinton, claiming he had made unwanted advances towards her in 1991; Clinton denied the allegations. In April 1998, the case was initially dismissed by Judge Susan Webber Wright on the grounds that it lacked legal merit.[309] Jones appealed Webber Wright's ruling, and her suit gained traction following Clinton's admission to having an affair with Monica Lewinsky in August 1998.[310] In 1998, lawyers for Paula Jones released court documents that alleged a pattern of sexual harassment by Clinton when he was Governor of Arkansas. Robert S. Bennett, Clinton's main lawyer for the case, called the filing \"a pack of lies\" and \"an organized campaign to smear the President of the United States\" funded by Clinton's political enemies.[311] In October 1998, Clinton's attorneys tentatively offered $700,000 to settle the case, which was then the $800,000 which Jones' lawyers sought.[312] Clinton later agreed to an out-of-court settlement and paid Jones $850,000.[313] Bennett said the president made the settlement only so he could end the lawsuit for good and move on with his life.[314] During the deposition for the Jones lawsuit, which was held at the White House,[315] Clinton denied having sexual relations with Monica Lewinsky—a denial that became the basis for an impeachment charge of perjury.[316] In 1998, Kathleen Willey alleged that Clinton had groped her in a hallway in 1993. An independent counsel determined Willey gave \"false information\" to the FBI, inconsistent with sworn testimony related to the Jones allegation.[317] On March 19, 1998, Julie Hiatt Steele, a friend of Willey, released an affidavit, accusing the former White House aide of asking her to lie to corroborate Ms. Willey's account of being sexually groped by Clinton in the Oval Office.[318] An attempt by Kenneth Starr to prosecute Steele for making false statements and obstructing justice ended in a mistrial and Starr declined to seek a retrial after Steele sought an investigation against the former independent counsel for prosecutorial misconduct.[319] Also in 1998, Juanita Broaddrick alleged that Clinton had raped her in the spring of 1978, although she said she did not remember the exact date.[320] To support her charge, Broaddrick notes that she told multiple witnesses in 1978 she had been raped by Clinton, something these witnesses also state in interviews to the press.[321] Broaddrick had earlier filed an affidavit denying any \"unwelcome sexual advances\" and later repeated the denial in a sworn deposition.[320] In a 1998 NBC interview wherein she detailed the alleged rape, Broaddrick said she had denied (under oath) being raped only to avoid testifying about the ordeal publicly.[320] The Lewinsky scandal has had an enduring impact on Clinton's legacy, beyond his impeachment in 1998.[322] In the wake of the #MeToo movement (which shed light on the widespread prevalence of sexual assault and harassment, especially in the workplace), various commentators and Democratic political leaders, as well as Lewinsky herself, have revisited their view that the Lewinsky affair was consensual, and instead characterized it as an abuse of power or harassment, in light of the power differential between a president and a 22-year-old intern. In 2018, Clinton was asked in several interviews about whether he should have resigned, and he said he had made the right decision in not resigning.[323] During the 2018 Congressional elections, The New York Times alleged that having no Democratic candidate for office asking Clinton to campaign with them was a change that attributed to the revised understanding of the Lewinsky scandal.[322] However, former DNC interim chair Donna Brazile previously urged Clinton in November 2017 to campaign during the 2018 midterm elections, in spite of New York U.S. senator Kirsten Gillibrand's recent criticism of the Lewinsky scandal.[324] Clinton admitted to having extramarital affairs with singer Gennifer Flowers and Monica Lewinsky.[325] Actress Elizabeth Gracen,[326] Miss Arkansas winner Sally Perdue,[327] and Dolly Kyle Browning[328] all claimed that they had affairs with Clinton during his time as governor of Arkansas. Browning later sued Clinton, Bruce Lindsey, Robert S. Bennett, and Jane Mayer, alleging they engaged in a conspiracy to attempt to block her from publishing a book loosely based on her relationship with Clinton and tried to defame him. However, Browning's lawsuit was dismissed.[329] In 2002, Clinton warned that pre-emptive military action against Iraq would have unwelcome consequences,[330][331] and later claimed to have opposed the Iraq War from the start (though some dispute this).[332] In 2005, Clinton criticized the Bush administration for its handling of emissions control, while speaking at the United Nations Climate Change conference in Montreal.[333] The William J. Clinton Presidential Center and Park in Little Rock, Arkansas, was dedicated in 2004.[334] Clinton released a best-selling autobiography, My Life, in 2004.[335] In 2007, he released Giving: How Each of Us Can Change the World, which also became a New York Times Best Seller and garnered positive reviews.[336] In the aftermath of the 2004 Asian tsunami, U.N. secretary-general Kofi Annan appointed Clinton to head a relief effort.[337] After Hurricane Katrina, Clinton joined with fellow former president George H. W. Bush to establish the Bush-Clinton Tsunami Fund in January 2005, and the Bush-Clinton Katrina Fund in October of that year.[338] As part of the tsunami effort, these two ex-presidents appeared in a Super Bowl XXXIX pre-game show,[339] and traveled to the affected areas.[340] They also spoke together at the funeral of Boris Yeltsin in April 2007.[341] Based on his philanthropic worldview,[342] Clinton created the William J. Clinton Foundation to address issues of global importance. This foundation includes the Clinton Foundation HIV and AIDS Initiative (CHAI), which strives to combat that disease, and has worked with the Australian government toward that end. The Clinton Global Initiative (CGI), begun by the Clinton Foundation in 2005, attempts to address world problems such as global public health, poverty alleviation and religious and ethnic conflict.[343] In 2005, Clinton announced through his foundation an agreement with manufacturers to stop selling sugary drinks in schools.[344] Clinton's foundation joined with the Large Cities Climate Leadership Group in 2006 to improve cooperation among those cities, and he met with foreign leaders to promote this initiative.[345] The foundation has received donations from many governments all over the world, including Asia and the Middle East.[346] In 2008, Foundation director Inder Singh announced deals to reduce the price of anti-malaria drugs by 30 percent in developing nations.[347] Clinton also spoke in favor of California Proposition 87 on alternative energy, which was voted down.[348] During the 2008 Democratic presidential primary campaign, Clinton vigorously advocated on behalf of his wife, Hillary. Through speaking engagements and fundraisers, he was able to raise $10 million toward her campaign.[349] Some worried that as an ex-president, he was too active on the trail, too negative to Clinton rival Barack Obama, and alienating his supporters at home and abroad.[350] Many were especially critical of him following his remarks in the South Carolina primary, which Obama won. Later in the 2008 primaries, there was some infighting between Bill and Hillary's staffs, especially in Pennsylvania.[351] Considering Bill's remarks, many thought he could not rally Hillary supporters behind Obama after Obama won the primary.[352] Such remarks led to apprehension that the party would be split to the detriment of Obama's election. Fears were allayed August 27, 2008, when Clinton enthusiastically endorsed Obama at the 2008 Democratic National Convention, saying all his experience as president assures him that Obama is \"ready to lead\".[353] After Hillary Clinton's presidential campaign was over, Bill Clinton continued to raise funds to help pay off her campaign debt.[354][355] In 2009, Clinton travelled to North Korea on behalf of two American journalists imprisoned there. Euna Lee and Laura Ling had been imprisoned for illegally entering the country from China.[356] Jimmy Carter had made a similar visit in 1994.[356] After Clinton met with North Korean leader Kim Jong-il, Kim issued a pardon.[357][358] Since then, Clinton has been assigned many other diplomatic missions. He was named United Nations Special Envoy to Haiti in 2009 following a series of hurricanes which caused $1 billion in damages.[359] Clinton organized a conference with the Inter-American Development Bank, where a new industrial park was discussed in an effort to \"build back better\".[360] In response to the 2010 Haiti earthquake, U.S. president Barack Obama announced that Clinton and George W. Bush would coordinate efforts to raise funds for Haiti's recovery.[361] Funds began pouring into Haiti, which led to funding becoming available for Caracol Industrial Park in a part of the country unaffected by the earthquake. While Hillary Clinton was in South Korea, she and Cheryl Mills worked to convince SAE-A, a large apparel subcontractor, to invest in Haiti despite the company's deep concerns about plans to raise the minimum wage. In the summer of 2010, the South Korean company signed a contract at the U.S. State Department, ensuring that the new industrial park would have a key tenant.[360] In 2010, Clinton announced support of, and delivered the keynote address for, the inauguration of NTR, Ireland's first environmental foundation.[362][363] At the 2012 Democratic National Convention, Clinton gave a widely praised speech nominating Barack Obama.[364] During the 2016 presidential election, Clinton again encouraged voters to support Hillary, and made appearances speaking on the campaign trail.[365] In a series of tweets, then-President-elect Donald Trump criticized his ability to get people out to vote.[366] Clinton served as a member of the electoral college for the state of New York. He voted for the Democratic ticket consisting of his wife Hillary and her running-mate Tim Kaine.[367] On September 7, 2017, Clinton partnered with former presidents Jimmy Carter, George H. W. Bush, George W. Bush, and Barack Obama to work with One America Appeal to help the victims of Hurricane Harvey and Hurricane Irma in the Gulf Coast and Texas communities.[368] In 2020, Clinton again served as a member of the United States Electoral College from New York, casting his vote for the successful Democratic ticket of Joe Biden and Kamala Harris.[369][370] Clinton was one of the first public figures to endorse Biden's re-election campaign in 2024, with him appearing in interviews and fundraisers with various politicians and national figures. He was also one of the most notable politicians to defend Biden after his critically maligned first presidential debate on June 27, with him stating that \"bad debate nights happen\" and continued to press support for him despite increasing demand from the public and Democratic party requesting for him to drop out.[371] After Biden withdrew his candidacy and vice president Harris replaced him on the ticket, both Bill and Hillary Clinton endorsed her and praised Biden for his work in public service. Clinton later gave a critically acclaimed speech at the 2024 DNC, where he emphasized the Democratic Party's record on job creation and Harris' career achievements as a prosecutor, Senator, and Vice President.[372] He later stumped for Harris at various battleground states, where he met with supporters in small towns and at campaign stops. At a stop in Michigan, Clinton caused a backlash by criticizing Arab and Muslim Americans hesitant to support Harris due to her pro-Israeli position, stating Israel had been \"forced\" to kill civilians during its war with Hamas.[373] His comments led the Institute for Middle East Understanding to state, \"Bill Clinton’s racist and ahistorical remarks were meant to justify the ethnic cleansing of Palestinians from their land. The Harris campaign is doing itself no favors attaching itself to that kind of hateful rhetoric\".[374] He expanded on his comments in an interview with CNN shortly after, stating that he was trying to appeal to both sides of the issue and highlighted his work with Arafat and Rabin in the Oslo Occords, although his response still received sharp condemnation from Muslim, Arab, and Palestinian-Americans.[375] After Harris lost the general election to Trump, Clinton's remarks were brought up by critics and pundits, who stated that they were the reason why Harris lost support among Arab-American voters and why she fared poorly in the Muslim-populated cities of Dearborn and Hamtramck when compared to previous Democratic candidates.[376] Critics also questioned his relevance to the modern Democratic Party, with pundits stating that his centrist policies and promotion of candidates who align with his views no longer work with a party that has tried to rebrand itself after losing support amongst progressive and populist supporters.[377] After the election, he and Hillary released a statement congratulating president-elect Trump and vice-president-elect JD Vance, while stating that Harris and her running-mate Tim Walz ran a \"positive, forward-looking campaign to be proud of.\"[378] Clinton's second volume of memoirs, Citizen: My Life After the White House, was published in November 2024.[379][380][381][382][383][384] In September 2004, Clinton underwent quadruple bypass surgery.[385] In March 2005, he again underwent surgery, this time for a partially collapsed lung.[386] On February 11, 2010, he was rushed to New York-Presbyterian/Columbia Hospital in Manhattan after complaining of chest pains, and he had two coronary stents implanted in his heart.[385][387] After this procedure, Clinton adopted a plant-based whole foods (vegan) diet, which had been recommended by doctors Dean Ornish and Caldwell Esselstyn.[388] He has since incorporated fish and lean animal flesh at the suggestion of Mark Hyman, a proponent of the pseudoscientific ethos of functional medicine.[389] As a result, he is no longer a strict vegan.[390] In October 2021, Clinton was treated for sepsis at the University of California, Irvine Medical Center.[391][392] In December 2022, Clinton tested positive for COVID-19.[393] In December 2024, Clinton was hospitalized after developing fever at the MedStar Georgetown University Hospital in Washington D.C..[394] The Clintons incurred several million dollars in legal bills during his presidency, which were paid off four years after he left office.[395] Bill and Hillary Clinton have each earned millions of dollars from book publishing.[396] In 2016, Forbes reported Bill and Hillary Clinton made about $240 million in the 15 years from January 2001, to December 2015, (mostly from paid speeches, business consulting and book-writing).[397] Also in 2016, CNN reported the Clintons combined to receive more than $153 million in paid speeches from 2001 until spring 2015.[398] In May 2015, The Hill reported that Bill and Hillary Clinton have made more than $25 million in speaking fees since the start of 2014, and that Hillary Clinton also made $5 million or more from her book, Hard Choices, during the same time period.[399] In July 2014, The Wall Street Journal reported that at the end of 2012, the Clintons were worth between $5 million and $25.5 million, and that in 2012 (the last year they were required to disclose the information) the Clintons made between $16 and $17 million, mostly from speaking fees earned by the former president.[400] Clinton earned more than $104 million from paid speeches between 2001 and 2012.[401] In June 2014, ABC News and The Washington Post reported that Bill Clinton has made more than $100 million giving paid speeches since leaving public office, and in 2008, The New York Times reported that the Clintons' income tax returns[402] show they made $109 million in the eight years from January 1, 2000, to December 31, 2007, including almost $92 million from his speaking and book-writing.[396][403][404][405] Bill Clinton has given dozens of paid speeches each year since leaving office in 2001, mostly to corporations and philanthropic groups in North America and Europe; he often earned $100,000 to $300,000 per speech.[398][406][407][408] Russian investment bank with ties to the Kremlin paid Clinton $500,000 for a speech in Moscow.[409][410] Hillary Clinton said she and Bill came out of the White House financially \"broke\" and in debt, especially due to large legal fees incurred during their years in the White House. \"We had no money when we got there, and we struggled to, you know, piece together the resources for mortgages, for houses, for Chelsea's education\". She added, \"Bill has worked really hard ... we had to pay off all our debts ... he had to make double the money because of, obviously, taxes; and then pay off the debts, and get us houses, and take care of family members\".[404] In the early 2000s, Clinton took flights on Jeffrey Epstein's private jet in connection with Clinton Foundation work.[411][412] According to Epstein's attorney Gerald B. Lefcourt, Epstein was \"part of the original group that conceived of the Clinton Global Initiative\".[413] In 2002, a spokesperson for Clinton praised Epstein as \"a committed philanthropist\" with \"insights and generosity\".[414] While Clinton was president, Epstein visited the White House at least 17 times between 1993 and 1995.[415][416] Years later, Epstein was convicted on sex trafficking charges. Clinton's office released a statement in 2019 saying, \"President Clinton knows nothing about the terrible crimes Jeffrey Epstein pleaded guilty to in Florida some years ago, or those with which he has been recently charged in New York. In 2002 and 2003, President Clinton took four trips on Jeffrey Epstein's airplane: one to Europe, one to Asia, and two to Africa, which included stops in connection with the work of the Clinton Foundation. Staff, supporters of the Foundation, and his Secret Service detail traveled on every leg of every trip. [...] He's not spoken to Epstein in well over a decade.\"[411][417][418] However, later reports showed that Clinton had flown on Epstein's plane 26 times.[419] In another statement Clinton said \"one meeting with Epstein in his Harlem office in 2002, and around the same time made one brief visit to Epstein's New York apartment with a staff member and his security detail\". In July 2019 it was reported that Clinton attended a dinner with Epstein in 1995, a meeting with Epstein that Clinton had not previously disclosed.[420] Clinton reportedly used Epstein's private jet to visit Little St. James Island, where Epstein resided,[421] on multiple occasions between 2002 and 2005.[422] Virginia Roberts, later known as Virginia Giuffre, says in a lawsuit that while working at Donald Trump's Mar-a-Lago resort[423] she was lured into a sex-trafficking ring run by Epstein and while traveling with Epstein she saw Clinton on the island.[424] In a 2011 conversation with her lawyers, Roberts stated that Clinton traveled to Epstein's retreat on Little St. James in 2002.[425] According to Roberts, Epstein told her that Clinton \"owes me favors\" when she asked what he was doing there.[426] She also reportedly claimed that Epstein and Clinton had dined in the presence of two girls aged approximately seventeen whom she believed Epstein had invited to have sex with Clinton, but that Clinton showed no interest in them.[427] A Freedom of Information Act request for United States Secret Service records of visits Clinton may have made to Little St. James produced no such evidence.[424] According to Epstein's flight logs, Clinton never flew near the U.S. Virgin Islands.[425] In July 2019, a Clinton spokesperson issued a statement saying Clinton never visited the island.[428][429] When he was personally asked by a journalist about his ties with Epstein in a rally in Laredo, Texas in November 2022, Clinton said \"I think the evidence is clear\".[430] According to former Clinton aide, Doug Band, Clinton visited Epstein's island in January 2003.[431][432] In 2024, unsealed court documents revealed allegations that Clinton had visited the offices of Vanity Fair and 'threatened' the paper not to print stories about Epstein's sexual trafficking. Former Vanity Fair editor Graydon Carter denied the incident ever took place.[433][434] At the age of 10, he was baptized at Park Place Baptist Church in Hot Springs, Arkansas.[435] When he became president in 1993, he became a member of Foundry United Methodist Church in Washington, D.C. with his wife, a Methodist.[436] On October 11, 1975, in Fayetteville, Arkansas, he married Hillary Rodham, whom he met while studying at Yale University. They had Chelsea Clinton, their only child, on February 27, 1980.[437] He is the maternal grandfather to Chelsea's three children.[438] In December 2024, Clinton was admitted to the MedStar Georgetown University Hospital where he underwent testing and observation after developing a fever.[439] Various colleges and universities have awarded Clinton honorary degrees, including Doctorate of Law degrees[440][441] and Doctor of Humane Letters degrees.[442] He received an honorary degree from Georgetown University, his alma mater, and was the commencement speaker in 1980.[443] He is an honorary fellow of University College, Oxford, which he attended as a Rhodes Scholar, although he did not complete his studies there.[444][445] Schools have been named for Clinton,[446][447][448] and statues have been built to pay him homage.[449][450] U.S. states where he has been honored include Missouri,[451] Arkansas,[452] Kentucky,[453] and New York.[454] He was presented with the Medal for Distinguished Public Service by Secretary of Defense William Cohen in 2001.[455] The Clinton Presidential Center was opened in Little Rock, Arkansas, in his honor on December 5, 2001.[456] Clinton has been honored in various other ways, in countries that include the Czech Republic,[457][458] Papua New Guinea,[459] Germany,[460] and Kosovo.[449] The Republic of Kosovo, in gratitude for his help during the Kosovo War, renamed a major street in the capital city of Pristina as Bill Clinton Boulevard and added a monumental Clinton statue.[461][462][463] Clinton was selected as Time's \"Man of the Year\" in 1992,[464] and again in 1998, along with Ken Starr.[465] From a poll conducted of the American people in December 1999, Clinton was among eighteen included in Gallup's List of Most Widely Admired People of the 20th Century.[466] In 2001, Clinton received the NAACP's President's Award.[467] He has also been honored with a J. William Fulbright Prize for International Understanding,[468] a TED Prize (named for the confluence of technology, entertainment and design),[469] and was named as an Honorary GLAAD Media Award recipient for his work as an advocate for the LGBT community.[470] Clinton, along with Mikhail Gorbachev and Sophia Loren,[471] received the 2003 Grammy Award for Best Spoken Word Album for Children for Wolf Tracks and Peter and the Wolf.[472][473] The audiobook edition of his autobiography, My Life, read by Clinton himself, won the 2005 Grammy Award for Best Spoken Word Album,[472] as well as the Audie Award as the Audiobook of the Year.[474] Clinton has two more Grammy nominations for his audiobooks: Giving: How Each of Us Can Change the World in 2007 and Back to Work in 2012.[472] In 2011, Haitian president Michel Martelly awarded Clinton with the National Order of Honour and Merit to the rank of Grand Cross \"for his various initiatives in Haiti and especially his high contribution to the reconstruction of the country after the earthquake of January 12, 2010\". Clinton declared at the ceremony that \"in the United States of America, I really don't believe former American presidents need awards anymore, but I am very honored by this one, I love Haiti, and I believe in its promise\".[475] President Obama awarded Clinton the Presidential Medal of Freedom on November 20, 2013.[476]",

Bill Clinton is an American politician from Arkansas who served as the 42nd President of the United States (1993-2001). He took office at the end of the Cold War, and was the first baby-boomer generation President. During the administration of William Jefferson Clinton, the U.S. enjoyed more peace and economic well being than at any time in its history. He was the first Democratic president since Franklin D. Roosevelt to win a second term. He could point to the lowest unemployment rate in modern times, the lowest inflation in 30 years, the highest home ownership in the country’s history, dropping crime rates in many places, and reduced welfare rolls. He proposed the first balanced budget in decades and achieved a budget surplus. As part of a plan to celebrate the millennium in 2000, Clinton called for a great national initiative to end racial discrimination. After the failure in his second year of a huge program of health care reform, Clinton shifted emphasis, declaring “the era of big government is over.” He sought legislation to upgrade education, to protect jobs of parents who must care for sick children, to restrict handgun sales, and to strengthen environmental rules. President Clinton was born William Jefferson Blythe III on August 19, 1946, in Hope, Arkansas, three months after his father died in a traffic accident. When he was four years old, his mother wed Roger Clinton, of Hot Springs, Arkansas. In high school, he took the family name. He excelled as a student and as a saxophone player and once considered becoming a professional musician. As a delegate to Boys Nation while in high school, he met President John Kennedy in the White House Rose Garden. The encounter led him to enter a life of public service. Clinton graduated from Georgetown University and in 1968 won a Rhodes Scholarship to Oxford University. He received a law degree from Yale University in 1973, and entered politics in Arkansas. He was defeated in his campaign for Congress in Arkansas’s Third District in 1974. The next year he married Hillary Rodham, a graduate of Wellesley College and Yale Law School. In 1980, Chelsea, their only child, was born. Clinton was elected Arkansas Attorney General in 1976, and won the governorship in 1978. After losing a bid for a second term, he regained the office four years later, and served until he defeated incumbent George Bush and third party candidate Ross Perot in the 1992 presidential race. Clinton and his running mate, Tennessee’s Senator Albert Gore Jr., then 44, represented a new generation in American political leadership. For the first time in 12 years both the White House and Congress were held by the same party. But that political edge was brief; the Republicans won both houses of Congress in 1994. In 1998, as a result of issues surrounding personal indiscretions with a young woman White House intern, Clinton was the second U.S. president to be impeached by the House of Representatives. He was tried in the Senate and found not guilty of the charges brought against him. He apologized to the nation for his actions and continued to have unprecedented popular approval ratings for his job as president. In the world, he successfully dispatched peace keeping forces to war-torn Bosnia and bombed Iraq when Saddam Hussein stopped United Nations inspections for evidence of nuclear, chemical, and biological weapons. He became a global proponent for an expanded NATO, more open international trade, and a worldwide campaign against drug trafficking. He drew huge crowds when he traveled through South America, Europe, Russia, Africa, and China, advocating U.S. style freedom. Learn more about William J. Clinton’s spouse, Hillary Rodham Clinton.

The interrelationships of ethnicity, language and culture in the Celtic world are unclear and debated;[8] for example over the ways in which the Iron Age people of Britain and Ireland should be called Celts.[5][8][9][10] In current scholarship, 'Celt' primarily refers to 'speakers of Celtic languages' rather than to a single ethnic group.[11] The history of pre-Celtic Europe and Celtic origins is debated. The traditional \"Celtic from the East\" theory, says the proto-Celtic language arose in the late Bronze Age Urnfield culture of central Europe, named after grave sites in southern Germany,[12][13] which flourished from around 1200 BC.[14] This theory links the Celts with the Iron Age Hallstatt culture which followed it (c. 1200–500 BC), named for the rich grave finds in Hallstatt, Austria,[14][15] and with the following La Tène culture (c. 450 BC onward), named after the La Tène site in Switzerland. It proposes that Celtic culture spread westward and southward from these areas by diffusion or migration.[16] A newer theory, \"Celtic from the West\", suggests proto-Celtic arose earlier, was a lingua franca in the Atlantic Bronze Age coastal zone, and spread eastward.[17] Another newer theory, \"Celtic from the Centre\", suggests proto-Celtic arose between these two zones, in Bronze Age Gaul, then spread in various directions.[11] After the Celtic settlement of Southeast Europe in the 3rd century BC, Celtic culture reached as far east as central Anatolia, Turkey. The earliest undisputed examples of Celtic language are the Lepontic inscriptions from the 6th century BC.[18] Continental Celtic languages are attested almost exclusively through inscriptions and place-names. Insular Celtic languages are attested from the 4th century AD in Ogham inscriptions, though they were being spoken much earlier. Celtic literary tradition begins with Old Irish texts around the 8th century AD. Elements of Celtic mythology are recorded in early Irish and early Welsh literature. Most written evidence of the early Celts comes from Greco-Roman writers, who often grouped the Celts as barbarian tribes. They followed an ancient Celtic religion overseen by druids. The Celts were often in conflict with the Romans, such as in the Roman–Gallic wars, the Celtiberian Wars, the conquest of Gaul and conquest of Britain. By the 1st century AD, most Celtic territories had become part of the Roman Empire. By c. 500, due to Romanisation and the migration of Germanic tribes, Celtic culture had mostly become restricted to Ireland, western and northern Britain, and Brittany. Between the 5th and 8th centuries, the Celtic-speaking communities in these Atlantic regions emerged as a reasonably cohesive cultural entity. They had a common linguistic, religious and artistic heritage that distinguished them from surrounding cultures.[19] Insular Celtic culture diversified into that of the Gaels (Irish, Scots and Manx) and the Celtic Britons (Welsh, Cornish, and Bretons) of the medieval and modern periods.[2][20][21] A modern Celtic identity[22] was constructed as part of the Romanticist Celtic Revival in Britain, Ireland, and other European territories such as Galicia.[23] Today, Irish, Scottish Gaelic, Welsh, and Breton are still spoken in parts of their former territories, while Cornish and Manx are undergoing a revival. The first recorded use of the name 'Celts' – as Κελτοί (Keltoi) in Ancient Greek – was by Greek geographer Hecataeus of Miletus in 517 BC,[24] when writing about a people living near Massilia (modern Marseille), southern Gaul.[25] In the fifth century BC, Herodotus referred to Keltoi living around the source of the Danube and in the far west of Europe.[26] The etymology of Keltoi is unclear. Possible roots include Indo-European *kʲel 'to hide' (seen also in Old Irish ceilid, and Modern Welsh celu), *kʲel 'to heat' or *kel 'to impel'.[27] It may come from the Celtic language. Linguist Kim McCone supports this view and notes that Celt- is found in the names of several ancient Gauls such as Celtillus, father of Vercingetorix. He suggests it meant the people or descendants of \"the hidden one\", noting the Gauls claimed descent from an underworld god (according to Commentarii de Bello Gallico), and linking it with the Germanic Hel.[28] Others view it as a name coined by Greeks; among them linguist Patrizia de Bernardo Stempel, who suggests it meant \"the tall ones\".[29] In the first century BC, Roman leader Julius Caesar reported that the Gauls called themselves 'Celts', Latin: Celtae, in their own tongue.[30] Thus whether it was given to them by others or not, it was used by the Celts themselves. Greek geographer Strabo, writing about Gaul towards the end of the first century BC, refers to the \"race which is now called both Gallic and Galatic\", though he also uses Celtica as another name for Gaul. He reports Celtic peoples in Iberia too, calling them Celtiberi and Celtici.[31] Pliny the Elder noted the use of Celtici in Lusitania as a tribal surname,[32] which epigraphic findings have confirmed.[33][34] A Latin name for the Gauls, Galli (pl.), may come from a Celtic ethnic name, perhaps borrowed into Latin during the Celtic expansion into Italy from the early fifth century BC. Its root may be Proto-Celtic *galno, meaning \"power, strength\" (whence Old Irish gal \"boldness, ferocity\", Welsh gallu \"to be able, power\"). The Greek name Γαλάται (Galatai, Latinized Galatae) most likely has the same origin, referring to the Gauls who invaded southeast Europe and settled in Galatia.[35] The suffix -atai might be a Greek inflection.[36] Linguist Kim McCone suggests it comes from Proto-Celtic *galatis (\"ferocious, furious\"), and was not originally an ethnic name but a name for young warrior bands. He says \"If the Gauls' initial impact on the Mediterranean world was primarily a military one typically involving fierce young *galatīs, it would have been natural for the Greeks to apply this name for the type of Keltoi that they usually encountered\".[28] Because Classical writers did not call the inhabitants of Britain and Ireland Κελτοί (Keltoi) or Celtae,[5][8][9] some scholars prefer not to use the term for the Iron Age inhabitants of those islands.[5][8][9][10] However, they spoke Celtic languages, shared other cultural traits, and Roman historian Tacitus says the Britons resembled the Gauls in customs and religion.[11] For at least 1,000 years the name Celt was not used at all, and nobody called themselves Celts or Celtic, until from about 1700, after the word 'Celtic' was rediscovered in classical texts, it was applied for the first time to the distinctive culture, history, traditions, language of the modern Celtic nations – Ireland, Scotland, Wales, Cornwall, Brittany, and the Isle of Man.[37] 'Celt' is a modern English word, first attested in 1707 in the writing of Edward Lhuyd, whose work, along with that of other late 17th-century scholars, brought academic attention to the languages and history of the early Celtic inhabitants of Great Britain.[38] The English words Gaul, Gauls (pl.) and Gaulish (first recorded in the 16–17th centuries) come from French Gaule and Gaulois, a borrowing from Frankish *Walholant, 'Roman-land' (see Gaul: Name), the root of which is Proto-Germanic *walha-, 'foreigner, Roman, Celt', whence the English word Welsh (Old English wælisċ). Proto-Germanic *walha comes from the name of the Volcae,[39] a Celtic tribe who lived first in southern Germany and central Europe, then migrated to Gaul.[40] This means that English Gaul, despite its superficial similarity, is not actually derived from Latin Gallia (which should have produced *Jaille in French),[citation needed] though it does refer to the same ancient region. Celtic refers to a language family and, more generally, means 'of the Celts' or 'in the style of the Celts'. Several archaeological cultures are considered Celtic, based on unique sets of artefacts. The link between language and artefact is aided by the presence of inscriptions.[41] The modern idea of a Celtic cultural identity or \"Celticity\" focuses on similarities among languages, works of art, and classical texts,[42] and sometimes also among material artefacts, social organisation, homeland and mythology.[43] Earlier theories held that these similarities suggest a common \"racial\" (race is now a contested concept) origin for the various Celtic peoples, but more recent theories hold that they reflect a common cultural and linguistic heritage more than a genetic one. Celtic cultures seem to have been diverse, with the use of a Celtic language being the main thing they had in common.[5] Today, the term 'Celtic' generally refers to the languages and cultures of Ireland, Scotland, Wales, Cornwall, the Isle of Man, and Brittany; also called the Celtic nations. These are the regions where Celtic languages are still spoken to some extent. The four are Irish, Scottish Gaelic, Welsh, and Breton; plus two recent revivals, Cornish (a Brittonic language) and Manx (a Goidelic language). There are also attempts to reconstruct Cumbric, a Brittonic language of northern Britain. Celtic regions of mainland Europe are those whose residents claim a Celtic heritage, but where no Celtic language survives; these include western Iberia, i.e. Portugal and north-central Spain (Galicia, Asturias, Cantabria, Castile and León, Extremadura).[44] Continental Celts are the Celtic-speaking people of mainland Europe and Insular Celts are the Celtic-speaking people of the British and Irish islands, and their descendants. The Celts of Brittany derive their language from migrating Insular Celts from Britain and so are grouped accordingly.[45] The Celtic languages are a branch of the Indo-European languages. By the time Celts are first mentioned in written records around 400 BC, they were already split into several language groups, and spread over much of western mainland Europe, the Iberian Peninsula, Ireland and Britain. The languages developed into Celtiberian, Goidelic and Brittonic branches, among others.[46][47] The mainstream view during most of the twentieth century is that the Celts and the proto-Celtic language arose out of the Urnfield culture of central Europe around 1000 BC, spreading westward and southward over the following few hundred years.[14][48][49][50] The Urnfield culture was preeminent in central Europe during the late Bronze Age, circa 1200 BC to 700 BC. The spread of iron-working led to the Hallstatt culture (c. 800 to 500 BC) developing out of the Urnfield culture in a wide region north of the Alps. The Hallstatt culture developed into the La Tène culture from about 450 BC, which came to be identified with Celtic art.[citation needed] In 1846, Johann Georg Ramsauer unearthed an ancient grave field with distinctive grave goods at Hallstatt, Austria. Because the burials \"dated to roughly the time when Celts are mentioned near the Danube by Herodotus, Ramsauer concluded that the graves were Celtic\".[51] Similar sites and artifacts were found over a wide area, which were named the 'Hallstatt culture'. In 1857, the archaeological site of La Tène was discovered in Switzerland.[51] The huge collection of artifacts had a distinctive style. Artifacts of this 'La Tène style' were found elsewhere in Europe, \"particularly in places where people called Celts were known to have lived and early Celtic languages are attested. As a result, these items quickly became associated with the Celts, so much so that by the 1870s scholars began to regard finds of the La Tène as 'the archaeological expression of the Celts'\".[51] This cultural network was overrun by the Roman Empire, though traces of La Tène style were still seen in Gallo-Roman artifacts. In Britain and Ireland, the La Tène style survived precariously to re-emerge in Insular art.[citation needed] The Urnfield-Hallstatt theory began to be challenged in the latter 20th century, when it was accepted that the oldest known Celtic-language inscriptions were those of Lepontic from the 6th century BC and Celtiberian from the 2nd century BC. These were found in northern Italy and Iberia, neither of which were part of the 'Hallstatt' nor 'La Tène' cultures at the time.[11] The Urnfield-Hallstatt theory was partly based on ancient Greco-Roman writings, such as the Histories of Herodotus, which placed the Celts at the source of the Danube. However, Stephen Oppenheimer shows that Herodotus seemed to believe the Danube rose near the Pyrenees, which would place the Ancient Celts in a region which is more in agreement with later classical writers and historians (i.e. in Gaul and Iberia).[52] The theory was also partly based on the abundance of inscriptions bearing Celtic personal names in the Eastern Hallstatt region (Noricum). However, Patrick Sims-Williams notes that these date to the later Roman era, and says they suggest \"relatively late settlement by a Celtic-speaking elite\".[11] In the late 20th century, the Urnfield-Hallstatt theory began to fall out of favour with some scholars, which was influenced by new archaeological finds. 'Celtic' began to refer primarily to 'speakers of Celtic languages' rather than to a single culture or ethnic group.[11] A new theory suggested that Celtic languages arose earlier, along the Atlantic coast (including Britain, Ireland, Armorica and Iberia), long before evidence of 'Celtic' culture is found in archaeology. Myles Dillon and Nora Kershaw Chadwick argued that \"Celtic settlement of the British Isles\" might date to the Bell Beaker culture of the Copper and Bronze Age (from c. 2750 BC).[53][54] Martín Almagro Gorbea (2001) also proposed that Celtic arose in the 3rd millennium BC, suggesting that the spread of the Bell Beaker culture explained the wide dispersion of the Celts throughout western Europe, as well as the variability of the Celtic peoples.[55] Using a multidisciplinary approach, Alberto J. Lorrio and Gonzalo Ruiz Zapatero reviewed and built on Almagro Gorbea's work to present a model for the origin of Celtic archaeological groups in Iberia and proposing a rethinking of the meaning of \"Celtic\".[56] John T. Koch[57] and Barry Cunliffe[58] have developed this 'Celtic from the West' theory. It proposes that the proto-Celtic language arose along the Atlantic coast and was the lingua franca of the Atlantic Bronze Age cultural network, later spreading inland and eastward.[11] More recently, Cunliffe proposes that proto-Celtic had arisen in the Atlantic zone even earlier, by 3000 BC, and spread eastwards with the Bell Beaker culture over the following millennium. His theory is partly based on glottochronology, the spread of ancient Celtic-looking placenames, and thesis that the Tartessian language was Celtic.[11] However, the proposal that Tartessian was Celtic is widely rejected by linguists, many of whom regard it as unclassified.[59][60] Celticist Patrick Sims-Williams (2020) notes that in current scholarship, 'Celt' is primarily a linguistic label. In his 'Celtic from the Centre' theory, he argues that the proto-Celtic language did not originate in central Europe nor the Atlantic, but in-between these two regions. He suggests that it \"emerged as a distinct Indo-European dialect around the second millennium BC, probably somewhere in Gaul [centered in modern France] ... whence it spread in various directions and at various speeds in the first millennium BC\". Sims-Williams says this avoids the problematic idea \"that Celtic was spoken over a vast area for a very long time yet somehow avoided major dialectal splits\", and \"it keeps Celtic fairly close to Italy, which suits the view that Italic and Celtic were in some way linked\".[11] The Proto-Celtic language is usually dated to the Late Bronze Age.[14] The earliest records of a Celtic language are the Lepontic inscriptions of Cisalpine Gaul (Northern Italy), the oldest of which pre-date the La Tène period. Other early inscriptions, appearing from the early La Tène period in the area of Massilia, are in Gaulish, which was written in the Greek alphabet until the Roman conquest. Celtiberian inscriptions, using their own Iberian script, appear later, after about 200 BC. Evidence of Insular Celtic is available only from about 400 AD, in the form of Primitive Irish Ogham inscriptions.[citation needed] Besides epigraphic evidence, an important source of information on early Celtic is toponymy (place names).[61] Arnaiz-Villena et al. (2017) demonstrated that Celtic-related populations of the European Atlantic (Orkney Islands, Scottish, Irish, British, Bretons, Basques, Galicians) shared a common HLA system.[clarification needed][62] Other genetic research does not support the notion of a significant genetic link between these populations, beyond the fact that they are all West Europeans. Early European Farmers did settle Britain (and all of Northern Europe) in the Neolithic; however, recent genetics research has found that, between 2400 and 2000 BC, over 90% of British DNA was overturned by European Steppe Herders in a migration that brought large amounts of Steppe DNA (including the R1b haplogroup) to western Europe.[63] Modern autosomal genetic clustering is testament to this fact, as both modern and Iron Age British and Irish samples cluster genetically very closely with other North Europeans, and less so with Galicians, Basques or those from the south of France.[64][65] The concept that the Hallstatt and La Tène cultures could be seen not just as chronological periods but as \"Culture Groups\", entities composed of people of the same ethnicity and language, had started to grow by the end of the 19th century. At the beginning of the 20th century the belief that these \"Culture Groups\" could be thought of in racial or ethnic terms was held by Gordon Childe, whose theory was influenced by the writings of Gustaf Kossinna.[66] As the 20th century progressed, the ethnic interpretation of La Tène culture became more strongly rooted, and any findings of La Tène culture and flat inhumation cemeteries were linked to the Celts and the Celtic language.[67] In various[clarification needed] academic disciplines the Celts were considered a Central European Iron Age phenomenon, through the cultures of Hallstatt and La Tène. However, archaeological finds from the Halstatt and La Tène culture were rare in Iberia, southwestern France, northern and western Britain, southern Ireland and Galatia[68][69] and did not provide enough evidence for a culture like that of Central Europe. It is equally difficult to maintain that the origin of the Iberian Celts can be linked to the preceding Urnfield culture. This has resulted in a newer theory that introduces a 'proto-Celtic' substratum and a process of Celticisation, having its initial roots in the Bronze Age Bell Beaker culture.[70] The La Tène culture developed and flourished during the late Iron Age (from 450 BC to the Roman conquest in the 1st century BC) in eastern France, Switzerland, Austria, southwest Germany, the Czech Republic, Slovakia and Hungary. It developed out of the Hallstatt culture without any definite cultural break, under the impetus of considerable Mediterranean influence from Greek, and later Etruscan civilisations. A shift of settlement centres took place in the 4th century. The western La Tène culture corresponds to historical Celtic Gaul. Whether this means that the whole of La Tène culture can be attributed to a unified Celtic people is difficult to assess; archaeologists have repeatedly concluded that language and material culture do not necessarily run parallel. Frey notes that in the 5th century, \"burial customs in the Celtic world were not uniform; rather, localised groups had their own beliefs, which, in consequence, also gave rise to distinct artistic expressions\".[71] Thus, while the La Tène culture is certainly associated with the Gauls, the presence of La Tène artefacts may be due to cultural contact and does not imply the permanent presence of Celtic speakers.[citation needed] The Greek historian Ephorus of Cyme in Asia Minor, writing in the 4th century BC, believed the Celts came from the islands off the mouth of the Rhine and were \"driven from their homes by the frequency of wars and the violent rising of the sea\". Polybius published a history of Rome about 150 BC in which he describes the Gauls of Italy and their conflict with Rome. Pausanias in the 2nd century AD says that the Gauls \"originally called Celts\", \"live on the remotest region of Europe on the coast of an enormous tidal sea\". Posidonius described the southern Gauls about 100 BC. Though his original work is lost, later writers such as Strabo used it. The latter, writing in the early 1st century AD, deals with Britain and Gaul as well as Hispania, Italy, and Galatia. Caesar wrote extensively about his Gallic Wars in 58–51 BC. Diodorus Siculus wrote about the Celts of Gaul and Britain in his 1st-century history.[citation needed] Diodorus Siculus and Strabo both suggest that the heartland of the people they call Celts was in southern Gaul. The former says that the Gauls were to the north of the Celts, but that the Romans referred to both as Gauls (linguistically the Gauls were certainly Celts). Before the discoveries at Hallstatt and La Tène, it was generally considered that the Celtic heartland was southern Gaul, see Encyclopædia Britannica for 1813.[citation needed] The Romans knew the Celts then living in present-day France as Gauls. The territory of these peoples probably included the Low Countries, the Alps and present-day northern Italy. Julius Caesar in his Gallic Wars described the 1st-century BC descendants of those Gauls.[citation needed] Eastern Gaul became the centre of the western La Tène culture. In later Iron Age Gaul, the social organisation resembled that of the Romans, with large towns. From the 3rd century BC the Gauls adopted coinage. Texts with Greek characters from southern Gaul have survived from the 2nd century BC.[72] Greek traders founded Massalia about 600 BC, with some objects (mostly drinking ceramic vessels) being traded up the Rhône valley. But trade became disrupted soon after 500 BC and re-oriented over the Alps to the Po valley in the Italian peninsula. The Romans arrived in the Rhone valley in the 2nd century BC and encountered a mostly Celtic-speaking Gaul. Rome wanted land communications with its Iberian provinces and fought a major battle with the Saluvii at Entremont in 124–123 BC. Gradually Roman control extended, and the Roman province of Gallia Transalpina developed along the Mediterranean coast.[73][74] The Romans knew the remainder of Gaul as Gallia Comata, 'Long-haired Gaul'.[75] In 58 BC, the Helvetii planned to migrate westward but Julius Caesar forced them back. He then became involved in fighting the various tribes in Gaul, and by 55 BC had overrun most of Gaul. In 52 BC, Vercingetorix led a revolt against Roman occupation but was defeated at the Battle of Alesia and surrendered.[76] Following the Gallic Wars of 58–51 BC, Caesar's Celtica formed the main part of Roman Gaul, becoming the province of Gallia Lugdunensis. This territory of the Celtic tribes was bounded on the south by the Garonne and on the north by the Seine and the Marne.[77] The Romans attached large swathes of this region to neighbouring provinces Belgica and Aquitania, particularly under Augustus.[78] Place- and personal-name analysis and inscriptions suggest that Gaulish was spoken over most of what is now France.[79][80] Until the end of the 19th century, traditional scholarship dealing with the Celts did acknowledge their presence in the Iberian Peninsula[81][82] as a material culture relatable to the Hallstatt and La Tène cultures. However, since according to the definition of the Iron Age in the 19th century Celtic populations were supposedly rare in Iberia and did not provide a cultural scenario that could easily be linked to that of Central Europe, the presence of Celtic culture in that region was generally not fully recognised. Modern scholarship, however, has proven that Celtic presence and influences were most substantial in what is today Spain and Portugal (with perhaps the highest settlement saturation in Western Europe), particularly in the central, western and northern regions.[83][84] In addition to Gauls infiltrating from the north of the Pyrenees, the Roman and Greek sources mention Celtic populations in three parts of the Iberian Peninsula: the eastern part of the Meseta (inhabited by the Celtiberians), the southwest (Celtici, in modern-day Alentejo) and the northwest (Gallaecia and Asturias).[85] A modern scholarly review[86] found several archaeological groups of Celts in Spain: The origins of the Celtiberians might provide a key to understanding the Celticisation process in the rest of the Peninsula. The process of Celticisation of the southwestern area of the peninsula by the Keltoi and of the northwestern area is, however, not a simple Celtiberian question. Recent investigations about the Callaici[91] and Bracari[92] in northwestern Portugal are providing new approaches to understanding Celtic culture (language, art and religion) in western Iberia.[93] John T. Koch of Aberystwyth University suggested that Tartessian inscriptions of the 8th century BC might be classified as Celtic. This would mean that Tartessian is the earliest attested trace of Celtic by a margin of more than a century.[94] In Germany by the late Bronze Age, the Urnfield culture (c. 1300 BC – c. 750 BC) had replaced the Bell Beaker, Unetice and Tumulus cultures in central Europe,[97] whilst the Nordic Bronze Age had developed in Scandinavia and northern Germany. The Hallstatt culture, which had developed from the Urnfield culture, was the predominant Western and Central European culture from the 12th to 8th centuries BC and during the early Iron Age (8th to 6th centuries BC). It was followed by the La Tène culture (5th to 1st centuries BC). The people who had adopted these cultural characteristics in central and southern Germany are regarded as Celts. Celtic cultural centres developed in central Europe during the late Bronze Age (c. 1200 BC until 700 BC). Some, like the Heuneburg, the oldest city north of the Alps,[98] grew to become important cultural centres of the Iron Age in Central Europe, that maintained trade routes to the Mediterranean. In the 5th century BC the Greek historian Herodotus mentioned a Celtic city at the Danube – Pyrene, that historians attribute to the Heuneburg. Beginning around 700 BC (or later), Germanic peoples (Germanic tribes) from southern Scandinavia and northern Germany expanded south and gradually replaced the Celtic peoples in Central Europe.[99][100][101][102][103][104] The Canegrate culture represented the first migratory wave of the proto-Celtic[105][106] population from the northwest part of the Alps that, through the Alpine passes, had already penetrated and settled in the western Po valley between Lake Maggiore and Lake Como (Scamozzina culture). It has also been proposed that a more ancient proto-Celtic presence can be traced back to the beginning of the Middle Bronze Age, when North Westwern Italy appears closely linked regarding the production of bronze artefacts, including ornaments, to the western groups of the Tumulus culture.[107] La Tène cultural material appeared over a large area of mainland Italy,[108] the southernmost example being the Celtic helmet from Canosa di Puglia.[109] Italy is home to Lepontic, the oldest attested Celtic language (from the 6th century BC).[110] Anciently spoken in Switzerland and in Northern-Central Italy, from the Alps to Umbria.[111][112][113][114] According to the Recueil des Inscriptions Gauloises, more than 760 Gaulish inscriptions have been found throughout present-day France – with the notable exception of Aquitaine – and in Italy,[115][116] which testifies the importance of Celtic heritage in the peninsula.[citation needed] In 391 BC, Celts \"who had their homes beyond the Alps streamed through the passes in great strength and seized the territory that lay between the Apennine Mountains and the Alps\" according to Diodorus Siculus. The Po Valley and the rest of northern Italy (known to the Romans as Cisalpine Gaul) was inhabited by Celtic-speakers who founded cities such as Milan.[117] Later the Roman army was routed at the battle of Allia and Rome was sacked in 390 BC by the Senones.[118] At the battle of Telamon in 225 BC, a large Celtic army was trapped between two Roman forces and crushed.[119] The defeat of the combined Samnite, Celtic and Etruscan alliance by the Romans in the Third Samnite War sounded the beginning of the end of the Celtic domination in mainland Europe, but it was not until 192 BC that the Roman armies conquered the last remaining independent Celtic kingdoms in Italy.[citation needed] The Celts also expanded down the Danube river and its tributaries. One of the most influential tribes, the Scordisci, established their capital at Singidunum (present-day Belgrade, Serbia) in the 3rd century BC. The concentration of hill-forts and cemeteries shows a dense population in the Tisza valley of modern-day Vojvodina, Serbia, Hungary and into Ukraine. Expansion into Romania was however blocked by the Dacians.[citation needed] The Serdi were a Celtic tribe[120] inhabiting Thrace. They were located around and founded Serdika (Bulgarian: Сердика, Latin: Ulpia Serdica, Greek: Σαρδῶν πόλις), now Sofia in Bulgaria,[121] which reflects their ethnonym. They would have established themselves in this area during the Celtic migrations at the end of the 4th century BC, though there is no evidence for their existence before the 1st century BC. Serdi are among traditional tribal names reported into the Roman era.[122] They were gradually Thracianized over the centuries but retained their Celtic character in material culture up to a late date.[when?][citation needed] According to other sources they may have been simply of Thracian origin,[123] according to others they may have become of mixed Thraco-Celtic origin. Further south, Celts settled in Thrace (Bulgaria), which they ruled for over a century, and Anatolia, where they settled as the Galatians (see also: Gallic Invasion of Greece). Despite their geographical isolation from the rest of the Celtic world, the Galatians maintained their Celtic language for at least 700 years. St Jerome, who visited Ancyra (modern-day Ankara) in 373 AD, likened their language to that of the Treveri of northern Gaul.[citation needed] For Venceslas Kruta, Galatia in central Turkey was an area of dense Celtic settlement.[citation needed] The Boii tribe gave their name to Bohemia, Bologna and possibly Bavaria, and Celtic artefacts and cemeteries have been discovered further east in what is now Poland and Slovakia. A Celtic coin (Biatec) from Bratislava's mint was displayed on the old Slovak 5-crown coin.[citation needed] As there is no archaeological evidence for large-scale invasions in some of the other areas, one current school of thought holds that Celtic language and culture spread to those areas by contact rather than invasion.[124] However, the Celtic invasions of Italy and the expedition in Greece and western Anatolia, are well documented in Greek and Latin history.[125][126] There are records of Celtic mercenaries in Egypt serving the Ptolemies. Thousands were employed in 283–246 BC and they were also in service around 186 BC. They attempted to overthrow Ptolemy II.[127] All living Celtic languages today belong to the Insular Celtic languages, derived from the Celtic languages spoken in Iron Age Britain and Ireland.[128] They separated into a Goidelic and a Brittonic branch early on. By the time of the Roman conquest of Britain in the 1st century AD, the Insular Celts were made up of the Celtic Britons, the Gaels (or Scoti), and the Picts (or Caledonians).[citation needed] The renown of insular Celts has caused a popular belief that Celtic clans only lived in the British Isles.[129] Linguists have debated whether a Celtic language came to the British Isles and then split, or whether the two branches arrived separately. The older view was that Celtic influence in the Isles was the result of successive migrations or invasions from the European mainland by diverse Celtic-speaking peoples over several centuries, accounting for the P-Celtic vs. Q-Celtic isogloss. This view has been challenged by the hypothesis that the islands' Celtic languages form an Insular Celtic dialect group.[130] In the 19th and 20th centuries, scholars often dated the \"arrival\" of Celtic culture in Britain (via an invasion model) to the 6th century BC, corresponding to archaeological evidence of Hallstatt influence and the appearance of chariot burials in what is now England. Cunliffe and Koch propose in their newer 'Celtic from the West' theory that Celtic languages reached the Isles earlier, with the Bell Beaker culture c.2500 BC, or even before this.[131][132] More recently, a major archaeogenetics study uncovered a migration into southern Britain in the Bronze Age from 1300 to 800 BC.[133] The newcomers were genetically most similar to ancient individuals from Gaul.[133] From 1000 BC, their genetic marker swiftly spread through southern Britain,[134] but not northern Britain.[133] The authors see this as a \"plausible vector for the spread of early Celtic languages into Britain\".[133] There was much less immigration during the Iron Age, so it is likely that Celtic reached Britain before then.[133] Cunliffe suggests that a branch of Celtic was already spoken in Britain, and the Bronze Age migration introduced the Brittonic branch.[135] Like many Celtic peoples on the mainland, the Insular Celts followed an Ancient Celtic religion overseen by druids. Some of the southern British tribes had strong links with Gaul and Belgica, and minted their own coins. During the Roman occupation of Britain, a Romano-British culture emerged in the southeast. The Britons and Picts in the north, and the Gaels of Ireland, remained outside the empire. During the end of Roman rule in Britain in the 400s AD, there was significant Anglo-Saxon settlement of eastern and southern Britain, and some Gaelic settlement of its western coast. During this time, some Britons migrated to the Armorican peninsula, where their culture became dominant. Meanwhile, much of northern Britain (Scotland) became Gaelic. By the 10th century AD, the Insular Celtic peoples had diversified into the Brittonic-speaking Welsh (in Wales), Cornish (in Cornwall), Bretons (in Brittany) and Cumbrians (in the Old North); and the Gaelic-speaking Irish (in Ireland), Scots (in Scotland) and Manx (on the Isle of Man).[citation needed] Classical writers did not call the inhabitants of Britain and Ireland Celtae or Κελτοί (Keltoi),[5][8][9] leading some scholars to question the use of the term 'Celt' for the Iron Age inhabitants of those islands.[5][8][9][10] The first historical account of the islands was by the Greek geographer Pytheas, who sailed around what he called the \"Pretannikai nesoi\" (the \"Pretannic isles\") around 310–306 BC.[136] In general, classical writers referred to the Britons as Pretannoi (in Greek) or Britanni (in Latin).[137] Strabo, writing in Roman times, distinguished between the Celts and Britons.[138] However, Roman historian Tacitus says the Britons resembled the Celts of Gaul in customs and religion.[11] Under Caesar the Romans conquered Celtic Gaul, and from Claudius onward the Roman empire absorbed parts of Britain. Roman local government of these regions closely mirrored pre-Roman tribal boundaries, and archaeological finds suggest native involvement in local government.[citation needed] The native peoples under Roman rule became Romanised and keen to adopt Roman ways. Celtic art had already incorporated classical influences, and surviving Gallo-Roman pieces interpret classical subjects or keep faith with old traditions despite a Roman overlay.[citation needed] The Roman occupation of Gaul, and to a lesser extent of Britain, led to Roman-Celtic syncretism. In the case of the continental Celts, this eventually resulted in a language shift to Vulgar Latin, while the Insular Celts retained their language.[citation needed] There was also considerable cultural influence exerted by Gaul on Rome, particularly in military matters and horsemanship, as the Gauls often served in the Roman cavalry. The Romans adopted the Celtic cavalry sword, the spatha, and Epona, the Celtic horse goddess.[139][140] To the extent that sources are available, they depict a pre-Christian Iron Age Celtic social structure based formally on class and kingship, although this may only have been a particular late phase of organisation in Celtic societies. Patron-client relationships similar to those of Roman society are also described by Caesar and others in the Gaul of the 1st century BC.[citation needed] In the main, the evidence is of tribes being led by kings, although some argue that there is also evidence of oligarchical republican forms of government eventually emerging in areas which had close contact with Rome. Most descriptions of Celtic societies portray them as being divided into three groups: a warrior aristocracy; an intellectual class including professions such as druid, poet, and jurist; and everyone else. In historical times, the offices of high and low kings in Ireland and Scotland were filled by election under the system of tanistry, which eventually came into conflict with the feudal principle of primogeniture in which succession goes to the first-born son.[citation needed] Little is known of family structure among the Celts. Patterns of settlement varied from decentralised to urban. The popular stereotype of non-urbanised societies settled in hillforts and duns,[141] drawn from Britain and Ireland (there are about 3,000 hill forts known in Britain)[142] contrasts with the urban settlements present in the core Hallstatt and La Tène areas, with the many significant oppida of Gaul late in the first millennium BC, and with the towns of Gallia Cisalpina.[citation needed] Slavery, as practised by the Celts, was very likely similar to the better documented practice in ancient Greece and Rome.[143] Slaves were acquired from war, raids, and penal and debt servitude.[143] Slavery was hereditary,[144] though manumission was possible. The Old Irish and Welsh words for 'slave', cacht and caeth respectively, are cognate with Latin captus 'captive' suggesting that the slave trade was an early means of contact between Latin and Celtic societies.[143] In the Middle Ages, slavery was especially prevalent in the Celtic countries.[145] Manumissions were discouraged by law and the word for 'female slave', cumal, was used as a general unit of value in Ireland.[146] There are only very limited records from pre-Christian times written in Celtic languages. These are mostly inscriptions in the Roman and sometimes Greek alphabets. The ogham script, an Early Medieval alphabet, was mostly used in early Christian times in Ireland and Scotland (but also in Wales and England), and was only used for ceremonial purposes such as inscriptions on gravestones. The available evidence is of a strong oral tradition, such as that preserved by bards in Ireland, and eventually recorded by monasteries. Celtic art also produced a great deal of intricate and beautiful metalwork, examples of which have been preserved by their distinctive burial rites.[147] In some regards the Atlantic Celts were conservative: for example, they still used chariots in combat long after they had been reduced to ceremonial roles by the Greeks and Romans. However, despite being outdated, Celtic chariot tactics were able to repel the invasions of Britain attempted by Julius Caesar.[148] According to Diodorus Siculus: The Gauls are tall of body with rippling muscles and white of skin and their hair is blond, and not only naturally so for they also make it their practice by artificial means to increase the distinguishing colour which nature has given it. For they are always washing their hair in limewater and they pull it back from the forehead to the nape of the neck, with the result that their appearance is like that of Satyrs and Pans since the treatment of their hair makes it so heavy and coarse that it differs in no respect from the mane of horses. Some of them shave the beard but others let it grow a little; and the nobles shave their cheeks but they let the moustache grow until it covers the mouth. During the later Iron Age the Gauls generally wore long-sleeved shirts or tunics and long trousers (called braccae by the Romans).[149] Clothes were made of wool or linen, with some silk being used by the rich. Cloaks were worn in the winter. Brooches[150] and armlets were used, but the most famous item of jewellery was the torc, a neck collar of metal, sometimes gold. The horned Waterloo Helmet in the British Museum, which long set the standard for modern images of Celtic warriors, is in fact a unique survival, and may have been a piece for ceremonial rather than military wear.[151] Archaeological evidence suggests that the pre-Roman Celtic societies were linked to the network of overland trade routes that spanned Eurasia. Archaeologists have discovered large prehistoric trackways crossing bogs in Ireland and Germany. Due to their substantial nature, these are believed to have been created for wheeled transport as part of an extensive roadway system that facilitated trade.[152] The territory held by the Celts contained tin, lead, iron, silver and gold.[153] Celtic smiths and metalworkers created weapons and jewellery for international trade, particularly with the Romans.[154] The myth that the Celtic monetary system consisted of wholly barter is a common one, but is in part false. The monetary system was complex and is still not understood (much like the late Roman coinages), and due to the absence of large numbers of coin items, it is assumed that \"proto-money\" was used. This included bronze items made from the early La Tène period and onwards, which were often in the shape of axeheads, rings, or bells. Due to the large number of these present in some burials, it is thought they had a relatively high monetary value, and could be used for \"day to day\" purchases. Low-value coinages of potin, a bronze alloy with high tin content, were minted in most Celtic areas of the continent and in South-East Britain prior to the Roman conquest of these lands. Higher-value coinages, suitable for use in trade, were minted in gold, silver, and high-quality bronze. Gold coinage was much more common than silver coinage, despite being worth substantially more, as while there were around 100 mines in Southern Britain and Central France, silver was more rarely mined. This was due partly to the relative sparsity of mines and the amount of effort needed for extraction compared to the profit gained. As the Roman civilisation grew in importance and expanded its trade with the Celtic world, silver and bronze coinage became more common. This coincided with a major increase in gold production in Celtic areas to meet the Roman demand, due to the high value Romans put on the metal. The large number of gold mines in France is thought to be a major reason why Caesar invaded.[155] Very few reliable sources exist regarding Celtic views on gender roles, though some archaeological evidence suggests their views may have differed from those of the Greco-Roman world, which tended to be less egalitarian.[156][157] Some Iron Age burials in northeastern Gaul suggest women may have had roles in warfare during the earlier La Tène period, but the evidence is far from conclusive.[158] Celtic individuals buried with both female jewellery and weaponry have been found, such as the Vix Grave in northeastern Gaul, and there are questions about the gender of some individuals buried with weaponry. However, it has been suggested that the weapons indicate high social rank rather than masculinity.[159] Most written accounts of the Ancient Celts are from the Romans and Greeks, though it is not clear how accurate these are. Roman historians Ammianus Marcellinus and Tacitus mentioned Celtic women inciting, participating in, and leading battles.[160] Plutarch reports that Celtic women acted as ambassadors to avoid a war among Celtic chiefdoms in the Po valley during the 4th century BC.[161] Posidonius' anthropological comments on the Celts had common themes, primarily primitivism, extreme ferocity, cruel sacrificial practices, and the strength and courage of their women.[162] Cassius Dio suggests there was great sexual freedom among women in Celtic Britain:[163] ... a very witty remark is reported to have been made by the wife of Argentocoxus, a Caledonian, to Julia Augusta. When the empress was jesting with her, after the treaty, about the free intercourse of her sex with men in Britain, she replied: \"We fulfill the demands of nature in a much better way than do you Roman women; for we consort openly with the best men, whereas you let yourselves be debauched in secret by the vilest\". Such was the retort of the British woman. Barry Cunliffe writes that such references are \"likely to be ill-observed\" and meant to portray the Celts as outlandish \"barbarians\".[164] Historian Lisa Bitel argues the descriptions of Celtic women warriors are not credible. She says some Roman and Greek writers wanted to show that the barbarian Celts lived in \"an upside-down world ... and a standard ingredient in such a world was the manly warrior woman\".[165] The Greek philosopher Aristotle wrote in his Politics that the Celts of southeastern Europe approved of male homosexuality. Greek historian Diodorus Siculus wrote in his Bibliotheca historica that although Gaulish women were beautiful, the men had \"little to do with them\" and it was a custom for men to sleep on animal skins with two younger males. He further claimed that \"the young men will offer themselves to strangers and are insulted if the offer is refused\". His claim was later repeated by Greco-Roman writers Athenaeus and Ammianus.[166] H. David Rankin, in Celts and the Classical World, suggests some of these claims refer to bonding rituals in warrior groups, which required abstinence from women at certain times,[167] and says it probably reflects \"the warlike character of early contacts between the Celts and the Greeks\".[168] Under Brehon Law, which was written down in early Medieval Ireland after conversion to Christianity, a woman had the right to divorce her husband and gain his property if he was unable to perform his marital duties due to impotence, obesity, homosexual inclination or preference for other women.[169][170][failed verification] Celtic art is generally used by art historians to refer to art of the La Tène period across Europe, while the Early Medieval art of Britain and Ireland, that is what \"Celtic art\" evokes for much of the general public, is called Insular art in art history. Both styles absorbed considerable influences from non-Celtic sources, but retained a preference for geometrical decoration over figurative subjects, which are often extremely stylised when they do appear; narrative scenes only appear under outside influence. Energetic circular forms, triskeles and spirals are characteristic. Much of the surviving material is in precious metal, which no doubt gives a very unrepresentative picture, but apart from Pictish stones and the Insular high crosses, large monumental sculpture, even with decorative carving, is very rare; possibly it was originally common in wood. Celts were also able to create developed musical instruments such as the carnyces, these famous war trumpets used before the battle to frighten the enemy, as the best preserved found in Tintignac (Gaul) in 2004 and which were decorated with a boar head or a snake head.[171] The interlace patterns that are often regarded as typical of \"Celtic art\" were characteristic of the whole of the British Isles, a style referred to as Insular art, or Hiberno-Saxon art. This artistic style incorporated elements of La Tène, Late Roman, and, most importantly, animal Style II of Germanic Migration Period art. The style was taken up with great skill and enthusiasm by Celtic artists in metalwork and illuminated manuscripts. Equally, the forms used for the finest Insular art were all adopted from the Roman world: Gospel books like the Book of Kells and Book of Lindisfarne, chalices like the Ardagh Chalice and Derrynaflan Chalice, and penannular brooches like the Tara Brooch and Roscrea Brooch. These works are from the period of peak achievement of Insular art, which lasted from the 7th to the 9th centuries, before the Viking attacks sharply set back cultural life.[citation needed] In contrast the less well known but often spectacular art of the richest earlier Continental Celts, before they were conquered by the Romans, often adopted elements of Roman, Greek and other \"foreign\" styles (and possibly used imported craftsmen) to decorate objects that were distinctively Celtic. After the Roman conquests, some Celtic elements remained in popular art, especially Ancient Roman pottery, of which Gaul was actually the largest producer, mostly in Italian styles, but also producing work in local taste, including figurines of deities and wares painted with animals and other subjects in highly formalised styles. Roman Britain also took more interest in enamel than most of the Empire, and its development of champlevé technique was probably important to the later Medieval art of the whole of Europe, of which the energy and freedom of Insular decoration was an important element. Rising nationalism brought Celtic revivals from the 19th century.[citation needed] The Coligny calendar, which was found in 1897 in Coligny, Ain, was engraved on a bronze tablet, preserved in 73 fragments, that originally was 1.48 metres (4 feet 10 inches) wide and 0.9 metres (2 feet 11 inches) high (Lambert p. 111). Based on the style of lettering and the accompanying objects, it probably dates to the end of the 2nd century.[172] It is written in Latin inscriptional capitals, and is in Gaulish. The restored tablet contains 16 vertical columns, with 62 months distributed over 5 years.[citation needed] French archaeologist J. Monard speculated that it was recorded by druids wishing to preserve their tradition of timekeeping in a time when the Julian calendar was imposed throughout the Roman Empire. However, the general form of the calendar suggests the public peg calendars (or parapegmata) found throughout the Greek and Roman world.[173] Tribal warfare appears to have been a regular feature of Celtic societies. While epic literature depicts this as more of a sport focused on raids and hunting rather than organised territorial conquest, the historical record is more of tribes using warfare to exert political control and harass rivals, for economic advantage, and in some instances to conquer territory.[citation needed] The Celts were described by classical writers such as Strabo, Livy, Pausanias, and Florus as fighting like \"wild beasts\", and as hordes. Dionysius said that their:[174] [175] manner of fighting, being in large measure that of wild beasts and frenzied, was an erratic procedure, quite lacking in military science. Thus, at one moment they would raise their swords aloft and smite after the manner of wild boars, throwing the whole weight of their bodies into the blow like hewers of wood or men digging with mattocks, and again they would deliver crosswise blows aimed at no target, as if they intended to cut to pieces the entire bodies of their adversaries, protective armour and all. Polybius (2.33) indicates that the principal Celtic weapon was a long bladed sword which was used for hacking edgewise rather than stabbing. Celtic warriors are described by Polybius and Plutarch as frequently having to cease fighting in order to straighten their sword blades. This claim has been questioned by some archaeologists, who note that Noric steel, steel produced in Celtic Noricum, was famous in the Roman Empire period and was used to equip the Roman military.[176][177] However, Radomir Pleiner, in The Celtic Sword (1993) argues that \"the metallographic evidence shows that Polybius was right up to a point\", as around one third of surviving swords from the period might well have behaved as he describes.[178] In addition to these long bladed slashing swords, spears and specialized javelins were also used.[179] Polybius also asserts that certain of the Celts fought naked: \"The appearance of these naked warriors was a terrifying spectacle, for they were all men of splendid physique and in the prime of life.\"[180] According to Livy, this was also true of the Celts of Asia Minor.[181] Celts had a reputation as head hunters.[182] Paul Jacobsthal says: \"Amongst the Celts the human head was venerated above all else, since the head was to the Celt the soul, centre of the emotions as well as of life itself, a symbol of divinity and of the powers of the other-world.\"[183] Writing in the first century BC, Greek historians Posidonius and Diodorus Siculus said Celtic warriors cut off the heads of enemies slain in battle, hung them from the necks of their horses, then nailed them up outside their homes.[182] Strabo wrote in the same century that Celts embalmed the heads of their most esteemed enemies in cedar oil and put them on display.[182] Roman historian Livy wrote that the Boii beheaded a defeated Roman general after the Battle of Silva Litana, covered his skull in gold, and used it as a ritual cup.[182] Archaeologists have found evidence that heads were embalmed and displayed by the southern Gauls.[184][185] In another example, at the southern Gaulish site of Entremont, there stood a pillar carved with skulls, within which were niches where human skulls were kept, nailed into position.[186] Roquepertuse nearby has similar carved heads and skull niches. Many lone carved heads have been found in Celtic regions, some with two or three faces.[187] Examples include the Mšecké Žehrovice Head and the Corleck Head. Severed heads are a common motif in Insular Celtic myths, and there are many tales in which 'living heads' preside over feasts or speak prophecies.[182][187] The beheading game is a motif in Irish myth and Arthurian legend, most famously in the tale Sir Gawain and the Green Knight, where the Green Knight picks up his own severed head after Gawain has struck it off. There are also many legends in Celtic regions of saints who carry their own severed heads. In Irish myth, the severed heads of warriors are called the mast or nuts of the goddess Macha.[188] Like other European Iron Age societies, the Celts practised a polytheistic religion and believed in an afterlife.[189][190][unreliable source] Celtic religion varied by region and over time, but had \"broad structural similarities\",[189] and there was \"a basic religious homogeneity\" among the Celtic peoples.[191] Because the ancient Celts did not have writing, evidence about their religion is gleaned from archaeology, Greco-Roman accounts, and literature from the early Christian period.[192] The names of over two hundred Celtic deities have survived (see list of Celtic deities), although it is likely that many of these were alternative names, regional names or titles for the same deity.[189] Some deities were venerated only in one region, but others were more widely known.[189] According to Miranda Aldhouse-Green, the Celts were also animists, believing that every part of the natural world had a spirit.[192] The Celts seem to have had a father god, who was often a god of the tribe and of the dead (Toutatis probably being one name for him); and a mother goddess who was associated with the land, earth and fertility[193] (Dea Matrona probably being one name for her). The mother goddess could also take the form of a war goddess as protectress of her tribe and its land.[193] There also seems to have been a male celestial god—identified with Taranis—associated with thunder, the wheel, and the bull.[193] There were gods of skill and craft, such as the pan-regional god Lugus, and the smith god Gobannos.[193] Celtic healing deities were often associated with sacred springs,[193] such as Sirona and Borvo. Other pan-regional deities include the horned god Cernunnos, the horse and fertility goddess Epona, the divine son Maponos, as well as Belenos, Ogmios, and Sucellos.[189][192] Caesar says the Gauls believed they all descended from a god of the dead and underworld.[189] Triplicity is a common theme in Celtic cosmology, and a number of deities were seen as threefold,[194] for example the Three Mothers.[195] Celtic religious ceremonies were overseen by priests known as druids, who also served as judges, teachers, and lore-keepers. Other classes of druids performed sacrifices for the perceived benefit of the community.[196] There is evidence that ancient Celtic peoples sacrificed animals, almost always livestock or working animals. It appears some were offered wholly to the gods (by burying or burning), while some were shared between gods and humans (part eaten and part offered).[197] There is also some evidence that ancient Celts sacrificed humans, and some Greco-Roman sources claim the Gauls sacrificed criminals by burning them in a wicker man.[198] The Romans said the Celts held ceremonies in sacred groves and other natural shrines, called nemetons.[189] Some Celtic peoples built temples or ritual enclosures of varying shapes (such as the Romano-Celtic temple and viereckschanze), though they also maintained shrines at natural sites.[189] Celtic peoples often made votive offerings: treasured items deposited in water and wetlands, or in ritual shafts and wells, often in the same place over generations.[189] Modern clootie wells might be a continuation of this.[199] Most surviving Celtic mythology belongs to the Insular Celtic peoples: Irish mythology has the largest written body of myths, followed by Welsh mythology. These were written down in the early Middle Ages, mainly by Christian scribes. The supernatural race called the Tuatha Dé Danann are believed to represent the main Celtic gods of Ireland. Their traditional rivals are the Fomóire, whom they defeat in the Battle of Mag Tuired.[200] Barry Cunliffe says the underlying structure in Irish myth was a dualism between the male tribal god and the female goddess of the land.[189] The Dagda seems to have been the chief god and the Morrígan his consort, each of whom had other names.[189] One common motif is the sovereignty goddess, who represents the land and bestows sovereignty on a king by marrying him. The goddess Brigid was linked with nature as well as poetry, healing and smithing.[194] Some figures in medieval Insular Celtic myth have ancient continental parallels: Irish Lugh and Welsh Lleu are cognate with Lugus, Goibniu and Gofannon with Gobannos, Macán and Mabon with Maponos, while Macha and Rhiannon may be counterparts of Epona.[201] In Insular Celtic myth, the Otherworld is a parallel realm where the gods dwell. Some mythical heroes visit it by entering ancient burial mounds or caves, by going under water or across the western sea, or after being offered a silver apple branch by an Otherworld resident.[202] Irish myth says that the spirits of the dead travel to the house of Donn (Tech Duinn), a legendary ancestor; this echoes Caesar's comment that the Gauls believed they all descended from a god of the dead and underworld.[189] Insular Celtic peoples celebrated four seasonal festivals, known to the Gaels as Beltaine (1 May), Lughnasa (1 August), Samhain (1 November) and Imbolc (1 February).[189] The Roman invasion of Gaul brought a great deal of Celtic peoples into the Roman Empire. Roman culture had a profound effect on the Celtic tribes which came under the empire's control. Roman influence led to many changes in Celtic religion, the most noticeable of which was the weakening of the druid class, especially religiously; the druids were to eventually disappear altogether. Romano-Celtic deities also began to appear: these deities often had both Roman and Celtic attributes, combined the names of Roman and Celtic deities, or included couples with one Roman and one Celtic deity. Other changes included the adaptation of the Jupiter Column, a sacred column set up in many Celtic regions of the empire, primarily in northern and eastern Gaul. Another major change in religious practice was the use of stone monuments to represent gods and goddesses. The Celts had probably only created wooden cult images (including monuments carved into trees, which were known as sacred poles) before the Roman conquest.[195] While the regions under Roman rule adopted Christianity along with the rest of the Roman empire, unconquered areas of Ireland and Scotland began to move from Celtic polytheism to Christianity in the 5th century. Ireland was converted by missionaries from Britain, such as Saint Patrick. Later missionaries from Ireland were a major source of missionary work in Scotland, Anglo-Saxon parts of Britain, and central Europe (see Hiberno-Scottish mission). Celtic Christianity, the forms of Christianity that took hold in Britain and Ireland at this time, had for some centuries only limited and intermittent contact with Rome and continental Christianity, as well as some contacts with Coptic Christianity. Some elements of Celtic Christianity developed, or retained, features that made them distinct from the rest of Western Christianity, most famously their conservative method of calculating the date of Easter. In 664, the Synod of Whitby began to resolve these differences, mostly by adopting the current Roman practices, which the Gregorian Mission from Rome had introduced to Anglo-Saxon England.[citation needed] Genetic studies on the limited amount of material available suggest continuity between Iron Age people from areas considered Celtic and the earlier Bell Beaker culture of Bronze Age Western Europe.[206][207][208] Like the Bell Beakers, ancient Celts carried a substantial amount of Western Steppe Herders ancestry, which is derived from Yamnaya pastoralists who expanded westwards from the Pontic–Caspian steppe during the late Neolithic and the early Bronze Age and associated with the initial spread of Indo-European languages.[209] This ancestry was particularly prevalent among Celts of Northwest Europe.[208] Examined individuals overwhelmingly carry types of the paternal haplogroup R-M269,[203][204][205] while the maternal haplogroups H and U are frequent.[210][211] These lineages are associated with steppe ancestry.[203][210] The spread of Celts into Iberia and the emergence of the Celtiberians is associated with an increase in north-central European ancestry in Iberia, and may be connected to the expansion of the Urnfield culture.[212] The paternal haplogroup haplogroup I2a1a1a has been detected among Celtiberians.[213] There appears to have been significant gene flow among Celtic peoples of Western Europe during the Iron Age.[214][208] While the Gauls of southern France display genetic links with the Celtiberians, the Gauls of northern France display links with Great Britain and Sweden.[215] Modern populations of Western Europe, particularly those who still speak Celtic languages, display substantial genetic continuity with the Iron Age populations of the same areas.[216][217][218] Geography Organisations",

                "content": "Celtic refers to Irish culture and heritage, along with the historical people who migrated from the British Isles throughout much of Europe. While the early pronunciation was with an /s/ sound, reflecting its nearest origin in French, the modern standard is a hard \"c\" sound like /k/. This is because language historians desired the word to better reflect its Greek and Classical Latin origins. The soft \"c\" sound is usually reserved for sports teams now, like the Boston Celtics. Be it in the pub or in the halls of academia, whenever the topic of Irish culture, language, music, literature—basically, anything Irish—is brought up, the words Celt and Celtic are bound to be heard. In modern-day English, those words are commonly used in reference to the Irish people and their widely-accepted traditions (of course everybody is Irish on St. Patrick's Day; the Celtic cross or knot is a popular tattoo; the Claddagh ring makes a nice gift). The \\k\\ pronunciation for Celt and Celtic dates to the 18th century. The \\k\\ pronunciation for Celt and Celtic dates to the 18th century. The \\k\\ pronunciation for Celt and Celtic dates to the 18th century. The etymology of the noun Celt—from which the adjective Celtic is derived—is straightforward. It's a 16th-century borrowing of the French word Celte, which itself is from Latin Celta, the singular of Celtae, which is the name for a member of an early Indo-European people from antiquity who spread over much of Europe from the British Isles and Spain to Asia Minor. The Latin name is derived from Greek Keltoi, and both the Latin and Greek words referred to the Gauls, the Celtic people who occupied the region that is now France and Belgium. See? Straightforward. With that history laid out, we're wondering how you pronounced all the capital 'c' and 'k' words, especially if you're unfamiliar with French, Latin, Greek, and even English Celt and Celtic, for that matter. The question: is the 'c' sounded \\s\\ or \\k\\? Following its French and Latin predecessors, early pronunciation of Celt was actually \\SELT\\. (In French and Latin, the 'c' is pronounced \\s\\, as in the last name of the French painter Paul Cézanne and in Latin century.) The pronunciation \\KELT\\ started being heard as early as the 18th century, which, in time, ushered in the variant spelling Kelt. The variants were introduced by language and history academics who believed that the pronunciation of Celt should reflect the initial \\k\\ sound in the ancient Greek Keltoi and the Classical Latin Celtae. (It wasn't until the Middle Ages that the letter 'c' in Latin began being pronounced before vowels as the combination \\ts\\—prior, it was pronounced \\k\\; English speakers subsequently reduced the Latin 'c' to a simple \\s\\.) Outside of academia, the variant Kelt never caught on, and it is rarely if ever used today; however, the \\k\\ pronunciation for Celt and Celtic has since flourished. Another influence on pronouncing Celt and Celtic with a soft 'c' is English's phonetic rule for 'c' when followed by 'e' (or 'i,' as in circus or Cicero), which says that, in such cases, the 'c' is usually pronounced as \\s\\. Think cell, cereal, ceiling, and dance. Nevertheless, English speakers, especially those who wanted to sound knowledgeable about things Celtic, grew to prefer the hard 'c' pronunciation, which harkened back to the words' ancient roots. From the 18th century onward, more and more people began sounding the words with an initial \\k\\. By the mid-20th century, \\k\\ became the norm, which is fitting since the pronunciation is in line with that of the Celtic family of languages that include Irish, Scottish Gaelic, Welsh, Breton, and the now-extinct (or, depending on who you talk to, nearly extinct) languages Manx and Cornish. Apparently, people appreciated the ethnic pronunciation. This shift in the pronunciation of Celt is fully evinced when comparing H. W. Fowler's 1926 Dictionary of Modern English with Robert Burchfield's 1996 revised edition. Here's what Fowler had to say about Celt(ic): \"The spelling C-, & the pronunciation s-, are the established ones, & no useful purpose seems to be served by the substitution of k-.\" Decades later, Burchfield observes a different trend: \"Except for the football club Celtic (in Glasgow), which is pronounced [SEL-tik], both Celt and Celtic are pronounced with initial \\k\\ in standard English.\" Burchfield is referring to the Scottish Celtic Football Club, founded in 1887. In America, there is basketball's Boston Celtics, founded in 1946, whose name is also pronounced with an initial \\s\\. The European away support that Celtic enjoys is phenomenal. Few clubs have a fanbase that travels in such numbers or makes as much noise, all the more remarkable when you consider the poor record that the club has away from home in recent times.— Liam Kelly, The Celtic Star, 20 Feb. 2020 Aside from this use of the initial soft 'c' in sports teams' names, Celtic with a hard 'c' is the standard; however, you might still sometimes hear the 'c' softly sounded by those who are uninitiated in the history and etymology of Celt and Celtic as well as those who are unfamiliar with the words and resort to the phonetic rules of English. (And, as happens so often in English, those phonetic rules let them down.) See Definitions and Examples » Get Word of the Day daily email! Learn a new word every day.

                "content": "As Christmas Eve approaches, many people rush to stores to buy last-minute gifts, groceries, or decorations. Walmart, being one of the largest retailers in the world, is a go-to option for many. Understanding Walmart’s Christmas Eve hours can help you plan your shopping trip efficiently and avoid disappointment. This article will guide you through what you need to know about Walmart's holiday schedule, written in simple and easy words. Walmart is known for its long operating hours, with many locations open 24/7 or from early morning to late at night. However, during the holidays, these hours often change. Christmas Eve is one of the days when Walmart adjusts its schedule, so it’s important to check ahead of time. On Christmas Eve, Walmart stores typically close earlier than usual. Most locations open in the morning at their regular time, which is often around 6:00 AM or 7:00 AM. However, they close earlier in the evening, usually around 6:00 PM. This early closure allows Walmart employees to spend time with their families and prepare for Christmas Day, when all Walmart stores are closed. Knowing Walmart’s Christmas Eve hours is important because it helps you avoid the stress of last-minute shopping. Many people wait until Christmas Eve to buy gifts, food, or holiday supplies. This can lead to crowded stores and long lines. Planning your shopping trip early in the day can save you time and ensure you get everything you need. If you’re planning to shop at Walmart on Christmas Eve, here are some helpful tips: Shop Early: Try to visit the store in the morning or early afternoon. This will help you avoid the evening rush. Make a List: Write down everything you need to buy before heading to the store. This will save you time and make your trip more efficient. Check Inventory Online: Use Walmart’s website or app to check if the items you need are in stock at your local store. Be Patient: Christmas Eve is a busy shopping day, so expect crowds and long lines. Stay calm and patient during your trip. If you can’t make it to Walmart on Christmas Eve or prefer to avoid the crowds, there are other options: Online Shopping: Walmart’s website and app offer many items for delivery or pickup. Check delivery times to ensure your order arrives before Christmas. Walmart Pickup and Delivery: Some Walmart locations offer same-day pickup and delivery services. Place your order online and choose a pickup or delivery time that works for you. On Christmas Day, all Walmart stores are closed to allow employees to celebrate the holiday with their families. If you need something urgently on Christmas, consider visiting convenience stores, pharmacies, or other retailers that may be open. After Christmas Day, Walmart returns to its regular hours. The days following Christmas are a great time to shop for discounted holiday items like decorations, gift wrap, and seasonal foods. Planning ahead for these deals can save you money for next year’s celebrations. Walmart’s Christmas Eve hours typically involve early closures, usually around 6:00 PM. Planning your shopping trip ahead of time and arriving early can help you get everything you need without stress. If you can’t visit the store in person, consider using Walmart’s online shopping and pickup options. Remember, Christmas is a time for joy and celebration. By organizing your shopping in advance, you can spend more time enjoying the holiday with your loved ones. Hi, I’m Farhan Sayed!

Thousands of lives were lost, their stories frozen in time. Among the many victims uncovered by archaeologists centuries later, one stands out for her poignant combination of elegance and tragedy—the \"Ring Lady\" of Herculaneum. This enigmatic woman, who met her end on the ancient waterfront, offers us a glimpse into the wealth, status, and resilience of Roman life.

        "Greenland": [
            {
                "title": "Greenland - Wikipedia",
                "content": "Greenland (Greenlandic: Kalaallit Nunaat, pronounced [kalaːɬːit nʉnaːt]; Danish: Grønland, pronounced [ˈkʁɶnˌlænˀ]) is a North American island autonomous territory[14] of the Kingdom of Denmark.[15] It is the larger of two autonomous territories within the Kingdom, the other being the Faroe Islands; the citizens of both territories are full citizens of Denmark. As Greenland is one of the Overseas Countries and Territories of the European Union, citizens of Greenland are European Union citizens.[16] The capital and largest city of Greenland is Nuuk.[16] Greenland lies between the Arctic and Atlantic oceans, east of the Canadian Arctic Archipelago. It is the world's largest island,[d] and is the location of the northernmost point of land in the world – Kaffeklubben Island off the northern coast is the world's northernmost undisputed point of land, and Cape Morris Jesup on the mainland was thought to be so until the 1960s. Though a part of the continent of North America, Greenland has been politically and culturally associated with Europe (specifically Norway and Denmark, the colonial powers) for more than a millennium, beginning in 986.[18] Greenland has been inhabited at intervals over at least the last 4,500 years by circumpolar peoples whose forebears migrated there from what is now Canada.[19][20] Norsemen settled the uninhabited southern part of Greenland beginning in the 10th century (having previously settled Iceland), and the 13th century saw the arrival of Inuit. In the early 17th century, Dano-Norwegian explorers reached Greenland again. When Denmark and Norway separated in 1814, Greenland was transferred to the Danish crown, and was fully integrated in the Danish state in 1953 under the Constitution of Denmark, which made the people in Greenland citizens of Denmark. In the 1979 Greenlandic home rule referendum, Denmark granted home rule to Greenland; in the 2008 Greenlandic self-government referendum, Greenlanders voted for the Self-Government Act, which transferred more power from the Danish government to the local Naalakkersuisut (Greenlandic government).[21] Under this structure, Greenland gradually assumed responsibility for a number of governmental services and areas of competence. The Danish government retains control of citizenship, monetary policy, and foreign affairs, including defence. Most residents of Greenland are Inuit.[22] The population is concentrated mainly on the southwest coast, and the rest of the island is sparsely populated. Three-quarters of Greenland is covered by the only permanent ice sheet outside Antarctica. With a population of 56,583 (2022),[23] Greenland is the least densely populated region in the world.[24] Sixty-seven percent of its electricity production comes from renewable energy, mostly from hydropower.[25] The early Norse settlers named the island Greenland. In the Icelandic sagas, the Norwegian Erik the Red was exiled from Iceland with his father, Thorvald, who had committed manslaughter. With his extended family and his thralls (slaves or serfs), he set out in ships to explore an icy land known to lie to the northwest. After finding a habitable area and settling there, he named it Grœnland (translated as \"Greenland\"), supposedly in the hope that the pleasant name would attract settlers.[26][27][28] The Saga of Erik the Red states: \"In the summer, Erik left to settle in the country he had found, which he called Greenland, as he said people would be attracted there if it had a favorable name.\"[29] The name of the territory in the Greenlandic language is Kalaallit Nunaat 'land of the Kalaallit'.[30] The Kalaallit are the Greenlandic Inuit who inhabit the territory's western region. In prehistoric times, Greenland was home to several successive Paleo-Inuit cultures known primarily through archaeological finds. The earliest entry of the Paleo-Inuit into Greenland is thought to have occurred about 2500 BC. From about 2500 BC to 800 BC, southern and western Greenland was inhabited by the Saqqaq culture. Most finds of remains from that period have been around Disko Bay, including the site of Saqqaq, for which the culture is named.[31][32] From 2400 BC to 1300 BC, the Independence I culture existed in northern Greenland. It was a part of the Arctic small-tool tradition.[33][34][35] Towns, including Deltaterrasserne, appeared. About 800 BC, the Saqqaq culture disappeared and the Early Dorset culture emerged in western Greenland and the Independence II culture in northern Greenland.[36] The Dorset culture was the first culture to extend throughout the Greenlandic coastal areas, in the west and the east. It lasted until the total onset of the Thule culture, in AD 1500. The people of the Dorset culture lived mainly by hunting whales and reindeer.[37][38][39][40] From 986, the west coast was settled by Icelanders and Norwegians, through a contingent of 14 boats led by Erik the Red. They formed three settlements—the Eastern Settlement, the Western Settlement, and the Middle Settlement—on fjords near the southwestern tip of the island.[18][41] They shared the island with the late Dorset culture inhabitants, who occupied the northern and western parts, and later with those of the Thule culture, who entered from the north. Norse Greenlanders submitted to Norwegian rule in 1261 under the Kingdom of Norway.[42] The Kingdom of Norway entered a personal union with Denmark in 1380, and from 1397 was a part of the Kalmar Union.[43] The Norse settlements, such as Brattahlíð, thrived for centuries, before disappearing in the 15th century, perhaps at the onset of the Little Ice Age.[44] Except some runic inscriptions, the only contemporary records or historiography that survives from the Norse settlements is of their contact with Iceland or Norway. Medieval Norwegian sagas and historical works mention Greenland's economy, the bishops of Gardar, and the collection of tithes. A chapter in the Konungs skuggsjá (The King's Mirror) describes Norse Greenland's exports, imports, and grain cultivation. Icelandic saga accounts of life in Greenland were composed in the 13th century and later, and are not primary sources for the history of early Norse Greenland.[28] Those accounts are closer to primary for more contemporaneous accounts of late Norse Greenland. Modern understanding therefore mostly depends on the physical data from archeological sites. Interpretation of ice-core and clam-shell data suggests that between AD 800 and 1300 the regions around the fjords of southern Greenland had a relatively mild climate, several degrees Celsius warmer than usual in the North Atlantic[45] with trees and herbaceous plants growing and livestock being farmed. Barley was grown as a crop up to the 70th parallel.[46] The ice cores show that Greenland has had dramatic temperature shifts many times in the past 100,000 years.[47] Similarly the Icelandic Book of Settlements records famines during the winters, in which \"the old and helpless were killed and thrown over cliffs\".[45] These Norse settlements vanished during the 14th and early 15th centuries.[48] The demise of the Western Settlement coincides with a decrease in summer and winter temperatures. A study of North Atlantic seasonal temperature variability during the Little Ice Age showed a significant decrease in maximum summer temperatures beginning about the turn of the 14th century—as much as 6 to 8 °C (11 to 14 °F) lower than modern summer temperatures.[49] The study also found that the lowest winter temperatures of the last 2,000 years occurred in the late 14th century and early 15th century. The Eastern Settlement was probably abandoned in the early to mid-15th century, during this cold period. Theories drawn from archeological excavations at Herjolfsnes in the 1920s suggest that the condition of human bones from this period indicates that the Norse population was malnourished, possibly because of soil erosion resulting from the Norsemen's destruction of natural vegetation in the course of farming, turf-cutting, and wood-cutting. Malnutrition may also have resulted from widespread deaths from pandemic plague;[50] the decline in temperatures during the Little Ice Age; and armed conflicts with the Skrælings (Norse word for Inuit, meaning \"wretches\"[44]). Recent archeological studies somewhat challenge the general assumption that the Norse colonization had a dramatic negative environmental effect on the vegetation. Data support traces of a possible Norse soil amendment strategy.[51] More recent evidence suggests that the Norse, who never numbered more than about 2,500, gradually abandoned the Greenland settlements over the 15th century as walrus ivory,[52] the most valuable export from Greenland, decreased in price because of competition with other sources of higher-quality ivory, and that there was actually little evidence of starvation or difficulties.[53] Other explanations of the disappearance of the Norse settlements have been proposed: The Thule people are the ancestors of the current Greenlandic population. No genes from the Paleo-Inuit have been found in the present population of Greenland.[56] The Thule culture migrated eastward from what is now known as Alaska around 1000 AD, reaching Greenland around 1300. The Thule culture was the first to introduce to Greenland such technological innovations as dog sleds and toggling harpoons. There is an account of contact and conflict with the Norse population, as told by the Inuit. It is republished in The Norse Atlantic Sagas, by Gwyn Jones. Jones reports that there is also an account of perhaps the same incident, of more doubtful provenance, told by the Norse side. In 1500, King Manuel I of Portugal sent Gaspar Corte-Real to Greenland in search of a Northwest Passage to Asia which, according to the Treaty of Tordesillas, was part of Portugal's sphere of influence. In 1501, Corte-Real returned with his brother, Miguel Corte-Real. Finding the sea frozen, they headed south and arrived in Labrador and Newfoundland. Upon the brothers' return to Portugal, the cartographic information supplied by Corte-Real was incorporated into a new map of the world which was presented to Ercole I d'Este, Duke of Ferrara, by Alberto Cantino in 1502. The Cantino planisphere, made in Lisbon, accurately depicts the southern coastline of Greenland.[57] In 1605–1607, King Christian IV of Denmark and Norway sent a series of expeditions to Greenland and Arctic waterways to locate the lost eastern Norse settlement and assert Danish-Norwegian sovereignty over Greenland. The expeditions were mostly unsuccessful, partly due to leaders who lacked experience with the difficult Arctic ice and weather conditions, and partly because the expedition leaders were given instructions to search for the Eastern Settlement on the east coast of Greenland just north of Cape Farewell, which is almost inaccessible due to southward drifting ice. The pilot on all three trips was English explorer James Hall. After the Norse settlements died off, Greenland came under the de facto control of various Inuit groups, but the Dano-Norwegian government never forgot or relinquished the claims to Greenland that it had inherited from the Norse. When it re-established contact with Greenland in the early 17th century, Denmark-Norway asserted its sovereignty over the island. In 1721 a joint mercantile and clerical expedition led by Dano-Norwegian missionary Hans Egede was sent to Greenland, not knowing whether a Norse civilization remained there. This expedition is part of the Dano-Norwegian colonization of the Americas. After 15 years in Greenland, Hans Egede left his son Paul Egede in charge of the mission there and returned to Denmark, where he established a Greenland Seminary. This new colony was centred at Godthåb (\"Good Hope\") on the southwest coast. Gradually, Greenland was opened up to Danish merchants, but closed to those from other countries. When the union between the crowns of Denmark and Norway was dissolved in 1814, the Treaty of Kiel severed Norway's former colonies and left them under the control of the Danish monarch. Norway occupied then-uninhabited eastern Greenland as Erik the Red's Land in July 1931, claiming that it constituted terra nullius. Norway and Denmark agreed to submit the matter in 1933 to the Permanent Court of International Justice, which decided against Norway.[58] Greenland's connection to Denmark was severed on 9 April 1940, early in World War II, after Denmark was occupied by Nazi Germany. On 8 April 1941, the United States occupied Greenland to defend it against a possible invasion by Germany.[59] The United States' occupation of Greenland continued until 1945. Greenland was able to buy goods from the United States and Canada by selling cryolite from the mine at Ivittuut. In World War II, the United States military used Bluie as a code name for Greenland, where they kept several bases named \"Bluie (East or West) (sequential numeral)\".[60] The major air bases were Bluie West-1 at Narsarsuaq and Bluie West-8 at Søndre Strømfjord (Kangerlussuaq), both of which are still used as Greenland's major international airports. During this war, the system of government changed: Governor Eske Brun ruled the island under a law of 1925 that allowed governors to take control under extreme circumstances; Governor Aksel Svane was transferred to the United States to lead the commission to supply Greenland. The Danish Sirius Patrol guarded the northeastern shores of Greenland in 1942 using dog sleds. They detected several German weather stations and alerted American troops, who destroyed the facilities. After the collapse of the Third Reich, Albert Speer briefly considered escaping in a small aeroplane to hide out in Greenland, but changed his mind and decided to surrender to the United States Armed Forces.[61] Greenland had been a protected and very isolated society until 1940. The Danish government had maintained a strict monopoly of Greenlandic trade, allowing no more than small scale barter trading with British whalers. In wartime Greenland developed a sense of self-reliance through self-government and independent communication with the outside world. Despite this change, in 1946 a commission including the highest Greenlandic council, the Landsrådene, recommended patience and no radical reform of the system. Two years later, the first step towards a change of government was initiated when a grand commission was established. A final report (G-50) was presented in 1950, which recommended the introduction of a modern welfare state with Denmark's development as sponsor and model. In 1953, Greenland was made an equal part of the Danish Kingdom. Home rule was granted in 1979. In 1867, United States Secretary of State William H. Seward worked with former senator Robert J. Walker to explore the possibility of buying Greenland and, perhaps, Iceland. Opposition in Congress ended this project.[62] Following World War II, the United States developed a geopolitical interest in Greenland and in 1946 offered to buy the island from Denmark for $100,000,000; the Danish rejected the offer.[63][64] In 1950, Denmark agreed to allow the US to regain the use of Thule Air Base; it was greatly expanded between 1951 and 1953 as part of a unified NATO Cold War defence strategy. The local population of three nearby villages was moved more than 100 km (62 miles) away in the winter. The United States tried to construct a subterranean network of secret nuclear missile launch sites in the Greenlandic ice cap, named Project Iceworm. According to documents declassified in 1996,[65] this project was managed from Camp Century from 1960 to 1966 before abandonment as unworkable.[66] The missiles were never fielded, and necessary consent from the Danish Government to do so was never sought. The Danish government did not become aware of the programme's mission until 1997, when they discovered it while looking, in the declassified documents, for records related to the crash of a nuclear equipped B-52 bomber at Thule in 1968.[67] With the 1953 Danish constitution, Greenland's colonial status ended as the island was incorporated into the Danish realm as an amt (county). Danish citizenship was extended to Greenlanders. Danish policies toward Greenland consisted of a strategy of cultural assimilation — or de-Greenlandification. During this period, the Danish government promoted the exclusive use of the Danish language in official matters, and required Greenlanders to go to Denmark for their post-secondary education. Many Greenlandic children grew up in boarding schools in southern Denmark, and a number lost their cultural ties to Greenland. While the policies \"succeeded\" in the sense of shifting Greenlanders from being primarily subsistence hunters into being urbanized wage earners, the Greenlandic elite began to reassert a Greenlandic cultural identity. A movement developed in favour of independence, reaching its peak in the 1970s.[68] As a consequence of political complications in relation to Denmark's entry into the European Common Market in 1972, Denmark began to seek a different status for Greenland, resulting in the Home Rule Act of 1979. This gave Greenland limited autonomy with its own legislature taking control of some internal policies, while the Parliament of Denmark maintained full control of external policies, security, and natural resources. The law came into effect on 1 May 1979. The King of Denmark, Frederik X, remains Greenland's head of state. In 1985, Greenland left the European Economic Community (EEC) upon achieving self-rule, as it did not agree with the EEC's commercial fishing regulations and an EEC ban on seal skin products.[69] Greenland voters approved a referendum on greater autonomy on 25 November 2008.[70][71] According to one study, the 2008 vote created what \"can be seen as a system between home rule and full independence\".[72] On 21 June 2009, Greenland gained self-rule with provisions for assuming responsibility for self-government of judicial affairs, policing, and natural resources. Also, Greenlanders were recognized as a separate people under international law.[73] Denmark maintains control of foreign affairs and defence matters. Denmark upholds the annual block grant of 3.2 billion Danish kroner, but as Greenland begins to collect revenues of its natural resources, the grant will gradually be diminished. This is generally considered to be a step toward eventual full independence from Denmark.[74] Greenlandic was declared the sole official language of Greenland at the historic ceremony.[2][4][75][76][77] A century and a half after its first proposition, in August 2019, and again in 2024, prior to taking office after his re-election; United States President Donald Trump stated that the U.S. again wanted to buy the country.[78][79] In December 2024, Prime Minister Múte Eged wrote: \"Greenland is ours. We are not for sale and will never be for sale. We must not lose our long struggle for freedom\".[79] Tourism increased significantly between 2015 and 2019, with the number of visitors increasing from 77,000 per year to 105,000.[80] One source estimated that in 2019 the revenue from this aspect of the economy was about 450 million kroner (US$67 million). Like many aspects of the economy, this slowed dramatically in 2020 and into 2021, due to restrictions required as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic;[81] one source describes it as being the \"biggest economic victim of the coronavirus\" (the overall economy did not suffer too severely as of mid-2020, thanks to the fisheries \"and a hefty subsidy from Copenhagen\").[82] Greenland's goal for returning tourism is to develop it \"right\" and to \"build a more sustainable tourism for the long run\".[83] Greenland is the world's largest non-continental island[84] and the third largest area in North America after Canada and the United States.[85] It is between latitudes 59° and 83°N, and longitudes 11° and 74°W. Greenland is bordered by the Arctic Ocean to the north, the Greenland Sea to the east, the North Atlantic Ocean to the southeast, the Davis Strait to the southwest, Baffin Bay to the west, the Nares Strait and Lincoln Sea to the northwest. The nearest countries to Greenland are Canada, with which it shares a maritime border, to the west and southwest across Nares Strait and Baffin Bay, as well as a shared land border on Hans Island;[86] and Iceland, southeast of Greenland in the Atlantic Ocean. Greenland also contains the world's largest national park, and it is the largest constituent country by area in the world, and is the fourth largest country subdivision in the world, after Sakha Republic in Russia, Australia's state of Western Australia, and Russia's Krasnoyarsk Krai, and the largest in North America. The lowest temperature ever recorded in the Northern Hemisphere was recorded in Greenland, near the topographic summit of the Greenland Ice Sheet, on 22 December 1991, when the temperature reached −69.6 °C (−93.3 °F).[87] In Nuuk, the average daily temperature varies over the seasons from −5.1 to 9.9 °C (22.8 to 49.8 °F).[88] The total area of Greenland is 2,166,086 km2 (836,330 sq mi) (including other offshore minor islands), of which the Greenland ice sheet covers 1,755,637 km2 (677,855 sq mi) (81%) and has a volume of approximately 2,850,000 km3 (680,000 cu mi).[89] The highest point on Greenland is Gunnbjørn Fjeld at 3,700 m (12,100 ft) of the Watkins Range (East Greenland mountain range). The majority of Greenland, however, is less than 1,500 m (4,900 ft) in elevation. Below the ice there is a series of canyons, the biggest called Greenland’s Grand Canyon which was formed by flowing rivers of water from the repeated cycle of ice melting and new ice forming.[90] Near the coast elevations rise suddenly and steeply.[91] The ice flows generally to the coast from the centre of the island. A survey led by French scientist Paul-Emile Victor in 1951 concluded that, under the ice sheet, Greenland is composed of three large islands.[92] This is disputed, but if it is so, they would be separated by narrow straits, reaching the sea at Ilulissat Icefjord, at Greenland's Grand Canyon and south of Nordostrundingen. All towns and settlements of Greenland are situated along the ice-free coast, with the population being concentrated along the west coast. The northeastern part of Greenland is not part of any municipality, but it is the site of the world's largest national park, Northeast Greenland National Park.[93] At least four scientific expedition stations and camps had been established on the ice sheet in the ice-covered central part of Greenland (indicated as pale blue in the adjacent map): Eismitte, North Ice, North GRIP Camp and The Raven Skiway. There is a year-round station Summit Camp on the ice sheet, established in 1989. The radio station Jørgen Brønlund Fjord was, until 1950, the northernmost permanent outpost in the world. The extreme north of Greenland, Peary Land, is not covered by an ice sheet, because the air there is too dry to produce snow, which is essential in the production and maintenance of an ice sheet. If the Greenland ice sheet were to melt away completely, the world's sea level would rise by more than 7 m (23 ft).[94] In 2003, a small island, 35 m × 15 m (115 ft × 49 ft) in length and width, was discovered by arctic explorer Dennis Schmitt and his team at the coordinates of 83-42. Whether this island is permanent is not yet confirmed. If it is, it is the northernmost permanent known land on Earth. In 2007, the existence of a new island was announced. Named \"Uunartoq Qeqertaq\" (English: Warming Island), this island has always been present off the coast of Greenland, but was covered by a glacier. This glacier was discovered in 2002 to be shrinking rapidly, and by 2007 had completely melted away, leaving the exposed island.[95] The island was named Place of the Year by the Oxford Atlas of the World in 2007.[96] Ben Keene, the atlas's editor, commented: In the last two or three decades, global warming has reduced the size of glaciers throughout the Arctic and earlier this year, news sources confirmed what climate scientists already knew: water, not rock, lay beneath this ice bridge on the east coast of Greenland. More islets are likely to appear as the sheet of frozen water covering the world's largest island continues to melt.[97] Some controversy surrounds the history of the island, specifically over whether the island might have been revealed during a brief warm period in Greenland during the mid-20th century.[98] Greenland ice sheet always loses some mass from ice calving at its coasts, but it used to gain more ice on average due to the accumulation of snowfall.[99] Yet, Greenland has been warming starting from around 1900,[100] and starting from 1980s, the losses became larger than the gains.[101] After 1996, Greenland has not had a single year when it did not lose mass on average.[102] In 2010s, Greenland ice sheet had been melting at its fastest rate over at least the past 12,000 years, and on track to exceed that later in the century.[103] In 2012, 2019 and 2021, so-called \"massive melting events\" had occurred, when practically the entire surface of the ice sheet had been melting and no accumulation had been taking place.[104][105][106] During the 2021 event, rain fell at Greenland's highest point for the first time in recorded history: an event so unexpected that the research station at the summit had no rain gauges for the occasion.[107] As with the ice losses elsewhere, the melting of Greenland contributes to sea level rise. Between 2012 and 2017, this melting had added an average of 0.68 mm per year,[108] which was equivalent to 37% of sea level rise from land ice sources (excluding thermal expansion of water from the continual increase in the ocean heat content).[109] By the end of the century, the melting of Greenland alone would add between ~6 cm (2+1⁄2 in) if the temperatures are kept below 2 °C (3.6 °F), to around 13 cm (5 in) if the most intense climate change scenario with ever-increasing greenhouse gas emissions is followed.[110]: 1302 Under this scenario, the worst case for Greenland melting could reach 33 cm (13 in) of sea level rise equivalent.[111] The large quantities of fresh meltwater also affect the Atlantic meridional overturning circulation, or AMOC, by diluting key currents, slowing it down.[112][113] Due to this meltwater input, the circulation may even collapse outright, with widespread detrimental effects, although research suggests this is only likely if highest possible warming is sustained for multiple centuries.[114][115] Greenland ice sheet has a great volume of ~2,900,000 cubic kilometres (696,000 cu mi). This means that if it were all to melt, the global sea levels would increase by ~7.4 m (24 ft) from that alone.[117] However, it also means that it will take at least 1,000 years for the ice sheet to disappear even with very high warming,[111] and in around 10,000 years under lower warming which still crosses the threshold for the ice sheet's disappearance.[118][119] This threshold likely lies for the global warming between 1.7 °C (3.1 °F) and 2.3 °C (4.1 °F). Reducing the warming back to 1.5 °C (2.7 °F) above preindustrial levels or lower (such as through large-scale carbon dioxide removal) would arrest the losses, but still cause greater ultimate sea level rise than if the threshold had never been exceeded.[120] Further, 1.5 °C (2.7 °F) itself appears to commit the ice sheet to 1.4 m (4+1⁄2 ft) of sea level rise.[121] The island was part of the very ancient Precambrian continent of Laurentia, the eastern core of which forms the Greenland Shield, while the less exposed coastal strips become a plateau. On these ice-free coastal strips are sediments formed in the Precambrian, overprinted by metamorphism and now formed by glaciers, which continue into the Cenozoic and Mesozoic in parts of the island. In the east and west of Greenland there are remnants of flood basalts and igneous intrusions, such as the Skaergaard intrusion. Notable rock provinces (metamorphic igneous rocks, ultramafics, and anorthosites) are found on the southwest coast at Qeqertarsuatsiaat. East of Nuuk, the banded iron ore region of Isukasia, over three billion years old, contains the world's oldest rocks, such as greenlandite (a rock composed predominantly of hornblende and hyperthene), formed 3.8 billion years ago,[122] and nuummite. In southern Greenland, the Illimaussaq alkaline complex consists of pegmatites such as nepheline, syenites (especially kakortokite or naujaite) and sodalite (sodalite-foya). In Ivittuut, where cryolite was formerly mined, there are fluoride-bearing pegmatites. To the north of Igaliku, there are the Gardar alkaline pegmatitic intrusions of augite syenite, gabbro, etc. To the west and southwest are Palaeozoic carbonatite complexes at Kangerlussuaq (Gardiner complex) and Safartoq, and basic and ultrabasic igneous rocks at Uiffaq on Disko Island, where there are masses of heavy native iron up to 25 t (28 short tons) in the basalts.[123] The paleontology of East Greenland is specially rich, with some of the early tetrapods[124] such as the Devonian Acanthostega and Ichthyostega, and unique triassic animals such as the phytosaur Mystriosuchus alleroq[125] and the dinosaurs Issi saaneq[126] and tracks.[127] Greenland is home to two ecoregions: Kalaallit Nunaat high arctic tundra and Kalaallit Nunaat low arctic tundra.[128] There are approximately 700 known species of insects in Greenland, which is low compared with other countries (over one million species have been described worldwide). The sea is rich in fish and invertebrates, especially in the milder West Greenland Current; a large part of the Greenland fauna is associated with marine-based food chains, including large colonies of seabirds. The few native land mammals in Greenland include the polar bear, reindeer (introduced by Europeans), arctic fox, arctic hare, musk ox, collared lemming, ermine, and arctic wolf. The last four are found naturally only in East Greenland, having immigrated from Ellesmere Island. There are dozens of species of seals and whales along the coast. Land fauna consists predominantly of animals which have spread from North America or, in the case of many birds and insects, from Europe. There are no native or free-living reptiles or amphibians on the island.[129] Phytogeographically, Greenland belongs to the Arctic province of the Circumboreal Region within the Boreal Kingdom. The island is sparsely populated in vegetation; plant life consists mainly of grassland and small shrubs, which are regularly grazed by livestock. The most common tree native to Greenland is the European white birch (Betula pubescens) along with gray-leaf willow (Salix glauca), rowan (Sorbus aucuparia), common juniper (Juniperus communis) and other smaller trees, mainly willows. Greenland's flora consists of about 500 species of \"higher\" plants, such as flowering plants, ferns, horsetails and lycopodiophyta. Of the other groups, the lichens are the most diverse, with about 950 species; there are 600–700 species of fungi; mosses and bryophytes are also found. Most of Greenland's higher plants have circumpolar or circumboreal distributions; only a dozen species of saxifrage and hawkweed are endemic. A few plant species were introduced by the Norsemen, such as cow vetch. The terrestrial vertebrates of Greenland include the Greenland dog, which was introduced by the Inuit, as well as European-introduced species such as Greenlandic sheep, goats, cattle, reindeer, horse, chicken and sheepdog, all descendants of animals imported by Europeans.[citation needed] Marine mammals include the hooded seal (Cystophora cristata) as well as the grey seal (Halichoerus grypus).[130] Whales frequently pass very close to Greenland's shores in the late summer and early autumn. Whale species include the beluga whale, blue whale, Greenland whale, fin whale, humpback whale, minke whale, narwhal, pilot whale, sperm whale.[131] As of 2009, 269 species of fish from over 80 different families are known from the waters surrounding Greenland. Almost all are marine species with only a few in freshwater, such as Atlantic salmon and charr.[132] The fishing industry is the primary industry of Greenland's economy, accounting for the majority of territory's total exports.[133] Birds, particularly seabirds, are an important part of Greenland's animal life; they consist of both Palearctic and Nearctic species, breeding populations of auks, puffins, skuas, and kittiwakes are found on steep mountainsides.[134][135][136][137] Greenland's ducks and geese include common eider, long-tailed duck, king eider, white-fronted goose, pink-footed goose and barnacle goose. Breeding migratory birds include the snow bunting, lapland bunting, ringed plover, red-throated loon and red-necked phalarope. Non-migratory land birds include the arctic redpoll, ptarmigan, short-eared owl, snowy owl, gyrfalcon and white-tailed eagle.[129] The Greenlandic government holds executive power in local government affairs. The head of the government is called Naalakkersuisut Siulittaasuat (\"Premier\") and serves as head of Greenlandic Government. Any other member of the cabinet is called a Naalakkersuisoq (\"Minister\"). The Greenlandic parliament is called Inatsisartut (\"Legislators\"). The parliament currently has 31 members.[138] In contemporary times, elections are held at municipal, national (Inatsisartut), and kingdom (Folketing) levels. Greenland is a self-governing entity within the constitutional monarchy of the Kingdom of Denmark, in which King Frederik X is the head of state. The monarch officially retains executive power and presides over the Council of State (privy council).[139][140] However, following the introduction of a parliamentary system of government, the duties of the monarch have since become strictly representative and ceremonial,[141] such as the formal appointment and dismissal of the prime minister and other ministers in the executive government. The monarch is not answerable for his or her actions, and the monarch's person is sacrosanct.[142] The party system was dominated by the social-democratic Forward Party, and the democratic socialist Inuit Community Party, both of which broadly argue for greater independence from Denmark. While the 2009 election saw the unionist Democrat Party (two MPs) decline greatly, the 2013 election consolidated the power of the two main parties at the expense of the smaller groups, and saw the eco-socialist Inuit Party elected to the Parliament for the first time. The dominance of the Forward and Inuit Community parties began to wane after the snap 2014 and 2018 elections. The non-binding 2008 referendum on self-governance favouring increased self-governance and autonomy was passed winning 76.22% of the vote. In 1985, Greenland left the European Economic Community (EEC), unlike Denmark, which remains a member. The EEC later became the European Union (EU, renamed and expanded in scope in 1992). Greenland retains some ties through its associated relationship with the EU. However, EU law largely does not apply to Greenland except in the area of trade. Greenland is designated as a member of the Overseas Countries and Territories (OCT) and is thus officially not a part of the European Union, though Greenland can and does receive support from the European Development Fund, Multiannual Financial Framework, European Investment Bank and EU Programmes.[143][144] Greenland's head of state is King Frederik X. The King's government in Denmark appoints a high commissioner (Rigsombudsmand) to represent it on the island. The commissioner is Julie Præst Wilche. The Greenland constituency elect two MP representatives to the Kingdom Parliament (Folketinget) in Denmark, out of a total of 179. The current representatives are Aki-Matilda Høegh-Dam of the Siumut Party and Aaja Chemnitz Larsen of the Inuit Community Party.[145] Greenland has national Parliament that consists of 31 representatives. The government is the Naalakkersuisut whose members are appointed by the premier. The head of government is the premier, usually the leader of the majority party in Parliament. The premier is Múte Bourup Egede of the Inuit Ataqatigiit party.[146] Several American and Danish military bases are located in Greenland, including Pituffik Space Base (previously Thule Air Base), which is home to the United States Space Force's global network of sensors providing missile warning, space surveillance and space control to North American Aerospace Defense Command (NORAD). Elements of the sensor systems are commanded and controlled variously by Space Deltas 2, 4, and 6.[147] In 1995, a political scandal in Denmark occurred after a report revealed the government had given tacit permission for nuclear weapons to be located in Greenland, in contravention of Denmark's 1957 nuclear-free zone policy.[148][67] The United States built a secret nuclear powered base, called Camp Century, in the Greenland ice sheet.[149] On 21 January 1968, a B-52G, with four nuclear bombs aboard as part of Operation Chrome Dome, crashed on the ice of the North Star Bay while attempting an emergency landing at Thule Air Base.[150] The resulting fire caused extensive radioactive contamination.[151] One of the H-bombs remains lost.[152][153] Formerly consisting of three counties comprising a total of 18 municipalities, Greenland abolished these in 2009 and has since been divided into large territories known as \"municipalities\" (Greenlandic: kommuneqarfiit, Danish: kommuner): Sermersooq (\"Much Ice\") around the capital Nuuk and also including all East Coast communities; Kujalleq (\"South\") around Cape Farewell; Qeqqata (\"Centre\") north of the capital along the Davis Strait; Qeqertalik (\"The one with islands\") surrounding Disko Bay; and Avannaata (\"Northern\") in the northwest; the latter two having come into being as a result of the Qaasuitsup municipality, one of the original four, being partitioned in 2018. The northeast of the island composes the unincorporated Northeast Greenland National Park. Pituffik Space Base is also unincorporated, an enclave within Avannaata municipality. As a territorial concession granted to the United States in perpetuity, it is administered by the United States Space Force. During its construction, there were as many as 12,000 American residents but in recent years the number has been below 1,000. The Greenlandic economy is highly dependent on fishing. Fishing accounts for more than 90% of Greenland's exports.[154] The shrimp and fish industry is by far the largest income earner.[155] Greenland is abundant in minerals.[154] Mining of ruby deposits began in 2007. Other mineral prospects are improving as prices are increasing. These include iron, uranium, aluminium, nickel, platinum, tungsten, titanium, and copper. The state company Nunamineral has been launched on the Copenhagen Stock Exchange to raise more capital to increase the production of gold, started in 2007. Another state company, Nunaoil, was created to help develop the hydrocarbon industry in Greenland. However, in July 2021, Greenland banned all new oil and gas exploration in its territory, with government officials stating that the environmental \"price of oil extraction is too high\".[156] Electricity has traditionally been generated by oil or diesel power plants, even if there is a large surplus of potential hydropower. There is a programme to build hydropower plants. The first, and still the largest, is Buksefjord hydroelectric power plant. There are also plans to build a large aluminium smelter, using hydropower to create an exportable product. It is expected that much of the labour needed will be imported.[157] The European Union has urged Greenland to restrict development by the People's Republic of China of rare-earth mineral projects, as China accounts for 95% of the world's current supply. However, in early 2013 the government of Greenland said that it had no plans to impose such restrictions.[158] The public sector, including publicly owned enterprises and the municipalities, plays a dominant role in Greenland's economy. About half the government revenues come from grants from the Danish government, an important supplement to the gross domestic product (GDP). Gross domestic product per capita is equivalent to that of the average economies of Europe. Greenland suffered an economic contraction in the early 1990s. Since 1993, the economy has improved. The Greenland Home Rule Government (GHRG) has pursued a tight fiscal policy since the late 1980s, which has helped create surpluses in the public budget and low inflation. Since 1990, Greenland has registered a foreign-trade deficit following the closure of the last remaining lead and zinc mine that year. In 2017, new sources of ruby in Greenland have been discovered, promising to enhance the gemstone industry in Greenland and add a new export.[159] Air transport connects Greenland internally and with other nations. There is also scheduled boat traffic, but the long distances lead to long travel times and low frequency. There are virtually no roads between cities because the coast has many fjords that would require ferry service to connect a road network. The only exception is a gravel road of 4.8 km (3 mi) length between Kangilinnguit and the now abandoned former cryolite mining town of Ivittuut.[160] In addition, the lack of agriculture, forestry and similar countryside activities has meant that very few country roads have been built. Greenland has no passenger railways. A 1-lane dirt road designed primarily for all-terrain vehicles (secondarily for bicycles and hiking), is under construction between Kangerlussuaq and the town of Sisimiut. As of June 2023, the road was scheduled for completion in 2024.[161] A news report in Sermitsiaq declared the road itself to be completed already in September 2021,[162] but maintenance work and mud problems[163] have caused delays. There are plans to extend the road to a 2-lane gravel road, but a date for its construction start has not been announced.[164] Nuuk Airport is the hub and international gateway for international and domestic airline passenger transport. Air Greenland is the flag carrier of Greenland. Additionally, Icelandair provides year-round services to Greenlandic airports. Seasonal and charter flights are also offered by other airlines.[165][166] Kangerlussuaq Airport (SFJ)[167] was until 2024 the main international gateway to Greenland, but is far from the vicinity of the larger metropolitan capital areas.[168] Ilulissat Airport (JAV)[169] is a domestic airport that also serves international flights to Iceland and is under reconstruction and expansion to enable larger aircraft to serve the airport by 2026.[170] There are a total of 13 registered civil airports and 47 helipads in Greenland; most of them are unpaved and located in rural areas. The fourth-longest runway is at Narsarsuaq Airport, a domestic airport with limited international service in south Greenland. All civil aviation matters are handled by the Danish Transport Authority. Most airports have short runways and can only be served by special fairly small aircraft on fairly short flights. Intercontinental flights connect mainly to Copenhagen. Travel between international destinations (except Iceland) and most cities, requires a plane change in Nuuk. Sea passenger transport is served by several coastal ferries. Arctic Umiaq Line makes a single round trip per week, taking 80 hours each direction.[171] Cargo freight by sea is handled by the shipping company Royal Arctic Line from, to and across Greenland. It provides trade and transport opportunities between Greenland, Europe, and North America. In 2021, Greenland had a population of 56,421.[172] That year, 18,800 people resided in the capital city Nuuk. Nearly all Greenlanders live along the fjords in the south-west of the main island, which has a relatively mild climate, especially considering the high latitude upon which it lies.[173] Whereas the majority of the population lives north of 64°N in colder coastal climates, Greenland's warmest climates such as the vegetated area around Narsarsuaq are sparsely populated. The majority of the population is Lutheran. The historically important Moravian Brothers (Herrnhuters) were a congregation of faith, in a Danish context based in Christiansfeld in South Jutland, and partially of German origin, but their name does not signify they were ethnic Moravians (Czechs). In terms of country of birth, the population is estimated to be of 89.7% Greenlandic multiethnic European-Inuit origin, 7.8% Danish, 1.1% other Nordic and 1.4% other. The multi-ethnic population of European-Inuit represent people of Danish, Norwegian and to a lesser degree of Faroese, Icelandic, Dutch (whalers), German[6] and American descent. A 2015 wide genetic study of Greenlanders found modern-day Inuit in Greenland are direct descendants of the first Inuit pioneers of the Thule culture who arrived in the 13th century, with approximately 25% admixture of the European colonizers from the 16th century. Despite previous speculations, no evidence of Viking settlers predecessors has been found.[174] Greenlandic (effectively West Greenlandic), spoken by nearly 50,000 people, became the official sole language in 2009.[176] The majority of the population speak both Danish and West Greenlandic Kalaallisut (the most populous Eskaleut language). They have been used in public affairs since the establishment of home rule in 1979. In practice, Danish is still widely used in administration, academics, and skilled trades and other professions. The orthography of Greenlandic, established in 1851,[177] was revised in 1973. The literacy rate is 100%.[155] About 12% of the population speak Danish as a first or sole language. These primarily are Danish immigrants, many of whom remain the first and only language for those in Nuuk and other larger towns. Debate about the roles of Greenlandic and Danish in the country's future is evolving. While Greenlandic was dominant in all smaller settlements, most of the multi ethnic Inuit ancestors spoke Danish as a second language. In larger towns, especially Nuuk, this Danish group was more important for social matters. English is another important language for Greenland now taught from the first school year.[178] West Greenland has long been the most populous area of the island and home to its de facto status as the official Greenlandic language. Although around 3,000 people speak East Greenlandic (Tunumiisut) and nearly 1,000 around northern Qaanaaq speak Inuktun. North Greenlandic is closer to the Inuit languages of Canada than it is to other Greenlandic.[179] Each of these varieties is nearly unintelligible to the speakers of the others and some linguists consider Tunumiisut to be a separate language all together.[180] A UNESCO report labelled the other varieties as endangered, and measures are now considered to protect the East Greenlandic dialect.[181] Education is organized in a similar way to Denmark. There is ten year mandatory primary school. There is also a secondary school, with either work education or preparatory for university education. There is one university, the University of Greenland (Greenlandic: Ilisimatusarfik) in Nuuk. Many Greenlanders attend universities in Denmark or elsewhere. The public school system in Greenland is, as in Denmark, under the jurisdiction of the municipalities: they are therefore municipal schools. The legislature specifies the standards allowed for the content in schools, but the municipal governments decide how the schools under their responsibility are run. Education is free and compulsory for children aged seven to 16. The financial effort devoted to education is now very important (11.3% of GDP). Section 1 of the Government Ordinance on Public Schools (as amended on 6 June 1997) requires Greenlandic as the language of instruction. Education is governed by Regulation No. 10 of 25 October 1990 on primary and lower secondary education. This regulation was amended by Regulation No. 8 of 13 May 1993 and Regulation No. 1 of 1 March 1994. Under Regulation No. 10 of 25 October 1990, linguistic integration in primary and lower secondary schools became compulsory for all students. The aim is to place Greenlandic-speaking and Danish-speaking pupils in the same classes, whereas previously they were placed in separate classes according to their mother tongue. At the same time, the government guarantees that Danish speakers can learn Greenlandic. In this way, the Greenlandic government wants to give the same linguistic, cultural and social education to all students, both those of Greenlandic and Danish origin. A study, which was carried out during a three-year trial period, concluded that this policy had achieved positive results. This bilingualism policy has been in force since 1994. About 100 schools have been established. Greenlandic and Danish are taught there. Normally, Greenlandic is taught from kindergarten to the end of secondary school, but Danish is compulsory from the first cycle of primary school as a second language. As in Denmark with Danish, the school system provides for \"Greenlandic 1\" and \"Greenlandic 2\" courses. Language tests allow students to move from one level to the other. Based on the teachers' evaluation of their students, a third level of courses has been added: \"Greenlandic 3\". Secondary education in Greenland is generally vocational and technical. The system is governed by Regulation No. 16 of 28 October 1993 on Vocational and Technical Education, Scholarships and Career Guidance. Danish remains the main language of instruction. The capital, Nuuk, has a (bilingual) teacher training college and a (bilingual) university. At the end of their studies, all students must pass a test in the Greenlandic language. Higher education is offered in Greenland: \"university education\" (regulation no. 3 of 9 May 1989); training of journalists, training of primary and lower secondary school teachers, training of social workers, training of social educators (regulation no. 1 of 16 May 1989); and training of nurses and nursing assistants (regulation no. 9 of 13 May 1990). Greenlandic students can continue their education in Denmark, if they wish and have the financial means to do so. For admission to Danish educational institutions, Greenlandic applicants are placed on an equal footing with Danish applicants. Scholarships are granted to Greenlandic students who are admitted to Danish educational institutions. To be eligible for these scholarships, the applicant must be a Danish citizen and have had permanent residence in Greenland for at least five years. The total period of residence outside Greenland may not exceed three years. Religion in Greenland (2010):[182][183] The nomadic Inuit were traditionally shamanistic, with a well-developed religion primarily concerned with appeasing a vengeful and fingerless sea goddess called Sedna who controlled the success of the seal and whale hunts.[184] The first Norse colonists worshipped the Norse gods, but Erik the Red's son Leif was converted to Christianity by King Olaf Trygvesson on a trip to Norway in 999 and sent missionaries back to Greenland. These swiftly established sixteen parishes, some monasteries, and a bishopric at Garðar. Rediscovering these colonists and spreading ideas of the Protestant Reformation among them was one of the primary reasons for the Danish recolonization in the 18th century. Under the patronage of the Royal Mission College in Copenhagen, Norwegian and Danish Lutherans and German Moravian missionaries searched for the missing Norse settlements, but no Norse were found, and instead they began preaching to the Inuit. The principal figures in the Christianization of Greenland were Hans and Poul Egede and Matthias Stach. The New Testament was translated piecemeal from the time of the first settlement on Kangeq Island, but the first translation of the whole Bible was not completed until 1900. An improved translation using the modern orthography was completed in 2000.[185][better source needed] The major religion is Protestant Christianity, represented mainly by the Church of Denmark, which is Lutheran in orientation. There are no official census data on religion in Greenland, but the Bishop of Greenland Sofie Petersen[186] estimates that 85% of the Greenlandic population are members of her congregation.[187] The Church of Denmark is the established church through the Constitution of Denmark.[188] The Roman Catholic minority is pastorally served by the Roman Catholic Diocese of Copenhagen. There are still Christian missionaries on the island, but mainly from charismatic movements proselytizing fellow Christians.[189] The rate of suicide in Greenland is very high. According to a 2010 census, Greenland holds the highest suicide rate in the world.[190][191] Another significant social issue faced by Greenland is a high rate of alcoholism.[192] Alcohol consumption rates in Greenland reached their height in the 1980s, when it was twice as high as in Denmark, and had by 2010 fallen slightly below the average level of consumption in Denmark (which at the time were 12th highest in the world, but has since fallen). However, at the same time, alcohol prices are far higher, meaning that consumption has a large social impact.[193][194] Prevalence of HIV/AIDS used to be high in Greenland and peaked in the 1990s when the fatality rate also was relatively high. Through a number of initiatives the prevalence (along with the fatality rate through efficient treatment) has fallen and is now low, c. 0.13%,[195][196] below most other countries. In recent decades, the unemployment rates have generally been somewhat above those in Denmark;[197] in 2017, the rate was 6.8% in Greenland,[198] compared to 5.6% in Denmark.[199] In the 1960s and 1970s, at a time when the population was increasing, 4,500 Greenland Inuit women and girls (roughly half of all fertile females) were fitted with intrauterine devices (IUDs) by Danish doctors. Sometimes girls (as young as 12) were taken directly from school to have these devices inserted, without parents' permission being sought. The procedure was also carried out on some Inuit girls at boarding schools in Denmark. On 30 September 2022, the Danish Health Minister, Magnus Heunicke, confirmed that a two-year investigation would try to find out what decisions led to the practice and how it was carried out.[200] Greenlandic doctors also carried out the same illegal procedures on several Inuit women after Greenland took control of its health care system in 1991.[201] Greenlandic culture is a blending of traditional Inuit (Kalaallit, Tunumiit, Inughuit) and Scandinavian culture. Inuit, or Kalaallit, culture has a strong artistic tradition, dating back thousands of years. The Kalaallit are known for an art form of figures called tupilak or a \"spirit object\". Traditional art-making practices thrive in the Ammassalik.[202] Sperm whale ivory remains a valued medium for carving.[203] Greenland has a successful, albeit small, music culture. Some popular Greenlandic bands and artists include Sumé (classic rock), Chilly Friday (rock), Nanook (rock), Siissisoq (rock), Nuuk Posse (hip hop) and Rasmus Lyberth (folk), who performed in the Danish national final for the 1979 Eurovision Song Contest, performing in Greenlandic. The singer-songwriter Simon Lynge is the first musical artist from Greenland to have an album released across the United Kingdom, and to perform at the UK's Glastonbury Festival. The music culture of Greenland also includes traditional Inuit music, largely revolving around singing and drums. The drum is the traditional Greenlandic instrument. It was used to perform traditional drum dances. For this purpose, a round drum (qilaat) in the form of a frame made of driftwood or walrus ribs covered with a polar bear bladder, polar bear stomach or walrus stomach was used. The drumming was not done on the membrane, but with a stick from underneath the frame. Simple melodies were sung for this purpose. The drum dance used to serve two functions. One was to drive away fear on long, dark winter nights by making faces and trying to make others laugh. Disputes were also settled with the drum. If someone had misbehaved, he was challenged with the drum. People would gather at certain powerful places and take turns beating the drum and singing to it. They tried to ridicule the other person as much as possible. The spectators expressed with their laughter who was the winner and who was therefore the guilty one. The drum could also be used by shamans for ritual conjurations of spirits. After the arrival of missionaries in the 18th century, the drum dance (still popular among Canadian Inuit) was banned as pagan and shamanistic and replaced by polyphonic singing of secular and church songs. This choral singing is known for its special sound. Church hymns are partly of German origin due to the influence of the Herrnhuter Brüdergemeinde. Scandinavian, German and Scottish whalers brought the fiddle, accordion and polka (kalattuut) to Greenland, where they are now played in intricate dance steps. Sport is an important part of Greenlandic culture, as the population is generally quite active.[204] Popular sports include association football, track and field, handball and skiing. Handball is often referred to as the national sport,[205] and the men's national team was ranked among the top 20 in the world in 2001. Greenland has excellent conditions for skiing, fishing, snowboarding, ice climbing and rock climbing, although mountain climbing and hiking are preferred by the general public. Although the environment is generally ill-suited for golf, there is a golf course in Nuuk. The national dish of Greenland is suaasat, a soup made from seal meat. Meat from marine mammals, game, birds, and fish have a large role in the Greenlandic diet. Due to the glacial landscape, most ingredients come from the ocean.[206] Spices are seldom used besides salt and pepper.[207] Greenlandic coffee is a \"flaming\" dessert coffee (set alight before serving) made with coffee, whiskey, Kahlúa, Grand Marnier, and whipped cream. It is stronger than the familiar Irish dessert coffee.[208] Kalaallit Nunaata Radioa (KNR) is the public broadcasting company of Greenland. It is an associate member of Eurovision and an associate member of the Nordvision network. Nearly one hundred people are directly employed by this company, which is one of the largest in the territory.[209] The city of Nuuk also has its own radio and television station. The city of Nuuk also has a local television channel, Nanoq Media, which was created on 1 August 2002. It is the largest local television station in Greenland, reaching more than 4,000 households as receiving members, which corresponds to about 75% of all households in the capital.[210] Only two newspapers are published in Greenland, both of which are distributed nationally. The Greenlandic weekly Sermitsiaq is published every Friday, while the online version is updated several times a day. It was distributed only in Nuuk until the 1980s. It is named after the mountain Sermitsiaq, located about 15 km (9.5 mi) northeast of Nuuk. The bi-weekly Atuagagdliutit/Grønlandsposten (AG) is the other newspaper in Greenland, published every Tuesday and Thursday in Greenlandic as Atuagagdliutit and in Danish as Grønlandsposten. The articles are all published in both languages. The Inuit have their own arts and crafts tradition; for example, they carve tupilaks, sculptures of figures of avenging monsters practiced within shaman traditions.[211] This Kalaallisut word means soul or spirit of a deceased person and describes an artistic figure, usually no more than 20 centimetres (8 in) tall, carved mainly from walrus ivory, with a variety of unusual shapes. This sculpture actually represents a mythical or spiritual being; usually, however, it has become a mere collector's item because of its grotesque appearance for Western visual habits. Modern artisans still use indigenous materials such as musk ox and sheep wool, seal fur, shells, soapstone, reindeer antlers or gemstones. The history of Greenlandic painting began with Aron von Kangeq, who depicted the old Greenlandic sagas and myths in his drawings and watercolours in the mid-19th century. In the 20th century, landscape and animal painting developed, as well as printmaking and book illustrations with sometimes expressive colouring. It was mainly through their landscape paintings that Kiistat Lund and Buuti Pedersen became known abroad. Anne-Birthe Hove chose themes from Greenlandic social life. There is a museum of fine arts in Nuuk, the Nuuk Art Museum. 72°00′N 40°00′W﻿ / ﻿72.000°N 40.000°W﻿ / 72.000; -40.000",

                "content": "Our editors will review what you’ve submitted and determine whether to revise the article. Greenland, the world’s largest island, lying in the North Atlantic Ocean. Greenland (Kalaallit Nunaat) is noted for its vast tundra and immense glaciers. Although Greenland remains part of the Kingdom of Denmark, the island’s home-rule government is responsible for most domestic affairs. The Greenlandic people are primarily Inuit who, depending upon the region they are from, call themselves Kalaallit (West Greenlanders), Inugguit (from Thule district), or Iit (East Greenlanders). They call their homeland Kalaallit Nunaat (“Country of the Greenlanders”). The capital of Greenland is Nuuk (Godthåb). More than three times the size of the U.S. state of Texas, Greenland extends about 1,660 miles (2,670 km) from north to south and more than 650 miles (1,050 km) from east to west at its widest point. Two-thirds of the island lies within the Arctic Circle, and the island’s northern extremity extends to within less than 500 miles (800 km) of the North Pole. Greenland is separated from Canada’s Ellesmere Island to the north by only 16 miles (26 km). The nearest European country is Iceland, lying about 200 miles (320 km) across the Denmark Strait to the southeast. Greenland’s deeply indented coastline is 24,430 miles (39,330 km) long, a distance roughly equivalent to Earth’s circumference at the Equator. A submarine ridge no deeper than 600 feet (180 metres) connects the island physically with North America. Structurally, Greenland is an extension of the Canadian Shield, the rough plateau of the Canadian North that is made up of hard Precambrian rocks. Greenland’s major physical feature is its massive ice sheet, which is second only to Antarctica’s in size. The Greenland Ice Sheet has an average thickness of 5,000 feet (1,500 metres), reaches a maximum thickness of about 10,000 feet (3,000 metres), and covers more than 700,000 square miles (1,800,000 square km)—over four-fifths of Greenland’s total land area. Layers of snow falling on its barren, windswept surface become compressed into ice layers, which constantly move outward to the peripheral glaciers; the Jakobshavn Glacier, often moving 100 feet (30 metres) a day, is among the world’s fastest glaciers. The remaining ice-free land area occupies the country’s coastal areas and consists largely of highlands; mountain chains parallel the island’s east and west coasts, rising to 12,139 feet (3,700 metres) at Gunnbjørn Mountain in the southeast. These highlands notwithstanding, most parts of the rock floor underlying the Greenland Ice Sheet are in fact at or slightly beneath current sea levels. Long, deep fjords reach far into both the east and west coasts of Greenland in complex systems, offering magnificent, if desolate, scenery. Along many parts of the coast, the ice sheet fronts directly on the sea, with large chunks breaking off the glaciers and sliding into the water as icebergs. The climate of Greenland is Arctic, modified only by the slight influence of the Gulf Stream in the southwest. Rapid weather changes, from sunshine to impenetrable blizzards, are common and result from the eastward progression of low-pressure air masses over a permanent layer of cold air above the island’s icy interior. Average winter (January) temperatures range from the low 20s F (about −7 °C) in the south to approximately −30 °F (about −34 °C) in the north. Summer temperatures along the southwestern coast average in the mid-40s F (about 7 °C) during July, while the average in the far north is closer to 40 °F (about 4 °C). Greenland experiences about two months of midnight sun during the summer. Average annual precipitation decreases from more than 75 inches (1,900 mm) in the south to about 2 inches (50 mm) in the north. Large areas of the island can be classified as Arctic deserts because of their limited precipitation. In the late 20th and early 21st centuries, scientists posited that global warming was profoundly affecting not only Greenland’s climate but also its physical geography. A number of scientists noted that Greenland’s vast ice sheet was shrinking at a highly increased rate. In 2012, for example, satellites revealed that at midyear 97 percent of the ice sheet showed some signs of melting, whereas in most years the melt affected only about half of the ice sheet. Researchers were uncertain, however, if the abrupt ice loss represented a long-term trend, but in 2016, as global warming pushed the planet toward the hottest January, February, March, April, and May in its history (according to NASA), Greenland also experienced a series of record early spikes in the melting of its ice sheets. The country’s plant life is characterized mainly as tundra vegetation and consists of such plants as sedge and cotton grass. Plantlike lichens also are common. The limited ice-free areas are almost totally devoid of trees, although some dwarfed birch, willow, and alder scrub do manage to survive in sheltered valleys in the south. Several species of land mammals—including polar bears, musk oxen, reindeer, Arctic foxes, snow hares, ermines, and lemmings—can be found on the island. Seals and whales are found in the surrounding waters and were formerly the chief source of nourishment for the Greenlanders. Cod, salmon, flounder, and halibut are important saltwater fish, and the island’s rivers contain salmon and Arctic char.",

This large Arctic island is near two countries, Iceland to the east and Canada to the west. The island is geographically part of North America but the culture is more closely related to Denmark.[14] It has a population of only 50,000 people, limited by its cold climate. Most of the civilian population lives in the southern part of the island, on the coasts. [source?] The capital of Greenland is Nuuk. The island is democratic, with its own elections and a representative seat of government in Nuuk. It is part of the Kingdom of Denmark, a constitutional monarchy with Queen Margrethe II as head of state. Greenland has two members in Denmark's Folketing. The island's Thule Air Base is under Danish control, but is administered by the United States Air Force.[15] The island is the least densely populated country in the world, with a density of 0.026 people per square kilometer.[16][17][18] Antarctica is not counted because it is not an independent country and has no permanent inhabitants. The ice sheet that covers Greenland may hide three separate islands, which have been joined by glaciers since the last geologic ice age.[19][20][21][22] In Greenland, there are no forests. In the south, at the coastal area, only some dwarf trees are found.[23] Greenland has been inhabited at intervals over at least the last 4,500 years by Arctic peoples. They came from what is now Canada.[24][25] Norsemen settled the uninhabited southern part of Greenland beginning in the 10th century, having previously settled Iceland. Norsemen would later set sail from Greenland and Iceland with Leif Erikson. They were the first known Europeans to reach North America. They did so nearly 500 years before Columbus reached the Caribbean islands. Inuit peoples arrived in Greenland in the 13th century. Though under continuous influence of Norway and Norwegians, Greenland was not formally under the Norwegian crown until 1261. Their colonies declined after the Black Death in the late 1400s. Denmark–Norway, joined in alliance at the time, reclaimed sovereignty over the island in the 17th century. Greenland became Danish in 1814.[26] The island is populated mostly by Inuit and Scandinavians who speak Greenlandic, an Eskimo-Aleut language. Danish is also spoken by most people. The national anthem of Greenland is Nunarput utoqqarsuanngoravit. Greenlandic became the sole official language in June 2009.[27] However, it is the dialect of western Greenland, leaving other dialects to become less used and endangered. Danish is used in practice by professional people and by many of the Inuit population. English is taught in schools from the first year onwards.[28] Until 2009, there were 20 communes in Greenland. Unless stated otherwise, they are in the district Kitaa: This changed on January 1st, 2009, when these were merged into four large communes: In addition, some parts of Greenland are outside a commune, namely: As of January 1st, 2008, 218 people lived there.[29] The island has many mountains. Gunnbjorn Fjeld is the tallest mountain Greenland.[30] All of the cities are on the coast, because everywhere else is covered by a big layer of ice.[31] The major cities are Nuuk, Sisimiut, Ilulissat, and Qaqortoq. The coasts of Greenland are tundras. Away from the coast, it is considered an ice cap. Summers in Greenland are short and cool while winters are long.",

                "content": "Watch CBS News By Jeff Capellini, Naveen Dhaliwal, Mark Prussin Updated on: December 23, 2024 / 3:27 PM EST / CBS New York NEW YORK -- A woman died after she was set on fire while sleeping on a New York City subway car Sunday morning in Brooklyn, according to police. A person of interest was taken into custody later in the day, New York Police Department Commissioner Jessica Tisch said at an early evening news conference. Police said the person of interest came to the U.S. from Guatemala in 2018. He was later charged with first degree murder and arson, but investigators did not immediately reveal a possible motive. \"I want you to know that this apprehension was another in what has become a series of joint efforts involving different crimes between the police and the public we serve,\" Tisch said. \"In today's case, we were able to get incredibly clear and detailed images of the suspect from the initial incident. Then, we asked the media to broadcast those images far and wide so we could use the viewing public as a force multiplier — and New Yorkers came through again.\" Using images obtained from security cameras on the train, police and the public had a very clear picture of the man they were looking for. Tisch credited three high school-aged New Yorkers for seeing the person of interest and calling 911, leading to his capture. The NYPD had been offering a $10,000 reward for information on the incident. Police have not yet been able to identify the victim. Tisch said the person of interest was on an F train as it pulled up to the Coney Island-Stillwell Avenue station in Brooklyn at around 7:30 a.m. She said he approached the sleeping woman, and then lit her on fire with what was believed to be a lighter. She added the victim's clothes became fully engulfed in a matter of seconds. Police said there appeared to be no interaction between the victim and her attacker before she was lit on fire. Tisch said nearby officers saw and smelled smoke and immediately went over to investigate and, with the help of an MTA worker, used a fire extinguisher to put out the flames. EMS arrived shortly thereafter and pronounced the woman dead on the train. Unbeknownst to the officers who responded, the person of interest stayed at the scene and was spotted sitting on a bench on the platform just outside the train car. He was later apprehended without incident on another train that was stopped at Herald Square, Tisch said. The person of interest was wearing the same clothes and was found with a lighter in his pocket, police added. \"This is amazing work done by the public and the police working together. Once again, someone saw something, we got it out through technology in numerous ways, and we were able to make a quick arrest on this nothing less than heinous crime that occurred in our subway system,\" NYPD Chief of Transit Joseph Gulotta said. Anyone with any information is asked to call the NYPD's Crime Stoppers hotline at 1-800-577-TIPS (8477), or for Spanish, 1-888-57-PISTA (74782). You can also submit a tip via their website or via DM on Twitter, @NYPDTips. All calls are kept confidential. Jeff Capellini has been digital producer at CBS New York for 18 years.

                "content": "The attack took place on the F train at the Coney Island-Stillwell Avenue subway station in Brooklyn. A suspect is facing charges of murder after a woman who appeared to be asleep was fatally set on fire on a subway train in New York City. The woman, who has not been identified, sat motionlessly on board a stationary F train at the Coney Island-Stillwell Avenue subway station in Brooklyn at about 7:30am (12:30 GMT) on Sunday when a man calmly approached her and used a lighter to set her clothes on fire, the New York Police Department said. A suspect identified by police as Sebastian Zapeta was taken into custody hours after the woman died on Sunday morning. Transit police apprehended the suspect after receiving a report from three high school students who had recognised the man. They had seen images of the suspect taken from surveillance and police body cam video and widely distributed by police. The man got off the car as police officers on patrol in the station rushed to the blaze. “New Yorkers came through again,” said New York Police Commissioner Jessica Tisch, who described the case as “one of the most depraved crimes one person could possibly commit against another human being”. The officers used fire extinguishers to put out the fire and the woman was pronounced dead at the scene by emergency responders, police said. They added there was no interaction before the attack and they did not believe the two people knew each other. Jeff Carter, a spokesman for US Immigration and Customs Enforcement, said that Zapeta is a 33-year-old Guatemalan citizen who entered the US illegally after being previously removed in 2018. While immigrants commit violent crimes at a lower rate than people born in the US, right-wing politicians have seized on incidents of violent crime by undocumented immigrants to push for mass deportations and more restrictive immigration policies. Cellphone video published on social media by a horrified onlooker also showed a man sitting on a bench on the platform a few steps away from the burning woman, dressed in a grey hoodie that resembles that worn by the suspect arrested later on Sunday. Asked whether the man watching from the bench was the attacker, police said that responding officers had no reason to think he was a suspect when they rushed to the woman’s aid. About four million trips are taken each weekday on the city’s subway, where violent crime is relatively rare. As of November, there had been nine homicides reported on the subway in 2024, compared to five in the same period in 2023, according to police data. Earlier this month, a jury acquitted Daniel Penny of criminally negligent homicide in the death of Jordan Neely, a homeless former Michael Jackson impersonator, on the city’s subway. Neely had been shouting angrily at passengers on a subway train when Penny grabbed him from behind and restrained him in a chokehold for several minutes. Follow Al Jazeera English:",

        "Honda, Nissan merger": [
            {
                "title": "What Honda-Nissan merger means and how it could affect Detroit Three",
                "content": "This story has been updated. The plan announced Monday by Japanese automakers Honda and Nissan to merge by 2026 highlights how the rise of Chinese automakers such as BYD is pressuring the industry to look for potential cost savings and increased scale, auto industry analysts told the Free Press. They suggested that consumers could benefit eventually, but any impact on the Detroit Three will take time to unfold. They also pointed to the last major merger in the industry: the creation of Stellantis in 2021, to show that such endeavors are challenging to pull off successfully. Stellantis, owner of Jeep, Ram, Chrysler, Dodge and Fiat, has struggled in particular this year, even saying goodbye to CEO Carlos Tavares amid fights with key stakeholders, sales declines and excess inventory. A completed Honda-Nissan merger would create the third-largest global automaker by vehicle sales after Toyota and Volkswagen. The news comes as the incoming Trump administration’s tariff threats add more uncertainty to the industry landscape. The plans, announced Monday in Tokyo, would seek to set up a holding company with Honda, the larger of the two, selecting the majority of the board members, according to Reuters, which noted that Mitsubishi is also considering joining and that the combined group would mean annual global sales of more than 8 million vehicles. Sam Fiorani, vice president of global vehicle forecasting for AutoForecast Solutions, said he does not expect any change for the Detroit Three in the short term. “Nissan’s goal is to lower costs for parts and engineering by harnessing the volume of another manufacturer, like Honda. To regain some of its lost market share, Nissan would need years before they built up new products and found new buyers to fill up their existing plants,” he said. “Honda could add new segments, particularly body-on-frame pickups and SUVs that is one of Nissan’s strong areas. If Honda were to acquire a midsized pickup or a full-sized SUV, Ford, GM and Stellantis could see some competition in their most profitable segments.” He said the bigger issue for the Detroit Three involves the price factor driven by exports from China. “Part of the Honda/Nissan collaboration is to bring down costs because the new players out of China have a price advantage. Tariffs can only hold off the competition for a little while before they become a crutch supporting the entire industry,” Fiorani said. Erik Gordon, a professor at the University of Michigan’s Ross School of Business who follows the auto industry, predicted that “the Detroit Three will face a stronger competitor that will be able to spread development costs across more vehicles and invest more in next-generation technologies.\" He added that “American consumers will be better off than they would be if Nissan shrinks or disappears.” The effect on consumers, however, may be hard to gauge for some time. Stephanie Brinley, an associate director at S&P Global Mobility, said it’s “far too soon to know the direct impact to consumers relative to the brands in the U.S.” She noted that offerings from Honda and Nissan overlap in most segments so they would be competing with themselves, and they will remain competitors until a merger is complete because of the nature of antitrust and securities law. Brinley pointed to a different competitor to show how the relationship might be managed in the United States. “Hyundai and Kia are both in the Hyundai Motor Group but operate quite independently when it comes to most U.S. activity, while products from both brands benefit from smart-platform, early product development and shared components. Those two brands have carved out enough space in the market, even as they compete in many of the same segments,” she said, noting that a merged company that creates a stronger competitor could ultimately mean lower market share for companies like Ford, GM and Stellantis. Something to watch would be in the vehicles and technology where Honda and Nissan would stand to gain the most from a merger. Ivan Drury, director of insights for Edmunds, said a merger of Honda and Nissan in that context could pose a serious challenge to the Detroit Three. \"Honda would gain access to segments it hasn’t traditionally pursued all that aggressively, while Nissan would leverage Honda’s hybrid technology to enhance its lineup. However, their opposing sales strategies — Honda’s avoidance of fleet sales and discounts versus Nissan’s heavy reliance on them — could cause friction,\" Drury said. \"If executed well, the merger could strengthen both automakers’ offerings in SUV, luxury and compact crossover categories. ... And if talks of reentering the more-affordable small and midsize sedan markets ever materialize, these two have that arena covered with models that have been in production for decades and spanning the range between grocery getter and hot hatchback.\" Still, Drury noted that \"despite potential synergies in filling gaps in each other's lineups, legacy baggage might hinder collaboration and limit the merger's success.\" David Whiston, auto analyst for Morningstar, pointed to some potential impacts on Detroit Three members down the road from a Honda-Nissan tie-up, but not in the short term. “It likely won’t mean any change of strategy for the Detroit Three anytime soon, if ever, given it’s uncertain how a combined Honda/Nissan works out. Not all auto mergers go well, as you know. Stellantis is already the byproduct of a huge acquisition,” he said. “If the Honda/Nissan deal was wildly successful (and that’s a big if, given their overlap), then GM and Ford get more isolated in terms of their size.” However, Whiston noted that partnerships are already in play. “GM is doing fine on its own though right now and is seeking its own cost-sharing alliance with Hyundai already. Ford has partnered with Volkswagen on a few things in the past,” he said. That GM-Hyundai deal, as the Free Press reported in September, could include co-development and production of passenger and commercial vehicles as well as sourcing of battery raw materials. David Kudla, CEO of Mainstay Capital Management, pointed to China’s rise “from near obscurity several decades ago to a dominant position in global auto industry market share,” and he said he expects more of that impact. “Their ability to produce low-cost vehicles continues to pressure other automakers. In the face of this, the global auto industry is consolidating, and we will see more team-ups like this, both strategic and out of necessity,” he said, noting Nissan’s sales struggles in particular. “With the amount of overlap in these Japanese companies and inherent problems, this merger is like two weak swimmers helping each other swim across the English Channel,” Kudla said. “But it may help both companies if they can realize more economies of scale and potentially some synergies as many automakers fight for survival against the China onslaught in an ever increasingly competitive global marketplace.” Karl Brauer, executive analyst with iSeeCars.com, said that if Honda and Nissan can effectively share resources, it would provide the scale needed to compete. “In the U.S. we can expect to see consolidation across vehicle platforms, drivetrains and even dealers to reduce costs. But while a merger always makes sense on paper, making one work in practice is never easy. It will be years before we know if this one was successful,” he said. And for the foreseeable future, the average consumer in middle America isn't likely to notice any impact from a merger, according to Erin Keating, an executive analyst at Cox Automotive. \"Honestly, I suspect a fair portion of the general population is not even aware that Nissan is the parent company of Infiniti, or that Acura is part of Honda,\" she said. Nissan's North American headquarters are in Nashville. University of Tennessee Boyd Center economist Don Bruce last week told The Tennesseean newspaper in Nashville that he saw potential if the merger occurred. \"Manufacturers are going to be a big part of changing consumer preferences and getting us to more of a fully developed network of electric vehicles,\" he said. \"Nissan being an established player, obviously, they're critical to the Tennessee automotive sector. Change facing the industry is \"a big, big issue for Tennessee, and I think Honda coming in, recognizing that strength and offering their strength as well, there's a lot of promise from this conversation should it end up coming to fruition.\" Contact Eric D.

        "NFL Draft order": [
            {
                "title": "2025 NFL Draft order: Panthers, Raiders wins shake up top 10 entering Week 17",
                "content": "Draft Analyst This is a look at the first-round order for the 2025 NFL Draft heading into Week 17 of the 2024 NFL season, along with the top five needs for each team. The order is determined by record, using strength of schedule as the first tiebreaker (click here to see a full list of the draft-order tiebreakers). Keep in mind -- teams that would make the playoffs if the season ended today are marked as PL (short for playoffs) in the order below. The draft order for playoff teams is determined by the results of postseason play. Arrows reflect movement from last week's order. Biggest needs: QB, OT, CB, OG, TE Remaining opponents: vs. Colts (7-8), at Eagles (12-3) The Giants' 10th straight loss, in combination with the Raiders' win over the Jags, strengthened New York's hold on the first pick -- in Round 1 and every subsequent round of the 2025 NFL Draft. This means that after the team presumably selects its new franchise QB on April 24, it will be in position to then address issues along its offensive line at the start of Days 2 or 3. Biggest needs: OT, CB, Edge, WR, IOL Remaining opponents: vs. Chargers (9-6), vs. Bills (12-3) The Patriots gave the Bills a good run in Buffalo on Sunday afternoon, but in dropping their fifth consecutive game, they remain in the hunt for the No. 1 overall pick. New England's SOS is well below New York's, meaning if both teams finished with the same record, the Pats would comfortably win the tie-breaker. Whether they are picking first, second or some place else in the top five, though, New England must target an elite OL prospect who can start on Day 1. The unit has been a disaster this season and needs an instant infusion of talent and depth. Biggest needs: CB, S, WR, IOL, QB Remaining opponents: vs. Titans (3-12), at Colts (7-8) Mac Jones will be a free agent this offseason, but even if he weren't, his play in relief of the injured Trevor Lawrence hasn't wowed enough to warrant retaining him as the team's No. 2 signal-caller. Jacksonville could find its new backup in the draft, using some extra Day 3 capital the team has acquired via trades to move up the board (perhaps in Rounds 3 or 4) for a promising prospect. Biggest needs: Edge, OT, WR, QB, RB Remaining opponents: vs. Dolphins (7-8), at Ravens (10-5) Dorian Thompson-Robinson's first start of the season did not go well on Sunday, so I think it’s fair to say the Browns will still be looking for an alternative to Deshaun Watson at quarterback this offseason. Cleveland should be thoroughly evaluating the 2025 QB class. Biggest needs: WR, QB, Edge, OT, S Remaining opponents: at Jaguars (3-12), vs. Texans (9-6) I wouldn't expect Tennessee to spend its first-round pick on a safety, but the back-end of the defense could definitely use an upgrade. Look for the Titans to address the position in free agency and in the middle rounds of April's draft. Biggest needs: QB, WR, CB, DT, RB Remaining opponents: at Saints (5-10), vs. Chargers (9-6) I doubt any of the Raiders players who were involved in Sunday's victory over the Jags were concerned the W cost them several spots in the 2025 draft order. But the win could have significant long-term implications for the franchise. In dropping from No. 2 overall to No. 6, and with an SOS much higher than the other three-win teams, Vegas might have to trade up if it wants to secure one of the top two passers in the 2025 class. While all the attention is justifiably on who will be the Raiders' next QB, the team also has to address its CB room, with multiple veterans entering free agency or contract years. Biggest needs: QB, DT, OT, S, CB Remaining opponents: at Bills (12-3), vs. Dolphins (7-8) First-round pick Olu Fashanu was carted off the field with a foot injury in the Jets' loss to the Rams on Sunday. It's unclear when the promising rookie will next be available, but whenever he's healthy, he's earned the right to bookend the O-line. The answer at the other tackle spot is far less certain, though. With Morgan Moses and Tyron Smith both due to hit free agency this spring, the Jets' new leadership could let former fourth-rounders Carter Warren (2023) and Max Mitchell (2022) compete at right tackle. But I suspect the team will target a starter-quality lineman in the 2025 draft and/or pay an established veteran in free agency. Biggest needs: Edge, WR, C, DT, QB Remaining opponents: at Buccaneers (8-7), at Falcons (8-7) A revitalized Bryce Young looks like the top candidate to lead the team in 2025, but he might need a new center. The Panthers lost starter Austin Corbett to a ruptured biceps tendon in early October, and he and backup Cade Mays both have expiring contracts. Unless both are re-signed, the team must find another pivot in the middle rounds of the draft. Biggest needs: OG, C, OT, Edge, WR Remaining opponents: vs. Seahawks (8-7), at Packers (11-4) The Bears should leave no stone unturned this offseason to bolster the offensive line, but they will also have to invest again in their WR room. DJ Moore and 2024 first-rounder Rome Odunze will be Caleb Williams' main targets in the pass game in 2025, but Keenan Allen is due to hit free agency after the season and 2023 fourth-rounder Tyler Scott has totaled only one catch for five yards this year. Slot receivers should be among the Bears' most sought-after prospects this spring. Biggest needs: Edge, WR, CB, S, TE Remaining opponents: vs. Raiders (3-12), at Buccaneers (8-7) ﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿Juwan Johnson﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿ is an impending free agent, while ﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿Foster Moreau﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿ and Taysom Hill, who suffered a season-ending knee injury on Dec. 1, both only have one year left on their respective deals. Finding a pass-catching tight end must be a priority for the team on Day 3 of the draft -- if not earlier. Biggest needs: CB, OG, DT, LB, OT Remaining opponents: vs. Lions (13-2), at Cardinals (7-8) The 49ers' defense has missed Javon Hargrave since he suffered a triceps injury in September and the team will need to address the defensive tackle spot this offseason. San Francisco traded for impending free agent Khalil Davis in November, which highlighted the squad’s lack of young talent up front, something that should be rectified late on Day 2 or early on Day 3 of the 2025 draft. Biggest needs: S, OG, DT, LB, QB Remaining opponents: at Browns (3-12), at Jets (4-11) The Dolphins should either re-sign or sign at least one veteran linebacker in March, but another LB should be selected in the draft. Anthony Walker, Tyrel Dodson and Duke Riley are ticketed for free agency, and 2022 third-round pick Channing Tindall has just four tackles in nine games this season. Biggest needs: CB, WR, OT, RB, TE Remaining opponents: vs. Broncos (9-6), at Steelers (10-5) Considering Ja'Marr Chase will be entering a contract year in 2025, it might be tough to pay impending free agent Tee Higgins his market value, although Joe Burrow recently said he’s confident the Bengals will bring Higgins back. I wouldn’t be surprised if the team picks a receiver in the first three rounds should Higgins depart. Biggest needs: RB, DT, CB, OG, LB Remaining opponents: at Eagles (12-3), vs. Commanders (10-5) Given that Jourdan Lewis, Israel Mukuamu and Amani Oruwariye could depart in free agency, the Cowboys may need to pick up another nickel or outside corner in April. DaRon Bland will be in the last year of his deal next fall, too. Biggest needs: CB, IOL, TE, LB, S Remaining opponents: at Giants (2-13), vs. Jaguars (3-12) Zaire Franklin is signed long-term, but he needs one or two partners to fill out the depth chart at linebacker for the Colts. Starter E.J. Speed, who missed Week 16 with a knee injury, is due to become a free agent in 2025, as is Grant Stuard. Biggest needs: Edge, WR, OG, DT, OT Remaining opponents: at Rams (9-6), vs. 49ers (6-9) The Arizona defensive front will need reinforcements in the offseason with first-round pick Darius Robinson still acclimating to the pros after missing most of the season due to injury. D-linemen Roy Lopez and L.J. Collier are among the team’s impending free agents. Biggest needs: LB, QB, OG, OT, DT Remaining opponents: at Bears (4-11), at Rams (9-6) The Seahawks will need to address the offensive line in 2025. Starting left guard Laken Tomlinson is due to hit free agency after the season. Recent draft picks Christian Haynes, Sataoa Laumea and Anthony Bradford will likely find another rookie joining the competition for snaps at guard. Biggest needs: WR, OG, LB, Edge, OT Remaining opponents: vs. Panthers (4-11), vs. Saints (5-10) Tampa Bay can build around Calijah Kancey and Vita Vea on the interior, but the team would undoubtedly benefit from adding more explosiveness off the edge. Joe Tryon-Shoyinka and Anthony Nelson are headed to free agency, so 2024 second-round pick Chris Braswell and another middle-round pick could join Yaya Diaby to form a rotation on the outside. Biggest needs: C, S, CB, Edge, WR Remaining opponents: at Commanders (10-5), vs. Panthers (4-11) Biggest needs: LB, TE, WR, S, OT Remaining opponents: at Bengals (7-8), vs. Chiefs (14-1) Biggest needs: OG, DT, CB, WR, OT Remaining opponents: vs. Ravens (10-5), at Titans (3-12) Biggest needs: Edge, DT, C, S, WR Remaining opponents: at Patriots (3-12), at Raiders (3-12) Biggest needs: OT, CB, WR, LB, OG Remaining opponents: vs. Cardinals (7-8), vs. Seahawks (8-7) Biggest needs: Edge, OT, WR, LB, CB Remaining opponents: vs. Falcons (8-7), at Cowboys (7-8) Biggest needs: QB, CB, RB, WR, OT Remaining opponents: vs. Chiefs (14-1), vs. Bengals (7-8) Biggest needs: OT, WR, Edge, OG, CB Remaining opponents: at Texans (9-6), vs. Browns (3-12) Biggest needs: CB, OT, DT, C, Edge Remaining opponents: at Vikings (13-2), vs. Bears (4-11) Biggest needs: WR, Edge, LB, TE, OG Remaining opponents: vs. Cowboys (7-8), vs. Giants (2-13) Biggest needs: Edge, DT, WR, CB, S Remaining opponents: vs. Jets (4-11), at Patriots (3-12) Biggest needs: CB, DT, RB, OG, OT Remaining opponents: vs. Packers (11-4), at Lions (13-2) Biggest needs: Edge, CB, WR, OG, DT Remaining opponents: at 49ers (6-9), vs. Vikings (13-2) Biggest needs: CB, WR, DT, OG, OT Remaining opponents: at Steelers (10-5), at Broncos (9-6) The Raiders are closing in on the No. 1 overall pick in the 2025 NFL Draft heading into Week 16.

                "content": "If not listed, please contact your TV provider. The New York Giants (2-13) are back on top of the 2025 NFL Draft order after suffering their 10th straight defeat, this time to rookie quarterback Michael Penix Jr. and the Atlanta Falcons. And with two weeks to play, they control their own destiny for the No. 1 pick. Behind New York are the New England Patriots, who fought valiantly against the Buffalo Bills but came up three points short. After that, it's the Jacksonville Jaguars, Tennessee Titans and Cleveland Browns -- all of whom also suffered defeats Sunday afternoon. The Las Vegas Raiders, who held the No. 1 pick entering Week 16, moved down to No. 6 after defeating the Jaguars for their third win of the season. There's now a chance that the Raiders, one of the most quarterback-needy teams in the NFL, will miss out on one of the top prospects, namely Miami's Cam Ward and Colorado's Shedeur Sanders.

The league is in the final stretch of the season, with most of the Week 16 action concluded. Playoff spots continue to get snatched up left and right, while other clubs are eliminated from the postseason. For those not looking forward to the playoffs, the focus is on the NFL draft. The Raiders entered Week 16 at No. 1 in the draft order, but that has since changed. Las Vegas picked up its third win of the season on Sunday, defeating the Jaguars on the road to improve to 3-12. It dropped the team out of the top spot in the draft order, moving Vegas down to No. 6. With the loss, it moved the Jaguars to the No. 3 spot in the draft. As a result, the Giants are the only team left with just two wins on the season, moving them to the very top of the draft board. New York did its part in order to stay in the hunt for the top pick in the draft, suffering a blowout loss at the hands of Atlanta, and they now are in the driver's seat to pick first in the 2025 NFL Draft. Elsewhere, the Titans, Browns, and Patriots all lost in Week 16, keeping their chances at the top pick alive with just weeks of regular season play remaining. The Cowboys hurt their cause by beating the Buccaneers on Sunday, likely falling out of contention for a top-10 pick. Here's a look at how the NFL Draft order looks after Week 16 action. NFL HQ: Live NFL scores | Updated NFL standings | Full NFL schedule NFL DRAFT NEWS: Here's a look at the top 10 NFL Draft prospects, based on our own Vinnie Iyer's latest 2025 big board: There is no shortage of talent expected to headline the 2025 NFL Draft. However, two names come from the same program: Two-way star Travis Hunter and quarterback Shedeur Sanders. Hunter, who plays both wide receiver and cornerback, was just named the winner of the 2024 Heisman Trophy race. While he's expected to commit to one side of the ball in the NFL, he has shown his ability to make an impact both on offense and defense. Sanders is potentially going to be one of the first quarterbacks taken in the draft, joining Miami's Cam Ward and Alabama's Jalen Milroe as QBs expected to go toward the top of the board. Heisman Trophy runner-up Ashton Jeanty out of Boise State put together one of the greatest rushing seasons ever in college. He is undoubtedly the top running back in the draft, and where he is selected will be a hot topic leading up to draft day. Defensively, a trio of Big Ten players will likely headline the 2025 draft class: Michigan's duo of DL Mason Graham and CB Will Johnson, plus Penn State edge rusher Abdul Carter.

Each Book is arranged in paragraphs, with each paragraph headed by the corresponding line reference in the Greek text. The Odyssey, the second of the epic texts attributed to Homer, and also a major founding work of European literature, is usually dated to around the 8th century BC. It is an epic poem, effectively a sequel to the Iliad, written in Ancient Greek but assumed to be derived from earlier oral sources, telling the story of Odysseus’ wanderings and his eventual return from the Trojan War to his home island of Ithaca. The cultural background to the poem indicates a Bronze Age setting around 400 to 500 years before the Homeric literary period itself. The poem contains elements of myth and legend as well as sheer literary invention, and covers the ten years of its hero’s adventures from the destruction of Troy to his return to his wife Penelope and son Telemachus. Of particular interest is the role of women in the Bronze Age culture described, represented in a sense by Odysseus’ guardian deity, Athene, the goddess of mind. Odysseus is an archetype of the person of intellect who uses brains and eloquence rather than brawn to outwit opponents and impress peers, and therefore sets the scene for later Greek Classical culture. The true authorship and dating of the Odyssey and the other great poem attributed to Homer, the Iliad, has been much disputed. The consistency of language and treatment lends itself to the view that a single author Homer created, or at least consolidated and edited, the literary material. This was the view of ancient Greek authorities, though they differ widely on the question of who Homer was, and at what period he lived. Many mythical elements gathered around the name Homer, until the image of a blind bard from the island of Chios gained prominence, despite there being no evidence of his blindness or his bardic wanderings, and despite many places claiming to have been his birthplace or residence. Equally there is no absolutely definitive text rather the currently accepted text is the result of the work of many editors over a long period of time, from at least the 3rd century BC to modern times. There is much fascinating and erudite scholarship concerning the Homeric ethos, involving literary, linguistic, cultural, archaeological, and other evidence, and debate is ongoing. However the issue of literary authorship in no way detracts from the power and integrity of the epic poems themselves. Translated by A. S.

                "content": "Walker Anthony Buehler (born July 28, 1994) is an American professional baseball pitcher who is a free agent. He has previously played for the Los Angeles Dodgers. Buehler played college baseball for the Vanderbilt Commodores and was a member of their 2014 College World Series championship team. He was selected by the Dodgers 24th overall in the 2015 MLB draft and made his MLB debut in 2017. Buehler was an All-Star in 2019 and 2021 and helped the Dodgers win the 2020 and 2024 World Series, earning the series-clinching save in the latter. Walker Anthony Buehler was born on July 28, 1994, in Lexington, Kentucky. Buehler attended Henry Clay High School in Lexington.[1] He was drafted by the Pittsburgh Pirates in the 14th round of the 2012 Major League Baseball Draft, but did not sign and instead honored his commitment to Vanderbilt University.[2] As a freshman in 2013, he made 9 starts and appeared in 16 games. He had a 4–3 record with a 3.14 earned run average (ERA) and 57 strikeouts. As a sophomore, he went 12–2 with 111 strikeouts and a 2.64 ERA and was a member of the 2014 College World Series championship team.[3][4][5] On June 16, 2014, Buehler pitched 5+1⁄3 innings of no-hit relief, retiring the first nine batters he faced and striking out seven batters in Vanderbilt's win over University of California Irvine.[6] After the 2014 season Buehler played for Team USA[7] and the Yarmouth–Dennis Red Sox of the Cape Cod Baseball League (CCBL).[8] He posted a 0.63 earned run average with 24 strikeouts over 28+2⁄3 innings pitched for the Red Sox.[9] In the 2014 CCBL playoffs, he did not allow a run in 15+1⁄3 innings, won both of his starts, and was a co-winner of MVP honors,[10] leading the Red Sox to the league championship.[11] In 2015, as a junior he posted a 2.95 ERA in 88+1⁄3 innings for the Commodores while striking out 92 and walking 30.[12] Over the course of his three-year college career, he went 21–7 with a 2.87 ERA in 51 games, striking out 260 against only 86 walks.[12] Buehler was selected by the Los Angeles Dodgers with the 24th overall selection of the 2015 Major League Baseball draft[13] and signed on July 17, 2015, for a $1.78 million bonus.[14] Soon after his signing, it was revealed that he would require Tommy John surgery and would therefore be sidelined for a year and a half with recovery.[15] He finally made his professional baseball debut on August 23, 2016, for the Arizona League Dodgers, striking out three and retiring all six batters he faced.[16] He was then promoted to the Great Lakes Loons of the Midwest League on August 28.[17] He appeared in two games for the Loons, making one start, and did not allow a run or a hit in the three innings he pitched.[18] Buehler began the 2017 season with the Rancho Cucamonga Quakes of the California League and allowed only three runs in 16+1⁄3 innings over five starts before he was promoted to the Double-A Tulsa Drillers of the Texas League on May 2.[19] While with the Drillers, he made 11 starts with a 3.49 ERA and was selected to appear in the mid-season Texas League all-star game.[20] He was promoted to the Triple-A Oklahoma City Dodgers at mid-season[21] where he made three starts before transitioning to the bullpen in preparation for a potential September major league callup.[22] He had a 4.63 ERA in 23+1⁄3 innings for Oklahoma City.[23] At the end of the season, he was selected as the Dodgers minor league pitcher of the year.[24] The Dodgers added Buehler to the major league roster for the first time on September 6, 2017,[25] and he made his major league debut that night with two scoreless innings of relief against the Colorado Rockies. His first MLB strikeout was against Charlie Blackmon of the Rockies.[26] He picked up his first major league win with a scoreless inning of relief against the Philadelphia Phillies on September 21.[27] Overall, Buehler appeared in eight Dodgers games in 2017, allowing eight runs in 9+1⁄3 innings (7.71 ERA) with 12 strikeouts and eight walks.[28] Buehler made his first major league start on April 23, 2018, against the Miami Marlins, pitching five scoreless innings.[29] On May 4, against the San Diego Padres, he took a no-hitter through six innings, with eight strikeouts, until being taken out of the game after 93 pitches. Three relief pitchers combined to finish it off as the Dodgers won 4–0, the first combined no-hitter in franchise history.[30] He was placed on the disabled list on June 21 because of a rib injury.[31] He returned to make an appearance out of the bullpen on June 28 but allowed five earned runs in one inning before returning to the disabled list.[32] On July 13, Buehler made his first start in over a month against the Los Angeles Angels, allowing two solo home runs to Kole Calhoun but no other earned runs.[33] He set a new career high in strikeouts with nine on August 22.[34] After three more nine-strikeout starts, he struck out 12 on September 19 against the Colorado Rockies.[35] On October 1, Buehler started the NL West Tie-Breaker Game against the Colorado Rockies. He picked up the win, giving up only one hit and allowing no runner to advance past second base. He also got his first career MLB run batted in in his 47th plate appearance.[36] In 24 appearances for the Dodgers (23 starts and one relief appearance) in 2018, Buehler was 8–5 with a 2.62 ERA and 151 strikeouts.[28] In the 2018 NLDS against the Atlanta Braves, he started one game and allowed five runs in five innings; in the 2018 NLCS against the Milwaukee Brewers he started two games, allowing five runs in 11+2⁄3 innings; and he threw seven scoreless innings in Game 3 of the 2018 World Series against the Boston Red Sox.[28] Buehler finished third in voting for the National League Rookie of the Year, behind Atlanta Braves outfielder Ronald Acuña Jr. and Washington Nationals outfielder Juan Soto.[37] On April 11, Buehler hit his first career home run off of Michael Wacha of the St. Louis Cardinals.[38] On June 21, he threw his first complete game against the Colorado Rockies, becoming the first Dodger pitcher with over 15 strikeouts and no walks. He struck out 16 Rockies, giving up three hits on 111 pitches.[39] He was selected to the 2019 MLB All-Star Game, his first all-star appearance, in which he gave up one run in one inning.[40] On August 3, Buehler pitched another complete game, against the San Diego Padres. He struck out 15 Padre hitters and walked none; San Diego's only run was a Manuel Margot solo home run. At the same time he became only the third pitcher in MLB history (after Dwight Gooden and Pedro Martínez) with multiple games with 15 strikeouts and no walks in the same season.[41] Buehler finished the 2019 regular season with a record of 14–4, and a 3.26 ERA (9th in the NL) in 30 starts, with two complete games and 215 strikeouts.[28] His .778 win–loss percentage was the best in the league, and he also led the league in complete games with two.[28] He finished ninth in the Cy Young Award voting.[28] Buehler was named the Dodgers' game one starter for the NLDS. He allowed only one hit in six scoreless innings while striking out eight and walking three to pick up the win.[42] He also started the deciding fifth game of the series, allowing only one run in 6+2⁄3 innings while striking out seven in a game the Dodgers eventually lost in extra innings.[43] In the pandemic-shortened 2020 season, Buehler posted a 1–0 record with a 3.44 ERA in eight starts, striking out 42 batters in 36.2 innings.[28] Buehler started the first games of the first and second round playoff series against the Milwaukee Brewers and San Diego Padres, pitching just four innings in each game, with three total runs allowed.[28] In the NLCS against the Atlanta Braves, he started the first and sixth games, working a total of 11 innings with only one run allowed while striking out 13. He was the winning pitcher in game 6.[44] In the third game of the 2020 World Series, Buehler picked up the win against the Tampa Bay Rays, striking out 10 in six innings while allowing one earned run on three hits. He was the third-youngest pitcher with 10 or more strikeouts and three or fewer hits in a World Series game, behind only Ed Walsh in 1906 and Josh Beckett in 2003.[45] The Dodgers won the World Series in six games.[46] Buehler was eligible for salary arbitration for the first time before the 2021 season. On February 10, he signed a two-year contract with the Dodgers for $8 million.[47] On June 20, Buehler won his seventh game of the season, tying Kirby Higbe for the Dodgers franchise record of 23 consecutive starts without a loss, going back to the 2019 season.[48][49] He was a 2021 National League All Star,[50] and the July 2021 NL Pitcher of the Month.[51] Buehler was 16–4 (.800; 2nd in the NL) in the 2021 regular season, with a 2.47 ERA (3rd) and 212 strikeouts (7th). His 16 wins were 3rd in the league. He gave up 6.458 hits per 9 innings (2nd in the NL), and had a WHIP of 0.968 (4th).[28] Buehler started the first game of the 2021 NLDS against the San Francisco Giants, allowing three runs on 6+1⁄3 innings to take the loss.[52] He then started Game 4 on short rest, the first time he had done that in his career. In the game, he allowed one run on three hits in 4+1⁄3 innings.[53] He struggled in his first start in the 2021 NLCS, allowing four runs on six hits while walking three in 3+2⁄3 innings in game 3.[54] He again pitched on short rest in game 6 after Max Scherzer was unable to go, he allowed seven hits and four runs (three of them on a home run by Eddie Rosario) in four innings while striking out six as the Dodgers were eliminated from the playoffs.[55] Buehler made his first Opening Day start on April 8 for the Dodgers against the Rockies.[56] He allowed two runs in five innings to record the win.[57] On April 25, he pitched his first career shutout against the Arizona Diamondbacks, striking out 10 batters and allowing only three hits and no walks.[58] Buehler made 12 starts for the Dodgers in 2022, with a 6–3 record and 4.02 ERA.[28] He left a game with the Giants on June 10 because of discomfort in his pitching elbow, and had arthroscopic surgery in June to remove bone spurs in his elbow.[59][60] This eventually resulted in him undergoing season-ending surgery on his right arm in August 2022.[61] After his surgery was performed, the Dodgers announced that Buehler underwent both his second Tommy John surgery in which his ulnar collateral ligament was replaced, as well as flexor tendon repair, likely keeping him sidelined until the 2024 season.[62][63] Despite his injury, the Dodgers signed him to an $8.025 million contract for the 2023 season to avoid salary arbitration.[64] Buehler and the Dodgers initially hoped he would be able to rejoin the team in September and possibly for the postseason. However, after one two-inning minor league rehab appearance the team announced that he would not return in 2023 and hoped to be back for the start of the 2024 season.[65] After missing all of the 2023 season, Buehler signed a one-year, $8.025 million contract for 2024 in his final year of arbitration, matching his salary from the previous season.[66] Buehler was activated from the injured list on May 6 and made his first start in almost two years.[67][68] In the weeks after returning from his injury, Buehler struggled and recorded a 5.84 ERA in 37 innings pitched. After a rough outing on June 18 in which he surrendered seven earned runs in four innings to the Colorado Rockies, Buehler returned to the injured list with a hip injury.[69][70] Concerned about his performance, Buehler left the team to work out by himself at a private sports facility in Florida[71] before rejoining Oklahoma City for another rehab stint, with mixed results.[72] The Dodgers activated him on August 14 for his first major league start in almost two months, and he again struggled, leading him to say that he was not meeting his standard of performance.[73] He remained in the Dodgers rotation the rest of the season, making 16 starts and finishing with a 1–6 record and 5.38 ERA.[28] Buehler made his first postseason start since 2021 in Game 3 of the NLDS, allowing six runs on seven hits in five innings.[74] He did a better job in his next start, Game 3 of the NLCS, when he struck out six in four scoreless innings.[75] In Game 3 of the World Series, he struck out five while only allowing two hits in five scoreless innings.[76] In Game 5, Buehler pitched the ninth inning on only one day of rest, inducing a groundout and then striking out the final two batters of the game to pick up the save as the Dodgers clinched the World Series championship.[77] Buehler has heard the famous roll call scene from the 1986 film Ferris Bueller's Day Off many times throughout his life.[78] Buehler embraced the nickname \"Ferris,\" incorporating it into his Twitter handle and wearing it on his jersey during the 2018 MLB Players Weekend.[79] He chose to wear the nickname \"Buetane\"[80] for the 2019 MLB Players Weekend.[81] Buehler is a native of Lexington, Kentucky, the \"Horse Capital of the World,\" home to the Kentucky Horse Park, The Red Mile and Keeneland race courses, and grew up a big fan of horse racing. He has a minority ownership stake in 2020 Kentucky Derby and 2020 Breeders' Cup Classic winner Authentic, trained by Bob Baffert.[82] Buehler attended the 2020 Breeders' Cup Classic to see Authentic win at Keeneland. Buehler is married to McKenzie Marcinek, whom he began dating in high school, and the couple reside in Lexington.[83]",

                "content": "If not listed, please contact your TV provider. Veteran right-hander Walker Buehler has agreed to terms with the Boston Red Sox on a one-year deal worth $21.05 million in free agency, per multiple reports. Most recently, Buehler recorded the final out of the 2024 World Series for the champion Los Angeles Dodgers. The $21.05 million figure is the exact amount as this year's qualifying offer, which the Dodgers did not extend Buehler after the 2024 season. Buehler, 30, struggled during the regular season, his first campaign back from his second Tommy John surgery. In 16 starts for the Dodgers, he put up an ERA of 5.38 and an FIP of 5.54. Across 75 ⅓ innings, Buehler struck out 64 batters and allowed 16 home runs. As recently as 2021, however, Buehler looked like an ace in the making. That year he had a 2.47 ERA in more than 200 innings of work and finished fourth in the National League Cy Young vote. During the Dodgers' run to the title in October, Buehler showed some flashes of that old self. CBS Sports' R.J. Anderson looked into the reasons why Buehler could be a smart, high-upside signing earlier this month. Buehler had a 3.60 ERA in four playoff appearances (15 innings). He made three starts and then and got a save with a perfect ninth inning against the Yankees in the title-clinching World Series Game 5. Earlier in the offseason, CBS Sports ranked Buehler as the No. 26 available free agent in the current class. Here's part of our write-up: Buehler feels like this winter's version of Luis Severino: a once-promising right-hander with an injury history and a dismal walk year (at least in the regular season) to his name. As with Severino, the pitch-grading models are a lot sweeter on Buehler's arsenal than you might suspect they would be based on his poor results. Depending on which one you consult with, Buehler -- who closed out the World Series -- is estimated to have three or four above-average pitches. For his career, Buehler has an ERA+ of 125 and a WAR of 12.2 across parts of seven major-league seasons -- all were with the Dodgers. With Boston, Buehler figures to join a rotation that's newly fronted by lefty Garrett Crochet, whom the Red Sox acquired via trade with the White Sox earlier this offseason. Tanner Houck, Brayan Bello, and Kutter Crawford also figure to be in the mix, pending other additions by Boston. As well, the Red Sox at various points during the 2025 season will be getting back starters who underwent Tommy John surgery or the internal-brace procedure this year -- Lucas Giolito, Chris Murphy, and the recently signed Patrick Sandoval. The Red Sox are coming off an 81-81 season in 2024 and a third-place finish in the American League East. They haven't made the postseason since 2021. © 2004-2024 CBS Interactive. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.

                "content": "DOWNLOAD OUR APPS The Boston Red Sox have added Walker Buehler, the right-handed pitcher and World Series champion, to their roster for the 2025 season. He signed a one-year contract worth $21.05 million, as reported Monday by the official MLB.com website. The deal with Buehler, who won the World Series last season with the Los Angeles Dodgers, also includes performance bonuses that could increase the total value of the contract. With this addition, the Red Sox continue to focus on strengthening their pitching staff during the Major League Baseball offseason. Key reinforcement for the Red Sox pitching staff With Buehler on board, the team adds a strong arm to their rotation, alongside Cuban closer Aroldis Chapman and starting pitchers Garrett Crochet and Mexican Patrick Sandoval. This move gives Puerto Rican manager Alex Cora more options to build a solid starting rotation for the 2025 season. The Red Sox’ rotation could include Buehler, Crochet, Dominican Brayan Bello, Lucas Giolito, Kutter Crawford, Tanner Houck, and Sandoval, who is still recovering from left elbow surgery. Buehler’s comeback after a tough recovery Buehler played seven seasons with the Dodgers, where, despite battling various injuries and undergoing Tommy John surgery on his pitching elbow, he showed great quality on the mound. In 131 games, 122 of them as a starter, he posted a 3.27 ERA, with a record of 47 wins and 22 losses, and 754 strikeouts in 713.2 innings. Although his first year after elbow surgery was rough, with a 1-6 record and a 5.38 ERA, Buehler bounced back in the postseason, posting a 1-1 record, a save, and a 3.60 ERA in four appearances, three of them as a starter. Success in the postseason Throughout his career, Buehler has been a key factor in the postseason, with a 4-4 record and a 3.04 ERA in 19 games. He was instrumental in the Dodgers winning World Series titles in 2020 and 2024, with a 2-0 record and a 0.47 ERA in the finals. Despite playing at Fenway Park in Boston, a hitter-friendly stadium, the Red Sox are confident that Buehler will be able to leverage his impressive 9.5 strikeouts per nine innings to continue proving his quality on the mound.

                "title": "Crocodile Dundee - Wikipedia",
                "content": "Crocodile Dundee is a 1986 Australian-American action comedy film set in the Australian Outback and in New York City. It stars Paul Hogan as the weathered Mick Dundee, and American actress Linda Kozlowski as reporter Sue Charlton.[6] Inspired by the true-life exploits of Rod Ansell, the film was made on a budget of under $10 million as a deliberate attempt to make a commercial Australian film that would appeal to a mainstream American audience, but proved to be a worldwide phenomenon. Released on 30 April 1986 in Australia, and on 26 September in the United States, it was the highest-grossing film of all time in Australia, the highest-grossing Australian film worldwide, the second-highest-grossing film in the United States in 1986, the highest-grossing non-US film at the US box office ever and the second-highest-grossing film worldwide for the year. There are two versions of the film: the Australian version, and an international version, which had much of the Australian slang replaced with more commonly understood terms, and was slightly shorter. As the first film in the Crocodile Dundee film series, it was followed by two sequels: Crocodile Dundee II (1988) and Crocodile Dundee in Los Angeles (2001), although both films failed to match the critical success of the original. Sue Charlton is a feature writer for her father's newspaper Newsday, and is dating the editor Richard Mason. She travels to Walkabout Creek, a small township in the Northern Territory of Australia, to meet Michael J. \"Crocodile\" Dundee, a bushman reported to have lost half a leg to a saltwater crocodile before crawling hundreds of miles to safety. On arrival in Walkabout Creek, she cannot locate Dundee, but she is entertained at the local pub by Dundee's business partner Walter \"Wally\" Reilly. When Dundee arrives that night, Sue finds his leg is not missing, but he has a large scar which he refers to as a \"love bite\". While Sue dances with Dundee, a group of city kangaroo shooters make fun of Dundee's status as a crocodile hunter, causing him to knock the leader out with one punch. At first, Sue finds Dundee less \"legendary\" than she had been led to believe, unimpressed by his pleasant-mannered but uncouth behaviour and clumsy advances towards her. She is later amazed, when in the outback, she witnesses \"Mick\" (as Dundee is called) subduing a water buffalo, taking part in an Aboriginal (Pitjantjatjara) tribal dance ceremony, killing a snake with his bare hands, and scaring away the kangaroo shooters by tricking them into thinking one of the kangaroos is shooting back. The next morning, offended by Mick's assertion that as a \"sheila\" she is incapable of surviving the Outback alone, Sue goes out alone to prove him wrong but takes his rifle with her at his request. Mick follows her to make sure she is okay, but when she stops at a billabong to fill her canteen with water, she is attacked by a large crocodile and is rescued by Mick. Overcome with gratitude, Sue finds herself becoming attracted to him. Sue invites Mick to return with her to New York City on the pretext of continuing the feature story. At first Wally scoffs at her suggestion, but he changes his mind when she tells him the newspaper would cover all expenses. Once in New York, Mick is perplexed by local behaviour and customs but overcomes problematic situations including encounters with a pimp and attempted robberies. After this Sue realises her true feelings for him, and they kiss. At a society dinner at her father's home in honour of Sue's safe return and of Mick's visit, Richard proposes marriage to Sue, and in a haze of confused emotions, she initially accepts in spite of Richard's having recently revealed his self-centered and insensitive \"true colours\" during a period of intoxication. Mick, disheartened at Sue's engagement, decides to go \"walkabout\" around the United States, but Sue has a change of heart and, deciding not to marry Richard, follows Mick to a subway station. There, she cannot reach him through the crowd on the platform, but has members of the crowd relay her message to him, whereupon he climbs up to the rafters and walks to Sue on the heads and raised hands of the onlookers and kisses her, to the delight of the crowd, where they receive a round of applause. The film also featured a saltwater crocodile named Burt, who died in 2024, estimated to have lived over 90 years.[7] The idea to make the film came to Paul Hogan (the lead actor and one of the story writers) when he was in New York. He wondered what it would be like if a Northern Territory bushman arrived in town. As Paul Hogan said: There's a lot about Dundee that we all think we're like; but we're not, because we live in Sydney. He's a mythical outback Australian who does exist in part—the frontiersman who walks through the bush, picking up snakes and throwing them aside, living off the land, who can ride horses and chop down trees and has that simple, friendly, laid-back philosophy. It's like the image the Americans have of us, so why not give them one? ... We've always been desperately short of folk heroes in this country. Ned Kelly is pathetic. So are the bushrangers.[8] The film's budget was raised through the 10BA tax concessions via Morgan Sharebrokers. Paul Hogan used his regular collaborators from TV, including John Cornell, Peter Faiman and Ken Shadie. Linda Kozlowski was imported to play the American reporter; Actors' Equity Australia objected to this but eventually relented.[8] Principal photography began on 13 July 1985.[9] The first scenes were filmed in the small town of McKinlay in Queensland, where the hotel used has original warped and polished hardwood floors. Production decided to shoot in Kakadu National Park at the end of the dry season since crocodiles were less active in the filming locations. Areas such as Gunlom Falls, also known as the UDP Falls back in the 1980s, are also featured in the movie. The crocodile attack scene was filmed in Girraween Lagoon, just out of Darwin. Six weeks of filming were spent working out of Jaja, an abandoned uranium mining camp in Kakadu National Park in the Northern Territory with an additional week in Cloncurry. There was a further six weeks filming in New York City (including Newark Liberty International Airport, which serves the city).[4] Filming wrapped on 11 October 1985.[10] When the filming finished, Hogan said he expected it would make millions of dollars around the world. Hogan also said of the film: \"I'm planning for it to be Australia's first proper movie. I don't think we've had one yet—not a real, general public, successful, entertaining movie\".[11] Crocodile Dundee was offered to 20th Century Fox and Warner Bros. for North American release before Paramount picked it up for US$6 million.[12] Crocodile Dundee remains the single most-viewed Christmas Day film or programme in the United Kingdom when it debuted on 25 December 1989 on BBC One, with an audience of 21.8 million.[13][14] Crocodile Dundee opened with a record A$2,047,026 in its first week in Australia.[15] It went on to gross A$47,707,045 at the box office in Australia[16] and was the highest-grossing film of all time there after 11 weeks, surpassing E.T. The Extra-Terrestrial.[17] A number of minor changes were made to the film for its US release,[4][18] where it was released theatrically by Paramount Pictures in September 1986. The film debuted at number 1 grossing US$8 million in its opening weekend,[19][20] and it remained at number one for nine weeks.[21] It grossed US$174,803,506 at the U.S. and Canadian box office,[5] being the second-highest-grossing film that year for both the studio and at the United States box office.[22] Box Office Mojo estimates that the film sold over 46 million tickets in North America.[23] It was the highest-grossing film in New Zealand, with a gross of $5.1 million; it was also the highest-grossing in Ireland, with a gross of $2.8 million.[24][25] The film was the highest-grossing non-American film at the US box office.[17] The film was a sleeper hit, grossing US$328 million[5] and surpassing Mad Max 2 as the highest-grossing Australian film at the worldwide box office.[17] On Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 89% based on 37 reviews, and an average rating of 6.8/10. The critics' consensus reads: \"Infectiously easygoing charm and a leading man in the role he was born to play help Crocodile Dundee make the most of its familiar fish-out-of-water premise\".[26] On Metacritic the film has a score of 62 out of 100 based on reviews from 13 critics, indicating \"generally favorable reviews\".[27] Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average rating of \"B+\" on an A+ to F scale.[28] Roger Ebert gave the film 2 stars out of 4 and wrote: \"All of the cliches are in the right places, most of the gags pay off and there are moments of real amusement as the Australian cowboy wanders around Manhattan as a naive sightseer. The problem is that there's not one moment of chemistry between the two stars: Paul Hogan as 'Crocodile' Dundee and Linda Kozlowski as the clever little rich girl. The movie feels curiously machine-made, as if they had all the right ingredients and simply forgot to add the animal magnetism\".[29] Nina Darnton of The New York Times thought that Paul Hogan was \"delightful\" in the title role, that the screenplay was \"witty, with a fine sense of irony and the gift at poking fun at its own conceits\", and that \"Linda Kozlowski plays the reporter, Sue, very well\", virtues which \"go a long way toward compensating for the film's illogical plot and set-up situations\".[30] Variety stated that director Peter Faiman \"has problems with the pacing and a script (by Hogan and longtime TV colleague Ken Shadie) that has its flat, dull spots. Hogan is comfortable enough playing the wry, irreverent, amiable Aussie that seems close to his own persona, and teams well with Kozlowski, who radiates lots of charm, style and spunk\".[31] Dave Kehr of the Chicago Tribune gave the film 3 stars out of 4 and wrote: \"Handsomely directed by Peter Faiman, the film punches most of the right buttons at most of the right times and emerges as an effective crowd-pleaser\".[32][33] Paul Attanasio of The Washington Post said that the film \"has a double 'fish out of water' structure—first she's the fish, then he's the fish—but the movie doesn't go anywhere with it, mostly because the characters are such nullities ... There's no drama in 'Crocodile Dundee' because there's no real conflict between these characters\".[34] Michael Wilmington of the Los Angeles Times wrote that the film \"is nothing you can examine deeply or mull over afterward. It's simply an expert crowd-pleaser. It has such a sure, easy, confident touch that it's almost failure-proof—like a tip of the hat, a sip of beer, a quick, golden 'G'day'\".[35][36] Monthly Film Bulletin called it \"as dull and lumbering as its hero\".[37] Although Crocodile Dundee was a hit both in Australia and abroad, it became controversial with some Australian critics and audiences who resented the image of Australians as being ocker.[38] Robert Hughes complained in 2000 that to Americans \"Crocodile Dundee is a work of social realism\", giving them a \"'Wild West' fantasy\" about Australia.[39] David Droga said in 2018, however, that \"there has been no better ad for Australia than that movie\".[40] The film became the first in the Crocodile Dundee series, with two sequels and a Super Bowl commercial.[40] A sequel titled Crocodile Dundee II was released in 1988. A second sequel titled Crocodile Dundee in Los Angeles was released in 2001.",

                "content": "The New York Knickerbockers,[4][9] shortened and more commonly referred to as the New York Knicks, are an American professional basketball team based in the New York City borough of Manhattan. The Knicks compete in the National Basketball Association (NBA) as a member of the Atlantic Division of the Eastern Conference. The team plays its home games at Madison Square Garden, an arena they share with the New York Rangers of the National Hockey League (NHL). They are one of two NBA teams located in New York City; the other team is the Brooklyn Nets. Alongside the Boston Celtics, the Knicks are one of two original NBA teams still located in its original city. The team, established by Ned Irish in 1946, was one of the founding members of the Basketball Association of America (BAA), which became the NBA after merging with the rival National Basketball League (NBL) in 1949. The Knicks were successful during their early years and were constant playoff contenders under the franchise's first head coach, Joe Lapchick. Beginning in 1950, the Knicks made three consecutive appearances in the NBA Finals, all of which were losing efforts. Lapchick resigned in 1956 and the team subsequently began to falter. It was not until the late 1960s when Red Holzman became the head coach that the Knicks began to regain their former dominance. Holzman successfully guided the Knicks to two NBA championships, in 1970 and 1973. The Knicks of the 1980s had mixed success that included six playoff appearances; however, they failed to participate in the NBA Finals. The playoff-level Knicks of the 1990s were led by future Hall of Fame center Patrick Ewing; this era was marked by passionate rivalries with the Chicago Bulls, Indiana Pacers, and Miami Heat. During this time, they were known for playing tough defense under head coaches Pat Riley and Jeff Van Gundy, making NBA Finals appearances in 1994 and 1999. However, they were unable to win an NBA championship during this era. Since 2000, the Knicks have struggled to regain their former successes, but won their first division title in 19 years in 2012–13, led by a core of forwards Carmelo Anthony and Amar'e Stoudemire. They were eventually eliminated in the Eastern Conference semifinals by the Indiana Pacers, and had failed to make the playoffs for eight years until 2020–21 when they were led by forward Julius Randle and sophomore RJ Barrett, who was selected third overall in the 2019 NBA draft.[10] In 1946, basketball, particularly college basketball, was a growing and increasingly profitable sport in New York City.[11] Hockey was another popular sport at the time and generated considerable profits; however, the arenas were not used often.[12] Max Kase, a New York sportswriter, became the sports editor at the Boston American in the 1930s, when he met Boston Garden owner Walter A. Brown.[13] Kase developed the idea of an organized professional league to showcase college players upon their graduation and felt it could become profitable if properly assembled.[13] Brown, intrigued by the opportunity to attain additional income when the hockey teams were not playing or on the road, contacted several arena owners.[13] On June 6, 1946, Kase and Brown and a group of seventeen others assembled at the Commodore Hotel in New York City, as the Basketball Association of America (BAA), where charter franchises were granted to major cities throughout the country.[14] Ned Irish, a college basketball promoter, retired sportswriter and then president of Madison Square Garden, was in attendance.[13][15] Kase originally planned to own and operate the New York franchise himself and approached Irish with a proposal to lease the Garden.[13] Irish explained that the rules of the Arena Managers Association of America stated that Madison Square Garden was required to own any professional teams that played in the arena.[13] On the day of the meeting, Kase made his proposal to the panel of owners; however, they were much more impressed by Irish and his vast resources; Kase relented and the franchise was awarded to Irish.[13] Irish wanted a distinct name for his franchise that was representative of the city of New York.[16] He called together members of his staff for a meeting to cast their votes in a hat. After tallying the votes, the franchise was named the Knickerbockers.[16] The \"Knickerbocker\" name comes from the pseudonym used by Washington Irving in his book A History of New York, a name that became applied to the descendants of the original Dutch settlers of what later became New York, and later, by extension, to New Yorkers in general.[4] In search of a head coach, Irish approached successful St. John's University coach Joe Lapchick in May 1946.[16] Lapchick readily accepted after Irish promised to make him the highest-paid coach in the league; however, he requested he remain at St. John's one more season in hopes of winning one last championship.[17] Irish obliged, hiring former Manhattan College coach Neil Cohalan as interim coach for the first year.[17] With no college draft in the league's initial year, there was no guarantee that the Knicks or the league itself would thrive.[18] Consequently, teams focused on signing college players from their respective cities as a way to promote the professional league.[17] The Knicks held their first training camp in the Catskill Mountains at the Nevele Country Club.[19] Twenty-five players were invited to attend the three-week session.[19] Players worked out twice a day and the chemistry between the New York natives was instant.[20] With a roster assembled, the Knicks faced the Toronto Huskies at Toronto's Maple Leaf Gardens on November 1, 1946, in what would be the franchise's first game—as well as the first in league history.[19] In a low-scoring affair presented in front of 7,090 spectators, the Knicks defeated the Huskies 68–66 with Leo Gottlieb leading the Knicks in scoring with 14 points.[21] With Madison Square Garden's crowded schedule, the Knicks were forced to play many of their home games at the 69th Regiment Armory during the team's early years.[15] The Knicks went on to finish their inaugural campaign with a 33–27 record and achieved a playoff berth under Cohalan despite a dismal shooting percentage of 28 percent.[18] The Knicks faced the Cleveland Rebels in the quarterfinals, winning the series 2–1.[22] However, the Knicks were swept by the Philadelphia Warriors in two games in the semifinals.[22] As promised, Lapchick took over in 1947, bringing with him his up-tempo coaching style, which emphasized fast ball movement.[23] Six new players were signed, including guard Carl Braun[22] and Japanese-American guard Wataru Misaka, the first non-Caucasian basketball player in the BAA.[24] Under Lapchick, the Knicks made nine straight playoff appearances beginning in 1947.[25] Braun, who averaged 14.3 points, emerged as the team's star and paired with Dick Holub and Bud Palmer to account for half of the team's offense.[22] Despite this, the Knicks struggled throughout the year, compiling a 26–22 record.[22] Their finish was good enough to place them second in the Eastern Division and secure a playoff match-up against the Baltimore Bullets where they lost the series two games to one.[22] In the 1948 NBA draft, the Knicks selected two future Hall of Fame players in center Dolph Schayes and Harry Gallatin.[26] The Knicks were leery of Schayes' talent, prompting the center to leave to play for the Syracuse Nationals of the struggling National Basketball League.[26] Despite losing Schayes, the team started the year well going 17–8 before they fell into a slump.[27] They ended the year with a seven-game win streak to finish with a 32–28 record and a third-straight playoff appearance.[27] The Knicks defeated the Bullets in a rematch of their previous encounter in 1947, winning the series 2–1.[27] The team however struggled against the Washington Capitols and lost the series 1–2.[27] Prior to the beginning of the 1949–50 season, the BAA merged with the National Basketball League to form the National Basketball Association which comprised 17 teams.[28][29] Despite division realignments, the Knicks remained in the Eastern Division.[25] The team continued its dominance under Lapchick, winning 40 games; however they lost the Eastern Division finals to the Syracuse Nationals.[25] The following season, the Knicks made history signing Sweetwater Clifton to a contract, thus becoming the first professional basketball team to sign an African American player.[25] During this same season, the Knicks finished with a 36–30 record. Though they placed third in their division, they secured a playoff spot and began the first of three consecutive trips to the NBA Finals.[25] In spite of their success, the Knicks could not overcome the Rochester Royals despite a valiant comeback after losing the first three games of the Finals.[25] The next two years, in 1952 and 1953, New York fell to the Minneapolis Lakers in the Finals.[25] It was during this early period, the Knicks developed their first standout players in Carl Braun who retired as the Knicks leading scorer with 10,449 points before later being surpassed by the likes of Patrick Ewing, Walt Frazier and Willis Reed.[25] Harry Gallatin and Dick McGuire were also well-known standouts on the team and were later enshrined in the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame.[25] Following these back-to-back losses, the Knicks made the playoffs in the subsequent two years with no success. Lapchick resigned as the team's head coach in January 1956 citing health-related issues.[30] Vince Boryla made his debut in February 1956 as the Knicks' new coach in a win over the St. Louis Hawks.[31] However, after two seasons of poor performances and no playoff appearances, Boryla tendered his resignation from the team in April 1958.[32] Looking to regain their former dominance, Andrew Levane was named the head coach and in his first year, the results were significantly better as the team finished with a 40–32 record, securing their playoff spot.[33] However, the Knicks could not manage to get past the Eastern Division semi-finals.[33] The Levane-led squad fared poorly to begin the 1959–60 season and under mounting pressure Levane resigned and was immediately replaced by Carl Braun, who became the team's first player-coach.[34] The team did not fare much better under Braun and the Knicks hired Eddie Donovan, who helped build up St. Bonaventure's basketball team, in 1961.[35] During Donovan's tenure, New York failed to achieve a playoff berth. As a testament to their struggles, on March 2, 1962, the Knicks faced the Philadelphia Warriors in Hershey, Pennsylvania, where they infamously allowed Wilt Chamberlain to score an NBA-record 100 points in a 169–147 Warriors victory.[25][33] In 1964, the franchise's fortunes began to take a steady turn. The Knicks drafted center Willis Reed, who made an immediate impact on the court and was named NBA Rookie of the Year for his efforts.[25] However, the leaders of the team still remained in flux. In an attempt to reorganize, the Knicks named former standout Harry Gallatin as head coach while reassigning Donovan to general manager position.[36] After a slow start in 1965, Dick McGuire, another former Knick, replaced his former teammate Gallatin midway through the season.[33] Though he failed to guide the Knicks to the playoffs in 1965, he managed to do so the following season, however, the Knicks lost in the Eastern Division semi-finals.[33] The Knicks started their 1967–68 season with a 124–122 win over the visiting Warriors. In that game, seven players on the Knicks' roster scored in double figures.[37] However, the Knicks lost their next six games, falling to a 1–6 record. They managed to stop their losing streak on November 1, 1967, when the Knicks won the road game against the Lakers, 129–113. During the game, Willis Reed scored a career-high 53 points on 21-of-29 shooting from the field.[38] On November 3, the Knicks defeated the Seattle SuperSonics 134–100 in Seattle. In that game, nine Knicks' player scored at least 10 points.[39] Head coach Dick McGuire was replaced midway through the 1967–68 season after the team began the season with a 15–22 record.[33] With the Knicks under .500, the team decided to hire coach Red Holzman, whose impact was immediate. Under his direction, the Knicks went 28–17 and finished with a 43–39 record thus salvaging a playoff berth, however, the Knicks were again vanquished in the Eastern Division semi-finals by the Philadelphia 76ers.[33] However their roster was slowly coming together piece by piece. Rookies Phil Jackson and Walt Frazier were named to the NBA All-Rookie Team while Dick Barnett and Willis Reed performed in the 1968 NBA All-Star Game.[25] The following season, the team acquired Dave DeBusschere from the Detroit Pistons, and the team went 54–28.[33][40] In the playoffs, New York made it past the first round of contention for the first time since 1953, sweeping the Baltimore Bullets in four games, before falling to the Boston Celtics in the Eastern Division finals.[41] In the 1969–70 season, the Knicks had a then-single-season NBA record 18 straight victories en route to a 60–22 record, which was the best regular season record in the franchise's history to that point.[42][43] After defeating the Bullets in the Eastern Division semifinals and the Milwaukee Bucks in the Eastern Division finals, the Knicks faced the Los Angeles Lakers in the NBA Finals.[42] With the series tied at 2–2, the Knicks would be tested in Game 5. Willis Reed tore a muscle in his right leg in the second quarter, and was lost for the rest of the game.[44] Despite his absence, New York went on to win the game, rallying from a 16-point deficit.[44] Without their injured captain the Knicks lost Game 6, setting up one of the most famous moments in NBA history.[44] Reed limped onto the court before the seventh game, determined to play through the pain of his injury.[44] He scored New York's first two baskets before going scoreless for the remainder of the contest.[44] Although he was not at full strength, Reed's heroics inspired the Knicks, and they won the game by a score of 113–99, allowing New York to capture the title that had eluded them for so long.[44] Reed, who had been named the All-Star MVP and the league's MVP that season, was named MVP of the Finals, becoming the first player to attain all three awards in a single season.[44] The Knicks' success continued for the next few years. After losing to the Bullets in the 1971 Eastern Conference finals, the team, aided by the acquisitions of Jerry Lucas and Earl \"The Pearl\" Monroe, returned to the Finals in 1972.[25] This time the Knicks fell to the Lakers in five games.[25] The next year, the results were reversed, as the Knicks defeated the Lakers in five games to win their second NBA title in four years.[45] The team had one more impressive season in 1973–74, as they reached the Eastern Conference finals, where they fell in five games to the Celtics.[46] It was after this season that Willis Reed announced his retirement, and the team's fortunes began to shift once more.[47] In the 1974–75 season, the Knicks posted a 40–42 record, their first losing record in eight seasons. The team still qualified for a playoff spot, however, but they lost to the Houston Rockets in the first round.[25] After two more seasons with losing records,[33] Holzman was replaced by Willis Reed, who signed a three-year contract.[48] In Reed's first year, New York finished the year with a 43–39 record and returned to the Eastern Conference semi-finals, where they were swept by the Philadelphia 76ers.[49] The next season, after the team began with a 6–8 record,[50] Holzman was rehired as the team's coach after Reed had angered Madison Square Garden president Sonny Werblin.[51][52] The team did not fare any better under Holzman's direction, finishing with a 31–51 record, their worst in thirteen years.[50] After improving to a 39–43 record in the 1979–80 season, the Knicks posted a 50–32 record in the 1980–81 season.[25] In the playoffs, the Chicago Bulls swept New York in two games.[25] Holzman retired the following season as one of the winningest coaches in NBA history. The team's record that year was a dismal 33–49.[25] However, Holzman's legacy would continue through the players he influenced. One of the Knicks' bench players and defensive specialists during the 1970s was Phil Jackson. Jackson went on to coach the Chicago Bulls and Los Angeles Lakers to 11 NBA championships, surpassing Red Auerbach for the most in NBA history. Jackson cited Holzman as a significant influence on his career in the NBA.[53] Hubie Brown replaced Holzman as head coach and in his first season, the team went 44–38 and made it to the second round of the playoffs, where they were swept by the eventual champion Philadelphia 76ers.[54] The next season, the team, aided by new acquisition Bernard King, improved to 47–35 and returned to the playoffs.[25] The team defeated the Detroit Pistons in the first round with an overtime win in the fifth and deciding game, before losing in the second round in seven games to the Celtics.[25] The team's struggles continued into the 1984–85 season, as they lost their last 12 games to finish with a 24–58 record.[25] The first of these losses occurred on March 23, 1985, where King injured his knee and spent the next 24 months in rehabilitation.[25] In the summer of 1985, the Knicks were entered into the first-ever NBA draft lottery.[55] The Knicks ended up winning the number one pick in that year's NBA draft. They used the pick to select star center Patrick Ewing of Georgetown University.[55] In Ewing's first season with the Knicks, he led all rookies in scoring (20 points per game) and rebounds (9 rebounds per game), and he won the NBA Rookie of the Year Award.[56] The team would not fare as well, though, as they struggled to a 23–59 record in his first season.[33] During Ewing's second season, the team started with a 4–12 record and head coach Hubie Brown was dismissed in favor of assistant Bob Hill.[57] Under Hill, the Knicks had brief successes but went on to lose seventeen of their twenty-one final games of the season to finish 20–46 under Hill and 24–58 on the season.[58][59] Hill was dismissed at season's end.[60] The team immediately turned around in the 1987–88 season with the hiring of Rick Pitino as head coach, who, only months prior to his hiring, led Providence College to the Final Four, turning around a program that had struggled prior to his arrival.[60] Combined with the selection of point guard Mark Jackson, who won the NBA Rookie of the Year Award and garnered MVP consideration, in the draft and with Ewing's consistently stellar play, the Knicks made the playoffs with a record of 38–44, where they were defeated by the Celtics in the first round.[61][62] The resurgence continued the following season as the team traded backup center Bill Cartwright to the Bulls for power forward Charles Oakley before the season started and then posted a 52–30 record, which was good enough for their first division title in 18 years and their fifth division title in franchise history.[63][64][65] In the playoffs, they defeated the 76ers in the first round before losing to the Chicago Bulls in the Eastern Conference semi-finals.[64] Prior to the start of the 1989–90 season, Pitino departed from New York to coach for the University of Kentucky leaving many stunned by his departure.[66] Assistant Stu Jackson was named as Pitino's replacement becoming the team's 14th head coach and the youngest head coach in the NBA, at the time, at the age of 32.[67] Under Jackson's direction, the Knicks went 45–37 and defeated the Celtics in the first round of the playoffs, winning the final three games after losing the first two. They went on to lose to the eventual NBA champion Detroit Pistons in the next round.[68] Jackson and the Knicks struggled to a 7–8 record to begin the 1990–91 season and Jackson was replaced by John MacLeod who led the Knicks to a 32–35 record, ending the season with a 39–43 record overall that was good enough to earn the team another playoff appearance. The Knicks were swept in the first round by the eventual NBA champion, Chicago Bulls.[69] After the conclusion of the season, MacLeod left the team to become the head coach at the University of Notre Dame. President David Checketts reached out to Pat Riley, who was working as a commentator for the National Broadcasting Company (NBC), to see if he was interested in returning to coaching. Riley accepted the Knicks proposition on May 31, 1991.[70] Riley, who coached the Lakers to four NBA titles during the 1980s, implemented a rough and physical style emphasizing defense.[70] Under Riley, the team, led by Ewing and guard John Starks, who scored 24 points per game and 13.9 points per game respectively, improved to a 51–31 record, tying them for first place in the Atlantic Division.[71][72] After defeating the Pistons in the first round of the playoffs, the team faced the Bulls, losing the series 4–3 in seven games.[72] The 1992–93 season proved to be even more successful, as the Knicks won the Atlantic Division with a 60–22 record. Before the season, the Knicks traded Mark Jackson to the Los Angeles Clippers for Charles Smith, Doc Rivers, and Bo Kimble while also acquiring Rolando Blackman from the Dallas Mavericks. After defeating the Indiana Pacers and Charlotte Hornets in the first two rounds of the playoffs, the Knicks made it to the Eastern Conference finals, where once again they met the Bulls. After taking a 2–0 series lead, the Knicks lost the next four games. After the Bulls' Michael Jordan made what would be his first retirement from basketball prior to the 1993–94 season, many saw this as an opportunity for the Knicks to finally make it to the NBA Finals. The team, who acquired Derek Harper in a midseason trade with the Dallas Mavericks, once again won the Atlantic Division with a 57–25 record. In the playoffs, the team played a then NBA-record 25 games (the Boston Celtics played 26 games in the 2008 playoffs); they started by defeating the New Jersey Nets in the first round before finally getting past the Bulls, defeating them in the second round in seven games. In the Eastern Conference Finals, they faced the Indiana Pacers, who at one point held a three games-to-two lead. They had this advantage thanks to the exploits of Reggie Miller, who scored 25 fourth-quarter points in Game 5 to lead the Pacers to victory. However, the Knicks won the next two games to reach their first NBA Finals since 1973. In the finals, the Knicks would play seven low-scoring, defensive games against the Houston Rockets. After splitting the first two games in Houston, the Knicks would win two out of three games at Madison Square Garden, which also hosted the New York Rangers first Stanley Cup celebration in 54 years following their win over the Vancouver Canucks in Game 7 of their finals during the series. (A Knicks win would have made the Garden the first building to host a Cup winner and an NBA champ in the same season.) In Game 6, however, a last-second attempt at a game-winning shot by Starks was tipped by Rockets center Hakeem Olajuwon, giving the Rockets an 86–84 victory and forcing a Game 7. The Knicks lost Game 7 90–84, credited in large part to Starks's dismal 2-for-18 shooting performance and Riley's stubborn refusal to bench Starks, despite having bench players who were renowned for their shooting prowess, such as Rolando Blackman and Hubert Davis available. The loss denied New York the distinction of having both NBA and NHL championships in the same year. Nevertheless, the Knicks had gotten some inspiration from Mark Messier and the Rangers during the finals. The next year, the Knicks were second place in the Atlantic Division with a 55–27 record. The team defeated the Cleveland Cavaliers before facing the Pacers again in the second round. The tone for the Knicks–Pacers series was set in Game 1, as Miller once again became a clutch nuisance to the Knicks by scoring eight points in the final 8 seconds of the game to give the Pacers a 107–105 victory. The series went to a Game 7, and when Patrick Ewing's last-second finger roll attempt to tie the game missed, the Pacers clinched the 97–95 win. Riley resigned the next day,[73] and the Knicks hired Don Nelson as their new head coach. While Nelson had been a successful coach before joining the Knicks, his offensive-oriented Nellie Ball philosophy failed to mesh with the team, and during the 1995–96 season, Nelson was fired after 59 games, and, instead of going after another well-known coach, the Knicks hired longtime assistant Jeff Van Gundy, who had no prior experience as a head coach. Van Gundy, who restored the team's defense-first style of his mentor Pat Riley, went 13–10 the rest of the way. The Knicks ended up with a 47–35 record that year, and swept the Cavaliers in the first round of the playoffs before losing to the eventual champion Bulls (who had an NBA record 72 wins in the regular season) in five games. In the 1996–97 season, the Knicks, with the additions of such players as Larry Johnson and Allan Houston, registered a 57–25 record. In the playoffs, the Knicks swept the Charlotte Hornets in the first round before facing the Miami Heat (coached by Riley) in the second round. The Knicks took a 3–1 lead in the series before a brawl near the end of Game 5 resulted in suspensions of key players. Many of the suspended Knicks players, Ewing in particular, were disciplined not for participating in the altercation itself, but for violating an NBA rule stipulating that a benched player may not leave the bench during a fight (the rule was subsequently amended, making it illegal to leave the \"bench area\"). With Ewing and Houston suspended for Game 6, Johnson and Starks suspended for Game 7, and Charlie Ward suspended for both, the Knicks lost the series. The 1997–98 season was marred by a wrist injury to Ewing on December 22, which forced him to miss the rest of the season and much of the playoffs. The team, which had a 43–39 record that season, still managed to defeat the Heat in the first round (a series, which saw another violent bench-clearing brawl at the end of Game 4, this time between Johnson and former Hornets teammate Alonzo Mourning) of the playoffs before having another meeting with the Pacers in the second round. Ewing returned in time for game two of the series. This time, the Pacers easily won the series in five games, as Reggie Miller once again broke the hearts of Knicks fans by hitting a tying three-pointer with 5.1 seconds remaining in Game 4, en route to a Pacers overtime victory. For the fourth straight year, the Knicks were eliminated in the second round of the playoffs. Prior to the lockout-shortened 1998–99 season, the Knicks traded Charles Oakley to the Toronto Raptors for Marcus Camby while also trading John Starks in a package to the Golden State Warriors for 1994's 1st team all-league shooting guard Latrell Sprewell (whose contract was voided by the Warriors after choking Warriors' head coach P. J. Carlesimo during the previous season). After barely getting into the playoffs with a 27–23 record, the Knicks started a Cinderella run. It started with the Knicks eliminating the #1 seeded Heat in the first round after Allan Houston bounced in a running one-hander off the front of the rim, high off the backboard, and in with 0.8 seconds left in the deciding 5th game. This remarkable upset marked only the second time in NBA history that an 8-seed had defeated the 1-seed in the NBA playoffs, and also the first time it happened in the Eastern Conference. After defeating the Atlanta Hawks in the second round four games to none, they faced the Pacers yet again in the Eastern Conference Finals. Despite losing Ewing to injury for the rest of the playoffs prior to Game 3, the Knicks won the series (aided in part to a four-point play by Larry Johnson in the final seconds of Game 3) to become the first eighth-seeded playoff team to make it to the NBA Finals. However, in the Finals, the San Antonio Spurs, with superstars David Robinson and Tim Duncan, proved too much for the injury-laden Knicks, who lost in five games. The remarkable fifth game of this Finals is remembered for its 2nd half scoring duel between the Spurs' Tim Duncan and the Knicks' Latrell Sprewell, and was decided by a long jumper by Avery Johnson with 47 seconds left to clinch the title for the Spurs. The 1999–2000 season, would prove to be the last one in New York for Ewing, as the Knicks, who had a 50–32 record that season swept the Toronto Raptors a team led by Vince Carter, Antonio Davis and a young Tracy McGrady in three games in the first round, defeated the Miami Heat in another dramatic seven-game series in which Ewing's dunk with over a minute remaining in game 7, provided the winning margin in a 1-point road victory. They would, however, lose in the Eastern Conference Finals to the Reggie Miller-led Indiana Pacers in six games. After the season, Ewing was traded[74] on September 20, 2000, to the Seattle SuperSonics, and the Ewing era, which produced many successful playoff appearances but no NBA championship titles, came to an end.[75] Despite the loss of Ewing, the Knicks remained successful in the regular season, as they posted a 48–34 record under the direction of Houston and Sprewell.[76] In the first round of playoff contention, however, New York fell to the Toronto Raptors in five games, failing to get past the first round of the playoffs for the first time in a decade.[77] After a poor start to the season, the Knicks managed to get above .500 with a 10–9 record.[78] In spite of their recent success, Van Gundy unexpectedly resigned[79] as head coach on December 8, 2001, explaining he had \"lost focus\" and would no longer be able to properly coach the team.[80] The team, which named longtime assistant Don Chaney as their new head coach, ended the season with a 30–52 record, and for the first time since the 1986–87 season they did not qualify for the playoffs.[33][78] In October 2002, the team elected to extend Chaney's contract for another year.[81] Rather than rebuilding, the Knicks opted to add veterans to the roster including Antonio McDyess who had been dealing with knee problems in the preceding years.[82][83] Furthermore, the Knicks were criticized by many analysts as multiple players on the roster were overpaid in light of their poor performances, causing salary cap problems that would persist until Donnie Walsh took over as team president.[82][84] McDyess injured his knee during the team's third preseason game and was subjected to further operations in April 2003 after a CT scan revealed the injured knee necessitated he undergo bone-graft surgery.[83] The Knicks managed only seven wins in their first twenty games, setting the tone for the rest of the season, which they completed with a 37–45 record; it was their second consecutive season without a playoff appearance.[85] After a 10–18 start to the 2003–04 season, the Knicks underwent a massive overhaul. Isiah Thomas was named the Knicks' president on December 22, 2003, upon the firing of Scott Layden.[86] Thomas continued to restructure the team, firing Chaney after an unproductive tenure and hiring Hall of Famer Lenny Wilkens to coach the team.[87] Additionally, Thomas orchestrated multiple trades, including one that brought point guard Stephon Marbury to the team.[88] The team qualified for the playoffs that year with a 39–43 record, but were swept by the New Jersey Nets in the first round.[89] The series included a highly publicized spat between the Knicks' Tim Thomas and Nets' Kenyon Martin, in which Thomas all but challenged Martin to a fight and called him \"Fugazy\".[90] The following season, the Knicks struggled to a 17–22 record before Wilkens resigned as head coach.[91] Herb Williams, who had previously coached the team in a game against the Orlando Magic prior to the team hiring Wilkens, took over as interim head coach for the remainder of the season and did not fare much better as the Knicks ended their season with a 33–49 record and out of playoff contention.[89][91][92] Hoping to find a leader that could put the team back on track, New York hired Larry Brown to coach the team.[93] Brown, who idolized the team during his childhood, was well regarded for his coaching abilities and his arrival brought a sense of hope to the franchise.[93] Hoping to find the next Patrick Ewing, the Knicks drafted center Channing Frye and signed centers Jerome James and Eddy Curry, the former prior to the season and the latter during the season.[94] Curry, who reportedly had a worrying heart condition, refused to take a controversial DNA test, and fell out of favor with John Paxson, Chicago's general manager.[95] The Bulls signed-and-traded him to the Knicks along with Antonio Davis for Tim Thomas, Michael Sweetney, the Knicks' 2006 first-round pick, and the right to swap first-round picks with the Knicks in 2007, as well as 2007 and 2009 second-round picks.[95] Isiah Thomas did not lottery-protect the picks, and the Knicks forfeited the second pick in the 2006 draft, and the ninth in the 2007 draft. With a bloated payroll, the Knicks stumbled to the second worst record in the NBA that season, at 23–59.[96][97] The season concluded with the firing and $18.5 million buy-out of head coach Larry Brown after one season.[96][98] With the departure of Brown, team president Isiah Thomas took over the head coaching responsibilities.[96] Thomas continued his practice of signing players to high-priced contracts while the franchise struggled to capitalize on their talent on the court. As a testament to their struggles, on December 16, 2006, the Knicks and the Denver Nuggets broke into a brawl during their game in Madison Square Garden. With multiple players still serving a suspension as a result of the brawl, on December 20, 2006, David Lee created one of the most memorable plays in recent Knicks history, and served as a bright spot as the team's struggles persisted, during a game against the Charlotte Bobcats. With a tie game and 0.1 seconds left on the game clock in double overtime, Jamal Crawford inbounded from the sideline, near half-court. The ball sailed towards the basket, and with that 0.1 seconds still remaining on the game clock, Lee tipped the ball off of the backboard and into the hoop.[99] Because of the Trent Tucker Rule, a player is allowed solely to tip the ball to score when the ball is put back into play with three-tenths of a second or less remaining. Because of this rule, the rarity of Lee's play increases. The Knicks won, 111–109 in double overtime.[99] The Knicks improved by ten games in the 2006–2007 campaign in spite of injuries that ravaged the team at the end of the year; they ended with a 33–49 record, avoiding a 50-loss season by defeating the Charlotte Bobcats 94–93 on the last day of the season. During the 2007 off-season, the organization became embroiled in further controversy away from the basketball court. Anucha Browne Sanders, a former Knicks executive, had filed a sexual harassment lawsuit against Isiah Thomas and Madison Square Garden.[100] Faced with a trial, the jury returned a verdict finding Thomas and Madison Square Garden liable for sexual harassment.[101] The jury also levied $11.6 million in punitive damages against Madison Square Garden, though this was later reduced to $11.5 million in a settlement between both parties.[101] The ordeal proved embarrassing for the franchise, revealing sordid details about Knicks management and the environment at Madison Square Garden.[101] The Knicks struggled as they opened their 2007 campaign with a 2–9 record leaving many Knicks fans, frustrated with the franchise's lack of progress under Thomas, called for the coach's firing—the chant \"Fire Isiah\" became a common occurrence during the Knicks' home games.[102][103] On November 29, 2007, the Knicks were handed one of their worst defeats in their history by the Boston Celtics, with a final score of 104–59.[104] This matched their third-largest margin of defeat.[104] New York went on to post an eighth consecutive losing season and tied the franchise mark for their worst record ever, at 23–59.[33] MSG chairman James Dolan hired former Indiana Pacers President Donnie Walsh on April 2, 2008, to take over Isiah Thomas's role as team president.[105] At the introductory press conference, Walsh, while not proclaiming to be a savior, did set goals, which included getting the team under the salary cap and bringing back a competitive environment.[106] Upon the conclusion of the 2007–2008 regular season, Walsh fired Thomas, and on May 13, 2008, officially named former Phoenix Suns head coach Mike D'Antoni as head coach.[107][108] D'Antoni signed a four-year, $24 million deal to coach the team.[108] The Knicks, holding the sixth pick in the 2008 NBA draft, selected Danilo Gallinari on May 20, 2008.[109] On November 21, 2008, the Knicks dealt one of their top scorers, Jamal Crawford, to the Golden State Warriors for Al Harrington.[110] Hours later, New York traded Zach Randolph, along with Mardy Collins, to the Los Angeles Clippers for Cuttino Mobley and Tim Thomas, with the intention of freeing cap space for the 2010 off-season, when top-flight players such as LeBron James, Dwyane Wade, Chris Bosh, and Amar'e Stoudemire would be available.[110] In February 2009, the Knicks traded Tim Thomas, Jerome James, and Anthony Roberson to the Chicago Bulls for Larry Hughes, in addition to sending Malik Rose to the Oklahoma City Thunder for Chris Wilcox.[111][112] Additionally, the long-standing controversy with Stephon Marbury ended when the two sides agreed to a buy-out of Marbury's contract, which allowed him to sign with the Celtics when he cleared waivers on February 27, 2009.[113] In spite of a volatile roster, the Knicks improved by nine wins from the previous season in D'Antoni's first season, to finish 32–50, coinciding with the emergence of forward-center David Lee, who led the league with 65 double-doubles, and the continued development of guard Nate Robinson and swingman Wilson Chandler.[114][115][116][117] In the 2009 NBA draft, the Knicks selected forward Jordan Hill eighth after targets such as Stephen Curry, Jonny Flynn, and Ricky Rubio were off the board. Guard Toney Douglas was then selected with a 29th overall pick, which was acquired from the Los Angeles Lakers.[118] Shortly afterwards, New York executed a trade with the Memphis Grizzlies in which the Knicks acquired Darko Miličić in exchange for Quentin Richardson.[118] The Knicks got off to their worst 10-game start in franchise history, producing nine losses, with just one win.[119] The Knicks responded by winning nine games and losing six in December.[120] On January 24, 2010, the Knicks suffered their worst home loss in Madison Square Garden history against the Dallas Mavericks in front of a sellout crowd. The 50-point loss was also the second-worst in Knicks franchise history.[121] On February 17, the Knicks shook up the roster, trading Miličić to the Minnesota Timberwolves for Brian Cardinal and cash considerations.[122] A day later, the Knicks and Celtics swapped guard Nate Robinson for shooting guard Eddie House. The deal also included forward Marcus Landry going to the Celtics and the Knicks acquiring bench players J. R. Giddens and Bill Walker.[123] The Knicks also acquired All-Star forward Tracy McGrady from the Houston Rockets and point guard Sergio Rodríguez from the Sacramento Kings in a three-way trade. The deal sent Knicks shooting guard Larry Hughes to Sacramento and forward Jordan Hill and power forward Jared Jeffries to Houston. The trades, orchestrated to give the Knicks more cap space for the summer of 2010, netted the Knicks $30 million of cap space.[124] About three weeks after these team-changing trades, the Knicks played the Dallas Mavericks at American Airlines Center and blew them out by a score of 128–94 for their largest win of the season.[120][125] However, the Knicks were eliminated from playoff contention in late March 2010 and completed their season with a 29–53 record, a regression from their first season under D'Antoni.[120][126] The Knicks and former Phoenix Suns forward-center Amar'e Stoudemire came to an agreement on July 5, 2010.[127] The sign and trade deal was made official on July 8 as Stoudemire agreed to an approximately $100 million contract over the span of five years.[127] Team president Donnie Walsh stated the signing of Stoudemire as a turning point for the future of a Knicks team that had struggled in recent years.[128] The Knicks continued to redesign their roster, trading David Lee to the Golden State Warriors for Anthony Randolph, Kelenna Azubuike and Ronny Turiaf.[129] The Knicks also struck deals with former Bobcats point guard Raymond Felton and Russian center Timofey Mozgov.[129] The Knicks regained their title as the most valuable franchise in the NBA following these acquisitions, though this was mainly due to the arrival of Stoudemire, whose star power allowed the team to resurge; the Knicks sold out their full-season ticket inventory for the first time since 2002.[130] D'Antoni along with Stoudemire and the core of young players, including Felton, Danilo Gallinari, Mozgov, Wilson Chandler and rookie Landry Fields, piloted the Knicks to a 28–26 record prior to the All-Star break, marking the first time the team had been above the .500 mark at that point of the season since 2000.[131] In spite of the team's mounting success,[132] New York made a push to acquire Denver Nuggets forward Carmelo Anthony. After months of speculation, on February 22, 2011, Anthony was traded to New York, with teammates Chauncey Billups, Shelden Williams, Anthony Carter, and former Knicks player Renaldo Balkman. Denver acquired Felton, Danilo Gallinari, Wilson Chandler, Mozgov, Kosta Koufos, a 2014 first-round draft pick, the Warriors' second-round draft picks for 2013 and 2014 and $3 million in cash. In addition, the Knicks sent Anthony Randolph and Eddy Curry to the Minnesota Timberwolves and in return the Timberwolves' Corey Brewer was sent to the Knicks.[133][134] The Knicks clinched their first playoff berth since the 2004 NBA playoffs in a rout of the Cleveland Cavaliers on April 3, 2011.[135] Carmelo Anthony ensured the franchise's first winning season since 2001 on April 10, 2011, against the Indiana Pacers, as Anthony scored the game-winning basket for the Knicks and subsequently blocked Danny Granger's shot in the final seconds of the game.[136] The Knicks were ultimately eliminated from contention in the first round on April 24, 2011, by the Boston Celtics, losing the series 0–4.[137] In spite of Donnie Walsh's successful efforts to help rebuild the franchise, he decided not to return as the team's president, electing to step down at the end of June 2011, citing the uncertainty surrounding his ability to continue to manage the daily operations of the team.[138] Glen Grunwald was elected as interim president and general manager.[138] Following the conclusion of the 2011 NBA lockout, the Knicks engaged in a sign-and-trade deal with the Mavericks for center Tyson Chandler on December 10, 2011, with Chandler signing a four-year contract worth approximately $58 million.[139] In return, the Knicks sent Andy Rautins to the Mavericks, generating a trade exception for Dallas. Ronny Turiaf and $3 million in cash considerations were sent to the Wizards to complete the three-way trade. The Knicks also obtained the draft rights to Ahmad Nivins and Georgios Printezis from Dallas. In order to fit Chandler under the salary cap, Chauncey Billups was earlier waived under the amnesty clause of the new collective bargaining agreement.[139] To replace Billups at point guard, the Knicks signed Mike Bibby to a one-year, veteran minimum contract.[140] The Knicks also signed veteran point guard Baron Davis on December 19 to a one-year contract. At the time, Davis had suffered a herniated disk and was not expected to compete for about 6–8 weeks, leaving Toney Douglas as the team's starting point guard.[141] The Knicks struggled early in the season because Douglas and Bibby struggled to facilitate the offense and subsequently, it became stagnated.[142] Subsequently, rookie Iman Shumpert was thrust into the role as the starting point guard after Douglas was relegated to the bench due to his struggles.[143] In addition, head coach D'Antoni also decided to use Carmelo Anthony as a point forward to help generate a more up-tempo offense; however, there were concerns Anthony was holding the ball for too long, thus contributing to the stagnation of the Knicks' offense.[144][145] With the Knicks struggling to an 8–15 record, D'Antoni inserted third-string point guard Jeremy Lin into the rotation against the New Jersey Nets on February 4, 2012.[144] Lin, who had been claimed off waivers on December 27 following an injury to Iman Shumpert, scored 25 points and had seven assists en route to a Knicks win.[144][146] Lin was praised for his ability to facilitate the offense, something the Knicks had struggled to do for the first 23 games of the season.[144] Lin, exceeding expectations, was named the starter for the Knicks following a game against the Utah Jazz.[147] Lin guided the Knicks to a seven-game winning streak, despite being without Anthony and Amar'e Stoudemire for five games due to a groin injury and a death in the family respectively, that brought the team back to a .500 winning percentage.[148][149][150] The surge of positive play by the Knicks accompanied by the performance of Lin caused extensive national and worldwide media coverage that was referred to as \"Linsanity\".[151] To bolster their depth and perimeter shooting percentage, the Knicks signed J. R. Smith on February 18, 2012.[152] The team struggled to congeal when Anthony returned from injury and went on to lose seven of eight games before head coach Mike D'Antoni resigned on March 14, 2012. Assistant Mike Woodson was named the interim head coach.[153] Under Woodson, the Knicks finished 18–6 during the regular season and clinched a playoff spot for the second straight year this time as the seventh seed, making it the first time they have clinched consecutive playoff berths since making 13 straight playoff appearances from 1988 to 2001.[33][154] Not only did they also clinch consecutive winning seasons for the first time in a decade, but their 36–30 record was the highest winning percentage for the team since the 2000–01 season.[33] The Knicks faced the Miami Heat in the first round of the playoffs and lost the first three games, breaking the NBA record for longest playoff losing streak at 13 games.[155] The team's struggles were partially attributed to injuries as Jeremy Lin, Baron Davis and Iman Shumpert were all sidelined by knee ailments.[156] The Knicks proceeded to win a close Game 4, which snapped their streak and ensured that they would not be swept out of the first round; however, they failed to keep up with the Heat's up-tempo offense in Game 5 and lost the series 4–1.[156] Despite the team's disappointing postseason exit, the Knicks removed Woodson's interim status and he was officially named the full-time head coach on May 25, 2012.[157] The Knicks began their off-season by selecting Greek forward Kostas Papanikolaou in the 2012 NBA draft. One week later, the team came to terms with veteran point guard Jason Kidd, who was originally supposed to serve as a backup to Lin. The Knicks also re-acquired Marcus Camby from the Houston Rockets in a sign and trade sending Houston Josh Harrellson, Jerome Jordan, Toney Douglas and 2014 and 2015 two second-round picks and completed a sign-and-trade with the Portland Trail Blazers that brought back Raymond Felton and Kurt Thomas in exchange for Jared Jeffries, Dan Gadzuric, and the draft rights to Papanikolaou and Greek forward Georgios Printezis, whose draft rights had been acquired by the Knicks in December 2011. The Knicks also re-signed free agents J. R. Smith and Steve Novak and added more players to the roster, such as James White, Chris Copeland, and Argentinian point guard Pablo Prigioni. However the Knicks lost restricted free agents shooting guard, Landry Fields to the Toronto Raptors and point guard, Jeremy Lin to the Houston Rockets, who were both key players during the 2011–12 season. The Knicks decided not to match those teams' offers. Despite these losses, the Knicks continued to add players to the roster, signing former Chicago Bulls guard Ronnie Brewer on July 25, 2012, and signing Chris Smith, the younger brother of J. R. Smith, on August 1, 2012.[158][159][160] It was also announced that Rasheed Wallace would come out of retirement to play for the Knicks on October 2, 2012. Despite playing without an injured Iman Shumpert and Amar'e Stoudemire, the Knicks compiled an 18–5 record to start the season, their best start since 1993. In their first four games, they scored at least 100 points and won by double digits in all of those games. The streak ended after a 10-point loss to Memphis Grizzlies. The following Sunday, in a game against the Indiana Pacers, the Knicks at home went on to win 88–76, assuring them a 7–1 record. After two tough losses to the Dallas Mavericks and Houston Rockets, the Knicks returned home in a game against the Detroit Pistons on November 25, with a 121–100 blowout win, making them one of only three teams undefeated at home along with the Miami Heat and Utah Jazz. The Knicks finished November with an 11–4 record, their best month record since going 11–6 in March 2000.[161] By the All-Star break in mid-February 2013, the Knicks compiled a 32–18 record, good for second in the Eastern Conference. On February 21, on the trade deadline, the team traded Ronnie Brewer for a 2014 second-round draft pick. The Knicks then signed veteran power forward Kenyon Martin to a 10-day contract. In late March, the Knicks went on to compile a four-game losing streak, tying their worst skid of the season. They would go on and face the Jazz on the road, eventually winning the game and starting what would turn out to be a 13-game winning streak, including wins against the Miami Heat and the Oklahoma City Thunder. This was the third-longest winning streak in franchise history. On April 9, the Knicks beat the Washington Wizards to secure the Atlantic Division title for the first time since the 1993–94 NBA season. The Knicks' 13-game winning streak came to an end on April 11 as they lost to the Chicago Bulls. Despite that, they set the NBA single-season record for three-pointers. On May 3, the Knicks defeated the Boston Celtics in the first round of the NBA playoffs, 4–2, their first playoff victory since 2000. On May 18, the Knicks were eliminated in the second round of the playoffs, losing the series to the Indiana Pacers 4–2. Point guard Jason Kidd retired following the end of the season—he was named head coach of the Brooklyn Nets a few days later. In the 2013 NBA draft, the Knicks selected Tim Hardaway Jr. as the 24th pick in the first round. During the 2013 off-season, The Knicks claimed Los Angeles Lakers F Metta World Peace off of waivers. They re-signed J. R. Smith to a 3-year, $18 million deal and traded Quentin Richardson, Steve Novak, Marcus Camby, and three draft picks to acquire Andrea Bargnani from the Toronto Raptors. The Knicks also saw changes to business operations in late 2013, replacing general manager Glen Grunwald with former MSG president Steve Mills.[162] The Knicks also purchased an NBA D-League team located White Plains, which began operations at the start of the 2014–15 NBDL season.[163] The Knicks then appointed former coach Phil Jackson as president of basketball operations, with Mills remaining as general manager, with the duo working directly under MSG chairman James Dolan.[164] Following the 2013–14 season, coach Mike Woodson and his entire staff were fired,[165] and was replaced by Derek Fisher. Fisher played under Jackson with the Los Angeles Lakers, winning five NBA championships with the franchise.[166] The Knicks finished the season with a disappointing 37–45 record and finished ninth in the Eastern Conference, but was the season Carmelo Anthony established his career high, the Knicks' franchise record, and the Madison Square Garden record for single-game scoring. Anthony recorded 62 points and 13 rebounds in a victory against the Charlotte Bobcats.[167] Forbes magazine released its franchise value rankings for NBA teams, and listed the Knicks as the world's most valuable basketball organization at $1.4 billion in 2014, edging out the Los Angeles Lakers by $50 million. The Knicks were valued at 40% more than the third-place Chicago Bulls valuation of $1 billion, and were valued nearly twice as highly as their crosstown rivals, the Brooklyn Nets, who came in at $780 million.[168] In the off-season, the Knicks traded controversial guard Raymond Felton, along with former NBA defensive player of the year, Tyson Chandler, to the Dallas Mavericks. In return, the Knicks received Shane Larkin, José Calderón, Samuel Dalembert, and Wayne Ellington along with two picks for the 2014 NBA draft. The trade was the first one that Jackson ever executed as a front office executive. On June 26, as part of the draft, the Knicks selected Cleanthony Early as the 34th overall pick, and Thanasis Antetokounmpo as the 51st overall pick, using the draft picks received in the trade from the Mavericks. The Knicks also acquired Louis Labeyrie, an additional second-round draft pick, in a trade with the Indiana Pacers for cash considerations. The Knicks would then go onto set a franchise record with its 13th consecutive loss, losing 101–91 to the Washington Wizards, giving New York its longest losing streak in the franchise's 69-season history.[169] This record was extended to 16th consecutive losses, after the NBA Global Games loss against the Milwaukee Bucks in London. The Knicks would finish the 2014–15 season with a win–loss record of 17–65, the worst record in franchise history, and allowed them to gain the 4th overall selection in the upcoming draft. The Knicks also bought out Amar'e Stoudemire's $100 million contract a season early. On June 24, 2015, the Knicks selected Kristaps Porziņģis with the fourth overall pick in the draft, and traded Tim Hardaway Jr. to the Atlanta Hawks in exchange for Jerian Grant, the 19th overall pick. Midway through another losing season, Fisher was relieved of his coaching duties, with Kurt Rambis being named as interim head coach as the Knicks finished the season with a record of 32–50.[170] Jeff Hornacek was then hired as their next head coach, which also oversaw Jackson's most notable acts as an executive. On June 22, former NBA MVP Derrick Rose was traded, along with Justin Holiday and a second-round pick from Chicago, to New York in exchange for Robin Lopez, José Calderón and Grant. The Knicks also signed Joakim Noah, Brandon Jennings, and Courtney Lee to contracts worth a combined $127 million, and regressed the following season, causing the franchise to part ways with Jackson after three years as the Knicks' president of basketball operations.[171] Under Jackson's presidency, the Knicks had gone 80–166, suffered three consecutive losing seasons, and missed three consecutive playoffs.[172] In his last act prior to leaving the Knicks, Jackson selected Frank Ntilikina with the eighth overall pick, Damyean Dotson with the 44th overall pick, and Ognjen Jaramaz with the 58th overall pick in the 2017 NBA draft. Following Jackson's departure, the Knicks appointed Scott Perry as general manager and named Steve Mills president of basketball operations.[173] The Knicks also saw Carmelo Anthony demanding a trade from the team, which posed difficulty for both player and franchise due to a no-trade clause inserted in Anthony's contract given by Jackson in 2013. Originally, the only teams for which he would waive his no-trade clause were for the Cleveland Cavaliers and the Houston Rockets, with the former eventually removed from trade discussions due to internal conflicts. Anthony intended to join the Rockets, with a three-way trade with the Portland Trail Blazers set up involving Ryan Anderson. Anderson's three-year, $60 million contract was not feasibly able to be absorbed by either franchise, however, causing Perry to cease talks with the Rockets, before agreeing to a deal with the Oklahoma City Thunder, after Anthony agreed to expand his no-trade clause to include the Thunder.[174][175] The Knicks received Enes Kanter, Doug McDermott and a 2018 second-round pick in exchange for Anthony on September 25, 2017,[176] while also positioning Kristaps Porziņģis as the new centerpiece of the franchise.[177] The Knicks also re-signed Tim Hardaway Jr. to a four-year, $71 million contract, while also agreeing to a one-year, minimum contract with Michael Beasley. The franchise also traded for former lottery pick Emmanuel Mudiay from the Denver Nuggets at the trade deadline, who was a point guard the Knicks were rumored to have targeted prior to selecting Porziņģis in 2015.[178] The trade also included the Dallas Mavericks, with Dallas acquiring McDermott from the Knicks, and the Nuggets obtaining Devin Harris from Dallas.[179] However, the season again ended poorly, with 29–53 record to leave the Knicks as the 11th seed in the Eastern Conference. This caused the Knicks to part ways with head coach Jeff Hornacek.[180] Hornacek's two full seasons retained criticism for the team's continued struggle on defense, as well as the inability to implement an efficient, modern offense.[181] He was replaced with former Memphis Grizzlies head coach David Fizdale.[182] Fizdale signed a four-year deal, and was tasked to deliver on player development and improving the team's basketball philosophy.[183] On May 15, 2018, the Knicks were awarded the ninth overall pick in the 2018 NBA draft, and selected Kevin Knox II from the Kentucky.[184] The team also acquired Mitchell Robinson with the 36th overall pick, and signed former lottery pick Mario Hezonja. They further invested in untapped potential by signing another former lottery pick, with Noah Vonleh agreeing to a one-year deal.[185] However, following a dismal start to the season, and after a meeting with Porziņģis gave team officials the impression that he wanted to be traded,[186] Porziņģis was traded on January 30, 2019, alongside Trey Burke, Courtney Lee and Tim Hardaway Jr., to the Dallas Mavericks in exchange for DeAndre Jordan, Wesley Matthews, Dennis Smith Jr., an unprotected 2021 first-round draft pick, and an additional top-ten protected 2023 first-round draft pick.[187] The Knicks finished the 2018–19 season with a league worst 17–65 regular season record, but the season was notable for the emergence of undrafted rookie Allonzo Trier,[188] as well as for the progression of Dotson and Robinson.[189][190] The Knicks won the third overall pick in the 2019 NBA draft, and selected RJ Barrett from Duke. The team also traded for forward Iggy Brazdeikis, who was drafted in the second round from Michigan. In preparation for the 2019–20 season, and as a result of having a record $74 million in cap space following the Porziņģis trade,[191] the team divided it among five new signings. The Knicks agreed terms with veteran role players Wayne Ellington and Taj Gibson, with forward Bobby Portis also signing. The team then signed former lottery picks Elfrid Payton and Julius Randle. On February 4, 2020, the Knicks fired Steve Mills after seven seasons as president with Scott Perry taking over on an interim basis.[192] On March 2, 2020, Leon Rose was named president of the team.[193] On July 30, the Knicks announced that they hired Tom Thibodeau as their head coach.[194] Julius Randle had a breakout season and, on February 23, 2021, Randle was named as a reserve for the 2021 NBA All-Star Game.[195] On May 3, with a 118–104 win over the Memphis Grizzlies, the Knicks clinched their first winning season since the 2012–13 season.[196] On May 12, the Knicks clinched their first playoff appearance since 2013, ending their eight-year playoff drought.[197] At the end of the regular season, Randle was named NBA Most Improved Player,[198] while Thibodeau was named the NBA Coach of the Year, becoming the first Knicks head coach since Pat Riley in 1992–93 to receive the award.[199] The Knicks faced the Atlanta Hawks in the first round of the 2021 NBA playoffs as the fourth seed,[200] losing in five games.[201] Fan attendance in home games during the 2020–21 season was prohibited until February 23, 2021, per an executive order from Governor of New York Andrew Cuomo.[202] The Knicks reopened Madison Square Garden to spectators on February 23.[203] In the 2021 off-season, the Knicks retained much of their old talent, while bringing in former all-star guard Kemba Walker and forward Evan Fournier.[204] Additionally, after Randle's breakthrough season, the Knicks extended his contract for four years in August 2021.[205] On January 13, 2022, the Knicks traded former eighth overall pick of the 2018 NBA draft, Kevin Knox II and a protected future first round pick in exchange for former 10th overall pick of the 2019 NBA draft, Cam Reddish, Solomon Hill and a 2025 second-round draft pick and cash considerations.[206] During the 2021–22 season, the Knicks struggled regressed finishing 11th in the Eastern Conference with a 37–45 record.[207] Randle took a step back having a down season across the boards and his shooting percentages took a hit that resulted in fans booing Randle and increased trade rumours, and the lack of leadership of Randle was questioned, along with attitude and desire to be a Knick.[207] Head coach Thibodeau was questioned if he was the right coach for the Knicks heading onwards.[208] The signings of guard Kemba Walker and forward Evan Fournier were considered extreme failures that set the Knicks back as well.[209] The third overall pick of the 2019 NBA draft, RJ Barrett in his third season averaged 20.0 points, 5.8 rebounds and 3.0 assists.[210] The 2022 off-season brought a lot of change to the Knicks' roster. During the 2022 NBA draft, the Knicks traded Alec Burks, Nerlens Noel and Kemba Walker to the Detroit Pistons to clear cap space for the free agency period, as well as trading their 11th overall pick for protected future first round picks.[211] On June 12, 2022, the Knicks signed point guard Jalen Brunson to a four-year contract, with hopes he could bring some much-needed stability to the position.[212] The Knicks completed the 2022–23 season with a 47–35 record, finishing in fifth place in the Eastern Conference. Randle represented the Knicks in the 2023 NBA All-Star Game. In the first round of the 2023 playoffs, the Knicks defeated the Cleveland Cavaliers in five games, their first playoff series win since 2013. They were then defeated 4–2 by the Miami Heat in the second round.[213] In 2024, the Knicks saw Brunson and Randle represent them at the NBA All-Star Game. The team finished with 50 wins and secured the second seed, with a first round matchup against the Philadelphia 76ers. The Knicks defeated the 76ers in six games, before falling short in seven games against the Indiana Pacers. List of the last five seasons completed by the Knicks. For the full season-by-season history, see List of New York Knicks seasons. Note: GP = Games played, W = Wins, L = Losses, W–L% = Winning percentage The first logo of the New York Knicks is of a character named \"Father Knickerbocker\" dribbling a basketball, in the iconic blue and orange colors. It was designed by New York World-Telegram cartoonist Willard Mullin.[4] From the beginning, the Knicks home uniforms are in white with blue and orange trim, while the away uniforms are in blue with orange and white trim. The first iterations contain monotone lettering in blue (home) and orange (away) lettering, with the addition of a checkerboard pattern during the mid-1950s. The Knicks would introduce an iconic logo that would endure for the next three decades. Designed by Bud Freeman, the word \"Knicks\" superimposed over a brown basketball is known as the \"classic roundball logo\", with minor changes throughout its lifespan such as maroon wordmark and orange basketball.[4] An alternate logo featuring the full team name inside an orange basketball was used during the late 1960s and into the 1970s. As the 1960s began, the Knicks updated their uniforms again. This time the lettering is in serifed fonts, and the blue lettering and numbers on the home uniforms are now trimmed in orange. The away uniforms maintained the orange lettering but added white trim; it later changed to white letters while adding white trim on the piping. Side stripes were also added to the uniform. The \"NY\" monogram is on the left leg of the shorts. The Knicks unveiled a uniform that would stay for three decades. This uniform, with an arched \"NEW YORK\" in serif lettering and in orange, would be the uniform worn during their 1970 and 1973 championship seasons; however, they were not introduced simultaneously. The home uniforms would debut in 1968, while the away uniforms debuted the following year. One noticeable feature was that the player's name was in a straight block arched lettering (which is also called the \"vertical arch\" style), which was meticulously designed by Gerry Cosby and his sporting goods company. The unusual arrangement on the player's name was later adopted by several Major League Baseball teams in the 1970s, and are currently used by the National Hockey League's Colorado Avalanche, Detroit Red Wings and New York Rangers. On the shorts, there was no logo placed during much of the 1970s, but during the 1978–79 season, the side stripes were eliminated and the interlocking \"NY\" logo inside an apple was placed instead. When this uniform style was reinstated for the 1983–84 season,[214] it now featured the player's number and the interlocking \"NY\" logo (similar to the \"NY\" on the iconic New York Yankees pinstripe uniform), in addition to the return of the side stripes. The shorts number was eliminated in 1987, while variations of the \"roundball logo\" replaced the \"NY\" logo from 1991 to 1997. Since the 1991–92 season various outfitters such as Champion, Puma, Reebok, Adidas, and Nike have taken over uniform production from Cosby, with player names on the back reverted to a radial arch and added serifs. The Knicks radically changed their uniforms prior to the 1979–80 season.[215] Royal blue and orange were replaced by navy and crimson red. During this period, the home uniforms featured the team name below the number, both in crimson red with navy trim and in a stylized, free-flowing font. Navy away uniforms continue to feature the city name but below the white and crimson red number. The interlocking \"NY\" logo debuted on the shorts, with the addition of player numbers and side stripes during the 1981–82 season. The change to crimson red and navy was initiated by then-team president E. Michael Burke, whose alma mater University of Pennsylvania wore those colors. The \"Knicks\" script from the \"crimson red era\" uniforms was later reused in the uniforms of the Knicks' NBA Development League affiliate Westchester Knicks, with the same team name below the number format. Before the 1992–93 season, the Knicks updated their \"roundball logo\" to its present form, with the word \"Knicks\" in a futuristic font, again superimposed over a basketball, with a silver triangle accentuating the look. The \"new look\" logo was designed by Tom O'Grady.[4] For the 1995–96 season, the city name in a futuristic script was added atop the logo, while an alternate \"subway token\" logo featuring the acronym \"NYK\" was introduced. Black was also introduced as an accent color. The logo was added while the \"championship era\" uniforms were still in use, but during the 1995–96 season, the Knicks unveiled a blue alternate uniform, this time featuring black side stripes and the aforementioned \"subway token\" logo on the shorts' beltline. A home white version of this uniform was introduced for the 1997–98 season, effectively retiring the championship era uniforms. In the 2001–02 season, the side stripes were narrowed, while the \"subway token\" logo was moved to the back of the uniform, and the Knicks primary logo moved from the side to the front of the shorts. The Knicks updated their \"new look logo\", this time eliminating the color black from the scheme. They still used the previous uniform during the 2011–12 season, but for the 2012–13 season, the Knicks unveiled new uniforms inspired from their \"championship era\" uniforms. A more subtle and bolder \"New York\" script was introduced, while the uniform piping stopped until the lettering. The phrase Once A Knick, Always A Knick is added on the uniform collar. Gray became the accent color. In addition, an updated version of their 1970s secondary logo, this time featuring only the team name, was introduced.[216] On October 25, 2013, the Knicks unveiled an alternate orange uniform, which is essentially a mirror image of the blue away uniforms, but with orange as the primary color and blue and white as trim colors.[217] The uniforms debuted on October 31 in a road game against the Chicago Bulls, and were used in the first five weekend home games, but after going 0–6 in the orange uniforms, they were discontinued permanently. Beginning with the 2017–18 season, Nike became the NBA's new uniform provider.[218][219] Under Nike, \"home\" and \"away\" uniform designations were eliminated, and in their place were the white \"Association\" set, primary color \"Icon\" set, alternate color \"Statement\" set, and annual \"City\" set that were used either at home or away.[220][221] The Knicks kept their white \"Association\" and blue \"icon\" uniforms almost intact with only a few alterations such as truncated shoulder and shorts striping and the modern roundball logo on the waistband.[222] From 2017 to 2019, the Knicks' \"statement\" uniform featured a white base with lettering in orange with white and blue trim. The striping was inspired from the team's 1970s-era uniforms.[223] In the 2019–20 season, the Knicks changed their Statement uniform to a blue base and white lettering with blue and orange trim. The white letters were a nod to the team's 1960s blue uniforms. As with the previous \"statement\" uniform, the striping was based on the team's 1970s uniforms.[224] Before the 2022–23 season, the \"statement\" uniform was again changed, this time with a navy base and orange gradient striping. The 1995–2011 \"New Look\" logo was placed on either side of the shorts. Letters are orange with blue trim.[225] The Knicks have also worn special edition uniforms every March as part of the NBA's Noche Latina events and during St. Patrick's Day. The uniforms during Noche Latina were originally white with blue and orange trim, first using the 2001–12 uniform from 2008 to 2012, and then the current uniforms from 2012 to 2015, the only exception being Nueva York in front. In the 2015–16 season, the Knicks used a variation of their away blue uniform for Noche Latina. The Saint Patrick's Day uniforms used the road uniform template except for green substituting for the blue base. These uniforms have also been used on Christmas Day from the 2009–10 season, and was worn in particular by Nate Robinson for a \"Kryptonate vs. Superman\" theme against Dwight Howard in the 2009 Slam Dunk Contest. The St. Patrick's uniforms were shelved after the 2011–12 season. On Christmas Day 2012, the Knicks wore monochrome uniforms known as \"big color\". The uniforms are mostly orange, with blue trimming. The following year, the Knicks wore sleeved orange uniforms known as \"big logo\", featuring a chrome-treated Knicks logo in front. For the 2014 edition, the Knicks wore a variation of their home uniforms, featuring the team logo in front and the player's first name in a blue nameplate below the number. The 2016 Christmas Day game against the Celtics saw the Knicks wear an all-blue uniform without additional striping, complete with fancy scripted orange lettering and numbers. As part of its deal with Nike, a special \"city\" uniform would be used to pay tribute to either local culture or team traditions. The Knicks' 2017–18 \"city\" uniform, which is navy with orange and grey trim and features an emblem containing the team name, uniform number, a ladder with a silhouette of a firefighter, a fire hydrant, and the abbreviation \"N.Y.C.\" for New York City, pays homage to the city's firefighters and their families. It was designed in collaboration with the Knicks, the NBA, Nike and the Uniformed Firefighters Association.[226] The Knicks' second \"city\" uniform is also in navy and features white lettering, a straight aligned \"New York\" wordmark in front and alternating stripes of blue, navy and orange designed to mimic the New York City skyline. The blue and orange arm striping was inspired from the team's 1950s uniforms. The Knicks initially debuted the uniform in the 2018–19 season, and was retained the following season.[227] The Knicks' 2020–21 \"city\" uniform is designed in collaboration with Kith. The uniform is predominantly black with blue and orange side gradients. The roundel in front features both the full team name and the \"city never sleeps\" nickname in a white, blue and orange gradient, and white numbers with blue drop shadows are added inside. The \"NYC\" acronym in black and white trim is placed within the Nike mark.[228] The Knicks' 2021–22 \"city\" uniform featured another collaboration with Kith. The predominantly black uniform featured the classic \"New York\" wordmark in white with orange trim, and orange numbers with white trim. Those elements, along with the 1992 \"New Look\" logo on the waist, paid tribute to the 1995–2001 blue uniforms. Along the side, black and gray checkerboard stripes were an homage to the 1950s set. A silhouette of the classic Madison Square Garden logo was added to the side stripes on the shorts.[229] Another Kith-collaborated \"city\" uniform was released in the 2022–23 season. This design was inspired by the blue uniforms they wore from 1995 to 2001, but with black as the base color.[230] The 2023–24 \"City\" uniform, again under a collaboration with Kith, was yet another nod to the late 1990s–early 2000s uniform design. In a first for the franchise, dark blue pinstripes were added to the blue-based uniform, and two \"New York\" wordmarks in both white and orange were layered twice on the top, in a nod to the iconic saying “the city so nice, they named it twice.” Black and orange side stripes were also featured.[231] This uniform, albeit in white, was reused as part of the 2024–25 \"City\" uniform.[232] The Knicks were one of several NBA teams to wear throwback uniforms during the league's 50th anniversary in the 1996–97 season. The throwback set they wore that season represented the franchise's first season in 1946–47. However, both the blue and white throwbacks featured blue letters with orange trim (the originals had only orange letters on the blue uniform and blue letters on the white uniform minus any additional trim). In the 2004–05 season, the Knicks wore throwback white uniforms from the \"maroon era\" of the early 1980s. The only difference from the originals was that the letters on the player's name were arranged in a radial arch (the originals were designed in a vertical arch) and were smaller in size. The following season, the Knicks wore throwback blue checkerboard uniforms from the mid-1950s, which featured the \"Father Knickerbocker\" logo on the left leg (the originals did not feature said logo). For the 2007–08 season, the Knicks wore their classic white uniforms as a tribute to the early 1970s championship teams. As with the \"maroon era\" throwbacks, the player's name no longer appeared in a vertical arch and were smaller in size. In addition, the original \"roundball\" logo was added (the original uniforms had no logo on the shorts). The 2010–11 season saw the Knicks wear the blue uniforms to commemorate the 40th anniversary of the 1969–70 championship team. However, the design they wore that season faithfully replicated those of the 1991–92 Knicks team, complete with radially-arched serifed block letters on the player's name and the \"roundball\" logo on the shorts. In the original version, the shorts had no logo while the player name is arranged in a vertical arch and in a sans-serif block font. In the 2015–16 season, the Knicks wore throwback white versions of the mid-1950s checkerboard uniforms in commemoration of the franchise's 70th season. In the 2021–22 season, the Knicks, along with the Celtics and Warriors, were one of three teams to wear a \"classic edition\" uniform to commemorate each franchise and the NBA's 75th anniversary. The Knicks design harkened back to the original white uniforms from 1946, complete with enlarged blue numbers, blue waistbands, and blue and orange side stripes. Roster Last transaction: December 23, 2024 The Knicks hold the draft rights to the following unsigned draft picks who have been playing outside the NBA. A drafted player, either an international draftee or a college draftee who is not signed by the team that drafted him, is allowed to sign with any non-NBA teams. In this case, the team retains the player's draft rights in the NBA until one year after the player's contract with the non-NBA team ends.[233] This list includes draft rights that were acquired from trades with other teams. Notes: Notes: The following Knicks players were selected to the NBA All-Star Game.[250] Steve Mills served as general manager and president during the 2013–14 season.[251] At the end of the 2013–14 season Phil Jackson replaced Mills as team's president.[164] He was reinstated as president in 2017, with Scott Perry replacing him as general manager.[173] Team presidents Owners Bold denotes still active with team.

The rivalry stems from the old rivalry between the cities of New York City and Boston, which is also mirrored in both the Yankees–Red Sox and Jets–Patriots rivalries. The fact that Boston and New York City are only 190 miles apart contributes to it. The teams have met nine times in the postseason. The last time was in the 2012–13 season, when Carmelo Anthony won the 2013 scoring title and helped them win the Atlantic Division for the first time since 1994. The Knicks faced the Celtics, who were without Rajon Rondo because of a mid-season injury, in the 1st round of the 2013 playoffs. In both games 1 and 2, Celtics had a lead going into halftime but were held to 25 and 23 points respectively in the second half, which was an all-time low for the franchise in the playoffs. Knicks gained a 3–0 lead in the series, but Boston avoided elimination in games 4 and 5. In game six, Knicks once led by 26 points in the fourth quarter, then the Celtics went onto a 20–0 run in less than 5 minutes to make it a close game, but Knicks still won and moved on to round 2. The Brooklyn Nets, formerly the New Jersey Nets, are the Knicks' closest rival geographically. Both teams play in New York City, with the Knicks in Manhattan and the Nets in Brooklyn. Media outlets have noted the Knicks-Nets rivalry's similarity to those of other New York City teams, such as Major League Baseball's Subway Series rivalry between the American League's New York Yankees (the Bronx) and the National League's New York Mets (Queens), due to both boroughs' proximity through the New York City Subway. Historically, the boroughs of Manhattan and Brooklyn competed via the Dodgers–Giants rivalry, when the two teams were known as the Brooklyn Dodgers and the New York Giants. Like the Knicks and Nets, the Giants and Dodgers played in Manhattan and Brooklyn, respectively, and were fierce divisional rivals.[267] The rivalry between the New York Islanders and New York Rangers of the National Hockey League also had this distinction when the Islanders played in Brooklyn from 2015 to 2020.[268] Due to the Knicks and Nets being located in the boroughs of Manhattan and Brooklyn, some media outlets have dubbed this rivalry \"Clash of the Boroughs\".[269] The Knicks and Nets have met in the playoffs three times, with the Knicks winning two of the three meetings. The Knicks defeated the Nets in the playoffs in 1983 and 1994, while the Nets won their most recent meeting in 2004. The Knicks have a strong rivalry with the Chicago Bulls. The rivalry's most intense period was during the late 1980s and early 90s, when both teams were huge playoff contenders. This intensity was due to a variety of factors: the great frequency in which the teams competed against each other in high-stakes contests and playoff series; well-known players such as Michael Jordan, Scottie Pippen, Patrick Ewing, and John Starks; the reputations of the team's respective cities; and personnel changes and conflicts between the teams. The rivalry was dormant through much of the 2000s, with both teams rebuilding after the retirements of Patrick Ewing and Michael Jordan. However, with the arrival of future NBA MVP Derrick Rose in 2008, the Chicago Bulls began experiencing success once again. In the summer of 2010, the Bulls signed Carlos Boozer and the Knicks signed Amar'e Stoudemire, making both teams playoff contenders once again. Carmelo Anthony and Tyson Chandler joined the Knicks soon after, and the rivalry between the two teams appears to have been reborn. The rivalry between the New York Knicks and the Indiana Pacers started in 1993 and quickly became one of the most bitter in NBA history. They met in the playoffs 6 times from 1993 to 2000, fueling a rivalry epitomized by the enmity between Reggie Miller and prominent Knick fan Spike Lee. Miller likened it to the Hatfield–McCoy feud, and The New York Times said in 1998 that it was \"as combustible as any in the league\". The rivalry gave Miller the nickname \"The Knick-Killer\". His clutch performances were frequently followed by jabs at Lee like the choke sign, adding fuel to the rivalry. The rivalry renewed during the 2013 NBA playoffs in the Eastern Conference Semifinals, with Indiana taking the series 4 games to 2, and again in the second round of the 2024 NBA playoffs, where the Pacers upset the Knicks in seven games. The Miami Heat were one of the New York Knicks' strongest inter-divisional foes. The two teams met in the playoffs each year from 1997 to 2000, with all four of those series being played to the maximum number of games. Pat Riley, the head coach of the Miami Heat at the time, served as the head coach of the Knicks from 1991 to 1995 and led the Knicks to the 1994 NBA Finals. During this four-year span, the Heat and the Knicks each won two playoff series against each other. The two teams met again in the first round of the 2012 NBA playoffs, for the first time since the 1990s rivalry days. The Heat won the series, 4–1, and later went on to win the 2012 NBA Finals.",

                "content": "Stephen Glenn Martin (born August 14, 1945) is an American comedian, actor, writer, producer, and musician. Known for his work in comedy films, television, and recording, he has received many accolades, including five Grammy Awards, a Primetime Emmy Award and an Honorary Academy Award,[1] in addition to nominations for two Tony Awards. He also received the Mark Twain Prize for American Humor in 2005, the Kennedy Center Honors in 2007, and an AFI Life Achievement Award in 2015. In 2004, Comedy Central ranked Martin at sixth place in a list of the 100 greatest stand-up comics.[2] The Guardian named him one of the best actors never to have received an Academy Award nomination.[3] Martin first came to public notice as a writer for The Smothers Brothers Comedy Hour, for which he won a Primetime Emmy Award in 1969, and later as a frequent host on Saturday Night Live. He became one of the most popular U.S. stand-up comedians during the 1970s, performing his brand of offbeat, absurdist comedy routines before sold-out theaters on national tours. He then starred in films such as The Jerk (1979), Dead Men Don't Wear Plaid (1982), The Man with Two Brains (1983), All of Me (1984), ¡Three Amigos! (1986), Planes, Trains and Automobiles (1987), Dirty Rotten Scoundrels (1988), L.A. Story (1991), Bowfinger (1999) and Looney Tunes: Back in Action (2003). He played family patriarchs in Parenthood (1989), the Father of the Bride films (1991–1995), Bringing Down the House (2003), and the Cheaper by the Dozen films (2003–2005). Since 2015, Martin has embarked on several national comedy tours with fellow comedian Martin Short.[4] In 2018, they released their Netflix special An Evening You Will Forget for the Rest of Your Life which received four Primetime Emmy Award nominations. In 2021, he co-created and starred in his first television show, the Hulu comedy series Only Murders in the Building, alongside Short and Selena Gomez, for which he earned three Primetime Emmy Award nominations, two Screen Actors Guild Award nominations, a Golden Globe Award nomination, and a 2021 Peabody Award nomination. In 2022, Martin and Short co-hosted Saturday Night Live together with Gomez making an appearance. Martin is also known for writing the books to the musical Bright Star (2016) and to the comedy Meteor Shower (2017), both of which premiered on Broadway; he co-wrote the music to the former. He has played banjo since an early age and has included music in his comedy routines from the beginning of his professional career. He has released several music albums and has performed with various bluegrass acts, including Earl Scruggs. He has won three Grammy Awards for his music.[5] Stephen Glenn Martin was born on August 14, 1945,[6][7] in Waco, Texas,[8] the son of Mary Lee (née Stewart; 1913–2002) and Glenn Vernon Martin (1914–1997), a real estate salesman and aspiring actor.[9][10] He has an older sister, Melinda.[11] Martin is of English, Scottish, Welsh, Scots-Irish, German, and French descent and grew up in Inglewood, California, with his sister and then later in Garden Grove, California, in a Baptist family.[12] Steve was a cheerleader at Garden Grove High School.[13] One of his earliest memories is seeing his father, as an extra serving drinks onstage at the Callboard Theater on Melrose Place in West Hollywood, California. During World War II, in the United Kingdom, his father appeared in a production of Our Town with Raymond Massey. Expressing his affection through gifts like cars and bikes, Steve's father was stern and not emotionally open to his son.[14] He was proud but critical, with Steve later recalling that in his teens his feelings for his father were mostly of hatred.[15] Steve Martin's first job was at Disneyland, selling guidebooks on weekends and full-time during his school's summer break. The work lasted for three years (1955–1958). During his free time, he frequented the Main Street Magic shop, where tricks were demonstrated to patrons.[14] While working at Disneyland, he was captured in the background of the home movie that was made into the short-subject film Disneyland Dream, incidentally becoming his first film appearance. By 1960, he had mastered several magic tricks and illusions and took a paying job at the Magic shop in Fantasyland in August. There he perfected his talents for magic, juggling, and creating balloon animals in the manner of mentor Wally Boag,[16] frequently performing for tips.[17] In his authorized biography, close friend Morris Walker suggests that Martin could \"be described most accurately as an agnostic ... he rarely went to church and was never involved in organized religion of his own volition\".[18] In his early 20s, Martin dated Melissa Trumbo, daughter of novelist and screenwriter Dalton Trumbo. After high school, Martin attended Santa Ana College, taking classes in drama and English poetry. In his free time, he teamed up with friend and Garden Grove High School classmate Kathy Westmoreland to participate in comedies and other productions at the Bird Cage Theatre. He joined a comedy troupe at Knott's Berry Farm.[14] Later, he met budding actress Stormie Sherk, and they developed comedy routines and became romantically involved. Sherk's influence caused Martin to apply to the California State University, Long Beach, for enrollment with a major in philosophy.[14] Sherk enrolled at UCLA, about an hour's drive north, and the distance eventually caused them to lead separate lives.[19] Inspired by his philosophy classes, Martin considered becoming a professor instead of an actor-comedian. Being at college changed his life. It changed what I believe and what I think about everything. I majored in philosophy. Something about non sequiturs appealed to me. In philosophy, I started studying logic, and they were talking about cause and effect, and you start to realize, 'Hey, there is no cause and effect! There is no logic! There is no anything!' Then it gets real easy to write this stuff because all you have to do is twist everything hard—you twist the punch line, you twist the non sequitur so hard away from the things that set it up.[20] Martin recalls reading a treatise on comedy that led him to think: What if there were no punch lines? What if there were no indicators? What if I created tension and never released it? What if I headed for a climax, but all I delivered was an anticlimax? What would the audience do with all that tension? Theoretically, it would have to come out sometime. But if I kept denying them the formality of a punch line, the audience would eventually pick their own place to laugh, essentially out of desperation.[21] Martin periodically spoofed his philosophy studies in his 1970s stand-up act, comparing philosophy with studying geology. If you're studying geology, which is all facts, as soon as you get out of school you forget it all, but philosophy you remember just enough to screw you up for the rest of your life.[22] In 1967, Martin transferred to UCLA and switched his major to theater. While attending college, he appeared in an episode of The Dating Game, winning a date with Deana Martin. Martin began working local clubs at night, to mixed notices, and at twenty-one, he dropped out of college.[23] In 1967, his former girlfriend Nina Goldblatt, a dancer on The Smothers Brothers Comedy Hour, helped Martin land a writing job with the show by submitting his work to head writer Mason Williams.[24] Williams initially paid Martin out of his own pocket. Along with the other writers for the show, Martin won an Emmy Award[25] in 1969 at the age of twenty-three.[14] He wrote for The Glen Campbell Goodtime Hour and The Sonny & Cher Comedy Hour. Martin's first television appearance was on The Smothers Brothers Comedy Hour in 1968. He says: [I] appeared on The Virginia Graham Show, circa 1970. I looked grotesque. I had a hairdo like a helmet, which I blow-dried to a puffy bouffant, for reasons I no longer understand. I wore a frock coat and a silk shirt, and my delivery was mannered, slow and self-aware. I had absolutely no authority. After reviewing the show, I was depressed for a week.[21] During these years his roommates included Gary Mule Deer and Michael Johnson.[26] Gary Mule Deer supplied the first joke Martin submitted to Tommy Smothers for use on the Smothers Brothers Comedy Hour show.[27] Martin opened for groups such as The Nitty Gritty Dirt Band (who returned the favor by appearing in his 1980 television special All Commercials), The Carpenters, and Toto. He appeared at The Boarding House, among other venues. He continued to write, earning an Emmy nomination for his work on Van Dyke and Company in 1976. In the mid-1970s, Martin made frequent appearances as a stand-up comedian on The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson,[21] and on The Gong Show, HBO's On Location, The Muppet Show,[28] and NBC's Saturday Night Live (SNL). SNL's audience jumped by a million viewers when he made guest appearances, and he was one of the show's most successful hosts.[14] Martin has appeared on twenty-seven Saturday Night Live shows and guest-hosted sixteen times, second only to Alec Baldwin, who has hosted seventeen times as of February 2017[update]. On the show, Martin popularized the air quotes gesture.[29] While on the show, Martin grew close to several cast members, including Gilda Radner. On the night she died of ovarian cancer, a visibly shaken Martin hosted SNL and featured footage of himself and Radner together in a 1978 sketch. In the 1970s, his television appearances led to the release of comedy albums that went platinum.[14] The track \"Excuse Me\" on his first album, Let's Get Small (1977), helped establish a national catch phrase.[14] His next album, A Wild and Crazy Guy (1978), was an even bigger success, reaching the No. 2 spot on the U.S. sales chart, selling over a million copies. \"Just a wild and crazy guy\" became another of Martin's known catchphrases.[14] The album featured a character based on a series of Saturday Night Live sketches in which Martin and Dan Aykroyd played the Festrunk Brothers; Yortuk and Georgi were bumbling Czechoslovak would-be playboys. The album ends with the song \"King Tut\", written and sung by Martin and backed by the \"Toot Uncommons\", members of the Nitty Gritty Dirt Band. It was later released as a single, reaching No. 17 on the U.S. charts in 1978 and selling over a million copies.[14][30] The song came out during the King Tut craze that accompanied the popular traveling exhibit of the Egyptian king's tomb artifacts. Both albums won Grammys for Best Comedy Recording in 1977 and 1978, respectively. Martin performed \"King Tut\" on the April 22, 1978, SNL program. Decades later, in 2012, The A.V. Club described Martin's unique style and its effect on audiences: [Martin was] both a consummate entertainer and a glib, knowing parody of a consummate entertainer. He was at once a hammy populist with an uncanny, unprecedented feel for the tastes of a mass audience and a sly intellectual whose goofy shtick cunningly deconstructed stand-up comedy.[31] On his comedy albums, Martin's stand-up is self-referential and sometimes self-mocking. It mixes philosophical riffs with sudden spurts of \"happy feet\", banjo playing with balloon depictions of concepts like venereal disease, and the \"controversial\" kitten juggling (he is a master juggler; the \"kittens\" were stuffed animal toys). His style is off-kilter and ironic and sometimes pokes fun at stand-up comedy traditions, such as Martin opening his act (from A Wild and Crazy Guy) by saying: I think there's nothing better for a person to come up and do the same thing over and over for two weeks. This is what I enjoy, so I'm going to do the same thing over and over and over [...] I'm going to do the same joke over and over in the same show, it'll be like a new thing. Or: \"Hello, I'm Steve Martin, and I'll be out here in a minute.\"[29][32] In one comedy routine, used on the Comedy Is Not Pretty! album, Martin claimed that his real name was \"Gern Blanston\". The riff took on a life of its own. There is a Gern Blanston website, and for a time a rock band took the moniker as its name.[33] Martin's show soon required full-sized stadiums for the audiences he was drawing. Concerned about his visibility in venues on such a scale, Martin began to wear a distinctive three-piece white suit that became a trademark for his act.[34] Martin stopped doing stand-up comedy in 1981 to concentrate on movies and did not return for thirty-five years.[14] About the decision, he said, \"My act was conceptual. Once the concept was stated, and everybody understood it, it was done... It was about coming to the end of the road. There was no way to live on in that persona. I had to take that fabulous luck of not being remembered as that, exclusively. You know, I didn't announce that I was stopping. I just stopped.\"[35] In 2016, Martin made a low-key comeback to live comedy, opening for Jerry Seinfeld. He performed a ten-minute stand-up routine before turning the stage over to Seinfeld.[36] Also in 2016 he staged a national tour with Martin Short and the Steep Canyon Rangers, which yielded a 2018 Netflix comedy special, Steve Martin and Martin Short: An Evening You Will Forget for the Rest of Your Life.[37] The special received four Primetime Emmy Award nominations with Martin receiving two nominations for Outstanding Writing for a Variety Special and Outstanding Music and Lyrics for \"The Buddy Song\". By the end of the 1970s, Martin had acquired the kind of following normally reserved for rock stars, with his tour appearances typically occurring at sold-out arenas filled with tens of thousands of screaming fans. But unknown to his audience, stand-up comedy was \"just an accident\" for him; his real goal was to get into film.[20] Martin had a small role in the 1972 film Another Nice Mess. In 1974, he starred in the Canadian travelogue production The Funnier Side Of Eastern Canada, created to promote tourism in Montreal and Toronto, which also included standup segments filmed at the Ice House in Pasadena, California.[38] His first substantial film appearance was in a short titled The Absent-Minded Waiter (1977). The seven-minute-long film, also featuring Buck Henry and Teri Garr, was written by and starred Martin. The film was nominated for an Academy Award as Best Short Film, Live Action. He made his first substantial feature film appearance in the musical Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band, where he sang The Beatles' \"Maxwell's Silver Hammer\". In 1979, Martin starred in the comedy film The Jerk, directed by Carl Reiner, and written by Martin, Michael Elias, and Carl Gottlieb. The film was a huge success, grossing over $100 million on a budget of approximately $4 million.[39] Stanley Kubrick met with him to discuss the possibility of Martin starring in a screwball comedy version of Traumnovelle (Kubrick later changed his approach to the material, the result of which was 1999's Eyes Wide Shut). Martin was executive producer for Domestic Life, a prime-time television series starring friend Martin Mull, and a late-night series called Twilight Theater. It emboldened Martin to try his hand at his first serious film, Pennies from Heaven (1981), based on the 1978 BBC serial by Dennis Potter. He was anxious to perform in the movie because of his desire to avoid being typecast. To prepare for that film, Martin took acting lessons from director Herbert Ross and spent months learning how to tap dance. The film was a financial failure; Martin's comment at the time was \"I don't know what to blame, other than it's me and not a comedy.\"[40] Martin was in three more Reiner-directed comedies after The Jerk: Dead Men Don't Wear Plaid in 1982, The Man with Two Brains in 1983 and All of Me in 1984, his most critically acclaimed performance up to that point.[41][42][43] Martin was by now requesting almost $3 million per film, but Plaid and Two Brains both failed at the box office like Pennies, endangering his young career.[44] In 1986, Martin joined fellow Saturday Night Live veterans Martin Short and Chevy Chase in ¡Three Amigos!, directed by John Landis, and written by Martin, Lorne Michaels, and singer-songwriter Randy Newman. It was originally entitled The Three Caballeros and Martin was to be teamed with Dan Aykroyd and John Belushi. In 1986, Martin was in the movie musical film version of the hit Off-Broadway play Little Shop of Horrors (based on a famous B-movie), playing the sadistic dentist, Orin Scrivello. The film was the first of three films teaming Martin with Rick Moranis. In 1987, Martin joined comedian John Candy in the John Hughes movie Planes, Trains and Automobiles.[45] That same year, Martin starred in Roxanne, the film adaptation of Cyrano de Bergerac, which he co-wrote and won him a Writers Guild of America Award. It also garnered recognition from Hollywood and the public that he was more than a comedian. In 1988, he performed in the Frank Oz film Dirty Rotten Scoundrels, a remake of Bedtime Story, alongside Michael Caine. Also in 1988, he appeared at the Mitzi E. Newhouse Theater at Lincoln Center in a revival of Waiting for Godot directed by Mike Nichols.[46] He played Vladimir, with Robin Williams as Estragon and Bill Irwin as Lucky. Martin starred in the Ron Howard film Parenthood with Rick Moranis in 1989. He later re-teamed with Moranis in the Mafia comedy My Blue Heaven (1990). In 1991, Martin starred in and wrote L.A. Story, a romantic comedy, in which the female lead was played by his then-wife Victoria Tennant. Martin also appeared in Lawrence Kasdan's Grand Canyon, in which he played the tightly wound Hollywood film producer, Davis, who was recovering from a traumatic robbery that left him injured, which was a more serious role for him. Martin also starred in a remake of the comedy Father of the Bride in 1991 (followed by a sequel in 1995) and in the 1992 comedy Housesitter, with Goldie Hawn and Dana Delany. In 1994, he starred in A Simple Twist of Fate; a film adaptation of Silas Marner. In David Mamet's 1997 thriller The Spanish Prisoner, Martin played a darker role as a wealthy stranger who takes a suspicious interest in the work of a young businessman (Campbell Scott). In 1998, Martin guest starred with U2 in the 200th episode of The Simpsons titled \"Trash of the Titans\", providing the voice for sanitation commissioner Ray Patterson, and also voiced Hotep in the animated film The Prince of Egypt. In 1999, Martin and Hawn starred in a remake of the 1970 Neil Simon comedy, The Out-of-Towners, and Martin went on to star with Eddie Murphy in the comedy Bowfinger, which he also wrote. He also appeared in Disney's Fantasia 2000 to introduce the segment Pines of Rome, along with Itzhak Perlman. By 2003, Martin ranked fourth on the box office stars list, after starring in Bringing Down the House (2003) and Cheaper by the Dozen (2003), each of which earned over $130 million at U.S. theaters. That same year, he also played the villainous Mr. Chairman in the animation/live action blend, Looney Tunes: Back in Action. In 2005, Martin wrote and starred in Shopgirl, based on his own novella (2000), and starred in Cheaper by the Dozen 2. In 2006, he starred in the box office hit The Pink Panther, as the bumbling Inspector Clouseau. He reprised the role in 2009's The Pink Panther 2. When combined, the two films grossed over $230 million at the box office. In the comedy Baby Mama (2008), starring Tina Fey and Amy Poehler, Martin played the founder of a health food company. Martin also appeared as a guest star in 30 Rock as Gavin Volure in the episode Gavin Volure. He was nominated for an Outstanding Guest Actor in a Comedy Series. The following year he starred in Nancy Meyers' romantic comedy It's Complicated (2009), opposite Meryl Streep and Alec Baldwin. In 2009, an article in The Guardian listed Martin as one of the best actors never to receive an Oscar nomination.[47] During the 2010s, Martin sparsely appeared in film and television. In 2011, he appeared with Jack Black, Owen Wilson, and JoBeth Williams in the birdwatching comedy The Big Year directed by David Frankel. The film was criticized for its lightweight story and was a box office bomb. After a three-year hiatus, Martin returned in 2015 when he voiced a role in the DreamWorks animated film Home alongside Jim Parsons and Rihanna. The film received mixed critical reception but was a financial success. In 2016, he played a supporting role in Ang Lee's war drama Billy Lynn's Long Halftime Walk. He also appeared as himself in Jerry Seinfeld's Netflix series Comedians in Cars Getting Coffee in 2016. He also appeared in the taped version of Oh, Hello on Broadway (2017) as the guest. He also starred in the Netflix comedy special An Evening You Will Forget for the Rest of Your Life with Martin Short in 2018. In 2020, Martin reprised his role as George Banks in the short Father of the Bride, Part 3(ish). Martin stars in and is an executive producer of Only Murders in the Building, a Hulu comedy series alongside Martin Short and Selena Gomez, which he created alongside John Hoffman.[48][49] In August 2022, Martin revealed that the series will likely be his final role, as he does not intend to seek out roles or cameos for other shows or films once the series ends.[50] Martin's first book was Cruel Shoes, a collection of comedic short stories and essays. It was published in 1979 by G. P. Putnam's Sons after a limited release of a truncated version in 1977. Throughout the 1990s, Martin wrote various pieces for The New Yorker. In 2002, he adapted the Carl Sternheim play The Underpants, which ran Off Broadway at Classic Stage Company, and in 2008 co-wrote and produced Traitor, starring Don Cheadle. He has also written the novellas Shopgirl (2000) and The Pleasure of My Company (2003), both more wry in tone than raucous.[51] A story of a 28-year-old woman behind the glove counter at the Saks Fifth Avenue department store in Beverly Hills, Shopgirl was made into a film starring Martin and Claire Danes.[51] The film premiered at the Toronto International Film Festival in September 2005 and was featured at the Chicago International Film Festival and the Austin Film Festival before going into limited release in the US. In 2007, he published a memoir, Born Standing Up, which Time magazine named as one of the Top 10 Nonfiction Books of 2007, ranking it at No. 6, and praising it as \"a funny, moving, surprisingly frank memoir.\"[52] In 2010, he published the novel An Object of Beauty.[53] Beginning in 2019, Martin has collaborated with cartoonist Harry Bliss as a writer for the syndicated single-panel comic Bliss.[54][55] Together, they published the cartoon collection A Wealth of Pigeons.[56] In 2022, they collaborated again for Martin's illustrated autobiography, Number One is Walking.[57] In 1993, Martin wrote his first full-length play, Picasso at the Lapin Agile. The first reading of the play took place in Beverly Hills, California at his home, with Tom Hanks reading the role of Pablo Picasso and Chris Sarandon reading the role of Albert Einstein. Following this, the play opened at the Steppenwolf Theatre Company in Chicago, and played from October 1993 to May 1994, then went on to run successfully in Los Angeles, New York City, and several other US cities.[58] In 2009, the school board in La Grande, Oregon, refused to allow the play to be performed after several parents complained about the content. In an open letter in the local Observer newspaper, Martin wrote: I have heard that some in your community have characterized the play as 'people drinking in bars, and treating women as sex objects.' With apologies to William Shakespeare, this is like calling Hamlet a play about a castle [...] I will finance a non-profit, off-high school campus production [...] so that individuals, outside the jurisdiction of the school board but within the guarantees of freedom of expression provided by the Constitution of the United States can determine whether they will or will not see the play.[59] Inspired by Love has Come for You, Martin and Edie Brickell collaborated on his first musical, Bright Star. It is set in the Blue Ridge Mountains of North Carolina in 1945–46, with flashbacks to 1923. The musical debuted on Broadway on March 24, 2016.[60] Charles Isherwood of The New York Times praised its score by Martin and Brickell writing, \"The shining achievement of the musical is its winsome country and bluegrass score, with music by Mr. Martin and Ms. Brickell, and lyrics by Ms. Brickell...the songs — yearning ballads and square-dance romps rich with fiddle, piano, and banjo, beautifully played by a nine-person band — provide a buoyancy that keeps the momentum from stalling.\"[61] The musical went on to receive five Tony Award nominations including Best Musical. Martin himself received Tony nominations for Best Book of a Musical and Best Original Score and received the Drama Desk Award for Outstanding Music and the Outstanding Critics Circle Award for Best New Score. He also received a Grammy Award for Best Musical Theater Album. Martin's next work as a playwright was the comic play Meteor Shower which opened at San Diego's Old Globe Theatre in August 2016,[62] and went on to Connecticut's Long Wharf Theatre later the same year.[63] The play opened on Broadway at the Booth Theater on November 29, 2017. The cast features Amy Schumer, Laura Benanti, Jeremy Shamos and Keegan-Michael Key, with direction by Jerry Zaks.[64][65] Critic Allison Adaot of Entertainment Weekly wrote, \"Meteor Shower is a very funny play. Keening-like-a-howler-monkey funny. Design-a-new-cry-laughing-emoji funny...In the confident hands of writer and comedy maestro Steve Martin, the premise is polished to sparkling.\"[66] Martin hosted the Academy Awards solo in 2001 and 2003, and with Alec Baldwin in 2010.[67] In 2020, Martin opened the 92nd Academy Awards alongside Chris Rock with comedy material. They were not previously announced as that year's hosts, and joked after their opening monologue, \"Well we've had a great time not hosting tonight\". In 2005, Martin co-hosted Disneyland: The First 50 Magical Years, marking the park's anniversary. Disney continued to run the show until March 2009, which now[when?] plays in the lobby of Great Moments with Mr. Lincoln. A fan of Monty Python, in 1989 Martin hosted the television special, Parrot Sketch Not Included – 20 Years of Monty Python.[68][69] Martin first picked up the banjo when he was around 17 years of age. Martin has stated in several interviews and in his memoir, Born Standing Up, that he used to take 33 rpm bluegrass records and slow them down to 16 rpm and tune his banjo down, so the notes would sound the same. Martin was able to pick out each note and perfect his playing.[citation needed] Martin learned how to play the banjo with help from John McEuen, who later joined the Nitty Gritty Dirt Band. McEuen's brother later managed Martin as well as the Nitty Gritty Dirt Band. Martin did his stand-up routine opening for the band in the early 1970s. He had the band play on his hit song \"King Tut\", being credited as \"The Toot Uncommons\" (as in Tutankhamun).[citation needed] The banjo was a staple of Martin's 1970s stand-up career, and he periodically poked fun at his love for the instrument.[21] On the Comedy Is Not Pretty! album, he included an all-instrumental jam, titled \"Drop Thumb Medley\", and played the track on his 1979 concert tour. His final comedy album, The Steve Martin Brothers (1981), featured one side of Martin's typical stand-up material, with the other side featuring live performances of Steve playing banjo with a bluegrass band. In 2001, he played banjo on Earl Scruggs's remake of \"Foggy Mountain Breakdown\". The recording was the winner of the Best Country Instrumental Performance category at the Grammy Awards of 2002. In 2008, Martin appeared with the band, In the Minds of the Living, during a show in Myrtle Beach, South Carolina.[70] In 2009, Martin released his first all-music album, The Crow: New Songs for the 5-String Banjo with appearances from stars such as Dolly Parton.[71] The album won the Grammy Award for Best Bluegrass Album in 2010.[72] Nitty Gritty Dirt Band member John McEuen produced the album. Martin made his first appearance on The Grand Ole Opry on May 30, 2009.[73] In the American Idol season eight finals, he performed alongside Michael Sarver and Megan Joy in the song \"Pretty Flowers\". Martin is featured playing banjo on \"I Hate Love\" from Kelly Clarkson's tenth studio album Chemistry . It was released as a promotional single on June 2, 2023.[74] Alison Brown co-wrote Foggy Morning Breaking[75] with Martin in 2023, and Wall Guitar in 2024. In June 2009, Martin played banjo along with the Steep Canyon Rangers on A Prairie Home Companion and began a two-month U.S. tour with the Rangers in September, including appearances at the Hardly Strictly Bluegrass festival, Carnegie Hall and Benaroya Hall in Seattle.[76][77] In November, they went on to play at the Royal Festival Hall in London with support from Mary Black.[78] In 2010, Steve Martin and the Steep Canyon Rangers appeared at the New Orleans Jazzfest, Merlefest Bluegrass Festival in Wilkesboro, North Carolina, at Bonnaroo Music Festival, at the ROMP[79] Bluegrass Festival in Owensboro, Kentucky, at the Red Butte Garden Concert series,[80] and on the BBC's Later... with Jools Holland.[81] Martin performed \"Jubilation Day\" with the Steep Canyon Rangers on The Colbert Report on March 21, 2011, on Conan on May 3, 2011, and on BBC's The One Show on July 6, 2011.[82] Martin performed a song he wrote called \"Me and Paul Revere\"[83] in addition to two other songs on the lawn of the Capitol Building in Washington, DC, at the \"Capitol Fourth Celebration\" on July 4, 2011.[84] While on tour, Martin and the Steep Canyon Rangers occasionally performed Martin's 1978 novelty hit song \"King Tut\" live in a bluegrass arrangement. One of these performances was released on the 2011 album Rare Bird Alert.[85] In 2011, Martin also narrated and appeared in the PBS documentary \"Give Me The Banjo\" chronicling the history of the banjo in America.[86] Love Has Come for You, a collaboration album with Edie Brickell, was released in April 2013.[87] The two made musical guest appearances on talk shows, such as The View and Late Show with David Letterman, to promote the album.[88][89][90] The title track won the Grammy Award for Best American Roots Song.[91] Starting in May 2013, he began a tour with the Steep Canyon Rangers and Edie Brickell throughout the United States.[92] In 2015, Brickell and Martin released So Familiar as the second installment of their partnership.[93] In 2017, Martin and Brickell appeared in the multi-award-winning documentary film The American Epic Sessions directed by Bernard MacMahon. Recording live direct-to-disc on the first electrical sound recording system from the 1920s,[94] they performed a version of \"The Coo Coo Bird\" a traditional song that Martin learned from the 1960s folk music group The Holy Modal Rounders.[95] The song was featured on the film soundtrack, Music from The American Epic Sessions released on June 9, 2017.[94] In 2010, Martin created the Steve Martin Prize for Excellence in Banjo and Bluegrass, an award established to reward artistry and bring greater visibility to bluegrass performers.[96] The prize includes a US$50,000 cash award, a bronze sculpture created by the artist Eric Fischl, and a chance to perform with Martin on Late Show with David Letterman. Recipients include Noam Pikelny of the Punch Brothers band (2010),[97] Sammy Shelor of Lonesome River Band (2011),[98] Mark Johnson (2012),[99][100] Jens Kruger (2013),[101] Eddie Adcock (2014),[102] Danny Barnes (2015), Rhiannon Giddens (2016), Scott Vestal (2017), Kristin Scott Benson (2018),[103] and Victor Furtado (2019).[104] At the beginning of his career in comedy, Martin dated writer and artist Eve Babitz, who suggested he dress in what became his trademark white suit.[105] From 1977 to 1980, Martin was in a relationship with Bernadette Peters, with whom he co-starred in The Jerk and Pennies from Heaven. He also dated Karen Carpenter, Mary Tyler Moore and Anne Heche, who wrote about their relationship in her memoir.[106] On November 20, 1986, Martin married actress Victoria Tennant, with whom he co-starred in All of Me and L.A. Story. They divorced in 1994.[107] Martin went on a USO Tour to Saudi Arabia during Operation Desert Storm from October 14 to 21, 1990. He met with military service men and women all over the region signing thousands of autographs and posing for pictures.[108] \"Everybody coming out here, giving up part of their lives for this effort. I had some time off, and I felt kind of bad just sitting there,\" Martin said, \"so I came.\"[109] On July 28, 2007, Martin married writer and former New Yorker staff member Anne Stringfield.[110] Bob Kerrey presided over the ceremony at Martin's Los Angeles home. Lorne Michaels served as best man.[110] The nuptials came as a surprise to several guests, who had been told they were coming for a party.[110] In December 2012, Martin became a father when Stringfield gave birth to their daughter.[111][112] Martin has been an avid art collector since 1968, when he bought a print by Ed Ruscha.[113] In 2001, the Bellagio Gallery of Fine Art presented a five-month exhibit of twenty-eight items from Martin's collection, including works by Roy Lichtenstein, Pablo Picasso, David Hockney, and Edward Hopper.[114] In 2006, he sold Hopper's Hotel Window (1955)[115] at Sotheby's for $26.8 million.[116] In 2015, working with two other curators, he organized an exhibition at the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston and several other locations called, \"The Idea of North: The Paintings of Lawren Harris,\" featuring the works of Canadian painter and Group of Seven co-founder Lawren Harris.[117] In July 2004, Martin purchased what he believed to be Landschaft mit Pferden (Landscape with Horses), a 1915 work by Heinrich Campendonk, from a Paris gallery for approximately €700,000. Fifteen months later, he sold the painting at a Christie's auction to a Swiss businesswoman for €500,000. The painting was later discovered to be a forgery. Police believe the fake Campendonk originated from a collection devised by a German forgery ring led by Wolfgang Beltracchi, pieces from which had been sold to French galleries.[118] Martin only discovered the fact that the painting had been fake many years after it had been sold at the auction. Concerning the experience, Martin said that the Beltracchis \"were quite clever in that they gave it a long provenance and they faked labels, and it came out of a collection that mingled legitimate pictures with faked pictures.\"[119][120] Martin was on the Los Angeles County Museum of Art board of trustees from 1984 to 2004.[121] Martin assisted in launching the National Endowment for Indigenous Visual Arts (NEIVA), a fund to support Australian Indigenous artists in 2021. Martin has supported Indigenous Australian painting previously. He organized an exhibition in 2019 with Gagosian Gallery titled \"Desert Painters of Australia\", which featured art by George Tjungurrayi and Emily Kame Kngwarreye.[122] Martin has tinnitus; the condition was first attributed to filming a pistol shooting scene for Three Amigos in 1986,[123][124] but Martin later clarified that the tinnitus was actually from years of listening to loud music and performing in front of noisy crowds.[125] Martin has said that his comedy influences include Charlie Chaplin, Laurel and Hardy, Jack Benny, Jerry Lewis, and Woody Allen.[126][127] On The Late Show with Stephen Colbert, he mentioned that Jerry Seinfeld is one of his \"retro heroes\", \"a guy who came up behind me and is better than I am. I think he's fantastic, I love to listen to him, he almost puts me at peace. I love to listen to him talk\".[128] Martin's offbeat, ironic, and deconstructive style of humor has influenced many comedians during his career including Tina Fey, Steve Carell, Conan O'Brien, Jon Stewart,[129] Stephen Colbert, Robert Smigel, Bo Burnham,[130] and Jordan Peele.[131] Singer and composer Mike Patton cited Steve Martin as being an early influence[132] saying that he identifies with Martin.[133]",

                "content": "Nordstrom, Inc. (/ˈnɔːrdstrəm/) is an American luxury department store chain headquartered in Seattle, Washington, and founded by John W. Nordstrom and Carl F. Wallin in 1901. The original store operated exclusively as a shoe store, and a second location opened in 1923. The growing chain began selling clothing in 1963, and became the full-line retailer that presently exists by 1971. The company founded its off-price Nordstrom Rack division in 1973, and grew both full-line and off-price divisions throughout the United States in the following years. The full-line division competes with department stores including Bloomingdale's, Macy's, Neiman Marcus, and Saks Fifth Avenue, while the off-price division competes with retailers including the TJX Companies and Ross Stores.[4] Previous expansions beyond the contiguous United States include Puerto Rico (2015–2020) and Canada (2014–2023). John W. Nordstrom was born on February 15, 1871, in the village Alvik near Luleå in Northern Sweden.[5] In 1887, Nordstrom immigrated to the United States at the age of 16.[5][6] His name at birth was Johan Wilhelm Nordström (Swedish pronunciation: [ˈjuːhɑn ˈvɪlhɛlm ˈnuːr(d)strœm]), which he later anglicized to John W. Nordstrom. After landing in New York, he began working in Michigan and was able to save enough money to purchase a 20-acre (81,000 m2) potato farm in Arlington, Washington.[5] In 1897, he joined the Klondike Gold Rush in Canada's Yukon Territory. After two years of prospecting, he finally struck gold, but sold his disputed claim for $13,000.[5] Returning to Seattle with his newfound wealth, he married Hilda Carlson in 1900 and searched for a business venture.[5] Nordstrom eventually settled on a shoe store that opened in 1901, called Wallin & Nordstrom.[6] Carl F. Wallin, the co-founder of the store, was the owner of the adjacent shoe repair shop.[5] John and Hilda had five children, three of whom would follow him into the family business, Everett W. (1903), Elmer J. (1904) and Lloyd N. Nordstrom.[7][8] In 1928, John W. Nordstrom retired and sold his shares to two of his sons, Everett and Elmer. In 1929, Wallin also retired and sold his shares to them. The 1930 grand opening of the remodeled Second Avenue store marked the change of name to Nordstrom. Lloyd Nordstrom subsequently joined the company in 1933, and the three brothers ran the business together for almost forty years.[9] By 1958, Nordstrom had expanded to eight stores in two states but still sold only shoes. Apparel came with its purchase of Best's Apparel of Seattle in 1963, and the company's name was changed to Nordstrom Best.[10] In 1971, the company was taken public on National Association of Securities Dealers Automated Quotations (NASDAQ). It was one of the first companies to be listed on the then-newly established stock exchange.[11] It was moved to the New York Stock Exchange in 1999 under the ticker symbol JWN after John W. Nordstrom, its founder.[10] Their business continued beyond stores in 1974. On December 5, the National Football League announced the signing of a franchise agreement that would put a team in Seattle, Washington. Representing the family as majority partner of the consortium was Lloyd W. Nordstrom. However, he would never see a game as owner, as he died of a heart attack on January 20, 1976, eight months before the newly christened Seattle Seahawks took the field.[12] With his death, the estate of Mr. Nordstrom would oversee the team, with co-owner and entrepreneur Herman Sarkowsky serving as the team's first chief operating officer.[13][14] By 1975, Nordstrom expanded into Alaska (the only time by acquisition) by purchasing Northern Commercial Company and opened its first Nordstrom Rack clearance store in Seattle. A strong northwest regional retailer with sales already approaching $250 million making it the third-largest specialty retailer in the United States, the company opened its first Southern California store at South Coast Plaza in Costa Mesa in 1978.[15] By the early 1990s, it had opened 26 stores plus Racks in California. Subsequent expansion relied on creating a strongly decentralized regional structure, beginning with the Northeast in the Tysons Corner Center in Virginia (1988), the Midwest in the Oakbrook Center in Illinois (1991), the Southeast in Atlanta (1998), and the Southwest in Dallas (1996). In a new region, the initial store was used as a base for training and recruitment for subsequent expansion, and was usually backed by its own distribution center. From 1978 to 1995, Nordstrom opened a total of 46 full-line department stores.[16] In 1976, Nordstrom opened a series of stores called Place Two to sell a more limited selection of apparel in smaller markets. By 1983, there were ten Place Two stores, but the cost of upgrading the smaller stores, especially from a systems perspective, outweighed the benefit, and the division was discontinued.[17] The last two remaining Place Two stores closed on April 1, 1995.[18] In August 1988, the Nordstroms sold the Seahawks to real estate developer Ken Behring and his partner Ken Hofmann for $80 million.[19][20][21] The company also expanded into direct sales in 1993, beginning with a catalog division[22] led by John N.'s son Dan that was followed by an e-commerce business. Nordstrom.com's fulfillment and contact centers are located in Cedar Rapids, Iowa; and Seattle, Washington. Currently, it has distribution centers in Ontario, California; Newark, California; Portland, Oregon; Dubuque, Iowa; Upper Marlboro, Maryland; and Gainesville, Florida. Nordstrom FSB, a wholly owned subsidiary of Nordstrom, Inc., is a federally chartered savings bank doing business as Nordstrom Bank. It was formed in 1991 in Scottsdale, Arizona, with its customer contact center in Centennial, Colorado. Nordstrom FSB was formerly known as Nordstrom National Credit Bank and changed its name to Nordstrom FSB in March 2000. The bank offers various banking and credit products, such as Nordstrom Signature VISA, Nordstrom retail credit and debit cards, interest-bearing checking accounts, check cards, and certificates of deposits. It offers Nordstrom customers cards under Nordstrom Rewards – its customer loyalty program – where customers earn points when making purchases with the card at Nordstrom and other retailers. In 1995, Nordstrom opened their first store location in New York State.[23] It is located at The Westchester, an upscale shopping mall in White Plains, New York, a suburb of New York City. Nordstrom has since opened stores at Roosevelt Field in Garden City, New York in 1997,[24] and Manhattan in 2019.[25] Beginning in 1995, the fourth generation of brothers and cousins had been co-presidents for a time. John Whitacre was appointed as the first non-Nordstrom CEO in 1997.[26] In 1998, Nordstrom replaced its downtown Seattle store with a new flagship location in the former Frederick & Nelson building across the street. A two-year renovation of this location was completed in 2016.[27] At 383,000 square feet (35,600 m2), the downtown Seattle location is the chain's largest store. By contrast, the smallest Nordstrom store, as of September 2008, opened in 1980 in Salem, Oregon, with a total area of just under 72,000 square feet (6,700 m2). This location has since closed. In 1998, Nordstrom opened its first location in the Southeast at Perimeter Mall in Atlanta, Georgia.[28] In 2000, the Nordstrom family reasserted its control, with the sons of Bruce A. (Blake, Erik and Peter) assuming senior roles in the company which they continue to hold.[29] Blake Nordstrom served as sole President of the company from 2000 to 2014 with Erik and Peter joining him as co-Presidents in 2015.[30] Nordstrom sold its stand-alone boutique chain Façonnable in 2007, though it still offers that label in its lineup. In February 2011, Nordstrom announced the acquisition of HauteLook, an LA-based online retailer that offers flash sales on designer goods. The deal included Nordstrom paying $180 million in stock and a three-year \"earn-out\" payment based on HauteLook's financial performance.[31] On May 26, 2011, Nordstrom announced that they would be closing the downtown Indianapolis, Indiana, Circle Center Mall location due to declining business at the site. The remaining location on the north side of the city at the Fashion Mall at Keystone as well as the future Nordstrom Rack store in the Rivers Edge Shopping Center, also on the north side, remained as the only two locations in the state. Erik Nordstrom, president of stores at Nordstrom stated, \"We've enjoyed serving our customers in downtown Indianapolis, but unfortunately our business has declined over the long term for some time and despite our efforts to turn things around we don't see the outlook significantly changing.\"[32] In August 2011, Nordstrom opened the store Treasure & Bond in SoHo, New York. Intended to test the waters of the tumultuous high-end department store scene in New York, all profits of Treasure & Bond are donated to charity. The customer base of the smaller store is thought to be the younger sisters of the typical Nordstrom customer.[33] Nordstrom announced plans to open a Nordstrom Rack in Milwaukee in 2014.[34] In late November 2012, Nordstrom announced that they would also be opening a full-line Nordstrom Department Store in 2015 in Milwaukee at Mayfair Mall, a half-mile away from the Nordstrom Rack location. Milwaukee was the largest metropolitan area in the country that did not have a Nordstrom until 2015. Such unmet demand was highlighted in Nordstrom's decision to open in the Milwaukee area.[35] On January 4, 2013, Nordstrom announced plans for a new location in the Minneapolis-Saint Paul metropolitan region. The store, to be located at the Ridgedale Center, would be the second in the area. Following the success of its Mall of America opening in 1992, Nordstrom sought to expand in the Twin Cities market.[36] Plans for a Ridgedale Center store were first released in 2007, only to be canceled in 2009.[37] The location eventually opened in September 2015. Nordstrom opened a 138,000-square-foot, two-level, full-line store March 2015 in The Mall of San Juan in San Juan, Puerto Rico.[38] After Hurricane Maria in 2017, the store suffered major water damage and it closed temporarily after the hurricane. Nordstrom reopened the store on November 9, 2018.[39] On May 7, 2020, Nordstrom announced that it would not reopen due to COVID-19 pandemic, leaving this store closed permanently. In May 2015, Pete and Erik Nordstrom joined their brother Blake Nordstrom as co-presidents of Nordstrom. This arrangement lasted until Blake Nordstrom's death in January 2019.[40] Before this appointment, Pete Nordstrom was executive vice president and president of merchandising while Erik Nordstrom was executive vice president and president of Nordstrom.com.[40] Nordstrom opened its first Rack location in Philadelphia in the fall of 2014.[41] In the fall of 2015, Nordstrom opened their first Nordstrom Rack store in Delaware.[42] The company is opening its first full-line store in New York City on April 12, 2018, a three-floor store at 57th Street and Broadway, in the Columbus Circle neighborhood.[43] In 2016, Nordstrom entered into a partnership with Tesla Motors under which the automaker opened retail galleries inside the Nordstrom locations in The Grove, Los Angeles, in SouthPark Mall in Charlotte, North Carolina and in Somerset Collection in Troy, Michigan.[44][45] In 2016, Nordstrom began selling products from J. Crew, Olivia Palermo + Chelsea28, Adore Me, and Eloquii.[46][47][48][49] In 2017, Nordstrom announced they would be expanding their natural beauty-focused stations.[50] On February 2, 2017, Bloomberg News reported that Nordstrom would cease to carry Ivanka Trump's branded fashion line, citing weak sales. The retailer cuts 10 percent of its most poorly performing brands each year. Nordstrom's action came after a boycott campaign against retailers carrying products having Trump family labels.[51][52] President Donald Trump responded with a tweet directed at Nordstrom, condemning the brand for its treatment of his daughter. The company's stock dropped by 0.65% in the aftermath of the tweet before ending the day with a gain of more than 4%. Fortune declared this quick recovery to have broken Trump's market-moving \"tweet curse\".[53][54][55][56] In October 2017, Nordstrom launched its first \"Nordstrom Local\" in West Hollywood, which is set to focus on personal shopping and styling, rather than carrying merchandise. In June 2017, Nordstrom Inc.'s founding family, which owned 31.2 percent of the company, said it was looking to take Nordstrom private.[57] In October, the family suspended its efforts, because of trouble completing a financing package.[58] Lenders were asking for 13 percent interest, about twice the typical rate for retailers.[59] On January 2, 2019 Blake Nordstrom, co-president of Nordstrom, died suddenly at the age of 58. He was a lifetime employee of his family's company, rising through the ranks until he became a vice-president and then co-president.[60] In fiscal year 2019, digital sales reached 33% of total sales, marking a growing transition to online retail.[61] On March 3, 2020, Erik Nordstrom became the sole CEO of Nordstrom.[62] On March 16, the company announced that effective the following day, all locations would temporarily close during the COVID-19 pandemic.[63] On May 5, Nordstrom began reopening stores and announced that sixteen locations would permanently close by August.[64][65] In late September, Nordstrom announced that by the end of 2021, their stores and websites would no longer sell products made from fur or exotic skins.[66] In October 2021, Nordstrom announced an agreement with 11 Honoré, an online retailer of plus-sized designer fashion, to sell the company's clothing in Nordstrom stores and on their website.[67] On December 23, 2024, Nordstrom announced their plans to take the company private in a deal valued at $6.25 billion. The plan involves selling 49.9% percent of the company to Mexican department store and real estate company El Puerto de Liverpool, with the remaining 50.1% controlling stake being held by the Nordstrom family. On the deal, CEO Erik Nordstrom stated that “Today marks an exciting new chapter for the business. On behalf of my family, we look forward to working with our teams to ensure Nordstrom thrives long into the future.” [68] Nordstrom Canada Retail, Inc. (French: Les Detaillants Nordstrom Canada, Inc.) was the Canadian division of Nordstrom. It was announced on September 13, 2012, opened its first store on September 19, 2014, and closed its final stores on June 13, 2023. In this market, it competed with Canadian department stores including Holt Renfrew, Hudson's Bay, and Simons.[70] Four full-line Nordstrom stores were announced for the first phase of expansion, with nine full-line stores total expected in the long term.[71] Most of these stores were located in vacated Sears Canada storefronts in Cadillac Fairview-managed shopping centers, including Chinook Centre in Calgary; Rideau Centre in Ottawa; Toronto Eaton Centre in Toronto; and Pacific Centre in Vancouver. The stores at the CF-managed Sherway Gardens and the Oxford-managed Yorkdale Shopping Centre in Toronto were new construction.[72] Of the first four stores announced, the Calgary store was the first to open on September 19, 2014.[73] It was followed by the Ottawa store on March 6, 2015;[74] the Vancouver store on September 18, 2015;[75] and the Sherway Gardens store on September 15, 2017.[76] The Yorkdale store was confirmed on April 8, 2013,[77] and opened on October 21, 2016.[78] The Toronto Eaton Centre was the last of the six stores to be announced on January 15, 2014,[79] however, it was the fourth to open on September 18, 2016.[80] The first Nordstrom Rack opened at Vaughan Mills on March 21, 2018; and then a second location in Deerfoot Meadows in Calgary and a flagship location at One Bloor in Toronto opened on May 3, 2018.[81] Nordstrom Rack opened three other additional stores in Fall 2018; one at Heartland Town Centre in Mississauga, one at Ottawa Trainyards, and finally one at South Edmonton Commons. On March 2, 2023, Nordstrom announced that they would be closing all their Canadian stores, which would entail 2,500 staff losing their jobs. The company stated, \"Despite our best efforts, we do not see a realistic path to profitability for the Canadian business.\"[82] The closing will be done under court supervision within the framework of the Canadian Companies' Creditors Arrangement Act (CCAA), with the help of a third-party liquidator.[83] Liquidation sales began for all locations on March 21, 2023. All Canadian Nordstrom Rack locations closed on May 14, 2023,[84] while all Canadian full-line stores closed on June 13, 2023. As of May 2022[update], there are 100 full-line Nordstrom department stores,[85] which average 140,000 square feet (13,000 m2).[86] Nordstrom holds six annual sales. Two of these are Half-Yearly sales, which take place semi-annually in May and late December, as well as three additional seasonal sales. Nordstrom's largest sale event is the Nordstrom Anniversary Sale, which is held each July.[87] Limited amounts of merchandise set to be released for the following fall are sent to Nordstrom stores early, where they are sold at discount. For ten days prior to Anniversary Sale, Nordstrom gives early access to members who make appointments.[88] Nordstrom Local service hubs are oriented for amenities including online order pickup, personal styling, and tailoring. They do not have their own inventory, and instead source merchandise from full-line stores as needed. As of May 2022[update], there are seven Nordstrom Local locations between New York City and Los Angeles,[85] which average 3,000 square feet (280 m2).[86] Fast casual and full-service restaurants operate within most Nordstrom full-line stores.[89] Nordstrom Rack originated as a bargain basement in the downtown Seattle flagship store in 1973. It has since expanded into an off-price department store chain in its own right. As of May 2022[update], there are 249 Nordstrom Rack locations.[85] Last Chance clearance stores sell merchandise that cannot be resold at Nordstrom or Nordstrom Rack, including Nordstrom Rack returns that exceed the 45-day return policy.[91] As of May 2022[update], there are two Last Chance locations in the Chicago and Phoenix suburbs.[85] As of June 2023[update], Nordstrom operates five flagship stores in four states. They are noted for being considerably smaller than competitors' flagship stores.[92] In 2009, Nordstrom was listed at No. 72 in Fortune magazine's 100 Best Companies to Work For 2009.[97] Nordstrom is a Hall of Fame member of Fortune magazine's \"100 Best Companies to Work For\".[98] Nordstrom was No. 36 on the same list in 2008, No. 24 in 2007, No. 46 in 2006 and No. 88 in 2005.[99] For the 20th year in a row, they made the list coming in at No. 94 in 2017.[100][101] In 2010, it ranked number 53, and dropped to 61 in 2012.[102] In 2018, the company was ranked 183rd on the Fortune 500 list of the largest United States corporations by revenue.[103] In December 2013, the fashion trade magazine, Women's Wear Daily reported Nordstrom as the top fashion retailer.[104] 2019 was the 25th year that Nordstrom was listed on the Fortune 500.[105] 47°36′45″N 122°20′11″W﻿ / ﻿47.61237°N 122.3365°W﻿ / 47.61237; -122.3365",

                "title": "Nordstrom to Be Acquired by Nordstrom Family and Liverpool | Nordstrom",
                "content": "Nordstrom Shareholders to Receive $24.25 Per Share in Cash Transaction Represents a Premium of Approximately 42% Since March 18, 2024 Board Also Intends to Pay Special Dividend of Up to $0.25 Per Share in Cash Contingent on Closing SEATTLE, Dec. 23, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Nordstrom, Inc. (NYSE: JWN) today announced it has signed a definitive agreement under which Erik, Pete, Jamie Nordstrom and other members of the Nordstrom family (collectively, the \"Nordstrom Family\") and El Puerto de Liverpool, S.A.B. de C.V. (\"Liverpool\") (BMV: LIVEPOL) will acquire all of the outstanding common shares of Nordstrom not already beneficially owned by the Nordstrom Family and Liverpool in an all-cash transaction valued at approximately $6.25 billion on an enterprise basis. Following the close of the transaction, the Nordstrom Family will have a majority ownership stake in the Company. Under the terms of the agreement, Nordstrom common shareholders will receive $24.25 in cash for each share of Nordstrom common stock they hold. The merger consideration represents a premium of approximately 42% to the Company's unaffected closing common stock price on March 18, 2024, the last trading day prior to media speculation regarding a potential transaction. In addition, the Board intends to authorize a special dividend of up to $0.25 per share (based on Nordstrom's cash on hand) immediately prior to and contingent on the close of the transaction. Upon completion of the transaction, Nordstrom will become a private company. The Nordstrom Board of Directors, with Erik and Pete Nordstrom recusing themselves, has unanimously approved the proposed transaction upon the unanimous recommendation of a special committee of independent and disinterested directors that led the review and negotiation of this transaction. The special committee, composed of Kirsten Green, Amie Thuener O'Toole and Eric Sprunk, was formed in February 2024 in response to interest expressed by Erik and Pete Nordstrom in exploring a possible transaction during the Board's most recent evaluation of possible avenues to enhance shareholder value. \"The special committee of the Nordstrom Board of Directors reviewed this proposal against the Company's standalone prospects for growth,\" said Eric Sprunk, chairman of the special committee. \"Following a rigorous and independent evaluation and consultation with outside financial and legal advisors, the special committee unanimously concluded that this transaction offers greater value for all public shareholders at a significant premium to the unaffected share price.\" \"The Nordstrom Board regularly considers alternatives to enhance value, culminating in this most recent process,\" added Brad Tilden, chairman of the Nordstrom Board. \"I want to thank the special committee for their diligent and thorough work evaluating and negotiating this transaction over the past several months.\" \"For over a century, Nordstrom has operated with a foundational principle of helping customers feel good and look their best,\" said Erik Nordstrom, chief executive officer of Nordstrom. \"Today marks an exciting new chapter for the business. On behalf of my family, we look forward to working with our teams to ensure Nordstrom thrives long into the future.\" \"We're grateful to the employees, customers and shareholders who have shaped Nordstrom into the company it is today,\" said Pete Nordstrom, chief brand officer of Nordstrom. \"Since our founding in 1901, we have been committed to providing our customers with the best possible service – and to improving it every day. We look forward to building on that commitment in this next phase of the Company's evolution.\" \"Nordstrom is one of the worldwide leaders in department store retailing, and we're thrilled to be investing in a company that has meaningfully shaped the industry for nearly 125 years,\" said Graciano F. Guichard G., executive chairman of the Board of Directors of Liverpool. \"We are honored to partner with the Nordstrom Family and the Company's talented team as they continue to deliver outstanding service to customers.\" Transaction Details The transaction is expected to close in the first half of 2025, subject to regulatory and other conditions, including approval of holders of two-thirds of the Company's common stock and the holders of a majority of the shares of the Company not owned by the Nordstrom Family or Liverpool or their respective affiliates and the Company's directors and Section 16 officers. The transaction will be financed through a combination of rollover equity by the Nordstrom Family and Liverpool, cash commitments by Liverpool, up to $450 million in borrowings under a new $1.2 billion ABL bank financing, and Company cash on hand. The Company's $2.7 billion principal amount of existing senior notes and debentures are expected to remain outstanding following the transaction. As part of the transaction, the Company expects to take actions to secure the Company's existing senior notes and debentures with a second lien on the Company's current assets and related collateral and a first lien on the Company's other assets (excluding real estate), conditioned and effective upon the transaction closing. Following the closing of the transaction, Nordstrom will be owned 50.1% by the Nordstrom Family and 49.9% by Liverpool. In addition to the special dividend (if paid), Nordstrom expects to continue paying regular quarterly cash dividends of 19 cents per share through transaction close, including a pro-rated dividend for any partial quarter immediately prior to the close of the transaction. Upon completion of the transaction, Nordstrom's common stock will no longer be listed on any public market. Advisors Morgan Stanley & Co.

And Nordstrom accepted the return. Years before the local miner had bought a set of tires from a company called Northern Commercial, located in that same space. He had been promised that if the tires didn’t work for him, he could return them. In the intervening years, Nordstrom purchased Northern Commercial and opened its own store, selling women’s clothing and shoes. But no matter. Craig Trounce, the 16-year-old customer service representative behind the counter that day, called a local tire dealer, found out the fair value for the tires (which was $25), and paid the miner $25 from the Nordstrom till. Trounce was staying true to a primary Nordstrom principle: always serve the customer. It’s clear today that “Nordstrom Nice” is a strategy that has paid off. The family-controlled business runs more than 350 Nordstrom, Nordstrom Rack, and Nordstrom Local stores across the United States and Canada, and has a market value of US$3.9 billion as of June 2022. The company has an average of 60,000 full- and part-time employees, a number that swells to 72,000 during the holidays. But let’s start at the beginning… Sixteen-year-old Sweden born, John W. Nordstrom emigrated to the United States in 1887, speaking no English and with just $5 to his name. He travelled the country trying to make a living, working in logging and mining camps, before heading north to Alaska during the gold rush in 1897. Two years later he arrived in Seattle with $13,000, some of which he invested in starting a shoe store with a partner named Carl Wallin. Wallin & Nordstrom opened at Fourth and Pike in Seattle in 1901. The company did well, eventually opening a second storefront. In 1928, John Nordstrom decided to retire and sell his shares of the company to his two sons, Everett and Elmer. Two years later Wallin sold his shares to them as well, and Everett and Elmer renamed the company, Nordstrom. The second-generation Nordstroms took over the family business young: Everett was 26 and Elmer was 24. John’s third son, Lloyd, joined as an equal partner in 1933 when he graduated from the University of Washington. The young men divided responsibilities in the company but held no titles. In 1938, Nordstrom was incorporated, and so by law, they were required to formalize their roles. The eldest, Everett, did not want to be unfair to his brothers, so they settled on a rotating system of titles (president, vice president, and treasurer/secretary), all of them exchanging titles every two years. Nordstrom continued to grow, expanding especially rapidly in suburban areas after World War II. They began leasing space in department stores, along with eight standalone stores of their own and were the largest shoe store in the country by the end of the 1950s. That’s when they made moves into women’s clothing, acquiring retailers Best’s Apparel and Nicholas Unger. The third-generation Nordstroms (Everett’s son Bruce, and Elmer’s sons James and John) had started working at the company as kids, sweeping floors and breaking down boxes. By the late 1960s, they were vice presidents at the company. Throughout their time leading Nordstrom, Everett, Elmer, and Lloyd had paid themselves equal salaries. Enough to look after their families, but nothing more. Everything else they reinvested back into the business. In 1967, they didn’t have the money to retire, so they were considering selling the business. Bruce, James, John, and Jack McMillan, Lloyd’s son-in-law, teamed up with Robert Bender, the first non-family executive, to become “The Five.” They convinced the second-generation owners to sell them the company. Unfortunately, The Five lacked the capital to buy out their shares, so the family took Nordstrom public in June 1971. The company was renamed Nordstrom in 1973 and surpassed $100 million in sales that same year. So once again, Nordstrom’s leadership was in many hands. The Five ran the company in a decentralized method that often-confused outsiders (especially investment analysts) – but it worked. Nordstrom’s sales grew, and expansion began anew and continued through the decades. By 1990, they had 58 stores and $2.7 billion in sales. In 1991, The Five were ready to move on. The four Nordstroms became co-chairmen. The fourth-generation Nordstroms were seen to be too young and inexperienced to lead the company’s rapid growth. The Five instead named four friends and managers as co-presidents, keeping with the tradition of leadership by committee. But it didn’t work. Differences of opinion about how the company should be run meant the new co-presidents couldn’t work together, and Nordstrom experienced a record drop in profits in the first quarter of 1993. Two co-presidents were ditched, and the company continued with the other two, along with six members of the fourth generation serving as executives. In 1996, one of the presidents retired, leaving the other, John Whitacre, to lead as Nordstrom’s first-ever CEO. It was also the first time the company had been run by just one person (and a non-family member at that). Six Nordstrom family executives were named co-presidents, an arrangement that one industry consultant called “insane.” Whitacre nearly doubled the size of the Nordstrom chain, but then things started to go downhill. Criticisms over high costs, low productivity, some expensive investments in information technology, and finally, a rumor that Nordstrom was for sale, caused the stock price to lose half its value between January 1999 and the end of 2000. The board asked Whitacre to step down, and in 2000 he did. The board cast about looking for another outsider to run Nordstrom without success. Finally, Bruce Nordstrom (one of the then-retired chairmen) suggested bringing in fourth-generation Nordstroms to lead. The board did not want group leadership but agreed to put Bruce’s son Blake in charge, provided that Bruce would return as chairman. The deal was made. Blake’s brothers, Peter and Erik, both stayed on as executives. The return to family management was hugely successful – sales increased to $7.1 billion by 2004, expenses dropped, and gross profits reached a new high. Blake was the sole president but in practice ran many of his decisions by his brothers. He appointed Peter to head store merchandising, and Erik, to store operations. In 2015, Peter and Erik officially became co-presidents with Blake. In 2017, a group of Nordstrom family members, including Blake, Peter, Erik, and Bruce, signaled that they were interested in buying back Nordstrom and taking the company private again (the family group held about 31 percent of the company stock at the time). The Nordstroms argued that public scrutiny made it difficult to make large, but needed, investments to stay competitive in an increasingly online retail environment. If the company was private, they argued, they could take a longer view without the need to constantly produce short-term profits. The Nordstroms, in partnership with private equity firms, made an offer to the board of $8.4 billion, about $50 per share, in early 2018. The board rejected the offer, saying it was too low. The family was unwilling or unable to raise further capital, and so the negotiations ended shortly thereafter. There were some reports that the board considered appointing a non-family CEO after rejecting the privatization offer. Asked about this, Peter said: “What’s been made clear to us is this is not an entitlement program. It’s a public business and we need to perform and we need to be accountable.” Co-president Blake wrote an email to Nordstrom staff in December 2018, announcing that he had been diagnosed with lymphoma. He said that cancer could be treated and that he and his doctors were “optimistic and encouraged” by the prognosis. He said that he would continue working as he received chemotherapy. It came as a shock then, when just one month later, Blake died at the age of 58. Peter and Erik continued to run the company as co-presidents. They made all major decisions together and met on Monday mornings to discuss issues so that they could present a unified front to the executive team. A year later, in 2020, the leadership structure was changed – Erik became CEO while Peter remained president and became Chief Brand Officer. The Nordstrom family sometimes shies away from the spotlight, and so surely, we don’t know all of the drama that might happen when the curtains are closed. But from what we do know they are good to employees, always putting the customer first, and, of course, good to each other; working together, often by committee, to run the company. As we’ve seen, Nordstrom has been at the top of its game when members of the Nordstrom family have been calling the shots. And often with this family, it’s a team effort. Bruce Nordstrom once said the secret to Nordstrom’s success “was that family members running the company in each generation have shared a deep respect for one another and have always worked as hard as they could.” But Nordstrom now is a huge, complex business. As of May 2022, revenues totaled $15 billion and the company was ranked 245th in the Fortune 500. It is a long way from the small, single shoe store of the 1920s, which John Nordstrom’s sons took over when they were in their 20s, with little practical experience. Today the business requires leaders with education and a breadth of experience. It took the current leaders, Peter and Erik, about 20 years to get where they are in the company. And the two believe that it would take the fifth generation just as long to build up the know-how to run the company well. The problem is, there is just one Nordstrom family member from the fifth generation currently working in the family business: Blake’s daughter Alex, who started in the company in 2020 as an assistant buyer. She won’t be ready to captain a team for many years, and certainly not by the time Peter (aged 60 in 2022) and Erik (58) are ready to retire. So how the Nordstroms, who still own 30 percent of the company, navigate this next transition will be interesting to watch. They will have to depart from the unconventional, but largely successful, family management structures they have used in decades past. “We all inherently believe, whether our last name is Nordstrom or not, that two plus two equals something greater than four- i.e., that one person trying to run this business is not going to be successful, whatever the assignment is,” Blake Nordstrom said in the early 2000s. Peter and Erik are reconciled to the idea that it will be non-family “outsiders” running the business in the near future. There are up-and-coming executives in the company that may one day take the lead. One thing is certain: Nordstrom – the company and the family – will be a name to watch for years to come, as they chart a new course across this unrecognizable landscape. And for a family that has made their name synonymous with “nice,” it’s easy to root for them. Sarah Reid is a freelance writer based in Toronto. Download and view as a PDF here.

                "title": "Fresno State Bulldogs football - Wikipedia",
                "content": "The Fresno State Bulldogs football team represents California State University, Fresno in NCAA Division I FBS college football as a member of the Mountain West Conference. The green \"V\" on the Bulldogs' helmets, uniforms, and playing field symbolizes California's Central Valley, specifically the San Joaquin Valley, the agricultural valley from which they draw their support. Football was first played on the Fresno campus in 1921, and for its first year it played as an independent. The Bulldogs joined the California Coast Conference, which included several regional opponents the next year, and moved to the Northern California Athletic Conference of which it was among the charter schools in 1925. These early years laid the foundations of rivalries to come, with games against San Jose State and Pacific in the first year, and adding UC Davis, Nevada, and San Diego State in the following years of NCAC play. The NCAA began classifying schools into University Division and College Division groups in 1937, and the Bulldogs, along with the other major college schools in the conference, broke off into the California Collegiate Athletic Association in 1939, a conference it remained in until joining the Pacific Coast Athletic Association, later known as the Big West Conference, in 1969. Notable coaches during this period include Cecil Coleman, who during his five years at Fresno State had a .760 winning percentage. Coleman took the 1961 team to an undefeated season, capped by a 36–6 Mercy Bowl victory over Bowling Green State. Fresno State football experienced a stretch of seasons hovering around the .500 mark during the later 1960s and 70s. Yet despite also having a number of winning seasons, including two where the Bulldogs went undefeated, they only participated in two University Division bowl games before the 1980s. In 1976, Jim Sweeney took over a Bulldog squad that had had 8 winning seasons since its last bowl bid, and promptly took the 1977 squad to a 9–2 record in his second year as head coach. The Sweeney era bristled with confidence as the Bulldogs became, along with rival San Jose State, the class of the Big West, earning postseason bowl berths four times in the 1980s. Sweeney's 1985 squad is particularly memorable for Bulldog fans, as the team finished as the only unbeaten Division I-A team in the country, ranked 16th in the coaches poll. The 1985 squad did not, however, finish untied, after a 24–24 tie at home against the Rainbow clad Warriors of Hawaii. The lone blemish to a perfect season, coupled with the difficulty either team has had in winning in the other's home stadium, has led the Warriors and Bulldogs to contend for one of the WAC's fiercest rivalries. The face of Fresno State football changed with the construction of Bulldog Stadium for the 1980 season. Before then, the Bulldogs played their home games in Fresno City College's Ratcliffe Stadium, which seated approximately 13,000 fans. The construction of a modern new on-campus stadium which held over 30,000 in attendance was an outstanding improvement for the Bulldogs, who saw drastic increases in attendance and alumni support. The new stadium brought with it a renewed success for the football team, as they enjoyed four Big West championships in the new stadium which took them to five California Bowl appearances against opponents from the Mid-American Conference. During the Sweeney era, the Bulldogs posted nine consecutive winning seasons, a run which included five double-digit win seasons. 1994, however, marked the beginning of three consecutive losing seasons which ended the Sweeney era and brought in Pat Hill, who had worked both in the NFL and colleges for the past several decades—including a stint as an assistant under Sweeney from 1984 to 1989. Under Hill, Fresno State continued the advances it had made during the Sweeney era. Soon after returning to Fresno, Hill declared that his Bulldogs would play \"anybody, anywhere, anytime.\" He recalled that this was the same blueprint Bobby Bowden followed in turning Florida State into a powerhouse.[3] To that end, Hill's Bulldogs frequently played particularly difficult non-conference schedules against elite, highly ranked teams. The Bulldogs have also been the only BCS non-AQ conference school to record three consecutive bowl victories over schools from BCS conferences. In 1998, the Bulldogs, under Hill took on all comers and had a strong season led by WAC offensive player of the year Jaime Kimbrough. In 2001, the Bulldogs, and quarterback David Carr, began their season with several upsets of ranked teams. The Bulldogs opened the season in Boulder against the Colorado Buffaloes, leaving with a 24–22 win over the eventual Big 12 champions. The next game of the 2001 season was at home against the Oregon State Beavers, the team that Sports Illustrated had been picked as its preseason No. 1. In an electric game at Bulldog Stadium[citation needed], the Bulldogs outplayed the Beavers[citation needed] in a 44–24 rout. Fresno State then headed to Madison to take on the Wisconsin Badgers, winners of the Sun Bowl over UCLA the previous year. The Bulldogs also topped the Badgers by a score of 32–20. These victories, followed by wins over Tulsa, Louisiana Tech, and Colorado State led the Bulldogs to a ranking of No. 8 in the polls, the highest for a mid-major team since(BYU was ranked No. 5 in 1996), and earned the Bulldogs a degree of prestige not usually afforded a mid-major program. This changed abruptly, however, when the Boise State Broncos and Hawaii Rainbows upset the Bulldogs in Fresno and Honolulu respectively to smash the Bulldogs' hopes of playing in a BCS bowl. The defeats led the team instead the Silicon Valley Classic against Michigan State, a game which was taken by the Spartans by a score of 44–35. Nonetheless, the impressive performances of the regular season earned[citation needed] Fresno State its first number one overall NFL draft choice in David Carr, picked first by the expansion Houston Texans. The 2002 squad, which had difficulty opening the season with a 1–3 record, finished strong to finish the regular season 8–5 and earning another bid to the Silicon Valley Classic against Georgia Tech. This resulted in a win for the Bulldogs, who beat the Yellow Jackets 30–21. The 2003 squad earned a spot in the Silicon Valley Classic for the third year in a row, this time facing UCLA in San Jose. The Bulldogs defeated the Bruins 17–9. The 2004 season began for the Bulldogs much as the 2001 season had, with surprising upsets over BCS opponents in their home stadiums. The Bulldogs opened the season at Husky Stadium against Washington, a team with high expectations in its second year with head coach Keith Gilbertson. The Bulldogs came away with the win by a score of 35–16. The second game was against the Big 12 champions, the Kansas State Wildcats, who had beaten the No. 1 ranked Oklahoma Sooners to finish the previous year. The Bulldogs walked out of Manhattan with an unexpected 45–21 win, again earning the squad national attention and a ranking in the polls. Again, similarly to the 2001 season, the Bulldogs unexpectedly lost to Louisiana Tech, followed by two more losses, including to newly cemented rival Boise State. However, the Bulldogs found their redemptive qualities pervading in five straight wins by 40 or more points, including a 70–14 home rout over rival Hawaiʻi, to earn a bid to the MPC Computers Bowl. In the MPC Bowl, the Bulldogs won their third straight bowl victory against a BCS conference team, beating the Virginia Cavaliers 37–34 in overtime. The 2005 season began with heady expectations which the Bulldogs largely lived up to for much of the season. The 2005 squad, after an early 3-point loss to Oregon in Eugene, rallied to win seven straight, including the first win at Hawaiʻi since 1994, and a redemptive home victory over Boise State, traveled to the Los Angeles Coliseum to face the No. 1 ranked USC Trojans, bringing with them an 8–1 record, a ranking of No. 16, and senior leadership and depth at key positions. The match up against USC turned out to be one for the ages as Fresno State quarterback Paul Pinegar continually drew against USC quarterback Matt Leinart, and Fresno State running backs Wendel Mathis and Bryson Sumlin exchanged touchdown runs with eventual Heisman Trophy winner Reggie Bush. Despite taking a halftime lead and trading scores with the Trojans all night, at the end of regulation, USC's athleticism with Reggie Bush, the Bulldogs lost by a score of 42–50. The loss to the Trojans changed the character of the team, who proceeded to lose their next four games, including the Liberty Bowl against Tulsa. The 2006 squad, weakened by key senior losses at quarterback, running back and on the defense, struggled with the schedule, opening the year 1–7 before winning three straight, only to close the season with the first loss to San Jose State since before the fall of the Soviet Union. After a disappointing season in 2006, the 2007 Fresno State Bulldogs bounced back, finishing 9–4. They started strong against a weak Sacramento State team before losing a close game at Texas A&M in triple overtime. After another loss to Oregon, they won 8 of their final 10 games, including a victory over Georgia Tech in the Humanitarian Bowl. On September 1, 2008, the Bulldogs opened their season with a 24–7 victory over Rutgers in a non-conference game. The Bulldogs would end the season with a 7–6 record, including a loss in the New Mexico Bowl against Colorado State. The 2009 season begin with high hopes as Fresno State dominated its first opponent, UC Davis. However, the Bulldogs would go on to lose three straight games against Wisconsin, Boise State, and Cincinnati. The Bulldogs would rebound to win their next five games, before falling to rival Nevada. The Bulldogs would also go on to beat Illinois, in one of the more memorable college football games of the year. The Bulldogs scored a touchdown with only seconds left. Down by one point, the Bulldogs decided to go for two rather than kick a field goal to tie it up. With time expiring, Fresno State QB Ryan Colburn was forced to throw the ball into the end zone. The ball was deflected by an Illinois player, and caught by Fresno State offensive lineman Devan Cunningham who barreled his way into the end zone for a two-point conversion. The Bulldogs won 53–52. This miraculous play has been dubbed by many as the \"remarkable deflection\". The Bulldogs would end the season at 8–5 including a loss to Wyoming in the New Mexico Bowl. However, Ryan Mathews had one of his best seasons to date, rushing for 1,800 yards, and scoring 19 touchdowns. Ryan Mathews declared his eligibility for the NFL draft, and was selected 12th over-all by the San Diego Chargers. Much like the 2009 season, the 2010 season saw its share of highs and lows. The Bulldogs would start the season off with a victory over Cincinnati. However, they'd go on to lose against the upper half of the WAC conference and finish the regular season at 8–3. The Bulldogs accepted an invite to face Northern Illinois in the Humanitarian Bowl. It marked the third straight year that Fresno State would face a fellow non-AQ program in a bowl game. The Bulldogs would lose the game to Northern Illinois adding to its disappointing bowl record against other non-AQ programs. On December 5, 2011, after finishing the year 4–9, Fresno State announced that Pat Hill had been fired as the head coach of the football program. On December 14, 2011, Tim DeRuyter, defensive coordinator and interim head coach of Texas A&M was introduced as the new head coach. He led the Bulldogs to back-to-back conference championships in his first two years with Derek Carr playing as quarterback. DeRuyter was then given a five-year contract extension and Carr was drafted by the Oakland Raiders at 36th overall in 2014. With Carr gone, the Bulldogs would rotate through several quarterbacks and would finish with losing records the next two seasons. After opening the 2016 season with a 1–7 record, DeRuyter was fired.[4] The Bulldogs announced it had hired former Cal head coach, former quarterback under Coach Jim Sweeney, former Bulldogs offensive coordinator, and Fresno State alumnus Jeff Tedford to be its next head coach beginning with the 2017 season.[5] In his first season as Fresno State's head coach, Coach Tedford led the Bulldogs to a 10–4 season, including wins over rivals San Diego State and the No. 25 Boise State Broncos. They clinched the MW West Division, but would lose to Boise State 14–17 in the MW Championship game. Fresno State got an invite to participate in the 2017 Hawaii Bowl, to face the University of Houston Cougars. The Bulldogs would win their bowl game with a score of 33–27, ending a six-year bowl drought. Fresno State would the end the season at 10–4, making it one of the best turnarounds in college football. In 2018, Fresno State made back-to-back conference championship appearances, facing Boise State in a rematch of the previous championship game; this time defeating Boise State 19–16 in overtime. They faced the Arizona State Sun Devils in the 2018 Las Vegas Bowl, winning 20–31. Their victory over Arizona State gave Fresno State the first 12-win season in school history. The team suffered a setback in 2019, finishing 4–8 overall and 2–6 in conference play. On December 6, 2019, Tedford announced his resignation from Fresno State after 3 seasons for health reasons.[6] On December 17, 2019, former Fresno State offensive coordinator Kalen DeBoer, who had spent the 2019 season at Indiana, was hired as Tedford's replacement.[7] On September 18, 2021, the Bulldogs beat #13 UCLA Bruins 40–37. It is the second highest ranked opponent ever defeated by Fresno State. [8] On November 29, 2021, DeBoer left Fresno after 2 seasons for the head coaching job at Washington.[9] Tedford was rehired on December 8, 2021 for the 2022 season. Under Tedford, the Bulldogs won another Mountain West championship and beat Washington State in the Jimmy Kimmel LA Bowl.[10] The Bulldogs' 2023 home opener against Eastern Washington was historically significant as the first FBS game with linear television coverage exclusively in Spanish, with UniMás televising the game in the Fresno and Bakersfield markets. English-language coverage was exclusively by streaming, with audio being a simulcast of Fresno State's (English) radio broadcast.[11] On July 15, 2024, Tedford resigned as head coach once again, citing health reasons. Assistant head coach and linebackers coach Tim Skipper stepped in as interim head coach for the 2024 season. Skipper had previously served as the acting head coach while Tedford was away for the 2023 Isleta New Mexico Bowl. He also played his collegiate career at Fresno State, a four-year starter at middle linebacker from 1997 to 2000.[12] Fresno State started off its 2024 campaign against the defending national champion Michigan Wolverines at Michigan Stadium, losing 30-10. [13]The Bulldogs finished the season 6-6. On December 4, 2024, Fresno State announced the hiring of former North Dakota State Bison football coach Matt Entz.[14] Fresno State has won 29 conference championships through the 2022 season. † Co-champions † Co-champion † Interim The Battle of the Milk Can The Boise State-Fresno State rivalry originated in 1977. The Milk Can is awarded to each season's winner of the Battle of the Milk Can, a college football game between the Fresno State Bulldogs and the Boise State Broncos. The team who wins the Milk Can gets to keep it for a year. The trophy was created in 2005, but was not ready in time for the annual match in Fresno, which was won by the Bulldogs. It made its first appearance in 2006, when the victorious Broncos carried it off the field. The idea for a trophy as the prize for the newly arranged interstate rivalry was hatched by two separate dairy groups that decided to get involved with their local football programs. California (No. 1) and Idaho (No. 4) are two of the nation's leading dairy producers.[15] The South Valley Dairy Group began raising money for Bulldog football in 2001; the Bronco Dairy Boosters began contributing to Boise State in 2005. Two dairymen and friends in these organizations, Dan Van Grouw of Meridian, Idaho (in the Boise metropolitan area) and Roger Fluegel of Visalia, California (in Fresno State's home of the San Joaquin Valley), put forward the idea of a traveling trophy and began the administrative process. There was positive feedback from the teams, coaches, and fans, but an \"administrative changeover\" kept the trophy off the field for the 2005 game, though the Bulldogs' 27–7 victory is the first listed on the can. The rivalry with Hawaii has increased greatly in recent years, with both teams being the oldest members of the WAC contending regularly for the conference championship. Coaches from both schools have accused each side of various episodes of poor sportsmanship over the years, and both schools have some of the nation's rowdiest home fans. The rivalry has featured some lopsided results, including a 70–14 Fresno victory over Hawaii in 2004 and a 68–37 Warriors victory in 2006 over Fresno. In 2007, allegations that Fresno State fans were physically and verbally abused by hometown Hawaii fans circulated the internet and television media added to this rivalry. The game is no longer an annual affair; the two teams are no longer designated as annual opponents in the MW's post-2022 divisionless scheduling model. The Battle for the Oil Can The Fresno State-San Diego State rivalry, also known as the Battle for the Oil Can, is one of the Bulldogs' biggest rivalry games. This in-state rivalry dates back to 1923, with the Aztecs winning the initial meeting at home 12–2. Since then, the sides have met 51 more times, including every year from 1945 to 1979, when the two competed in the same conference or were independents. After not facing one another between 1979 and 1991, the schools resumed the annual series from 1992 to 1998, when both were members of the Western Athletic Conference. The two teams have met twice since then, in 2002 and 2011. With Fresno State joining the Mountain West Conference in 2012 and the addition of the divisional format, the Aztecs and the Bulldogs will compete on an annual basis once again. The two teams play for the Old Oil Can as a trophy. The name comes from a 1930s-era oil can hailing from Fresno that was found at a construction site at San Diego State. \"The oil can likely came from a time when Aztec and Bulldog fans traveled to football games between the two schools via the old, twisting, precipitous Grapevine section of Highway 99 over Tejon Pass\", said Jacquelyn K. Glasener, executive director of the Fresno State Alumni Association. \"Cars in those days carried extra oil and water to be sure they could make it through difficult trips\", added Jim Herrick, executive director of the San Diego State Alumni Association. As of 2023, Fresno State trails in the series 27–31–4.[citation needed][when?] The Battle for the Valley Trophy The Fresno State–San Jose State football rivalry started in 1921 and is the Bulldogs' oldest rival. San Jose State led the series from 1949 to 2001, but Fresno State tied it at 32 games each with a victory in 2002, and recaptured the lead in 2003. The Bulldogs have maintained the series lead since 2003, but have lost the past two games to the Spartans, including a 52–62 loss at Spartan Stadium (now CEFCU Stadium) on 11/29/2013. The Bulldogs and Spartans played the first football game of the series in 1921. The football rivalry took a one-year break in 2012 after conference realignment temporarily separated the two schools, with Fresno State moving to the Mountain West Conference while San Jose State remained in the Western Athletic Conference. It resumed as a conference rivalry in 2013 when San Jose State joined the MW, and the Spartans were designated as one of the Bulldogs' two permanent opponents in the MW's post-2022 divisionless scheduling model. As of 2023 Fresno State leads the 86 game series 44-39-3 The Sierra Showdown The 'Sierra Showdown' is named after the Sierra Nevada mountain range that runs along the California-Nevada border and is near the home cities of both schools (Fresno, California and Reno, Nevada). As recent as November 2022 there was case made for the Nevada-Fresno State football game to add a Sierra Showdown Trophy [16] Paul Loeffler, the voice of the Fresno State Bulldogs, suggested on Twitter that Nevada and Fresno State should play for the Sierra Showdown Trophy that is half silver (for the Silver State) and half gold (for the Golden State). Loeffler was quoted as saying \"\"You guys are on the eastern side of the Sierra. You're looking at the other side of the mountains that we're looking at from the western side. We have to go through or over that pass to play each other. We've been doing it forever. So why not make that mountain the symbol of this rivalry?\" The Wolf Pack and Bulldogs have played each other 55 times. The series began in 1923 and has been played every season since 1998. The 55 matchups are more games than Nevada has played its main rival, UNLV (49 times). Nevada is the other of Fresno State's two protected rivalries in the MW's post-2022 divisionless scheduling model, meaning they continue to play every year. Fresno State leads the all-time series 32-22-1 as of 2023, including a 16–11 mark since the teams began playing regularly again in 1994. Battle for the Victory Bell From 1956 to 1975, Cal Poly and the Bulldogs traded the \"Victory Bell Trophy\", which was donated to Cal Poly in 1952.[17] The trophy, which weighed about 200 pounds,[18] was ultimately retired due to repeated theft.[19] The two programs didn't play each other from 1986 through 2009, but brought back matchups in 2010,[20] 2013,[21] 2021[22] and 2022.[23] In the 46-game all-time series, Fresno State leads 34-10-2. Battle for the Bone From 2001 to 2011, Louisiana Tech and Fresno State played annually as members of the Western Athletic Conference.[24] The two schools both feature Bulldogs as their mascots, hence the name \"Battle for the Bone\" was coined by Fresno State's 2001 Homecoming Chair, Terrance Mayes.[25] In 2012 Fresno State left the Western Athletic Conference and joined the Mountain West Conference, effectively ending the rivalry.[26] In the 13-game all-time series, Fresno State leads 9-4.[27] Sam Baugh Trophy This honor is given by the Touchdown Club of Columbus, awarded annually to the nation's top collegiate passer. Paul Warfield Trophy This honor is awarded annually to the nation's top collegiate wide receiver.
