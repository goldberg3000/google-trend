                "content": "LeBron Raymone James Sr. (/ləˈbrɒn/;[1] lə-BRON; born December 30, 1984) is an American professional basketball player for the Los Angeles Lakers of the National Basketball Association (NBA). Nicknamed “King James,” he is widely regarded as one of the greatest players in basketball history and is frequently compared to Michael Jordan in debates about the sport’s all-time best.[a] James has won four NBA championships from 10 NBA Finals appearances, having made eight consecutive appearances between 2011 and 2018.[2] He also won the inaugural NBA Cup in 2023 with the Lakers, three Olympic gold medals as a member of the U.S. national team, and the Olympics MVP in the 2024 Summer Olympics. In addition to being the NBA's all-time leading scorer and ranking fourth in NBA career assists and eighth in NBA career steals, James holds several individual honors: four NBA Most Valuable Player (MVP) Awards, four NBA Finals MVP Awards, the NBA Rookie of the Year Award, three NBA All-Star Game MVP Awards, and the inaugural NBA Cup MVP award. He has been named an NBA All-Star a record 20 times, selected to the All-NBA Team a record 20 times (including a record 13 First Team selections)[3][4] and the All-Defensive Team six times (including five First Team selections), and was a runner-up for the NBA Defensive Player of the Year Award twice in his career.[5][6] The oldest active player in the NBA, he is tied with Vince Carter for the record for the most seasons played in NBA history, with 22, and holds the record for the most minutes played in NBA history. [7] James grew up playing basketball for St. Vincent–St. Mary High School in his hometown of Akron, Ohio. He was heavily touted by the national media as a future NBA superstar for his all-around scoring, passing, athleticism and playmaking abilities.[8] A prep-to-pro, James was selected by the Cleveland Cavaliers with the first overall pick of the 2003 NBA draft. Named the 2004 NBA Rookie of the Year,[9] he soon established himself as one of the league's premier players, leading the Cavaliers to their first NBA Finals appearance in 2007 and winning the NBA MVP award in 2009 and 2010.[5] James left in 2010 as a free agent to join the Miami Heat;[10] this was announced in a nationally televised special titled The Decision and is among the most controversial free agency moves in sports history. James won his first two NBA championships while playing for the Heat in 2012 and 2013; in both of these years, he additionally earned the league's MVP and Finals MVP awards. After his fourth season with the Heat in 2014, James opted out of his contract and returned to the Cavaliers. In 2016, he led the Cavaliers to victory over the Golden State Warriors in the Finals by coming back from a 3–1 deficit, delivering the team's first championship and ending the Cleveland sports curse and won his third Finals MVP.[11] In 2018, James exercised his contract option to leave the Cavaliers and signed with the Lakers, where he won the 2020 NBA championship and his fourth Finals MVP.[12] On February 7, 2023, James surpassed Kareem Abdul-Jabbar to become the leading scorer in league history, and the following year, he became part of the first father-son teammate duo in NBA history, playing alongside his son Bronny with the Lakers. Off the court, James has earned further wealth and fame from numerous endorsement contracts. He is the first player in NBA history to accumulate $1 billion in earnings as an active player.[13] James has been featured in books, documentaries (including winning three Sports Emmy Awards as an executive producer), and television commercials. He was among Time's 100 most influential people in the world in 2005, 2013, 2017, and 2019 – the most selections for a professional athlete. James has won 20 ESPY Awards, hosted Saturday Night Live, and starred in the sports film Space Jam: A New Legacy (2021). He has been a part-owner of Liverpool F.C. since 2011 and leads the LeBron James Family Foundation, which has opened an elementary school, housing complex, retail plaza, and medical center in Akron, Ohio.[14][15] James was born on December 30, 1984, in Akron, Ohio, to Gloria Marie James, who was only 16 at the time of his birth.[16]: 22 His father, Anthony McClelland, has an extensive criminal record and was not involved in his life.[17][18][19] When James was growing up, life was often a struggle for the family, as they moved from apartment to apartment in the seedier neighborhoods of Akron while Gloria struggled to find steady work.[20] Realizing that her son would be better off in a more stable family environment, Gloria allowed him to move in with the family of Frank Walker, a local youth football coach who introduced James to basketball when he was nine years old.[16]: 23 James began playing organized basketball in the fifth grade.[21] He later played Amateur Athletic Union (AAU) basketball for the Northeast Ohio Shooting Stars.[20] The team enjoyed success on a local and national level, led by James and his friends Sian Cotton, Dru Joyce III, and Willie McGee.[16]: 24 The group dubbed themselves the \"Fab Four\" and promised each other that they would attend high school together.[16]: 27 In a move that stirred local controversy, they chose to attend St. Vincent–St. Mary High School, a private Catholic school with predominantly white students.[22] As a 6-foot-2-inch (1.88 m) tall freshman, James averaged 18 points and 6.2 rebounds per game for the St. Vincent–St. Mary varsity basketball team.[23] The Fighting Irish went 27–0 en route to the Division III state title, making them the only boys high school team in Ohio to finish the season undefeated.[24] As a sophomore, James averaged 25.3 points and 7.4 rebounds, along with 5.5 assists and 3.7 steals per game.[25] For some home games during the season, St. Vincent–St. Mary played at the University of Akron's 5,492-seat Rhodes Arena to satisfy ticket demand from alumni, fans, as well as college and NBA scouts who wanted to see James play.[26] The Fighting Irish finished the season 26–1 and repeated as state champions.[23] For his outstanding play, James was named Ohio Mr. Basketball and selected to the USA Today All-USA First Team, becoming the first sophomore to do either.[23] In 2001, during the summer before his junior year, James was the subject of a feature article in Slam magazine in which writer Ryan Jones lauded the 16-year-old James, who had grown to 6 feet 7 inches (2.01 m), as \"[possibly] the best high school basketball player in America right now\".[27] During the season, James also appeared on the cover of Sports Illustrated, becoming the first high school basketball underclassman to do so.[16]: 104 With averages of 28 points, 8.9 rebounds, 6 assists, and 3 steals per game, he was again named Ohio Mr. Basketball and selected to the USA Today All-USA First Team,[23] and became the first junior to be named male basketball Gatorade National Player of the Year.[16]: 117 St. Vincent–St. Mary finished the year with a 23–4 record, ending their season with a loss in the Division II championship game.[16]: 114 Following the loss, James unsuccessfully petitioned for a change to the NBA's draft eligibility rules in an attempt to enter the 2002 NBA draft.[28][29] During this time, he used marijuana, which he said was to help cope with the stress that resulted from the constant media attention he was receiving.[30] Throughout his senior year, James and the Fighting Irish traveled across the country to play a number of nationally ranked teams, including a game on December 12, 2002, against Oak Hill Academy that was nationally televised on ESPN2.[16]: 142 Time Warner Cable, looking to capitalize on James's popularity, offered St. Vincent–St. Mary's games to Ohio-based subscribers for $7.95 per game on a pay-per-view basis throughout the season, but ended up not being profitable.[16]: 143 [31] For the year, James averaged 30.4 points, 9.7 rebounds, 4.9 assists, and 2.9 steals per game,[23] was named Ohio Mr. Basketball and selected to the USA Today All-USA First Team for an unprecedented third consecutive year,[16]: 178 and was named Gatorade National Player of the Year for the second consecutive year.[23] He participated in three year-end high school basketball all-star games—the EA Sports Roundball Classic, the Jordan Brand Capital Classic, and the McDonald's All-American Game—losing his National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) eligibility and making it official that he would enter the 2003 NBA draft.[32] Also during his senior year, James was the centerpiece of several controversies. For his 18th birthday, James skirted state amateur bylaws by accepting a Hummer H2 as a gift from his mother, who had secured a loan for the vehicle by utilizing James's future earning power as an NBA player.[33] This prompted an investigation by the Ohio High School Athletic Association (OHSAA) because its guidelines stated that no amateur may accept any gift valued over $100 as a reward for athletic performance. James was cleared of any wrongdoing because he had accepted the luxury vehicle from a family member and not from an agent or any outside source.[32] Later in the season, James accepted two throwback jerseys worth $845 from an urban clothing store in exchange for posing for pictures, officially violating OHSAA rules and resulting in his being stripped of his high school sports eligibility.[32] James appealed the ruling and his penalty was eventually dropped to a two-game suspension, allowing him to play the remainder of the year. The Irish were also forced to forfeit one of their wins, their only official loss that season.[34] In his first game back after the suspension, James scored a career-high 52 points.[35] St. Vincent–St. Mary went on to win the Division II championship, marking their third division title in four years.[36] As an underclassman, James played wide receiver for St. Vincent–St. Mary's football team.[16]: 51 He was recruited by some Division I programs, including Notre Dame.[37] At the end of his second year, James was named first team all-state, and as a junior, he helped lead the Fighting Irish to the state semifinals.[25] James did not play during his senior year because of a wrist injury that he sustained in an AAU basketball game.[38] Some sports analysts, football critics, high school coaches, as well as former and current professional players have speculated that James could have played in the National Football League (NFL).[b] James was selected by his hometown team, the Cleveland Cavaliers, as the first overall pick of the 2003 NBA draft.[43] In his first regular season game, James scored 25 points in a 106–92 loss to the Sacramento Kings, setting an NBA record for the most points scored by a prep-to-pro player in his debut performance.[44] At the conclusion of the 2003–2004 season, James became the first Cavalier to receive the NBA Rookie of the Year Award.[9] With final averages of 20.9 points, 5.5 rebounds, and 5.9 assists per game,[45] he also became the third player in league history to average at least 20 points, five rebounds, and five assists per game as a rookie.[46] Cleveland ultimately finished the season 35–47, failing to make the playoffs despite an 18-game improvement over the previous year.[47] In the 2004–2005 season, James earned his first NBA All-Star Game selection, contributing 13 points, 8 rebounds, and 6 assists in a winning effort for the Eastern Conference.[48] Around the league, teams took note of his rapid development, and Denver Nuggets coach George Karl told Sports Illustrated: \"It's weird talking about a 20-year-old kid being a great player, but he is a great player ... He's the exception to almost every rule.\"[49] On March 20, James scored 56 points against the Toronto Raptors, setting Cleveland's new single-game points record.[50] With final averages of 27.2 points, 7.4 rebounds, 7.2 assists, and 2.2 steals per game, he was named to his first All-NBA Team.[25] Despite a 30–20 record to start the year,[50] the Cavaliers again failed to make the playoffs, finishing the season 42–40.[51] At the 2006 All-Star Game, James led the East to victory with 29 points and was named the NBA All-Star Game Most Valuable Player.[52] Behind final season averages of 31.4 points, 7.0 rebounds, and 6.6 assists per game,[5] he also finished second in overall NBA Most Valuable Player Award voting to Steve Nash.[53] Under James' leadership, the Cavaliers qualified for the playoffs for the first time since 1998.[54] In his postseason debut, James recorded a triple-double in a winning effort over the Washington Wizards.[55] In Game 3 of the series, he made the first game-winning shot of his career, and made another in Game 5.[56] Cleveland would go on to defeat the Wizards before being ousted by the Detroit Pistons in the second round.[57] In the 2006–2007 season, James finished the regular season averaging 27.3 points, 6.7 rebounds, 6.0 assists, and 1.6 steals per game.[25] With a starting five featuring James, Larry Hughes, Drew Gooden, Aleksandar Pavlović, and Zydrunas Ilgauskas, the Cavaliers finished the season with 50 wins for the second consecutive year and entered the playoffs as the #2-seed in the Eastern Conference.[60] In the first two rounds of the playoffs, LeBron led the team to wins over the Washington Wizards and New Jersey Nets. The Cavaliers then faced the Detroit Pistons in the Eastern Conference Finals. In Game 5 of the Eastern Conference Finals, he logged 48 points with nine rebounds and seven assists. His performance is considered one of the greatest playoff performances of all time as he scored 29 of Cleveland's last 30 points, including 25 straight, and the game-winning layup with two seconds left. The Cavaliers won 109–107 double-overtime victory over the Detroit Pistons.[61] After the game, play-by-play announcer Marv Albert called the performance \"one of the greatest moments in postseason history\" and color commentator Steve Kerr described it as \"Jordan-esque\".[62] In 2012, ESPN ranked the performance the fourth greatest in modern NBA playoff history.[63] The Cavaliers went on to win Game 6 and claim their first-ever Eastern Conference championship, earning them a matchup with the San Antonio Spurs in the Finals.[64] The Spurs at the time were coached by Gregg Popovich and featured a prime Tim Duncan, Tony Parker, Manu Ginóbili, and Bruce Bowen. With no other significant scoring threats, the Spurs built its defense around stopping James from getting into the paint. As James did not have a reliable jump shot yet nor another offensive weapon on his team, he struggled against the Spurs' zone defense.[65] He averaged 22 points, 7.0 rebounds, and 6.8 assists per game on just 35.6 percent shooting,[66] as Cleveland was eliminated in a four-game sweep.[67] In February of the 2007–2008 season, James was named All-Star Game MVP for the second time behind a 27-point, eight-rebound, and nine-assist performance.[68] On March 21, he moved past Brad Daugherty as the Cavaliers' all-time leading scorer in a game against the Toronto Raptors, doing so in over 100 fewer games than Daugherty.[69] James' 30 points per game were also the highest in the league, marking his first scoring title.[70] Despite his individual accomplishments, Cleveland's record fell from the year before to 45–37.[71] Seeded fourth in the East entering the playoffs, the Cavaliers defeated the Wizards in the first round for the third consecutive season before being eliminated in seven games by the eventual-champion Boston Celtics in the next round.[72] During the decisive seventh game in Boston, James scored 45 points and Paul Pierce scored 41 in a game the Associated Press described as a \"shootout\".[73] At the end of the 2008–2009 season, James finished second in NBA Defensive Player of the Year Award voting and made his first NBA All-Defensive Team,[74] posting 23 chase-down blocks and a career-high 93 total blocks.[75] James also became only the fourth postmerger player to lead his team in points, rebounds, assists, steals, and blocks in a single season.[76] Behind his play and the acquisition of All-Star guard Mo Williams, Cleveland went a franchise record 66–16 and fell just one game short of matching the best home record in league history.[77] With final averages of 28.4 points, 7.6 rebounds, 7.2 assists, 1.7 steals, and 1.2 blocks per game, James became the first Cavalier to win the MVP Award.[78] Reflecting on James' performance for ESPN, John Hollinger later wrote: \"He's having what is arguably the greatest individual season in history, and it's time we gave him his due for it.\"[79] In the playoffs, Cleveland swept the Detroit Pistons and the Atlanta Hawks to earn a matchup with the Orlando Magic in the Eastern Conference Finals.[80] In Game 1 of the series, James scored 49 points on 66 percent shooting in a losing effort for the Cavaliers.[63] In Game 2, he hit a game-winner to tie the series at 1–1.[81] Cleveland would lose the series in six games, and following the loss in Game 6, James immediately left the floor without shaking hands with his opponents, which was an act that many media members viewed as unsportsmanlike.[82][83] For the series, James averaged 38.5 points, 8.3 rebounds, and 8.0 assists per game,[84] finishing the postseason with a career playoff-high 35.3 points per game.[5] In February of the 2009–10 season, James was forced into a temporary point guard role following a series of injuries to players in the Cavaliers' backcourt.[85] Behind his leadership, Cleveland lost no momentum, finishing the year with the best record in the league for the second consecutive season.[86] Despite only playing 39 minutes per game, James increased his statistical production, averaging 29.7 points, 7.3 rebounds, 8.6 assists, 1.6 steals, and 1.0 block per game on 50 percent shooting en route to another MVP Award.[87] To open the playoffs, Cleveland advanced past the Chicago Bulls to earn a matchup with the Boston Celtics in the second round.[88] James was heavily criticized for not playing well in Game 5 of the series, shooting only 20 percent on 14 shots and scoring 15 points.[89] The team suffered its worst loss in franchise history, and at the conclusion of the game, James walked off the court to a smattering of boos from Cleveland's home crowd.[90] The Cavaliers were officially eliminated from the postseason in Game 6, with James posting 27 points, 19 rebounds, and 10 assists in the losing effort.[88] James became an unrestricted free agent at 12:01 a.m. EDT on July 1, 2010.[92] During this time, he was contacted by several teams, including the Bulls, Los Angeles Clippers, Miami Heat, New York Knicks, New Jersey Nets, and Cavaliers.[93] On July 8, James announced on a live ESPN special titled The Decision that he would sign with the Heat.[94] The telecast was broadcast from the Boys & Girls Club of Greenwich, Connecticut and raised $2.5 million for the charity. An additional $3.5 million was raised from advertising revenue, which was donated to other charities.[95] The day before the special, fellow free agents Chris Bosh and Dwyane Wade also announced that they would sign with Miami;[96] reports later arose that back in 2006 the trio had discussed among themselves their upcoming 2010 free agencies.[97] James decided to join with Bosh and Wade in part so that he could shoulder less of the offensive load; James thought that his improved teammates would give him a better chance of winning an NBA championship than had he stayed in Cleveland.[98] Heat president Pat Riley played a major role in selling James on the idea of playing with Bosh and Wade.[99] James would be relieved of the burden of scoring, and he thought he could be the first player since Oscar Robertson to average a triple-double in a season.[98] Upon leaving the Cavaliers, James drew intense criticism from sports analysts, executives, fans, and current and former players. The Decision itself was also scrutinized and viewed as unnecessary. Many thought that the prolonged wait for James' choice was unprofessional as not even the teams courting him were aware of his decision until moments before the show.[100] Upon learning that James would not be returning to Cleveland, Cavaliers owner Dan Gilbert published an open letter to fans in which he aggressively denounced James' actions.[101] Some angry fans of the team recorded videos of themselves burning his jersey.[102] Former NBA players, including Michael Jordan and Magic Johnson, were also critical of James, condemning him for forming a superteam with Bosh and Wade in Miami and not trying to win a championship in Cleveland, though Jordan did acknowledge that the options players had at the time were much more expansive than those he and others had in the 1980s and 1990s.[103][104][105] Some commentators did defend James' decision to join the Miami Heat by noting the Cavaliers' inability to build a strong supporting cast around him. They argued that other NBA greats had benefitted from talented teammates: Magic Johnson had Kareem Abdul-Jabbar and James Worthy, Larry Bird had Kevin McHale (basketball) and Robert Parish on the Celtics, and Michael Jordan had Scottie Pippen with the Bulls.[106] James drew further criticism in a September interview with CNN when he claimed that race might have been a factor in the fallout from The Decision.[107][108] As a result of his actions during the 2010 free agency period, James quickly gained a reputation as one of America's most disliked athletes, which marked a radical change from prior years.[109][110] The phrase \"taking my talents to South Beach\" became a punch line for critics.[111][112] In retrospect, James has expressed some regret over his handling of The Decision.[110][113][114] James officially signed a 6-year, $110 million contract with the Heat on July 10, 2010, through a sign-and-trade deal which sent two second- and two first-round draft picks to the Cavaliers and gave the team the option to swap first round picks with the Heat in 2012.[115][116] As part of the first player-created NBA superteam[117] he became only the third reigning MVP to change teams and the first since Moses Malone in 1982.[118] That evening, the Heat threw a welcome party for their new \"Big Three\" at the American Airlines Arena, an event that took on a rock concert atmosphere.[119] During the gathering, James predicted a dynasty for the Heat and alluded to multiple championships.[120][121] Outside of Miami, the spectacle was not well-received, furthering the negative public perception of James.[122] Throughout the 2010–11 season, the media and opposing fanbases treated James and the Heat as villains.[123] To begin the year, they struggled to adjust to these new circumstances, going only 9–8 after 17 games.[124] James later admitted that the constant negativity surrounding the team made him play with an angrier demeanor than in years past.[123] On December 2, James faced the Cleveland Cavaliers in Cleveland for the first time since departing as a free agent.[125] He scored 38 points and led Miami to a victory while being booed every time he touched the ball.[126] The Heat eventually turned their season around and finished as the East's second seed,[127] with James averaging 26.7 points, 7.5 rebounds, and 7.0 assists per game on 51 percent shooting.[5] In the Eastern Conference Semifinals, James and his teammates found themselves matched up with the Boston Celtics for the second consecutive year.[128] In Game 5, he scored Miami's last 10 points to help seal a series-clinching win.[129] After the final buzzer, James famously knelt on the court in an emotional moment, later telling reporters that it was an extremely personal victory for him and the team.[130] The Heat eventually advanced to the Finals, where they lost to the Dallas Mavericks in six games.[128] James received the brunt of the criticism for the loss, averaging only three points in fourth quarters in the series and scored just eight points in Game 4, a game Miami lost by just three points.[131] His Finals scoring average of 17.8 points per game signified an 8.9-point drop from the regular season, the largest point drop-off in league history.[132] The 2011–2012 season was delayed by a lockout, and during that extended summer, James worked with Hakeem Olajuwon in order to improve his post up game.[133][124][134] Humbled by the Heat's loss to the Mavericks, the experience inspired James to leave behind the villain role that he had been embracing, which helped James regain a sense of joy on the court.[123] Behind his expanded skillset,[134] Miami began the year with a franchise-best 18–6 record.[135] James was eventually named MVP for the third time, finishing with averages of 27.1 points, 7.9 rebounds, 6.2 assists, and 1.9 steals per game on 53 percent shooting.[136] In the second round of the playoffs, Miami temporarily lost Bosh to an abdominal injury and found themselves trailing the Indiana Pacers 2–1.[138] James responded with a 40-point, 18-rebound, and nine-assist outing in Game 4 to help even the series.[139] To compensate for Bosh's absence, the Heat embraced a small-ball lineup with James at power forward, which they retained even after Bosh's return in the conference finals against the Boston Celtics.[140][141] Facing elimination in Game 6, James recorded 45 points and 15 rebounds to lead the Heat to victory in what The New York Times called a \"career-defining performance\".[142] Miami won Game 7 to advance to the Finals, earning them a matchup with the Oklahoma City Thunder and James' budding rival Kevin Durant.[143] Late in Game 4 of the series, James hit a three-pointer to give the Heat a lead, helping them win the game despite missing time with leg cramps.[144] In Game 5, he registered a triple-double as Miami defeated Oklahoma City for their second-ever championship and James' first championship.[145] James was unanimously voted the Bill Russell NBA Finals Most Valuable Player with averages of 28.6 points, 10.2 rebounds, and 7.4 assists per game.[146] His full postseason run, in which James averaged 30.3 points, 9.7 rebounds, and 5.6 assists per game, was later ranked the second best in modern NBA history by ESPN.[147] In February of the 2012–13 season, James averaged 29.7 points and 7.8 assists per game while setting multiple shooting efficiency records.[148][149] That same month, the Heat also began a 27-game winning streak, which is the third longest in NBA history.[150] Based on these accomplishments, James' performance was described as a \"month for the ages\" by Sports Illustrated.[151] Miami eventually finished the year with a franchise and league best 66–16 record,[152] and James was named MVP for the fourth time, falling just one vote shy of becoming the first player in NBA history to win the award unanimously.[153] His final season averages were 26.8 points, 8.0 rebounds, 7.3 assists, and 1.7 steals per game on 56.5 percent shooting.[5] In Game 1 of the Eastern Conference Finals, James scored a buzzer-beating layup to give Miami a one-point victory against the Pacers.[154] Throughout the series, his supporting cast struggled significantly, and his added scoring load prompted James to compare his responsibilities to those of his \"Cleveland days\".[155] Despite these struggles, the Heat advanced to the Finals for a meeting with the San Antonio Spurs,[156] signifying a rematch for James from his first Finals six years earlier.[157] At the beginning of the series, he was criticized for his lack of aggressiveness and poor shot selection as Miami fell behind 2–3.[84][156][158] In Game 6, James recorded his second triple-double of the series, including 16 fourth quarter points, to lead the Heat to a comeback victory.[159] In Game 7, he tied the Finals record for most points scored in a Game 7 victory, leading Miami over San Antonio with 37 points.[160] James was named Finals MVP for the second straight season, averaging 25.3 points, 10.9 rebounds, 7.0 assists, and 2.3 steals per game for the championship round.[161] On March 3 of the 2013–14 season, James scored a career-high and franchise-record 61 points in a game against the Charlotte Bobcats.[162] He converted on his first eight three-point field goal attempts through three quarters, setting a new record for the most three-point field goals made in a 60-point game. James also set the record for most points in a single game while wearing a mask. Throughout the year, he was one of the few staples for a Heat roster that used 20 different starting lineups due to injuries,[163] finishing with averages of 27.1 points, 6.9 rebounds, and 6.4 assists per game on 56.7 percent shooting.[5] In the second round of the playoffs, James tied a career postseason-high by scoring 49 points in Game 4 against the Brooklyn Nets.[164] In the next round, Miami defeated the Pacers to earn their fourth consecutive Finals berth, becoming one of only four teams in NBA history to do so.[165] In Game 1 of the NBA Finals, James missed most of the fourth quarter because of leg cramps, helping the San Antonio Spurs take an early series lead.[166] In Game 2, he led the Heat to a series-tying victory with 35 points on a 64 percent shooting rate.[167] San Antonio eventually eliminated the Heat in five games, ending Miami's quest for a three-peat.[168] For the Finals, James averaged 28.2 points, 7.8 rebounds, and 2.0 steals per game.[169] On June 25, 2014, James opted out of his contract with the Heat, and on July 1, he officially became an unrestricted free agent.[170] On July 11, James revealed via a first-person essay in Sports Illustrated that he intended to return to the Cavaliers.[171] In contrast to The Decision, his announcement to return to Cleveland was well received.[172][173][174] The next day, James officially signed with the team,[175] who had compiled a league-worst 97–215 record in the four seasons following his departure.[176] A month after James' signing, the Cavaliers acquired Kevin Love from the Minnesota Timberwolves, forming a new star trio along with Kyrie Irving.[177] In January of the 2014–2015 season, James missed two weeks due to left knee and lower back strains, which at the time represented the longest stretch of missed games in his career.[180] In total, James played a then career-low 69 games and his final averages were 25.3 points, 6.0 rebounds, and 7.4 assists per game.[5] In the second round of the playoffs, he hit a baseline jumper at the buzzer to give Cleveland a 2–2 series tie with the Chicago Bulls.[181] In the Eastern Conference Finals, the Cavaliers defeated the Atlanta Hawks to advance to the NBA Finals, making James the first player since the 1960s to play in five consecutive Finals.[182] For most of the Finals against the Golden State Warriors, Irving and Love were sidelined due to injury, giving James more offensive responsibilities.[182] Behind his leadership, the Cavaliers opened the series with a 2–1 lead before losing in six games.[183] Despite the loss, he received serious consideration for the Finals MVP Award,[184] averaging 35.8 points, 13.3 rebounds, and 8.8 assists per game.[183] During the 2015–16 season, James was criticized for his role in several off-court controversies, including the midseason firing of Cavaliers' coach David Blatt.[185][186] Despite these distractions, Cleveland finished the year with 57 wins and the best record in the East.[187] James' final averages were 25.3 points, 7.4 rebounds, and 6.8 assists per game on 52 percent shooting.[5] In the playoffs, the Cavaliers advanced comfortably to the NBA Finals, losing only two games en route to a rematch with the Golden State Warriors,[187] who were coming off a record-setting 73-win season.[188] To begin the series, Cleveland fell behind 3–1, including two blowout losses.[189] James responded by registering back-to-back 41-point games in Games 5 and 6, leading the Cavaliers to two consecutive wins to stave off elimination.[190] In Game 7, he posted a triple-double and made a number of key plays, including a chasedown block on Andre Iguodala's go-ahead layup attempt,[191] as Cleveland emerged victorious, winning the city's first professional sports title in 52 years and becoming the first team in NBA history to come back from a 3–1 series deficit in the Finals.[11] James became just the third player to record a triple-double in an NBA Finals Game 7,[192] and behind series averages of 29.7 points, 11.3 rebounds, 8.9 assists, 2.3 blocks, and 2.6 steals per game,[189] he also became the first player in league history to lead both teams in all five statistical categories for a playoff round, culminating in a unanimous Finals MVP selection.[193] The 2016–17 season was marred by injuries and unexpected losses for the Cavaliers;[194] James later described it as one of the \"strangest\" years of his career.[195] Following a January defeat to the New Orleans Pelicans, James publicly criticized Cleveland's front office for constructing a team that he felt was too \"top heavy\", for which he received countercriticism.[196] The Cavaliers finished the season as the East's second seed, with James averaging 26.4 points and career highs in rebounds (8.6), assists (8.7), and turnovers (4.1) per game.[5] In Game 3 of the first round of the playoffs, he registered 41 points, 13 rebounds, and 12 assists against the Indiana Pacers, leading Cleveland to a comeback victory after trailing by 25 points at halftime, representing the largest halftime deficit overcome in NBA playoff history.[197] In Game 5 of the Eastern Conference Finals against the Boston Celtics, James scored 35 points and surpassed Michael Jordan as the league's all-time postseason scoring leader.[198] The Cavaliers won the game and the series, advancing to the NBA Finals for the third consecutive time against the Golden State Warriors, who had signed James' rival Kevin Durant during the off-season.[199] Behind averages of 33.6 points, 12.0 rebounds, and 10.0 assists per game, James became the first player to average a triple-double in the Finals, but Cleveland was defeated in five games.[200] Prior to the start of the 2017–18 season, the Cavaliers overhauled their roster by trading Kyrie Irving to the Boston Celtics, who requested a trade in part because he no longer wanted to play with James.[201] After a slow start to the year, Cleveland rebounded by winning 18 of 19 games in December.[202] Their turnaround began with a victory over the Wizards on November 3 where James scored 57 points, which represented the second-highest point total of his career and tied a franchise record.[203] In January, the Cavaliers had a losing record, and James was criticized for his lackluster effort.[204] The next month, James won his third All-Star Game MVP Award, after posting 29 points, 10 rebounds, eight assists, and several key plays to help Team LeBron win over Team Curry.[205] Following another round of trades in February, Cleveland returned to form and James reached a number of historical milestones; on March 30, he set an NBA record with 867 straight games scoring in double digits.[206] James eventually finished the season with averages of 27.5 points, 8.6 rebounds, 9.2 assists, and 4.2 turnovers per game.[5] In the playoffs, James guided the Cavaliers to another Finals rematch with the Golden State Warriors.[207] Along the way, he had some of the most memorable moments of his career, including a game-winning shot against the Pacers and another against the Raptors, after which a new nickname, \"LeBronto\" was popularized.[208][209] In Game 1 of the NBA Finals, James scored a playoff career-high 51 points, but Cleveland lost 124–114 in overtime.[210] Following the loss, James injured his hand after punching a wall in the locker room, which hindered his effectiveness for the remainder of the series.[211] The Cavaliers lost the series in four games, with James averaging 34 points, 8.5 rebounds, and 10.0 assists per game for the Finals.[212] On June 29, 2018, James opted out of his contract with the Cavaliers and became an unrestricted free agent.[213] Two days later, his management company, Klutch Sports, announced that he would sign with the Los Angeles Lakers;[214] the deal was officially completed on July 9.[215] In an interview with Sports Illustrated, James's agent Rich Paul explained: \"In 2010, when he went to Miami, it was about championships. In 2014, when he went back to Cleveland, it was about delivering on a promise. In 2018, it was just about doing what he wants to do.\"[216] Reaction to the move was more positive than his original departure from the Cavaliers, albeit still mixed, as some onlookers felt that Los Angeles was not his optimal destination.[217] The Lakers expected James to immediately transform them into a championship contender after having missed the playoffs since 2014 and not appearing in the Finals since 2010.[218][219] Following his signing, the team rounded out their roster with a controversial collection of playmakers and veterans. To begin the 2018–19 season, the Lakers struggled to find effective lineups and recorded only two wins through their first seven games.[220] In November, they began a turnaround, which included two of James's strongest performances of the season. On November 14, he registered 44 points, 10 rebounds, and nine assists in a victory against the Portland Trail Blazers.[221] Four days later, James scored a season-high 51 points in a victory over the Heat.[222] After blowing out the Golden State Warriors on Christmas Day, Los Angeles improved their record to 20–14, but James suffered a groin injury,[223] the first major injury of his career.[224] James missed a then career-high 17 consecutive games, and the Lakers fell out of playoff contention without him,[223] marking the first time that James missed the playoffs since 2005.[225] In March, the Lakers announced that James would begin a minutes restriction,[226] and he was later officially ruled out for the rest of the season.[227] James' final averages were 27.4 points, 8.5 rebounds, and 8.3 assists per game.[5] Despite his inconsistent campaign, James was named to the All-NBA Third Team, marking the first time in twelve years that he did not make the All-NBA First Team.[228] \"Kobe is a brother to me. From the time I was in high school watching him from afar, to getting in this league at 18 and watching him up close, all the battles that we had throughout my career, the one thing that we always shared was that determination to just want to win, to just want to be great. The fact that I'm here now means so much to me. I want to continue, along with my teammates, his legacy. Not only for this year, but for as long as we can play this game of basketball that we love, because that's what Kobe Bryant would want. So in the words of Kobe Bryant, 'Mamba out'. But in the words of us, 'not forgotten' Live on, brother.\" During the offseason, the Lakers hired Frank Vogel as their new head coach, and traded the majority of their young core to the Pelicans for superstar big man Anthony Davis.[230] James immediately embraced the team's much-improved roster by transforming his playing style, moving to full-time point guard, and competing with a more consistent defensive effort.[231] Behind James' leadership, the Lakers opened the 2019–20 season with a 17–2 record, matching the best start in franchise history.[232] On January 25, James scored his 33,644th career point, passing Kobe Bryant for third on the all-time regular season scoring list.[233] The following day, Bryant died in a helicopter crash in Calabasas, California.[234] James delivered an improvised eulogy in honor of Bryant at Staples Center, before a January 31 game against the Portland Trail Blazers.[235] In early March, before the season was suspended due to the COVID-19 pandemic, James led the Lakers to a victory over the Milwaukee Bucks in a matchup of conference leaders, followed by a streak-breaking victory over the Los Angeles Clippers.[236] Regular season play resumed in July and concluded in August within the confined NBA Bubble, where James ended the regular season as the league leader in assists for the first time in his career, averaging 10.2 assists per game.[237] He earned a record 16th All-NBA Team selection as part of the First Team, extending his record First Team selections to 13.[238] The Lakers entered the playoffs as the top seed in the West and advanced to the NBA Finals convincingly, with only three total losses along the way.[239] In Game 5 of the Western Conference Finals against the Denver Nuggets, James helped clinch the conference championship by scoring a game-high 38 points, including 16 in the fourth quarter.[240] In the Finals, James and his teammates found themselves matched up with his former team, the Miami Heat, and quickly took control of the series with a 2–0 lead.[241] In Game 5, James had his best statistical performance of the Finals with 40 points, 13 rebounds, and seven assists in a memorable duel with Miami's Jimmy Butler, but Los Angeles was ultimately defeated in a three-point game.[242] The Lakers eliminated the Heat in Game 6, which earned James, who averaged 29.8 points, 11.8 rebounds, and 8.5 assists per game during the series,[243] his fourth NBA championship and fourth Finals MVP award.[12] At 35 years and 287 days old, James became the second-oldest player in league history to win the award,[244] and the only player in NBA history to win the award with three different franchises.[245] James and teammate Danny Green also became the third and fourth players in NBA history to win at least one championship with three different teams each.[246] The 2020–2021 season, reduced to 72 games for each team and starting on December 22, 2020, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, began after the shortest offseason in NBA history with a 116–109 loss to the Los Angeles Clippers.[247] On December 31, James became the first player in NBA history to score 10 points or more in 1,000 consecutive games in a 121–107 victory over the San Antonio Spurs.[248] On February 18, 2021, James became the third player in NBA history with 35,000 career points, joining Hall of Famers Kareem Abdul-Jabbar and Karl Malone; aged 36 years and 50 days, he was the youngest player to reach the milestone.[249] On March 20, James sprained his ankle against the Atlanta Hawks,[250] but was able to hit a three-point shot afterwards to keep his 10-points streak alive before exiting the game.[251] By March, the Lakers were No. 2, two games behind the Utah Jazz, but they went 14–16 without Davis and 6–10 without James, falling to No. 5.[252] James returned on April 30 after missing 20 games, the longest absence of his career.[253] In May, James was sidelined again after leaving a game against the Toronto Raptors,[254] but he returned for the final two games,[255][256] and finished the season with averages of 25.0 points, 7.7 rebounds, and 7.8 assists on 51.3 percent shooting in 45 out of 72 games;[257] this was his 17th consecutive season averaging at least 25 points per game, the most in NBA history.[258] In an injury-laden season, the Lakers ended with a 42–30 record, finishing No. 7 due to tiebreakers and facing the No. 8-seed Warriors in the play-in tournament.[259] The Lakers won 103–100 after James scored the go-ahead, three-point shot in the final minute, posting a triple-double with 22 points, 11 rebounds, and 10 assists, along with two steals and a block.[260] His 34-foot (10 m) shot over Stephen Curry before the shot clock buzzer was his longest basket of the season as well as his longest go-ahead shot in the closing three minutes of a game in his career.[261][262] In the first round of the playoffs, the Lakers faced the No. 2 Phoenix Suns. This marked the first time in James' career that he did not have home court advantage in the opening series.[263][264] They were up 2–1 before Davis suffered a strained groin in Game 4, in which James finished with a game-high 25 points on 10-for-21 shooting, 12 rebounds, and 6 assists.[265] The Lakers lost to the Suns in six games, marking the first time James lost in the first round in his career.[263] James finished the series averaging 23.3 points, his fourth-lowest scoring output for a series over his career and his lowest mark since averaging 22.8 in the 2014 Eastern Conference finals.[266] He made his 17th consecutive All-NBA Team selection,[3] extending the record for most selections in NBA history,[267] being named for the third time to the All-NBA Second Team.[268] For the 2021–22 season, James was joined by Carmelo Anthony and Russell Westbrook.[269] In a game against the Pistons on November 21, James was ejected in the third quarter after getting into a scuffle with Isaiah Stewart during the 121–116 victory. This was the second time in his career that he was ejected from a game,[270] and James was suspended for one game due to his actions.[271] In his next 16 games, James averaged 30.4 points, 8.9 rebounds, 6.3 assists, 1.6 steals, and 1.4 blocks on 54 percent shooting, also achieving his 100th triple-double,[272] while becoming the third player in NBA history to surpass 36,000 career points;[273] during this period, James played 35 percent of his minutes at center.[274][275] From December 19 to February 26, 2022, playing 23 out of 27 games, he had a streak of 23 consecutive 25-point games.[276] In December, James became the second player in NBA history (after Michael Jordan) to post 40 points and no turnovers at age 35 or older.[277] In January, James met the minimum criteria for points per game by playing at least 70 percent of his team's games, averaging 28.6 points, and became the oldest player to average 25+ points per game, having already been the youngest to do so, as James averaged 27.6 points per game in his sophomore season at 20 years old.[278] He also became the oldest player in NBA history to record at least 25 points in ten straight games, doing so at 37 years old.[279] By January 20, James became the fifth player in NBA history to record at least 30,000 career points and 10,000 career rebounds; he is the first player to record at least 30,000 career points, 10,000 career rebounds, and 9,000 career assists.[280][281][282] In the same period, he surpassed Oscar Robertson for 4th all-time free throws made,[283] and Alvin Robertson for 10th all-time in career steals.[284][285] In February, James surpassed Kareem Abdul-Jabbar for the most points scored in both the regular season and playoffs;[286] by March, he passed Karl Malone for second in the all-time minutes and regular season scoring lists.[287][288][289] At the 2022 NBA All-Star Game held in Cleveland, James was celebrated among the other 74 players for the NBA 75th Anniversary Team.[290] James led all players in fan votes with his 18th All-Star selection, tying Bryant and just one behind Abdul-Jabbar;[291] his team achieved its fifth consecutive All-Star victory,[292] defeating Team Durant 163–161,[293] with James hitting the game-winning dagger shot in front of his hometown crowd.[294][295] In March, James recorded two 50-point games, which were also his Lakers' career-high,[296][297] becoming the oldest player to have multiple 50-point games in a season, as well as the first Lakers player since Bryant in 2008 to have back-to-back 50-point home games; it was James' 15th 50-point game in his 19-year career, including the postseason.[298] He also recorded his 10,000th career assist, becoming the only player in NBA history to record at least 10,000 points, 10,000 rebounds, and 10,000 assists.[299][300] On March 27, James became just the second player in NBA history to score 37,000 points.[301] Due to an ankle injury in late March, he missed out on a close three-players run for the NBA scoring title,[302][303][304] having only played 56 games, two less than the necessary to qualify;[305] aged 37, James would have broken Jordan's record of oldest scoring leader at 34.[306] For The Athletic, Bill Oram wrote that James' ankle injury felt like \"the moment that might signal the end of the Lakers season\".[307][308] On April 5, the Lakers were eliminated from both playoff and play-in contention for the first time since 2019 (James's first season with the Lakers) after a 121–110 loss to the Phoenix Suns.[309] It marked the fourth time in James' career that he missed the playoffs.[310] James was ruled out the rest of the season due to soreness in his left ankle.[311] He finished the season with a 7.6 box plus–minus (first among players in his age group) and averages of 30.3 points (first by 6.9 points among players in his age range), 8.2 rebounds, 6.2 assists, 2.9 threes, 1.3 steals, and 1.1 blocks per game on 52–35–75 shooting ranges.[312] On May 24, James was named to the All-NBA Third Team for the second time; it was his 18th consecutive All-NBA Team selection, extending the record for most selections in NBA history.[313] On August 18, 2022, James re-signed with the Lakers on a two-year, $97.1 million contract.[314][315] The contract extension made him the highest-paid athlete in NBA history at $528.9 million, surpassing Kevin Durant in all-time earnings.[316] On October 20, James made his 2,144th three-pointer in a game against the Los Angeles Clippers, surpassing Paul Pierce for tenth in all-time three-pointers made.[317] On October 28, James posted 28 points, seven rebounds, five assists, and four steals in an 111–102 loss to the Minnesota Timberwolves.

At age 39 years and 319 days, he broke his own record previously set in November 2019 for the oldest player to record a triple-double in three consecutive games.[386] Two days later, he recorded his fourth consecutive triple-double of the season with 15 points, 16 rebounds, and 12 assists, in a 120–115 victory against the San Antonio Spurs, breaking his personal record for the most consecutive triple-doubles made. He also tied the Lakers franchise record for the most consecutive triple-doubles made, joining Magic Johnson (1981, 1987) and Russell Westbrook (2021).[387] On December 1, he reached 15,000 career field goals in a 105–104 victory against the Utah Jazz, joining Kareem Abdul-Jabbar as the only players to reach said milestone.[388] On December 19, he passed Abdul-Jabbar for the most career regular season minutes played.[389] As a 19-year-old rookie, James made his debut for the United States national team at the 2004 Olympics in Athens, Greece.[390] He spent the Games mostly on the bench,[391] averaging 14.6 minutes per game with 5.8 points, and 2.6 rebounds per game in eight games.[390] Team USA finished the competition with a bronze medal, becoming the first U.S. basketball team to return home without a gold medal since adding active NBA players to their lineup.[392] James felt that his limited playing time was a \"lowlight\" and believed he was not given \"a fair opportunity to play\".[391] At the 2006 FIBA World Championship in Japan, James took on a greater role for Team USA, averaging 13.9 points, 4.8 rebounds, and 4.1 assists per game as co-captain.[393][394] The team finished the tournament with an 8–1 record, winning another bronze medal.[393] James's behavior was again questioned, this time by teammate Bruce Bowen, who confronted James during tryouts regarding his treatment of staff members.[395][396] Before naming James to the 2008 Olympic team, Team USA managing director Jerry Colangelo and coach Mike Krzyzewski gave James an ultimatum to improve his attitude, and he heeded their advice.[395][397] At the FIBA Americas Championship 2007, he averaged 18.1 points, 3.6 rebounds, and 4.7 assists per game, including a 31-point performance against Argentina in the championship game, the most ever by an American in an Olympic qualifier.[398] Team USA went 10–0, winning the gold medal and qualifying for the 2008 Olympics in Beijing, China.[390] James credited the team's attitude and experience for their improvement, saying: \"I don't think we understood what it meant to put on a USA uniform and all the people that we were representing in 2004. We definitely know that now.\"[399] At the Olympics, Team USA went unbeaten, winning their first gold medal since 2000.[400] In the final game, James' statistics were – 14 points, six rebounds, and three assists against Spain.[401] James did not play at the 2010 FIBA World Championship but rejoined Team USA for the 2012 Olympics in London, England.[402] He became the leader of the team, with Bryant, who would soon be 34, stepping back.[403] James facilitated the offense from the post and perimeter, called the defensive sets, and provided scoring when needed.[404] During a game against Australia, he recorded the first triple-double in U.S. Olympic basketball history with 11 points, 14 rebounds, and 12 assists.[d] Team USA went on to win their second straight gold medal, again defeating Spain in the final game.[406] James contributed 19 points in the victory, becoming the all-time leading scorer in U.S. men's basketball history.[390][406] He also joined Michael Jordan as the only players to win an NBA MVP award, NBA championship, NBA Finals MVP, and Olympic gold medal in the same year.[407] Afterwards, Krzyzewski said: \"[James] is the best player, he is the best leader and he is as smart as anybody playing the game right now.\"[408] After a 12-year gap, James rejoined the national team on the 2024 Olympic squad in Paris as Team Captain at 39 years old.[409] Voted by the entire 592-strong U.S. delegation, James was named as one of the two Team USA flag-bearers for the opening ceremony of the games, becoming the first male basketball player to be so honored.[410][411] James led the team in rebounds and assists. He recorded his second Olympic triple double in a comeback win in the semi-final against Serbia with 16 points, 12 rebounds and 10 assists.[412] James became the first player in Olympic history with two triple doubles.[413] Team USA went on to win their fifth straight gold medal, defeating France 98–87 in the final game,[414] with James recording 14 points, 6 rebounds and 10 assists. At the conclusion of the tournament with averages of 14.2 points, 6.8 rebounds and 8.5 assists, James was named the FIBA Men's Olympics MVP and was selected to the FIBA Men's Olympics All-Star Five.[415] James became the third male basketball player to win three gold medals at the Olympics. Standing 6 feet 9 inches (2.06 m) tall and weighing 250 pounds (113 kg),[416] James has played the majority of his career at the small forward and power forward positions,[5] but he has also been deployed at the other positions when necessary.[417] His playing style, which is athletic and versatile,[134] has drawn comparisons to Basketball Hall of Famers Oscar Robertson, Magic Johnson, and Michael Jordan.[418][419][420] Through the 2023–24 season, James' career averages are 27.1 points, 7.5 rebounds, 7.4 assists, 1.5 steals, and 0.7 blocks per game.[5] Throughout the 2010s, he was usually ranked as the best player in the NBA each season by ESPN and Sports Illustrated.[421][422] As an 18-year-old rookie, James led the Cavaliers in scoring.[424] He holds numerous \"youngest to\" distinctions,[425][426] including being the youngest player to score 30,000 career points.[427] During his first stint in Cleveland, James was primarily used as an on-ball point forward, and although his shooting tendencies were perimeter-oriented,[134] he established himself as one of the best slashers and finishers in basketball.[428][429] His combination of speed, quickness, and size often created matchup problems for opposing teams because James was capable of blowing by larger defenders and overpowering smaller ones.[430] These qualities became more apparent in transition, where he developed a reputation for grabbing defensive rebounds and then beating the defense downcourt for highlight reel baskets.[431] Around this time, James was frequently criticized for not having a reliable jump shot or post game.[432] Teams would try to exploit these weaknesses by giving him space in the half court and forcing him to settle for three-pointers and long two-pointers, a strategy famously used by Spurs coach Gregg Popovich in the 2007 Finals, where James converted on only 36 percent of his field goals in four games.[433] In Miami, Heat coach Erik Spoelstra changed James' role to a more unconventional one.[134] James spent more time in the post and improved his shot selection and accuracy on jump shots.[134][434] He also learned how to work as an off-ball cutter in the Heat's \"pass-happy\" offense.[435] Behind these improvements, James' overall scoring efficiency rose to historically great levels.[436] During this time, ESPN's Tom Haberstroh called James's free-throw shooting his biggest weakness, describing it as \"average\".[437] Upon returning to the Cavaliers, James began to experience subtle age-related declines in productivity,[438] posting his lowest scoring averages since his rookie season in 2015 and 2016.[5][439] His shooting also temporarily regressed, and James briefly ranked as the NBA's worst high-volume shooter from outside the paint.[440] Despite these changes, he remained an elite offensive player who beat defenses with body control, strength, and varying attacking speeds.[430] For most of his career, James has controlled the offense as the primary ball handler on his team.[441] His playmaking ability is generally considered one of his premier skills, and some analysts rank him among the greatest passers in NBA history.[442] By exploiting his size, vision, and the attention James garners from opposing defenses,[443] he creates easy points for his teammates with accurate assists.[444] James executes unconventional passes, including after leaving his feet and through defensive traffic.[445] His uncanny tendency to find the open man has helped force NBA teams to incorporate some elements of zone into their schemes to better cover the weak side of the court and prevent James from passing to open shooters.[430] Early in his career, James was criticized for overpassing in pressure situations, in particular for passing instead of shooting in the waning seconds of close games;[446][447] however, as his career progressed, James' clutch performance was viewed more favorably.[448] At the beginning of his NBA career, James was considered a poor defensive player,[449] but he improved steadily through the years. In 2009, James became proficient at the chase-down block, which involves coming in from behind the opposition in transition to block the shot.[75] In Miami, he developed into a more versatile defensive player, and the Heat relied on him to guard all five positions.[450] From the years 2012–2016, he was ranked among the top three defenders in the NBA by general managers, earning the vote as the best perimeter defender in the league preceding the 2014–15 NBA season.[451] Along with Shane Battier and Dwyane Wade, Miami used James in an ultra-aggressive defensive scheme,[452] with James cheating off the ball to help out inside or get into rebounding position.[453] Beginning in 2014, some analysts reported a regression in his defensive impact, stemming from a lack of effort and expected age-related declines.[454][455] During his second stint in Cleveland, James' defense progressively declined. After missed drives on offense, he often dawdled back on defense while complaining to the referees; he provided less help off the ball, and was less aggressive in switching.[456] James himself admitted to taking plays off at times, referring to this approach as \"chill mode\".[457] He eventually developed a reputation for raising his defensive level in the playoffs, which some analysts referred to as \"Playoff LeBron\".[458] James left high school as one of the most hyped prospects in NBA history.[e] Upon entering the NBA, he made an immediate impact and was voted Rookie of the Year in his debut season.[464] As of 2024, James has been named to 20 All-NBA Teams, including 13 times to the First Team, which are both NBA records.[3] His four MVP awards are matched only by Michael Jordan, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, Wilt Chamberlain, and Bill Russell; James and Russell are the only players to win four MVP awards in a five-year span.[465] James has also won four Finals MVP Awards, which is the second-most all-time,[466] and earned All-Defensive honors every season from 2009 to 2014.[5] While James has never won the Defensive Player of the Year Award, he has finished second in the voting twice and lists it as one of his main goals.[74][467] His teams have appeared in the Finals ten times and won four championships; his 10 Finals appearances are tied for third all-time.[f] Some analysts have criticized him for not having a better Finals record, while others have countered that James usually performed well but his team was defeated by superior competition.[469][470][471] On the basis of his career longevity and on-court performances, sports publications have consistently included James in rankings of the best basketball players in history,[g] and he was named the Associated Press Male Athlete of the Decade for the 2010s.[479] This has resulted in frequent comparisons to Michael Jordan.[a] In a 2016 interview with Sports Illustrated, James acknowledged that his motivation was surpassing Jordan as the greatest.[480] In February 2018, The Ringer spent an entire week devoted to both players, with Bill Simmons ultimately concluding that Jordan was still ahead.[481] In polls, James has ranked second behind Jordan.[482][483][484] The results strongly correlate with age, with older voters more commonly choosing Jordan.[483][484] Davis et al. of Business Insider stated: \"The data would suggest that younger, more-engaged NBA fans lean toward James, as he's still playing. Older generations who watched Jordan play and tune in less today lean toward Jordan.\"[484] Referring to James as the best challenger to Jordan's status as the greatest basketball player of all time, Sam Quinn of CBS Sports stated that \"the margin for error where Jordan is involved is overwhelmingly slim\" and that \"in the rings-obsessed basketball discourse\", Jordan having more titles and an \"unblemished Finals record holds significant weight\".[480] In addition to praising James' on-court accomplishments, analysts have also noted his influence on player empowerment throughout the NBA, which stemmed from his willingness to change teams during free agency. Ben Golliver of The Washington Post opined that James' move to the Heat in 2010 \"defined a decade of player movement\", and that he \"fundamentally flipped the power balance between stars and their organizations.\"[485] James' fellow players have also remarked on his influence, such as Warriors forward Draymond Green, who reflected: \"We've taken control of our destiny. And I think a lot of people hate that ... I think the doors that he's opened for athletes and especially basketball players is his biggest accomplishment.\"[486] Multiple current and former NBA players have suggested James' free agency decisions catalyzed the leaguewide trend in \"superteams\" in the 21st century.[487][488][489][490][491] In 2022, James voiced his desire to play into his forties potentially alongside or against his sons Bronny and Bryce.[492] This eventually happened when Bronny was selected by the Lakers 55th overall in the 2024 NBA draft, making them the first father-son duo in NBA history.[493] James married his high school sweetheart, Savannah James, on September 14, 2013, in San Diego, California.[494] They have three children: sons Bronny and Bryce, and daughter Zhuri.[492][495] Bronny was a standout high school basketball player, being named a McDonald's All-American in 2023, 20 years after James's selection.[496] During his stint with the Heat, James resided in Coconut Grove, where he bought a $9 million three-story mansion overlooking Biscayne Bay.[497] In November 2015, James bought a 9,350 square-foot (870 m2) East Coast-style mansion in Brentwood, Los Angeles, for about $21 million.[498] He purchased another home in Brentwood in December 2017 for $23 million.[499] In September 2020, he purchased a third home in Los Angeles, this one in Beverly Hills for $36.75 million.[500] James also owns a 30,000 square foot mansion in Akron, Ohio that he custom built in 2003 on his property and spent $2.1 million on it.[501] James's best friends in the NBA are Carmelo Anthony, Chris Paul, and former Heat teammate Dwyane Wade. The four have been referred to as the \"banana boat crew\". During an excursion to the Bahamas, James rescued Anthony from the water when Anthony was carried away from the boat by the current. During an Instagram Live session, Anthony later recounted: \"He saved my life\". When asked about how much danger Anthony was in prior to the rescue, James responded: \"I don't really know what to say, to be honest. I'm just happy he's still here, obviously.\"[502] James also maintains a friendship with fellow NBA player Draymond Green.[503] James invests heavily in his health, reportedly spending $1.5 million a year to pay for personal chefs, athletic trainers, and physical therapies for recovery. Kyle Korver has described James's fitness as being on \"another level\". However, James' routine is not perfectly clean; he drinks wine every night, believing it to be good for his heart,[504] while Tristan Thompson has stated that James eats desserts with every meal.[505] In January 2009, doctors at the Cleveland Clinic discovered a growth in the right side of James's jaw. Biopsy results showed that James developed a benign jaw tumor, specifically in his parotid gland,[506] which required a five-hour surgery to remove on June 2 after the end of the Cavaliers' run in the 2009 playoffs.[507] James is considered by fellow NBA players, media tabloids, and popular culture to be the \"face of the NBA\", often alongside Warriors superstar Stephen Curry.[508][509] His opinions have yielded significant influence on people who make important league decisions; for example, in 2014, James asked commissioner Adam Silver to increase the duration of the All-Star break, and the request was granted the following season.[510] On February 13, 2015, James was elected the first vice president of the National Basketball Players Association (NBPA).[511] Throughout his career, James has been ranked by Forbes as one of the world's most influential athletes,[h] and has been listed by Time as one of the 100 most influential people in the world.[514] During his first stint with the Cavaliers, James was adored by local fans, and Sherwin-Williams displayed a giant Nike-produced banner of James on its world headquarters.[515] Despite their affection for James, Cleveland fans and critics were frequently annoyed when he sported a Yankees hat when he attended Cleveland Indians baseball games against the New York Yankees.[516] Following his actions during the 2010 free agency period and The Decision, James was listed as one of the most disliked athletes in the United States.[517] By 2013, his image had mostly recovered and he was reported by ESPN as the most popular player in the NBA for the second time in his career.[518] In 2014, James was named the most popular male athlete in America by the Harris Poll.[519] He has led the league in jersey sales six times.[520] Memorabilia associated with James is highly sought after; two of James' rookie cards are among the most expensive basketball cards ever sold at auction, and one of those cards also briefly held the record for the most expensive modern-day sports card when it sold for $1.8 million at auction in July 2020.[523] A Mike Trout rookie card broke the record for a modern-day card the following month.[524] All jerseys worn in the 2020 NBA All-Star Game were auctioned by the NBA and NBPA to raise funds for charity; James' jersey sold for $630,000, setting a record for a modern-day sports jersey.[525] In March 2008, James became the first black man, as well as the third man overall after Richard Gere and George Clooney, to appear on the cover of Vogue, when he posed with Gisele Bündchen.[526] In response, ESPN columnist Jemele Hill considered the cover offensive and \"memorable for the wrong reasons\", describing the demeanor of James and his holding Bündchen as a reference to classic imagery of the movie monster King Kong, a dark savage capturing his fair-skinned love interest.[521][522] James has maintained close ties to his hometown of Akron, Ohio, which is also where his charity foundation, the LeBron James Family Foundation (LJFF), is based.[527] Since 2005, the foundation has held an annual bike-a-thon to raise money for various causes.[528] In 2015, James announced a partnership with the University of Akron to provide scholarships for as many as 2,300 children beginning in 2021.[529] In 2017, he received the J. Walter Kennedy Citizenship Award from the NBA for his \"outstanding service and dedication to the community.\"[530] In November 2017, the Akron School Board approved the I Promise School, a public elementary school created in a partnership with the LJFF to help struggling elementary school students stay in school.[531] The school officially opened on July 30, 2018, with James reflecting that it was his most important professional accomplishment.[532] Other noteworthy public and charitable initiatives undertaken by James in Akron include the I Promise Institute at the University of Akron,[533] I Promise Village (housing complex),[534] House Three-Thirty (community center/retail plaza),[535] and I Promise Health Quarters (medical center).[15] James is also an active supporter of various non-profit organizations, including After-School All-Stars, Boys & Girls Clubs of America, and Children's Defense Fund.[536][537][538] In 2016, he donated $2.5 million to the Smithsonian National Museum of African American History and Culture to support an exhibit on Muhammad Ali.[539] Throughout his career, James has taken public stances on controversial issues, and has mentioned a feeling of obligation to effect change using his status.[540] Those include the War in Darfur,[541] the killing of Trayvon Martin,[542] the now-former NBA owner Donald Sterling's racist comments in 2014,[540] the Michael Brown verdict,[543] the death of Eric Garner,[544] the U.S. national anthem kneeling protests,[545] the shooting of Breonna Taylor,[546] the death of Ma'Khia Bryant,[547] Kyle Rittenhouse,[548] and the ruling of Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization that overturned Roe v. Wade in 2022.[549] On August 27, 2020, James and his Lakers teammates, as well as the Bucks, began boycotting the 2020 NBA playoffs to protest the shooting of Jacob Blake.[550] In response, senior White House advisor Jared Kushner stated that he was planning to reach out to James regarding the boycott. Following a players' committee to discuss the boycott, James and others reached out to former president Barack Obama, who reportedly advised them to continue playing and finish that year's NBA season.[551] During the 2019–2020 Hong Kong protests, a statement James made about a since-deleted tweet by Daryl Morey,[552] in which Morey expressed support for the pro-democracy movement in Hong Kong, became the subject of controversy. James said Morey was \"misinformed\".[553] His statement drew backlash from protesters in the movement.[554][555] In February 2022, political commentator Bill Maher called James hypocritical for not taking a critical stance towards the Chinese government's human rights abuses.[556] James had taken various other stands on issues regarding sports, such as the Kaepernick controversy and the Houston Astros sign stealing scandal.[557][558] In October 2023, in response to the 2023 Israel–Hamas war, James voiced his support for Israel on Instagram.[559] His statement drew backlash for its omission of the Palestinians affected by the crisis, including from Palestinian-American leader and activist Omar Suleiman.[560][561][562] In June 2008, James donated $20,000 to a committee in support of Barack Obama for the 2008 U.S. presidential election.[563] Later that year, James gathered almost 20,000 people at the then-called Quicken Loans Arena for a viewing of Obama's 30-minute American Stories, American Solutions television advertisement.[564] The advertisement was shown on a large screen above the stage, where Jay-Z later held a free concert.[564] In November 2016, James endorsed and campaigned for Hillary Clinton for the 2016 U.S. presidential election.[565] Following a racist incident at his Los Angeles home in 2017, James expressed that \"being black in America is tough. We got a long way to go for us as a society and for us as African Americans until we feel equal in America.\"[566] Later on that year, in the aftermath of the Unite the Right rally, James questioned the \"Make America Great Again\" slogan and said: \"It's sad what's going on in Charlottesville. Is this the direction our country is heading? Make America Great Again huh? Our youth deserve better!!\"[567] James also called President Donald Trump a \"bum\" after the president rescinded a White House invitation to Stephen Curry.[568] During a 2018 interview with CNN journalist Don Lemon, James then accused Trump of attempting to divide the country with sports, suggesting that \"sports has never been something that divides people it's always been something that brings someone together.\" He declared that he would \"never sit across from him. I'd sit across from Obama though.\"[569][570] In response, Trump tweeted: \"LeBron James was just interviewed by the dumbest man on television, Don Lemon. He made LeBron look smart, which isn't easy to do.\"[571] On August 19, 2020, James announced his intentions to support the Joe Biden 2020 presidential campaign and that of his running-mate Kamala Harris in advance of the 2020 U.S. presidential election.[572] James spoke in support of the More Than a Vote movement and encouraged members of the African-American community to vote,[573] saying, \"People in our community have been just lied to for so many years. We have people that have had convictions in the past, that've been told they cannot vote because they got a conviction. That is voter suppression.\"[574] On October 31, 2024, James announced his support for the Kamala Harris 2024 presidential campaign in the 2024 U.S. presidential election.[575] According to Forbes, in May 2023, James became the first active NBA player to become a billionaire,[576] making him one of the richest celebrities. James' biography LeBron was published on April 11, 2023, by Jeff Benedict. The biography is based on three years of research and more than 250 interviews.[577] James has signed numerous endorsement contracts; some of the companies that he has done business with are AT&T,[578] Audemars Piguet,[579] Beats by Dre,[580] Blaze Pizza,[581] Coca-Cola,[582] Dunkin' Brands,[583] Intel,[584] Kia,[585] McDonald's,[586] Nike,[582]PepsiCo,[587] State Farm,[588] and Taco Bell.[589] Coming out of high school, James was the target of a three-way bidding war among Nike, Reebok, and Adidas,[590] eventually signing a seven-year deal with Nike in 2003[591] for approximately $90 million.[592] His signature shoes have performed well for Nike.[593] In 2011, Fenway Sports Group became the sole global marketer of his rights, and as part of the deal, James was granted a minority stake in the English Premier League football club Liverpool,[594] who he has claimed his support for.[595] As a result of his endorsement money and NBA salary, James has been listed as one of the world's highest-paid athletes.[596] In 2013, he surpassed Bryant as the highest paid basketball player in the world, with earnings of $56.5 million.[597] In 2014, James realized a profit of more than $30 million as part of Apple's acquisition of Beats Electronics; he had originally struck a deal to get a small stake in the company at its inception in exchange for promoting its headphones.[598] In 2015, James was ranked the sixth highest earning sportsperson,[599] and third highest in 2016 (after Cristiano Ronaldo and Lionel Messi).[600] James has stated that he would like to own an NBA team in the future, albeit in a hands-off capacity.[601] In 2011, James co-founded the designer retail store UNKNWN in Miami, Florida.[602] During Super Bowl LVI in 2022, James appeared in a Crypto.com advertisement, where he conversed with a CGI version of his younger self, offering advice about the future. The commercial, produced by James' SpringHill Company and directed by Calmatic, did not directly promote the service, sparked social media buzz, and inspired a series of memes centered on the advice he could have offered.[603] Subsequently, Crypto.com launched an NFT airdrop campaign, distributing 5,550 tokens featuring the NBA champion. Participants were chosen randomly from those who scanned a QR code in the Super Bowl ad.[604] Also, in 2022, James' charity LeBron James Family Foundation, partnered with Crypto.com to educate underserved Akron communities with blockchain-related knowledge and Web3 tools, aiming to ensure inclusive advancement in the digital age.[605][606] James and comedian Jimmy Kimmel co-hosted the 2007 ESPY Awards.[607] In other comedic pursuits, he hosted the 33rd-season premiere of Saturday Night Live.[608] James has also tried his hand at acting, appearing in a cameo role on the HBO series Entourage.[609] In 2015, he played himself in the Judd Apatow film Trainwreck,[610] receiving positive reviews for his performance.[611] That same year, James' digital video company Uninterrupted raised $15.8 million from Warner Bros. Entertainment and Turner Sports to help expand the company's efforts to bring athlete-created content to fans. It is hosted on Bleacher Report and is used by several other athletes including Tampa Bay Buccaneers tight end Rob Gronkowski and cornerback Richard Sherman.[612] James and his business partner Maverick Carter own production company SpringHill Entertainment,[613] whose first work was the Lions Gate documentary More Than a Game, which was released in 2009 and chronicled James' high school years.[614] Series produced by SpringHill include the NBC game show The Wall,[615] the Disney XD sports documentary show Becoming,[616] the Starz sitcom Survivor's Remorse,[617] and the animated web series The LeBrons.[618] In 2016, CNBC aired an unscripted series hosted by James called Cleveland Hustles, where four up-and-coming Northern Ohio entrepreneurs will be financed on the condition of revitalizing a neighborhood in Cleveland.[619] In the 2017 Toronto International Film Festival, a 60-minute Vince Carter documentary entitled The Carter Effect was executive produced by James and Maverick Carter along with rapper Drake and Future the Prince.[620][621] In February 2018, it was announced that James' production company will produce a new film in the House Party series with James expected to make a cameo.[622] Later that month, Fox News host Laura Ingraham told James to \"shut up and dribble\" as a response to his political agendas.[623] This largely contributed to James creating a documentary film series looking at the changing role of athletes in the current political and cultural climate, aptly named, Shut Up and Dribble on Showtime.[624] James partnered with Arnold Schwarzenegger in 2018 to found Ladder, a company that developed nutritional supplements to help athletes with severe cramps after dealing with that issue during the 2014 Finals.[625] In February 2019, it was revealed that James would executive produce rapper 2 Chainz's new album Rap or Go to the League.[626] A Def Jam press release said the intent of the album is \"celebrating black excellence and focusing on the power of education and entrepreneurship.\" The press release also says the title \"challenges the notion that the only way out of the inner city is either to become a rapper or a ball player.\"[627] As of June 2023, James is the most followed basketball player on Instagram, with over 155 million followers.[628] In June 2022, it was announced James was launching a media company in partnership with professional tennis player Naomi Osaka and Maverick Carter. The production and content creation company will be named Hana Kuma, which means \"flower\" and \"bear\" in Japanese.[629] In March 2024, James and JJ Redick launched a podcast called Mind the Game, where the two have \"pure conversations about basketball.\"[630][631][632] In 2012, James, Carter and Paul Wachter made an investment of less than $1 million in the Pasadena-based fast casual chain Blaze Pizza; their investment had grown to $25 million by 2017.[633] James later became a spokesman for the company and began appearing in advertisements after ending his contract with McDonald's.[633] During the 2019 offseason, James filed for a trademark through a shell company on the term \"Taco Tuesday\" for use in downloadable audio/visual works, podcasts, social media, online marketing, and entertainment services.[634] This was related to James's use of the term on Instagram for his family's taco dinners. The request was denied by the United States Patent and Trademark Office, stating that Taco Tuesday was \"a commonplace term, message or expression widely used by a variety of sources that merely conveys an ordinary, familiar, well-recognized concept or sentiment.\"[635] In November 2020, James became an angel investor of the tequila and mezcal company Lobos 1707.[636] After personal frustration with comments on the Black Lives Matter movement made by Republican U.S. senator Kelly Loeffler, who at the time was the owner of the WNBA's Atlanta Dream, James assisted Dream player Renee Montgomery in her ultimately successful bid to buy the team in March 2021.[637] That same year, James joined Fenway Sports Group as a partner, making him a part-owner of the Boston Red Sox, New England Sports Network, RFK Racing, and Liverpool F.C., the latter of which he already owned a two-percent share in individually.[638] The investment made James and Carter the company's first black partners.[638] James has expressed his interest in owning an NBA team once he finishes playing basketball, specifically a team located in Las Vegas, Nevada, either through expansion or relocation.[639] In August 2022, James, alongside Canadian musician Drake, became part owners of the Italian football club A.C. Milan.[640] James is also a part owner of the Pittsburgh Penguins of the National Hockey League (NHL).[641] James is represented by agent Rich Paul of Klutch Sports.[642] His first agent was Aaron Goodwin, whom he left in 2005 for Leon Rose. Rose joined Creative Artists Agency (CAA) in 2007, and he worked with fellow CAA agent Henry Thomas, who represented Dwyane Wade and Chris Bosh, to bring James to Miami in 2010. James left CAA for Paul in 2012.[643] James, Paul, Maverick Carter, and Randy Mims—all childhood friends—formed agent and sports-marketing company LRMR after James left Goodwin. LRMR handles James's marketing, including the marketing of The Decision, for which it was criticized.[644][645] Throughout his career, James has taken a unique approach to his NBA contracts, usually opting to sign shorter-term deals in order to maximize his earnings potential and flexibility;[116][646][647] in 2006, James and the Cavaliers negotiated a three-year, $60 million contract extension instead of the four-year maximum as it allotted him the option of seeking a new contract worth more money as an unrestricted free agent following the 2010 season.[648] This move ultimately allowed James, Dwyane Wade, and Chris Bosh to sign together with the Heat.[649] During the 2011 NBA lockout, James received contract offers to play professional football from the Dallas Cowboys and Seattle Seahawks,[650] which he gave serious consideration to and even began training with it in mind.[651] During his second stint in Cleveland, based on a negotiation strategy devised by NBA agent Mark Termini, who worked with Paul and specialized in contract negotiation and construction,[652] James began re-signing[653][654] on new contracts after each season in order to take advantage of higher salaries resulting from the NBA's rising salary cap.[175] In 2016, he signed with the Cavaliers on a three-year deal,[655] becoming the highest-paid player in the league for the first time in his career.[656]",

                "content": "LeBron Raymone James Sr. (born December 30, 1984[2]) is an American professional basketball player who plays in the National Basketball Association (NBA) on the Los Angeles Lakers with 17 titles. He is married with Savannah Brinson James and has 3 children. They are Bronny James, Bryce James, and Zhuri James. He is also a film producer and a business man. Among the best basketball players of the twenty-first century, he has a lot of experience. Both Space Jam: A New Legacy and Trainwreck featured him as himself. He is the proprietor of the SpringHill Company. The Cleveland Cavaliers picked him in the 2003 NBA Draft with the first pick in the draft, not only for his athletics ability but for the revenue he could bring to the team and city. James did not play college basketball, and entered the NBA Draft immediately after high school. He went to high school in Akron, Ohio. James played with the Cavaliers for his first seven seasons. During that time, he was one of the NBA's top scorers. He was selected as an All-Star several times. In 2007, he led Cleveland to the NBA Finals. He was the Most Valuable Player (MVP) of the NBA for the 2008-09 NBA season and 2009-10 NBA season. On July 8, 2010, on a show in ESPN called \"The Decision\" LeBron said that he would next play for the Miami Heat.[3] On December 2, 2010, James played in Cleveland for the first time since leaving, scoring 38 points for the Heat as they beat the Cavaliers, 118-90. Many fans angry at James for leaving Cleveland booed him throughout the game and held up signs with negative statements against James.[4] In the 2011 season the Miami Heat came in second place right behind the Chicago Bulls lead by Derrick Rose in the NBA. They made it to the finals of the NBA and lost in six games to the Dallas Mavericks [5] This caused celebration in Cleveland because they hated LeBron for what he did to them.[6] In the 2012 Finals, LeBron James won his first championship after the Miami Heat defeated the Oklahoma City Thunder 4-1 games, after battling with the Boston Celtics 4-3 games the previous round. The next year, LeBron James won his second title when the Heat defeated the San Antonio Spurs in seven games. In both years he won the MVP title of finals and of regular season. In 2014, James competed a good season but he wasn't the MVP. In the 2014 Finals, the Heat's Finals streak ended after being defeated by the San Antonio Spurs in five games (4-1).[7] Shortly after those Finals had ended, LeBron James said he would use an early termination option in his contract, leaving the Miami Heat and becoming a free agent. He said this on June 24, 2014.[8] Then, on June 25, 2014, in a first-person essay in Sports Illustrated, he said he would return to the Cleveland Cavaliers. On July 12, 2014, James signed a two-year, $42.1 million contract to return to the Cavaliers. The deal also contains an option to become a free agent again after the 2014–15 NBA season.[9] LeBron now plays on the Los Angeles Lakers. In 2015, he took the Cleveland Cavaliers to the NBA Finals, without Kevin Love but lost to the Golden State Warriors in 6 games after losing Kyrie Irving after he had an ankle injury. He led the Cleveland Cavaliers to an NBA championship after being down 3-1 games to their first-ever title in 2016 and later played a crucial role in bringing glory to the Los Angeles Lakers.[10] No team had ever come back from a 3-1 deficit in the Finals before. He had a historic moment where he blocked Andre Iguodala on possibly the game winning layup. The Cavaliers went on to lose to the Golden State Warriors the following season. Now with the Lakers he passed Kobe Bryant. On August 18, 2022, James re-signed with the Los Angeles Lakers on a two-year, $97.1M deal.[11][12] The contract extension made James the highest-paid athlete in NBA history at $528.9M, surpassing Kevin Durant in all-time earnings.[13] In 2021, James starred in Space Jam: A New Legacy where he played a version of himself. LeBron is widely considered to be the greatest basketball player of all time, as well as one of the most influential athletes and sports players in the world.[14] On February 7, 2023, James surpassed Kareem Abdul-Jabbar's 38,387-point total during a game against the Oklahoma City Thunder. Currently, LeBron is staying at 40,474, which is 2087 higher than Kareem Abdul-Jabbar. He was the youngest player to reach this point. He is also well known for his assists, and with 10,759, he is now the player with the fourth-most assistances. James and Michael Jordan are the only players to win an NBA MVP award, NBA title, NBA Finals MVP, and Olympic gold medal in the same calendar year. The USA would go on to win the Olympics twice.[15] Since even before he made his NBA debut, James has been associated with Nike. They In 2003, he agreed to a seven-year contract with the business that was worth little under $90 million. Many people at the time questioned whether Nike put a little too much faith in an 18-year-old who had never played a professional game. LeBron became one of the biggest players in the NBA and a four-time MVP as a result of the risk, which paid off brilliantly. James has been a success for Nike off the court as well, in addition to on it. Until now the sales of his signature sneaker reached $340 million between February 2014 and January 2015, making him the highest-paid employee at the company.[16]",

LeBron James is an American professional basketball player who is widely considered one of the greatest all-around basketball players of all time. James has won four National Basketball Association championships with three different teams, and he has been named NBA MVP four times. In 2023 he became the NBA’s all-time leading scorer, and in 2024 he became the first NBA player to score 40,000 points. James has also won gold medals at the Olympics, in 2008 and 2012. LeBron James, who was born in 1984 in Akron, Ohio, became a locally known basketball prodigy while in elementary school. James led Akron’s St. Vincent–St. Mary High School to three state championships in four years. He was named Ohio’s Mr. Basketball—the high-school player of the year—three times during 2001–03. LeBron James was selected first overall in the 2003 National Basketball Association draft by the Cleveland Cavaliers. He played for the Cavaliers through the end of the 2009–10 season. He then signed with the Miami Heat but returned to the Cavaliers in 2014. James joined the Los Angeles Lakers in 2018. He won NBA championships with all three teams. LeBron James has won four National Basketball Association championships. He won his first two championships with the Miami Heat in 2012 and 2013. He won a third championship with the Cleveland Cavaliers in 2016. His fourth championship came with the Los Angeles Lakers in 2020. LeBron James (born December 30, 1984, Akron, Ohio, U.S.) is an American professional basketball player who is widely considered one of the greatest all-around players of all time and who won National Basketball Association (NBA) championships with the Miami Heat (2012 and 2013), the Cleveland Cavaliers (2016), and the Los Angeles Lakers (2020). In 2023 he became the NBA’s all-time leading scorer, breaking the record (38,387) previously held by Kareem Abdul-Jabbar. His dominance continued when in 2024, he recorded his 40,000 point scored. Find out where he ranks in our list of the greatest basketball players. A locally known basketball prodigy since elementary school, James was named Ohio’s Mr. Basketball (high-school player of the year) three times while leading Akron’s St. Vincent–St. Mary High School to three Ohio state championships in his four years on the team. He became a national media sensation in his junior year after appearing on the cover of Sports Illustrated, where he was billed by the magazine as “The Chosen One.” James was the consensus national high-school player of the year in his senior season, and he was selected by the Cleveland Cavaliers with the first overall selection of the 2003 NBA draft. Additionally, he signed an unprecedented $90 million endorsement contract with the Nike shoe company before he ever played a professional game. Despite the pressures brought on by these singular circumstances, James led the Cavaliers in scoring, steals, and minutes played over the course of the 2003–04 season, winning the league’s Rookie of the Year award in the process. A 6-foot 9-inch (2.06-meter) “point forward” who was as adept at bringing the ball down the court as at playing near the basket, James presented a unique challenge for opposing teams; his unmatched athleticism and well-muscled body would not have been out of place in the National Football League. His game progressed over the following years. He was voted one of the starting forwards on the Eastern Conference All-Star team during his second season, and in his third season he led the Cavaliers to their first playoff berth in nine years. These accomplishments were exceeded during the 2006–07 season, when James guided Cleveland to the franchise’s first berth in the NBA finals. After the Cavaliers upset the favored Detroit Pistons in the Eastern Conference finals, the Cavaliers were swept by the San Antonio Spurs in the NBA finals, but James’s impressive postseason play led many observers to place him among the very best players in the league. He led the NBA in scoring during the 2007–08 season and earned first team All-NBA honors, but the Cavaliers lost to the eventual champion Boston Celtics in a dramatic seven-game series in the Eastern Conference semifinals. James piloted the Cavaliers to a team-record 66 wins during the 2008–09 season, which helped to earn him the league’s Most Valuable Player (MVP) award. The following season James averaged nearly 30 points per game as he was again named MVP. At the end of the 2009–10 season, James became arguably the most sought-after free agent in NBA history when his contract with the Cavaliers expired, and he began a prolonged courtship process with a number of teams that had in some cases been planning for his free agency for over two years. In an unprecedented hour-long television special, criticized by many for its undue grandiosity, James announced that he was signing with the Heat. He helped Miami reach the NBA finals in his first year with the team, but the Heat lost the championship to the Dallas Mavericks. In the 2011–12 season James averaged 27.1 points per game and won his third MVP award while helping Miami advance to its second consecutive NBA finals appearance. Backed by his stellar play—James was named the finals MVP—the Heat defeated the Oklahoma City Thunder to win the championship. He had arguably his greatest individual season in 2012–13, as he averaged 26.8 points, 7.3 assists, and a career-high 8.0 rebounds per game while posting a .565 field-goal percentage, a remarkable rate of made shots for someone who so frequently played away from the basket. James also helped Miami win 27 consecutive games that season (the second longest such streak in NBA history), and he was rewarded with his fourth league MVP award. In the following postseason, the Heat defeated the San Antonio Spurs in a seven-game series to win the NBA championship, and James was again named the finals MVP. He continued his stellar play in the following season, even increasing his shooting percentage by .002, and he again led the Heat to an appearance in the NBA finals. However, Miami lost that rematch with the Spurs in a five-game series. After that finals loss, James opted out of his contract with the Heat, leaving an aging Miami roster, and—after a week of frenzied speculation among fans and media—he decided to return to Cleveland. Although his 25.3 points per game was James’s lowest scoring average since his rookie season, he nevertheless guided a young and inexperienced Cavaliers roster to the second best record in the Eastern Conference in 2014–15. In the following postseason he led an injury-laden Cleveland team to just two playoff losses en route to a berth in the NBA finals. There James had one of the greatest individual performances in finals history, averaging 35.8 points, 13.3 rebounds, and 8.8 assists per game while leading the undermanned Cavaliers to the franchise’s first two finals victories before ultimately losing a six-game series to the Golden State Warriors. James had another strong regular season in 2015–16 but, once again, truly shined in the playoffs. He led the Cavaliers to a rematch against the Warriors, who had set a league record with 73 wins during the regular season, in the NBA finals. There the Cavaliers became the first team to come back from a 3–1 finals deficit to capture the first title in franchise history and end a 52-year title drought for Cleveland professional sports teams. James averaged 29.7 points, 11.3 rebounds, 8.9 assists, 2.6 steals, and 2.3 blocks per game in the finals—becoming the first person to lead all five statistical categories for players on both teams in the finals—and was unanimously named finals MVP. In 2016–17 James had arguably his best regular season by setting career highs with averages of 8.7 assists and 8.6 rebounds per game while still scoring 26.4 points per game. He sustained his excellence in the Eastern Conference playoffs, scoring 32.5 points per game (which included his 5,988th career postseason point, breaking Michael Jordan’s all-time NBA playoff scoring record) while leading the Cavaliers to a third consecutive match-up against the Warriors in the NBA finals. There Cleveland could not overcome the team James referred to as a “juggernaut,” losing to the Warriors in five games despite James becoming the first player in NBA history to average a triple-double over the course of the finals (with 33.6 points, 12 rebounds, and 10 assists per game). In 2017–18 he played a full 82-game regular season for the first time in his career and led the NBA in minutes played per game (36.9) while averaging 27.5 points, 8.6 rebounds, and a new career-high 9.1 assists per game. James again excelled in the following playoffs, scoring more than 40 points seven times in the team’s 18 Eastern Conference postseason games (which included two seven-game series) to lead the Cavaliers to their fourth straight NBA finals series against the Warriors. He continued his strong individual play in the finals, but it was not enough to overcome Golden State’s overwhelming talent advantage, and the Warriors swept the series. In the following off-season, James, a free agent, joined the Los Angeles Lakers. He continued to play at a high level, averaging 27.4 points, 8.5 rebounds, and 8.3 assists per game, but he missed significant playing time because of an injury (a strained groin) for the first time in his career. The Lakers struggled in his absence and ultimately finished the 2018–19 season with a 37–45 record, ending James’s personal playoff streak at 13 seasons. The following season was disrupted by the COVID-19 pandemic, which caused a four-month suspension. Play resumed in July 2020 with a shortened schedule, and the Lakers ultimately defeated the Miami Heat to claim the franchise’s 17th NBA title. James’s dominating performance—he averaged 29.8 points, 11.8 rebounds, and 8.5 assists per game—earned him his fourth finals MVP award. In addition to his achievements in the NBA, James was a member of the U.S. men’s Olympic basketball teams that won the bronze medal at the 2004 Games, the gold medal at the 2008 Games, and the gold at the 2012 Games. James did not return to Olympic competition until the 2024 Paris Games, and there he led the U.S. team to a fifth consecutive gold medal and was named the tournament’s MVP. Off the court, James occasionally acted, notably appearing as himself in Judd Apatow’s comedy Trainwreck (2015). In 2021 he appeared in the live-action/animated Space Jam: A New Legacy. James also published a memoir, Shooting Stars (2009; cowritten with Buzz Bissinger), that chronicles his years as a high-school standout.",

James earned an additional honor at the Games: leading the U.S. delegation as the male flag bearer in the opening ceremony along the Seine River on July 26. “It’s special to get an opportunity to represent your country in another fashion. I understand how prestigious this moment is,” James said. Joining him as the female flag bearer is tennis player Coco Gauff. Basketball player LeBron James is the NBA’s all-time leading scorer who currently plays for the Los Angeles Lakers. James first garnered national attention as the top high school basketball player in the country before being drafted by the Cleveland Cavaliers in 2003. With his unique combination of size, athleticism, and court vision, he became a four-time NBA MVP. After leading the Miami Heat to titles in 2012 and 2013, James returned to the Cavaliers and helped the franchise claim its first championship in 2016. Since joining Los Angeles in 2018, he has won an additional NBA championship and became the all-time leading scorer in league history. FULL NAME: LeBron Raymone JamesBORN: December 30, 1984BIRTHPLACE: Akron, OhioSPOUSE: Savannah James (2013-present)CHILDREN: LeBron Jr., Bryce, and ZhuriASTROLOGICAL SIGN: Capricorn LeBron Raymone James was born on December 30, 1984, in Akron, Ohio. At an early age, he showed a natural talent for basketball. James was recruited by St. Vincent-St. Mary High School to join their basketball team in 1999. As a freshman, James averaged 18 points per game. He helped the team to a Division III state title by scoring 25 points in the championship game. Word of his advanced basketball skills spread, and James received several honors for his performance. As a high school sophomore, James was chosen for the USA Today All-USA First Team. He was the first sophomore ever selected for this award. His team also won the Division III state title for the second year in a row. The following school year, James was named Parade magazine’s High School Boys Basketball Player of the Year and Gatorade Player of the Year. Following the end of his junior year, James was such a strong player that he contemplated going pro. Deciding to finish his education, James had a tremendous senior year on the court. He averaged 31.6 points per game, helping his team clinch their third state title. The St. Vincent-St. Mary High School team also earned the top national ranking that year. Throughout his high school playing career, James totaled 2,657 points, 892 rebounds, and 523 assists. He would soon emerged as one of the NBA’s leading players. With his impressive record, it was no surprise that James was the first player picked in the 2003 NBA Draft straight out of high school. The Cleveland Cavaliers signed the powerful young forward, and he proved to be a valuable addition to the then-struggling franchise. The team had ended the previous season in eighth place in the Eastern Conference. During the 2003-04 season, James made history when he became the first member of the Cavalier franchise to win the NBA Rookie of the Year Award. At only 20 years old, he also became the youngest player to receive this honor. Additionally, James averaged 20 points per game at this time and became one of only three rookies to accomplish this feat, putting him in the same company as Michael Jordan and Oscar Robertson. James continued to excel professionally in the NBA the following season, upping his average points per game to 27.2. He made NBA history again in 2005 when he became the youngest player to score more than 50 points in one game. In 2006, James helped the Cleveland Cavaliers defeat the Washington Wizards in the first round of playoff action. From there, his team took on the Detroit Pistons in the Eastern Conference semifinals. James scored an average of 26.6 per game in this postseason matchup, but it wasn’t enough to secure victory. While the Cavaliers weren’t at the top of the rankings, James continued to receive special recognition for his individual abilities. Also that year, James reached a new contract agreement with the Cavaliers. The team proved to be stronger competitors the following season, defeating Detroit to win the Eastern Conference. In the NBA Finals against the San Antonio Spurs, however, the Cavaliers lost their championship bid in four consecutive games. During the 2007-08 season, James continued to help the Cavaliers improve their standing in the Eastern Conference. The team made it to the semifinals, where they were defeated by the Boston Celtics in seven games. In terms of individual performance, James had a stellar year, outperforming such rival players as Kobe Bryant and Allen Iverson, by scoring an average of 30 points per game, the highest average in the NBA regular season. Early in the 2008-09 season, sports journalists and fans began talking about James’ future in the sport. He had the option to become a free agent in 2010, and there was much discussion as to where James would end up. Some journalists identified the New York Knicks as a potential suitor for the rising player. James made several references to his impending free-agent status, but he was sure to downplay the matter. “I am focused on the team that I am on right now and winning a championship... I don’t think about making a change at this point,” James told reporters. Shortly after becoming a free agent, James announced that he would be joining the Miami Heat for the 2010-11 season. His fans in Cleveland were less than pleased, and many considered his departure a betrayal to his hometown. Soon after James’ announcement, Cleveland Cavaliers majority owner Dan Gilbert wrote an open letter declaring James’ decision as “selfish,” “heartless” and a “cowardly betrayal.” Unfazed, James finished second in the league during his first season with the Heat, scoring 26.7 points per game. The 2011-12 season saw major success for James and the Miami Heat. With his team’s victory over the Oklahoma City Thunder in the NBA Finals, the superstar forward finally earned his first title. In the clinching Game 5, James scored 26 points and had 11 rebounds and 13 assists. “I made a difficult decision to leave Cleveland, but I understood what my future was about,” James told Fox Sports following the game. “I knew we had a bright future [in Miami].” During the 2012-13 season, James made NBA history yet again: On January 16, 2013, at age 28, he became the youngest player to score 20,000 points, succeeding Kobe Bryant of the Los Angeles Lakers—who accomplished this feat when he was 29—and becoming only the 38th player in NBA history to achieve this distinction. James made a jump shot the final seconds of the game, bringing his scoring total 20,001 and leading the Heat to a 92-75 victory over the Golden State Warriors. Success followed the Heat to the end of the 2012-13 season: Following a hard-fought, six-game series against the Indiana Pacers to win the Eastern Conference, Miami outlasted the San Antonio Spurs in seven games to win its second consecutive NBA championship. At the culmination of the 2013-14 season, Miami returned to the NBA Finals to face off against the Spurs again, this time losing to San Antonio after five games. In July 2014, after opting out of his contract with the Heat and considering other teams, James announced that he was returning to the Cavaliers. Hampered by back and knee problems, James missed 13 of 82 regular-season games in 2014-15. However, he was as dominant as ever when healthy, averaging 25.3 points and 7.4 assists per game. James led the Cavaliers to the NBA Finals, becoming the first player in nearly 50 years to reach the championship round in five consecutive seasons. However, injuries to star teammates Kevin Love and Kyrie Irving damaged his hopes of claiming a third title, and the Cavaliers lost to the Golden State Warriors in six games. Over the course of 2015-16, the Cavs overcame the distraction of a mid-season coaching change and breezed through the playoffs to earn a rematch with the Warriors, marking the sixth straight NBA Finals appearance for “King James.” In perhaps the crowning achievement of his career, he led his team back from a 3-1 deficit, scoring 41 points in both Games 5 and 6, before recording a triple-double in Game 7 to give the Cavs their first championship in franchise history. Voted Finals MVP, James said: “I came back to bring a championship to our city. I knew what I was capable of doing. I knew what I learned in the last couple years that I was gone, and I knew if I had to—when I came back—I knew I had the right ingredients and the right blueprint to help this franchise get back to a place that we’ve never been. That’s what it was all about.” The following year, James again paced himself and took charge when necessary, driving the Cavs through the Eastern Conference to make an incredible seventh consecutive appearance in the NBA Finals. This time, with former MVP Kevin Durant added to the mix, the Warriors proved too formidable for James and his teammates, who lost the championship in five games. For all his accomplishments, James achieved another first early in the 2017-18 NBA season: After yelling at a referee during a late November win over the Heat, he was ejected for the first time in 1,082 career games. The superstar likely felt like yelling often during the course of a frustrating campaign, as an offseason trade that sent Irving to Boston for Isaiah Thomas failed to bear fruit and forced the Cavs to make another major deal before the All-Star break. After averaging a career-best 9.1 assists in the regular season, James had to dig deep just to get the team out of the first round of the playoffs, delivering a brilliant 45-point effort to sink the Pacers in Game 7. The Cavs were again pushed to the limit two rounds later by the scrappy Boston Celtics, but James scored 81 points over the last two games to pull out the series win and make his eighth straight NBA Finals appearance. Game 1 of the rematch against Golden State went down to the wire, thanks to James’ 51-point outburst, but Cleveland guard J.R. Smith inexplicably dribbled out the clock with the game tied in regulation before the Warriors pulled away for the win in overtime. That represented the Cavs’ best chance to get a leg up on their opponents, as the Warriors won the next three games handily to claim their third title in four years. Afterward, with questions swirling about his future with the team, James revealed that he had played out the series with a broken right hand after punching a whiteboard in the aftermath of the Game 1 loss. On July 1, 2018, James announced that he was moving on to the next chapter of his career by signing a four-year, $153.3 million contract with the Los Angeles Lakers, a storied franchise that counted Kobe Bryant, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, and Magic Johnson among its all-time greats. The good vibes had worn off by midseason, as the Lakers sputtered through a 17-game stretch without their injured star. With the team still struggling in late February 2019, James accused his teammates of losing focus over trade rumors, saying, “If you’re still allowing distractions to affect the way you play, this is the wrong franchise to be a part of and you should just come in and be like, ‘Listen, I can’t do this.’” When the Lakers were officially eliminated from playoff contention in March 2019, it snapped James’ personal marks of 13 consecutive postseasons and eight straight NBA Finals appearances. Capping a difficult first season in Los Angeles, the Lakers announced that their star would miss the final six games because of his lingering groin injury. Things got off to a much better start the following season, thanks in large part to the addition of athletic big man Anthony Davis to the roster. Spearheading the Lakers’ rise to the top of the standings was James, who became the first player to record a triple-double against all 30 NBA teams in November 2019. The following month, James added another accolade to his ever-growing list by earning AP Male Athlete of the Decade honors. James won his fourth championship in 2020, when the Lakers defeated the Miami Heat in a special playoff tournament held at the Walt Disney World resort following the outset of the COVID-19 pandemic. James was selected for the NBA All-Star Game for the first time in 2005 and has earned a spot in the annual showcase in each of the next 19 seasons—an NBA record streak. In January 2018, the league announced James and Golden State Warriors guard Stephen Curry had topped the ballots and would serve as captains for that year’s All-Star Game. In 2006, James was named MVP in the NBA All-Star Game, a feat he repeated in 2008 and 2018. James has also been named NBA MVP in four seasons: 2008-09, 2009-10, 2011-12, and 2012-13. In January 2018, at age 33, James surpassed Kobe Bryant as the youngest player to accumulate 30,000 career points and became the seventh player in NBA history to achieve that milestone. The feat put him just more than 8,000 points shy of Kareem Abdul-Jabbar’s all-time record of 38,387 points. James continued to surpass other legends in ensuing seasons, topping Michael Jordan’s career tally of 32,292 points in 2019 to move into fourth place all-time. In January 2020, he eclipsed Bryant’s total of 33,643 points to move into third place, one night before his predecessor’s shocking death in a helicopter accident. Then, on February 7, 2023, James scored 38 points in a loss to the Oklahoma City Thunder—setting the all-time mark with Abdul-Jabbar sitting courtside. “I didn’t set this as a goal, so that’s probably why it’s so surreal and so weird to me,” James said. “I never talked about being the all-time scorer in NBA history… until my numbers started getting closer and closer, and I was like, ‘Oh wow, this is crazy. This is weird, but I guess I’m doing it.’” As of July 2024, James is also fourth in league history in assists (11,009) and eighth in steals (2,275). After 21 NBA seasons, James’ stats include regular season per-game averages of: James has competed on the U.S. Olympic basketball team during four Summer Olympic Games: in 2004, 2008, 2012, and 2024. He made his Olympic debut at the 2004 Summer Games in Athens, Greece. He and his teammates won bronze medals after defeating Lithuania. Argentina took home the gold after beating Italy in the finals. In the summer of 2008, James traveled to Beijing to play with the likes of Kobe Bryant, Jason Kidd, and Dwyane Wade on Team USA. This time around the Americans brought home the gold after defeating Spain in the final round. James competed at his third Olympic Games in 2012, at the Summer Olympics in London, along with Kevin Durant, Bryant, Carmelo Anthony, and several other top players. The U.S. basketball team took the gold medal again, marking James’ second consecutive Olympic gold. After sitting out the 2016 and 2020 Games, James is competing for his third gold medal at the Paris Olympics this year. He was also selected to serve as the male flag bearer for the entire U.S. delegation at the opening ceremony. As of July 2024, Celebrity Net Worth estimates James’ total fortune at around $800 million. According to ESPN, he is currently the sixth-highest paid player in the NBA, earning just under $50 million for the upcoming season. James’ fortune largely stems from his playing salary and a series of lucrative endorsements. The NBA superstar previously signed a four-year, $153.3 million contract with the Lakers in July 2018. Off the court, James has inked several partnerships since turning pro, including a deal with Nike for $90 million that could net him over $1 billion over his lifetime. Some of his other endorsements have included Intel, Verizon, Coca-Cola, Beats by Dre, and Kia Motors. James is also an investor in Blaze Pizza. On January 1, 2012, James proposed to his high school sweetheart, Savannah Brinson. The couple married in a private ceremony with about 200 guests in San Diego on September 14, 2013. LeBron and Savannah have two sons and one daughter together. In October 2004, they welcomed their first son, LeBron Jr., nicknamed “Bronny.” On June 14, 2007, Savannah gave birth to their second son, Bryce. Their daughter, Zhuri, was born on October 22, 2014. Like his father, Bronny became a basketball phenom as a teenager and one of the most sought-after recruits in the country while attending the Sierra Canyon School. He played collegiately at the University of Southern California during the 2023-24 season before entering the NBA draft. The Lakers selected Bronny with the 55th overall pick, pairing him with his father in Los Angeles. “I’m going to hold him accountable, and he should hold me accountable when I do things not right. I can separate dad from teammate,” LeBron told Today. “And, I think, as he continues to grow, and as he continues to learn, I hope he’s able to separate son from teammate, as well.” Outside of the NBA, James has worked to help others. He established the LeBron James Family Foundation in 2004, along with his mother, Gloria, to help out children and single-parent families in need. Among its many programs, the organization builds playgrounds in economically disadvantaged areas and hosts an annual bike-a-thon. One of the world’s most recognizable athletes, James hasn’t been shy about expressing his views on social media. Among other issues, he displayed his support for Trayvon Martin after the teen’s death in 2012, and he has clashed with President Donald Trump. James waded into delicate territory in October 2019, after Houston Rockets GM Daryl Morey posted a tweet in support of Hong Kong’s pro-democracy protesters that ignited a Chinese media boycott of NBA preseason games in the country. James said he believed Morey was “misinformed” about the situation, though he later tweeted that he mainly took issue with the executive posting comments that could have exposed traveling players to danger. The basketball superstar has also shown a playful side on social media, such as when he posted a picture of cartoon character Arthur clenching his first during the Cavaliers’ slow start to the 2017-18 season. Like many pro athletes before him, James parlayed his popularity into opportunities on the big and small screen. On television, James has had guest roles on the popular cartoons The Simpsons (2005), SpongeBob SquarePants (2009), and The Cleveland Show (2011), and appeared as himself on the HBO drama Entourage in 2009. James made his major movie with a supporting role in 2015’s Trainwreck, a comedy starring Amy Schumer and Bill Hader. He later starred in Space Jam 2, the 2021 sequel to the hit 1996 live-action and cartoon hybrid starring Michael Jordan. “The Space Jam collaboration is so much more than just me and the Looney Tunes getting together and doing this movie,” James told The Hollywood Reporter. “It’s so much bigger. I’d just love for kids to understand how empowered they can feel and how empowered they can be if they don’t just give up on their dreams.” In 2020, the basketball great co-founded a production company called SpringHill Entertainment.

                "content": "If not listed, please contact your TV provider. In the final game of Week 17, the San Francisco 49ers will play host to the Detroit Lions on \"Monday Night Football.\" San Francisco has been eliminated from the playoffs, but still has a chance to at least leave an impression on the Lions that they still hold an edge in the matchup. The Niners knocked the Lions out in last year's NFL title game, and being able to capture another win on Monday night could be a reminder heading into next year that they're still a force to be reckoned with in the conference. Detroit, meanwhile, can maintain its hold on first place in both the NFC North and the conference as a whole by winning this matchup. The ultimate determination of those spots will come down to the big showdown with the Vikings next Sunday night, but there is still the revenge factor motivation, plus a potential narrower path to the NFC's top seed that could point toward the Lions being more interested in going all out for this game than it might appear on the surface. Will the Lions get their revenge, or will the Niners capture another victory? We'll find out soon enough. Before we break down the matchup, here's a look at how you can watch the game. Date: Monday, Dec. 30 | Time: 8:15 p.m. ETLocation: Levi's Stadium (Santa Clara, California)TV: ABC | Stream: fubo (try for free)Follow: CBS Sports App Betting odds: Lions -3.5, O/U 50.5 (via Caesars Sportsbook) As we have all seen throughout this season, Detroit's offense is essentially a machine that grinds through any wrench that might get stuck in its gears. Despite having played fewer games than all but one other team, Detroit comes into this game ranked second in the NFL in yards and first in points. The Lions are first in points per drive, first in the share of drives ending in a touchdown or field goal and first in offensive success rate, via Tru Media. They can do anything. They're second in EPA per pass and fifth in EPA per rush, second in passing success rate (by a mere 0.2%) and third in rushing success rate (by 0.1%). The 49ers enter this game banged up on defense, with Javon Hargrave and Kevin Givens still on injured reserve, Drake Jackson still on PUP, De'Vondre Campbell still suspended and Dre Greenlaw listed as out after returning just two weeks ago. Their best defensive lineman, Nick Bosa, will spend the game rushing against arguably the NFL's best tackle duo in Penei Sewell and Taylor Decker. Their best overall defender, Fred Warner, will be tested as much as he has been all year, as nobody attacks the middle of the field better than the Lions. Detroit is still without David Montgomery, but we have seen what Jahmyr Gibbs is capable of when Montgomery is out. It's not fun for defenses to chase that guy around all game. Throw in his sheer explosiveness with the consistent reliability of Amon-Ra St. Brown, the threats posed by Sam LaPorta and the other complementary passing-game options and Ben Johnson scheming up some of the wildest stuff imaginable, and it's hard to see how anybody ever stops this unit -- let alone a Niners defense that is not operating near peak condition. Of course, we may not see the Lions operating at peak condition, either. This game isn't quite meaningless for the Lions -- a win over San Francisco opens up the possibility of a Week 18 tie against the Vikings also landing Detroit the NFC North title and home-field advantage throughout the playoffs. But the season will come down to that game either way, and it's easy to justify not necessarily throwing every single thing you've got into this one. Then again, the Lions are coached by Dan Campbell. And they've been very intentional about \"revenge games\" this season, from blasting Dallas to making sure Montgomery had a huge day in the first game against the Bears. So, it's also pretty easy to envision them coming out and trying to lay the wood on the team that defeated them in last year's NFC title game. The San Francisco offense is another unit that has not been operating near its peak this year. Christian McCaffrey has missed almost the entire season. The same is true of Brandon Aiyuk. George Kittle missed a few games. Jauan Jennings missed a few. Trent Williams has missed a bunch and won't play this week or next. Even the backup running backs who have excelled in McCaffrey's place -- Elijah Mitchell, Jordan Mason, Isaac Guerendo -- have missed a game or much more. Deebo Samuel may as well have been absent for much of the year, given his level of contribution up until last week. That would be more concerning if they were facing a defense other than this Lions group, which may be the only playoff-caliber unit in the league that has dealt with more injury issues than the Niners offense. Alex Anzalone, Marcus Davenport, John Cominsky, Derrick Barnes, Khalil Dorsey, Malcom Rodriguez, Ennis Rakestraw Jr., Carlton Davis, Aidan Hutchinson, Alim McNeill and Kyle Peko are all on injured reserve. Jalen Reeves-Maybin has been designated to return but has not yet gotten back on the field. The only expected starters left on the field are DJ Reader, Jack Campbell, Terrion Arnold, Kerby Joseph and Brian Branch. That is insane. San Francisco should be able to get some things going offensively on Monday night, provided the offensive line can hold its own. Brock Purdy has generally been more aggressive this year than in years past; Kittle, Jennings and Samuel are available and healthy, and Guerendo should be back. Given the condition of the Lions defense, there will be openings for all of them to make plays. The question is whether they can make enough plays to keep up with the Lions ... and that's hard to envision. Detroit is going on the road and playing against the team that ended its playoff run a year ago. If we know anything about Dan Campbell teams, it's that they want to win that type of game perhaps even more than any other. And the Lions offense is just too efficient, they'll be too explosive to keep down. Pick: Lions 33, 49ers 23 © 2004-2024 CBS Interactive. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.

                "content": "James Earl Carter Jr. (October 1, 1924 – December 29, 2024) was an American politician who served as the 39th president of the United States from 1977 to 1981. A member of the Democratic Party, Carter previously served from 1963 to 1967 in the Georgia State Senate and from 1971 to 1975 as the 76th governor of Georgia. He was the longest-lived president in U.S. history and the first to live to 100 years. Born and raised in Plains, Georgia, Carter graduated from the U.S. Naval Academy in 1946 and joined the U.S. Navy's submarine service. He returned home after his military service and revived his family's peanut-growing business. Opposing racial segregation, Carter supported the growing civil rights movement, and became an activist within the Democratic Party. Carter served in the Georgia State Senate from 1963 to 1967 and then as Governor of Georgia from 1971 to 1975. As a dark-horse candidate not well known outside Georgia, he won the Democratic nomination and narrowly defeated the incumbent president, Gerald Ford of the Republican Party, in the 1976 presidential election. Carter pardoned all Vietnam War draft evaders on his second day in office. He created a national energy policy that included conservation, price control, and new technology. Carter successfully pursued the Camp David Accords, the Panama Canal Treaties, and the second round of Strategic Arms Limitation Talks. He also confronted stagflation. His administration established the U.S. Department of Energy and the Department of Education. He was the only president to serve a full term without appointing a justice to the Supreme Court. The end of his presidency was marked by the Iran hostage crisis, an energy crisis, the Three Mile Island accident, the Nicaraguan Revolution, and the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan. In response to the invasion, Carter escalated the Cold War by ending détente, imposing a grain embargo against the Soviets, enunciating the Carter Doctrine, and leading the multinational boycott of the 1980 Summer Olympics in Moscow. Carter defeated challenger Ted Kennedy in the 1980 Democratic Party presidential primaries but lost the general election in a landslide to Ronald Reagan, the Republican nominee. After leaving the presidency, Carter established the Carter Center to promote and expand human rights, and received a Nobel Peace Prize in 2002 for his work in relation to it. He traveled extensively to conduct peace negotiations, monitor elections, and further the eradication of infectious diseases. Carter was a key figure in the nonprofit housing organization Habitat for Humanity. He also wrote numerous books, ranging from political memoirs to poetry, while continuing to comment on global affairs, including two books on the Israeli–Palestinian conflict. Polls of historians and political scientists generally rank Carter as a below-average president. Scholars and the public more favorably view his post-presidency, which was the longest in U.S. history. James Earl Carter Jr. was born October 1, 1924, in Plains, Georgia, at the Wise Sanitarium, where his mother worked as a registered nurse.[1] Carter thus became the first American president born in a hospital.[2] He was the eldest child of Bessie Lillian Gordy and James Earl Carter Sr., and a descendant of English immigrant Thomas Carter, who settled in the Colony of Virginia in 1635.[3][4] In Georgia, numerous generations of Carters worked as cotton farmers.[5] Plains was a boomtown of 600 people at the time of Carter's birth. His father was a successful local businessman who ran a general store and was an investor in farmland.[6] Carter's father had previously served as a reserve second lieutenant in the U.S. Army Quartermaster Corps during World War I.[6] During Carter's infancy, his family moved several times, settling on a dirt road in nearby Archery, which was almost entirely populated by impoverished African American families.[2][7] His family eventually had three more children, Gloria, Ruth, and Billy.[8] Carter got along well with his parents, even though his mother was often absent during his childhood, since she worked long hours, and although his father was staunchly pro-segregation, he allowed Jimmy to befriend the black farmhands' children.[9] Carter was an enterprising teenager who was given his own acre of Earl's farmland, where he grew, packaged, and sold peanuts.[10] Carter also rented out a section of tenant housing that he had purchased.[2] Carter attended Plains High School from 1937 to 1941, graduating from the eleventh grade, since the school did not have a twelfth grade.[11] By that time, Archery and Plains had been impoverished by the Great Depression, but the family benefited from New Deal farming subsidies, and Carter's father took a position as a community leader.[10][12] Carter was a diligent student with a fondness for reading.[13] A popular anecdote holds that he was passed over for valedictorian after he and his friends skipped school to venture downtown in a hot rod. Carter's truancy was mentioned in a local newspaper, although it is not clear he would have otherwise been valedictorian.[14] As an adolescent, Carter played on the Plains High School basketball team, and also joined Future Farmers of America, which helped him develop a lifelong interest in woodworking.[14] Carter had long dreamed of attending the United States Naval Academy.[10] In 1941, he started undergraduate coursework in engineering at Georgia Southwestern College in nearby Americus, Georgia.[15] The next year, Carter transferred to the Georgia Institute of Technology in Atlanta, where civil rights icon Blake Van Leer was president.[16] While at Georgia Tech, Carter took part in the Reserve Officers' Training Corps.[17] In 1943, he received an appointment to the Naval Academy from U.S. Representative Stephen Pace, and Carter graduated with a Bachelor of Science in 1946.[18][17] He was a good student, but was seen as reserved and quiet, in contrast to the academy's culture of aggressive hazing of freshmen.[19] While at the Academy, Carter fell in love with Rosalynn Smith, a friend of his sister Ruth.[20] The two wed shortly after his graduation in 1946, and were married until her death on November 19, 2023.[21][22] Carter was a sprint football player for the Navy Midshipmen.[23] He graduated 60th out of 821 midshipmen in the class of 1947[a] with a Bachelor of Science degree and was commissioned as an ensign.[25] From 1946 to 1953, the Carters lived in Virginia, Hawaii, Connecticut, New York, and California, during his deployments in the Atlantic and Pacific fleets.[26] In 1948, he began officer training for submarine duty and served aboard USS Pomfret.[27] Carter was promoted to lieutenant junior grade in 1949, and his service aboard Pomfret included a simulated war patrol to the western Pacific and Chinese coast from January to March of that year.[28] In 1951, Carter was assigned to the diesel/electric USS K-1 (SSK-1), qualified for command, and served in several positions, to include executive officer.[29] In 1952, Carter began an association with the Navy's fledgling nuclear submarine program, led by then-Captain Hyman G. Rickover.[30] Rickover had high standards and demands for his men and machines, and Carter later said that, next to his parents, Rickover had the greatest influence on his life.[31] Carter was sent to the Naval Reactors Branch of the Atomic Energy Commission in Washington, D.C., for three-month temporary duty, while Rosalynn moved with their children to Schenectady, New York.[32] On December 12, 1952, an accident with the experimental NRX reactor at Atomic Energy of Canada's Chalk River Laboratories caused a partial meltdown, resulting in millions of liters of radioactive water flooding the reactor building's basement. This left the reactor's core ruined.[33] Carter was ordered to Chalk River to lead a U.S. maintenance crew that joined other American and Canadian service personnel to assist in the shutdown of the reactor.[34] The painstaking process required each team member to don protective gear and be lowered individually into the reactor for 90 seconds at a time, limiting their exposure to radioactivity while they disassembled the crippled reactor. When Carter was lowered in, his job was simply to turn a single screw.[35] During and after his presidency, Carter said that his experience at Chalk River had shaped his views on atomic energy and led him to cease the development of a neutron bomb.[36] In March 1953, Carter began a six-month course in nuclear power plant operation at Union College in Schenectady.[26] His intent was to eventually work aboard USS Seawolf, which was intended to be the second U.S. nuclear submarine.[37] His plans changed when his father died of pancreatic cancer in July, two months before construction of Seawolf began, and Carter obtained a release from active duty so he could take over the family peanut business.[38][39] Deciding to leave Schenectady proved difficult, as Rosalynn had grown comfortable with their life there.[40][41] She later said that returning to small-town life in Plains seemed \"a monumental step backward.\"[42] Carter left active duty on October 9, 1953.[43][44] He served in the inactive Navy Reserve until 1961 and left the service with the rank of lieutenant.[45] Carter's awards include the American Campaign Medal, World War II Victory Medal, China Service Medal, and National Defense Service Medal.[46] As a submarine officer, he also earned the \"dolphin\" badge.[47] After debt settlements and division of his father's estate among its heirs, Jimmy inherited comparatively little.[48] For a year, he, Rosalynn, and their three sons lived in public housing in Plains.[b] Carter was knowledgeable in scientific and technological subjects, and he set out to expand the family's peanut-growing business.[50] Transitioning from the Navy to farming was difficult as his first-year harvest failed due to a drought, and Carter had to open several bank lines of credit to keep the farm afloat.[51] Meanwhile, he took classes and studied agriculture while Rosalynn learned accounting to manage the business's books.[52] Though they barely broke even the first year, the Carters grew the business and became quite successful.[49][52] As racial tension inflamed in Plains by the 1954 Supreme Court of the United States ruling in Brown v. Board of Education,[53] Carter favored racial tolerance and integration but often kept those feelings to himself to avoid making enemies. By 1961, Carter began to speak more prominently of integration as a member of the Baptist Church and chairman of the Sumter County school board.[54][55] In 1962, he announced his campaign for an open Georgia State Senate seat 15 days before the election.[56] Rosalynn, who had an instinct for politics and organization, was instrumental to his campaign. While early counting of the ballots showed Carter trailing his opponent, Homer Moore, this was later proven to be the result of fraudulent voting. The fraud was found to have been orchestrated by Joe Hurst, the chairman of the Democratic Party in Quitman County.[56] Carter challenged the election result, which was confirmed fraudulent in an investigation. Following this, another election was held, in which Carter won against Moore as the sole Democratic candidate, with a vote margin of 3,013 to 2,182.[57] The civil rights movement was well underway when Carter took office. He and his family had become staunch John F. Kennedy supporters. Carter remained relatively quiet on the issue at first, even as it polarized much of the county, to avoid alienating his segregationist colleagues. Carter did speak up on a few divisive issues, giving speeches against literacy tests and against an amendment to the Georgia Constitution that he felt implied a compulsion to practice religion.[58] Carter entered the state Democratic Executive Committee two years into office, where he helped rewrite the state party's rules. He became the chairman of the West Central Georgia Planning and Development Commission, which oversaw the disbursement of federal and state grants for projects such as historic site restoration.[59] When Bo Callaway was elected to the United States House of Representatives in 1964, Carter immediately began planning to challenge him. The two had previously clashed over which two-year college would be expanded to a four-year college program by the state, and Carter saw Callaway—who had switched to the Republican Party—as a rival who represented aspects of politics he despised.[60] Carter was reelected to a second two-year term in the state Senate,[61] where he chaired its Education Committee and sat on the Appropriations Committee toward the end of the term. He contributed to a bill expanding statewide education funding and getting Georgia Southwestern State University a four-year program. He leveraged his regional planning work, giving speeches around the district to make himself more visible to potential voters. On the last day of the term, Carter announced his candidacy for the House of Representatives.[62] Callaway decided to run for governor instead;[63] Carter changed his mind, deciding to run for governor too.[64] In the 1966 gubernatorial election, Carter ran against liberal former governor Ellis Arnall and conservative segregationist Lester Maddox in the Democratic primary. In a press conference, he described his ideology as \"Conservative, moderate, liberal and middle-of-the-road ... I believe I am a more complicated person than that.\"[65] He lost the primary but drew enough votes as a third-place candidate to force Arnall into a runoff election with Maddox, who narrowly defeated Arnall.[66] In the general election, Republican nominee Callaway won a plurality of the vote but less than a majority, allowing the Democratic-majority Georgia House of Representatives to elect Maddox as governor.[66] This resulted in a victorious Maddox, whose victory—due to his segregationist stance—was seen as the worst outcome for the indebted Carter.[66] Carter returned to his agriculture business, carefully planning his next campaign. This period was a spiritual turning point for Carter; he declared himself a born again Christian, and his last child, Amy, was born during this time.[67][68] In the 1970 gubernatorial election, liberal former governor Carl Sanders became Carter's main opponent in the Democratic primary. Carter ran a more modern campaign, employing printed graphics and statistical analysis. Responding to polls, he leaned more conservative than before, positioning himself as a populist and criticizing Sanders for both his wealth and perceived links to the national Democratic Party. He also accused Sanders of corruption, but when pressed by the media, he did not provide evidence.[69][70] Throughout his campaign, Carter sought both the black vote and the votes of those who had supported prominent Alabama segregationist George Wallace. While he met with black figures such as Martin Luther King Sr. and Andrew Young and visited many black-owned businesses, he also praised Wallace and promised to invite him to give a speech in Georgia. Carter's appeal to racism became more blatant over time, with his senior campaign aides handing out a photograph of Sanders celebrating with Black basketball players.[69][70] Carter came ahead of Sanders in the first ballot by 49 percent to 38 percent in September, leading to a runoff election. The subsequent campaign was even more bitter; despite his early support for civil rights, Carter's appeal to racism grew, and he criticized Sanders for supporting Martin Luther King Jr. Carter won the runoff election with 60 percent of the vote and won the general election against Republican nominee Hal Suit. Once elected, Carter changed his tone and began to speak against Georgia's racist politics. Leroy Johnson, a black state senator, voiced his support for Carter: \"I understand why he ran that kind of ultra-conservative campaign. I don't believe you can win this state without being a racist.\"[69] Carter was sworn in as the 76th governor of Georgia on January 12, 1971. In his inaugural speech, he declared that \"the time for racial discrimination is over\",[71] shocking the crowd and causing many of the segregationists who had supported him during the race to feel betrayed. Carter was reluctant to engage with his fellow politicians, making him unpopular with the legislature.[72][73] He expanded the governor's authority by introducing a reorganization plan submitted in January 1972. Despite initially having a cool reception in the legislature, the plan passed at midnight on the last day of the session.[74] Carter merged about 300 state agencies into 22, although it is disputed whether that saved the state money.[75] On July 8, 1971, during an appearance in Columbus, Georgia, he stated his intention to establish a Georgia Human Rights Council to help solve issues ahead of any potential violence.[76] In a news conference on July 13, 1971, Carter announced that he had ordered department heads to reduce spending to prevent a $57 million deficit by the end of the 1972 fiscal year, specifying that each state department would be affected and estimating that 5 percent over government revenue would be lost if state departments continued to fully use allocated funds.[77] On January 13, 1972, he requested that the state legislature fund an early childhood development program along with prison reform programs and $48 million (equivalent to $270 million in 2023) in paid taxes for nearly all state employees.[78] On March 1, 1972, Carter said he might call a special session of the general assembly if the Justice Department opted to turn down any reapportionment plans by either the House or Senate.[79] He pushed several reforms through the legislature, providing equal state aid to schools in Georgia's wealthy and poor areas, setting up community centers for mentally disabled children, and increasing educational programs for convicts. Under this program, all such appointments were based on merit rather than political influence.[80][81] In one of his more controversial decisions, he vetoed a plan to build a dam on Georgia's Flint River, which attracted the attention of environmentalists nationwide.[82][83] Civil rights were a high priority for Carter, who added black state employees and portraits of three prominent black Georgians to the capitol building: Martin Luther King Jr., Lucy Craft Laney, and Henry McNeal Turner. This angered the Ku Klux Klan.[83] He favored a constitutional amendment to ban busing for the purpose of expediting integration in schools on a televised joint appearance with Florida governor Reubin Askew on January 31, 1973,[84] and co-sponsored an anti-busing resolution with Wallace at the 1971 National Governors Conference.[85][86] After the U.S. Supreme Court threw out Georgia's death penalty statute in Furman v. Georgia (1972), Carter signed a revised death-penalty statute that addressed the court's objections, thus reintroducing the practice in the state. He later regretted endorsing the death penalty, saying, \"I didn't see the injustice of it as I do now.\"[87] Ineligible for reelection, Carter looked toward a potential presidential run and engaged in national politics. He was named to several southern planning commissions and was a delegate to the 1972 Democratic National Convention, where liberal U.S. Senator George McGovern was the likely nominee. Carter tried to ingratiate himself with the conservative and anti-McGovern voters. He was fairly obscure at the time, and his attempt at triangulation failed; the 1972 Democratic ticket was McGovern and senator Thomas Eagleton.[88][c] On August 3, Carter met with Wallace in Birmingham, Alabama, to discuss preventing the Democrats from losing in a landslide,[90] but they did.[91] Carter regularly met with his fledgling campaign staff and decided to begin putting a presidential bid for 1976 together. He tried unsuccessfully to become chairman of the National Governors Association to boost his visibility. On David Rockefeller's endorsement, he was named to the Trilateral Commission in April 1973. The next year, he was named chairman of both the Democratic National Committee's congressional and gubernatorial campaigns.[92] In May 1973, Carter warned his party against politicizing the Watergate scandal,[93] which he attributed to president Richard Nixon's isolation from Americans and secretive decision-making.[94] On December 12, 1974, Carter announced his presidential campaign at the National Press Club in Washington, D.C. His speech contained themes of domestic inequality, optimism, and change.[95][96] Upon his entrance in the Democratic primaries, he was competing against sixteen other candidates, and was considered to have little chance against the more nationally known politicians such as Wallace.[97] His name recognition was very low, and his opponents derisively asked \"Jimmy Who?\".[98] In response to this, Carter began to emphasize his name and what he stood for, stating \"My name is Jimmy Carter, and I'm running for president.\"[99] This strategy proved successful. By mid-March 1976, Carter was not only far ahead of the active contenders for the presidential nomination, but led incumbent Republican president Gerald Ford by a few percentage points.[100] As the Watergate scandal was still fresh in the voters' minds, Carter's position as an outsider, distant from Washington, D.C. proved helpful. He promoted government reorganization. In June, Carter published a memoir titled Why Not the Best? to help introduce himself to the American public.[101] Carter became the front-runner early on by winning the Iowa caucuses and the New Hampshire primary. His strategy involved reaching a region before another candidate could extend influence there, traveling over 50,000 miles (80,000 kilometres), visiting 37 states, and delivering over 200 speeches before any other candidate had entered the race.[102] In the South, he tacitly conceded certain areas to Wallace and swept them as a moderate when it became clear Wallace could not win the region. In the North, Carter appealed largely to conservative Christian and rural voters. While he did not achieve a majority in most Northern states, he won several by building the largest singular support base. Although Carter was initially dismissed as a regional candidate, he would clinch the Democratic nomination.[103] In 1980, Lawrence Shoup noted that the national news media discovered and promoted Carter, and stated: What Carter had that his opponents did not was the acceptance and support of elite sectors of the mass communications media. It was their favorable coverage of Carter and his campaign that gave him an edge, propelling him rocket-like to the top of the opinion polls. This helped Carter win key primary election victories, enabling him to rise from an obscure public figure to President-elect in the short space of 9 months.[104] During an interview in April 1976, Carter said, \"I have nothing against a community that is... trying to maintain the ethnic purity of their neighborhoods.\"[105] His remark was intended as supportive of open housing laws, but specifying opposition to government efforts to \"inject black families into a white neighborhood just to create some sort of integration\".[105] Carter's stated positions during his campaign included public financing of congressional campaigns,[106] his support for the creation of a federal consumer protection agency,[107] creating a separate cabinet-level department for education,[108] signing a peace treaty with the Soviet Union to limit nuclear weapons,[109] reducing the defense budget,[110] a tax proposal implementing \"a substantial increase toward those who have the higher incomes\" alongside a levy reduction on taxpayers with lower and middle incomes,[111] making multiple amendments to the Social Security Act,[112] and having a balanced budget by the end of his first term of office.[113] On July 15, 1976, Carter chose U.S. senator Walter Mondale as his running mate.[114] Carter and Ford faced off in three televised debates,[115] the first United States presidential debates since 1960.[115][116] For the November 1976 issue of Playboy, which hit newsstands a couple of weeks before the election, Robert Scheer interviewed Carter. While discussing his religion's view of pride, Carter said: \"I've looked on a lot of women with lust. I've committed adultery in my heart many times.\"[117][118] This response and his admission in another interview that he did not mind if people uttered the word \"fuck\" led to a media feeding frenzy and critics lamenting the erosion of boundary between politicians and their private intimate lives.[119] Carter once had a sizable lead over Ford in national polling, but by late September his lead had narrowed to only several points.[120][121] In the final days before the election, several polls showed that Ford had tied Carter, and one Gallup poll found that he was now slightly ahead.[122] Most analysts agreed that Carter was going to win the popular vote, but some argued Ford had an opportunity to win the electoral college and thus the election.[123][124] Carter ultimately won, receiving 297 electoral votes and 50.1% of the popular vote to Ford's 240 electoral votes and 48.0% of the popular vote.[125] Carter's victory was attributed in part[126] to his overwhelming support among black voters in states decided by close margins, such as Louisiana, Texas, Pennsylvania, Missouri, Mississippi, Wisconsin, and Ohio.[127] In Ohio and Wisconsin, where the margin between Carter and Ford was under two points, the black vote was crucial for Carter; if he had not won both states, Ford would have won the election.[127][128] Ford phoned Carter to congratulate him shortly after the race was called. He was unable to concede in front of television cameras due to bad hoarse voice, and so First Lady Betty did so for him.[129] Vice President Nelson Rockefeller oversaw the certification of election results on January 6, 1977. Although Ford carried Washington, Mike Padden, an elector from there, cast his vote for Ronald Reagan, the then-governor of California and Carter's eventual successor.[130] Preliminary planning for Carter's presidential transition had already been underway for months before his election.[131][132] Carter had been the first presidential candidate to allot significant funds and a significant number of personnel to a pre-election transition planning effort, which then became standard practice.[133] He set a mold that influenced all future transitions to be larger, more methodical and more formal than they were.[133][132] On November 22, 1976, Carter conducted his first visit to Washington, D.C. after being elected, meeting with director of the Office of Management James Lynn and United States secretary of defense Donald Rumsfeld at the Blair House, and holding an afternoon meeting with President Ford at the White House.[134] The next day, he conferred with congressional leaders, saying that his meetings with cabinet members had been \"very helpful\" and that Ford had offered his assistance if he needed anything.[135] Relations between Ford and Carter were relatively cold during the transition.[136] During his transition, Carter announced the selection of numerous designees for positions in his administration.[137] A few weeks before his inauguration, Carter moved his peanut business into the hands of trustees to avoid a potential conflict of interest.[138] He also asked incoming members of his administration to divest themselves of assets through blind trusts.[139] Carter was inaugurated as the 39th president on January 20, 1977.[140] One of Carter's first acts was the fulfillment of a campaign promise by issuing an executive order declaring unconditional amnesty for Vietnam War-era draft evaders, Proclamation 4483.[141][142] Carter's tenure in office was marked by an economic malaise, a time of continuing inflation and recession and a 1979 energy crisis. Under Carter, the U.S. experienced its first ever government shutdown in May 1980, though it affected only the Federal Trade Commission.[143] Carter attempted to calm various conflicts around the world, most visibly in the Middle East with the signing of the Camp David Accords;[144] giving back the Panama Canal to Panama; and signing the SALT II nuclear arms reduction treaty with Soviet leader Leonid Brezhnev. His final year was marred by the Iran hostage crisis, which contributed to his losing the 1980 election to Ronald Reagan.[145] Whistleblowers have alleged, most recently in 2023, that people working on the Reagan campaign's behalf convinced Iran to prolong the crisis to reduce Carter's chance of reelection.[146] Carter's presidency had a troubled economic history of two roughly equal periods. The first two years were a time of intense stagflation, primarily due to recovery from a previous recession that had left fixed investment at extreme lows and unemployment at 9%.[147] Under Carter, the unemployment rate declined from 8.1% when he took office to 5.7% by July 1978,[148][149] but during the early 1980s recession it returned to its pre-1977 level.[150] The Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) measured a 6.6% unemployment rate average during the Carter administration.[151] His last two years were marked by double-digit inflation, very high interest rates,[152] oil shortages, and slow economic growth.[153] Due to economic stimulus legislation, such as the Public Works Employment Act of 1977, proposed by Carter and passed by Congress, real household median income had grown by 5.2%, with a projection of 6.4% for the next quarter.[154] The 1979 energy crisis ended this period of growth, and as inflation and interest rates rose, economic growth, job creation and consumer confidence declined sharply.[152] Federal Reserve Board chairman G. William Miller's relatively loose monetary policy had already contributed to somewhat higher inflation,[155] rising from 5.8% in 1976 to 7.7% in 1978. The sudden doubling of crude oil prices by OPEC, the world's leading oil exporting cartel,[156] forced inflation to double-digit levels, averaging 11.3% in 1979 and 13.5% in 1980.[147] The sudden shortage of gasoline as the 1979 summer vacation season began exacerbated the problem and came to symbolize the crisis to the general public;[152] the acute shortage, originating in the shutdown of Amerada Hess refining facilities, led the federal government to sue the company that year.[157] In 1978, Carter declared a federal emergency in the neighborhood of Love Canal in the city of Niagara Falls, New York. More than 800 families were evacuated from the neighborhood, which had been built on top of a toxic waste landfill. The Superfund law was created in response to the situation.[158] Federal disaster money was appropriated to demolish the approximately 500 houses, the 99th Street School, and the 93rd Street School, which had been built on top of the dump; and to remediate the dump and construct a containment area for the hazardous wastes. This was the first time that such a process had been undertaken. Carter acknowledged that several more \"Love Canals\" existed across the country, and that discovering such hazardous dumpsites was \"one of the grimmest discoveries of our modern era\".[159] Moralism typified much of Carter's action.[160] On April 18, 1977, he delivered a televised speech declaring that the current energy crisis was the \"moral equivalent of war\". He encouraged energy conservation and installed solar water heating panels on the White House.[161][162] He wore sweaters to offset turning down the heat in the White House.[163] On August 4, 1977, Carter signed the Department of Energy Organization Act of 1977, forming the Department of Energy, the first new cabinet position in eleven years.[164] Carter emphasized that the House of Representatives had \"adopted almost all\" of the energy proposal he had made five months earlier and called the compromise \"a turning point in establishing a comprehensive energy program.\"[165] The following month, on October 13, Carter stated he believed in the Senate's ability to pass the energy reform bill and identified energy as \"the most important domestic issue that we will face while I am in office.\"[166] On January 12, 1978, during a press conference, Carter said the continued discussions about his energy reform proposal had been \"long and divisive and arduous\" as well as hindering to national issues that needed to be addressed with the implementation of the law.[167] In an April 11, 1978, news conference, Carter said his biggest surprise \"in the nature of a disappointment\" since becoming president was the difficulty Congress had in passing legislation, citing the energy reform bill in particular: \"I never dreamed a year ago in April when I proposed this matter to the Congress that a year later it still would not be resolved.\"[168] The Carter energy legislation was approved by Congress after much deliberation and modification on October 15, 1978. The measure deregulated the sale of natural gas, dropped a longstanding pricing disparity between intra- and interstate gas, and created tax credits to encourage energy conservation and the use of non-fossil fuels.[169] On March 1, 1979, Carter submitted a standby gasoline rationing plan per the request of Congress.[170] On April 5, he delivered an address in which he stressed the urgency of energy conservation and increasing domestic production of energy sources such as coal and solar.[171] During an April 30 news conference, he said it was imperative that the House commerce committee approve the standby gasoline rationing plan and called on Congress to pass the several other standby energy conservation plans he had proposed.[172] On July 15, 1979, Carter delivered a nationally televised address in which he identified what he believed to be a \"crisis of confidence\" among American people,[173] under the advisement of pollster Pat Caddell who believed Americans faced a crisis in confidence from events of the 1960s and 1970s, before his presidency.[174] Some later called this his \"malaise speech\",[173] memorable for mixed reactions[175][176] and his use of rhetoric.[174] The speech's negative reception centered on a view that he did not emphasize his own efforts to address the energy crisis and seemed too reliant on Americans.[177] Carter typically refused to conform to Washington's rules.[178] He avoided phone calls from members of Congress and verbally insulted them. He was unwilling to return political favors. His negativity led to frustration in passing legislation.[179] During a press conference on February 23, 1977, Carter stated that it was \"inevitable\" that he would come into conflict with Congress and added that he had found \"a growing sense of cooperation\" with Congress and met in the past with congressional members of both parties.[180] Carter developed a bitter feeling following an unsuccessful attempt at having Congress enact the scrapping of several water projects,[181] which he had requested during his first 100 days in office and received opposition from members of his party.[182] As a rift ensued between the White House and Congress afterward, Carter noted that the Democratic Party's liberal wing opposed his policies the most ardently, attributing this to Ted Kennedy's wanting the presidency.[183] Thinking he had support from 74 Congressmen, Carter issued a \"hit list\" of 19 projects that he claimed were \"pork barrel\" spending that he said he would veto if they were included in legislation.[184] He found himself again at odds with Congressional Democrats, as House Speaker Tip O'Neill found it inappropriate for a president to pursue what had traditionally been the role of Congress. Carter was also weakened by signing a bill that contained many of the \"hit list\" projects he had intended to veto.[185] In an address to a fundraising dinner for the Democratic National Committee on June 23, 1977, Carter said, \"I think it's good to point out tonight, too, that we have evolved a good working relationship with the Congress. For eight years we had government by partisanship. Now we have government by partnership.\"[186] At a July 28 news conference, assessing the first six months of his presidency, Carter spoke of his improved understanding of Congress: \"I have learned to respect the Congress more in an individual basis. I've been favorably impressed at the high degree of concentrated experience and knowledge that individual members of Congress can bring on a specific subject, where they've been the chairman of a subcommittee or committee for many years and have focused their attention on this particular aspect of government life which I will never be able to do.\"[187] On May 10, 1979, the House voted against giving Carter authority to produce a standby gas rationing plan.[188] The following day, Carter delivered remarks in the Oval Office describing himself as shocked and embarrassed for the American government by the vote and concluding \"the majority of the House Members are unwilling to take the responsibility, the political responsibility for dealing with a potential, serious threat to our Nation.\" He furthered that a majority of House members were placing higher importance on \"local or parochial interests\" and challenged the lower chamber of Congress with composing their own rationing plan in the next 90 days.[189] Carter's remarks were met with criticism by House Republicans, who accused his comments of not befitting the formality a president should have in their public remarks. Others pointed to 106 Democrats voting against his proposal and the bipartisan criticism potentially coming back to haunt him.[190] At the start of a news conference on July 25, 1979, Carter called on believers in the future of the U.S. and his proposed energy program to speak with Congress as it bore the responsibility to impose his proposals.[191] Amid the energy proposal opposition, The New York Times commented that \"as the comments flying up and down Pennsylvania Avenue illustrate, there is also a crisis of confidence between Congress and the President, sense of doubt and distrust that threatens to undermine the President's legislative program and become an important issue in next year's campaign.\"[192] In 1977, Carter appointed Alfred E. Kahn to lead the Civil Aeronautics Board (CAB). He was part of a push for deregulation of the industry, supported by leading economists, leading think tanks in Washington, a civil society coalition advocating the reform (patterned on a coalition earlier developed for the truck-and-rail-reform efforts), the head of the regulatory agency, Senate leadership, the Carter administration, and even some in the airline industry. This coalition swiftly gained legislative results in 1978.[193] Carter signed the Airline Deregulation Act into law on October 24, 1978. The main purpose of the act was to remove government control over fares, routes and market entry (of new airlines) from commercial aviation. The Civil Aeronautics Board's powers of regulation were to be phased out, eventually allowing market forces to determine routes and fares. The Act did not remove or diminish the FAA's regulatory powers over all aspects of airline safety.[194] In 1979, Carter deregulated the American beer industry by making it legal to sell malt, hops, and yeast to American home brewers for the first time since the effective 1920 beginning of prohibition in the United States.[195] This deregulation led to an increase in home brewing over the 1980s and 1990s that by the 2000s had developed into a strong craft microbrew culture in the United States, with 9,118 microbreweries, brewpubs, and regional craft breweries in the United States by the end of 2021.[196] In the late 1970s, the Chrysler Cooperation—one of the \"Big Three\" automobile manufacturers in the U.S.—faced near-certain bankruptcy as it projected a loss of $1 billion.[197] Carter proposed that the company forgo salary increases and bonuses, implying that it would be done \"without decimating the company or putting it on its knees\", but the company had already frozen wage increases and bonuses months before, to no avail.[198] In December 1979, Congress passed H.R. 5860, the Chrysler Corporation Loan Guarantee Act of 1979, to bail Chrysler out with $3.5 billion (equivalent to $10.9 billion in 2023) in aid.[199] The bill turned over $162 million in stock to Chrysler's workers, eliminated around $125 million in wage increases, and gave Chrysler $500 million in bank loans.[197] Carter signed it into law in January, saying that the bill saved thousands of jobs.[197] During his presidential campaign, Carter embraced healthcare reform akin to the Ted Kennedy-sponsored bipartisan universal national health insurance.[200] Carter's proposals on healthcare while in office included an April 1977 mandatory health care cost proposal,[201] and a June 1979 proposal that provided private health insurance coverage.[202] Carter saw the June 1979 proposal as a continuation of progress in American health coverage. President Harry S. Truman proposed a designation of health care as a basic right of Americans and Medicare and Medicaid were introduced under President Lyndon B. Johnson.[203][204] The April 1977 mandatory health care cost proposal was passed in the Senate,[205] but later defeated in the House.[206] During 1978, he met with Kennedy over a compromise healthcare law that proved unsuccessful.[207] He later said Kennedy's disagreements thwarted his plan to provide a comprehensive American health care system.[208] In 1980, Carter signed into law the Mental Health Systems (MHSA) Act, which allocated block grants to states to bolster the establishment and growth of community health services and provided funding to states to create and implement community-based health services. The MHSA was considered landmark legislation in mental health care.[209] By September 1981, the Reagan administration had repealed most of the law.[210] Early into his term, Carter collaborated with Congress to fulfill his campaign promise to create a cabinet level education department. In an address from the White House on February 28, 1978, Carter argued \"Education is far too important a matter to be scattered piecemeal among various government departments and agencies, which are often busy with sometimes dominant concerns.\"[211] On February 8, 1979, the Carter administration released an outline of its plan to establish an education department and asserted enough support for the enactment to occur by June.[212] On October 17, the same year, Carter signed the Department of Education Organization Act into law,[213] establishing the United States Department of Education.[214] Carter expanded the Head Start program with the addition of 43,000 children and families,[215] while the percentage of nondefense dollars spent on education was doubled.[216] Carter was complimentary of the presidency of Lyndon B. Johnson and the 89th United States Congress for having initiated Head Start.[217] In a speech on November 1, 1980, Carter stated his administration had extended Head Start to migrant children and was \"working hard right now with Senator Bentsen and with Kika de la Garza to make as much as $45 million available in federal money in the border districts to help with the increase in school construction for the number of Mexican school children who reside here legally\".[218] During Carter's administration, the United States Foreign Service \"lifted its ban on gay and lesbian personnel\". In 1977, Jimmy Carter's administration became the first American presidential administration to invite gay male and lesbian rights activists to the White House to discuss federal policy with regard to ending employment discrimination in federal employment on the basis of sexual orientation and related issues (presidential advisor Midge Costanza having issued the invitation).[219] From the onset of his presidency, Carter attempted to mediate the Arab–Israeli conflict.[220] After a failed attempt to seek a comprehensive settlement between the two nations in 1977 (through reconvening the 1973 Geneva conference),[221] Carter invited the Egyptian president Anwar Sadat and Israeli prime minister Menachem Begin to the presidential lodge Camp David in September 1978, in hopes of creating a definitive peace. While the two sides could not agree on Israeli withdrawal from the West Bank, the negotiations resulted in Egypt formally recognizing Israel, and the creation of an elected government in the West Bank and Gaza. This resulted in the Camp David Accords, which ended the war between Israel and Egypt.[222] The accords were a source of great domestic opposition in both Egypt and Israel. Historian Jørgen Jensehaugen argues that by the time Carter left office in January 1981, he was \"in an odd position—he had attempted to break with traditional U.S. policy but ended up fulfilling the goals of that tradition, which had been to break up the Arab alliance, sideline the Palestinians, build an alliance with Egypt, weaken the Soviet Union and secure Israel.\"[223] In an address to the African officials at the United Nations on October 4, 1977, Carter stated the U.S.'s interest to \"see a strong, vigorous, free, and prosperous Africa with as much of the control of government as possible in the hands of the residents of your countries\" and pointed to their unified efforts on \"the problem of how to resolve the Rhodesian, Zimbabwe question.\"[224] At a news conference later that month, Carter outlined that the U.S. wanted to \"work harmoniously with South Africa in dealing with the threats to peace in Namibia and in Zimbabwe in particular\", as well as do away with racial issues such as apartheid, and for equal opportunities in other facets of society in the region.[225] Despite human rights concerns, Carter continued U.S. support for Mobutu Sese Seko of Zaire.[226] Zaire received nearly half the foreign aid Carter allocated to sub-Saharan Africa.[227] Under Carter an allyship with Liberia's Samuel Doe who had come to power in a 1980 coup was pursued.[228] Carter visited Nigeria from March 31 to April 3, 1978, to improve relations;[229] the first U.S. president to do so.[230] He reiterated interest in convening a peace conference on Rhodesia that involved all parties and said the U.S. was moving as it could.[231] The elections of Margaret Thatcher as prime minister of the United Kingdom[232] and Abel Muzorewa for Prime Minister of Zimbabwe Rhodesia,[233] South Africa turning down a plan for South West Africa's independence, and domestic opposition in Congress were seen as a heavy blow to the Carter administration's policy toward South Africa.[234] On May 16, 1979, the Senate voted in favor of lifting economic sanctions against Rhodesia, seen by some Rhodesians and South Africans as a potentially fatal blow to joint diplomacy efforts the United States and Britain had pursued in the region for three years and any compromise between the Salisbury leaders and guerrillas.[235] On December 3, Secretary of State Cyrus Vance promised Senator Jesse Helms that when the British governor arrived in Salisbury to implement an agreed Lancaster House settlement and the electoral process began, the President would take prompt action to lift sanctions against Zimbabwe Rhodesia.[236] Carter sought closer relations with the People's Republic of China (PRC), continuing the Nixon administration's drastic policy of rapprochement. The two countries increasingly collaborated against the Soviet Union, and the Carter administration tacitly consented to the Chinese invasion of Vietnam. In December 1978, he announced the United States' intention to formally recognize and establish full diplomatic relations with the PRC starting on January 1, 1979, while severing ties with Taiwan, including revoking a mutual defense treaty with the latter.[237][238] In 1979, Carter extended formal diplomatic recognition to the PRC for the first time. This decision led to a boom in trade between the United States and the PRC, which was pursuing economic reforms under the leadership of Deng Xiaoping.[239] Carter supported the China-allied Khmer Rouge regime in Cambodia fighting the Soviet-backed Vietnamese invasion.[240] After the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan, Carter allowed the sale of military supplies to China and began negotiations to share military intelligence.[241] In January 1980, Carter unilaterally revoked the Sino-American Mutual Defense Treaty with the Republic of China (ROC), which had lost control of mainland China to the PRC in 1949, but retained control of the island of Taiwan. Conservative Republicans challenged Carter's abrogation of the treaty in court, but the Supreme Court ruled that the issue was a non-justiciable political question in Goldwater v. Carter. The U.S. continued to maintain diplomatic contacts with the ROC through the 1979 Taiwan Relations Act.[242] During Carter's presidency, the U.S. continued to support Indonesia under Suharto as a cold war ally, despite human rights violations in East Timor. The violations followed Indonesia's December 1975 invasion and occupation of East Timor. Under Carter's administration military assistance to Indonesia increased, peaking in 1978.[243][244] This was antithetical to Carter's stated policy of \"not selling weapons if it would exacerbate a potential conflict in a region of the world\".[245][246] During a news conference on March 9, 1977, Carter reaffirmed his interest in having a gradual withdrawal of American troops from South Korea and said he wanted South Korea to eventually have \"adequate ground forces owned by and controlled by the South Korean government to protect themselves against any intrusion from North Korea.\"[247] On May 19, The Washington Post quoted Chief of Staff of U.S. forces in South Korea John K. Singlaub as criticizing Carter's withdrawal of troops from the Korean peninsula. Later that day, Press Secretary Rex Granum announced that Carter had summoned Singlaub to the White House, and confirmed that Carter had seen the Washington Post article.[248] Carter relieved Singlaub of his duties on May 21 after a meeting between the two.[249][250] During a news conference on May 26, 1977, Carter said South Korea could defend itself with reduced American troops in case of conflict.[251] From June 30 to July 1, 1979, Carter held meetings with president of South Korea Park Chung Hee at the Blue House for a discussion on relations between the U.S. and South Korea as well as Carter's interest in preserving his policy of worldwide tension reduction.[252] On April 21, 1978, Carter announced a reduction in American troops in South Korea scheduled to be released by the end of the year by two-thirds, citing lack of action by Congress in regard to a compensatory aid package for the South Korean government.[253] On November 15, 1977, Carter pledged that his administration would continue positive relations between the U.S. and Iran, calling its contemporary status \"strong, stable and progressive\".[254] On December 31, 1977, he called Iran under the Shah an \"island of stability\" made possible by the \"admiration and love your people give to [the Shah]\".[255][256] Carter praised the Shah's \"great leadership\" and spoke of \"personal friendship\" between them.[257] American support for the unpopular Shah increased anti-American sentiment in Iran, which intensified after the Shah, who was dying of cancer, left Iran for the last time in January 1979 and Carter allowed him to be admitted to the Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center in New York on October 22, 1979.[258] On November 4, 1979, a group of Iranian students took over the U.S. Embassy in Tehran. The students belonged to the Muslim Student Followers of the Imam's Line and supported the Iranian Revolution.[259] Fifty-two American diplomats and citizens were held hostage for the next 444 days. They were freed immediately after Ronald Reagan succeeded Carter as president on January 20, 1981. During the crisis, Carter remained in isolation in the White House for more than 100 days, until he left to participate in the lighting of the National Menorah on the Ellipse.[260] A month into the affair, Carter announced his commitment to resolving the dispute without \"any military action that would cause bloodshed or arouse the unstable captors of our hostages to attack them or to punish them\".[261] On April 7, 1980, he issued Executive Order 12205, imposing economic sanctions against Iran,[262] and announced further government measures he deemed necessary to ensure a safe release.[263][264] On April 24, 1980, Carter ordered Operation Eagle Claw to try to free the hostages. The mission failed, leaving eight American servicemen dead and two aircraft destroyed.[265][266] The failure led Secretary of State Cyrus Vance, who had opposed the mission, to resign.[267] Released in 2017, a declassified memo produced by the CIA in 1980 concluded \"Iranian hardliners—especially Ayatollah Khomeini\" were \"determined to exploit the hostage issue to bring about President Carter's defeat in the November elections.\" Additionally, Tehran in 1980 wanted \"the world to believe that Imam Khomeini caused President Carter's downfall and disgrace.\"[268] On February 8, 1977, Carter said he had urged the Soviet Union to align with the U.S. in forming \"a comprehensive test ban to stop all nuclear testing for at least an extended period of time\", and that he was in favor of the Soviet Union ceasing deployment of the RSD-10 Pioneer.[269] During a June 13 press conference, he said that at the beginning of the week, the U.S. would \"work closely with the Soviet Union on a comprehensive test ban treaty to prohibit all testing of nuclear devices underground or in the atmosphere\", and Paul Warnke would negotiate demilitarization of the Indian Ocean with the Soviet Union beginning the following week.[270] At a December 30 news conference, Carter said that during \"the last few months, the United States and the Soviet Union have made great progress in dealing with a long list of important issues, the most important of which is to control the deployment of strategic nuclear weapons\", and that the two countries sought to conclude SALT II talks by the spring of the next year.[271] The talk of a comprehensive test ban treaty materialized with the signing of the Strategic Arms Limitation Treaty II by Carter and Leonid Brezhnev on June 18, 1979.[272][273] In 1979, the Soviets intervened in the Second Yemenite War. The Soviet backing of South Yemen constituted a \"smaller shock\", in tandem with tensions that were rising due to the Iranian Revolution. This played a role in making Carter's stance on the Soviet Union more assertive, a shift that finalized with the impending Soviet-Afghan War.[274] In his 1980 State of the Union Address, Carter emphasized the significance of relations between the two regions: \"Now, as during the last 3½ decades, the relationship between our country, the United States of America, and the Soviet Union is the most critical factor in determining whether the world will live at peace or be engulfed in global conflict.\"[275] Communists under the leadership of Nur Muhammad Taraki seized power in Afghanistan on April 27, 1978.[276] The new regime signed a treaty of friendship with the Soviet Union in December of that year.[276][277] Due to the regime's improvement of secular education and redistribution of land coinciding with mass executions and political oppression, Taraki was deposed by rival Hafizullah Amin in September.[276][277][278] Amin was considered a \"brutal psychopath\" by foreign observers and had lost control of much of the country, prompting the Soviet Union to invade Afghanistan on December 24, 1979, execute Amin, and install Babrak Karmal as president.[276][277] In the West, the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan was considered a threat to global security and the oil supplies of the Persian Gulf, as well as the existence of Pakistan.[277][279] These concerns led Carter to expand collaboration between the CIA and Pakistan's Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI), which had begun in July 1979, when the CIA started providing $695,000 worth of non-lethal assistance (e.g., \"cash, medical equipment, and radio transmitters\") to the Afghan mujahideen.[280] The modest scope of this early collaboration was likely influenced by the understanding, later recounted by CIA official Robert Gates, \"that a substantial U.S. covert aid program\" might have \"raise[d] the stakes\", thereby causing \"the Soviets to intervene more directly and vigorously than otherwise intended.\"[279][281] According to a 2020 review of declassified U.S. documents by Conor Tobin in the journal Diplomatic History: \"The primary significance of this small-scale aid was in creating constructive links with dissidents through Pakistan's ISI that could be utilized in the case of an overt Soviet intervention ... The small-scale covert program that developed in response to the increasing Soviet influence was part of a contingency plan if the Soviets did intervene militarily, as Washington would be in a better position to make it difficult for them to consolidate their position, but not designed to induce an intervention.\"[280] On December 28, 1979, Carter signed a presidential finding explicitly allowing the CIA to transfer \"lethal military equipment either directly or through third countries to the Afghan opponents of the Soviet intervention in Afghanistan\" and to arrange \"selective training, conducted outside of Afghanistan, in the use of such equipment either directly or via third country intermediation.\"[280] His finding defined the CIA's mission as \"harassment\" of Soviet troops; at the time, \"this was not a war the CIA expected to win outright on the battlefield,\" in the words of Steve Coll.[282] Carter was determined to respond harshly to what he considered a dangerous provocation. In a televised speech on January 23, 1980, he announced sanctions on the Soviet Union, promised renewed aid and registration to Pakistan and the Selective Service System, and committed the U.S. to the Persian Gulf's defense.[279][281][283][284] Carter imposed an embargo on grain shipments to the USSR, tabled SALT II, requested a 5% annual increase in defense spending,[285][286] and called for a boycott of the 1980 Summer Olympics in Moscow, which was ultimately joined by 65 other nations.[287][288][289] British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher enthusiastically backed Carter's tough stance.[279] National Security Advisor Zbigniew Brzezinski played a major role in organizing Carter's policies on the Soviet Union as a grand strategy.[290] In early 1980, Carter determined the thrust of U.S. policy for the duration of the war: he initiated a program to arm the mujahideen through Pakistan's ISI and secured a pledge from Saudi Arabia to match U.S. funding for this purpose. Despite huge expenditure, the Soviet Union was unable to quell the insurgency and withdrew from Afghanistan in 1989 amid the economic, political, and social turmoil within the USSR, precipitating its collapse two years later.[291][279] The routing of U.S. aid through Pakistan led to some controversy, as weapons sent to Karachi were frequently controlled by Pakistan, whose government influenced which rebels received assistance. Despite this, Carter has expressed no regret over his decision to support what he still considers the Afghan freedom fighters.[279] Carter made twelve international trips to 25 countries as president.[292] He was the first president to make a state visit to Sub-Saharan Africa when he went to Nigeria in 1978.[230] His travel also included trips to Europe, Asia, and Latin America. He made several trips to the Middle East to broker peace negotiations. His visit to Iran from December 31, 1977, to January 1, 1978, took place less than a year before the overthrow of Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi.[293] The September 21, 1977, resignation of Bert Lance, who was director of the office of management and budget in the Carter administration, came amid allegations of improper banking activities before his tenure and was an embarrassment to Carter.[294] Carter became the first sitting president to testify under oath as part of an investigation of him,[295][296] as a result of United States Attorney General Griffin Bell appointing Paul J. Curran as a special counsel to investigate loans made to the peanut business Carter owned by a bank controlled by Lance and Curran's position as special counsel not allowing him to file charges on his own.[297][d] Curran announced in October 1979 that no evidence had been found to support allegations that funds loaned from the National Bank of Georgia had been diverted to Carter's 1976 presidential campaign, ending the investigation.[298] Carter's reelection campaign was based primarily on attacking Ronald Reagan. The campaign frequently pointed out and mocked Reagan's proclivity for gaffes, using his age and perceived lack of connection to his native California voter base against him.[299] Later, the campaign used similar rhetoric as Lyndon Johnson's 1964 presidential campaign, portraying Reagan as a warmonger who could not be trusted with the nuclear arsenal.[300] Carter attempted to deny the Reagan campaign $29.4 million (equivalent to $91 million in 2023) in campaign funds, due to dependent conservative groups already raising $60 million to get him elected—an amount that exceeded the limit of campaign funds. Carter's attempt was later denied by the Federal Election Commission.[301] Carter announced his reelection campaign in December 1979.[302] A month earlier, Senator Ted Kennedy had announced his candidacy for the Democratic nomination.[303] During the Democratic presidential primaries, questions about Kennedy were a frequent subject of Carter's press conferences.[304][305] Despite winning key states such as California and New York, Kennedy surprised his supporters by running a weak campaign. Carter won most of the primaries and secured renomination. He later wrote that the strongest opposition to his policies came from the Democratic Party's liberal wing, which he attributed to Kennedy's ambition to replace him as president.[306] Kennedy had mobilized the liberal wing, which weakened Carter's support in the general election.[307] Carter and Mondale were formally nominated at the 1980 Democratic National Convention in New York City.[308] Carter delivered a speech notable for its tribute to the late Hubert Humphrey, whom he initially called \"Hubert Horatio Hornblower\",[309] and Kennedy made \"The Dream Shall Never Die\" speech, in which he criticized Reagan and did not endorse Carter.[310] Along with Reagan and Kennedy, Carter was opposed by centrist John B. Anderson, who had previously contested the Republican presidential primaries, and upon losing to Reagan, reentered the race as an independent. Anderson advertised himself as a more liberal alternative to Reagan's conservatism.[311] As the campaign went on, Anderson's polling numbers dropped and his base was gradually pulled to Carter or Reagan.[312] Carter had to run against his own \"stagflation\"-ridden economy, while the hostage crisis in Iran dominated the news every week. He was attacked by conservatives for failing to \"prevent Soviet gains\" in less-developed countries, as pro-Soviet governments had taken power in countries including Angola, Ethiopia, Nicaragua and Afghanistan.[313] His brother, Billy Carter, caused controversy due to his association with Muammar Gaddafi's regime in Libya.[314] Carter alienated many liberal college students, who were expected to be one of his strongest support bases, by reactivating the Selective Service System on July 2, 1980, reinstating registration for the military draft. His campaign manager and former appointments secretary, Timothy Kraft, stepped down five weeks before the general election amid what turned out to be an uncorroborated allegation of cocaine use.[315] On October 28, Carter and Reagan participated in the sole presidential debate of the election cycle in which they were both present, due to Carter refusing to participate in debates that included Anderson.[316] Though initially trailing Carter by several points,[317] Reagan experienced a surge in polling after the debate.[318] This was in part influenced by Reagan deploying the phrase \"There you go again\", which became the election's defining phrase.[319] It was later discovered that in the final days of the campaign, Reagan's team acquired classified documents Carter used to prepare for the debate.[320] Reagan defeated Carter in a landslide, winning 489 electoral votes. The Senate went Republican for the first time since 1952.[321] In his concession speech, Carter admitted that he was hurt by the outcome of the election but pledged \"a very fine transition period\" with President-elect Reagan.[322] Shortly after losing reelection, Carter told the White House press corps that he intended to emulate the retirement of Harry S. Truman and not use his subsequent public life to enrich himself.[323] Diplomacy was a large part of Carter's post-presidency. These diplomatic efforts began in the Middle East, with a September 1981 meeting with prime minister of Israel Menachem Begin,[324] and a March 1983 tour of Egypt that included meeting with members of the Palestine Liberation Organization.[325] In 2018, official files revealed that, in January 1993, Carter had been suggested for a Northern Ireland peace process role by president-elect Bill Clinton amid speculation that Clinton would appoint a special envoy for Northern Ireland.[326] In 1994, president Clinton sought Carter's assistance in a North Korea peace mission, during which Carter negotiated an understanding with Kim Il Sung.[327][328] Carter outlined a treaty with Kim, which he announced to CNN without the Clinton administration's consent to spur American action.[329] In March 1999, Carter visited Taiwan and met with President Lee Teng-hui. During the meeting, Carter praised the progress Taiwan made in democracy, human rights, economy, culture, science and technology.[330] In 2003, Carter championed a plan to hold elections in Venezuela amid protests aimed at doing so.[331] Ultimately, no elections were held. In 2006, Carter stated his disagreements with Israel's domestic and foreign policy while saying he supported the country,[332][333] extending his criticisms to Israel's policies in Lebanon, the West Bank, and Gaza.[334] In July 2007, Carter joined Nelson Mandela in Johannesburg, South Africa, to announce his participation in The Elders, a group of independent global leaders who work together on peace and human rights issues.[335][336] After the announcement, Carter participated in visits to Darfur,[337] Sudan,[338][339] Cyprus, the Korean Peninsula, and the Middle East, among others.[340] He attempted to travel to Zimbabwe in November 2008, but was stopped by President Robert Mugabe's government.[341] In December 2008, Carter met with Syrian President Bashar al-Assad,[342][343] and in a June 2012 call with Jeffery Brown, stressed that Egyptian military generals could take full executive and legislative power to form a new constitution favoring themselves if their announced intentions came true.[344] On August 10, 2010, Carter traveled to North Korea to secure the release of Aijalon Gomes, successfully negotiating his release.[345][346] Throughout the latter part of 2017, as tensions between the U.S. and North Korea persisted, Carter recommended a peace treaty between the two nations,[347] and confirmed he had offered himself to the Trump administration as a willing candidate to be diplomatic envoy to North Korea.[348] Carter began his first year out of office with a pledge not to critique the Reagan administration, saying it was \"too early\".[349] He sided with Reagan on issues like building neutron arms after the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan,[350] but frequently spoke out against his administration, denouncing many of its actions in the Middle East;[351] in 1987, Carter said that Reagan was incapable of preserving peace in the Middle East.[352] He condemned the handling of the Sabra and Shatila massacre,[353] the lack of efforts to rescue and retrieve four American businessmen from West Beirut in 1984,[354] Reagan's support of the Strategic Defense Initiative in 1985,[355] and his claim of an international conspiracy on terrorism.[356] In 1987 he criticized Reagan for conceding to terrorist demands,[357] nominating Robert Bork for the Supreme Court,[358] and his handling of the Persian Gulf crisis.[359] On January 16, 1989, before the inauguration of George H. W. Bush, Carter told Gerald Ford that Reagan had experienced a media honeymoon, saying that he believed Reagan's immediate successor would be less fortunate.[360] Carter had a mostly poor relationship with Bill Clinton, who snubbed him from his inauguration ceremony. He doubted the morality of the Clinton administration, particularly with respect to the Monica Lewinsky scandal and the pardon of Marc Rich.[361] In July 2001, Carter said he was \"disappointed in almost everything\" President George W. Bush had done, but after the September 11 attacks, he offered only praise, calling on Americans to support Bush with \"complete unity\".[362] Later, Carter opposed the Iraq War[363] and what he considered an attempt by Bush and Tony Blair to oust Saddam Hussein with \"lies and misinterpretations\".[364] In 2004, Carter said that he believed Bush exploited the September 11 attacks and blamed the media for not criticizing him.[365] In 2007, Carter said the Bush administration \"has been the worst in history\" on foreign affairs;[366] he later said he was just comparing Bush's tenure to Nixon's.[367] Tony Fratto responded to Carter's comments on the Bush administration's behalf by saying that the comments increased Carter's irrelevance.[368] By the end of Bush's second term, Carter considered Bush's tenure disappointing, as he told Forward Magazine of Syria.[369] Though he praised President Barack Obama in the early part of his tenure,[370] Carter stated his disagreement with using drone strikes against suspected terrorists, Obama's choice to keep Guantanamo Bay detention camp open,[371] and the federal surveillance programs Edward Snowden revealed.[372][373] During Donald Trump's presidency, Carter spoke favorably of the chance for immigration reform[374] and criticized Trump for his handling of the U.S. national anthem protests.[375] In October 2017, he defended Trump in an interview with The New York Times, criticizing the media's coverage of him as harsher \"than any other president certainly that I've known about\".[376][377] In 2019, Trump called Carter and expressed concern that China was \"getting ahead\" of the United States. Carter agreed, saying that China's strength came from its lack of involvement in armed conflict and calling the U.S. \"the most warlike nation in the history of the world.\"[378] Carter was considered a potential candidate in the 1984 presidential election,[379][380] but did not run and instead endorsed Walter Mondale for the Democratic nomination.[381][382] After Mondale secured the nomination, Carter critiqued the Reagan campaign,[383] spoke at the 1984 Democratic National Convention, and advised Mondale.[384] After the election, in which Reagan defeated Mondale, Carter said the loss was predictable because Mondale's platform included raising taxes.[385] In the 1988 presidential election, Carter ruled himself out as a candidate and predicted Vice President George H. W. Bush would be the Republican nominee.[386] Carter foresaw unity at the 1988 Democratic National Convention,[387] where he delivered an address.[388] After the election, which Bush won, Carter said Bush would have a more difficult presidency than Reagan because he was not as popular.[389] During the 1992 presidential election, Carter met with Senator Paul Tsongas, who sought his advice.[390] Carter spoke favorably of former governor of Arkansas Bill Clinton,[391] and criticized Ross Perot, a Texas billionaire who was running as an independent.[392] As the primary concluded, Carter spoke of the need for the 1992 Democratic National Convention to address certain issues not focused on in the past,[393] and campaigned for Clinton after he became the Democratic nominee,[394] publicly stating his expectation to be consulted during Clinton's presidency.[395] Carter endorsed Vice President Al Gore days before the 2000 presidential election,[396] and in subsequent years voiced his opinion that Gore won the election,[397] despite Bush's eventual victory following the Supreme Court's ruling in Bush v. Gore.[398] In the 2004 presidential election, Carter endorsed John Kerry and spoke at the 2004 Democratic National Convention.[399] He also voiced concern about another voting mishap in Florida.[400] During the 2008 Democratic presidential primaries, it was speculated that Carter would endorse Barack Obama over his main primary rival Hillary Clinton, as Carter spoke favorably of Obama, as did other members of the Carter family.[401][402] Carter also commented on Clinton ending her bid when superdelegates voted after the June 3 primary.[403] Carter criticized the Republican nominee, John McCain.[404][405] Carter warned Obama against selecting Clinton as his running mate.[406] Carter endorsed Republican Mitt Romney for the Republican nomination during the primary season of the 2012 presidential election, though he clarified that his backing of Romney was due to him considering the former Massachusetts governor the candidate that could best assure a victory for President Obama.[407] Carter delivered a videotape address at the 2012 Democratic National Convention.[408] Carter was critical of Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump shortly after the latter entered the primary, predicting that he would lose.[409][410] As the primary continued, Carter said he would prefer Trump to his main rival, Ted Cruz,[411] though he rebuked the Trump campaign in remarks during the primary[412] and in his address to the 2016 Democratic National Convention. Carter believed that Trump would not have been elected without Russia's interference in the 2016 election,[413] and \"that Trump didn't actually win the election in 2016. He lost the election, and he was put into office because the Russians interfered on his behalf.\" When questioned, he agreed that Trump is an \"illegitimate president\".[414][415] In a 2017 discussion with Senator Bernie Sanders, Carter revealed he voted for Sanders in the 2016 Democratic Party presidential primaries.[416] Jimmy and Rosalynn Carter delivered a recorded audio message endorsing Joe Biden for the virtual 2020 Democratic National Convention. On January 6, 2021, following the U.S. Capitol attack, along with the other three still living former presidents, Barack Obama, George W. Bush, and Bill Clinton,[417] Jimmy Carter denounced the attack, releasing a statement saying that he and his wife were \"troubled\" by the events, also stating that what had occurred was \"a national tragedy and is not who we are as a nation\", and adding that \"having observed elections in troubled democracies worldwide, I know that we the people can unite to walk back from this precipice to peacefully uphold the laws of our nation\".[418] Carter delivered a recorded audio message for the inauguration of Joe Biden on January 20, 2021, as the Carters were unable to attend the ceremony in person.[419] In November 2022, the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit overruled a three-judge panel of the court and scheduled a rehearing of the case against the Trump administration-proposed land swap in Alaska to allow a road through the Izembek National Wildlife Refuge. In an unusual action, Carter had filed an opinion in support of the suit by environmental groups, saying the swap violated the Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act (Anilca) passed in 1980 near the end of Carter's term. Carter said the act \"may be the most significant domestic achievement of my political life\" at the time of his filing.[420] In August 2024, Carter's son Chip said his father wanted to live to 100 to vote for Kamala Harris in the 2024 presidential election.[421] He achieved this on October 16, the second day of early voting in Georgia.[422][423] Carter criticized the Bush administration's handling of Hurricane Katrina,[424] and built homes in the aftermath of Hurricane Sandy.[425] He also partnered with former presidents to work with One America Appeal to help the victims of Hurricane Harvey and Hurricane Irma in the Gulf Coast and Texas communities,[426] in addition to writing op-eds about the goodness seen in Americans who assist each other during natural disasters.[427] In 1982, Carter founded the Carter Center,[428] a non-governmental and non-profit organization with the purpose of advancing human rights and alleviating human suffering,[429] including helping improve the quality of life for people in more than 80 countries.[430] Among these efforts has been the contribution of the Carter Center working alongside the World Health Organization to the near-eradication of dracunculiasis, also called Guinea worm disease. The incidence of this disease has decreased from 3.5 million cases in the mid-1980s, to 25 cases in 2016,[431][432] and four in the first seven months of 2024, according to the Carter Center's statistics.[433] Carter attended the dedication of his presidential library[434] and those of Presidents Ronald Reagan,[435] George H. W. Bush,[436] Bill Clinton,[437][438] and George W. Bush.[439] He delivered eulogies at the funerals of Coretta Scott King,[440] Gerald Ford,[441][442] and Theodore Hesburgh.[443] In 2007, Carter founded the New Baptist Covenant organization for social justice.[444][445] As of August 2019[update], Carter was Honorary Chair for the World Justice Project[446] and formerly served as one for the Continuity of Government Commission.[447] He continued to occasionally teach Sunday school at Maranatha Baptist Church as of 2019.[448] Carter also taught at Emory University in Atlanta, and in June 2019 was awarded tenure for 37 years of service.[449] Carter's Palestine: Peace Not Apartheid, a New York Times Best Seller book, published in 2006, generated controversy for characterizing Israel's policies in the Israeli-occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip as amounting to apartheid.[450] In an interview, Carter defined apartheid as the \"forced separation of two peoples in the same territory with one of the groups dominating or controlling the other.\"[451] In remarks broadcast over radio, he said that Israel's policies amounted to an apartheid worse than South Africa's:[452] When Israel does occupy this territory deep within the West Bank, and connects the 200-or-so settlements with each other, with a road, and then prohibits the Palestinians from using that road, or in many cases even crossing the road, this perpetrates even worse instances of apartness, or apartheid, than we witnessed even in South Africa.[452] Carter defended himself against accusations of antisemitism by saying \"the hope is that my book will at least stimulate a debate, which has not existed in this country. There's never been any debate on this issue, of any significance.\"[452] He expressed his opinion that Israel will not have peace until it agrees to withdraw from the occupied territories, adding, \"the greatest commitment in my life has been trying to bring peace to Israel.\"[452] In his 2010 book We Can Have Peace in the Holy Land, Carter cites Israel's unwillingness to withdraw from the territories and settlement expansion as the primary obstacle to peace in the Middle East.[453] The Carter family experienced another family peanut business dilemma when it accumulated a one-million-dollar debt in 1981. Former President Carter began writing books to pay off this debt. As of July 2019, he had \"published more than 30, from a children's book to reflections on his presidency\".[454] Carter's hobbies included painting,[455] fly fishing, woodworking, cycling, tennis, and skiing.[456] He also had an interest in poetry, particularly the works of Dylan Thomas.[457] During a state visit to the UK in 1977, Carter suggested that Thomas should have a memorial in Poets' Corner at Westminster Abbey;[458] this later came to fruition in 1982.[457][459] Carter was a personal friend of Elvis Presley, whom he and Rosalynn met on June 30, 1973, before Presley was to perform onstage in Atlanta.[460] They remained in contact by telephone two months before Presley's sudden death in August 1977. Carter later recalled an abrupt phone call received in June 1977 from Presley who sought a presidential pardon from Carter, to help George Klein's criminal case; at the time Klein had been indicted for only mail fraud, and was later found guilty of conspiracy.[461][462] According to Carter, Presley was almost incoherent because of barbiturates; although he phoned the White House several times again, this was the last time they spoke.[463] The day after Presley's death, Carter issued a statement and explained how he had \"changed the face of American popular culture\".[464] Carter filed a report with both the International UFO Bureau and the National Investigations Committee On Aerial Phenomena,[465] stating that he sighted an unidentified flying object in October 1969.[466][467][468] From a young age, Carter showed a deep commitment to evangelical Christianity.[469][470] Carter taught Sunday school at Maranatha Baptist Church in Plains, Georgia.[471] At a private inauguration worship service, the preacher was Nelson Price, the pastor of Roswell Street Baptist Church of Marietta, Georgia.[472] An evangelical Christian, Carter appealed to voters after the scandals of the Nixon Administration, and is credited with popularizing the term \"born again\" into American lexicon during the 1976 American presidential campaign.[470][473][474][475] As president, Carter prayed several times a day, and professed that Jesus was the driving force in his life. He was greatly influenced by a sermon he had heard as a young man that asked: \"If you were arrested for being a Christian, would there be enough evidence to convict you?\"[476] In 2000, after the Southern Baptist Convention announced it would no longer permit women to become pastors, he renounced his membership, saying: \"I personally feel that women should play an absolutely equal role in service of Christ in the church.\"[477] He remained a member of the Cooperative Baptist Fellowship.[469] Carter's support for the Equal Rights Amendment[478] led many evangelical conservatives to leave the Democratic Party, contributing to the development of the Christian right in American politics.[479] Carter had three younger siblings, all of whom died of pancreatic cancer: sisters Gloria Spann (1926–1990) and Ruth Stapleton (1929–1983), and brother Billy Carter (1937–1988).[480] He was first cousin to politician Hugh Carter and a distant cousin to the Carter family of musicians.[481] He was related to Motown founder Berry Gordy by way of their white great-grandfather James Thomas Gordy, who fathered a child with a black woman he enslaved.[482] Carter married Rosalynn Smith on July 7, 1946, in the Plains Methodist Church, the church of Rosalynn's family.[483] They had three sons, Jack, James III \"Chip\", and Donnel; one daughter, Amy; nine grandsons (one of whom is deceased), three granddaughters, five great-grandsons, and eight great-granddaughters.[484] Mary Prince (an African American woman wrongly convicted of murder, and later pardoned) was their daughter Amy's nanny for most of the period from 1971 until Jimmy Carter's presidency ended.[485][486][487] Carter had asked to be designated as her parole officer, thus helping to enable her to work in the White House.[486][e] The Carters celebrated their 77th anniversary on July 7, 2023. On October 19, 2019, they became the longest-wed presidential couple, having overtaken George and Barbara Bush at 26,765 days.[490] After Rosalynn's death on November 19, 2023, Carter released the following statement: Rosalynn was my equal partner in everything I ever accomplished. She gave me wise guidance and encouragement when I needed it. As long as Rosalynn was in the world, I always knew somebody loved and supported me.[491] The Carters' eldest son, Jack Carter, was the 2006 Democratic nominee for U.S. Senate in Nevada and lost to Republican incumbent John Ensign. Jack's son Jason Carter is a former Georgia state senator,[492] and in 2014 was the Democratic nominee for governor of Georgia, losing to the Republican incumbent, Nathan Deal. On December 20, 2015, while teaching a Sunday school class, Carter announced that his 28-year-old grandson Jeremy Carter had died of unspecified causes.[493] On August 3, 2015, Carter underwent an elective surgery to remove a small mass on his liver, and his prognosis for a full recovery was initially said to be excellent. On August 12, he announced he had been diagnosed with cancer that had metastasized, without specifying where the cancer had originated.[494] On August 20, Carter disclosed that melanoma had been found in his brain and liver, and that he had begun treatment with the immunotherapy drug pembrolizumab and was about to start radiation therapy. His healthcare was managed by Emory Healthcare of Atlanta. His family history of cancer includes both of his parents and all three of his siblings.[495] On December 5, he announced that his medical scans no longer showed any cancer.[496] Carter broke his hip in a fall at his Plains home on May 13, 2019, and underwent surgery the same day at the Phoebe Sumter Medical Center in Americus, Georgia.[497] On October 6, an injury above his left eyebrow received in another fall at home required 14 stitches[498] and resulted in a black eye.[499] On October 21, Carter was admitted to the Phoebe Sumter Medical Center after sustaining a minor pelvic fracture from falling at home for the third time in 2019.[500] He was able to resume teaching Sunday school at Maranatha Baptist Church on November 3.[501][502] On November 11, 2019, Carter was hospitalized at the Emory University Hospital in Atlanta for a procedure to relieve pressure on his brain caused by bleeding connected with his falls.[503][504] He was released from the hospital on November 27.[505][503] On December 2, 2019, Carter was readmitted to the hospital for a urinary tract infection. He was released on December 4.[506][507] On February 18, 2023, the Carter Center announced that following a \"series of short hospital stays\", Carter decided to \"spend his remaining time at home with his family\" in Plains to \"receive hospice care instead of additional medical intervention\"[508][509] for an unspecified illness.[510][511] At 100 years old, Carter was the longest-lived former U.S. president, a title he held until his passing.[512] He was the earliest-serving living former president since Gerald Ford's death in 2006. In 2012, he surpassed Herbert Hoover as the longest-retired president. In 2017 and 2021, Carter became the first president to live to the 40th anniversary of his inauguration and post-presidency respectively. In 2017, Carter, then 92, became the oldest former president ever to attend an American presidential inauguration.[513][514] On March 22, 2019, he became the longest-lived U.S. president, surpassing George H. W. Bush, who died a few months earlier at the age of 94 years, 171 days.[515] He said in a 2019 interview with People that he never expected to live as long as he had and that the best explanation for longevity was a good marriage.[516] Carter entered hospice care six months before celebrating his 99th birthday at his home.[517] The Carter Center announced Jimmy Carter 100: A Celebration in Song, an event concert to celebrate Carter's 100th birthday that featured appearances by musicians and celebrities. The event took place on September 17, 2024, at the Fox Theatre in Atlanta, Georgia.[518] On October 1, 2024, Carter turned 100, the first president to do so.[519] Local events to celebrate his birthday included a F-18 Super Hornet flyover formation by eight Navy pilots from Naval Air Station Oceana, which Carter viewed from his backyard, and a naturalization ceremony for 100 new citizens at Plains High School, which Chip Carter attended.[520][521] Carter made arrangements to be buried in front of his home at 209 Woodland Drive in Plains. In 2006, he said that a funeral in Washington, D.C., with visitation at the Carter Center, was also planned.[522] Carter asked President Biden to deliver his eulogy.[523] Carter died at his home in Plains, Georgia, on December 29, 2024, at the age of 100. His son, James E. Carter III, announced his death that afternoon.[524][525][526] This followed his February 2023 decision to enter hospice care.[527] Shortly after the announcement, President Joe Biden released a statement honoring Carter's legacy, calling him a \"man of principle, faith, and humility.\" The Biden administration also announced plans to hold an official state funeral, and a day of mourning for him on January 9, 2025.[528] When Carter left office in 1981, scholars and even many Democrats viewed his presidency as a failure.[529][530][531][532] Betty Glad, a political scientist at the University of Illinois, summarized the public consensus on Carter: \"he didn't have a well-developed political philosophy and gave people a feeling he didn't quite know where he was headed.\"[533] Historians have ranked Carter's presidency as below average.[534][535] After leaving office, he told allies he predicted history would be kinder to him than voters were in the 1980 election.[533] In a 1982 Chicago Tribune survey, when 49 historians and scholars were asked to rank the best and worst U.S. presidents, Carter was ranked the tenth worst.[536] In 2006, conservative British historian Andrew Roberts ranked Carter the worst U.S. president.[537] Yet some of Carter's policy accomplishments have been more favorably received.[538] The 2009 documentary Back Door Channels: The Price of Peace credits Carter's efforts at Camp David, which brought peace between Israel and Egypt, with bringing the only meaningful peace to the Middle East.[539][540] Stuart E. Eizenstat, who served as Carter's chief White House domestic policy adviser, wrote, \"Carter's accomplishments at home and abroad were more extensive and longer lasting than those of almost all modern presidents.\"[541] While historians generally consider Carter a below-average president, his post-presidency activities have been universally praised, including his peacekeeping and humanitarian efforts.[534][535] The Independent wrote in 2009, \"Carter is widely considered a better man than he was a president.\"[542] In exit polls from the 1976 presidential election, many voters still held Ford's pardon of Nixon in 1974 against him.[543] By comparison, Carter was viewed as a sincere, honest, and well-meaning southerner.[542] During his presidency, polls generally showed that most Americans saw Carter as likable and \"a man of high moral principles\".[544] In the 1980 election, Reagan projected an easy self-confidence, in contrast to Carter's serious and introspective temperament. Carter was portrayed as more pessimistic and indecisive than Reagan, who was known for his charm and delegation of tasks to subordinates.[545] Reagan used the economic issues, the Iran hostage crisis, and the lack of Washington cooperation to portray Carter as a weak and ineffectual leader. Carter was the first elected incumbent president since Herbert Hoover in 1932 to lose a reelection bid.[546] Carter began his presidency with an approval rating between 66% and 75%.[547][548] He maintained approval ratings above 50% until March 1978,[548] and the following month his approval rating fell to 39%,[549] primarily due to the declining economy.[550] His ratings briefly rebounded after the Camp David Accords in late 1978[551] but dipped during the 1979 energy crisis and got as low as 28% in July 1979.[552] At the beginning of the Iran hostage crisis, his approval rating surged to 61%, up 23 points from his pre-crisis rating.[553] Polls also found that up to 77% of Americans approved of Carter's initial response to the crisis,[553] but by June 1980, amid heated criticism from across the political spectrum[554] for his failure to free the hostages, his approval rating slumped to 33%; that same month Reagan surpassed Carter in pre-1980 election polling.[555] As Carter was leaving office, a Gallup poll found that 48% of Americans thought he had been an \"average\" or \"above average\" president, 46% said he had been \"below average\" or \"poor\", and only 3% thought he had been \"outstanding\".[556] His average approval rating during his entire presidency was 46%,[557][558] and he left office as one of the most unpopular U.S. presidents in history.[559] In a 1990 Gallup survey, 45% of respondents said they approved of the overall job Carter did as president, leaving only Nixon and Lyndon B. Johnson with lower ratings.[560] In a 2006 poll, 61% of respondents said they approved of the job Carter did as president, his highest rating since 1979.[561] The next year, a Gallup survey found that 69% of respondents had a favorable opinion of Carter.[562] Carter received the American Academy of Achievement's Golden Plate Award in 1984.[144] The Jimmy Carter Library and Museum was opened in 1986.[563] The following year, the Jimmy Carter National Historical Park was established as a National Historic Site[564] and in 2021, renamed as a national historical park.[565] In 1991, Carter was made an honorary member of Phi Beta Kappa at Kansas State University,[566] and was elected to the American Philosophical Society.[567] In 1998, the U.S. Navy named the third and final Seawolf-class submarine USS Jimmy Carter, honoring Carter and his service as a submarine officer.[568] Carter received the United Nations Prize in the Field of Human Rights, given in honor of human rights achievements,[569] and the Hoover Medal, recognizing engineers who have contributed to global causes.[570] Carter's 2002 Nobel Peace Prize[571] was partially a response to president George W. Bush's threats of war against Iraq and Carter's criticism of the Bush administration.[572] In 2009, the Souther Field Airport in Americus, Georgia, was renamed Jimmy Carter Regional Airport.[573] In November 2024, Carter received his 10th nomination for the Grammy Award for Best Spoken Word Album for audio recordings of his books. He has won three times—for Our Endangered Values: America's Moral Crisis (2007), A Full Life: Reflections at 90 (2016), and Faith: A Journey For All (2018).[574][575][576][577][578][579] On February 21, 2024, the White House Historical Association unveiled its official 2024 White House Christmas ornament honoring Carter's naval service and efforts for peace. This was the first time a president being honored was alive at the time of the unveiling.[580]",

                "content": "The White House 1600 Pennsylvania Ave NW Washington, DC 20500 The 39th President of the United States The biography for President Carter and past presidents is courtesy of the White House Historical Association. Jimmy Carter served as the 39th President of the United States from 1977 to 1981. He was awarded the 2002 Nobel Peace Prize for work to find peaceful solutions to international conflicts, to advance democracy and human rights, and to promote economic and social development. Jimmy Carter aspired to make Government “competent and compassionate,” responsive to the American people and their expectations. His achievements were notable, but in an era of rising energy costs, mounting inflation, and continuing tensions, it was impossible for his administration to meet these high expectations. Carter, who has rarely used his full name–James Earl Carter, Jr.–was born October 1, 1924, in Plains, Georgia. Peanut farming, talk of politics, and devotion to the Baptist faith were mainstays of his upbringing. Upon graduation in 1946 from the Naval Academy in Annapolis, Maryland, Carter married Rosalynn Smith. The Carters have three sons, John William (Jack), James Earl III (Chip), Donnel Jeffrey (Jeff), and a daughter, Amy Lynn. After seven years’ service as a naval officer, Carter returned to Plains. In 1962 he entered state politics, and eight years later he was elected Governor of Georgia. Among the new young southern governors, he attracted attention by emphasizing ecology, efficiency in government, and the removal of racial barriers. Carter announced his candidacy for President in December 1974 and began a two-year campaign that gradually gained momentum. At the Democratic Convention, he was nominated on the first ballot. He chose Senator Walter F. Mondale of Minnesota as his running mate. Carter campaigned hard against President Gerald R. Ford, debating with him three times. Carter won by 297 electoral votes to 241 for Ford. Carter worked hard to combat the continuing economic woes of inflation and unemployment. By the end of his administration, he could claim an increase of nearly eight million jobs and a decrease in the budget deficit, measured in percentage of the gross national product. Unfortunately, inflation and interest rates were at near record highs, and efforts to reduce them caused a short recession. Carter could point to a number of achievements in domestic affairs. He dealt with the energy shortage by establishing a national energy policy and by decontrolling domestic petroleum prices to stimulate production. He prompted Government efficiency through civil service reform and proceeded with deregulation of the trucking and airline industries. He sought to improve the environment. His expansion of the national park system included protection of 103 million acres of Alaskan lands. To increase human and social services, he created the Department of Education, bolstered the Social Security system, and appointed record numbers of women, blacks, and Hispanics to Government jobs. In foreign affairs, Carter set his own style. His championing of human rights was coldly received by the Soviet Union and some other nations. In the Middle East, through the Camp David agreement of 1978, he helped bring amity between Egypt and Israel. He succeeded in obtaining ratification of the Panama Canal treaties. Building upon the work of predecessors, he established full diplomatic relations with the People’s Republic of China and completed negotiation of the SALT II nuclear limitation treaty with the Soviet Union. There were serious setbacks, however. The Soviet invasion of Afghanistan caused the suspension of plans for ratification of the SALT II pact. The seizure as hostages of the U. S. embassy staff in Iran dominated the news during the last 14 months of the administration. The consequences of Iran’s holding Americans captive, together with continuing inflation at home, contributed to Carter’s defeat in 1980. Even then, he continued the difficult negotiations over the hostages. Iran finally released the 52 Americans the same day Carter left office.

His father, James Earl Carter, Sr., was a farmer and businessman; his mother, Lillian Gordy Carter, a registered nurse. He was educated in the public school of Plains, attended Georgia Southwestern College and the Georgia Institute of Technology, and received a B.S. degree from the United States Naval Academy in 1946. In the Navy he became a submariner, serving in both the Atlantic and Pacific fleets and rising to the rank of lieutenant. Chosen by Admiral Hyman Rickover for the nuclear submarine program, he was assigned to Schenectady, New York, where he took graduate work at Union College in reactor technology and nuclear physics and served as senior officer of the pre-commissioning crew of the Seawolf, the second nuclear submarine. On July 7, 1946, he married Rosalynn Smith of Plains. When his father died in 1953, he resigned his naval commission and returned with his family to Georgia. He took over the Carter farms, and he and Rosalynn operated Carter's Warehouse, a general-purpose seed and farm supply company in Plains. He quickly became a leader of the community, serving on county boards supervising education, the hospital authority, and the library. In 1962 he won election to the Georgia Senate. He lost his first gubernatorial campaign in 1966, but won the next election, becoming Georgia's 76th governor on January 12, 1971. He was the Democratic National Committee campaign chairman for the 1974 congressional and gubernatorial elections. President Jimmy Carter On Dec. 12, 1974, he announced his candidacy for president of the United States. He won his party's nomination on the first ballot at the 1976 Democratic National Convention and was elected president on Nov. 2, 1976. Jimmy Carter served as president from Jan. 20, 1977 to Jan. 20, 1981. Significant foreign policy accomplishments of his administration included the Panama Canal treaties, the Camp David Accords, the treaty of peace between Egypt and Israel, the SALT II treaty with the Soviet Union, and the establishment of U.S. diplomatic relations with the People's Republic of China. He championed human rights throughout the world. On the domestic side, the administration's achievements included a comprehensive energy program conducted by a new Department of Energy; deregulation in energy, transportation, communications, and finance; major educational programs under a new Department of Education; and major environmental protection legislation, including the Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act, which doubled the size of the national park system and tripled the wilderness areas.

                "content": "James Earl Carter Jr. (October 1, 1924 – December 29, 2024) was an American politician and philanthropist. He was the 39th president of the United States from 1977 to 1981. He was a member of the Democratic Party. Before becoming president, Carter was a Georgia state senator from 1963 to 1967 and the 80th governor of Georgia from 1971 to 1975. He was born and grew up in Plains, Georgia. Carter graduated from the United States Naval Academy in 1946 with a Bachelor of Science degree and joined the United States Navy. In 1953, Carter left the military and returned home to Georgia to take charge of the family's peanut-growing business. Carter was against racial segregation and supported the growing civil rights movement. He became an activist in the Democratic Party. From 1963 to 1967, Carter was in the Georgia State Senate, and in 1970, he was elected as Governor of Georgia. He was governor until 1975. At first, he was not seen as a serious presidential candidate as not many people knew him outside of Georgia. Carter eventually won the 1976 Democratic presidential nomination and was elected president, beating then-Republican President Gerald Ford. On his second day in office, Carter pardoned all the Vietnam War draft evaders. During Carter's term as president, he created the Department of Energy and the Department of Education. He also created a national energy policy that included conservation, price control, and new technology. In foreign affairs, Carter helped create the Camp David Accords, the Panama Canal Treaties, the Strategic Arms Limitation Talks (SALT II), and the return of the Panama Canal Zone to Panama. However, the economy during his presidency was bad as it had stagflation, high inflation, high unemployment and slow economic growth. The end of his presidential term was remembered for the 1979–1981 Iran hostage crisis, the 1979 energy crisis, the Three Mile Island nuclear accident, and the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan. In 1980, Carter ran against Senator Ted Kennedy in the Democratic primaries and won re-nomination at the 1980 Democratic National Convention. Carter lost the 1980 presidential election. He lost to the Republican nominee Ronald Reagan, who won in a huge victory. Polls of historians and political scientists usually see Carter as an below-average president. He became more popular for his humanitarian work after leaving office. In 1982, Carter created the Carter Center to focus on human rights across the world. He traveled around the world to support peace talks, look over elections, and supported ending deadly diseases. In 2002, he won the Nobel Peace Prize. Carter was seen as an important person in the Habitat for Humanity charity. He wrote over 30 books from memoirs to poetry. Carter was the longest-lived president, the longest-retired president, the first to live forty years after their inauguration, and the first former president to reach the age of 100. Carter died on December 29, 2024 while in hospice care in Plains. Carter was born on October 1, 1924, at Lillian Carter Health and Rehabilitation in Plains, Georgia.[1] Carter was the first U.S. president to be born in a hospital.[2] He was the oldest son of Bessie Lillian (née Gordy) and James Earl Carter Sr.[3] The family moved many times when Carter was an infant.[4] The Carters settled on a dirt road in nearby Archery.[5] His family eventually had three more children: Gloria, Ruth, and Billy.[6] Carter had a good relationship with his parents even though his mother worked long hours, about twenty hours every day.[7] His father supported segregation, which allowed Carter to become friends with his family farm's Black workers.[8] Carter went to Plains High School from 1937 to 1941.[9] He also joined the Future Farmers of America and liked woodworking.[10][11] He also played basketball during his high school years.[8] After high school, Carter went to Georgia Southwestern College, in Americus, Georgia.[12] He took extra math classes at Georgia Tech.[13] In 1943, Carter was accepted to the United States Naval Academy.[14] While at the academy, Carter fell in love with Rosalynn Smith.[15] The two married shortly after his graduation in 1946.[15] He was a sprint football player for the Navy Midshipmen.[16] Carter graduated 60th out of 820 midshipmen in the class of 1946 with a Bachelor of Science degree and became an ensign.[17][18] From 1946 to 1953, Carter and Rosalynn lived in Virginia, Hawaii, Connecticut, New York and California, during his time in the Atlantic and Pacific fleets.[18] In 1948, he began officers' training for being in a submarine.[18] He was promoted to lieutenant junior grade in 1949.[18] In 1952, Carter began his work with the US Navy's nuclear submarine program.[19] He was sent to the Naval Reactors Branch of the Atomic Energy Commission in Washington, D.C. for three month.[20] During this time, Rosalynn moved with their children to Schenectady, New York.[19][20] In March 1953, Carter began nuclear power school at Union College in Schenectady.[21] Carter's father died and he was released from active duty to allow him to take over the family peanut business.[22] Carter left active duty on October 9, 1953.[22] He was not active at the Navy Reserve until 1961, and left the service as a lieutenant.[23] His awards included the American Campaign Medal, World War II Victory Medal, China Service Medal, and National Defense Service Medal.[24] Carter's father, James died after having recently been elected to the Georgia House of Representatives.[25] For a year, Jimmy, Rosalynn, and their three sons lived in public housing in Plains.[26] Carter is the only U.S. president to have lived in public housing before he took office.[26] Carter wanted to expand the family's peanut-growing business.[27] His first-year harvest failed because of droughts, however Carter wanted to open many bank lines of credit to keep the farm going.[27] He also took classes and read on agriculture while Rosalynn learned accounting to manage the business.[28] Even though they struggled at first, the Carters grew the peanut business and became successful.[27][28] Carter, who was against racial segregation, was inspired to run for office over the racial tensions in the country.[29] By 1961 he was a known member of the Plains community and the Baptist Church as well as chairman of the Sumter County school board.[30] At the school board, Carter spoke against racial segregation in public schools.[30] In 1962, Carter announced his run for a seat in the Georgia State Senate.[31] At first, the results showed Carter losing, but this was the result of fraudulent voting done by the Democratic Party chairman in Quitman County.[32] Carter challenged the results; when fraud was confirmed, a new election was held, which he won.[31] Beginning in 1962, Americus was known where black protesters were hit and abused.[33] Carter did not say anything about this at first.[34] He did speak about some race issues such as giving speeches against literacy tests and against a change to the state constitution.[34] When President John F. Kennedy was assassinated, Carter called it \"the greatest blow that I had suffered since my father died\".[35] Two years later, Carter was in charge of the Democratic Executive Committee, where he helped rewrite the state party's rules.[36] He became chairman of the West Central Georgia Planning and Development Commission.[36] When Bo Callaway was elected to the U.S. House of Representatives in November 1964, Carter wanted to run against him in the next election.[37] The two had fought over which two-year college would be expanded to a four-year college.[37] Carter wanted it to go to his alma mater, Georgia Southwestern College, but Callaway wanted the funding to go to downtown Columbus.[37] Carter was re-elected in 1964 to a second two-year term.[38] For a time in the State Senate, he was in charge of its Education Committee and also was part of the Appropriations Committee toward the end of his second term.[39] Before his term ended he worked on a bill expanding statewide education funding and getting Georgia Southwestern a four-year program.[40] The last day of the term, he announced his run for the United States House of Representatives.[41] Carter ran for the United States House of Representatives for Georgia's 3rd district in 1966 against Bo Callaway.[37] However, Callaway ended his campaign to run for Governor of Georgia.[37] Callaway became a Republican in 1964.[42] Carter later wanted to run for governor against Callaway.[37] In the Democratic primary, he ran against the liberal former Governor Ellis Arnall and the conservative Lester Maddox.[43] Governor Maddox was not allowed to run for a second term as governor in 1970.[44] Carter had to run against Carl Sanders in the 1970 Democratic primary.[45] Carter was more conservative than before during this primary election.[46] That September, Carter was beating Sanders in the first round by 49% to 38%.[47] Since no one won more than half the vote, they went into a second round.[47] Carter won the Democratic nomination with 59% of the vote against Sanders's 40%.[48] In the general election, Carter beat Republican candidate Hal Suit, winning 59% of the vote against Suit's 40%.[49] Carter became the 76th Governor of Georgia on January 12, 1971.[50] In his inaugural speech, he said that \"the time of racial discrimination is over. ... No poor, rural, weak, or black person should ever have to bear the additional burden of being [without] the opportunity for an education, a job or simple justice\".[50] Time ran a story on the progressive \"New South\" governors elected that year in a May 1971 cover.[51] The cover of the magazine had Carter.[51] Lester Maddox, who Carter replaced as governor, became lieutenant governor.[50] Richard Russell Jr., then President pro tempore of the United States Senate, died in office during Carter's second week in office.[52] Carter picked David H. Gambrell, state Democratic Party chair, to replace Russell's in the United States Senate.[52] Carter wanted to grow the governor's power while making the state government easier to run.[53] He supported a bill that could give him the power of executive restructuring and to force a vote on it.[53][54] The plan was not popular in the state legislature.[53] But after two weeks of talking about the plan, it was passed.[53] He lowered the number of state agencies from 300 to 22.[55] In April 1971, while on television, Carter was asked if he supported the idea of governor and lieutenant governor running together.[56] He said, \"I've never really thought we needed a lieutenant governor in Georgia. The lieutenant governor is part of the executive branch of government and I've always felt—ever since I was in the state Senate—that the executive branches should be separate\".[56] In July 1971, while in Columbus, Georgia, Carter created a Georgia Human Rights Council that would help solve issues in the state of any possible violence.[57] In January 1972, Carter wanted to give state money for an Early Childhood Development Program and prison reform programs.[58] In April 1972, Carter went to Latin and South America for a possible trade deal with Georgia.[59] Carter said that he had met with Brazilian President Emílio Garrastazu Médici.[59] Many said he was acting like President Kennedy.[59] The number of black state workers, judges, and board members grew when Carter was governor.[60] He put paintings of Martin Luther King Jr. in the capitol building, while the Ku Klux Klan were at the ceremony protesting.[61] While on television with Governor of Florida Reubin Askew in January 1973, Carter said he supported a constitutional amendment to ban busing and to make desegregation in schools faster.[62] He supported an anti-busing plan with George Wallace at the 1971 National Governors Conference.[63][64] Carter signed a new death penalty law after the United States Supreme Court rejected it.[65] Carter later said he did not support the death penalty, saying, \"I didn't see the injustice of it as I do now\".[65] Carter wanted to give equal state aid to schools in the rich and poor areas of Georgia.[66] He helped create centers for mentally handicapped children and education programs for convicts.[67][68] He also wrote a program that made picking federal judges based on their experience over their political party possible.[69][70] In an unpopular move,[71] Carter rejected a plan to build a dam on Georgia's Flint River.[72] He said that the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers was not giving the right numbers on the project's cost and possible harm on the region.[72] The veto became popular with environmentalists across the country.[72] Carter was not allowed to run for re-election because of term limits.[73] Wanting to run for president, Carter was active in national politics and public appearances.[74] He was a delegate to the 1972 Democratic National Convention, where Carter hoped he would be George McGovern's vice presidential pick.[74] He supported Senator Henry \"Scoop\" Jackson, to not support George Wallace.[75][76] In May 1973, Carter told the Democratic Party to not make the Watergate scandal a political issue.[77] On December 12, 1974, Carter announced his candidacy for President of the United States at National Press Club in Washington, D.C.[78] He talked about inequality, optimism, and change.[79][80] When Carter first announced his presidential run for the Democratic Party presidential nomination, he was seen as having little chances against better-known politicians.[81] However, by March 1976 Carter was doing better in polls against other candidates for the Democratic presidential nomination.[81] He was also ahead of President Ford by a few percentage points.[81] Carter wrote Why Not the Best? in June 1976 to help make his name known for the American public.[82] Carter won the Iowa caucuses and the New Hampshire primary.[81] In the South, Carter ran as a moderate and in the North, Carter ran as a conservative Christian.[83] He had visited 37 states, and gave over 200 speeches before any other candidate entered the race.[84] Carter ended up winning 30 states, with a total of 6,235,609 (39.2%) of the popular vote.[85] He was officially nominated as the Democratic nominee at the national convention.[86] He picked U.S. Senator Walter Mondale from Minnesota as his vice president pick.[86] During his presidential campaign in April 1976, Carter said to an interviewer, \"I have nothing against a community that is ... trying to maintain the ethnic purity of their neighborhoods\".[87] Carter said he understood why some neighborhoods were against desegregation.[87] However, he also supported open-housing laws that make it illegal not to sell or rent a house or apartment to a person based on their race.[87] His comments were unpopular with many Americans.[87] Carter's campaign supported congressional campaigns using public financing,[88] creating a federal agency for consumer protection,[89] creating a separate department for education,[90] signing an agreement that would stop the Soviet Union from using nuclear weapons,[91] lowering money given to the military,[92] increasing taxes for the rich and lowering them for the middle class,[93] supporting the Social Security Act,[94] and having a budget that would give money to government resources.[95] Carter and President Gerald Ford were in three televised debates during the 1976 election.[96] The debates were the first presidential debates since 1960.[96][97] Carter was interviewed by Robert Scheer of Playboy for the November 1976 issue, which hit the newsstands a couple of weeks before the election.[98] While discussing his religion's view of pride, Carter said: \"I've looked on a lot of women with lust. I've committed adultery in my heart many times\".[98][99] He also said in another interview that he did not mind if people said the word \"fuck\".[100] This led to a media to criticize the idea if politicians should be separated from their political campaigns and their private intimate lives.[100] Carter began the race with a lead over Ford, who narrowed the gap during the campaign, but lost to Carter in by a small margin on November 2, 1976.[101] Carter won the popular vote by 50.1 percent to 48.0 percent for Ford, and received 297 electoral votes to Ford's 240.[102] Carter won fewer states than Ford, with Carter winning 23 states compared to Ford winning 27.[102] Carter was inaugurated as president on January 20, 1977.[3] On April 18, 1977, Carter gave a televised speech saying that the U.S. energy crisis during the 1970s was like war.[103] He supported energy conservation by all Americans and added solar water heating panels on the White House.[104][105] He wore sweaters because he turned down the heat in the White House.[106] On August 4, 1977, Carter created the Department of Energy.[107] During the signing event, Carter said the current \"crisis of energy shortages\" made him create the Department of Energy.[108] Carter said that the House of Representatives had created many energy saving ideas.[109] A month later, on October 13, Carter stated he believed in the Senate's power to pass the energy reform bill.[110] He said that \"the most important domestic issue that we will face while I am in office\" was the energy crisis.[110] On January 12, 1978, during a press conference, Carter said plans about his energy reform proposal were not being made and that Congress was not being respectful.[111] In April 1978, Carter said his biggest surprise since becoming president was the how hard it was for Congress to pass an energy reform bill.[112] On March 1, 1979, Carter wanted to create a gasoline rationing plan with Congress approving it.[113] On April 5, he talked about how important energy conservation is.[114] At the end of the month, Carter said it was important that the Congress pass his gas rationing plan.[115] On July 15, 1979, Carter said the crisis was a \"crisis of confidence\" among the American people.[116][117] Many did not like Carter's speech.[118][119][120] People thought Carter for not doing enough to solve the crisis.[121] Many believed he wanted Americans to do most of the work instead of the government.[121] In 1978, Carter said the Love Canal accident in the city of Niagara Falls, New York was a federal emergency.[122] During the 1940s, the canal was used as the site to dump chemical products from dyes, perfumes, and solvents for rubber and synthetic resins.[123] More than 800 families were evacuated from the neighborhood, which was built on top of a toxic waste landfill.[122] The Superfund law was created because of Love Canal.[124] Carter said that many places like \"Love Canals\" existed across the country.[125] He said that discovering hazardous dumpsites was \"one of the [saddest] discoveries of our modern era\".[125] In 1979, the Environmental Protection Agency said that people living near the Love Canal accident were at risk for leukemia.[126][127][128] Carter had many problems with the economy when he became president.[129] He tried to continue the recovery from the severe 1973–75 recession.[130] His economy also had high inflation, with very high interest rates, oil shortages, and slow economic growth.[129] In his first two years, Carter created millions of new jobs.[131][132] The 1979 energy crisis ended job growth, however, and both inflation and interest rates rose.[133] Economic growth, job creation, and consumer confidence quickly went down.[133] There was also not a lot of gasoline because of the oil crisis.[134] Carter signed the Airline Deregulation Act into law on October 24, 1978.[135] The main purpose was to remove government control over fees, routes and airline market from commercial aviation.[135] The Civil Aeronautics Board's powers of regulation were removed.[135] The act did not remove the FAA's powers over airline safety.[136] In 1979, Carter deregulated the American beer industry by making it legal to sell malt, hops, and yeast to American home brewers for the first time since the beginning of Prohibition in the United States.[137] This led to an increase in home brewing over the 1980s and 1990s that by the 2000s.[138] During his presidential campaign, Carter wanted to fix healthcare in the country.[139] Carter's plans on healthcare included an April 1977 mandatory health care cost proposal,[140] and a June 1979 plan that gave private health insurance coverage.[141] Carter saw the June 1979 plan as a growing part of Medicare and Medicaid.[142][143] The April 1977 mandatory health care cost plan was passed in the Senate,[144] and later was not approved in the House.[145] During 1978, Carter also had meetings with Kennedy for a healthcare law that did not pass the U.S. House.[146] Carter later blamed Kennedy for his healthcare plans not being approved in Congress.[147] Carter worked with Congress to create an education department.[148] In February 1978, Carter said that education is very important and should not be in control over many departments.[149] On February 8, 1979, Carter released a plan to create an education department.[148] On October 17, 1979, Carter signed a law that created the United States Department of Education.[150] Carter grew the Head Start program by adding 43,000 children and families.[151] In a November 1980 speech, Carter said he would allow the Head Start to migrant children and wanted to increase building schools near the Mexico–United States border in Texas.[152] In September 1977, Carter and General Omar Torrijos signed the Panama Canal Treaty.[153] The treaties would give Panama control of the Panama Canal after 1999.[153] This would remove United States control of the canal.[153] The second treaty said that Panama would have full control of the canal.[153] The treaty was not popular with conservatives.[153] In September 1978, Carter created many political agreements between Egyptian President Anwar Sadat and Israeli Prime Minister Menachem Begin at Camp David.[154] The two agreements were signed at the White House.[154] The second of these frameworks helped create the 1979 Egypt–Israel Peace Treaty.[155] Carter spoke to African officials at the United Nations about his support of democratic elections and power in African countries.[156] Carter later said his plans for wanting \"to work with South Africa in dealing with the threats to peace in Namibia and in Zimbabwe\" and to end racial issues like apartheid.[157] Carter visited Nigeria from March 31 to April 3, 1978, trying to fix relations with the country.[158] He was the first U.S. president to visit Nigeria.[159] Carter wanted to create peace in Rhodesia.[160] On May 16, 1979, the Senate voted in favor of President Carter ending economic sanctions against Rhodesia.[161] In November 1977, Carter said he wanted to have a good partnership between the United States and Iran.[162] In November 1979, a group of Iranian students took over the United States Embassy in Tehran.[163] The students were in support of the Iranian Revolution.[163] 52 Americans were held hostage for the next 444 days until they were freed on January 20, 1981.[164] They were freed on the day Ronald Reagan replaced Carter as president.[164] During the crisis, Carter never left the White House for more than 100 days.[165] In December 1979, Carter said he wanted to solve the issue without using the military or violence.[166] On April 7, 1980, Carter passed Executive Order 12205, adding economic sanctions against Iran[167] and announced more action to make sure the hostages were released safely.[168][169] On April 24, 1980, Carter pushed for Operation Eagle Claw to try to free the hostages.[170] The mission failed as military helicopters crashed killing eight American military people.[170][171] Whistleblowers have said that people working on Ronald Reagan's campaign convinced Iran to not release the hostages to make sure Carter was not re-elected.[172] On February 8, 1977, Carter said he had wanted the Soviet Union to work with the United States to stop nuclear testing.[173] During a June 13 meeting, Carter said that the United States would begin to talk to the Soviet Union about demilitarization of the Indian Ocean.[174] On December 30, Carter said that the United States and the Soviet Union have made great progress on talking about important issues.[175] These talks helped create the Strategic Arms Limitation Treaty II by Carter and Leonid Brezhnev on June 18, 1979.[176][177] Nur Muhammad Taraki and other Communists took power in Afghanistan on April 27, 1978.[178] Following an uprising in April 1979, Taraki was removed by Khalq rival Hafizullah Amin in September.[179] By December, Amin's government had lost control of much of the country.[178] This caused the Soviet Union to invade Afghanistan.[178] Carter was surprised by the invasion.[180] The Soviet invasion of Afghanistan was seen as a threat and Carter saw the Soviet Union as dangerous.[181] Carter announced sanctions on the Soviet Union.[181][182] He created an embargo on grain to the Soviet Union.[183][184] Carter also supported not taking part of the 1980 Summer Olympics in Moscow.[185] British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher supported Carter's actions towards the Soviet Union.[186] In early 1980, Carter created a program to arm the mujahideen.[187] The Soviets were unable to fight off them off and left Afghanistan in 1989.[187] In March 1977, Carter supported removing American troops from South Korea.[188] He wanted South Korea to have their own military forces to protect themselves from North Korea.[188] Carter's move to remove the troops was unpopular with military officials.[189] In May, Carter said he believed South Korea would be able to defend themselves without as many American troops.[190] From June 30 to July 1, 1979, Carter had meetings with President of South Korea Park Chung-hee at the Blue House.[191] Carter said that the liberal part of the Democratic Party did not support his policies the most.[192] He said they were caused by Senator Ted Kennedy's plan to replace him as president.[192] Kennedy announced his plans to run for president in November 1979.[193][194][195] Kennedy did not run a good campaign and Carter won most of the primaries.[196] Carter won the Democratic re-nomination, however, Kennedy gave Carter weak support from the Liberal Democrats in the general election.[196] Carter and Vice President Walter Mondale were nominated at the Democratic National Convention in New York City.[197] Carter's campaign for re-election in 1980 was not easy as he ran against Republican Ronald Reagan.[198] His campaign manager and former appointments secretary, Timothy Kraft, left the campaign five weeks before the election because of possible cocaine use.[199] On October 28, Carter and Reagan had the only presidential debate of the election.[200] Reagan was losing to Carter at first,[201] but after the debates, Reagan became popular.[202] Carter lost his re-election to Reagan in a landslide victory.[198] Reagan won 489 of the electoral votes and Carter won 49.[198] After the election, Carter said that he was hurt by the outcome of the election.[203] Shortly after losing his re-election bid, Carter told the White House press corps that he wanted his retirement to be similar than that of Harry S. Truman and not use his public life to make himself rich.[204] In October 1986, his presidential library was opened in Atlanta, Georgia.[205] At aged 88, Carter built homes in the aftermath of Hurricane Sandy,[206] and partnered with former presidents to work with One America Appeal to help the victims of Hurricane Harvey and Hurricane Irma in the Gulf Coast and Texas communities.[207] Carter went to the opening ceremonies of his presidential library[205] and those of Presidents Ronald Reagan,[208] George H. W. Bush,[209] Bill Clinton,[210][211] and George W. Bush.[212] He gave eulogies at the funerals of Coretta Scott King[213] Gerald Ford,[214][215] Theodore Hesburgh,[216] and John Lewis.[217] He has gone to the state funeral of every former president since he left office: Nixon in 1994, Reagan in 2004, Ford in 2006 and Bush Sr. in 2018.[215][218][219] When going to the first inauguration of Donald Trump in 2017, he became the oldest former president to go to one.[220] In 1982, Carter founded the Carter Center,[221] a non-governmental and non-profit organization with the purpose of spreading human rights and end human suffering.[222] He wanted to help improve the quality of life for people in more than 80 countries.[223] In 1994, President Bill Clinton wanted Carter's help in a North Korea peace mission.[224][225] Carter talked with Kim Il-sung about a possible peace deal.[226] Carter went to North Korea to help release of Aijalon Gomes in August 2010.[227][228] In 2017, Carter said that he had talked to the Trump administration about having him talk to North Korea about peace.[229] In October 1984, Carter was named an honorary citizen of Peru.[230] Carter supported the country's elections in 2001,[231] and supported the Peruvian government after meeting President of Peru Alan García in April 2009, where he was honored with a medal.[232] In his February 1986 talks with Tomás Borge, Carter helped support the release of journalist Luis Mora and labor leader Jose Altamirano,[233] while in Nicaragua for three days.[234] Carter went to Cuba in May 2002 and talked to Fidel Castro.[235] He went to Cuba again for three days in March 2011.[236] Carter went to the Middle East in September 1981 meeting with Prime Minister of Israel Menachem Begin.[237] In March 1983, he went to Egypt to talk about the Palestine Liberation Organization.[238] In December 2008, he met with Syrian President Bashar al-Assad.[239][240] Carter went to Syria in April 2008,[241] visiting the grave of Yasser Arafat in Ramallah[242] and he said he was not working with the Bush administration about meeting with Hamas leaders.[243] In July 2007, Carter worked Nelson Mandela in Johannesburg, South Africa to create The Elders.[244] This group was meant focus on peace talks.[244][245] Carter wanted to travel to Zimbabwe to support human rights in November 2008, but was stopped by President Robert Mugabe's government.[246] Carter went to Egypt and Tunisia in 1995 and 1996 to talk about violence in the Great Lakes region of Africa.[247] He had an important role in talking about the Nairobi Agreement in 1999 between Sudan and Uganda.[248] During the presidency of George W. Bush, Carter was against the Iraq War.[249] He believed Bush wanted to remove Saddam Hussein by using lies.[250] In May 2007, Carter stated the Bush administration \"has been the worst in history\" in terms of its impact in foreign affairs,[251] Carter did not support Bush administration's handling of Hurricane Katrina.[252] Though he supported President Barack Obama in the early part of his presidency,[253] Carter criticized his use of drone strikes against suspected terrorists, Obama's choice to keep Guantanamo Bay detention camp open,[254] and use of surveillance programs.[255][256] In July 2016, Carter announced his support of former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton's presidential nomination during the 2016 Democratic National Convention.[257] Carter said that the 2016 election would \"define the US for a generation\".[257] He originally supported Vermont U.S. Senator Bernie Sanders and voted for him during the primaries in 2016.[258] During the Donald Trump presidency, Carter supported immigration reform through Congress,[259] and did not support Trump's response during the national anthem protests.[260] In September 2019, Carter said he would support an \"age-limit\" for presidential candidates.[258] In August 2020, he supported former Vice President Joe Biden for president during a video played at the 2020 Democratic National Convention.[261] In October 2024, weeks after turning 100, Carter voted for Vice President Kamala Harris in the 2024 presidential election by absentee ballot.[262] Carter and Rosalynn Smith had three sons, one daughter, eight grandsons, three granddaughters, and two great-grandsons.[263][264][265] Carter and Rosalynn were well known for their work as volunteers with Habitat for Humanity.[266] Carter's hobbies included painting,[267] fly-fishing, woodworking, cycling, tennis, and skiing.[268] He also liked poetry.[269] Carter was also a personal friend of Elvis Presley.[270] Carter and Rosalynn met him on June 30, 1973, before Presley was to perform onstage in Atlanta.[270] The day after Presley's death, Carter issued a statement and explained how he had \"changed the face of American popular culture\".[271] In 2000, Carter ended his membership with the Southern Baptist Convention, saying the group's ideas did not support with his Christian beliefs.[272] Carter became the oldest to ever attend a presidential inauguration in 2017, at age 92, and the first to live to the 40th anniversary of their own.[273][274] Two years later, on March 22, 2019, he became the nation's longest-lived president.[275] On October 1, 2019, Carter became the first U.S. president to live to the age of 95.[276] In May 2023, it was announced that his wife Rosalynn had dementia.[277][278] She entered hospice care alongside her husband on November 17, 2023,[279] and died two days later at the age of 96.[280] He went to her funeral in Atlanta on November 28 alongside all living former first ladies, former President Bill Clinton and President Joe Biden.[281] She was buried at their home that they built, where Carter also planned to be buried.[282] On October 1, 2024, Carter turned 100, the first president to do so.[283][284] On August 3, 2015, Carter had surgery to remove \"a small mass\" on his liver. On August 12, however, Carter announced he had been diagnosed with cancer that had metastasized.[285] On August 20, he said that melanoma had been found in his brain and liver.[286] On December 6, 2015, Carter said that his medical scans no longer showed any cancer.[287] On May 13, 2019, Carter broke his hip at his Plains home and had surgery in Americus, Georgia.[288] On October 6, 2019, Carter got 14 stitches above his left eyebrow after injuring it during another fall at home.[289] A few weeks later, Carter was hospitalized after having a minor pelvic fracture after falling again at home.[290] A month after his fall, Carter was hospitalized in November at the Emory University Hospital in Atlanta to relieve pressure on his brain.[291] The surgery was successful, and Carter was released from the hospital on November 27.[292][293] In February 2021, it was announced that Carter and his wife both received their doses of the COVID-19 vaccine.[294] In late February 2023, Carter stopped medical treatment and started hospice care at home.[295] He was being treated for an \"aggressive form\" of melanoma.[296] On March 13, 2023 it was revealed by President Joe Biden that Carter had asked him to deliver his eulogy after his death.[297] His grandson said in June 2024 that Carter is no longer awake every day.[298] Two months later, Carter said he hoped to vote for the Democratic nominee, Vice President Kamala Harris, in the 2024 presidential election.[299] Later that month, his grandson said that Carter was really sick, although he hoped to turn 100 years old and vote to in the 2024 election.[300] Carter died at his home in Plains on December 29, 2024, almost three months following his 100th birthday.[301][302][303] Shortly after his death, President Joe Biden honored Carter's legacy, calling him a \"man of principle, faith, and humility.\"[304] A state funeral will be held on January 9, 2025.[305] Carter's presidency was at first seen as unpopular in historical rankings of American presidents.[306][307][308] Although his presidency was unpopular, his peace and humanitarian works since he left office have made Carter one of the most popular former presidents in American history.[309][310] Carter's presidency was seen by scholars and many Democrats as a failure.[311][312][313][314] In a 1982 Chicago Tribune survey, when 49 historians and scholars were asked to rank the best and worst U.S. presidents, Carter was ranked the 10th worst.[315][316] The documentary Back Door Channels: The Price of Peace (2009) says that Carter's works at Camp David, which brought peace between Israel and Egypt, with bringing the only meaningful peace to the Middle East.[317][318] His post-presidency activities have been more popular with The Independent saying that \"Carter is widely considered a better man than he was a president.\"[319] His presidential approval numbers was just 31 percent before the 1980 election, but 64 percent approved of his presidency in a 2009 poll.[320] In Gallup's ratings of previous U.S. presidents, Carter's presidency had a favorability rating of 45% in 1990, which was below most other presidents and left only Richard Nixon and Lyndon B. Johnson with lower ratings.[321] In a 2018 retrospective poll, Carter's presidency received a 55% favorability rating, its highest since 1980.[322] Carter has had many awards since his presidency. In 1998, the U.S. Navy named the third and last Seawolf-class submarine honoring former President Carter and his service as a submariner officer.[323] That year he also received the United Nations Human Rights Prize, given in honor of human rights achievements,[324] and the Hoover Medal.[325] He won the 2002 Nobel Peace Prize.[326] Carter has been nominated ten times for the Grammy Award for Best Spoken Word Album for audio recordings of his books, and has won three times in 2007, 2016 and 2019.[327][328][329][330] In November 2024, at age 100, Carter got his tenth nomination.[331] This made him the oldest nominee ever.[331] The Souther Field Airport in Americus, Georgia was renamed Jimmy Carter Regional Airport in 2009.[332] Death and state funeral of Jimmy Carter Dunant / Passy (1901) · Ducommun / Gobat (1902) · Cremer (1903) · IDI (1904) · Suttner (1905) · Roosevelt (1906) · Moneta / Renault (1907) · Arnoldson / Bajer (1908) · Beernaert / Estournelles de Constant (1909) · IPB (1910) · Asser / Fried (1911) · Root (1912) · La Fontaine (1913) · International Committee of the Red Cross (1917) · Wilson (1919) · Bourgeois (1920) · Branting / Lange (1921) · Nansen (1922) · Chamberlain / Dawes (1925) Briand / Stresemann (1926) · Buisson / Quidde (1927) · Kellogg (1929) · Söderblom (1930) · Addams / Butler (1931) · Angell (1933) · Henderson (1934) · Ossietzky (1935) · Lamas (1936) · Cecil (1937) · Nansen Office (1938) · International Committee of the Red Cross (1944) · Hull (1945) · Balch / Mott (1946) · QPSW / AFSC (1947) · Boyd Orr (1949) · Bunche (1950) Jouhaux (1951) · Schweitzer (1952) · Marshall (1953) · UNHCR (1954) · Pearson (1957) · Pire (1958) · Noel‑Baker (1959) · Lutuli (1960) · Hammarskjöld (1961) · Pauling (1962) · International Committee of the Red Cross / League of Red Cross Societies (1963) · King (1964) · UNICEF (1965) · Cassin (1968) · ILO (1969) · Borlaug (1970) · Brandt (1971) · Kissinger / Le (1973) · MacBride / Sato (1974) · Sakharov (1975) B.Williams / Corrigan (1976) · AI (1977) · Sadat / Begin (1978) · Mother Teresa (1979) · Esquivel (1980) · UNHCR (1981) · Myrdal / García Robles (1982) · Wałęsa (1983) · Tutu (1984) · IPPNW (1985) · Wiesel (1986) · Arias (1987) · UN Peacekeeping Forces (1988) · Dalai Lama (1989) · Gorbachev (1990) · Suu Kyi (1991) · Menchú (1992) · Mandela / de Klerk (1993) · Arafat / Peres / Rabin (1994) · Pugwash Conferences / Rotblat (1995) · Belo / Ramos-Horta (1996) · ICBL / J.Williams (1997) · Hume / Trimble (1998) · Médecins Sans Frontières (1999) · Kim (2000) UN / Annan (2001) · Carter (2002) · Ebadi (2003) · Maathai (2004) · IAEA / ElBaradei (2005) · Yunus / Grameen Bank (2006) · Gore / IPCC (2007) · Ahtisaari (2008) · Obama (2009) · Xiaobo (2010) · Sirleaf / Gbowee / Karman (2011) · EU (2012) · Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (2013) · Yousafzai / Satyarthi (2014) · Tunisian National Dialogue Quartet (2015) · Juan Manuel Santos (2016) · International Campaign to Abolish Nuclear Weapons (2017) · Mukwege / Murad (2018) · Ahmed (2019) · World Food Programme (2020) · Ressa / Muratov (2021) · Bialiatski / Memorial / Center for Civil Liberties (2022) · Mohammadi (2023) · Nihon Hidankyo (2024)",

                "title": "Game recap: 5 takeaways from Packers’ loss to Vikings",
                "content": "packers.com editor MINNEAPOLIS – The Packers fell way behind and then rallied late, but it wasn't enough in a 27-25 defeat to the Vikings on Sunday at U.S. Bank Stadium. Here are five takeaways from the tough loss: Because the Vikings, after the Packers scored two touchdowns for 15 points to cut a 17-point deficit to two, got two first downs to run out the clock. The second one was converted on a third-and-3, the Packers' last chance to get the ball back, and QB Sam Darnold floated a pass in the flat that running back Cam Akers caught above his shoetops while falling backwards. The Vikings went into victory formation and the comeback went for naught. \"Our guys continue to fight and scratch and claw, but we just can't put ourselves in a hole like that,\" Head Coach Matt LaFleur said. \"It took too long to get going offensively, and that was the result.\" A fumble on the game's opening drive, a failed fourth down in scoring territory, two illegal formation flags that wiped out first downs, a 12-men-in-the-huddle penalty, and an offside on a missed field goal that gave the Vikings another crack at the kick on the final play of the first half … it all added up to a frustrating afternoon and, in the end, too much to overcome. LaFleur clearly disagreed with one of the illegal formation calls, as well as the offside on the field goal, but to no avail. Those occurred on back-to-back possessions late in the first half that helped end a Green Bay drive and give Minnesota three points for a 13-3 lead at intermission. The deficit then got worse when the Vikings scored a TD to open the second half. \"I'm not going to make excuses for it,\" LaFleur said of the flags. \"They saw it differently.\" Green Bay's defense was already shorthanded in the secondary due to injuries and then lost safety Zayne Anderson to a concussion early from a tackle on kickoff coverage. The thinning depth in the back end wasn't helped by a pass rush that struggled to get to Darnold, who was rarely pressured and sacked just once in 43 pass attempts. He completed an efficient 33 for 377 yards and three TDs, with one INT, for a 116.1 rating, generating several big gains downfield. \"You've got to get pressure on these guys if they're going to drop back that many times,\" LaFleur said. \"If you don't, it's going to be a long day. \"They've got a lot of weapons.\" Indeed, on a day the Packers stopped the Vikings' ground game for the most part (23 carries for 72 yards, not including kneel-downs), four pass catchers each compiled 68 or more yards for Darnold, led by Justin Jefferson with eight catches for 92 yards. Cornerback Carrington Valentine's interception in the third quarter set up running back Josh Jacobs' rushing touchdown to make it 20-10. Jacobs, who overcame the early fumble to gain 69 yards on 17 carries, scored a rushing TD for the seventh straight game, tying Paul Hornung's franchise record set in 1960. But the Vikings came right back with a touchdown to resume their 17-point lead. The Packers finally got going on offense, but it was sitting with just those 10 points through 3½ quarters that they most regret. LaFleur and QB Jordan Love discussed the Vikings playing more man coverage than they anticipated and the Packers being slow to adjust. But the other mistakes factored into missed chances, too, and the Packers were well under 200 yards of total offense until their two fourth-quarter TD drives. \"It's tough,\" said Love, who was 19-of-30 for 185 yards with a TD (to Malik Heath) and 91.7 rating. \"Obviously it ended up being a close game, but we know it's hard when you put yourself in a hole and are down early and shooting yourself in the foot. \"It's hard to get out of that hole, and when it's a good team like the Vikings that makes it even tougher.\" The loss dropped the Packers to 11-5 and took the No. 5 seed out of play for Green Bay. The Vikings improved to 14-2 and have a shot at the NFC's No. 1 seed and first-round bye when they play the Lions in the regular-season finale. Green Bay's seed will be determined, in part, by how Washington fares. The Commanders are also 11-5 following their Sunday night overtime win over the Falcons, and if they win in Week 18 over the Cowboys, they will be the No. 6 seed and the Packers will get the No. 7. If the Packers win and the Commanders lose, Green Bay gets the No. 6 seed. Regardless, the Packers already knew they'd have to be road warriors in the postseason, and that won't change no matter what happens against the Bears next week. \"That's going to be our reality,\" Love said. \"We're going to have to find ways when the playoffs start to go into these road atmospheres and win.\" Week 18 to determine Green Bay's playoff seeding Team knows it's up to them to change the narrative after fourth division loss Green Bay's second-half rally not enough vs. Vikings It's almost do-or-die time Late rally by Green Bay comes up short Follow the Green Bay Packers vs. Minnesota Vikings game with live updates from U.S. Bank Stadium Team will rotate captains on a weekly basis Rookie safety back after missing last two games for Packers Green Bay Packers vs. Minnesota Vikings channel listing, radio & streaming options Green Bay announces roster move ahead of Sunday's matchup vs. Vikings Kevin O'Connell's early tenure similar to Matt LaFleur's in one-possession contests COPYRIGHT © GREEN BAY PACKERS, INC.",

                "content": "If not listed, please contact your TV provider. MINNEAPOLIS -- The Minnesota Vikings got a big lead on the rival Green Bay Packers back in September, going up 28-0 before nearly coughing up the advantage entirely. Three months later, they offered up a sequel for the U.S. Bank Stadium crowd, nearly surrendering a 27-10 fourth-quarter lead before outlasting their NFC North rivals for a critical 27-25 victory, their ninth straight on the 2024 season. Sam Darnold turned in an MVP-caliber performance to help Minnesota dominate much of the afternoon, while Brian Flores' defense suffocated Jordan Love and Co. until the final quarter, when Green Bay surged back to life thanks to a couple of surgical drives through the air. Vikings kicker Will Reichard also contributed to the game's close finish, missing two of four field goals while also failing to hit the landing zone on a kickoff, granting the Packers favorable field position. Sunday's anticipated showdown started slowly, with both sides trading stingy defensive stands, but Darnold settled in after feeding speedy wide receiver Jalen Nailor, who saw an uptick in opportunities with Green Bay zeroing in on star pass catcher Justin Jefferson. From there, he had little trouble spreading the ball to the array of weapons in Kevin O'Connell's lineup, with Jefferson, Jordan Addison and T.J. Hockenson all corralling at least five catches against a \"D\" missing star corner Jaire Alexander. Flores' group, meanwhile, all but rendered the Packers' pass game a non-factor early. Missing deep threat Christian Watson, Love managed just 45 yards through the air in the game's first two quarters, and while bruising back Josh Jacobs had a heavy workload up the middle, Green Bay spent most of the rematch playing catch-up. Things finally clicked late, with Love guiding a pair of fourth-quarter touchdown drives while feeding Romeo Doubs, but it was too little, too late. The win bumps the Vikings to 14-2 on the season and sets up a winner-take-all against the Lions in Week 18 for the NFC North title and home-field advantage. It also drops the Packers to 11-5 in the North. Take your pick of Darnold's pretty throws, basically. This one to Addison helped give Minnesota a 20-3 advantage, showcasing the quarterback's steadiness as a pocket-climber and downfield thrower: The Vikings (14-2) will close their 2024 season with a pivotal Week 18 rematch in Detroit, where they'll fight the Lions (13-2) for the No. 1 seed in the NFC playoffs, plus the NFC North crown. The Packers (11-5), meanwhile, will finish their regular season against the Chicago Bears (4-12), who fell to the Seattle Seahawks in an ugly 6-3 contest in Week 17. It wasn't pretty late, but Minnesota pulls it off, sealing the deal by getting a first down on a Sam Darnold-to-Cam Akers dump-off. Jordan Love's late-game heroics were strong, but it was too little, too late for Green Bay. The Vikings officially improve to 14-2, while the Packers drop to 11-5. What a finish. Wow. Down 20-3 earlier, the Packers are suddenly within two points after Jordan Love orchestrates a beautiful nine-play scoring series. Feeding his entire makeshift receiving corps, including Romeo Doubs, Bo Melton and Dontayvion Wicks, he ultimately hits Malik Heath over the middle for the score. It's now 27-25 Vikings, and Minnesota has a chance to seal it by moving the chains on the ensuing drive. But things suddenly look tight, and the Vikings' errors on the margins could come back to bite them; they had 12 men on the field on the Packers' score, and kicker Will Reichard's two field goal misses look even more glaring now. Don't turn this one off just yet. The Vikings have been dominating, but seemingly out of nowhere Matt LaFleur produces a nine-play, 67-yard scoring series headlined by a couple of long strikes from Jordan Love -- first to Bo Melton, then to Tucker Kraft. Josh Jacobs and Emanuel Wilson then share touches on the ground, with the latter powering forward for the score. It's 27-18 after Love finds Romeo Doubs for the two-point try, meaning Green Bay isn't done yet. Brian Flores' secondary nowhere to be found on this drive. The Vikings have a chance to go up 30-10, but Will Reichard bangs a 43-yard field goal off the uprights. He's now missed two of four field goal tries on the day. Probably the only blemish for Minnesota thus far. Green Bay has nowhere to run, nowhere to hide. Down 27-10 with the clock ticking in the fourth, Jordan Love's pocket collapses and Andrew Van Ginkel sandwiches him for the sack to force a punt. That means the Packers went backwards two yards on their six-play series. They have just nine first downs on the day. We can't call this one yet, because the Pack did threaten a comeback against these Vikings despite falling behind 28-0 in their September meeting, but boy does this one look good for Minnesota. Sam Darnold is 21 of 22 on passes between the numbers against the Packers, per ESPN. In other words, the Vikings are absolutely killing it over the middle of the field. Green Bay not having Quay Walker and Jaire Alexander hasn't helped. It's partly why everything's coming up purple in this one. Everybody eats in Minnesota! Sam Darnold slings another beauty to Jordan Addison, who's up to six catches on the day, and after a couple of Aaron Jones tosses, Cam Akers gets the dump-off screen, fighting through a few would-be tacklers to reach the end zone and put the Vikings up 27-10. The Packers have no answers for the wide array of weapons. Minnesota now has 22 first downs to Green Bay's eight, and owns the time-of-possession battle 27:33 to 16:36. It's been a one-sided affair except for the one Darnold pick. Four plays after Carrington Valentine's interception of Sam Darnold, the Packers score their first touchdown of the day, feeding Josh Jacobs at the goal line. It's now 20-10 Vikings, and we've got ourselves a ballgame. Jeff Hafley's \"D\" had struggled to get off the field for a while, so perhaps this will turn the tide. Absolutely desperate for a big play, Green Bay gets one on the defensive side, baiting Sam Darnold into a sideline shot. Aiming for T.J. Hockenson with pressure in his face, Darnold instead zips it to Packers cornerback Carrington Valentine, with star safety Xavier McKinney also in the area. The much-needed takeaway puts Green Bay in scoring range about halfway through the third. Christian Watson's injury-related absence is being felt by the Packers offense. Jordan Love has just a single pass completion over 10 yards in this game. Nobody's really separating downfield, and while Matt LaFleur's focus has been on wearing down Minnesota with Josh Jacobs, that approach isn't necessarily ideal when you're down 20-3. The Packers need a splash play in a hurry. Jordan Love may have the most gifted arm in the NFC North, but it's yet to matter today. After finding Jalen Nailor for another big gain, Sam Darnold stands tall amid pressure off the edge and threads a perfect downfield end-zone shot to Jordan Addison, making up for an earlier deep shot that got broken up. Rookie safety Javon Bullard is on the wrong end of the pass coverage for Green Bay, and all of a sudden Minnesota leads this by three scores. That's passing touchdown No. 34 for Darnold on the year. Will Reichard misses from 55 yards out on a last-second field goal try, but the Packers get flagged for offsides, giving the Vikings a second chance at extra points. Reichard delivers from 50, and we go into the break with Minnesota up 10 points, owning a 13-3 advantage. Credit to Brian Flores' defense for really limiting the Jordan Love-led aerial attack thus far. Sam Darnold also looks especially sharp, even with Justin Jefferson blanketed by the Green Bay secondary, zipping some chain-moving darts into tight windows. Jalen Nailor is up to 59 yards on four catches as Sam Darnold's top target in lieu of Justin Jefferson drawing extra attention from the Packers. His latest reception, a 16-yarder, comes in a tight window and helps set up a 25-yard Will Reichard field goal, and we've got ourselves a 10-3 ballgame in favor of Minnesota. That scoring drive goes 69 yards over 10 plays. Halftime is fast approaching. Josh Jacobs gets a big workload on Green Bay's latest series, and the Packers push the rock to the Vikings 23, but on fourth-and-3, Jordan Love gets jumpy in the pocket and can't quite connect with Jayden Reed over the middle. Reed has yet to secure a catch on the day, and the ball goes back to Minnesota. Love is 7 of 11 for 45 yards so far, and only Dontayvion Wicks has more than one catch. Most of Matt LaFleur's attack has centered on Jacobs' bruising ground game. The Vikings are toughing it out. Injury alert: Vikings edge rusher Pat Jones II walks off after taking a shot to the knee from Packers tight end Tucker Kraft. Required some attention from trainers before limping his way to the sidelines. Justin Jefferson is getting almost no looks as the Packers focus their attention on the Vikings' top pass catcher, but that opens the door for Jalen Nailor, who outraces the entire Green Bay secondary for a 31-yard score. That's Sam Darnold's 33rd touchdown pass of the year, and it puts the Vikes up 7-3 in this one. Josh Jacobs rumbles into Minnesota territory with another strong dose of touches, but the Vikings hold firm inside the 10, with Josh Metellus stuffing Luke Musgrave on third down. So Green Bay goes up first but settles for a 22-yard field goal from Brandon McManus. It's 3-0 Packers at U.S. Bank Stadium. This one's been a gritty defensive affair thus far, with Brian Flores and Jeff Hafley both showcasing strong stuff. Jordan Addison burns Keisean Nixon on the outside for a potential score, but Sam Darnold floats it high rather than with velocity, and Nixon makes a leaping recovery to break up the connection. Then Will Reichard boots a field goal try from 57 yards out, and it bounces off the crossbar. So we're still at 0-0 here. Darnold is facing some heat up the middle from the Packers front. Green Bay takes to the air on its second series, perhaps as a response to Josh Jacobs' early fumble, and Jordan Love tries for three straight downfield shots, nearly connecting with Dontayvion Wicks. But the passes are just off, and the last one is nearly picked by Harrison Smith over the middle. So it's a punt, and the Vikings are back in control. Three drives so far, and three defensive stands. Josh Jacobs' fumble put Minnesota in a great position near midfield, but Jeff Hafley's defense shows up, putting pressure in Sam Darnold's face on back-to-back plays to force a punt. Kenny Clark got the first pressure, and Rashan Gary nearly came up with a sack on third down. Green Bay starts strong with a couple of tough Josh Jacobs carries and a quick first-down catch by Dontayvion Wicks, but then Jacobs coughs up the ball on a hit from Jerry Tillery. Vikings safety Cam Bynum (who else?) jumps on it, and we've got out first turnover already. Former Vikings Pro Bowl defensive lineman Pat Williams shows up at U.S. Bank Stadium to blow the pregame Gjallarhorn ahead of the opening kickoff. A \"Skol\" chant follows, and we're ready to go. The Packers win the coin toss and elect to receive the ball. It's Jordan Love up first in Minnesota. The fake snow is falling inside U.S. Bank Stadium as the Vikings and Packers prepare to take the field. Live from U.S. Bank Stadium, we've got you covered with all the key notes and analysis from today's matchup. First up: The Packers are without some big names in Minnesota, with Jaire Alexander, Christian Watson and Quay Walker among notable inactives. © 2004-2024 CBS Interactive. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.

                "content": "If not listed, please contact your TV provider. PHILADELPHIA -- In a battle of backup quarterbacks, the host Philadelphia Eagles (13-3) had the definitive edge over the Dallas Cowboys (7-9) as they dominated in a decisive 41-7 Week 17 victory. They clinched the 2024 NFC East division title with the win. It's their first division title since 2022, a year that ended with them as the Super Bowl runner up. It's also their 11th NFC East division title since 2001, which is the most in the division in that span. Philadelphia also now has their fourth ever 13-win season, which is key because they have reached the Super Bowl in each of the last three occurrences (2004, 2017, 2022). After two three-and-outs to start the game, the Eagles scored on their next six drives -- four touchdowns and two field goals. Philadelphia also secured its first sweep of the Cowboys since 2011. Eagles quarterback Kenny Pickett, the 2022 first-round pick of the Pittsburgh Steelers who is filling in for an injured Jalen Hurts (concussion), produced a strong performance. He threw for 143 yards and a touchdown on 10 of 15 passing while adding a 1-yard rushing score via the tush push to end the first half. He threw a 22-yard scoring strike to Eagles wide receiver DeVonta Smith with 6:38 left in the half after Smith cooked backup Cowboys corner Andrew Booth by multiple steps for the touchdown. Pickett exited the game early in the third quarter after aggravating his ribs injury on a late hit by Dallas defensive tackle Osa Odighizuwa, who was penalized for roughing the passer. He clearly hit Pickett late after the football was gone. As a result, Eagles third-string quarterback Tanner McKee, a 2023 sixth-round pick out of Stanford, subbed into the game. McKee's first full drive ended with him throwing his first NFL regular-season touchdown pass to Eagles No. 1 receiver A.J. Brown on a 20-yard scoring strike. Brown got a stop on Cowboys All-Pro corner DaRon Bland, and McKee threw a perfectly placed pass over Brown's outside shoulder for the touchdown. That increased the Eagles' lead to 34-7 over the Cowboys with 2:44 left in the third quarter. He then hit Smith on an underneath throw, and he took the football all the way to the house with ease for a 25-yard receiving touchdown. McKee finished with 54 yards passing and two touchdowns on 3 of 4 passing, and Smith totaled 120 yards receiving and two touchdowns on six catches. Cowboys quarterback Cooper Rush, their eight-year veteran backup who is filling in for an injured Dak Prescott (hamstring tear), played slightly better than his first start of the season back in Week 10, a 34-6 home defeat against the Eagles. He threw a 69-yard pick six to Philadelphia safety C.J. Gardner-Johnson on the opening drive of the game, but he bounced back to throw a 4-yard goal-line fade touchdown to Dallas wide receiver Jalen Tolbert on the game's second possession. At the end of the first half, Rush sailed a deep throw intended for wide receiver Brandin Cooks on third-and-5, and Gardner-Johnson picked him off for the second time. He returned the football down to the Eagles' 35-yard line with 36 seconds left in the half. It's Gardner-Johnson's second career game with multiple interceptions, and both have come against the Cowboys. Rush finished the game with 147 yards, a touchdown and two interceptions on 15 of 28 passing. With a massive lead, 2024 NFL rushing yards leader Saquon Barkley was able to take over in the second half. He went off for 167 yards on 31 carries Sunday afternoon to become the ninth player in NFL history to register at least 2,000 rushing yards in a single season. Here are the five main takeaways from the Eagles' Week 17 victory: The Eagles defense took a massive hit once Gardner-Johnson was ejected from last Sunday's loss to the Washington Commanders as a result of two unsportsmanlike conduct penalties. Gardner-Johnson's ejection certainly affected how the Eagles defense played Jayden Daniels, who was 16 of 24 for 150 yards and three touchdowns to one interception (105.9 passer rating) after the defender's disqualification. The Commanders scored 22 fourth-quarter points in the comeback victory, all with Gardner-Johnson off the field. Gardner-Johnson was back for this game and made an impact on the first series. On third-and-3 from the Eagles' 35-yard line, Cowboys quarterback Cooper Rush threw a pass across the middle of the field and Gardner-Johnson read it for the interception. He took the takeaway 69 yards the other way for a touchdown to give the Eagles an early 7-0 lead with 11:55 remaining in the first quarter. Gardner-Johnson later had his second interception that set the Eagles up for a touchdown in the final seconds of the first half. The Eagles had three takeaways in the first half, all of which led to points. Even when Gardner-Johnson is struggling in coverage, he's making turnover-worthy plays for the Eagles to change the course of a game. In 28 games with the Eagles, Gardner-Johnson has 12 interceptions (6+ in each season played). He's a difference maker on this defense. Whatever the scripted game plan was in the first quarter of Pickett's start (filling in for Jalen Hurts as he was ruled out with a concussion), it wasn't what the Eagles were hoping for. A Landon Dickerson false start on the first play based the Eagles up to a first-and-15. Two incomplete passes and a checkdown to Kenneth Gainwell resulted in the first Eagles three-and-out. On the Eagles' second offensive possession, Pickett didn't even throw the football. With DeVonta Smith on the sidelines (wrist injury), the Eagles had Saquon Barkley carry the ball on three consecutive plays -- one via direct snap -- before choosing to punt on fourth-and-1 on their own 46-yard line. The decision to punt showed a lack of trust in Pickett to get the first down, with his arm or legs, or hand the ball off and get the first down. Six plays for 14 yards on the Eagles' first two series, and a lack of trust in Pickett. Different quarterback, same slow start. The Eagles opened things up for Pickett on the third drive, as he went 6 of 6 for 72 yards and a touchdown -- a 22-yard pass to DeVonta Smith. In the second quarter, 8 of 11 for 128 yards with a touchdown for a 141.5 passer rating. This doesn't include the rushing touchdown he had to get the Eagles up 24-7 at halftime. Pickett found an early connection with Smith once the Eagles opened up the passing game, hitting him three times for 74 yards and a score -- including a 49-yard pass to Smith that resulted in the 1-yard touchdown run just before the half. While it took the Eagles three series to get Pickett comfortable, opening things up for the quarterback certainly sparked the offense. Pickett left the game with a rib injury in the third quarter, yet the Eagles offense didn't miss a beat once third-string quarterback Tanner McKee entered the game. McKee, elevated to the No. 2 quarterback with Hurts out, threw a 20-yard touchdown pass to A.J. brown to put the Eagles up 34-7 late in the third quarter. The Eagles had a run-heavy offense once McKee entered the game with a big lead, yet he went 2 of 3 for 29 yards and a touchdown pass to Brown on his first series. He then followed with a 25-yard touchdown pass to DeVonta Smith on his second series, going 3 of 4 for 54 yards and two touchdowns for a 154.2 rating on his first two series. Whether it was Pickett or McKee, the Eagles offense was clicking from the second quarter on. Barkley reached the 2,000-yard rushing plateau on Sunday, becoming the ninth running back to amass 2,000 rushing yards in a season. He's eighth all-time for rushing yards in a season with 2,005. The chase is officially on in regards to Dickerson's record. Barkley finished with 31 carries for 167 yards, averaging 5.4 yards per carry. putting himself in striking distance of the mark. Dickerson rushed for 2,105 yards in 1984 and Barkley is 101 yards away from passing him. Barkley is averaging 125.3 rushing yards per game this season, which would put him on pace to pass Dickerson. Will the Eagles play him in Week 18? The 2,000-yard plateau was a goal of Barkley's and he achieved it. Just 101 yards away from Dickerson is approachable, even if the Eagles do play a meaningless game in Week 18. One of the hardest records in sports is Dickerson's rushing record. This mark can be broken if the Eagles decide to play barkley in Week 18, but it will likely be his call. The Cowboys have inserted 2021 third overall pick quarterback Trey Lance into the game with 2:24 left to play. Cowboys wide receiver Jalen Brooks and Cowboys cornerback Troy Pride, along with Eagles cornerback Sidney Brown, were ejected for fighting. Cowboys All-Pro kicker Brandon Aubrey drills a 61-yard field goal off the right upright for a missed field goal. The Eagles take over at the Cowboys' 49 up 41-7 with 4:40 left to play. Eagles wide receiver DeVonta Smith caught an underneath pass from Tanner McKee and left the Dallas defense in the dust for a 25-yard receiving touchdown, his second score of the day. The Eagles lead 41-7 with 10:03 left to play. Utter domination. Eagles running back Saquon Barkley is now up to 2,005 rushing yards, and he is the ninth player in NFL history to run for over 2,000 yards in a single season. Dallas commits their fourth turnover of the day with running back Rico Dowdle fumbling on third-and-5. Philadelphia linebacker Nolan Smith forced the fumble, and Eagles cornerback Cooper DeJean recovered the loose ball. Philadelphia takes over at their own 25 up 34-7 with 14:20 left in the game. Tanner McKee threw his first NFL regular season touchdown pass to Eagles No. 1 receiver A.J. Brown for a 20-yard scoring strike. Brown got a step on Cowboys All-Pro corner DaRon Bland, and McKee threw a perfectly placed pass over Brown's outside shoulder for the touchdown. The Eagles lead 34-7 over the Cowboys with 2:44 left in the third quarter. Eagles backup quarterback Kenny Pickett (ribs) is officially questionable to return. He initially suffered a ribs injury a week ago against the Washington Commanders. Third-string quarterback Tanner McKee is primed to lead this drive after the Cowboys went run-run-pass for a three-and-out on their latest drive. The Eagles lead 27-7 with 6:34 left in the third quarter. An A.J. Brown receiving touchdown gets nullified by a holding penalty on Landon Dickerson trying to contain Cowboys All-Pro edge rusher Micah Parsons. Eagles quarterback Kenny Pickett suffered an injury on the play, and Philadelphia subbed in third-stringer Tanner McKee to take the snap on third-and-goal from the Cowboys' 17. He handed off to Barkley for a gain of nine, and the Eagles took three more points on a 26-yard field goal. Philadelphia leads 27-7 with 8:03 left in the third quarter. The Eagles are marching up the field with ease to start the second half. Following a near interception by Pickett, it's been all runs by Saquon Barkley. A disaster for Dallas on their last drive of the half. Quarterback Cooper Rush sailed a deep throw intended for wide receiver Brandin Cooks on third-and-5, and Eagles safety C.J. Gardner-Johnson picked off Rush for the second time. He returned the football down to the Eagles' 35 with 36 seconds left in the half. It's Gardner-Johnson's second career game with multiple interceptions, and both have come against the Cowboys. Philly extends their lead to 10, 17-7, following Jake Elliott's 31-yard field. They can double dip with points since they start the second half with the football. Dallas has 1:55 on the clock and one timeout left. The Cowboys commit their second turnover of the half with tight end Jake Ferguson getting stripped by Eagles linebacker Oren Burks. Philadelphia defensive tackle Jordan Davis recovered the loose ball for the takeaway. Philadelphia takes over at the Cowboys' 39 up 14-7 with 6:27 left to play. The Eagles crowd is now chanting \"Dallas sucks.\" Dallas' lack of depth at cornerback because of injuries was just on full display. Eagles wide receiver DeVonta Smith cooked backup corner Andrew Booth with ease, getting open by multiple steps, which is how Philadelphia fill-in quarterback Kenny Pickett was able to hit him for a 22-yard touchdown. Philadelphia is back in front by seven, 14-7, with 6:38 left in the first half. The Cowboys take a deep shot down the left sideline to wide receiver Jonathan Mingo on third-and-1 instead of running with Dowdle, and it doesn't work. Mingo cooked Eagles first-round rookie corner Quinyon Mitchell, but he couldn't track Rush's throw. That led to the football harmlessly hitting the ground for an incompletion. Dallas punts it away, and Philadelphia fair-caught the football at their own 19. It's seven to seven with 12:49 left in the first half. After NFL rushing yards leader Saquon Barkley didn't touch the football on the Eagles' opening drive, the Eagles gave up three consecutives runs. However, he netted nine yards, and the Eagles punted the football away for a touchback. Philadelphia decided they would take their chances vs. Cooper Rush instead of potentially giving Dallas a short field if they bungled a fourth down attempt with Kenny Pickett at quarterback. It's a 7-7 game with 56 seconds left in the first quarter. Dallas goes three-and-out up against their own goal line, and they punt it away. The Cowboys got good hang time on the punt, so they were able to limit returner Cooper DeJean to just a yard on the return. The Eagles will have their second offensive possession starting at their own 37 in a 7-7 game with 2:48 left in the first quarter. Following a first down false start penalty, Eagle backup quarterback Kenny Pickett threw two consecutive incompletions, and then a short five-yarder to running back Kenneth Gainwell. Philadelphia goes three-and-out to start, and Dallas gets the football back on their own nine after a 52-yard punt by the Eagles. Eagles edge rusher Bryce Huff (shoulder) is questionable to return. Cooper Rush bounced back in a big way from his pick-six by capping the Cowboys' ensuing drive with a four-yard touchdown pass on a goal line fade to wide receiver Jalen Tolbert. Dallas continues to fight for head coach Mike McCarthy. This game is tied at seven with 5:38 left in the first quarter. Kenny Pickett and the Eagles offense will take the field for the first time today up next. With All-Pro wide receiver CeeDee Lamb out, Brandin Cooks is the Cowboys' clear cut No. 1 option in the passing game early on. Quarterback Cooper Rush has targeted him five times already, and Cooks has hauled in two of them for 38 yards, including 22 yards on the last play to move the chains on a third-and-9. Cooper Rush had been on a roll with wins in four of the last five games, which included a stretch of nine touchdowns to one interception, but he makes a critical error on the opening drive. He looked to force the football to Brandin Cooks on a third-and-3, but Eagles safety C.J. Gardner-Johnson jumped the route and took it all the way back for a 69-yard pick-six. It's Philadelphia's first defensive touchdown of the season, and the Eagles now lead 7-0 with 11:43 left in the first quarter. The Cowboys offense led by quarterback Cooper Rush and running back Rico Dowdle start with the football first. Cowboys three-time All-Pro edge rusher Micah Parsons has helped power a defensive renaissance in Dallas sparked by his return from his high ankle sprain along with an increased comfort in defensive coordinator Mike Zimmer's scheme in his first season working with the Cowboys defense after playing the last three under Dan Quinn, who is now the Washington Commanders head coach. He leads the NFL in both sacks (8.5) and quarterback pressures (42) since Week 10, and as a result, the Cowboys defense is one of the NFL's most disruptive in that span, ranking top five in the entire NFL in third down conversion rate allowed (35%, fifth-best in the NFL), sacks (28, best in the NFL), sack rate (10.4%, best in the NFL), quarterback pressure rate (39.3%, fifth-best in the NFL) and takeaways (15, tied for the second-most in the NFL). Cowboys All-Pro kicker Brandon Aubrey has made 36 field goals thus far in 2024. With just one more made field goal on Sunday in Philadelphia, Aubrey will set the franchise single season record for makes in a season, which would break a tie with his own record of 36 that he set in his first year last season in 2023. Cowboys running back Rico Dowdle is 97 rushing yards away from his first 1,000-yard season. If he accomplishes the feat on Sunday in Philadelphia, it would make him the first undrafted player in Cowboys history to rush for 1,000 yards in a season. Since Week 9, Dowdle ranks second in the NFL with 494 rushing yards after contract, trailing only Saquon Barkley's 566 in that span, according to Pro Football Focus. Dallas Cowboys three-time All-Pro edge rusher Micah Parsons knows he gave the Philadelphia Eagles (12-3), Dallas' Week 17 opponent, bulletin board material last week. \"Nah, at this point, it's f--- Philly, now,\" Parsons said on Dec. 19. \"Even if we got eliminated, like, I got to crush Philly. F--- them. I hate them now. I be seeing them just talking so much on socials. I don't know, my Twitter page got consumed by Philly [fans]. Man, ugh. They say don't look forward to some things, but I'm excited about the matchup [next week in Week 17], too.\" This Thursday, he acknowledged that beating the Eagles on Sunday would \"probably\" make their year. \"That probably makes the year you know what I'm saying? That sets everything off,\" Parsons said when asked how it would feel to beat the Eagles on Sunday. \"Us getting that win, away game in Philly. Knowing how they're trying to get the No. 1 seed. Can set them back a little bit. They're fighting for everything. They're fighting for where they want to be in the playoffs. We're just fighting to whoop them. They got more to lose than we do, so that'll be a great feeling right there.\" Check out his full remarks below. After two consecutive losses in Rush's first two starts this season versus the Eagles (34-6) and versus the Houston Texans (34-10), Dallas has won four of their last five games with Rush under center. His play has definitely picked up in this stretch. Rush has thrown for nine touchdowns and just one interception while averaging 226.2 passing yards per game and 6.9 yards per pass attempt with a 64.4% completion percentage in that stretch. That's good for a 100.5 passer rating since Week 12, 12th in the league in that span. The Dallas Cowboys have won and covered in four of their last five games. Cowboys Last 5 Games Covered? Week 12 +10.5 at Commanders Yes Week 13 -4 vs Giants Yes Week 14 +4.5 vs Bengals No Week 15 +2.5 at Panthers Yes Week 16 +4.5 vs Buccaneers Yes The Dallas Cowboys (7-8), who were eliminated from postseason contention last week, have gotten hot of late with victories in four of their last five games. Despite being eliminated, head coach Mike McCarthy and his staff, who are in the final season of their current coaching contracts, aren't looking to simply play the young guys. Their mindset is still to seek wins first and foremost, which is why McCarthy is still starting a 31-year-old career backup in Cooper Rush over 2021 third overall pick quarterback Trey Lance. © 2004-2024 CBS Interactive.

McKee finished with 54 yards passing and two touchdowns on 3 of 4 passing, and Smith totaled 120 yards receiving and two touchdowns on six catches. Cowboys quarterback Cooper Rush, their eight-year veteran backup who is filling in for an injured Dak Prescott (hamstring tear), played slightly better than his first start of the season back in Week 10, a 34-6 home defeat against the Eagles. He threw a 69-yard pick six to Philadelphia safety C.J. Gardner-Johnson on the opening drive of the game, but he bounced back to throw a 4-yard goal-line fade touchdown to Dallas wide receiver Jalen Tolbert on the game's second possession. At the end of the first half, Rush sailed a deep throw intended for wide receiver Brandin Cooks on third-and-5, and Gardner-Johnson picked him off for the second time. He returned the football down to the Eagles' 35-yard line with 36 seconds left in the half. It's Gardner-Johnson's second career game with multiple interceptions, and both have come against the Cowboys. Rush finished the game with 147 yards, a touchdown and two interceptions on 15 of 28 passing. With a massive lead, 2024 NFL rushing yards leader Saquon Barkley was able to take over in the second half. He went off for 167 yards on 31 carries Sunday afternoon to become the ninth player in NFL history to register at least 2,000 rushing yards in a single season. Here are the five main takeaways from the Eagles' Week 17 victory: The Eagles defense took a massive hit once Gardner-Johnson was ejected from last Sunday's loss to the Washington Commanders as a result of two unsportsmanlike conduct penalties. Gardner-Johnson's ejection certainly affected how the Eagles defense played Jayden Daniels, who was 16 of 24 for 150 yards and three touchdowns to one interception (105.9 passer rating) after the defender's disqualification. The Commanders scored 22 fourth-quarter points in the comeback victory, all with Gardner-Johnson off the field. Gardner-Johnson was back for this game and made an impact on the first series. On third-and-3 from the Eagles' 35-yard line, Cowboys quarterback Cooper Rush threw a pass across the middle of the field and Gardner-Johnson read it for the interception. He took the takeaway 69 yards the other way for a touchdown to give the Eagles an early 7-0 lead with 11:55 remaining in the first quarter. Gardner-Johnson later had his second interception that set the Eagles up for a touchdown in the final seconds of the first half. The Eagles had three takeaways in the first half, all of which led to points. Even when Gardner-Johnson is struggling in coverage, he's making turnover-worthy plays for the Eagles to change the course of a game. In 28 games with the Eagles, Gardner-Johnson has 12 interceptions (6+ in each season played). He's a difference maker on this defense. Whatever the scripted game plan was in the first quarter of Pickett's start (filling in for Jalen Hurts as he was ruled out with a concussion), it wasn't what the Eagles were hoping for. A Landon Dickerson false start on the first play based the Eagles up to a first-and-15. Two incomplete passes and a checkdown to Kenneth Gainwell resulted in the first Eagles three-and-out. On the Eagles' second offensive possession, Pickett didn't even throw the football. With DeVonta Smith on the sidelines (wrist injury), the Eagles had Saquon Barkley carry the ball on three consecutive plays -- one via direct snap -- before choosing to punt on fourth-and-1 on their own 46-yard line. The decision to punt showed a lack of trust in Pickett to get the first down, with his arm or legs, or hand the ball off and get the first down. Six plays for 14 yards on the Eagles' first two series, and a lack of trust in Pickett. Different quarterback, same slow start. The Eagles opened things up for Pickett on the third drive, as he went 6 of 6 for 72 yards and a touchdown -- a 22-yard pass to DeVonta Smith. In the second quarter, 8 of 11 for 128 yards with a touchdown for a 141.5 passer rating. This doesn't include the rushing touchdown he had to get the Eagles up 24-7 at halftime. Pickett found an early connection with Smith once the Eagles opened up the passing game, hitting him three times for 74 yards and a score -- including a 49-yard pass to Smith that resulted in the 1-yard touchdown run just before the half. While it took the Eagles three series to get Pickett comfortable, opening things up for the quarterback certainly sparked the offense. Pickett left the game with a rib injury in the third quarter, yet the Eagles offense didn't miss a beat once third-string quarterback Tanner McKee entered the game. McKee, elevated to the No. 2 quarterback with Hurts out, threw a 20-yard touchdown pass to A.J. brown to put the Eagles up 34-7 late in the third quarter. The Eagles had a run-heavy offense once McKee entered the game with a big lead, yet he went 2 of 3 for 29 yards and a touchdown pass to Brown on his first series. He then followed with a 25-yard touchdown pass to DeVonta Smith on his second series, going 3 of 4 for 54 yards and two touchdowns for a 154.2 rating on his first two series. Whether it was Pickett or McKee, the Eagles offense was clicking from the second quarter on. Barkley reached the 2,000-yard rushing plateau on Sunday, becoming the ninth running back to amass 2,000 rushing yards in a season. He's eighth all-time for rushing yards in a season with 2,005. The chase is officially on in regards to Dickerson's record. Barkley finished with 31 carries for 167 yards, averaging 5.4 yards per carry. putting himself in striking distance of the mark. Dickerson rushed for 2,105 yards in 1984 and Barkley is 101 yards away from passing him. Barkley is averaging 125.3 rushing yards per game this season, which would put him on pace to pass Dickerson. Will the Eagles play him in Week 18? The 2,000-yard plateau was a goal of Barkley's and he achieved it. Just 101 yards away from Dickerson is approachable, even if the Eagles do play a meaningless game in Week 18. One of the hardest records in sports is Dickerson's rushing record. This mark can be broken if the Eagles decide to play barkley in Week 18, but it will likely be his call. The Cowboys have inserted 2021 third overall pick quarterback Trey Lance into the game with 2:24 left to play. Cowboys wide receiver Jalen Brooks and Cowboys cornerback Troy Pride, along with Eagles cornerback Sidney Brown, were ejected for fighting. Cowboys All-Pro kicker Brandon Aubrey drills a 61-yard field goal off the right upright for a missed field goal. The Eagles take over at the Cowboys' 49 up 41-7 with 4:40 left to play. Eagles wide receiver DeVonta Smith caught an underneath pass from Tanner McKee and left the Dallas defense in the dust for a 25-yard receiving touchdown, his second score of the day. The Eagles lead 41-7 with 10:03 left to play. Utter domination. Eagles running back Saquon Barkley is now up to 2,005 rushing yards, and he is the ninth player in NFL history to run for over 2,000 yards in a single season. Dallas commits their fourth turnover of the day with running back Rico Dowdle fumbling on third-and-5. Philadelphia linebacker Nolan Smith forced the fumble, and Eagles cornerback Cooper DeJean recovered the loose ball. Philadelphia takes over at their own 25 up 34-7 with 14:20 left in the game. Tanner McKee threw his first NFL regular season touchdown pass to Eagles No. 1 receiver A.J. Brown for a 20-yard scoring strike. Brown got a step on Cowboys All-Pro corner DaRon Bland, and McKee threw a perfectly placed pass over Brown's outside shoulder for the touchdown. The Eagles lead 34-7 over the Cowboys with 2:44 left in the third quarter. Eagles backup quarterback Kenny Pickett (ribs) is officially questionable to return. He initially suffered a ribs injury a week ago against the Washington Commanders. Third-string quarterback Tanner McKee is primed to lead this drive after the Cowboys went run-run-pass for a three-and-out on their latest drive. The Eagles lead 27-7 with 6:34 left in the third quarter. An A.J. Brown receiving touchdown gets nullified by a holding penalty on Landon Dickerson trying to contain Cowboys All-Pro edge rusher Micah Parsons. Eagles quarterback Kenny Pickett suffered an injury on the play, and Philadelphia subbed in third-stringer Tanner McKee to take the snap on third-and-goal from the Cowboys' 17. He handed off to Barkley for a gain of nine, and the Eagles took three more points on a 26-yard field goal. Philadelphia leads 27-7 with 8:03 left in the third quarter. The Eagles are marching up the field with ease to start the second half. Following a near interception by Pickett, it's been all runs by Saquon Barkley. A disaster for Dallas on their last drive of the half. Quarterback Cooper Rush sailed a deep throw intended for wide receiver Brandin Cooks on third-and-5, and Eagles safety C.J. Gardner-Johnson picked off Rush for the second time. He returned the football down to the Eagles' 35 with 36 seconds left in the half. It's Gardner-Johnson's second career game with multiple interceptions, and both have come against the Cowboys. Philly extends their lead to 10, 17-7, following Jake Elliott's 31-yard field. They can double dip with points since they start the second half with the football. Dallas has 1:55 on the clock and one timeout left. The Cowboys commit their second turnover of the half with tight end Jake Ferguson getting stripped by Eagles linebacker Oren Burks. Philadelphia defensive tackle Jordan Davis recovered the loose ball for the takeaway. Philadelphia takes over at the Cowboys' 39 up 14-7 with 6:27 left to play. The Eagles crowd is now chanting \"Dallas sucks.\" Dallas' lack of depth at cornerback because of injuries was just on full display. Eagles wide receiver DeVonta Smith cooked backup corner Andrew Booth with ease, getting open by multiple steps, which is how Philadelphia fill-in quarterback Kenny Pickett was able to hit him for a 22-yard touchdown. Philadelphia is back in front by seven, 14-7, with 6:38 left in the first half. The Cowboys take a deep shot down the left sideline to wide receiver Jonathan Mingo on third-and-1 instead of running with Dowdle, and it doesn't work. Mingo cooked Eagles first-round rookie corner Quinyon Mitchell, but he couldn't track Rush's throw. That led to the football harmlessly hitting the ground for an incompletion. Dallas punts it away, and Philadelphia fair-caught the football at their own 19. It's seven to seven with 12:49 left in the first half. After NFL rushing yards leader Saquon Barkley didn't touch the football on the Eagles' opening drive, the Eagles gave up three consecutives runs. However, he netted nine yards, and the Eagles punted the football away for a touchback. Philadelphia decided they would take their chances vs. Cooper Rush instead of potentially giving Dallas a short field if they bungled a fourth down attempt with Kenny Pickett at quarterback. It's a 7-7 game with 56 seconds left in the first quarter. Dallas goes three-and-out up against their own goal line, and they punt it away. The Cowboys got good hang time on the punt, so they were able to limit returner Cooper DeJean to just a yard on the return. The Eagles will have their second offensive possession starting at their own 37 in a 7-7 game with 2:48 left in the first quarter. Following a first down false start penalty, Eagle backup quarterback Kenny Pickett threw two consecutive incompletions, and then a short five-yarder to running back Kenneth Gainwell. Philadelphia goes three-and-out to start, and Dallas gets the football back on their own nine after a 52-yard punt by the Eagles. Eagles edge rusher Bryce Huff (shoulder) is questionable to return. Cooper Rush bounced back in a big way from his pick-six by capping the Cowboys' ensuing drive with a four-yard touchdown pass on a goal line fade to wide receiver Jalen Tolbert. Dallas continues to fight for head coach Mike McCarthy. This game is tied at seven with 5:38 left in the first quarter. Kenny Pickett and the Eagles offense will take the field for the first time today up next. With All-Pro wide receiver CeeDee Lamb out, Brandin Cooks is the Cowboys' clear cut No. 1 option in the passing game early on. Quarterback Cooper Rush has targeted him five times already, and Cooks has hauled in two of them for 38 yards, including 22 yards on the last play to move the chains on a third-and-9. Cooper Rush had been on a roll with wins in four of the last five games, which included a stretch of nine touchdowns to one interception, but he makes a critical error on the opening drive. He looked to force the football to Brandin Cooks on a third-and-3, but Eagles safety C.J. Gardner-Johnson jumped the route and took it all the way back for a 69-yard pick-six. It's Philadelphia's first defensive touchdown of the season, and the Eagles now lead 7-0 with 11:43 left in the first quarter. The Cowboys offense led by quarterback Cooper Rush and running back Rico Dowdle start with the football first. Cowboys three-time All-Pro edge rusher Micah Parsons has helped power a defensive renaissance in Dallas sparked by his return from his high ankle sprain along with an increased comfort in defensive coordinator Mike Zimmer's scheme in his first season working with the Cowboys defense after playing the last three under Dan Quinn, who is now the Washington Commanders head coach. He leads the NFL in both sacks (8.5) and quarterback pressures (42) since Week 10, and as a result, the Cowboys defense is one of the NFL's most disruptive in that span, ranking top five in the entire NFL in third down conversion rate allowed (35%, fifth-best in the NFL), sacks (28, best in the NFL), sack rate (10.4%, best in the NFL), quarterback pressure rate (39.3%, fifth-best in the NFL) and takeaways (15, tied for the second-most in the NFL). Cowboys All-Pro kicker Brandon Aubrey has made 36 field goals thus far in 2024. With just one more made field goal on Sunday in Philadelphia, Aubrey will set the franchise single season record for makes in a season, which would break a tie with his own record of 36 that he set in his first year last season in 2023. Cowboys running back Rico Dowdle is 97 rushing yards away from his first 1,000-yard season. If he accomplishes the feat on Sunday in Philadelphia, it would make him the first undrafted player in Cowboys history to rush for 1,000 yards in a season. Since Week 9, Dowdle ranks second in the NFL with 494 rushing yards after contract, trailing only Saquon Barkley's 566 in that span, according to Pro Football Focus. Dallas Cowboys three-time All-Pro edge rusher Micah Parsons knows he gave the Philadelphia Eagles (12-3), Dallas' Week 17 opponent, bulletin board material last week. \"Nah, at this point, it's f--- Philly, now,\" Parsons said on Dec. 19. \"Even if we got eliminated, like, I got to crush Philly. F--- them. I hate them now. I be seeing them just talking so much on socials. I don't know, my Twitter page got consumed by Philly [fans]. Man, ugh. They say don't look forward to some things, but I'm excited about the matchup [next week in Week 17], too.\" This Thursday, he acknowledged that beating the Eagles on Sunday would \"probably\" make their year. \"That probably makes the year you know what I'm saying? That sets everything off,\" Parsons said when asked how it would feel to beat the Eagles on Sunday. \"Us getting that win, away game in Philly. Knowing how they're trying to get the No. 1 seed. Can set them back a little bit. They're fighting for everything. They're fighting for where they want to be in the playoffs. We're just fighting to whoop them. They got more to lose than we do, so that'll be a great feeling right there.\" Check out his full remarks below. After two consecutive losses in Rush's first two starts this season versus the Eagles (34-6) and versus the Houston Texans (34-10), Dallas has won four of their last five games with Rush under center. His play has definitely picked up in this stretch. Rush has thrown for nine touchdowns and just one interception while averaging 226.2 passing yards per game and 6.9 yards per pass attempt with a 64.4% completion percentage in that stretch. That's good for a 100.5 passer rating since Week 12, 12th in the league in that span. The Dallas Cowboys have won and covered in four of their last five games. Cowboys Last 5 Games Covered? Week 12 +10.5 at Commanders Yes Week 13 -4 vs Giants Yes Week 14 +4.5 vs Bengals No Week 15 +2.5 at Panthers Yes Week 16 +4.5 vs Buccaneers Yes The Dallas Cowboys (7-8), who were eliminated from postseason contention last week, have gotten hot of late with victories in four of their last five games. Despite being eliminated, head coach Mike McCarthy and his staff, who are in the final season of their current coaching contracts, aren't looking to simply play the young guys. Their mindset is still to seek wins first and foremost, which is why McCarthy is still starting a 31-year-old career backup in Cooper Rush over 2021 third overall pick quarterback Trey Lance. © 2004-2024 CBS Interactive.

                "title": "Spadaro: 6 takeaways from a monumental rout of the Dallas Cowboys to clinch the NFC East",
                "content": "A blowout victory. History made. A division title won. On a 60-degree Sunday at Lincoln Financial Field, the Eagles clinched the NFC East and at least the No. 2 seed in the NFC with a 41-7 win over the Dallas Cowboys in which the defense continued to take the football away and the offense used a series of big plays to sweep Dallas for the first time in 13 seasons and improve the Eagles' record to 13-3. It took a minute to get warmed up, but then the Eagles rolled to 27 consecutive points to break a 7-7 tie. How did it happen? Some observations from a glorious afternoon in South Philadelphia ... 1. C.J. Gardner-Johnson provides the spark – twice Dallas took possession of the football first and picked up a couple of first downs to move into Philadelphia territory. But on a third-and-3 play from the Eagles' 35-yard line, quarterback Cooper Rush, with defensive tackle Milton Williams bearing down on him, threw short for wide receiver Brandin Cooks, covered by cornerback Cooper DeJean. Safety C.J. Gardner-Johnson swooped in with inside coverage and intercepted the pass and, escorted by DeJean the whole way, sped down the sideline for a touchdown and a lead. Late in the first half, Gardner-Johnson was there again. With the Eagles ahead 17-7, Rush looked left and deep for Cooks and overthrew the pass. CJGJ was there for the interception at the Philadelphia 10-yard line, had room to return the football to the Philadelphia 35, and with less than two minutes remaining in the half, the Eagles took advantage and put together a touchdown drive to really put the game out of reach. \"We have to continue to do the detailed things, and understanding that this game is not easy,\" Gardner-Johnson said. \"The more you go away from your fundamentals and technique and try to shy away and do everything on skill, it's not going to go well. So I think for us, to get the ball back and coach preaching every day is something that we take part in because if we don't get the ball, we're kind of pissed off.\" The impact of Gardner-Johnson is profound with his big-play ability, his emotion, his physicality, and the way he covers sideline to sideline. He was all over the field on this Sunday. 2. Grant Calcaterra wakes up the offense with a one-handed catch Midway through the second quarter, the Eagles just had not found their stride offensively. Quarterback Kenny Pickett had some success, but the running game was limited and the offense had not put any points on the board. On a third-and-8 play from the Philadelphia 46-yard line, Pickett used his feet to create space and rolled right and threw deep for tight end Grant Calcaterra. He made a remarkable catch – reaching up with one hand and grabbing the football and keeping possession for a 34-yard gain to the Dallas 20-yard line. After that, it was go time for the Eagles' offense. \"I got away from pressure and the scramble drill. I saw him wheel up the field, I just put it up for him, and he made a [heck] of a play. [Eagles TE] Grant [Calcaterra] is a phenomenal player. Doesn't get enough love, I feel like on this team, because there's so much talent. But I've been with him since I got here. We got a lot of reps together early on. He's a special, special player, a great person. So, I'm really happy for him,\" Pickett said. That play was the turning point. Three plays later, Pickett threw for DeVonta Smith, who ran a perfect corner route and was open, for 22 yards and a touchdown and you ... could ... just ... feel ... what ... came ... next. 3. Kenny Pickett rose to the occasion – and so did Tanner McKee Until he left the game early in the third quarter with injured ribs, following a hit from Dallas linebacker Micah Parsons in the red zone, Pickett looked good. He completed 10 of 15 passes for 143 yards and a touchdown, and also gained a couple of first downs and a touchdown on the Brotherly Shove. Pickett stood up to pressure, got the football out, and let his playmakers make plays. Pickett threw some beautiful passes – to Smith for the touchdown, to Smith for 49 yards just before halftime – and he managed the offense nicely. This is why he's here – to take over when Jalen Hurts can't go and to help the Eagles win games. And how about Tanner McKee's NFL debut! McKee only attempted four passes, but made the most of them, completing three of them with two for touchdowns. He helped the Eagles gain 54 yards through the air and had a near-perfect 156,2 passer rating (158.3 is the pinnacle). Even on his one incompletion, wide receiver A.J. Brown nearly made a highlight-reel, one-handed catch in the end zone, but was just unable to get the second foot down. It didn't matter as his next attempt went back to No. 11 for a 20-yard touchdown, the first of his NFL career, which Brown tossed into the crowd and the Eagles had to do some extra work to get the ball back. \"Those guys did a really good job coming in and playing. They played really clean football. Happy with the way they prepared themselves this week and went out and performed. They deserve all that credit. You can't go out there and play that position without the greatness of other people, and they had some greatness from other guys out there,\" Head Coach Nick Sirianni said. \"Starting with their coaches – [Offensive Coordinator] Kellen [Moore], [Passing Game Coordinator/Associate Head Coach] Kevin [Patullo], and [Quarterbacks Coach] Doug [Nussmeier] really did a good job of getting them ready. Then just the plays that they got from Smitty [WR DeVonta Smith] and Saquon and [TE] Grant Calcaterra and [WR] A.J. [Brown] and the offensive line. That's what a team is. A team steps up in adversity, and steps up and has each other's backs.\" Now this is a story all about how...@1kalwaysopen_ | #FlyEaglesFly pic.twitter.com/Q6eN2PW3Ar 4. Oren Burks starts at linebacker and makes an impact Nakobe Dean missed the game with an abdominal injury, so Oren Burks started at linebacker and was involved in a big way. He had seven total tackles and came up with a big takeaway – a forced fumble that the Eagles recovered and turned into a Jake Elliott field goal and a 17-7 advantage in the second quarter. It was the second of four takeaways by the Eagles, who have nine takeaways in the last two games. Depth is critical in these long seasons and having Burks out there – an experienced pro who knows how to play and knows where he is supposed to be – is a big plus and a big kudos to Executive Vice President/General Manager Howie Roseman: The Eagles have been challenged with injuries throughout the season and here they are, 13-3 and winning a huge game in December with a backup quarterback and a backup linebacker starter. Jeremiah Trotter, Jr. also saw some good reps and continues to impress. 5. Once again, Eagles strike at the end of the first half and the start of the second This has happened throughout the entire season: The Eagles have a late score in the first half and then come out with a first-possession score in the second half to completely change the complexion of the game. Pickett's plunge ended the first half and gave the Eagles a 24-7 lead at the half and then the offense drove 55 yards in 12 plays to extend the lead to 27-7 after halftime with a Jake Elliott field goal. This is why most teams defer the opening kickoff – score late in the second quarter with that extra possession and get the first crack at points in the second half. The Eagles do it very, very well. 6. Saquon Barkley continues his assault on the record books Saquon Barkley had a huge game, rushing for 167 yards on 31 carries and eclipsing the 2,000-yard mark (he has 2,005 yards becoming the ninth player in NFL history to accomplish the feat) – and also set the franchise record for yards from scrimmage in a season (he has 2,283 yards from scrimmage for the season). \"I'm not going to lie, but just being a fan of the game and the running back position, to reach a milestone and put myself up there with eight other backs that I respect, and some of them I grew up watching, definitely means a lot,\" Barkley said. \"But at the same time, I wouldn't be able to do that without this team. Like I said, you can't be great without the greatness of others, and I'm just happy I was able to be a part of the team and be able to reach a milestone like that.\" It was his franchise-record (there it is again) 11th 100-yard performance of the season. It should be noted that Barkley is exactly 100 yards behind Eric Dickerson for the all-time single-season NFL rushing record. Here are a few other highlights from the blowout victory: The team from Dallas might be out of the playoff picture, but the Cowboys wouldn't mind spoiling the Eagles' chance to clinch the NFC East Division title on home turf. How will the Eagles fare without Jalen Hurts at quarterback? It's the final game of the 2024 calendar year and there's no better way to finish than against the division rivals.

Brown The Eagles (12-3) return to Lincoln Financial Field for the first of two home games to close out the regular season. A win guarantees more company at home into the postseason, while Dallas (7-8) is relishing the role of spoiler. Pickett was a full participant in Thursday's practice as Jalen Hurts remains in the concussion protocol. Head Coach Nick Sirianni confirmed that Hurts is in the NFL's concussion protocol. The Eagles will prepare for every potential scenario this week. The Eagles forced five takeaways, but could not get a stop on Washington's final drive. The Eagles clinch the NFC East win a win. Washington is one of the league's best teams at home and wants to secure its postseason ticket. Check out the top storylines ahead of this division showdown. The fourth-year running back maximized his opportunities with some clutch plays in Sunday's win over Pittsburgh. The selection of Jalen Hurts in 2020 kicked off a new era for the Eagles, one that has them in the playoffs for the fourth year in a row and on the verge of an NFC East Division title. Read about that, plus some of the amazing statistics that the Eagles have piled up on both sides of the ball during this franchise-record 10-game win streak. The Eagles dominated the AFC North leaders to win a franchise-record 10th straight game win and inch closer to an NFC East Division crown. Since Week 6, these are two of the best teams in the NFL in terms of record, points scored, point differential, turnover margin, and time of possession. This is going to be a fantastic intrastate matchup with a playoff atmosphere. Pittsburgh leads the league in takeaways and is fourth in run defense. The battle in the trenches will be marvelous come Sunday afternoon. Copyright © 2024 Philadelphia Eagles. All rights reserved.",

                "content": "Editions: En/nfl/philadelphia-eagles Saquon Barkley reached 2,000 rushing yards in the season Saquon Barkley rushed for 167 yards to surpass 2,000 for the season, backup quarterback Kenny Pickett ran and threw for another touchdown before leaving with injured ribs, and the Philadelphia Eagles clinched the NFC East title by defeating the Dallas Cowboys 41-7. Barkley already has 2,005 yards and needs 101 in next week's regular season finale to surpass Eric Dickerson's historic mark of 2,105 yards with the Los Angeles Rams in 1984. Related: The Eagles (13-3) led 24-7 in the third quarter when Pickett was hit by defensive end Micah Parsons, ending his first start in place of Jalen Hurts, who suffered a concussion. Tanner McKee, the Eagles' third-string passer, threw two touchdown passes, one a 20-yarder to A.J. Brown and a 25-yard pass to DeVonta Smith, in front of a roaring crowd delighted to see the Eagles dominate their most hated rival to secure the divisional title and at least the No. 2 seed in the NFC. Pickett, acquired from the Pittsburgh Steelers in the offseason, played with extra protection under his jersey after suffering a rib injury last week against the Commanders. Pickett was excited for this game all week. He grew up as a die-hard Eagles fan in central New Jersey, about 80 miles from Lincoln Financial Field, and had \"great memories\" of going to games with his father and grandfather since he was five years old. Pickett, 26, said he had a lot of family at the stadium to cheer him on against Dallas (7-9). More than 60,000 Eagles fans also supported him, but Pickett's dream day ended prematurely. He finished 10 of 15 for 143 yards. Since the Eagles no longer have a divisional title to play for, Hurts is likely to rest another week before the playoffs. Now, Pickett could also be sidelined, possibly forcing McKee to start against the already eliminated New York Giants. Barkley had 31 carries and the last one was for 23 yards to surpass 2,000. He could also sit out rather than risk injury chasing Dickerson's record. Barkley, who left the Giants and signed a three-year, $26 million guaranteed contract with the Eagles, set the NFL record for most rushing yards in a player's first season with a new team. Dallas quarterback Cooper Rush threw for 147 yards and had two interceptions. © Unidad Editorial Información Deportiva, S.L.U. All rights reserved. Follow us",

                "content": "Saquon Rasul Quevis Barkley[1] (/ˈseɪkwɒn/ SAY-kwon; born February 9, 1997) is an American professional football running back for the Philadelphia Eagles of the National Football League (NFL). He played college football for the Penn State Nittany Lions, where he set several school records for his offensive production over three seasons, before forgoing his senior year to enter the NFL. In 2017, Barkley finished fourth in Heisman Trophy voting with 304 total votes, third in Maxwell Award voting, and received multiple national and Big Ten Conference awards and recognition. During his three-year collegiate career, Barkley set Penn State records for most all-purpose career yards (5,538), most career rushing touchdowns (43), most career receiving yards by a running back (1,157), most rushing yards by a freshman and sophomore, and most total yards in a single game. Barkley was selected second overall by the New York Giants in the 2018 NFL draft, setting several NFL and team records en route to making the 2018 Pro Bowl and being named the NFL Offensive Rookie of the Year. He confronted injuries in the 2020 season, but was again named to the Pro Bowl in 2022. A free agent following the 2023 season, Barkley signed a three-year deal with the Eagles, setting numerous franchise records and rushing for over 2,000 yards in his first season with the team. Barkley was born in Bronx, New York, the son of Alibay Barkley, a boxer, and Tonya Johnson. He has three brothers and two sisters. His brother Alibay Jr. was a baseball player drafted by the Los Angeles Angels, and his great uncle is former WBC middleweight champion Iran Barkley.[2] In 2001, Barkley and his family moved to Bethlehem, Pennsylvania, in the Lehigh Valley in search of a safer and more suburban environment.[3] The family later moved to neighboring Allentown and, in 2005, to Coplay, Pennsylvania.[4] Barkley attended Whitehall High School in Whitehall Township, Pennsylvania, which competes in the Eastern Pennsylvania Conference, an elite division of large high schools in the Lehigh Valley and Poconos known nationally for producing a large number of NFL and other professional athletes.[5] At Whitehall High School, Barkley rushed for 3,646 yards with 63 touchdowns from his sophomore to senior year, including 1,856 yards and 31 touchdowns as a senior.[6] Barkley was rated as a four-star recruit and committed to Penn State to play college football.[7][8] He originally committed to Rutgers before changing to Penn State.[9] In addition to football, Barkley also lettered in basketball and track and field at Whitehall. As a senior in 2015, he won Eastern Pennsylvania Conference gold medals in both the 100-meter dash (11.15 seconds) and in the long jump (22'2.5\" or 6.77m) at the PIAA District 11 meet, where he also earned a second-place finish in the 100-meter dash with a time of 10.90 seconds, which set a Whitehall High School record.[10] Later in the track and field season, Barkley set personal best marks of 46'2.5\" (14.08m) in the shot put and 6'0\" (1.83m) in the high jump.[11] Barkley was considered a top NCAA Division I football prospect and received multiple football scholarship offers, including from Missouri, North Carolina, Notre Dame, Ohio State, Pitt, Rutgers, Syracuse, and Temple. He chose to accept an offer from Penn State.[12] Sources: On September 10, 2021, Whitehall High School retired Barkley's jersey number (#21). Earlier, the school had retired the jersey numbers of two other alumni who went on to have successful NFL careers: Matt Millen, who played from 1980 until 1991 with the Oakland and Los Angeles Raiders, the San Francisco 49ers, and the Washington Redskins; and Dan Koppen, who played from 2003 until 2013 with the New England Patriots and Denver Broncos.[13] At Penn State, Barkley earned immediate playing time as a true freshman in 2015.[14] After rushing for one yard on one carry during his first game, he rushed for 115 yards with a touchdown in his second game against Buffalo.[15] He followed up that performance by rushing for 195 yards and two touchdowns on 21 carries in his third game against Rutgers.[16] In October, he missed two games due to injury.[17] In his first game back against top-ranked Ohio State on October 17, 2015, he rushed for 194 yards on 26 carries.[18][19] During his freshman year at Penn State in 2015, Barkley rushed for 1,076 yards on 182 carries.[20] During the offseason, Barkley received praise for his freshman year performance and was awarded second-team All-Big Ten with some votes for first team status and being named BTN.com Freshman of the Year.[21] In the first game of his sophomore year at Penn State in 2016, Barkley rushed for 105 yards and a touchdown in a 33–13 win over Kent State.[22] In week two, in a renewed rivalry game against Pitt, Penn State trailed in the second quarter 28–7 before Barkley led Penn State back, scoring five touchdowns with his fifth coming with 5:00 left in the fourth quarter, to bring the Nittany Lions within three points. However, quarterback Trace McSorley threw an interception in the Pitt end zone with 1:41 left that denied the Nittany Lions' hopes of completing the comeback.[23] In week five against Minnesota, in what would become a recurring theme for the 2016 Penn State football team, Penn State again was forced to come back from a halftime deficit. In overtime, after being held to only 38 yards on 19 carries during regular playing time, Barkley's first play in overtime, a 25-yard touchdown run, gave Penn State the victory.[24] In week six against Maryland, Barkley had his first ever 200-yard rushing game at Penn State, finishing with 31 carries for 202 yards and one touchdown.[25] In week seven, in a matchup versus Ohio State, Barkley rushed for 99 yards on 12 carries with one 37 yard run in a 24–21 win over the second ranked Buckeyes.[26] In week eight, Barkley and no. 24 Penn State scored a season high 62 points versus Purdue as Barkley rushed for a career-high 207 yards and a career-high long 81 yard run, along with 70 yards in receiving yards and two touchdowns, giving him a total of 277 yards in the game. Penn State defeated Purdue 62–24 and improved to 6–2 and 4–1 in Big Ten play.[27] On November 1, 2016, Barkley was named a semi-finalist for the Maxwell Award, granted to the all-around best collegiate football player of the year.[28] On November 5, Barkley rushed for 167 yards and a touchdown against Iowa. He added 44 yards and another touchdown in receiving for a total of 211 all-purpose yards in Penn State's 41–14 victory.[29] After the regular season, Barkley was named the Big Ten Offensive Player of the Year, Ameche–Dayne Running Back of the Year and First Team All-Big Ten.[30] On December 3, 2016, Barkley had 19 carries for 83 yards, rushed for a touchdown, and caught another touchdown on a wheel route. His efforts helped Penn State recover from a 28–7 deficit to stun Wisconsin, 38–31, in the 2016 Big Ten Championship Game.[31] In the 2017 Rose Bowl on January 2, Barkley had 25 carries for 194 yards, averaging 7.8 yards per carry, including a 79-yard rushing touchdown that gave Penn State a 28–27 lead. After trailing 13–0, Penn State scored seven touchdowns on seven consecutive possessions, including four touchdowns on four consecutive offensive plays, including Barkley's 79-yard touchdown. Barkley scored the first, fourth, and seventh touchdowns for Penn State, giving the Nittany Lions a 49–35 lead in the fourth quarter, though USC ultimately went on to win the game, 52–49.[32] At the close of his sophomore year at Penn State, Barkley had set Penn State records for most rushing yards in a season by a freshman (1,076) and by a sophomore (1,496). In the first game of the 2017 season against Akron, Barkley ran 14 times for 172 yards, two rushing touchdowns, and a long run of 80 yards. He also caught two passes for 54 receiving yards. For his efforts, Barkley was named co-Big Ten Offensive Player of the Week.[33] In Penn State's 2017 Big Ten opener, at Iowa, Barkley led Penn State to a 21–19 win, recording 358 all-purpose yards. He also set a school record for most all-purpose yards in a single game, recording 211 rushing yards, a rushing touchdown, 94 receiving yards, and 53 kick return yards.[34] For his efforts, Barkley was again named Big Ten Offensive Player of the Week.[35] In the first Big Ten home game of his junior year against the Indiana, Barkley rushed 20 times for just 56 yards, an unusually underwhelming rushing day for him. Despite this, he still had a major impact on the game, returning the opening kickoff 97 yards for a touchdown, catching four passes for 52 yards, and throwing a 16-yard pass to receiver DaeSean Hamilton late in the fourth quarter to cap a 45–14 Penn State win. This made Barkley the first player in Big Ten history to record a return and passing touchdown in the same game.[36] Barkley was named Big Ten Special Teams Player of the Week.[36] One month later against Ohio State, Barkley again returned the opening kickoff back 97 yards for a touchdown, but was limited for the rest of the game recording 44 rushing yards on 21 carries, 36 of which came on a touchdown run in the second quarter.[37] In his final collegiate game at Penn State, Barkley rushed for 137 yards and scored two touchdowns, one of them a 92-yard effort to put Penn State up 28–7 over the Washington Huskies in the 2017 Fiesta Bowl, which Penn State went on to win 35–28.[38] On December 31, 2017, following Penn State's Fiesta Bowl victory, Barkley declared his intention to forgo his senior year at Penn State and enter the 2018 NFL draft.[39] Penn State: Entering the 2018 NFL draft, Barkley was widely projected to be a top 10 NFL pick.[39] In the weeks leading up to the NFL Combine, Barkley's stock rose even higher. By late February 2018, some mock drafts projected him as high as the second selection overall,[64] the highest for a running back since Reggie Bush in 2006. ESPN analyst Mel Kiper Jr., who has history of not supporting the selection of running backs in the NFL draft's first round, said \"Barkley is a once in a lifetime talent; teams that pass on this young man will be sorry.\"[65] At the combine, Barkley had a performance that was widely praised, running a 4.4 second 40-yard dash and doing 29 bench presses of 225 pound weight, tying for the most reps by any running back at this combine.[66] According to NFL analyst Ian Rapoport, the Cleveland Browns were \"strongly considering\" drafting Barkley first overall, which would have made him the first running back since Ki-Jana Carter in 1995 to be selected first overall.[67] Barkley was selected by the New York Giants with the second overall selection in the 2018 draft.[69] On July 22, 2018, Barkley signed a four-year rookie contract, worth $31.2 million fully guaranteed.[70] Barkley scored his first NFL touchdown, a 68-yard rush, in the season opener against the Jacksonville Jaguars. Overall in his first NFL game, he rushed for 106 yards and scored a touchdown in the Giants' 20–15 loss.[71] The following week, in a 20–13 loss to the Dallas Cowboys, Barkley recorded 14 receptions, setting a Giants' all-time franchise record for most catches in a game. He also tied the NFL single game record for most catches in a game by an NFL rookie.[72] In Week 3, in the Giants' 27–22 victory over the Houston Texans, Barkley recorded 82 rushing yards, rushed for a touchdown, and caught five passes for 35 receiving yards.[73] The following week, in the Giants' loss to the New Orleans Saints, Barkley recorded 100 scrimmage yards with 44 rushing yards and 56 receiving yards and a rushing touchdown.[74] In Week 5, against the Carolina Panthers, he recorded four receptions for 81 receiving yards and two receiving touchdowns and rushed for 48 yards in the Giants' 33–31 loss.[75] In the Giants' Week 6 Thursday Night Football game against the Philadelphia Eagles, Barkley finished with 130 rushing yards, including a 50-yard touchdown and 99 receiving yards, totaling 229 all-purpose yards in the Giants 34–13 loss to Philadelphia.[76] In Week 11 against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, Barkley rushed for his NFL career-high to date with 142 yards and three touchdowns as the Giants won 38–35,[77][78] and for his efforts he was named the NFC Offensive Player of the Week.[79] In Week 12's 25–22 loss to the Philadelphia Eagles, Barkley rushed for 101 yards and scored a 51-yard touchdown, becoming the first player since John Fuqua in 1970 to rush for two 50-plus yard touchdowns against the Eagles in a single season.[80][81] In Week 13 against the Chicago Bears, Barkley had 125 rushing yards and three receptions for 21 yards in the 30–27 overtime win.[82][83] During Week 14, in the Giants' 40–16 win over the Redskins, Barkley rushed for 170 yards, including a 78-yard touchdown, becoming the first Giants rookie to surpass 1,000 rushing yards in a season, and setting the franchise's single-season record for rookies with 15 touchdowns scored.[84] In the regular season finale against the Dallas Cowboys, Barkley had 17 carries for 109 yards, his seventh game with over 100 rushing yards on the season, and he scored a touchdown in the Giants' 36–35 loss.[85] In recognition of his rookie season accomplishments, Barkley was elected to the 2019 Pro Bowl, where he helped the NFC win the Skills Showdown.[86] Barkley received numerous awards during and after his rookie season, including Pepsi Rookie of the Year,[87] FedEx Ground NFL Player of the Year,[88] AP NFL Offensive Rookie of the Year[89] and was named to the PFWA All-Rookie Team and AP All-Rookie teams.[90] Entering his second NFL season, Barkley was ranked No. 16 on the NFL's Top 100 players for 2019.[91][92] Barkley was chosen by his teammates as one of seven team captains for the 2019 season, an honor rarely bestowed on players after only one year on the team.[93] In Week 1 against the Cowboys, Barkley rushed 11 times for 120 yards, including a 59-yard run, in the Giants' 35–17 loss.[94] In this game, he fumbled the ball for the first time in his NFL career.

In the game, Barkley rushed 18 times for 72 yards and a touchdown in the Giants' 27–21 loss.[97] In Week 8 against the Detroit Lions, Barkley rushed for a season-high 19 times and 64 yards and caught a season-high eight passes for 79 yards and a touchdown in the team's 31–26 loss.[98] In Week 15 against the Miami Dolphins, Barkley rushed 24 times for 112 yards and two touchdowns and caught four passes for 31 yards in the Giants' 36–20 win.[99] In Week 16, Barkley rushed for a career high 189 yards on 22 carries and caught four passes for 90 yards and two total touchdowns in a 41–35 win over the Redskins.[100] He won the NFC Offensive Player of the Week award for his performance in Week 16.[101] In Week 17 against the Eagles, Barkley rushed 17 times for 92 yards, including a season-long 68-yard run that resulted in a touchdown, during the Giants' 34–17 loss to Philadelphia.[102] Barkley finished his sophomore season as the only running back in Giants' history to have 1,000 rushing yards in their first two seasons.[103] He was ranked 31st by his fellow players on the NFL Top 100 Players of 2020.[104] In Week 1 against the Pittsburgh Steelers on Monday Night Football, Barkley rushed 15 times for six rushing yards and caught six passes for 60 receiving yards in the Giants' 26–16 loss to the Steelers. Barkley's 0.4 yards per attempt was a career low.[105] During the following week's 17–13 loss to the Bears, Barkley was carted off the field after suffering a knee injury, which was later diagnosed as a torn anterior cruciate ligament, which ended his 2020 season.[106][107] During the game, Barkley rushed to the right and engaged with Bears safety Eddie Jackson, who wrestled him down to the ground near the sideline at the end of a six-yard run. Barkley immediately grabbed the back of his right knee and removed his helmet.[108] Jackson later voiced his concern on Twitter, sending prayers and support.[109] Barkley was placed on injured reserve on September 22, 2020.[110] On April 28, 2021, the Giants picked up the fifth-year option on Barkley's contract,[111] worth a guaranteed $7.217 million for the 2022 season.[112] In Week 5 against the Dallas Cowboys, Barkley's foot landed on Jourdan Lewis and his ankle rolled.[113] On November 3, 2021, the Giants announced that Barkley was being placed in the NFL's COVID-19 protocol.[114] In the 2021 season, Barkley had 593 rushing yards, two rushing touchdowns, 41 receptions, 263 receiving yards and two receiving touchdowns in 13 games.[115] Against the Tennessee Titans in Week 1, Barkley rushed for 164 yards, a touchdown, and caught six passes for 30 yards in the 21–20 comeback win. He converted the go-ahead two point conversion late in the fourth quarter.[116] Barkley's performance on Sunday resulted in him receiving the NFC Offensive Player of the Week.[117] In Week 3, Barkley had 126 scrimmage yards and a rushing touchdown in the 23–16 loss to the Cowboys.[118] In Week 4, Barkley had 146 rushing yards in the 20–12 victory over the Bears.[119] He was named to the Pro Bowl.[120] In Week 10 against the Texans, he had 35 carries for 152 rushing yards and a rushing touchdown in the 24–16 victory.[121] Overall, he finished the 2022 season with 295 carries for 1,312 rushing yards and ten rushing touchdowns to go along with 57 receptions for 338 receiving yards.[122] He finished fourth in the NFL and first in the NFC in rushing yards.[123] In the Wild Card Round of the playoffs, he had 109 scrimmage yards and two rushing touchdowns in the 31–24 victory over the Minnesota Vikings.[124] He was ranked 31st by his fellow players on the NFL Top 100 Players of 2023.[125] On March 7, 2023, the Giants placed the non-exclusive franchise tag on Barkley.[126] He signed the franchise tag after it was adjusted to add a $2 million signing bonus and incentives on July 26.[127][128] During Week 8 against the New York Jets, Barkley finished with 128 rushing yards on 36 carries as the Giants lost 10–13 in overtime.[129] In Week 11 against the Commanders, he had 140 scrimmage yards and two receiving touchdowns in the victory.[130] In Week 18 against Philadelphia, he had two rushing touchdowns in the victory.[131] He finished the 2023 season with 247 carries for 962 rushing yards and six rushing touchdowns to go with 41 receptions for 280 receiving yards and four receiving touchdowns in 14 games and starts.[132] On March 13, 2024, Barkley signed a three-year $37.75 million deal with the Philadelphia Eagles, of which $26 million is guaranteed and could increase to $46.75 million with bonuses.[133][134] Prior to signing with the Eagles, Barkley admitted he was \"fed up\" with negotiations with the Giants, calling their approach \"a little disrespectful.\" He felt slighted by the team's insistence that he prove his value on the open market, which he described as a \"slap in the face.\"[135] In his Eagles debut, Barkley rushed for 109 yards with two rushing touchdowns and a receiving touchdown in a 34–29 victory over the Green Bay Packers, becoming the first Eagles player to score three touchdowns in their debut with the team since Terrell Owens in 2004.[136] His performance earned him NFC Offensive Player of the Week.[137] The following week against the Falcons, Barkley rushed for 95 yards and caught four of five passes for 21 yards, but a late fourth-quarter drop that could have sealed the win for the Eagles proved costly as they lost 22–21.[138] Barkley had 17 carries for 147 yards and scored two touchdowns in the fourth quarter to lead the Eagles to a 15–12 win over the Saints in Week 3.[139] Barkley made his return to MetLife Stadium against the Giants in Week 7, rushing for 176 yards and a touchdown on 17 carries in a 28–3 victory over his former team.

Barkley and his family participated in a parade through his hometown of Coplay, Pennsylvania, that included the Whitehall High School marching band and children from the league where Barkley played youth football.

                "content": "News: 20 hours agoBarkley rushed 31 times for 167 yards and brought in both targets for two yards in the Eagles' 41-7 win over the Cowboys on Sunday. Spin: The Eagles are clearly intent on getting Barkley to the all-time single-season rushing yardage record if Sunday's workload is any indication, as the seven-year pro logged his highest carry total since Week 8 of last season. Barkley generated his second-highest yardage tally of the campaign with the elevated volume, logging his sixth 100-yard effort in the last seven contests. The 2018 first-round pick eclipsed the 2,000-yard mark on the season with Sunday's gargantuan production, leaving him exactly 100 yards away from Eric Dickerson's 2,105-yard single-season record that has stood for the last 40 years. Barkley will have a premium Week 18 matchup with which to try and make history, as the Eagles host the Giants to close out the regular season. ESPN Fantasy Projection: Barkley left the rival Giants for the superior offense down the New Jersey Turnpike, one stacked with elite options at quarterback, wide receiver and, perhaps most importantly, along the still-dominant offensive line. Barkley's 2023 numbers may appear average, but blame the underwhelming New York offense, from the players to its direction. Still blessed with elite skills, a mostly healthy Barkley finished ninth among running backs at 15.9 fantasy points per game, and he may return to his 2022 numbers (1,312 rushing yards, 57 catches) in this top offense. Barkley is a first-round fantasy pick and potential top-three fantasy RB provided health (one never knows) and volume (no problems there).",

                "content": "The Los Angeles Lakers are an American professional basketball team based in Los Angeles. The Lakers compete in the National Basketball Association (NBA) as a member of the Pacific Division of the Western Conference. The Lakers play their home games at Crypto.com Arena, an arena they share with the Los Angeles Sparks of the Women's National Basketball Association and the Los Angeles Kings of the National Hockey League.[10] The Lakers are one of the most successful teams in the history of the NBA with 17 championships, the second most in the league behind the Boston Celtics.[11] The franchise began in 1946 as the Detroit Gems of the National Basketball League (NBL).[12] After one season, a new ownership relocated the team to Minneapolis, Minnesota,[13][12] and renamed the team as the Minneapolis Lakers.[14] The Lakers won the 1948 NBL championship before joining the rival Basketball Association of America, where they won the 1949 BAA championship. Following the merger of the NBL and the BAA into the NBA in 1949, the Lakers won four of the next five NBA championships.[15] After struggling financially in the late 1950s, they relocated to Los Angeles before the 1960–61 season. The Lakers made the NBA Finals six times in the 1960s, but lost every series to the Celtics, beginning their long and storied rivalry. In 1968, the Lakers acquired four-time NBA Most Valuable Player (MVP) Wilt Chamberlain, and won their sixth NBA title in 1972, led by coach Bill Sharman. After the retirement of Chamberlain, the team traded for superstar Kareem Abdul-Jabbar. Two big changes came in 1979, first, Jerry Buss purchased the Lakers, and pioneered a vision of basketball as entertainment as well as sport.[16] Second, the Lakers drafted Magic Johnson first overall in the 1979 NBA draft. The combination of Johnson, a prodigy point guard, and dominant center in Abdul-Jabbar provided the Lakers with superstars to anchor their roster. The promotion of head coach Pat Riley in 1981 and addition of forward James Worthy through the 1982 draft established the Lakers as an NBA powerhouse throughout the 1980s. The franchise won five championships in a nine-year span, including two out of three marquee Finals matchups against the Celtics. The Lakers were defeated by their Boston archrivals in the 1984 Finals, but triumphed over them in 1985 and 1987. After Riley departed and Abdul-Jabbar, Johnson, and Worthy retired, the Lakers struggled in the early 1990s. It was not until 1996 when the team traded with the Charlotte Hornets for the draft rights to Kobe Bryant and signed center Shaquille O'Neal that the Lakers returned to dominance during the early 2000s. The superstar duo, along with Hall of Fame coach Phil Jackson, led the Lakers to three consecutive championships between 2000 and 2002, securing the franchise's second \"three-peat\".[17] The dynamic \"Shaq-and-Kobe\" era ended when the Lakers traded away O'Neal after the team lost to the Detroit Pistons in the 2004 Finals. It was not until the Lakers traded for Pau Gasol that Bryant and Jackson returned to the NBA Finals, losing to the Celtics in 2008 but winning championships in 2009 and 2010. The 2010 Finals marked the latest matchup of the Lakers and Celtics, with Los Angeles winning its 16th title. Jackson retired in 2011, and the Lakers endured their longest playoff drought in franchise history. Gasol departed in 2014, and Bryant retired in 2016. After rebuilding seasons with young, highly rated prospects, the Lakers signed superstar LeBron James in 2018.[18] In 2019, the team traded several of those prospects for star big man Anthony Davis.[19] The Lakers—led by James, Davis, and coach Frank Vogel—won the team's 17th championship in 2020, tying the Celtics for the most titles until 2024.[20] The Lakers hold the record for NBA's longest winning streak, 33 straight games, set in 1971–72.[21] 26 Hall of Famers have played for Los Angeles, while four have coached the team. Abdul-Jabbar, Johnson, O'Neal, and Bryant won a combined eight NBA MVP awards with the Lakers.[22] The franchise was founded in 1946 as the Detroit Gems and played in the National Basketball League (NBL) during the 1946–47 season where it finished last in the league with only 4 wins in 44 games. Though the team was scheduled to continue in the NBL the following season,[23] its ownership, faced with high losses due to low attendance and lack of homecourt, decided on selling the team to Ben Berger and Morris Chalfen of Minnesota for $15,000[13][24] Minneapolis sportswriter Sid Hartman played a key behind-the-scenes role in helping put together the deal and later the team.[25] Inspired by Minnesota's nickname, \"Land of 10,000 Lakes\", the team rechristened themselves the Lakers.[26][27] Hartman helped them hire John Kundla from College of St. Thomas, to be their first head coach, by meeting with him and selling him on the team.[28][29] As the franchise had the worst record in the NBL the previous season, it got the first pick in the 1947 Professional Basketball League of America dispersal draft, which they used to select George Mikan. Led by Mikan, the Lakers had a solid roster, which also featured forward Jim Pollard and playmaker Herm Schaefer.[30] In their first season, they led the league with a 43–17 record, later winning the NBL championship that season.[31] In 1948, the Lakers moved from the NBL to the Basketball Association of America (BAA), and Mikan's 28.3 point per game (ppg) scoring average set a BAA record. In the 1949 BAA Finals they won the championship, beating the Washington Capitols four games to two.[32] Following the season, the BAA and the NBL merged to form the National Basketball Association (NBA).[33] In the newly formed league, the Lakers improved to 51–17 record and won their third straight professional championship.[34] In the 1950–51 season, Mikan won his third straight scoring title at 28.4 ppg and the Lakers went 44–24 to win their second straight division title.[35] One of those games, a 19–18 loss against the Fort Wayne Pistons, became infamous as the lowest scoring game in NBA history.[36] In the playoffs, they defeated the Indianapolis Olympians in three games but lost to the Rochester Royals in the next round.[30] During the 1951–52 season, the Lakers won 40 games, finishing second in their division.[37] They faced the New York Knicks in the NBA Finals, which they won in seven games.[38] In the 1952–53 season, Mikan led the NBA in rebounding, averaging 14.4 rebounds per game (rpg), and was named MVP of the 1953 NBA All-Star Game.[35] After a 48–22 regular season, the Lakers defeated the Fort Wayne Pistons in the Western playoffs to advance to the NBA Finals.[38] They then defeated the New York Knicks to win their second straight championship.[39] Though Lakers star George Mikan suffered from knee problems throughout the 1953–54 season, he was still able to average 18 ppg.[40] Clyde Lovellette, who was drafted in 1952, helped the team win the Western Division.[40] The team won its third straight championship in the 1950s and sixth in seven seasons when it defeated the Syracuse Nationals in seven games.[39] Following Mikan's retirement in the 1954 off-season, the Lakers struggled but still managed to win 40 games. Although they defeated the Rochester Royals in the first round of the playoffs, they were defeated by the Fort Wayne Pistons in the semifinals.[41] Although they had losing records the next two seasons, they made the playoffs each year.[37] Mikan came back for the last half of the 1955–56 season, but struggled and retired for good after the season.[42] Led by Lovellette's 20.6 points and 13.5 rebounds, they advanced to the Conference Finals in 1956–57. The Lakers had one of the worst seasons in team history in 1957–58 when they won a league-low 19 games.[43] They had hired Mikan, who had been the team's general manager for the previous two seasons, as head coach to replace Kundla. Mikan was fired in January when the team was 9–30, and Kundla was rehired.[37][44] The Lakers earned the top pick in the 1958 NBA draft and used it to select Elgin Baylor. Baylor, who was named NBA Rookie of the Year and co-MVP of the 1959 NBA All-Star Game, averaged 24.9 ppg and 15.0 rpg helping the Lakers improve to second in their division despite a 33–39 record.[45] After upsetting the Hawks in six games in the division finals, they returned to the NBA Finals, but were swept by the Celtics, beginning their long rivalry.[46] In their last year in Minneapolis, the Lakers went 25–50. On January 18, 1960, the team was coming off a loss and traveling to St. Louis when their plane crash-landed.[49] Snow storms had driven the pilot 150 miles off course when he was forced to land in a cornfield. No one was hurt.[50] Their record earned them the number two pick in the 1960 NBA draft. The team selected Jerry West from West Virginia University.[51] During the 1960 off-season, the Lakers became the NBA's first West Coast team when owner Bob Short decided to move the team to Los Angeles.[52] Led by Baylor's 34.8 ppg and 19.8 rpg, Los Angeles won 11 more than the year before in West's first season.[53] On November 15 that season, Baylor set a new NBA scoring record when he scored 71 points in a victory against the New York Knicks while grabbing 25 rebounds.[54] In doing so, Baylor broke his own NBA record of 64 points. Despite a losing record, the Lakers made the playoffs.[37] They came within two points of the NBA Finals when they lost in game seven of their second round series against St. Louis.[55] Led by Baylor and West at 38.3 and 30.8 ppg respectively,[56] the Lakers improved to 54–26 in 1961–62, and made the finals. In a game five victory, Baylor grabbed 22 rebounds and set the still-standing NBA record for points in a finals game with 61,[57] despite fouling out of the game.[58] The Lakers, however, lost to the Celtics by three points in overtime of game seven.[56] Frank Selvy, after making two jumpers in the final 40 seconds to tie the game,[59][60] missed a potential game-winning 18 foot jump shot in regulation, a miss which he said in June 2010 still haunted him more than 40 years later.[60] Los Angeles won 53 games in 1962–63, behind Baylor's 34.0 ppg and West's 27.1 ppg[61] but lost in the NBA Finals in six games to the Celtics.[61] After falling to 42–38 and losing in the first round of the 1964 NBA playoffs to the Hawks, the team won 49 games in 1964–65. The Lakers surged past the Baltimore Bullets in the division finals, behind West's record-setting 46.3 ppg in the series.[62] They lost again to the Celtics in the Finals however, this time in five games.[63] Los Angeles lost in the finals to Boston in seven games again in 1966, this time by two points.[64] Down by 16 entering the fourth quarter, and 10 with a minute and a half to go, the Lakers mounted a furious rally in the closing moments, which fell just short.[65] After dropping to 36 wins and losing in the first round of the 1967 NBA playoffs, they lost in the finals to the Celtics again in 1968.[37] Los Angeles moved to a brand-new arena, The Forum, in 1967, after playing seven seasons at the Los Angeles Memorial Sports Arena. On July 9, 1968, the team acquired Wilt Chamberlain from the Philadelphia 76ers for Darrell Imhoff, Archie Clark, and Jerry Chambers.[67] In his first season as a Laker, Chamberlain set a team record by averaging a league-leading 21.1 rpg.[68] West, Baylor, and Chamberlain each averaged over 20 points, and Los Angeles won their division.[69] The Lakers and Celtics again met in the finals, and Los Angeles had home court advantage against Boston for the first time in their rivalry. They won the first game behind Jerry West's 53 points,[70] and had a 3–2 lead after five.[71] Boston won the series in seven games however,[72] and earned their 11th NBA Championship in 13 seasons.[73] West was named the first-ever Finals MVP; this remains the only time that a member of the losing team has won the award.[74] In 1970, West won his first scoring title at 31.2 ppg, the team returned to the finals, and for the first time in 16 years, they did not have to face the Celtics; instead playing the New York Knicks, who defeated them 4–3.[75][76] The next season the Lakers were defeated by the Milwaukee Bucks, led by future Laker Lew Alcindor (now known as Kareem Abdul-Jabbar) in the Western Conference Finals.[77] The 1971–72 season brought several changes. Owner Jack Kent Cooke brought in Bill Sharman as head coach,[78] and Elgin Baylor announced his retirement early in the season after realizing that his legs were not healthy enough.[78] Sharman increased the team's discipline.[79] He introduced the concept of the shootaround, where players would arrive at the arena early in the morning before a game to practice shots.[80] They won 14 straight games in November and all 16 games played in December.[78] They won three straight to open the year of 1972 but on January 9, the Milwaukee Bucks ended their winning streak by defeating the Lakers, 120–104.[81] By winning 33 straight games, Los Angeles set a record for longest winning streak of any team in major American professional team sports.[82][83] The Lakers won 69 games that season, which stood as the NBA record for 24 years until the Chicago Bulls won 72 games in 1995–96.[84] Chamberlain averaged a low 14.8 points but led the league in rebounding at 19.2 a game.[85] West's 9.7 assists per game (apg) led the league, he also averaged more than 25 points, and was named MVP of the 1972 NBA All-Star Game.[85] The team failed to score 100 points just once all year,[86] and at the end of the season, Bill Sharman was named Coach of the Year.[87] The Lakers went on to reach the finals against the New York Knicks where they would avenge their 1970 finals loss by defeating them 4 games to 1. Chamberlain tallied 24 points and 29 rebounds in game five and won the NBA Finals Most Valuable Player Award.[88][89] The Lakers won 60 games in the 1972–73 season, and took another Pacific Division title.[90] Wilt Chamberlain, playing in his final season, again led the league in rebounding and set the NBA record for field-goal percentage at 72.7% which stood for several decades.[90] The team defeated the Chicago Bulls in seven games in the conference semifinals, then the Golden State Warriors in five in the Western Division Finals.[90] They played the New York Knicks in the 1973 NBA Finals. Los Angeles took the first game by three points, but New York won the series in five games.[91] During the 1973–74 season, the team was hampered by the loss of West, who played only 31 games before his legs gave out.[92] Goodrich, averaging 25.3 points, helped the team to a late-season surge.[92] Trailing the Golden State Warriors by three games with seven left to play, the Lakers rallied to finish 47–35 and win the Pacific Division.[92] They made the playoffs but managed just one win against Milwaukee in the conference semifinals. Following the season, West retired due to contract disagreements with Cooke, and filed a suit for unpaid back wages.[93] After missing the playoffs in the 1974–75 season, the Lakers acquired Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, who had won three league MVPs by that time.[94] Abdul-Jabbar wanted out of Milwaukee, demanding a trade to either New York or Los Angeles.[95] He was traded for Elmore Smith, Brian Winters, Junior Bridgeman, and Dave Meyers. Abdul-Jabbar had his fourth MVP season in 1975–76, leading the league in rebounding, blocked shots, and minutes played.[96] The Lakers struggled in January, going 3–10, and finished out of the playoffs at 40–42.[96] West and Cooke settled their differences—and the former Laker's lawsuit—and Cooke hired him to replace Sharman as the team's coach.[97] West became upset, however, when Cooke refused to spend the money necessary to acquire forward Julius Erving, who the Nets were selling.[98] Behind another MVP season from Abdul-Jabbar, Los Angeles won the Pacific Division, finishing the 1976–77 season a league-best 53–29.[99] They defeated the Warriors in a seven-game series to open the postseason before being swept by Portland in the Western Conference Finals.[96] During the off-season, Los Angeles picked up Jamaal Wilkes from Golden State and signed first-round draft pick Norm Nixon. In the first two minutes of the first game of the 1977–78 season, Abdul-Jabbar punched Bucks center Kent Benson for an overly aggressive elbow and broke his hand.[100] Two months later, a healthy Abdul-Jabbar got into an altercation with Houston Rockets center Kevin Kunnert after a rebound. The team's starting power forward, Kermit Washington, who was averaging 11.5 points and 11.2 rebounds,[101] entered the fight, and when Rudy Tomjanovich ran in from the bench to break up the action, Washington punched him in the face.[102] Tomjanovich nearly died from the punch, suffering a fractured skull and other facial injuries, which prematurely ended his playing career.[103] Washington, who stated that he assumed Tomjanovich was a combatant, was suspended for two months by the NBA, and released by the Lakers.[104] The team won 45 games despite being down a starter in Washington and not having Abdul-Jabbar for nearly two months, but lost in the first round of the playoffs to Seattle.[105] During the 1978–79 season, the team posted a 47–35 record but lost to the SuperSonics in the semifinal round of the playoffs.[96] In the 1979 NBA draft, Los Angeles selected 6-foot, 9-inch point guard Magic Johnson from Michigan State with the first overall pick.[106] It took Johnson's teammates time to acclimate themselves to his passing ability, as his \"no-look\" passes often caught them unaware. Once they adjusted, his passing became a key part of Los Angeles' offense.[107] The Lakers won 60 games in Johnson's rookie year, and defeated the Philadelphia 76ers in six games in the 1980 NBA Finals. Johnson won the Finals MVP award, after starting at center for the injured Abdul-Jabbar in game six, and tallying 42 points, 15 rebounds, and seven assists.[108] The team fell off in the 1980–81 season, though, as the Lakers lost Johnson for most of the season to a knee injury.[109] The team turned in a 54–28 record and finished second behind the Phoenix Suns in the Pacific Division.[109] The Rockets, led by Moses Malone, defeated Los Angeles in the first round of the playoffs.[109] Early in the 1981–82 season, Johnson complained to the media about head coach Paul Westhead and demanded a trade.[110] Westhead was fired shortly after Johnson's criticisms, and although Lakers' owner Jerry Buss stated that Johnson's comments did not factor into the decision, Johnson was vilified by the national media and booed both on the road and at home.[111][112][113] Buss promoted assistant coach Pat Riley to \"co-head coach\" with Jerry West (although West considered himself Riley's assistant) on November 19 and the team won 17 of its next 20 games.[109][114][115] Nicknamed \"Showtime\" due to the team's new Johnson-led fast break-offense, the Lakers won the Pacific Division title and swept both the Suns and Spurs in the 1982 playoffs.[116] Los Angeles stretched its postseason winning streak to nine games by taking the first contest of the NBA Finals from the 76ers.[109][117] The team won the Finals 4–2 to finish a 12–2 playoff run.[109] On draft night in 1982, the Lakers had the first overall pick (the result of a trade with Cleveland midway through the 1979–80 season, when the Lakers had sent Don Ford and a 1980 first-round pick to the Cavaliers for Butch Lee and their 1982 selection) and selected James Worthy from North Carolina.[118] The Lakers won the Pacific Division at 58–24, but Worthy suffered a leg injury in the last week of the season and missed the rest of the season.[119] Nevertheless, they advanced to play Philadelphia in the 1983 NBA Finals after defeating Portland and San Antonio.[119] The Sixers, however, won the series and the championship in four games.[118] After the season West replaced Sharman as the team's GM.[120] In the 1983–84 season, Los Angeles went 54–28, and played Boston in the Finals for the first time since 1969.[121] The Lakers won two of the first three games. However, Kevin McHale's hard clothesline foul of Lakers forward Kurt Rambis on a fast break is credited as a turning point of the series.[122] Boston won three of the next four to win the title and send Los Angeles's record to 0–8 in Finals series against the Celtics.[121] Using the past year's Finals defeat as motivation, the team won the Pacific Division for the fourth straight year and lost just two games in the Western Conference playoffs. In the NBA Finals, the Celtics were again the Lakers' final hurdle. Los Angeles lost game one of the NBA Finals by a score of 148–114, in what is remembered as the \"Memorial Day Massacre\".[123] The Lakers, behind 38-year-old Finals MVP Abdul-Jabbar, recovered to defeat the Celtics in six games.[124] The team won the title in the Boston Garden and became the first visiting team to ever win an NBA championship in Boston, as the Golden State Warriors later achieved this feat in 2022.[123] In the 1985–86 season, the Lakers started 24–3 and went on to win 62 games and their fifth straight division title.[126] The Rockets, however, defeated the Lakers in five games in the Western Conference Finals. Houston won the series when Ralph Sampson hit a 20-foot jumper as time expired in game five at The Forum.[126] Prior to the 1986–87 season, the Lakers moved A.C. Green into the starting lineup, and acquired Mychal Thompson from the Spurs.[127] Johnson won his first career MVP Award while leading the Lakers to a 65–17 record,[127] and Michael Cooper was named NBA Defensive Player of the Year.[127] Before the season, Riley had made the decision to shift the focus of the offense to Johnson over the 40-year-old Abdul-Jabbar.[128] The Lakers advanced to the NBA Finals by sweeping the Nuggets, defeating the Warriors in five games, and sweeping the SuperSonics in the Western Conference Finals.[129] The Lakers defeated Boston in the first two games of the Finals, and the teams split the next four games, giving Los Angeles their second championship in three seasons.[127] The series was highlighted by Johnson's running \"baby hook\" shot to win game four at Boston Garden with two seconds remaining.[130] Johnson was named the NBA Finals MVP, in addition to regular season MVP.[131] At the Lakers' championship celebration in Los Angeles, coach Riley brashly declared that Los Angeles would repeat as NBA champions,[127] which no team had done since the 1968–69 Boston Celtics. Looking to make good on Riley's promise in the 1987–88 season, the Lakers took their seventh consecutive Pacific Division title with a 62–20 record. They swept the Spurs in the first round of the Western Conference Finals before pulling out a tough seven-game series win over the Utah Jazz led by youngsters Karl Malone and John Stockton. A seven-game Western Conference finals win over the Dallas Mavericks propelled the Lakers to the NBA Finals once again. In their seventh trip to the Finals in nine years, they met the Detroit Pistons. Los Angeles would take the series in seven games, and James Worthy's game seven triple-double earned him a Finals MVP award.[132] The win marked their fifth title in nine years, but would also mark their last title until 2000. In the 1988–89 season, Los Angeles won 57 games and their eighth consecutive Pacific Division crown. They swept through the playoffs defeating Portland, Seattle, and Phoenix. In an eighth trip to the NBA Finals in 10 years, they once again faced the Detroit Pistons.[133] Hampered by injuries to Byron Scott and Johnson, the Lakers were swept by Detroit.[134] Following the 1989 Finals, on June 28, 1989, after 20 professional seasons, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar announced his retirement. The Lakers still cruised through the Pacific Division, winning their ninth consecutive division crown with a 63–19 record. However, after beating the Rockets in the first round, they lost four games to one in the second round of the playoffs to the Suns.[135] Riley announced he was stepping down after the season citing burnout,[136] and was replaced by Mike Dunleavy.[137] Riley's departure received a mixed reaction from the players. They respected his contributions, but some, such as Worthy and Scott, had grown tired of his intense practices and felt he tried to take too much credit for the team's successes.[138] Following the season, 1987 Defensive Player of the Year winner Michael Cooper decided to play in Europe and was waived at his request.[139] The 1990–91 Lakers failed to win the Pacific Division for the first time in 10 years, but still finished with a 58–24 record. After cruising through the Western Conference playoffs, the Lakers found themselves in the NBA Finals once again, their ninth trip to the Finals in 12 years. The 1991 Finals represented a changing of the guard as the Lakers were defeated in five games by the Chicago Bulls, led by superstar Michael Jordan.[140] On November 7, 1991, Magic Johnson announced he had tested positive for HIV and would retire immediately.[141] In their first season without Johnson, the team won 43 games to earn the eighth seed in the Western Conference playoffs.[37] The Lakers were defeated in the first round by Portland. Following the season, head coach Mike Dunleavy was fired. The Lakers would lose 43 games in 1992–93 under Randy Pfund, their first losing season since 1976. The Lakers would still make the playoffs, and would become the first eighth seed to win the opening two games on the road against a number one seed when they took a 2–0 lead against Phoenix.[142] They lost the next two games at home however, then game five in Phoenix in overtime.[142] During the 1993–94 season, Pfund was fired during the season that would result in the Lakers failing to make the playoffs for the first time since 1976. Magic Johnson, would coach the final 16 games of the season with former teammate Michael Cooper as his lead assistant.[143] Johnson decided not to take the job permanently due to what he felt was a lack of commitment from certain players, and Los Angeles ended the season with a 10-game losing streak to finish 33–49.[144][145] Under new coach Del Harris, Los Angeles made the playoffs each of the next two seasons but was eliminated in the second and first rounds respectively.[146][147] The team was led by young guards Nick Van Exel and Eddie Jones.[148] Johnson came out of retirement to return as a player in the 1995–96 season to lead the then 24–18 Lakers to a 29–11 finish.[149] After some run-ins with Van Exel, displeasure with Harris's strategies, and a first-round loss to the Rockets, Johnson decided to retire for the final time after the season.[150] During the 1996 off-season, the Lakers acquired 17-year-old Kobe Bryant from the Charlotte Hornets for Vlade Divac; Bryant was drafted 13th overall out of Lower Merion High School in Ardmore, Pennsylvania in that year's draft, by Charlotte. Los Angeles also signed free-agent Shaquille O'Neal.[151] Trading for Bryant was West's idea, and he was influential in the team's signing of the all-star center.[152] \"Jerry West is the reason I came to the Lakers\", O'Neal later said.[153] They used their 24th pick in the draft to select Derek Fisher.[154] During the season, the team traded Cedric Ceballos to Phoenix for Robert Horry.[155] O'Neal led the team to a 56–26 record, their best effort since 1990–91, despite missing 31 games due to a knee injury.[156] O'Neal averaged 26.2 ppg and 12.5 rpg and finished third in the league in blocked shots (2.88 bpg) in 51 games.[156][157] The Lakers defeated the Portland Trail Blazers in the first round of the playoffs as O'Neal scored 46 points in Game 1 against the Trail Blazers, marking the highest single-game playoff scoring output by a Laker since Jerry West scored 53 against the Celtics in 1969.[156] In the next round, the Lakers lost in five games to the Utah Jazz.[156] In the 1997–98 season, O'Neal and the Lakers had the best start in franchise history, 11–0.[158] O'Neal would miss 20 games on the season due to an abdominal injury.[158] Los Angeles battled Seattle for the Pacific Division title most of the season. In the final two months, the Lakers won 22 of their final 25 games,[158] finishing 61–21, but still finished second to Seattle in the standings.[158] The Lakers defeated Portland three games to one in the first round to advance to face Seattle. Although the Sonics won the first game, the Lakers responded with four straight wins, taking the series,[158] but were swept by the Jazz in the Western Conference Finals.[158] During the 1998–99 season, All-Star guard Eddie Jones and center Elden Campbell were traded to the Charlotte Hornets.[159] The team also acquired J. R. Reid, B. J. Armstrong, and Glen Rice.[160] Head coach Del Harris was fired in February after a three-game losing streak and replaced on an interim basis by former Laker Kurt Rambis.[161] The team finished 31–19 in the strike-shortened season, which was fourth in the Western Conference.[162] The Lakers defeated Houston in the first round of the playoffs, but were swept by San Antonio in the next round. Game four of the series would be the last game ever played at the Great Western Forum.[163] Before the 1999–2000 season, West was prepared to hire Rambis as the team's full-time coach before an outcry from fans and members of the organization caused him to seek out a bigger name.[164] Los Angeles hired former Chicago Bulls coach Phil Jackson, who had coached that team to six championships, and gave him a lucrative $6 million a year contract.[165] He brought along assistant Tex Winter and they installed Winter's version of the triangle offense.[166] The Lakers signed veterans Brian Shaw, John Salley, Ron Harper, and A.C. Green, who was a Laker during the \"Showtime\" era.[155] The team also moved to a new arena, the Staples Center.[167] Led by league MVP O'Neal, the Lakers won 31 of their first 36 games.[168] They finished 67–15, the highest win total since they won 65 in the 1986–87 season.[168] Then eliminated Sacramento and Phoenix in the first two rounds of the playoffs.[169] After the Lakers took a three games to one lead in the Western Conference Finals against Portland, the Trail Blazers won the next two games to force a game seven.[170] The Lakers, who trailed by 15 points in the fourth quarter, would go on 19–4 run to tie the game and eventually win 89–84 to advance to the NBA Finals.[170] In their first trip to the Finals since 1991, the Lakers defeated Reggie Miller and the Indiana Pacers four games to two win their first title since 1988.[171] West retired from his spot in the team's front office after the season after a power struggle between him and Jackson over control of the team's operations.[172] After the season, starters Rice and Green left the team,[173] and Los Angeles signed Horace Grant.[174] The following season, the Lakers won 11 fewer regular season games than the prior year,[175] but swept the first three rounds of the playoffs, defeating the Portland, Sacramento, and San Antonio.[176] They met Allen Iverson and the Philadelphia 76ers in the NBA Finals. Although the Sixers took game one in overtime,[177] the Lakers won the next four games to win their second straight title. Their 15–1 postseason record was the best in NBA history.[178] The Lakers won 58 games in 2001–02. In the playoffs, they swept Portland and defeated San Antonio four games to one to advance to the Western Conference Finals to face Sacramento.[181] The series would go on to be known as one of the greatest playoff matchups in NBA history. The series extended to all seven games and ended in a Lakers victory.[182] In game one, Bryant scored 30 points as the Lakers won, 106–99. The series would then shift in Sacramento's favor, with the Kings winning the next two games. Facing a deficit in game 4, the Lakers had the ball with under 20 seconds to play. After misses by both Bryant and O'Neal, Kings center Vlade Divac tapped the ball away from the rim in an attempt to wind down the clock. It went straight into Robert Horry's hands, who drained a game-winning three with under three seconds to play. After the Kings won game five on a buzzer-beater by Mike Bibby, the Lakers were faced with a must-win game six. In one of the most controversial playoff games in league history (Tim Donaghy's betting scandal), the Lakers would win by four points.[183] The Lakers went on to win game seven in overtime, with the Kings missing numerous potentially game-saving shots and free throws. The Lakers then achieved a three-peat by sweeping Jason Kidd and the New Jersey Nets in the NBA Finals.[184] O'Neal won each of the Finals series' MVP awards, making him the only player besides Michael Jordan to win three consecutive Finals MVPs.[185] The Lakers would attempt a four-peat the following year, but started the 2002–03 season 11–19.[186] However, they finished the season 39–13 to finish 50–32.[187] They defeated Minnesota in the first round of the playoffs, but the four-peat attempt ended as they were eliminated by San Antonio in six games in the second round.[188] During the 2003–04 season, the team was the subject of intense media coverage generated by the teaming of four stars and the sexual-assault case involving Kobe Bryant.[189][190] Before the season, the Lakers signed two-time MVP Karl Malone formerly of the Jazz, and former Seattle Defensive Player of the Year Gary Payton to join O'Neal and Bryant,[191] forming the first \"superteam\" of the 21st century.[192][193] Three of the \"big four\", however, struggled with injuries: O'Neal suffered from a strained calf, Malone an injured knee, and Bryant an injured shoulder.[194][195] The Lakers started 18–3 and finished 56–26 and won the Pacific Division title, entering the playoffs as the No. 2 seed. They defeated Houston, San Antonio, and Minnesota to advance to the NBA Finals.[196] In the Finals, they would lose to Detroit in five games. During the 2004 off-season, the team entered a rebuilding phase when O'Neal was traded to the Miami Heat for Lamar Odom, Brian Grant, Caron Butler, and a first-round draft pick.[197] Bryant and O'Neal had clashed in the past,[198] and the media credited their feud as one of the motivating factors for the trade.[199] Jackson did not return as head coach, and wrote a book about the team's 2003–04 season, in which he heavily criticized Bryant and called him \"uncoachable\".[200][201][202] The Lakers front office said that the book contained \"several inaccuracies\".[203] The Lakers also traded Rick Fox and Gary Payton to Boston, for Chris Mihm, Marcus Banks, and Chucky Atkins before the 2004–05 season.[204] Derek Fisher, frustrated with losing playing time, opted out of his contract and signed with the Warriors.[204] The team hired Rudy Tomjanovich to replace Jackson.[204] After sitting out the first half of the 2004–05 season, Malone announced his retirement on February 13, 2005.[205] Tomjanovich coached the team to a 22–19 record before resigning due to health problems.[206] Assistant Frank Hamblen was named interim head coach to replace Tomjanovich for the remainder of the season.[207] Bryant (ankle) and Odom (shoulder) suffered injuries, and the Lakers finished 34–48, missing the playoffs for only the fifth time in franchise history and the first time since 1994.[37] With the tenth overall pick in the 2005 NBA draft, the Lakers selected Andrew Bynum, a center from St. Joseph High School in Metuchen, New Jersey.[208] The team also traded Caron Butler and Chucky Atkins to Washington for Kwame Brown and Laron Profit.[209] Jackson returned to coach the team after Rudy Tomjanovich resigned midway through the previous season.[210] On January 22, 2006, Bryant scored 81 points against Toronto, the second-highest total in NBA history.[211] Ending the season 45–37, the team made the playoffs after a one-season absence.[212] After taking a three games to one lead in the first round, Phoenix came back to take the series in seven games.[213] In the following season, the Lakers won 26 of their first 39 games,[214] but lost 27 of their last 43—including seven in a row at one point—to finish 42–40.[214] They were eliminated in the first round by Phoenix again.[214] Frustrated by the team's inability to advance in the playoffs, Bryant demanded to be traded in the off-season.[215] Buss initially agreed to seek a trade,[216] but also worked to try to change Bryant's mind.[217] After re-acquiring Derek Fisher, the Lakers started the 2007–08 season with a 25–11 record, before Andrew Bynum, their center who was leading the league in field-goal percentage, went out for the year due to a knee injury in mid-January.[218] In what would become a crucial transfer for the franchise's return to championship form, they acquired the six-time all-star power forward Pau Gasol from the Memphis Grizzlies in a trade in early February and went 22–5 to finish the season.[219] The Lakers' 57–25 record earned them the first seed in the Western Conference.[220] Bryant was awarded the league's MVP award, becoming the first Laker to win the award since O'Neal in 2000.[221][222] In the playoffs, they defeated the Nuggets in four games, the Jazz in six, and the defending champion Spurs in five, but lost to the Celtics in six games in the NBA Finals.[223] In the 2008–09 season, the Lakers finished 65–17; the best record in the Western Conference.[224] They defeated the Jazz in five games, the Rockets in seven and the Nuggets in six, to win the Western Conference title. They then won their 15th NBA championship by defeating the Orlando Magic in five games in the NBA finals.[225] Bryant was named the NBA Finals MVP for the first time in his career.[226] The Lakers, who had added Ron Artest (Metta World Peace)[227] in place of Trevor Ariza in their starting lineup, finished the 2009–10 season with the best record in the Western Conference for the third straight time. On January 13, 2010, the Lakers became the first team in NBA history to win 3,000 regular-season games by defeating the Dallas Mavericks 100–95.[228] They defeated the Oklahoma City Thunder, the Utah Jazz, and the Phoenix Suns in the Western Conference playoffs. In the finals, the Lakers played the Boston Celtics for the 12th time. They rallied back from a 3–2 disadvantage in the series and erased a 13-point deficit in the fourth quarter of the seventh game to defeat the Celtics. This series win gave them their 16th NBA title overall and 11th since they moved to Los Angeles.[229] Bryant was named Finals MVP for the second year in a row, despite a 6–24 shooting performance in game seven.[230] After much speculation, head coach Phil Jackson returned for the 2010–11 season.[231] In the playoffs, the Lakers defeated the New Orleans Hornets in the first round.[232] But their opportunity for a three-peat was denied by the Dallas Mavericks in a four-game sweep of the second round. After the season, it was announced that Jackson will not be returning to coach the Lakers.[233] After Jackson's retirement, former Cleveland Cavaliers head coach Mike Brown was hired as head coach on May 25, 2011.[234] Before the start of the shortened 2011–12 season, the Lakers traded Lamar Odom to the Dallas Mavericks after Odom requested to be traded.[235] On the trade deadline long time Laker Derek Fisher along with a first round draft pick were traded to the Houston Rockets for Jordan Hill.[236] With a 41–25 regular season record the Lakers entered the playoffs as the third seed, the team defeated the Denver Nuggets in the first round in seven games but were eliminated by the Oklahoma City Thunder in the second round in five games.[237][238] On July 4, 2012, Steve Nash of the Phoenix Suns agreed to a sign-and-trade deal that would send him to the Lakers in exchange for the Lakers' 2013 and 2015 first round draft picks, 2013 and 2014 second round draft picks, and $3 million. The trade was made official on July 11, 2012, the first day the trade moratorium was lifted.[239] On August 10, 2012, in a four-team trade the Lakers traded Andrew Bynum and acquired Dwight Howard.[240] The combination of these players with Bryant and Gasol led media outlets to refer to them as a \"superteam\" comparable to the 2003-04 Lakers.[241][242] On November 9, 2012, Mike Brown was relieved of coaching duties after a 1–4 start to the 2012–13 season.[243] Assistant Coach Bernie Bickerstaff took over as interim head coach, leading the Lakers to a 5–5 record. On November 12, 2012, the Lakers hired Mike D'Antoni as head coach.[244] On February 18, 2013, Lakers owner Jerry Buss died from cancer at age 80.[245] On the court, D'Antoni coached the Lakers to a 40–32 record the rest of the way to finish 45–37, their worst record since 2007. The Lakers clinched a playoff berth on the final game of the season and finished seventh in the Western Conference after beating the Houston Rockets on April 16, 2013.[246][247] The Lakers battled injuries all season, the most prominent of which is the Achilles tendon rupture to Kobe Bryant that ended his season after 78 games. The absence of Bryant was sorely felt as the Lakers were swept by the San Antonio Spurs in the first round of the 2013 NBA playoffs.[248] Nevertheless, Bryant passed Lakers legend Wilt Chamberlain to become the fourth all-time leading scorer in NBA history on March 30, 2013, against the Sacramento Kings.[249] On December 8, 2013, Bryant played in his first game since tearing his Achilles tendon on April 12, 2013.[250] However, on December 17, 2013, he suffered a broken bone in his knee, and did not return for the remainder of the season.[251][252] On March 25, 2014, the Lakers scored 51 points in the third quarter against the New York Knicks, the most points scored in a quarter in the history of the franchise.[253] The Lakers went on to miss the NBA playoffs for the first time since 2005, for just the second time in the last two decades and for just the sixth time in franchise history. On April 30, 2014, Mike D'Antoni resigned from his position as head coach after a 27–55 season.[254] After spending the majority of the off-season without a head coach, the Lakers named former player Byron Scott as the new head coach.[255] After the season, he was the frontrunner to become the new Lakers head coach. Scott interviewed three times for the position, which had become vacant after Mike D'Antoni's resignation.[256] On July 28, 2014, he signed a multi-year contract to coach the Lakers.[257] During the first game of the 2014–15 season, the seventh overall pick in the 2014 NBA draft, Julius Randle went down with a broken leg, which ended his rookie season. The Lakers began their season losing 10 of their first 16 games. After playing only 35 games, Kobe Bryant tore a rotator cuff in his shoulder ending his season. Nick Young was also forced to end his season with a fractured kneecap, leaving the team with a record of 14–41.[258] With 27 games left in the regular season, Byron Scott gave rookie Jordan Clarkson more playing time. Clarkson, the 46th overall pick in the 2014 draft, finished his rookie season with game stats of 11.9 ppg, 3.2 rpg, 3.5 apg, and shooting 44.8% from the field.[259] The Lakers' season ended with a record of 21–61, the fourth worst record in the league and at the time the worst record in franchise history. The next season, the Lakers had the second overall pick of the 2015 NBA draft, which they used to select Ohio State freshman point guard D'Angelo Russell. The team also selected Larry Nance Jr. with the 27th overall pick.[260] On November 30, 2015, Bryant announced he would retire at the end of the season after 20 seasons with the team.[261] In Bryant's last season the team missed the playoffs for the third straight year with a 17–65 record, the worst in franchise history.[262] On April 24, 2016, the Lakers announced that they would not exercise their option on Byron Scott's contract for the following season.[263] On April 29, the team announced another former Laker, Luke Walton, as their new head coach. At the time of his hiring, Walton was an assistant coach for the Golden State Warriors, who were in the playoffs, so he could not officially begin his duties as head coach until the Warriors' playoff run was over.[264] The Lakers earned the second overall pick in the 2016 NBA draft,[265] and selected Brandon Ingram from Duke University.[266] The team also selected Ivica Zubac with the 32nd overall pick.[267] On February 21, 2017, the Lakers fired general manager Mitch Kupchak, while Magic Johnson was named as the president of basketball operations. The team's governor Jeanie Buss, also announced the removal of her brother, Jim Buss, from his position as executive vice president of basketball operations.[268][269] On March 7, 2017, the Lakers hired Rob Pelinka as the general manager, signing him to a five-year deal.[270] The Lakers again earned the second overall pick, this time, in the 2017 NBA draft,[271] and selected Lonzo Ball from UCLA.[272] The Lakers also acquired Kyle Kuzma from the University of Utah with the 27th overall pick from a draft-day trade, along with Brook Lopez in exchange for D'Angelo Russell and Timofey Mozgov.[273] The Lakers also traded their 28th overall pick, Tony Bradley, in exchange for the 30th overall pick, Josh Hart, from Villanova University and the 42nd overall pick, Thomas Bryant, from Indiana University.[274] In February 2018, Nance Jr. and Clarkson were traded away to the Cleveland Cavaliers in exchange for Isaiah Thomas, Channing Frye, and a 2018 first-round draft pick.[275] On July 2, 2018, Randle was renounced by the Lakers.[276] On July 9, 2018, the Lakers signed LeBron James to a four-year, $154 million contract.[277][278] By the Christmas Day game, the Lakers were six games over .500 before James sustained a groin injury leading to several weeks of missed games. Ball and Ingram also ended their seasons early due to injuries. On February 7, 2019, Zubac was traded to the Los Angeles Clippers along with Michael Beasley in exchange for Mike Muscala.[279] On April 9, 2019, Johnson stepped down as the team's president of basketball operations,[280] and two days later, the Lakers parted ways with head coach Walton after the team failed to reach the playoffs for the sixth straight year.[281] On May 13, Frank Vogel was named the Lakers' head coach.[282] The Lakers received the fourth overall pick in the 2019 NBA draft lottery.[283] On July 6, the Lakers acquired Anthony Davis from the New Orleans Pelicans for Ball, Ingram, Hart, and three first-round picks, including the number four overall in the 2019 draft.[284] This trade officially ended the young core era of the Lakers; only Kuzma remained out of the group of players. Following the suspension of the 2019–20 NBA season, the Lakers were one of the 22 teams invited to the NBA Bubble to participate in the final eight games of the regular season.[285] The Lakers finished the regular season with a 52–19 record, entering the playoffs for the first time since 2013,[286] and as the top seed for the first time since 2010.[287] They advanced to the NBA Finals for the first time since 2010.[288] They defeated the Miami Heat 4–2 to win the 2020 NBA Finals,[289] and James was named the Finals MVP for the fourth time in his career.[290] The win gave Los Angeles their 17th championship in franchise history, tying the Boston Celtics for the most all-time.[291] Primary Lakers owner Jeanie Buss, who took over the team in 2017, would also become the first female controlling owner of an NBA team to win the NBA Finals.[292] During the 2021 off-season, the Lakers picked up many NBA veterans, the most notable of which was Russell Westbrook, who was acquired in a blockbuster trade with the Washington Wizards. Kyle Kuzma, the last player left from the Lakers' young core era, was traded away, along with others. Other veterans picked up during the off-season included Carmelo Anthony, DeAndre Jordan, and returning players Wayne Ellington, Trevor Ariza, Dwight Howard and Rajon Rondo.[293] Alex Caruso left the Lakers and signed with the Chicago Bulls, and veteran locker-room voice Jared Dudley retired.[294][295] The Lakers made a surprising run in the 2023 Playoffs, making the Western Conference Finals, but were defeated by the eventual champion Denver Nuggets. On December 9, 2023, the Lakers won the inaugural NBA In-Season Tournament after defeating the Indiana Pacers in the championship game. James was named the inaugural tournament MVP.[296] They finished the 2023–24 season 47–35 and beat the New Orleans Pelicans in the Play-In to make the playoffs as the seventh seed. On June 27, 2024, the Lakers selected Bronny James, the son of LeBron, at 55th overall in the 2024 NBA draft, forming the first father-son duo in NBA history.[297] JJ Redick was hired as head coach of the Lakers.[298] On October 23, 2024, the team made NBA history as being the first one to have father and son (LeBron James & Bronny James) play together as they beat Minnesota Timberwolves on their season opening game.[299] The rivalry between the Boston Celtics and the Lakers involves the two most storied basketball franchises in National Basketball Association (NBA) history. It has been called the best rivalry in the NBA.[300] The two teams have met a record 12 times in the NBA Finals, starting with their first Finals meeting in 1959. They would go on to dominate the league in the 1960s and the 1980s, facing each other six times in the 1960s and three times in the 1980s. The rivalry had been less intense since the retirements of Magic Johnson and Larry Bird in the early 1990s, but in 2008 it was renewed as the Celtics and Lakers met in the Finals for the first time since 1987, with the Celtics winning the series 4–2. They faced off once again in the 2010 NBA Finals, which the Lakers won in 7 games. The two teams were tied for the highest number of championships, with 17 titles apiece, until the Celtics surpassed this record in the 2024 NBA Finals; together, the 35 championships account for almost half of the 78 championships in NBA history. The all-time series record for the Lakers vs Celtics is 209–165 with the Celtics being the forerunners. Boston is the only NBA team with an overall winning record against the Lakers.[301] The rivalry between the Lakers and the Detroit Pistons developed in the late 1980s.[302]: 228 Both teams faced each other in back-to-back finals appearances in the 1988 NBA Finals, which the Lakers won in 7 games and the 1989 NBA Finals, which the Pistons won in 4 games. The rivalry reemerged in the early 2000s as both teams squared off against one another in the 2004 NBA Finals, which the Pistons won in five games. The Lakers have a lengthy history with the Golden State Warriors as both franchises relocated to California during the early 1960s. Geography does play a minor role in the rivalry; however there exists more respect between both teams and fans alike, unlike the Dodgers–Giants rivalry of MLB, or the 49ers–Rams rivalry of the NFL in which both teams express fierce animosity against one another.[303][304] The rivalry began to sprout during the 1970s as the two teams would meet six times in the postseason from 1967 to 1991. Both teams fluctuated in success at varying times, however; the Lakers recent rise following the signing of LeBron James contributed heavily to adding a level of competition between both sides as James had previously faced the Warriors in four straight finals as a member of the Cavaliers. Both teams have met seven times in the postseason, combining for 38 division titles since both teams relocated to California in the early 1960s.[305][306] The Lakers lead the all time regular season series 262–173, and the postseason series 25–11.[307][308] The rivalry between the Lakers and the Los Angeles Clippers is unique because they were the only two NBA teams to share an arena, the Crypto.com Arena. It is also one of only two intra-city rivalries in the NBA, the other being the new crosstown rivalry between the New York Knicks and Brooklyn Nets. Los Angeles fans have historically favored the Lakers.[309][310] Some contend that the term rivalry was inaccurate until the Clippers became more successful.[311] The Lakers and the Phoenix Suns rivalry didn't develop until the 2000s where the teams were led by Kobe Bryant and Steve Nash, respectively. The San Antonio Spurs and the Lakers, developed what some would classify as a rivalry in the late 1990s and early 2000s. Since 1999, the teams have met in the NBA Playoffs five times, with the clubs combining to appear in seven consecutive NBA Finals (from 1999 to 2005). Additionally, the teams combined to win five NBA championships from 1999 to 2003; the Spurs won the NBA championship in 1999, 2003, 2005, 2007 and 2014 while the Lakers won the championship in 2000, 2001, 2002, 2009 and 2010. From 1999 to 2004 the clubs' rivalry was often considered the premier rivalry in the NBA,[312] and each time the clubs faced each other in the playoffs the winner advanced to the NBA Finals. In 2008, the teams met again in the Western Conference Finals where the Spurs were handily defeated only to beat the Lakers when they met again in 2013. The Kings and the Lakers have faced each other in the playoffs nine times between 1949 and 2002, and since the Kings moved to Sacramento in 1985, both have been based in California. The 2002 Western Conference Finals was one of the most bitterly contested in NBA history, with many controversial calls in game 6.[313] The Lakers would win the series in game 7. Berger and Chalfen purchased the NBL's disbanded Detroit Gems for $15,000 in 1947, changed their name to the Lakers, and relocated them to Minnesota. Max Winter bought a third of the club in their early years and sold his share to Mikan in 1954. Berger bought Mikan's share in 1956 giving him a controlling (⅔) interest.[314] After Mikan retired, attendance plummeted and the team lost money for several seasons, leading the ownership group to put the team up for sale in 1957.[315] Marty Marion, a retired baseball player and manager, and his business partner Milton Fischman attempted to purchase the team with the intention of moving the club to Kansas City, Missouri.[315][316] Mikan offered to mortgage his home in an attempt to buy the team and keep the club in Minnesota.[317] The Lakers were sold to a group of investors led by Bob Short, however.[314] The team was sold to Short's group with the agreement that it would not be relocated to Kansas City but kept in Minnesota.[318] Short's ownership group consisted of 117 Minnesota businesses and private citizens, who amassed a total of $200,000 for the purchase; $150,000 to buy the team and $50,000 to run it.[314] By 1958 Short had become 80% owner of the team by buying out his partners,[314] but the team was floundering. Attendance remained poor, and the NBA had put the Lakers on \"financial probation\", notifying them that if they did not meet certain ticket sales numbers they could be bought out by the league and relocated. Short was forced to move the team to Los Angeles in 1960; the club had lost $60,000 in the first half of the 1959–60 season alone.[319] The NBA's owners originally voted 7–1 against the move.[320] When Short indicated that he might take the team to a new rival league that was developing, however, the owners held another vote that same day and allowed the relocation (8–0).[321] Aided by Baylor's drawing power,[322][323] and the new locale, the team's finances improved when they arrived in LA.[324][325] Short sold the team to Washington Redskins owner and publisher Jack Kent Cooke in 1965 for a then league record amount of $5.175 million.[326] Short insisted the deal be conducted in cash as he was wary of Cooke, so guards transported the money in a cart from one New York bank to another.[327] Cooke was a more hands-on owner than Short, and overhauled the team's operations.[328] He personally financed construction of the Forum in 1967 at a cost of $16.5 million.[329][330] He owned the team until 1979 when he sold it, the NHL's Los Angeles Kings, the Forum, and some real estate to Jerry Buss for $67 million.[331] Cooke was forced to sell the team as he was undergoing a costly divorce.[332][333] Buss was a local chemical engineer and former University of Southern California professor who had become wealthy in real estate.[330][334] Philip Anschutz bought a stake in the team in 1998,[335] and until October 2010 Magic Johnson was a minority owner as well.[336] Buss started the trend of allowing sponsors to add their name to team's stadiums when he renamed the Forum the Great Western Forum in 1988.[337] In 2009 major sponsors included Verizon Wireless, Toyota, Anheuser-Busch, American Express, and Carl's Jr., and the team's $113 average ticket price was the highest in the league.[335] In 2013, Buss died at the age of 80 after being hospitalized for 18 months with cancer.[338][339][340] His controlling ownership of the team passed to his six children via a trust, with each child receiving an equal vote.[341][342] Buss' succession plan had daughter Jeanie Buss assume his title as the Lakers' governor as well as its team representative at NBA Board of Governors meetings.[342][343] Given the team's proximity to Hollywood, the Lakers fanbase includes numerous celebrities, many of whom can be seen at the Staples Center during home games.[344] Jack Nicholson, for example, has held season tickets since the 1970s, and directors reportedly need to work their shooting schedules around Lakers home games.[345] From 2002 and 2007 the team averaged just over 18,900 fans, which placed them in the top ten in the NBA in attendance. Red Hot Chili Peppers' song \"Magic Johnson\", from their 1989 album Mother's Milk, is a tribute to the former point guard, and frontman Anthony Kiedis and bassist Michael \"Flea\" Balzary are frequently seen attending home games.[346] In 2008, the team sold out every home game,[347] and in 2010, the Lakers had the most popular team merchandise among all NBA teams, and Bryant the most popular jersey.[348] The Laker nickname came from the state of Minnesota being the Land of 10,000 Lakes.[14][349] The team's colors are purple, gold and white.[350][6][351] The Lakers logo consists of the team name, \"Los Angeles Lakers\" written in purple on top of a gold basketball. The team usually wears white jerseys for Sunday and holiday home games.[350][352] List of the last five seasons completed by the Lakers. For the full season-by-season history, see List of Los Angeles Lakers seasons. The Lakers have won 17 NBA titles and have appeared in the NBA Finals 15 other times.[37] These appearances include eight NBA Finals appearances in the 1980s. The best record posted by the team was 69–13, in 1972; the worst record was 17–65, in 2016.[37] Note: GP = Games played, W = Wins, L = Losses, W–L% = Winning percentage Bryant holds most individual team records for longevity including most games played (1,333), and most minutes logged (48,298). Johnson holds all significant assist records for the club including career assists (10,141), assists in a game (24), and highest assist average for a season (13.1). Johnson also has the most triple doubles, with his 138 over 100 more than the next closest player (Bryant; 17). Elmore Smith holds team records for blocks in a game (17), blocks per game for a season (4.85), and career blocks per game (3.93). The scoring records are mostly shared by Elgin Baylor and Bryant, with Baylor having the highest average for a career (27.4) while Bryant has the highest points scored in a single game (81). Baylor, Bryant and West hold the top five single-season scoring averages, with Bryant occupying the first (35.4) and fourth (31.6) spots, while Baylor has the second (34.8), and third (34.0), and West the fifth (31.3).[353][354] The Lakers hold several NBA records as a team including most consecutive games won overall (33) and most consecutive road games won (16), both of which came during the 1971–72 season,[355] highest field-goal percentage for a season at 54.5% (1984–85),[356] and highest road winning percentage at 0.816 (1971–72).[66] They also hold records for having (into the 2009–10 season) the most wins (3,027), the highest winning percentage (61.9%), and the most NBA Finals appearances (31).[37][357] The 2000–01 team set the NBA record for best playoff record at 15–1, which was later broken by the Golden State Warriors in 2017.[358] The 1971–72 team holds franchise records in wins (69), most points scored, and largest margin of victory; both of the latter came in the team's 63 point win versus Golden State (162–99).[359] They also held the record for most wins at home in the regular season (going 36–5 in 1971–72, then 37–4 in both 1976–77 and 1979–80) unil the Boston Celtics set the current record of 40–1 in the 1985–86 season. The Lakers play their home games at Crypto.com Arena, located at L.A. Live in downtown Los Angeles. The arena opened in fall 1999 and seats up to 18,997 for Lakers games.[360] Owned and operated by AEG and L.A. Arena Company, the arena is also home to the Los Angeles Clippers, the WNBA's Los Angeles Sparks, and the NHL's Los Angeles Kings.[360] Before moving to Staples Center, for 32 seasons (1967–1999), the Lakers played their home games at The Forum in Inglewood, California, located approximately 10 miles southwest of the team's current home.[167] During the 1999 preseason, the Lakers played their home games at the Forum before officially moving into Crypto.com Arena, and once again hosted a preseason game versus the Golden State Warriors on October 9, 2009, this time to commemorate the team's 50th-anniversary season in Los Angeles.[361] In the first seven years in Los Angeles, the team played their home games at the Los Angeles Memorial Sports Arena, south of downtown Los Angeles.[362] While the team played in Minneapolis, the team played their home games at the Minneapolis Auditorium and the Minneapolis Armory from 1947 to 1960.[363] Roster Last transaction: December 29, 2024 The Lakers hold the draft rights to the following unsigned draft picks who have been playing outside the NBA.[364] A drafted player, either an international draftee or a college draftee who is not signed by the team that drafted him, is allowed to sign with any non-NBA teams. In this case, the team retains the player's draft rights in the NBA until one year after the player's contract with the non-NBA team ends.[365] This list includes draft rights that were acquired from trades with other teams. The Lakers have had three first overall picks in their history: Elgin Baylor (selected in 1958), Magic Johnson (selected in 1979) and James Worthy (selected in 1982).[368] The Lakers have also had six lottery picks in their history: Eddie Jones (selected tenth overall in 1994), Andrew Bynum (selected tenth overall in 2005), Julius Randle (selected seventh overall in 2014), D'Angelo Russell (selected second overall in 2015), Brandon Ingram (selected second overall in 2016) and Lonzo Ball (selected second overall in 2017).[368] Other draft picks include Jerry West and Gail Goodrich in the 1960s, Michael Cooper and Norm Nixon in the 1970s, A.C. Green and Vlade Divac in the 1980s, Elden Campbell, Nick Van Exel, Derek Fisher and Devean George in the 1990s, and Luke Walton, Sasha Vujačić, and Ronny Turiaf in the 2000s.[368] There have been 29 head coaches for the Lakers franchise. John Kundla coached the team in Minneapolis when they won their first five BAA/NBA championships from 1949 to 1954.[52] Pat Riley is second in franchise history in both regular season and playoff games coached and wins.[369] Phil Jackson broke Riley's regular-season wins record in 2009, and he passed Riley's playoff wins and games coached records in 2010.[369] Jackson, Riley, Kundla, and Bill Sharman have all been inducted into the Basketball Hall of Fame for their coaching careers. George Mikan, Jim Pollard, Jerry West, Pat Riley, Magic Johnson, Kurt Rambis, Byron Scott and Luke Walton have all played and head-coached for the Lakers. Jackson, who had two stints as head coach, was coach from 2005 to 2011. In May 2011, Mike Brown was named his replacement for the 2011–12 season.[370] Brown was fired[371] on November 9, 2012, after a 1–4 start. Assistant coach Bernie Bickerstaff served as interim head coach for five games before the Lakers selected Mike D'Antoni as their new head coach. D'Antoni resigned at the end of the 2013–14 season. In July 2014, Byron Scott was hired as head coach.[372] After the 2015–16 season ended, Scott was fired. On April 29, 2016, former Lakers player Luke Walton was named as Scott's replacement,[373] and served as head coach until the end of the 2018–19 season.[374] Frank Vogel was named his successor on a multiyear deal announced on May 13, 2019.[375] Vogel was fired following the conclusion of the 2021–22 season.[376] On June 6, 2022, Darvin Ham was named as Vogel's successor as head coach.[377] However, Ham was fired by the Lakers on May 3, 2024, after the Lakers were eliminated in Game 5 of the first round by the Denver Nuggets. Among his accomplishments was leading the Lakers to their first In-Season Tournament championship.[378] On June 24, 2024, former NBA player JJ Redick was hired as the 29th coach in team history.[379] The Lakers have 41 Hall of Famers (31 players, 5 head coaches, 1 assistant coach, and 4 contributors) who contributed to the organization.[380][381][382] Notes: The Lakers have retired thirteen jersey numbers and an honorary microphone in honor of their players and broadcaster:[392][393][394][395][396] On January 13, 2025, Michael Cooper will have his #21 jersey retired.[397] In addition, several other players and coaches who were instrumental to the franchise's success during its days in Minneapolis have a banner commemorating them as Hall of Fame members of the Minneapolis Lakers, although jersey numbers for these players are not retired by the franchise:[400] For 41 years, Chick Hearn was the team's broadcaster until his death in 2002. He broadcast 3,338 consecutive games between November 21, 1965, and December 16, 2001.[401] Hearn came up with West's \"Mr. Clutch\" nickname.[402] He was a part of the team's \"inner sanctum\" when Cooke was owner, and was consulted on basketball decisions.[403] Paul Sunderland, who had filled in for a couple of games while Hearn recuperated in the 2001–02 season, was named the permanent play-by-play announcer. Stu Lantz was retained as the color commentator.[404] When Sunderland's contract expired in the summer of 2005, the team chose not to renew it.[405] Then, Joel Meyers moved in alongside Lantz as the television announcer, with Spero Dedes and former Laker player Mychal Thompson on the radio.[406] For the 2011–12 season, Bill Macdonald became the new television play-by-play announcer, joining Lantz who remained as the color analyst. Meanwhile, John Ireland joined Mychal Thompson to call the games on radio.[407] Beginning in the 2009–10 season, Lakers radio broadcasts were heard on KSPN (Los Angeles ESPN Radio affiliate) in English and KWKW in Spanish.[406][408] KLAC had the team's radio broadcast rights from the 1976–77 season until the 2008–09 season.[408][409] Until 2011, telecasts had been split between KCAL-TV (road games) and Fox Sports West (home games), unless they are chosen for national broadcasts on ABC.[410] KCAL had been the Lakers' over-the-air television broadcaster since 1977, dating back to when the station was the RKO General-owned KHJ-TV, the longest relationship between an NBA team and a television station. Prior to KHJ, Laker games were televised on KTLA. The Lakers had been on Fox Sports West since 1985, dating to when it was the original Prime Ticket and owned by Buss.[411] On February 14, 2011, Time Warner Cable and the Lakers announced the formation of two new regional sports networks (one in English, one in Spanish) that would exclusively televise the team's games and related programming for 20 years starting with the 2012–13 season.[412] The said networks were originally known as Time Warner Cable SportsNet, before it was renamed Spectrum SportsNet in 2016 upon Charter Communications' purchase of Time Warner Cable.[413]",

                "content": "The quarterback class from the 2024 NFL Draft was already one of the top stories of this season. And it keeps getting better. Jayden Daniels won on Sunday night, sending the Washington Commanders to the playoffs. And that usually would be enough that he wouldn’t have to share the spotlight. But the other rookie quarterback in the game, Michael Penix Jr. of the Atlanta Falcons, was also fantastic in rallying his team to overtime with a great game-tying drive in regulation. Daniels’ season will continue into the postseason. The Commanders clinched a playoff berth with the 30-24 overtime win. Washington won the coin toss to start OT and took the first drive into the end zone to end the game before Penix ever had a chance to get a possession. Daniels looked like a veteran in moving his team downfield in a pressure situation. On third-and-goal, Daniels hit Zach Ertz for a 2-yard touchdown for the walk-off win. The win also clinched the NFC West title for the Los Angeles Rams due to tiebreakers. The Falcons now need help to win the NFC South. Atlanta needs to beat the Carolina Panthers in Week 18 while the Tampa Bay Buccaneers need to lose to the New Orleans Saints to give the Falcons a division title. The silver lining for the Falcons in a loss that likely will cost them a shot at the division crown was that they should have a lot of excitement over their quarterback going forward. All five first-round rookie quarterbacks who have started games have had flashes of brilliance, or in Daniels’ case, a historic rookie season. The question for Falcons head coach Raheem Morris in the offseason might be why he didn’t pull the plug on Kirk Cousins and turn to Penix sooner. The first half wasn’t about either rookie quarterback. It was about Bijan Robinson and the Falcons' defense. Robinson had 82 rushing yards before halftime and two touchdowns. Meanwhile, the Falcons did a solid job of stopping Washington’s run game and limiting Daniels. The Commanders scored just once in the first half and trailed 17-7 at halftime. That changed quickly in the second half. Daniels started running more and the Commanders’ offense came alive. Washington scored quickly, on a Daniels touchdown pass to Ertz, and the Falcons’ lead was down to 17-14. The Commanders' offense stayed hot on its next drive, and Chris Rodriguez Jr. scored on a 2-yard touchdown run to give Washington the lead early in the fourth quarter. The Falcons' offense couldn’t get in any rhythm, and Daniels and the Commanders rarely let Atlanta have the ball. By the time the Commanders extended their lead to 24-17, the Commanders had run 39 second-half plays to just nine for Atlanta, and Washington had a 20:20 to 5:08 edge in time of possession. It looked like the Commanders had taken over the game and would escape with a win behind Daniels’ great second half. But Penix wasn’t backing down. The Falcons trailed 24-17 in a game they likely needed in the NFC South race, and that’s not a great spot for a rookie in his second career start. But Penix never looked like he was in just his second start. Penix was impressive in driving the Falcons downfield in the final minutes, including a big fourth-and-11 completion to Drake London for 31 yards. On first-and-goal a direct snap to Robinson was high and mishandled, and even though Robinson recovered, he was tackled at the 26-yard line, putting Atlanta in a ridiculous second-and-goal position. After that disaster, the rookie completed a 13-yard pass to London on second down and a 13-yard touchdown to Kyle Pitts on fourth down to tie it with 1:19 to go. Daniels was excellent in the second half, as he has been most of the season. But in that crucial drive, the Falcons learned a lot about their own rookie quarterback. After the score, Daniels threw a nice pass to Olamide Zaccheaus on third down but Zaccheaus dropped it and the Commanders punted, giving the ball right back to the Falcons with less than a minute to go. Penix rallied the team downfield and with two seconds left he escaped the rush and threw downfield, which led to a pass interference call on the Commanders. That gave the Falcons a shot at a field goal as time expired. But Riley Patterson’s 56-yard attempt was short and the game went to overtime. The Commanders got the ball first and Daniels continued to make plays. He had a great scramble for a first down on a crucial third-and-2. The drive kept moving inside the 10-yard line. The Commanders faced a third-and-goal from the 2-yard line, knowing a touchdown would clinch a playoff spot. Daniels hit Ertz for the touchdown, and Washington got its biggest win in years. Washington is heading to the playoffs. It seems like the rookie quarterback class of 2024 has plenty of postseason berths in its future.

Jayden Daniels was 24-of-36 for 227 yards and three touchdowns through the air, 16 carries for 127 yards on the ground and broke the NFL's rookie rushing yardage record. It was a brilliant night by Daniels,who's on his way to the playoffs and probably the NFL's Offensive Rookie of the Year award. Also, the L.A. Rams are in the playoffs with the Falcons' loss.

If the game should end in a tie, the Commanders (10-5-1 with a tie) would clinch a wild-card playoff berth and the Tampa Bay Buccaneers (9-7) would then go into the driver’s seat in the NFC South, just needing a Week 18 win to win the division over the Falconswho would enter Week 18 at 8-7-1, and need a Bucs loss to win the division. It would have been a career-best for Patterson, who is in for the injured Younghoe Koo, and the game heads to overtime. Twelve penalties for 103 yards for Washington tonight. Michael Davis gets flagged for the pass interference, after a neutral zone infraction foul moved the ball up five yards Atlanta could have used a timeout after a long completion with just under 30 seconds, but elected not to And now the Falcons will get the ball back with 40 seconds, deep in their own end with two timeouts, and a chance to win the game with a field goal.

The second half has still been a dominant blowout by the Commanders, who've had the ball for 39 plays over 20:20 for 191 yards against the Falcons. Atlanta has run nine second-half plays and gained 14 yards. Daniels passed former Washington quarterback — and fellow Heisman Trophy winner — Robert Griffin III, whose old record was 815 yards.

Now, with just over 10 minutes left in the fourth quarter — and Washington coming off back-to-back long drives — the Falcons' defense needs a big stop to stay in the game. After 14 plays, 70 yards over 7:03 of game clock, the Commanders take a 21-17 lead. Atlanta needs anything — a first down, a big play — something to get going.

                "content": "It took nearly a full overtime period but the Washington Commanders won 30-24 over the Atlanta Falcons on \"Sunday Night Football\" to reach 11 wins for the first time since 1991. Washington's offense went 70 yards in seven minutes and culminated in quarterback Jayden Daniels finding tight end Zach Ertz for the game-winning 2-yard touchdown pass. Daniels had a historic night, completing 24 of 36 passes for 227 yards, three touchdowns, and an interception. He also led the Commanders with 127 rushing yards on 16 carries. Daniels broke the rookie quarterback rushing yards record, previously held by former Washington quarterback Robert Griffin III, in the third quarter. Washington took control early by converting an interception by Falcons rookie quarterback Michael Penix Jr. to a touchdown. Atlanta scored 17 unanswered points by halftime, though, and a 10-point deficit was the biggest Washington's faced all season at the break. Atlanta running back Bijan Robinson scored two rushing touchdowns in the first half and finished the night with 17 carries for 90 yards and two scores. NFL STATS CENTRAL: The latest NFL scores, schedules, odds, stats and more. The Commanders came out strong in the second half with a 15-play drive that took up nearly eight minutes of time in the third quarter. Daniels found Ertz for his fifth touchdown of the season to cut the deficit to 17-14. Washington chewed another seven minutes of clock on their ensuing drive capped off by a go-ahead touchdown run by Chris Rodriguez. Their ensuing drive took 5:30 off the clock but finished off with a field goal. Atlanta fought back on their next drive as Penix Jr. threw his first NFL touchdown pass to tight end Kyle Pitts on 4th-and-goal and tie the game 24-24. A quick stop by the Falcons' defense gave the Penix Jr. and company the ball back with 40 seconds to go. They got into field goal range but Riley Patterson couldn't hit the 56-yard attempt. Penix Jr. completed 19 of 35 passes for 223 yards, one touchdown, and an interception in his second career start. Washington began overtime on offense and didn't let Atlanta's offense back on the field. Daniels repeatedly went to former Falcons wide receiver Olamide Zaccheaus on the night as Atlanta cornerback A.J. Terrell blanketed Terry McLaurin, his typical top target. Zaccheaus tied a career-high with eight catches for 85 yards and a touchdown, but had a critical drop on their final drive of regulation. Both teams had more success on the ground. Washington had 216 yards rushing and Atlanta tallied 126 by the final whistle. Washington overcame multiple miscues, including Daniels' interception and 108 yards in penalties, for their 11th win of the season. The Commanders (11-5) close out the regular season on the road next week against the Dallas Cowboys (7-9). This loss moves Atlanta (8-8) one game back from NFC South leader Tampa Bay (9-7). The Falcons head home for their regular season finale against the Carolina Panthers (4-12) and need the Buccaneers to lose to the New Orleans Saints to have a chance to win the division and make the playoffs. NFL PLAYOFF PICTURE: Where things stand in the AFC and NFC DO YOU LIKE FOOTBALL? Then you'll enjoy getting our NFL newsletter delivered to your inbox Jayden Daniels' 2-yard touchdown pass to tight end Zach Ertz gave the Commanders the win in overtime. More importantly, the win secured the Commanders' first playoff berth since the 2020 season. It also clinched a postseason spot for the Los Angeles Rams, who are NFC West winners due to a strength of victory tiebreaker over the Seattle Seahawks. Washington's gone 68 yards in more than seven minutes to take it deep into the red zone. Washington is facing third-and-goal from the 2-yard line with 2:45 to go in overtime. Washington won the coin toss and elected to receive the ball and start overtime on offense. Atlanta's Riley Patterson attempted a 56-yard field goal but it fell well short and \"Sunday Night Football\" is headed to overtime. A zero-yard sack and two incomplete passes meant the Commanders took just 39 seconds off the clock before punting back to the Falcons. Atlanta gets the ball back on its own 19-yard line with 40 seconds to go and two timeouts. After a 21-yard loss on first-and-goal on a botched snap, the Falcons were able to battle back and score on a Michael Penix Jr. pass to tight end Kyle Pitts on fourth-and-goal. The 13-yard touchdown pass is Penix Jr.'s first as an NFL quarterback and Riley Patterson's extra point is good to tie the game with 1:19 to go in the fourth quarter. Facing first-and-goal from the Washington 5-yard line, the Falcons tried a direct snap to running back Bijan Robinson but it went through his hands and back for a 21-yard loss. The Falcons will be facing second-and-goal from the Commanders' 26-yard line after the two-minute warning. Washington took more than five minutes to drive 52 yards for their third scoring drive of the second half. A holding call on third-and-goal nullified a touchdown pass from Jayden Daniels to Olamide Zaccheaus to keep the Falcons in contention and force a field goal. Zane Gonzalez knocked it through from 31 yards out to give Washington a seven-point lead with 4:32 to go. The rookie quarterback rushed for 7 yards on first-and-10 from the Falcons' 48-yard line in the fourth quarter, giving him 820 rushing yards on the season. That mark breaks the previous record of 815 yards held by fellow Washington quarterback Robert Griffin III set in the 2012 NFL season. Atlanta's offense picked up a first down to pass midfield but Commanders defensive lineman Dorance Armstrong sacked Michael Penix Jr. for an eight-yard loss on 3rd-and-10. The Falcons punt for the second time in a row in the second half and Washington's offense takes over from their own 36-yard line with 10:02 to go in the game. The Commanders took another seven minutes off the clock with a 14-play, 70-yard drive culminating in a 2-yard touchdown run by second-year running back Chris Rodriguez. Zane Gonzalez's extra point is good and Washington takes the lead again for the first time since the first quarter. Quarterback Jayden Daniels used his legs on the drive multiple times, scrambling for 39 yards and two first downs on the drive. He also found Jeremy McNichols for a key conversion on fourth-and-5 in Falcons territory. Washington's dominated time of possession in the third frame. The Commanders out-gained the Falcons 125 yards to minus-1 in the quarter. Washington's offense has the ball at the Falcons' 14-yard line facing second-and-5 to open the final quarter of the game. Atlanta managed just five yards before Washington defensive lineman Dante Fowler Jr. got a strip sack on third-and-5. Michael Penix Jr. recovered the ball, but the Falcons had to punt for just the second time all game. Washington's offense gets the ball back at its own 30-yard line with 5:06 to go in the third quarter. Washington's offense took nearly eight full minutes off the clock in their opening drive of the second half. Jayden Daniels fired a pass to tight end Zach Ertz on third-and-8 for a 10-yard touchdown. Zane Gonzalez's extra point is good as the Commanders make it a one-score game. Multiple key plays kept the drive going at crucial moments. An illegal contact penalty on the Falcons' defense on 3rd-and-22 kept Washington's offense on the field. Ertz had a 37-yard catch-and-run — his longest catch in three seasons — to get Washington past midfield. Daniels' 4-yard run on fourth-and-1 from the Falcons' 16-yard line gave the Commanders a new set of downs and closer to the end zone. Atlanta's field goal with two seconds to go sealed a two-score lead after the first half. After Washington's opening drive touchdown, the Falcons have clamped down on defense. The Commanders kicked two punts and threw and interception on their three drives after their first touchdown. Atlanta's pass rush has sacked Jayden Daniels twice and both quarterbacks have thrown one interception through the first two quarters. Washington will get the ball to start the third quarter. The Falcons went 51 yards in less than two minutes to make it a two-score game behind a 39-yard field goal by Liam McCullough. Michael Penix Jr. completed 3 of 5 passes for 32 yards on the drive. A holding penalty and 10-yard sack on consecutive plays forced the Washington offense into a third-and-30 from their own 35-yard line. The Commanders couldn't overcome that and will settle for a punt on the other side of the two-minute warning. Atlanta will have a chance to score before halftime with all three timeouts. Atlanta's offense capitalized on the interception by marching 72 yards in 11 plays for a go-ahead touchdown. Bijan Robinson's second-and-2 run from the Commanders' 4-yard line was initially ruled a touchdown run but was called back due to the ball going out of bounds before crossing the plane of the end zone. Two plays later, he made good on that miss with a 1-yard score. The Falcons ran the ball eight times on the drive for 49 yards. After a holding penalty backed the Commanders out of the red zone, Jayden Daniels dropped back and threw an interception to Falcons linebacker Kaden Elliss. Elliss had a short return to give the ball back to the Falcons offense at their own 29-yard line with 10:37 to go in the second quarter. Facing third-and-6 from their own 33-yard line, Falcons quarterback Michael Penix Jr. dropped back and threw deep for running back Bijan Robinson, who had a step on his defender. The pass fell incomplete and the Falcons were forced to punt. Washington takes over at its own 28-yard line with less than a minute to go in the first quarter. Falcons rookie linebacker JD Bertrand got to Jayden Daniels for a 13-yard sack on second-and-10 and Washington's offense couldn't recover. The Commanders punted for the first time tonight and the Falcons will take over at their own 27-yard line with 2:48 to go in the first quarter. Two key penalties against the Commanders kept the Falcons alive for a 10-play, 70-yard drive capped off by a rushing touchdown by Bijan Robinson off a direct snap. Liam McCullough's extra point is good and the game is tied with 5:10 to go in the first quarter. The Falcons were lined up for a field goal on fourth-and-4 from the Washington 28-yard line. But rookie cornerback Mike Sainristil was lined up offsides and a 5-yard penalty gives Atlanta another shot near the red zone. Following the turnover, the Commanders made the most of a short field with a seven-play touchdown drive in a matter of three minutes. Rookie quarterback Jayden Daniels faked a handoff and rolled out to his left before finding Olamide Zaccheaus for a 7-yard touchdown on fourth-and-2. Zane Gonzalez's extra point is good and Washington takes the first lead of the game with 9:33 to go in the first quarter. The rookie dropped back for his third pass of the game and threw it to Commanders safety Quan Martin. Washington's offense takes over at the Falcons' 38-yard line with 12:45 to go in the first quarter. Rookie quarterback Michael Penix Jr. will have the first drive of the game in his second start of the season.

                "content": "If not listed, please contact your TV provider. The Washington Commanders are back in the playoffs. Despite an inspired performance by Falcons rookie quarterback Michael Penix Jr., Washington prevailed in overtime after their rookie quarterback, Jayden Daniels, hit tight end Zach Ertz for the game-winning score in the extra session. Washington (11-5) has clinched its first playoff berth since 2020 with Sunday night's 30-24 win. The Commanders also clinched a playoff berth for the Los Angeles Rams. Conversely, Atlanta (8-8) lost control of its own playoff destiny. The Commanders scored 17 unanswered points after trailing 17-7 at halftime, but Atlanta forced overtime after Penix hit Kyle Pitts on a 13-yard touchdown pass with 1:19 left in regulation. The Falcons could have won it in regulation, but Riley Patterson's 56-yard field goal try at the buzzer was short. In overtime, Daniels led the Commanders on a 12-play, 70-yard drive that was punctuated by his third touchdown pass of the night. Daniels also led both teams with 127 yards on 16 carries. Penix threw for 223 yards with a touchdown and a pick in a losing effort. Here's a closer look at how Washington punched its playoff ticket. Without taking anything away from Atlanta, Washington's win was largely the result of Dan Quinn's team not getting in its own way as much in the second half and in overtime after committing several costly errors in the first half. One of those mistakes was a special teams penalty on a Falcons punt that extended the drive and ultimately led to a touchdown for the visiting team. The Commanders were flagged a whopping 13 times for 108 yards, but Daniels largely overcame the sloppy play with breathtaking plays. Daniels' night also included some history; he broke former Washington quarterback Robert Griffin III's rookie record for rushing yards by a quarterback. With A.J. Terrell following Terry McLaurin's every move, Commanders wideout Olamide Zaccheaus stepped up with eight grabs for 85 yards that included his 7-yard touchdown catch on Washington's first drive. Defensively, the Commanders set up the game's first score after picking off Penix on the game's fifth play. In the second half, Washington was able to get Atlanta's offense off the field on its first two possessions. The Falcons had run just nine plays prior to their game-tying touchdown drive in the final moments of regulation. The Falcons sacked Daniels five times, but they weren't able to bring him down when it mattered most. They also were unable to come up with a fourth-down stop, as the Commanders converted on all three of their fourth-down tries. While the loss surely hurts, Falcons fans should take solace in Penix's performance. After a shaky opening drive, Penix quickly found his rhythm, leading the Falcons on three scoring drives in the first half. Two of those drives ended with touchdowns by running back Bijan Robinson, who rushed or 82 yards on 13 carries in the game's first 30 minutes. Penix then led an improbable, game-tying drive near the end of regulation that included a 31-yard completion to Drake London (who caught seven passes for 106 yards) on a fourth-and-11 play. His touchdown pass to Pitts was on a fourth-and-13 play. Speaking of Robinson, his lack of involvement in the second half loomed large in the loss. He had just eight yards on four carries in the second half after being an integral part of the Falcons' success in the first half. One of Washington's most important plays of the night took place on a fourth-and-5 on the Falcons' 39-yard line late in the third quarter. On the play, Daniels threw a short pass to running back Jeremy McNichols, who was initially short of the first-down market before fighting for the necessary yardage. The 6-yard gain helped set up the Commanders' go-ahead touchdown at the start of the fourth quarter. Daniels' game-winning touchdown pass was a dart that corralled by Ertz, who caught six passes for 72 yards and two scores. \"I like our teams' chances against anyone.\" -- Daniels with NBC Sports afterward when asked about Washington's playoff prospects Atlanta will play host to the Panthers in their regular-season finale. The Falcons need to win and have the Buccaneers lose to the Saints in order to capture the NFC South division title and the playoff berth that comes with it. The Commanders will wrap up the regular season in Dallas against the rival Cowboys. Washington clinches the playoff spot and right now is the No. 6 seed ahead of the Packers due to the conference record tiebreaker. That'll be settled next week. Atlanta now needs the Buccaneers to lose next week in order to win the NFC South. For the second week in a row, Jayden Daniels leads a game-winning, walk-off drive. This time, he sends the Commanders to the playoffs with a strike to Zach Ertz over the middle of the field. That drive was basically all Daniels the whole way. What a performance: 24 of 36 for 227 yards, 3 touchdowns and 1 interception, plus 16 (SIXTEEN) carries for 127 yards. WOW. Daniels' escapability is just unreal. Riley Patterson's 56-yard field goal came up way short, so the Davis penalty escapes ignominy. We're headed to an extra period. This penalty on Michael Davis being pass interference rather than holding may have just won Atlanta the game. Wow. Noah Igbinoghene may have gotten away with illegal contact on that last throw to Drake London. Their feet got tangled so it wasn't pass interference, but Igbinoghene had hands on London farther than 5 yards downfield. EXTREMELY suspect time management from the Falcons. Wow. They let the clock run all the way down to 12 seconds when they still had an extra timeout. Wow. Might have just cost themselves a chance to win the game. AJ Terrell got away with a pretty obvious pass interference on second down and Olamide Zaccheus had a ball hit him in the facemask on third, and now the Falcons will have 40 seconds to drive for the game-winning score, with two timeouts still in their pocket. And Penix comes back on the very next snap and makes up for it with his best throw of the night. Fantastic job by Kyle Pitts to make the contested catch over the middle. Extra point tied it up. What a drive. Yikes. Second time Penix has missed an open corner route for a touchdown. Absolutely massive loss for the Falcons on a bad snap on first-and-goal results in a 21-yard loss. It'll be second-and-goal from the 26-yard line after the two-minute warning. Atlanta tried to go with the direct snap to Bijan again and it backfired in a big way. Penix has made two really nice throws to the wide left side of the field to extend this drive. Falcons still have a shot to tie. Washington tacked on a field goal after the Cosmi penalty, and now leads by 7. The Falcons have 4:32 to drive the field for a game-tying touchdown, armed with two timeouts. Oh boy, that could be a huge penalty. Holding on Sam Cosmi wipes a Zaccheus TD off the board and now it'll be third-and-goal from the 13 with Washington up by 4 points. Daniels just broke the record for rushing yards by a rookie quarterback. It was, of course, previously held by Robert Griffin III for this same Washington franchise. Second time tonight that Penix has gotten stripped but the Falcons have recovered the fumble. He's got to have better ball security in the pocket, especially when he's trying to step up and through the rush. What a move by Ray-Ray McCloud! Stayed on his feet through a pair of tacklers on third down and created a whole bunch of yards after the catch by himself. Moved the Falcons into plus territory as they try to take the lead here. Another fantastic drive from Washington culminates with a trip to the end zone. This time it's Chris Rodriguez scoring on a pitch play from 2 yards out to cap a 14-play, 70-yard drive that again took more than 7 minutes off the clock. Really nice coverage from A.J. Terrell on a third-down deep shot to Terry McLaurin forced Washington into fourth-and-5. Naturally, Daniels converted it again, this time with a checkdown over the middle to Jeremy McNichols. He was nearly stood up just before the line to gain but appeared to reach out and convert it at the last second. Atlanta got away with one on third down, as Penix got stripped of the ball but fell on it himself before a defender could recover the fumble. Washington will get it back with a chance to tie or take the lead. Big drive for Zach Ertz. He had the huge gain earlier and now he steps up on third-and-long inside the red zone and makes a great contested grab in the front of the end zone to get Washington back within one score. 15 plays, 79 yards and a touchdown in a drive that took more than half the third quarter. Second fourth-down conversion of the night for Washington. Now 18 of 21 on the year. Zach Ertz has basically been a catch-and-fall guy for years now, He just had a MASSIVE catch and run for a huge gain on a scramble-drill play after Daniels evaded pressure in the pocket. Washington's offensive line is getting totally bowled over here. Just got bailed out by an illegal contact penalty. Some really, really bad clock management from Atlanta on this final drive, and then Penix airmailed an open corner route on third down, so the Falcons settled for a Riley Patterson field goal to take a 10-point lead into the break. Washington gets the ball to begin the third quarter. It looked like the second score of the night for Bijan Robinson, but apparently the ball was behind him as he went through the front corner of the end zone, so they took the score off the board. Michael Penix then got stopped on a QB sneak from inside the 1-yard line. Falcons still trying to punch it in. And then Bijan took it into the end zone anyway, bouncing it outside the tackle box and easily jumping into the end zone to give the Falcons their first lead of the night. Really undisciplined performance from the Washington defense so far. Already three penalties to extend drives. After a penalty set Washington's drive back inside the red zone, Kaden Elliss came up with a huge play to shut down the scoring opportunity. Looks like Daniels got fooled by the coverage and never saw Elliss dropping into his zone, and just threw the ball right into the defender's chest. Former Falcons WR Olamide Zaccheus has 5-53-1 against his former team less than 5 minutes into the second quarter. One of the best games of his career already. That looked like the third miscommunication of the game for the Falcons already. The snap operation isn't on the same page, and neither are the receivers. © 2004-2024 CBS Interactive.

It is sometimes called the \"stomach flu\" or the \"stomach bug.\" However, norovirus illness is not related to the flu. The flu is caused by the influenza virus. Norovirus causes acute gastroenteritis, an inflammation of the stomach or intestines. Most people with norovirus illness get better within 1 to 3 days; but they can still spread the virus for a few days after. You can get norovirus illness many times in your life because there are many different types of noroviruses. Infection with one type of norovirus may not protect you against other types. It is possible to develop protection against specific types. But it is not known exactly how long protection lasts. This may explain why so many people of all ages get infected during norovirus outbreaks. A person usually develops symptoms 12 to 48 hours after being exposed to norovirus. If you have norovirus illness, you can feel extremely ill, and vomit or have diarrhea many times a day. This can lead to dehydration (loss of body fluids), especially in young children, older adults, and people with other illnesses. Symptoms of dehydration include: Anyone can get infected and sick with norovirus and people of all ages get infected during norovirus outbreaks. Your likelihood of getting a norovirus infection is also determined in part by your genes. If eaten raw, oysters and other filter-feeding shellfish can contain viruses and bacteria that can cause illness or death. Anyone who consumes raw shellfish is at risk of contracting norovirus. Children younger than 5 years old, older adults, and people with weakened immune systems are more likely to develop severe infections. Norovirus spreads very easily and quickly in different ways. You can get norovirus by: You can still spread norovirus for 2 weeks or more after you feel better. Norovirus is very contagious, but you can take steps to protect yourself and others, including: Diagnostic methods for norovirus focus on detecting viral RNA (genetic material) or viral antigen. Diagnostic tests are available at all public health laboratories and many clinical laboratories. Most people with norovirus illness get better within 1 to 3 days. There is no specific medicine to treat people with norovirus illness. Antibiotic drugs will not help treat norovirus infections because they fight bacteria, not viruses. Watch for signs of dehydration (loss of body fluids) in children who have norovirus illness. Children who are dehydrated may cry with few or no tears and be unusually sleepy or fussy. If you have norovirus illness, you should drink plenty of liquids to replace fluid lost from vomiting and diarrhea. This will help prevent dehydration. Sports drinks and other drinks without caffeine or alcohol can help with mild dehydration. However, these drinks may not replace important nutrients and minerals. Oral rehydration fluids that you can get over the counter are most helpful for mild dehydration. Dehydration can lead to serious problems. Severe dehydration may require hospitalization for treatment with fluids given through your vein (intravenous or IV fluids). If you think you or someone you are caring for is severely dehydrated, call your doctor. Norovirus is the leading cause of vomiting and diarrhea, and foodborne illness in the United States. Always wash your hands and handle food well. Languages Language Assistance",

They commonly spread through food or water that is contaminated during preparation or through contaminated surfaces. Noroviruses can also spread through close contact with a person who has norovirus infection. Diarrhea, stomach pain and vomiting typically begin 12 to 48 hours after exposure. Norovirus infection symptoms usually last 1 to 3 days. Most people recover completely without treatment. However, for some people — especially young children, older adults and people with other medical conditions — vomiting and diarrhea can be severely dehydrating and require medical attention. Norovirus infection occurs most frequently in closed and crowded environments. Examples include hospitals, nursing homes, child care centers, schools and cruise ships. Signs and symptoms of norovirus infection may start suddenly and include: Signs and symptoms usually begin 12 to 48 hours after your first exposure to a norovirus and last 1 to 3 days. You can continue to shed virus in your stool for several weeks after recovery. This shedding can last weeks to months if you have another medical condition. Some people with norovirus infection may show no signs or symptoms. However, they're still contagious and can spread the virus to others. Seek medical attention if you develop diarrhea that doesn't go away within several days. Also call your health care provider if you experience severe vomiting, bloody stools, stomach pain or dehydration. Noroviruses are highly contagious. That means the norovirus infection can easily spread to others. The virus is shed in stool and vomit. You can spread the virus from the time you first have symptoms of illness until several days after you recover. Noroviruses can stay on surfaces and objects for days or weeks. You can get norovirus infection by: Noroviruses are difficult to kill because they can withstand hot and cold temperatures and many disinfectants. Risk factors for becoming infected with a norovirus include: For most people, norovirus infection usually clears up within a few days and isn't life-threatening. But in some people — especially young children; older adults; and people with weakened immune systems or other medical conditions or who are pregnant — norovirus infection can be severe.

                "content": "Norovirus, also known as Norwalk virus and sometimes referred to as the winter vomiting disease, is the most common cause of gastroenteritis.[1][6] Infection is characterized by non-bloody diarrhea, vomiting, and stomach pain.[2][3] Fever or headaches may also occur.[2] Symptoms usually develop 12 to 48 hours after being exposed, and recovery typically occurs within one to three days.[2] Complications are uncommon, but may include dehydration, especially in the young, the old, and those with other health problems.[2] The virus is usually spread by the fecal–oral route.[3] This may be through contaminated food or water or person-to-person contact.[3] It may also spread via contaminated surfaces or through air from the vomit of an infected person.[3] Risk factors include unsanitary food preparation and sharing close quarters.[3] Diagnosis is generally based on symptoms.[3] Confirmatory testing is not usually available but may be performed by public health agencies during outbreaks.[3] Prevention involves proper hand washing and disinfection of contaminated surfaces.[4] There is no vaccine or specific treatment for norovirus.[4][5] Management involves supportive care such as drinking sufficient fluids or intravenous fluids.[5] Oral rehydration solutions are the preferred fluids to drink, although other drinks without caffeine or alcohol can help.[5] Alcohol-based hand sanitizers are not effective against the norovirus, according to the NHS information page on the subject;[8] this is due to norovirus being a non-enveloped virus. Norovirus results in about 685 million cases of disease and 200,000 deaths globally a year.[6][7] It is common both in the developed and developing world.[3][9] Those under the age of five are most often affected, and in this group it results in about 50,000 deaths in the developing world.[6] Norovirus infections occur more commonly during winter months.[6] It often occurs in outbreaks, especially among those living in close quarters.[3] In the United States, it is the cause of about half of all foodborne disease outbreaks.[3] The virus is named after the city of Norwalk, Ohio, US, where an outbreak occurred in 1968.[10] Norovirus infection is characterized by nausea, vomiting, watery diarrhea, abdominal pain, and in some cases, loss of taste. A person usually develops symptoms of gastroenteritis 12 to 48 hours after being exposed to norovirus.[11] General lethargy, weakness, muscle aches, headaches, and low-grade fevers may occur. The disease is usually self-limiting, and severe illness is rare. Although having norovirus can be unpleasant, it is not usually dangerous, and most who contract it make a full recovery within two to three days.[1] Norovirus can establish a long-term infection in people who are immunocompromised, such as those with common variable immunodeficiency or with a suppressed immune system after organ transplantation.[12] These infections can be with or without symptoms.[12] In severe cases, persistent infections can lead to norovirus‐associated enteropathy, intestinal villous atrophy, and malabsorption.[12] Noroviruses are transmitted directly from person to person (62–84% of all reported outbreaks)[13] and indirectly via contaminated water and food. Transmission can be aerosolized when those stricken with the illness vomit or by a toilet flush when vomit or diarrhea is present; infection can follow eating food or breathing air near an episode of vomiting, even if cleaned up.[14] The viruses continue to be shed after symptoms have subsided, and shedding can still be detected many weeks after infection.[15] Vomiting, in particular, transmits infection effectively and appears to allow airborne transmission. In one incident, a person who vomited spread the infection across a restaurant, suggesting that many unexplained cases of food poisoning may have their source in vomit.[16] In December 1998, 126 people were dining at six tables; one person vomited onto the floor. Staff quickly cleaned up, and people continued eating. Three days later others started falling ill; 52 people reported a range of symptoms, from fever and nausea to vomiting and diarrhea. The cause was not immediately identified. Researchers plotted the seating arrangement: more than 90% of the people at the same table as the sick person later reported becoming ill. There was a direct correlation between the risk of infection of people at other tables and how close they were to the sick person. More than 70% of the diners at an adjacent table fell ill; at a table on the other side of the restaurant, the infection rate was still 25%. The outbreak was attributed to a Norwalk-like virus (norovirus). Other cases of transmission by vomit were later identified.[17] In one outbreak at an international scout jamboree in the Netherlands, each person with gastroenteritis infected an average of 14 people before increased hygiene measures were put in place. Even after these new measures were enacted, an ill person still infected an average of 2.1 other people.[18] A US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) study of 11 outbreaks in New York State lists the suspected mode of transmission as person-to-person in seven outbreaks, foodborne in two, waterborne in one, and one unknown. The source of waterborne outbreaks may include water from municipal supplies, wells, recreational lakes, swimming pools, and ice machines.[19] Shellfish and salad ingredients are the foods most often implicated in norovirus outbreaks. Ingestion of shellfish that has not been sufficiently heated – under 75 °C (167 °F) – poses a high risk for norovirus infection.[20][21] Foods other than shellfish may be contaminated by infected food handlers.[22] Many norovirus outbreaks have been traced to food that was handled by only one infected person.[23] Between March and August 2017, in Quebec, Canada, there was an outbreak of norovirus that sickened more than 700 people. According to an investigation by Canada's CFIA Food Control Agency, the culprit was frozen raspberries imported from Harbin Gaotai Food Co Ltd, a Chinese supplier, and then Canadian authorities issued a recall on raspberries products from Harbin Gaotai.[24] According to the CDC, there was a surge in norovirus cases on thirteen cruise ships in 2023, which marks the highest number of outbreaks since 2012.[25] Noroviruses (NoV) are a genetically diverse group of single-stranded positive-sense RNA, non-enveloped viruses belonging to the family Caliciviridae.[26][27] According to the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses, the genus Norovirus has one species, which is called Norwalk virus.[26] Noroviruses can genetically be classified into at least seven different genogroups (GI, GII, GIII, GIV, GV, GVI, and GVII), which can be further divided into other genetic clusters or genotypes.[28] Noroviruses commonly isolated in cases of acute gastroenteritis belong to two genogroups: genogroup I (GI) includes Norwalk virus, Desert Shield virus, and Southampton virus; and II (GII), which includes Bristol virus, Lordsdale virus, Toronto virus, Mexico virus, Hawaii virus and Snow Mountain virus.[27] Most noroviruses that infect humans belong to genogroups GI and GII.[29] Noroviruses from genogroup II, genotype 4 (abbreviated as GII.4) account for the majority of adult outbreaks of gastroenteritis and often sweep across the globe.[30] Recent examples include US95/96-US strain, associated with global outbreaks in the mid- to late-1990s; Farmington Hills virus associated with outbreaks in Europe and the United States in 2002 and in 2004; and Hunter virus which was associated with outbreaks in Europe, Japan, and Australasia. In 2006, there was another large increase in NoV infection around the globe.[31] Reports have shown a link between the expression of human histo-blood group antigens (HBGAs) and the susceptibility to norovirus infection. Studies have suggested the capsid of noroviruses may have evolved from selective pressure of human HBGAs.[32] HBGAs are not, however, the receptor or facilitator of norovirus infection. Co-factors such as bile salts may facilitate the infection, making it more intense when introduced during or after the initial infection of the host tissue.[33] Bile salts are produced by the liver in response to eating fatty foods, and they help with the absorption of consumed lipids. It is not yet clear at what specific point in the Norovirus replication cycle bile salts facilitate infection: penetration, uncoating, or maintaining capsid stability.[33] The protein MDA-5 may be the primary immune sensor that detects the presence of noroviruses in the body.[34] Some people have common variations of the MDA-5 gene that could make them more susceptible to norovirus infection.[35] Viruses in Norovirus are non-enveloped, with icosahedral geometries. Capsid diameters vary widely, from 23 to 40 nm in diameter. The larger capsids (38–40 nm) exhibit T=3 symmetry and are composed of 180 VP1 proteins. Small capsids (23 nm) show T=1 symmetry, and are composed of 60 VP1 proteins.[36] The virus particles demonstrate an amorphous surface structure when visualized using electron microscopy.[37] Noroviruses contain a linear, non-segmented,[36] positive-sense RNA genome of approximately 7.5 kilobases, encoding a large polyprotein which is cleaved into six smaller non-structural proteins (NS1/2 to NS7)[38] by the viral 3C-like protease (NS6), a major structural protein (VP1) of about 58~60 kDa and a minor capsid protein (VP2).[39] The most variable region of the viral capsid is the P2 domain, which contains antigen-presenting sites and carbohydrate-receptor binding regions.[40][41][42][43][44] Groups 1, 2, 3, and 4 last shared a common ancestor in AD 867.[45] The group 2 and group 4 viruses last shared a common ancestor in approximately AD 1443 (95% highest posterior density AD 1336–1542).[46] Several estimates of the evolution rate have been made varying from 8.98 × 10−3 to 2.03 × 10−3 substitutions per site per year.[citation needed] The estimated mutation rate (1.21×10−2 to 1.41 ×10−2 substitutions per site per year) in this virus is high even compared with other RNA viruses.[47] In addition, a recombination hotspot exists at the ORF1-ORF2 (VP1) junction.[48] Viral replication is cytoplasmic. Entry into the host cell is achieved by attachment to host receptors, which mediates endocytosis. Positive-stranded RNA virus transcription is the method of replication. Translation takes place by leaky scanning and RNA termination-reinitiation. Humans and other mammals serve as the natural host. Transmission routes are fecal-oral and contamination.[36] When a person becomes infected with norovirus, the virus replicates within the small intestine. The principal symptom is acute gastroenteritis, characterized by nausea, forceful vomiting, watery diarrhea, and abdominal pain, that develops between 12 and 48 hours after exposure and lasts for 24–72 hours.[49] Sometimes there is loss of taste, general lethargy, weakness, muscle aches, headache, cough, and/or low-grade fever. The disease is usually self-limiting.[citation needed] Severe illness is rare; although people are frequently treated at the emergency ward, they are rarely admitted to the hospital. The number of deaths from norovirus in the United States is estimated to be around 570–800[50] each year, with most of these occurring in the very young, the elderly, and persons with weakened immune systems. Symptoms may become life-threatening in these groups if dehydration or electrolyte imbalance is ignored or left untreated.[51] Specific diagnosis of norovirus is routinely made by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assays or quantitative PCR assays, which give results within a few hours. These assays are very sensitive and can detect as few as 10 virus particles.[52] Tests such as ELISA that use antibodies against a mixture of norovirus strains are available commercially, but lack specificity and sensitivity.[53] After infection, immunity to the same strain of the virus – the genotype – protects against reinfection for between six months to two years.[54] This immunity does not fully protect against infection with the other diverse genotypes of the virus.[54] In Canada, norovirus is a notifiable disease.[55] In both the US and the UK it is not notifiable.[56][57] Hand washing with soap and water is an effective method for reducing the transmission of norovirus pathogens. Alcohol rubs (≥62% isopropyl alcohol) may be used as an adjunct, but are less effective than hand-washing, as norovirus lacks a lipid viral envelope.[58] Surfaces where norovirus particles may be present can be sanitised with a solution of 1.5% to 7.5% of household bleach in water, or other disinfectants effective against norovirus.[49][59][60] In healthcare environments, the prevention of nosocomial infections involves routine and terminal cleaning. Nonflammable alcohol vapor in CO2 systems is used in health care environments where medical electronics would be adversely affected by aerosolized chlorine or other caustic compounds.[61] In 2011, the CDC published a clinical practice guideline addressing strategies for the prevention and control of norovirus gastroenteritis outbreaks in healthcare settings.[62][63] Based on a systematic review of published scientific studies, the guideline presents 51 specific evidence-based recommendations, which were organized into 12 categories: 1) patient cohorting and isolation precautions, 2) hand hygiene, 3) patient transfer and ward closure, 4) food handlers in healthcare, 5) diagnostics, 6) personal protective equipment, 7) environmental cleaning, 8) staff leave and policy, 9) visitors, 10) education, 11) active case-finding, and 12) communication and notification. The guideline also identifies eight high-priority recommendations and suggests several areas in need of future research.[citation needed] LigoCyte announced in 2007 that it was working on a vaccine and had started phase 1 trials.[64] The company has since been taken over by Takeda Pharmaceutical Company.[65] As of 2019[update], a bivalent (NoV GI.1/GII.4) intramuscular vaccine had completed phase 1 trials.[66][67] In 2020 the phase 2b trials were finished.[68][69] The vaccine relies on using a virus-like particle that is made of the norovirus capsid proteins in order to mimic the external structure of the virus. Since there is no RNA in this particle, it is incapable of reproducing and cannot cause an infection.[64] The norovirus can survive for long periods outside a human host depending on the surface and temperature conditions: it can survive for weeks on hard and soft surfaces,[70] and it can survive for months, maybe even years in contaminated still water.[71] A 2006 study found the virus remained on surfaces used for food preparation seven days after contamination.[72] Routine protocols to detect norovirus in clams and oysters by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction are being employed by governmental laboratories such as the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in the US.[73] There is no specific medicine to treat people with norovirus illness. Norovirus infection cannot be treated with antibiotics because it is a virus. Treatments aim to avoid complications by measures such as the management of dehydration caused by fluid loss in vomiting and diarrhea,[5] and to mitigate symptoms using antiemetics and antidiarrheals.[74] Norovirus causes about 18% of all cases of acute gastroenteritis worldwide. It is relatively common in developed countries and in low-mortality developing countries (20% and 19% respectively) compared to high-mortality developing countries (14%). Proportionately it causes more illness in people in the community or in hospital outpatients (24% and 20% respectively) as compared with hospital inpatients (17%) in whom other causes are more common.[76] Age and emergence of new norovirus strains do not appear to affect the proportion of gastroenteritis attributable to norovirus.[76] In the United States, the estimated annual number of norovirus cases in 2023[update] was 21 million,[77] representing a rate of 6,270 cases per 100,000 individuals. Norovirus is a common cause of epidemics of gastroenteritis on cruise ships. The CDC, through its Vessel Sanitation Program, records and investigates outbreaks of gastrointestinal illness – mostly caused by norovirus – on cruise ships with both a US and foreign itinerary;[78] there were 12 in 2015, and 10 from 1 January to 9 May 2016. An outbreak may affect over 25% of passengers, and a smaller proportion of crew members.[79] Epidemiological studies have shown that individuals with different ABO(H) (histo-blood group) phenotypes are infected with NoV strains in a genotype-specific manner.[80][81] GII.4 includes global epidemic strains and binds to more histo-blood group antigens than other genogroups.[80] FUT2 fucosyltransferase transfers a fucose sugar to the end of the ABO(H) precursor in gastrointestinal cells and saliva glands. The ABH-antigen produced is thought to act as a receptor for human norovirus: A non-functional fucosyltransferase FUT2 provides high protection from the most common norovirus strain, GII.4.[82] Homozygous carriers of any nonsense mutation in the FUT2 gene are called non-secretors, as no ABH-antigen is produced. Approximately 20% of Caucasians are non-secretors due to G428A and C571T nonsense mutations in FUT2 and therefore have strong – although not absolute – protection from the norovirus GII.4.[83] Non-secretors can still produce ABH antigens in erythrocytes, as the precursor is formed by FUT1.[80] Some norovirus genotypes (GI.3) can infect non-secretors.[84] The norovirus was originally named the \"Norwalk agent\" after Norwalk, Ohio, in the United States, where an outbreak of acute gastroenteritis occurred among children at Bronson Elementary School in November 1968. In 1972, electron microscopy on stored human stool samples identified a virus, which was given the name \"Norwalk virus\". Numerous outbreaks with similar symptoms have been reported since. The cloning and sequencing of the Norwalk virus genome showed that these viruses have a genomic organization consistent with viruses belonging to the family Caliciviridae.[85] The name \"norovirus\" (Norovirus for the genus) was approved by the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV) in 2002.[86] In 2011, however, a press release and a newsletter were published by ICTV, which strongly encouraged the media, national health authorities, and the scientific community to use the virus name Norwalk virus, rather than the genus name Norovirus when referring to outbreaks of the disease. This was also a public response by ICTV to the request from an individual in Japan to rename the Norovirus genus because of the possibility of negative associations for people in Japan and elsewhere who have the family name \"Noro\". Before this position of ICTV was made public, ICTV consulted widely with members of the Caliciviridae Study Group and carefully discussed the case.[87] In addition to \"Norwalk agent\" and \"Norwalk virus\", the virus has also been called \"Norwalk-like virus\", \"small, round-structured viruses\" (SRSVs), Spencer flu, and \"Snow Mountain virus\".[88] Common names of the illness caused by noroviruses still in use include \"Roskilde illness\", \"winter vomiting disease\",[89] \"winter vomiting bug\",[90][91] \"viral gastroenteritis\", and \"acute nonbacterial gastroenteritis\".[51]",

Coaching decisions and roster turnover await, but the most highly anticipated event of the offseason is the NFL Draft. The Giants entered Week 17 with a 2-13 record and in sole possession of the first pick. Five teams behind them were all tied at 3-12, meaning that a late-season win could, ironically, tank New York's draft pick. The Giants clearly didn't have the draft on their minds in Week 17. New York played its best game of the season and knocked the Colts out of playoff contention. The Giants got off their 10-game losing streak to move to 3-13. New York initially fell to No. 3, but with the Browns losing to the Dolphins, it now moves to No. 4. The Patriots, Jaguars, Titans, Browns, and Raiders all had eyes on the Giants game. Unfortunately for Jacksonville and Tennessee, they played each other. The Jaguars ended up winning 20-13 — good news for the Titans, as they now improve their draft standing while the Jags fall a few spots. New England lost earlier in the weekend, but it has the strength-of-schedule tiebreaker over New York. The Patriots move into the No. 1 spot, with the Titans at No. 2 and the Giants at No. 3. The top five currently is rounded out with the Browns at No. 4 and the Jaguars at No. 5. Las Vegas' head coach Antonio Pierce was adamant last week the Raiders weren't thinking about draft positioning. They proved this with a win over the Saints in Week 17. Las Vegas was looking at a top-six draft pick but has fallen to No. 8 after beating New Orleans. Cleveland faced Miami with no Tua Tagovailoa or Jaylen Waddle. The Browns had a great chance to end the Dolphins' season but didn't go the route the Giants did. They put forth a horrible effort and lost 20-3. Cleveland's loss made them the No. 3 seed, and New York slid a little further down to No. 4 because of the strength-of-schedule tiebreaker. Here's an updated look at the 2025 NFL Draft order after the Sunday afternoon slate in Week 17. NFL HQ: Live NFL scores | Updated NFL standings | Full NFL schedule NFL DRAFT NEWS: Here's a look at the top 10 NFL Draft prospects, based on our own Vinnie Iyer's latest 2025 big board: This is not a mock draft, but more of a best player available ranking. Hunter has yet to decide what position he will play at the next level, but the Heisman winner is likely to find success whether he plays offense or defense. The top of the draft is expected to be where Sanders and Ward end up being drafted, but with a week of games to go, there is still plenty of draft pick movement that can happen. Graham and Johnson were staples of the Wolverines defense, despite a down year as a program. McMillan finished the season with 1,319 yards and eight touchdowns on 84 receptions. He is going to be a player to watch at the NFL Combine as he shows off his speed while being 6-5. Carter is the latest Nittany Lion to don the No. 11 jersey on defense. It is a rite of passage with the program, and he looks to follow in the footsteps of Micah Parsons. Jeanty should be the first running back taken and showed this season that he is worthy of a first-round pick. Teddy Ricketson is a Digital Content Producer at The Sporting News. He joined the team in 2024 after spending the last three years writing for Vox Media as part of its DK Nation/Network team.

Saturday's 40-7 loss to the Los Angeles Chargers brought the Patriots' 2024 record to 3-13. They owned the No. 2 pick heading into Sunday's slate of games, but vaulted up to No. 1 after the New York Giants beat the Indianapolis Colts to improve to 3-13. The Jacksonville Jaguars and Las Vegas Raiders both moved to 4-12 with wins Sunday, meaning there are only four three-win teams -- the Patriots, Tennessee Titans, Giants and Cleveland Browns, who are each 3-13 after losing in Week 17. The Patriots own the strength of schedule tiebreaker over all three of those teams thanks to a weaker strength of schedule. Here's the updated order for the top 10 picks in the first round of the 2025 NFL Draft: !function(){\"use strict\";window.addEventListener(\"message\",(function(a){if(void 0!==a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"]){var e=document.querySelectorAll(\"iframe\");for(var t in a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"])for(var r=0;r<e.length;r++)if(e[r].contentWindow===a.source){var i=a.data[\"datawrapper-height\"][t]+\"px\";e[r].style.height=i}}}))}(); The Patriots wrap up their 2024 campaign next Sunday at home against the Buffalo Bills. Another loss would guarantee them the No. 1 pick, while a win would drop them to no lower than fourth.",

On offense, QB Josh Allen played three quarters, passing for 182 yards and two touchdowns and rushing for another. RB James Cook led the ground attack rushing for 53 yards and a touchdown. WR Tyrell Shavers led all receivers in yards with 69 and a touchdown. The defense forced three takeaways and had 4.0 total sacks. DE A.J. Epenesa, Von Miller and DT Ed Oliver each had 1.0 sack while DT DaQuan Jones and DE Greg Rousseau each had 0.5 sacks. CB Christian Benford and DT Jordan Phillips both had interceptions and LB Matt Milano had the fumble recovery. Oliver had a forced fumble as well. LB Joe Andreessen led tacklers with eight. Additional notes: After winning the opening toss and electing to receive the football first, the Buffalo Bills offense marched right down the field to score the first points of the day. On the drive, Allen completed four of six passes for 56 yards, including key third down conversions of 12 yards and 23 yards to WR Khalil Shakir and WR Mack Hollins respectively. On their first redzone play, Allen threw a short pass to TE Dalton Kincaid, who picked up 11 yards after spinning out of a tackle from CB D.J. Reed. Following a pass interference flag in the end zone Allen snuck the ball into the end zone to score the touchdown and give the Bills the early 7-0 lead. The Jets took over for their first possession of the game following the Bills touchdown. The Jets utilized their run game to move the ball down the field while QB Aaron Rodgers completed three passes for 24 yards. On fourth-and-one from the Bills 24-yard line, Rodgers handed the ball to RB Breece Hall, but he was stuffed at the line of scrimmage for no gain by DE Greg Rousseau, forcing the turnover-on-downs. On the Jets ensuing drive after the Bills punted the football, they once again were moving the ball down the field. Rodgers completed a 28-yard catch and run to WR Garrett Wilson that set up the Jets in the red zone. Two plays later though, Rodgers dropped back and threw a pass short, that was tipped at the line by Rousseau and intercepted by DT Jordan Phillips who subsequently jumped into the stands with fans. On just their third drive of the game, the Bills were forced to punt once again. P Sam Martin pinned the Jets deep in their own territory at the 5-yard line. After a false start and a rush that went for -1 yard, Rodgers dropped back to pass from his own 2-yard line. DE A.J. Epenesa beat LT Max Mitchell around the edge and found his way to Rodgers, sacking him for the safety. Both teams took turns trading punts to start the second half. On the Jets second drive of the third quarter, the Bills defense took the ball away from the Jets offense again. First Rousseau sacked Rodgers on second-and-15. Then Rodgers dropped back to pass and looked to WR Allen Lazard but instead found the hands of CB Christian Benford who ran the ball back 24 yards. The Bills were given an additional 15 yards because of an unnecessary roughness called on Rodgers who pushed Benford as he was running out of bounds. On the next drive, WR Amari Cooper got involved immediately, catching a nine yard pass before four plays later catching a 30-yard touchdown. Cooper rose up over CB Brandin Echols and hauled in the touchdown pass. The Bills piled on in the third quarter by scoring two touchdowns and forcing another takeaway. RB James Cook punched in a one-yard touchdown at the goal line to bring the score to 26-0. On the Jets first play on their next drive, Wilson caught the ball and broke away from a tackle attempt, but then DT Ed Oliver punched the ball out and LB Matt Milano landed on top of the fumble recovery. With possession at the Jets 14-yard line, Allen scrambled to his right and threw a pass across his body into the back of the endzone to WR Keon Coleman, who caught the ball over Reed and LB Quincy Williams. The Bills ended the third quarter with another sack by Oliver. To start the fourth quarter, QB Mitchell Trubisky stepped in. He and the offense picked up where Allen and the starters left off, throwing a touchdown to WR Tyrell Shavers. Shavers caught the pass from Trubisky and ran 69 yards into the endzone untouched for the first catch and first touchdown of his career. The Jets avoided a shutout when QB Tyrod Taylor checked into the game in the fourth quarter. Taylor led the Jets on a 13-play, 75-yard drive to score the Jets first touchdown of the game that ended in a Wilson touchdown grab. They then completed the two point conversion to TE Tyler Conklin to make the score 40-8. On their next drive, Taylor threw a 20-yard touchdown pass to Conklin, but threw an incompletion on the two-point conversion attempt, bringing the score to 40-14. Lineup Notes: CB Rasul Douglas returned to the lineup after missing two games with a knee injury; S Taylor Rapp returned to the lineup after missing two games with a neck injury; LB Matt Milano returned to the lineup after missing one game with a biceps/groin injury; WR Tyrell Shavers was elevated to the game day roster; DT Austin Johnson and CB Kaiir Elam were inactive.

                "content": "If not listed, please contact your TV provider. ORCHARD PARK, N.Y. (AP) Josh Allen reflected on Buffalo’s many offseason critics and doubters when asked about the Bills achieving their latest milestones while sewing up the AFC’s No. 2 seed with a 40-14 rout of the unraveling and undisciplined New York Jets on Sunday. It was a the Bills quarterback’s “I told you so moment,” even though Allen elected not to use those exact words. “It speaks to the staff that we’ve got here, the guys that we’ve got in this locker room, how this team is put together and the culture that we have,” Allen said. “We didn’t really pay attention to the preseason notions, but we heard them and we saw them and we knew what people were saying. \"But it had no effect on us.” Well, that might be a stretch when it comes to motivation. What’s unquestioned is how Allen and the Bills (13-3) overcame a young, patchwork roster following the offseason departure of six of eight team captains - including Stefon Diggs being traded to Houston - to run away with their fifth consecutive AFC East title and win a franchise-best 13 games for the fifth time in team history, and third since 2020. Coach Sean McDermott didn’t leave much doubt as to who deserves the most credit for leading the Bills to their sixth consecutive playoff berth, and helping them set the single-season franchise records for points (509) and touchdowns (63). “I think Josh Allen continues to show why he should be the MVP,” McDermott said. “I’ve been around this league long enough to know to see MVP every year for many years. And what he has done on this team and this organization in this community - and no offense to anybody else - but I’ve got a hard time believing that someone’s done more.” Allen threw two touchdown passes and ran for another score to become the NFL’s first player to score 40 touchdowns in five consecutive seasons. He did so in an outing Buffalo blew the game open by capitalizing on two Jets turnovers and scoring three touchdowns over a 5:01 span in the closing minutes of the third quarter. Buffalo’s defense forced three takeaways overall and sacked Aaron Rodgers four times, including a 2-yard loss for a safety in the second quarter. Nothing went right in what became a comedy of errors for Rodgers and the Jets (4-12). New York will finish with five or fewer wins for the seventh time over a 14-season playoff drought - the NFL’s longest active streak. “It’s kind of like the season, it just got away from us. Too many games got away from us,” said Rodgers, who finished 12 of 18 for 112 yards and two interceptions before being pulled in favor of Tyrod Taylor with Buffalo leading 40-0. “We were moving the ball well and then just hit a wall. And that’s kind of been the season.” Rodgers, who entered the game with 499 career TD passes and looking to become just the fifth player to reach 500, was instead shut out and became the NFL’s most sacked quarterback. The 41-year-old has now been sacked 568 times, moving ahead of Tom Brady (565) and into first place on the career list. Taylor accounted for all of New York’s points, with a 9-yard touchdown pass to Garrett Wilson and a 20-yarder to Tyler Conklin. Discipline was an issue for a Jets team that fell to 2-9 since Jeff Ulbrich took over as interim coach. New York finished with 16 accepted penalties for 120 yards. “It’s frustrating, it’s embarrassing, it’s maddening. It’s all of that,” Ulbrich said. Allen had a short and efficient outing, finishing 16 of 27 for 182 yards with a 30-yard TD pass to Amari Cooper and a 14-yarder to Keon Coleman before giving way to backup Mitchell Trubisky with Buffalo leading 33-0 through three quarters. And Trubisky piled on by completing a 69-yard touchdown pass to practice squad call-up Tyrell Shavers 2:23 into the fourth quarter. Shavers became the 13th Bills player to catch a touchdown pass, matching the single-season NFL record, to validate the “everybody eats” mantra Allen and the offense used to approach this season. The Bills defense enjoyed a dominating performance to snap a shaky three-game stretch in which it combined to allow 1,357 yards, 86 first downs and 107 points. “I wouldn’t say need ... and I don’t want to say reassurance, either,” said A.J. Epenesa, who sacked Rodgers for the safety. “But it just shows that this is what we can do and this is the standard that needs to be upheld.” Allen’s 1-yard score was the 65th rushing TD of his career, matching the team record held by Thurman Thomas. ... James Cook scored on a 4-yard run for his 15th TD rushing of the season, one short of the Bills' single-season record set by O.J. Simpson in a 14-game season in 1975. Cook matched Allen, who scored 15 last year. ... Wilson reached 1,000 yards receiving for the third straight year to start his career, the first Jets player to do so and the 10th player in NFL history to accomplish the feat.

                "title": "Aaron Rodgers - Wikipedia",
                "content": "Aaron Charles Rodgers (born December 2, 1983) is an American professional football quarterback for the New York Jets of the National Football League (NFL). He played college football for the California Golden Bears (where he set several career passing records, including lowest single-season and career interception rates[1]), before being selected in the first round of the 2005 NFL draft by the Green Bay Packers, spending 18 seasons with the team.[2] He is regarded among the greatest[3] and most talented quarterbacks of all time.[4] After backing up Brett Favre for the first three years of his NFL career, Rodgers became the Packers' starting quarterback in 2008. In the 2010 season, he led them to a victory in Super Bowl XLV, earning the Super Bowl MVP. He was named Associated Press Athlete of the Year in 2011,[5] and was voted league MVP by the Associated Press for the 2011, 2014, 2020, and 2021 NFL seasons. Rodgers is the fifth player to win NFL MVP in consecutive seasons, joining Peyton Manning, Favre, Joe Montana and Jim Brown. Rodgers has led the NFL six times in touchdown-to-interception ratio (2011, 2012, 2014, 2018, 2020, 2021);[6] six times in lowest passing interception percentage (2009, 2014, 2018, 2019, 2020, 2021);[7] four times in passer rating (2011, 2012, 2020, 2021);[8] and four times in touchdown passing percentage (2011, 2012, 2020, 2021);[9] three times in total touchdowns (2011, 2016, 2020); twice in touchdown passes (2016, 2020)[10] and once in yards per attempt (2011) and completion percentage (2020).[11] Rodgers is first on the NFL's all-time regular-season career passer rating list, with a regular-season career passer rating of over 100 (the first to ever have a career rating over 100) while also having had the highest passer rating, the best touchdown-to-interception ratio and the lowest passing interception percentage in NFL history throughout the entire 2010s decade. In the postseason, he is second in both touchdown passes and touchdown-to-interception ratio, fourth in passing yards, and fifth in all-time passer rating. In the regular season, he has the best touchdown-to-interception ratio in NFL history at 4.53,[12] holds the league's lowest career interception percentage at 1.4 percent[13] and the highest single-season passer rating record of 122.5.[14] Rodgers is also a four-time winner of the Best NFL Player ESPY Award. Rodgers was born on December 2, 1983, in Chico, California,[15] the son of Darla Leigh (née Pittman) and Edward Wesley Rodgers. His father is a Texas-born chiropractor who played football as an offensive lineman for the Chico State Wildcats from 1973 to 1976.[16][17] Rodgers is of English, Irish and German ancestry.[16] The family moved to Ukiah, California, where he attended Oak Manor Elementary School.[18] Edward Rodgers tossed a football with his sons Luke, Aaron and Jordan Rodgers, and told them not to drink and not to party in college or they would limit themselves in sports like he did. Aaron took this advice to heart.[17] At the age of ten, he was featured on the front page of the Ukiah Daily Journal for his top performance at a local basketball free throw competition.[18] Later, the family moved to Beaverton, Oregon, where Rodgers attended Vose Elementary School and Whitford Middle School, and played baseball in the Raleigh Hills Little League at shortstop, center field and pitcher.[19] The Rodgers family returned to Chico in 1997, and Aaron attended Pleasant Valley High School, starting for two years at quarterback and garnering 4,421 passing yards.[20] He set single-game records of six touchdowns and 440 all-purpose yards. Rodgers set a single-season school record with 2,466 total yards in 2001.[21] He graduated from Pleasant Valley High School in spring 2002, after scoring 1310 in the SAT and with an A− average.[22][23][24] Despite his impressive high school record, Rodgers attracted little interest from Division I programs.[25] In a 2011 interview with E:60, he attributed the relative lack of attention in the recruiting process to his unimposing physical stature as a high school player at 5'10\" (1.78 m) and 165 lb (75 kg). Rodgers wanted to attend Florida State and play under head coach Bobby Bowden, but was rejected.[26] He was only offered an opportunity to compete for a scholarship as a walk-on from University of Illinois.[27] He declined the invitation, and considered quitting football to play baseball instead or giving up entirely on the idea of playing in professional sports and attending law school after completing his undergraduate degree.[28] He was then recruited to play football at Butte College in Oroville, a junior college about 15 miles (25 km) southeast of Chico.[29] Rodgers threw 26 touchdowns in his freshman season at Butte,[30][31] leading the school to a 10–1 record, the NorCal Conference championship,[32] and a No. 2 national ranking. While there, he was discovered by the California Golden Bears' head coach Jeff Tedford, who was recruiting Butte tight end Garrett Cross.[33] Tedford was surprised to learn that Rodgers had not been recruited earlier. Because of Rodgers' good high school scholastic record, he was eligible to transfer to the University of California, Berkeley after one year of junior college instead of the typical two.[34] As a junior college transfer, Rodgers had three years of eligibility at Cal. He was named the starting quarterback in the fifth game of the 2003 season, beating the only team that offered him a Division I opportunity out of high school, Illinois.[35] As a sophomore, he helped lead the Golden Bears to a 7–3 record as a starter.[1][36] In his second career start, Rodgers led the team to a 21–7 halftime lead against #3 USC. Due to injury, Rodgers was replaced in the second half by Reggie Robertson.[37][38] The Bears won in triple overtime, 34–31.[37][39] Rodgers passed for 394 yards and was named game MVP in the Insight Bowl against Virginia Tech.[40][41] In 2003, Rodgers tied the school season record for 300-yard games with five and set a school record for the lowest percentage of passes intercepted at 1.43%.[42] As a junior, Rodgers led Cal to a 10–1 record and top-five ranking at the end of the regular season, with their only loss a 23–17 loss at No. 1 USC.[43] In that game, Rodgers set a school record for consecutive completed passes with 26 and tied an NCAA record with 23 consecutive passes completed in one game.[44] He set a Cal single-game record for passing completion percentage of 85.3.[45][46] Rodgers holds the Cal career record for lowest percentage of passes intercepted at 1.95 percent.[42] Rodgers' performance set up the Golden Bears at first and goal with 1:47 remaining and a chance for the game-winning touchdown. On the first play of USC's goal line stand, Rodgers threw an incomplete pass. This was followed by a second-down sack by Manuel Wright.[47] After a timeout and Rodgers' incomplete pass on third down, USC stopped Cal's run play to win the game.[47] Rodgers commented that it was \"frustrating that we couldn't get the job done.\"[47] Overall, he finished the 2004 season with 2,566 passing yards, 24 touchdowns, and eight interceptions. His 66.1% pass completion percentage led the Pac-10.[48][49] He finished ninth in Heisman Trophy voting.[50] After Texas was picked over Cal for a Rose Bowl berth, the fourth-ranked Bears were awarded a spot in the Holiday Bowl, which they lost to Texas Tech, 45–31.[51] After the season, Rodgers decided to forgo his senior season to enter the 2005 NFL draft.[52] Rodgers was expected to be selected early in the 2005 NFL Draft as he had posted impressive numbers as a junior with Cal, throwing for 2,320 yards with a 67.5 completion rate in the regular season. He threw for 24 touchdowns and only eight interceptions in his last college season, impressing many NFL scouts. They commented that he was a \"talented strong-armed junior\"[54] who \"combines arm strength, mechanics and delivery to make all the throws\", but noted that his stats could be inflated due to playing in a quarterback-friendly system and that he would need to adjust to the more elaborate defensive schemes of the NFL.[54] Before the draft, Rodgers was confident that he would be drafted to the team he supported and grew up near,[58] the San Francisco 49ers, who possessed the No. 1 overall pick in the draft.[59] The 49ers, however, drafted quarterback Alex Smith out of Utah instead, and Rodgers slid all the way down to the 24th overall pick by the Green Bay Packers. Rodgers has said that he experienced much angst and restlessness when waiting to be selected several hours into the draft, as he had expected himself to be selected much sooner.[58] Rodgers' slip to the 24th selection and the Packers choosing to pick Brett Favre's future replacement became one of the biggest stories of the draft, though he was still the second quarterback selected. His drop in the draft was later ranked number one on the NFL Network's Top 10 Draft Day Moments.[60] Many teams drafting between the second and 23rd positions had positional needs more pressing than quarterback.[61][62] Rodgers is one of six quarterbacks coached by Jeff Tedford to be drafted in the first round of an NFL draft, joining Trent Dilfer, Akili Smith, David Carr, Joey Harrington and Kyle Boller.[63] In August 2005, Rodgers agreed to a reported five-year, $7.7 million deal that included $5.4 million in guaranteed money and had the potential to pay him as much as $24.5 million if all incentives and escalators were met.[64] Rodgers spent his rookie season as the Packers' backup quarterback behind Brett Favre.[65] The Packers were 4–12 at this point and he received his first extended look in the opening preseason game against the San Diego Chargers after replacing Favre.[66] In his first NFL game, Rodgers completed two out of seven passes and was sacked twice. He continued to struggle through the preseason, before ending the preseason by converting two third downs and throwing a touchdown pass to tight end Ben Steele against the Tennessee Titans.[67] Once the regular season began, Rodgers saw very little action that year. He played against the New Orleans Saints in the fourth quarter of a 52–3 victory, and completed his first career pass to fullback Vonta Leach for 0 yards.[68] On December 19, 2005, Rodgers entered the game against the Baltimore Ravens at the end of the third quarter in a 48–3 loss.[68] He completed eight of 15 passes for 65 yards and an interception.[69] After the Packers' losing season, head coach Mike Sherman was fired and replaced by Mike McCarthy.[70][71] Rodgers was then placed in McCarthy's \"Quarterback school\" for six hours a day several times a week.[72] This focused on working on Rodgers' motor skills such as hand-eye coordination, finger dexterity, and mechanics.[73] McCarthy also worked on Rodgers' release point, moving it from right beside the ear hole of his helmet to further below it, to give him a smoother release.[74] When the 2006 preseason began, Rodgers played as the backup in all four games; he completed 22 out 38 passes for 323 yards and three touchdowns.[68] Rodgers saw very little action during the 2006 season, but did step in briefly on October 2 against the Philadelphia Eagles when Favre left the game due to injury.[68] On November 19, 2006, Rodgers broke his left foot while playing against the New England Patriots in a 35–0 defeat at home, filling in for an injured Favre, and Rodgers missed the remainder of the 2006 season.[72] Following the team's season-ending victory at Chicago, Favre announced that he would stay with the Packers for the 2007 season, again postponing Rodgers' hopes of becoming the Packers' starting quarterback.[75] Prior to the 2007 season, rumors surfaced about a potential trade involving Rodgers in which he would be traded to the Oakland Raiders for wide receiver Randy Moss.[76] However, Moss was traded to the Patriots during the second day of the 2007 NFL draft, and Rodgers stayed in Green Bay.[77] Rodgers stepped in when Favre was injured in the second quarter against the Dallas Cowboys on Thursday Night Football on November 29, 2007.[78] Rodgers completed 18 passes for 201 yards, with no interceptions.[78] He also threw his first touchdown pass but was sacked three times.[78] Rodgers brought the team back from a 17-point deficit to a 3-point deficit, but the Cowboys went on to win 37–27.[78] Favre's retirement announcement on March 4, 2008, opened up the Packers' starting quarterback position to Rodgers for the 2008 season. Although Favre decided to return from retirement, he was traded to the New York Jets, which meant that Rodgers would become the starter.[79] Rodgers quickly proved that he was one of the best quarterbacks in the league by passing for 4,038 yards in his first season as a starter as well as throwing for 28 touchdowns and only 13 interceptions. As of the 2023 season, this still stands as the most interceptions he has thrown in a season.[80] With Rodgers making his debut as a starter, the Packers beat the Minnesota Vikings 24–19 at Lambeau Field. This marked the first time since 1992 that a quarterback other than Favre started a regular season game for the Packers. Rodgers ended the game with 178 yards passing and two touchdowns (one passing and one rushing).[81] In just his second NFL start the following week, Rodgers was voted the FedEx Air award winner after passing for 328 yards and three touchdowns in a win against the Lions.[82] During the fourth week of the season, Rodgers' streak of 157 consecutive pass attempts without an interception ended when he was intercepted by Derrick Brooks of the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. The streak was the third-longest in franchise history behind Bart Starr (294) and Brett Favre (163).[83] Rodgers suffered a severe shoulder sprain in the game but continued to start and played well in a win against the Seattle Seahawks two weeks later.[84] Despite early successes, Rodgers had been unable to win a close game during the season despite seven opportunities to do so.[84][85] On October 31, 2008, Rodgers signed a six-year, $65 million contract extension through the 2014 season.[86][87] In Rodgers' first full season with the team, the Packers finished with a 6–10 record and missed the playoffs.[88] For the opening game of the 2009 season, Rodgers recorded his first win in a comeback situation. The Packers were trailing at the beginning of the fourth quarter when Rodgers completed a fifty-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Greg Jennings with about a minute remaining in the game to contribute to the 21–15 victory over the Chicago Bears.[89] Rodgers was named NFC Offensive Player of the Month for October 2009, when he passed for 988 yards, completed 74.5 percent of his passes, and recorded a passer rating over 110 for all three games played during the month.[90] After a 4–4 start to the season and a 38–28 loss to the previously winless Buccaneers,[91] the team began to heat up. Rodgers led the Packers to five straight wins, in which he threw for a total of 1,324 yards, nine touchdowns, and two interceptions.[92] Rodgers and the Packers won two of their last three games, finishing the second half of the season with a 7–1 record and an overall 11–5 record; good enough to secure a wild card playoff berth and clinch the fifth seed in the playoffs.[93][94] The Packers set a new franchise record by scoring 461 total points (third in the league), breaking the previous record held by the 1996 Super Bowl team (456).[95][96] Rodgers became the first quarterback in NFL history ever to throw for 4,000 yards in both of his first two years as a starter.[97] He finished the season fourth in passing yards (4,434), touchdown passes (30), passer rating (103.2), and yards per attempt (8.2) as well as eighth in completion percentage (64.7%), while also coming second among quarterbacks in rushing yards (316).[98] His passing yardage made him second all-time in Packers history, behind only Lynn Dickey's all-time single-season record.[99] His passer rating of 103.2 was also third-highest in team history at the time, behind only Bart Starr's 105.0 rating in 1966 and 104.3 rating in 1968 (minimum 150 attempts).[100] In the Wild Card Round, the Packers played the Arizona Cardinals, the same team they had previously beaten the week before, 33–7.[101] Rodgers and Cardinals quarterback Kurt Warner put on a show that later ranked second on NFL Network's Top 10 Quarterback Duels.[102] Rodgers' first pass was intercepted by Dominique Rodgers-Cromartie.[103] Rodgers settled down after that miscue, however, and finished the game completing 28 of 42 passes for 423 yards, with four touchdown passes all in a second-half comeback. His 423 passing yards are the most by any quarterback in his first playoff game as well as his four touchdown passes and five total touchdowns.[104] Warner shredded the Packers' second-ranked defense, completing 29 of 33 passes for 379 yards, five touchdowns, no interceptions, and a passer rating of 154.1. Despite Rodgers' offensive efforts, the Packers lost the game when he fumbled on a controversial play in overtime. The ball was returned by Karlos Dansby for the winning touchdown in the 51–45 Cardinals victory.[105] It was the highest scoring playoff game in NFL history.[106] Due to his regular season performance, Rodgers earned a trip to his first Pro Bowl as the NFC's third quarterback, behind Drew Brees and Brett Favre. However, after Favre dropped out due to injury and Brees was replaced due to his participation in Super Bowl XLIV, Rodgers became the NFC's starter.[107] In 2010, Rodgers led the Packers to a 2–0 start, but then lost three of their next four games, including back-to-back overtime losses. The two overtime defeats brought Rodgers' record in overtime games to 0–5.[108] At midseason, Rodgers had already thrown nine interceptions compared to only throwing seven all of the previous season, and was 16th in the league with an 85.3 passer rating.[109] Over the remainder of the regular season, however, his play improved as he threw 16 touchdowns to only two interceptions, completed 71.4% of his passes, and had a passer rating of 122.0.[110] In Week 13, in a 34–16 victory over the San Francisco 49ers, Rodgers had 298 passing yards and three touchdowns to earn his first career NFC Offensive Player of the Week honor.[111][112] In Week 14, he sustained his second concussion of the season. Backup Matt Flynn was put into the game as Rodgers' replacement. The Packers lost the game 7–3 to the Lions.[113] Against the Patriots, Rodgers missed the next week's regular season start, ending his streak of consecutive starts at 45, which is tied for the second longest in team history.[114] After their road loss to the Patriots, the Packers found themselves at 8–6 and had to win their final two regular season games to qualify for the playoffs. Rodgers turned around the team's performance; they won their final two regular season games, one of them against the New York Giants, where Rodgers completed 25 of 37 passes for 404 yards, with four touchdown passes, and with a passer rating of 139.9.[115] It was his first regular season 400-yard passing game. For his effort against the Giants, he earned his second NFC Offensive Player of the Week honor for the 2010 season.[116] In the next game, they defeated the Bears by a score of 10–3 in the regular season finale.[117] Rodgers was named the FedEx Air NFL Player of the Year for his passing performance in the 2010 season.[118] With a 10–6 record, the Packers entered the playoffs as a Wild Card and the No. 6 seed. In the Wild Card Round, they defeated the No. 3 seeded Eagles 21–16.[119] In the Divisional Round, Rodgers completed 31 of 36 pass attempts for 366 yards and four touchdowns in a 48–21 blowout victory over the No. 1 seeded Atlanta Falcons.[120] It was the most points scored in Packers postseason history.[121] During the contest, Rodgers tied an NFL record for consecutive playoff games with at least three touchdown passes (3 games). Rodgers also set an NFL record by becoming the only quarterback to pass for ten touchdowns combined through three consecutive playoff games. On January 23, 2011, Rodgers had a 55.4 passer rating as the Packers beat the No. 2 seed Chicago Bears 21–14 win to capture the NFC Championship.[122] After winning the NFC Championship, the Packers earned a trip to Super Bowl XLV against the Pittsburgh Steelers. In the game, Rodgers completed 24 of 39 pass attempts for 304 yards and three touchdowns in the 31–25 win, and was named Super Bowl MVP for his performance.[123][124] This would ultimately be his only Super Bowl appearance with the Packers. From his playoff performance, Rodgers became only the third player in NFL history to pass for over 1,000 yards in a single postseason and also became one of only four quarterbacks to record over 300 yards passing, with at least three touchdown passes, and no interceptions in a Super Bowl.[125] He finished with 1,094 passing yards, nine touchdown passes, two rushing touchdowns, and two interceptions, while completing 68.2% of his passes for a passer rating of 109.8.[126] From this postseason, Rodgers also became the only player to pass for at least 900 yards and rush for at least two touchdowns in a single postseason.[127] He was ranked 11th by his fellow players on the NFL Top 100 Players of 2011.[128] Because of the 2011 NFL lockout, the Packers and Rodgers did not schedule unofficial off-season workouts, despite many teams doing so.[129] Rodgers and the Packers quickly quelled any concerns over their readiness by defeating the Saints, who had scheduled off-season workouts, 42–34. He had 312 passing yards and three touchdowns to earn NFC Offensive Player of the Week.[130][131] After the game, Rodgers said in the press conference, \"I was going to ask myself, what would have happened if we had offseason workouts? I mean, could we have started any faster and scored more points tonight?\"[132] In Week 4, a 49–23 victory over the Denver Broncos, Rodgers had 408 passing yards, four touchdowns, and one interception and ran for two touchdowns to earn another NFC Offensive Player of the Week honor.[133][134] In Week 6, a 24–3 victory over the St. Louis Rams, Rodgers converted on a career-high 93-yard touchdown pass to Jordy Nelson.[135] In Week 9, a 45–38 victory over the Chargers, he had 247 passing yards and four touchdowns to earn his third NFC Offensive Player of the Week honor for the 2011 season.[136][137] Rodgers and the Packers got off to a 13–0 start in 2011, tying the NFC record for most consecutive wins to start a season, but were upset by the Kansas City Chiefs 19–14 in week 15, ending their winning streak at 19 games, the second-longest winning streak in NFL history.[138][139] Rodgers finished the season with 4,643 passing yards, 45 touchdown passes, and six interceptions, good for a passer rating of 122.5, which as of 2024 is the highest single-season passer rating in NFL history.[140] His passing yards, touchdown passes, and passer rating set single-season franchise records.[141] In addition to passer rating, Rodgers led the league in touchdown to interception ratio (7.5, fourth-best all-time), touchdowns passing % (9.0%, second highest all-time), and yards per attempt (9.2, fourth-highest all-time since becoming an official stat in 1970), while finishing second in both touchdown passes (45, sixth-highest all-time) and completion percentage (68.3%), as well as fifth in passing yards. He earned NFC Offensive Player of the Month awards for September, October, and November, and FedEx Air Player of the Week six times (Weeks 4, 5, 6, 7, 9, and 13). In week four, against the Denver Broncos, Rodgers became the only quarterback in NFL history to record over 400 passing yards with four touchdown passes, while also rushing for two touchdowns in the same game.[142] He was the winner of the 2011 Galloping gobbler as MVP of the Thanksgiving game between the Packers and the Lions, a 27–15 Green Bay victory, and tied an NFL record for consecutive games with at least two touchdown passes (13). The Packers became the fifth team in NFL history to finish the regular season with a 15–1 record.[143] Rodgers played in 15 of the 16 games, with the only exception being Week 17 against the Lions, a game in which Rodgers was rested after the club clinched home-field advantage for the playoffs the previous week. In the game, Rodgers assisted backup quarterback Matt Flynn in his stellar 480-yard, six-touchdown performance by helping call some plays.[144] The Packers' offense set franchise record for points scored in a season with 560, which as of 2016 is the third-most ever behind only the 2007 Patriots and 2013 Broncos.[145] Rodgers set numerous NFL records in 2011. He recorded a passer rating of over 100.0 in thirteen games during the season, including twelve games in a row (both records), and a passer rating of 110.0 or higher in twelve games, including eleven in a row (also records). Rodgers also won the league's MVP award, receiving 48 of the 50 votes (the other two going to Drew Brees). He also finished second, behind Brees, for the AP Offensive Player of the Year award.[146] Rodgers' 2011 season was later ranked as the third greatest passing season of all time by ESPN in 2013, and was regarded as the most efficient.[147] The Packers were upset by the eventual Super Bowl champion Giants in the Divisional Round by the score of 37–20. The Packers' receiving corps dropped six passes in the loss and Rodgers finished the game with 264 passing yards, two touchdown passes, and an interception on his last pass attempt.[148] The 2011 Packers became the only team in NFL history to go 15–1 and not win a playoff game, as well as being the fourth consecutive team to win at least 15 games and not win the Super Bowl.[149] Rodgers was named to the Pro Bowl for his 2011 season to go along with a First-team All-Pro honor.[150][151] He was voted by his fellow players as the best player in the league on the NFL Top 100 Players of 2012.[152] Rodgers and the Packers started off the 2012 season with a 30–22 loss to the 49ers.[153] With the loss, Rodgers lost his bet with the music group Boyz II Men, and had to wear an Alex Smith jersey during the next week of practice.[154] Had the Packers won the game, Boyz II Men would have sung the national anthem during their next home game at Lambeau.[154] In Week 4, a 28–27 victory over the Saints, Rodgers had 319 passing yards, four touchdowns, and one interception to earn NFC Offensive Player of the Week.[155][156] In Week 6, against the undefeated Houston Texans, he tied the franchise record by throwing six touchdown passes, in a 42–24 victory, to earn NFC Offensive Player of the Week.[157][158] The Texans had allowed only six total touchdowns passes during the season up to that point.[159] This sparked a five-game winning streak which Rodgers completed 65.7% of his passes for 1,320 yards, 17 touchdowns, two interceptions, and a passer rating of 119.1.[160] During that stretch, Rodgers was named NFC Offensive Player of the Month for October.[161] In Week 15, Rodgers threw for 291 yards and three touchdowns to lead the Packers past the Bears, 21–13, making them NFC North champions for the second consecutive year.[162] In the season finale, despite Rodgers going 28 of 40 for 365 yards, four touchdowns, no interceptions and a passer rating of 131.8, the Packers lost 37–34 against the Vikings.[163] This ended the Packers' twelve-game winning streak against NFC North opponents. The Packers finished with an 11–5 record, first in the NFC North, and clinched the #3-seed in the NFC playoffs.[164] Rodgers led the league for the second straight year in passer rating (108.0) touchdowns passing % (7.1%), and touchdown-to-interception ratio (4.875), while finishing second in touchdown passes (39), third in completion percentage (67.2%), fifth in yards per attempt (7.78), and eighth in passing yards (4,295).[165] In the playoffs, the Packers defeated the Minnesota Vikings 24–10 in the Wild Card Round. Rodgers completed 23 of 33 passes to ten different players for 274 yards and a touchdown.[166] They were beaten 45–31 by the 49ers in the Divisional Round.[167] Rodgers completed 26 of 39 passes for 257 yards, two touchdowns, and an interception, while also rushing for 28 yards, in the losing effort. He earned his third career Pro Bowl nomination for his performance in the 2012 season.[168] He was ranked sixth by his peers on the NFL Top 100 Players of 2013.[169] On April 26, 2013, the Packers and Rodgers agreed to a 5-year, $110 million contract extension making him the highest paid player in NFL history.[170] The Packers began their 2013 season against the reigning NFC champions, the 49ers, the team that also ended their playoff run the previous season. Rodgers went 21 for 37 in completions, 333 yards, three touchdowns and an interception in the 34–28 loss.[171] The following week, Rodgers had a career-high 480 passing yards to tie the franchise record in the 38–20 home-opener win against the Washington Redskins. He earned NFC Offensive Player of the Week for his effort against the Redskins.[172][173] His 335 passing yards in the first half set a club record.[174] He also became the first quarterback since Y. A. Tittle in 1962 to throw for at least 480 yards, four touchdowns and no interceptions in a game.[175] The following week, Rodgers saw his NFL record of 41 consecutive games without throwing multiple interceptions come to an end in a loss to the Cincinnati Bengals by the score of 34–30.[176][177] After the loss to the Bengals, the Packers started rolling, winning their next four games. Against the Ravens, the Packers lost two receivers: Randall Cobb and James Jones. Cobb was sidelined with a broken leg and Jones with a sprained PCL.[178] Against the Cleveland Browns, tight end Jermichael Finley was carted off the field with a bruised spinal cord, leaving Rodgers without three of his top four offensive weapons.[179] The next week against the Vikings, Rodgers completed 24 of 29 passes in a 44–31 victory.[180] At home against the Bears in Week 9, Rodgers was sacked by Shea McClellin. He fractured his left clavicle in the process, and the speculation for his return ranged from a few weeks to an indefinite timetable that became a weekly spectacle of whether or when he might be cleared to play again.[181][182][183] Before Rodgers had broken his collarbone, the Packers had won four straight games to climb to the top of the NFC North division with a 5–2 record. With Rodgers injured and unable to play, the Packers went winless over the next five weeks to fall to 5–6–1 on the season.[184] After rallying in December behind re-acquired backup quarterback Matt Flynn,[185] the Packers had fought their way back to a 7–7–1 record going into the final week of the season. On December 26, Packers head coach Mike McCarthy announced Rodgers would return and start in the season-finale showdown against the Chicago Bears at Soldier Field for the NFC North championship.[186] Returning from the injury, Rodgers threw for 318 yards, two touchdowns, and two interceptions in the regular season finale against the Bears.[187] Trailing 27–28 with under a minute to go in the game and facing the third 4th down of the drive, a 4th & 8 from the 48-yard line, Rodgers connected with Cobb, who was also returning for his first game since breaking his leg in Week 6, for a 48-yard game-winning touchdown to clinch the NFC North and earn the right to host a home playoff game against the San Francisco 49ers as the fourth seed.[188] Rodgers won the 2013 GMC Never Say Never Award for the come-from-behind, division-winning touchdown pass. Rodgers finished fifth in the league in passer rating (104.9), completion percentage (66.6%), and yards per game (282) while also finishing second in yards per attempt (8.75).[189] Rodgers led the Packers to the playoffs again, this time with an 8–7–1 record and were up against the team that eliminated them last year in the Divisional Round of the playoffs, the 49ers.[190] The Packers lost to the 49ers for the fourth consecutive time, 23–20 on a last second field goal at Lambeau Field, in the Wild Card Round. Rodgers recorded only 177 yards passing, his lowest in a playoff game, and one touchdown pass.[191] He was ranked No. 11 by his fellow players on the NFL Top 100 Players of 2014.[192] The Packers' 2014 regular season debut came against the defending Super Bowl champion Seahawks—a game in which they would go on to lose 36–16.[193] In Week 2, the team began the game with a 21–3 deficit against the Jets, but came back and won 31–24.[194] The 18-point comeback marked the biggest comeback in Rodgers' career.[195] In the third week of the season, the Packers offense was shut down by the Lions' defense, 19–7.[196] The Packers' 7 points were the fewest points allowed in a game Rodgers finished; the 223 yards of total Packer offense were the lowest since Rodgers took over at quarterback and his 162 passing yards were also a career low. For the third consecutive season, the Packers were off to a 1–2 start. In those three games, Rodgers threw five touchdowns and one interception combined, with a passer rating of 95.1. Amid widespread concern, Rodgers told the fans and the media, \"R-E-L-A-X. Relax. We're going to be OK.\"[197] After their loss to the Lions, the Packers went on a four-game win streak, during which, Rodgers threw 13 touchdowns with no interceptions.[198] In Week 4, a 38–17 victory over the Bears, he had 302 passing yards and four touchdowns to earn NFC Offensive Player of the Week.[199][200] In Week 6, against the Miami Dolphins, Rodgers led the Packers to a game-winning drive with less than two minutes remaining. He completed a 4th & 10 pass to wide receiver Jordy Nelson and mimicked Dan Marino's famous fake spike play by completing a pass to wide receiver Davante Adams to get to within four yards of the endzone later in the drive.[201] Rodgers then completed a touchdown pass to tight end Andrew Quarless to win the game 27–24.[202] This play would later win Rodgers the GMC Never Say Never Moment of the Year Award.[202] In Week 7, a 38–17 victory over the Carolina Panthers, he was 19-of-22 for 255 passing yards and three touchdowns to earn NFC Offensive Player of the Week.[203][204] In a Week 8 loss against the Saints, Rodgers finished 28 of 39 for 418 yards, with one touchdown pass and two interceptions, ending his 212 consecutive attempts without an interception streak[205]—the second longest in team history. In the game, Rodgers injured his hamstring which appeared to have an effect on his play for the remainder of the game.[206] In Week 10, against the Chicago Bears, Rodgers became the second player in NFL history and the first since Daryle Lamonica in 1969 to throw six touchdown passes in the first half.[207] Rodgers finished 18 of 27 for 315 yards and six touchdowns despite only playing one drive in the second half to earn NFC Offensive Player of the Week.[208][209] Rodgers set multiple records during the game: most touchdown passes of 70 or more yards with 16—breaking the record held by Brett Favre and Peyton Manning, most consecutive touchdown passes without an interception at home—breaking the record also held by Favre and Manning, and became the first quarterback to ever have 10 touchdown passes against the same team in a season.[208] The 55–14 victory tied the Packers' 55–7 win vs. the Titans in 2009 for the most points scored by a Rodgers-led offense. In a Week 11 game against the 7–2 Eagles, Rodgers set a record for most consecutive attempts at home without an interception, breaking Tom Brady's record of 288 consecutive attempts.[210] In the 53–20 victory, he finished going 22 of 36, with 341 passing yards, three touchdown passes and no interceptions.[211] The 8–3 Packers met the 9–2 Patriots in Week 13, at Lambeau Field in what was Brady and Rodgers' first time playing against each other as starters.[212] Rodgers finished going 24 of 38, with 368 passing yards and two passing touchdowns in the 26–21 Packers victory.[213] For his efforts in the month of November, he earned NFC Offensive Player of the Month.[214] Rodgers suffered a calf injury in Week 16, against the Buccaneers, due to severe dehydration he endured from flu-like symptoms he suffered during the week.[215] In the Week 17 game against the Lions, Rodgers re-injured his left calf while extending a play and throwing a touchdown pass to Randall Cobb, then was helped off the field, and carted off to the locker room. After missing a series, Rodgers re-entered the game with the score tied 14–14. Despite being less mobile with the injury, Rodgers completed 13 of 15 passes for 129 yards and two scores against the league's second-ranked defense. The Packers won 30–20, winning their fourth straight NFC North title. Rodgers finished 17 of 22 for 226 yards, two touchdown passes, no interceptions, a 139.6 passer rating, and a rushing touchdown to earn his fourth NFC Offensive Player of the Week honor for the 2014 season.[216][217] The Packers secured the second seed in the NFC, rewarding them with a playoff bye and a week off which helped Rodgers rest and rehabilitate his injured left calf.[218] In the Divisional Round, the Packers were scheduled to play the 13–4 Cowboys, which marked the first time in NFL playoff history when a team which went undefeated at home (Packers) played against a team which went undefeated away (Cowboys).[219] Rodgers helped secure a 26–21 victory by finishing 24 of 35 for 316 yards, three touchdowns, no interceptions, and a 125.4 passer rating.[220] The Packers then traveled to Seattle to face the top-seeded Seahawks in a rematch of the regular season opener.[221] In the NFC Championship Game, the Packers were leading 19–7 with just over five minutes to go, but the home team's offense finally woke up and, with the assistance of a crucial Packers special teams gaffe on an onside kick, the Seahawks led 22–19, with 44 seconds remaining. Rodgers quickly drove downfield to set up a tying field goal, only to watch from the sidelines as the Seahawks won the coin toss in overtime and proceeded to score the game-winning touchdown on their first possession. Rodgers was 19-for-34 for 178 yards and a touchdown, with two interceptions in the losing effort.[222] Rodgers finished the regular season first in touchdown-to-interception ratio (7.6), lowest interception percentage (1.0%), second in passer rating (112.2), yards per attempt (8.4), and touchdown passing percentage (7.1%), third in touchdown passes (38), seventh in passing yards (4,381), and ninth in completion percentage (65.6%).[223] He set an NFL record for most consecutive pass attempts (512) at home without an interception, and touchdown passes (41). Rodgers was voted the AP NFL Most Valuable Player for the 2014 season, receiving 31 votes,[224] and was named NFC Offensive Player of the Year by the Kansas City Committee of 101[225] and Fed-Ex Air NFL Player of the Year.[226] He was also named to the AP All-Pro team as the first quarterback, receiving 44 votes while runner-up Tony Romo received three.[227] He was named to the Pro Bowl for the 2014 season.[228] He was ranked as the second best player in the league among his fellow players on the NFL Top 100 Players of 2015.[229] In 2015, Rodgers had a down year by his standards. He threw for a career low 3,821 yards in which he played for at least 15 games, although he had 31 touchdowns to just eight interceptions.[230] Rodgers completed only 60.7 of his passes, averaged only 6.7 yards per attempt and finished with a passer rating of 92.7, all career lows. Pro Bowl wide receiver Jordy Nelson's absence due to injury for the season was considered a contributing factor in Rodgers' statistical drop compared to previous seasons.[231][232][233] In Week 3, a 38–28 victory over the Chiefs, Rodgers had 333 passing yards and five touchdowns to earn NFC Offensive Player of the Week.[234][235] During Week 9 against the Panthers, he finished with 369 passing yards, four touchdowns, and one interception. The interception came with only 1:47 left in the fourth quarter, and following the interception, Rodgers expressed frustration by throwing down a Microsoft Surface tablet.[236] The Packers ended up losing the game 29–37.[237] On December 3, 2015, in a Week 13 match-up against the Lions, Rodgers threw a Hail Mary pass caught by Richard Rodgers II for 61 yards with 0:00 left to beat the Lions 27–23, after the game was extended due to a facemask penalty called on Detroit.[238] The play was quickly dubbed as \"The Miracle in Motown.\"[239][240] The Packers made the playoffs as the fifth seed in the NFC with a 10–6 record.[241] They defeated the Redskins 35–18 on the road in the Wild Card Round of the playoffs. Rodgers finished the game with 210 yards and two passing touchdowns.[242] In the Divisional Round against the Cardinals, Rodgers threw a 41-yard Hail Mary touchdown pass to Jeff Janis as time expired to send the game into overtime. However, the Packers lost 26–20 in overtime. Rodgers finished the game 24 for 44 for 261 yards with two touchdowns and an interception.[243] He was named to his fifth Pro Bowl and was ranked as the sixth best player by his peers on the NFL Top 100 Players of 2016.[244][245] Throughout the first five games of the 2016 season, Rodgers' struggles from the 2015 season appeared to continue.[246] Through those games, he completed 60.2% of his passes, averaged 6.5 yards per attempt, and posted a passer rating of 88.4—all of which were similar to his 2015 numbers.[247] He also fumbled five times, and lost two. His lackluster performance through those games caused much speculation about the causes of his problems.[248][246][249][250] In a Week 7 Thursday Night Football game against the Bears, Rodgers rebounded by recording a franchise record and career-high 39 completions, breaking Brett Favre's previous record of 36 in 1993, also against the Bears.[251] Rodgers recorded 326 passing yards for his first 300-yard passing game since Week 10 of the 2015 season in the 26–10 win.[252] The following week against the Atlanta Falcons, Rodgers recorded a career regular season high of 60 rushing yards,[252] and finished with four touchdown passes and a 125.5 passer rating.[253] After a Week 11 loss to the Redskins—the Packers' fourth in a row, putting them at 4–6—Rodgers was optimistic about the remainder of the season, saying, \"I feel like we can run the table, I really do.\"[254] Despite widespread doubt over the likelihood of such a run,[255][256][257] the Packers would go on to finish the season with six straight wins—as Rodgers said they could. In a Week 12 Monday Night Football game Rodgers appeared to injure his hamstring on a scrambling play against the Eagles.[258] After the play, Rodgers went into an injury tent on the sideline to get his leg taped up.[258] Rodgers, however, did not miss any snaps in the game and finished 30 out of 39 for 313 yards with no sacks or interceptions.[259] His 300-yard performance was his fourth of the season and the first allowed by the Eagles' defense all season.[259] The Packers won, 27–13, snapping their four-game losing streak. In a 38–10 victory over the Seahawks in a Week 14 game, Rodgers and the Packers continued their recent offensive and defensive success.[260][261] Rodgers finished with 246 passing yards, three touchdown passes and a 150.8 passer rating. The 150.8 passer rating was the best recorded against Seattle's defense since head coach Pete Carroll took over in 2010.[260] Rodgers did this despite suffering a calf injury early in the game.[260] He was named NFC Offensive Player of the Week for his performance against the Seahawks.[262] On December 20, 2016, Rodgers was selected to his third consecutive Pro Bowl and his sixth overall in his career.[263] During Week 16, Rodgers and Drew Brees tied the NFL record for most seasons with at least 35 touchdown passes with four—a record shared with Peyton Manning and Tom Brady.[264][265] In the game against the Vikings, Rodgers finished 28 of 38 for 347 yards, four touchdown passes and a rushing touchdown to earn NFC Offensive Player of the Week.[266][267] His 300-yard performance was the first allowed by the Vikings' defense all season.[266] He also set Packer regular season records for most 4,000-yard passing seasons (6), most completions in a season (374), and—with Jordy Nelson—most touchdowns by a quarterback/wide receiver combination with (59).[266] Rodgers was named NFC Offensive Player of the Month for December.[268] Rodgers helped lead the Packers to a NFC North title and a playoff berth in 2016.[269] The Packers defeated the Giants in the Wild Card Round. Rodgers completed 25 of 40 passes for 364 yards and four touchdowns in the victory. They defeated the #1-seed Cowboys in the Divisional Round. With the game tied at 31 with only 18 seconds remaining with the ball on their own 32-yard line, Rodgers threw a 36-yard completion to tight end Jared Cook to put the Packers in Mason Crosby's field goal range. Crosby converted the 51-yard attempt as time expired to win the game.[270] Overall, Rodgers completed 28 of 43 passes for 355 yards, two touchdowns and an interception in the victory.[271][272] The Packers lost to the Falcons in the NFC Championship in the final game at the Georgia Dome. Rodgers completed 27 of his 45 passing attempts for 287 yards with three touchdowns and an interception in the losing effort.[273] In 2016, Rodgers finished with 401 completions and 610 attempts (both career highs), a 65.7% completion percentage, 4,428 passing yards, 40 touchdown passes, seven interceptions, a passer rating of 104.2, 369 rushing yards (career-high), and four rushing touchdowns.[274] With his 40 touchdown passes, he led the league in the statistic for the first time in his career[275] and became one of only four quarterbacks to pass for at least 40 touchdowns in multiple seasons.[276] Rodgers also finished fourth in passing yards, completions, attempts, and passer rating.[277] Among quarterbacks, he finished third in rushing yards and fifth in rushing touchdowns.[278] He was ranked sixth by his peers on the NFL Top 100 Players of 2017.[279] In a Week 1 victory over the Seahawks, Rodgers had his 50th career game with at least 300 passing yards. He finished the game with 311, but his streak of 251 consecutive passes without an interception came to an end when defensive tackle Nazair Jones picked him off in the first quarter.[280] In the next game, a 34–23 loss to the Falcons in Week 2, he had 343 passing yards, two touchdowns, and an interception in the first game in the new Mercedes-Benz Stadium in Atlanta.[281] In Week 5, down by 28–31 against the Cowboys with less than two minutes on the clock, Rodgers led a nine-play, 75-yard touchdown drive in the 35–31 victory, earning him NFC Offensive Player of the Week.[282] During Week 6 against the Vikings, Rodgers was taken off the field by his coaches and medical personnel after suffering a shoulder injury on a hit from Anthony Barr. Shortly thereafter, it was revealed that Rodgers suffered a fractured right collarbone.[283][284] The next day, on October 16, it was announced that Rodgers would have surgery on his broken collarbone.[285] On October 19, he underwent surgery on his collarbone, and was officially placed on injured reserve the next day.[286][287] A total of 13 screws were inserted to stabilize his collarbone.[288][289] Rodgers returned to practice on December 2, 2017, making him eligible to play in the upcoming Week 15 game.[290] On December 12, 2017, it was announced that Rodgers was medically cleared by doctors and was set to start the next game against the Panthers.[291] He was officially activated on December 16, 2017.[292] Rodgers returned during Week 15 against the Panthers, where he finished with 290 passing yards, three touchdowns, and three interceptions as the Packers lost 24–31.[293] However, two days later, on December 19, Rodgers was placed back on injured reserve after the Packers were eliminated from playoff contention.[294][295][296] He was ranked No. 10 by his fellow players on the NFL Top 100 Players of 2018.[297] On August 29, 2018, Rodgers signed a four-year extension with the Packers worth $134 million featuring a $57.5 million signing bonus.[298][299] During Sunday Night Football against the Bears in Week 1, Rodgers left the game with a knee injury but returned in the third quarter. Down by 20 points, Rodgers finished with 286 passing yards and three touchdowns, leading the Packers rally to a 24–23 win.[300] Despite a nagging knee injury, Rodgers had at least 40 pass attempts in each of the next three games. In the last of these, he threw his first interception in 150 attempts.[301] In Week 5, Rodgers passed for 442 yards (the second-best of his career) and three touchdowns, but also two fumbles, in a 31–23 loss to the Lions.[302] In the following game, a 33–30 victory over the 49ers, he had 425 passing yards and two passing touchdowns.[303] Following the bye-week, despite a continuing knee injury,[304] Rodgers had his third consecutive week with a 100+ quarterback rating,[305] which included 286 yards passing, no interceptions, and a go-ahead 40-yard touchdown pass to Marquez Valdes-Scantling in a 29–27 loss to the Los Angeles Rams.[306] In Week 14, against the Falcons, Rodgers set an NFL record by converting his 359th consecutive pass without an interception, breaking Tom Brady's previous record.[307] In Week 15, against the Chicago Bears, Rodgers threw for 274 yards and an interception in a 24–17 loss. Rodgers' record streak without an interception ended with 402 pass attempts after he was intercepted by free safety Eddie Jackson.[308] During Week 16 against the Jets, Rodgers finished with 442 passing yards, two passing touchdowns, and two rushing touchdowns. Trailing at one point by 15 points, Rodgers and the Packers won 44–38 in overtime.[309] He matched his own feat of achieving at least 400 passing yards, two passing touchdowns, and two rushing touchdowns in a single game. The only other time in NFL history that occurred was when Rodgers accomplished it in 2011 against the Denver Broncos.[310] On December 18, 2018, Rodgers was named to his seventh Pro Bowl.[311] He declined the appearance due to injury and was replaced by Russell Wilson.[312] In the regular season finale against the Detroit Lions, Rodgers suffered a concussion early in the game and would not return.[313] He was then sent to the hospital to test for concussion symptoms.[314] Because the Packers had already been eliminated from playoff contention, Rodgers answered questions about whether he should be playing, for fear of injury, by saying: \"That's just not the way I lead, and I'm super-competitive, and I want to be out there with the guys and I look forward to being out there.\"[314] Rodgers was later spotted at the Packers' facility after the game.[314] Rodgers finished the season with 372 completions, 597 attempts, 4,442 passing yards, 25 passing touchdowns, two interceptions and a passer rating of 97.6.[315] His touchdown to interception ratio of 25:2 (12.5) ranks third best all-time (min. 300 attempts).[316] In addition to setting the record for consecutive passes without an interception during the season, Rodgers set NFL records for interception percentage for a season, with only 0.335% of his passes being intercepted, and for the amount of thrown away passes.[317][318] He was ranked eighth by his fellow players on the NFL Top 100 Players of 2019.[319] Rodgers started the 2019 season with a new head coach in Matt LaFleur following the departure of Mike McCarthy.[320] The Packers offense relied less on Rodgers' trademark passes and more on heavy formations and play-action throws to take advantage of running back Aaron Jones.[321] Rodgers helped lead the Packers to a 3–0 start with victories over the Bears, Vikings, and Broncos.[322][323][324] In Week 4, against the Eagles on Thursday Night Football, he had 422 passing yards and two passing touchdowns, but also threw the game-ending interception as the Packers were handed their first loss of the season by a score of 34–27.[325] In Week 7, against the Raiders, Rodgers posted his first-ever game with a perfect passer rating of 158.3, the first quarterback in team history to do so.[326] He completed 25-of-31 passes for 429 yards and five touchdowns in the 42–24 victory.[327] He was named the NFC Offensive Player of the Week for his performance.[328] In Week 17, against the Lions, Rodgers helped lead the team to a 23–20 comeback win. As a result of the victory, the Packers secured a first round bye in the playoffs.[329] Rodgers finished the 2019 season with 4,002 passing yards, 26 passing touchdowns, and four interceptions.[330] In the Divisional Round of the playoffs against the Seahawks, Rodgers completed 16 passes on 27 attempts and threw for 243 yards and two touchdowns during the 28–23 win.[331] In the NFC Championship Game against the 49ers, Rodgers completed 31 passes on 39 attempts and threw for 326 yards and two touchdowns, but also threw two interceptions, including one to Richard Sherman in the final two minutes of the game as the Packers lost 37–20.[332] The loss marked Rodgers' third consecutive NFC Championship loss (a streak that would extend to four the following season).[333] He was ranked 16th by his fellow players on the NFL Top 100 Players of 2020.[334] Prior to a Week 5 bye, Rodgers helped lead the Packers to a four-game winning streak to start the 2020 season.[335] That winning streak would end in Week 6 against the Buccaneers, in which Rodgers threw for 160 yards and two interceptions, including a pick-six (the third of his professional career), during the 38–10 loss.[336] After a 3–2 stretch for the team, Rodgers threw for 211 yards and four touchdowns in a 41–25 victory over the Bears in Week 12. During the game, he became the 11th player in NFL history to eclipse 50,000 career passing yards, achieving the milestone on a 39-yard touchdown pass to tight end Robert Tonyan midway through the third quarter.[337] In Week 13 against the Eagles, Rodgers threw for 295 yards and three touchdowns during the 30–16 win.

Instead, he had received homeopathic treatment from his personal doctor. While unvaccinated, he committed multiple violations of NFL COVID-19 protocols for unvaccinated players, including attending parties with teammates while not using PPE and appearing unmasked at multiple postgame press conferences.[360][361][362][363][364] After a review, he was fined $14,650 for violations of the agreed protocols and his team was fined $300,000.[365][366] Rodgers was activated off the reserve/COVID-19 list on November 13, and returned to play the next day against the Seahawks, a game the Packers won 17–0.[367] In Week 15, Rodgers threw for 268 yards and three touchdowns in a 31–30 win over the Ravens, which clinched the NFC North title for the Packers for a third consecutive season and earned him NFC Offensive Player of the Week honors.[368] On December 23, 2021, Rodgers was named to his tenth Pro Bowl.[369] In a Week 16 victory over the Browns, Rodgers threw his 443rd career touchdown pass, passing Brett Favre for the most all-time career touchdown passes in Packers history.[370] For his play in the month of December, Rodgers earned NFC Offensive Player of the Month honors.[371] He finished the 2021 season with 4,115 passing yards, 37 touchdowns, and four interceptions.[372] On January 14, 2022, Rodgers earned his fourth career First-team All-Pro selection.[373] In the Divisional Round against the 49ers, Rodgers threw for 225 yards, but a poor performance by the special teams unit haunted the Packers, losing 13–10. It was Rodgers' fourth loss in as many games to the 49ers in the postseason and Rodgers' second home divisional loss.[59] After the season, Rodgers won the AP NFL Most Valuable Player Award for the second consecutive season and the fourth time overall.[374] Rodgers became the fifth player to win consecutive MVPs and first since Peyton Manning between 2008 and 2009.[375] Rodgers joined Manning as the only players in NFL history to win at least four MVPs.[376] He was ranked third by his fellow players on the NFL Top 100 Players of 2022.[377] On March 8, Rodgers confirmed that he would return and play for the Packers for the 2022 season after speculations that Rodgers could retire or demand a trade to another team.[378] There were reports that Rodgers and the Packers had agreed to terms on a 4-year, $200 million contract extension that would have made him the highest-paid player in NFL history, but Rodgers denied those reports on Twitter, stating that the numbers on the proposed contract were inaccurate, and that he had yet to sign such a contract. He did confirm, however, that he would return to play his 18th NFL season with the Packers.[379][380] On March 16, he officially signed his contract extension. The final terms of the contract was a 3-year contract (which replaced the final year of his existing contract) worth $150.8 million, with $101.5 million guaranteed. The new contract made him the highest paid player in North American sports history on an annual basis, surpassing the NBA's Damian Lillard's $49 million per annum contract.[381] In the season opener against the Vikings, Rodgers threw for 195 yards and an interception in the 23–7 loss.[382][383] In Week 4 against the Patriots, Rodgers threw for 251 yards and two touchdowns, but also threw his fourth career pick-six to Jack Jones in the 27–24 overtime win.[384] In Week 5 at London, Rodgers threw for 222 yards and two touchdowns in an upset loss against the Giants.[385] In Week 8 against the Buffalo Bills on Sunday Night Football, Rodgers threw for 203 yards, two touchdowns and one interception as the Packers lost their fourth consecutive game in the 27–17 defeat.[386] The next week against the Lions, Rodgers threw for 291 yards, a touchdown, and three interceptions in the 15–9 loss. It was the first time since Week 15 of the 2017 season that Rodgers threw three interceptions in a game.[387] Rodgers bounced back the following week against the Cowboys, completing 14-of-20 passes for 224 yards and three touchdowns in 31–28 overtime victory.[388][389] Following a Week 11 loss to the Titans, Rodgers confirmed he has been playing with a broken thumb on his throwing hand he suffered in Week 5.[390][391] A Week 12 loss to the Eagles left the Packers with a 4–8 record, but the team rallied off four consecutive wins to get to 8–8 before the regular season finale.[392] The Packers finished with an 8–9 record and missed the postseason following a Week 18 loss to the Detroit Lions in a win-and-in scenario for Green Bay.[393][394] Rodgers finished the 2022 season with 3,695 passing yards, 26 touchdowns, and 12 interceptions, which marked the most for Rodgers in a single season since 2008.[395][396] He was ranked 51st by his fellow players on the NFL Top 100 Players of 2023.[397] On April 26, 2023, Rodgers was traded to the Jets, along with the Packers' first and fifth-round selections in the 2023 NFL draft, in exchange for the Jets' first, second (via Cleveland) and sixth-round selections in the 2023 draft and a conditional second-round selection (which would have converted to a first if Rodgers played 65% of the offensive snaps in 2023, but it did not happen) in the 2024 NFL draft.[398] The move echoed the career path of his predecessor Brett Favre, who similarly spent over fifteen years as quarterback of the Packers before being traded to the Jets.[399] Although Joe Namath granted Rodgers permission to wear his retired No. 12 jersey, Rodgers announced that he would return to wearing the No. 8 jersey, which he had worn throughout his college career with the California Golden Bears.[400] On July 26, 2023, Rodgers took a pay cut and agreed to a reworked contract with the Jets.[401] Making his Jets debut in Week 1 on Monday Night Football against the Bills at MetLife Stadium, Rodgers injured his left ankle on just his fourth offensive snap after being sacked by Bills' defensive end Leonard Floyd. Rodgers was helped off the field and later carted to the locker room for further evaluation.[402] Rodgers' backup Zach Wilson went on to lead the Jets to a 22–16 win in overtime.[403] The next day, Rodgers was diagnosed with an Achilles tendon rupture and was later placed on injured reserve.[404][405] Rodgers underwent surgery on September 13, with Dr. Neal ElAttrache placing an internal brace in his left Achilles with the goal of a mid-January return at the earliest.[406] On November 29, the New York Jets opened the 21-day practice window for Rodgers. Limited in practice, Rodgers was cleared for functional activity but not contact.[407] He was activated off injured reserve on December 20, but the Jets announced he would not play again this season after their Week 15 loss to the Dolphins mathematically eliminated them from playoff contention.[408][409] After playing just four offensive snaps in his first season with the Jets due to an Achilles injury, Rodgers made his return on Monday Night Football in Week 1 to kick off the 2024 campaign. In his highly anticipated return, Rodgers completed 13 of 21 passes for 167 yards, one touchdown and one interception in a 32–19 loss to the defending NFC champion San Francisco 49ers.[410] In the Jets' home opener against the New England Patriots, Rodgers completed 27 of 35 passes for 281 yards and two touchdowns as the Jets cruised to a 24–3 victory.[411] In Week 5 in London, Rodgers became the ninth quarterback in NFL history to reach 60,000 passing yards but tied his career-high with three interceptions, including a game-sealing pick with under a minute left as the Jets lost 23–17 to the Vikings.[412] Jets head coach Robert Saleh was unexpectedly fired after the London loss, with some analysts perceiving that he did not get along with Rodgers.[413] When asked about it on The Pat McAfee Show, the quarterback firmly denied accusations that he had a role in Saleh's termination.[414] In Week 6, the Jets' first game after Saleh’s termination, Rodgers threw for 294 yards and two touchdowns, including a 52-yard Hail Mary pass to Allen Lazard to close out the first half, his fourth career such pass completion.[415] However, another interception on the Jets' final drive doomed them as they lost 23–20 to the Buffalo Bills.[416] Following the loss, the Jets traded for Davante Adams, with whom Rodgers had previously combined for over 600 receptions and 68 touchdowns during their eight seasons together in Green Bay.[417] However, the Jets continued to struggle, as Rodgers threw two interceptions and led the offense to zero points in the second half of their Week 7 matchup against the Steelers, losing their fourth consecutive game.[418] After a loss to the Patriots, Rodgers helped the Jets snap their five-game losing streak in Week 9 against the Houston Texans, throwing for 179 yards and three touchdowns in the second half after being shutout in the first half as the Jets won 21–13.[419] In Week 11 against the Colts, Rodgers threw two touchdowns and led the Jets to a season-high in points, but they fell short in a 28–27 loss, dropping to 3–7.[420] During their bye week, it was revealed that Rodgers had been playing through hamstring, knee, and ankle injuries but had refused to get scans done in fear of how severe they would be.[421] Despite this, he remained the starter following the bye week.[422] Entering Week 14, Rodgers held an NFL-record 34-game drought without a 300-yard passing performance, which he broke on December 8 against the Dolphins.[423] Despite recording his first 300-yard game in three years, the Jets fell 32–26 in overtime, eliminating them from playoff contention.[424] Since becoming a starter in 2008, Rodgers has become known for his unique touchdown celebration, which he and his teammates have dubbed the \"Championship Belt.\" After a scoring play, Rodgers celebrates by making a motion as if he is putting an invisible championship belt on around his waist.[425][426] Teammate Greg Jennings said of the celebration: \"It's just something fun that he does. We get excited when we see it cause we know that he's made a play or we've made a play as offense.\"[427] The gesture drew the praise of WWE wrestler Triple H and has become common for Green Bay fans to mimic during games.[428] He has also celebrated by doing the shoryuken, a jumping uppercut move from the Street Fighter series.[429] Rodgers has been vocal about his use of alternative medicine,[464][465] and is a proponent of the legalization of psychedelic drugs.[466] He revealed in 2022 that he had previously made offseason trips to Peru, where he consumed ayahuasca.[467] Rodgers is one of the most prominent American athletes to choose not to get vaccinated against the COVID-19 virus,[468] and was critical of the NFL's health and safety protocols during the COVID-19 pandemic.[469] His stances on the COVID-19 vaccine were criticized by scientists, health officials, and some former players and commentators, due to concerns that Rodgers was spreading vaccine misinformation and potentially was risking the health of his teammates.[470] During the NFL season, Rodgers frequently appears on The Pat McAfee Show.[471] One such interview in 2021 made headlines after Rodgers made several false and misleading statements about COVID-19,[472][473] implying that unvaccinated people were not the group most affected by the pandemic and that ivermectin was beneficial for people with COVID-19.[468][474][475][476] These and similar claims led some reporters to describe Rodgers as a conspiracy theorist.[472][477] Rodgers has voiced support for Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and his presidential campaign of 2024.[478] Kennedy reportedly included Rodgers on his \"short list\" of possible vice presidential running mates, along with others, including Jesse Ventura and Nicole Shanahan.[479][480] On Adam Breneman's podcast in 2022, former Packers backup quarterback DeShone Kizer said that Rodgers had expressed interest in 9/11 conspiracy theories at one of the first meetings between the two quarterbacks. Kizer described their discussion of conspiracy theories as \"a real thought experiment\".[481][482] Rodgers has also promoted the Tartarian architecture conspiracy theory.[483] In a January 2024 appearance on The Pat McAfee Show, Rodgers, without evidence, implied that comedian Jimmy Kimmel was an acquaintance of disgraced financier and sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, and that Kimmel's name would possibly appear in soon to be released court documents listing Epstein's associates.[484] Kimmel denied the allegations and threatened to sue Rodgers for defamation if he repeated the claim.[485] In a follow-up appearance on McAfee's show the following week, Rodgers stated: \"I'm glad that Jimmy is not on the list. I really am. I don't think he's the P-word [pedophile].\"[486] During a February 2024 appearance on the conspiracy-focused Look Into It podcast hosted by Eddie Bravo, Rodgers espoused numerous conspiracy theories on medicine, immigration, and John F. Kennedy.[487] His claims included that AIDS and COVID were created by the government for the sake of pharmaceutical industry profits (see also discredited HIV/AIDS origins theories and Operation Denver).[488] In 2024, CNN reporter Pamela Brown reported that Rodgers had in 2013 shared false conspiracy theories about the Sandy Hook massacre, claiming that the attack was an \"inside job\" perpetrated by the government. CNN simultaneously reported an allegation by an anonymous source that Rodgers had several years prior said \"Sandy Hook never happened....All those children never existed. They were all actors.\"[489] In response, Rodgers said, \"I am not and have never been of the opinion that the events did not take place\" but did not say whether he had ever believed the Sandy Hook massacre was an \"inside job.\"[478] Rodgers has two brothers; the younger, Jordan, played quarterback at Vanderbilt University and had a brief NFL career with the Jacksonville Jaguars and Tampa Bay Buccaneers.[490][491][492] Although Rodgers and his brothers were raised Christian, in an interview in 2017 he stated that he no longer affiliated himself with any organized religion.[493] Rodgers is the godfather to Cade Cobb, the second son of his long-time NFL teammate, Randall Cobb.[494] Rodgers was in a relationship with actress Olivia Munn from 2014 to 2017 and with former professional racing driver Danica Patrick from 2018 to 2020.[495][496][497] He started dating actress Shailene Woodley in the second half of 2020.[498] In an appearance on The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon in 2021, Woodley confirmed that she was engaged to Rodgers.[499] On February 16, 2022, Rodgers and Woodley called off their engagement.[500] Rodgers was initiated as an honorary member of Tau Kappa Epsilon (TKE) on January 5, 2012, at the Sigma-Xi Chapter at St. Norbert College.[501] In April 2018, Rodgers was announced as a limited partner in the Milwaukee Bucks ownership group, making him the first active NFL player with an ownership stake in an NBA franchise.[502] Rodgers was a longtime spokesperson for State Farm Insurance and was frequently featured in their commercials. In the commercials, Rodgers often highlights his \"Championship Belt\" touchdown celebration, which State Farm renamed as the \"Discount Double Check\".[503] Rodgers has also been featured in Pizza Hut advertisements,[504] as well as numerous local Wisconsin-based advertisements.[505] In May 2015, Rodgers appeared as a contestant on Celebrity Jeopardy!; he defeated Shark Tank investor Kevin O'Leary and astronaut and future United States Senator Mark Kelly, winning $50,000 for his charity. In April 2021, Rodgers had a two-week stint as guest host on Jeopardy! from April 5–16.[506][507] Rodgers has also made numerous cameo appearances on television, including in a 2013 episode of The Office, a 2019 episode of Game of Thrones, and a 2015 episode of the sketch comedy television series Key & Peele.[508][509][510] He also taped a cameo as Jeopardy! host for an episode of The Conners.[511] In 2021, Rodgers took part in The Match IV, which was the fourth installment in the exhibition match play golf series.

The team went up against Phil Mickelson and Tom Brady.[512] DeChambeau and Rodgers won the match 3 and 2.[513] Rodgers also took part in the sixth edition of The Match, where he teamed up with Brady against fellow quarterbacks Josh Allen and Patrick Mahomes.[514] Rodgers and Brady defeated Mahomes and Allen 1 up.[515] Rodgers is the founder, and the co-creator, along with David Gruber, of itsAaron,[516] a charity with a mission of \"creating awareness for organizations and people who are changing the world\".[517][518] He is also a supporter of the MACC Fund,[519][520] Raise Hope for Congo,[521] and other humanitarian and charitable efforts.[522][523] Rodgers' Celebrity Jeopardy! win earned $50,000 for the MACC Fund.[524][525] During his 2021 appearance as Jeopardy! guest host, the show made a charitable donation equal to the cumulative winnings of the contestants (including the runners-up) for those ten shows.[507] Rodgers is a supporter of his alma mater, University of California, Berkeley. He has donated funds to renovate the athletic facilities[526] and also established an endowed scholarship for transfer students at the school.

                "content": "Editions: En/nfl/new-york-jets Trying to push the New York Jets into parting ways with him Former NFL coach Eric Mangini believes Aaron Rodgers is trying to push the New York Jets into parting ways with him after a disappointing 2024 NFL season. This campaign marked Rodgers' return to full health after missing the previous year due to a season-ending Achilles injury, which occurred just four plays into the season. However, it appears Rodgers is growing increasingly unhappy with the Jets' direction, and Mangini has suggested that the quarterback is doing everything he can to get released. Related: During a conversation with Colin Cowherd on The Herd, Mangini explained that Rodgers' recent remarks seemed to indicate that he wanted out of MetLife Stadium. Mangini highlighted a specific comment from Rodgers that he believes was aimed at the Jets' dysfunction. Rodgers had referenced never being cut by a teenager, which Mangini interprets as a subtle jab at the Jets' owner and front office. \"The fact that Aaron brought up, brought up the 'I've never been cut by a teenager, I've never been released by a teenager,' that's a direct shot at the owner, that's legitimizing everything that's been said in that organization, that's making fun of how dysfunctional it is. So to me, as soon as he said that, that, in my mind, said he wants out,\" Mangini said. \"On the Aaron front, you'd like to keep Aaron because you don't want to deal with that salary cap hit and be strapped with that. But Aaron's doing everything he can to get cut. This cryptic remark has added fuel to the fire regarding Rodgers' relationship with the Jets, which has seemed strained for several weeks. Mangini suggests that Rodgers may be intentionally making his dissatisfaction known in hopes that the Jets will decide to part ways with him. Rodgers' frustration with the organization seems to have been simmering for a while. Earlier in December, he stirred the pot even further by praising the Detroit Lions and their management. Rodgers pointed out the success of the Lions' rebuilding process, particularly the decision by their ownership to remain patient during tough times. The Lions started the 2022 season 1-6, but their leadership maintained confidence in their head coach Dan Campbell and general manager Brad Holmes. Rodgers commended their commitment, noting that the Lions' strong finish to the 2022 season and continued success in 2023 were a result of that unwavering belief in the process. \"They started out the [2022] season 1-6,\" Rodgers said. \"Do you remember what the sentiment was from the organization? They said [Brad Holmes] is our GM and Dan [Campbell] is our head coach. Since that statement was made, they have won a crazy amount of games.\" © Unidad Editorial Información Deportiva, S.L.U.

                "content": "Janusz Michallik believes that Manchester City will still play their part in deciding who wins the Premier League title. Manchester City won for the first time in five Premier League games on Sunday after goals from Erling Haaland and Savinho earned a 2-0 victory at Leicester City in manager Pep Guardiola's 500th game in charge. The champions' second win in 14 games across all competitions meant they climbed two spots to fifth place with 31 points, 11 behind leaders Liverpool who have two games in hand. Leicester remain in the relegation zone in 18th. \"We needed it, all of us,\" Guardiola told Sky Sports. \"Just relief, that is the word to express how all of us feel. We have done incredible things and now we struggle to win games so now it's just relief.\" Savinho netted his first goal for City in the 21st minute when he pounced on a rebound from Phil Foden's long shot after Leicester goalkeeper Jakub Stolarczyk pushed the ball into his path. The Brazilian fired into the roof of the net from a tight angle. Haaland, who has two goals in eight league games in the worst stretch of his Premier League career, doubled City's lead in the 74th minute when he headed home a looping cross from Savinho, who latched onto a pass from Kevin de Bruyne. \"Things happen and we have to keep going, we have to stay positive and focus on the right things,\" Haaland said, before pushing Guardiola in the direction of the visiting fans who were chanting his name. \"It's always a relief to score and that was an important goal to go 2-0 up.\" The victory was far from a walkover, however. Leicester fans screamed for a penalty early on when Jamie Vardy found himself one-on-one with goalkeeper Stefan Ortega from a counter-attack. Ortega brought Vardy down in the box but Man City were saved by the offside flag. Josko Gvardiol nearly cost Guardiola's team a first-half goal with a disastrous header back to Ortega that was intercepted. City's disorganised back line saw Facundo Buonanotte clatter a shot off the bar minutes later. Leicester had another glorious chance early in the second half when Vardy headed into the box and James Justin got a touch on it that looked heading for the back of the net before Manuel Akanji cleared it off the line. Vardy missed an absolute sitter when he launched a shot just over the bar from close range. \"It was tight in the second half, they were much better. We don't have energy to sustain 90 minutes. Hopefully the New Year can help us bounce back,\" Guardiola said. \"To get results you have to do something. To do it in the position we have, many good things happened today. It is not enjoyable right now, it is just relief. We have done incredible things for many years. It is not the best.\" Leicester manager Ruud van Nistelrooy, who shared a long hug with Guardiola after the final whistle, told the BBC he has to judge his team's performance as well as the result. \"I wouldn't do the players credit if I didn't. We're professional, we know it's about results but we have to look through that because of the performance today,\" he said. \"We have to be judged on results and translate performances into results.\"",

The frailties that meant Pep Guardiola's reigning Premier League champions headed into this match on a dismal trot of one win in 13 across all competitions were again on display, most notably as Leicester repeatedly cut through a flimsy press and vacant midfield, during the first half. But the lack of cutting edge that has similarly afflicted City over the past couple of months was not a problem in the East Midlands. Savinho scored a long-awaited first goal for the club since his summer move from Troyes in the 21st minute. It was even more of a slog in the second half for English football's dominant force of recent years, who were in the rare position of being restricted to 33% of possession in the period between the restart, and Erling Haaland headed home his 14th goal of the season from Savinho's cross to seal the points.

Erling Haaland MORE: All the latest Man City news | Premier League schedule for 2024/25 | Latest Premier League top scorer rankings City started with a flicker of their old swagger as Haaland forced Jakub Stolarczyk into a sharp save from Kevin De Bruyne's volleyed cross. But a 10th-minute incident seemed to drain City's heavily diluted self-belief. Jamie Vardy sprung into the box and was brought down by Stefan Ortega. An offside flag meant an obvious penalty concession was averted as Guardiola's men struggled to recover their poise. As such, the breakthrough came against the run of play, Phil Foden moved smartly to get off a snap shot from Rico Lewis' pass. Stolarczyk saved, but could only push the ball out to the on-rushing Savinho, who clattered home a high finish from a tight angle.

In contrast to the ice-cool Dutchman, Josko Gvardiol was shockingly accident-prone as half-time approached and his botched aerial clearance led to Facundo Buonanotte heading against the post. City were late out for the second period, but Guardiola's words of wisdom did little to stem the tide. Manuel Akanji cleared off the line to deny James Justin before Vardy wasted a glorious close-range opportunity. The veteran striker would rue that profligacy in the final 20 minutes as Guardiola's side finally strung together a second-half attack with conviction. The criminally under-used England U21 playmaker James McAtee, on for Foden, started it with some wonderfully smart play on the right. De Bruyne worked the ball to Savinho, who crossed for Haaland to thump in a header at the back post. A much-needed 14th Premier League goal of the season for the big Norwegian and a much-needed three points for City. But perhaps it's McAtee, brimming with confidence, and Savinho after a breakthrough afternoon who can give them a route out of the darkness.

Don't expect this to spark one of their patented monster runs. They were pretty awful for large chunks of this game against a Leicester side who, if they avoid relegation, will not do so by very much. Guardiola is in deep conversation with Harry Winks, briefly stroking his face. He's a strange man, all told, but he can enjoy a nice glass of wine tonight. Maybe you will too. Thanks for joining us. 90 mins+5: Leicester keep coming and Patson Daka heads over under pressure from Lewis. It's a corner. Guardiola and Van Nistelrooy are already having a cuddle and a chat on the sidelines. 90 mins: Will Alves replaces Mavididi for Leicester. He'll have five minutes of added time to strut his stuff. 89 mins: That's a clever header from Vardy that glances the top of Ortega's crossbar. If he'd done as well with easier opportunities today the outcome would probably look quite different. 87 mins: Boyhood City fan McAtee is revelling in this cameo in front of an adoring away support. Haaland drives a break and finds the England U21 star, who curls for the top corner from outside the box. It wasn't far away. 81 mins: Buy a ticket, lads! Choudhury, who is on to provide a little extra thrust down the right, fires a fine ball across the Manchester City goalmouth but there's no one there to finish. 74 mins: GOOOOOOAAAAAAALLLLLLL!!!!!!! Erling Haaland!!!!!! Smash, meet grab. Finally City string together a nice break, with McAtee the instigator. Play moves to Savinho via De Bruyne and the Brazilian hangs up a delicious cross to the far post for Haaland to head home. The City fans away to my left go potty... then sing McAtee's name.

Hamza Choudhury replaces Justin for Leicester. Which might mean a change of shape. Doesn't look like it just yet. 68 mins: Oh Jamie Vardy, what have you done? Mavididi finds the Leicester captain in the middle of the six yard box. He volleys over and slaps the crossbar in frustration. 65 mins: In a move some fans have been calling for all season, James McAtee is coming on for Manchester City. Meanwhile, Vardy arrows a poor cross over everyone from a good position the right channel. El Khannouss flies into Lewis in over-enthusiastic fashion and the visitors can make their change. Foden, who looks exhausted, makes way. 62 mins: Kristiansen gets forward from full-back, Ajkanji with an important near-post header. Now Lewis fouls the Leicester man and it's a free-kick in a good position. It gets to Vestergaard at the back post, Vardy tries to turn goalwards, James does, Akanji off the line! 59 mins: Now a dangerous free-kick for Leicester, floated to the back post and Haaland is there to clatter away. All hands to the pump for Manchester City. 57 mins: Soumare gives away a pretty needless free-kick on the left. De Bruyne over it but Foden delivers and does so beautifully. Soumare atones by clearing behind. Haaland pops a volley towards goal from the latest short corner routine but Stolarczyk plunges onto it. 55 mins: Crucial clearance behind from Vestergaard. Foden crosses to the back post, Silva nods across and Gvardiol was lurking for the sucker punch, De Bruyne wastes the short corner. 54 mins: El Khannouss lets fly from range. Close enough but not worrying Ortega. The general flow of what's unfolding in front of the Manchester City goalkeeper might be though. 51 mins: Buonanotte goes down under an Ake challenge after being played through by Vardy. This will be checked. Ake is furious. No penalty. And you have to ask, if it's no penalty why isn't it a yellow for diving? City haven't really started at all this half and are inviting those sorts of situations. 48 mins: Kovacic fouls Buonanotte on halfway. He's been the lone combative participant in that City midfield at times but must be closing in on a booking. Back underway. Leicester have been out there waiting for their opponents for a little while, in fairness. And it's not warm. Manchester City get through to halftime. Again they look so vulnerable, their midfield an abomination out of possession. But Savinho's first goal for the club is the difference for now. During their ongoing slump, they also led against Sporting CP, Brighton, Feyenoord, 44 mins: This one is much better but Ake gets up brilliantly at the far post to clear. 43 mins: Corner to Leicester. They're really putting Guardiola's men under the pump. Dreadful delivery from El Khannouss but De Bruyne volleys behind to give him another go. 39 mins: BUONANOTTE AGAINST THE POST! Another perplexing decision from Gvardiol, who gets up at the back post and heads the ball up towards his own penalty spot. Via Mavididi it looks to Buonanotte, who turns a header against Orteta's right upright. Haaland and Foden then launch a blistering City break but can't find the finishing touch. 37 mins: Vardy, surely offside, finds Buonanotte. Great save from Ortega. Now the flag goes up up but the German keeper was not to know. 36 mins: Almost a bundling solo goal from Haaland! Gvardiol gets himself into some strife but Kovacic wins the second ball and City have fashioned a counter-attack. Haaland powers on past a couple of challenges, switches onto his left foot inside the box but drags just wide. 33 mins: Ohhhh, Leciester should be level! An absolute doozy of a ball in from the right by El Khannouss. Vardy leaves it, Buonanotte can't get on the end of it and it goes out for a goal kick. A wonderful cross that deserved a goal. 30 mins: De Bruyne down under a Vestergaard challenge. Some City players appeal for a penalty but the Belgian himself was rightly not especially interested. 28 mins: Haaland flexes the neck muscles on the end of a deflected Silva cross but it's easy enough for Stolarczyk to gather. 27 mins: Some swagger returning to City now, but we've seen already seen how fragile that can be. Time for Leicester to bed in. De Bruyne making a complete nonsense of a short corner helps their cause. 21 mins: GOOOOOAAAAAALLLLLLLL!!!!!!! Savinho!!!! Slightly against the run of play but how they needed that. Foden crafts something from nothing on the end of a Lewis pass and gets a shot away quickly from 25 yards. Stolarczyk parries but the onrushing Savinho cracks into the top corner on the rebound for his first City goal.

Ortega saves smartly and it's a corner. After a decent start, self-belief once again looks to have drained from the champions. Leicester waste the corner but Guardiola looks understandably concerned. 16 mins: More encouragement for Leicester as Vardy nips into the box. Lewis nips in smartly before the flag goes up again. City living dangerously because Vardy will time one of those before long. 12 mins: De Bruyne over the City free-kick. He scored from a similar range to this on this ground a couple of years ago... into the wall. 10 mins: Leicester scythe through the City midfield like everyone does nowadays, Ortega hesitates and brings Vardy down... offside. Good job for the City goalkeeper that it was because that was a definite penalty otherwise. 9 mins: Leicester look to break up the other end but Gvardiol closes the door on James. 7 mins: Fantastic save by Stolarczyk! Lewis floats a ball over the Leicester defence, De Bruyne volleys a first-time cross from near the byline. Haaland is on the end of it right-footed but the Foxes' keep does superbly to keep the strike out with his boot. 6 mins: Leicester's first foray ends with Mavididi sashaying into the box from the left and shooting wide of the far post. 5 mins: Kovacic coughs up possession carelessly but he and Lewis snap in to win it back before De Bruyne lashes over a left-footed sighter from way downtown. 2 mins: City with some patient, tentative possession before Savinho shifts gears past a few challenges into the box. He runs out of pitch before he can get a cross off, though. De Bruyne gets us underway. Foden starting wide right for the visitors. 4 mins before kickoff: Here come the teams, soundtracked by a bugle player. He'll probably get himself a Kasabian b-side at some point. Some flames pumped into the sky too. Appreciated the heat from that in a slightly nippy press box. 7 mins before kickoff: City are in the tunnel waiting for the hosts as the familiar strains of 'Club Foot' by Kasabian pump around the King Power. Jack Grealish, back on the bench today, appears to be in charge of morale as he aimings to lighten the mood with Erling Haaland and Kevin De Bruyne. 25 mins before kickoff: The teams are well underway with their warmups. One of the cameras servicing the stadium feed was trained on Erling Haaland for some time. As you'd expect, given the Norwegian superstar has only three goals in his past 13 Premier League games, an unheard of return for most of his career. Haaland and Phil Foden were passing the ball intently between themselves for a decent period. Guardiola needs overdue big performances from those two today. 45 mins before kickoff: De Bruyne has enjoyed himself a few times on this ground before.

They have won on each of their past four visits to the King Power Stadium without conceding a goal. However, clean sheets are not really part of the equation for Guardiola's team at this juncture and Leicester have also dished out a couple of the most painful beatings of his tenure. A raucous 4-2 win on this ground eight years ago marked a low point of the Catalan's first season in the Premier League as two late goals from the visitors undeservedly softened the scoreline. Then there was the Foxes' 5-2 victory at a behind-closed-doors Etihad Stadium in September 2021. That defeat immediately preceded the arrival of defensive lynchpin Ruben Dias (currently injured, of course) and City look like they need similarly transformative reinforcements next month. 2 hours before kickoff: It can't go on like this for Manchester City, can it? In the immortal words of Mick McCarthy... it can! Leicester are on a bad run of form themselves but being in a relegation dogfight against an opponent they've often enjoyed cutting down to size could be a combination of circumstances too heady for Pep Guardiola's incredibly brittle team. This Premier League match kicks off in Leicester at 2:30 p.m. local time. Here's how that time translates across some of the major territories: Jamie Vardy sat out the 3-1 loss to Liverpool with a knock. The veteran striker is back and will be keen to add to a handsome career record of nine goals against City. Ricardo Pereira (thigh), Mads Hermansen (groin), Wilfred Ndidi (thigh) and Abdul Fatawu (knee) remain sidelined. Wout Faes is also out with an injury sustained in the loss to Wolves. Jordan Ayew, who scored at Anfield, is suspended for this game, with Facundo Buonanotte coming into the forward line. Leicester lineup (4-2-3-1, right to left): Stolarczyk (GK) — Justin, Coady, Vestergaard, Kristiansen — Winks, Soumare — El Khannouss, Buonanotte, Mavididi — Vardy Injured: Pereira, Hermansen, Ndidi, Fatawu, FaesSuspended: Ayew (yellow-card accumulation) MORE: All the latest Man City news | Premier League schedule for 2024/25 | Latest Premier League top scorer rankings Kyle Walker (illness) and Jack Grealish (muscular) sat out the Everton game and will be assessed alongside fellow absentees Matheus Nunes and Ederson. Defensive injuries have arguably been just as big a problem for City as Rodri being out for the season. John Stones and Ruben Dias remain sidelined, although Nathan Ake was only substituted as a precaution against Everton on his return from a hamstring injury and will probably be asked to go back to the well once more.

He played college football for the Stanford Cardinal and was drafted by the Eagles in the sixth round of the 2023 NFL draft. McKee attended Centennial High School in Corona, California. He played in the 2018 U.S. Army All-American Bowl and 2018 Polynesian Bowl, where he was named MVP.[1][2] McKee committed to Stanford University to play college football.[3] McKee spent two years on a mission in Brazil for the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints before playing at Stanford.[4][5][6] His first season with the team was 2020, in which he played in one game, completing three passes for 62 yards against the then 12th-ranked Oregon Ducks. McKee competed with Jack West for the starting job in 2021. Although West started during the season opener against the Kansas State Wildcats, McKee still attempted 18 passes, completing 15 of them for 118 yards and a touchdown.[7] He was named the starter for the following week's game against the USC Trojans.[8][9] In just his 4th collegiate start, McKee led the unranked Cardinal to a miraculous upset victory against the #3 ranked Oregon Ducks, throwing 3 touchdowns and spearheading an 87-yard game-tying drive at the end of the 4th quarter.[10] McKee was selected by the Philadelphia Eagles in the sixth round, 188th overall, of the 2023 NFL draft.[13] He made his NFL debut in Week 17 of 2024 against the Dallas Cowboys in relief of Kenny Pickett, he threw for 54 yards and 2 touchdowns in the 41–7 win.[14] He connected with AJ Brown and DeVonta Smith for his first and second touchdowns, respectively.",

The one exception comes in their quarterback room, where Philadelphia is dealing with a slew of injuries. In a crucial divisional matchup last week, star quarterback Jalen Hurts was lit up on a scramble and left the game with a concussion. He was unable to clear concussion protocol ahead of Week 17, making him unavailable for the Eagles' game against the Cowboys. Kenny Pickett filled in for Hurts last week and got the call this Sunday, but Pickett's first start of the season didn't last long, as he took a shot to the ribs in the third quarter which forced him to exit the game. With both Hurts and Pickett sidelined, the Eagles turned to second-year quarterback Tanner McKee. This marked McKee's first appearance in a regular season game of his young career. McKee played admirably against the Cowboys and even cemented himself in the NFL \"history book\" of obscure stats. Tanner McKee of the @Eagles is the first player in the NFL Draft era (since 1936) to have multiple TD passes in his NFL debut while attempting five or fewer passes. pic.twitter.com/gZcJbSoIWs After making his NFL debut, let's get to know McKee's background. NFL HQ: Live NFL scores | Updated NFL standings | Full NFL schedule McKee was the Eagles' 6th-round selection in the 2023 draft out of Stanford University. Before today, McKee had only seen NFL playing time in the preseason, where he went 34-of-56 for 296 passing yards in three games during the 2024 preseason. A native of Irvine, Calif., McKee spent the entirety of his football career in the Sunshine State prior to being drafted by the Eagles. Outside of football, McKee most notably spent two years on mission for the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints before joining the football team at Stanford. Even with two years away from the game, McKee is still just 24 and in the second year of his NFL career. Prior to being drafted by the Eagles, McKee spent his collegiate career with the Stanford Cardinal. He appeared in 23 games for the Cardinal before declaring for the 2023 NFL Draft. MORE NFL WEEK 17: McKee didn't get much of a chance to play in his first collegiate season, but he went on to win the starting job in his sophomore year. He took off from there, throwing for a combined 5,274 yards and 28 touchdowns in his final two seasons. McKee's collegiate career was highlighted by an upset victory over the No. 3 ranked Oregon Ducks in his sophomore season. Unfortunately, he was not able to lead the Cardinal to a bowl game in his two seasons as the primary starter at Stanford.

                "title": "Why Eagles Tanner McKee was a Brazil media star ahead of Packers game",
                "content": "SAO PAULO, Brazil − The Eagles held a press conference for Brazilian media members Thursday, featuring some of their key players like quarterback Jalen Hurts and running back Saquon Barkley. But it was Eagles' third-string quarterback Tanner McKee, who has never played a down in an NFL game, who stole the proverbial show. ON THE SCENE:It's Day 1 in São Paulo, Brazil, for Eagles: Here are writer Martin Frank's observations SUPER BOWL OR SUPER BUST?5 things that can propel Eagles to the Super Bowl this season. This rookie will be key McKee was already well known in Brazil because he spent nearly two years in the South American country, from 2018-20, on a mission for the Church of Jesus Christ and Latter-Day Saints. He became fluent in Portuguese during that time. And it made the media's day when McKee took a question in Portuguese from a reporter, then answered in Portuguese, then translated it into English, even though the NFL had supplied a translator. This is how the exchange went after the question came in: McKee said to the crowd of about 50 media members: \"You want me to do it in Portuguese?\" The translator said the question in English: \"Basically, we wanted (to know what it’s like) to be back in Brazil again and be back here after years of living here.\" McKee responded: \"So you want me to say it in Portuguese and you’ll translate it? I can translate for myself.\" After a long answer in Portuguese, McKee says in English: “It’s great to be back.\" Then there was a long pause for effect, followed by laughter, before McKee continued: \"It’s pretty fun because I always try to keep up with my Portuguese. I try to say things on Whatsapp or Instagram with people that I’ve met and had friendships with down here. \"But it’s different (today) because we can actually talk to someone face to face. I have family that’s here. My wife’s here. My parents are here. And they’re going to Rio and places that I lived and served in … So it’s really fun to just kind of be back in the culture.\" McKee was asked another question in Portuguese about some players' fears about crime in Brazil, which has been reported over the past week. And if McKee has talked to those players to allay their fears. Again, McKee answered in Portuguese, then translated for himself: \"I was just saying, a lot of guys haven’t been here before, so it’s a lot of things they don’t really know. So they’re asking me, 'How’s the crime rate? How’s this?' We have a lot of things that we do whenever we travel to any city: We’re going to have to be safe. We’re not going to walk out on the street, whether we’re in the United States or outside of the United States. \"It’s not necessarily specific to here. It’s just a) people don’t really know the culture, and b) it is a big city … The people are great. The (players) are excited for the game. There’s nothing to be scared of. It’s pretty cool.\" The Brazilian media also asked McKee a football question, about what the offense will look like under new coordinator Kellen Moore. And here, McKee provided some clues for what the offense might look like Friday night. \"A lot of pre-snap motion, a lot of changing things on defense,\" he said. \"I think it is more quarterback friendly of just being able to go through progressions. I think with football, we have a lot of good players, and you don’t want to slow down by having to think too much. \"You just want to go out and play fast, and have a kind of clean edge and go out and play. I think that’s kind of what they’re giving us this year – go out and play football, let’s not over-complicate things ... We’re going to run what we run. I’m just excited to see it, and I’m just as excited for you guys to see AJ (Brown) and (DeVonta Smith) and Jalen and Saquon go do their thing.\" Contact Martin Frank at mfrank@delawareonline.

        "Hanukkah": [
            {
                "title": "Hanukkah - Wikipedia",
                "content": "Hanukkah[a] (/ˈhænəkə/, /ˈhɑːnəkə/; חֲנֻכָּה‎ Ḥănukkā listenⓘ) is a Jewish festival commemorating the recovery of Jerusalem and subsequent rededication of the Second Temple at the beginning of the Maccabean Revolt against the Seleucid Empire in the 2nd century BCE.[3][4] Hanukkah is observed for eight nights and days,[5] starting on the 25th day of Kislev according to the Hebrew calendar, which may occur at any time from November 28 to December 27 in the Gregorian calendar. The festival is observed by lighting the candles of a candelabrum with nine branches, commonly called a menorah or hanukkiah. One branch is placed above or below the others and its candle is used to light the other eight candles. This unique candle is called the shammash (שַׁמָּשׁ‎, \"attendant\"). Each night, one additional candle is lit by the shammash until all eight candles are lit together on the final night of the festival.[6] Other Hanukkah festivities include singing Hanukkah songs, playing the game of dreidel and eating oil-based foods, such as latkes and sufganiyot (similar to jelly donuts), and dairy foods. Since the 1970s, the worldwide Chabad Hasidic movement has initiated public menorah lightings in open public places in many countries.[7] Originally instituted as a feast \"in the manner of Sukkot (Booths)\", it does not come with the corresponding obligations, and is therefore a relatively minor holiday in strictly religious terms. Nevertheless, Hanukkah has attained major cultural significance in North America and elsewhere, especially among secular Jews, due to often occurring around the same time as Christmas during the festive season.[8] The name \"Hanukkah\" derives from the Hebrew verb \"חנך‎\", meaning \"to dedicate\". On Hanukkah, the Maccabean Jews regained control of Jerusalem and rededicated the Temple.[9][10] Many homiletical explanations have been given for the name:[11] In Hebrew, the word Hanukkah is written חֲנֻכָּה‎ or חֲנוּכָּה‎ (Ḥănukā). It is most commonly transliterated to English as Hanukkah or Chanukah. The spelling Hanukkah, which is based on using characters of the English alphabet as symbols to re-create the word's correct spelling in Hebrew,[14] is the most common[15] and the preferred choice of Merriam–Webster,[16] Collins English Dictionary, the Oxford Style Manual, and the style guides of The New York Times and The Guardian.[17] The sound represented by Ch ([χ], similar to the Scottish pronunciation of loch) is not native to the English language.[18] Furthermore, the letter ḥeth (ח‎), which is the first letter in the Hebrew spelling, is pronounced differently in modern Hebrew (voiceless uvular fricative) from in classical Hebrew (voiceless pharyngeal fricative [ħ]), and neither of those sounds is unambiguously representable in English spelling. However, its original sound is closer to the English H than to the Scottish Ch, and Hanukkah more accurately represents the spelling in the Hebrew alphabet.[14] Moreover, the 'kaf' consonant is geminate in classical (but not modern) Hebrew. Adapting the classical Hebrew pronunciation with the geminate and pharyngeal Ḥeth can lead to the spelling Hanukkah, while adapting the modern Hebrew pronunciation with no gemination and uvular Ḥeth leads to the spelling Chanukah.[19][20][21] In Modern Hebrew, Hanukkah may also be called the Festival of Lights (חַג הַאוּרִים‎, Ḥag HaUrim), based on a comment by Josephus in Antiquities of the Jews, καὶ ἐξ ἐκείνου μέχρι τοῦ δεῦρο τὴν ἑορτὴν ἄγομεν καλοῦντες αὐτὴν φῶτα \"And from then on we celebrate this festival, and we call it Lights\". The first Hebrew translation of Antiquities (1864) used (חַג הַמְּאֹרוֹת‎) \"Festival of Lamps\", but the translation \"Festival of Lights\" (חַג הַאוּרִים‎) appeared by the end of the nineteenth century.[22] The story of Hanukkah is told in the books of the First and Second Maccabees, which describe in detail the rededication of the Temple in Jerusalem and the lighting of the menorah. These books, however, are not a part of the canonized Masoretic Text version of the Tanakh (Hebrew and Aramaic language Jewish Bible) used and accepted by normative Rabbinical Judaism and therefore modern Jews (as copied, edited and distributed by a group of Jews known as the Masoretes between the 7th and 10th centuries of the Common Era). However, the books of Maccabees were included among the deuterocanonical books added to the Septuagint, a Jewish scholarly Greek-language translation of the Hebrew Bible originally compiled in the mid-3rd century BCE. The Roman Catholic and Orthodox Churches consider the books of Maccabees as a canonical part of the Old Testament.[23] The eight-day rededication of the temple is described in 1 Maccabees,[24] though the miracle of the oil does not appear here. A story similar in character, and older in date, is the one alluded to in 2 Maccabees[25] according to which the relighting of the altar fire by Nehemiah was due to a miracle which occurred on the 25th of Kislev, and which appears to be given as the reason for the selection of the same date for the rededication of the altar by Judah Maccabee.[26] The above account in 1 Maccabees, as well as 2 Maccabees[27] portrays the feast as a delayed observation of the eight-day Feast of Booths (Sukkot); similarly 2 Maccabees explains the length of the feast as \"in the manner of the Feast of Booths\".[28] Megillat Taanit (1st century) contains a list of festive days on which fasting or eulogizing is forbidden. It specifies, \"On the 25th of [Kislev] is Hanukkah of eight days, and one is not to eulogize\" and then references the story of the rededication of the Temple.[29] The Mishna (late 2nd century) mentions Hanukkah in several places,[30] but never describes its laws in detail and never mentions any aspect of the history behind it. To explain the Mishna's lack of a systematic discussion of Hanukkah, Nissim ben Jacob postulated that information on the holiday was so commonplace that the Mishna felt no need to explain it.[31] Modern scholar Reuvein Margolies suggests that as the Mishnah was redacted after the Bar Kochba revolt, its editors were reluctant to include explicit discussion of a holiday celebrating another relatively recent revolt against a foreign ruler, for fear of antagonizing the Romans.[32] The miracle of the one-day supply of oil miraculously lasting eight days is described in the Talmud, committed to writing about 600 years after the events described in the books of Maccabees.[33] The Talmud says that after the forces of Antiochus IV had been driven from the Temple, the Maccabees discovered that almost all of the ritual olive oil had been profaned. They found only a single container that was still sealed by the High Priest, with enough oil to keep the menorah in the Temple lit for a single day. They used this, yet it burned for eight days (the time it took to have new oil pressed and made ready).[34] The Talmud presents three options:[35] Except in times of danger, the lights were to be placed outside one's door, on the opposite side of the mezuza, or in the window closest to the street. Rashi, in a note to Shabbat 21b, says their purpose is to publicize the miracle. The blessings for Hanukkah lights are discussed in tractate Succah, p. 46a.[36] Megillat Antiochus (probably composed in the 2nd century[37]) concludes with the following words: ...After this, the sons of Israel went up to the Temple and rebuilt its gates and purified the Temple from the dead bodies and from the defilement. And they sought after pure olive oil to light the lamps therewith, but could not find any, except one bowl that was sealed with the signet ring of the High Priest from the days of Samuel the prophet and they knew that it was pure. There was in it [enough oil] to light [the lamps therewith] for one day, but the God of heaven whose name dwells there put therein his blessing and they were able to light from it eight days. Therefore, the sons of Ḥashmonai made this covenant and took upon themselves a solemn vow, they and the sons of Israel, all of them, to publish amongst the sons of Israel, [to the end] that they might observe these eight days of joy and honour, as the days of the feasts written in [the book of] the Law; [even] to light in them so as to make known to those who come after them that their God wrought for them salvation from heaven. In them, it is not permitted to mourn, neither to decree a fast [on those days], and anyone who has a vow to perform, let him perform it.[38] The Al HaNissim prayer is recited on Hanukkah as an addition to the Amidah prayer, which was formalized in the late 1st century.[39] Al HaNissim describes the history of the holiday as follows: The Jewish historian Titus Flavius Josephus narrates in his book, Jewish Antiquities XII, how the victorious Judas Maccabeus ordered lavish yearly eight-day festivities after rededicating the Temple in Jerusalem that had been profaned by Antiochus IV Epiphanes.[40] Josephus does not say the festival was called Hanukkah but rather the \"Festival of Lights\": In the New Testament, John 10:22–23 says, \"Then came the Festival of Dedication at Jerusalem. It was winter, and Jesus was in the temple courts walking in Solomon's Colonnade\" (NIV). The Greek noun used appears in the neuter plural as \"the renewals\" or \"the consecrations\" (Ancient Greek: τὰ ἐγκαίνια; ta enkaínia).[42] The same root appears in 2 Esdras 6:16 in the Septuagint to refer specifically to Hanukkah. This Greek word was chosen because the Hebrew word for 'consecration' or 'dedication' is Hanukkah (חנכה). The Aramaic New Testament uses the Aramaic word hawdata (a close synonym), which literally means 'renewal' or 'to make new'.[43] After the death of Alexander the Great in 323 BCE, Judea became part of the Ptolemaic Kingdom of Egypt until 200 BCE, when King Antiochus III the Great of Syria defeated King Ptolemy V Epiphanes of Egypt at the Battle of Panium. Judea then became part of the Seleucid Empire of Syria.[44] King Antiochus III the Great, wanting to conciliate his new Jewish subjects, guaranteed their right to \"live according to their ancestral customs\" and to continue to practice their religion in the Temple of Jerusalem.[45] The Seleucids, like the Ptolemies before them, held a suzerainty over Judea, where they respected Jewish culture and protected Jewish institutions. This policy was drastically reversed by Antiochus IV Epiphanes, the son of Antiochus III, seemingly after what was either a dispute over leadership of the Temple in Jerusalem and the office of High Priest, or possibly a revolt whose nature was lost to time after being crushed.[46] In 175 BCE, Antiochus IV invaded Judea at the request of the sons of Tobias.[47] The Tobiads, who led the Hellenizing Jewish faction in Jerusalem, were expelled to Syria around 170 BCE when the high priest Onias and his pro-Egyptian faction wrested control from them. The exiled Tobiads lobbied Antiochus IV Epiphanes to recapture Jerusalem. As Flavius Josephus relates: The king being thereto disposed beforehand, complied with them, and came upon the Jews with a great army, and took their city by force, and slew a great multitude of those that favored Ptolemy, and sent out his soldiers to plunder them without mercy. He also spoiled the temple, and put a stop to the constant practice of offering a daily sacrifice of expiation for three years and six months. When the Second Temple in Jerusalem was looted and services stopped, Judaism was outlawed. In 167 BCE, Antiochus ordered an altar to Zeus erected in the Temple. He banned brit milah (circumcision) and ordered pigs to be sacrificed at the altar of the temple.[49] Antiochus's actions provoked a large-scale revolt. Mattathias (Mattityahu), a Jewish priest, and his five sons Jochanan, Simeon, Eleazar, Jonathan, and Judah led a rebellion against Antiochus. It started with Mattathias killing first a Jew who wanted to comply with Antiochus's order to sacrifice to Zeus, and then a Greek official who was to enforce the government's behest (1 Mac. 2, 24–25[50]). Judah became known as Yehuda HaMakabi (\"Judah the Hammer\"). By 166 BCE, Mattathias had died, and Judah took his place as leader. By 164 BCE, the Jewish revolt against the Seleucid monarchy was successful. The Temple was liberated and rededicated. The festival of Hanukkah was instituted to celebrate this event.[51] Judah ordered the Temple to be cleansed, a new altar to be built in place of the polluted one and new holy vessels to be made.[26] According to the Talmud, \"For when the Greeks entered the Sanctuary, they defiled all the oils therein, and when the Hasmonean dynasty prevailed against and defeated them, they made search and found only one cruse of oil which lay with the seal of the kohen gadol (high priest), but which contained sufficient [oil] for one day's lighting only; yet a miracle was wrought therein, and they lit [the lamp] therewith for eight days. The following year these [days] were appointed a Festival with [the recital of] Hallel and thanksgiving.\" —Shabbat 21b Tertiary sources in the Jewish tradition make reference to this account.[52] Maimonides (12th century) described Hanukkah as follows: When, on the twenty-fifth of Kislev, the Jews had emerged victorious over their foes and destroyed them, they re-entered the Temple where they found only one jar of pure oil, enough to be lit for only a single day; yet they used it for lighting the required set of lamps for eight days, until they managed to press olives and produce pure oil. Because of this, the sages of that generation ruled that the eight days beginning with the twenty-fifth of Kislev should be observed as days of rejoicing and praising the Lord. Lamps are lit in the evening over the doors of the homes, on each of the eight nights, so as to display the miracle. These days are called Hanukkah, when it is forbidden to lament or to fast, just as it is on the days of Purim. Lighting the lamps during the eight days of Hanukkah is a religious duty imposed by the sages.[53] Some modern scholars, following the account in 2 Maccabees, observe that the king was intervening in an internal civil war between the Maccabean Jews and the Hellenized Jews in Jerusalem.[54][55][56][57] These competed violently over who would be the High Priest, with traditionalists with Hebrew/Aramaic names like Onias contesting with Hellenizing High Priests with Greek names like Jason and Menelaus.[58] In particular, Jason's Hellenistic reforms would prove to be a decisive factor leading to eventual conflict within the ranks of Judaism.[59] Other authors point to possible socioeconomic reasons in addition to the religious reasons behind the civil war.[60] What began in many respects as a civil war escalated when the Hellenistic kingdom of Syria sided with the Hellenizing Jews in their conflict with the traditionalists.[61] As the conflict escalated, Antiochus took the side of the Hellenizers by prohibiting the religious practices the traditionalists had rallied around. This may explain why the king, in a total departure from Seleucid practice in all other places and times, banned a traditional religion.[62] The miracle of the oil is widely regarded as a legend and its authenticity has been questioned since the Middle Ages.[63] However, given the famous question Joseph Karo (1488–1575) posed concerning why Hanukkah is celebrated for eight days when the miracle was only for seven days (since there was enough oil for one day),[64] it was clear that writing in the 16th century CE, he believed it to be a historical event. This belief has been adopted by most of Orthodox Judaism, in as much as Karo's Shulchan Aruch is a main code of Jewish Law. Selected battles between the Maccabees and the Seleucid Syrian-Greeks: Hanukkah is celebrated with a series of rituals that are performed every day throughout the eight-day holiday, some are family-based and others communal. There are special additions to the daily prayer service, and a section is added to the blessing after meals.[79] Hanukkah is not a \"Sabbath-like\" holiday, and there is no obligation to refrain from activities that are forbidden on the Sabbath, as specified in the Shulkhan Arukh.[80][81] Adherents go to work as usual but may leave early in order to be home to kindle the lights at nightfall. There is no religious reason for schools to be closed, although in Israel schools close from the second day for the whole week of Hanukkah.[82][83] Many families exchange gifts each night, such as books or games, and \"Hanukkah Gelt\" is often given to children. Fried foods—such as latkes (potato pancakes), jelly doughnuts (sufganiyot) and Sephardic bimuelos—are eaten to commemorate the importance of oil during the celebration of Hanukkah. Some also have a custom of eating dairy products to remember Judith and how she overcame Holofernes by feeding him cheese, which made him thirsty, and giving him wine to drink. When Holofernes became very drunk, Judith cut off his head.[84] Each night throughout the eight-day holiday, a candle or oil-based light is lit. As a universally practiced \"beautification\" (hiddur mitzvah) of the mitzvah, the number of lights lit is increased by one each night.[85] An extra light called a shammash, meaning \"attendant\" or \"sexton\",[86] is also lit each night, and is given a distinct location, usually higher, lower, or to the side of the others.[81] Among Ashkenazim the tendency is for every male member of the household (and in many families, girls as well) to light a full set of lights each night,[87][88] while among Sephardim the prevalent custom is to have one set of lights for the entire household.[89] The purpose of the shammash is to adhere to the prohibition, specified in the Talmud,[90] against using the Hanukkah lights for anything other than publicizing and meditating on the Hanukkah miracle. This differs from Sabbath candles which are meant to be used for illumination and lighting. Hence, if one were to need extra illumination on Hanukkah, the shammash candle would be available, and one would avoid using the prohibited lights. Some, especially Ashkenazim, light the shammash candle first and then use it to light the others.[91] So altogether, including the shammash, two lights are lit on the first night, three on the second and so on, ending with nine on the last night, for a total of 44 (36, excluding the shammash). It is Sephardic custom not to light the shammash first and use it to light the rest. Instead, the shammash candle is the last to be lit, and a different candle or a match is used to light all the candles. Some Hasidic Jews follow this Sephardic custom as well.[92] The lights can be candles or oil lamps.[91] Electric lights are sometimes used and are acceptable in places where open flame is not permitted, such as a hospital room, or for the very elderly and infirm; however, those who permit reciting a blessing over electric lamps only allow it if it is incandescent and battery operated (an incandescent flashlight would be acceptable for this purpose), while a blessing may not be recited over a plug-in menorah or lamp. Most Jewish homes have a special candelabrum referred to as either a Hanukkah menorah (the traditional name, menorah being Hebrew for 'lamp') or a Chanukiah (the modern Israeli term). Some families use an oil lamp menorah (traditionally filled with olive oil) for Hanukkah; like the candle version, it has eight wicks to light plus the additional shammash light.[93] In the United States, Hanukkah became a more visible festival in the public sphere from the 1970s when Rabbi Menachem M. Schneerson called for public awareness and observance of the festival and encouraged the lighting of public menorahs.[94][95][96][97] The reason for the Hanukkah lights is not for the \"lighting of the house within\", but rather for the \"illumination of the house without\", so that passersby should see it and be reminded of the holiday's miracle (i.e. that the sole cruse of pure oil found which held enough oil to burn for one night actually burned for eight nights). Accordingly, lamps are set up at a prominent window or near the door leading to the street. It is customary amongst some Ashkenazi Jews to have a separate menorah for each family member (customs vary), whereas most Sephardi Jews light one for the whole household. Only when there was danger of antisemitic persecution were lamps supposed to be hidden from public view, as was the case in Persia under the rule of the Zoroastrians,[26] or in parts of Europe before and during World War II. However, most Hasidic groups light lamps near an inside doorway, not necessarily in public view. According to this tradition, the lamps are placed on the opposite side from the mezuzah, so people passing through the door are surrounded by the holiness of mitzvot (the commandments).[98] Generally, women are exempt in Jewish law from time-bound positive commandments, although the Talmud requires that women engage in the mitzvah of lighting Hanukkah candles \"for they too were involved in the miracle.\"[99][100] Some Jews in North America and Israel have taken up environmental concerns in relation to Hanukkah's \"miracle of the oil\", emphasizing reflection on energy conservation and energy independence. An example of this is the Coalition on the Environment and Jewish Life's renewable energy campaign.[101][102][103] Hanukkah lights should usually burn for at least half an hour after it gets dark.[104] Many light at sundown, while most Hasidim and many other communities light later, generally around nightfall.[105] Many Hasidic Rebbes light much later to fulfill the obligation of publicizing the miracle by the presence of their Hasidim when they kindle the lights.[106] Inexpensive small wax candles sold for Hanukkah burn for approximately half an hour so should be lit no earlier than nightfall.[104] Friday night presents a problem, however. Since candles may not be lit on Shabbat itself, the candles must be lit before sunset.[104] However, they must remain lit through the lighting of the Shabbat candles. Therefore, the Hanukkah menorah is lit first with larger candles than usual,[104] followed by the Shabbat candles. At the end of the Shabbat, there are those who light the Hanukkah lights before Havdalah and those who make Havdalah before the lighting Hanukkah lights.[107] If for whatever reason one didn't light at sunset or nightfall, the lights should be kindled later, as long as there are people in the streets.[104] Later than that, the lights should still be kindled, but the blessings should be recited only if there is at least somebody else awake in the house and present at the lighting of the Hannukah lights.[108] Typically two blessings (brachot; singular: brachah) are recited during this eight-day festival when lighting the candles. On the first night only, the shehecheyanu blessing is added, making a total of three blessings.[109] The first blessing is recited before the candles are lit, and while most recite the other blessing(s) beforehand as well, some have the custom to recite them after. On the first night of Hanukkah one light (candle or oil) is lit on the right side of the menorah, on the following night a second light is placed to the left of the first but it is lit first, and so on, proceeding from placing candles right to left but lighting them from left to right over the eight nights.[110] Transliteration: Barukh ata Adonai Eloheinu, melekh ha'olam, asher kid'shanu b'mitzvotav v'tzivanu l'hadlik ner Hanukkah. Translation: \"Blessed are You, LORD our God, King of the universe, Who has sanctified us with His commandments and commanded us to kindle the Hanukkah light[s].\" Transliteration: Barukh ata Adonai Eloheinu, melekh ha'olam, she'asa nisim la'avoteinu ba'yamim ha'heim ba'z'man ha'ze. Translation: \"Blessed are You, LORD our God, King of the universe, Who performed miracles for our ancestors in those days at this time...\" After the lights are kindled the hymn Hanerot Halalu is recited. There are several different versions; the version presented here is recited in many Ashkenazic communities:[112] In the Ashkenazi tradition, each night after the lighting of the candles, the hymn Ma'oz Tzur is sung. The song contains six stanzas. The first and last deal with general themes of divine salvation, and the middle four deal with events of persecution in Jewish history, praising God for survival despite these tragedies (the exodus from Egypt, the Babylonian captivity, the miracle of the holiday of Purim, the Hasmonean victory) and expressing a longing for the days when Judea will finally triumph over Rome.[113] The song was composed in the thirteenth century by a poet only known through the acrostic found in the first letters of the original five stanzas of the song: Mordechai. The familiar tune is most probably a derivation of a German Protestant church hymn or a popular folk song.[114] After lighting the candles and Ma'oz Tzur, singing other Hanukkah songs is customary in many Jewish homes. Some Hasidic and Sephardi Jews recite Psalms, such as Psalm 30, Psalm 67, and Psalm 91. In North America and in Israel it is common to exchange presents or give children presents at this time. In addition, many families encourage their children to give tzedakah (charity) in lieu of presents for themselves.[115][116] \"We thank You also for the miraculous deeds and for the redemption and for the mighty deeds and the saving acts wrought by You, as well as for the wars which You waged for our ancestors in ancient days at this season. In the days of the Hasmonean Mattathias, son of Johanan the high priest, and his sons, when the iniquitous Greco-Syrian kingdom rose up against Your people Israel, to make them forget Your Torah and to turn them away from the ordinances of Your will, then You in your abundant mercy rose up for them in the time of their trouble, pled their cause, executed judgment, avenged their wrong, and delivered the strong into the hands of the weak, the many into the hands of few, the impure into the hands of the pure, the wicked into the hands of the righteous, and insolent ones into the hands of those occupied with Your Torah. Both unto Yourself did you make a great and holy name in Thy world, and unto Your people did You achieve a great deliverance and redemption. Whereupon your children entered the sanctuary of Your house, cleansed Your temple, purified Your sanctuary, kindled lights in Your holy courts, and appointed these eight days of Hanukkah in order to give thanks and praises unto Your holy name.\" An addition is made to the \"hoda'ah\" (thanksgiving) benediction in the Amidah (thrice-daily prayers), called Al HaNissim (\"On/about the Miracles\").[118] This addition refers to the victory achieved over the Syrians by the Hasmonean Mattathias and his sons.[119][120][26] The same prayer is added to the grace after meals. In addition, the Hallel (praise) Psalms[121] are sung during each morning service and the Tachanun penitential prayers are omitted.[119][122] The Torah is read every day in the shacharit morning services in synagogue, on the first day beginning from Numbers 6:22 (according to some customs, Numbers 7:1), and the last day ending with Numbers 8:4. Since Hanukkah lasts eight days it includes at least one, and sometimes two, Jewish Sabbaths (Saturdays). The weekly Torah portion for the first Sabbath is almost always Miketz, telling of Joseph's dream and his enslavement in Egypt. The Haftarah reading for the first Sabbath Hanukkah is Zechariah 2:14 – Zechariah 4:7. When there is a second Sabbath on Hanukkah, the Haftarah reading is from 1 Kings 7:40–50. The Hanukkah menorah is also kindled daily in the synagogue, at night with the blessings and in the morning without the blessings.[123] The menorah is not lit during Shabbat, but rather prior to the beginning of Shabbat as described above and not at all during the day. During the Middle Ages \"Megillat Antiochus\" was read in the Italian synagogues on Hanukkah just as the Book of Esther is read on Purim. It still forms part of the liturgy of the Yemenite Jews.[124] The last day of Hanukkah is known by some as Zot Hanukkah and by others as Chanukat HaMizbeach, from the verse read on this day in the synagogue Numbers 7:84, Zot Hanukkat Hamizbe'ach: \"This was the dedication of the altar\". According to the teachings of Kabbalah and Hasidism, this day is the final \"seal\" of the High Holiday season of Yom Kippur and is considered a time to repent out of love for God. In this spirit, many Hasidic Jews wish each other Gmar chatimah tovah (\"may you be sealed totally for good\"), a traditional greeting for the Yom Kippur season. It is taught in Hasidic and Kabbalistic literature that this day is particularly auspicious for the fulfillment of prayers.[125] It is customary for women not to work for at least the first half-hour of the candles' burning, and some have the custom not to work for the entire time of burning. It is also forbidden to fast or to eulogize during Hanukkah.[81] Some Hasidic scholars teach that the Hanukkah is in fact the final conclusion of God's judgment extending High Holy Days of Rosh Hashana when humanity is judged and Yom Kippur when the judgment is sealed: Hanukkah songs (in Hebrew except where indicated) include \"Ma'oz Tzur\" (Rock of Ages), \"Latke'le Latke'le\" (Yiddish: \"Little Latke, Little Latke\"), \"Hanukkiah Li Yesh\" (\"I Have a Hanukkah Menorah\"), \"Ocho Kandelikas\" (Judeo-Spanish: \"Eight Little Candles\"), \"Kad Katan\" (\"A Small Jug\"), \"S'vivon Sov Sov Sov\" (\"Dreidel, Spin and Spin\"), \"Haneirot Halolu\" (\"These Candles Which We Light\"), \"Mi Yimalel\" (\"Who Can Retell\") and \"Ner Li, Ner Li\" (\"I have a Candle\"). Among the best known songs in English-speaking countries are \"Dreidel, Dreidel, Dreidel\"[127] and \"Oh Chanukah\".[128] In the Nadvorna Hasidic dynasty, it is customary for the rebbes to play violin after the menorah is lit.[129] Penina Moise's Hannukah Hymn published in the 1842 Hymns Written for the Use of Hebrew Congregations was instrumental in the beginning of Americanization of Hanukkah.[130][131][132] There is a custom of eating foods fried or baked in oil (preferably olive oil) to commemorate the miracle of a small flask of oil keeping the Second Temple's Menorah alight for eight days.[133] Traditional foods include potato pancakes, known as latkes in Yiddish, especially among Ashkenazi families. Sephardi, Polish, and Israeli families eat jam-filled doughnuts (Yiddish: פּאָנטשקעס pontshkes), bimuelos (fritters) and sufganiyot which are deep-fried in oil. Italkim and Hungarian Jews traditionally eat cheese pancakes known as \"cassola\" or \"cheese latkes\".[134] Latkes are not popular in Israel, having been largely replaced by sufganiyot due to local economic factors, convenience and the influence of trade unions.[135] Bakeries in Israel have popularized many new types of fillings for sufganiyot besides the traditional strawberry jelly filling, including chocolate cream, vanilla cream, caramel, cappuccino and others.[136] In recent years, downsized, \"mini\" sufganiyot containing half the calories of the regular, 400-to-600-calorie version, have become popular.[137] Rabbinic literature also records a tradition of eating cheese and other dairy products during Hanukkah.[138] This custom, as mentioned above, commemorates the heroism of Judith during the Babylonian captivity of the Jews and reminds us that women also played an important role in the events of Hanukkah.[139] The deuterocanonical book of Judith (Yehudit or Yehudis in Hebrew), which is not part of the Tanakh, records that Holofernes, an Assyrian general, had surrounded the village of Bethulia as part of his campaign to conquer Judea. After intense fighting, the water supply of the Jews was cut off and the situation became desperate. Judith, a pious widow, told the city leaders that she had a plan to save the city. Judith went to the Assyrian camps and pretended to surrender. She met Holofernes, who was smitten by her beauty. She went back to his tent with him, where she plied him with cheese and wine. When he fell into a drunken sleep, Judith beheaded him and escaped from the camp, taking the severed head with her (the beheading of Holofernes by Judith has historically been a popular theme in art). When Holofernes' soldiers found his corpse, they were overcome with fear; the Jews, on the other hand, were emboldened and launched a successful counterattack. The town was saved, and the Assyrians defeated.[140] Roast goose has historically been a traditional Hanukkah food among Eastern European and American Jews, although the custom has declined in recent decades.[141] Indian Jews traditionally consume gulab jamun, fried dough balls soaked in a sweet syrup, similar to teiglach or bimuelos, as part of their Hanukkah celebrations. Italian Jews eat fried chicken, cassola (a ricotta cheese latke almost similar to a cheesecake), and fritelle de riso par Hanukkah (a fried sweet rice pancake). Romanian Jews eat pasta latkes as a traditional Hanukkah dish. Syrian Jews consume Kibbet Yatkeen, a dish made with pumpkin and bulgur wheat similar to latkes, as well as their own version of keftes de prasa spiced with allspice and cinnamon.[142] After lighting the candles, it is customary to play (or spin) the dreidel. The dreidel, or sevivon in Hebrew, is a four-sided spinning top that children play with during Hanukkah. Each side is imprinted with a Hebrew letter which is an abbreviation for the Hebrew words נס גדול היה שם (Nes Gadol Haya Sham, \"A great miracle happened there\"), referring to the miracle of the oil that took place in the Beit Hamikdash. The fourth side of some dreidels sold in Israel are inscribed with the letter פ (Pe), rendering the acronym נס גדול היה פה (Nes Gadol Haya Po, \"A great miracle happened here\"), referring to the fact that the miracle occurred in the land of Israel, although this is a relatively recent[when?] innovation. Stores in Haredi neighborhoods sell the traditional Shin dreidels as well, because they understand \"there\" to refer to the Temple and not the entire Land of Israel, and because the Hasidic Masters ascribe significance to the traditional letters.[143][144] Chanukkah gelt (Yiddish for \"Chanukkah money\"), known in Israel by the Hebrew translation Hebrew: דְּמֵי חֲנֻכָּה, romanized: dmei Hanukkah, is often distributed to children during the festival of Hanukkah. The giving of Hanukkah gelt also adds to the holiday excitement. The amount is usually in small coins, although grandparents or relatives may give larger sums. The tradition of giving Chanukah gelt dates back to a long-standing East European custom of children presenting their teachers with a small sum of money at this time of year as a token of gratitude. One minhag favors the fifth night of Hanukkah for giving Hanukkah gelt.[145] Unlike the other nights of Hanukkah, the fifth does not ever fall on the Shabbat, hence never conflicting with the Halachic injunction against handling money on the Shabbat.[146] The earliest Hanukkah link with the White House occurred in 1951 when Israeli Prime Minister David Ben-Gurion presented United States President Harry Truman with a Hanukkah menorah. In 1979 President Jimmy Carter took part in the first public Hanukkah candle-lighting ceremony of the National Menorah held across the White House lawn. In 1989, President George H. W. Bush displayed a menorah in the White House. In 1993, President Bill Clinton invited a group of schoolchildren to the Oval Office for a small ceremony.[95] The United States Postal Service has released several Hanukkah-themed postage stamps. In 1996, the United States Postal Service (USPS) issued a 32 cent Hanukkah stamp as a joint issue with Israel.[147] In 2004, after eight years of reissuing the menorah design, the USPS issued a dreidel design for the Hanukkah stamp. The dreidel design was used through 2008. In 2009 a Hanukkah stamp was issued with a design featured a photograph of a menorah with nine lit candles.[148] In 2008, President George W. Bush held an official Hanukkah reception in the White House where he linked the occasion to the 1951 gift by using that menorah for the ceremony, with a grandson of Ben-Gurion and a grandson of Truman lighting the candles.[149] In December 2014, two Hanukkah celebrations were held at the White House. The White House commissioned a menorah made by students at the Max Rayne school in Israel and invited two of its students to join U.S. President Barack Obama and First Lady Michelle Obama as they welcomed over 500 guests to the celebration. The students' school in Israel had been subjected to arson by extremists. President Obama said these \"students teach us an important lesson for this time in our history. The light of hope must outlast the fires of hate. That's what the Hanukkah story teaches us. It's what our young people can teach us – that one act of faith can make a miracle, that love is stronger than hate, that peace can triumph over conflict.\"[150] Rabbi Angela Warnick Buchdahl, in leading prayers at the ceremony commented on the how special the scene was, asking the President if he believed America's founding fathers could possibly have pictured that a female Asian-American rabbi would one day be at the White House leading Jewish prayers in front of the African-American president.[151] The dates of Hanukkah are determined by the Hebrew calendar. Hanukkah begins at the 25th day of Kislev and concludes on the second or third day of Tevet (Kislev can have 29 or 30 days). The Jewish day begins at sunset. Hanukkah dates for recent and upcoming: In 2013, on 28 November, the American holiday of Thanksgiving fell during Hanukkah for only the third time since Thanksgiving was declared a national holiday by President Abraham Lincoln. The last time was 1899, and due to the nature of the Gregorian and Jewish calendars being slightly out of sync with each other, it will not happen again in the foreseeable future.[152] This rare convergence prompted the creation of the neologism Thanksgivukkah.[153][154][155] Major Jewish holidays are those when all forms of work are forbidden, and that feature traditional holiday meals, kiddush, holiday candle-lighting, etc. Only biblical holidays fit these criteria, and Chanukah was instituted some two centuries after the Hebrew Bible was completed. Nevertheless, though Chanukah is of rabbinic origin, it is traditionally celebrated in a major and very public fashion. The requirement to position the menorah, or Chanukiah, at the door or window, symbolizes the desire to give the Chanukah miracle a high-profile.[156] Moreover, Hallel (a set of Psalms expressing praise that is recited on significant Jewish holidays) is recited on all eight days of Hanukkah, which signifies Hanukkah's importance on the Jewish calendar. While not considered the most significant holiday, the recitation of Hallel on Hanukkah highlights its importance in Jewish tradition.[157] Some Jewish historians suggest a different explanation for the rabbinic reluctance to laud the militarism.[clarification needed] First, the rabbis wrote after Hasmonean leaders had led Judea into Rome's grip and so may not have wanted to offer the family much praise. Second, they clearly wanted to promote a sense of dependence on God, urging Jews to look toward the divine for protection. They likely feared inciting Jews to another revolt that might end in disaster, as the Bar Kochba revolt did.[158] \"Hanukkah is an ancient holiday, but a modest one. The holiday of the Hasmoneans is new, yet it is full of spiritual exaltation and national joy. What was Hanukkah forty years ago? 'Al ha-nissim' and Hallel; a short reading in the synagogue; lighting the tiny, slender wax candles or oil lights; at home, levivot [latkes-potato pancakes], cards for the older children, and sevivonim [dreidels-spinning tops] for the little ones. But what is Hanukkah today? The holiday of the Hasmoneans. A holiday of salvation. A great national holiday, celebrated in all the countries of the Diaspora with dances and speeches, melody and song, outings and parades, as if a new soul has been breathed into the ancient holiday, another spirit renewed within it. One thing is clear: if those tiny, modest candles had been extinguished in Diaspora times, if our grandparents had not preserved the traditions of Hanukkah in the synagogue and at home . .., the holiday of the Hasmoneans could never have been created. There would have been nothing to change, nothing to renew. The new soul of our times would not have found a body in which to envelop itself.\" The emergence of Jewish nationalism and the Zionist movement in the late 19th and early 20th centuries had a profound impact on the celebration and reinterpretation of Jewish holidays. These developments resulted in increased emphasis on certain Jewish celebrations, of which Hanukkah and Tu BiShvat are prominent examples.[161] Hanukkah took on renewed meaning following the rise of Jewish nationalism as a nationalist holiday, symbolizing the struggle of the Jewish people against foreign oppression and their desire for national re-creation [162] (although the struggle of Jews against foreign oppression has always been a core componant of Hanukkah, as shown by the Al HaNissim, which has been part of Jewish liturgy since at least 700 CE).[163] Hanukkah served as a common ground where both religious and secular Zionists could unite around their nationalist agenda. Rabbi Shmuel Mohilever, an early religious Zionist, proposed making Hanukkah the official holiday of the proto-Zionist organization Hovevei Zion in Russia in 1881. Public celebrations of Hanukkah gained prominence in the early 20th century, with parades and public events becoming common. Schools in Mandate Palestine played an early role in promoting these celebrations.[164] With the advent of Zionism and the state of Israel, the themes of militarism were reconsidered. In modern Israel, the national and military aspects of Hanukkah became, once again, more dominant.[165][166] In North America, Hanukkah in the 21st century has taken a place equal to Passover as a symbol of Jewish identity. Both the Israeli and North American versions of Hanukkah emphasize resistance, focusing on some combination of national liberation and religious freedom as the defining meaning of the holiday.[167][8] Diane Ashton attributed the increased visibility and reinvention of Hanukkah by some of the American Jewish community as a way to adapt to American life, re-inventing the festival in \"the language of individualism and personal conscience derived from both Protestantism and the Enlightenment\".[130] In North America, Hanukkah became increasingly important to many Jewish individuals and families during the latter part of the 20th century, including a large number of secular Jews, who wanted to celebrate a Jewish alternative to the Christmas celebrations which frequently overlap with Hanukkah.[168][169] Diane Ashton argues that Jewish immigrants to America raised the profile of Hanukkah as a kid-centered alternative to Christmas as early as the 1800s.[170] This in parts mirrors the ascendancy of Christmas, which like Hanukkah increased in importance in the 1800s.[171] During this time period, Jewish leaders (especially Reform) such as Max Lilienthal and Isaac Mayer Wise made an effort to rebrand Hanukkah and started creating Hanukkah celebration for kids at their synagogues, which included candy and singing songs.[170][172] By the 1900s, it started to become a commercial holiday like Christmas, with Hanukkah gifts and decorations appearing in stores and Jewish Women's magazines printing articles on holiday decorations, children's celebrations, and gift giving.[170] Ashton says that Jewish families did this in order to maintain a Jewish identity which is distinct from mainline Christian culture, on the other hand, the mirroring of Hanukkah and Christmas made Jewish families and kids feel that they were American.[170] Though it was traditional for Ashkenazi Jews to give \"gelt\" or money to children during Hanukkah, in many families, this tradition has been supplemented with the giving of other gifts so that Jewish children can enjoy receiving gifts just like their Christmas-celebrating peers do.[173] Children play a big role in Hanukkah, and Jewish families with children are more likely to celebrate it than childless Jewish families, and sociologists hypothesize that this is because Jewish parents do not want their kids to be alienated from their non-Jewish peers who celebrate Christmas.[168] Recent celebrations have also seen the presence of the Hanukkah bush, which is considered a Jewish counterpart to the Christmas tree. Today, the presence of Hanukkah bushes is generally discouraged by most rabbis.[174] In December 2022, New York City Mayor Eric Adams, Reverends Al Sharpton and Conrad Tillard, businessman Robert F. Smith, Rabbi Shmuley Boteach, and Elisha Wiesel joined to celebrate Hanukkah and Kwanzaa together, and combat racism and antisemitism, at Carnegie Hall.[175][176][177][178]",

                "content": "The Jewish Festival of Lights is an eight-day celebration that commemorates the rededication of the Second Temple of Jerusalem. It is one of the most popular holidays in Judaism and is marked by the lighting of the menorah. For many English speakers, the festival is also known for confusion over the spelling of its name: Is it Hanukkah or Chanukah? The answer is that both are considered correct, though Hanukkah is the most widely used spelling, while Chanukah is more traditional. In addition, more than 20 other variations are recorded. Why so many spellings? Transliteration. Hebrew does not use the Latin alphabet, which is the standard script of many languages, including English. Thus, when used in an English context, the sounds of the different Hebrew characters must be converted, or transliterated, into Latin letters. However, the Hebrew word for the holiday uses sounds that aren’t found in the Latin alphabet. The difficulty begins with the very first letter of the word, which is the eighth letter of the Hebrew alphabet—ḥet, or chet. It is pronounced with a guttural sound that is similar to the /ch/ in loch. So, when the Hebrew word was transliterated in the 17th century, the ḥet became ch (Chanukah). However, when the English ch appears at the beginning of a word, it sounds quite different than the Hebrew ḥet (compare loch and chair). Thus, in the 18th century another spelling appeared—Hanukkah—even though the h doesn’t really sound like ḥet either. Transliteration issues also arose over the use of other letters—such as one or two k’s—resulting in many spelling variations.",

The festival gets its name from the row (avali) of clay lamps (deepa) that Indians light outside their homes to symbolize the inner light that protects from spiritual darkness. This festival is as important to Hindus as the Christmas holiday is to Christians. Over the centuries, Diwali has become a national festival that's also enjoyed by non-Hindu communities. For instance, in Jainism, Diwali marks the nirvana, or spiritual awakening, of Lord Mahavira on October 15, 527 B.C.; in Sikhism, it honors the day that Guru Hargobind Ji, the Sixth Sikh Guru, was freed from imprisonment. Buddhists in India celebrate Diwali as well. Diwali: Festival of Lights Hindus interpret the Diwali story based upon where they live.

Traditional Diwali (English: /dɪˈwɑːliː/), also called Deepavali (IAST: Dīpāvalī) or Deepawali (IAST: Dīpāwalī),[4] is the Hindu festival of lights, with variations celebrated in other Indian religions such as Jainism and Sikhism.[a] It symbolises the spiritual victory of Dharma over Adharma, light over darkness, good over evil, and knowledge over ignorance.[5][6][7][8] Diwali is celebrated during the Hindu lunisolar months of Ashvin (according to the amanta tradition) and Kārtika—between around mid-September and mid-November.[9][10][11][12][13] The celebrations generally last five or six days.[14][15] Diwali is connected to various religious events, deities and personalities, such as being the day Rama returned to his kingdom in Ayodhya with his wife Sita and his brother Lakshmana after defeating the demon king Ravana.[16] It is also widely associated with Lakshmi, the goddess of prosperity, and Ganesha, the god of wisdom and the remover of obstacles.[17] Other regional traditions connect the holiday to Vishnu, Krishna, Durga, Shiva, Kali, Hanuman, Kubera, Yama, Yami, Dhanvantari, or Vishvakarman. Primarily a Hindu festival, variations of Diwali are also celebrated by adherents of other faiths.[14] The Jains observe their own Diwali which marks the final liberation of Mahavira.[18][19] The Sikhs celebrate Bandi Chhor Divas to mark the release of Guru Hargobind from a Mughal prison.[20] Newar Buddhists, unlike other Buddhists, celebrate Diwali by worshipping Lakshmi, while the Hindus of Eastern India and Bangladesh generally, celebrate Diwali by worshipping the goddess Kali.[21][2][22] During the festival, the celebrants illuminate their homes, temples and workspaces with diyas (oil lamps), candles and lanterns.[8] Hindus, in particular, have a ritual oil bath at dawn on each day of the festival.[23] Diwali is also marked with fireworks as well as the decoration of floors with rangoli designs and other parts of the house with jhalars. Food is a major focus with families partaking in feasts and sharing mithai.[24] The festival is an annual homecoming and bonding period not only for families,[16][17] but also for communities and associations, particularly those in urban areas, which will organise activities, events, and gatherings.[25][26] Many towns organise community parades and fairs with parades or music and dance performances in parks.[27] Some Hindus, Jains, and Sikhs will send Diwali greeting cards to family near and far during the festive season, occasionally with boxes of Indian confectionery.[27] Another aspect of the festival is remembering the ancestors.[28] Diwali is also a major cultural event for the Hindu, Sikh, and Jain diaspora.[29][30][31] The main day of the festival of Diwali (the day of Lakshmi Puja) is an official holiday in Fiji,[32] Guyana,[33] India, Malaysia,[b][34] Mauritius, Myanmar,[35] Nepal,[36] Pakistan,[37] Singapore,[38] Sri Lanka, Suriname, Trinidad and Tobago[39] and in some US states.[40] Diwali (English: /dɪˈwɑːliː/)[9]—also known as Dewali, Divali,[4][41] or Deepavali (IAST: dīpāvalī)—comes from the Sanskrit dīpāvali meaning 'row or series of lights'.[24][42] The term is derived from the Sanskrit words dīpa, 'lamp, light, lantern, candle, that which glows, shines, illuminates or knowledge'[43] and āvali, 'a row, range, continuous line, series'.[44][c] The five-day celebration is observed every year sometime from the second half of October to the first half of November[45] coinciding with a new moon (amāvasyā) as per the Hindu lunisolar calendar.[46] The festivities begin two days before amāvasyā, on Dhanteras, and extend two days after, until the second (or 17th) day of the month of Kartik.[47] (According to Indologist Constance Jones, this night ends the lunar month of Ashwin and starts the month of Kartik[45] – but see this note[d] and Amanta and Purnima systems.) The darkest night is the apex of the celebration. The festival climax is on the third day and is called the main Diwali. It is an official holiday in a dozen countries, while the other festive days are regionally observed as either public or optional restricted holidays in India.[49] In Nepal, it is also a multiday festival, although the days and rituals are named differently, with the climax being called the Tihar festival by Hindus and Swanti festival by Buddhists.[50][51] The five-day long festival originated in the Indian subcontinent and is likely a fusion of harvest festivals in ancient India.[45] It is mentioned in early Sanskrit texts, such as the Padma Purana and the Skanda Purana, both of which were composed between the 7th and 10th centuries.[52][53] The diyas (lamps) are mentioned in Skanda Kishore Purana as symbolising parts of the sun, describing it as the cosmic giver of light and energy to all life and which seasonally transitions in the Hindu calendar month of Kartik.[54][55] Emperor Harsha refers to Deepavali, in the 7th-century Sanskrit play Nagananda, as Dīpapratipadotsava (dīpa = light, pratipadā = first day, utsava = festival), where lamps were lit and newly engaged brides and grooms received gifts.[56][57] Rajasekhara referred to Deepavali as Dipamalika in his 9th-century Kavyamimamsa, wherein he mentions the tradition of homes being whitewashed and oil lamps decorated homes, streets, and markets in the night.[56] Diwali was also described by numerous travellers from outside India. In his 11th-century memoir on India, the Persian traveller and historian Al Biruni wrote of Deepavali being celebrated by Hindus on the day of the New Moon in the month of Kartika.[58] The Venetian merchant and traveller Niccolò de' Conti visited India in the early 15th-century and wrote in his memoir, \"on another of these festivals they fix up within their temples, and on the outside of the roofs, an innumerable number of oil lamps... which are kept burning day and night\" and that the families would gather, \"clothe themselves in new garments\", sing, dance, and feast.[59][60] The 16th-century Portuguese traveller Domingo Paes wrote of his visit to the Hindu Vijayanagara Empire, where Dipavali was celebrated in October with householders illuminating their homes, and their temples, with lamps.[60] It is mentioned in the Ramayana that Diwali was celebrated for only 2 years in Ayodhya.[61] Islamic historians of the Delhi Sultanate and the Mughal Empire era also mentioned Diwali and other Hindu festivals. A few, notably the Mughal emperor Akbar, welcomed and participated in the festivities,[62][63] whereas others banned such festivals as Diwali and Holi, as Aurangzeb did in 1665.[64][65][e][f] Publications from the time of the British Raj also made mention of Diwali, such as the note on Hindu festivals published in 1799 by Sir William Jones, a philologist known for his early observations on Sanskrit and Indo-European languages.[68] In his paper on The Lunar Year of the Hindus, Jones, then based in Bengal, noted four of the five days of Diwali in the autumn months of Aswina-Cartica [sic] as the following: Bhutachaturdasi Yamaterpanam (2nd day), Lacshmipuja dipanwita (the day of Diwali), Dyuta pratipat Belipuja (4th day), and Bhratri dwitiya (5th day). The Lacshmipuja dipanwita, remarked Jones, was a \"great festival at night, in honour of Lakshmi, with illuminations on trees and houses\".[68][g] Sanskrit inscriptions in stone and copper mentioning Diwali, occasionally alongside terms such as Dipotsava, Dipavali, Divali and Divalige, have been discovered at numerous sites across India.[70][71][h] Examples include a 10th-century Rashtrakuta empire copper plate inscription of Krishna III (939–967 CE) that mentions Dipotsava,[72] and a 12th-century mixed Sanskrit-Kannada Sinda inscription discovered in the Isvara temple of Dharwad in Karnataka where the inscription refers to the festival as a \"sacred occasion\".[73] According to Lorenz Franz Kielhorn, a German Indologist known for translating many Indic inscriptions, this festival is mentioned as Dipotsavam in verses 6 and 7 of the Ranganatha temple Sanskrit inscription of the 13th-century Venad Hindu king Ravivarman Samgramadhira. Part of the inscription, as translated by Kielhorn, reads: \"the auspicious festival of lights which disperses the most profound darkness, which in former days was celebrated by the kings Ila, Kartavirya and Sagara, (...) as Sakra (Indra) is of the gods, the universal monarch who knows the duties by the three Vedas, afterwards celebrated here at Ranga for Vishnu, resplendent with Lakshmi resting on his radiant lap.\"[74][i] Jain inscriptions, such as the 10th-century Saundatti inscription about a donation of oil to Jinendra worship for the Diwali rituals, speak of Dipotsava.[75][76] Another early 13th-century Sanskrit stone inscription, written in the Devanagari script, has been found in the north end of a mosque pillar in Jalore, Rajasthan evidently built using materials from a demolished Jain temple. The inscription states that Ramachandracharya built and dedicated a drama performance hall, with a golden cupola, on Diwali.[77][78][j] The religious significance of Diwali varies regionally within India. One tradition links the festival to legends in the Hindu epic Ramayana, where Diwali is the day Rama, Sita, Lakshmana, and Hanuman reached Ayodhya after a period of 14 years in exile after Rama's army of good, defeated demon king Ravana's army of evil.[79] Throughout the epic, Rama's decisions were always in line with dharma (duty) and the Diwali festival serves as a reminder for followers of Hinduism to maintain their dharma in day-to-day life.[80] Per another popular tradition, in the Dvapara Yuga period, Krishna, an avatar of Vishnu, killed the demon Narakasura, who was the evil king of Pragjyotishapura, near present-day Assam, and released 16000 girls held captive by Narakasura. Diwali was celebrated as a signifier of triumph of good over evil after Krishna's Victory over Narakasura. The day before Diwali is remembered as Naraka Chaturdashi, the day on which Narakasura was killed by Krishna.[81] Many Hindus associate the festival with Goddess Lakshmi, the goddess of wealth and prosperity, and wife of Vishnu. According to Pintchman, the start of the 5-day Diwali festival is stated in some popular contemporary sources as the day goddess Lakshmi was born from Samudra Manthana, the churning of the cosmic ocean of milk by the Devas (gods) and the Asuras (demons) – a Vedic legend that is also found in several Puranas such as the Padma Purana, while the night of Diwali is when Lakshmi chose and wed Vishnu.[54][82] Along with Lakshmi, who is representative of Vaishnavism, Ganesha, the elephant-headed son of Parvati and Shiva of Shaivism tradition, is remembered as one who symbolises ethical beginnings and the remover of obstacles.[79] Hindus of eastern India associate the festival with the Goddess Kali, who symbolises the victory of good over evil.[83][84][85] Hindus from the Braj region in northern India, parts of Assam, as well as southern Tamil and Telugu communities view Diwali as the day the god Krishna overcame and destroyed the evil demon king Narakasura, in yet another symbolic victory of knowledge and good over ignorance and evil.[86][87] Trade and merchant families and others also offer prayers to Saraswati, who embodies music, literature and learning and Kubera, who symbolises book-keeping, treasury and wealth management.[54] In western states such as Gujarat, and certain northern Hindu communities of India, the festival of Diwali signifies the start of a new year.[86] Mythical tales shared on Diwali vary widely depending on region and even within Hindu tradition,[88] yet all share a common focus on righteousness, self-inquiry and the importance of knowledge,[89][90] which, according to Lindsey Harlan, an Indologist and scholar of Religious Studies, is the path to overcoming the \"darkness of ignorance\".[91] The telling of these myths is reminiscent of the Hindu belief that good ultimately triumphs over evil.[92][10] Originally a Hindu festival, Diwali has transcended religious lines.[93] Diwali is celebrated by Hindus, Jains, Sikhs, and Newar Buddhists,[2] although for each faith it marks different historical events and stories, but nonetheless the festival represents the same symbolic victory of light over darkness, knowledge over ignorance, and good over evil.[5][6][94][95] In Jain religion, Diwali is celebrated in observance of \"Mahavira Nirvana Divas\", the physical death and final nirvana of Mahavira, the 24th Tirthankar of current time cycle. Nirvana is considered to be the state of a soul when it escapes from the cycle of birth and death, while experiencing its true nature of boundless bliss and infinite knowledge.[96] The Jain Diwali celebrated in many parts of India has similar practices to the Hindu Diwali, such as the lighting of lamps. However, the focus of the Jain Diwali remains the dedication to Mahavira.[97] According to the Jain tradition, this practice of lighting lamps first began on the day of Mahavira's nirvana in 527 BCE,[k] when 18 kings who had gathered for Mahavira's final teachings issued a proclamation that lamps be lit in remembrance of the \"great light, Mahavira\".[100][101] This traditional belief of the origin of Diwali, and its significance to Jains, is reflected in their historic artworks such as paintings.[102] Sikhs celebrate Bandi Chhor Divas in remembrance of the release of Guru Hargobind from the Gwalior Fort prison by the Mughal emperor Jahangir and the day he arrived at the Golden Temple in Amritsar.[103] According to J.S. Grewal, a scholar of Sikhism and Sikh history, Diwali in the Sikh tradition is older than the sixth Guru Hargobind legend. Guru Amar Das, the third Guru of the Sikhs, built a well in Goindwal with eighty-four steps and invited Sikhs to bathe in its sacred waters on Baisakhi and Diwali as a form of community bonding. Over time, these spring and autumn festivals became the most important of Sikh festivals and holy sites such as Amritsar became focal points for annual pilgrimages.[104] The festival of Diwali, according to Ray Colledge, highlights three events in Sikh history: the founding of the city of Amritsar in 1577, the release of Guru Hargobind from the Mughal prison, and the day of Bhai Mani Singh's martyrdom in 1738 as a result of his failure to pay a fine for trying to celebrate Diwali and thereafter refusing to convert to Islam.[105][106][l] Diwali is not a festival for most Buddhists, with the exception of the Newar people of Nepal who revere various deities in Vajrayana Buddhism and celebrate Diwali by offering prayers to Lakshmi.[2][22] Newar Buddhists in Nepalese valleys also celebrate the Diwali festival over five days, in much the same way, and on the same days, as the Nepalese Hindu Diwali-Tihar festival.[109] According to some observers, this traditional celebration by Newar Buddhists in Nepal, through the worship of Lakshmi and Vishnu during Diwali, is not syncretism but rather a reflection of the freedom within Mahayana Buddhist tradition to worship any deity for their worldly betterment.[2] In the lead-up to Diwali, celebrants prepare by cleaning, renovating, and decorating their homes and workplaces with diyas (oil lamps) and rangolis (colourful art circle patterns).[111] During Diwali, people wear their finest clothes, illuminate the interior and exterior of their homes with saaki (earthen lamp), diyas and rangoli, perform worship ceremonies of Lakshmi, the goddess of prosperity and wealth,[m] light fireworks, and partake in family feasts, where mithai (sweets) and gifts are shared. The height of Diwali is celebrated on the third day coinciding with the darkest night of Ashvin or Kartika. The common celebratory practices are known as the festival of light, however there are minor differences from state to state in India. Diwali is usually celebrated twenty days after the Vijayadashami festival, with Dhanteras, or the regional equivalent, marking the first day of the festival when celebrants prepare by cleaning their homes and making decorations on the floor, such as rangolis.[113] Some regions of India start Diwali festivities the day before Dhanteras with Govatsa Dwadashi. The second day is Naraka Chaturdashi. The third day is the day of Lakshmi Puja and the darkest night of the traditional month. In some parts of India, the day after Lakshmi Puja is marked with the Govardhan Puja and Balipratipada (Padwa). Some Hindu communities mark the last day as Bhai Dooj or the regional equivalent, which is dedicated to the bond between sister and brother,[114] while other Hindu and Sikh craftsmen communities mark this day as Vishvakarma Puja and observe it by performing maintenance in their work spaces and offering prayers.[115][116] Rituals and preparations for Diwali begin days or weeks in advance, typically after the festival of Dusshera that precedes Diwali by about 20 days.[79] The festival formally begins two days before the night of Diwali and ends two days thereafter. Each day has the following rituals and significance:[54] Diwali has become more popular in other countries. In New York City lawmakers have passed legislation to make holidays in school. But debates over the holiday push back. In the future Diwali will be a holiday.[119] Dhanteras, also known as Dhanatrayodashi, is derived from Dhan meaning wealth and teras meaning thirteenth, marks the thirteenth day of the dark fortnight of Ashwin or Kartik and the beginning of Diwali in most parts of India.[120] On this day, many Hindus clean their homes and business premises. They install diyas, small earthen oil-filled lamps that they light up for the next five days, near Lakshmi and Ganesha iconography.[120][117] Women and children decorate doorways within homes and offices with rangolis, colourful designs made from rice flour, flower petals, coloured rice or coloured sand,[27] while the boys and men decorate the roofs and walls of family homes, markets, and temples and string up lights and lanterns. The day also marks a major shopping day for buying new utensils, home equipment, gold jewellery, firecrackers, and other items.[117][54][82][121] On the evening of Dhanteras, families offer prayers (puja) to Lakshmi and Ganesha, and lay offerings of puffed rice, candy toys, rice cakes and batashas (hollow sugar cakes).[117] According to Tracy Pintchman, Dhanteras is a symbol of annual renewal, cleansing and an auspicious beginning for the next year.[120] The term Dhan for this day also alludes to the Ayurvedic icon Dhanvantari, the god of health and healing, who is believed to have emerged from the \"churning of cosmic ocean\" on the same day as Lakshmi.[120] Some communities, particularly those active in Ayurvedic and health-related professions, pray or perform havan rituals to Dhanvantari on Dhanteras.[120] On Yama Deepam (also known as Yama Dipadana or Jam ke Diya), Hindus light a diya, ideally made of wheat flour and filled with sesame oil, which faces south in the back of their homes. This is believed to please Yama, the god of death, and to ward off untimely death.[122] Some Hindus observe Yama Deepam on the second night before the main day of Diwali.[123][124] Naraka Chaturdashi, also known as Chhoti Diwali, is the second day of festivities coinciding with the fourteenth day of the dark fortnight of Ashwin or Kartik.[125] The term \"chhoti\" means little, while \"Naraka\" means hell and \"Chaturdashi\" means \"fourteenth\".[126] The day and its rituals are interpreted as ways to liberate any soul from suffering in \"Naraka\", or hell, as well as a reminder of spiritual auspiciousness. For some Hindus, it is a day to pray for the peace to the manes, or defiled souls of one's ancestors and light their way for their journeys in the cyclic afterlife.[127] A mythological interpretation of this festive day is the destruction of the asura (demon) Narakasura by Krishna, a victory that frees 16,000 imprisoned princesses kidnapped by Narakasura.[126] It is also celebrated as Roop Chaudas in some North Indian households, where women bathe before sunrise, while lighting a diya (lamp) in the bath area, they believe it helps enhance their beauty – it is a fun ritual that young girls enjoy as part of festivities. Ubtan is applied by the women which is made up of special gram flour mixed with herbs for cleansing and beautifying themselves. Naraka Chaturdashi is also a major day for purchasing festive foods, particularly sweets. A variety of sweets are prepared using flour, semolina, rice, chickpea flour, dry fruit pieces powders or paste, milk solids (mawa or khoya) and clarified butter (ghee).[10] According to Goldstein, these are then shaped into various forms, such as laddus, barfis, halwa, kachoris, shrikhand, and sandesh, rolled and stuffed delicacies, such as karanji, shankarpali, maladu, susiyam, pottukadalai. Sometimes these are wrapped with edible silver foil (vark). Confectioners and shops create Diwali-themed decorative displays, selling these in large quantities, which are stocked for home celebrations to welcome guests and as gifts.[10][117] Families also prepare homemade delicacies for Lakshmi Pujan, regarded as the main day of Diwali.[10] Chhoti Diwali is also a day for visiting friends, business associates and relatives, and exchanging gifts.[117] On the second day of Diwali, Hanuman Puja is performed in some parts of India especially in Gujarat. It coincides with the day of Kali Chaudas. It is believed that spirits roam around on the night of Kali Chaudas, and Hanuman, who is the deity of strength, power, and protection, is worshipped to seek protection from the spirits. Diwali is also celebrated to mark the return of Rama to Ayodhya after defeating the demon-king Ravana[128] and completing his fourteen years of exile. The devotion and dedication of Hanuman pleased Rama so much that he blessed Hanuman to be worshipped before him. Thus, people worship Hanuman the day before Diwali's main day.[129] This day is commonly celebrated as Diwali in Tamil Nadu, Goa, and Karnataka.[citation needed] Traditionally, Marathi Hindus and South Indian Hindus receive an oil massage from the elders in the family on the day and then take a ritual bath, all before sunrise.[130] Many visit their favourite Hindu temple.[131] Some Hindus observe Yama Deepam (also known as Yama Dipadana or Jam ke Diya) on the second day of Diwali, instead of the first day. A diya that is filled with sesame oil is lit at back of their homes facing in the southern direction. This is believed to please Yama, the god of death, and to ward off untimely death.[122][123][124] The third day is the height of the festival[132] and coincides with the last day of the dark fortnight of Ashwin or Kartik. This is the day when Hindu, Jain and Sikh temples and homes are aglow with lights, thereby making it the \"festival of lights\". The word Deepawali comes from the Sanskrit word deep, which means an Indian lantern/lamp.[46][133] The youngest members in the family visit their elders, such as grandparents and other senior members of the community, on this day. Small business owners give gifts or special bonus payments to their employees between Dhanteras and Lakshmi Pujan.[130][134] Shops either do not open or close early on this day allowing employees to enjoy family time. Shopkeepers and small operations perform puja rituals in their office premises. Unlike some other festivals, the Hindus typically do not fast during the five-day long Diwali including Lakshmi Pujan, rather they feast and share the bounties of the season at their workplaces, community centres, temples, and homes.[130] As the evening approaches, celebrants will wear new clothes or their best outfits, teenage girls and women, in particular, wear saris and jewellery.[135] At dusk, family members gather for the Lakshmi Pujan,[135] although prayers will also be offered to other deities, such as Ganesha, Saraswati, Rama, Lakshmana, Sita, Hanuman, or Kubera.[54] The lamps from the puja ceremony are then used to light more earthenware lamps, which are placed in rows along the parapets of temples and houses,[136] while some diyas are set adrift on rivers and streams.[7][137][138] After the puja, people go outside and celebrate by lighting up patakhe (fireworks) together, and then share a family feast and mithai (sweets, desserts).[54] The puja and rituals in the Bengali Hindu community focus on Kali, the goddess of war, instead of Lakshmi.[112][139] According to Rachel Fell McDermott, a scholar of South Asian, particular Bengali, studies, in Bengal during Navaratri (Dussehra elsewhere in India) the Durga puja is the main focus, although in the eastern and northeastern states the two are synonymous, but on Diwali the focus is on the puja dedicated to Kali. These two festivals likely developed in tandem over their recent histories, states McDermott.[112] Textual evidence suggests that Bengali Hindus worshipped Lakshmi before the colonial era, and that the Kali puja is a more recent phenomenon.[n] Contemporary Bengali celebrations mirror those found elsewhere, with teenage boys playing with fireworks and the sharing of festive food with family, but with the Shakti goddess Kali as the focus.[140] On the night of Diwali, rituals across much of India are dedicated to Lakshmi to welcome her into their cleaned homes and bring prosperity and happiness for the coming year.[141][61] While the cleaning, or painting, of the home is in part for goddess Lakshmi, it also signifies the ritual \"reenactment of the cleansing, purifying action of the monsoon rains\" that would have concluded in most of the Indian subcontinent.[141] Vaishnava families recite Hindu legends of the victory of good over evil and the return of hope after despair on the Diwali night, where the main characters may include Rama, Krishna, Vamana or one of the avatars of Vishnu, the divine husband of Lakshmi.[141][142] At dusk, lamps placed earlier in the inside and outside of the home are lit up to welcome Lakshmi.[132] Family members light up firecrackers, which some interpret as a way to ward off all evil spirits and the inauspicious, as well as add to the festive mood.[143][144] According to Pintchman, who quotes Raghavan, this ritual may also be linked to the tradition in some communities of paying respect to ancestors. Earlier in the season's fortnight, some welcome the souls of their ancestors to join the family for the festivities with the Mahalaya. The Diwali night's lights and firecrackers, in this interpretation, represent a celebratory and symbolic farewell to the departed ancestral souls.[145] The celebrations and rituals of the Jains and the Sikhs are similar to those of the Hindus where social and community bonds are renewed. Major temples and homes are decorated with lights, festive foods shared with all, friends and relatives remembered and visited with gifts.[134][97] The day after Diwali is the first day of the bright fortnight of Kartik.[146] It is regionally called Annakut (heap of grain), Padwa, Goverdhan puja, Bali Pratipada, Bali Padyami, Kartik Shukla Pratipada and other names.[27][146] According to one tradition, the day is associated with the story of Bali's defeat at the hands of Vishnu.[147][148] In another interpretation, it is thought to reference the legend of Parvati and her husband Shiva playing a game of dyuta (dice) on a board of twelve squares and thirty pieces, Parvati wins. Shiva surrenders his shirt and adornments to her, rendering him naked.[146] According to Handelman and Shulman, as quoted by Pintchman, this legend is a Hindu metaphor for the cosmic process for creation and dissolution of the world through the masculine destructive power, as represented by Shiva, and the feminine procreative power, represented by Parvati, where twelve reflects the number of months in the cyclic year, while thirty are the number of days in its lunisolar month.[146] This day ritually celebrates the bond between the wife and husband,[149] and in some Hindu communities, husbands will celebrate this with gifts to their wives. In other regions, parents invite a newly married daughter, or son, together with their spouses to a festive meal and give them gifts.[149] In some rural communities of the north, west and central regions, the fourth day is celebrated as Govardhan puja, honouring the legend of the Hindu god Krishna saving the cowherd and farming communities from incessant rains and floods triggered by Indra's anger,[149] which he accomplished by lifting the Govardhan mountain. This legend is remembered through the ritual of building small mountain-like miniatures from cow dung.[149] According to Kinsley, the ritual use of cow dung, a common fertiliser, is an agricultural motif and a celebration of its significance to annual crop cycles.[118][150][151] The agricultural symbolism is also observed on this day by many Hindus as Annakut, literally \"mountain of food\". Communities prepare over one hundred dishes from a variety of ingredients, which is then dedicated to Krishna before being shared among the community. Hindu temples on this day prepare and present \"mountains of sweets\" to the faithful who have gathered for darshan (visit).[149] In Gujarat, Annakut is the first day of the new year and celebrated through the purchase of essentials, or sabras (literally, \"good things in life\"), such as salt, offering prayers to Krishna and visiting temples.[149] In Gujarat New Year is celebrated after the day of Diwali. In the early morning people take showers, do prayer at home, visit temples for worship and children in the evening visit neighbour's houses to say happy new year, shake hands, get mukhvas for dessert, and chocolate. The last day of the festival, the second day of the bright fortnight of Kartik, is called Bhai Duj (literally \"brother's day\"[152]), Bhau Beej, Bhai Tilak or Bhai Phonta. It celebrates the sister-brother bond, similar in spirit to Raksha Bandhan but it is the brother that travels to meet the sister and her family. This festive day is interpreted by some to symbolise Yama's sister Yamuna welcoming Yama with a tilaka, while others interpret it as the arrival of Krishna at his sister Subhadra's place after defeating Narakasura. Subhadra welcomes him with a tilaka on his forehead.[149][153] The day celebrates the sibling bond between brother and sister.[154] On this day the womenfolk of the family gather, perform a puja with prayers for the well-being of their brothers, then return to a ritual of feeding their brothers with their hands and receiving gifts. According to Pintchman, in some Hindu traditions the women recite tales where sisters protect their brothers from enemies that seek to cause him either bodily or spiritual harm.[153] In historic times, this was a day in autumn when brothers would travel to meet their sisters or invite their sister's family to their village to celebrate their sister-brother bond with the bounty of seasonal harvests.[54] The artisan Hindu and Sikh community celebrates the fourth day as the Vishwakarma puja day.[o] Vishwakarma is the presiding Hindu deity for those in architecture, building, manufacturing, textile work and crafts trades.[115] [p] The looms, tools of trade, machines and workplaces are cleaned and prayers offered to these livelihood means.[157] During the season of Diwali, numerous rural townships and villages host melas,[158] or fairs, where local producers and artisans trade produce and goods. A variety of entertainments are usually available for inhabitants of the local community to enjoy. The women, in particular, adorn themselves in colourful attire and decorate their hands with henna. Such events are also mentioned in Sikh historical records.[159][q] In the modern day, Diwali mela are held at college, or university, campuses or as community events by members of the Indian diaspora. At such events a variety of music, dance and arts performances, food, crafts, and cultural celebrations are featured.[160][161][91] Diwali marks a major shopping period in India,[29] and is comparable to the Christmas period in terms of consumer purchases and economic activity.[162] It is traditionally a time when households purchase new clothing, home refurbishments, gifts, gold, jewelry,[163][164] and other large purchases particularly as the festival is dedicated to Lakshmi, the goddess of wealth and prosperity, and such purchases are considered auspicious.[165][166] According to Rao, Diwali is one of the major festivals where rural Indians spend a significant portion of their annual income, and is a means for them to renew their relationships and social networks.[167] Other goods that are bought in substantial quantities during Diwali include confectionery and fireworks. In 2013, about ₹25 billion (US$290 million) of fireworks were sold to merchants for the Diwali season, an equivalent retail value of about ₹50 billion (US$590 million) according to The Times of India.[168][r] ASSOCHAM, a trade organisation in India, forecasted that online shopping alone to be over ₹300 billion (US$3.5 billion) over the 2017 Diwali season.[171] About two-thirds of Indian households, according to the ASSOCHAM forecast, would spend between ₹5,000 (US$59) and ₹10,000 (US$120) to celebrate Diwali in 2017.[172] Stock markets like NSE and BSE in India are typically closed during Diwali, with the exception of a Diwali Muhurat trading session for an hour in the evening to coincide with the beginning of the new year.[173] In 2020, the INDF ETF was launched to mark the start of Diwali.[174] Diwali has increasingly attracted cultural exchanges, becoming occasions for politicians and religious leaders worldwide to meet Hindu or Indian origin citizens, diplomatic staff or neighbours. Many participate in other socio-political events as a symbol of support for diversity and inclusiveness. The Catholic dicastery Pontifical Council for Interreligious Dialogue, founded as Secretariat for non-Christians by Pope Paul VI, began sending official greetings and the Pope's message to the Hindus on Diwali in the mid-1990s.[175][s] Many governments encourage or sponsor Diwali-related festivities in their territories. For example, the Singaporean government, in association with the Hindu Endowments Board of Singapore, organises many cultural events during Diwali every year.[176] National and civic leaders such as the former Prince Charles have attended Diwali celebrations at prominent Hindu temples in the UK, such as the Swaminarayan Temple in Neasden, using the occasion to highlight contributions of the Hindu community to British society.[177][178] Additionally, cities across the UK show support of the celebrations through Diwali lights, decorations, and cultural festivities such as dance performances, food stalls and workshops.[179] Since 2009, Diwali has been celebrated every year at 10 Downing Street, the residence of the British Prime Minister.[180] Diwali was first celebrated in the White House by George W. Bush in 2003, and its religious and historical significance was officially recognized by the United States Congress in 2007.[181][182] Barack Obama became the first president to personally attend Diwali at the White House in 2009. On the eve of his first visit to India as President of the United States, Obama released an official statement sharing his best wishes with \"those celebrating Diwali\".[183] Every year during Diwali, Indian forces approach their Pakistani counterparts at the border bearing gifts of traditional Indian confectionery, a gesture that is returned in kind by the Pakistani soldiers who give Pakistani sweets to the Indian soldiers.[184][t][188] The use of firecrackers on Diwali increases the concentration of dust and pollutants in the air. After firing, the fine dust particles get settled on the surrounding surfaces which are packed with chemicals like copper, zinc, sodium, lead, magnesium, cadmium and pollutants like oxides of sulfur and nitrogen.[189] These invisible yet harmful particles affect the environment and in turn, put people's health at stake.[190] The smoke created by firecrackers lit up on Diwali causes smog which sometimes takes days to clear.[191] During Diwali, the levels of suspended particulate matter increase. When people are exposed to these pollutant particles, they may suffer from eye, nose, and throat-related problems. To produce colours when crackers are burst, carcinogenic and poisonous elements are used.[192] During the 2023 celebration, New Delhi briefly took the top spot in the world for air pollution with an air quality index of 680 on one night.[193] The use of fireworks during Diwali can also lead to burn injuries. One particular firework called anar (fountain) has been found to be responsible for 65% of such injuries, with adults being the typical victims. Most of the injuries sustained are Group I type burns (minor) requiring only outpatient care. Experts urge precaution around candles and fires and ask for children to be kept a safe distance from flames and to enjoy the festivity of Diwali.[194][195] In 2023, a Diwali celebration in Ayodhya, Uttar Pradesh, India, broke the Guinness World Record for the largest display of oil lamps with 2,223,676 displayed on the eve of Diwali.[196] (federal) = federal holidays, (abbreviation) = state/territorial holidays, (religious) = religious holidays, (cultural) = holiday related to a specific racial/ethnic group or sexual minority, (week) = week-long holidays, (month) = month-long holidays, (36) = Title 36 Observances and Ceremonies",

The Festival of Lights has been a Christmas tradition of the Washington DC Temple for 47 years. This year, on December 3rd, Elder Neil L. Andersen and Mongolian Ambassador to the U.S. Batbayar Ulziidelger ceremoniously lit the grounds together, beginning the Festival of Lights at the temple. Read the full story from this year’s lighting ceremony here. On November 28, 2023, for the 46th Annual Festival of Lights, three representatives of different organizations illuminated the temple grounds together. Elder Dale G. Renlund of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles, Mr. Jaime Ramon T. Ascalon, Jr., the Philippines Embassy Deputy Chief of Mission, and Mrs. Maria Lourdes M. Romualdez, wife of Jose Manuel G. Romauldez, Philippine ambassador to the United States, joined together and ceremoniously pushed a button, lighting the temple grounds from inside the visitors’ center. At the lighting ceremony, they were also joined by David Marriot, and his parents, J.W. and Donna Marriot. Read the full story from last year’s lighting ceremony here. Loved it! It was good.

Lasting eight days, Hanukkah usually occurs during December, but sometimes begins in November. This Jewish holiday is known as the Festival of Lights, commemorating the rededication of the Temple in Jerusalem in 164 B.C. after three years of war. Hanukkah means \"dedication.\" Jerusalem at the time was part of the Hellenistic empire and was ruled by Antiochus IV. His government instituted a different religion from Judaism. When the Temple became a site of sacrifices and icons, the people resisted, sparking three years of fierce rebellion. The Maccabees led the rebellion and were triumphant in 164 B.C. When they returned to Temple, they found that the Lamp of Eternal Light was gone. A simple menorah was constructed, but they could only find a small cruse of oil. With only enough oil to light the lamp for one night, the Maccabees sent for more oil to be prepared. Miraculously, the oil lasted eight nights until more oil could be delivered. Hanukkah is celebrated over eight evenings and includes a symbolic lighting of the menorah each evening. Families have many traditions for this holiday, including family gatherings, meals, games, and the exchange of gifts. Visit the library to find out more. Happy Hanukkah!

                "content": "Morgan Cole Wallen (born May 13, 1993) is an American country singer. He competed in the sixth season of The Voice, originally as a member of Usher's team, but later as a member of Adam Levine's team. After being eliminated in the playoffs of that season, he signed to Panacea Records, releasing his debut EP, Stand Alone, in 2015. In 2016, Wallen signed to Big Loud, releasing his debut album, If I Know Me, in 2018. The album includes the singles \"Up Down\" featuring Florida Georgia Line, \"Whiskey Glasses\", and \"Chasin' You\". If I Know Me reached No. 1 on the Billboard Top Country Albums chart. Wallen's second album, Dangerous: The Double Album, was released in January 2021, and in February 2021 became the only country album in the 64-year history of the Billboard 200 to spend its first seven weeks at No. 1.[4] It spent its first ten weeks at number one, the first album to do so since Whitney Houston's Whitney in 1987.[5] The album included singles \"More Than My Hometown\", \"7 Summers\", and \"Wasted on You\".[6] His third studio album, One Thing at a Time (2023), topped the Billboard 200 for 19 non-consecutive weeks, with all of its 36 tracks entering the Billboard Hot 100. This broke the record for most songs by an artist on the chart at one time.[7] The single \"Last Night\" peaked atop the Hot 100 in 2023, becoming Wallen's first single to do so, and later set the record for the most weeks at number one for a non-collaboration song (sixteen weeks), as well as tying for the second most weeks of all time and topping the year-end chart. He has received several awards including an Academy of Country Music Award and fourteen Billboard Music Awards.[8] He won Entertainer of the Year at the 58th Annual Country Music Association Awards.[9] Morgan Cole Wallen was born on May 13, 1993, in Sneedville, Tennessee, to Tommy and Lesli Wallen.[10] Tommy served for a time as a local church pastor,[11] while Lesli worked as a teacher. In his teens, the family moved south to Knox County, where he graduated from Gibbs High School.[12] He was a pitcher and shortstop for the school's baseball team, and hoped to continue in college, but tore his ulnar collateral ligament his senior year.[13] As a child, Wallen took piano and violin lessons. He was raised on a diverse musical playlist, with his father exposing him to classic rock mainstays. In his teens, he gravitated towards bands like Breaking Benjamin and Nickelback, as well as rappers like Lil Wayne.[14] Wallen has characterized his early adulthood as adrift; he worked in landscaping after high school and was disappointed by his inability to continue his baseball career.[11] He re-approached his interest in music and began learning guitar.[14] He had grown to love country music, especially artists like Keith Whitley and Eric Church, and he modeled his sound after that lineage.[14] In 2014, Wallen competed on season 6 of the music competition program The Voice. He auditioned with the song \"Collide\" by Howie Day. Judges Shakira and Usher complimented his stylings, and Wallen joined Usher's team. He was later taken by Adam Levine's team after his second round, and later eliminated during the playoffs.[13] Wallen later said of his experience on the show, \"Some things in life are out of your control. Being the best you can be isn't. I didn't feel like I was the best I could have been. So I practiced harder\".[14] The Voice was instrumental in raising Wallen's profile, and he began to establish connections in the music industry.[12] While in California to appear on The Voice, Wallen began working with Sergio Sanchez of Atom Smash, a vocal coach on the program. Wallen relocated to Nashville to further his career, and he and Sanchez started a temporary band: Morgan Wallen & Them Shadows.[12] Sanchez introduced Wallen to Bill Ray and Paul Trust of Panacea Records.[15] In 2015, Wallen signed to Panacea Records where he was joined by Dominic Frost on guitar and released the Stand Alone (EP) on August 24, 2015. \"Spin You Around\" was Wallen's debut single under Panacea Records; it was later certified double platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) in 2021.[16] In 2015, Wallen's manager, Dirk Hemsath of Working Group Artist Management, sent a demo of Wallen to record executive Seth England, who had Wallen audition for Big Loud, an independent record label. They signed Wallen to the label and the publishing company,[15] who began pairing his songs with other artists. That year, he released his debut single \"The Way I Talk\";[17] his first music video for the song followed in 2017.[18] Wallen co-wrote the A Thousand Horses's single \"Preachin' to the Choir\",[13] Dallas Smith's \"The Fall\",[19] as well as Jason Aldean's \"You Make It Easy\" with Florida Georgia Line's Tyler Hubbard, Brian Kelley, and Jordan Schmidt.[20] He joined Florida Georgia Line on their Dig Your Roots Tour.[13] He collaborated with the group on the single \"Up Down\", his first song to reach the top five of Billboard's Hot Country Songs chart.[21] At the outset of his career, Wallen underwent a personal stylistic shift, adopting a distinctive mullet and a look that Kelefa Sanneh, profiling Wallen's rise in a piece for The New Yorker, described as \"Everyman rock star\" and \"not just a singer but a character\".[11] Wallen had decided to adopt the retro hairdo after seeing a younger photo of his father with the cut.[14] Wallen's debut studio album, If I Know Me, was released on April 27, 2018,[22] with its third single, \"Whiskey Glasses\", becoming his biggest success yet.[23] The song reached the top spot on both the Hot Country Songs and Country Airplay charts; it also marked his top 40 appearance on the all-genre Hot 100 ranking, where it placed at number 17. It was Billboard's 2019 top Hot Country song and Top Country Airplay song.[24] Sanneh characterized \"Whiskey Glasses\" as his signature song and a \"perfectly constructed ode to a woman and a drink, lost and found, respectively\".[11] In 2019, Wallen joined Florida Georgia Line on their Can't Say I Ain't Country Tour.[25] His next single, \"Chasin' You\", was serviced to radio in July 2019 and peaked at number two on the Hot Country Songs chart;[26][6] like its predecessor, it captured the top spot on the overall year-end tally for 2020.[14] In August 2020, If I Know Me reached No. 1 on the Top Country Albums chart after a record-breaking 114 weeks. Wallen's profile continued to rise, with a growing following on platforms like TikTok, and he developed into an unwitting sex symbol.[11] Wallen appeared on the cover of Billboard, whose headline read: \"Is Morgan Wallen Country's Next Global Star?\"[14] At the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, Wallen found himself with more time to write and record material, which developed into his sophomore album, the double-disc Dangerous: The Double Album (2021),[27] which showcases a mix of country and R&B/pop balladry.[12] Dangerous was an immediate blockbuster: it debuted atop the US Billboard 200 and the Canadian Albums Chart;[28][29] it would remain atop the Canadian chart for four consecutive weeks, and the US chart for six consecutive weeks, marking the first new album from a country artist to do that since Garth Brooks' The Chase in 1992.[30][31][32][33] The album also would become just the third album to spend its first ten weeks at number one on the Billboard 200 and the first in over 30 years, the last being Whitney by Whitney Houston.[34][35][36][37][38] Its singles—\"More Than My Hometown\", \"7 Summers\", \"Sand in My Boots\" and \"Wasted on You\"—were record-breaking hit songs that pushed Wallen farther into the national conversation. \"7 Summers\" earned him his first top 10 on the Hot 100, debuting and peaking at number six,[39] and was also chosen by Time as one of the best songs of the year.[40] Wallen soon became the first artist to ever chart six songs within the top 10 of Hot Country Songs chart at the same time in the week after his album's release;[41] likewise, the album charted 23 tracks on the Canadian Hot 100,[42] and 19 tracks on the Hot 100 in the US.[43] On February 2, 2021, TMZ released a video recorded on January 31 showing Wallen using the racial slur \"nigger\" to one of his friends after a night out.[44][45] He issued a statement shortly after and apologized.[46] Several radio stations temporarily removed Wallen's music from airplay on their stations, and his songs were removed from Apple Music, Pandora and Spotify featured playlists.[47][48] CMT and the Country Music Association removed Wallen's appearances from their platforms, and his record label Big Loud (and partner Republic Records) suspended its recording contract with him indefinitely.[49][50] The Academy of Country Music announced that Wallen and the album Dangerous: The Double Album would be ineligible for the 56th Annual Academy of Country Music Awards.[51][52] On February 10, Wallen shot an apology video in which he asked his fans not to defend him.[53] In April 2021, Wallen donated $300,000 to the Black Music Action Coalition in the names of 20 people who had counseled him following the incident. Those individuals were given the option to funnel their respective $15,000 donations to a charity of their choice, or keep the money within the BMAC.[54] Wallen publicly spoke of his comments on Good Morning America on July 23, where he said that \"he was around some of his friends, and they say dumb stuff together\" and said that \"he was wrong\" to express those words.[55] Wallen's songs returned to country radio in August when his single \"Sand in My Boots\" was released.[56] He was nominated for Favorite Male Country Artist and Favorite Country Album for the 2021 American Music Awards, but was not invited to attend the ceremony, and was consequently unable to accept any awards if he won, which he did not.[57] Though his public image took a hit, Wallen’s popularity increased.[58] In the week following the controversy, album sales of Dangerous surged. In some cases, the physical as well as digital album sales went up over 100% in the week following the controversy.[59] He remained atop the Billboard charts for seven more weeks; If I Know Me even entered the top 10 for the first time.[60] Over the ensuing years, Dangerous remained a juggernaut; Ben Sisario, writing in The New York Times, dubbed it \"an unusually enduring hit\".[61] It has continued to break chart records:[30] it was the best-performing album of 2021,[62] and in 2022, the album broke the record for the most weeks in the top 10 on the Billboard 200 chart among albums by a singular artist, surpassing a goal set a half-century before.[63] Dangerous was awarded Album of the Year at the Academy of Country Music;[64] Wallen also won Favorite Male Artist and Favorite Album at the inaugural Country Now Awards.[65] Wallen has continued to release new music, and has remained a popular draw on the road. The Dangerous Tour of arenas and amphitheaters was completely sold-out.[62][66] His single \"You Proof\" became his second Hot 100 hit and first to reach the top five; both \"You Proof\" and \"Thought You Should Know\" topped the country charts. Wallen also collaborated with rapper Lil Durk on the song \"Broadway Girls\", a top-15 hit on the Hot 100; he also performed the song live with Durk at MLK Freedom Fest in Nashville.[67] Wallen was a co-writer on the Tyler Joe Miller single \"Wild as Her\", released in February 2022, and the Keith Urban single \"Brown Eyes Baby, released in July 2022.[68][69] In December 2022, Wallen released a sampler EP titled One Thing at a Time, featuring three songs he had been working on up until this point, titled \"One Thing at a Time\", \"Tennessee Fan\" and \"Days That End in Why\".[70] In 2023, Wallen expanded to stadiums with his One Night at a Time World Tour.[71] Wallen released his third studio album One Thing at a Time on March 3, 2023.[72] On April 23, 2023, at Vaught–Hemingway Stadium in Oxford, Mississippi, just minutes before he was set to perform, Wallen announced that he could not perform due to losing his voice. Fans were directed to receive refunds at their points of purchase.[73] In May 2023, Wallen was featured on the song \"Stand by Me\" from Lil Durk's eighth studio album, Almost Healed. Wallen was a co-writer on the 2023 single \"Fixer Upper\" by Dallas Smith.[74][75] On January 26, 2024, Panacea Records released a deluxe 10th anniversary edition of Morgan Wallen's 2015 EP Stand Alone that included eight previously unreleased songs. These songs were recorded in the same sessions as the original Stand Alone songs. Before the release of the 10th anniversary album, Wallen released a statement on his Instagram page saying that the release of this album was happening \"against his wishes\".[76] Wallen released \"Spin You Around (1/24)\", an acoustic re-recording of the original, in response to the album's release.[77] On March 3, 2024, he shared performances as part of his Abbey Road Sessions and performed a new song titled \"Lies Lies Lies\".[78] On May 2, 2024, Wallen announced his next single entitled \"I Had Some Help\" with Post Malone, which was released on May 10.[79] Wallen was featured on the Moneybagg Yo single \"Whiskey Whiskey\". In September 2024, Wallen announced his second single from his upcoming fourth studio album, \"Love Somebody\", which was released on October 18.[80] It debuted at No. 1 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart.[81] Wallen was nominated for seven awards at the 58th Annual Country Music Association Awards, with his only win being the prestigious Entertainer of the Year award. Wallen was not in attendance to accept and the presenter, Jeff Bridges, jokingly accepted on his behalf.[82] In 2016, Wallen began a relationship with influencer KT Smith, and the couple got engaged several months later.[83][84] In 2019, they separated, allegedly due to Wallen's infidelity, and welcomed a son, Indigo (b. 2020), together several months after their breakup.[85][86][84] Smith is now married to another man.[84] Wallen has also been romantically linked with influencer Paige Lorenze,[87] and fellow country singer Megan Moroney, who allegedly wrote her breakout song \"Tennessee Orange\" about him.[88][89][90] On June 1, 2024, Wallen opened Morgan Wallen's This Bar & Tennessee Kitchen, a six-story bar, restaurant and music venue, in downtown Nashville.[91] In May 2020, Wallen was arrested and charged with public intoxication and disorderly conduct after leaving Kid Rock's bar in Nashville after reportedly kicking glass items inside the bar when he was told to leave, as well as getting into multiple verbal altercations with passersby outside.[92] The case was settled in a court hearing.[93] In October 2020, during the COVID-19 pandemic, multiple videos were posted on TikTok showing Wallen ignoring CDC guidelines in bars and other locations in the Tuscaloosa, Alabama, area after attending a University of Alabama football game. As a result of this, Wallen was cancelled as the musical guest on that week's episode of Saturday Night Live; he ultimately performed in an episode two months later hosted by actor Jason Bateman, in which Bateman, Wallen, and several cast members parody the incident and resulting fallout.[94][95][96][97] On April 7, 2024, Wallen was arrested after allegedly throwing a chair off the roof of Eric Church's newly-opened bar on Broadway in Nashville, Chief's. He was charged with three counts of felony reckless endangerment and one count of misdemeanor disorderly conduct after the projectile landed near two police officers on the ground.[98] In December 2024, Wallen pled guilty to two misdemeanor counts of reckless endangerment, with the other two charges being dismissed, and was sentenced to serve seven days in a DUI education center, and two consecutive years of supervised probation.[99] Headlining Opening",

The interrelationships of ethnicity, language and culture in the Celtic world are unclear and debated;[8] for example over the ways in which the Iron Age people of Britain and Ireland should be called Celts.[5][8][9][10] In current scholarship, 'Celt' primarily refers to 'speakers of Celtic languages' rather than to a single ethnic group.[11] The history of pre-Celtic Europe and Celtic origins is debated. The traditional \"Celtic from the East\" theory, says the proto-Celtic language arose in the late Bronze Age Urnfield culture of central Europe, named after grave sites in southern Germany,[12][13] which flourished from around 1200 BC.[14] This theory links the Celts with the Iron Age Hallstatt culture which followed it (c. 1200–500 BC), named for the rich grave finds in Hallstatt, Austria,[14][15] and with the following La Tène culture (c. 450 BC onward), named after the La Tène site in Switzerland. It proposes that Celtic culture spread westward and southward from these areas by diffusion or migration.[16] A newer theory, \"Celtic from the West\", suggests proto-Celtic arose earlier, was a lingua franca in the Atlantic Bronze Age coastal zone, and spread eastward.[17] Another newer theory, \"Celtic from the Centre\", suggests proto-Celtic arose between these two zones, in Bronze Age Gaul, then spread in various directions.[11] After the Celtic settlement of Southeast Europe in the 3rd century BC, Celtic culture reached as far east as central Anatolia, Turkey. The earliest undisputed examples of Celtic language are the Lepontic inscriptions from the 6th century BC.[18] Continental Celtic languages are attested almost exclusively through inscriptions and place-names. Insular Celtic languages are attested from the 4th century AD in Ogham inscriptions, though they were being spoken much earlier. Celtic literary tradition begins with Old Irish texts around the 8th century AD. Elements of Celtic mythology are recorded in early Irish and early Welsh literature. Most written evidence of the early Celts comes from Greco-Roman writers, who often grouped the Celts as barbarian tribes. They followed an ancient Celtic religion overseen by druids. The Celts were often in conflict with the Romans, such as in the Roman–Gallic wars, the Celtiberian Wars, the conquest of Gaul and conquest of Britain. By the 1st century AD, most Celtic territories had become part of the Roman Empire. By c. 500, due to Romanisation and the migration of Germanic tribes, Celtic culture had mostly become restricted to Ireland, western and northern Britain, and Brittany. Between the 5th and 8th centuries, the Celtic-speaking communities in these Atlantic regions emerged as a reasonably cohesive cultural entity. They had a common linguistic, religious and artistic heritage that distinguished them from surrounding cultures.[19] Insular Celtic culture diversified into that of the Gaels (Irish, Scots and Manx) and the Celtic Britons (Welsh, Cornish, and Bretons) of the medieval and modern periods.[2][20][21] A modern Celtic identity[22] was constructed as part of the Romanticist Celtic Revival in Britain, Ireland, and other European territories such as Galicia.[23] Today, Irish, Scottish Gaelic, Welsh, and Breton are still spoken in parts of their former territories, while Cornish and Manx are undergoing a revival. The first recorded use of the name 'Celts' – as Κελτοί (Keltoi) in Ancient Greek – was by Greek geographer Hecataeus of Miletus in 517 BC,[24] when writing about a people living near Massilia (modern Marseille), southern Gaul.[25] In the fifth century BC, Herodotus referred to Keltoi living around the source of the Danube and in the far west of Europe.[26] The etymology of Keltoi is unclear. Possible roots include Indo-European *kʲel 'to hide' (seen also in Old Irish ceilid, and Modern Welsh celu), *kʲel 'to heat' or *kel 'to impel'.[27] It may come from the Celtic language. Linguist Kim McCone supports this view and notes that Celt- is found in the names of several ancient Gauls such as Celtillus, father of Vercingetorix. He suggests it meant the people or descendants of \"the hidden one\", noting the Gauls claimed descent from an underworld god (according to Commentarii de Bello Gallico), and linking it with the Germanic Hel.[28] Others view it as a name coined by Greeks; among them linguist Patrizia de Bernardo Stempel, who suggests it meant \"the tall ones\".[29] In the first century BC, Roman leader Julius Caesar reported that the Gauls called themselves 'Celts', Latin: Celtae, in their own tongue.[30] Thus whether it was given to them by others or not, it was used by the Celts themselves. Greek geographer Strabo, writing about Gaul towards the end of the first century BC, refers to the \"race which is now called both Gallic and Galatic\", though he also uses Celtica as another name for Gaul. He reports Celtic peoples in Iberia too, calling them Celtiberi and Celtici.[31] Pliny the Elder noted the use of Celtici in Lusitania as a tribal surname,[32] which epigraphic findings have confirmed.[33][34] A Latin name for the Gauls, Galli (pl.), may come from a Celtic ethnic name, perhaps borrowed into Latin during the Celtic expansion into Italy from the early fifth century BC. Its root may be Proto-Celtic *galno, meaning \"power, strength\" (whence Old Irish gal \"boldness, ferocity\", Welsh gallu \"to be able, power\"). The Greek name Γαλάται (Galatai, Latinized Galatae) most likely has the same origin, referring to the Gauls who invaded southeast Europe and settled in Galatia.[35] The suffix -atai might be a Greek inflection.[36] Linguist Kim McCone suggests it comes from Proto-Celtic *galatis (\"ferocious, furious\"), and was not originally an ethnic name but a name for young warrior bands. He says \"If the Gauls' initial impact on the Mediterranean world was primarily a military one typically involving fierce young *galatīs, it would have been natural for the Greeks to apply this name for the type of Keltoi that they usually encountered\".[28] Because Classical writers did not call the inhabitants of Britain and Ireland Κελτοί (Keltoi) or Celtae,[5][8][9] some scholars prefer not to use the term for the Iron Age inhabitants of those islands.[5][8][9][10] However, they spoke Celtic languages, shared other cultural traits, and Roman historian Tacitus says the Britons resembled the Gauls in customs and religion.[11] For at least 1,000 years the name Celt was not used at all, and nobody called themselves Celts or Celtic, until from about 1700, after the word 'Celtic' was rediscovered in classical texts, it was applied for the first time to the distinctive culture, history, traditions, language of the modern Celtic nations – Ireland, Scotland, Wales, Cornwall, Brittany, and the Isle of Man.[37] 'Celt' is a modern English word, first attested in 1707 in the writing of Edward Lhuyd, whose work, along with that of other late 17th-century scholars, brought academic attention to the languages and history of the early Celtic inhabitants of Great Britain.[38] The English words Gaul, Gauls (pl.) and Gaulish (first recorded in the 16–17th centuries) come from French Gaule and Gaulois, a borrowing from Frankish *Walholant, 'Roman-land' (see Gaul: Name), the root of which is Proto-Germanic *walha-, 'foreigner, Roman, Celt', whence the English word Welsh (Old English wælisċ). Proto-Germanic *walha comes from the name of the Volcae,[39] a Celtic tribe who lived first in southern Germany and central Europe, then migrated to Gaul.[40] This means that English Gaul, despite its superficial similarity, is not actually derived from Latin Gallia (which should have produced *Jaille in French),[citation needed] though it does refer to the same ancient region. Celtic refers to a language family and, more generally, means 'of the Celts' or 'in the style of the Celts'. Several archaeological cultures are considered Celtic, based on unique sets of artefacts. The link between language and artefact is aided by the presence of inscriptions.[41] The modern idea of a Celtic cultural identity or \"Celticity\" focuses on similarities among languages, works of art, and classical texts,[42] and sometimes also among material artefacts, social organisation, homeland and mythology.[43] Earlier theories held that these similarities suggest a common \"racial\" (race is now a contested concept) origin for the various Celtic peoples, but more recent theories hold that they reflect a common cultural and linguistic heritage more than a genetic one. Celtic cultures seem to have been diverse, with the use of a Celtic language being the main thing they had in common.[5] Today, the term 'Celtic' generally refers to the languages and cultures of Ireland, Scotland, Wales, Cornwall, the Isle of Man, and Brittany; also called the Celtic nations. These are the regions where Celtic languages are still spoken to some extent. The four are Irish, Scottish Gaelic, Welsh, and Breton; plus two recent revivals, Cornish (a Brittonic language) and Manx (a Goidelic language). There are also attempts to reconstruct Cumbric, a Brittonic language of northern Britain. Celtic regions of mainland Europe are those whose residents claim a Celtic heritage, but where no Celtic language survives; these include western Iberia, i.e. Portugal and north-central Spain (Galicia, Asturias, Cantabria, Castile and León, Extremadura).[44] Continental Celts are the Celtic-speaking people of mainland Europe and Insular Celts are the Celtic-speaking people of the British and Irish islands, and their descendants. The Celts of Brittany derive their language from migrating Insular Celts from Britain and so are grouped accordingly.[45] The Celtic languages are a branch of the Indo-European languages. By the time Celts are first mentioned in written records around 400 BC, they were already split into several language groups, and spread over much of western mainland Europe, the Iberian Peninsula, Ireland and Britain. The languages developed into Celtiberian, Goidelic and Brittonic branches, among others.[46][47] The mainstream view during most of the twentieth century is that the Celts and the proto-Celtic language arose out of the Urnfield culture of central Europe around 1000 BC, spreading westward and southward over the following few hundred years.[14][48][49][50] The Urnfield culture was preeminent in central Europe during the late Bronze Age, circa 1200 BC to 700 BC. The spread of iron-working led to the Hallstatt culture (c. 800 to 500 BC) developing out of the Urnfield culture in a wide region north of the Alps. The Hallstatt culture developed into the La Tène culture from about 450 BC, which came to be identified with Celtic art.[citation needed] In 1846, Johann Georg Ramsauer unearthed an ancient grave field with distinctive grave goods at Hallstatt, Austria. Because the burials \"dated to roughly the time when Celts are mentioned near the Danube by Herodotus, Ramsauer concluded that the graves were Celtic\".[51] Similar sites and artifacts were found over a wide area, which were named the 'Hallstatt culture'. In 1857, the archaeological site of La Tène was discovered in Switzerland.[51] The huge collection of artifacts had a distinctive style. Artifacts of this 'La Tène style' were found elsewhere in Europe, \"particularly in places where people called Celts were known to have lived and early Celtic languages are attested. As a result, these items quickly became associated with the Celts, so much so that by the 1870s scholars began to regard finds of the La Tène as 'the archaeological expression of the Celts'\".[51] This cultural network was overrun by the Roman Empire, though traces of La Tène style were still seen in Gallo-Roman artifacts. In Britain and Ireland, the La Tène style survived precariously to re-emerge in Insular art.[citation needed] The Urnfield-Hallstatt theory began to be challenged in the latter 20th century, when it was accepted that the oldest known Celtic-language inscriptions were those of Lepontic from the 6th century BC and Celtiberian from the 2nd century BC. These were found in northern Italy and Iberia, neither of which were part of the 'Hallstatt' nor 'La Tène' cultures at the time.[11] The Urnfield-Hallstatt theory was partly based on ancient Greco-Roman writings, such as the Histories of Herodotus, which placed the Celts at the source of the Danube. However, Stephen Oppenheimer shows that Herodotus seemed to believe the Danube rose near the Pyrenees, which would place the Ancient Celts in a region which is more in agreement with later classical writers and historians (i.e. in Gaul and Iberia).[52] The theory was also partly based on the abundance of inscriptions bearing Celtic personal names in the Eastern Hallstatt region (Noricum). However, Patrick Sims-Williams notes that these date to the later Roman era, and says they suggest \"relatively late settlement by a Celtic-speaking elite\".[11] In the late 20th century, the Urnfield-Hallstatt theory began to fall out of favour with some scholars, which was influenced by new archaeological finds. 'Celtic' began to refer primarily to 'speakers of Celtic languages' rather than to a single culture or ethnic group.[11] A new theory suggested that Celtic languages arose earlier, along the Atlantic coast (including Britain, Ireland, Armorica and Iberia), long before evidence of 'Celtic' culture is found in archaeology. Myles Dillon and Nora Kershaw Chadwick argued that \"Celtic settlement of the British Isles\" might date to the Bell Beaker culture of the Copper and Bronze Age (from c. 2750 BC).[53][54] Martín Almagro Gorbea (2001) also proposed that Celtic arose in the 3rd millennium BC, suggesting that the spread of the Bell Beaker culture explained the wide dispersion of the Celts throughout western Europe, as well as the variability of the Celtic peoples.[55] Using a multidisciplinary approach, Alberto J. Lorrio and Gonzalo Ruiz Zapatero reviewed and built on Almagro Gorbea's work to present a model for the origin of Celtic archaeological groups in Iberia and proposing a rethinking of the meaning of \"Celtic\".[56] John T. Koch[57] and Barry Cunliffe[58] have developed this 'Celtic from the West' theory. It proposes that the proto-Celtic language arose along the Atlantic coast and was the lingua franca of the Atlantic Bronze Age cultural network, later spreading inland and eastward.[11] More recently, Cunliffe proposes that proto-Celtic had arisen in the Atlantic zone even earlier, by 3000 BC, and spread eastwards with the Bell Beaker culture over the following millennium. His theory is partly based on glottochronology, the spread of ancient Celtic-looking placenames, and thesis that the Tartessian language was Celtic.[11] However, the proposal that Tartessian was Celtic is widely rejected by linguists, many of whom regard it as unclassified.[59][60] Celticist Patrick Sims-Williams (2020) notes that in current scholarship, 'Celt' is primarily a linguistic label. In his 'Celtic from the Centre' theory, he argues that the proto-Celtic language did not originate in central Europe nor the Atlantic, but in-between these two regions. He suggests that it \"emerged as a distinct Indo-European dialect around the second millennium BC, probably somewhere in Gaul [centered in modern France] ... whence it spread in various directions and at various speeds in the first millennium BC\". Sims-Williams says this avoids the problematic idea \"that Celtic was spoken over a vast area for a very long time yet somehow avoided major dialectal splits\", and \"it keeps Celtic fairly close to Italy, which suits the view that Italic and Celtic were in some way linked\".[11] The Proto-Celtic language is usually dated to the Late Bronze Age.[14] The earliest records of a Celtic language are the Lepontic inscriptions of Cisalpine Gaul (Northern Italy), the oldest of which pre-date the La Tène period. Other early inscriptions, appearing from the early La Tène period in the area of Massilia, are in Gaulish, which was written in the Greek alphabet until the Roman conquest. Celtiberian inscriptions, using their own Iberian script, appear later, after about 200 BC. Evidence of Insular Celtic is available only from about 400 AD, in the form of Primitive Irish Ogham inscriptions.[citation needed] Besides epigraphic evidence, an important source of information on early Celtic is toponymy (place names).[61] Arnaiz-Villena et al. (2017) demonstrated that Celtic-related populations of the European Atlantic (Orkney Islands, Scottish, Irish, British, Bretons, Basques, Galicians) shared a common HLA system.[clarification needed][62] Other genetic research does not support the notion of a significant genetic link between these populations, beyond the fact that they are all West Europeans. Early European Farmers did settle Britain (and all of Northern Europe) in the Neolithic; however, recent genetics research has found that, between 2400 and 2000 BC, over 90% of British DNA was overturned by European Steppe Herders in a migration that brought large amounts of Steppe DNA (including the R1b haplogroup) to western Europe.[63] Modern autosomal genetic clustering is testament to this fact, as both modern and Iron Age British and Irish samples cluster genetically very closely with other North Europeans, and less so with Galicians, Basques or those from the south of France.[64][65] The concept that the Hallstatt and La Tène cultures could be seen not just as chronological periods but as \"Culture Groups\", entities composed of people of the same ethnicity and language, had started to grow by the end of the 19th century. At the beginning of the 20th century the belief that these \"Culture Groups\" could be thought of in racial or ethnic terms was held by Gordon Childe, whose theory was influenced by the writings of Gustaf Kossinna.[66] As the 20th century progressed, the ethnic interpretation of La Tène culture became more strongly rooted, and any findings of La Tène culture and flat inhumation cemeteries were linked to the Celts and the Celtic language.[67] In various[clarification needed] academic disciplines the Celts were considered a Central European Iron Age phenomenon, through the cultures of Hallstatt and La Tène. However, archaeological finds from the Halstatt and La Tène culture were rare in Iberia, southwestern France, northern and western Britain, southern Ireland and Galatia[68][69] and did not provide enough evidence for a culture like that of Central Europe. It is equally difficult to maintain that the origin of the Iberian Celts can be linked to the preceding Urnfield culture. This has resulted in a newer theory that introduces a 'proto-Celtic' substratum and a process of Celticisation, having its initial roots in the Bronze Age Bell Beaker culture.[70] The La Tène culture developed and flourished during the late Iron Age (from 450 BC to the Roman conquest in the 1st century BC) in eastern France, Switzerland, Austria, southwest Germany, the Czech Republic, Slovakia and Hungary. It developed out of the Hallstatt culture without any definite cultural break, under the impetus of considerable Mediterranean influence from Greek, and later Etruscan civilisations. A shift of settlement centres took place in the 4th century. The western La Tène culture corresponds to historical Celtic Gaul. Whether this means that the whole of La Tène culture can be attributed to a unified Celtic people is difficult to assess; archaeologists have repeatedly concluded that language and material culture do not necessarily run parallel. Frey notes that in the 5th century, \"burial customs in the Celtic world were not uniform; rather, localised groups had their own beliefs, which, in consequence, also gave rise to distinct artistic expressions\".[71] Thus, while the La Tène culture is certainly associated with the Gauls, the presence of La Tène artefacts may be due to cultural contact and does not imply the permanent presence of Celtic speakers.[citation needed] The Greek historian Ephorus of Cyme in Asia Minor, writing in the 4th century BC, believed the Celts came from the islands off the mouth of the Rhine and were \"driven from their homes by the frequency of wars and the violent rising of the sea\". Polybius published a history of Rome about 150 BC in which he describes the Gauls of Italy and their conflict with Rome. Pausanias in the 2nd century AD says that the Gauls \"originally called Celts\", \"live on the remotest region of Europe on the coast of an enormous tidal sea\". Posidonius described the southern Gauls about 100 BC. Though his original work is lost, later writers such as Strabo used it. The latter, writing in the early 1st century AD, deals with Britain and Gaul as well as Hispania, Italy, and Galatia. Caesar wrote extensively about his Gallic Wars in 58–51 BC. Diodorus Siculus wrote about the Celts of Gaul and Britain in his 1st-century history.[citation needed] Diodorus Siculus and Strabo both suggest that the heartland of the people they call Celts was in southern Gaul. The former says that the Gauls were to the north of the Celts, but that the Romans referred to both as Gauls (linguistically the Gauls were certainly Celts). Before the discoveries at Hallstatt and La Tène, it was generally considered that the Celtic heartland was southern Gaul, see Encyclopædia Britannica for 1813.[citation needed] The Romans knew the Celts then living in present-day France as Gauls. The territory of these peoples probably included the Low Countries, the Alps and present-day northern Italy. Julius Caesar in his Gallic Wars described the 1st-century BC descendants of those Gauls.[citation needed] Eastern Gaul became the centre of the western La Tène culture. In later Iron Age Gaul, the social organisation resembled that of the Romans, with large towns. From the 3rd century BC the Gauls adopted coinage. Texts with Greek characters from southern Gaul have survived from the 2nd century BC.[72] Greek traders founded Massalia about 600 BC, with some objects (mostly drinking ceramic vessels) being traded up the Rhône valley. But trade became disrupted soon after 500 BC and re-oriented over the Alps to the Po valley in the Italian peninsula. The Romans arrived in the Rhone valley in the 2nd century BC and encountered a mostly Celtic-speaking Gaul. Rome wanted land communications with its Iberian provinces and fought a major battle with the Saluvii at Entremont in 124–123 BC. Gradually Roman control extended, and the Roman province of Gallia Transalpina developed along the Mediterranean coast.[73][74] The Romans knew the remainder of Gaul as Gallia Comata, 'Long-haired Gaul'.[75] In 58 BC, the Helvetii planned to migrate westward but Julius Caesar forced them back. He then became involved in fighting the various tribes in Gaul, and by 55 BC had overrun most of Gaul. In 52 BC, Vercingetorix led a revolt against Roman occupation but was defeated at the Battle of Alesia and surrendered.[76] Following the Gallic Wars of 58–51 BC, Caesar's Celtica formed the main part of Roman Gaul, becoming the province of Gallia Lugdunensis. This territory of the Celtic tribes was bounded on the south by the Garonne and on the north by the Seine and the Marne.[77] The Romans attached large swathes of this region to neighbouring provinces Belgica and Aquitania, particularly under Augustus.[78] Place- and personal-name analysis and inscriptions suggest that Gaulish was spoken over most of what is now France.[79][80] Until the end of the 19th century, traditional scholarship dealing with the Celts did acknowledge their presence in the Iberian Peninsula[81][82] as a material culture relatable to the Hallstatt and La Tène cultures. However, since according to the definition of the Iron Age in the 19th century Celtic populations were supposedly rare in Iberia and did not provide a cultural scenario that could easily be linked to that of Central Europe, the presence of Celtic culture in that region was generally not fully recognised. Modern scholarship, however, has proven that Celtic presence and influences were most substantial in what is today Spain and Portugal (with perhaps the highest settlement saturation in Western Europe), particularly in the central, western and northern regions.[83][84] In addition to Gauls infiltrating from the north of the Pyrenees, the Roman and Greek sources mention Celtic populations in three parts of the Iberian Peninsula: the eastern part of the Meseta (inhabited by the Celtiberians), the southwest (Celtici, in modern-day Alentejo) and the northwest (Gallaecia and Asturias).[85] A modern scholarly review[86] found several archaeological groups of Celts in Spain: The origins of the Celtiberians might provide a key to understanding the Celticisation process in the rest of the Peninsula. The process of Celticisation of the southwestern area of the peninsula by the Keltoi and of the northwestern area is, however, not a simple Celtiberian question. Recent investigations about the Callaici[91] and Bracari[92] in northwestern Portugal are providing new approaches to understanding Celtic culture (language, art and religion) in western Iberia.[93] John T. Koch of Aberystwyth University suggested that Tartessian inscriptions of the 8th century BC might be classified as Celtic. This would mean that Tartessian is the earliest attested trace of Celtic by a margin of more than a century.[94] In Germany by the late Bronze Age, the Urnfield culture (c. 1300 BC – c. 750 BC) had replaced the Bell Beaker, Unetice and Tumulus cultures in central Europe,[97] whilst the Nordic Bronze Age had developed in Scandinavia and northern Germany. The Hallstatt culture, which had developed from the Urnfield culture, was the predominant Western and Central European culture from the 12th to 8th centuries BC and during the early Iron Age (8th to 6th centuries BC). It was followed by the La Tène culture (5th to 1st centuries BC). The people who had adopted these cultural characteristics in central and southern Germany are regarded as Celts. Celtic cultural centres developed in central Europe during the late Bronze Age (c. 1200 BC until 700 BC). Some, like the Heuneburg, the oldest city north of the Alps,[98] grew to become important cultural centres of the Iron Age in Central Europe, that maintained trade routes to the Mediterranean. In the 5th century BC the Greek historian Herodotus mentioned a Celtic city at the Danube – Pyrene, that historians attribute to the Heuneburg. Beginning around 700 BC (or later), Germanic peoples (Germanic tribes) from southern Scandinavia and northern Germany expanded south and gradually replaced the Celtic peoples in Central Europe.[99][100][101][102][103][104] The Canegrate culture represented the first migratory wave of the proto-Celtic[105][106] population from the northwest part of the Alps that, through the Alpine passes, had already penetrated and settled in the western Po valley between Lake Maggiore and Lake Como (Scamozzina culture). It has also been proposed that a more ancient proto-Celtic presence can be traced back to the beginning of the Middle Bronze Age, when North Westwern Italy appears closely linked regarding the production of bronze artefacts, including ornaments, to the western groups of the Tumulus culture.[107] La Tène cultural material appeared over a large area of mainland Italy,[108] the southernmost example being the Celtic helmet from Canosa di Puglia.[109] Italy is home to Lepontic, the oldest attested Celtic language (from the 6th century BC).[110] Anciently spoken in Switzerland and in Northern-Central Italy, from the Alps to Umbria.[111][112][113][114] According to the Recueil des Inscriptions Gauloises, more than 760 Gaulish inscriptions have been found throughout present-day France – with the notable exception of Aquitaine – and in Italy,[115][116] which testifies the importance of Celtic heritage in the peninsula.[citation needed] In 391 BC, Celts \"who had their homes beyond the Alps streamed through the passes in great strength and seized the territory that lay between the Apennine Mountains and the Alps\" according to Diodorus Siculus. The Po Valley and the rest of northern Italy (known to the Romans as Cisalpine Gaul) was inhabited by Celtic-speakers who founded cities such as Milan.[117] Later the Roman army was routed at the battle of Allia and Rome was sacked in 390 BC by the Senones.[118] At the battle of Telamon in 225 BC, a large Celtic army was trapped between two Roman forces and crushed.[119] The defeat of the combined Samnite, Celtic and Etruscan alliance by the Romans in the Third Samnite War sounded the beginning of the end of the Celtic domination in mainland Europe, but it was not until 192 BC that the Roman armies conquered the last remaining independent Celtic kingdoms in Italy.[citation needed] The Celts also expanded down the Danube river and its tributaries. One of the most influential tribes, the Scordisci, established their capital at Singidunum (present-day Belgrade, Serbia) in the 3rd century BC. The concentration of hill-forts and cemeteries shows a dense population in the Tisza valley of modern-day Vojvodina, Serbia, Hungary and into Ukraine. Expansion into Romania was however blocked by the Dacians.[citation needed] The Serdi were a Celtic tribe[120] inhabiting Thrace. They were located around and founded Serdika (Bulgarian: Сердика, Latin: Ulpia Serdica, Greek: Σαρδῶν πόλις), now Sofia in Bulgaria,[121] which reflects their ethnonym. They would have established themselves in this area during the Celtic migrations at the end of the 4th century BC, though there is no evidence for their existence before the 1st century BC. Serdi are among traditional tribal names reported into the Roman era.[122] They were gradually Thracianized over the centuries but retained their Celtic character in material culture up to a late date.[when?][citation needed] According to other sources they may have been simply of Thracian origin,[123] according to others they may have become of mixed Thraco-Celtic origin. Further south, Celts settled in Thrace (Bulgaria), which they ruled for over a century, and Anatolia, where they settled as the Galatians (see also: Gallic Invasion of Greece). Despite their geographical isolation from the rest of the Celtic world, the Galatians maintained their Celtic language for at least 700 years. St Jerome, who visited Ancyra (modern-day Ankara) in 373 AD, likened their language to that of the Treveri of northern Gaul.[citation needed] For Venceslas Kruta, Galatia in central Turkey was an area of dense Celtic settlement.[citation needed] The Boii tribe gave their name to Bohemia, Bologna and possibly Bavaria, and Celtic artefacts and cemeteries have been discovered further east in what is now Poland and Slovakia. A Celtic coin (Biatec) from Bratislava's mint was displayed on the old Slovak 5-crown coin.[citation needed] As there is no archaeological evidence for large-scale invasions in some of the other areas, one current school of thought holds that Celtic language and culture spread to those areas by contact rather than invasion.[124] However, the Celtic invasions of Italy and the expedition in Greece and western Anatolia, are well documented in Greek and Latin history.[125][126] There are records of Celtic mercenaries in Egypt serving the Ptolemies. Thousands were employed in 283–246 BC and they were also in service around 186 BC. They attempted to overthrow Ptolemy II.[127] All living Celtic languages today belong to the Insular Celtic languages, derived from the Celtic languages spoken in Iron Age Britain and Ireland.[128] They separated into a Goidelic and a Brittonic branch early on. By the time of the Roman conquest of Britain in the 1st century AD, the Insular Celts were made up of the Celtic Britons, the Gaels (or Scoti), and the Picts (or Caledonians).[citation needed] The renown of insular Celts has caused a popular belief that Celtic clans only lived in the British Isles.[129] Linguists have debated whether a Celtic language came to the British Isles and then split, or whether the two branches arrived separately. The older view was that Celtic influence in the Isles was the result of successive migrations or invasions from the European mainland by diverse Celtic-speaking peoples over several centuries, accounting for the P-Celtic vs. Q-Celtic isogloss. This view has been challenged by the hypothesis that the islands' Celtic languages form an Insular Celtic dialect group.[130] In the 19th and 20th centuries, scholars often dated the \"arrival\" of Celtic culture in Britain (via an invasion model) to the 6th century BC, corresponding to archaeological evidence of Hallstatt influence and the appearance of chariot burials in what is now England. Cunliffe and Koch propose in their newer 'Celtic from the West' theory that Celtic languages reached the Isles earlier, with the Bell Beaker culture c.2500 BC, or even before this.[131][132] More recently, a major archaeogenetics study uncovered a migration into southern Britain in the Bronze Age from 1300 to 800 BC.[133] The newcomers were genetically most similar to ancient individuals from Gaul.[133] From 1000 BC, their genetic marker swiftly spread through southern Britain,[134] but not northern Britain.[133] The authors see this as a \"plausible vector for the spread of early Celtic languages into Britain\".[133] There was much less immigration during the Iron Age, so it is likely that Celtic reached Britain before then.[133] Cunliffe suggests that a branch of Celtic was already spoken in Britain, and the Bronze Age migration introduced the Brittonic branch.[135] Like many Celtic peoples on the mainland, the Insular Celts followed an Ancient Celtic religion overseen by druids. Some of the southern British tribes had strong links with Gaul and Belgica, and minted their own coins. During the Roman occupation of Britain, a Romano-British culture emerged in the southeast. The Britons and Picts in the north, and the Gaels of Ireland, remained outside the empire. During the end of Roman rule in Britain in the 400s AD, there was significant Anglo-Saxon settlement of eastern and southern Britain, and some Gaelic settlement of its western coast. During this time, some Britons migrated to the Armorican peninsula, where their culture became dominant. Meanwhile, much of northern Britain (Scotland) became Gaelic. By the 10th century AD, the Insular Celtic peoples had diversified into the Brittonic-speaking Welsh (in Wales), Cornish (in Cornwall), Bretons (in Brittany) and Cumbrians (in the Old North); and the Gaelic-speaking Irish (in Ireland), Scots (in Scotland) and Manx (on the Isle of Man).[citation needed] Classical writers did not call the inhabitants of Britain and Ireland Celtae or Κελτοί (Keltoi),[5][8][9] leading some scholars to question the use of the term 'Celt' for the Iron Age inhabitants of those islands.[5][8][9][10] The first historical account of the islands was by the Greek geographer Pytheas, who sailed around what he called the \"Pretannikai nesoi\" (the \"Pretannic isles\") around 310–306 BC.[136] In general, classical writers referred to the Britons as Pretannoi (in Greek) or Britanni (in Latin).[137] Strabo, writing in Roman times, distinguished between the Celts and Britons.[138] However, Roman historian Tacitus says the Britons resembled the Celts of Gaul in customs and religion.[11] Under Caesar the Romans conquered Celtic Gaul, and from Claudius onward the Roman empire absorbed parts of Britain. Roman local government of these regions closely mirrored pre-Roman tribal boundaries, and archaeological finds suggest native involvement in local government.[citation needed] The native peoples under Roman rule became Romanised and keen to adopt Roman ways. Celtic art had already incorporated classical influences, and surviving Gallo-Roman pieces interpret classical subjects or keep faith with old traditions despite a Roman overlay.[citation needed] The Roman occupation of Gaul, and to a lesser extent of Britain, led to Roman-Celtic syncretism. In the case of the continental Celts, this eventually resulted in a language shift to Vulgar Latin, while the Insular Celts retained their language.[citation needed] There was also considerable cultural influence exerted by Gaul on Rome, particularly in military matters and horsemanship, as the Gauls often served in the Roman cavalry. The Romans adopted the Celtic cavalry sword, the spatha, and Epona, the Celtic horse goddess.[139][140] To the extent that sources are available, they depict a pre-Christian Iron Age Celtic social structure based formally on class and kingship, although this may only have been a particular late phase of organisation in Celtic societies. Patron-client relationships similar to those of Roman society are also described by Caesar and others in the Gaul of the 1st century BC.[citation needed] In the main, the evidence is of tribes being led by kings, although some argue that there is also evidence of oligarchical republican forms of government eventually emerging in areas which had close contact with Rome. Most descriptions of Celtic societies portray them as being divided into three groups: a warrior aristocracy; an intellectual class including professions such as druid, poet, and jurist; and everyone else. In historical times, the offices of high and low kings in Ireland and Scotland were filled by election under the system of tanistry, which eventually came into conflict with the feudal principle of primogeniture in which succession goes to the first-born son.[citation needed] Little is known of family structure among the Celts. Patterns of settlement varied from decentralised to urban. The popular stereotype of non-urbanised societies settled in hillforts and duns,[141] drawn from Britain and Ireland (there are about 3,000 hill forts known in Britain)[142] contrasts with the urban settlements present in the core Hallstatt and La Tène areas, with the many significant oppida of Gaul late in the first millennium BC, and with the towns of Gallia Cisalpina.[citation needed] Slavery, as practised by the Celts, was very likely similar to the better documented practice in ancient Greece and Rome.[143] Slaves were acquired from war, raids, and penal and debt servitude.[143] Slavery was hereditary,[144] though manumission was possible. The Old Irish and Welsh words for 'slave', cacht and caeth respectively, are cognate with Latin captus 'captive' suggesting that the slave trade was an early means of contact between Latin and Celtic societies.[143] In the Middle Ages, slavery was especially prevalent in the Celtic countries.[145] Manumissions were discouraged by law and the word for 'female slave', cumal, was used as a general unit of value in Ireland.[146] There are only very limited records from pre-Christian times written in Celtic languages. These are mostly inscriptions in the Roman and sometimes Greek alphabets. The ogham script, an Early Medieval alphabet, was mostly used in early Christian times in Ireland and Scotland (but also in Wales and England), and was only used for ceremonial purposes such as inscriptions on gravestones. The available evidence is of a strong oral tradition, such as that preserved by bards in Ireland, and eventually recorded by monasteries. Celtic art also produced a great deal of intricate and beautiful metalwork, examples of which have been preserved by their distinctive burial rites.[147] In some regards the Atlantic Celts were conservative: for example, they still used chariots in combat long after they had been reduced to ceremonial roles by the Greeks and Romans. However, despite being outdated, Celtic chariot tactics were able to repel the invasions of Britain attempted by Julius Caesar.[148] According to Diodorus Siculus: The Gauls are tall of body with rippling muscles and white of skin and their hair is blond, and not only naturally so for they also make it their practice by artificial means to increase the distinguishing colour which nature has given it. For they are always washing their hair in limewater and they pull it back from the forehead to the nape of the neck, with the result that their appearance is like that of Satyrs and Pans since the treatment of their hair makes it so heavy and coarse that it differs in no respect from the mane of horses. Some of them shave the beard but others let it grow a little; and the nobles shave their cheeks but they let the moustache grow until it covers the mouth. During the later Iron Age the Gauls generally wore long-sleeved shirts or tunics and long trousers (called braccae by the Romans).[149] Clothes were made of wool or linen, with some silk being used by the rich. Cloaks were worn in the winter. Brooches[150] and armlets were used, but the most famous item of jewellery was the torc, a neck collar of metal, sometimes gold. The horned Waterloo Helmet in the British Museum, which long set the standard for modern images of Celtic warriors, is in fact a unique survival, and may have been a piece for ceremonial rather than military wear.[151] Archaeological evidence suggests that the pre-Roman Celtic societies were linked to the network of overland trade routes that spanned Eurasia. Archaeologists have discovered large prehistoric trackways crossing bogs in Ireland and Germany. Due to their substantial nature, these are believed to have been created for wheeled transport as part of an extensive roadway system that facilitated trade.[152] The territory held by the Celts contained tin, lead, iron, silver and gold.[153] Celtic smiths and metalworkers created weapons and jewellery for international trade, particularly with the Romans.[154] The myth that the Celtic monetary system consisted of wholly barter is a common one, but is in part false. The monetary system was complex and is still not understood (much like the late Roman coinages), and due to the absence of large numbers of coin items, it is assumed that \"proto-money\" was used. This included bronze items made from the early La Tène period and onwards, which were often in the shape of axeheads, rings, or bells. Due to the large number of these present in some burials, it is thought they had a relatively high monetary value, and could be used for \"day to day\" purchases. Low-value coinages of potin, a bronze alloy with high tin content, were minted in most Celtic areas of the continent and in South-East Britain prior to the Roman conquest of these lands. Higher-value coinages, suitable for use in trade, were minted in gold, silver, and high-quality bronze. Gold coinage was much more common than silver coinage, despite being worth substantially more, as while there were around 100 mines in Southern Britain and Central France, silver was more rarely mined. This was due partly to the relative sparsity of mines and the amount of effort needed for extraction compared to the profit gained. As the Roman civilisation grew in importance and expanded its trade with the Celtic world, silver and bronze coinage became more common. This coincided with a major increase in gold production in Celtic areas to meet the Roman demand, due to the high value Romans put on the metal. The large number of gold mines in France is thought to be a major reason why Caesar invaded.[155] Very few reliable sources exist regarding Celtic views on gender roles, though some archaeological evidence suggests their views may have differed from those of the Greco-Roman world, which tended to be less egalitarian.[156][157] Some Iron Age burials in northeastern Gaul suggest women may have had roles in warfare during the earlier La Tène period, but the evidence is far from conclusive.[158] Celtic individuals buried with both female jewellery and weaponry have been found, such as the Vix Grave in northeastern Gaul, and there are questions about the gender of some individuals buried with weaponry. However, it has been suggested that the weapons indicate high social rank rather than masculinity.[159] Most written accounts of the Ancient Celts are from the Romans and Greeks, though it is not clear how accurate these are. Roman historians Ammianus Marcellinus and Tacitus mentioned Celtic women inciting, participating in, and leading battles.[160] Plutarch reports that Celtic women acted as ambassadors to avoid a war among Celtic chiefdoms in the Po valley during the 4th century BC.[161] Posidonius' anthropological comments on the Celts had common themes, primarily primitivism, extreme ferocity, cruel sacrificial practices, and the strength and courage of their women.[162] Cassius Dio suggests there was great sexual freedom among women in Celtic Britain:[163] ... a very witty remark is reported to have been made by the wife of Argentocoxus, a Caledonian, to Julia Augusta. When the empress was jesting with her, after the treaty, about the free intercourse of her sex with men in Britain, she replied: \"We fulfill the demands of nature in a much better way than do you Roman women; for we consort openly with the best men, whereas you let yourselves be debauched in secret by the vilest\". Such was the retort of the British woman. Barry Cunliffe writes that such references are \"likely to be ill-observed\" and meant to portray the Celts as outlandish \"barbarians\".[164] Historian Lisa Bitel argues the descriptions of Celtic women warriors are not credible. She says some Roman and Greek writers wanted to show that the barbarian Celts lived in \"an upside-down world ... and a standard ingredient in such a world was the manly warrior woman\".[165] The Greek philosopher Aristotle wrote in his Politics that the Celts of southeastern Europe approved of male homosexuality. Greek historian Diodorus Siculus wrote in his Bibliotheca historica that although Gaulish women were beautiful, the men had \"little to do with them\" and it was a custom for men to sleep on animal skins with two younger males. He further claimed that \"the young men will offer themselves to strangers and are insulted if the offer is refused\". His claim was later repeated by Greco-Roman writers Athenaeus and Ammianus.[166] H. David Rankin, in Celts and the Classical World, suggests some of these claims refer to bonding rituals in warrior groups, which required abstinence from women at certain times,[167] and says it probably reflects \"the warlike character of early contacts between the Celts and the Greeks\".[168] Under Brehon Law, which was written down in early Medieval Ireland after conversion to Christianity, a woman had the right to divorce her husband and gain his property if he was unable to perform his marital duties due to impotence, obesity, homosexual inclination or preference for other women.[169][170][failed verification] Celtic art is generally used by art historians to refer to art of the La Tène period across Europe, while the Early Medieval art of Britain and Ireland, that is what \"Celtic art\" evokes for much of the general public, is called Insular art in art history. Both styles absorbed considerable influences from non-Celtic sources, but retained a preference for geometrical decoration over figurative subjects, which are often extremely stylised when they do appear; narrative scenes only appear under outside influence. Energetic circular forms, triskeles and spirals are characteristic. Much of the surviving material is in precious metal, which no doubt gives a very unrepresentative picture, but apart from Pictish stones and the Insular high crosses, large monumental sculpture, even with decorative carving, is very rare; possibly it was originally common in wood. Celts were also able to create developed musical instruments such as the carnyces, these famous war trumpets used before the battle to frighten the enemy, as the best preserved found in Tintignac (Gaul) in 2004 and which were decorated with a boar head or a snake head.[171] The interlace patterns that are often regarded as typical of \"Celtic art\" were characteristic of the whole of the British Isles, a style referred to as Insular art, or Hiberno-Saxon art. This artistic style incorporated elements of La Tène, Late Roman, and, most importantly, animal Style II of Germanic Migration Period art. The style was taken up with great skill and enthusiasm by Celtic artists in metalwork and illuminated manuscripts. Equally, the forms used for the finest Insular art were all adopted from the Roman world: Gospel books like the Book of Kells and Book of Lindisfarne, chalices like the Ardagh Chalice and Derrynaflan Chalice, and penannular brooches like the Tara Brooch and Roscrea Brooch. These works are from the period of peak achievement of Insular art, which lasted from the 7th to the 9th centuries, before the Viking attacks sharply set back cultural life.[citation needed] In contrast the less well known but often spectacular art of the richest earlier Continental Celts, before they were conquered by the Romans, often adopted elements of Roman, Greek and other \"foreign\" styles (and possibly used imported craftsmen) to decorate objects that were distinctively Celtic. After the Roman conquests, some Celtic elements remained in popular art, especially Ancient Roman pottery, of which Gaul was actually the largest producer, mostly in Italian styles, but also producing work in local taste, including figurines of deities and wares painted with animals and other subjects in highly formalised styles. Roman Britain also took more interest in enamel than most of the Empire, and its development of champlevé technique was probably important to the later Medieval art of the whole of Europe, of which the energy and freedom of Insular decoration was an important element. Rising nationalism brought Celtic revivals from the 19th century.[citation needed] The Coligny calendar, which was found in 1897 in Coligny, Ain, was engraved on a bronze tablet, preserved in 73 fragments, that originally was 1.48 metres (4 feet 10 inches) wide and 0.9 metres (2 feet 11 inches) high (Lambert p. 111). Based on the style of lettering and the accompanying objects, it probably dates to the end of the 2nd century.[172] It is written in Latin inscriptional capitals, and is in Gaulish. The restored tablet contains 16 vertical columns, with 62 months distributed over 5 years.[citation needed] French archaeologist J. Monard speculated that it was recorded by druids wishing to preserve their tradition of timekeeping in a time when the Julian calendar was imposed throughout the Roman Empire. However, the general form of the calendar suggests the public peg calendars (or parapegmata) found throughout the Greek and Roman world.[173] Tribal warfare appears to have been a regular feature of Celtic societies. While epic literature depicts this as more of a sport focused on raids and hunting rather than organised territorial conquest, the historical record is more of tribes using warfare to exert political control and harass rivals, for economic advantage, and in some instances to conquer territory.[citation needed] The Celts were described by classical writers such as Strabo, Livy, Pausanias, and Florus as fighting like \"wild beasts\", and as hordes. Dionysius said that their:[174] [175] manner of fighting, being in large measure that of wild beasts and frenzied, was an erratic procedure, quite lacking in military science. Thus, at one moment they would raise their swords aloft and smite after the manner of wild boars, throwing the whole weight of their bodies into the blow like hewers of wood or men digging with mattocks, and again they would deliver crosswise blows aimed at no target, as if they intended to cut to pieces the entire bodies of their adversaries, protective armour and all. Polybius (2.33) indicates that the principal Celtic weapon was a long bladed sword which was used for hacking edgewise rather than stabbing. Celtic warriors are described by Polybius and Plutarch as frequently having to cease fighting in order to straighten their sword blades. This claim has been questioned by some archaeologists, who note that Noric steel, steel produced in Celtic Noricum, was famous in the Roman Empire period and was used to equip the Roman military.[176][177] However, Radomir Pleiner, in The Celtic Sword (1993) argues that \"the metallographic evidence shows that Polybius was right up to a point\", as around one third of surviving swords from the period might well have behaved as he describes.[178] In addition to these long bladed slashing swords, spears and specialized javelins were also used.[179] Polybius also asserts that certain of the Celts fought naked: \"The appearance of these naked warriors was a terrifying spectacle, for they were all men of splendid physique and in the prime of life.\"[180] According to Livy, this was also true of the Celts of Asia Minor.[181] Celts had a reputation as head hunters.[182] Paul Jacobsthal says: \"Amongst the Celts the human head was venerated above all else, since the head was to the Celt the soul, centre of the emotions as well as of life itself, a symbol of divinity and of the powers of the other-world.\"[183] Writing in the first century BC, Greek historians Posidonius and Diodorus Siculus said Celtic warriors cut off the heads of enemies slain in battle, hung them from the necks of their horses, then nailed them up outside their homes.[182] Strabo wrote in the same century that Celts embalmed the heads of their most esteemed enemies in cedar oil and put them on display.[182] Roman historian Livy wrote that the Boii beheaded a defeated Roman general after the Battle of Silva Litana, covered his skull in gold, and used it as a ritual cup.[182] Archaeologists have found evidence that heads were embalmed and displayed by the southern Gauls.[184][185] In another example, at the southern Gaulish site of Entremont, there stood a pillar carved with skulls, within which were niches where human skulls were kept, nailed into position.[186] Roquepertuse nearby has similar carved heads and skull niches. Many lone carved heads have been found in Celtic regions, some with two or three faces.[187] Examples include the Mšecké Žehrovice Head and the Corleck Head. Severed heads are a common motif in Insular Celtic myths, and there are many tales in which 'living heads' preside over feasts or speak prophecies.[182][187] The beheading game is a motif in Irish myth and Arthurian legend, most famously in the tale Sir Gawain and the Green Knight, where the Green Knight picks up his own severed head after Gawain has struck it off. There are also many legends in Celtic regions of saints who carry their own severed heads. In Irish myth, the severed heads of warriors are called the mast or nuts of the goddess Macha.[188] Like other European Iron Age societies, the Celts practised a polytheistic religion and believed in an afterlife.[189][190][unreliable source] Celtic religion varied by region and over time, but had \"broad structural similarities\",[189] and there was \"a basic religious homogeneity\" among the Celtic peoples.[191] Because the ancient Celts did not have writing, evidence about their religion is gleaned from archaeology, Greco-Roman accounts, and literature from the early Christian period.[192] The names of over two hundred Celtic deities have survived (see list of Celtic deities), although it is likely that many of these were alternative names, regional names or titles for the same deity.[189] Some deities were venerated only in one region, but others were more widely known.[189] According to Miranda Aldhouse-Green, the Celts were also animists, believing that every part of the natural world had a spirit.[192] The Celts seem to have had a father god, who was often a god of the tribe and of the dead (Toutatis probably being one name for him); and a mother goddess who was associated with the land, earth and fertility[193] (Dea Matrona probably being one name for her). The mother goddess could also take the form of a war goddess as protectress of her tribe and its land.[193] There also seems to have been a male celestial god—identified with Taranis—associated with thunder, the wheel, and the bull.[193] There were gods of skill and craft, such as the pan-regional god Lugus, and the smith god Gobannos.[193] Celtic healing deities were often associated with sacred springs,[193] such as Sirona and Borvo. Other pan-regional deities include the horned god Cernunnos, the horse and fertility goddess Epona, the divine son Maponos, as well as Belenos, Ogmios, and Sucellos.[189][192] Caesar says the Gauls believed they all descended from a god of the dead and underworld.[189] Triplicity is a common theme in Celtic cosmology, and a number of deities were seen as threefold,[194] for example the Three Mothers.[195] Celtic religious ceremonies were overseen by priests known as druids, who also served as judges, teachers, and lore-keepers. Other classes of druids performed sacrifices for the perceived benefit of the community.[196] There is evidence that ancient Celtic peoples sacrificed animals, almost always livestock or working animals. It appears some were offered wholly to the gods (by burying or burning), while some were shared between gods and humans (part eaten and part offered).[197] There is also some evidence that ancient Celts sacrificed humans, and some Greco-Roman sources claim the Gauls sacrificed criminals by burning them in a wicker man.[198] The Romans said the Celts held ceremonies in sacred groves and other natural shrines, called nemetons.[189] Some Celtic peoples built temples or ritual enclosures of varying shapes (such as the Romano-Celtic temple and viereckschanze), though they also maintained shrines at natural sites.[189] Celtic peoples often made votive offerings: treasured items deposited in water and wetlands, or in ritual shafts and wells, often in the same place over generations.[189] Modern clootie wells might be a continuation of this.[199] Most surviving Celtic mythology belongs to the Insular Celtic peoples: Irish mythology has the largest written body of myths, followed by Welsh mythology. These were written down in the early Middle Ages, mainly by Christian scribes. The supernatural race called the Tuatha Dé Danann are believed to represent the main Celtic gods of Ireland. Their traditional rivals are the Fomóire, whom they defeat in the Battle of Mag Tuired.[200] Barry Cunliffe says the underlying structure in Irish myth was a dualism between the male tribal god and the female goddess of the land.[189] The Dagda seems to have been the chief god and the Morrígan his consort, each of whom had other names.[189] One common motif is the sovereignty goddess, who represents the land and bestows sovereignty on a king by marrying him. The goddess Brigid was linked with nature as well as poetry, healing and smithing.[194] Some figures in medieval Insular Celtic myth have ancient continental parallels: Irish Lugh and Welsh Lleu are cognate with Lugus, Goibniu and Gofannon with Gobannos, Macán and Mabon with Maponos, while Macha and Rhiannon may be counterparts of Epona.[201] In Insular Celtic myth, the Otherworld is a parallel realm where the gods dwell. Some mythical heroes visit it by entering ancient burial mounds or caves, by going under water or across the western sea, or after being offered a silver apple branch by an Otherworld resident.[202] Irish myth says that the spirits of the dead travel to the house of Donn (Tech Duinn), a legendary ancestor; this echoes Caesar's comment that the Gauls believed they all descended from a god of the dead and underworld.[189] Insular Celtic peoples celebrated four seasonal festivals, known to the Gaels as Beltaine (1 May), Lughnasa (1 August), Samhain (1 November) and Imbolc (1 February).[189] The Roman invasion of Gaul brought a great deal of Celtic peoples into the Roman Empire. Roman culture had a profound effect on the Celtic tribes which came under the empire's control. Roman influence led to many changes in Celtic religion, the most noticeable of which was the weakening of the druid class, especially religiously; the druids were to eventually disappear altogether. Romano-Celtic deities also began to appear: these deities often had both Roman and Celtic attributes, combined the names of Roman and Celtic deities, or included couples with one Roman and one Celtic deity. Other changes included the adaptation of the Jupiter Column, a sacred column set up in many Celtic regions of the empire, primarily in northern and eastern Gaul. Another major change in religious practice was the use of stone monuments to represent gods and goddesses. The Celts had probably only created wooden cult images (including monuments carved into trees, which were known as sacred poles) before the Roman conquest.[195] While the regions under Roman rule adopted Christianity along with the rest of the Roman empire, unconquered areas of Ireland and Scotland began to move from Celtic polytheism to Christianity in the 5th century. Ireland was converted by missionaries from Britain, such as Saint Patrick. Later missionaries from Ireland were a major source of missionary work in Scotland, Anglo-Saxon parts of Britain, and central Europe (see Hiberno-Scottish mission). Celtic Christianity, the forms of Christianity that took hold in Britain and Ireland at this time, had for some centuries only limited and intermittent contact with Rome and continental Christianity, as well as some contacts with Coptic Christianity. Some elements of Celtic Christianity developed, or retained, features that made them distinct from the rest of Western Christianity, most famously their conservative method of calculating the date of Easter. In 664, the Synod of Whitby began to resolve these differences, mostly by adopting the current Roman practices, which the Gregorian Mission from Rome had introduced to Anglo-Saxon England.[citation needed] Genetic studies on the limited amount of material available suggest continuity between Iron Age people from areas considered Celtic and the earlier Bell Beaker culture of Bronze Age Western Europe.[206][207][208] Like the Bell Beakers, ancient Celts carried a substantial amount of Western Steppe Herders ancestry, which is derived from Yamnaya pastoralists who expanded westwards from the Pontic–Caspian steppe during the late Neolithic and the early Bronze Age and associated with the initial spread of Indo-European languages.[209] This ancestry was particularly prevalent among Celts of Northwest Europe.[208] Examined individuals overwhelmingly carry types of the paternal haplogroup R-M269,[203][204][205] while the maternal haplogroups H and U are frequent.[210][211] These lineages are associated with steppe ancestry.[203][210] The spread of Celts into Iberia and the emergence of the Celtiberians is associated with an increase in north-central European ancestry in Iberia, and may be connected to the expansion of the Urnfield culture.[212] The paternal haplogroup haplogroup I2a1a1a has been detected among Celtiberians.[213] There appears to have been significant gene flow among Celtic peoples of Western Europe during the Iron Age.[214][208] While the Gauls of southern France display genetic links with the Celtiberians, the Gauls of northern France display links with Great Britain and Sweden.[215] Modern populations of Western Europe, particularly those who still speak Celtic languages, display substantial genetic continuity with the Iron Age populations of the same areas.[216][217][218] Geography Organisations",

                "content": "Celtic refers to Irish culture and heritage, along with the historical people who migrated from the British Isles throughout much of Europe. While the early pronunciation was with an /s/ sound, reflecting its nearest origin in French, the modern standard is a hard \"c\" sound like /k/. This is because language historians desired the word to better reflect its Greek and Classical Latin origins. The soft \"c\" sound is usually reserved for sports teams now, like the Boston Celtics. Be it in the pub or in the halls of academia, whenever the topic of Irish culture, language, music, literature—basically, anything Irish—is brought up, the words Celt and Celtic are bound to be heard. In modern-day English, those words are commonly used in reference to the Irish people and their widely-accepted traditions (of course everybody is Irish on St. Patrick's Day; the Celtic cross or knot is a popular tattoo; the Claddagh ring makes a nice gift). The \\k\\ pronunciation for Celt and Celtic dates to the 18th century. The \\k\\ pronunciation for Celt and Celtic dates to the 18th century. The \\k\\ pronunciation for Celt and Celtic dates to the 18th century. The etymology of the noun Celt—from which the adjective Celtic is derived—is straightforward. It's a 16th-century borrowing of the French word Celte, which itself is from Latin Celta, the singular of Celtae, which is the name for a member of an early Indo-European people from antiquity who spread over much of Europe from the British Isles and Spain to Asia Minor. The Latin name is derived from Greek Keltoi, and both the Latin and Greek words referred to the Gauls, the Celtic people who occupied the region that is now France and Belgium. See? Straightforward. With that history laid out, we're wondering how you pronounced all the capital 'c' and 'k' words, especially if you're unfamiliar with French, Latin, Greek, and even English Celt and Celtic, for that matter. The question: is the 'c' sounded \\s\\ or \\k\\? Following its French and Latin predecessors, early pronunciation of Celt was actually \\SELT\\. (In French and Latin, the 'c' is pronounced \\s\\, as in the last name of the French painter Paul Cézanne and in Latin century.) The pronunciation \\KELT\\ started being heard as early as the 18th century, which, in time, ushered in the variant spelling Kelt. The variants were introduced by language and history academics who believed that the pronunciation of Celt should reflect the initial \\k\\ sound in the ancient Greek Keltoi and the Classical Latin Celtae. (It wasn't until the Middle Ages that the letter 'c' in Latin began being pronounced before vowels as the combination \\ts\\—prior, it was pronounced \\k\\; English speakers subsequently reduced the Latin 'c' to a simple \\s\\.) Outside of academia, the variant Kelt never caught on, and it is rarely if ever used today; however, the \\k\\ pronunciation for Celt and Celtic has since flourished. Another influence on pronouncing Celt and Celtic with a soft 'c' is English's phonetic rule for 'c' when followed by 'e' (or 'i,' as in circus or Cicero), which says that, in such cases, the 'c' is usually pronounced as \\s\\. Think cell, cereal, ceiling, and dance. Nevertheless, English speakers, especially those who wanted to sound knowledgeable about things Celtic, grew to prefer the hard 'c' pronunciation, which harkened back to the words' ancient roots. From the 18th century onward, more and more people began sounding the words with an initial \\k\\. By the mid-20th century, \\k\\ became the norm, which is fitting since the pronunciation is in line with that of the Celtic family of languages that include Irish, Scottish Gaelic, Welsh, Breton, and the now-extinct (or, depending on who you talk to, nearly extinct) languages Manx and Cornish. Apparently, people appreciated the ethnic pronunciation. This shift in the pronunciation of Celt is fully evinced when comparing H. W. Fowler's 1926 Dictionary of Modern English with Robert Burchfield's 1996 revised edition. Here's what Fowler had to say about Celt(ic): \"The spelling C-, & the pronunciation s-, are the established ones, & no useful purpose seems to be served by the substitution of k-.\" Decades later, Burchfield observes a different trend: \"Except for the football club Celtic (in Glasgow), which is pronounced [SEL-tik], both Celt and Celtic are pronounced with initial \\k\\ in standard English.\" Burchfield is referring to the Scottish Celtic Football Club, founded in 1887. In America, there is basketball's Boston Celtics, founded in 1946, whose name is also pronounced with an initial \\s\\. The European away support that Celtic enjoys is phenomenal. Few clubs have a fanbase that travels in such numbers or makes as much noise, all the more remarkable when you consider the poor record that the club has away from home in recent times.— Liam Kelly, The Celtic Star, 20 Feb. 2020 Aside from this use of the initial soft 'c' in sports teams' names, Celtic with a hard 'c' is the standard; however, you might still sometimes hear the 'c' softly sounded by those who are uninitiated in the history and etymology of Celt and Celtic as well as those who are unfamiliar with the words and resort to the phonetic rules of English. (And, as happens so often in English, those phonetic rules let them down.) See Definitions and Examples » Get Word of the Day daily email! Learn a new word every day.

                "title": "NFL playoffs - Wikipedia",
                "content": "The National Football League (NFL) playoffs is the annual single-elimination tournament held to determine the league champion. The four-round tournament is held after the league's regular season. Since the 2020 season, seven teams from each of the league's two conferences qualify for the playoffs based on regular season winning percentage, with a tie-breaking procedure if required. The top team in each conference receives a first-round bye, automatically advancing to the next round. The tournament culminates in the Super Bowl, the league's championship game, competed between teams from each conference. NFL postseason history can be traced to the first NFL Championship Game in 1933, though in the early years, qualification for the game was based solely on regular-season records. From 1933 to 1966, the NFL postseason generally only consisted of the NFL Championship Game, which pitted the league's two division winners against each other (pending any one-game playoff matches that needed to be held to break ties in the division standings). In 1967, the playoffs were expanded to four teams (division winners). When the league completed its merger with the American Football League (AFL) in 1970, the playoffs were expanded to eight teams, which increased to ten in 1978, twelve in 1990, and fourteen in 2020. Among the four major professional sports leagues in the United States, the NFL postseason is the only one to use a single-elimination tournament in all of its rounds. The 32-team National Football League is divided into two conferences, the American Football Conference (AFC) and the National Football Conference (NFC). Since 2002, each conference has 16 teams and is further divided into four geographic divisions of four teams each. As of 2020, qualification into the playoffs works as follows:[2] If teams are tied (having the same regular season won-lost-tied record), the playoff seeding is determined by a set of tie-breaking rules.[3] The names of the first two playoff rounds date back to the postseason format that was first used in 1978, when the league added a second wild-card team to each conference. The first round of the playoffs is dubbed the wild-card round, wild-card weekend, or, since 2021, super wild-card weekend. In this round, the second-seeded division winner hosts the seventh-seeded wild card team, the third hosts the sixth, and the fourth hosts the fifth. There are no restrictions regarding teams from the same division matching up in any round. The team with the best overall record from each conference receives a first round bye, automatically advancing them to the second round, dubbed the divisional round, and hosts the lowest-remaining seed from the wild-card round. Meanwhile, the other two winners from that round play each other with the higher seeds hosting.[4] The two surviving teams from each conferences' divisional-round playoff games then meet in the respective AFC and NFC Conference Championship games, hosted by the higher-seeded team. The winners of those contests go on to face one another in the Super Bowl which is played at a predetermined site. The New York Giants and New York Jets have shared the same home stadium since 1984 (Giants Stadium from 1984 to 2009, and MetLife Stadium since 2010). Thus, if both teams need to host playoff games on the same weekend, they are required to play on different days, even during the Conference Championship round when both games are normally scheduled on the same day. The only time such a scheduling conflict occurred was during Wild Card weekend in 1985 when only 10 teams qualified for the postseason and there were only two wild-card games. Instead of playing both Wild Card games on the same day, as was the case when the 10-team system was used from 1978 to 1989, the Jets hosted their game on Saturday, December 28, before the Giants hosted their game on Sunday, December 29. This same scheduling conflict could occur for the Los Angeles Chargers and Los Angeles Rams, who began sharing SoFi Stadium in 2020. Often, teams will finish a season with identical records. It becomes necessary, therefore, to devise means to break these ties, either to determine which teams will qualify for the playoffs or to determine seeding in the playoff tournament. The rules below are applied in order until the tie is broken. Ties within divisions are always broken first to eliminate all but the highest-ranked club in each division before breaking ties between teams in different divisions, however, it should be emphasized that other than for division winners, divisional ranking is not in itself a tiebreaker – for example, if a division runner-up ties with teams finishing third and fourth in another division, the runner-up's record will be compared to the team awarded third place in the other division without regard to the teams' divisional finish. If three or four teams in one division are tied for the division title and/or division runner-up, and also if after breaking ties within divisions three or four teams in different divisions are tied, then should the one or two team(s) be qualified or eliminated at any step the tiebreaker reverts to step one for the remaining two or three teams. If multiple playoff spots are at stake, the rules are applied in order until the first team(s) qualify(ies) or are eliminated, then the process is started again for the remaining teams. Finally, once ties are broken between three or more teams qualifying for the playoffs, the relative positions of the seeds determined will not change regardless of wild card and divisional round results – for example, if division winners were to tie for the second, third and fourth seeds in a conference and the third and fourth seeds subsequently advanced to the conference championship game, the team that was originally awarded the third seed would host that game even if it lost a head-to-head tiebreaker against the fourth seed. The tie-breaking rules have changed over the years, with the most recent changes being made in 2002 to accommodate the league's realignment into eight four-team divisions; record vs. common opponents and most of the other criteria involving wins and losses were moved up higher in the tie-breaking list, while those involving compiled stats such as points for and against were moved to the bottom.[3][5] The current tiebreakers are as follows, with coin tosses or drawing of lots used if all of the criteria fail:[6] The NFL introduced overtime for any divisional tiebreaker games beginning in 1940 and for championship games beginning in 1946. The first postseason game to be played under these rules was the 1958 NFL Championship Game between the Baltimore Colts and New York Giants (the so-called \"Greatest Game Ever Played\"), decided by a one-yard touchdown run by Colts fullback Alan Ameche after eight minutes and fifteen seconds of extra time.[7][8] Overtime under the original format was sudden death, the first team to score would be declared the winner. In March 2010, the NFL amended its rules for postseason overtime,[9] with the rule being extended into the regular season in March 2012.[10] If a team scores a touchdown, or if the defense scores a safety on the (other team's) first possession, it is declared the winner. If it scores a field goal on its first possession, however, it then kicks off to the opposing team, which has an opportunity to score; if the score is tied again after that possession, true sudden death rules apply and whoever scores next will win. True sudden death rules would continue from double overtime hereafter.[9] The league further amended its postseason overtime rules in March 2022, allowing both teams to have at least one possession even if the first team with possession scores a touchdown.[11] Since postseason games cannot end in a tie, unlike the preseason or regular season, additional overtime periods are played as necessary until a winner is determined. Furthermore, all clock rules apply as if a game had started over. Therefore, if the first overtime period ends with the score still tied, the teams switch ends of the field before the second overtime. With two minutes to go in the second overtime, there would be a two-minute warning (but not during the first overtime period as in the regular season). If it were still tied at the end of the second overtime, the team that lost (or deferred) the coin toss before the first overtime would have the option to kick off, receive, or choose a side of the field to defend. However, unlike in the first overtime period, true sudden death rules would continue from the start of any third and subsequent overtime period. If a game reached a fifth overtime, another coin toss would be held and timing rules would be as if another game started over.[12] Although a contest could theoretically last indefinitely, or last several overtime periods like several National Hockey League postseason games, no NFL playoff game has ever gone past two overtime periods. The longest NFL overtime game played to date is 82 minutes, 40 seconds: Miami Dolphins kicker Garo Yepremian made the walk-off 37-yard field goal after 7:40 of the second overtime to defeat the Kansas City Chiefs, 27–24, in an AFC playoff game on December 25, 1971.[13][14][15] The NFL's method for determining its champions has changed over the years. From the league's founding in 1920 until 1932, there was no scheduled championship game. From 1920 to 1923, the championship was awarded to a team by a vote of team owners at the annual owners' meeting. From 1924 to 1932, the team having the best winning percentage was awarded the championship (the de facto standard owners had been using anyway). As each team played a different number of games, simply counting wins and losses would have been insufficient. Additionally, tie games were not counted in the standings in figuring winning percentage (under modern rules, ties count as ½ win and ½ loss). There was a head-to-head tiebreaker, which also was weighted toward the end of the season: for two teams that played each other twice, each winning once, the team winning the second game was determined to be the champion (the criteria used to decide the 1921 title).[17][18] In 1932, the Chicago Bears (6–1–6) and the Portsmouth Spartans (6–1–4) were tied at the end of the season with identical winning percentages (.857). Of note, the Green Bay Packers (10–3–1) had more wins, but a lower winning percentage (.769) as calculated under the rules of the day, which ignored ties. The Bears and Spartans had played to ties in both of their matchups, so the head-to-head tiebreaker did not apply. An additional game was therefore needed to determine a champion. It was agreed that the game would be played at Chicago's Wrigley Field, but severe winter weather and fear of a low turnout forced the game to be moved indoors to Chicago Stadium. The game was played under modified rules on a shortened 80-yard dirt field, and the Bears won with a final score of 9–0.[17][19] As a result of the game, the Bears had the better winning percentage (.875) and won the league title. The loss gave the Spartans a final winning percentage of .750 and moved them to third place behind the Packers. While there is no consensus that this game was a real \"championship\" game (or even a playoff game), it generated considerable interest and led to the creation of the official NFL Championship Game in 1933.[19] Given the interest of the impromptu \"championship game\", and the desire of the league to create a more equitable means of determining a champion, the league divided into two conferences beginning in 1933. The first-place teams in each conference met in the NFL Championship Game after the season. There was no tie-breaker system in place; any ties in the final standings of either conference resulted in playoff games in 1941, 1943, 1947, 1950 (2), 1952, 1957, 1958, and 1965. Since the venue and date of the championship game were often not known until the last game of the season had been played, these playoff games sometimes delayed the NFL title game by a week. The playoff structure used from 1933 to 1966 was considered inequitable by some because of the number of times it failed to match the teams with the two best records in the championship game, as only the conference winners would qualify for playoff contention. Four times between 1950 and 1966 (in 1951, 1956, 1960, and 1963) the team with the second-best win–loss record did not qualify for the playoffs while the team with the best record in the other conference, but only the third-best in the league, advanced to the championship game. During the 1960s, a third-place game was held in Miami, called the Playoff Bowl. It was contested in early January following the 1960–69 seasons. Though official playoff games at the time they were played, the NFL now officially classifies these ten games (and statistics) as exhibitions, not as playoff games.[20] During its brief history, the AAFC, which would merge into the NFL for the 1950 season, used an identical playoff format to the NFL from 1946 to 1948. In 1949 (its last year), the AAFC merged its two conferences when one of its teams folded, and used a four-team playoff system. In 1948, the aforementioned issue of playoff inequity came into play when the San Francisco 49ers would miss the playoffs with a 12–2 record; they were in the same conference as the 14–0 Cleveland Browns, who would go on to win the Western Conference and then the AAFC's championship game against the 7–7 Buffalo Bills (AAFC). For the 1960–68 seasons, the AFL used the two-divisional format identical to the NFL to determine its champion. There was no tie-breaker system in place, so ties atop the Eastern Division final standings in 1963 and Western Division in 1968 necessitated playoff games to determine each division's representative in the championship. In both years, the playoff winner went on the road for the AFL title game and lost. For 1969, the final season before its merger with the NFL, the AFL added a first-round whereby each division winner played the second-place team from the other division. The winners of these games met in the AFL Championship Game.[21] In the only year of this format, the AFL champion Kansas City Chiefs were the second-place team in the Western division and played both games on the road. They won Super Bowl IV in January and became the first division runner-up to win a Super Bowl.[22] The Super Bowl began as an inter-league championship game between the AFL and NFL, an idea first proposed by Kansas City Chiefs owner Lamar Hunt. This compromise was the result of pressures the upstart AFL was placing on the older NFL. The success of the rival league eventually led to a full merger of the two leagues.[17] From the 1966 season to the 1969 season (Super Bowls I–IV) the game featured the champions of the AFL and NFL. In 1967, the NFL expanded to 16 teams and split its two conferences into two divisions of four teams each. The four division champions advanced to the league's first guaranteed multi–game playoffs. To remain on schedule, a tie-breaker system was introduced. The first round determined the conference's champion and its representative in the NFL Championship Game, played the following week.[21] During the three years (1967–69) that this playoff structure was in effect, there was one use of the tie-breaker system. In 1967, the Los Angeles Rams and Baltimore Colts ended the season tied at 11–1–2 for the lead in the Coastal Division. The Colts came into the last game of the season undefeated but were beaten by the Rams. Though the Colts shared the best win–loss record in the NFL that year, they failed to advance to the playoffs while three other teams with worse records won their divisions. This event figured into the decision in 1970 to include a wild-card team in the playoff tournament after the AFL–NFL merger. When the leagues merged in 1970, the new NFL (with 26 teams) reorganized into two conferences—the National Football Conference (NFC) and the American Football Conference (AFC)—with three divisions each. From the 1970 season to the 1977 season, four teams from each conference (for a total of eight teams) qualified for the playoffs each year. These four teams included the three division champions, and a fourth wild-card team.[23] Originally, the home teams in the playoffs were decided based on a yearly rotation.[24][25] From 1970 to 1974, the divisional playoff round rotated which of the three division champions would have home-field advantage, with the wild-card team never having it; they and their opponents they faced in the divisional playoff game do not get home field advantage in the conference championship game. Starting in 1970, the divisional playoff games consisted of the AFC Central champions and the NFC West champions playing their games on the road. Then in 1971, it rotated to the AFC East champions and the NFC East champions playing their games on the road. In the 1972 divisional playoff games, the AFC West champions and the NFC Central champions were the visiting teams. And in 1973 it would start all over with the AFC Central and NFC West again, and again in 1974 with the AFC East champions and the NFC East champions playing their games on the road.[citation needed] The divisional playoff match-ups were pre-determined year by year. The designated division champion assigned to play on the road would travel to play the division champion from the same division as the wild card winner. The wild card team was only allowed to play their divisional rival in the conference championship, but not in the divisional playoffs. In some years the designated road team was from the same division as the wild card team. In that case, the designated divisional road team would play one of the two other division champions, depending on the probable matchups from the previous year. For example, in the 1971 divisional playoffs, the AFC Eastern division winner was assigned to play on the road. The reason they played the AFC Western division champion and not the Central division, is because the AFC Eastern division winner played host to the AFC Central division winner in the divisional playoffs from the previous year (1970). This idea was designed to rotate playoff matchups year by year and not repeat. However, the rotation system led to several playoff inequities, such as: The league instituted a seeding system for the playoffs in 1975, where the surviving clubs with the higher seeds were made the home teams for each playoff round.[17] Thus, the top-seeded division winner played the wild-card team, and the remaining two division winners played at the home stadium of the better seed, forcing the lowest-ranked division winner to open the postseason on the road. However, two teams from the same division could not meet before the conference championship game.[27] Thus, there would be times when the pairing in the divisional playoff round would be the 1 seed vs. the 3 seed and 2 vs. 4. Following an expansion of the regular season from 14 to 16 games in 1978, the league added one more wild-card team for each conference. The two wild-card teams played the week before the division winners. The winner of this game played the top-seeded division winner as was done from 1970 to 1977. However, the league continued to prohibit intra-divisional games in the divisional playoffs but allowed such contests in the wild-card round.[28][29][30] This ten-team playoff format was used through the 1989 season.[23] Under this system, the Oakland Raiders became the first wild-card team to win a Super Bowl following the 1980 season.[31] During the strike-shortened 1982 season, only nine regular-season games were played, and a modified playoff format was instituted. Divisional play was ignored (there were some cases where division rivals had both games wiped out by the strike, although each division ultimately sent at least one team to the playoffs), and the top eight teams from each conference (based on W-L-T record) were advanced to the playoffs. As a result, this became the first time that teams with losing records qualified for the playoffs: the 4–5 Cleveland Browns and the 4–5 Detroit Lions.[32] Several times between 1978 and 1989, the two wild-card games had to be played on different days. Normally they both would be held on Sunday. In 1983 and 1988, the games were split between Saturday and Monday because Sunday was Christmas, and the NFL had avoided playing on that day at the time. In 1984, both games were played in the Pacific Time Zone, so they had to be played on Saturday and Sunday to accommodate for time differences. In 1985, both the New York Giants and Jets hosted wild-card games. As they have shared a home stadium since 1984, the games had to be played on different days. For the 1990 season, a third wild-card team for each conference was added, expanding the playoffs to twelve teams. The lowest-seeded division winner was then \"demoted\" to the wild-card weekend as the home team. Also, the restrictions on intra-divisional games during the divisional playoffs were removed.[33][34][35][36] The 2001 season was the first with playoff games in prime time.[37] Thus, the league no longer had the same restrictions like in 1984 as to when to schedule games in the Pacific Time Zone. The 1990 format continued until the 2002 expansion and realignment into eight divisions. In this format, used until the 2019 season, the four division winners and two wild cards in both conferences are seeded 1–6, respectively, with the top two seeds receiving byes, and the highest seed in each round guaranteed to host the lowest seed.[23] A limitation of the 12-team format was that division winners, including one with a .500 regular season record or a losing season, could play a home playoff game against wild card teams who had superior regular season records. Home field advantage does not guarantee success, however; during the 2015–16 season, every road team won their respective Wild Card playoff game, the first such occurrence in NFL history.[38] Through 2019 however, NFL owners remained adamant that every division winner should still be rewarded with a home playoff game regardless of record.[39][40] Calls to expand the playoffs to 14 teams began in 2006. Proponents of expansion noted the increased revenue that could be gained from an additional two playoff games. They also noted that the 12-team playoff system was implemented when the league still had 28 teams, four fewer than the 2002 expansion. The opposition to such a move notes that an expansion of the playoffs would \"water down\" the field by giving access to lower-caliber teams. Opponents of expansion further point to the NBA playoffs and the NHL playoffs where more than half of the teams qualify for the postseason, and there is often a decreased emphasis on regular season performance as a result.[41][42] In October 2013, NFL commissioner Roger Goodell announced plans to revisit the idea to expand the playoffs to 14 teams, with the increased revenue gained from the two additional postseason games being used to offset plans to shorten the preseason.[43] The 14-team playoff proposal remained tabled until December 2014, when no team in the NFC South could finish better than .500; Goodell stated that the league would vote on it at the March 2015 Owners' Meetings. However, by February 2015, the Washington Post reported that support among team owners had eroded, and league leaders expressed reluctance to make a change until the end of the 2015 season.[44] The proposal then lost all interest by 2017.[45] The league eventually revisited and implemented the 14-team playoff format in 2020, placing a third wild-card team in each conference, and only giving the top seed a bye (as explained above).[46][47] Correct as of the end of the 2023 regular season (including 2023–24 playoff berths).

                "content": "The National Football League playoffs for the 2023 season began on January 13, 2024, and concluded with Super Bowl LVIII on February 11 at Allegiant Stadium in Paradise, Nevada with the Kansas City Chiefs defeating the San Francisco 49ers. This was the first postseason since 1998 not to feature either Peyton Manning or Tom Brady, as they both played their final NFL games in the 2015 and 2022 seasons, respectively. In the Wild Card round, the No. 7 seed Green Bay Packers defeated the No. 2 seed Dallas Cowboys, becoming the first No. 7 seed ever to win a playoff game since the introduction of the format in 2020. The Detroit Lions won their first playoff game since 1991 by defeating the Los Angeles Rams. This was the 15th consecutive NFL postseason in which at least one team scored at least 40 points in a game (done both by Houston and Green Bay). The Kansas City Chiefs became the first team to win back-to-back Super Bowls since the New England Patriots successfully did so in 2003 and 2004. They were also the first team to win the Super Bowl as a 3 seed since the 2006 Colts. In addition, it marked only the second Super Bowl to go into overtime, the other being Super Bowl LI in 2016–17. Within each conference, the four division winners and the top three non-division winners with the best overall regular season records qualified for the playoffs. The four division winners are seeded 1–4 based on their overall won-lost-tied record, and the wild card teams are seeded 5–7. The NFL does not use a fixed bracket playoff system, and there are no restrictions regarding teams from the same division matching up in any round. In the first round, dubbed the Wild Card playoffs or Super Wild Card Weekend, the second-seeded division winner hosts the seventh seed wild card, the third seed hosts the sixth seed, and the fourth seed hosts the fifth seed. The 1 seed from each conference receives a first-round bye. In the second round, the Divisional playoffs, the number 1 seed hosts the lowest-seeded surviving team from the first round (seed 4, 5, 6, or 7), while the other two surviving teams play each other, with the higher-seeded team hosting. The two surviving teams from each conference's divisional playoff games then meet in the respective AFC and NFC Conference Championships, hosted by the higher seed. Although the Super Bowl, the championship round of the playoffs, is played at a neutral site, the designated home team is based on an annual rotation by conference.[1] * Indicates overtime victory The playoffs began with Wild Card Weekend on January 13–15, 2024. The Divisional round was played on January 20–21, with the winners of those games advancing to the Conference Championship games on January 28. Super Bowl LVIII was played on February 11 at Allegiant Stadium in Paradise, Nevada.[2] at NRG Stadium, Houston, Texas First quarter Second quarter Third quarter Fourth quarter Top passers Top rushers Top receivers This was the first postseason meeting between the Browns and Texans. During the regular season, the Browns defeated the Texans 36–22 in Houston in Week 16. Deshaun Watson, who was the starting quarterback for Cleveland since 2022, suffered a season-ending injury in Week 10. He was the starting quarterback for Houston from 2017 to 2020. After a competitive first half that was led by the Texans, they took a commanding lead after the turn of the half, in which Joe Flacco threw back-to-back interceptions that were returned for touchdowns.[24] This was the Texans' first playoff win since the 2019 season. at Arrowhead Stadium, Kansas City, Missouri First quarter Second quarter Third quarter Fourth quarter Top passers Top rushers Top receivers This was the fourth postseason matchup between the Dolphins and Chiefs, with Miami winning all three previous contests. The most recent playoff meeting between these two teams was in the 1994–95 Wild Card round, which Miami won 27–17.[25] It was the first postseason clash between the two teams in Kansas City since Christmas Day 1971, which remains the longest NFL game played; the Dolphins won that game 27–24 after two overtime periods. During the regular season, the Chiefs defeated the Dolphins 21–14 in a neutral-site game in Frankfurt, Germany in Week 9. This was the first game where Dolphins receiver Tyreek Hill returned to Arrowhead Stadium since he left the Chiefs. With a kickoff temperature of −4 °F (−20 °C), this became the fourth coldest NFL game in history.[26] The game was dominated by Kansas City, whose defense held the league's top offense to just 7 points. With the Lions winning their playoff game against the Rams the next day, Miami became the team with the longest playoff game win drought.[27][28][29] With 28 million viewers watching, Peacock recorded their busiest day in history on January 13.[30] at AT&T Stadium, Arlington, Texas First quarter Second quarter Third quarter Fourth quarter Top passers Top rushers Top receivers Coming in as huge underdogs, the Packers stunned the Cowboys in dominating fashion and won 48–32. After getting the ball first after electing to receive the opening kickoff, the Packers drove 75 yards in almost 8 minutes, capping the drive with an Aaron Jones touchdown run from 3 yards out to go up 7–0. After the teams traded punts, cornerback Jaire Alexander intercepted a ball off of Dak Prescott deep in Cowboys' territory. At the beginning of the second quarter, the Packers cashed in on the turnover with another Aaron Jones touchdown run, which came from one yard out, to go up 14–0. Following a Cowboys' punt, the Packers drove 93 yards and capped it when Dontayvion Wicks caught a 20-yard touchdown pass from Jordan Love, although the extra point was missed, leaving the score at 20–0. On the next drive, Prescott threw another interception that was returned 64 yards for a touchdown by Darnell Savage with 1:50 remaining in the 1st half to extend the Packers' lead to 27–0. The Cowboys did rebound to score a touchdown on the last play of the half when Jake Ferguson caught a 1-yard pass from Prescott, cutting the lead to 27–7. In the second half, the Packers extended their lead to 32 points, 48–16, with 10:23 left in the 4th quarter, before the Cowboys scored back-to-back touchdowns and two successful 2-point conversions to reduce the deficit to 16 points. However, the Cowboys eventually turned the ball over on downs on their last drive with less than 20 seconds left, sealing the Packers' victory. With the win, the Packers improved to 6–0 at AT&T Stadium all-time (including their win in Super Bowl XLV) and became the first seventh seed to beat a second seed since the playoffs expanded to 14 teams in the 2020 season. Conversely, the Cowboys became the first second seed to lose against a seventh seed since it expanded to 14 teams in the 2020 and it snapped the Cowboys' 16-game home win streak.[31] This was the ninth overall postseason matchup in the rivalry between the Cowboys and Packers. The postseason series between the two teams had been tied 4–4, with the most recent meeting being in the 2016 NFC Divisional Playoffs, which the Packers won 34–31 in Arlington.[32] The teams did not meet in the 2023 regular season. at Ford Field, Detroit, Michigan First quarter Second quarter Third quarter Fourth quarter Top passers Top rushers Top receivers This was the second overall postseason meeting between the Rams and Lions. The first came in the 1952 National Conference Championship, which the Lions won 31–21 in Detroit.[33] It was the Lions' first home playoff game since 1993 and only their third since winning their last NFL title in 1957. It was also their first playoff game at Ford Field.[34] This game was also notable for being the first postseason clash between Matthew Stafford and Jared Goff, the starting quarterbacks for the Rams and Lions respectively. Each had previously played for the other team before being traded for each other prior to the 2021 season.[35] The Rams and Lions did not meet during the regular season. The Lions wound up victorious by a final score of 24–23, their first victory in a postseason game since 1991 and only their second in the Super Bowl era.[27][36] In his first game in Detroit as an opposing player, Stafford completed 25 of 36 passes for 367 yards and two touchdowns. Meanwhile, Goff completed 22 of 27 passes for 277 yards and a touchdown. Los Angeles Pro Bowl receiver Puka Nacua set a rookie record for receiving yards in a postseason game with nine catches for 181 receiving yards while also scoring a touchdown. Amon-Ra St. Brown was Detroit's leading receiver with seven catches for 110 receiving yards. Although neither team turned the ball over, the Rams were undone by an ineffective red zone offense: zero touchdowns in three red zone trips, while Detroit converted all three of its red zone trips into touchdowns.[37] With this victory, the Lions no longer had fewer playoff victories in their own stadium than another NFL team, as they equaled the Pittsburgh Steelers who had won Super Bowl XL at Ford Field. The victory, combined with the #2-seeded Cowboys' loss to the Packers earlier that day, also meant that the Lions would host two games in a single postseason for the first time in franchise history. This was the first time a team from Detroit advanced in a postseason since 2013, when the Detroit Tigers won an ALDS matchup against the Oakland Athletics.[citation needed] at Highmark Stadium, Orchard Park, New York First quarter Second quarter Third quarter Fourth quarter Top passers Top rushers Top receivers This was the fourth playoff matchup between these two teams; Pittsburgh won two out of the first three. The most recent playoff meeting occurred during the Divisional Round of the 1995–96 postseason, which Pittsburgh won 40–21.[38] The Steelers and Bills did not meet during the regular season. The game was originally scheduled to be played on January 14 at 1:05 p.m. EST, but was delayed due to a state of emergency and travel ban declared in Western New York as a result of a massive snowstorm, marking the first time an NFL playoff game was postponed since the 2016–17 playoffs, a game that also featured the Steelers.[39][11] The first half was dominated by Buffalo, with a Josh Allen touchdown pass to both Dawson Knox and Dalton Kincaid respectively. Allen also had a career-long and franchise playoff record 52-yard touchdown run to put the Bills up 21–0. The Steelers made it a closer game in the second half, getting as close as 24–17 off of a blocked field goal and several touchdowns, before the Bills took a two-score lead on a Khalil Shakir touchdown grab to secure the victory, 31–17.[40] at Raymond James Stadium, Tampa, Florida First quarter Second quarter Third quarter Fourth quarter Top passers Top rushers Top receivers This was the sixth postseason meeting between the Eagles and Buccaneers, with the Buccaneers winning three of the previous five. The most recent postseason meeting between two teams came in the 2021 NFC Wild Card Game, which the Buccaneers won 31–15 in Tampa. In the regular season, the Eagles defeated the Buccaneers in Tampa by a score of 25–11 during Week 3.[41] This would end up being Jason Kelce's final game before his retirement a month later. The Buccaneers made the only scoring plays in the first quarter, off a Chase McLaughlin field goal and David Moore touchdown for 10 unanswered points. The Buccaneers and Eagles traded field goals in the second quarter, after which Dallas Goedert scored a touchdown for Philadelphia. The Eagles attempted a two-point conversion using their signature \"tush push\", but the Buccaneers were able to pull them away. Tampa Bay's defense prevented the Eagles from scoring for the rest of the game, with the Buccaneers scoring two times in the third quarter off a safety on Jalen Hurts and a touchdown from Trey Palmer, in which the Eagles' poor tackling efforts facilitated his 56-yard run to the end zone. Chris Godwin scored a touchdown for Tampa Bay in the fourth quarter as the Buccaneers completed their 23-point blowout of the defending NFC Champions.[42] This was the first time that a team seeded below No. 2 (in this case, the No. 3 Detroit Lions) has hosted a divisional playoff game. at M&T Bank Stadium, Baltimore, Maryland First quarter Second quarter Third quarter Fourth quarter Top passers Top rushers Top receivers This was the second postseason meeting between the Ravens and Texans. The Ravens won the first matchup, the 2011 AFC Divisional Game, by a score of 20–13 in Baltimore. In the regular season, the Ravens defeated the Texans by a score of 25–9 in Baltimore in Week 1. Despite a ragged offensive start in the first half, the Ravens outscored the Texans 24–0 in the second half and advanced to their first AFC Championship game since 2012 with a 34–10 rout. Though not getting a takeaway nor recording a sack on rookie quarterback C. J. Stroud, the Ravens defense dominated Houston. They did not allow any offensive plays by Houston inside the Ravens' 25 yard line nor gave up an offensive touchdown. Houston's only points came by a field goal and a punt return touchdown in the first half. The Baltimore crowd noise also caused a litany of Houston pre-snap penalties. Lamar Jackson had two passing touchdowns and two rushing touchdowns as he improved to 2–3 in playoff games and 1–2 in home playoff games. This was also the Ravens' first home playoff win since the 2012 AFC Wild Card round. at Levi's Stadium, Santa Clara, California First quarter Second quarter Third quarter Fourth quarter Top passers Top rushers Top receivers After losing Deebo Samuel to injury early in the first quarter, the 49ers narrowly edged out the Packers 24–21. The Packers trailed the 49ers 7–6 at halftime. However, in the third quarter, the Packers benefited off a 41-yard pass interference penalty on Ambry Thomas and a 73-yard kickoff return from Keisean Nixon, leading to two touchdowns and a successful two-point conversion to take a 21–14 lead heading into the fourth quarter. Following a field goal from Jake Moody, Anders Carlson missed a 41-yard field goal with six minutes left in the game, and the 49ers were able to capitalize on the opportunity as Brock Purdy led his team on a game-winning drive. Although he had a sluggish performance throughout the game, Purdy completed 6-of-7 passes on the drive before Christian McCaffrey delivered the game-winning touchdown. With a minute left on the clock, Jordan Love attempted a final drive but was intercepted by Dre Greenlaw to seal the 49ers' third consecutive NFC Championship Game appearance (and their fourth in the last five seasons). Greenlaw caught Love's two interceptions of the night. The 49ers got their first win when they entered the fourth quarter trailing by five points or more under head coach Kyle Shanahan.[43] This was the tenth postseason meeting in the rivalry between the Packers and 49ers, an NFL record for the most playoff matches between two teams.[44] The most recent postseason matchup came in the 2021 NFC Divisional Game, which the 49ers won 13–10 in Green Bay. The 49ers and Packers did not meet in the regular season. Additionally, this was also the first-ever 1 seed v 7 seed playoff matchup in NFL history. at Ford Field, Detroit, Michigan First quarter Second quarter Third quarter Fourth quarter Top passers Top rushers Top receivers This was the second postseason meeting between the Buccaneers and Lions. The Buccaneers won the first meeting, which came in the 1997 NFC Wild Card Game, by a score of 20–10 at Houlihan's Stadium in Tampa. In the regular season, the Lions won the meeting between the two teams by a score of 20–6 in Week 6 in Tampa. After a mostly back-and-forth affair through the first three quarters, Detroit built up to a 31–17 late in the fourth quarter. However, after a Buccaneers touchdown and defensive stop, the Buccaneers had the ball down by 8 points. However, Derrick Barnes intercepted Mayfield with 1:39 remaining to seal a Lions victory. The Lions advanced to the NFC Championship Game for the first time since 1991.[45] This marked the first time since 1957 that the Lions won two playoff games in a season. For the second week in a row, the crowd broke a decibel record at Ford Field.[46] at Highmark Stadium, Orchard Park, New York First quarter Second quarter Third quarter Fourth quarter Top passers Top rushers Top receivers This was the sixth postseason meeting in the rivalry between the Bills and Chiefs. The Chiefs lead the postseason series 4–2 against the Bills. The last meeting between the two came in the 2021 AFC Divisional Game, which the Chiefs won 42–36 in overtime in Kansas City after the Chiefs offense drove down the field in the final 13 seconds of regulation to score the game–tying field goal. In the regular season, the Bills defeated the Chiefs 20–17 in Kansas City during Week 14.[47] In the highly anticipated game, the teams traded the lead five times. After the fifth lead change, in which the Chiefs scored a touchdown to take a three-point lead, the Bills attempted a fake punt after failing to pick up a first down after three tries on the ensuing series, but it failed. A play later, Kansas City advanced the ball down to Buffalo's 3-yard line with a great opportunity to extend their lead to two scores. However, Kansas City wide receiver Mecole Hardman fumbled the ball out the side of the end zone for a touchback, thus allowing Buffalo to regain possession and remain in the game. After the teams traded punts, the Bills advanced the ball into Kansas City territory, but their drive stalled in field goal range. In a play that evoked memories of the missed game-winning field goal attempt by Scott Norwood in Super Bowl XXV, Buffalo kicker Tyler Bass proceeded to miss his field goal attempt wide right, thus allowing Kansas City to take over with their three-point lead still intact. Kansas City then picked up a first down on their next possession to drain the clock and seal the victory.[48] For the Bills, this was their third consecutive exit in the divisional round.[49] The loss also snapped Buffalo's six-game win streak, which coincidentally began with a win over the Chiefs on December 10.[50] With 58 regular season wins in the past 5 season for the Bills, the loss also tied them with the New Orleans Saints from 2017 to 2021 with the most regular season wins in a five-year period to not make the Super Bowl.[51] The game drew the most average viewers of any divisional round game in history, with an average of 50.4 million viewers and a peak of 56.3 million viewers. The previous record of 48.5 million average viewers was established in the Packers-Cowboys game in the 2016–17 NFL playoffs.[52] The game also became the most streamed event in Paramount+ history.[53] Per an annual rotation used by the NFL since 1997 and made official in 2002, the AFC Championship Game was the first game being played at 3:05 p.m. EST, followed by the NFC Championship Game at 6:40 p.m. EST. at M&T Bank Stadium, Baltimore, Maryland First quarter Second quarter Third quarter Fourth quarter Top passers Top rushers Top receivers This was the first time the Baltimore Ravens have hosted an AFC Championship Game in franchise history. Additionally, this was the first AFC Championship since 2017 not hosted by the Kansas City Chiefs.[54] This is also the sixth straight AFC Championship Game appearance for the Chiefs.[55][56] This was also the second postseason meeting between the Chiefs and Ravens. The first meeting came in the 2010 AFC Wild Card, which the Ravens won 30–7 in Kansas City. The two teams did not meet in the regular season. The Chiefs attained a 17–7 lead at halftime off two touchdowns, one from Travis Kelce and one from Isiah Pacheco, as well as a 52-yard field goal from Harrison Butker, as the Ravens only managed one touchdown. At the end of a scoreless third quarter, Lamar Jackson threw a 54-yard pass to Zay Flowers, who was then called for a 15-yard penalty after taunting over L'Jarius Sneed. As the drive carried over into the fourth quarter, Flowers received a pass from Jackson near the end zone, but Sneed forced a fumble for a touchback. The next Ravens drive reached the red zone, but ended in an interception by Deon Bush as Jackson attempted a pass to a triple-covered Isaiah Likely. This game averaged 55.5 million viewers with a peak of 64 million viewers becoming the most viewed AFC championship game in history, as well as the most watched non-Super Bowl CBS program since the 1994 Winter Olympics.[57] at Levi's Stadium, Santa Clara, California First quarter Second quarter Third quarter Fourth quarter Top passers Top rushers Top receivers This was the third postseason meeting between the 49ers and Lions. The postseason series had been split 1–1 between the two teams. The most recent postseason matchup between the two came in the 1983 NFC Divisional Round, which the 49ers won 24–23 at Candlestick Park in San Francisco. The 49ers and Lions did not meet in the regular season. This was the second NFC Championship appearance for the Lions and first since 1991, in which they lost to the Washington Redskins. This was the third straight season and fourth time in the last five seasons that the 49ers reached the NFC Championship Game. The Lions started off with an explosive offensive push that saw them score a touchdown within the first two minutes of the game; they would score two more touchdowns and a field goal, as well as the defense forcing an interception on Purdy, to take a 24–7 lead at halftime. Although the 49ers' only managed a Christian McCaffrey touchdown in the first half, they proceeded to score 27 unanswered points off of huge plays: a 51-yard pass from Brock Purdy was recovered by Brandon Aiyuk as it deflected off Kindle Vildor's helmet on a touchdown drive, which was immediately followed by a fumble recovery off of Jahmyr Gibbs that the 49ers converted into another touchdown drive. They also benefitted from a Josh Reynolds drop on fourth and two from the 49ers 28-yard line,[58] midway through the third quarter. In the fourth quarter, the Lions unsuccessfully attempted a fourth down conversion instead of going for a field goal, proving costly as the Lions would ultimately lose by three points. Both the 49ers and Lions got touchdowns after that point, but the Lions onside kick attempt with 56 seconds left was unsuccessful, allowing the 49ers to win. After the game, people criticized Lions head coach Dan Campbell for opting to go for it on multiple fourth downs, but he defended the decisions.[59] The 24–7 halftime lead blown by the Lions mirrors a 49ers' 24–7 halftime blown lead in the 1957 NFL Western Conference Championship game against the Lions, who later went on to win the 1957 NFL Championship Game against the Browns. The Lions’ collapse in the NFC Championship entered football lore as part of the Curse of Bobby Layne superstition used to explain the Lions' championship drought since 1957.[60][61] In addition, the 17-point comeback tied for the largest comeback in NFC Championship history.[62] at Allegiant Stadium, Paradise, Nevada[c] First quarter Second quarter Third quarter Fourth quarter Overtime Top passers Top rushers Top receivers This was the second meeting in the Super Bowl between the Chiefs and the 49ers. The Chiefs and 49ers previously met in Super Bowl LIV in 2019, which the Chiefs won 31–20 in Miami to win their first of two Super Bowls in the Andy Reid era and first overall since Super Bowl IV in 1969. The 49ers sought their first Super Bowl victory since 1994 and their sixth overall, which would have tied them for first with the Pittsburgh Steelers and New England Patriots. The Chiefs won the game in overtime with a pass from Patrick Mahomes to Mecole Hardman. The Chiefs became the first team to win consecutive Super Bowls since the Patriots did so in 2003 and 2004. Three of the Wild Card games aired on NBC this postseason, which held the rights to the Saturday afternoon game under its annual rotation with CBS and Fox since 2020, the Sunday night game under the third year of a separate seven-year deal, and the Saturday night game, which was streamed exclusively by Peacock under a one-year deal.[a] Peacock's game was sold on a stand-alone basis, as the league separated it from the broader TV rights deals that began this season.[64][65][66] This marked the first time that an NFL playoff game was exclusively carried nationally by a streaming platform.[67][68][69] ESPN entered its third year of their five-year deal for the Monday night Wild Card game, which was simulcast on ABC and the Manningcast alternative telecast on ESPN2.[70][71][72] The remaining two afternoon games were carried by CBS and Fox.[70][71][73][74] Under the new TV deals, the four broadcast television partners will now each air one Divisional Playoff game per season, with ESPN/ABC took over that slot that was previously rotated between CBS and Fox.[70][75] CBS and Fox retained the exclusive rights to broadcast the AFC and NFC Championship Games, respectively.[74] CBS televised Super Bowl LVIII this season, to be followed by Fox, NBC, and ESPN/ABC under a new annual Super Bowl rotation.[70][76] Nickelodeon also had a youth-friendly broadcast of the game.[77] CBS also has sub-licensed the Spanish-language rights for Super Bowl LVIII to TelevisaUnivision, replacing ESPN Deportes, who held the agreement for the three previous Super Bowl games aired by CBS.[76] In addition to having exclusive coverage of the Saturday night Wild Card game, Peacock also streamed NBC's other games. All of CBS' games streamed on Paramount+, and all ESPN/ABC's games streamed on ESPN+.[70][74] The league's streaming service NFL+ streamed every postseason game on mobile devices only, regardless of broadcaster.[78] Prior the 2023 season, DAZN signed a ten-year agreement to distribute the NFL Game Pass International service, which offered live NFL playoff games.[79] In select countries, the NFL has also signed local media rights deals as follows:",

In the American Conference (AFC), there are already five teams qualified for the postseason, although the places that each team will occupy are yet to be defined. The same goes for the National Conference (NFC), where there are still three playoff spots up for grabs. Related: In the AFC, the Chiefs, Bills, Ravens, Texans, Steelers and Chargers already have their tickets secured to play beyond the first week of 2025, although the final positions are not defined. The Chiefs (15-1) have already secured the West Division title and the best seed in the AFC, which means playing all the playoffs at home and also resting during the Wild Card Game week. The Buffalo Bills (13-3) have the second-best record in the AFC, after having won the AFC East a few weeks ago. The Texans (9-7) are already the AFC South champions and will practically make the playoffs with the fourth seed in the sector. The real fight in the AFC is in the North Division, with Baltimore Ravens (11-5) and Pittsburgh Steelers (10-6). The last ticket is currently held by the Denver Broncos (9-7), but the Miami Dolphins and Bengals, both 8-8, can still pull off a miracle.

If they achieve this, both teams would fight for everything in a direct duel in Week 18. Eagles, Rams, Green Bay Packers and Comanders already have a ticket to the playoffs as well. The Eagles (13-3) are the NFC East champions, while the Los Angeles Rams (10-6) have secured the NFC West. The Atlanta Falcons (8-8) still have a slight hope of snatching the NFC South title from the Tampa Bay Buccaneers for the last spot in the playoffs.
