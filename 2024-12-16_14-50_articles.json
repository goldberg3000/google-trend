                "content": "The lion (Panthera leo) is a large cat of the genus Panthera, native to Africa and India. It has a muscular, broad-chested body; a short, rounded head; round ears; and a dark, hairy tuft at the tip of its tail. It is sexually dimorphic; adult male lions are larger than females and have a prominent mane. It is a social species, forming groups called prides. A lion's pride consists of a few adult males, related females, and cubs. Groups of female lions usually hunt together, preying mostly on medium-sized and large ungulates. The lion is an apex and keystone predator. The lion inhabits grasslands, savannahs, and shrublands. It is usually more diurnal than other wild cats, but when persecuted, it adapts to being active at night and at twilight. During the Neolithic period, the lion ranged throughout Africa and Eurasia, from Southeast Europe to India, but it has been reduced to fragmented populations in sub-Saharan Africa and one population in western India. It has been listed as Vulnerable on the IUCN Red List since 1996 because populations in African countries have declined by about 43% since the early 1990s. Lion populations are untenable outside designated protected areas. Although the cause of the decline is not fully understood, habitat loss and conflicts with humans are the greatest causes for concern. One of the most widely recognised animal symbols in human culture, the lion has been extensively depicted in sculptures and paintings, on national flags, and in literature and films. Lions have been kept in menageries since the time of the Roman Empire and have been a key species sought for exhibition in zoological gardens across the world since the late 18th century. Cultural depictions of lions were prominent in Ancient Egypt, and depictions have occurred in virtually all ancient and medieval cultures in the lion's historic and current range. The English word lion is derived via Anglo-Norman liun from Latin leōnem (nominative: leō), which in turn was a borrowing from Ancient Greek λέων léōn. The Hebrew word לָבִיא lavi may also be related.[4] The generic name Panthera is traceable to the classical Latin word 'panthēra' and the ancient Greek word πάνθηρ 'panther'.[5] Felis leo was the scientific name used by Carl Linnaeus in 1758, who described the lion in his work Systema Naturae.[3] The genus name Panthera was coined by Lorenz Oken in 1816.[10] Between the mid-18th and mid-20th centuries, 26 lion specimens were described and proposed as subspecies, of which 11 were recognised as valid in 2005.[1] They were distinguished mostly by the size and colour of their manes and skins.[11] In the 19th and 20th centuries, several lion type specimens were described and proposed as subspecies, with about a dozen recognised as valid taxa until 2017.[1] Between 2008 and 2016, IUCN Red List assessors used only two subspecific names: P. l. leo for African lion populations, and P. l. persica for the Asiatic lion population.[2][12][13] In 2017, the Cat Classification Task Force of the Cat Specialist Group revised lion taxonomy, and recognises two subspecies based on results of several phylogeographic studies on lion evolution, namely:[14] However, there seems to be some degree of overlap between both groups in northern Central Africa. DNA analysis from a more recent study indicates that Central African lions are derived from both northern and southern lions, as they cluster with P. leo leo in mtDNA-based phylogenies whereas their genomic DNA indicates a closer relationship with P. leo melanochaita.[17] Lion samples from some parts of the Ethiopian Highlands cluster genetically with those from Cameroon and Chad, while lions from other areas of Ethiopia cluster with samples from East Africa. Researchers, therefore, assume Ethiopia is a contact zone between the two subspecies.[18] Genome-wide data of a wild-born historical lion sample from Sudan showed that it clustered with P. l. leo in mtDNA-based phylogenies, but with a high affinity to P. l. melanochaita. This result suggested that the taxonomic position of lions in Central Africa may require revision.[19] Other lion subspecies or sister species to the modern lion existed in prehistoric times:[20] The Panthera lineage is estimated to have genetically diverged from the common ancestor of the Felidae around 9.32 to 4.47 million years ago to 11.75 to 0.97 million years ago.[6][32][33] Results of analyses differ in the phylogenetic relationship of the lion; it was thought to form a sister group with the jaguar that diverged 3.46 to 1.22 million years ago,[6] but also with the leopard that diverged 3.1 to 1.95 million years ago[8][9] to 4.32 to 0.02 million years ago. Hybridisation between lion and snow leopard ancestors possibly continued until about 2.1 million years ago.[33] The lion-leopard clade was distributed in the Asian and African Palearctic since at least the early Pliocene.[34] The earliest fossils recognisable as lions were found at Olduvai Gorge in Tanzania and are estimated to be up to 2 million years old.[32] Estimates for the divergence time of the modern and cave lion lineages range from 529,000 to 392,000 years ago based on mutation rate per generation time of the modern lion. There is no evidence for gene flow between the two lineages, indicating that they did not share the same geographic area.[19] The Eurasian and American cave lions became extinct at the end of the last glacial period without mitochondrial descendants on other continents.[27][35][36] The modern lion was probably widely distributed in Africa during the Middle Pleistocene and started to diverge in sub-Saharan Africa during the Late Pleistocene. Lion populations in East and Southern Africa became separated from populations in West and North Africa when the equatorial rainforest expanded 183,500 to 81,800 years ago.[37] They shared a common ancestor probably between 98,000 and 52,000 years ago.[19] Due to the expansion of the Sahara between 83,100 and 26,600 years ago, lion populations in West and North Africa became separated. As the rainforest decreased and thus gave rise to more open habitats, lions moved from West to Central Africa. Lions from North Africa dispersed to southern Europe and Asia between 38,800 and 8,300 years ago.[37] Extinction of lions in southern Europe, North Africa and the Middle East interrupted gene flow between lion populations in Asia and Africa. Genetic evidence revealed numerous mutations in lion samples from East and Southern Africa, which indicates that this group has a longer evolutionary history than genetically less diverse lion samples from Asia and West and Central Africa.[38] A whole genome-wide sequence of lion samples showed that samples from West Africa shared alleles with samples from Southern Africa, and samples from Central Africa shared alleles with samples from Asia. This phenomenon indicates that Central Africa was a melting pot of lion populations after they had become isolated, possibly migrating through corridors in the Nile Basin during the early Holocene.[19] In zoos, lions have been bred with tigers to create hybrids for the curiosity of visitors or for scientific purpose.[39][40] The liger is bigger than a lion and a tiger, whereas most tigons are relatively small compared to their parents because of reciprocal gene effects.[41][42] The leopon is a hybrid between a lion and leopard.[43] The lion is a muscular, broad-chested cat with a short, rounded head, a reduced neck, and round ears; males have broader heads. The fur varies in colour from light buff to silvery grey, yellowish red, and dark brown. The colours of the underparts are generally lighter. A new-born lion has dark spots, which fade as the cub reaches adulthood, although faint spots may still be seen on the legs and underparts.[44][45] The tail of all lions ends in a dark, hairy tuft that, in some lions, conceals an approximately 5 mm (0.20 in)-long, hard \"spine\" or \"spur\" composed of dermal papillae.[46] The functions of the spur are unknown. The tuft is absent at birth and develops at around 5+1⁄2 months of age. It is readily identifiable at the age of seven months.[47] Its skull is very similar to that of the tiger, although the frontal region is usually more depressed and flattened and has a slightly shorter postorbital region and broader nasal openings than those of the tiger. Due to the amount of skull variation in the two species, usually only the structure of the lower jaw can be used as a reliable indicator of species.[48][49] The skeletal muscles of the lion make up 58.8% of its body weight and represent the highest percentage of muscles among mammals.[50][51] The lion has a high concentration of fast twitch muscle fibres, giving them quick bursts of speed but less stamina.[52][53] Among felids, the lion is second only to the tiger in size.[45] The size and weight of adult lions vary across its range and habitats.[54][55][56][57] Accounts of a few individuals that were larger than average exist from Africa and India.[44][58][59][60] The male lion's mane is the most recognisable feature of the species.[11] It may have evolved around 320,000–190,000 years ago.[62] It grows downwards and backwards, covering most of the head, neck, shoulders, and chest. The mane is typically brownish and tinged with yellow, rust, and black hairs.[45] Mutations in the genes microphthalmia-associated transcription factor and tyrosinase are possibly responsible for the colour of manes.[63][64] It starts growing when lions enter adolescence, when testosterone levels increase, and reach their full size at around four years old.[65] Cool ambient temperatures in European and North American zoos may result in a heavier mane.[66] On average, Asiatic lions have sparser manes than African lions.[67] This feature likely evolved to signal the fitness of males to females. Males with darker manes appear to have greater reproductive success and are more likely to remain in a pride for longer. They have longer and thicker hair and higher testosterone levels, but they are also more vulnerable to heat stress.[68][69] The core body temperature does apparently not increase regardless of sex, season, feeding time, length and colour of mane, but only surface temperature is affected.[70] Unlike in other felid species, female lions consistently interact with multiple males at once.[71] Another hypothesis suggests that the mane also serves to protect the neck in fights, but this is disputed.[72][73] During fights, including those involving maneless females and adolescents, the neck is not targeted as much as the face, back, and hindquarters. Injured lions also begin to lose their manes.[74] Almost all male lions in Pendjari National Park are either maneless or have very short manes.[75] Maneless lions have also been reported in Senegal, in Sudan's Dinder National Park and in Tsavo East National Park, Kenya.[76] Castrated lions often have little to no mane because the removal of the gonads inhibits testosterone production.[77] Rarely, both wild and captive lionesses have manes.[78][79] Increased testosterone may be the cause of maned lionesses reported in northern Botswana.[80] The white lion is a rare morph with a genetic condition called leucism, which is caused by a double recessive allele. It is not albino; it has normal pigmentation in the eyes and skin. White lions have occasionally been encountered in and around Kruger National Park and the adjacent Timbavati Private Game Reserve in eastern South Africa. They were removed from the wild in the 1970s, thus decreasing the white lion gene pool. Nevertheless, 17 births have been recorded in five prides between 2007 and 2015.[81] White lions are selected for breeding in captivity.[82] They have reportedly been bred in camps in South Africa for use as trophies to be killed during canned hunts.[83] African lions live in scattered populations across sub-Saharan Africa. The lion prefers grassy plains and savannahs, scrub bordering rivers, and open woodlands with bushes. It rarely enters closed forests. On Mount Elgon, the lion has been recorded up to an elevation of 3,600 m (11,800 ft) and close to the snow line on Mount Kenya.[44] Savannahs with an annual rainfall of 300 to 1,500 mm (12 to 59 in) make up the majority of lion habitat in Africa, estimated at 3,390,821 km2 (1,309,203 sq mi) at most, but remnant populations are also present in tropical moist forests in West Africa and montane forests in East Africa.[84] The Asiatic lion now survives only in and around Gir National Park in Gujarat, western India. Its habitat is a mixture of dry savannah forest and very dry, deciduous scrub forest.[12] In Africa, the range of the lion originally spanned most of the central African rainforest zone and the Sahara desert.[85] In the 1960s, it became extinct in North Africa, except in the southern part of Sudan.[86][84][87] During the mid-Holocene, around 8,000-6,000 years ago, the range of lions expanded into Southeastern and Eastern Europe, partially re-occupying the range of the now extinct cave lion.[88] In Hungary, the modern lion was present from about 4,500 to 3,200 years Before Present.[89] In Ukraine, the modern lion was present from about 6,400 to 2,000 years Before Present.[88] In Greece, it was common, as reported by Herodotus in 480 BC; it was considered rare by 300 BC and extirpated by AD 100.[44] In Asia the lion once ranged in regions where climatic conditions supported an abundance of prey.[90] It was present in the Caucasus until the 10th century.[49] It lived in Palestine until the Middle Ages and in Southwest Asia until the late 19th century. By the late 19th century, it had been extirpated in most of Turkey.[91] The last live lion in Iran was sighted in 1942, about 65 km (40 mi) northwest of Dezful,[92] although the corpse of a lioness was found on the banks of the Karun river in Khuzestan province in 1944.[93] It once ranged from Sind and Punjab in Pakistan to Bengal and the Narmada River in central India.[94] Lions spend much of their time resting; they are inactive for about twenty hours per day.[95] Although lions can be active at any time, their activity generally peaks after dusk with a period of socialising, grooming, and defecating. Intermittent bursts of activity continue until dawn, when hunting most often takes place. They spend an average of two hours a day walking and fifty minutes eating.[96] The lion is the most social of all wild felid species, living in groups of related individuals with their offspring. Such a group is called a \"pride\". Groups of male lions are called \"coalitions\".[97] Females form the stable social unit in a pride and do not tolerate outside females.[98] The majority of females remain in their birth prides while all males and some females will disperse.[99] The average pride consists of around 15 lions, including several adult females and up to four males and their cubs of both sexes. Large prides, consisting of up to 30 individuals, have been observed.[100] The sole exception to this pattern is the Tsavo lion pride that always has just one adult male.[101] Prides act as fission–fusion societies, and members will split into subgroups that keep in contact with roars.[102] Nomadic lions range widely and move around sporadically, either in pairs or alone.[97] Pairs are more frequent among related males. A lion may switch lifestyles; nomads can become residents and vice versa.[103] Interactions between prides and nomads tend to be hostile, although pride females in estrus allow nomadic males to approach them.[104] Males spend years in a nomadic phase before gaining residence in a pride.[105] A study undertaken in the Serengeti National Park revealed that nomadic coalitions gain residency at between 3.5 and 7.3 years of age.[106] In Kruger National Park, dispersing male lions move more than 25 km (16 mi) away from their natal pride in search of their own territory. Female lions stay closer to their natal pride. Therefore, female lions in an area are more closely related to each other than male lions in the same area.[107] The evolution of sociability in lions was likely driven both by high population density and the clumped resources of savannah habitats. The larger the pride, the more high-quality territory they can defend; \"hotspots\" being near river confluences, where the cats have better access to water, prey and shelter (via vegetation).[108][109] The area occupied by a pride is called a \"pride area\" whereas that occupied by a nomad is a \"range\".[97] Males associated with a pride patrol the fringes.[45] Both males and females defend the pride against intruders, but the male lion is better-suited for this purpose due to its stockier, more powerful build. Some individuals consistently lead the defence against intruders, while others lag behind.[110] Lions tend to assume specific roles in the pride; slower-moving individuals may provide other valuable services to the group.[111] Alternatively, there may be rewards associated with being a leader that fends off intruders; the rank of lionesses in the pride is reflected in these responses.[112] The male or males associated with the pride must defend their relationship with the pride from outside males who may attempt to usurp them.[103] Dominance hierarchies do not appear to exist among individuals of either sex in a pride.[113] Asiatic lion prides differ in group composition. Male Asiatic lions are solitary or associate with up to three males, forming a loose pride while females associate with up to 12 other females, forming a stronger pride together with their cubs. Female and male lions associate only when mating.[114] Coalitions of males hold territory for a longer time than single lions. Males in coalitions of three or four individuals exhibit a pronounced hierarchy, in which one male dominates the others and mates more frequently.[115] The lion is a generalist hypercarnivore and is considered to be both an apex and keystone predator due to its wide prey spectrum.[116][117] Its prey consists mainly of medium-sized to large ungulates, particularly blue wildebeest, plains zebra, African buffalo, gemsbok and giraffe. It also frequently takes common warthog despite it being much smaller.[118] In India, chital and sambar deer are the most common wild prey,[45][118][119] while livestock contributes significantly to lion kills outside protected areas.[120] It usually avoids fully grown adult elephants, rhinoceros and hippopotamus and small prey like dik-dik, hyraxes, hares and monkeys. Unusual prey include porcupines and small reptiles. Lions kill other predators but seldom consume them.[121] Young lions first display stalking behaviour at around three months of age, although they do not participate in hunting until they are almost a year old and begin to hunt effectively when nearing the age of two.[122] Single lions are capable of bringing down zebra and wildebeest, while larger prey like buffalo and giraffe are riskier.[103] In Chobe National Park, large prides have been observed hunting African bush elephants up to around 15 years old in exceptional cases, with the victims being calves, juveniles, and even subadults.[123][124] In typical hunts, each lioness has a favoured position in the group, either stalking prey on the \"wing\", then attacking, or moving a smaller distance in the centre of the group and capturing prey fleeing from other lionesses. Males attached to prides do not usually participate in group hunting.[125] Some evidence suggests, however, that males are just as successful as females; they are typically solo hunters who ambush prey in small bushland.[126] They may join in the hunting of large, slower-moving prey like buffalo; and even hunt them on their own. Moderately-sized hunting groups generally have higher success rates than lone females and larger groups.[127] Lions are not particularly known for their stamina. For instance, a lioness's heart comprises only 0.57% of her body weight and a male's is about 0.45% of his body weight, whereas a hyena's heart comprises almost 1% of its body weight.[128] Thus, lions run quickly only in short bursts at about 48–59 km/h (30–37 mph) and need to be close to their prey before starting the attack.[129] They take advantage of factors that reduce visibility; many kills take place near some form of cover or at night.[130] One study in 2018 recorded a lion running at a top speed of 74.1 km/h (46.0 mph).[131] The lion accelerates at the start of the chase by 9.5 m/s², whereas zebras, wildebeest and Thomson's gazelle accelerate by 5 m/s², 5.6 m/s² and 4.5 m/s², respectively; acceleration appears to be more important than steady displacement speed in lion hunts.[132] The lion's attack is short and powerful; it attempts to catch prey with a fast rush and final leap, usually pulls it down by the rump, and kills with a clamping bite to the throat or muzzle. It can hold the prey's throat for up to 13 minutes, until the prey stops moving.[133] It has a bite force from 1593.8 to 1768 Newtons at the canine tip and up 4167.6 Newtons at the carnassial notch.[134][135][136] Lions typically consume prey at the location of the hunt but sometimes drag large prey into cover.[137] They tend to squabble over kills, particularly the males. Cubs suffer most when food is scarce but otherwise all pride members eat their fill, including old and crippled lions, which can live on leftovers.[103] Large kills are shared more widely among pride members.[138] An adult lioness requires an average of about 5 kg (11 lb) of meat per day while males require about 7 kg (15 lb).[139] Lions gorge themselves and eat up to 30 kg (66 lb) in one session.[93] If it is unable to consume all of the kill, it rests for a few hours before continuing to eat. On hot days, the pride retreats to shade with one or two males standing guard.[137] Lions defend their kills from scavengers such as vultures and hyenas.[103] Lions scavenge on carrion when the opportunity arises, scavenging animals dead from natural causes such as disease or those that were killed by other predators. Scavenging lions keep a constant lookout for circling vultures, which indicate the death or distress of an animal.[140] Most carrion on which both hyenas and lions feed upon are killed by hyenas rather than lions.[57] Carrion is thought to provide a large part of lion diet.[141] Lions and spotted hyenas occupy a similar ecological niche and compete for prey and carrion; a review of data across several studies indicates a dietary overlap of 58.6%.[142] Lions typically ignore hyenas unless they are on a kill or are being harassed, while the latter tend to visibly react to the presence of lions with or without the presence of food. In the Ngorongoro crater, lions subsist largely on kills stolen from hyenas, causing them to increase their kill rate.[143] In Botswana's Chobe National Park, the situation is reversed as hyenas there frequently challenge lions and steal their kills, obtaining food from 63% of all lion kills.[144] When confronted on a kill, hyenas may either leave or wait patiently at a distance of 30–100 m (98–328 ft) until the lions have finished.[145] Hyenas may feed alongside lions and force them off a kill. The two species attack one another even when there is no food involved for no apparent reason.[146] Lions can account for up to 71% of hyena deaths in Etosha National Park. Hyenas have adapted by frequently mobbing lions that enter their home ranges.[147] When the lion population in Kenya's Masai Mara National Reserve declined, the spotted hyena population increased rapidly.[148] Lions tend to dominate cheetahs and leopards, steal their kills and kill their cubs and even adults when given the chance.[149] Cheetahs often lose their kills to lions or other predators.[150] A study in the Serengeti ecosystem revealed that lions killed at least 17 of 125 cheetah cubs born between 1987 and 1990.[151] Cheetahs avoid their competitors by hunting at different times and habitats.[152] Leopards, by contrast, do not appear to be motivated by an avoidance of lions, as they use heavy vegetation regardless of whether lions are present in an area and both cats are active around the same time of day. In addition, there is no evidence that lions affect leopard abundance.[153] Leopards take refuge in trees, though lionesses occasionally attempt to climb up and retrieve their kills.[154] Lions similarly dominate African wild dogs, taking their kills and dispatching pups or adult dogs. Population densities of wild dogs are low in areas where lions are more abundant.[155] However, there are a few reported cases of old and wounded lions falling prey to wild dogs.[156][157] Most lionesses reproduce by the time they are four years of age.[158] Lions do not mate at a specific time of year and the females are polyestrous.[159] Like those of other cats, the male lion's penis has spines that point backward. During withdrawal of the penis, the spines rake the walls of the female's vagina, which may cause ovulation.[160][161] A lioness may mate with more than one male when she is in heat.[162] Lions of both sexes may be involved in group homosexual and courtship activities. Males will also head-rub and roll around with each other before mounting each other.[163][164] Generation length of the lion is about seven years.[165] The average gestation period is around 110 days;[159] the female gives birth to a litter of between one and four cubs in a secluded den, which may be a thicket, a reed-bed, a cave, or some other sheltered area, usually away from the pride. She will often hunt alone while the cubs are still helpless, staying relatively close to the den.[166] Lion cubs are born blind, their eyes opening around seven days after birth. They weigh 1.2–2.1 kg (2.6–4.6 lb) at birth and are almost helpless, beginning to crawl a day or two after birth and walking around three weeks of age.[167] To avoid a buildup of scent attracting the attention of predators, the lioness moves her cubs to a new den site several times a month, carrying them one-by-one by the nape of the neck.[166] Usually, the mother does not integrate herself and her cubs back into the pride until the cubs are six to eight weeks old.[166] Sometimes the introduction to pride life occurs earlier, particularly if other lionesses have given birth at about the same time.[103][168] When first introduced to the rest of the pride, lion cubs lack confidence when confronted with adults other than their mother. They soon begin to immerse themselves in the pride life, however, playing among themselves or attempting to initiate play with the adults.[168] Lionesses with cubs of their own are more likely to be tolerant of another lioness's cubs than lionesses without cubs. Male tolerance of the cubs varies—one male could patiently let the cubs play with his tail or his mane, while another may snarl and bat the cubs away.[169] Pride lionesses often synchronise their reproductive cycles and communal rearing and suckling of the young, which suckle indiscriminately from any or all of the nursing females in the pride. The synchronisation of births is advantageous because the cubs grow to being roughly the same size and have an equal chance of survival, and sucklings are not dominated by older cubs.[103][168] Weaning occurs after six or seven months. Male lions reach maturity at about three years of age and at four to five years are capable of challenging and displacing adult males associated with another pride. They begin to age and weaken at between 10 and 15 years of age at the latest.[170] When one or more new males oust the previous males associated with a pride, the victors often kill any existing young cubs, perhaps because females do not become fertile and receptive until their cubs mature or die. Females often fiercely defend their cubs from a usurping male but are rarely successful unless a group of three or four mothers within a pride join forces against the male.[171] Cubs also die from starvation and abandonment, and predation by leopards, hyenas and wild dogs. Male cubs are excluded from their maternal pride when they reach maturity at around two or three years of age,[172] while some females may leave when they reach the age of two.[99] When a new male lion takes over a pride, adolescents both male and female may be evicted.[173] Lions may live 12–17 years in the wild.[45] Although adult lions have no natural predators, evidence suggests most die violently from attacks by humans or other lions.[174] Lions often inflict serious injuries on members of other prides they encounter in territorial disputes or members of the home pride when fighting at a kill.[175] Crippled lions and cubs may fall victim to hyenas and leopards or be trampled by buffalo or elephants. Careless lions may be maimed when hunting prey.[176] Nile crocodiles may also kill and eat lions, evidenced by the occasional lion claw found in crocodile stomachs.[177] Ticks commonly infest the ears, neck and groin regions of the lions.[178][179] Adult forms of several tapeworm species of the genus Taenia have been isolated from lion intestines, having been ingested as larvae in antelope meat.[180] Lions in the Ngorongoro Crater were afflicted by an outbreak of stable fly (Stomoxys calcitrans) in 1962, resulting in lions becoming emaciated and covered in bloody, bare patches. Lions sought unsuccessfully to evade the biting flies by climbing trees or crawling into hyena burrows; many died or migrated and the local population dropped from 70 to 15 individuals.[181] A more recent outbreak in 2001 killed six lions.[182] Captive lions have been infected with canine distemper virus (CDV) since at least the mid-1970s.[183] CDV is spread by domestic dogs and other carnivores; a 1994 outbreak in Serengeti National Park resulted in many lions developing neurological symptoms such as seizures. During the outbreak, several lions died from pneumonia and encephalitis.[184] Feline immunodeficiency virus and lentivirus also affect captive lions.[185][186] When resting, lion socialisation occurs through a number of behaviours; the animal's expressive movements are highly developed. The most common peaceful, tactile gestures are head rubbing and social licking,[187] which have been compared with the role of allogrooming among primates.[188] Head rubbing, nuzzling the forehead, face and neck against another lion appears to be a form of greeting[189] and is seen often after an animal has been apart from others or after a fight or confrontation. Males tend to rub other males, while cubs and females rub females.[190] Social licking often occurs in tandem with head rubbing; it is generally mutual and the recipient appears to express pleasure. The head and neck are the most common parts of the body licked; this behaviour may have arisen out of utility because lions cannot lick these areas themselves.[191] Lions have an array of facial expressions and body postures that serve as visual gestures.[192] A common facial expression is the \"grimace face\" or flehmen response, which a lion makes when sniffing chemical signals and involves an open mouth with bared teeth, raised muzzle, wrinkled nose, closed eyes and relaxed ears.[193] Lions also use chemical and visual marking;[192] males spray urine[194][195] and scrape plots of ground and objects within the territory.[192] The lion's repertoire of vocalisations is large; variations in intensity and pitch appear to be central to communication. Most lion vocalisations are variations of growling, snarling, meowing and roaring. Other sounds produced include puffing, bleating and humming. Roaring is used to advertise its presence. Lions most often roar at night, a sound that can be heard from a distance of 8 kilometres (5 mi).[196] They tend to roar in a very characteristic manner starting with a few deep, long roars that subside into grunts.[197][198] The lion is listed as Vulnerable on the IUCN Red List. The Indian population is listed on CITES Appendix I and the African population on CITES Appendix II.[2] Several large and well-managed protected areas in Africa host large lion populations. Where an infrastructure for wildlife tourism has been developed, cash revenue for park management and local communities is a strong incentive for lion conservation.[2] Most lions now live in East and Southern Africa; their numbers are rapidly decreasing, and fell by an estimated 30–50% in the late half of the 20th century. Primary causes of the decline include disease and human interference.[2] In 1975, it was estimated that since the 1950s, lion numbers had decreased by half to 200,000 or fewer.[199] Estimates of the African lion population range between 16,500 and 47,000 living in the wild in 2002–2004.[200][86] In the Republic of the Congo, Odzala-Kokoua National Park was considered a lion stronghold in the 1990s. By 2014, no lions were recorded in the protected area so the population is considered locally extinct.[201] The West African lion population is isolated from the one in Central Africa, with little or no exchange of breeding individuals. In 2015, it was estimated that this population consists of about 400 animals, including fewer than 250 mature individuals. They persist in three protected areas in the region, mostly in one population in the W A P protected area complex, shared by Benin, Burkina Faso and Niger. This population is listed as Critically Endangered.[13] Field surveys in the WAP ecosystem revealed that lion occupancy is lowest in the W National Park, and higher in areas with permanent staff and thus better protection.[202] A population occurs in Cameroon's Waza National Park, where between approximately 14 and 21 animals persisted as of 2009.[203] In addition, 50 to 150 lions are estimated to be present in Burkina Faso's Arly-Singou ecosystem.[204] In 2015, an adult male lion and a female lion were sighted in Ghana's Mole National Park. These were the first sightings of lions in the country in 39 years.[205] In the same year, a population of up to 200 lions that was previously thought to have been extirpated was filmed in the Alatash National Park, Ethiopia, close to the Sudanese border.[206][207] In 2005, Lion Conservation Strategies were developed for West and Central Africa, and or East and Southern Africa. The strategies seek to maintain suitable habitat, ensure a sufficient wild prey base for lions, reduce factors that lead to further fragmentation of populations, and make lion–human coexistence sustainable.[208][209] Lion depredation on livestock is significantly reduced in areas where herders keep livestock in improved enclosures. Such measures contribute to mitigating human–lion conflict.[210] The last refuge of the Asiatic lion population is the 1,412 km2 (545 sq mi) Gir National Park and surrounding areas in the region of Saurashtra or Kathiawar Peninsula in Gujarat State, India. The population has risen from approximately 180 lions in 1974 to about 400 in 2010.[211] It is geographically isolated, which can lead to inbreeding and reduced genetic diversity. Since 2008, the Asiatic lion has been listed as Endangered on the IUCN Red List.[12] By 2015, the population had grown to 523 individuals inhabiting an area of 7,000 km2 (2,700 sq mi) in Saurashtra.[212][213][214] In 2017, about 650 individuals were recorded during the Asiatic Lion Census.[215] The presence of numerous human settlements close to Gir National Park resulted in conflict between lions, local people and their livestock.[216][212] Some consider the presence of lions a benefit, as they keep populations of crop damaging herbivores in check.[217] Lions imported to Europe before the middle of the 19th century were possibly foremost Barbary lions from North Africa, or Cape lions from Southern Africa.[218] Another 11 animals thought to be Barbary lions kept in Addis Ababa Zoo are descendants of animals owned by Emperor Haile Selassie. WildLink International in collaboration with Oxford University launched an ambitious International Barbary Lion Project with the aim of identifying and breeding Barbary lions in captivity for eventual reintroduction into a national park in the Atlas Mountains of Morocco.[219] However, a genetic analysis showed that the captive lions at Addis Ababa Zoo were not Barbary lions, but rather closely related to wild lions in Chad and Cameroon.[220] In 1982, the Association of Zoos and Aquariums started a Species Survival Plan for the Asiatic lion to increase its chances of survival. In 1987, it was found that most lions in North American zoos were hybrids between African and Asiatic lions.[221] Breeding programs need to note origins of the participating animals to avoid cross-breeding different subspecies and thus reducing their conservation value.[222] Captive breeding of lions was halted to eliminate individuals of unknown origin and pedigree. Wild-born lions were imported to American zoos from Africa between 1989 and 1995. Breeding was continued in 1998 in the frame of an African lion Species Survival Plan.[223] About 77% of the captive lions registered in the International Species Information System in 2006 were of unknown origin; these animals might have carried genes that are extinct in the wild and may therefore be important to the maintenance of the overall genetic variability of the lion.[66] Lions are part of a group of exotic animals that have been central to zoo exhibits since the late 18th century. Although many modern zoos are more selective about their exhibits,[224] there are more than 1,000 African and 100 Asiatic lions in zoos and wildlife parks around the world. They are considered an ambassador species and are kept for tourism, education and conservation purposes.[225] Lions can live over twenty years in captivity; for example, three sibling lions at the Honolulu Zoo lived to the age of 22 in 2007.[226][227] The first European \"zoos\" spread among noble and royal families in the 13th century, and until the 17th century were called seraglios. At that time, they came to be called menageries, an extension of the cabinet of curiosities. They spread from France and Italy during the Renaissance to the rest of Europe.[228] In England, although the seraglio tradition was less developed, lions were kept at the Tower of London in a seraglio established by King John in the 13th century;[229][230] this was probably stocked with animals from an earlier menagerie started in 1125 by Henry I at his hunting lodge in Woodstock, Oxfordshire, where according to William of Malmesbury lions had been stocked.[231] Lions were kept in cramped and squalid conditions at London Zoo until a larger lion house with roomier cages was built in the 1870s.[232] Further changes took place in the early 20th century when Carl Hagenbeck designed enclosures with concrete \"rocks\", more open space and a moat instead of bars, more closely resembling a natural habitat. Hagenbeck designed lion enclosures for both Melbourne Zoo and Sydney's Taronga Zoo; although his designs were popular, the use of bars and caged enclosures prevailed in many zoos until the 1960s.[233] In the late 20th century, larger, more natural enclosures and the use of wire mesh or laminated glass instead of lowered dens allowed visitors to come closer than ever to the animals; some attractions such as the Cat Forest/Lion Overlook of Oklahoma City Zoological Park placed the den on ground level, higher than visitors.[234] Lion taming has been part of both established circuses and individual acts such as Siegfried & Roy. The practice began in the early 19th century by Frenchman Henri Martin and American Isaac Van Amburgh, who both toured widely and whose techniques were copied by a number of followers.[235] Van Amburgh performed before Queen Victoria in 1838 when he toured Great Britain. Martin composed a pantomime titled Les Lions de Mysore (\"the lions of Mysore\"), an idea Amburgh quickly borrowed. These acts eclipsed equestrianism acts as the central display of circus shows and entered public consciousness in the early 20th century with cinema. In demonstrating the superiority of human over animal, lion taming served a purpose similar to animal fights of previous centuries.[235] The ultimate proof of a tamer's dominance and control over a lion is demonstrated by the placing of the tamer's head in the lion's mouth. The now-iconic lion tamer's chair was possibly first used by American Clyde Beatty (1903–1965).[236] Lion hunting has occurred since ancient times and was often a royal tradition, intended to demonstrate the power of the king over nature. Such hunts took place in a reserved area in front of an audience. The monarch was accompanied by his men and controls were put in place to increase their safety and ease of killing. The earliest surviving record of lion hunting is an ancient Egyptian inscription dated circa 1380 BC that mentions Pharaoh Amenhotep III killing 102 lions in ten years \"with his own arrows\". The Assyrian emperor Ashurbanipal had one of his lion hunts depicted on a sequence of Assyrian palace reliefs c. 640 BC, known as the Lion Hunt of Ashurbanipal. Lions were also hunted during the Mughal Empire, where Emperor Jahangir is said to have excelled at it.[237] In Ancient Rome, lions were kept by emperors for hunts, gladiator fights and executions.[238] The Maasai people have traditionally viewed the killing of lions as a rite of passage. Historically, lions were hunted by individuals, however, due to reduced lion populations, elders discourage solo lion hunts.[239] During the European colonisation of Africa in the 19th century, the hunting of lions was encouraged because they were considered pests and lion skins were sold for £1 each.[240] The widely reproduced imagery of the heroic hunter chasing lions would dominate a large part of the century.[241] Trophy hunting of lions in recent years has been met with controversy, notably with the killing of Cecil the lion in mid-2015.[242] Lions do not usually hunt humans but some (usually males) seem to seek them out. One well-publicised case is the Tsavo maneaters; in 1898, 28 officially recorded railway workers building the Uganda Railway were taken by lions over nine months during the construction of a bridge in Kenya.[243] The hunter who killed the lions wrote a book detailing the animals' predatory behaviour; they were larger than normal and lacked manes, and one seemed to suffer from tooth decay. The infirmity theory, including tooth decay, is not favoured by all researchers; an analysis of teeth and jaws of man-eating lions in museum collections suggests that while tooth decay may explain some incidents, prey depletion in human-dominated areas is a more likely cause of lion predation on humans.[244] Sick or injured animals may be more prone to man-eating but the behaviour is not unusual, nor necessarily aberrant.[245] Lions' proclivity for man-eating has been systematically examined. American and Tanzanian scientists report that man-eating behaviour in rural areas of Tanzania increased greatly from 1990 to 2005. At least 563 villagers were attacked and many eaten over this period. The incidents occurred near Selous Game Reserve in Rufiji River and in Lindi Region near the Mozambican border. While the expansion of villages into bush country is one concern, the authors argue conservation policy must mitigate the danger because in this case, conservation contributes directly to human deaths. Cases in Lindi in which lions seize humans from the centres of substantial villages have been documented.[246] Another study of 1,000 people attacked by lions in southern Tanzania between 1988 and 2009 found that the weeks following the full moon, when there was less moonlight, were a strong indicator of increased night-time attacks on people.[247] According to Robert R. Frump, Mozambican refugees regularly crossing Kruger National Park, South Africa, at night are attacked and eaten by lions; park officials have said man-eating is a problem there. Frump said thousands may have been killed in the decades after apartheid sealed the park and forced refugees to cross the park at night. For nearly a century before the border was sealed, Mozambicans had regularly crossed the park in daytime with little harm.[248] The lion is one of the most widely recognised animal symbols in human culture. It has been extensively depicted in sculptures and paintings, on national flags, and in contemporary films and literature.[44] It is considered to be the monarch of the beasts; symbolising power, royalty and protection.[249] Several leaders have had \"lion\" in their name including Sundiata Keita of the Mali Empire, who was called \"Lion of Mali\",[250] and Richard the Lionheart of England.[251] The male's mane makes it a particularly recognisable feature and thus has been represented more than the female.[252] Nevertheless, the lioness has also had importance as a guardian.[249] In sub-Saharan Africa, the lion has been a common character in stories, proverbs and dances, but rarely featured in visual arts.[253] In the Swahili language, the lion is known as simba which also means \"aggressive\", \"king\" and \"strong\".[56] In parts of West and East Africa, the lion is associated with healing and provides the connection between seers and the supernatural. In other East African traditions, the lion represents laziness.[254] In much of African folklore, the lion is portrayed as having low intelligence and is easily tricked by other animals.[250] In Nubia, The lion-god Apedemak was associated with the flooding of the Nile. In Ancient Egypt, lions were linked both with the sun and the waters of the Nile. Several gods were conceived as being partially lion including the war deities Sekhmet and Maahes, and Tefnut the goddess of moisture. Shu, god of the air, was depicted kneeing between two lions while holding a headrest. The lions mark where the sun rises and sets and symbolise yesterday and tomorrow.[255] The lion was a prominent symbol in ancient Mesopotamia from Sumer up to Assyrian and Babylonian times, where it was strongly associated with kingship.[256] The big cat was a symbol and steed of fertility goddess Inanna.[249] Lions decorate the Processional Way leading to the Ishtar Gate in Babylon which was built by Nebuchadnezzar II in the 6th century BCE. The Lion of Babylon symbolised the power of the king and protection of the land against enemies, but was also invoked for good luck.[257] The constellation Leo the lion was first recognised by the Sumerians around 4,000 years ago and is considered to be the fifth sign of the zodiac. In ancient Israel, a lion represented the tribe of Judah.[258] Lions are frequently mentioned in the Bible, notably in the Book of Daniel, in which the eponymous hero refuses to worship King Darius and is forced to sleep in the lions' den where he is miraculously unharmed (Dan 6).[259] Indo-Persian chroniclers regarded the lion as keeper of order in the realm of animals. The Sanskrit word mrigendra signifies a lion as king of animals in general or deer in particular.[260] In India, the Lion Capital of Ashoka, erected by Emperor Ashoka in the 3rd century CE, depicts four lions standing back to back. In Hindu mythology, the half-lion Narasimha, an avatar of the deity Vishnu, battles and slays the evil ruler Hiranyakashipu. In Buddhist art, lions are associated with both arhats and bodhisattvas and may be ridden by the Manjushri. Though they were never native to the country, lions have played important roles in Chinese culture. Statues of the beast have guarded the entrances to the imperial palace and many religious shrines. The lion dance has been performed in China and beyond for over a thousand years.[261] In ancient Greece, the lion is featured in several of Aesop's fables, notably The Lion and the Mouse. In Greek mythology, the Nemean lion is slain by the hero Heracles who wears its skin. Lancelot and Gawain were also heroes slaying lions in medieval Europe. In some medieval stories, lions were portrayed as allies and companions. Lions continue to appear in modern literature such as the Cowardly Lion in L. Frank Baum's 1900 The Wonderful Wizard of Oz, and in C. S. Lewis's The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe. The lion's role as king of the beasts has been used in the 1994 Disney animated feature film The Lion King.[262]",

                "content": "Our editors will review what you’ve submitted and determine whether to revise the article. In the wild, lions usually live no more than 8 to 10 years because of attacks by humans or other lions, or the effects of goring or kicks from intended prey. In captivity, they may live over 25 years. Lions live in a variety of habitats but prefer grassland, savanna, dense scrub, and open woodland. Historically, they lived across much of Europe, Asia, and Africa, but now they are mainly found in parts of Africa south of the Sahara. A pride is a group of lions that live together. The members of a pride spend days in several scattered groups that meet to hunt or share a meal. Each pride has its own territory that it defends, ranging from 20 square km (8 square miles) if food is abundant to 400 square km (around 150 square miles) if food is sparse. Manes make male lions look larger than they really are, which may function to intimidate rivals and impress prospective mates. Manes vary from one lion to another and may be entirely absent. Lions usually hunt and eat medium-sized to large hoofed animals like wildebeests, zebras, and antelopes. They occasionally also prey on larger animals, especially sick or injured ones, and eat found meat such as carrion. lion, (Panthera leo), large, powerfully built cat (family Felidae) that is second in size only to the tiger; it is a famous apex predator (meaning without a natural predator or enemy). The proverbial “king of beasts,” the lion has been one of the best-known wild animals since earliest times. Lions are most active at night and live in a variety of habitats but prefer grassland, savanna, dense scrub, and open woodland. Historically, they ranged across much of Europe, Asia, and Africa, but now they are found mainly in parts of Africa south of the Sahara. An isolated population of about between 500 and 700 wild Asiatic lions constitute a slightly smaller population that lives under strict protection in India’s Gir National Park and Wildlife Sanctuary. The lion is a well-muscled cat with a long body, large head, and short legs. Size and appearance vary considerably between the sexes. The male’s outstanding characteristic is his mane, which varies between different individuals and populations. It may be entirely lacking; it may fringe the face; or it may be full and shaggy, covering the back of the head, neck, and shoulders and continuing onto the throat and chest to join a fringe along the belly. In some lions the mane and fringe are very dark, almost black, giving the cat a majestic appearance. Manes make males look larger and may serve to intimidate rivals or impress prospective mates. A full-grown male is about 1.8–2.1 metres (6–7 feet) long, excluding the 1-metre tail; he stands about 1.2 metres high at the shoulder and weighs 170–230 kg (370–500 pounds). The female, or lioness, is smaller, with a body length of 1.5 metres, a shoulder height of 0.9–1.1 metres, and a weight of 120–180 kg. The lion’s coat is short and varies in colour from buff yellow, orange-brown, or silvery gray to dark brown, with a tuft on the tail tip that is usually darker than the rest of the coat. Lions are unique among cats in that they live in a group, or pride. The members of a pride typically spend the day in several scattered groups that may unite to hunt or share a meal. A pride consists of several generations of lionesses, some of which are related, a smaller number of breeding males, and their cubs. The group may consist of as few as 4 or as many as 37 members, but about 15 is the average size. Each pride has a well-defined territory consisting of a core area that is strictly defended against intruding lions and a fringe area where some overlap is tolerated. Where prey is abundant, a territory area may be as small as 20 square km (8 square miles), but if game is sparse, it may cover up to 400 square km. Some prides have been known to use the same territory for decades, passing the area on between females. Lions proclaim their territory by roaring and by scent marking. Their distinctive roar is generally delivered in the evening before a night’s hunting and again before getting up at dawn. Males also proclaim their presence by urinating on bushes, trees, or simply on the ground, leaving a pungent scent behind. Defecation and rubbing against bushes leave different scent markings. There are a number of competing evolutionary explanations for why lions form groups. Large body size and high density of their main prey probably make group life more efficient for females in terms of energy expenditure. Groups of females, for example, hunt more effectively and are better able to defend cubs against infanticidal males and their hunting territory against other females. The relative importance of these factors is debated, and it is not clear which was responsible for the establishment of group life and which are secondary benefits. Lions prey on a large variety of animals ranging in size from rodents and baboons to Cape (or African) buffalo and hippopotamuses, but they predominantly hunt medium- to large-sized hoofed animals such as wildebeests, zebras, and antelopes. Prey preferences vary geographically as well as between neighbouring prides. Lions are known to take elephants and giraffes, but only if the individual is young or especially sick. They readily eat any meat they can find, including carrion and fresh kills that they scavenge or forcefully steal from hyenas, cheetahs, or wild dogs. Lionesses living in open savanna do most of the hunting, whereas males typically appropriate their meals from the female’s kills. However, male lions are also adept hunters, and in some areas they hunt frequently. Pride males in scrub or wooded habitat spend less time with the females and hunt most of their own meals. Nomadic males must always secure their own food. Vulnerable Though a group of hunting lions is potentially nature’s most formidable predatory force on land, a high proportion of their hunts fail. The cats pay no attention to the wind’s direction (which can carry their scent to their prey), and they tire after running short distances. Typically, they stalk prey from nearby cover and then burst forth to run it down in a short, rapid rush. After leaping on the prey, the lion lunges at its neck and bites until the animal has been strangled. Other members of the pride quickly crowd around to feed on the kill, usually fighting for access. Hunts are sometimes conducted in groups, with members of a pride encircling a herd or approaching it from opposite directions, then closing in for a kill in the resulting panic. The cats typically gorge themselves and then rest for several days in its vicinity. An adult male can consume more than 34 kg (75 pounds) of meat at a single meal and rest for a week before resuming the hunt. If prey is abundant, both sexes typically spend 21 to 22 hours a day resting, sleeping, or sitting and hunt for only 2 or 3 hours a day.",

Lions have strong, compact bodies and powerful forelegs, teeth and jaws for pulling down and killing prey. Their coats are yellow-gold, and adult males have shaggy manes that range in color from blond to reddish-brown to black. The length and color of a lion's mane is likely determined by age, genetics and hormones. Young lions have light spotting on their coats that disappears as they grow. Without their coats, lion and tiger bodies are so similar that only experts can tell them apart. Lions stand between 3.5 and 4 feet (1 and 1.2 meters) tall at the shoulder. Males grow to lengths of 10 feet (3 meters) and have a 2 to 3 foot (60 to 91 centimeter) tail. They weigh from 330 to 550 pounds (150 to 250 kilograms). Slightly smaller, females grow to lengths of 9 feet (2.7 meters) and weigh between 265 and 395 pounds. Lions inhabit a wide range of habitats, from open plains to thick brush and dry thorn forest. Except for a small population of the Indian lion subspecies that remains in the Gir Forest of northwest India, lions now live only in Africa, from the Sahara's southern fringe to northern South Africa. They are absent from equatorial areas dominated by moist tropical forest. Lions in zoos may live into their late teens or early 20s. In the wild, a lioness may live up to 16 years, but males rarely live past the age of 12. Lions primarily eat large animals that weigh from 100 to 1,000 pounds (45 to 453 kilograms), such as zebra and wildebeest. In times of shortage, they also catch and eat a variety of smaller animals, from rodents to reptiles. Lions also steal kills from hyenas, leopards and other predators. At times, they may lose their own catches to hyena groups. Lions may also feed on domestic livestock, especially in areas near villages. The Smithsonian's National Zoo's lions eat ground beef, which is commercially produced to meet the nutritional needs of carnivores. Twice a week, they receive knucklebones or beef femurs, and once a week they receive rabbits, which exercise the cats' teeth and jaws. Lions are the world's most social felines. They live in groups of related females, called prides, which may comprise several to as many as 40 individuals, including adults, sub-adults (between the ages of 2 and 4) and cubs, plus one or more resident males. Abundance of prey availability plays a significant role in the size of a lion pride. Pride mates associate in sub-groups within the pride. Females usually stay in their mothers' prides for life, unless food scarcity forces them out. Young males are driven from their prides when they grow large enough to compete with the dominant males (usually between the ages of 2 and 4). They create coalitions, usually with brothers and cousins, and search for a pride to take over. Males entering a new pride will kill all cubs that cannot run from them. Adult males that are fortunate enough to achieve residency within a pride hold tenure for an average of two years, often leaving due to eviction by another coalition of males. In India, female and male lions live apart, joining only to mate. Males take on most of the defensive duties. However, both males and females mark their territories by roaring — which can be heard up to five miles away — and scent marking with urine. Females raise the cubs and are the primary hunters, although males will sometimes join females during a hunt. Depending on the prey item, several lions may stalk prey from different angles to within 100 feet (30 meters) before attacking the targeted animal. Nomadic males must hunt alone or scavenge from other animals. Females are receptive to mates for a few days several times a year, unless they are pregnant or nursing, and mating spurs ovulation. They typically give birth to a litter every two years. Females usually give birth to one to four cubs after a gestation of about 3 1/2 months. Cubs typically nurse for six months but start eating meat at three months. Due to dangers, including starvation during times of food shortage and attacks by male lions taking over prides, up to 80 percent of lion cubs die within their first 2 years of life. During the past decade, lion populations have declined by about 30 percent. Currently, an estimated 20,000 lions remain in the wild. More than 10,000 years ago, lions thrived from North and South America to Europe, Africa and Asia. Today, following climatic changes and after centuries of hunting and habitat degradation by people, lions live primarily in scattered habitats across Africa — with the exception of the Gir Forest lions, which live in a national park in northwest India. Within these areas, lions still face dangers, including habitat loss, poisoning and hunting. Many have died from diseases such as distemper, which is spread by domestic dogs from villages near natural habitat. To prevent lions from becoming as rare as tigers, large expanses of habitat must be carefully protected. In disease-ridden areas, ranging dogs must be kept away from lions or immunized. Meanwhile, the isolated Gir Forest lions suffer from inbreeding, a limited habitat and frequent conflicts with people. This critically endangered population consists of only about 250 lions. Though slowly growing, this population is threatened by infrastructure development and needs additional reserves to grow.Lions share their habitat with many different animals. By saving lion habitat, other species are also protected, including hyena, wildebeest, plains zebra and chital. The Smithsonian's National Zoo is home to three African lions—males Shaka and Jumbe and female Shera. Luke, one of the Zoo's famous residents, died in 2022.

                "content": "National Football League (1921–present) The Green Bay Packers are a professional American football team based in Green Bay, Wisconsin. The Packers compete in the National Football League (NFL) as a member of the National Football Conference (NFC) North division. They are the third-oldest franchise in the NFL, established in 1919,[11][12] and are the only non-profit, community-owned major league professional sports team based in the United States.[a][13] Since 1957, home games have been played at Lambeau Field. They hold the record for the most wins in NFL history.[14][15] The Packers are the last of the \"small-town teams\" that were common in the NFL during the league's early days of the 1920s and 1930s.[16] Founded in 1919 by Earl \"Curly\" Lambeau and George Whitney Calhoun, the franchise traces its lineage to other semi-professional teams in Green Bay dating back to 1896. Between 1919 and 1920, the Packers competed against other semi-pro clubs from around Wisconsin and the Midwest, before joining the American Professional Football Association (APFA), the forerunner of today's NFL, in 1921. In 1933, the Packers began playing part of their home slate in Milwaukee until changes at Lambeau Field in 1995 made it more lucrative to stay in Green Bay full-time; Milwaukee is still considered a home media market for the team.[17][18][19] Although Green Bay is the smallest major league professional sports market in North America,[a][20] Forbes ranked the Packers as the world's 27th-most-valuable sports franchise in 2019, with a value of $2.63 billion.[21] The Packers have won 13 league championships, the most in NFL history, with nine pre-Super Bowl NFL titles and four Super Bowl victories. The Packers, under coach Vince Lombardi, won the first two Super Bowls in 1966 and 1967; they were the only NFL team to defeat the American Football League (AFL) before the AFL–NFL merger. After Lombardi retired, the Super Bowl trophy was named for him, but the team struggled through the 1970s and 1980s. Since 1993, the team has enjoyed much regular-season success, making the playoffs 23 times and winning two Super Bowls in 1996 under head coach Mike Holmgren and 2010 under head coach Mike McCarthy.[22][23] The Packers have the most wins (826) and the second-highest win–loss record (.571) in NFL history, including both regular season and playoff games.[24][25][26] The Packers are longstanding adversaries of the Chicago Bears, Minnesota Vikings, and Detroit Lions, who today form the NFL's NFC North division (formerly known as the NFC Central Division). They have played more than 100 games against each of those teams, and have a winning overall record against all of them, a distinction only shared with the Kansas City Chiefs, Dallas Cowboys, and Miami Dolphins. The Bears–Packers rivalry is one of the oldest rivalries in U.S. professional sports history, dating to 1921. The Green Bay Packers were founded on August 11, 1919,[1] by former high-school football rivals Earl \"Curly\" Lambeau and George Whitney Calhoun.[27] Lambeau solicited funds for uniforms from his employer, the Indian Packing Company, a meat packing company.[28] He was given $500 ($8,800 today) for uniforms and equipment, on the condition that the team be named after its sponsor.[29] The Green Bay Packers have played in their original city longer than any other team in the NFL. On August 27, 1921, the Packers were granted a franchise in the American Professional Football Association, a new national pro football league that had been formed the previous year. The APFA changed its name to the National Football League a year later. Financial troubles plagued the team, and the franchise was forfeited within the year before Lambeau found new financial backers and regained the franchise the next year. These backers, known as \"The Hungry Five\", formed the Green Bay Football Corporation.[30] After a near-miss in 1927, Lambeau's squad claimed the Packers' first NFL title in 1929 with an undefeated 12–0–1 campaign, behind a stifling defense which registered eight shutouts.[31] Green Bay would repeat as league champions in 1930 and 1931, bettering teams from New York, Chicago and throughout the league, with all-time greats and future Hall of Famers Mike Michalske, Johnny (Blood) McNally, Cal Hubbard and Green Bay native Arnie Herber.[32][33] Among the many impressive accomplishments of these years was the Packers' streak of 29 consecutive home games without defeat, an NFL record which still stands.[34] The arrival of the end Don Hutson from Alabama in 1935 gave Lambeau and the Packers the most feared and dynamic offensive weapon in the game. Credited with inventing pass patterns, Hutson would lead the league in receptions in eight seasons and spur the Packers to NFL championships in 1936, 1939 and 1944. An Iron Man, Hutson played both ways, leading the league in interceptions as a safety in 1940. Hutson claimed 18 NFL records when he retired in 1945, many of which still stand.[35] In 1951, his number 14 was the first to be retired by the Packers, and he was inducted as a charter member of the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 1963.[36][37] After Hutson's retirement, Lambeau could not stop the Packers' slide. He purchased a large lodge near Green Bay for team members and families to live in. Rockwood Lodge was the home of the 1946–49 Packers. The 1947 and 1948 seasons produced a record of 12–10–1, and 1949 was even worse at 3–9. The lodge burned down on January 24, 1950, and insurance money paid for many of the Packers' debts.[38] Curly Lambeau departed after the 1949 season. Gene Ronzani and Lisle Blackbourn could not coach the Packers back to their former magic, even as a new stadium was unveiled in 1957.[39][40] The losing would descend to the disastrous 1958 campaign under coach Ray \"Scooter\" McLean, whose lone 1–10–1 year at the helm is the worst in Packers history.[41] Former New York Giants assistant Vince Lombardi was hired as Packers head coach and general manager on February 2, 1959.[42] Few suspected the hiring represented the beginning of a remarkable, immediate turnaround. Under Lombardi, the Packers would become the team of the 1960s, winning five championships over seven years, including victories in the first two Super Bowls. During the Lombardi era, the stars of the Packers' offense included Bart Starr, Jim Taylor, Carroll Dale, Paul Hornung (as halfback and placekicker), Forrest Gregg, and Jerry Kramer. The defense included Willie Davis, Henry Jordan, Willie Wood, Ray Nitschke, Dave Robinson, and Herb Adderley. The Packers' first regular-season game under Lombardi was on September 27, 1959, a 9–6 victory over the Chicago Bears in Green Bay. After winning their first three, the Packers lost the next five before finishing strong by sweeping their final four. The 7–5 record represented the Packers' first winning season since 1947, enough to earn rookie head coach Lombardi the NFL Coach of the Year.[43][44] The next year, the Packers, led by Paul Hornung's 176 points, won the NFL West title and played in the NFL Championship against the Philadelphia Eagles at Philadelphia.[45][46] In a see-saw game, the Packers trailed by only four points when All-Pro Eagle linebacker Chuck Bednarik tackled Jim Taylor just nine yards short of the goal line as time expired.[47] The Packers returned to the NFL Championship game the following season and faced the New York Giants in the first league title game to be played in Green Bay. The Packers scored 24-second-quarter points, including a championship-record 19 by Paul Hornung, on special \"loan\" from the Army (one touchdown, four extra points, and three field goals), powering the Packers to a 37–0 rout of the Giants, their first NFL Championship since 1944.[48][49] It was in 1961 that Green Bay became known as \"Titletown\".[50] The Packers stormed back in the 1962 season, jumping out to a 10–0 start on their way to a 13–1 season.[51] This consistent level of success would lead to Lombardi's Packers becoming one of the most prominent teams of their era, and to be featured as the face of the NFL on the cover of Time on December 21, 1962, as part of the magazine's cover story on \"The Sport of the '60s\".[52] Shortly after Time's article, the Packers faced the Giants in a much more brutal championship game than the previous year, but the Packers prevailed on the kicking of Jerry Kramer and the determined running of Jim Taylor. The Packers defeated the Giants in New York, 16–7.[53] The 1963 team went 11–2–1 but finished second in the NFL West.[54] The 1964 went 8–5–1 and finished second in the NFL West.[55] The Packers returned to the championship game in 1965 following a two-year absence when they defeated the Colts in a playoff for the Western Conference title.[56] That game would be remembered for Don Chandler's controversial tying field goal in which the ball allegedly went wide right, but the officials signaled \"good\".[57] The 13–10 overtime win earned the Packers a trip to the NFL Championship game, where Hornung and Taylor ran through the defending champion Cleveland Browns, helping the Packers win, 23–12, to earn their third NFL Championship under Lombardi and ninth overall.[58] Goalpost uprights would be made taller the next year.[59] The 1966 season saw the Packers led to the first-ever Super Bowl by MVP quarterback Bart Starr.[60] The team went 12–2, and as time wound down in the NFL Championship against the Dallas Cowboys, the Packers clung to a 34–27 lead.[61] Dallas had the ball on the Packers' two-yard line, threatening to tie the ballgame. But on fourth down the Packers' Tom Brown intercepted Don Meredith's pass in the end zone to seal the win.[62] The team crowned its season by rolling over the AFL champion Kansas City Chiefs 35–10 in Super Bowl I.[63] The 1967 season was the last for Lombardi as the Packers' head coach.[64] The NFL Championship game, a rematch of the 1966 contest against Dallas, became indelibly known as the \"Ice Bowl\" as a result of the brutally cold conditions at Lambeau Field.[65] Still the coldest NFL game ever played, it remains one of the most famous football games at any level in the history of the sport.[66] With 16 seconds left, Bart Starr's touchdown on a quarterback sneak brought the Packers a 21–17 victory and their still unequaled third straight NFL Championship.[67] They then won Super Bowl II with a 33–14 victory over the Oakland Raiders.[68] Lombardi stepped down as head coach after the game, and Phil Bengtson was named his successor.[69] Lombardi remained as general manager for one season but left in 1969 to become head coach and minority owner of the Washington Redskins.[70] After Lombardi died of cancer on September 3, 1970, the NFL renamed the Super Bowl trophy the Vince Lombardi Trophy in recognition of his accomplishments with the Packers.[71] The city of Green Bay renamed Highland Avenue in his honor in 1968, placing Lambeau Field at 1265 Lombardi Avenue ever since.[72] For about a quarter-century after Lombardi's departure, the Packers had relatively little on-field success. In the 24 seasons from 1968 to 1991, they had only five seasons with a winning record, one being the shortened 1982 strike season.[73][74] They appeared in the playoffs twice, with a 1–2 record. The period saw five different head coaches—Phil Bengtson, Dan Devine, Bart Starr, Forrest Gregg, and Lindy Infante—two of whom, Starr and Gregg, were Lombardi's era stars, while Bengtson was a former Packer coach. Each led the Packers to a worse record than his predecessor. Poor personnel decisions were rife, notoriously the 1974 trade by acting general manager Dan Devine which sent five 1975 or 1976 draft picks (two first-rounders, two-second-rounders and a third) to the Los Angeles Rams for aging quarterback John Hadl, who would spend only 11⁄2 seasons in Green Bay.[75] Another came in the 1989 NFL draft, when offensive lineman Tony Mandarich was taken with the second overall pick ahead of future Hall of Fame inductees Barry Sanders, Derrick Thomas, and Deion Sanders.[76] Though rated highly by nearly every professional scout at the time, Mandarich's performance failed to meet expectations, earning him ESPN's ranking as the third \"biggest sports flop\" in the last 25 years.[77] The Packers' performance in the 1970s, 1980s, and early 1990s led to a shakeup, with Ron Wolf hired as general manager and given full control of the team's football operations to start the 1991 season.[78] In 1992, Wolf hired San Francisco 49ers offensive coordinator Mike Holmgren as the Packers' new head coach.[79] Soon afterward, Wolf acquired quarterback Brett Favre from the Atlanta Falcons for a first-round pick.[80] Favre got the Packers their first win of the 1992 season, stepping in for injured quarterback Don Majkowski and leading a comeback over the Cincinnati Bengals.[81] He started the following week, a win against the Pittsburgh Steelers, and never missed another start for Green Bay through the end of the 2007 season. He would go on to break the record for consecutive starts by an NFL quarterback, starting 297 consecutive games including stints with the New York Jets and Minnesota Vikings with the streak finally coming to an end late in the 2010 season.[82] The Packers had a 9–7 record in 1992 and began to turn heads around the league when they signed perhaps the most prized free agent in NFL history in Reggie White on the defense in 1993.[83] White believed that Wolf, Holmgren, and Favre had the team heading in the right direction with a \"total commitment to winning\". With White on board, the Packers made it to the second round of the playoffs during both the 1993 and 1994 seasons but lost their 2nd-round matches to their playoff rival, the Dallas Cowboys, playing in Dallas on both occasions.[84][85] In 1995, the Packers won the NFC Central Division championship for the first time since 1972. After a home playoff 37–20 win against Favre's former team, the Atlanta Falcons, the Packers defeated the defending Super Bowl champion San Francisco 49ers 27–17 in San Francisco on the road to advance to the NFC Championship Game, where they lost again to the Dallas Cowboys 38–27.[86][87] In 1996, the Packers' turnaround was complete. The team posted a league-best 13–3 record in the regular season, dominating the competition and securing home-field advantage throughout the playoffs.[88] They were ranked no. 1 in offense with Brett Favre leading the way, no. 1 in defense with Reggie White as the leader of the defense, and no. 1 in special teams with former Heisman Trophy winner Desmond Howard returning punts and kickoffs for touchdowns.[89] After relatively easy wins against the San Francisco 49ers in a muddy 35–14 beatdown and Carolina Panthers 30–13, the Packers advanced to the Super Bowl for the first time in 29 years. In Super Bowl XXXI, Green Bay defeated the New England Patriots 35–21 to win their 12th championship. Desmond Howard was named MVP of the game for his kickoff return for a touchdown that ended the Patriots' bid for a comeback.[90] Then-Packers president Bob Harlan credited Wolf, Holmgren, Favre, and White for ultimately changing the fortunes of the organization and turning the Green Bay Packers into a model NFL franchise. A 2007 panel of football experts at ESPN ranked the 1996 Packers the 6th-greatest team ever to play in the Super Bowl. The following season the Packers recorded another 13–3 record and won their second consecutive NFC championship.[91] After defeating the Tampa Bay Buccaneers 21–7 and San Francisco 49ers 23–10 in the playoffs, the Packers returned to the Super Bowl as an 11⁠1/2⁠ point favorite. The team ended up losing in an upset to John Elway and the Denver Broncos in Super Bowl XXXII, by the score of 31–24.[92] In 1998, the Packers went 11–5 and met the San Francisco 49ers in the first round of the NFC playoffs. It was the fourth consecutive year these teams had met in the playoffs and the sixth overall contest since the 1995 season. The Packers had won all previous games, and the media speculated that another 49ers loss would result in the dismissal of San Francisco head coach Steve Mariucci. Unlike the previous playoff matches, this game was hotly contested, with the teams frequently exchanging leads. With 4:19 left in the 4th quarter, Brett Favre and the Packers embarked on an 89-yard drive, which concluded with a Favre touchdown pass to receiver Antonio Freeman. This play appeared to give Green Bay the victory. But San Francisco quarterback Steve Young led the 49ers on an improbable touchdown drive, which culminated when Terrell Owens caught Young's pass between several defenders to give the 49ers a lead with three seconds remaining. Afterward, the game was mired in controversy. Many argued that during the 49ers game-winning drive, Niners receiver Jerry Rice fumbled the ball but officials stated he was down by contact. Television replays confirmed the fumble, but referees were unable to review the play; the next season the NFL reinstituted an instant replay system.[93] In the end, this game turned out to be the end of an era in Green Bay. Days later Mike Holmgren left the Packers to become vice president, general manager, and head coach of the Seattle Seahawks. Much of Holmgren's coaching staff went with him, and Reggie White also retired after the season (but later played one season for the Carolina Panthers in 2000). In 1999, the team struggled to find an identity after the departure of so many of the individuals responsible for their Super Bowl run. Ray Rhodes was hired in 1999 as the team's new head coach.[94] Rhodes had served around the league as a highly regarded defensive coordinator and more recently experienced moderate success as head coach of the Philadelphia Eagles from 1995 to 1998. Ron Wolf believed that Rhodes' experience and player-friendly demeanor would fit nicely in Green Bay's veteran locker room, but Rhodes was fired after one 8–8 season.[95] Wolf visited team practice late in the 1999 season and believed that players had become too comfortable with Rhodes' style, and said the atmosphere resembled a country club. In 2000, Wolf replaced Rhodes with Mike Sherman.[96] Sherman had never been a head coach at any level of football and was relatively unknown in NFL circles. He had only coached in professional football for three years starting as the Packers' tight ends coach in 1997 and 1998. In 1999, he followed Mike Holmgren to Seattle and became the Seahawks' offensive coordinator, although Sherman did not call the plays during games. Despite Sherman's apparent anonymity, Wolf was blown away in the interview process by the coach's organizational skills and attention to detail. Sherman's inaugural season started slowly, but the Packers won their final four games to achieve a 9–7 record. Brett Favre praised the atmosphere Sherman had cultivated in Green Bay's locker room and fans were optimistic about the team's future. In the offseason, however, Wolf suddenly announced his own resignation as general manager to take effect after the April 2001 draft. Packers' president Bob Harlan was surprised by Wolf's decision and felt unsure of how to replace him. Harlan preferred the structure Green Bay had employed since 1991; a general manager who ran football operations and hired a subservient head coach. But with the momentum and locker room chemistry that was built during the 2000 season, Harlan was reluctant to bring in a new individual with a potentially different philosophy. Wolf recommended that Harlan give the job to Sherman. Though Harlan was wary of the structure in principle, he agreed with Wolf that it was the best solution. In 2001, Sherman assumed the duties of both general manager and head coach. From 2001 to 2004, Sherman coached the Packers to respectable regular-season success, led by the spectacular play of Brett Favre, Ahman Green, and a formidable offensive line. But Sherman's teams faltered in the playoffs. Before 2003, the Packers had never lost a home playoff game since the NFL instituted a post-season in 1933 (they were 13–0, with 11 of the wins at Lambeau and two more in Milwaukee.). That ended on January 4, 2003, when the Atlanta Falcons defeated the Packers 27–7 in an NFC Wild Card game. The Packers would also lose at home in the playoffs to the Minnesota Vikings two years later. By the end of the 2004 season, the Packers' team depth appeared to be diminishing. Sherman also seemed overworked and reportedly had trouble communicating with players on the practice field with whom he was also negotiating contracts. Harlan felt the dual roles were too much for one man to handle and removed Sherman from the general manager position in early 2005 while retaining him as a head coach. Harlan hired the Seattle Seahawks' vice president of operations Ted Thompson as the new executive vice president, general manager, and director of football operations. The relationship between Thompson and Sherman appeared strained, as Thompson immediately began rebuilding Green Bay's roster. Following a dismal 4–12 season, Thompson fired Sherman.[97] In 2006, Thompson hired Mike McCarthy, the former offensive coordinator for the San Francisco 49ers and New Orleans Saints, as his new head coach.[98] McCarthy had also previously served as the quarterbacks coach for the Packers in 1999. In McCarthy's debut year coaching the Packers, the team began the season with a 4–8 record. Then, Brett Favre sustained injuries, as did the backup quarterback, Aaron Rodgers. Despite the injuries, McCarthy coached the team to four consecutive wins, finishing with an 8–8 record.[99][100] After missing the playoffs in 2006, Brett Favre announced that he would return for the 2007 season; under McCarthy, it would turn out to be one of his best.[101] The Packers won 10 of their first 11 games and finished 13–3, earning a first-round bye in the playoffs. That was sufficient to propel McCarthy to secure the best record among active coaches through their first 25 games.[102] The Packers' passing offense, led by Favre and a very skilled wide receiver group, finished second in the NFC, behind the Dallas Cowboys, and third overall in the league. Running back Ryan Grant, acquired for a sixth-round draft pick from the New York Giants, became the featured back in Green Bay and rushed for 956 yards and 8 touchdowns in the final 10 games of the regular season. In the divisional playoff round, in a heavy snowstorm, the Packers beat the Seattle Seahawks 42–20. Grant rushed for 201 yards and three touchdowns, while Favre tossed an additional three touchdown passes to receiver Donald Driver (as well as a snowball, which Favre memorably threw at Driver in celebration).[103] On January 20, 2008, Green Bay appeared in their first NFC Championship Game in 10 years facing the New York Giants in Green Bay. The game was lost 23–20 on an overtime field goal by Lawrence Tynes. This would be Brett Favre's final game as a Green Bay Packer with his final pass being an interception in overtime.[104] Mike McCarthy coached the NFC team during the 2008 Pro Bowl in Hawaii. Al Harris and Aaron Kampman were also picked to play for the NFC Pro Bowl team as starters. Donald Driver was named as a third-string wideout on the Pro Bowl roster. Brett Favre was named the first-string quarterback for the NFC, but he declined to play in the Pro Bowl and was replaced on the roster by Tampa Bay quarterback Jeff Garcia. The Packers also had several first alternates, including offensive tackle Chad Clifton and linebacker Nick Barnett. In December 2007, Ted Thompson was signed to a 5-year contract extension with the Packers.[105] In addition, on February 5, 2008, head coach Mike McCarthy signed a 5-year contract extension.[106] On March 4, 2008, Brett Favre announced his retirement.[107] Within five months, however, he filed for reinstatement with the NFL on July 29. Favre's petition was granted by Commissioner Roger Goodell, effective August 4, 2008.[108] On August 6, 2008, it was announced that Brett Favre was traded to the New York Jets for a conditional draft pick in 2009.[109] The Packers began their 2008 season with their 2005 first-round draft pick, quarterback Aaron Rodgers, under center, as the first QB other than Favre to start for the Packers in 16 years. Rodgers played well in his first year starting for the Packers, throwing for over 4,000 yards and 28 touchdowns. However, injuries plagued the Packers' defense, as they lost 7 close games by 4 points or fewer, finishing with a 6–10 record.[110] After the season, eight assistant coaches were dismissed by the organization, including Bob Sanders, the team's defensive coordinator, who was replaced by Dom Capers.[111] In March 2009, the organization assured fans that Brett Favre's jersey number would be retired, but not during the 2009 season. In April 2009, the Packers selected nose tackle B. J. Raji of Boston College as the team's first pick in the draft. The team then traded three draft picks (including the pick the Packers acquired from the Jets for Brett Favre) for another first-round pick, selecting linebacker Clay Matthews III of the University of Southern California. During the 2009 NFL season, two matchups between the franchise and its former quarterback Brett Favre were highly anticipated after Favre's arrival with the division-rival Vikings in August. The first encounter took place in Week 4, on a Monday Night Football game that broke several TV audience records. The scheduling of this game was made possible when Baseball Commissioner and Packer board of directors member Bud Selig forced baseball's Minnesota Twins to play 2 games within 12 hours. The Vikings won the game 30–23. Brett Favre threw 3 TDs, no interceptions, and had a passer rating of 135.[112] The teams met for a second time in Week 8, Favre leading the Vikings to a second win, 38–26, in Green Bay. Rodgers was heavily pressured in both games, being sacked 14 times total, but still played well, throwing five touchdowns and only one interception. The next week, the Packers were upset by the winless Tampa Bay Buccaneers. Following a players-only meeting, the team found some stability on the offensive line with the return of right tackle Mark Tauscher bringing a minor halt to sacks to Rodgers and opening the running game to Ryan Grant and the other running backs. Green Bay finished the season strongly, winning 7 out of their last 8 games, including winning their 16th regular-season finale in the past 17 seasons, and earning an NFC wild-card playoff bid with an 11–5 regular-season record.[113] The Packers defense was ranked No. 2 and the offense was ranked No. 6 with rookies Brad Jones and Clay Matthews III becoming sensations at linebacker and young players like James Jones, Brandon Jackson, Jermichael Finley and Jordy Nelson becoming threats on offense. Rodgers also became the first quarterback in NFL history to throw for at least 4,000 yards in each of his first two seasons as a starter. Also, cornerback Charles Woodson won NFL Defensive Player of the Year honors after recording 9 interceptions, forcing four fumbles, 3 touchdowns, and registering 74 tackles and 2 sacks. In fact, Woodson's 9 interceptions were more than the 8 collected by all Packer opponents that season. Though the defense was ranked high, injuries to Al Harris, Tramon Williams, Will Blackmon, Atari Bigby and Brandon Underwood severely limited the depth of the secondary and teams like the Minnesota Vikings and Pittsburgh Steelers used that to their advantage by unleashing aerial assaults against inexperienced players with the NFL's best receivers. The season ended with an overtime loss in a wild card round shootout at the Arizona Cardinals, 51–45.[114] It was the second time McCarthy led the Packers to the postseason.[115] While they weren't as successful as their 90s counterparts in the postseason, the 2000s were by no means a dark time for the Packers.[116] The team finished the decade with the 5th highest winning percentage.[117] The team lost Johnny Jolly to a season long suspension after he violated the NFL drug policy.[118] Their running corps suffered a blow when RB Ryan Grant sustained a season ending ankle injury in Week 1.[119] By the end of the season, the team had 16 people on injured reserve, including 7 starters: running back Ryan Grant, tight end Jermichael Finley, inside linebacker Nick Barnett, safety Morgan Burnett, inside linebacker Brandon Chillar, right tackle Mark Tauscher, and outside linebacker Brad Jones. Key injuries didn't stop Mike McCarthy's team from finishing the regular season with a 10–6 record.[120] In week 7, the team faced the Minnesota Vikings, then led by former Packers quarterback Brett Favre. Green Bay beat Favre's new team 28–24 when Favre's final pass to Randy Moss in the end zone flew incomplete. In week 17, the Packers clinched their playoff berth with a 10–3 victory over the Chicago Bears at Lambeau Field, aided in large part by Nick Collins' interception of Jay Cutler's throw that allowed Green Bay to run out the clock.[121][122] The Packers 10–6 record allowed them to clinch the No. 6 seed in the NFC playoffs. They first faced No. 3 seeded Philadelphia, winning 21–16. In the Divisional round, they defeated No. 1 seed Atlanta 48–21. They then played the Chicago Bears at Soldier Field in the NFC Championship Game—only the second playoff meeting between the two storied rivals (the other a 33–14 Chicago victory which sent them to the 1941 NFL Championship Game). McCarthy's Packers won 21–14 to move on to Super Bowl XLV, having secured a 3–0 record in the postseason.[123] On the evening before the Super Bowl, McCarthy had each player fitted for a championship ring.[124] Aware of the motivational tactic, team president Mark Murphy instructed his organization to begin designing the ring.[125] The following day on February 6, 2011, they defeated the AFC champion Pittsburgh Steelers 31–25, becoming the first No. 6 seed from the NFC to win a Super Bowl. It was the first time the Packers had won the Lombardi Trophy since 1996.[126] Aaron Rodgers was named Super Bowl MVP.[127][128] During Super Bowl XLV, McCarthy's team initially enjoyed a comfortable 21–3 lead over the Steelers. Then, Charles Woodson had to leave the game with a broken collarbone and the Steelers' Hines Ward found the endzone to make the score 21–10 by halftime. During the third quarter, Pittsburgh scored 7 more points to make the score 21–17. In the fourth quarter, Green Bay's Clay Matthews tackled Pittsburgh's Rashard Mendenhall, and Desmond Bishop recovered the ball for a key turnover.[129][130] In 2011, coming off their victory in Super Bowl XLV, the Packers won their first 13 games, eventually finishing the season 15–1. The 15 victories marked the franchise record for wins in a season and tied for the second-most regular-season wins in NFL history, behind only the 2007 Patriots who went 16–0. Following the season, Aaron Rodgers would be named the NFL's MVP, his first such award. During that year, McCarthy's offensive strategies aided Rodgers in throwing for 4,643 yards and 45 touchdowns.[131] These strategies also propelled the Packers to lead the NFL in scoring that year.[132] Despite receiving homefield advantage, Green Bay lost their first postseason game to eventual Super Bowl XLVI champion New York Giants, 37–20.[133] Finishing the 2012 season with an 11–5 record and their second straight division title, the Packers beat the Minnesota Vikings in the NFC wild-card round 24–10, but lost in the divisional round of the playoffs to the eventual NFC Champion San Francisco 49ers by a score of 45–31.[134] The Packers offense finished the season fifth in points and 11th in yards per game. Under McCarthy, Rodgers passed for 4,295 yards.[135] The defense finished 11th in points allowed and 22nd in yards allowed per game. The Packers topped the first-ever AP Pro32 rankings, a new pro football version of the AP Top 25 college football and basketball polls.[136] In 2013, the Packers started 5–2, leading up to a Week 9 match up against the Bears. It was in that game that the Packers lost Aaron Rodgers to a broken collarbone;[137] Rodgers would miss the next six games, during which the club would go 2–3–1 under three different quarterbacks: Seneca Wallace (injured during first start), Scott Tolzien (benched), and Matt Flynn. Despite having a 7–7–1 record, the Packers were still in a position to win the NFC North division, if they were able to win their final game. With Rodgers returning, the Packers managed to beat the Bears in a Week 9 rematch, 33–28. Finishing at 8–7–1, the Packers won their division and were awarded a home playoff game. It was the fifth consecutive time that McCarthy led his team to a playoff appearance.[138] However, despite Rodgers' return, the Packers would lose to the San Francisco 49ers 20–23 in the first round of the playoffs.[139] The Packers recorded their 700th victory, against the Bears, in Week 4.[140] The team went undefeated at home for the first time since the 2011 season; they also led the league in scoring, with 486 points, the second-most in franchise history. The 2014 season also marked the first time since 2009 that the team had a 4,000-yard passer, two 1,000-yard receivers, and a 1,000-yard rusher. McCarthy led an offense that finished sixth in the league in total offense.[141] After winning against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers in Week 16, McCarthy (99 wins) passed Hall of Famer Vince Lombardi (98) on the all-time wins list for the Packers.[142] Overall, the team went 12–4, clinching the No. 2 seed in the NFC and a fourth consecutive NFC North division title, making the playoffs for the sixth straight season, tying a franchise record. The Packers beat the Cowboys in the divisional round, advancing to the NFC Championship to face the Seattle Seahawks. After leading throughout most of regulation, the Packers lost 28–22 in a historic overtime rally by Seattle.[143] Following the season, quarterback Aaron Rodgers was named the league's Most Valuable Player for the second time.[144] During Week 2 of the preseason against the Pittsburgh Steelers, wide receiver Jordy Nelson caught an eight-yard pass from Aaron Rodgers but then fell to the turf without contact. A few days later, it was revealed that Nelson had torn his ACL. He would remain inactive for the rest of the 2015 season.[145] Even without Nelson, the Packers managed to get off to a 6–0 start, but the Packers then lost four of their next five games, falling to 7–4.[146] On December 3, against the Detroit Lions, the Packers quickly fell to a 20–0 deficit going into halftime. Green Bay started to make a comeback in the second half thanks to a touchdown by Davante Adams and a 27-yard touchdown run by Aaron Rodgers to bring the game within two points at 23–21. The Packers then got the ball back in their possession with 23 seconds left in the game. While attempting a \"lateral\" play, Rodgers was sacked with no time remaining but then a flag was thrown for a facemask penalty on Detroit. The Packers now had one more un-timed play, which Aaron Rodgers threw a 61-yard Hail Mary touchdown to tight end Richard Rodgers II.[147] It was the longest Hail Mary touchdown pass thrown in NFL history.[148] Up until week 14, McCarthy delegated playcalling duties to associate head coach Tom Clements. However, the team's struggling offense made McCarthy decide to take back play-calling duties. During that first game that McCarthy resumed play calling, the Packers ran the ball for 230 yards in 44 carries.[149] Green Bay then finished the season 10–6 and 2nd in the NFC North behind the Minnesota Vikings. The Packers beat the Washington Redskins in the NFC wild-card game to advance to the divisional round with the Arizona Cardinals. A similar play to tie the game against the Cardinals happened between Aaron Rodgers and Jeff Janis. Janis caught a 41-yard touchdown from Rodgers which sent the game into overtime. However, the Packers fell to Arizona 26–20, ending their season.[150] After a 4–6 start to the season, the Packers went on a six-game winning streak to finish the regular season with a 10–6 record. The team clinched the NFC North for the fifth time in six years with their Week 17 win over the Detroit Lions. After the regular season, the success of his team made McCarthy the fourth head coach in NFL history to guide his team to eight or more consecutive playoff appearances.[151] They routed the fifth-seeded New York Giants, 38–13, in the wild-card round of the playoffs and upset the top-seeded Dallas Cowboys, 34–31, in the divisional round of the playoffs, but their season came to an end when they were beaten by the second-seeded Atlanta Falcons in the NFC Championship Game, 44–21.[152][153][154] The Green Bay Packers began the 2017 regular season with a 4–2 record.[155] On October 15, during a week 6 game against the Minnesota Vikings, Aaron Rodgers was driven to the ground by Vikings linebacker Anthony Barr after throwing a pass. Rodgers suffered a broken collarbone during the play,[156] and the Packers placed him on injured reserve on October 20, with the stipulation that he could return in eight weeks (following NFL rules), especially if the injury healed quickly and the Packers were still in playoff contention.[157] Rodgers did indeed return to the field for a week 15 game against the Carolina Panthers on December 17, but the Packers were eliminated from the playoff hunt after a 31–24 loss. The team placed Rodgers back on injured reserve after the game, a move that prompted several teams to complain that the Packers had violated the NFL's rules about reactivating injured players.[158] During Rodgers' absence, backup quarterback Brett Hundley stepped into the starting role for the first time in his professional career, but struggled to replicate Rodgers' success, despite a Pro Bowl-caliber season by receiver Davante Adams.[159] In a 23–0 loss to the Baltimore Ravens in week 11, the Packers suffered their first shutout at Lambeau Field in 11 years (the last time was a 35–0 loss to the New England Patriots in 2006).[160] The Packers finished the season at 7–9, missing the playoffs for the first time since 2008. Off the field, the Packers organization opened the Titletown District adjacent to Lambeau Field. This shopping, entertainment, and restaurant district includes a public plaza, park, and various commercial businesses.[161] In 2018, the Packers again failed to qualify for the playoffs, finishing third in the NFC North with a record of 6–9–1.[162][163] Following a Week 13 loss to the Arizona Cardinals, Mike McCarthy was released as head coach, replaced by Offensive Coordinator Joe Philbin on an interim basis.[164][165][166] McCarthy left Green Bay having tallied a 125–77–2 (.618) regular season record, as well as a postseason record of 10–8 (.556). His total record with the Packers was 135–85–2. McCarthy had brought the team to nine playoff berths and facilitated one Super Bowl win.[167] Following the season, Matt LaFleur, the Offensive Coordinator of the Tennessee Titans the prior season, was hired as the Packers' new coach.[168] Under first-year head coach Matt LaFleur, Aaron Rodgers and the Packers opened the season by defeating the Chicago Bears in the season's opening game, the first time since 2003 that the league-wide kickoff game did not feature the defending Super Bowl champions, with the Packers and Bears being selected for their historic rivalry in the NFL's 100th season.[169] The Packers returned to the playoffs for the first time since 2016, finishing with a record of 13–3 and securing a first-round bye as the NFC's second seed.[170] They defeated the Seattle Seahawks 28–23 in the NFC Divisional round to advance to the NFC Championship game, where they were defeated 37–20 by the San Francisco 49ers.[171] In 2020, the Green Bay Packers won the NFC North Division for the second consecutive year.[172] They also earned a first-round bye, with the top seed in the NFC. They defeated the Los Angeles Rams 32–18 in the Divisional Round,[173] but fell to the underdog Tampa Bay Buccaneers in the NFC championship[174]- their fourth straight loss in the game in five appearances under Rodgers. Rodgers won his third MVP award during the season.[175] The next year, they clinched the top seed in the NFC again, with a 13–4 record, before losing 13–10 to the 49ers in the Divisional round. The special teams unit was consistently the worst in the NFL during the season, though their defense was noted as an improvement from previous seasons.[176] The special teams was especially costly in the postseason game as a field goal attempt and punt were both blocked, the latter of which the 49ers returned for a touchdown.[177] The defense did not allow any touchdowns in that game, as the only other points the 49ers scored were off two field goals. Matt LaFleur became the first coach to have three straight 13-win seasons, however, none of them ended with a trip to the Super Bowl.[178] For his performance in the season, Aaron Rodgers won his fourth MVP award- the second most for any quarterback, only behind Peyton Manning who has five.[179] In the 2022 season, the Green Bay Packers struggled and were eliminated from advancing to the NFL's wild-card playoffs when they lost their last regular-season game 20–16 to the Detroit Lions.[180] This was the first time the team missed the playoffs during Matt LaFleur's coaching stint. The team finished with an 8–9 record.[181] The 2023 season was the first without longtime quarterback Aaron Rodgers, who was traded to the New York Jets during the offseason.[182] Jordan Love, who was drafted to the Green Bay Packers in 2020,[183] took over as starting quarterback. The team finished with an 9–8 record which secured 2nd place in the NFC North division, and the 7th seed in the NFC.[184] The Packers defeated the 2nd seed Dallas Cowboys 48–32 in their Wild-Card matchup, becoming the first 7th seed team to win a playoff game.[185] The Packers would go on to lose to the 1st seed San Francisco 49ers 24–21 in the Divisional round.[186] Following the loss, the team announced that Defensive coordinator Joe Barry would not return next season.[187] The Packers are the only community-owned franchise in North America's four traditional major leagues.[a][13][188][189] Rather than being the property of an individual, partnership, or corporate entity, they are held by stockholders, more than 537,000 in total as of 2022. No one is allowed to hold more than 200,000 shares.[5] It is this broad-based community support and non-profit structure[190] which has kept the team in Green Bay for nearly a century even though it is the smallest market in North American professional sports.[a] The city of Green Bay had a population of only 107,395 as of the 2020 census,[191] and 600,000 in its television market, significantly less than the average NFL figures. The team, however, has long had an extended fan base throughout Wisconsin and parts of the Midwest, thanks in part to playing one pre-season and three regular-season home games each year in Milwaukee through 1995. It was only when baseball-only Miller Park preempted football there that the Packers' home slate became played entirely in Green Bay. As of 2021, there have been six stock sales to fund Packer operations over the team's history, beginning with $5,000 being raised through 1,000 shares offered at $5 apiece in 1923.[192] The latest was in November 2021, where they sold almost 200,000 shares.[193] The original \"Articles of Incorporation for the Green Bay Football Corporation\", enacted in 1923, specified that should the franchise be sold, any post-expenses money would have gone to the Sullivan-Wallen Post of the American Legion to build \"a proper soldier's memorial\". This stipulation was included to ensure there could never be any financial inducement for shareholders to move the club from Green Bay. At the November 1997 annual meeting, shareholders voted to change the beneficiary from the Sullivan-Wallen Post to the Green Bay Packers Foundation, which makes donations to many charities and institutions throughout Wisconsin.[194] Even though it is referred to as \"common stock\" in corporate offering documents, a share of Packers stock does not share the same rights traditionally associated with common or preferred stock. It does not include an equity interest, does not pay dividends, cannot be traded, has no securities-law protection, and brings no season ticket purchase privileges. All shareholders receive are voting rights, an invitation to the corporation's annual meeting, and an opportunity to buy exclusive shareholder-only merchandise.[190] Shares of stock cannot be resold, except back to the team for a fraction of the original price. While new shares can be given as gifts, transfers are technically allowed only between immediate family members once ownership has been established.[194] Green Bay is the only team with this form of ownership structure in the NFL, which does not comply with current league rules stipulating a maximum of 32 owners per team, with one holding a minimum 30% stake. The Packers' corporation was grandfathered when the NFL's current ownership policy was established in the 1980s.[195] As a publicly held nonprofit, the Packers are also the only American major-league sports franchise to release its financial balance sheet every year. Green Bay Packers, Inc., is governed by a seven-member executive committee elected from a 45-member board of directors. It consists of a president, vice president, treasurer, secretary, and three members-at-large; only the president is compensated. Responsibilities include directing corporate management, approving major capital expenditures, establishing broad policy, and monitoring management performance. The team's elected president normally represents the Packers in NFL owner's meetings. During his time as coach, Vince Lombardi generally represented the team at league meetings in his role as general manager, except at owners-only meetings, where president Dominic Olejniczak appeared.[1] The team created the Green Bay Packers Foundation in December 1986. It assists in a wide variety of activities and programs benefiting education, civic affairs, health services, human services and youth-related programs.[196] At the team's 1997 annual stockholders meeting the foundation was designated in place of a Sullivan-Wallen Post soldiers memorial as the recipient of any residual assets upon the team's sale or dissolution. The Packers have an exceptionally loyal fan base. Regardless of team performance, every game played in Green Bay—preseason, regular season, and playoffs—has been sold out since 1960.[197] Despite the Packers having by far the smallest local TV market, the team consistently ranks as one of the most popular in the NFL.[198] They also have one of the longest season ticket waiting lists in professional sports: 140,000 names long, more than there are seats at Lambeau Field.[199][200][201] The average wait is said to be over 30 years,[202] but with only 90 or so tickets turned over annually it would be 955 years before the newest name on the list got theirs.[200] As a result, season tickets are willed to next of kin, and newborns are placed optimistically on the waiting list.[203] Packers fans are often referred to as cheeseheads,[204] a nickname for Wisconsin residents reflecting the state's bountiful cheese production first leveled as an insult at a 1987 game between the Chicago White Sox and Milwaukee Brewers. Instead, it came to be a statewide source of pride, and particularly since 1994 has been embraced by Packers fans.[204] Bright orange triangular cheesehead hats are a fixture wherever the team plays. During training camp in the summer months, held outside the Don Hutson Center, young Packers fans can bring their bikes and have their favorite players ride them from the locker room to practice at Ray Nitschke Field. This old tradition began around the time of Lambeau Field's construction in 1957. Gary Knafelc, a Packers end at the time, said, \"I think it was just that kids wanted us to ride their bikes. I can remember kids saying, 'Hey, ride my bike.'\"[205] The team holds an annual scrimmage called Family Night, typically an intra-squad affair, at Lambeau Field. During 2004 and 2005 sellout crowds of over 60,000 fans showed up, with an all-time mark of 62,492 set in 2005 when the Buffalo Bills appeared.[206] In August 2008, ESPN.com ranked Packers fans as second-best in the NFL.[207] The team initially finished tied with the Pittsburgh Steelers (who finished ahead of the Packers) as having the best fans, but the tie was broken by ESPN's own John Clayton, a Pittsburgh native. Needing to outfit his new squad, team founder Curly Lambeau solicited funds from his employer, the Indian Packing Company. He was given $500 for uniforms and equipment in return for the team being named for its sponsor. An early newspaper article referred to the fledglings as \"the Indians\", but by the time they played their first game \"Packers\" had taken hold. Indian Packing was purchased in 1920 by the Acme Packing Company. Acme continued to support the team, which played its first NFL season with \"ACME PACKERS\" emblazoned on its jerseys. Lambeau, a Notre Dame alumnus, borrowed its Irish's navy blue and gold team colors, much as George Halas borrowed his Illinois alma mater's for the Chicago Bears. As a result, the early Packers were often referred to as the \"Bays\" or the \"Blues\" (and even occasionally as \"the Big Bay Blues\"). By 1950, Green Bay replaced navy blue with kelly green but kept what was by then a lighter shade of athletic gold. Navy blue was kept as a secondary color, seen primarily on sideline capes, but was quietly dropped on all official materials shortly after that. In 1958, this kelly green was replaced by a darker hunter green; it and athletic gold have served as the team colors since. The team's current uniform combination of forest green or white jerseys and metallic gold pants was adopted soon after Vince Lombardi arrived in 1959. However, to celebrate the NFL's 75th anniversary in 1994, the Packers joined in a league-wide donning of \"throwback\" jerseys, back to navy blue and gold. The team would go throwback again for two Thanksgiving Day games against the Detroit Lions, in blue and gold 1930s-era uniforms in 2001, and 1960s green and gold (only slightly different from the current ones) in 2003.[209][210] In 1951, the team finally stopped wearing leather helmets, adopting the metallic gold plastic headgear it has used ever since. The oval \"G\" logo was added in 1961 when Lombardi asked Packers equipment manager Gerald \"Dad\" Braisher to design a logo. Braisher tasked his assistant, St. Norbert College art student John Gordon. Satisfied with a football-shaped letter \"G\", the pair presented it to Lombardi, who then approved the addition.[211] Tiki Barber falsely reported[212] it to stand for \"greatness\" without a reliable source to back up his claims. Other reputable media outlets then published similar stories using Barber's false claim as a source.[213] The Packers' Assistant Director of PR and Corporate Communications had the following to say: \"There's nothing in our history that suggests there's any truth to this. The Packers Hall of Fame archivist said the same thing.\"[214] The team used several different logos before 1961, but the \"G\" is the only logo that has ever appeared on the helmet.[215][216] The Packers hold the trademark on the \"G\" logo, and have granted limited permission to other organizations to utilize a similar logo, such as the University of Georgia and Grambling State University, in addition to the city of Green Bay itself as part of its civic logo.[217] Adopted in 1964, the Georgia \"G\", though different in design and color, was similar to the Packers' \"G\". Then-Georgia head coach Vince Dooley thought it best to clear the use of Georgia's new emblem with the Packers.[218] While several NFL teams choose to wear white jerseys at home early in the season due to white's ability to reflect the late summer sun rays, the Packers have done so only twice, during the opening two games of the 1989 season. In 2016, the Packers debuted their Color Rush uniform, wearing white pants and socks with a white uniform.[219] This set has been worn five times, four of them at home and two against the Chicago Bears. In 2024, the all-white Color Rush uniform would be paired with a new alternate white helmet, which is essentially the primary helmet minus the gold elements.[220] Although alternate gold jerseys with green numbers are sold on a retail basis, the team currently has no plans to introduce such a jersey to be used in actual games. During the 2010 season, the Packers paid tribute to their historical roots with a throwback jersey modeled after that worn by the club in 1929, during its first championship season. The jersey was navy blue with a gold circle and navy numbers, again making the Packers \"the Blues\".[221][222] These were then changed in 2015 to the navy blue throwback worn from 1937 to 1949, featuring gold shoulders and numbers.[223] In 2021, the Packers changed their throwback thirds to an all-green design, resembling the uniforms worn from 1950 to 1953.[224] Originally, the Packers wore brown helmets with the throwbacks, but in 2013, they started wearing their gold helmets without any decals due to the then-implementation of the NFL's one-shell rule; this rule has been abolished in 2022. As a result, they changed their throwbacks in both 2015 and 2021 to properly recreate those original uniforms, which had gold helmets with them. Upon the NFL's switch of uniform suppliers in 2012 to Nike from Reebok,[225] the Packers refused any changes to their uniform in any way outside of the required supplier's logo and new league uniform logos, declining all of Nike's \"Elite 51\" enhancements, including retaining the traditional striped collar of the jersey rather than Nike's new collar design.[226] The Packers and Chicago Bears have been rivals since their team's inception in 1920, becoming one of the oldest and most storied rivalries in the league's history. The Packers currently lead the series 107–95–6,[227] and the teams have met twice in the postseason. The Bears won the 1941 meeting, 33–14, and eventually defeated the New York Giants in the 1941 NFL Championship Game, and the Packers won the 2011 meeting, 21–14, en route to a Super Bowl XLV win over the Pittsburgh Steelers. The teams' first meeting was a victory for the Bears (known as the Staleys at the time) in 1921 in a shutout, 20–0. The Packers claimed their first win over the Bears in 1925, 14–10. The 1924 matchup (which ended in a 3–0 win for Chicago) was notable for featuring the first-ever ejection of players in a game in NFL history, as Frank Hanny of the Bears and Walter Voss of the Packers were ejected for punching each other.[228] The rivalry also featured one of the last successful fair catch kicks in 1968, when Bears kicker Mac Percival kicked the game-winning field goal.[229] As of the 2023 season, the Packers lead the all-time series 107–95–6.[230] The rivalry between the Packers and Minnesota Vikings began in 1961, similar to their other divisional rivalries. It is also considered to be one of the most intense rivalries in the NFL, due to the intensity of most of the matchups over the years, As is the case with many of their respective state's college teams sharing a rivalry; (Minnesota and Wisconsin) have a rivalry in multiple sports, seen between the Big Ten rivals, the University of Wisconsin and University of Minnesota. Events such as Randy Moss mooning the Green Bay crowd in the first playoff game between these two teams (won by the Vikings), and former Packer great Brett Favre's move to the Vikings have created more resentment between these teams. The Packers lead the all-time series 66–59–3, despite the two teams splitting their two playoff contests.[231] The Packers' rivalry with the Detroit Lions has been another one of the oldest regular matchups in the NFL. They first met in 1930 when the Lions were known as the Portsmouth Spartans and based in Portsmouth, Ohio. The team eventually moved to Detroit for the 1934 season. The Lions and Packers have been division rivals since 1933 and have always met at least twice a season since 1932, without any canceled games between both rivals. The Packers lead the series 106–76–7 as of the end of the 2022 season, the first time in NFL history that a team has recorded 100 wins over an opponent.[232] The rivalry between the Packers and Dallas Cowboys has resulted in several notable games in league history, including the \"Ice Bowl\" and other games impacting the playoff race.[233] The rivalry heated up during the 2010s, with several of their games impacting the NFC playoff race during that decade. During the Brett Favre era in Green Bay, the Cowboys dominated the rivalry, going 9–2 (including 9–0 in Dallas) against the Packers when Favre was the quarterback. However, in the Aaron Rodgers era from 2008 to 2022, the Packers have dominated the rivalry, as Rodgers had an 8–2 record against the Cowboys with Green Bay, including a perfect 3–0 record in Dallas. The Packers lead the all-time series 22–17. The Packers lead 5–4 in the playoffs, with the last playoff match taking place in January 2024 at AT&T Stadium in the Wild Card round with a 48–32 Packers win.[234] The rivalry between the Packers and the San Francisco 49ers ignited during the 1990s, with the two teams facing each other in four consecutive playoff games. The Packers won four of five playoff games against the 49ers with Brett Favre as its quarterback, with four of those games pitting Favre against the 49ers' Hall of Fame quarterback Steve Young. Since 2012, the 49ers have defeated the Aaron Rodgers-led Packers four times in the playoffs.[235] The Packers currently lead the series 38–33–1, but the 49ers have won the last four postseason meetings to take a 5–4 lead.[236][237] Following Seattle's relocation to the NFC in 2002, the Packers have faced the Seattle Seahawks multiple times in the playoffs, developing an intense rivalry as well. Some notable moments include the clubs' first playoff meeting in 2003 in which Seahawks quarterback Matt Hasselbeck threw a game-losing pick-six in overtime after guaranteeing a game-winning drive,[238] the Fail Mary, and Russell Wilson overcoming four interceptions and a 16–0 Packers lead to lead Seattle to a 28–22 overtime win to advance to Super Bowl XLIX.[239] As of the 2023 season, the Packers lead the all-time series 15–9.[240] The series between the Packers and New York Giants has been one of the oldest regular matchups in the league as the two teams first met in 1928. The two teams have played since 1970 in the National Football Conference, and they play each other in the regular season either every three years or depending on its NFC division placement, and in the postseason, The Packers lead the all-time series 34–27–2 and postseason series 5–3.[241] The Tampa Bay Buccaneers and Packers were division rivals from 1977 to 2002 when both were in the NFC Central division. The teams have played several notable games, including a Snow Bowl game in 1985, a playoff game in 1998 and the NFC Championship Game in 2021.[242] As of the 2023 season, the Packers lead the series 34–23–1.[243] After their early seasons at Bellevue Park and Hagemeister Park, the Packers played home games in City Stadium from 1925 to 1956.[244] The team won its first six NFL championships there. By the 1950s, the wooden 25,000-seat arena was considered outmoded.[245] The NFL threatened to move the franchise to Milwaukee full-time unless it got a better stadium.[246] The city responded by building a new 32,150 seat City Stadium for the team, the first built exclusively for an NFL team, which opened in time for the 1957 season.[247] It was renamed Lambeau Field in 1965 to honor Curly Lambeau, who had died earlier in the year.[248] Expanded seven times before the end of the 1990s, Lambeau Field capacity reached 60,890. In 2003, it was extensively renovated to expand seating, modernize stadium facilities, and add an atrium area. Even with a current seating capacity of 72,928, ticket demand far outpaces supply, as all Packers games have been sold out since 1960. About 86,000 names are on the waiting list for season tickets.[200] The Packers played part of their home slate in Milwaukee starting in 1933, including two to three home games each year in Milwaukee's County Stadium from 1953 to 1994. Indeed, County Stadium had been built partly to entice the Packers to move to Milwaukee full-time. The Packers worked to capture their growing fan base in Milwaukee and the larger crowds. By the 1960s, the threat of an American Football League franchise in Milwaukee prompted the Packers to stay, including scheduling a Western Conference Championship game in 1967. County Stadium was built primarily as a baseball stadium and made only the bare minimum adjustments to accommodate football. At its height, it only seated 56,000 people, just barely above the NFL minimum; many of those seats were badly obstructed. The field was just barely large enough to fit a football field. Both teams shared the same sideline (separated by a piece of tape) and the end zones extended onto the warning track. By 1994, improvements and seating expansions at Lambeau, along with the Brewers preparing to campaign for their new stadium prompted the Packers to play their full slate in Green Bay for the first time in 62 years. Former season ticketholders for the Milwaukee package continue to receive preference for one pre-season and the second and fifth regular-season games at Lambeau Field each season, along with playoff games through a lottery under the \"Gold Package\" plan.[249] The Packers have three practice facilities across the street from Lambeau Field in Ashwaubenon, Wisconsin: the Don Hutson Center, an indoor facility; Ray Nitschke Field, an outdoor field with artificial FieldTurf; and Clarke Hinkle Field, an outdoor field with natural grass.[250] The Packers Pro Shop has been the official retail store of the Packers since 1989. The primary retail store is located at Lambeau Field, having been expanded numerous times since it opened. The Pro Shop reported sales of over $7 million in 2015.[251][252] This is a partial list of the Packers' last five completed seasons. For the full season-by-season franchise results, see List of Green Bay Packers seasons.[253] Note: The Finish, Wins, Losses, and Ties columns list regular season results and exclude any postseason play. As of January 2023 The Packers have been league champions a record 13 times,[25] topping their nearest rival, the Chicago Bears, by four. The first three were decided by league standing, the next six by the NFL Title Game, and the last four by Super Bowl victories. The Packers are also the only team to win three consecutive NFL titles, having accomplished this twice—from 1929 to 1931 under Lambeau, and from 1965 to 1967 under Lombardi. Starting in 1966, the NFL began holding the Super Bowl. The Packers have won four Super Bowls.[258] From 1933 to 1969, the NFL held a championship game to decide their champion. The Packers won 8 NFL Championship Games. From 1966 to 1969, the NFL Championship Game was followed by the Super Bowl.[259] The Packers have won three NFC Championship Games, with twice as many losses. NFC Championships did not exist before the AFL–NFL merger in 1970.[260] From 1920 to 1932, the NFL championship was awarded based on standings, with no championship game taking place. The Packers won three such championships.[261] The Packers have won 21 divisional championships. Running backs (RB) Wide receivers (WR) Tight ends (TE) Defensive linemen (DL) Defensive backs (DB) Special teams Reserve 52 active, 5 reserve, 16 practice squad (+1 exempt) The Packers have the second most members in the Pro Football Hall of Fame with 30, 25 of which were inducted as Packers. They trail only the Chicago Bears with 37 Hall of Famers, 30 of which were inducted as Bears.[262] Many Packers players and coaches are also enshrined in the Wisconsin Athletic Hall of Fame.[263] In 2018 Ron Wolf, the most recent Packers contributor to be honored, was inducted.[264] In nearly nine decades of Packers football, the Packers have formally retired six numbers.[265] All six Packers are members of the Pro Football Hall of Fame and their numbers and names are displayed on the green facade of Lambeau Field's north endzone as well as in the Lambeau Field Atrium. The Green Bay Packers Hall of Fame was the first hall of fame built to honor a single professional American football team. John P. Holloway, a Brown County administrator and arena director, and William L. Brault, a Green Bay restaurateur and Packers fan, co-founded the Packer Hall of Fame museum[266] in 1966. As of 2019, the Packers Hall of Fame has inducted 162 people, 24 of whom have been inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame.[267] → Coaching staff → Front office → More NFL staffs [268] *Interim head coaches The Packers are unique in having their market area cover two media markets, both Green Bay and Milwaukee. NFL blackout restrictions for the team apply within both areas. However, Packers games have not been blacked out locally since 1972 (the last year home game local telecasts were prohibited regardless of sellout status) due to strong home attendance and popularity. As mentioned above, every Packers home game—preseason, regular season and playoffs—has been sold out since 1960.[269] The flagship station of the Packers Radio Network is Good Karma Brands's WTMJ in Milwaukee, which was the former flagship of the Journal Broadcast Group before its merger with E. W. Scripps Company in April 2015; Scripps itself sold their Milwaukee radio assets to GKB in November 2018, and the team then brought their broadcast operations in-house, thus the personnel is directly employed by the team. WTMJ has aired Packers games since 1929, the longest association between a radio station and an NFL team to date, and the only rights deal in American professional sports where a station outside of the team's main metro area is the radio flagship. While this might be unusual, the station can be heard at city-grade strength at all hours in Green Bay proper. Games air in Green Bay on WTAQ (1360/97.5) and WIXX-FM (101.1), and WAPL (105.7) and WHBY (1150) in Appleton and the Fox Cities.[270] Wayne Larrivee is the play-by-play announcer and Larry McCarren is the color analyst. Larrivee joined the team after many years as the Chicago Bears' announcer.[271] Jim Irwin and Max McGee were the longtime radio announcers before Larrivee and McCarren. When victory is assured for the Packers, either a game-winning touchdown, interception or a crucial 4th down defensive stop, Larrivee's trademark declaration of \"And there is your dagger!\" signifies the event. In limited circumstances where the Milwaukee Brewers are in either playoff or post-season contention and their play-by-play takes priority, WTMJ's sister FM station WKTI (94.5) currently airs Packer games to avert game conflicts. Surrounding pre-game programming is also carried on sister station WAUK (540), an ESPN Radio affiliate and former competitor which produced unofficial Packers programming for years. On October 27, 2021, the Packers announced that it would end its longtime association with WTMJ at the end of the season, with iHeartMedia's sports radio station WRNW (97.3) becoming the team's Milwaukee radio affiliate in 2022.[272] The TV rights for pre-season games not nationally broadcast are held by E. W. Scripps Company-owned television stations WGBA-TV (channel 26) in Green Bay and WTMJ-TV (channel 4) in Milwaukee;[273] the game broadcasts are distributed to 19 further TV stations in Wisconsin, Michigan, North Dakota, South Dakota, Iowa, Nebraska, Illinois, Missouri, and Alaska, as well as Spanish-language WYTU-LD \"Telemundo Wisconsin\" in Milwaukee.[274] The deal marked a change in affiliate in Green Bay from WFRV-TV; in the wake of the 2012 deal, McCarren resigned his duties as sports director of WFRV to move to WTMJ/WGBA as a Packers analyst, becoming WGBA's official sports director on April 1, 2013.[275][276] McCarren left WGBA in 2015 and became a team employee.[277] The team's intra-squad Lambeau scrimmage at the beginning of the season, marketed as Packers Family Night, was produced for over a decade by WLUK-TV in Green Bay and broadcast by the state's Fox affiliates through the 2016 season.[278] In 2017, Scripps and the Packers Television Network began to originate the Packers Family Night broadcast.[279] Preseason television games are announced by Kevin Harlan, son of former Packers president Bob Harlan, and color commentator Rich Gannon.[274] Regular-season and postseason games not aired on a broadcast network are simulcast on broadcast stations in the Green Bay and Milwaukee markets. On the television sitcom That '70s Show, in season 7 episode 14, Donna Pinciotti gave the gang—including Red Forman, a long-time Packer fan—six free tickets to Lambeau Field for a game against the Chicago Bears. Eric comes back wearing Bears Jersey # 34 Sweetness Walter Payton causing the crowd to boo and make negative comments towards him. Eric doesn't understand football in general. In the season 8 finale, Red declined to move to Florida after Steven Hyde bought him season tickets.[280] In 2015, five members of the Packers (David Bakhtiari, Don Barclay, T. J. Lang, Clay Matthews, and Josh Sitton) made an appearance as an a cappella group in the musical comedy Pitch Perfect 2. Aaron Rodgers' brother Jordan also appeared.[281] That same year, Rodgers himself appeared in an episode of the sketch comedy television series Key & Peele, along with Ha Ha Clinton-Dix.[282] In the television series Danny Phantom, the main antagonist, Vlad Masters/Vlad Plasmius, is a Packers \"Fanatic\". His prized possession is a football autographed by Ray Nitschke, and his dream is to own the team.[283] In the 1998 film There's Something about Mary, Mary, played by actress Cameron Diaz, consistently talks about her boyfriend \"Brett\". It is revealed towards the end of the film that \"Brett\" is then-Packers' quarterback Brett Favre.[284]",

                "title": "Game Recap: Cowboys take away win, 30-14",
                "content": "Editor of Dallas Cowboys Star Magazine / Dallas Cowboys Game Program Sure, this was a game between two teams with losing records and not much to play for in terms of the playoffs. And yes, there were plenty of penalties and mistakes made. But the Dallas Cowboys did what they needed to do. They took care of business against Carolina with a defense that largely dominated the Panthers in a 30-14 victory. Despite receiving the bad news on Saturday that cornerback Trevon Diggs was being shut down for season-ending knee surgery, the Dallas defense was simply no match for the lowly Panthers. Micah Parsons and company produced six sacks and four turnovers, which now gives the unit 14 takeaways in its last seven games. In addition, Carolina quarterback Bryce Young was held to just 219 yards passing with a touchdown and two interceptions for a 73.4 passer rating, while the Panthers' ground game was limited to only 60 yards rushing On the other side of the ball, the Cowboys offense was spearheaded by explosive wideout CeeDee Lamb. Despite still playing with a banged-up shoulder, he hauled in nine passes for a game-high 116 yards and a touchdown. He was one of seven players who caught passes from Cooper Rush with three different receivers scoring overall. The quarterback finished with 214 yards through the air, three touchdowns and no interceptions for a 119 rating. And after having never rushed for 100 yards in his first 47 career games, including the playoffs, Rico Dowdle has now topped the century mark in each of his last three. He rumbled through the Panthers for 149 yards on 25 carries, both of which set new career highs. In all, the Cowboys totaled 410 yards of offense, were good on 50 percent of their third-down tries and reached the end zone on 75 percent of their trips to the red zone. They also held the time of possession advantage, 33:46 to 26:14. With the victory, the 173rd of his career, Mike McCarthy moved past Hall of Famer Bill Parcells for 13th place on the all-time wins list for NFL coaches. First Quarter With the offense off to a stumbling start, there wasn't much to highlight in the opening quarter. However, a pair of Cowboys rookies sparked the Dallas defense. With the Panthers driving, reaching the Cowboy' 18-yard line, Young spun around Parsons and stumbled forward. But on his way down, linebacker Marist Liufau punched the ball out with defensive end Marshawn Kneeland falling on the fumble, ending the threat. Second Quarter The second frame, though, got off to a different start for the Cowboys offense, thanks in large part to Lamb, who caught three passes for 62 yards in a 10-play, 77-yard drive. All three receptions came on third down, the last being a 14-yard catch corralled in the end zone to give the visitors a 7-0 lead. With that, Lamb also surpassed 1,000 receiving yards for the fourth straight season. Linebacker Eric Kendricks then reached a milestone of sorts himself. When cornerback Jourdan Lewis broke up a pass on Carolina's ensuing position, the ball deflected right into the waiting hands of Kendricks. That marked his third takeaway of the season (two interceptions, one fumble recovery), equaling his career high. Starting at the Panthers' 48-yard line after the gift, Dallas managed to reach the 39, but there the drive stalled. Out came Brandon Aubrey, who continued his stellar 2024 campaign with a 52-yard field goal right down the middle for another three points. And then within just back-to-back plays, a pair of self-inflicted mistakes by the Cowboys gave the Panthers all the momentum going into the half. Dallas was on the doorstep of adding points when they reached the Carolina 14-yard line with 45 seconds left. But that's when Rush fumbled trying to pull the ball away from Rico Dowdle on an RPO play, which was recovered by the Panthers. Even worse, on Carolina's first snap, a breakdown in coverage left receiver Jalen Coker streaking down the right sideline all alone. The result was an 83-yard touchdown and the Cowboys' advantage narrowed to 10-7 at the break. Aubrey had a chance to set an NFL record when Dallas set him up for a 70-yard field goal on the final play of the quarter, but his kick was both wide left and short. Third Quarter Whatever momentum that may have been lost was quickly recovered by the Cowboys as the second half got underway. On the Panthers' first snap of the quarter, defensive tackle Osa Odighizuwa roared up the middle untouched and sacked Young, who also lost the ball. When defensive end Chauncey Golston recovered the fumble, Dallas was set up at the Carolina 29-yard line. Five plays later, the Cowboys were across the goal line, Rush finding Jalen Tolbert streaking across the back of the end zone for the 11-yard touchdown. The game was then essentially cemented when Dallas came right back and scored on its next possession as well to up their lead to 24-7 after three quarters. The six-play, 78-yard drive was wrapped up by Rush with an 18-yard pass to Brandin Cooks, an 11-yarder to Lamb and then finally a 17-yarder to Jalen Brooks, who made a nice catch in the end zone for his first career touchdown. Fourth Quarter On the move again as the clocked ticked over into the final frame, Rush engineered a 10-play, 46-yard drive that pushed into enemy territory. And although the drive stalled at the Carolina 27-yard line, Aubrey to split the uprights on a 45-yard field goal. With that, there was nothing left to do but play out the clock. The Panthers did score with just over nine minutes left. Helped by a couple of pass interference penalties on the Cowboys, Carolina got its second touchdown when Young scrambled six yards around the right end to the goal line, completing a 12-play, 70-yard drive. Not to worry, Aubrey tacked on another three points for Dallas with a 41-yard field goal. This came after KaVontae Turpin provided a 24-yard kickoff return with the Panthers throwing in 15 more yards with an unnecessary roughness penalty. Set up at the Carolina 46, the Cowboys pushed up to the 23 before turning to their kicker. Israel Mukuamu provided the team's fourth turnover with an interception of Young that he returned to the Dallas 25-yard line. But at this point, the Cowboys were content to keep the ball on the ground, run out the clock and secure the 30-14 win. Desperately fighting to keep their playoff hopes alive, the Cowboys fall late to the Bengals, 27-20, while suffering injuries to even more key players. The Cowboys send the fans home happy with a 27-20 Thanksgiving Day win over the rival New York Giants. The game was ugly at times, but in the end it was simply beautiful as the Cowboys earned a 34-26 victory over the Commanders. Not only did the Cowboys lose to their state rivals in Houston, 34-10, but their already depleted roster suffered even more injuries to key players. With quarterback Dak Prescott now sidelined, the Cowboys were unable to get much going on offense in a blowout 34-6 loss to the rival Eagles. The Cowboys fall 27-21 to the Falcons but also suffer key injuries to Dak Prescott and potentially CeeDee Lamb. Despite a halftime lead and a valiant fourth-quarter rally, the Cowboys can't overcome the 49ers' 21 unanswered points in the third quarter, losing 30-24. The undermanned Cowboys were no match in their showdown against Detroit, losing to the Lions in a blowout, 47-9 Despite injuries and turnovers early on, the Cowboys orchestrate a late-game comeback for a 20-17 victory over the Steelers. The game wasn't always pretty, but the Cowboys outlasted the Giants to capture a 20-15 victory over their NFC rivals. Despite a furious fourth quarter rally, the Cowboys' comeback falls short as they lose to the Ravens, 28-25. ©2024 Dallas Cowboys. All rights reserved.

                "content": "If not listed, please contact your TV provider. CHARLOTTE, N.C. (AP) CeeDee Lamb heard about oddsmakers listing the Carolina Panthers as a favorite for the first time in nearly two full years entering Sunday's game against the Dallas Cowboys. But Lamb and the Cowboys wound up getting the last laugh. “It was brought up,” Lamb said with a wide smile. “You're not oblivious to what is being said about your team. ... Shoutout to whoever thought the Panthers were going to win, but they got this one wrong.” Did they ever. Cooper Rush threw for 214 yards and a career-high three touchdown passes, Dallas forced four Bryce Young turnovers and sacked the second-year quarterback six times as the Cowboys drubbed the Panthers 30-14 for their third win in the past four games. Lamb battled through shoulder soreness and had nine catches for 116 yards, including a 14-yard touchdown reception and Rico Dowdle ran for a career high 149 yards on 25 carries to become the first undrafted running back to surpass 100 yards rushing in three straight games since Houston’s Arian Foster. The Cowboys outgained the Panthers 410-235. Young, who had shown improvement in recent weeks, finished 19 of 28 for 219 yards with a career-long 83-yard touchdown toss to rookie Jalen Coker and also ran for a score. But the second-year quarterback fumbled twice and threw two interceptions to fall to 4-21 as an NFL starter. The Cowboys, despite losing cornerback Trevon Diggs to a season-ending knee injury this past week and coming off a heartbreaking loss on Monday night to the Cincinnati Bengals, played inspired on defense, holding the Panthers to 1 yard in the third quarter. “It says that we are not going to give up,\" said edge rusher Micah Parsons, who had two sacks. “As long as I'm a part of this unit and we believe in each other. We are fighting for each other at this point. The record is the record, but it's a special feeling when you can fight for each other.” Parsons said the game plan coming in was to shut down Chuba Hubbard, and the Cowboys did just that - holding Carolina's 1,000-yard rusher to 32 yards on 10 carries. The six sacks were the most allowed by the Panthers this season. “When they put us in this mode where we have to play behind, where we have to throw the ball and flip the field to score some points, we were playing into their hands,” Panthers coach Dave Canales said. \"Certainly put us in a brand of football that we don’t really want to play.” Dallas' offense continues to show signs of improvement under Rush, who was forced into action when Dak Prescott went down with a season-ending hamstring injury. After punting on their first two possessions, the Cowboys went on to score on six of their next eight possessions with the only exceptions being Rush's turnover deep in Carolina territory and a missed 70-yard field-goal attempt by Brandon Aubrey at the end of the first half. Lamb had eight receptions for 104 yards in the first half as Dallas took a 10-0 lead. The Cowboys appeared ready to add to the lead late in the second quarter, but Rush mishandled a snap and fumbled at the Carolina 17. On the next play from scrimmage, Young found Coker along the right sideline for an 83-yard touchdown pass, the longest of his career to pull the Panthers (3-11) within three with 31 seconds left. But that was as close as the Panthers would get. The third quarter was all Dallas, with Osa Odighizuwa stripping Young of the football on Carolina's first possession of the second half and the Cowboys cashing in on an 11-yard touchdown pass from Rush to Jalen Tolbert, who got free across the back of the end zone for a 17-7 lead. Rush later added a 17-yard TD pass to Jalen Brooks, the first of his career. “Cooper, I thought his touchdown throws were huge,\" coach Mike McCarthy said. “He extended the one play and hit JT in the corner of the end zone and that was a huge, huge play.” Canales said Young will remain Carolina's starting quarterback next week, saying he didn't see his young QB's confidence waiver. “He had a good look in his eyes,\" Canales said. \"I was looking forward to continue being aggressive and find those opportunities down the field.” Cowboys: OT Chuma Edoga injured his ankle in the second quarter and guard T.J. Bass left in the fourth quarter with a lower leg injury. Panthers: WR Xavier Legette left the game in the third quarter with a groin injury. Cowboys: Host Tampa Bay next Sunday. Panthers: Host Arizona next Sunday in their final home game of the season. --- AP NFL: https://apnews.com/hub/NFL Copyright 2024 STATS LLC and Associated Press.

                "content": "Well, maybe the Carolina Panthers are better off as underdogs after all. Here's everything we know from the disappointing Week 15 loss to the Dallas Cowboys: Panthers quarterback Bryce Young could not protect the rock. In his first real hiccup since returning to the starting lineup in Week 8, he committed four turnovers—with two interceptions and two fumbles—while eating six sacks. In addition to struggling in pass protection, the Carolina offensive line also failed to get the run game going. Chuba Hubbard rushed for just 32 yards on 10 carries. Cowboys quarterback Cooper Rush, meanwhile, had one of his best outings of the campaign. He completed 18 of his 29 throws for 214 yards while connecting on touchdown passes with three different receivers. Down 30-14 with just six minutes remaining in the game, the Panthers had a glimmer of hope beginning on their 30-yard line. But six (official) plays later, Young was picked by safety Israel Mukuamu on an attempted pass to wideout Adam Thielen.

                "content": "DallasCowboys.com Staff Writer CHARLOTTE, N.C. — A tenet of leadership is in being able to gut through adversity and to show those around you what it looks like to never say die. That's precisely what CeeDee Lamb has been doing over the course of the 2024 season, as he and the Dallas Cowboys attempt, on a weekly basis, to overcome a season drowned by Murphy's Law. \"You always have to start somewhere,\" said Lamb of the Cowboys' 30-14 victory at Bank of America Stadium, the team's third-highest point output this season. \"Last week was a good stepping stoop for us to come out here and get into the end zone multiple times was a good feeling.\" Despite nursing a shoulder injury that is now weeks old and still an issue, the All-Pro wide receiver has been a driving force for an offense now led by backup quarterback Cooper Rush. On Sunday, in the Cowboys' clash with the Carolina Panthers, Lamb surpassed 1,000 yards receiving for the fourth consecutive season and, in doing so, he made history by becoming the first player in the existence of the Cowboys to achieve the feat in four of his first five seasons in Dallas. \"It means a lot and that all of my hard work is paying off,\" said Lamb. \"I'm mad consistent with my work and my approach towards every year, and it's good to see that it shows up. I'm grateful for it and grateful for the opportunity to be in this organization — doing what I'm doing — and I'm looking forward to many more of those [records].\" And as far as his injured shoulder goes, Lamb took some big hits against the Panthers, including one from former Cowboys' teammate Xavier Woods, but he noted he's fine and will continue to power through it. Oh, and that defenses are going to have to hit him harder if they want to try and force him into to tapping out. \"You gotta come a little harder than that,\" he said. \"Xavier Woods, yeah, I've played on his team a couple of years so I know what he's capable of, and to get hit by him, but he's gonna have to bring a little bit more.\" Furthermore, Lamb passed Jarvis Landry on the NFL's all-time list of receptions through the first five seasons of a career — his 482nd pushing past that of Landry's (481) — helping the Cowboys to power past the Panthers and push to a 5-2 road record this season. With the loss of All-Pro quarterback Dak Prescott to a season-ending hamstring injury, and several other locker room leaders going down with their own ailments, the leadership of Lamb has been much-needed, and while he may not be the most vocal in the huddle, his play on the field — including his willingness to fight through an injury that is clearly painful — goes to the grit of what has become a cornerstone player for the Cowboys. \"I've always had that [leadership mentality],\" said Lamb. \"Offensively, the guys are looking to me as a spark. With that, I'm gonna continue to do that. I look at myself as a spark as well. Personally, I feel like I can score from anywhere on the field. I wanna be a threat every time I touch [the ball].\" A slow start to the season for Lamb has evolved into a maturation for the three-time Pro Bowler and reigning NFL receptions leader. An already intensely bright future for Lamb is only getting brighter. The Cowboys were technically the underdogs going into Sunday's game with the Carolina, but they were always the better team and proved it from start to finish. Cooper Rush has led Dallas to a 3-1 record over the last four games, and a career-high three touchdown outing against the Carolina Panthers gives Dallas some positive momentum heading into Sunday Night Football next week. After Dallas' season started with struggles finding their identity in the run game on offense and defense, both sides exhibited it as a strength in a 30-14 win over the Carolina Panthers. In the absence of DeMarvion Overshown, Micah Parsons and Osa Odighizuwa set a tone that helped the Cowboys bludgeon Bryce Young and the Panthers. Plays that might be forgotten include the first play of the third quarter when Osa Odighizuwa changed the game with a turnover. The Dallas defense largely dominated the Panthers as the Cowboys come away with a 30-14 victory over Carolina. It's been determined that Trevon Diggs will require season-ending surgery, and his prognosis will bleed into 2025 training camp. After returning to the Cowboys lineup for the first time in two games against the Cincinnati Bengals, cornerback Trevon Diggs is expected undergo season-ending knee surgery. As @spags52 writes in his Friday column, just because the Cowboys' playoff chances look bleak, don't think for a minute that these guys don't have something to play for. As the Cowboys hit the road to play the Panthers, \"Here We Goooo\" examines how Dallas can return home with a much-needed victory thanks to good secondary play, success in the run game, and Cooper Rush playing efficient football. Let's find out what the staff writers have to say about the Cowobys' chances of winning up in Carolina this Sunday at Bank of America Stadium. ©2024 Dallas Cowboys. All rights reserved.

                "title": "Army–Navy Game - Wikipedia",
                "content": "The Army–Navy Game is an American college football rivalry game between the Army Black Knights of the United States Military Academy (USMA) at West Point, New York, and the Navy Midshipmen of the United States Naval Academy (USNA) at Annapolis, Maryland. The Black Knights, or Cadets, and Midshipmen each represent their service's oldest officer commissioning sources. As such, the game has come to embody the spirit of the interservice rivalry of the United States Armed Forces. The game marks the end of the college football regular season and the third and final game of the season's Commander-in-Chief's Trophy series, which also includes the Air Force Falcons of the United States Air Force Academy (USAFA) near Colorado Springs, Colorado. The Army–Navy Game is one of the most traditional and enduring rivalries in college football. It has been frequently attended by the President of the United States.[1] The game has been nationally televised each year since 1945 on either ABC, CBS, or NBC. CBS has televised the game since 1996 and has the rights to the broadcast through 2038. The December 2024 announcement of CBS Sports' extension will also give their international channels rights in the United Kingdom and Australia.[2] Instant replay made its American debut in the 1963 Army–Navy game.[3] Since 2009, the game has been held on the second Saturday of December and following FBS conference championship weekend.[4] The game has been primarily played in Philadelphia, but the game has also been held in multiple locations including the New York area, the Baltimore–Washington area, Chicago, Pasadena, California and the Boston area. The series has been uninterrupted since 1930. Through the 2024 meeting, Navy leads the series 63–55–7. The first game between Army and Navy was on November 29, 1890. Since then, the two academies have played annually in all but ten years, and have played in consecutive annual games every season since 1930. Throughout its history, the game has been played in several neutral locations, including New York City and Baltimore, but it is most commonly played in Philadelphia, which is roughly equidistant from the two academies. Historically played on the Saturday after Thanksgiving (a date on which most other major college football teams end their regular seasons), the game is now played on the second Saturday in December and is traditionally the last regular-season game played in NCAA Division I football. For much of the first two thirds of the 20th century, both Army and Navy were often national powers, and the game occasionally had national championship implications. However, as the level of play in college football increased, both academies' stringent admissions standards and height and weight limits made it difficult for them to compete. Since 1963, only the 1996, 2010, 2016, 2017, and 2024 games have seen both teams enter with winning records. Nonetheless, the game is considered a college football institution. The tradition associated with the game has kept it airing nationally on radio since 1930 and on television since 1945. It has remained an over-the-air broadcast even in the age of cable, satellite, and streaming. The game is especially emotional for the seniors, called \"first classmen\" by both academies, since it is typically the last competitive regular season football game they will ever play (though they sometimes play in a subsequent bowl game). However, some participants in the Army–Navy Game have gone on to professional football careers. For example, quarterback Roger Staubach (Navy, 1965) went on to a Hall of Fame career with the National Football League's Dallas Cowboys that included starting at quarterback in two Super Bowl victories (including being named the Most Valuable Player of Super Bowl VI), and Alejandro Villanueva (Army, 2010) was later an offensive tackle with the NFL's Pittsburgh Steelers and Baltimore Ravens.[5] The game is the last of three contests in the annual Commander-in-Chief's Trophy series, awarded to each season's winner of the triangular series among Army, Navy, and Air Force since 1972. The rivalries Army and Navy have with Air Force are much less intense than the Army–Navy rivalry, primarily due to the relative youth of the USAFA, established in 1954, and the physical distance between the USAFA and the other two schools. The Army–Air Force and Navy–Air Force games are usually played at the academies' regular home fields, although on occasion they have been held at a neutral field. Since 1901, there have been ten sitting presidents of the United States to attend the Army–Navy Game. The first was Theodore Roosevelt, who attended the game in 1901 and 1905. Harry S. Truman attended all but one edition during his eight years in office (1945–1952), missing the 1951 game due to vacation. George W. Bush and Donald Trump each attended three times; Bush in 2001, 2004, and 2008, and Trump in 2018, 2019, and 2020. Trump also attended two games as president-elect in 2016 and 2024.[6][7] John F. Kennedy attended both games played during his presidency in 1961 and 1962; he was assassinated fifteen days before the 1963 game. Presidents who each attended once include Woodrow Wilson (1913), Calvin Coolidge (1924), Gerald Ford (1974), Bill Clinton (1996), and Barack Obama (2011).[8][7] On October 25, 2023, it was announced that Army would join Navy in the American Athletic Conference (AAC) in football effective in the 2024 season. As part of the arrangement, the Army–Navy Game will remain an out-of-conference date for both schools, and still be played on an annual basis. In the event that the teams possess the two highest win-loss records within the AAC, it is conceivable that they would contend in an AAC Championship game, potentially leading to the occurrence of consecutive Army–Navy Games.[9] The rivalry between Annapolis and West Point, while friendly, is intense. The phrases \"Beat Navy!\" and \"Beat Army!\" are ingrained in the respective institutions and have become a symbol of competitiveness, not just in the Army–Navy Game, but in the service of the country. The phrases are often used at the close of (informal) letters by graduates of both academies. A long-standing tradition at the Army–Navy football game is to conduct a formal \"prisoner exchange\" as part of the pre-game activities. The prisoners are the cadets and midshipmen currently spending the semester studying at the sister academy. After the exchange, students have a brief reprieve to enjoy the game with their comrades.[10] During the pre-game ceremony, the invocation is followed by the American national anthem sung by members of the USMA and USNA choirs.[11] At the end of the game, both teams' almae matres are performed. The winning team stands alongside the losing team and faces the losing academy's students; then the losing team accompanies the winning team, facing their students.[12] This is done in a show of mutual respect and solidarity. Since the winning team's alma mater is always played last, the phrase \"sing second\" has become synonymous with winning the rivalry game. Navy Midshipman (and later Admiral) Joseph Mason Reeves wore what is widely regarded as the first football helmet in the 1893 Army–Navy Game. He had been advised by a Navy doctor that another kick to his head would result in intellectual disability or even death, so he commissioned an Annapolis shoemaker to make him a helmet out of leather.[13] On November 27, 1926, the Army–Navy Game was held in Chicago for the National Dedication of Soldier Field as a monument to American servicemen who had fought in World War I. Navy came to the game undefeated, while Army had only lost to Notre Dame. Played before a crowd of over 100,000, the teams fought to a 21–21 tie, resulting in Navy being awarded a share of the national championship.[14][15] In both the 1944 and 1945 contests, Army and Navy entered the game ranked #1 and #2 respectively.[16] The 1945 game was labeled the \"game of the century\" before it was played. Army (9–0) defeated Navy (7-0-1) with a score of 32–13. Navy's tie was against Notre Dame.[17] In 1963, shortly after the assassination of President John F. Kennedy, Jacqueline Kennedy urged the academies to play after there had been talk of cancellation. Originally scheduled for November 30, 1963, the game was played on December 7, 1963, also coinciding with the 22nd anniversary of Pearl Harbor Day.[18] In front of a crowd of 102,000 people in Philadelphia's Municipal Stadium, later renamed John F. Kennedy Stadium, junior (second class midshipman) quarterback Roger Staubach led number two ranked Navy to victory which clinched a Cotton Bowl national championship matchup with Texas. Army was led by junior (second class cadet) quarterback Rollie Stichweh. Stichweh led off the game with a touchdown drive that featured the first use of instant replay.[19] Army nearly won the game after another touchdown and two point conversion, Stichweh recovered the onside kick and drove the ball to the Navy 2 yard line. On 4th down and no timeouts, crowd noise prevented Stichweh from calling a play and time expired with the 21–15 final score. Staubach won the Heisman Trophy that year and was bumped off the scheduled cover of Life magazine due to the coverage of the assassination. Stichweh and Staubach would meet again in 1964 as seniors where Stichweh's Army would defeat Staubach's Navy. In that game, Calvin Huey of Navy became the first African-American to play in the series.[20] Staubach went on to serve in the Navy and afterward became a Pro Football Hall of Fame quarterback with the Dallas Cowboys. Stichweh served five years in Vietnam with the 173rd Airborne Brigade. Stichweh was inducted into the Army Sports Hall of Fame in 2012.[21][22] On December 10, 2016, Army defeated Navy for the first time since 2001 with a 21–17 victory, snapping its 14-game losing streak against Navy. In 2022, Army defeated Navy by a score of 20–17 in double overtime in the first overtime game in the series' history. Only seven games have ever been held on the campus of either academy, primarily because neither team has ever played at an on-campus stadium large enough to accommodate the large crowds that attend. The rivalry's first four games were hosted on the parade grounds of the respective academies. For all but three years since 1899, it has been held at a neutral site. Two were held on campus due to World War II travel restrictions (1942 at Navy's old Thompson Stadium and 1943 at Michie Stadium); and the 2020 game was held at Michie Stadium due to COVID-19 restrictions in Philadelphia. Philadelphia has been the traditional home of the Army–Navy game, due to the historic nature of the city and its location approximately halfway between West Point and Annapolis. Through the 2023 meeting, 90 of the 124 games in the series have been contested in Philadelphia, including every game from 1932 to 1982 except three games that were relocated due to World War II travel restrictions. For decades, the Pennsylvania Railroad and its successors offered game-day service to all Army–Navy games in Philadelphia using a sprawling temporary station constructed each year near Municipal Stadium on the railroad's Greenwich freight yard. The service, with more than 40 trains serving as many as 30,000 attendees, was the single largest concentrated passenger rail movement in the country.[23][24] All games contested in Philadelphia through 1935 were played at what is now Franklin Field, the home field of the University of Pennsylvania. From 1936 through 1979, all games contested in Philadelphia were held at Municipal Stadium, renamed John F. Kennedy Stadium in 1964. From 1980 to 2001, all games contested in Philadelphia took place at Veterans Stadium. Since 2003, all games contested in Philadelphia have been played at Lincoln Financial Field. Outside of Philadelphia, the New York area has been the most frequent Army–Navy site. The Polo Grounds holds the record for most games hosted outside of Philadelphia with nine. It was the location of all New York City games through 1927. Yankee Stadium was the site of the game in 1930 and 1931. Six games have been hosted in New Jersey: 1905 at Osborne Field at Princeton University, four games at Giants Stadium from 1989 to 2002, and 2021 at MetLife Stadium. A number of games throughout the history of the series have also been hosted in Maryland. In Baltimore, Municipal Stadium was the location of the 1924 and 1944 games. Four games were played at M&T Bank Stadium in Baltimore since 2000. In 2011, the game was played at FedExField in Landover, Maryland. The 2023 game was held at Gillette Stadium in Foxborough, Massachusetts. The Rose Bowl is the only site west of the Mississippi River where an Army–Navy game has been played, in 1983. Pasadena, California, home to the Rose Bowl, paid for the travel expenses of all the students and supporters of both academies, including 9,437 in all. The game was held at the Rose Bowl that year because there are a large number of military installations and servicemen and women, along with many retired military personnel, on the West Coast.[25] The game has been held one other time in a non-East Coast venue, at Chicago's Soldier Field, which hosted the 1926 game.

More about OED's frequency bands * Occurrences per million words in written English Historical frequency series are derived from Google Books Ngrams (version 2), a data set based on the Google Books corpus of several million books printed in English between 1500 and 2010. The overall frequency for a given word is calculated by summing frequencies for the main form of the word, any plural or inflected forms, and any major spelling variations. For sets of homographs (distinct entries that share the same word-form, e.g. mole, n.¹, mole, n.², mole, n.³, etc.), we have estimated the frequency of each homograph entry as a fraction of the total Ngrams frequency for the word-form. This may result in inaccuracies. Smoothing has been applied to series for lower-frequency words, using a moving-average algorithm. This reduces short-term fluctuations, which may be produced by variability in the content of the Google Books corpus. * Occurrences per million words in written English Modern frequency series are derived from a corpus of 20 billion words, covering the period from 2017 to the present. The corpus is mainly compiled from online news sources, and covers all major varieties of World English. bronco, n. & adj. was first published in 1888; not yet revised. bronco, n. & adj. was last modified in December 2024.

Miami Dolphins wide receiver Grant DuBose has been ruled out with a head injury after being stretchered off during Sunday's Week 15 matchup with the Houston Texans. The team says that DuBose is in stable condition and is being taken to a local hospital for further evaluation. The injury came after the second-year pro took a hard hit on a tackle with under 10 minutes to play in the third quarter when Tua Tagovailoa targeted him on a second-and-9 play over the middle of the field. Just as the pass reached DuBose, he was popped by Texans safety Calen Bullock Jr., and the ball fell incomplete as he laid on the ground. The medical staff was quick to tend to DuBose, unscrewing his facemask while also taking off his jersey and pads to better tend to him. Grant DuBose takes a scary hit. Hope he’s ok pic.twitter.com/OstNvUeMbf The game was stopped for a total of 12 minutes as they worked on DuBose and eventually got him on a backboard and stretchered him off of the field. The CBS broadcast also noted the training staff had DeBose hooked up to an IV on the field. The 23-year-old is playing in his second season in the NFL. The pass catcher came into the league as a seventh-round draft choice of the Green Bay Packers in 2023 out of Charlotte. He was waived by Green Bay at the end of training camp and was claimed by Miami. Coming into Week 15, DuBose has appeared in three games, catching one pass for 13 yards. © 2004-2024 CBS Interactive.

DuBose, 23, was left motionless after a hit in the head by the Texans’ Calen Bullock during the third quarter of Sunday’s game. The jersey of DuBose was cut off and his facemask was unscrewed by medical staff before being placed on a stretcher and hurried into a waiting emergency vehicle. According to the Dolphins, DuBose was in stable condition while leaving the stadium and would be further evaluated at the hospital. Per the CBS broadcast, DuBose was being taken to Houston’s Memorial Hermann Health System, roughly a 20 mile drive from NRG Stadium. As DuBose was being attended to on the field, the entire Dolphins roster dropped to one knee in a prayer circle. The injury was cause for incredible concern on social media. “Prayers up for Miami Dolphins WR Grant Dubose,” former NFL quarterback Robert Griffin III posted via X. “Scary scene with him being down on the field.” Fox 26 Houston reporter Will Kunkel wrote via X, “Terrifying moment as Grant DuBose is taken off the field on a stretcher. His jersey was cut off and face mask was unscrewed while lying on the field. Pray for Grant and his family.” “This is the longest I’ve ever seen a game delayed because of an injury,” KPRC 2 Houston reporter Chancellor Johnson posted via X. “The entire Dolphins team was circled in prayer. An emotional scene at NRG as Grant DuBose was carted off the field.” DuBose was playing in just the third game of his NFL career. The wide receiver, who played football at the University of North Carolina at Charlotte, made his professional debut on September 8 after the Dolphins claimed him off waivers in August. The injury to DuBose came on a pass from Dolphins quarterback Tua Tagovailoa, who has an extensive history with head injuries himself. You have successfully subscribed.

                "content": "If not listed, please contact your TV provider. PHILADELPHIA (AP) Jalen Hurts absorbed the shots when the Eagles' recent anemic passing attack was panned by his own star wide receivers. Hurts and A.J. Brown - one of those receivers who brought the complaints to a boil - then had their relationship dissected and thrown under the bus by a teammate, the type of locker room criticism that can unravel a franchise. Or maybe, the touchy internal evaluation was exactly the kind of incentive Philadelphia needed to flex its superiority in a cross-state showdown with a playoff-bound opponent. “Every opportunity to get better, you use,” coach Nick Sirianni said. “I’m not for one minute saying that all the turmoil on the outside was a good thing. We want to make sure that we’re locked into what we’re doing, and that’s what I felt like.” Hurts threw touchdown passes to Brown and DeVonta Smith to mute scrutiny of the Eagles' offense, and Philadelphia won its franchise-record 10th straight game, 27-13 over the Pittsburgh Steelers on Sunday. “So that’s what you all wanted to see?” said Hurts, who confirmed he was playing with a broken finger on his non-throwing hand. Philly's recent friction wasn't fan- or media-driven at all - like a horror movie, the sounds were coming from inside the house. Hurts and the Eagles’ offense made the big plays a week after both Smith and Brown griped about a lack of catches in a win over Carolina. Later in the week, injured defensive end Brandon Graham appeared on a Philadelphia sports radio station and suggested there were personal issues at play between Hurts and Brown. Hurts, who threw for 290 yards and after not topping 200 in any of the last three games, tried to squash any perceived in-house dissention on the opening drive. He connected with Smith twice and Brown once, leading to Jake Elliott’s 34-yard field goal. “Scrutiny is never-ending. It’s nothing new,” Hurts said. “That’s something that I find a thrill in. I appreciate being told I can’t and that we can’t. I know that I lead this team, and it takes a lot out of it. It demands a lot out of you.” Brown, who walked gingerly on the sideline late in the game, had eight catches for 110 yards, and Smith had 11 for 109 yards a week after they combined for only eight catches and 80 yards. “Behind closed doors, we talked about it,” Brown said. “We called each other out. It was very uncomfortable because we don’t want to feel like we’re getting attacked.” Hurts hit Brown late in the first quarter for a 5-yard TD - the pair celebrated with the Kid ’N Play dance - and connected with Smith on a 2-yard score in the second for a 17-3 lead. “That was our moment to tell everybody to shut up,” Brown said. Eagles running back Saquon Barkey’s chase of the NFL season rushing record was slowed when he ran for just 65 yards on 19 carries. Barkley, who still leads the NFL with 1,688 yards, took a low hit from Pittsburgh’s Minkah Fitzpatrick and missed most of the second quarter. Barkley said his right knee was fine and he wasn't injured on Fitzpatrick's hit. Hurts also had a rushing touchdown on a tush push for the Eagles (12-2), who were denied a shot a clinching the NFC East when Washington beat New Orleans earlier in the day. AFC North-leading Pittsburgh (10-4) lost for the second time in nine games but clinched a playoff spot thanks to losses by Miami and Indianapolis. Steelers coach Mike Tomlin said the playoff berth wasn't all that important under the circumstances. “Not as I stand here today. We had a game to play today. We wanted to win it and we didn’t,” he said. “Some of that other stuff is less relevant to us.” The Steelers lost star linebacker T.J Watt to an ankle injury after he chased down Hurts in the fourth quarter. Watt, who leads the Steelers with 11 1/2 sacks, said he was in “wait-and-see” mode for next week's division showdown at Baltimore. The 30-year-old former defensive player of the year came away with a rolled ankle that he didn’t necessarily believe was a serious injury. Pittsburgh's Russell Wilson was stymied by the Eagles' defense and threw for a season-low 128 yards. He threw a 9-yard TD pass to Pat Freiermuth while falling to 6-1 lifetime against the Eagles. It was clear the Steelers missed wide receiver George Pickens, who leads the team in receptions (55) and yards receiving (850) by a wide margin. He missed a second straight game with a hamstring injury. The Steelers haven’t won at Philadelphia since Oct. 24, 1965. Wilson botched a pitch to Najee Harris in the third quarter and the Eagles recovered. That led to Hurts' score on a 1-yard tush push for a 27-13 lead. It was the first time the teams - among the original eight in the NFL - played each other when both had a double-digit win total. But this meeting wasn't all that competitive. Chris Boswell kicked field goals of 37 and 49 yards and became Pittsburgh's season leader in field goals with 38. Barkley needs 418 yards over the final three games to top Eric Dickerson’s 40-year-old NFL record. Dickerson rushed for 2,105 yards for the Los Angeles Rams in 1984. His rushing total was his second worst this season. Steelers: CB Donte Jackson sustained a back injury. ... Backup QB Justin Fields had an abdominal injury. Eagles: S Sydney Brown suffered a concussion on a hit during the opening kickoff. ... LG Landon Dickerson suffered a knee injury. Steelers: At Baltimore on Saturday in a key AFC North matchup.

                "title": "Steelers vs. Eagles takeaways: Jalen Hurts gets pass game back as Philly wins franchise-record 10th in row - CBSSports.com",
                "content": "If not listed, please contact your TV provider. PHILADELPHIA -- Jalen Hurts and A.J. Brown have quelled any notion of the Philadelphia Eagles' passing game being off, as the duo made a statement in the 27-13 win over the Pittsburgh Steelers on Sunday. Hurts finished 25 of 32 for 290 yards and two passing touchdowns -- one to Brown and one to DeVonta Smith -- to end the recent chatter. Hurts found Brown for a 5-yard touchdown late in the first quarter to give the Eagles an early lead they wouldn't relinquish. The Eagles quarterback later found Smith for a 2-yard touchdown in the second quarter to put the Eagles up two scores in the first half. Brown finished with eight catches for 110 yards and a touchdown while Smith had 11 catches for 109 yards and a touchdown. In addition to the two passing touchdowns, Hurts also added a rushing touchdown in the game -- finishing with over 300 yards of offense and three touchdowns. This comes after two games which Hurts failed to record 125 yards passing in each contest. The Eagles finished over 400 yards of offense and the No. 1 defense held the Steelers to 163 total yards in the win. Philadelphia has won 10 straight games for the first time in franchise history and are now tied with the Detroit Lions for the top seed in the NFC (Lions hold the tiebreaker based on conference record). Pittsburgh had 56 yards rushing in the game and scored on just two of nine possessions. Russell Wilson finished with under 200 yards passing and threw just one touchdown -- a 9-yard pass to Pat Freiermuth in the second quarter. A recap of this game and takeaways can be found below! The Eagles' passing game was on point early and often in this one, thanks to Brown making the call last week on that aspect the offense needed to improve upon. Hurts went to Brown and Smith early and often, as he started the day 12 of 13 for 146 yards and two touchdown passes for a 153.0 passer rating. Brown had Smith were targeted 10 times to start the game, having nine catches for 98 yards and two scores. The Eagles' passing game set the tone early and barely relented, as Hurts finished with over 300 yards of total offense and three scores. The Steelers weren't able to get their passing game going with out George Pickens in the lineup, their most creative play being a flea flicker to Calvin Austin for 31 yards in the third quarter when they were trailing 20-13. At the time, that play was 28% of the Steelers offense. Pittsburgh also had little answer for Hurts and the Eagles' passing game, as the Hurts and Brown connection was rolling all day. Even on a day where Saquon Barkley was neutralized, Hurts and Brown were able to exploit the defense. Sunday was a tough ask for the Steelers. The Steelers were slowly crawling their way back into the game and found their way to the Eagles' 26-yard line with 5:56 left in the third quarter. Najee Harris bobbled the pitch attempt from Wilson and Darius Slay was able to recover the ball and give the Eagles possession. Pittsburgh was trailing 20-13 at that point, so the Steelers were in striking distance of tying the game (at worst a field goal to cut the deficit to four). The fumble was credited to Wilson, and the Eagles were able to capitalize with a 13-play, 74-yard drive to take a 27-13 lead and take command of the game. There were a few candidates in this game, but Kenneth Gainwell set the tone for how his game was going to go after a spin move on Steelers cornerback Donte Jackson on a third-and-5 in the first quarter. Gainwell caught the ball from Hurts in the backfield at the 20-yard line and spun by Warren at the 23 (line of scrimmage was the 26) -- getting the first down and eventually brought down at the 39-yard line. The gain of 13 yards set up the Eagles' first touchdown, which gave Philadelphia the lead for good. Gainwell had 50 yards of total offense on a day Barkley didn't have his best game. The Eagles (12-2) will travel to Washington to play the Commanders -- with a chance to clinch the NFC East title -- next Sunday. The Steelers (10-4) will travel to Baltimore to face the Ravens (9-5) on Saturday in a pivotal AFC North matchup Jalen Hurts is up to 315 total yards after getting a tush push for a first down. Eagles up 27-13 with 3:15 left and ball. A.J. Brown and DeVonta Smith 16 catches for 166 yards and 2 TD today.

He also has a perfect passer rating targeting Brown. Eagles 10, Steelers 3 1:13 1Q The Steelers were held to a FG, but this was the cause of why they weren't able to get a TD after the DeJean muffed punt. Personal fouls were assessed Calvin Austin III and Darnell Washington. 15-yard penalty to both players, pinned the Steelers back. Drive went 4 plays to -8 yards, but Steelers get a FG.

Vic Fangio can't be pleased with Cooper DeJean getting hit like that on a punt return. Good PBU by Nolan Smith on 3rd down. The Steelers have gone 3-and-out on consecutive series to start the game. Eagles defense living up to its billing. Sydney Brown is being evaluated for a concussion, per the Eagles. Jalen Hurts went 4-of-4 for 53 yards on the first drive. Stalls in the red zone.

MORE: Updates on why Saquon Barkley briefly left Steelers vs. Eagles in Week 15 Kansas City still has a clear path to the AFC's top seed, coming off a win over the Browns in Week 15 that improved its record to 13-1. The Bills and Steelers are still within reach of that top seed, but both would need the Chiefs to lose a few games down the stretch. With its loss, Pittsburgh's main concern is now likely its ability to hold onto its AFC North lead. The Steelers did claim a playoff spot even with their loss, but whether that spot ends up being from a top-four seed or a wild-card spot is still up in the air. NFL HQ: Live NFL scores | Updated NFL standings | Full NFL schedule After losing to the Eagles this week, the Steelers lead Baltimore in the AFC North by just one game. There are three games left for each team, so the Ravens could still make a comeback to win the division before the regular season concludes. Already having double-digits in the win column, Pittsburgh has officially claimed an AFC playoff spot, meaning that even if it fails to win its division, the squad will then find itself in a wild-card position. Seeding is now the main question for the Steelers. They do face a difficult end-of-season schedule, and a Week 16 matchup against the Ravens has massive implications. That's a game that could dictate how Pittsburgh makes the AFC playoffs, either as a division winner or as a wild-card team. With Baltimore, Kansas City, and Cincinnati being the Steelers' final three opponents, they don't have an easy path to end the season. The Eagles' win over the Steelers, especially when combined with the Lions' loss to the Bills, had significant implications at the top of the NFC. Philadelphia is still behind Detroit in the standings for now due to tiebreakers, but the squads are tied in record, and the final three weeks of the season will be huge in deciding which team will claim the No. 1 seed. Minnesota owns the top wild-card spot, but it's also now within serious striking distance to steal the NFC North division, and perhaps the No. 1 seed, from Detroit. The Rams and Buccaneers are the other division leaders in the NFC, but neither is within reach of the No. 1 seed. All three of the wild-card leaders are in a strong playoff spot entering Week 16, as well. Philadelphia has already been cruising to an NFC East title, with Washington now three games behind the Eagles with three games remaining. The significance of the Eagles' Week 15 win, though, is that the team now has a legitimate shot at the conference's top seed. Having already clinched a playoff spot, Philadelphia will be a wild-card team, at worst. But now being tied in record with Detroit, the Eagles could earn themselves a first-round bye in the playoffs with a good end-of-season run and potential losses from the Lions and Vikings. The Lions still face the 49ers and Vikings this season, so the Eagles' chances at the No. 1 seed are alive and well. Here's a look at the two Pennsylvania squads' remaining schedules: Pittsburgh has somewhat of a gauntlet to go through to end the season, with significant playoff implications still on the line. Philadelphia, meanwhile, faces each of its division rivals down the stretch, with particularly favorable matchups against Dallas and New York.

                "title": "Commander - Wikipedia",
                "content": "Commander (commonly abbreviated as Cmdr.) is a common naval officer rank as well as a job title in many armies. Commander is also used as a rank or title in other formal organizations, including several police forces. In several countries, this naval rank is termed as a frigate captain. Commander is also a generic term for an officer commanding any armed forces unit, for example \"platoon commander\", \"brigade commander\" and \"squadron commander\". In the police, terms such as \"borough commander\" and \"incident commander\" are used. Commander is a rank used in navies, but is very rarely used as a rank in armies. In most armies, the term \"commander\" is used as a job title. For example, in the US Army, an officer with the rank of captain (NATO rank code OF-2) may hold the title of \"company commander\", whereas an officer with the rank of lieutenant colonel (NATO rank code OF-4) typically holds the title of \"battalion commander\". The title, originally \"master and commander\", originated in the 18th century to describe naval officers who commanded ships of war too large to be commanded by a lieutenant but too small to warrant the assignment of a post-captain and (before about 1770) a sailing master; the commanding officer served as his own master. In practice, these were usually unrated sloops-of-war of no more than 20 guns. The Royal Navy shortened \"master and commander\" to \"commander\" in 1794; however, the term \"master and commander\" remained (unofficially) in common parlance for several years.[1] The equivalent American rank master commandant remained in use until changed to commander in 1838. A corresponding rank in some navies is frigate captain. In the 20th and 21st centuries, the rank has been assigned the NATO rank code of OF-4. Various functions of commanding officers were also styled commander. In the navy of the Dutch Republic, anyone who commanded a ship or a fleet without having an appropriate rank to do so could be called a Commandeur. This included ad hoc fleet commanders and acting captains (Luitenant-Commandeur). In the fleet of the Admiralty of Zeeland however, commandeur was a formal rank, the equivalent of Schout-bij-nacht (rear-admiral) in the other Dutch admiralties. The Dutch use of the title as a rank lives on in the Royal Netherlands Navy, as the equivalent of commodore. In the Royal Netherlands Air Force, however, this rank is known by the English spelling of commodore which is the Dutch equivalent of the British air commodore. The rank of commander in the Royal Australian Navy (RAN) is identical in description to that of a commander in the British Royal Navy. RAN chaplains who are in divisions 1, 2 or 3 (of five divisions) have the equivalent rank standing of commanders. This means that to officers and NCOs below the rank of commander, lieutenant colonel, or wing commander, the chaplain is a superior. To those officers ranked higher than commander, the chaplain is subordinate. Although this equivalency exists, RAN chaplains who are in divisions 1, 2 or 3 do not actually wear the rank of commander, and they hold no command privilege. Commander is a naval rank in Scandinavia (Kommandør in Danish and Norwegian, Kommendör in Swedish) equivalent to the Anglo-American naval rank of captain. The Scandinavian rank of commander is immediately above \"commander-captain\" (Norwegian: Kommandørkaptein, Swedish: Kommendörkapten, Danish: Kommandørkaptajn), which is equivalent to the Anglo-American naval rank of commander.[2] In Denmark, the rank of commander exists as kommandørkaptajn (commander captain or commanding captain), which is senior to orlogskaptajn (captain) and kommandør (commander), which is senior to kommandørkaptajn. Kommandørkaptajn is officially translated into English as \"Commander, Senior Grade\", while orlogskaptajn is officially translated as '\"Commander.\"[3] A commander in the Royal Navy is above the rank of lieutenant commander, below the rank of captain, and is equivalent in rank to a lieutenant colonel in the army. A commander may command a frigate, destroyer, submarine, aviation squadron or shore installation, or may serve on a staff. Since the British Royal Air Force's mid-rank officers' ranks are modelled on those of the Royal Navy, the term wing commander is used as a rank, and this is the equivalent of a lieutenant colonel in the army or a commander in the navy. The rank of wing commander is above that of squadron leader and below that of group captain. In the former Royal Naval Air Service, which was merged with the Royal Flying Corps to form the Royal Air Force in 1918, the pilots held appointments as well as their normal ranks in the Royal Navy, and they wore insignia appropriate to the appointment instead of the rank. A flight commander wore a star above a lieutenant's two rank stripes, squadron commander wore two stars above two rank stripes (less than eight years' seniority) or two-and-a-half rank stripes (over eight years seniority), and wing commander wore three rank stripes. The rank stripes had the usual Royal Navy curl, and they were surmounted by an eagle. In the United States Navy, United States Coast Guard, United States Public Health Service Commissioned Corps, and National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Commissioned Officer Corps, commander (abbreviated \"CDR\") is a senior-grade officer rank, with the pay grade of O-5. Commander ranks above lieutenant commander (O-4) and below captain. (O-6). Commander is equivalent to the rank of lieutenant colonel in the United States Army, United States Air Force, United States Marine Corps, and United States Space Force. Notably, commander is the first rank at which the holder wears an embellished cap, whereas officers of the other military services are entitled to embellishment of similar headgear at O-4 rank. Promotion to commander in the U.S. Navy is governed by United States Department of Defense policies derived from the Defense Officer Personnel Management Act (DOPMA) of 1980 or its companion Reserve Officer Personnel Management Act (ROPMA). DOPMA/ROPMA guidelines suggest that 70% of lieutenant commanders should be promoted to commander after serving a minimum of three years at their present rank and after attaining 15 to 17 years of cumulative commissioned service, although this percentage may vary and be appreciably less for certain officer designators (i.e., primary \"specialties\") depending on defense budgets, force structure, and the needs of the service. For instance, as in various small colonial settlements (such as various Caribbean islands) commanding the garrison was the crux of the top job, the military title Commandeur could be used instead of a civilian gubernatorial style, not unlike the Portuguese captain-major. In the British Army, the term \"commander\" is officially applied to the non-commissioned officer in charge of a section (section commander), vehicle (vehicle commander) or gun (gun commander), to the subaltern or captain commanding a platoon (platoon commander), or to the brigadier commanding a brigade (brigade commander). Other officers commanding units are usually referred to as the officer commanding (OC), commanding officer (CO), general officer commanding (GOC), or general officer commanding-in-chief (GOC-C), depending on rank and position, although the term \"commander\" may be applied to them informally. In the First Aid Nursing Yeomanry commander is a rank equivalent to major. Commandeur as title of colonial office was the case on the island of Tobago in the Dutch colony of Nieuw Walcheren. The usage is similar/identical to the British Army, with the term \"commander\" having been applied to the colonel who was Commander, 2 Land Force Group, Linton Camp, and now to Commander, 1 Brigade. In the Spanish Army, the Spanish Air Force and the marine infantry, the term commander is the literal translation of comandante, the Spanish equivalent of a Commonwealth major. The Guardia Civil shares the army ranks, and the officer commanding a house-garrison (usually an NCO or a lieutenant, depending on the size) is addressed as the comandante de puesto (post commander). In the United States Army, the term \"commander\" is officially applied to the commanding officer of army units; hence, there are company commanders, battalion commanders, brigade commanders, and so forth. At the highest levels of U.S. military command structure, \"commander\" also refers to what used to be called commander-in-chief, or CINC, until October 24, 2002, although the term CINC is still used in casual speech. In the United States Air Force, the term \"commander\" (abbreviated \"CC\" in office symbols, i.e. \"OG/CC\" for \"operations group commander\") is applied officially to the commanding officer of an Air Force unit; hence, there are flight commanders, squadron commanders, group commanders, wing commanders, numbered air force commanders, and commanders of major commands. In rank, a flight commander is typically a lieutenant or captain, a squadron commander is typically a major or lieutenant colonel, a group commander is typically a colonel, a wing commander is typically a senior colonel or a brigadier general, a numbered air force commander is a major general or lieutenant general, and the commander of a major command is a general. In the United States Space Force, the term \"commander\" is applied officially to the commanding officer of a Space Force unit; hence, there are squadron commanders, delta commanders, and commanders of field commands. In rank, a squadron commander is a lieutenant colonel, a delta commander is a colonel, and the commander of a field command is a major general or lieutenant general. In NASA spacecraft missions since the beginning of Project Gemini, one crew member on each spacecraft is designated as mission commander. The commander is the captain of the ship, and makes all real-time critical decisions on behalf of the crew and in coordination with the Mission Control Center (MCC). The title of aircraft commander is used in civil aviation to refer to the pilot in command (commonly referred to as \"captain\", which is technically an airline rank and not related to the commander's role on board the aircraft). Within the British police, Commander is a chief officer rank in the two police forces responsible for law enforcement within London, the Metropolitan Police and City of London Police. In both forces, the rank is senior to chief superintendent; in the Metropolitan Police it is junior to deputy assistant commissioner and in the City of London Police it is junior to assistant commissioner. In forces outside London, the rank equates to assistant chief constable which bears the same insignia. The Metropolitan Police introduced the rank in 1946, after the rank of deputy assistant commissioner was split in two, with senior DACs keeping that rank and title and junior DACs being regraded as commanders. The Metropolitan Police also used the rank of deputy commander, ranking just below that of commander, between 1946 and 1968. Officers in charge of the twelve geographical Basic Command Units are referred to as \"BCU commander\". However, the officers do not hold the rank of commander but instead hold the rank of chief superintendent. Prior to organisational change merging boroughs in to BCUs, officers in charge of policing each of the London's boroughs were given the title \"borough commander\". A previous exception to this was the borough commander of Westminster, who held the rank of commander due to the size, complexity, and high-profile nature of the borough. The Metropolitan Police Service announced that by summer 2018 the rank would be phased out, along with that of chief inspector.[33] However, in August 2017 it was announced that the new Commissioner Cressida Dick had cancelled the plan to phase them out.[34] The rank badge worn by a commander or an assistant chief constable consists of crossed tipstaves within a wreath. Within the Metropolitan Police Service, the tips of the tipstaves are blue and not red, unlike other forces. Until the abolition of the rank of deputy commander in 1968, however, a commander wore the same badge of rank as a deputy assistant commissioner. In Australia, commander is a rank used by the Victorian,[35] Tasmanian, Western Australian,[36] South Australian, and Australian Federal police forces. The insignia consists of a crown over three bath stars in a triangular formation, equivalent to a brigadier in the army. In all four forces, it is junior to the rank of assistant commissioner, and senior to the rank of chief superintendent, with the exception of Western Australia and Victoria where it is senior to the rank of superintendent. In New South Wales the position of commander is instated to officers (usually superintendents) in charge of a command or unit. Some large police departments and sheriff's offices in the US have a commander rank. Most commonly, this is the next rank above captain. Examples of this include the Chicago Police Department, Los Angeles Police Department, San Francisco Police Department, Portland Police Bureau and Rochester Police Department. In others, such as the Phoenix Police Department and Saint Paul Police Department, a commander rank is the next rank above lieutenant, and is equivalent to captain. In the Northport, Florida's police department, however, commanders are below captains. A commander in the LAPD is equivalent to an inspector in other large US departments (such as the NYPD); the LAPD rank was originally called inspector as well, but was changed in 1974 to commander. The Metropolitan Police Department of the District of Columbia also uses the rank of commander, which is a grade above inspector and two grades above captain. In the Montgomery County, MD police department a commander is a captain assigned to command a police district. The insignia worn is commonly every insignia between major and major general, depending on the police or sheriff's department. Albuquerque Police Department commanders are captain equivalents, however, with the brass version of the captain's insignia. In some other police or sheriff's departments where the captains have brass insignias instead of silver, such as Florida's Lee County Sheriff's Department, commanders are above captains, and below majors, with the insignia being brass captain's bars with wreathes around. Northport's police commanders have the insignia of second lieutenants. Commander is also used as a title in certain circumstances, such as the commander of a squad of detectives, who would usually be of the rank of lieutenant, and in some police or sheriff's departments where commanders are ranks, officers or deputies of separate ranks are also referred to as commander by title. The Montreal police force, Service de police de la Ville de Montréal, uses the rank of commander (Commandant).[37] In the Incident Command System the incident commander is in charge of the response to an emergency. The title may pass from person to person as the incident develops. The title of commander is used in chivalric orders such as the Sovereign Military Order of Malta for a member senior to a knight. The title of knight commander is often used to denote an even higher rank. These conventions are also used by most of the continental orders of chivalry. The United Kingdom uses different classifications. In most of the British orders of knighthood, the grade of knight (or dame) commander is the lowest grade of knighthood, but is above the grade of companion (which does not carry a knighthood). In the Royal Victorian Order and the Order of the British Empire, the grade of commander is senior to the grade of lieutenant or officer, but junior to that of knight or dame commander. In the British Venerable Order of Saint John, a commander ranks below a knight.",

                "title": "Barcelona - Wikipedia",
                "content": "Barcelona (/ˌbɑːrsəˈloʊnə/ ⓘ BAR-sə-LOH-nə; Catalan: [bəɾsəˈlonə] ⓘ; Spanish: [baɾθeˈlona] ⓘ) is a city on the northeastern coast of Spain. It is the capital and largest city of the autonomous community of Catalonia, as well as the second-most populous municipality of Spain. With a population of 1.6 million within city limits,[8] its urban area extends to numerous neighbouring municipalities within the province of Barcelona and is home to around 5.3 million people,[3] making it the fifth most populous urban area of the European Union after Paris, the Ruhr area, Madrid and Milan.[3] It is one of the largest metropolises on the Mediterranean Sea, located on the coast between the mouths of the rivers Llobregat and Besòs, bounded to the west by the Serra de Collserola mountain range. According to tradition, Barcelona was founded by either the Phoenicians or the Carthaginians, who had trading posts along the Catalonian coast.[9] In the Middle Ages Barcelona became the capital of the County of Barcelona. After joining with the Kingdom of Aragon to form the confederation of the Crown of Aragon, Barcelona, which continued to be the capital of the Principality of Catalonia, became the most important city in the Crown of Aragon and the main economic and administrative centre of the Crown, only to be overtaken by Valencia, wrested from Moorish control by the Catalans, shortly before the dynastic union between the Crown of Castile and the Crown of Aragon in 1492. Barcelona became the centre of Catalan separatism, briefly becoming part of France during the 17th century Reapers' War and again in 1812 until 1814 under Napoleon. It was the capital of Revolutionary Catalonia during the Spanish Revolution of 1936, and the seat of government of the Second Spanish Republic later in the Spanish Civil War, until its capture by the fascists in 1939. After the Spanish transition to democracy in the 1970s, Barcelona once again became the capital of an autonomous Catalonia. Barcelona has a rich cultural heritage and is today an important cultural centre and a major tourist destination. Particularly renowned are the architectural works of Antoni Gaudí and Lluís Domènech i Montaner, which have been designated UNESCO World Heritage Sites. The city is home to two of the most prestigious universities in Spain: the University of Barcelona and Pompeu Fabra University. The headquarters of the Union for the Mediterranean are located in Barcelona. The city is known for hosting the 1992 Summer Olympics as well as world-class conferences and expositions. In addition, many international sport tournaments have been played here. Barcelona is a major cultural, economic, and financial centre in southwestern Europe,[10] as well as the main biotech hub in Spain.[11] As a leading world city, Barcelona's influence in global socio-economic affairs qualifies it for global city status (Beta +).[12] Barcelona is a transport hub, with the Port of Barcelona being one of Europe's principal seaports and busiest European passenger port,[13] an international airport, Barcelona–El Prat Airport, which handles over 50 million passengers per year,[14] an extensive motorway network, and a high-speed rail line with a link to France and the rest of Europe.[15] The name Barcelona comes from the ancient Iberian Baŕkeno, attested in an ancient coin inscription found on the right side of the coin in Iberian script as ,[16] in Ancient Greek sources as Βαρκινών, Barkinṓn;[17][18] and in Latin as Barcino,[19] Barcilonum[20] and Barcenona.[21][22][23] Other sources suggest that the city may have been named after the Carthaginian general Hamilcar Barca, who was supposed to have founded the city in the 3rd century BC,[9][24] but there is no evidence its name in antiquity, Barcino, was connected with the Barcid family of Hamilcar.[25] During the Middle Ages, the city was variously known as Barchinona, Barçalona, Barchelonaa, and Barchenona. An abbreviated form sometimes used by locals for the city is Barna. Barça is only applied to the local football club FC Barcelona, not to the city. Another common abbreviation is 'BCN', which is also the IATA airport code of the Barcelona-El Prat Airport. The city is referred to as the Ciutat Comtal in Catalan and Ciudad Condal in Spanish (i.e., \"Comital City\" or \"City of Counts\"), owing to its past as the seat of the Count of Barcelona.[26] The origin of the earliest settlement at the site of present-day Barcelona is unclear. The ruins of an early settlement have been found, including different tombs and dwellings dating to earlier than 5000 BC.[27][28] In Greek mythology, the founding of Barcelona had been attributed to the mythological Hercules. According to tradition, Barcelona was founded by Punic (Phoenician) settlers, who had trading posts along the Catalonian coast.[9][29][30] In particular, some historians attribute the foundation of the city directly to the historical Carthaginian general, Hamilcar Barca, father of Hannibal, who supposedly named the city Barcino after his family in the 3rd century BC,[9][31] but this theory has been questioned.[25] Archeological evidence in the form of coins from the 3rd century BC have been found on the hills at the foot of Montjuïc with the name Bárkeno written in an ancient script in the Iberian language[citation needed]. Thus, we can conclude[clarification needed] that the Laietani[citation needed], an ancient Iberian (pre-Roman) people of the Iberian peninsula, who inhabited the area occupied by the city of Barcelona around 3–2 BC[clarification needed], called the area Bàrkeno, which means \"The Place of the Plains\" (Barrke = plains/terrace).[32][better source needed] In about 15 BC, the Romans redrew the town as a castrum (Roman military camp) centred on the \"Mons Taber\", a little hill near the Generalitat (Catalan Government) and city hall buildings. The Roman Forum, at the crossing of the Cardo Maximus and Decumanus Maximus, was approximately placed where current Plaça de Sant Jaume is. Thus, the political centre of the city, Catalonia, and its domains has remained in the same place for over 2,000 years. Under the Romans, it was a colony with the surname of Faventia,[33] or, in full, Colonia Faventia Julia Augusta Pia Barcino[34] or Colonia Julia Augusta Faventia Paterna Barcino. Pomponius Mela[35] mentions it among the small towns of the district, probably as it was eclipsed by its neighbour Tarraco (modern Tarragona), but it may be gathered from later writers that it gradually grew in wealth and consequence, favoured as it was with a beautiful situation and an excellent harbour.[36] It enjoyed immunity from imperial burdens.[37] The city minted its own coins; some from the era of Galba survive. Important Roman vestiges are displayed in Plaça del Rei underground, as a part of the Barcelona City History Museum (MUHBA); the typically Roman grid plan is still visible today in the layout of the historical centre, the Barri Gòtic (Gothic Quarter). Some remaining fragments of the Roman walls have been incorporated into the cathedral.[38] The cathedral, Catedral Basílica Metropolitana de Barcelona, is also sometimes called La Seu, which simply means cathedral (and see, among other things) in Catalan.[39][40] It is said to have been founded in 343. The city was conquered by the Visigoths in the early 5th century, becoming for a few years the capital of all Hispania. After being conquered by the Umayyads in the early 8th century, it was conquered after a siege in 801 by Charlemagne's son Louis, who made Barcelona the seat of the Carolingian \"Hispanic March\" (Marca Hispanica), a buffer zone ruled by the Count of Barcelona.[41] The Counts of Barcelona became increasingly independent and expanded their territory to include much of modern Catalonia, although in 985, Barcelona was sacked by the army of Almanzor.[42] The sack was so traumatic that most of Barcelona's population was either killed or enslaved.[43] In 1137, Aragon and the County of Barcelona merged in dynastic union[44][45] by the marriage of Ramon Berenguer IV and Petronilla of Aragon, their titles finally borne by only one person when their son Alfonso II of Aragon ascended to the throne in 1162. His territories were later to be known as the Crown of Aragon, which conquered many overseas possessions and ruled the western Mediterranean Sea with outlying territories in Naples and Sicily and as far as Athens in the 13th century. Barcelona was the leading slave trade centre of the Crown of Aragon up until the 15th century, when it was eclipsed by Valencia.[46] It initially fed from eastern and Balkan slave stock later drawing from a Maghribian and, ultimately, Subsaharan pool of slaves.[47] The Bank or Taula de canvi de Barcelona, often viewed as the oldest public bank in Europe, was established by the city magistrates in 1401. It originated from necessities of the state, as did the Bank of Venice (1402) and the Bank of Genoa (1407).[48] In the beginning of the Early Modern period, Barcelona lost political primacy, but the economy managed to achieve a balance between production capacity and imports.[49] In the context of the wider early recovery of Catalonia from the 17th-century crisis in the second half of the century, increasing maritime activity since 1675 doubled traffic in the port of Barcelona compared to figures from the beginning of the 17th century.[50] In the late 17th and early 18th century, Barcelona repeatedly endured the effects of war, including the 1691 bombing, the sieges of 1697, 1704, 1705, 1706, and the 1713 blockade and ensuing 1714 siege and assault.[51] In the 18th century, the population grew from 30,000 to about 100,000 inhabitants, as the city became one of the key mercantile centres in the Western Mediterranean, with inland influence up to Zaragoza, and to the south up to Alicante.[52] A fortress was built at Montjuïc that overlooked the harbour. Much of Barcelona was negatively affected by the Napoleonic wars, but the start of industrialization saw the fortunes of the province improve. In the mid-1850s, Barcelona was struggling with population density as it became an industrial, port city and European capital. The city's density was at 856 people per hectare, more than double that of Paris. Mortality rates were on the rise and any outbreaks of disease would devastate the population. To solve the issue, a civil engineer named Ildefons Cerdà proposed a plan for a new district known as the Eixample. The citizens of Barcelona had begun to demolish the medieval wall surrounding and constricting the city. Cerdà thought it best to transform the land outside the walls into an area characterized by a scientific approach to urbanization. His proposal consisted of a grid of streets to unite the old city and surrounding villages. There would also be wide streets to allow people to breathe clean air, gardens in the centre of each street block, integration of rich and poor giving both groups access to the same services, and smooth-flowing traffic. Urban quality, egalitarianism, hygiene, sunlight, and efficiency were all major keys for Cerdà's vision. Not everything he imagined would be realized within the Eixample district, but the iconic octagonal superblocks with chamfered corners for better visibility are his direct brainchild and remain immensely helpful even 170 years later. The district and its ideals were not appreciated at the time. The city council awarded the design of the extension plan to another architect. The Spanish government was the one to step in and impose Cerdà's plan, laying the groundwork for many more tensions between the Spanish and Catalan administrations. Regardless, some of the upper class citizens of Barcelona were excited by the new plan and began a race to build \"the biggest, tallest, most attractive house\" in the district. Their interest and money fueled the rich diversity that we now see in the district's architecture. In the end, Cerdà's ideas would have a lasting impact on Barcelona's development, earning it international recognition for its highly efficient approach to urban planning and design.[53][54] During the Spanish Civil War, the city, and Catalonia in general, were resolutely Republican. Many enterprises and public services were collectivized by the CNT and UGT unions. As the power of the Republican government and the Generalitat diminished, much of the city was under the effective control of anarchist groups. The anarchists lost control of the city to their own allies, the Communists and official government troops, after the street fighting of the Barcelona May Days. The fall of the city on 26 January 1939, caused a mass exodus of civilians who fled to the French border. The resistance of Barcelona to Franco's coup d'état was to have lasting effects after the defeat of the Republican government. The autonomous institutions of Catalonia were abolished,[57] and the use of the Catalan language in public life was suppressed. Barcelona remained the second largest city in Spain, at the heart of a region which was relatively industrialized and prosperous, despite the devastation of the civil war. The result was a large-scale immigration from poorer regions of Spain (particularly Andalusia, Murcia and Galicia), which in turn led to rapid urbanization. In 1992, Barcelona hosted the Summer Olympics. The after-effects of this are credited with driving major changes in what had, up until then, been a largely industrial city. As part of the preparation for the games, industrial buildings along the sea-front were demolished and 3 km (2 mi) of beach were created. New construction increased the road capacity of the city by 17%, the sewage handling capacity by 27% and the amount of new green areas and beaches by 78%. Between 1990 and 2004, the number of hotel rooms in the city doubled. Perhaps more importantly, the outside perception of the city was changed making, by 2012, Barcelona the 12th most popular city destination in the world and the 5th amongst European cities.[58][59][60][61][62] The death of Franco in 1975 brought on a period of democratization throughout Spain. Pressure for change was particularly strong in Barcelona, which considered that it had been punished during nearly forty years of Francoism for its support of the Republican government.[63] Massive, but peaceful, demonstrations on 11 September 1977 assembled over a million people in the streets of Barcelona to call for the restoration of Catalan autonomy. It was granted less than a month later.[64] The development of Barcelona was promoted by two events in 1986: Spanish accession to the European Community, and particularly Barcelona's designation as host city of the 1992 Summer Olympics.[65][66] The process of urban regeneration has been rapid, and accompanied by a greatly increased international reputation of the city as a tourist destination. The increased cost of housing has led to a slight decline (−16.6%) in the population over the last two decades of the 20th century as many families move out into the suburbs. This decline has been reversed since 2001, as a new wave of immigration (particularly from Latin America and from Morocco) has gathered pace.[67] In 1987, an ETA car bombing at Hipercor killed 21 people. On 17 August 2017, a van was driven into pedestrians on La Rambla, killing 14 and injuring at least 100, one of whom later died. Other attacks took place elsewhere in Catalonia. The Prime Minister of Spain, Mariano Rajoy, called the attack in Barcelona a jihadist attack. Amaq News Agency attributed indirect responsibility for the attack to the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL).[68][69][70] During the 2010s, Barcelona became the focus city[citation needed] for the ongoing Catalan independence movement, its consequent standoff between the regional and national government and later protests.[71] In July 2023, Barcelona was announced as the UNESCO-UIA World Capital of Architecture for the 2024–2026 term. This means it will be the hub for discussion around global challenges including culture, heritage, urban planning and architecture. In addition to being the capital through 2026, it will also host the UIA World Congress of Architects for that year. The honour is befitting of Barcelona, as its history is peppered with architectural achievement and various iconic styles and influences. From its ancient Roman roots, to the Gothic and Modernisme movements, Barcelona has thrived through the way it ties together architecture and culture.[72] Barcelona is located on the northeast coast of the Iberian Peninsula, facing the Mediterranean Sea, on a plain approximately 5 km (3 mi) wide limited by the mountain range of Collserola, the Llobregat river to the southwest and the Besòs river to the north.[73] This plain covers an area of 170 km2 (66 sq mi),[73] of which 101 km2 (39.0 sq mi)[74] are occupied by the city itself. It is 120 km (75 mi) south of the Pyrenees and the Catalan border with France. Tibidabo, 512 m (1,680 ft) high, offers striking views over the city[75] and is topped by the 288.4 m (946.2 ft) Torre de Collserola, a telecommunications tower that is visible from most of the city. Barcelona is peppered with small hills, most of them urbanized, that gave their name to the neighbourhoods built upon them, such as Carmel (267 m or 876 ft), Putxet (es) (181 m or 594 ft) and Rovira (261 m or 856 ft). The escarpment of Montjuïc (173 m or 568 ft), situated to the southeast, overlooks the harbour and is topped by Montjuïc Castle, a fortress built in the 17–18th centuries to control the city as a replacement for the Ciutadella. Today, the fortress is a museum and Montjuïc is home to several sporting and cultural venues, as well as Barcelona's biggest park and gardens. The city borders on the municipalities of Santa Coloma de Gramenet and Sant Adrià de Besòs to the north; the Mediterranean Sea to the east; El Prat de Llobregat and L'Hospitalet de Llobregat to the south; and Sant Feliu de Llobregat, Sant Just Desvern, Esplugues de Llobregat, Sant Cugat del Vallès, and Montcada i Reixac to the west. The municipality includes two small sparsely-inhabited exclaves to the north-west. According to the Köppen climate classification, Barcelona has a hot summer Mediterranean climate (Csa), with mild winters and warm to hot summers,[76] while the rainiest seasons are autumn and spring. The rainfall pattern is characterized by a short (3 months) dry season in summer, as well as less winter rainfall than in a typical Mediterranean climate. However, both June and August are wetter than February, which is unusual for the Mediterranean climate. This subtype, labelled as \"Portuguese\" by the French geographer George Viers after the climate classification of Emmanuel de Martonne[77] and found in the NW Mediterranean area (e.g. Marseille), can be seen as transitional to the humid subtropical climate (Cfa) found in inland areas. Barcelona is densely populated, thus heavily influenced by the urban heat island effect. Areas outside of the urbanized districts can have as much as 2 °C of difference in temperatures throughout the year.[78] Its average annual temperature is 21.2 °C (70.2 °F) during the day and 15.1 °C (59.2 °F) at night. The average annual temperature of the sea is about 20 °C (68 °F). In the coldest month, January, the temperature typically ranges from 12 to 18 °C (54 to 64 °F) during the day, 6 to 12 °C (43 to 54 °F) at night and the average sea temperature is 13 °C (55 °F).[79] In the warmest month, August, the typical temperature ranges from 27 to 31 °C (81 to 88 °F) during the day, about 23 °C (73 °F) at night and the average sea temperature is 26 °C (79 °F).[79] Generally, the summer or \"holiday\" season lasts about six months, from May to October. Two months – April and November – are transitional; sometimes the temperature exceeds 20 °C (68 °F), with an average temperature of 18–19 °C (64–66 °F) during the day and 11–13 °C (52–55 °F) at night. December, January and February are the coldest months, with average temperatures around 15 °C (59 °F) during the day and 9 °C (48 °F) at night. Large fluctuations in temperature are rare, particularly in the summer months. Because of the proximity to the warm sea plus the urban heat island, frosts are very rare in the city of Barcelona. Snow is also very infrequent in the city of Barcelona, but light snowfalls can occur yearly in the nearby Collserola mountains, such as in the Fabra Observatory located in a nearby mountain.[80] Barcelona averages 78 rainy days per year (≥ 1 mm), and annual average relative humidity is 72%, ranging from 69% in July to 75% in October. Rainfall totals are highest in late summer and autumn (September–November) and lowest in early and mid-summer (June–August), with a secondary winter minimum (February–March). Sunshine duration is 2,524 hours per year, from 138 (average 4.5 hours of sunshine a day) in December to 310 (average 10 hours of sunshine a day) in July.[81] According to Barcelona's City Council, the city's population as of 1 January 2016[update] was 1,608,746 people,[86] on a land area of 101.4 km2 (39 sq mi). It is the main component of an administrative area of Greater Barcelona, with a population of 3,218,071 in an area of 636 km2 (246 sq mi) (density 5,060 inhabitants/km2). The population of the urban area was 4,840,000.[3] It is the central nucleus of the Barcelona metropolitan area, which relies on a population of 5,474,482.[4] In 1900, Barcelona had a population of 533,000,[73] which grew steadily but slowly until 1950, when it started absorbing a high number of people from other less-industrialized parts of Spain. Barcelona's population peaked in 1979 at 1,906,998, and fell throughout the 1980s and 1990s as more people sought a higher quality of life in outlying cities in the Barcelona Metropolitan Area. After bottoming out in 2000 with 1,496,266 residents, the city's population began to rise again as younger people started to return, causing a great increase in housing prices.[87] Spanish is the most spoken language in Barcelona (according to the linguistic census held by the Government of Catalonia in 2013) and it is understood almost universally. Catalan is also very commonly spoken in the city: it is understood by 95% of the population, while 72.3% can speak it, 79% can read it, and 53% can write it.[88] Knowledge of Catalan has increased significantly in recent decades thanks to a language immersion educational system. After Catalan and Spanish, the most spoken languages in Barcelona are those from North Africa, such as Amazigh and Arabic, followed by Bengali, Urdu, Panjabi, Mandarin Chinese, Romanian, English, Russian and Quechua, according to data collected by the University of Barcelona.[89] Barcelona is one of the most densely populated cities in Europe. For the year 2008 the city council calculated the population to 1,621,090 living in the 102.2 km2 sized municipality, giving the city an average population density of 15,926 inhabitants per square kilometre with Eixample being the most populated district.[90][full citation needed] In the case of Barcelona though, the land distribution is extremely uneven. Half of the municipality or 50.2 km2, all of it located on the municipal edge is made up of the ten least densely populated neighbourhoods containing less than 10% of the city's population, the uninhabited Zona Franca industrial area and Montjuïc forest park. Leaving the remaining 90% or slightly below 1.5 million inhabitants living on the remaining 52 km2 (20 sq mi) at an average density close to 28,500 inhabitants per square kilometre.[90][full citation needed] Of the 73 neighbourhoods in the city, 45 had a population density above 20,000 inhabitants per square kilometre with a combined population of 1,313,424 inhabitants living on 38.6 km2 at an average density of 33,987 inhabitants per square kilometre. The 30 most densely populated neighbourhoods accounted for 57.5% of the city population occupying only 22.7% of the municipality, or in other words, 936,406 people living at an average density of 40,322 inhabitants per square kilometre. The city's highest density is found at and around the neighbourhood of la Sagrada Família where four of the city's most densely populated neighbourhoods are located side by side, all with a population density above 50,000 inhabitants per square kilometre.[90][full citation needed] In 1900, almost a third (28.9 percent) of the population were children (aged younger than 14 years). In 2017, this age group constituted only 12.7% of the population. In 2017, people aged between 15 and 24 years made up 9 percent of the population; those aged between 25 and 44 years made up 30.6 percent of the population; while those aged between 45 and 64 years formed 56.9% of all Barcelonans. In 1900, people aged 65 and older made up just 6.5 percent of the population. In 2017, this age group made up 21.5 percent of the population.[91][92] In 2016, about 59% of the inhabitants of the city were born in Catalonia and 18.5% coming from the rest of the country. In addition to that, 22.5% of the population was born outside of Spain, a proportion which has more than doubled since 2001 and more than quintupled since 1996 when it was 8.6% and 3.9% respectively.[86] The most important region of origin of migrants is Europe, with many coming from Italy (26,676) or France (13,506).[86] Moreover, many migrants come from Latin American nations such as Bolivia, Ecuador or Colombia. Since the 1990s, and similar to other migrants, many Latin Americans have settled in northern parts of the city.[94] There exists a relatively large Pakistani community in Barcelona with up to twenty thousand nationals. The community consists of significantly more men than women. Many of the Pakistanis are living in Ciutat Vella. First Pakistani migrants came in the 1970s, with increasing numbers in the 1990s.[95] Other significant migrant groups come from Asia as from China and the Philippines.[86] There is a Japanese community clustered in Bonanova, Les Tres Torres, Pedralbes, and other northern neighbourhoods, and a Japanese international school serves that community.[96] In 2007 most of the inhabitants stated they are Roman Catholic (208 churches).[97] In a 2011 survey conducted by InfoCatólica, 49.5% of Barcelona residents of all ages identified themselves as Catholic.[98] This was the first time that more than half of respondents did not identify themselves as Catholic Christians.[98] The numbers reflect a broader trend in Spain whereby the numbers of self-identified Catholics have declined.[98] In 2019, a survey by Centro de Investigaciones Sociológicas showed that 53.2% of residents in Barcelona identified themselves as Catholic (9.9% practising Catholics, 43.3% non-practising Catholics).[99] The province has the largest Muslim community in Spain, 322,698 people in Barcelona province are of Muslim religion.[100] A considerable number of Muslims live in Barcelona due to immigration (169 locations, mostly professed by Moroccans in Spain).[97] In 2014, 322,698 out of 5.5 million people in the province of Barcelona identified themselves as Muslim,[100] which makes 5.6% of the total population. The city also has the largest Jewish community in Spain, with an estimated 3,500 Jews living in the city.[101] There are also a number of other groups, including Evangelical (71 locations, mostly professed by Roma), Jehovah's Witnesses (21 Kingdom Halls), Buddhists (13 locations),[102] and Eastern Orthodox.[103] The Barcelona metropolitan area comprises over 66% of the people of Catalonia, one of the richer regions in Europe and the fourth richest region per capita in Spain, with a GDP per capita amounting to €28,400 (16% more than the EU average[broken anchor]). The greater Barcelona metropolitan area had a GDP amounting to $177 billion (equivalent to $34,821 in per capita terms, 44% more than the EU average), making it the 4th most economically powerful city by gross GDP in the European Union, and 35th in the world in 2009.[104] Barcelona city had a very high GDP of €80,894 per head in 2004, according to Eurostat.[105] Furthermore, Barcelona was Europe's fourth best business city and fastest improving European city, with growth improved by 17% per year as of 2009[update].[106] Barcelona was the 24th most \"livable city\" in the world in 2015 according to lifestyle magazine Monocle.[107] Similarly, according to Innovation Analysts 2thinknow, Barcelona occupies 13th place in the world on Innovation Cities™ Global Index.[108] At the same time it is according to the Global Wealth and Lifestyle Report 2020 one of the most affordable cities in the world for a luxury lifestyle.[109] Barcelona has a long-standing mercantile tradition. Less well known is that the city industrialized early, taking off in 1833, when Catalonia's already sophisticated textile industry began to use steam power. It became the first and most important industrial city in the Mediterranean basin. Since then, manufacturing has played a large role in its history. Borsa de Barcelona (Barcelona Stock Exchange) is the main stock exchange in the northeastern part of the Iberian Peninsula. Barcelona was recognized as the Southern European City of the Future for 2014/15, based on its economic potential,[110] by FDi Magazine in their bi-annual rankings.[111] It also has several congress halls, notably Fira de Barcelona – the second largest trade fair and exhibition centre in Europe, that host a quickly growing number of national and international events each year (at present above 50). The total exhibition floor space of Fira de Barcelona venues is 405,000 m2 (41 ha), not counting Gran Via centre on the Plaza de Europa. However, the Eurozone crisis and deep cuts in business travel affected the council's positioning of the city as a convention centre. An important business centre, the World Trade Center Barcelona, is located in Barcelona's Port Vell harbour. The city is known for hosting well as world-class conferences and expositions, including the 1888 Exposición Universal de Barcelona, the 1929 Barcelona International Exposition (Expo 1929), the 2004 Universal Forum of Cultures and the 2004 World Urban Forum.[112] Barcelona was the 20th-most-visited city in the world by international visitors and the fifth most visited city in Europe after London, Paris, Istanbul and Rome, with 5.5 million international visitors in 2011.[113] By 2015, both Prague and Milan had more international visitors.[114] With its popular tree-lined pedestrian street, Les Rambles (Las Ramblas), Barcelona is ranked the most popular city to visit in Spain.[115] Barcelona is an internationally renowned tourist destination, with numerous recreational areas, one of the best beaches in the world,[116][117] mild and warm climate, historical monuments, including eight UNESCO World Heritage Sites, 519 hotels as of March 2016[update][118] including 35 five-star hotels,[119] and developed tourist infrastructure. Due to its large influx of tourists each year, Barcelona, like many other tourism capitals, has to deal with pickpockets, with wallets and passports being commonly stolen items. Despite its moderate pickpocket rate, Barcelona is considered one of the safest cities in terms of security and personal safety,[120] mainly because of a sophisticated policing strategy that has dropped crime by 32% in just over three years and has led it to be considered the 15th safest city in the world by Business Insider in 2016.[121] While tourism produces economic benefits, according to one report,[citation needed] the city is \"overrun [by] hordes of tourists\". In early 2017, over 150,000 protesters warned that tourism is destabilizing the city. Slogans included \"Tourists go home\", \"Barcelona is not for sale\" and \"We will not be driven out\". By then, the number of visitors had increased from 1.7 million in 1990 to 32 million in a city with a population of 1.62 million, increasing the cost of rental housing for residents and overcrowding the public places. While tourists spent an estimated €30 billion in 2017, they are viewed by some as a threat to Barcelona's identity.[122] A May 2017 article in the British online daily The Independent included Barcelona among the \"Eight Places That Hate Tourists the Most\" and included a comment from Mayor Ada Colau, \"We don't want the city to become a cheap souvenir shop\", citing Venice as an example.[123] To moderate the problem, the city has stopped issuing licenses for new hotels and holiday apartments; it also fined AirBnb €30,000. The mayor has suggested introducing a new tourist tax and setting a limit on the number of visitors.[123] One industry insider, Justin Francis, founder of the Responsible Travel agency, stated that steps must be taken to limit the number of visitors that are causing an \"overtourism crisis\" in several major European cities. \"Ultimately, residents must be prioritised over tourists for housing, infrastructure and access to services because they have a long-term stake in the city's success\", he said.[124] \"Managing tourism more responsibly can help\", Francis later told a journalist, \"but some destinations may just have too many tourists, and Barcelona may be a case of that\".[125] Industry generates 21% of the total gross domestic product (GDP) of the region,[126] with the energy, chemical and metallurgy industries accounting for 47% of industrial production.[127] The Barcelona metropolitan area had 67% of the total number of industrial establishments in Catalonia as of 1997.[128] Barcelona has long been an important European automobile manufacturing centre. Formerly there were automobile factories of AFA, Abadal, Actividades Industriales, Alvarez, America, Artés de Arcos, Balandrás, Baradat-Esteve, Biscúter, J. Castro, Clúa, David, Delfín, Díaz y Grilló, Ebro trucks, Edis [ca], Elizalde, Automóviles España, Eucort, Fenix, Fábrica Hispano, Auto Academia Garriga, Fábrica Española de Automóviles Hebe, Hispano-Suiza, Huracán Motors, Talleres Hereter, Junior SL, Kapi, La Cuadra, M.A., Automóviles Matas, Motores y Motos, Nacional Custals, National Pescara, Nacional RG, Nacional Rubi, Nacional Sitjes, Automóviles Nike, Orix, Otro Ford, Patria, Pegaso, PTV, Ricart, Ricart-España, Industrias Salvador, Siata Española, Stevenson, Romagosa y Compañía, Garaje Storm, Talleres Hereter, Trimak, Automóviles Victoria, Manufacturas Mecánicas Aleu.[129][130] Today, the headquarters and a large factory of SEAT (the largest Spanish automobile manufacturer) are in one of its suburbs. There is also a Nissan factory in the logistics and industrial area of the city.[131] The factory of Derbi, a large manufacturer of motorcycles, scooters and mopeds, also lies near the city.[132] As in other modern cities, the manufacturing sector has long since been overtaken by the services sector, though it remains very important. The region's leading industries are textiles, chemical, pharmaceutical, motor, electronic, printing, logistics, publishing, in telecommunications industry and culture the notable Mobile World Congress, and information technology services. The traditional importance of textiles is reflected in Barcelona's drive to become a major fashion centre. There have been many attempts to launch Barcelona as a fashion capital, notably Gaudi Home.[citation needed] Beginning in the summer of 2000, the city hosted the Bread & Butter urban fashion fair until 2009, when its organizers announced that it would be returning to Berlin. This was a hard blow for the city as the fair brought €100 m to the city in just three days.[133][134] From 2009, The Brandery, an urban fashion show, was held in Barcelona twice a year until 2012. According to the Global Language Monitor's annual ranking of the world's top fifty fashion capitals Barcelona was named as the seventh most important fashion capital of the world right after Milan and before Berlin in 2015.[135] As the capital of the autonomous community of Catalonia, Barcelona is the seat of the Catalan government, known as the Generalitat de Catalunya; of particular note are the executive branch, the parliament, and the High Court of Justice of Catalonia. The city is also the capital of the Province of Barcelona and the Barcelonès comarca (district). Barcelona is governed by a city council formed by 41 city councillors, elected for a four-year term by universal suffrage. As one of the two biggest cities in Spain, Barcelona is subject to a special law articulated through the Carta Municipal (Municipal Law). A first version of this law was passed in 1960 and amended later, but the current version was approved in March 2006.[136] According to this law, Barcelona's city council is organized in two levels: a political one, with elected city councillors, and one executive, which administers the programs and executes the decisions taken on the political level.[137] This law also gives the local government a special relationship with the central government and it also gives the mayor wider prerogatives by the means of municipal executive commissions.[138] It expands the powers of the city council in areas like telecommunications, city traffic, road safety and public safety. It also gives a special economic regime to the city's treasury and it gives the council a veto in matters that will be decided by the central government, but that will need a favourable report from the council.[136] The Comissió de Govern (Government Commission) is the executive branch, formed by 24 councillors, led by the Mayor, with 5 lieutenant-mayors and 17 city councillors, each in charge of an area of government, and 5 non-elected councillors.[139] The plenary, formed by the 41 city councillors, has advisory, planning, regulatory, and fiscal executive functions.[140] The six Commissions del Consell Municipal (City council commissions) have executive and controlling functions in the field of their jurisdiction. They are composed by a number of councillors proportional to the number of councillors each political party has in the plenary.[141] The city council has jurisdiction in the fields of city planning, transportation, municipal taxes, public highways security through the Guàrdia Urbana (the municipal police), city maintenance, gardens, parks and environment, facilities (like schools, nurseries, sports centres, libraries, and so on), culture, sports, youth and social welfare. Some of these competencies are not exclusive, but shared with the Generalitat de Catalunya or the central Spanish government. In some fields with shared responsibility (such as public health, education or social services), there is a shared Agency or Consortium between the city and the Generalitat to plan and manage services.[142] The executive branch is led by a Chief Municipal Executive Officer which answers to the Mayor. It is made up of departments which are legally part of the city council and by separate legal entities of two types: autonomous public departments and public enterprises.[143] The seat of the city council is on the Plaça de Sant Jaume, opposite the seat of Generalitat de Catalunya. Since the coming of the Spanish democracy, Barcelona had been governed by the PSC, first with an absolute majority and later in coalition with ERC and ICV. After the May 2007 election, the ERC did not renew the coalition agreement and the PSC governed in a minority coalition with ICV as the junior partner. After 32 years, on 22 May 2011, CiU gained a plurality of seats at the municipal election, gaining 15 seats to the PSC's 11. The PP hold 8 seats, ICV 5 and ERC 2. Since 1987, the city has been divided into 10 administrative districts (districtes in Catalan, distritos in Spanish): The districts are based mostly on historical divisions, and several are former towns annexed by the city of Barcelona in the 18th and 19th centuries that still maintain their own distinct character. Each district has its own council led by a city councillor. The composition of each district council depends on the number of votes each political party had in that district, so a district can be led by a councillor from a different party than the executive council. Barcelona has a well-developed higher education system of public universities. Most prominent among these are the University of Barcelona (established in 1450) and the more modern Pompeu Fabra University.[144][145] Barcelona is also home to the Polytechnic University of Catalonia, and in the private sector the EADA Business School (founded in 1957), which became the first Barcelona institution to run manager training programmes for the business community. IESE Business School, as well as the largest private educational institution, the Ramon Llull University, which encompasses schools and institutes such as the ESADE Business School. The Autonomous University of Barcelona, another public university, is located in Bellaterra, a town in the Metropolitan Area. Toulouse Business School and the Open University of Catalonia (a private Internet-centred open university) are also based in Barcelona. The city has a network of public schools, from nurseries to high schools, under the responsibility of a consortium led by city council (though the curriculum is the responsibility of the Generalitat de Catalunya). There are also many private schools, some of them Roman Catholic. Most such schools receive a public subsidy on a per-student basis, are subject to inspection by the public authorities, and are required to follow the same curricular guidelines as public schools, though they charge tuition. Known as escoles concertades, they are distinct from schools whose funding is entirely private (escoles privades). The language of instruction at public schools and escoles concertades is Catalan, as stipulated by the 2009 Catalan Education Act. Spanish may be used as a language of instruction by teachers of Spanish literature or language, and foreign languages by teachers of those languages. An experimental partial immersion programme adopted by some schools allows for the teaching of a foreign language (English, generally) across the curriculum, though this is limited to a maximum of 30% of the school day. No public school or escola concertada in Barcelona may offer 50% or full immersion programmes in a foreign language, nor does any public school or escola concertada offer International Baccalaureate programmes. Barcelona's cultural roots go back 2000 years. Since the arrival of democracy, the Catalan language (very much repressed during the dictatorship of Franco) has been promoted, both by recovering works from the past and by stimulating the creation of new works. Barcelona is designated as a world-class city by the Globalization and World Cities Study Group and Network.[146] It has also been part of the UNESCO Creative Cities Network as a City of Literature since 2015.[147] Barcelona has many venues for live music and theatre, including the world-renowned Gran Teatre del Liceu opera house, the Teatre Nacional de Catalunya, the Teatre Lliure and the Palau de la Música Catalana concert hall. Barcelona also is home to the Barcelona Symphony and Catalonia National Orchestra (Orquestra Simfònica de Barcelona i Nacional de Catalunya, usually known as OBC), the largest symphonic orchestra in Catalonia. In 1999, the OBC inaugurated its new venue in the brand-new Auditorium (L'Auditori). It performs around 75 concerts per season and its current director is Eiji Oue.[148] It is home to the Barcelona Guitar Orchestra, directed by Sergi Vicente. The major thoroughfare of La Rambla is home to mime artists and street performers. Yearly, two major pop music festivals take place in the city, the Sónar Festival and the Primavera Sound Festival. The city also has a thriving alternative music scene, with groups such as The Pinker Tones receiving international attention.[149] Barcelona is an international hub of highly active and diverse nightlife with bars, dance bars and nightclubs staying open well past midnight.[150] El Periódico de Catalunya, La Vanguardia and Ara are Barcelona's three major daily newspapers (the first two with Catalan and Spanish editions, Ara only in Catalan) while Sport and El Mundo Deportivo (both in Spanish) are the city's two major sports daily newspapers, published by the same companies. The city is also served by a number of smaller publications such as Ara and El Punt Avui (in Catalan), by nationwide newspapers with special Barcelona editions such as El País (in Spanish, with an online version in Catalan) and El Mundo (in Spanish), and by several free newspapers like 20 minutos and Què (all bilingual). Barcelona's oldest and main online newspaper VilaWeb is also the oldest one in Europe[citation needed] (with Catalan and English editions). Several major FM stations include Catalunya Ràdio, RAC 1, RAC 105 and Cadena SER. Barcelona also has a local TV station, Betevé, owned by city council. The headquarters of Televisió de Catalunya, Catalonia's public network, are located in Sant Joan Despí, in Barcelona's metropolitan area. Barcelona has a long sporting tradition and hosted the highly successful 1992 Summer Olympics as well as several matches during the 1982 FIFA World Cup (at the two stadiums). It has hosted about 30 sports events of international significance.[citation needed] FC Barcelona is a sports club best known worldwide for its football team, one of the largest and the wealthiest in the world.[151] It has 74 national trophies (while finishing 46 times as runners-up) and 17 continental prizes (with being runners-up 11 times), including five UEFA Champions League trophies out of eight finals and three FIFA Club World Cup wins out of four finals. The club won six trophies in a calendar year in 2009, becoming one of only 2 male football teams in the world to win the coveted sextuple, apart from FC Bayern Munich in 2020. FC Barcelona also has professional teams in other sports like FC Barcelona Regal (basketball), FC Barcelona Handbol (handball), FC Barcelona Hoquei (roller hockey), FC Barcelona Ice Hockey (ice hockey), FC Barcelona Futsal (futsal) and FC Barcelona Rugby (rugby union), all at one point winners of the highest national or European competitions. The club's museum is the second most visited in Catalonia. The matches against cross-town rivals RCD Espanyol are of particular interest, but there are other Barcelonan football clubs in lower categories, like CE Europa and UE Sant Andreu. FC Barcelona's basketball team has a noted rivalry in the Liga ACB with nearby Joventut Badalona. Barcelona has three UEFA elite stadiums: FC Barcelona's Camp Nou, the largest stadium in Europe with a capacity of 99,354; the publicly owned Estadi Olímpic Lluís Companys, with a capacity of 55,926; used for the 1992 Olympics; and Estadi Cornellà-El Prat, with a capacity of 40,500. Furthermore, the city has several smaller stadiums such as Mini Estadi (also owned by FC Barcelona) with a capacity of 15,000, Camp Municipal Narcís Sala with a capacity of 6,563 and Nou Sardenya with a capacity of 7,000. The city has a further three multifunctional venues for sports and concerts: the Palau Sant Jordi with a capacity of 12,000 to 24,000 (depending on use), the Palau Blaugrana with a capacity of 7,500, and the Palau dels Esports de Barcelona with a capacity of 3,500. Barcelona was the host city for the 2013 World Aquatics Championships, which were held at the Palau San Jordi.[152] Several road running competitions are organized year-round in Barcelona: the Barcelona Marathon every March with over 10,000 participants in 2010, the Cursa de Bombers in April, the Cursa de El Corte Inglés in May (with about 60,000 participants each year), the Cursa de la Mercè, the Cursa Jean Bouin, the Milla Sagrada Família and the San Silvestre. There is also the Ultratrail Collserola which passes 85 km (53 mi) through the Collserola forest. The Open Seat Godó, a 50-year-old ATP World Tour 500 Series tennis tournament, is held annually in the facilities of the Real Club de Tenis Barcelona. Each year on Christmas Day, a 200-meter swimming race across the Old Port of Barcelona takes place.[153] Near Barcelona, in Montmeló, the 107,000 capacity Circuit de Barcelona-Catalunya racetrack hosts the Formula One Spanish Grand Prix, the Catalan motorcycle Grand Prix, the Spanish GT Championship and races in the GP2 Series. Skateboarding and cycling are also very popular in Barcelona; in and around the city there are dozens of kilometers of bicycle paths.[citation needed] Barcelona is also home to numerous social centres and illegal squats that effectively form a shadow society mainly made up of the unemployed, immigrants, dropouts, anarchists, anti-authoritarians and autonomists.[154] Peter Gelderloos estimates that there around 200 squatted buildings and 40 social centres across the city with thousands of inhabitants, making it one of the largest squatter movements in the world. He notes that they pirate electricity, internet and water allowing them to live on less than one euro a day. He argues that these squats embrace an anarcho-communist and anti-work philosophy, often freely fixing up new houses, cleaning, patching roofs, installing windows, toilets, showers, lights and kitchens. In the wake of austerity, the squats have provided a number of social services to the surrounding residents, including bicycle repair workshops, carpentry workshops, self-defense classes, free libraries, community gardens, free meals, computer labs, language classes, theatre groups, free medical care and legal support services.[155] The squats help elderly residents avoid eviction and organize various protests throughout Barcelona. Notable squats include Can Vies and Can Masdeu.[citation needed] Barcelona is served by Barcelona-El Prat Airport, about 17 km (11 mi) south-west of the centre of Barcelona. It is the second-largest airport in Spain, and the largest on the Mediterranean coast, which handled more than 50.17 million passengers in 2018, showing an annual upward trend.[156] It is a main hub for Vueling Airlines and Ryanair, and also a focus for Iberia and Air Europa. The airport mainly serves domestic and European destinations, although some airlines offer destinations in Latin America, Asia and the United States. The airport is connected to the city by highway, metro (Airport T1 and Airport T2 stations), commuter train (Barcelona Airport railway station) and scheduled bus service. A new terminal (T1) has been built, and entered service on 17 June 2009. Some low-cost airlines, also use Girona-Costa Brava Airport, about 90 km (56 mi) to the north, Reus Airport, 77 km (48 mi) to the south, or Lleida-Alguaire Airport, about 150 km (93 mi) to the west, of the city. Sabadell Airport is a smaller airport in the nearby town of Sabadell, devoted to pilot training, aerotaxi and private flights. The Port of Barcelona has a 2000-year-old history and a great contemporary commercial importance. It is Europe's ninth largest container port, with a trade volume of 1.72 million TEU's in 2013.[157] The port is managed by the Port Authority of Barcelona. Its 10 km2 (4 sq mi) are divided into three zones: Port Vell (the old port), the commercial port and the logistics port (Barcelona Free Port). The port is undergoing an enlargement that will double its size thanks to diverting the mouth of the Llobregat river 2 km (1 mi) to the south.[158] The Barcelona harbour is the leading European cruiser port and a very important Mediterranean turnaround base.[159] In 2013, 3.6 million pleasure cruise passengers used the Port of Barcelona.[157] The Port Vell area also houses the Maremagnum (a commercial mall), a multiplex cinema, the IMAX Port Vell and one of Europe's largest aquariums – Aquarium Barcelona, containing 8,000 fish and 11 sharks contained in 22 basins filled with 4 million litres of sea water. The Maremagnum, being situated within the confines of the port, is the only commercial mall in the city that can open on Sundays and public holidays. Barcelona is a major hub for the Spanish rail network. The city's main Inter-city rail station is Barcelona Sants railway station, whilst Estació de França terminus serves a secondary role handling suburban, regional and medium distance services. Freight services operate to local industries and to the Port of Barcelona. RENFE's AVE high-speed rail system, which is designed for speeds of 310 km/h (193 mph), was extended from Madrid to Barcelona in 2008 in the form of the Madrid–Barcelona high-speed rail line. A shared RENFE-SNCF high-speed rail connecting Barcelona and France (Paris, Marseilles and Toulouse, through Perpignan–Barcelona high-speed rail line) was launched in 2013. Both these lines serve Barcelona Sants terminal station.[160][161] Barcelona is served by an extensive local public transport network that includes a metro system, a bus network, a regional railway system, trams, funiculars, rack railways, a Gondola lift and aerial cable cars. These networks and lines are run by a number of different operators but they are integrated into a coordinated fare system, administered by the Autoritat del Transport Metropolità (ATM). The system is divided into fare zones (1 to 6) and various Integrated Travel Cards are available.[162] The Barcelona Metro network comprises twelve lines, identified by an \"L\" followed by the line number as well as by individual colours. The Metro largely runs underground; eight Metro lines are operated on dedicated track by the Transports Metropolitans de Barcelona (TMB), whilst four lines are operated by the Ferrocarrils de la Generalitat de Catalunya (FGC) and some of them share tracks with RENFE commuter lines. In addition to the city Metro, several regional rail lines operated by RENFE's Rodalies de Catalunya run across the city, providing connections to outlying towns in the surrounding region. The city's two modern tram systems, Trambaix and Trambesòs, are operated by TRAMMET.[163] A heritage tram line, the Tramvia Blau, also operates between the metro Line 7 and the Funicular del Tibidabo.[164] Barcelona's metro and rail system is supplemented by several aerial cable cars, funiculars and rack railways that provide connections to mountain-top stations. FGC operates the Funicular de Tibidabo up the hill of Tibidabo and the Funicular de Vallvidrera (FGC), while TMB runs the Funicular de Montjuïc up Montjuïc. The city has two aerial cable cars: the Montjuïc Cable Car, which serves Montjuïc castle, and the Port Vell Aerial Tramway that runs via Torre Jaume I and Torre Sant Sebastià over the port. Buses in Barcelona are a major form of public transport, with extensive local, interurban and night bus networks. Most local services are operated by the TMB, although some other services are operated by a number of private companies, albeit still within the ATM fare structure. There are 21 night lines, 19 of them go through Plaça de Catalunya, where you can change to other lines. The frequency is 15/20 minutes between 22:20 and 06:00. A separate private bus line, known as Aerobús, links the airport with the city centre, with its own fare structure. The Estació del Nord (Northern Station), a former railway station which was renovated for the 1992 Olympic Games, now serves as the terminus for long-distance and regional bus services. Barcelona has a metered taxi fleet governed by the Institut Metropolità del Taxi (Metropolitan Taxi Institute), composed of more than 10,000 cars. Most of the licences are in the hands of self-employed drivers. With their black and yellow livery, Barcelona's taxis are easily spotted, and can be caught from one of many taxi ranks, hailed on street, called by telephone or via app.[165][166] On 22 March 2007,[167] Barcelona's City Council started the Bicing service, a bicycle service understood as a public transport. Once the user has their user card, they can take a bicycle from any of the more than 400 stations spread around the city and use it anywhere the urban area of the city, and then leave it at another station.[168] The service has been a success, with 50,000 subscribed users in three months.[169] Barcelona lies on three international routes, including European route E15 that follows the Mediterranean coast, European route E90 to Madrid and Lisbon, and European route E09 to Paris. It is also served by a comprehensive network of motorways and highways throughout the metropolitan area, including A-2, A-7/AP-7, C-16, C-17, C-31, C-32, C-33, C-60. The city is circled by three half ring roads or bypasses, Ronda de Dalt (B-20) (on the mountain side), Ronda del Litoral (B-10) (along the coast) and Ronda del Mig (separated into two parts: Travessera de Dalt in the north and the Gran Via de Carles III), two partially covered[170] fast highways with several exits that bypass the city. The city's main arteries include Diagonal Avenue, which crosses it diagonally, Meridiana Avenue which leads to Glòries and connects with Diagonal Avenue and Gran Via de les Corts Catalanes, which crosses the city from east to west, passing through its centre. The famous boulevard of La Rambla, whilst no longer an important vehicular route, remains an important pedestrian route. The Barri Gòtic (Catalan for \"Gothic Quarter\") is the centre of the old city of Barcelona. Many of the buildings date from medieval times, some from as far back as the Roman settlement of Barcelona. Catalan modernista architecture (related to the movement known as Art Nouveau in the rest of Europe) developed between 1885 and 1950 and left an important legacy in Barcelona. Several of these buildings are World Heritage Sites. Especially remarkable is the work of architect Antoni Gaudí, which can be seen throughout the city. His best-known work is the immense but still unfinished church of the Sagrada Família, which has been under construction since 1882 and is still financed by private donations. As of 2015[update], completion is planned for 2026.[171] Barcelona was also home to Mies van der Rohe's Barcelona Pavilion. Designed in 1929 for the International Exposition for Germany, it was an iconic building that came to symbolize modern architecture as the embodiment of van der Rohe's aphorisms \"less is more\" and \"God is in the details\".[172] The Barcelona pavilion was intended as a temporary structure and was torn down in 1930 less than a year after it was constructed. A modern re-creation by Spanish architects now stands in Barcelona, however, constructed in 1986. Barcelona won the 1999 RIBA Royal Gold Medal for its architecture,[173] the first (and as of 2015[update], only) time that the winner has been a city rather than an individual architect. Barcelona is the home of many points of interest declared World Heritage Sites by UNESCO:[174] Barcelona has a great number of museums, which cover different areas and eras. The National Museum of Art of Catalonia possesses a well-known collection of Romanesque art, while the Barcelona Museum of Contemporary Art focuses on post-1945 Catalan and Spanish art. The Fundació Joan Miró, Picasso Museum, and Fundació Antoni Tàpies hold important collections of these world-renowned artists, as well as the Can Framis Museum, focused on post-1960 Catalan Art owned by Fundació Vila Casas. Several museums cover the fields of history and archaeology, like the Barcelona City History Museum (MUHBA), the Museum of the History of Catalonia, the Archeology Museum of Catalonia, the Maritime Museum of Barcelona, the Music Museum of Barcelona and the privately owned Egyptian Museum. The Erotic museum of Barcelona is among the most peculiar ones, while CosmoCaixa is a science museum that received the European Museum of the Year Award in 2006.[175] The Museum of Natural Sciences of Barcelona was founded in 1882 under the name of \"Museo Martorell de Arqueología y Ciencias Naturales\"[176][177] (Spanish for \"Martorell Museum of Archaeology and Natural Sciences\"). In 2011 the Museum of Natural Sciences ended up with a merge of five institutions: the Museum of Natural Sciences of Barcelona (the main site, at the Forum Building), the Martorell Museum (the historical seat of the Museum, opened to the public from 1924 to 2010 as a geology museum), the Laboratori de Natura, at the Castle of the Three Dragons (from 1920 to 2010: the Zoology Museum), the Historical Botanical Garden of Barcelona, founded 1930, and the Botanical garden of Barcelona, founded 1999. Those two gardens are a part of the Botanical Institute of Barcelona too. The FC Barcelona Museum is the third most popular tourist attraction in Catalonia, with 1,51 million visitors in 2013.[178] Barcelona contains sixty municipal parks, twelve of which are historic, five of which are thematic (botanical), forty-five of which are urban, and six of which are forest.[179] They range from vest-pocket parks to large recreation areas. The urban parks alone cover 10% of the city (549.7 ha or 1,358.3 acres).[74] The total park surface grows about 10 ha (25 acres) per year,[180] with a proportion of 18.1 m2 (195 sq ft) of park area per inhabitant.[181] Of Barcelona's parks, Montjuïc is the largest, with 203 ha located on the mountain of the same name, and includes the Botanical Garden of Barcelona, the Mossèn Costa i Llobera Gardens, and more.[74] It is followed by Parc de la Ciutadella (which occupies the site of the old citadel and which houses the Parliament building, the Barcelona Zoo, and several museums); 31 ha or 76.6 acres including the zoo), the Guinardó Park (19 ha or 47.0 acres), Park Güell (designed by Antoni Gaudí; 17.2 ha or 42.5 acres), Oreneta Castle Park (also 17.2 ha or 42.5 acres), Diagonal Mar Park (13.3 ha or 32.9 acres, inaugurated in 2002), Nou Barris Central Park (13.2 ha or 32.6 acres), Can Dragó Sports Park and Poblenou Park (both 11.9 ha or 29.4 acres), the Labyrinth Park (9.10 ha or 22.5 acres), named after the garden maze it contains.[74] There are also several smaller parks, for example, the Parc de Les Aigües (2 ha or 4.9 acres). A part of the Collserola Park is also within the city limits. PortAventura World, one of the largest resort in Europe, with 5,837,509 visitors per year, is located one hour's drive from Barcelona.[182][183] Also, within the city lies Tibidabo Amusement Park, a smaller amusement park in Plaza del Tibidabo, with the Muntanya Russa amusement ride. Barcelona beach was listed as number one in a list of the top ten city beaches in the world according to National Geographic[116] and Discovery Channel.[184] Barcelona contains seven beaches, totalling 4.5 km (2+3⁄4 mi) of coastline. Sant Sebastià, Barceloneta and Somorrostro beaches, both 1,100 m (3,610 ft) in length,[74] are the largest, oldest and the most-frequented beaches in Barcelona. The Olympic Harbour separates them from the other city beaches: Nova Icària, Bogatell, Mar Bella, Nova Mar Bella and Llevant. These beaches (ranging from 400 to 640 m (1,310 to 2,100 ft) were opened as a result of the city restructuring to host the 1992 Summer Olympics, when a great number of industrial buildings were demolished. At present, the beach sand is artificially replenished given that storms regularly remove large quantities of material. The 2004 Universal Forum of Cultures left the city a large concrete bathing zone on the eastmost part of the city's coastline. Most recently, Llevant is the first beach to allow dogs access during summer season. Barcelona is twinned with:[185] Barcelona also cooperates with:[185]",

                "title": "Patrick Mahomes - Wikipedia",
                "content": "Patrick Lavon Mahomes II[5] (/məˈhoʊmz/;[6] born September 17, 1995) is an American professional football quarterback for the Kansas City Chiefs of the National Football League (NFL). Mahomes has led the Chiefs to six consecutive AFC Championship Game appearances and four Super Bowl appearances since becoming the team's starting quarterback in 2018. He is one of five quarterbacks in NFL history to win three or more Super Bowls as a starter.[7][8] Mahomes's career accolades through seven seasons in the NFL have earned him widespread praise from sports journalists, and he is considered to be one of the greatest quarterbacks of all time.[9][10][11] Mahomes played college football and baseball for the Texas Tech Red Raiders. Following his sophomore year, he quit baseball to focus solely on football.[12] In his junior year, he led all NCAA Division I FBS players in multiple categories including passing yards (5,052) and total touchdowns (53). He was selected 10th overall by the Kansas City Chiefs in the 2017 NFL draft. Mahomes spent his rookie season as the backup to Alex Smith. He was named the starter in 2018 after the Chiefs traded Smith to the Washington Redskins. That season, Mahomes threw for 5,097 yards, 50 touchdowns, and 12 interceptions. He became the only quarterback in history to throw for more than 5,000 yards in a single season in both college and in the NFL. He joined Peyton Manning as the only players in NFL history to throw for 5,000 yards and 50 passing touchdowns in the same season.[13] For his performance in his first season as starter, he was named to the Pro Bowl, named first-team All-Pro, and won the NFL Offensive Player of the Year and NFL Most Valuable Player awards. Mahomes is one of four black quarterbacks to win the AP MVP award.[a][14] In the 2019 season, Mahomes led the Chiefs to Super Bowl LIV, their first Super Bowl appearance in 50 years, where they defeated the San Francisco 49ers.[15] Mahomes was awarded the Super Bowl MVP for his performance, the second black quarterback and youngest overall to do so.[b][16] He is also the third African American quarterback to win a Super Bowl.[c] In 2020, Mahomes signed a 10-year contract extension worth $477 million with another $26 million in potential bonuses, for a total of $503 million, making it the fourth-largest known contract in sporting history.[18][19] The year after signing his contract, he led the Chiefs to their second consecutive Super Bowl appearance, but they lost to the Tampa Bay Buccaneers in Super Bowl LV. In the 2022 season, Mahomes won his second career NFL MVP and his second Super Bowl MVP in Super Bowl LVII over the Philadelphia Eagles, becoming the first player to win NFL MVP and Super Bowl MVP in the same year since Kurt Warner in 1999, and joined Tom Brady and Joe Montana as the only quarterbacks to win multiple regular season and Super Bowl MVPs.[20][21] In the 2023 season, he won his third Super Bowl MVP after the Chiefs defeated the 49ers in Super Bowl LVIII. Mahomes was born on September 17, 1995, in Tyler, Texas.[22] His father is Pat Mahomes, a former Major League Baseball (MLB) pitcher,[23] and his mother is Randi Martin.[24] Mahomes has a younger brother, Jackson, who is a social media influencer.[25][26][27] Mahomes's parents divorced in 2006.[24] His half-brother through his father, Graham Walker, plays football at Brown.[28] He is also the godson of former MLB pitcher LaTroy Hawkins, who was his father's teammate on the Minnesota Twins.[29] Mahomes is biracial,[30] as his father is black[31] and his mother is white.[30] Mahomes attended Whitehouse High School in Whitehouse, Texas.[32] He played football, baseball, and basketball.[33] Mahomes believes that training in pitching and playing basketball improved his quarterback skills.[34] In football, he had 4,619 passing yards, 50 passing touchdowns, 948 rushing yards, and 15 rushing touchdowns as a senior in high school. In baseball, he threw a no-hitter with 16 strikeouts in a game his senior year.[35] He was named the Maxpreps Male Athlete of the Year for 2013–2014.[36] Mahomes was rated by Rivals.com as a three-star football recruit and was ranked as the 12th best dual-threat quarterback in his class. He received offers from Texas Tech, Rice, and Houston.[37] He committed to Texas Tech University.[38] Mahomes was also a top prospect for the 2014 Major League Baseball draft, but was not expected to be selected high due to his commitment to Texas Tech.[39][40][41] He was selected by the Detroit Tigers in the 37th round of the 2014 MLB draft, but did not sign a contract.[42] Mahomes entered his freshman season at Texas Tech as a backup to Davis Webb.[43] He saw his first career action against the Oklahoma State Cowboys after Webb left the game with an injury, completing two of five passes for 20 yards for one touchdown and an interception.[44] After Webb was again injured, Mahomes started his first career game against the Texas Longhorns.[45] He completed 13 of 21 passes for 109 yards in the 34–13 loss.[46][47] Mahomes remained the starter for the season's final three games. Against the Baylor Bears, he threw for a Big 12 freshman record 598 yards with six touchdowns and one interception in the 48–46 loss.[48] For the season, he passed for 1,547 yards, 16 touchdowns, and four interceptions in seven games.[49] Mahomes split time with the Texas Tech baseball team, where he was a relief pitcher.[50][51] Mahomes began his sophomore season at Texas Tech as the starting quarterback. Mahomes helped lead the Red Raiders to a 7–6 season with numerous productive outings throughout the season.[52] He recorded ten games going over 350 passing yards, including four games going over 400. He passed for at least three touchdowns in eight of the games, including a five-touchdown performance against the Iowa State Cyclones on October 10.[53] Overall, in the 2015 season, he led the Big 12 Conference with 364 pass completions on 573 attempts for 4,653 yards, 36 touchdowns, and 15 interceptions.[54][55] Mahomes appeared in three games as a baseball player, recording no hits in two at bats, and three runs allowed, as a pitcher.[56] Prior to the start of the 2016 season, Mahomes announced that he was leaving baseball to focus on football.[50] Mahomes had a very productive junior season. In the month of September alone, Mahomes passed for 18 touchdowns to three interceptions while rushing for four touchdowns. He averaged 442.5 passing yards per game that month, which included a 540-yard game against the Arizona State Sun Devils in the Red Raiders' second game.[57] Mahomes started the month of October with 504 passing yards, two passing touchdowns, and three rushing touchdowns in a losing effort to the Kansas State Wildcats.[58] On October 22, Mahomes set multiple NCAA, Big 12, and school records in a 66–59 loss to the Oklahoma Sooners at home. Mahomes broke the NCAA FBS records for single-game total offense with 819 yards. He tied the NCAA record for single game passing yards with 734. He fell one short of the record for most attempts at 88. Overall, the game set NCAA records for most combined yards of total offense with 1,708 combined passing yards, and total offense by two players (the other was Oklahoma quarterback Baker Mayfield).[59] The 125 combined points are the second most all time involving ranked teams.[59] Following the Oklahoma game, the Red Raiders defeated the TCU Horned Frogs before dropping three consecutive games to finish outside bowl eligibility with a 5–7 record. In his final game with Texas Tech, Mahomes finished with 586 passing yards and six touchdowns in a 54–35 victory over the Baylor Bears.[60] Mahomes finished the season leading the country in yards per game (421), passing yards (5,052), total offense (5,312), points responsible for (318), and total touchdowns (53).[61] For his performance, he was awarded the Sammy Baugh Trophy, given annually to the nation's top college passer, joining head coach Kliff Kingsbury, Graham Harrell, and B. J. Symons as other Red Raiders to have won the award.[62] He was named an Academic All-America second team by the College Sports Information Directors of America.[63] Mahomes announced on January 3, 2017, that he would forgo his last year of college eligibility and enter the NFL draft.[64] Mahomes was projected to be a first or second round pick by the majority of analysts and scouts.[65] During the throwing drills at the NFL Scouting Combine, his passes were clocked at 60 mph, tying Logan Thomas and Bryan Bennett for the fastest pass ever recorded there.[66] Mahomes was ranked second best quarterback by SI.com,[67] third by ESPN,[68] and fourth by NFLDraftScout.com.[69] Representatives from 28 NFL teams attended his pro day at Texas Tech. He became one of the fastest rising prospects during the draft process and had 18 private workouts and official team visits, the most for any prospect in 2017.[70] Among the coaches that he had workouts and visits with were the Arizona Cardinals head coach Bruce Arians, New Orleans Saints head coach Sean Payton, Cincinnati Bengals quarterbacks coach Bill Lazor, and coaches from the Los Angeles Chargers, Cleveland Browns, Chicago Bears, and Pittsburgh Steelers.[71] The Kansas City Chiefs selected Mahomes in the first round (10th overall) of the 2017 NFL draft.[74] The Chiefs, originally slated to have the 27th overall selection, traded up in the draft with the Buffalo Bills for the 10th overall selection. The Chiefs traded their first round pick and a third round pick in 2017, and the Chiefs' first round pick in the 2018 NFL draft for the selection.[75] He was the first quarterback selected by the Chiefs in the first round since selecting Todd Blackledge seventh overall in the 1983 NFL draft.[76] On July 20, 2017, the Chiefs signed Mahomes to a guaranteed four-year, $16.42 million contract that included a signing bonus of $10.08 million.[77] The Chiefs announced on December 27 that, with a playoff spot and the fourth seed in the playoffs secured, they would rest starter Alex Smith and give Mahomes his first career start in their week 17 game against the Denver Broncos.[78] Mahomes played most of the game and helped lead the Chiefs to a 27–24 win, completing 22 of 35 passes for 284 yards and one interception.[79][80] On January 30, 2018, the Chiefs announced they had agreed to trade Smith to the Washington Redskins, elevating Mahomes as starting quarterback.[81] In his first game as the Chiefs starting quarterback, the Chiefs beat the division rival Los Angeles Chargers by a score of 38–28.[82] Mahomes threw for 256 yards and four touchdowns with no interceptions and a 127.5 passer rating and was named AFC Offensive Player of the Week.[83] His first career touchdown came on a 58-yard pass to wide receiver Tyreek Hill in the first quarter.[84] The following week against the Pittsburgh Steelers, Mahomes threw for 326 yards, six touchdowns, no interceptions, and a passer rating of 154.8 in the 42–37 victory. After throwing his fifth touchdown in the game, he broke the NFL record for most touchdown passes in a quarterback's first three career games. His sixth touchdown pass broke the NFL record for touchdown passes in a season's first two weeks.[85] For his performance against the Steelers, Mahomes won his second consecutive AFC Offensive Player of the Week award, the first quarterback since Tom Brady in 2011 to start the season with back-to-back player of the week awards.[86] Mahomes was named AFC Offensive Player of the Month for September.[87] In week 4, against the Denver Broncos on Monday Night Football, he passed for 304 yards and a touchdown and had one rushing touchdown in the 27–23 comeback victory.[88] In week 6, against the New England Patriots, he passed for 352 yards, four touchdowns, and two interceptions in a 43–40 loss on Sunday Night Football.[89] In the following game, Mahomes and the Chiefs bounced back with a 45–10 victory over the Cincinnati Bengals. In the victory, he passed for 358 yards, four touchdowns, and one interception.[90] In the next game, a 30–23 win over the Broncos, Mahomes recorded a third consecutive game with four passing touchdowns on 303 passing yards and one interception.[91] During Monday Night Football against the Los Angeles Rams in week 11, Mahomes finished with 478 passing yards, six touchdowns, and three interceptions as the Chiefs lost 54–51.[92] His 478 passing yards were the most for a single game by any quarterback for the 2018 season.[93] Following an 89-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Demarcus Robinson in a week 17 game against the Oakland Raiders, Mahomes became the second quarterback in NFL history to throw for 5,000 yards and 50 touchdowns.[94] Additionally, he became one of seven players in NFL history with 5,000 passing yards in a season.[95] He finished second in passing yards to Ben Roethlisberger.[96] He became the first Chief since Len Dawson in 1966 to lead the league in passing touchdowns.[13] He helped lead the Chiefs to a 12–4 record and their third straight division title.[97] On January 12, 2019, the Chiefs defeated the Indianapolis Colts 31–13 in the Divisional Round, giving the Chiefs their first home playoff win since the 1993 season.[98] Mahomes threw for 278 yards with no interceptions and rushed for one touchdown.[99] The win allowed the Chiefs to host the first AFC Championship held at Arrowhead Stadium. Mahomes passed for 295 yards and three touchdowns, but the Chiefs lost to the Patriots in overtime 37–31.[100] Mahomes' performance for the season earned multiple awards. He was named to the 2019 Pro Bowl, he was named First Team All–Pro,[101] 2019 Best NFL Player ESPY Award, and was named Kansas City Club 101 Awards AFC Offensive Player of the Year.[102] He was also named the NFL MVP, the first winner for the Chiefs in franchise history.[103] He was ranked as the fourth-best player by his peers on the NFL Top 100 Players of 2019.[104] Playing against the Jacksonville Jaguars in the season opener, Mahomes threw for 378 yards and three touchdowns despite star receiver Tyreek Hill's injury in the first quarter and Mahomes' second quarter ankle sprain.[105] In week 2 against the Oakland Raiders, Mahomes threw for 278 yards and four touchdowns in the second quarter alone, the most passing yards in any quarter since 2008. Mahomes finished the game with 443 yards[106] and was named AFC Offensive Player of the Week.[107] For the second consecutive season, Mahomes was named AFC Offensive Player of the Month for September after leading the Chiefs to a 4–0 start (10 passing touchdowns with no interceptions).[108] Mahomes dislocated his patella in week 7 against the Denver Broncos.[109] The following day, an MRI revealed no significant structural damage. He was initially expected to miss at least three weeks.[110] He returned two weeks later against the Tennessee Titans, throwing for 446 yards and three touchdowns, losing 35–32.[111] Mahomes ran for a career-high 59 yards, but threw for a career-low (for games he finished) 182 yards in the Chiefs' week 11 victory over the Los Angeles Chargers.[112] In a week 16 win over the Chicago Bears on Sunday Night Football, Mahomes celebrated by counting to 10 on his fingers, alluding to the fact that he was the 10th overall pick in the 2017 draft and that the Bears could have drafted him with the second pick instead of Mitchell Trubisky.[113] He finished the season with 4,031 yards and 26 touchdowns with only five interceptions.[114] He helped lead the Chiefs to their second consecutive 12–4 record and first round bye, as well as their fourth consecutive division title.[115] He was selected to the 2020 Pro Bowl, though he did not play due to his participation in Super Bowl LIV.[116] In the Divisional Round against the Houston Texans, the Chiefs faced a 24–0 deficit early in the second quarter. The Chiefs then went on a 51–7 run, including 41 unanswered points, to win 51–31. Mahomes threw for 321 yards and five touchdowns and rushed for 53 yards.[117] In their second AFC Championship, facing the Titans, Mahomes threw for three touchdowns and rushed for a 27-yard touchdown, the second longest run of his career and longest in the playoffs. He sparked a comeback from 17–7 in the second quarter to a 35–24 victory.[118] The Chiefs made their first Super Bowl appearance since Super Bowl IV in 1970.[118] In Super Bowl LIV, the Chiefs trailed 20–10 against the San Francisco 49ers in the fourth quarter with 8:53 remaining. It was their third straight game facing a 10+ point deficit. With just over 7 minutes to play, a successful 49ers challenge of a completed catch left the Chiefs facing 3rd and 15 on their own 35-yard-line. Mahomes asked his coaching staff to call the play Jet Chip Wasp, and successfully completed a deep pass to Tyreek Hill for 44 yards. This shifted momentum towards the Chiefs, who in the remaining minutes of the game went on a 21–0 run, securing their first Super Bowl victory in 50 years. Mahomes threw for 286 yards and two touchdowns, with two interceptions, and rushed for another 29 yards and touchdown run and was named Super Bowl MVP.[119] He was the youngest quarterback and third-youngest player in NFL history to earn the award.[120] He was ranked fourth by his fellow players on the NFL Top 100 Players of 2020.[121] On April 30, 2020, the Chiefs picked up the fifth-year option on Mahomes' contract.[122] On July 6, he signed a ten-year extension worth $477 million with another $26 million in potential bonuses for a total of $503 million. The contract extends through the 2031 season.[18] The contract is currently the fourth–largest contract in American professional sports history, surpassing Mike Trout's 12-year, $426.5 million contract with the Los Angeles Angels.[123] Mahomes became the first professional athlete to have a half-billion dollar contract.[124] Soccer players Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo and baseball player Shohei Ohtani have since surpassed the contract amount.[125][126] In the Chiefs' week 2 win over the Los Angeles Chargers, Mahomes achieved his fourth fourth-quarter comeback. The Chiefs trailed 17–9 entering the fourth quarter before winning in overtime 23–20. The comeback was the NFL record sixth time he overcame a 10+ point deficit to win.[127] In a week 3 win over the Baltimore Ravens, he threw for 385 passing yards, passing for four touchdowns and rushing for one. In the game, he became the fastest quarterback to surpass 10,000 career yards. It took him 34 games to eclipse Kurt Warner's mark.[128] He was named AFC Offensive Player of the Week.[129] In week 8, he threw for 416 yards and five touchdowns in a 35–9 victory against the New York Jets.[130] Mahomes was again named AFC Offensive Player of the Week.[131] In a week 9 victory over the Carolina Panthers, he threw for 372 passing yards and four touchdowns.[132] In week 12 against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, Mahomes led the Chiefs to a 27–24 victory while throwing for 462 yards and three touchdowns.[133] Mahomes was named AFC Offensive Player of the Month for November.[134] In 2020, Sports Illustrated named him one of their Sportspeople of the Year for his activism following the murder of George Floyd and his encouragement for people to vote in the 2020 presidential election.[135] In week 14, against the Miami Dolphins, he tied a career high with three interceptions.[136] Mahomes rested for week 17 after the Chiefs locked up home-field advantage throughout the playoffs.[137] Mahomes finished the 2020 season with 4,740 passing yards, 38 touchdowns and six interceptions.[138] He was named to the Pro Bowl for his accomplishments in the 2020 season.[139] In the Divisional Round against the Cleveland Browns, Mahomes left the game in the third quarter after being tackled by Browns linebacker Mack Wilson. He was diagnosed with a concussion, and as per NFL rules he was unable to return.[140] The Chiefs would win the game 22–17 with backup quarterback Chad Henne. Later that week, Mahomes announced in a press conference that he had cleared concussion protocol, saying, \"Everything has been good. I went through everything; three or four different doctors have said everything is looking good.'\"[141] In the AFC Championship in a highly anticipated matchup against the Buffalo Bills and their dual-threat quarterback Josh Allen, Mahomes threw for 325 yards and three touchdowns,[142] while leading the Chiefs to a 38–24 victory and their second consecutive Super Bowl appearance. Mahomes became the youngest quarterback to start in three straight AFC Championships.[143] The Chiefs hosted the conference championship game for the NFL-record-tying third consecutive year, the other instance was during Andy Reid's tenure with the Philadelphia Eagles.[144] In Super Bowl LV against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, Mahomes threw for 270 yards and two interceptions in the game as the Chiefs lost 31–9. It was his first double-digit loss in the NFL, and also the first time since he became the Chiefs starting quarterback that the offense did not score any touchdowns.[145] The Buccaneers defense used two deep safeties to neutralize Mahomes' wide receiver targets.[146] The Chiefs' injury-ravaged offensive line was no match for the Buccaneers' pass rush defense, as Mahomes was pressured on a Super Bowl record 29 of 56 dropbacks while also being sacked three times and hit twice.[147][148] Despite the pressure, Mahomes still managed to throw several long accurate passes that were dropped by their intended targets resulting in incompletions: one fourth-quarter highlight showed Mahomes throwing a sidearm pass, despite being tripped by Buccaneers defensive end William Gholston, that ultimately hit the facemask of receiver Darrel Williams and was dropped.[149] Three days after the Super Bowl, Mahomes underwent surgery to repair a turf toe injury he suffered in the divisional round game against the Browns.[150] He was named as the top-ranked player in the NFL by his peers on the NFL Top 100 Players of 2021.[151] On March 12, 2021, Mahomes restructured his contract to save the Chiefs $17 million in salary cap space.[152] In week 1, Mahomes had three passing touchdowns, one rushing touchdown, and 337 yards in a 33–29 win over the Cleveland Browns, earning AFC Offensive Player of the Week.[153] In the Chiefs' week 2 loss to the Baltimore Ravens, he threw his first interception in the month of September of his career. The 36–35 setback marked Mahomes' first loss in the month of September in his career.[154] In a week 5 loss to the Buffalo Bills, Mahomes set career highs for rushing yards with 61 and passing attempts with 54. The 38–20 loss was only his second loss by double digits in his career and his first in the regular season.[155] Two weeks later, the Chiefs lost to the Tennessee Titans 27–3. The Chiefs' three points were the fewest points a Mahomes-led team scored since he became the starter. It was his sixth consecutive game with an interception, the longest streak of his career. He had two fumbles in the second half which gave him the most turnovers he has had in a season only seven games into the season.[156] In the Chiefs' week 9 victory over the Green Bay Packers, Mahomes threw for 166 yards, which was a career low in games he finished. By not throwing an interception for the first time since week 1, he ended a career worst streak of six consecutive games throwing an interception.[157] Mahomes bounced back the following week in a 41–14 victory over the Las Vegas Raiders, where he threw for 406 yards and five touchdowns, an NFL record-tying third game throwing for at least 400 yards and five touchdowns. He joined Pro Football Hall of Fame quarterbacks Joe Montana, Dan Marino, and Peyton Manning as quarterbacks that accomplished the feat.[158] In the Chiefs' week 15 win over the Los Angeles Chargers, he threw for 410 yards and three touchdowns, including the game winning 34-yard touchdown pass in overtime to Travis Kelce.[159] It was his seventh 400-yard game of his career. He finished the regular season with 4,839 yards, 37 touchdowns, 13 interceptions (a career high), and a 98.5 quarterback rating (a career low for a full season).[160] The Chiefs finished the season 12–5, as well as securing their sixth consecutive AFC West title.[161] He earned a Pro Bowl nomination for the 2021 season.[162] The Chiefs hosted the Pittsburgh Steelers in the Wild Card Round, the first time he participated at that stage of the playoffs. Mahomes threw for 404 yards, five touchdowns, and an interception in the 42–21 win.[163] His 404 passing yards set a franchise record for passing yards in a playoff game.[164] In the Divisional Round against the Bills, Mahomes recorded 378 passing yards and three passing touchdowns to go along with 69 rushing yards and a rushing touchdown during the 42–36 overtime win.[165] In the final seconds of regulation, Andy Reid gave Mahomes a motivational talk and told him to be \"The Grim Reaper\".[166] After the two-minute warning and in overtime alone, he threw for 177 yards.[167][168] The game was immediately regarded as one of the greatest playoff games of all time.[169][170][171] In the AFC Championship Game against the Cincinnati Bengals, Mahomes threw for 275 yards and three touchdowns, but also threw two interceptions, including one in overtime in the 27–24 loss.[172] He was ranked eighth by his fellow players on the NFL Top 100 Players of 2022.[173] In Week 1 against the Arizona Cardinals, Mahomes threw for 360 yards and five touchdowns in the Chiefs' 44–21 victory, his sixth 5+ touchdown game. He also had a quarterback rating of 144.2, the 3rd highest of his career and his best since 2020.[174] He was named AFC Offensive Player of the Week for his Week 1 performance.[175] In Week 4, Mahomes threw for 249 yards and three touchdowns in a 41–31 win over the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, earning his second AFC Offensive Player of the Week honors of the season.[176] In Week 7 against the San Francisco 49ers, Mahomes threw for 423 yards and three touchdowns in the 44–23 victory, his seventh career 400-yard game.[177] In Week 8 against the Tennessee Titans, Mahomes set single-game franchise records for pass completions (43)[178] and pass attempts (68) in a single game.[179] In that game, which was only his 71st career start, he broke the NFL record for passing yards in a quarterback's first 75 career starts with 21,596.[180] The following week, his 72nd start, he would break the record for passing touchdowns in a quarterback's first 75 starts with 176.[181] Mahomes was named AFC Offensive Player of the Month for November.[182] In the Chiefs' week 15 game against the Houston Texans, Mahomes ran for his 12th career rushing touchdown, setting a franchise record for rushing touchdowns by a quarterback.[183] He was named to his fifth Pro Bowl for the season.[184] Mahomes reached 5,000 passing yards on the season in a Week 17 win against the Denver Broncos for the second time in his career.[185] He set the NFL record for most total yards in a season by a quarterback (combined passing and rushing) with 5,608.[186] He also broke his own Chiefs' franchise record for passing yards in a season with 5,250.[187] With the number 1 seed in the AFC, the Chiefs earned a bye week in the first round of the playoffs.[188] In the Chiefs' Divisional Round victory over the Jacksonville Jaguars, a high ankle sprain sidelined Mahomes for much of the first half, but he returned to the game in the second half helping lead the Chiefs to victory.[189] In the AFC Championship game, the Chiefs defeated the Cincinnati Bengals, ending a three-game losing streak (including playoffs) to the team, to advance to their third Super Bowl in four seasons.[190] Against the Philadelphia Eagles in Super Bowl LVII, Mahomes re-aggravated his ankle late in the second quarter as the Chiefs went into halftime trailing by 10. However, Mahomes stayed in the game and led Kansas City to a touchdown on their first three drives of the second half, leading the Chiefs to a 38–35 win over the Eagles.[191] He was awarded his second career Super Bowl MVP for his efforts. Mahomes also finished the season as the Most Valuable Player, and was the league leader in both passing yards and passing touchdowns, becoming the first player in NFL history to achieve all four feats in a season.[192] Mahomes was ranked as the top player in the NFL by his peers on the NFL Top 100 Players of 2023.[193] On September 18, 2023, the Chiefs and Mahomes agreed to restructure his contract, giving him $210.6 million between 2023 and 2026, the most money in NFL history over a four-season span.[194] In Week 4 against the Jets, Mahomes passed for his 200th career touchdown, becoming the fastest player in NFL history to reach that milestone, having done so in just his 84th start. His 51 rushing yards in the game also allowed him to break Alex Smith's franchise record for most career rushing yards by a quarterback.[195] After defeating the Minnesota Vikings in Week 5, Mahomes became the youngest quarterback in NFL history to defeat all other 31 teams besides their own.[196] In Week 12, Mahomes was 27-of-34 for 298 yards and two touchdowns to overcome a 14-point deficit in a 31–17 win over the Las Vegas Raiders, earning AFC Offensive Player of the Week.[197] Despite meeting these milestones, Mahomes had his worst statistical season to that point in several categories, including yards per attempt (7.0), passing yards per game (261.4), interceptions (14), and passer rating (92.6).[198][199] His receivers struggled at several points throughout the season;[200] going into Week 18, they led the league in dropped passes. Despite this, Mahomes set a career-high in completion percentage with 67.2%.[201] Mahomes was notably fined $50,000 for publicly criticizing the referees of the Chiefs' game against the Buffalo Bills, in which they lost 20–17 after a go-ahead touchdown by receiver Kadarius Toney was negated due to Toney lining up offsides.[202] Mahomes ranted as he greeted Josh Allen after the game, saying \"Fucking terrible. Fucking worst call I've ever fucking seen.\"[203] In spite of these struggles, the Chiefs once again won the division, resulting in Mahomes and several other starters resting in the final game of the season.[204] The Chiefs' playoff run began with a commanding 26–7 win over the Miami Dolphins at home in subzero temperatures in the wild card round.[205] The next week, Mahomes played his first career road playoff game, scoring a narrow 27–24 win over the Buffalo Bills in the divisional round.[206] This win gave the Chiefs their sixth consecutive AFC Championship Game, the second-most consecutive conference championship games for a franchise of all time (the most is held by the New England Patriots with 8).[207] Against the Bills, Mahomes, along with tight end Travis Kelce, broke the record for most career touchdowns in the playoffs for a quarterback/receiver duo.[208] Mahomes then led the Chiefs to a win on the road against the top-seeded Baltimore Ravens in the AFC Championship to advance to Super Bowl LVIII, marking Mahomes' fourth Super Bowl appearance in five seasons.[209] The win marked Mahomes' 14th career playoff win, tying Terry Bradshaw, John Elway, and Peyton Manning for third place in quarterback playoff wins.[210] In the Super Bowl, Mahomes won his third Super Bowl MVP after throwing for 333 yards with two touchdowns, including the game-winning touchdown pass in overtime to Mecole Hardman, as the Chiefs defeated the San Francisco 49ers 25–22 in just the second Super Bowl in history to go to overtime.[211] Kansas City became the first team to repeat as Super Bowl champions since the New England Patriots nineteen years earlier and Mahomes became the third player with three Super Bowl MVPs.[212] With his victory in the Super Bowl, Mahomes earned his 15th postseason victory, moving into sole possession of third-most in NFL history, only behind Joe Montana and Tom Brady.[213] He was ranked fourth by his fellow players on the NFL Top 100 Players of 2024.[214] Mahomes and the Chiefs entered the 2024 season looking to become the first team to win three consecutive Super Bowl championships.[215] In the NFL Kickoff Game against the Ravens, Mahomes passed Len Dawson as the Chiefs' all-time passing yards leader in a 27–20 win.[216] In Week 3, Mahomes won his 77th regular season start in a victory against the Atlanta Falcons. With the win, Mahomes passed Tom Brady and Roger Staubach for most victories by a quarterback through their first 100 starts.[217] In Week 8 against the Las Vegas Raiders, Mahomes reached 30,000 career passing yards, doing so in just 103 regular season games. This was faster than any other quarterback in NFL history, surpassing the previous record of 109 games set by Matthew Stafford.[218] Mahomes helped lead the Chiefs to a 9–0 start, tying the best start to a season in franchise history.[219] In Week 11, the team suffered their first setback with a 30–21 loss to the Buffalo Bills.[220] Both records are Division I-FBS records. NFL College awards Other awards A former baseball pitcher and considered by some a dual-threat quarterback and the \"most talented player in the NFL\" due to his elusiveness in the pocket, arm strength, running ability, and athleticism despite being a pass-first quarterback,[241][242] Mahomes is also known for attempting and completing innovative throws, including no-look passes and behind-the-back tosses.[243] FiveThirtyEight also cites his unique and \"uncanny\" ability to know his receivers' timing and use his athleticism to fool defenders and get his receivers open.[241] Mahomes credits his years playing baseball with developing his arm strength while throwing the football.[244] Ahead of Super Bowl LVII, which was the first Super Bowl to feature two black starting quarterbacks as the Chiefs faced off against Jalen Hurts and the Philadelphia Eagles, Mahomes acknowledged that his creative playing style was inspired by that of Negro league baseball players, especially Satchel Paige, who likewise inspired his father's baseball playing style.[243] A number of defensive coordinators have cited Mahomes' ability to improvise as one of his key skills.[245] Since Mahomes' breakout 2018 season, NFL general managers and scouts have sought out prospects that can break out of designed plays. Number one overall draft picks Kyler Murray and Bryce Young are regarded as examples of this effect, with the two being highly touted prospects despite lacking traditional size for the position.[246] On September 1, 2020, Mahomes proposed to Brittany Matthews, his high school sweetheart, in a suite in Arrowhead Stadium, the day Mahomes received his Super Bowl LIV championship ring.[247] Matthews had a brief professional soccer career playing for Icelandic club UMF Afturelding and then became a certified personal trainer.[248] She is also a co-owner of the Kansas City Current, a women's professional soccer team.[249] The couple married on March 12, 2022.[250] They have two children: a daughter[251] and a son.[252] In July 2024, the couple announced they were expecting their third child.[253] Mahomes is an evangelical Christian.[254] His mother said he found his faith when he was in middle school, where he was involved with a youth group at his church.[255] Mahomes has said, \"Faith is huge for me ... Before every game, I walk the field and I do a prayer at the goalpost. I just thank God for those opportunities and I thank God for letting me be on a stage where I can glorify Him. The biggest thing that I pray for is that whatever happens, win or lose, success or failure, that I'm glorifying Him.\"[256] Mahomes is featured in the NFL Films and Netflix sports documentary series Quarterback, alongside other NFL quarterbacks Kirk Cousins and Marcus Mariota. All three players were filmed during the 2022 season on-and-off the field. The series premiered on Netflix on July 12, 2023. Mahomes' newly established 2PM Productions collaborated on producing the series.[257][258] Mahomes plays golf during the offseason.[259] He has participated in several celebrity tournaments, including the American Century Championship since 2020.[260] He participated in the 2022 edition of The Match alongside Josh Allen, losing to Tom Brady and Aaron Rodgers.[261] He also participated in the 2023 edition teaming up with his Chiefs teammate Travis Kelce against Golden State Warriors teammates Stephen Curry and Klay Thompson. Mahomes and Kelce won the match.[262] Following his 2018 MVP season, Mahomes received multiple endorsement deals. His first contract came from Hunt's upon revealing his love for ketchup.[263] In addition, he has signed endorsement deals with Oakley,[264] Essentia Water, Hy-Vee,[265] State Farm,[266] DirectTV,[267] Adidas,[268] and Head & Shoulders.[269] He also signed an endorsement contract with Helzberg Diamonds who released a line of necklaces featuring his logo.[270] He was named the cover athlete for Madden NFL 20, becoming the first Chiefs player to be on the cover.[271] He would be named the Madden cover athlete again, along with Tom Brady, two years later for Madden NFL 22. Mahomes and Brady are the first players to be named cover athlete twice.[272] In 2020, he signed an endorsement deal with sports drink maker BioSteel sports drinks.[273] He also became an equity partner in the company.[274] On August 16, 2021, he announced he would be releasing his own signature shoe as part of his endorsement deal with Adidas. The shoe was called the Mahomes 1 Impact FLX and was released on August 23.[275] In 2022, Mahomes appeared in a commercial for Coors Light. NFL rules prohibit players from endorsing alcohol products, so the product in the commercial was a Coors flashlight instead of beer.[276] In 2023, he appeared in commercials for cellphone provider T-Mobile.[277] Also in 2023, he signed an endorsement deal with the beverage manufacturer Prime.[278] In April 2019, Mahomes announced the establishment of a nonprofit organization called the 15 and the Mahomies Foundation.[279] The nonprofit's website states that it is \"dedicated to improving the lives of children\".[280] Following the murder of George Floyd by police officer Derek Chauvin, Mahomes, along with teammate Tyrann Mathieu and several other NFL players, made a video encouraging the NFL to condemn police brutality and violence against black people and to admit it was wrong to silence Colin Kaepernick and Eric Reid for their protests during the playing of the National Anthem.[281] Mahomes and Mathieu started a voter registration project in Kansas City. The project encouraged residents to register to vote in the 2020 presidential election. He worked with the Chiefs to encourage players to vote. He joined LeBron James' Rock the Vote initiative to encourage people to register and vote.[282] Mahomes was named to the Time 100 list of most influential people of 2020,[283] 2023,[284] and 2024.[285] In 2024, Mahomes donated $5 million to his alma mater, Texas Tech, to assist with stadium and football center projects.[286] In 2020, Mahomes joined the Kansas City Royals ownership group as a minority stakeholder.[287] In 2021, he joined Sporting Club, the ownership group of the Major League Soccer franchise Sporting Kansas City.[288] Mahomes is a member of an ownership group of an upcoming professional pickleball team based in Miami, Florida. The ownership group also includes Naomi Osaka, Nick Kyrgios, and Rich Paul.[289] Mahomes joined the ownership group of the NWSL's Kansas City Current in 2023. His wife has been a member of the ownership group since the team was established.[290] In 2023, Mahomes (as well as Travis Kelce) became an investor in the Alpine racing team of Formula One.[291] In 2021, Mahomes became an investor in a group to expand the Whataburger fast food restaurant franchise to Missouri and Kansas. The locations will primarily be in the Kansas City metropolitan area and the Wichita, Kansas metropolitan area, and multiple locations in between the cities.[292] In 2024, Mahomes, along with the rest of the ownership group of the Current, expressed interest in bringing a WNBA expansion franchise to Kansas City. They cited the success of the Current, the WNBA expanding to add teams in San Francisco, Portland, and Toronto by 2026, and the WNBA hoping to have 16 teams by 2028. The bid is likely to have competition from other cities like St. Louis and Philadelphia.[293][294]",

                "content": "The Baltimore Ravens are a professional American football team based in Baltimore. The Ravens compete in the National Football League (NFL) as a member of the American Football Conference (AFC) North division. The team plays its home games at M&T Bank Stadium and is headquartered in Owings Mills, Maryland.[9] The Baltimore Ravens were established in 1996 after Art Modell, then owner of the Cleveland Browns, announced plans in 1995 to relocate the franchise from Cleveland to Baltimore.[10] As part of a settlement between the league and the city of Cleveland, Modell was required to leave the Browns' history, team colors, and records in Cleveland for a replacement team and replacement personnel that would resume play in 1999. In return, he was allowed to take his own personnel and team to Baltimore, where such personnel would form an expansion team. Therefore, the Ravens were the only franchise in any of the major American team sports which did not carry forward the records of the team as it existed prior to its move to a new location (until the Arizona Coyotes relocated to become the Utah Hockey Club in the NHL). The team is owned by Steve Bisciotti and was valued at $4.63 billion in 2023, making them the 28th-most valuable sports franchise globally.[11] The Ravens have been one of the most successful NFL franchises since their inception, compiling a regular season record of 263–197–1 (.572), the second-highest among active franchises.[12] They also own the fourth-highest playoff winning percentage at 17–13 (.567).[12] The team has qualified for the NFL playoffs 15 times since 2000 with two Super Bowl titles (Super Bowl XXXV and Super Bowl XLVII), two AFC Championship titles (2000 and 2012), five AFC Championship game appearances (2000, 2008, 2011, 2012, and 2023), and seven AFC North division titles (2003, 2006, 2011, 2012, 2018, 2019, and 2023). They are one of two teams to be undefeated in multiple Super Bowl appearances, along with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. The Ravens organization was led by general manager Ozzie Newsome from 1996 until his retirement following the 2018 season, and has had three head coaches: Ted Marchibroda, Brian Billick, and since 2008, John Harbaugh. Starting with a record-breaking defensive performance in their 2000 season, the Ravens have established a reputation for strong defensive play throughout team history. Former players such as middle linebacker Ray Lewis, safety Ed Reed, and offensive tackle Jonathan Ogden have been enshrined in the Pro Football Hall of Fame. The name \"Ravens\" was inspired by Edgar Allan Poe's poem The Raven.[4][13] Chosen in a fan contest that drew 33,288 voters, the allusion honors Poe who spent the early part of his career in Baltimore and is buried there.[14] Other names polled included \"Marauders\", \"Americans\", and \"Bombers\", among others.[15] As The Baltimore Sun reported at the time, fans also \"liked the tie-in with the other birds in town, the Orioles, and found it easy to visualize a tough, menacing black bird\".[16] Edgar Allan Poe also had distant relatives who played football for the Princeton Tigers in the 1880s through the early 1900s. These brothers were famous players in the early days of American football. Before the football team, there was the Baltimore Ravens wheelchair basketball team — the original Baltimore Ravens.[17] In 1972, the Ravens wheelchair basketball team was founded by Ralph Smith, long-term resident of Baltimore, second Vice President of the National Wheelchair Basketball Association (NWBA) and Member of the NWBA Hall of Fame.[18] The name \"Ravens\" was inspired by Bob Ardinger, a member of the Ravens wheelchair basketball team. In the 1990s, the naming rights were later sold to the football team when they came to the city and the wheelchair basketball team became known as the Maryland Ravens. After the controversial 1984 relocation of the Colts to Indianapolis, several attempts were made to bring an NFL team back to Baltimore. In 1993, ahead of the 1995 league expansion, the city was considered a favorite, behind only St. Louis, to be granted one of two new franchises.[19] League officials and team owners feared litigation due to conflicts between rival bidding groups if St. Louis was awarded a franchise. In October Charlotte, North Carolina was the first city chosen. Several weeks later, Baltimore's bid for a franchise—dubbed the Baltimore Bombers, in honor of the locally produced Martin B-26 Marauder bomber—had three ownership groups in place[19] and a state financial package which included a proposed $200 million, rent-free stadium and permission to charge up to $80 million in personal seat license fees.[20][21] Baltimore, however, was unexpectedly passed over in favor of Jacksonville, Florida, despite Jacksonville's minor TV market status and that the city had withdrawn from contention in the summer, only to return with then-Commissioner Paul Tagliabue's urging.[19] Although league officials denied that any city had been favored, it was reported that Tagliabue and his longtime friend Washington Redskins owner Jack Kent Cooke had lobbied against Baltimore due to its proximity to Washington, D.C.,[19][21][22] and that Tagliabue had used the initial committee voting system to prevent the entire league ownership from voting on Baltimore's bid.[23] This led to public outrage and The Baltimore Sun describing Tagliabue as having an \"Anybody But Baltimore\" policy.[23] Maryland governor William Donald Schaefer said afterward that Tagliabue had led him on, praising Baltimore and the proposed owners while working behind-the-scenes to oppose Baltimore's bid.[23] By May 1994, Baltimore Orioles owner Peter Angelos had gathered a new group of investors, including author Tom Clancy, to bid on teams whose owners had expressed interest in relocating.[24] Angelos found a potential partner in Georgia Frontiere, who was open to moving the Los Angeles Rams to Baltimore. Jack Kent Cooke opposed the move, intending to build the Redskins' new stadium in Laurel, Maryland, close enough to Baltimore to cool outside interest in bringing in a new franchise.[25] This led to heated arguments between Cooke and Angelos, who accused Cooke of being a \"carpetbagger\".[24] The league eventually persuaded Rams team president John Shaw to relocate to St. Louis instead, leading to a league-wide rumor that Tagliabue was again steering interest away from Baltimore, a claim which Tagliabue denied.[26] In response to anger in Baltimore, including Governor Schaefer's threat to announce over the loudspeakers Tagliabue's exact location in Camden Yards any time he attended a Baltimore Orioles game,[27] Tagliabue remarked of Baltimore's financial package: \"Maybe (Baltimore) can open another museum with that money.\"[21] Following this, Angelos made an unsuccessful $200 million bid to bring the Tampa Bay Buccaneers to Baltimore.[28] Having failed to obtain a franchise via the expansion, the city, despite having \"misgivings\",[21] turned to the possibility of obtaining the Cleveland Browns, whose owner Art Modell was financially struggling and at odds with the city of Cleveland over needed improvements to the team's stadium. Enticed by Baltimore's available funds for a first-class stadium and a promised yearly operating subsidy of $25 million, Modell announced on November 6, 1995, his intention to relocate the team from Cleveland to Baltimore the following year. The resulting controversy ended when representatives of Cleveland and the NFL reached a settlement on February 8, 1996. Tagliabue promised the city of Cleveland that an NFL team would be located in Cleveland, either through relocation or expansion, \"no later than 1999\".[29] Additionally, the agreement stipulated that the Browns' name, colors, uniform design and franchise records would remain in Cleveland. The franchise history includes Browns club records and connections with Pro Football Hall of Fame players. Modell's Baltimore team, while retaining all current player contracts, would, for purposes of team history, appear as an expansion team, a new franchise.[30] Not all players, staff or front office would make the move to Baltimore, however. After relocation, Modell hired Ted Marchibroda as the head coach for his new team in Baltimore.[31] Marchibroda was already well known because of his work as head coach of the Baltimore Colts during the 1970s and the Indianapolis Colts during the early 1990s. Ozzie Newsome, the Browns' tight end for many seasons, joined Modell in Baltimore as director of football operations. He was later promoted to vice-president/general manager. The home stadium for the Ravens first two seasons was Baltimore's Memorial Stadium, previously home to the Baltimore Colts, the Baltimore Orioles, and the Canadian Football League's Baltimore Stallions. The Ravens moved to their own new stadium, now known as M&T Bank Stadium, next to Camden Yards in 1998. In the 1996 NFL draft, the Ravens, with two picks in the first round, drafted offensive tackle Jonathan Ogden at No. 4 overall and linebacker Ray Lewis at No. 26 overall.[32] Both Ogden and Lewis went on to play for the Ravens for their entire professional careers and were both inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame. The 1996 Ravens won their opening game against the Oakland Raiders, but finished the season 4–12 despite receiver Michael Jackson leading the league with 14 touchdown catches. The 1997 Ravens started 3–1. Peter Boulware, a rookie defender from Florida State, recorded 11.5 sacks and was named AFC Defensive Rookie of the Year. The team finished 6–9–1. On October 26, the team made its first trip to Landover, Maryland to play their new regional rivals, the Washington Redskins. The Ravens won the game 20–17. On December 14, 1997, the Ravens played the final professional sporting event at Baltimore's historic Memorial Stadium, winning 21–19 over the Tennessee Oilers. 1998 marked the opening of a new stadium for the Ravens, currently known as M&T Bank Stadium, but originally named \"PSINet Stadium\" after the now-defunct internet service provider which purchased the original naming rights. Quarterback Vinny Testaverde left for the New York Jets before the season, and was replaced by former Indianapolis Colt Jim Harbaugh, and later Eric Zeier. Cornerback Rod Woodson joined the team after a successful stint with the Pittsburgh Steelers, and Priest Holmes started getting the first playing time of his career and ran for 1,000 yards. The Ravens finished 1998 with a 6–10 record. On November 29, the Ravens welcomed the Colts back to Baltimore for the first time in 15 years. Amidst a shower of negative cheers towards the Colts, the Ravens won 38–31. Three consecutive losing seasons under Marchibroda led to a change in the head coach.[33] Brian Billick took over as head coach in 1999.[34] Billick had been offensive coordinator for the record-setting Minnesota Vikings the season before. Quarterback Tony Banks came to Baltimore from the St. Louis Rams and had the best season of his career with 17 touchdown passes and an 81.2 pass rating. He was joined by receiver Qadry Ismail, who posted a 1,000-yard season. The Ravens initially struggled with a record of 4–7 but managed to finish with an 8–8 record.[35] Due to continual financial hardships for the organization, the NFL took an unusual move and directed Modell to initiate the sale of his franchise. On March 27, 2000, NFL owners approved the sale of 49% of the Ravens to Steve Bisciotti. In the deal, Bisciotti had an option to purchase the remaining 51% for $325 million in 2004 from Art Modell. On April 9, 2004, the NFL approved Steve Bisciotti's purchase of the majority stake in the club. Banks shared playing time in the 2000 regular season with Trent Dilfer. Both players put up decent numbers (and a 1,364-yard rushing season by rookie Jamal Lewis helped too) but the defense became the team's hallmark and bailed a struggling offense out in many instances through the season. Ray Lewis was named Defensive Player of the Year. Two of his defensive teammates, Sam Adams and Rod Woodson, made the Pro Bowl. Baltimore's season started strong with a 5–1 record. But the team struggled through mid-season, at one point going five games without scoring an offensive touchdown. The team regrouped and won each of their last seven games, finishing 12–4 and making the playoffs for the first time.[36] During the 2000 season, the Ravens' dominating defense broke a notable NFL record. They held opposing teams to 165 total points, surpassing the 1986 Chicago Bears mark of 187 points for a 16-game season, which at that time was the current NFL record. That record still stands, and the 2000 Ravens remain in the discussion as one of the greatest NFL defenses of all time, most notably alongside the 1985 Chicago Bears defense.[37][38] Since the divisional rival Tennessee Titans had a record of 13–3, the Ravens had to play in the wild card round. They dominated the Denver Broncos 21–3 in their first game.[39] In the divisional playoff, they went on the road to Tennessee. With the score tied 10–10 in the fourth quarter, an Al Del Greco field goal attempt was blocked and returned for a touchdown by Anthony Mitchell, and a Ray Lewis interception return for a score put the game squarely in Baltimore's favor. The 24–10 win put the Ravens in the AFC Championship against the Oakland Raiders.[40] The game was rarely in doubt. Shannon Sharpe's 96-yard touchdown catch early in the second quarter followed by an injury to Raiders quarterback Rich Gannon were crucial as the Ravens won easily, 16–3.[41] Baltimore then went to Tampa for Super Bowl XXXV against the New York Giants. The Ravens' defense carried them to a win. They recorded four sacks and forced five turnovers, one of which was a Kerry Collins interception returned for a touchdown by Duane Starks. The Giants' only score was a Ron Dixon kickoff return for a touchdown; however, the Ravens immediately countered with a touchdown return on the ensuing kickoff by Jermaine Lewis. The Ravens became champions with a 34–7 win.[42] In 2001, the Ravens attempted to defend their title with Elvis Grbac as their new starting quarterback, but a season-ending injury to Jamal Lewis on the first day of training camp and poor offensive performances stymied the team. After a 3–3 start, the Ravens defeated the Minnesota Vikings in the final week to clinch a wild card berth at 10–6. In the first round the Ravens showed flashes of their previous year with a 20–3 win over the Miami Dolphins, in which the team forced three turnovers and out-gained the Dolphins 347 yards to 151.[43] In the divisional playoff the Ravens played the Pittsburgh Steelers. Three interceptions by Grbac ended the Ravens' season, as they lost 27–10.[44] Baltimore ran into salary cap problems entering the 2002 season and was forced to part with a number of impact players. In the NFL Draft, the team selected Ed Reed with the 24th overall pick.[45] Reed would go on to become one of the best safeties in NFL history, making nine Pro Bowls until leaving the Ravens for the Houston Texans in 2013.[46] Despite low expectations, the Ravens stayed somewhat competitive in 2002 until a losing streak in December eliminated any chances of a postseason berth and a 7–9 finish. In 2003, the Ravens drafted their new quarterback, Kyle Boller, but he was injured midway through the season and was replaced by Anthony Wright. Jamal Lewis ran for 2,066 yards (including a then-NFL record 295 yards in one game against the Cleveland Browns on September 14). With a 10–6 record, Baltimore won their first AFC North division title. Their first playoff game, at home against the Tennessee Titans, went back and forth, with the Ravens being held to only 54 yards total rushing. The Titans won 20–17 on a late field goal, and Baltimore's season ended early. Ray Lewis was also named Defensive Player of the year for the second time in his career.[47] In April 2003, Art Modell sold 49% of the team to Steve Bisciotti, a local businessman who had made his fortune in the temporary staffing field. After the season, Art Modell sold his remaining 51% ownership to Bisciotti, ending over 40 years of tenure as an NFL franchise owner. The Ravens did not make the playoffs in 2004 and finished the season with a record of 9–7 with Boller spending the season at QB. They did get good play from veteran corner Deion Sanders and third-year safety Ed Reed, who won the NFL Defensive Player of the Year award. They were also the only team to defeat the 15–1 Pittsburgh Steelers in the regular season. The next off-season, the Ravens looked to augment their receiving corps (which was second-worst in the NFL in 2004) by signing Derrick Mason from the Titans and drafting Oklahoma wide receiver Mark Clayton in the first round of the 2005 NFL draft. However, the Ravens ended their season 6–10. The 2006 Baltimore Ravens season began with the team trying to improve on their 6–10 record of 2005. The Ravens, for the first time in franchise history, started 4–0, under the leadership of former Titans quarterback Steve McNair. In 2006, The Ravens lost two straight games mid-season on offensive troubles, prompting coach Billick to drop their offensive coordinator Jim Fassel in their week seven bye. After the bye, and with Billick calling the offense, Baltimore would record a five-game win streak before losing to the Cincinnati Bengals in week 13. Still ranked second overall to first-place San Diego Chargers, the Ravens continued on. They defeated the Kansas City Chiefs, and held the defending Super Bowl champion Pittsburgh Steelers to only one touchdown at Heinz Field, allowing the Ravens to clinch the AFC North. The Ravens ended the regular season with a franchise-best 13–3 record.[48][49] Baltimore had secured the AFC North title, the No. 2 AFC playoff seed, and clinched a 1st-round bye by season's end. The Ravens were slated to face the Indianapolis Colts in the second round of the playoffs, in the first meeting of the two teams in the playoffs. Many Baltimore and Indianapolis fans saw this historic meeting as a sort of \"Judgment Day\" with the new team of Baltimore facing the old team of Baltimore (the former Baltimore Colts having left Baltimore under questionable circumstances in 1984). Both Indianapolis and Baltimore were held to scoring only field goals as the two defenses slugged it out all over M&T Bank Stadium. McNair threw two costly interceptions, including one at the 1-yard line. The eventual Super Bowl champion Colts won 15–6, ending Baltimore's season.[50] The Ravens hoped to improve upon their 13–3 record but injuries and poor play plagued the team. The Ravens finished the 2007 season in the AFC North cellar with a disappointing 5–11 record.[51] A humiliating 22–16 overtime loss to the previously winless Miami Dolphins on December 16 ultimately led to Billick's dismissal after the end of the regular season.[52] He was replaced by John Harbaugh, the special teams coach of the Philadelphia Eagles and the older brother of former Ravens quarterback Jim Harbaugh (1998).[53] With rookies at head coach (John Harbaugh) and quarterback (Joe Flacco), the Ravens entered the 2008 campaign with much uncertainty.[54] Baltimore smartly recovered in 2008, winning eleven games and achieving a wild card spot in the postseason. On the strength of four interceptions, one resulting in an Ed Reed touchdown, the Ravens began its postseason run by winning a rematch over Miami 27–9 at Dolphin Stadium on January 4, 2009, in a wild-card game.[55] Six days later, they advanced to the AFC Championship Game by avenging a Week 5 loss to the Titans 13–10 at LP Field on a Matt Stover field goal with 53 seconds left in regulation time.[56] The Ravens fell one victory short of Super Bowl XLIII by losing to the Steelers 23–14 at Heinz Field on January 18, 2009.[57] In 2009, the Ravens won their first three games, then lost the next three, including a close match in Minnesota. The rest of the season was an uneven string of wins and losses, which included a home victory over Pittsburgh in overtime followed by a Monday Night loss in Green Bay. That game was notable for the number of penalties committed, costing a total of 310 yards, and almost tying with the record set by Tampa Bay and Seattle in 1976. Afterwards, the Ravens easily crushed the Lions and Bears, giving up less than ten points in both games. The next match was against the Steelers, where Baltimore lost a close one before beating the Raiders to end the season. With a record of 9–7, the team finished second in the division and gained another wild card. Moving into the playoffs, they overwhelmed the Patriots 33–14;[58] nevertheless they did not reach the AFC Championship because they were routed 20–3 by the Colts in the Divisional Round a week later.[59][60] Baltimore managed to beat the Jets 10–9 on the 2010 opener, but then lost a poorly played game against Cincinnati the following week. The Ravens rebounded against the other two division teams, beating Cleveland 24–17 in Week 3 and then. The Ravens scored a fine win (31–17) at home against Denver in Week 5. The Ravens finished the season 12–4, second in the division due to a tiebreaker with Pittsburgh, and earning a wild card spot. Baltimore headed to Kansas City and defeated the Chiefs 30–7, but once again were knocked from the playoffs by Pittsburgh in a hard-fought game 31–24.[61][62][63] The Ravens hosted their arch-enemy in Week 1 of the 2011 season. On a hot, humid day in M&T Bank Stadium, crowd noise and multiple Steelers mistakes allowed Baltimore to crush them with three touchdowns 35–7. The frustrated Pittsburgh players also committed several costly penalties. Thus, the Ravens had gained their first-ever victory over the Steelers with Ben Roethlisberger playing and avenged themselves of repeated regular and postseason losses in the series. But in Week 2, the Ravens collapsed in Tennessee and lost 26–13. They rebounded by routing the Rams in Week 3 and then overpowering the Jets 34–17 in Week 4. Week 5, the Ravens had a bye week, following a game against the Texans. But in Week 7, Baltimore had a stunning MNF upset loss in Jacksonville as they were held to one touchdown in a 12–7 loss. Their final scoring drive failed as Joe Flacco threw an interception in the closing seconds of the game. After beating the Cincinnati Bengals in Week 17 of the regular season, the Ravens advanced to the playoffs as the Number 2 seed in the AFC with a record of 12–4.[64][65] They gained the distinction of AFC North Champions over Pittsburgh (12–4) due to a tie-breaker.[66] Ravens' Lee Evans was stripped of a 14-yard touchdown pass by the Patriots Sterling Moore with 22 seconds left and Ravens kicker Billy Cundiff pushed a 32-yard field goal attempt wide left on fourth down as the Patriots held on to beat the Ravens 23–20 during the AFC championship game and advance to Super Bowl XLVI.[67] The Ravens' attempt to convert Joe Flacco into a pocket passer remained a work in progress as the 2012 season began. Terrell Suggs suffered a tendon injury during an off-season basketball game and was unable to play for at least several weeks.[68] In the opener on September 10, Baltimore routed Cincinnati 44–13. After this easy win, the team headed to Philadelphia, but lost 24–23.[69][70] Returning home for a primetime rematch of the AFC Championship, another bizarre game ensued. New England picked apart the Baltimore defense (which was considerably weakened without Terrell Suggs and some other players lost over the off-season) for the first half. Trouble began early in the game when a streaker ran out onto the field and had to be tackled by security, and accelerated when, at 2:18 in the 4th quarter, the referees made a holding call on RG Marshal Yanda. Enraged fans repeatedly chanted an obscenity at this penalty. The Ravens finally drove downfield and on the last play of the game, Justin Tucker kicked a 27-yard field goal to win the game 31–30, capping off a second intense and controversially officiated game in a row for the Ravens.[71] The Ravens would win the AFC North with a 10–6 record, but finished 4th in the AFC playoff seeding, and thus had to play a wild-card game.[72][73] After defeating the Indianapolis Colts 24–9 at home (the final home game of Ray Lewis), the Ravens traveled to Denver to play against the top-seeded Broncos. In a very back-and-forth contest, the Ravens pulled out a 38–35 victory in two overtimes.[74][75] They then won their 2nd AFC championship by coming back from a 13–7 halftime deficit to defeat the Patriots once again, 28–13.[76] The Ravens played the Super Bowl XLVII against the San Francisco 49ers. Baltimore built a 28–6 lead early in the third quarter before a partial power outage in the Superdome suspended play for 34 minutes (earning the game the added nickname of the Blackout Bowl).[77][78] After play resumed, San Francisco scored 17 unanswered third-quarter points to cut the Ravens' lead, 28–23, and continued to chip away in the fourth quarter. With the Ravens leading late in the game, 34–29, the 49ers advanced to the Baltimore 7-yard line just before the two-minute warning but turned the ball over on downs. The Ravens then took an intentional safety in the waning moments of the game to preserve the victory.[79] Baltimore quarterback Joe Flacco, who completed 22 of 33 passes for 287 yards and three touchdowns, was named Super Bowl MVP.[80][81] Coming off as the defending Super Bowl champions, this was the first year in franchise history for the team without Ray Lewis.[82] The Ravens started out 3–2, and started the 2–0 Houston Texans 14-loss streak by shutting them 30–9 in Week 3. However, the Ravens lost their next 3 games, losing to the Green Bay Packers and Pittsburgh Steelers in last-minute field goals and were shut out in an attempt to tie the game against the Cleveland Browns 24–18. After winning and losing their next game, the Ravens came out 4–6, but managed winning their next four games in dominating the Jets 19–3, a Steelers win 22–20 during Thanksgiving, a booming ending in Baltimore against the Vikings 29–26, and an 18–16 win at Detroit, including Justin Tucker's 61-yard game-winning field goal. The Ravens were 8–6, with the 6th seed, but after losing their next two games, and the San Diego Chargers winning their next two to clinch the 6th seed, the Ravens finished 8–8 and missed the playoffs for the first time since 2007.[83][84] On January 27, 2014, the Ravens hired former Houston Texans head coach Gary Kubiak to be their new offensive coordinator after Jim Caldwell accepted the new available head coaching job with the Detroit Lions.[85] On February 15, 2014, star running back Ray Rice and his fiancée Janay Palmer were arrested and charged with assault after a physical altercation at Revel Casino in Atlantic City, New Jersey. Celebrity news website TMZ posted a video of Rice dragging Palmer's body out of an elevator after apparently knocking her out. For the incident, Rice was initially suspended for the first two games of the 2014 NFL season on July 25, 2014, which led to widespread criticism of the NFL.[86] In Week 1, on September 7, the Baltimore Ravens lost to the Cincinnati Bengals, 23–16. The next day, on September 8, 2014, TMZ released additional footage from an elevator camera showing Rice punching Palmer. The Baltimore Ravens terminated Rice's contract as a result, and was later indefinitely suspended by the NFL, although a judge later vacated this indefinite suspension.[87] In Week 12, the Ravens traveled down for an interconference battle with the New Orleans Saints, which the Ravens won. In Week 16, the Ravens traveled to Houston to take on the Texans. In one of Flacco's worst performances, the offense sputtered against the Houston defense and Flacco threw three interceptions, falling to the Texans 25–13. With their playoff chances and season hanging in the balance, the Ravens took on the Browns in Week 17 at home. After three quarters had gone by and down 10–3, Joe Flacco led the Ravens on a comeback scoring 17 unanswered points, winning 20–10. With the win, and the Kansas City Chiefs defeating the San Diego Chargers, the Ravens clinched their sixth playoff berth in seven seasons.[88][89] In the wild card round, the Ravens won 30–17 against their divisional rivals, the Pittsburgh Steelers, at Heinz Field.[90] In the next game in the Divisional round, the Ravens faced the New England Patriots. Despite a strong offensive effort and having a 14-point lead twice in the game, the Ravens were defeated by the Patriots 35–31, ending their season.[91] The 2015 season marked 20 seasons of the franchise's existence competing in the NFL, which the franchise recognized with a special badge being worn on their uniforms during the 2015 NFL season.[92] The Ravens lost key players such as Joe Flacco, Justin Forsett, Terrell Suggs, Steve Smith Sr., and Eugene Monroe to season-ending injuries. Injuries and their inability to win close games early in the season led to the first losing season in the Harbaugh-Flacco era with a 5–11 mark. The 2016 Ravens finished 8–8, but failed to qualify the playoffs for the second straight year.[93] They were eliminated from playoff contention after their Week 16 loss to their division rivals, the Steelers.[94] This was the first time the Ravens missed the playoffs in consecutive seasons since 2004–2005, as well as the first in the Harbaugh/Flacco era.[95] During the 2017 season, the Ravens improved upon their 8–8 record from 2016 by one win, finishing the season 9–7 and missing the playoffs for the third year in a row.[96][97] This marked the first time the Ravens failed to make the playoffs in three straight seasons since the team's first three years of existence (1996–1998). The Ravens suffered a loss at home to the Cincinnati Bengals in the final game of the season that prevented them from earning a playoff berth. The Ravens drafted quarterback Lamar Jackson with the 32nd pick in the 2018 draft.[98] After the team started the season with a 4–5 record, Jackson took over as the starting QB in Week 11 when Joe Flacco was sidelined with a hip injury. The team won six of its next seven games, finishing the 2018 season with a 10–6 record and winning the AFC North, giving them their first playoff appearance since 2014 and their first division title since 2012.[99] The Ravens lost to the Los Angeles Chargers in the Wild Card round with Jackson at quarterback, making him the youngest QB in NFL history to start a playoff game.[100] At the conclusion of the season, Ozzie Newsome stepped down as the team's general manager.[101] He was replaced by longtime assistant Eric DeCosta.[102] On March 13, 2019, the Ravens traded Joe Flacco to the Denver Broncos in exchange for a fourth-round pick in the 2019 NFL draft.[103] That season, Lamar Jackson led the Ravens to a franchise-best 14–2 record, including a 12-game winning streak to finish the regular season.[104] On December 22, they clinched home-field advantage for the first time in franchise history following a win over the Cleveland Browns. On December 8, Jackson became only the second player in NFL history to rush for over 1,000 yards from the quarterback position. Four days later, Jackson broke Michael Vick's single-season quarterback rushing record of 1,037 yards. Thirteen Ravens were selected to the 2019 Pro Bowl, matching the all-time NFL record.[105] The Ravens finished the 2019 regular season with 3,296 rushing yards, the most rushing yards by any team in NFL history during a season[106] and they became the first team in NFL history to average at least 200 passing yards and 200 rushing yards per game in the same season.[107] Despite earning the number-one seed in the playoffs, the Ravens were eliminated by the sixth-seeded Tennessee Titans in the Divisional Round of the playoffs, 28–12.[108] Lamar Jackson was unanimously voted AP NFL MVP, becoming only the second player in NFL history to do so, after Tom Brady in 2010.[109] In 2020, the Ravens went 6–5 in their first 11 games, but rebounded and finished the season 11–5, taking second place in the AFC North and earning a Wild Card playoff berth with the fifth seed.[110][111] They also led the NFL in rushing yards for the second year in a row during the regular season, with 3,071 yards. In the Wild Card round, they defeated the fourth-seeded Tennessee Titans in Nashville, 20–13.[112] In the Divisional Round, they fell to the second-seeded Buffalo Bills, 17–3.[113] In 2021, the Ravens claimed the record of consecutive preseason wins with 20, overtaking Vince Lombardi's Green Bay Packers record.[114] In Week 3 of the 2021 season against the Detroit Lions, Justin Tucker put his name in the NFL record books by kicking the longest field goal in the history of the National Football League, 66 yards, which also was the field goal that won the game and 5 yards longer than his previous career long of 61 yards that was also kicked in Detroit.[115] The following week, the Ravens tied the NFL record of consecutive 100 yard rushing games by a team with 43 in a win over the Denver Broncos, equaling the 1974 to '77 Pittsburgh Steelers record.[116] The team reached an 8–3 record by Week 12, but ended the season on a six-game losing streak to finish 8–9, missing the playoffs and coming in last in the AFC North. Jackson sustained an ankle injury during the Week 14 loss to the Browns and did not appear in any subsequent games.[117] In the 2022 season, the Ravens finished with a 10–7 record, which finished second in the AFC North.[118] They lost in the Wild Card Round 24–17 to the Cincinnati Bengals.[119] In the 2023 season, the Ravens finished with a 13–4 record, which earned them the AFC North title and the #1 overall seed for the AFC playoffs.[120][121] In the Divisional Round, they defeated the Houston Texans 34–10.[122] In the AFC Championship, they lost to the Kansas City Chiefs 17–10.[123] Prior to the start of the 2024 season, the Ravens acquired All-Pro running back Derrick Henry and by week 6 became the first NFL team to post six straight games with at least 150 yards and one touchdown through the air and one on the ground.[124] By far the team's biggest rival is the Pittsburgh Steelers. Pittsburgh and Baltimore are separated by a less-than-5-hour drive along Interstate 70. Both teams are known for their hard-hitting physical style of play. They play twice a year in the AFC North, and have met four times in the playoffs. Pittsburgh leads the all-time series, 30–24, and holds a 3–1 advantage in the four matchups in the postseason.[125] Games between these two teams usually come down to the wire as most within the last 5 years have come down to under 4 points. The rivalry is considered one of the most significant and intense in the NFL today.[126] The Ravens' rivalry with the Cincinnati Bengals began when the original Browns franchise relocated to Baltimore to become the Ravens. Since then, the rivalry heated up when longtime Ravens defensive coordinator Marvin Lewis was hired as the head coach of the Bengals. The Ravens lead the all-time series 30–27 as of the 2023 season. The Bengals won the only playoff meeting in the 2022 AFC Wild Card round.[127] The Browns–Ravens rivalry in the AFC North began when the Cleveland Browns resumed operations in 1999, after suspending operations for three seasons after the original Browns moved to Baltimore and became the Ravens. The rivalry between the Browns and Ravens was more directed at former Browns owner Art Modell, who orchestrated the move, than the team itself, and has, by most Ravens fans, been simply considered a divisional game. The rivalry has been largely one-sided, as the Ravens hold a 36–14 series lead as of the end of the 2023 season. The two teams have not met in the playoffs.[128] The Ravens first met the New England Patriots in 1996, but the rivalry truly started in 2007 when the Ravens suffered a bitter 27–24 loss in the Patriots' quest for perfection. The rivalry began to escalate in 2009 when the Patriots beat the Ravens 27–21 in a game that involved a confrontation between Patriots quarterback Tom Brady and Ravens linebacker Terrell Suggs. Both players would go on to take verbal shots at each other through the media after the game.[129] As of the 2023 season, the Patriots lead the overall series, 11–5. The two teams have split four postseason meetings, 2–2. The Ravens won the 2009 Wild Card Round, 33–14, and the 2012 AFC Championship game, 28–13. The Patriots won the 2011 AFC Championship Game 23–20 and the 2014 Divisional Round, 35–31.[130] Reemerging in the late 2010s, the rivalry between the Ravens and Tennessee Titans actually started in the early 2000s when both teams were in the AFC Central, with both teams having tough and bitter games, Ravens gave the Titans their first ever loss at the new Adelphia Coliseum in the 2000 season and the Ravens eliminated Tennessee during the playoffs later on. Fans and analysts have noted an emerging rivalry between the Baltimore Ravens and the Tennessee Titans of the AFC South. While there is no known animosity between the cities of Baltimore and Nashville, games between their respective teams have become heated and included fiery verbal exchanges between coaches and players.[131][132] As of the 2023 season, the Ravens lead the all-time series 14–13.[133] Though the two teams only play each other every 4 years, the Ravens have taken part in a minor geographic rivalry with the Washington Commanders as both stadiums are approximately 40 miles apart.[134][135] The Commanders particularly had long blocked the return of an NFL team to Baltimore since the Colts franchise relocated to Indianapolis in 1984. Former owner Jack Kent Cooke had been accused in multiple instances of orchestrating any means to prevent the city from receiving a new franchise until the Cleveland Browns relocated to Baltimore in 1996, prompting Cooke to put the Redskins' then-new stadium in Landover, Maryland.[136][137][138] The two teams play each other annually during the preseason.[139] The Ravens currently lead the all-time series 4–3.[140] Below is table of the Baltimore Ravens head-to-head franchise record as of November 12, 2024.[141] The team's first helmet logo, used from 1996 through the 1999 Pro Bowl, featured raven wings outspread from a shield displaying a letter B framed by the word Ravens overhead and a cross bottony underneath. The US Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed a jury verdict that the logo infringed on a copyright retained by Frederick E. Bouchat, an amateur artist and security guard in Maryland, though he was not awarded a dollar amount for his claim.[142] Bouchat had submitted his design to the Maryland Stadium Authority by fax after learning that Baltimore was to acquire an NFL team. He was not credited for the design when the logo was announced. Bouchat sued the team, claiming to be the designer of the emblem; representatives of the team asserted that the image had been designed independently. The court ruled in favor of Bouchat, noting that team owner Modell had access to Bouchat's work. Bouchat's fax had gone to John Moag, the Maryland Stadium Authority chairman, whose office was located in the same building as Modell's.[143] Bouchat ultimately was not awarded monetary compensation in the damages phase of the case.[144] The Baltimore Sun ran a poll showing three designs for new helmet logos. Fans participating in the poll expressed a preference for a raven's head in profile over other designs. Art Modell announced that he would honor this preference but still wanted a letter B to appear somewhere in the design. The new Ravens logo, introduced in 1999, featured a raven's head in profile with the letter B superimposed. The secondary logo is a shield that honors Baltimore's history of heraldry. Alternating Calvert and Crossland emblems (seen also in the flag of Maryland and the flag of Baltimore) are interlocked with stylized letters B and R. The design of the Ravens uniform has remained essentially unchanged since the team's inaugural season in 1996. Art Modell admitted to ESPN's Roy Firestone that the Ravens' colors, introduced in early 1996, were inspired by the Northwestern Wildcats 1995 dream season.[145] Helmets are black with purple \"talon\" stripes rising from the facemask to the crown. Players normally wear purple jerseys at home and white jerseys on the road. In 1996 the team wore black pants with a single large white stripe for all games.[146] In 1997 the Ravens opted for a more classic NFL look with white pants sporting stripes in purple and black, along with the jerseys sporting a different font for the uniform numbers. The white pants were worn with both home and road jerseys. The road uniform (white pants with white jerseys) was worn by the Ravens in Super Bowl XXXV, at the end of the 2000 NFL season. This all-white combination was originally worn with black socks, but starting in 2021, the Ravens began wearing white hosiery with the all-white uniform. In the 2002 season the Ravens began the practice of wearing white jerseys for the home opener that has a 1:00 kickoff. In recent seasons, the practice has come when the home game is played in week one. Since John Harbaugh became the head coach in 2008, the Ravens have also worn their white jerseys at home for preseason games. In November 2004 the team introduced an alternate uniform design featuring black jerseys and solid black pants with black socks. The all-black uniform was first worn for a home game against the Cleveland Browns, entitled \"Pitch Black\" night, that resulted in a Ravens win. The uniform has since been worn for select prime-time national game broadcasts and other games of significance. The Ravens began wearing black pants again with the white jersey in 2008. On December 7, 2008, during a Sunday Night Football game against the Washington Redskins, the Ravens introduced a new combination of black jersey with white pants. It was believed to be due to the fact that John Harbaugh doesn't like the \"blackout\" look.[147] However, on December 19, 2010, the Ravens wore their black jerseys and black pants in a 30–24 victory over the New Orleans Saints.[148] Since 2010, the Ravens have worn their black jerseys at least twice each season. From 2011 to 2013 and again in 2015, they wore the all blacks once and the black on white once. In 2014 and 2016, they wore all black both times they wore alternate uniforms. In 2017, they wore all black twice and black on white once (although the league is supposed to limit teams to wearing alternate jerseys a maximum of two times a season). On December 5, 2010, the Ravens reverted to the black pants with the purple jerseys versus the Pittsburgh Steelers during NBC's Sunday Night Football telecast. The Ravens lost to the Steelers 13–10. They wore the same look again for their game against the Cleveland Browns on December 24, 2011, and they won, 20–14. They wore this combination a third time against the Houston Texans on January 15, 2012, in the AFC Divisional playoff. They won 20–13. They would again wear this combination on January 6, 2013, during the AFC Wild Card playoff and what turned out to be Ray Lewis' final home game, where they defeated the Indianapolis Colts 24–9. From their inaugural season until 2006, the Ravens wore white cleats with their uniforms; they switched to black cleats in 2007. From the mid-2010s onward, the NFL relaxed its rules regarding primary cleat colors, and Ravens players began wearing customized cleats in either purple, black, gold or white. On December 20, 2015, the team unexpectedly debuted gold pants for the first time, wearing them with their regular purple jerseys against the Kansas City Chiefs.[149] Although gold is an official accent color of the Ravens, the pants got an overwhelmingly negative response on social media by both Ravens fans and fans of other NFL teams, with some comparisons being made to the rival Pittsburgh Steelers' pants, and mustard.[150][151] During the 2015 season, the NFL announced a jersey promotion called Color Rush in which teams would wear uniforms typically of one color head-to-toe during select prime-time games. The promotion was used three times that season; all the games that featured them were on Thursday Night and had both teams wear them in each. The following season, the league released uniforms for all 32 teams and announced they would be worn during all Thursday Night games that year, as well as on Christmas. The Ravens had one Thursday Night game in 2016; they wore their all-purple Color Rush uniforms and won 28–7 over the division rival Cleveland Browns.[152] They had one other Thursday night game the following season, in which they again wore the jerseys and won 40–0 over the Miami Dolphins. In their Christmas 2016 game against the Steelers, the Ravens wore their regular all-white uniforms while their rivals wore their Color Rush uniforms. Starting in 2024, the Ravens would wear alternate purple helmets with the Color Rush uniform, featuring a new front-facing Ravens logo as the helmet decals. The full set was rebranded as the \"Purple Rising\" uniforms.[153][154] On September 13, 2018, the Ravens debuted a new combination in a road game against the Cincinnati Bengals, wearing white jerseys with purple pants.[155] The purple pants are similar to the ones used for Color Rush except that it has side stripes of black and white; the Color Rush purple pants have gold and white stripes. Then on October 21 against the New Orleans Saints, the Ravens paired their new purple pants with their regular purple uniforms. Black socks were originally worn with this combination, but on January 2, 2022, the Ravens wore purple socks with the regular all-purple combination against the Los Angeles Rams, essentially replicating their Color Rush uniforms but with minimal gold elements. For the regular season finale against the Browns on December 30, the Ravens wore their black uniforms with purple pants. The Ravens wore this combination again October 11, 2021, against the Indianapolis Colts on Monday Night Football in a 31–25 overtime win.[156] The team marching band is called Baltimore's Marching Ravens.[157] They began as the Colts' marching band and have operated continuously from September 7, 1947, to the present. They helped campaign for football to return to Baltimore after the Colts moved. Because they stayed in Baltimore after the Colts left, the band is nicknamed \"the band that would not die\" and were the subject of an episode of ESPN's 30 for 30. The Washington Commanders are the only other NFL team that currently has a marching band.

For Cleveland Browns players, including those in the Hall of Fame and those whose numbers were retired, see Cleveland Browns. The Ravens do not have officially retired numbers.[158] However, the number 19 has not been issued out of respect for Baltimore Colts quarterback Johnny Unitas, except for quarterback Scott Mitchell in his lone season in Baltimore in 1999. In addition, numbers 75, 52, 20, 55, and 73 in honor of Jonathan Ogden, Ray Lewis, Ed Reed, Terrell Suggs, and Marshal Yanda respectively, have not been issued since those players' retirements from football. The Ravens have a \"Ring of Honor\" which is on permanent display encircling the field of M&T Bank Stadium. The ring currently honors 20 members, including eight former members of the Baltimore Colts.[159] Key/Legend The team's first draft was the 1996 NFL draft, where they selected UCLA offensive tackle Jonathan Ogden fourth overall and University of Miami linebacker Ray Lewis 24th overall.[178] Both players won a Super Bowl with the team, earned numerous Pro Bowl and All-Pro selections, and are members of the Pro Football Hall of Fame. Along with their pick in the next year's draft, this was the highest first-round draft pick that the Ravens have had. In 1996, 2000, 2003, 2018, and 2021, the Ravens had two first-round draft picks. In 2004, 2010, and 2012, they had none. Two of their first round picks have made at least ten Pro Bowls.[179] Lamar Jackson 2021-10-12 IND + = min. 500 attempts, # = min. 100 attempts, ∗ = minimum 15 attempts, Lamar Jackson2024-01-20 HOU ∗ = minimum 15 attempts, # = min. 100 attempts, + = min. 500 attempts ∗ = minimum 4 receptions, # = min. 20 receptions, + = min. 200 receptions All records as of December 18, 2019, per Pro-Football Reference.com[180] → Coaching staff → Front office → More NFL staffs",

                "content": "National Football League (1970–present) The Cincinnati Bengals are a professional American football team based in Cincinnati. The Bengals compete in the National Football League (NFL) as a member of the American Football Conference (AFC) North division. The team plays its home games at Paycor Stadium in downtown Cincinnati.[7] Former Cleveland Browns head coach Paul Brown began planning for the creation of the Bengals franchise in 1965, and Cincinnati's city council approved the construction of Riverfront Stadium in 1966. Finally, in 1967, the Bengals were founded when a group headed by Brown received franchise approval by the American Football League (AFL) on May 23, 1967, and they began play in the 1968 season.[8] Brown was the Bengals' head coach from their inception to 1975. After being dismissed as the Browns' head coach by Art Modell (who had purchased a majority interest in the team in 1961) in January 1963, Brown had shown interest in establishing another NFL franchise in Ohio and looked at both Cincinnati and Columbus. He ultimately chose the former when a deal between the city, Hamilton County, and Major League Baseball's Cincinnati Reds (who were seeking a replacement for the obsolete Crosley Field) was struck that resulted in an agreement to build a multipurpose stadium which could host both baseball and football games. Due to the impending merger of the AFL and the NFL, which was scheduled to take full effect in the 1970 season, Brown agreed to join the AFL as its 10th and final franchise. The Bengals, like the other former AFL teams, were assigned to the AFC following the merger. Cincinnati was also selected because, like their neighbors the Reds, they could draw from several large neighboring cities (Louisville and Lexington, Kentucky; Columbus, Dayton, and Springfield, Ohio) that are all no more than 110 miles (180 km) away from downtown Cincinnati, along with Indianapolis, until the Baltimore Colts relocated there prior to the 1984 NFL season.[9] After Paul Brown's death in 1991, controlling interest in the team was inherited by his son, Mike Brown. In 2011, Brown purchased shares of the team owned by the estate of co-founder Austin Knowlton and is now the majority owner of the Bengals franchise.[7] The Bengals won the AFC championship in 1981, 1988, and in 2021. After each of the 1981 and 1988 conference championships, they went on to lose to the San Francisco 49ers, in Super Bowls XVI and XXIII. The team struggled greatly in the 1990s and the early 2000s, during which time they were sometimes referred to disparagingly as \"The Bungles,\" a term coined by Steelers broadcaster Myron Cope.[10] [11][12][13][14] Following the 1990 season, the team went 14 years without making the NFL playoffs or posting a winning record. The Bengals went through several head coaches in that period, and many of their top draft picks did not pan out. The team's fortunes improved in the mid-2000s and into the mid-2010s, which saw them become more consistent postseason contenders, but they continued to struggle in the playoffs.[15][16][17][18] The turning point for the Bengals was during the 2021 season, when they won their first playoff game in 31 years and advanced to the first of two consecutive AFC Championship games. In 2021, they defeated the Kansas City Chiefs 27–24 in overtime and advanced to Super Bowl LVI, their first appearance in the Super Bowl in 33 years, where they lost to the Los Angeles Rams 23–20.[19] They advanced to the AFC Championship game again in 2022 but lost to the eventual Super Bowl champions, the Chiefs, by a score of 23-20 (the same exact score as in Super Bowl LVI).[20] The team does not have an official general manager. However, Duke Tobin is often, though incorrectly, referred to as the Bengals' general manager because he handles most personnel decisions.[21] In a 2011 survey, Brown was rated as among the worst team owners in American professional sports.[22] In a Forbes article on the value of NFL teams as of August 2022, the Cincinnati Bengals were ranked last with a value of $3 billion.[23] In 1967, an ownership group led by Paul Brown was granted a franchise in the American Football League. Brown named the team the Bengals in order \"to give it a link with past professional football in Cincinnati\".[24] Another Cincinnati Bengals team had existed in the city and played in three previous American Football Leagues[25] from 1937 to 1942. The city's world-renowned zoo was also home to a rare white Bengal tiger. In a possible insult to Art Modell – or possibly as a homage to the Massillon Tigers – Brown chose the exact shade of orange used by his former team. He added black as the secondary color. Brown chose a very simple logo: the word \"BENGALS\" in black lettering. One of the potential helmet designs Brown rejected was a striped motif that was similar to the helmets adopted by the team in 1981 still in use today; however, that design featured stripes which were more uniform in width.[26] The Bengals began play in the 1968 season. In 1966, the American Football League agreed to a merger with its older and more established rival, the National Football League.[27] Among the terms of the merger was that the AFL was permitted to add one additional franchise; the NFL wanted an even number of clubs in the merged league, so a team needed to be added to bring the number of clubs in the merged league to 26 teams. For the AFL, a key motive behind their agreement to accept a new team was that the guarantee of an eventual place in the NFL meant the league could charge a steep expansion fee of $10 million – 400 times the $25,000 the original eight owners paid when they founded the league in 1960. The cash from the new team provided the American Football League with the funds needed to pay the indemnities required to be paid by the AFL to the NFL, as stipulated by the merger agreement. Prior to the merger's announcement, Brown had not seriously considered joining the American Football League and was not a supporter of what he openly regarded to be an inferior competition, once famously stating that \"I didn't pay ten million dollars to be in the AFL.\"[28] However, with the announcement of the merger, Brown realized that the AFL expansion franchise would likely be his only realistic path back into the NFL in the short to medium term, and ultimately acquiesced to joining the AFL after learning that the team was guaranteed to become an NFL franchise after the merger was completed in 1970. There was also a major problem: Major League Baseball's Cincinnati Reds were in need of a facility to replace Crosley Field, which they had used since 1912. By this time, the small park was antiquated and rundown, and parking issues had plagued the city since the early 1950s, while the park also lacked modern amenities – issues that were exacerbated by the Mill Creek Expressway (I-75) project that ran alongside the park. While New York City – which had lost both its National League teams in 1957 after the Dodgers relocated to Los Angeles, and the Giants relocated to San Francisco – had actively courted Reds owner Powel Crosley to relocate his team there, Crosley was adamant that the Reds remain in Cincinnati and tolerated the worsening problems with the Crosley Field location. With assistance from Ohio governor Jim Rhodes, Hamilton County and the Cincinnati city council agreed to build a single multi-purpose facility on the dilapidated riverfront section of the city: the new facility had to be ready by the opening of the 1970 NFL season, and was officially named Riverfront Stadium. With the completion of the merger in 1970, the Cleveland Browns were one of three NFL teams that agreed to move to the AFL-based American Football Conference to give both conferences an equal number of teams and were placed in the AFC Central, the same division as the Bengals. An instant rivalry was born, fueled initially by Paul Brown's rivalry with Art Modell.[29][30] For their first two seasons, the Bengals played at Nippert Stadium, the current home of the University of Cincinnati Bearcats.[31] The team held training camp at Wilmington College in Wilmington, through the 1968 preseason. The team finished its first season with a 3–11 record[32] and running back Paul Robinson, who rushed for 1,023 yards, and was named the AFL Rookie of the Year.[33] Founder Paul Brown coached the team for its first eight seasons.[34] One of Brown's college draft strategies was to draft players from non-traditional football schools. Punter/wide receiver Pat McInally attended Harvard University, and linebacker Reggie Williams attended Dartmouth College and served on Cincinnati city council while on the Bengals' roster. Because of this policy, many former players went on to have successful careers in commentary and broadcasting as well as the arts. In addition, Brown had a knack for locating and recognizing pro football talent in unusual places.[35] In 1970, the Bengals moved to play at Riverfront Stadium, a home they shared with the Cincinnati Reds until the team moved to Paul Brown Stadium in 2000. Notable players of the 1970 team included Virgil Carter, Chip Meyers, Jack Meckstroth, Bob Trumpy, and Lemar Parrish. Virgil Carter threw for 1,647 yards. Chip Myers paced all receivers, catching 32 passes for 542 yards. Bob Trumpy contributed to the receiving game, too.[36] The team reached the playoffs three times during that decade, but could not win any of those postseason games. In 1975, the team posted an 11–3 record, giving them what remains the highest winning percentage (.786) in franchise history. But it only earned them a wild card spot in the playoffs, behind the 12–2 Pittsburgh Steelers, who went on to win the Super Bowl; the Bengals lost to the Oakland Raiders 31–28 in the divisional playoffs.[37] The Bengals reached the Super Bowl twice during the 1980s – in Super Bowl XVI and Super Bowl XXIII – and lost against the San Francisco 49ers both times.[38][39] The team appeared in the playoffs in 1990, making it to the second round before losing to the Los Angeles Raiders.[40] Before the following season got underway, Paul Brown died at age 82.[41] Due to declining health, he had already transferred control to his son, Mike Brown, but was reported to still influence the daily operations of the team.[42] The Bengals' fortunes changed for the worse as the team posted 14 consecutive non-winning seasons and were saddled with numerous draft busts. The Bengals began to emerge from that dismal period into a new era of increased consistency, however, after the team finished with its worst record in team history, 2–14, which led to the hiring of Marvin Lewis as head coach in 2003.[43] Carson Palmer, the future star quarterback, was drafted in 2003, but did not play a snap that whole season, as Jon Kitna had a comeback year (voted NFL Comeback Player of the Year).[44][45] Despite Kitna's success, Palmer was promoted to starting quarterback the following season.[46] The team finished with an 8–8 record and missed the postseason in 2004.[47] Under Palmer, the team advanced to the playoffs for the first time since 1990 losing in the Wild Card Roundto the Pittsburgh Steelers 31–17 in the 2005 season, which also was the first time the team had a winning percentage above .500 since 1990.[48][49][50] The Bengals returned to the playoffs again in 2009 in a season that included the franchise's first-ever division sweep. This was especially impressive since two of the teams swept by the Bengals – the Pittsburgh Steelers and the Baltimore Ravens – had made it to the AFC Championship Game the previous season. Marvin Lewis was rewarded for the accomplishment with the NFL Coach of the Year Award.[51] In the 2010 season, the Bengals posted a 4–12 record.[52] Following the disappointing 2010 season, quarterback Carson Palmer demanded to be traded. When the Bengals refused to do so, Palmer announced his retirement from the NFL.[53] He later was moved at the NFL trade deadline to the Oakland Raiders.[54] In the 2011 NFL draft, the Bengals selected wide receiver A. J. Green in the first round and quarterback Andy Dalton in the second round.[55] The Bengals improved to 9–7 in the 2011 season, and clinched a playoff spot.[56] Dalton and Green became the most prolific rookie WR-QB duo in history, connecting 65 times for 1,057 yards. However, they lost to the Houston Texans, 31–10, in the Wild Card round.[57] In the 2012 season, the Bengals clinched a playoff spot once more with a win over the Pittsburgh Steelers, going to the playoffs in back-to-back years for the first time since 1982.[58] However, the Bengals faced the Texans in the first round yet again and took another early exit, losing 19–13.[59] In the 2013 season, for the third straight year, the Bengals clinched a playoff berth and also won the AFC North, finishing with an 11–5 record.[60] But once again, the Bengals were defeated in the wild card round, this time by the San Diego Chargers, 27–10.[61] Most of the blame was put on Andy Dalton, who threw two interceptions and fumbled on a forward dive. This made the Bengals 0–5 in playoff games since Mike Brown took over as owner. The 2014 season started well, with the Bengals winning their first three contests against the Baltimore Ravens, Atlanta Falcons, and Tennessee Titans. However, they lost their Week 5 road matchup with the New England Patriots, 43–17. An overtime tie with the Carolina Panthers and a shutout loss to the Indianapolis Colts followed the primetime loss to the Patriots. Finishing the season 10–5–1 as the fifth seed, they lost to the Colts, 26–10, in the first round of the playoffs.[62][63] This was the first time the franchise made the playoffs four straight seasons. In 2015, the Bengals got out to a franchise-best 8–0 start with a 31–10 win over the Cleveland Browns.[64] Unfortunately, in Week 14 they would lose starting quarterback Andy Dalton to injury. He would not return that season, leaving A. J. McCarron to start under center. The Bengals finished with a franchise record-tying 12–4 mark.[65] Additionally, they lost to the division rival Pittsburgh Steelers, 18–16, in the Wild Card round in the final minute, making them the first franchise in NFL history to lose five straight opening-round playoff games.[66] This frustration continued in 2016 for the Bengals: they finished the 2016 campaign with a 6–9–1 record, losing several key players to injury, including A. J. Green, Giovani Bernard, and Jeremy Hill.[67][68] They missed the playoffs for the first time since 2010, marking the first time Andy Dalton missed the playoffs as the Bengals' starting quarterback. One notable game was a 27–27 tie against the Washington Redskins which was played in London in 2016.[69] Following a rough 2016 season, the Bengals looked forward into 2017. However, after starting 0–3, the Bengals never found their footing. At one point in the season, the Bengals were 5–9. There were rumors that Marvin Lewis would not return for the next season as the Bengals' head coach. However, after two come-from-behind victories over the Lions and Ravens that eliminated both teams from the playoffs, the Bengals finished 7–9.[70] The final two games were convincing enough for owner Mike Brown to give Lewis a new two-year contract.[71] The 2018 campaign began with promise for the Bengals under Lewis. Cincinnati began the season with a 4–1 record with impressive wins over the Colts, Ravens, Falcons, and Dolphins. However, the Bengals suffered many setbacks after the hot start: defensive coordinator Teryl Austin was fired mid-season because of defensive woes,[72] A. J. Green was injured and officially out for the last four games, and Andy Dalton injured his thumb in the Bengals' first game against the Browns and replaced by Jeff Driskel for the rest of the season.[73][74] The Bengals ended 2018 with a final record of 6–10 and finished last place in the AFC North.[75] On December 31, 2018, with one year to go on his contract, Lewis and the Bengals mutually parted ways after three straight losing seasons under his watch.[76] In 2019, they hired head coach Zac Taylor.[77] The 2019 campaign started off with reasonable success, with the Bengals barely losing to Seattle 21–20 at CenturyLink Field; but what started with promise ended in disaster.[78] The Bengals then lost 10 more games and were 0–11 heading into December 2019. To open the month of December, they got their first win of the season against the Jets, 22–6, in Cincinnati.[79] They eventually lost to the Patriots and then to the Dolphins, 38–35, in overtime after Dalton led the team back from 23 points down in the fourth quarter. With the loss to the Dolphins, the Bengals officially clinched the No. 1 overall pick in the 2020 NFL draft.[80] They capped off the season with a win against the Cleveland Browns, finishing 2–14, equaling the 2002 season as the team's worst record in history.[81][82] In 2020, the Bengals improved under rookies Joe Burrow and Tee Higgins.[83] Starting the season with a 2–5–1 record going into the bye week, including an overtime tie to the Philadelphia Eagles. Going into Week 11 facing the Washington Football Team, they lost Joe Burrow to a season-ending knee injury that all but ended their season, only winning two more contests against the Pittsburgh Steelers and Houston Texans.[84] Finishing the season 4–11–1.[85] In 2021, the Bengals won the AFC North with a 10–7 record, which included dominant sweeps of the rival Pittsburgh Steelers and Baltimore Ravens.[86] Led by Joe Burrow, who was playing in his first full season after recovering from his devastating knee injury in Week 11 of his rookie season and rookie receiver, and Burrow's college teammate at LSU, Ja'Marr Chase, Cincinnati would win the AFC North for the first time since 2015. They beat the Kansas City Chiefs, 34–31, in a Week 17 thriller to clinch the division. They then won their first playoff game since the 1990 season, beating the Las Vegas Raiders, 26–19, in the Wild Card round.[87] After that, they upset the top-seeded Tennessee Titans, 19–16, when Evan McPherson kicked a game-winning 52-yard field goal. A week later, they advanced to their first Super Bowl since 1989 when McPherson kicked a 33-yard field goal in overtime to cap off a comeback from being down 21–3 and shock the No. 2 seed Chiefs, 27–24. They lost a close Super Bowl to the Los Angeles Rams in Super Bowl LVI, 23–20.[88] In Week 1 of the 2022 NFL season, the Bengals lost, 23–20, to the Pittsburgh Steelers in overtime, breaking a three-game winning streak the Bengals had against Pittsburgh. After falling to a 4–4 record in Week 8, the Bengals proceeded to win 8 straight games to tie a franchise-record for single-season wins and earn a 3 seed in the AFC playoffs.[89][90] They defeated divisional rival Baltimore in the first round 24–17, behind a 98-yard fumble recovery returned for a touchdown by Sam Hubbard.[91][92] Despite missing three starting offensive linemen, the Bengals followed that up with a decisive 27–10 road win over the favored Buffalo Bills to reach a second straight AFC Championship appearance for the first time in franchise history.[93] Once again, they faced the Kansas City Chiefs in the Championship Game, but this time they lost 23–20, in another thrilling game.[94] In the 2023 season, during their Week 11 matchup against the Baltimore Ravens, Joe Burrow would suffer a wrist injury that would rule him out the rest of the season.[95] The consistent play of backup quarterback Jake Browning kept the Bengals alive in the postseason hunt after Burrow's injury.[96] The Bengals finished the season 9–8 and missed the playoffs.[97] When the team debuted in 1968, the Bengals' uniforms were modeled after the Cleveland Browns. When Paul Brown was fired by Art Modell, Brown still owned the equipment used by Cleveland, so after the firing, Paul Brown packed up all his equipment, which he then used for his new team in Cincinnati. The Cleveland Browns' team colors were brown, orange, and white, and their helmets were solid orange with a white dorsal stripe over the crest. The Bengals' team colors were orange, black, and white, and their helmets were a similar shade of orange, with the only variations being the word \"Bengals\" in black block letters (with a white outline) on either side of the helmet and no stripe on the helmet. The Cincinnati Bengals were unique in the NFL, as they did not have secondary uniform numbers on the jerseys (called \"TV numbers\") until they appeared on the sleeves in the 1980 season; they were the only NFL team that didn't have them prior to that point. That same year, the team changed their helmet face mask color from gray to black. The team did not discard their Cleveland-like uniforms until 1981. During that year, a then-unique uniform design was introduced: Although the team kept black jerseys, white jerseys, and white pants, they were now trimmed with orange and black tiger stripes. The team also introduced the orange helmets with black tiger stripes that are still in use today. Sports Illustrated likened the Bengals' new helmets to \"varicose pumpkins.\"[98] In 1997, the Bengals designed a logo consisting of a leaping tiger, and it was added to the uniform sleeves (with this, the TV numbers moved to the shoulder). Another alternate logo consisted of a Bengal's head facing to the left. However, the orange helmet with black tiger stripes continued to be the trademark. In 2004, a new tiger stripe pattern and more accents were added to the uniforms. The black jerseys now featured orange tiger-striped sleeves and white side panels, while the white jerseys began to use black tiger-striped sleeves and orange shoulders.[99] A new logo consisting of an orange \"B\" covered with black tiger stripes was introduced.[100] The team also started rotating black pants and debuted an alternate orange jersey, with white side panels and black tiger-striped sleeves. The Bengals have worn their black uniforms at home throughout their history, with some exceptions, such as the 1970 season, when the Bengals wore white at home for the entire season as well as most of the 1971 season (the Bengals were the first AFL team to wear white at home, as its rules required the home team to wear their dark jerseys, unlike the NFL, which allowed the home team choice of jersey color starting in 1964). Since 2005, the Bengals have worn white for September home games where the heat could become a factor. In 2016, the Bengals unveiled their all-white Color Rush alternate uniform, featuring black tiger stripes along the sleeves and pants. Orange was only used on the Nike mark, on the team logo, and as an outline color on the player's name.[101] The club announced a new uniform design on January 21, 2021. The new uniform design would be worn beginning with the 2021 NFL season.[102] The set retains the signature striped helmet, while simplifying the look by removing the side and shoulder panels, creating a new stripe pattern for the sleeves, getting rid of the number block shadow, and removing the stroke on the player's name. This set also puts the team's wordmark on the chest and lacks TV numbers on the sleeves. The shade of orange was changed, as well. The Bengals wore three different pants with this set: black pants with orange stripes, white pants with black stripes, and white pants with orange stripes. The white pants with black stripes were worn with the white jersey in 2021 playoff games at Tennessee and Kansas City. The white pants with orange stripes were worn with the black jersey in Super Bowl LVI against the Rams.[103] In 2022, after the NFL rescinded the \"one-helmet rule,\" the Bengals unveiled an alternate black-striped white helmet. In addition, the team brought back the all-white Color Rush uniform to be paired with the white helmets.[104][105] This would last one season, however, as the team decided to pair the white helmet with the primary white uniform for two games in 2023, effectively retiring the Color Rush uniform for the time being.[106] In 2024, the Bengals added orange pants to the uniform rotation after Madden NFL 25 leaked the option to the public.[107] The Bengals then unveiled a new all-orange uniform combination to be worn September 8 against the Patriots.[108] The team's official mascot is a Bengal tiger named Who Dey.[109] Its jersey number is 1.[110] Aside from Who Dey, the team also has the Ben-Gals, the team's cheerleading squad,[111] which included Laura Vikmanis, the oldest cheerleader in league history.[112] Carol Motsinger in 2015 said, \"In 2012, Cincinnati welcomed another tiger named Who Dey. This time, one that walks on four legs. More than 1,000 Bengals season ticket holders named a Malayan tiger Who Dey at Cincinnati Zoo & Botanical Garden. He was recently traded to a zoo in Kansas.\"[113] The Ohio History Central notes: \"In 1940, a third American Football League formed, and the Cincinnati Bengals joined it. Unfortunately, World War II began the following year, causing manpower shortages as men joined the armed forces. This prompted this newer AFL to cease playing after the 1941 season. Paul Brown, former coach of the Cleveland Browns, received authorization from a modern American Football League to create a team in Cincinnati. Brown chose the name Bengals to memorialize the teams of the same name that had represented Cincinnati in the past.\"[114] The Bengals' historic rivalry with the Cleveland Browns is often referred to as the \"Battle of Ohio\", started as the result of former Browns head coach and team founder Paul Brown starting the Bengals franchise after leaving the Browns.[115] The colors of each team are similar since Paul Brown chose the exact shade of orange used by the Browns for the Bengals, and the Bengals' original uniforms were identical to the Browns' uniforms, excluding the word \"Bengals\" on the helmet. The rivalry reached its peak during the 1980s when both teams were vying viciously for a spot in the playoffs. During the 1990s the rivalry also butted heads when Brown's sons were in charge of the day-to-day operations of the Bengals.[116] The Bengals lead the series 53–48 as of the end of the 2023 season.[117] The Bengals and Pittsburgh Steelers have played each other twice a year since becoming division rivals in 1970. This rivalry has gained intensity since the 2000s, as the teams have met twice in the playoffs, with both games being marked by hard hits and injuries with the most infamous example occurring in the 2005 playoffs.[118][119][120] The Steelers lead the overall series 70–39 and the postseason series 2–0.[121] However, the Steelers have been more dominant recently, posting a record of 28–7 since 2004, when they drafted Roethlisberger. There were two times that the rivalry has met during the playoffs: the Wild Card rounds of 2005 and 2015, with the Steelers winning both meetings at Cincinnati. The 2005 game is marked as a special time in the rivalry because this is when Steelers defensive tackle Kimo Von Oelhoffen injured Bengals quarterback Carson Palmer,[122] while the 2015 game is also special because Bengals running back Jeremy Hill fumbled the ball in the waning minutes when the Bengals had a 16–15 lead over the Steelers to give the latter one last chance. They used that chance wisely as they drove down the field (with the help of two costly personal fouls by the Bengals) and kicked a game-winning field goal.[123] The Bengals' rivalry with the Baltimore Ravens began when the original Browns franchise relocated to Baltimore to become the Ravens. Since then, the rivalry heated up when longtime Ravens defensive coordinator Marvin Lewis was hired as the head coach of the Bengals. The Ravens lead the all-time series 30–27 as of the 2023 season.[124] The Bengals won the only playoff meeting in the 2022 AFC Wild Card round.[125] The Joe Burrow-led Bengals have developed a recent rivalry with the Kansas City Chiefs, with Burrow being the only AFC quarterback to date to hold a winning record against Mahomes.[126] As of the 2023 season, the Bengals lead the all-time series 18–16.[127] The Bengals have played the Titans more than any non-divisional opponent by a significant margin. The Titans lead the all-time series 41–37–1.[128] A no-huddle offense was commonly used by all teams when time in the game was running low. However, Sam Wyche, the head coach of the Bengals in 1988, along with offensive coordinator Bruce Coslet, made the high-paced offense the standard modality for the ball club regardless of time remaining. By quickly substituting and setting up for the next play—often within 5–10 seconds after the last play despite being afforded 45 seconds—the Bengals hindered the other team's defense from substituting situational players, regrouping for tactics, and resting. In response, the NFL instituted rules allowing the defense ample time for substitutions when offensive substitutions were made. The hurry-up tactic was used by the franchise during the late 1980s while Sam Wyche was the coach. A rival for AFC supremacy during this time was the Buffalo Bills, coached by Marv Levy, who also used a version of the no-huddle offense starting with the 1989 season. The Bengals had beaten the Bills three times in 1988 (pre-season, regular season, and the AFC Championship Game). Marv Levy threatened to fake injuries if the Bengals used the \"no-huddle\" in the AFC Championship. Wyche was notified that the commissioner had ordered the \"no-huddle\" illegal for the game. The official notified Wyche and the Bengals' team just two hours before the game kickoff.[129] Wyche asked to talk directly to the commissioner and word immediately came back that the \"no-huddle\" would not be penalized. Levy did not have his players' fake injuries in the game but installed his version the next year, 1989. The Bengals first used the \"no-huddle\" in 1984.[130] Most of the high-profile games (the various games for AFC titles and regular-season games) between the two led to these changes in NFL rules. Wyche also first used the timeout periods as an opportunity to bring his entire team to the sideline to talk to all eleven players, plus substitutes, at one time. This allowed trainers time to treat a cut or bruise and equipment managers time to repair an equipment defect. The West Coast offense is the popular name for the high-percentage passing scheme designed by former Bengals assistant Bill Walsh.[131] Walsh formulated what has become popularly known as the West Coast offense during his tenure as assistant coach for the Cincinnati Bengals from 1968 to 1975, while working under the tutelage of Brown (and before embarking on his legendary coaching tenure with the San Francisco 49ers in the 1980s). Bengals quarterback Virgil Carter was the first player to successfully implement Walsh's system, leading the NFL in pass completion percentage in 1971.[132] Ken Anderson replaced Carter as Cincinnati's starting quarterback in 1972 and was even more successful. In 1975 he would bring widespread recognition to the West Coast offense as well as to the Cincinnati team and its quarterback in a nationally televised Monday night contest between the Bengals and a Buffalo Bills team built around the running game of star player O. J. Simpson. Anderson's 447 passing yards were enough to overcome Simpson's 197 yards on the ground in a game that proved a milestone, providing a striking contrast between the \"old\" game of defense-minded football and the new game of higher scores and more action through a sophisticated aerial attack.[133] The game, in effect, offered its viewers a glimpse of the future of professional football. Anderson, who was drafted by Paul Brown in 1971 and installed as starting quarterback in 1972, made four trips to the Pro Bowl, won four passing titles, was named NFL MVP in 1981, and set the record for completion percentage in a single season in 1982 with 70.66%. Defeated frequently during the 1970s by the Pittsburgh Steelers, a team that won four Super Bowls with 9 future Hall of Fame players, the Bengals under Anderson and head coach Forrest Gregg would finally break through the Steel Curtain, defeating the Steelers during both of their meetings in 1980 and again in 1981. Anderson, who had been named the \"team franchise\" by Bengal tight end Bob Trumpy, would ultimately prove his worth with a career record of 91 wins and 81 losses.[134] The defense created to combat the West Coast offense also came from Cincinnati. Then-Bengals defensive coordinator Dick LeBeau (who later served as the team's head coach from 2000 to 2002) created the zone blitz in the 1980s in response to the West Coast offense.[135] Running backs (RB) Wide receivers (WR) Tight ends (TE) Defensive linemen (DL) Defensive backs (DB) Special teams Reserve 52 active, 13 reserve, 14 practice squad In addition, Despite not being formally retired, the Bengals have certain numbers that are in limited circulation: There are four members of the Hall of Fame that have spent some portion of their career with the Bengals, but only Anthony Muñoz and Ken Riley spent their entire playing careers with the Bengals. Listed below are only Hall of Famers whose induction includes their tenure with the Bengals. Bengals founder and first coach Paul Brown is in the Hall of Fame, but was inducted before founding the team and is not credited as a Bengals Hall of Famer. Additionally, the Bengals have had two head coaches, Forrest Gregg and Dick LeBeau inducted for their playing career. In 2007, in celebration of their 40th anniversary the Bengals named an all-time team voted on by the fans.[148] Source:[149] The Bengals announced they would begin a Ring of Honor in 2021.[150] The inaugural class included Pro Football Hall of Fame tackle Anthony Muñoz and Paul Brown, who was the franchise's founder and first coach,[151] with Ken Anderson and Ken Riley added after a season ticket holder vote.[152] *Posthumous induction → Coaching staff → Front office → More NFL staffs The Bengals contract with iHeartMedia as their radio partner,[153] with their flagship radio stations being WCKY (1530) and WEBN (102.7 FM), along with WLW (700) if not in conflict with the Reds. Most preseason and regular season games, are telecast on WKRC-TV, channel 12, the CBS affiliate. Mike Watts and Anthony Muñoz are the TV announcers for preseason games, with Mike Valpredo as the sideline reporter.[154] Games that feature an NFC opponent playing at Paycor Stadium will be televised on WXIX, channel 19, the local Fox affiliate. WLWT-TV airs games when the Bengals are featured on Sunday Night Football. The radio broadcasting crew consists of Dan Hoard (play-by-play), and Dave Lapham (analyst).[155] \"The Bengal Growl\" is the Bengals fight song. It was written by Bengals entertainment director George \"Red\" Bird upon the team's founding in 1968. Bird had been friends with Paul Brown for over 30 years. The two had met at Massillon Washington High School when Brown was head football coach and Bird was director of the famed Massillon Tiger Swing Band. Bird had served as the Browns' music and entertainment director in 1946, and kept that role until Brown convinced him to come to Cincinnati in 1968. His first task was to pen a fight song along the lines of the Browns' fight song, \"Hi! O-Hi-O for Cleveland!\" The song remains very popular among Bengals fans, who are known to belt out the song at \"Bengals backer\" bars all over the country. In 2021, Elizabeth Blackburn, now the team's head of strategy and fan engagement, told The Athletic recalled stopping at one such bar in San Francisco during the 2015 playoffs, and was surprised to hear the viewers break out into the song. As a measure of how popular the song remains among the Bengals fan base, when Blackburn wrote an editorial on her efforts to overhaul the team's image for the Bengals Web site, Blackburn specifically mentioned that the song was not going anywhere.[156] \"Welcome to the Jungle\" is also a fight song for the Bengals.[157][158] The song is mainly played before kick-offs to intimidate visiting teams. \"Who Dey?!\" is the name of a chant of support by fans of the Cincinnati Bengals, in use since the 1980s. The entire chant is: \"Who dey, who dey, who dey think gonna beat dem Bengals?\"[159] The answer screamed in unison, \"Nobody.\" Sometimes fans will instead shout \"Who Dey?\" to represent the entire cheer. \"Who Dey\" is also the name of the team's mascot, a Bengal tiger.[110] Saying \"Who Dey\" at Bengals games is steeped in local beer lore. Hudy, a leading product of Hudepohl Brewing Company 1978 through the late 1980s, bears a phonetic similarity to the \"Who Dey\" chant. Beer vendors who carried full cases of bottled local beer up and down the steep upper stairs of what was then Riverfront Stadium would call out \"If Hudy\", \"Burger\" and other local beer names. Raucous fans would often chant back and forth with them as the vendors called out. During the 1980 season, the banter with the Hudepohl vendors grew organically into the now famous (Hu-Dey) -Who They?- chant.[160] The full Who Dey chant was first known to be used by fans of the 1980 Cincinnati Bengals.[161] While the origin of the chant is disputed, one possible source for the chant is a 1980 commercial for (the now-defunct) Red Frazier Ford of Cincinnati, which used this tagline: \"Who's going to give you a better deal than Red Frazier?...Nobody!\" Cincinnati fans who had seen the commercial many times may have just copied it when cheering.[162] The chant bears some similarities to the phrase \"Who Dat?\", which was officially adopted by the New Orleans Saints in 1983 but had been used by Louisiana's high school team fans for some time. The saying \"Who Dat?\" originated in minstrel shows and vaudeville acts in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, then it was taken up by New Orleans Jazz and various Big band folks in the 1920s and 1930s. In the late 1960s, local Louisiana High Schools, St. Augustine High School and Patterson High School reportedly have been using the cheer and Gulf Coast fans of Alcorn State University and Louisiana State University picked up the cheer in the 1970s. Southern University in Baton Rouge, Louisiana claims to have originated the cheer in the late 1960s in their version: \"Who dat talking 'bout beating dem Jags?\"[163]",

The black, fatter guy from NFL Tonight (I think..) says it that way, and he says Cincy is his home town. I think the guys on Sportscenter say it that way too, it's so annoying! Well it may be physically difficult for some people to pronounce it correctly. Yes, Lita, you are speaking of Tom Jackson, and that is ironic for him to do speak it in such a manner when he lives here, but oh well. It is a hard word to say correctly, just by it's spelling, so I don't mind. I'm glad their actually being talked about on TV, even with the mispronunciation.

I too was born and raised in Northern Kentucky, (Erlanger) Spent a year after high school at Northern Kentucky University, served in the Marine Corps after that with Col. Oliver North, and now living in Northern Arizona and still rooting for the Bengals to win the AFC... ...North. Sorry got on a roll there. Anyway they pronounce it weird all over. Just thank God it ain't \"The Bungles\" anymore! BANGals, seems to me to be just a regionalism. As for the BINGles...I think it's just pure laziness, and I don't tolerate it. I always say \"It's BENGals, not BINGles...\" Which, in turn is usually met with massive rolling of the eyes. I hate it the most when people call them the Bangles, well because it just isn't right and it reminds me too much of.................................................................. I pronounce it ( Bengulls)... and we are sorry for that Alright, I lived in Northern Kentucky my whole life and we are sorry for that As for the BINGles...I think it's just pure laziness, and I don't tolerate it. I always say \"It's BENGals, not BINGles...\" Which, in turn is usually met with massive rolling of the eyes. agreed 100% BW Tom Jakcson says it that ways probably cause he was told to. Bangals...is a Northern Kentucky, Norwood and Hamiltucky pronunciation of our beloved team. Alright, I lived in Northern Kentucky my whole life and we are sorry for that I'm damn proud about being from Kentucky! It's sad to hear Ohioians seemingly looking down their nose at their betters to the south. What's even sadder is that the State of Ohio doesn't even own the River it's freaking named after! Talk about sloppy seconds from the south. Sort of off topic warning: I once met a client who stated she was a linquist. Sadly, she wasn't very cunning. That said, while we talked about her chosen profession she informed me that within 5 minutes she could tell I wasn't from Southern California. I didn't doubt her, but I did ask her how she knew. She said I pronounced the word similar incorrectly....as if it were spelled simular. Then she blew what's left of my mind by claiming she could guess within a couple hundred miles where I was from. First she said the southern Ohio area, then narrowed it down by guessing I was from somewhere near Dayton. Boom. My mind was blown. Years later I was watching a news story about a massive fireworks explosion in the Cincy area. As a witness was being interviewed I was struck by the way he pronounced the word similar. Yup, he said the word as if it were spelled simular. But wait, there's more to this story than that. As the witness was shown walking away from the camera, and I noticed he wasn't wearing any shoes. Thus, I concluded that he wasn't one of my kind. Instead, I believe he was a lowly Hill-tuckian. BTW, when I say the word Bengal I pronounce it.....undefeated. I once met a client who stated she was a linquist. Sadly, she wasn't very cunning. That said, while we talked about her chosen profession she informed me that within 5 minutes she could tell I wasn't from Southern California. I didn't doubt her, but I did ask her how she knew. She said I pronounced the word similar incorrectly....as if it were spelled simular. Then she blew what's left of my mind by claiming she could guess within a couple hundred miles where I was from. First she said the southern Ohio area, then narrowed it down by guessing I was from somewhere near Dayton. Boom. My mind was blown.

I call the Dayton area home, and I must say that I've never heard the word \"similar\" pronounced with a \"u\" sound. I'm not calling you a liar, of course, but that is interesting. I believe she was a linguist, but I bet she's been here before. Nobody from the southern California area has even heard of Dayton, much less knows the dialect. Then again, that's her job, and what would I know about that? Not too much. My Sister calls them the Bing-gals. She was also the one that came up with such gems as: 'why does everyone have to tackle him, why doesn't just one guy tackle him'. And 'How come everyone doesn't get to throw the ball'. You have to love Thanksgiving... 'why does everyone have to tackle him, why doesn't just one guy tackle him'. And 'How come everyone doesn't get to throw the ball'. You have to love Thanksgiving... I'm familiar with this humor. My mother: \"Why does he keep running right into all those big guys???\" \"Why do all the penalties go on MY team???\" My brother: \"I would just form a human pyramid over the lineman after the hike, and have the ball carrier on top so he can jump over the whole defense\" \"I would give the lightest guy on the team the ball, and have the strongest guy throw him downfield\" \"I would form a circular barrier of huge guys around the ballcarrier, and have a battering ram of people all the way to the endzone.\" It's \"Simuhliar\" not \"Simooliar\", silly. I think I say it \"Simliar\". hehe 'why does everyone have to tackle him, why doesn't just one guy tackle him'. And 'How come everyone doesn't get to throw the ball'. You have to love Thanksgiving... That is so funny JET. I bout fell out of my chair...You got to love em though... I've never heard the sim-u-lar pronouciation before, but I've never listened for it. My grandparents live in the Dayton area and I had an uncle who lived there as well. The one pronounciation that drives me insane is when people say \"Cincinnata\" instead of \"Cincinnati.\" There are times that I just want to scream \"The world doesn't end in a freakin A\" You can post now and register later.

                "content": "Manchester United Football Club, commonly referred to as Man United (often stylised as Man Utd) or simply United, is a professional football club based in Old Trafford, Greater Manchester, England. They compete in the Premier League, the top tier of English football. Nicknamed the Red Devils, they were founded as Newton Heath LYR Football Club in 1878, but changed their name to Manchester United in 1902. After a spell playing in Clayton, Manchester, the club moved to their current stadium, Old Trafford, in 1910. Domestically, Manchester United have won a record 20 top-flight league titles, 13 FA Cups, 6 League Cups and a record 21 FA Community Shields. Additionally, in international football, they have won the European Cup/UEFA Champions League three times, and the UEFA Europa League, the UEFA Cup Winners' Cup, the UEFA Super Cup, the Intercontinental Cup and the FIFA Club World Cup once each.[7][8] Appointed as manager in 1945, Matt Busby built a team with an average age of just 22 nicknamed the Busby Babes that won successive league titles in the 1950s and became the first English club to compete in the European Cup. Eight players were killed in the Munich air disaster, but Busby rebuilt the team around star players George Best, Denis Law and Bobby Charlton – known as the United Trinity. They won two more league titles before becoming the first English club to win the European Cup in 1968. After Busby's retirement, Manchester United were unable to produce sustained success until the arrival of Alex Ferguson, who became the club's longest-serving and most successful manager, winning 38 trophies including 13 league titles, five FA Cups and two Champions League titles between 1986 and 2013.[9] In the 1998–99 season, under Ferguson, the club became the first in the history of English football to achieve the continental treble of the Premier League, FA Cup and UEFA Champions League.[10] In winning the UEFA Europa League under José Mourinho in 2016–17, they became one of five clubs to have won the original three main UEFA club competitions (the Champions League, Europa League and Cup Winners' Cup). Manchester United are one of the most widely supported football clubs in the world[11][12] and have rivalries with Liverpool, Manchester City, Arsenal and Leeds United. Manchester United were the highest-earning football club in the world for 2016–17, with an annual revenue of €676.3 million,[13] and the world's third-most-valuable football club in 2019, valued at £3.15 billion ($3.81 billion).[14] After being floated on the London Stock Exchange in 1991, the club was taken private in 2005 after a purchase by American businessman Malcolm Glazer valued at almost £800 million, of which over £500 million of borrowed money became the club's debt.[15] From 2012, some shares of the club were listed on the New York Stock Exchange, although the Glazer family retains overall ownership and control of the club. Manchester United were formed in 1878 as Newton Heath LYR Football Club by the Carriage and Wagon department of the Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway (LYR) depot at Newton Heath.[16] The team initially played games against other departments and railway companies, but on 20 November 1880, they competed in their first recorded match; wearing the colours of the railway company – green and gold – they were defeated 6–0 by Bolton Wanderers' reserve team.[17] By 1888, the club had become a founding member of The Combination, a regional football league. Following the league's dissolution after only one season, Newton Heath joined the newly formed Football Alliance, which ran for three seasons before being merged with The Football League. This resulted in the club starting the 1892–93 season in the First Division, by which time it had become independent of the railway company and dropped the \"LYR\" from its name.[16] After two seasons, the club was relegated to the Second Division.[16] In January 1902, with debts of £2,670 – equivalent to £370,000 in 2024[nb 1] – the club was served with a winding-up order.[18] Captain Harry Stafford found four local businessmen, including John Henry Davies (who became club president), each willing to invest £500 in return for a direct interest in running the club and who subsequently changed the name;[19] on 24 April 1902, Manchester United was officially born.[20][nb 2] Under Ernest Mangnall, who assumed managerial duties in 1903, Manchester United finished as Second Division runners-up in 1906 and secured promotion to the First Division, which they won in 1908 – the club's first league title. The following season began with victory in the first ever Charity Shield[21] and ended with the club's first FA Cup title. Mangnall was considered a significant influence behind the team's move to Old Trafford in 1910, and Manchester United won the First Division for the second time in 1911.[22] At the end of the following season, however, Mangnall left the club to join Manchester City.[23] In 1922, three years after the resumption of football following the First World War, the club was relegated to the Second Division, where it remained until regaining promotion in 1925. Relegated again in 1931, Manchester United became a yo-yo club, achieving its all-time lowest position of 20th place in the Second Division in 1934, under secretary-manager Scott Duncan, narrowly avoiding relegation to the Third Division. Two years later, Duncan led the club to promotion before another relegation followed in 1937, which led to his resignation in November of that year. Following the death of principal benefactor John Henry Davies in October 1927, the club's finances deteriorated to the extent that Manchester United would likely have gone bankrupt had it not been for James W. Gibson, who, in December 1931, invested £2,000 and assumed control of the club.[24] In the 1938–39 season, the last year of football before the Second World War, the club finished 14th in the First Division.[24] In October 1945, the impending resumption of football after the war led to the managerial appointment of Matt Busby, who demanded an unprecedented level of control over team selection, player transfers and training sessions.[25] Busby led the team to second-place league finishes in 1947, 1948 and 1949, and to FA Cup victory in 1948. In 1952, the club won the First Division, its first league title for 41 years.[26] They then won back-to-back league titles in 1956 and 1957; the squad, who had an average age of 22, were nicknamed \"the Busby Babes\" by the media, a testament to Busby's faith in his youth players.[27] In 1957, Manchester United became the first English team to compete in the European Cup, despite objections from The Football League, who had denied Chelsea the same opportunity the previous season.[28] En route to the semi-final, which they lost to Real Madrid, the team recorded a 10–0 victory over Belgian champions Anderlecht, which remains the club's biggest victory on record.[29] The following season, on the way home from a European Cup quarter-final victory against Red Star Belgrade, the aircraft carrying the Manchester United players, officials and journalists crashed while attempting to take off after refuelling in Munich, Germany. The Munich air disaster of 6 February 1958 claimed 23 lives, including those of eight players – Geoff Bent, Roger Byrne, Eddie Colman, Duncan Edwards, Mark Jones, David Pegg, Tommy Taylor and Billy Whelan – and injured several more.[30][31] Assistant manager Jimmy Murphy took over as manager while Busby recovered from his injuries and the club's makeshift side reached the FA Cup final, which they lost to Bolton Wanderers. In recognition of the team's tragedy, UEFA invited the club to compete in the 1958–59 European Cup alongside eventual League champions Wolverhampton Wanderers. Despite approval from The Football Association, The Football League determined that the club should not enter the competition, since it had not qualified.[32][33] Busby rebuilt the team through the 1960s by signing players such as Denis Law and Pat Crerand, who combined with the next generation of youth players – including George Best – to win the FA Cup in 1963. Busby rested several key players for the League game before the Cup Final which gave Dennis Walker the chance to make his debut against Nottingham Forest on 20 May. Walker thus became the first Black player to represent United.[34] The following season, they finished second in the league, then won the title in 1965 and 1967. In 1968, Manchester United became the first English club to win the European Cup, beating Benfica 4–1 in the final[35] with a team that contained three European Footballers of the Year: Bobby Charlton, Denis Law and George Best.[36] They then represented Europe in the 1968 Intercontinental Cup against Estudiantes of Argentina, but defeat in the first leg in Buenos Aires meant a 1–1 draw at Old Trafford three weeks later was not enough to claim the title. Busby resigned as manager in 1969 before being replaced by the reserve team coach, former Manchester United player Wilf McGuinness.[37] Following an eighth-place finish in the 1969–70 season and a poor start to the 1970–71 season, Busby was persuaded to temporarily resume managerial duties, and McGuinness returned to his position as reserve team coach. In June 1971, Frank O'Farrell was appointed as manager, but lasted less than 18 months before being replaced by Tommy Docherty in December 1972.[39] Docherty saved Manchester United from relegation that season, only to see them relegated in 1974; by that time the trio of Best, Law, and Charlton had left the club.[35] The team won promotion at the first attempt and reached the FA Cup final in 1976, but were beaten by Southampton. They reached the final again in 1977, beating Liverpool 2–1. Docherty was dismissed shortly afterwards, following the revelation of his affair with the club physiotherapist's wife.[37][40] Dave Sexton replaced Docherty as manager in the summer of 1977. Despite major signings, including Joe Jordan, Gordon McQueen, Gary Bailey, and Ray Wilkins, the team failed to win any trophies; they finished second in 1979–80 and lost to Arsenal in the 1979 FA Cup final. Sexton was dismissed in 1981, even though the team won the last seven games under his direction.[41] He was replaced by Ron Atkinson, who immediately broke the British record transfer fee to sign Bryan Robson from his former club West Bromwich Albion. Under Atkinson, Manchester United won the FA Cup in 1983 and 1985 and beat rivals Liverpool to win the 1983 Charity Shield. In 1985–86, after 13 wins and two draws in its first 15 matches, the club was favourite to win the league but finished in fourth place. The following season, with the club in danger of relegation by November, Atkinson was dismissed.[42] Alex Ferguson and his assistant Archie Knox arrived from Aberdeen on the day of Atkinson's dismissal,[43] and guided the club to an 11th-place finish in the league.[44] Despite a second-place finish in 1987–88, the club was back in 11th place the following season.[45] Reportedly on the verge of being dismissed, Ferguson's job was saved by victory over Crystal Palace in the 1990 FA Cup final.[46][47] The following season, Manchester United claimed their first UEFA Cup Winners' Cup title. That triumph allowed the club to compete in the European Super Cup for the first time, where United beat European Cup holders Red Star Belgrade 1–0 at Old Trafford. The club appeared in two consecutive League Cup finals in 1991 and 1992, beating Nottingham Forest 1–0 in the second to win that competition for the first time as well.[42] In 1993, in the first season of the newly founded Premier League, the club won their first league title since 1967, and a year later, for the first time since 1957, they won a second consecutive title – alongside the FA Cup – to complete the first \"Double\" in the club's history.[42] United then became the first English club to do the Double twice when they won both competitions again in 1995–96,[48] before retaining the league title once more in 1996–97 with a game to spare.[49] In the 1998–99 season, Manchester United became the first team to win the Premier League, FA Cup and UEFA Champions League – \"The Treble\" – in the same season.[50] Trailing 1–0 going into injury time in the 1999 UEFA Champions League final, Teddy Sheringham and Ole Gunnar Solskjær scored late goals to claim a dramatic victory over Bayern Munich, in what is considered one of the greatest comebacks of all time.[51] That summer, Ferguson received a knighthood for his services to football.[52] In November 1999, the club became the only British team to ever win the Intercontinental Cup with a 1–0 victory over the strong 1999 Copa Libertadores winners Palmeiras in Tokyo. The Red Devils counted on an unexpected goalkeeper fail by future 2002 FIFA World Cup winner Marcos and a disallowed goal scored by Alex to win the game.[53] Manchester United won the league again in the 1999–2000 and 2000–01 seasons, becoming only the fourth club to win the English title three times in a row. The team finished third in 2001–02, before regaining the title in 2002–03.[55] They won the 2003–04 FA Cup, beating Millwall 3–0 in the final at the Millennium Stadium in Cardiff to lift the trophy for a record 11th time.[56] In the 2005–06 season, Manchester United failed to qualify for the knockout phase of the UEFA Champions League for the first time in over a decade,[57] but recovered to secure a second-place league finish and victory over Wigan Athletic in the 2006 Football League Cup final. The club regained the Premier League title in the 2006–07 season, before completing the European double in 2007–08 with a 6–5 penalty shoot-out victory over Chelsea in the 2008 UEFA Champions League final in Moscow to go with their 17th English league title. Ryan Giggs made a record 759th appearance for the club in that game, overtaking previous record holder Bobby Charlton.[58] In December 2008, the club became the first British team to win the FIFA Club World Cup after beating LDU Quito 1–0 in the final. Manchester United followed this with the 2008–09 Football League Cup, and its third successive Premier League title.[59][60] That summer, forward Cristiano Ronaldo was sold to Real Madrid for a world record £80 million.[61] In 2010, Manchester United defeated Aston Villa 2–1 at Wembley to retain the League Cup, its first successful defence of a knockout cup competition.[62] After finishing as runners-up to Chelsea in the 2009–10 season, United achieved a record 19th league title in 2010–11, securing the championship with a 1–1 away draw against Blackburn Rovers on 14 May 2011.[63] This was extended to 20 league titles in 2012–13, securing the championship with a 3–0 home win against Aston Villa on 22 April 2013.[64] On 8 May 2013, Ferguson announced that he was to retire as manager at the end of the football season, but would remain at the club as a director and club ambassador.[65][66] He retired as the most decorated manager in football history.[67][68] The club announced the next day that Everton manager David Moyes would replace him from 1 July, having signed a six-year contract.[69][70][71] Ryan Giggs took over as interim player-manager 10 months later, on 22 April 2014, when Moyes was sacked after a poor season in which the club failed to defend their Premier League title and failed to qualify for the UEFA Champions League for the first time since 1995–96.[72] They also failed to qualify for the UEFA Europa League, the first time Manchester United had not qualified for a European competition since 1990.[73] On 19 May 2014, it was confirmed that Louis van Gaal would replace Moyes as Manchester United manager on a three-year deal, with Giggs as his assistant.[74] Malcolm Glazer, the patriarch of the family that owns the club, died on 28 May 2014.[75] Under Van Gaal, United won a 12th FA Cup, but a disappointing slump in the middle of his second season led to rumours of the board sounding out potential replacements.[76] Van Gaal was ultimately sacked just two days after the cup final victory, with United having finished fifth in the league.[77] Former Porto, Chelsea, Inter Milan and Real Madrid manager José Mourinho was appointed in his place on 27 May 2016.[78] Mourinho signed a three-year contract, and in his first season won the FA Community Shield, EFL Cup and UEFA Europa League. Wayne Rooney scored his 250th goal for United, a stoppage-time equaliser in a league game against Stoke City in January 2017, surpassing Sir Bobby Charlton as the club's all-time top scorer.[79] The following season, United finished second in the league – their highest league placing since 2013 – but were still 19 points behind rivals Manchester City. Mourinho also guided the club to a 19th FA Cup final, but they lost 1–0 to Chelsea. On 18 December 2018, with United in sixth place in the Premier League table, 19 points behind leaders Liverpool and 11 points outside the Champions League places, Mourinho was sacked after 144 games in charge. The following day, former United striker Ole Gunnar Solskjær was appointed as caretaker manager until the end of the season.[80] On 28 March 2019, after winning 14 of his first 19 matches in charge, Solskjær was appointed permanent manager on a three-year deal.[81] On 18 April 2021, Manchester United announced they were joining 11 other European clubs as founding members of the European Super League, a proposed 20-team competition intended to rival the UEFA Champions League.[82] The announcement drew a significant backlash from supporters, other clubs, media partners, sponsors, players and the UK Government, forcing the club to withdraw just two days later.[83][84][85][86][87] The failure of the project led to the resignation of executive vice-chairman Ed Woodward, while resultant protests against Woodward and the Glazer family led to a pitch invasion ahead of a league match against Liverpool on 2 May 2021, which saw the first postponement of a Premier League game due to supporter protests in the competition's history.[88][89] On the pitch, United equalled their own record for the biggest win in Premier League history with a 9–0 win over Southampton on 2 February 2021,[90] but ended the season with defeat on penalties in the UEFA Europa League final against Villarreal, going four straight seasons without a trophy.[91] On 20 November 2021, Solskjær left his role as manager.[92] Former midfielder Michael Carrick took charge for the next three games, before the appointment of Ralf Rangnick as interim manager until the end of the season.[93] On 21 April 2022, Erik ten Hag was appointed as the manager from the end of the 2021–22 season, signing a contract until June 2025 with the option of extending for a further year.[94] Under Ten Hag, Manchester United won the 2022–23 EFL Cup, defeating Newcastle United in the final to end their longest period without a trophy since a six-year span between 1977 and 1983.[95][96] On 5 March 2023, the club suffered their joint-heaviest defeat, losing 7–0 to rivals Liverpool at Anfield.[97] At the end of the following season, the club finished eighth in the Premier League, their lowest league finish since the 1989–90 season, but went on to beat cross-city rivals Manchester City 2–1 in the FA Cup final, to win their 13th FA Cup title.[98] On 28 October 2024, Manchester United sacked Erik ten Hag after the club managed just three wins in the opening nine games of the Premier League season.[99] On 1 November 2024, Manchester United announced that they would be appointing Sporting CP boss Ruben Amorim as their new head coach from 11 November 2024.[100] The club crest is derived from the Manchester City Council coat of arms, although all that remains of it on the current crest is the ship in full sail.[101] The devil stems from the club's nickname \"The Red Devils\" inspired from Salford Rugby Club;[102][103] it was included on club programmes and scarves in the 1960s, and incorporated into the club crest in 1970, although the crest was not included on the chest of the shirt until 1971.[101] In 1975, the red devil (\"A devil facing the sinister guardant supporting with both hands a trident gules\") was granted as a heraldic badge by the College of Arms to the English Football League for use by Manchester United.[104] In 2023, the Red Devil motif alone, which had been used in promotional items and merchandise previously, was used as the sole badge on the Manchester United third kit. The existing crest remains on the home and away kits. Newton Heath's uniform in 1879, four years before the club played its first competitive match, has been documented as 'white with blue cord'.[105] A photograph of the Newton Heath team, taken in 1892, is believed to show the players wearing red-and-white quartered jerseys and navy blue knickerbockers.[106] Between 1894 and 1896, the players wore green and gold jerseys[106] which were replaced in 1896 by white shirts, which were worn with navy blue shorts.[106] After the name change in 1902, the club colours were changed to red shirts, white shorts, and black socks, which has become the standard Manchester United home kit.[106] Very few changes were made to the kit until 1922 when the club adopted white shirts bearing a deep red \"V\" around the neck, similar to the shirt worn in the 1909 FA Cup final. They remained part of their home kits until 1927.[106] For a period in 1934, the cherry and white hooped change shirt became the home colours, but the following season the red shirt was recalled after the club's lowest ever league placing of 20th in the Second Division and the hooped shirt dropped back to being the change.[106] The black socks were changed to white from 1959 to 1965, where they were replaced with red socks up until 1971 with white used on occasion, when the club reverted to black. Black shorts and white socks are sometimes worn with the home strip, most often in away games, if there is a clash with the opponent's kit. For 2018–19, black shorts and red socks became the primary choice for the home kit.[107] Since 1997–98, white socks have been the preferred choice for European games, which are typically played on weeknights, to aid with player visibility.[108] The current home kit is a red shirt with Adidas' trademark three stripes in red on the shoulders, white shorts, and black socks.[109] The Manchester United away strip has often been a white shirt, black shorts and white socks, but there have been several exceptions. These include an all-black strip with blue and gold trimmings between 1993 and 1995, the navy blue shirt with silver horizontal pinstripes worn during the 1999–2000 season,[110] and the 2011–12 away kit, which had a royal blue body and sleeves with hoops made of small midnight navy blue and black stripes, with black shorts and blue socks.[111] An all-grey away kit worn during the 1995–96 season was dropped after just five games; in its final outing against Southampton, Alex Ferguson instructed the team to change into the third kit during half-time. The reason for dropping it being that the players claimed to have trouble finding their teammates against the crowd, United failed to win a competitive game in the kit in five attempts.[112] In 2001, to celebrate 100 years as \"Manchester United\", a reversible white and gold away kit was released, although the actual match day shirts were not reversible.[113] The club's third kit is often all-blue; this was most recently the case during the 2014–15 season.[114] Exceptions include a green-and-gold halved shirt worn between 1992 and 1994, a blue-and-white striped shirt worn during the 1994–95 and 1995–96 seasons and once in 1996–97, an all-black kit worn during the Treble-winning 1998–99 season, and a white shirt with black-and-red horizontal pinstripes worn between 2003–04 and 2005–06.[115] From 2006–07 to 2013–14, the third kit was the previous season's away kit, albeit updated with the new club sponsor in 2006–07 and 2010–11, apart from the 2008–09 season, when an all-blue kit was launched to mark the 40th anniversary of the 1967–68 European Cup success.[116] Newton Heath initially played on a field on North Road, close to the railway yard; the original capacity was about 12,000, but club officials deemed the facilities inadequate for a club hoping to join The Football League.[117] Some expansion took place in 1887, and in 1891, Newton Heath used its minimal financial reserves to purchase two grandstands, each able to hold 1,000 spectators.[118] Although attendances were not recorded for many of the earliest matches at North Road, the highest documented attendance was approximately 15,000 for a First Division match against Sunderland on 4 March 1893.[119] A similar attendance was also recorded for a friendly match against Gorton Villa on 5 September 1889.[120] In June 1893, after the club was evicted from North Road by its owners, Manchester Deans and Canons, who felt it was inappropriate for the club to charge an entry fee to the ground, secretary A. H. Albut procured the use of the Bank Street ground in Clayton.[121] It initially had no stands, by the start of the 1893–94 season, two had been built; one spanning the full length of the pitch on one side and the other behind the goal at the \"Bradford end\". At the opposite end, the \"Clayton end\", the ground had been \"built up, thousands thus being provided for\".[121] Newton Heath's first league match at Bank Street was played against Burnley on 1 September 1893, when 10,000 people saw Alf Farman score a hat-trick, Newton Heath's only goals in a 3–2 win. The remaining stands were completed for the following league game against Nottingham Forest three weeks later.[121] In October 1895, before the visit of Manchester City, the club purchased a 2,000-capacity stand from the Broughton Rangers rugby league club, and put up another stand on the \"reserved side\" (as distinct from the \"popular side\"); however, weather restricted the attendance for the Manchester City match to just 12,000.[122] When the Bank Street ground was temporarily closed by bailiffs in 1902, club captain Harry Stafford raised enough money to pay for the club's next away game at Bristol City and found a temporary ground at Harpurhey for the next reserves game against Padiham.[123] Following financial investment, new club president John Henry Davies paid £500 for the erection of a new 1,000-seat stand at Bank Street.[124] Within four years, the stadium had cover on all four sides, as well as the ability to hold approximately 50,000 spectators, some of whom could watch from the viewing gallery atop the Main Stand.[124] Following Manchester United's first league title in 1908 and the FA Cup a year later, it was decided that Bank Street was too restrictive for Davies' ambition;[124] in February 1909, six weeks before the club's first FA Cup title, Old Trafford was named as the home of Manchester United, following the purchase of land for around £60,000. Architect Archibald Leitch was given a budget of £30,000 for construction; original plans called for seating capacity of 100,000, though budget constraints forced a revision to 77,000.[125][126] The building was constructed by Messrs Brameld and Smith of Manchester. The stadium's record attendance was registered on 25 March 1939, when an FA Cup semi-final between Wolverhampton Wanderers and Grimsby Town drew 76,962 spectators.[127] Bombing in the Second World War destroyed much of the stadium; the central tunnel in the South Stand was all that remained of that quarter. After the war, the club received compensation from the War Damage Commission in the amount of £22,278. While reconstruction took place, the team played its \"home\" games at Manchester City's Maine Road ground; Manchester United was charged £5,000 per year, plus a nominal percentage of gate receipts.[128] Later improvements included the addition of roofs, first to the Stretford End and then to the North and East Stands. The roofs were supported by pillars that obstructed many fans' views, and they were eventually replaced with a cantilevered structure. The Stretford End was the last stand to receive a cantilevered roof, completed in time for the 1993–94 season.[37] First used on 25 March 1957 and costing £40,000, four 180-foot (55 m) pylons were erected, each housing 54 individual floodlights. These were dismantled in 1987 and replaced by a lighting system embedded in the roof of each stand, which remains in use today.[129] The Taylor Report's requirement for an all-seater stadium lowered capacity at Old Trafford to around 44,000 by 1993. In 1995, the North Stand was redeveloped into three tiers, restoring capacity to approximately 55,000. At the end of the 1998–99 season, second tiers were added to the East and West Stands, raising capacity to around 67,000, and between July 2005 and May 2006, 8,000 more seats were added via second tiers in the north-west and north-east quadrants. Part of the new seating was used for the first time on 26 March 2006, when an attendance of 69,070 became a new Premier League record.[130] The record was pushed steadily upwards before reaching its peak on 31 March 2007, when 76,098 spectators saw Manchester United beat Blackburn Rovers 4–1, with just 114 seats (0.15 per cent of the total capacity of 76,212) unoccupied.[131] In 2009, reorganisation of the seating resulted in a reduction of capacity by 255 to 75,957.[132][133] Manchester United has the second highest average attendance among European football clubs, behind only Borussia Dortmund.[134][135][136] In 2021, United co-chairman Joel Glazer said that \"early-stage planning work\" for the redevelopment of Old Trafford was underway. This followed \"increasing criticism\" over the lack of development of the ground since 2006.[137] After the club's takeover by Sir Jim Ratcliffe in 2024, it emerged that plans were being made for the construction of a new, 100,000-capacity stadium near Old Trafford and that the current stadium would be downsized to serve as the home for the women's team and the club's academy.[138] In November 2024, it was revealed that the majority of fans surveyed are in favour of a new-build rather than redevelopment.[139] Manchester United is one of the most popular football clubs in the world, with one of the highest average home attendances in Europe.[140] The club states that its worldwide fan base includes more than 200 officially recognised branches of the Manchester United Supporters Club (MUSC), in at least 24 countries.[141] The club takes advantage of this support through its worldwide summer tours. Accountancy firm and sports industry consultants Deloitte estimate that Manchester United has 75 million fans worldwide.[11] The club has the third highest social media following in the world among sports teams (after Barcelona and Real Madrid), with over 82 million Facebook followers as of July 2023.[12][142] A 2014 study showed that Manchester United had the loudest fans in the Premier League.[143] Supporters are represented by two independent bodies; the Independent Manchester United Supporters' Association (IMUSA), which maintains close links to the club through the MUFC Fans Forum,[144] and the Manchester United Supporters' Trust (MUST). After the Glazer family's takeover in 2005, a group of fans formed a splinter club, F.C. United of Manchester. The West Stand of Old Trafford – the \"Stretford End\" – is the home end and the traditional source of the club's most vocal support.[145] Manchester United has high-profile rivalries with Liverpool and local neighbours Manchester City. The club has also had rivalries throughout its history with the likes of Arsenal, Leeds United and Chelsea.[146][147] The matches against Manchester City are known as the Manchester derby, as they are the two most important teams in the city of Manchester. It is considered one of the biggest local derbies in British football,[148] particularly after City's rise to prominence in the 2010s and the two clubs fighting for trophies, such as the league title in 2012 and 2013, as well as two consecutive FA Cup finals in 2023 and 2024.[149] The rivalry with Liverpool is rooted in competition between the cities during the Industrial Revolution, when Manchester was famous for its textile industry while Liverpool was a major port.[150] The two clubs are the most successful in the history of English football; between them they have won 39 league titles, 9 European Cups, 21 FA Cups, 16 League Cups, 4 UEFA Cup/Europa Leagues, 2 FIFA Club World Cups, 1 Intercontinental Cup, 37 FA Community Shields and 5 UEFA Super Cups.[7][151][152] Ranked the two biggest clubs in England by France Football magazine based on metrics such as fanbase and historical importance,[153] matches between Manchester United and Liverpool are considered to be the most famous fixture in English football and one of the biggest rivalries in the football world.[154][155][156][157] No player has been transferred between the clubs since 1964.[158] Former Manchester United manager Alex Ferguson said in 2002, \"My greatest challenge was knocking Liverpool right off their fucking perch\".[159] The \"Roses Rivalry\" with Leeds stems from the Wars of the Roses, fought between the House of Lancaster and the House of York, with Manchester United representing Lancashire and Leeds representing Yorkshire.[160] The rivalry with Arsenal arose from the numerous times the two teams battled for the Premier League title, especially under managers Alex Ferguson and Arsène Wenger, who also had a heated personal rivalry.[161] With 33 titles between them (20 for Manchester United, 13 for Arsenal), the fixture has been described as a \"blockbuster\" and the \"greatest\" rivalry in the history of the Premier League.[162][163] Manchester United has been described as a global brand; a 2011 report by Brand Finance, valued the club's trademarks and associated intellectual property at £412 million – an increase of £39 million on the previous year, valuing it at £11 million more than the second best brand, Real Madrid – and gave the brand a strength rating of AAA (Extremely Strong).[164] In July 2012, Manchester United was ranked first by Forbes magazine in its list of the ten most valuable sports team brands, valuing the Manchester United brand at $2.23 billion.[165] The club is ranked third in the Deloitte Football Money League (behind Real Madrid and Barcelona).[166] In January 2013, the club became the first sports team in the world to be valued at $3 billion.[167] Forbes magazine valued the club at $3.3 billion – $1.2 billion higher than the next most valuable sports team.[167] They were overtaken by Real Madrid for the next four years, but Manchester United returned to the top of the Forbes list in June 2017, with a valuation of $3.689 billion.[168] The core strength of Manchester United's global brand is often attributed to Matt Busby's rebuilding of the team and subsequent success following the Munich air disaster, which drew worldwide acclaim.[145] The \"iconic\" team included Bobby Charlton and Nobby Stiles (members of England's World Cup winning team), Denis Law and George Best. The attacking style of play adopted by this team (in contrast to the defensive-minded \"catenaccio\" approach favoured by the leading Italian teams of the era) \"captured the imagination of the English footballing public\".[169] Busby's team also became associated with the liberalisation of Western society during the 1960s; George Best, known as the \"Fifth Beatle\" for his iconic haircut, was the first footballer to significantly develop an off-the-field media profile.[169] As the second English football club to float on the London Stock Exchange in 1991, the club raised significant capital, with which it further developed its commercial strategy. The club's focus on commercial and sporting success brought significant profits in an industry often characterised by chronic losses.[170] The strength of the Manchester United brand was bolstered by intense off-the-field media attention to individual players, most notably David Beckham (who quickly developed his own global brand). This attention often generates greater interest in on-the-field activities, and hence generates sponsorship opportunities – the value of which is driven by television exposure.[171] During his time with the club, Beckham's popularity across Asia was integral to the club's commercial success in that part of the world.[172] Because higher league placement results in a greater share of television rights, success on the field generates greater income for the club. Since the inception of the Premier League, Manchester United has received the largest share of the revenue generated from the BSkyB broadcasting deal.[173] Manchester United has also consistently enjoyed the highest commercial income of any English club; in 2005–06, the club's commercial arm generated £51 million, compared to £42.5 million at Chelsea, £39.3 million at Liverpool, £34 million at Arsenal and £27.9 million at Newcastle United. A key sponsorship relationship was with sportswear company Nike, who managed the club's merchandising operation as part of a £303 million 13-year partnership between 2002 and 2015.[174] Through Manchester United Finance and the club's membership scheme, One United, those with an affinity for the club can purchase a range of branded goods and services. Additionally, Manchester United-branded media services – such as the club's dedicated television channel, MUTV – have allowed the club to expand its fan base to those beyond the reach of its Old Trafford stadium.[11] In an initial five-year deal worth £500,000, Sharp Electronics became the club's first shirt sponsor at the beginning of the 1982–83 season, a relationship that lasted until the end of the 1999–2000 season, when Vodafone agreed a four-year, £30 million deal.[176] Vodafone agreed to pay £36 million to extend the deal by four years, but after two seasons triggered a break clause in order to concentrate on its sponsorship of the Champions League.[176] To commence at the start of the 2006–07 season, American insurance corporation AIG agreed a four-year £56.5 million deal which in September 2006 became the most valuable in the world.[177][178] At the beginning of the 2010–11 season, American reinsurance company Aon became the club's principal sponsor in a four-year deal reputed to be worth approximately £80 million, making it the most lucrative shirt sponsorship deal in football history.[179] Manchester United announced their first training kit sponsor in August 2011, agreeing a four-year deal with DHL reported to be worth £40 million; it is believed to be the first instance of training kit sponsorship in English football.[180][181] The DHL contract lasted for over a year before the club bought back the contract in October 2012, although they remained the club's official logistics partner.[182] The contract for the training kit sponsorship was then sold to Aon in April 2013 for a deal worth £180 million over eight years, which also included purchasing the naming rights for the Trafford Training Centre.[183] The club's first kit manufacturer was Umbro, until a five-year deal was agreed with Admiral Sportswear in 1975.[184] Adidas won the contract in 1980,[185] before Umbro started a second spell in 1992.[186] That sponsorship lasted for ten years, followed by Nike's record-breaking £302.9 million deal, which lasted until 2015; 3.8 million replica shirts were sold in the first 22 months with the company.[187][188] In addition to Nike and Chevrolet, the club also has several lower-level \"platinum\" sponsors, including Aon and Budweiser.[189] On 30 July 2012, United signed a seven-year deal with American automotive corporation General Motors, which replaced Aon as the shirt sponsor from the 2014–15 season. The new $80m-a-year shirt deal is worth $559m over seven years and features the logo of General Motors brand Chevrolet.[190][191] Nike announced that they would not renew their kit supply deal with Manchester United after the 2014–15 season, citing rising costs.[192][193] Since the start of the 2015–16 season, Adidas has manufactured Manchester United's kit as part of a world-record 10-year deal worth a minimum of £750 million.[194][195] Plumbing products manufacturer Kohler became the club's first sleeve sponsor ahead of the 2018–19 season.[196] Manchester United and General Motors did not renew their sponsorship deal, and the club subsequently signed a five-year, £235 million sponsorship deal with TeamViewer ahead of the 2021–22 season.[197] At the end of the 2023–24 season, TeamViewer were replaced by Snapdragon, who agreed a deal worth more than £60 million a year to take over as the club's main sponsor.[198] In August 2024, Snapdragon's parent company Qualcomm triggered an option to extend the deal by two years, taking it through to 2029.[199] Originally funded by the Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway Company, the club became a limited company in 1892 and sold shares to local supporters for £1 via an application form.[19] In 1902, majority ownership passed to the four local businessmen who invested £500 to save the club from bankruptcy, including future club president John Henry Davies.[19] After his death in 1927, the club faced bankruptcy yet again, but was saved in December 1931 by James W. Gibson, who assumed control of the club after an investment of £2,000.[24] Gibson promoted his son, Alan, to the board in 1948,[200] but died three years later; the Gibson family retained ownership of the club through James' wife, Lillian,[201] but the position of chairman passed to former player Harold Hardman.[202] Promoted to the board a few days after the Munich air disaster, Louis Edwards, a friend of Matt Busby, began acquiring shares in the club; for an investment of approximately £40,000, he accumulated a 54 per cent shareholding and took control in January 1964.[203] When Lillian Gibson died in January 1971, her shares passed to Alan Gibson who sold a percentage of his shares to Louis Edwards' son, Martin, in 1978; Martin Edwards went on to become chairman upon his father's death in 1980.[204] Media tycoon Robert Maxwell attempted to buy the club in 1984, but did not meet Edwards' asking price.[204] In 1989, chairman Martin Edwards attempted to sell the club to Michael Knighton for £20 million, but the sale fell through and Knighton joined the board of directors instead.[204] Manchester United was floated on the stock market in June 1991 (raising £6.7 million),[205] and received yet another takeover bid in 1998, this time from Rupert Murdoch's British Sky Broadcasting Corporation. This resulted in the formation of Shareholders United Against Murdoch – now the Manchester United Supporters' Trust – who encouraged supporters to buy shares in the club in an attempt to block any hostile takeover. The Manchester United board accepted a £623 million offer,[206] but the takeover was blocked by the Monopolies and Mergers Commission at the final hurdle in April 1999.[207] A few years later, a power struggle emerged between the club's manager, Alex Ferguson, and his horse-racing partners, John Magnier and J. P. McManus, who had gradually become the majority shareholders. In a dispute that stemmed from contested ownership of the horse Rock of Gibraltar, Magnier and McManus attempted to have Ferguson removed from his position as manager, and the board responded by approaching investors to attempt to reduce the Irishmen's majority.[208] In May 2005, Malcolm Glazer purchased the 28.7 per cent stake held by McManus and Magnier, thus acquiring a controlling interest through his investment vehicle Red Football Ltd in a highly leveraged takeover valuing the club at approximately £800 million (then approx. $1.5 billion).[209] Once the purchase was complete, the club was taken off the stock exchange.[210] Much of the takeover money was borrowed by the Glazers; the debts were transferred to the club. As a result, the club went from being debt-free to being saddled with debts of £540 million, at interest rates of between 7% and 20%.[15][211][212] In July 2006, the club announced a £660 million debt refinancing package, resulting in a 30 per cent reduction in annual interest payments to £62 million a year.[213][214] In January 2010, with debts of £716.5 million ($1.17 billion),[215] Manchester United further refinanced through a bond issue worth £504 million, enabling them to pay off most of the £509 million owed to international banks.[216] The annual interest payable on the bonds – which were to mature on 1 February 2017 – is approximately £45 million per annum.[217] Despite restructuring, the club's debt prompted protests from fans on 23 January 2010, at Old Trafford and the club's Trafford Training Centre.[218][219] Supporter groups encouraged match-going fans to wear green and gold, the colours of Newton Heath. On 30 January, reports emerged that the Manchester United Supporters' Trust had held meetings with a group of wealthy fans, dubbed the \"Red Knights\", with plans to buying out the Glazers' controlling interest.[220] The club's debts reached a high of £777 million in June 2007.[221] In August 2011, the Glazers were believed to have approached Credit Suisse in preparation for a $1 billion (approx. £600 million) initial public offering (IPO) on the Singapore stock exchange that would value the club at more than £2 billion;[222] however, in July 2012, the club announced plans to list its IPO on the New York Stock Exchange instead.[223] Shares were originally set to go on sale for between $16 and $20 each, but the price was cut to $14 by the launch of the IPO on 10 August, following negative comments from Wall Street analysts and Facebook's disappointing stock market debut in May. Even after the cut, Manchester United was valued at $2.3 billion, making it the most valuable football club in the world.[224] The New York Stock Exchange allows for different shareholders to enjoy different voting rights over the club. Shares offered to the public (\"Class A\") had 10 times lesser voting rights than shares retained by the Glazers (\"Class B\").[225] Initially in 2012, only 10% of shares were offered to the public.[226] As of 2019, the Glazers retain ultimate control over the club, with over 70% of shares, and even higher voting power.[227] In 2012, The Guardian estimated that the club had paid a total of over £500 million in debt interest and other fees on behalf of the Glazers,[228] and in 2019, reported that the total sum paid by the club for such fees had risen to £1 billion.[212] At the end of 2019, the club had a net debt of nearly £400 million.[229] In 2023, the Glazers began soliciting bids for the sale of the club, and several bids were received. Sir Jim Ratcliffe, who owns Ineos, and Hamad bin Jassim bin Jaber Al Thani, a Qatari sheikh, were the only bidders who had publicly declared their interest in a controlling share of the club.[230] In March 2023, Finnish entrepreneur Thomas Zilliacus also made his interest in Manchester United public.[231] On 24 December 2023, it was announced that Ratcliffe had purchased 25 per cent of Manchester United, and that his Ineos Sport company was taking control of football operations.[232] The Glazers remain as majority shareholders.

Manchester United is one of the most successful clubs in Europe in terms of trophies won.[271] The club's first trophy was the Manchester Cup, which they won as Newton Heath LYR in 1886.[272] In 1908, the club won their first league title, and won the FA Cup for the first time the following year. Since then, they have gone on to win a record 20 top-division titles – including a record 13 Premier League titles – and their total of 13 FA Cups is second only to Arsenal (14). Those titles have meant the club has appeared a record 30 times in the FA Community Shield (formerly the FA Charity Shield), which is played at the start of each season between the winners of the league and FA Cup from the previous season; of those 30 appearances, Manchester United have won a record 21, including four times when the match was drawn and the trophy shared by the two clubs. The club had a successful period under the management of Matt Busby, starting with the FA Cup in 1948 and culminating with becoming the first English club to win the European Cup in 1968, winning five league titles and two FA Cups in the intervening years. The club's most successful decade, however, came in the 1990s under Alex Ferguson; five league titles, four FA Cups, one League Cup, five Charity Shields (one shared), one UEFA Champions League, one UEFA Cup Winners' Cup, one UEFA Super Cup and one Intercontinental Cup. The club has won the Double (winning the Premier League and FA Cup in the same season) three times; the second in 1995–96 saw them become the first club to do so twice, and it became referred to as the \"Double Double\".[273] United became the sole British club to win the Intercontinental Cup in 1999 and are one of only three British clubs to have won the FIFA Club World Cup, in 2008. In 1999, United became the first English club to win the Treble.[50] In 2017, United won the 2016–17 UEFA Europa League, beating Ajax in the final. In winning that title, United became the fifth club to have won the \"European Treble\" of European Cup/UEFA Champions League, Cup Winners' Cup, and UEFA Cup/Europa League after Juventus, Ajax, Bayern Munich and Chelsea.[274][275] The club's most recent trophy is the 2023–24 FA Cup.[276] Short competitions – such as the FA Charity/Community Shield, Intercontinental Cup (now defunct), FIFA Club World Cup or UEFA Super Cup – are not generally considered to contribute towards a Double or Treble.[277] Manchester United Supporters Club Ladies began operations in the late 1970s and was unofficially recognised as the club's senior women's team. They became founding members of the North West Women's Regional Football League in 1989.[278] The team made an official partnership with Manchester United in 2001, becoming the club's official women's team; however, in 2005, following Malcolm Glazer's takeover, the club was disbanded as it was seen to be \"unprofitable\".[279] In 2018, Manchester United formed a new women's football team, which entered the second division of women's football in England for their debut season. The women's football team won their first trophy on 12 May 2024 as they lifted the Women's FA Cup as they defeated Tottenham Hotspur 4–0.",

                "content": "If not listed, please contact your TV provider. CLEVELAND (AP) The only thing the Chiefs had to worry about in the final minutes Sunday was Patrick Mahomes' ankle. Mahomes threw two touchdown passes before limping off with an ankle injury in the fourth quarter, Xavier Worthy ran for a score and Kansas City finally had a relatively easy win, 21-7 over the mistake-prone Cleveland Browns. Mahomes connected for TDs in the first half with Juju Smith-Schuster and Noah Gray as the Chiefs (13-1) built a 21-0 lead and then slogged their way through an ugly second half. The defending Super Bowl champions have 10 wins by seven points or less, with six coming on the game's final play. Mahomes didn't finish the game, leaving when he got his ankle rolled up on while being tackled by Dalvin Tomlinson on a fourth-down incompletion. Carson Wentz replaced him for the final 5:23. Mahomes finished 19 of 38 for 159 yards. After the game, Mahomes said X-rays were negative. He said he would have lobbied harder to stay in if the Browns had gotten within one score. “We'll get into the rehab part, the treatment part and try to get back on a short week,” said Mahomes, noting the Chiefs will play again Saturday - the second of three games in 11 days. “With all the adrenaline from the game, it's hard to tell now (if he can play). Usually, it's the day after when you get a good sense of it.\" Before Wentz went in, Mahomes had his left ankle re-taped while on the bench. He walked gingerly off the field but didn't favor it while in the locker room or going to his postgame news conference. He was driven to the Chiefs' buses on a cart. Coach Andy Reid was relieved Mahomes was not more seriously hurt. “It's not broken, that's all I can tell you,” Reid said. “We'll have to see how it goes down the road.” The Browns (3-11) tried to put up a fight, but had six turnovers. Other than a 62-yard TD run from Jerome Ford, Cleveland had few offensive highlights and too many self-inflicted miscues. Jameis Winston threw more three interceptions - two in the end zone to give him eight in his last three games - and the Browns had two fumbles. The five turnovers made things much easier on Mahomes and the Chiefs, not that they needed a lot of help. Cleveland running back Nick Chubb suffered a broken foot. It's another setback for the star, who had a devastating knee injury last season. Winston was pulled after his third pick and replaced by second-year QB Dorian Thompson-Robinson, who also was intercepted. Coach Kevin Stefanski would not commit to a starter for next week. “You can not turn the ball over six times and expect to win,” Stefanski said. “At any level.” Cleveland's Jerry Jeudy had 11 catches for 108 yards and went over 1,000 for the season. The Chiefs' second TD - Mahomes' 6-yard pass to Gray with 4:46 left in the first half - came on the same play Browns star defensive end Myles Garrett left the field in extreme pain with an apparent eye injury. Garrett was rushing Mahomes and being blocked by Chiefs left tackle Joe Thuney when he suddenly stopped. The league's reigning Defensive Player of the Year immediately grabbed his face mask and pulled off his helmet, flinging it away before dropping to the turf. He was face down for several minutes before being helped off. As Garrett walked toward the locker room holding a towel to his face, Thuney came over and patted him on the back. Garrett was only gone for a short period before he ran back on to the field and finished the game. “Thank God, he's OK,” Stefanski said. The Chiefs took a 21-0 lead early in the third, capitalizing on a pick by Winston that went off Chubb's hands. Four plays later, Worthy took a deep pitch from Mahomes, turned the corner and scored. Kansas City's first score was set up by Cleveland's first turnover. After the Browns forced a three-and-out on Kansas City's first possession, Cleveland's James Proche II fumbled during a punt return and the Chiefs recovered at the 21. Mahomes then connected with Schuster for a 7-yard TD with 12:12 left in the first quarter. Taylor Swift ended her world tour. She decided not to hit the road in the NFL just yet. The pop superstar had been expected to attend the game to cheer on boyfriend Travis Kelce, the Chiefs tight end who grew up in Cleveland. But Swift, who turned 35 on Friday, wasn't on hand despite rumors she would make an appearance. Taylor has been at several Chiefs games in Kansas City the past two seasons since she began dating Kelce. Chiefs: S Chamarri Conner suffered a concussion while making a tackle in the second quarter. ... Kelce came up limping after an early play, but walked it off and stayed in. He left the locker room before reporters had access. Browns: CB Martin Emerson Jr. went to the locker room in the second quarter to be evaluated for a concussion. He did not return. ... DT Shelby Harris (elbow) went out in the second quarter. Chiefs: Host Houston on Dec. 21 before visiting Pittsburgh on Christmas Day. Browns: At Cincinnati on Sunday. --- AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL Copyright 2024 STATS LLC and Associated Press.

                "title": "Texan English - Wikipedia",
                "content": "Texan English is the array of American English dialects spoken in Texas, primarily falling under Southern U.S. English. As one nationwide study states, the typical Texan accent is a \"Southern accent with a twist\".[1] The \"twist\" refers to inland Southern U.S., older coastal Southern U.S., and South Midland U.S. accents mixing together, due to Texas's settlement history, as well as some lexical (vocabulary) influences from Mexican Spanish.[1] In fact, there is no single accent that covers all of Texas and few dialect features are unique to Texas alone. The newest and most innovative Southern U.S. accent features are best reported in Lubbock, Odessa, somewhat Houston and variably Dallas, though general features of this same dialect are found throughout the state, with several exceptions:[2] Abilene and somewhat Austin, Corpus Christi, and El Paso appear to align more with Midland U.S. accents than Southern ones. After Mexico gained independence in 1821, Mexican Texas legally permitted an influx of American settlers from the United States (mainly the Southern United States),[3] who within a decade outnumbered Hispanics in Texas,[4] making English as common as Spanish in central and north Texas. After Texas became an independent republic in 1836, English, with its distinct Southern influences, became the predominant language. After the Mexican Revolution of 1910–1920, a great number of Spanish-speaking Mexicans immigrated to Texas,[5][6] slowing down in the mid-20th century only to increase massively since 1990,[4] driving the development of a young Spanish-influenced dialect of Texan English: Tejano English. Some linguists draw dialect boundaries based upon phonological (sound-pattern) differences and others on lexical (word-usage) differences, leading to various views on how to classify dialects in Texas, often by dividing the state into an eastern versus a western dialect region.[7] 20th-century lexical research delimited Texas into two \"layers\": a southern Texas layer along the Mexican border with several Spanish loanwords and a central Texas layer settled by speakers of German and other European languages amidst a dominant Anglo-American settlement.[8][9] 21st-century phonological research reveals accents in Texas grouped in a way not easy to demarcate in terms of simple geographical boundaries,[10] and ongoing research reveals an urban–rural divide within Texas becoming more significant than a region-wide divide. Some linguists propose that urbanization, geographic and social mobility, and the mass media have homogenized the speech of the United States to a national norm.[11] Due to rapid urbanization, increasing dominance of high tech industries, and massive migrations, Texan speech has been reshaped as well, especially since 1990.[4] The general tendency in the phonology of Texas English is that mergers expand at the expense of distinctions, although traditional Southern-style Texan English preserved older phonemic distinctions.[11] Since much of the traditional regional vocabulary concerned farming and rural life, these terms are now disappearing or being replaced by technical terms.[11] As stated above, an internal rural–urban split is emerging within Texan English, meaning that most traditionally Southern (or stereotypically Texan) features remain strong in rural areas but tend to disappear in large urban areas and small cities.[4] The urban-rural linguistic split mainly affects Southern-style phonological phenomena like the pen-pin merger, the loss of the offglide in /aɪ/, and upgliding diphthongs, all of which are now recessive in metropolitan areas.[4] Meanwhile, some traditional grammatical features like y'all and fixin' to are expanding to non-natives in metropolitan areas as well as to the Hispanic population.[4] Essentially all Texas English phonologically falls under the Southeastern super-dialect region of the United States and often specifically the Southern dialect region, though noticeably not the cities of El Paso, Abilene, and Austin, and not particularly Houston and Corpus Christi.[2] Moreover, as of 21st-century research, the accents of Dallas show enormous variability.[10] Texas English may use many grammatical constructions typically associated with Southern U.S. English, including fixin' to,[19] multiple modals like might could and should oughta (reportedly used by every social class and, as of the 1980s Linguistic Atlas of the Gulf States, predominately in Upper and Lower East Texas), and plural verbal -s as in Our father and mother helps used by both Black and (somewhat less commonly) white Texans.[20] Many of these lexical terms are shared with the Midland and Southern dialects generally: Due to Spain's past influence in Texas, the vocabulary of Texas is much more influenced by Spanish than the vocabulary of other states. Some of the Texan terms that originated from Spanish are listed below.[22] Texan English frequently shows up in the media. In the 1950s and 1960s, many Hollywood western movies like Giant, Hud, and The Alamo were set in Texas. In those movies, Hollywood stars like James Dean, Rock Hudson, Dennis Hopper, Paul Newman, and Patricia Neal first had to learn how to speak Texan English and were instructed by native Texans. Also the famous TV series Dallas was often characterized by Texan English. Texas Instruments sometimes uses Texan English in its products. The TIFORM software for its TI-990 minicomputer sometimes displayed \"Shut 'er Down Clancey She's a-Pumping Mud\" as a humorous error message.[28] The Texan accent gained nationwide fame with the presidency of native Texan Lyndon B. Johnson. A lifelong resident of the Texas Hill Country, Johnson's thick accent was a large part of his personality and brought attention and fame to the dialect.[4][29] The Texan dialect gained fame again when George W. Bush started to serve as president. He had moved to West Texas at the age of two and has since retained the Texan dialect. In his speech, words like \"America\" sometimes sound like \"Amur-kah\" or even just like \"Mur-kah\".[4][30] Former U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson also speaks with a distinctively Texan accent.[31][32] Due to hundreds of years of Spanish and later Mexican intermingling, around 6 million (ca. 29%) people in Texas speak Spanish as the first language.[33] Recent data shows that Spanish is still increasing.[34] Since there are so many Spanish speakers in Texas, Spanish has a high impact on the English dialect spoken in Texas.[35] Many Mexican Americans in Texas speak their own variety of English which has many Spanish features (terms, phonology, etc.), Tejano English, a Chicano English dialect mostly spoken by working-class Mexican Americans. A very distinctive feature of that dialect is the /-t,d/-deletion in words which contain a /t/ or /d/ in the final position.[36]",

                "title": "Houston Texans - Wikipedia",
                "content": "The Houston Texans are a professional American football team based in Houston. The Texans compete in the National Football League as a member of the American Football Conference (AFC) South division. The team plays its home games at NRG Stadium. The Texans were founded in 1999, and were owned by Bob McNair until his death in 2018; following McNair's death, the majority ownership of the team went to his wife, Janice. The McNairs' son, Cal, became operating head of the franchise upon his father's death, and became principal owner when his mother transferred ownership to him in 2024.[7] The team replaced the city's previous NFL franchise, the Houston Oilers, who played from 1960 to 1996 before moving to Nashville and eventually becoming the Tennessee Titans. The Texans began play as an expansion team in 2002, making them the youngest franchise currently competing in the NFL.[8] While the Texans mainly struggled in the 2000s, their fortunes would take a turn for the better in the 2010s when they won their first division championship in 2011, clinching their first playoff berth.[9][10] The Texans have gone on to win seven more AFC South division championships in 2012, 2015, 2016, 2018, 2019, 2023, and 2024. They are the only franchise to have never won a road playoff game along with the only one to have never appeared in a conference championship game; they are also one of four franchises to have never appeared in a Super Bowl,[11] alongside the Cleveland Browns, Detroit Lions, and division rival Jacksonville Jaguars. According to an article by Forbes, the Houston Texans are the eleventh richest team in the NFL with a value of $4.7 billion in August 2022.[12] After the Texas Rangers won the 2023 World Series, the Houston Texans became the only big four professional sports franchise currently based in Texas without a championship. In 1997, Houston entrepreneur Bob McNair had a failed bid to bring a National Hockey League (NHL) expansion team to the city, and Bud Adams relocated the city's NFL team, the Houston Oilers, to Nashville, Tennessee, where they were renamed the Tennessee Titans in 1999. In 1996, the Cleveland Browns had controversially relocated to become the Baltimore Ravens. As part of the settlement between the NFL, the city of Cleveland, and the team owned by Art Modell, the league promised to return football to Cleveland within the next three years. In order to even out the franchises to 32, the NFL contemplated adding another expansion franchise. As Houston was one of the favorites for the extra franchise, along with Toronto and Los Angeles (the latter of whom had lost the Rams and the Raiders in 1995), McNair then decided to join the football project and founded Houston NFL Holdings with partner Steve Patterson. With Houston Livestock Show and Rodeo, they would push for a domed stadium as part of the bid to lure the NFL back to Houston. On October 6, 1999, the NFL awarded the 32nd team to Houston at a cost of $700 million.[1] The Houston Texans joined the NFL in the 2002 season, playing at the newly opened Reliant Stadium under head coach Dom Capers.[13] With their opening game victory over the Dallas Cowboys on September 8, 2002, the Texans became the first expansion team to win its opening game since the Minnesota Vikings beat the Chicago Bears in 1961.[14] The Texans went 4–12 and finished last in the AFC South in their debut season.[15] The team improved to a 5–11 mark in the 2003 season.[16] The team continued to make progress with a 7–9 record in the 2004 season.[17] In the 2005 season, the Texans fell to a 2–14 record for the worst mark in the league.[18] Following the end of the season, the team fired Capers as head coach.[19] They earned the top pick in the 2006 NFL Draft.[20] While the team struggled in its early seasons, results began to improve when native Houstonian Gary Kubiak became the head coach in 2006.[21] The Texans finished with a .500 season (8–8) in 2007 and 2008, and nearly qualified for the 2009–10 playoffs with a 9–7 result in 2009. The Texans started the 2010 season on a 4–2 record going into a Week 7 bye week, but promptly collapsed 2–8 in the second half of the season, finishing 6–10. In the 2011 NFL draft, the Texans acquired Wisconsin star defensive end J. J. Watt 11th overall. The following season, former Cowboys head coach Wade Phillips was hired as the defensive coordinator for the Texans, and the improved defense led to them finishing 10–6, winning their first AFC South title.[22] The Texans then beat wild card Cincinnati Bengals 31–10 in the first round of the 2011–12 playoffs,[23] before a 20–13 defeat by the Ravens in the Divisional Round.[24] The Texans surged as the team to beat in the AFC South in 2012, starting 5–0 and holding an 11–1 record by week 14. However, they lost three of their last four games to finish 12–4; beating the rival Indianapolis Colts in that four-game stretch allowing them to clinch their 2nd AFC South title. The Texans beat the Bengals again in the wild-card round,[25] but they lost in the Divisional Round to the New England Patriots.[26] In the 2013 NFL draft, the Texans acquired Clemson wide receiver DeAndre Hopkins 27th overall.[27] In 2013, the Texans started 2–0 but went into a tailspin and lost every game afterwards.[28] Kubiak was fired as head coach after being swept by the rival Jacksonville Jaguars, who themselves started 0–8.[29] Wade Phillips filled in as head coach, but the Texans' poor form did not change, and they finished 2–14, tying, with 2005, their worst record in franchise history.[30] The 14-game losing streak is the worst in franchise history. The Texans entered the 2014 season with a 14-game losing streak. Former Penn State head coach Bill O'Brien became the Texans' new head coach, and the third in franchise history, during the offseason.[31][32] In 2014, the Texans won three of their first four games, defeating the Redskins in the season opener while ending the losing streak, the Raiders, and the Bills, losing to the New York Giants. They lost three of their next four games, losing to the Dallas Cowboys, the Indianapolis Colts, and the Pittsburgh Steelers, respectively. The Texans went on to finish 9–7 in the 2014 season and barely missed the playoffs.[33] In the 2015 season, they were featured on HBO, on the show \"Hard Knocks\".[34] That year, the Texans started with a 2–5 record. Quarterback Ryan Mallett was released amidst controversy regarding his benching in favor of Brian Hoyer during a loss against the Indianapolis Colts.[35] After a poor start, the Texans finished with a 9–7 record and won their third AFC South title.[36] However, they were shut out by the Kansas City Chiefs in the Wild Card round 30–0, ending their championship hopes for the year.[37] On March 9, 2016, the Texans signed former Denver Broncos quarterback Brock Osweiler to a 4-year, $72 million deal.[38] Despite Osweiler's lucrative deal, he struggled significantly during the 2016 season. After throwing two interceptions in Week 15 against the Jaguars, coach Bill O'Brien benched the offseason acquisition in favor of backup quarterback Tom Savage. Savage led a comeback effort against the Jaguars, and was named the starter for the remainder of the season. The Texans clinched their fourth AFC South division title in six years in Savage's first career start against the Bengals in Week 16. They defeated the wildcard Oakland Raiders 27–14 in the opening round of the playoffs with Osweiler as the starting quarterback due to Savage being out with a concussion.[39] Osweiler started in the Divisional Playoffs game against the New England Patriots, throwing three interceptions in the second half. The Texans lost 34–16.[40] In the 2017 NFL draft, the Texans traded up to the 12th overall selection to select Clemson star quarterback Deshaun Watson.[41] Watson started six games his rookie year, going 3–3 and having arguably the greatest and most decorated rookie season by a quarterback in NFL history, eventually rising up to become the Texans' franchise quarterback. However, his success would come up very short, following a Week 8 41–38 loss to the Seattle Seahawks, Watson tore his ACL in practice and was ruled out the remainder of the season, which caused the Texans to have one of their worst seasons.[42] Plagued by a series of unexpected injuries (including a second consecutive season-ending injury to J. J. Watt) and controversy involving the team's suspected violation of the league's concussion protocol, after backup quarterback Tom Savage suffered a seizure following a Week 14 game against the San Francisco 49ers, the Texans went 1–9 the rest of the season and eventually finish 4–12 and last in the AFC South in 2017, missing the playoffs for the first time since 2014 and giving Bill O'Brien his first losing season as Texans head coach.[43] In 2018, the Texans started the season 0–3, losing by a combined 15 points to the New England Patriots, Tennessee Titans, and New York Giants, before winning a 37–34 overtime shootout on the road in Indianapolis. This win sparked a nine-game winning streak for the Texans, their first since starting 5–0 in 2012, which included a Week 8 win against the Miami Dolphins that included five touchdown passes from Deshaun Watson.[44] This streak was the longest ever for a team that started the season 0–3; the previous record was a seven-game win-streak set by the New York Giants in 1918 after starting out 0–3.[45] On November 23, 2018, the owner of the Houston Texans, Bob McNair, died from skin cancer.[46] On November 26, 2018, McNair's wife, Janice McNair, became the principal owner and Senior Chair of the Houston Texans, while their son, D. Cal McNair, became the chairman and Chief Operating Officer.[47] The Texans finished the season 11–5, and won another AFC South division championship under Bill O'Brien.[48] They lost 21–7 in the first round of the playoffs to their AFC South division rival Indianapolis Colts.[49] In 2019, the Texans won the AFC South division championship and qualified for the NFL playoffs on the back of a 10–6 record.[50] They went on to defeat the Buffalo Bills by a score of 22–19 in overtime in the AFC wild-card round.[51] However, the Texans' 2019 season came to an end the following week, as they lost to the eventual Super Bowl champion Kansas City Chiefs by a score of 51–31 in the AFC divisional round.[52] The Texans had a 24–0 lead in the game before the Chiefs came back.[53] On March 22, 2020, the Texans traded away all-pro wide receiver DeAndre Hopkins and a fourth-round pick in the 2020 NFL draft to the Arizona Cardinals. In return, Houston received running back David Johnson, a 2020 second-round pick, and a 2021 fourth-round pick.[54] The move was confusing and controversial among fans and sportswriters alike, as many claimed that the Texans should have received more valuable assets for Hopkins, who was among the best receivers in the NFL.[55] The Texans began the 2020 NFL season with a record of 0–4, and Bill O'Brien was consequentially fired following a disappointing loss to the Minnesota Vikings in Week 4. Romeo Crennel, who was the head coach of the Cleveland Browns from 2005 to 2008 and of the Kansas City Chiefs in 2011–12,[56] was named the interim head coach for the remainder of the season.[57] Crennel managed to win more than half of his first 7 games as Houston's head coach, giving Houston a record of 4–7. However, the Texans ended the season on a five-game losing streak.[58] With a final record of 4–12, the Texans were unable to make the playoffs.[59] On January 27, 2021, the Texans hired David Culley as the team's head coach.[60] Culley most recently worked as the Baltimore Ravens assistant head coach, wide receivers coach and passing game coordinator. On February 12, 2021, the Texans released all-pro defensive end J.J. Watt. It was confirmed that Watt personally requested owner Cal McNair for his release.[61] On January 13, 2022, the Texans fired David Culley after posting a 4–13 record[62] as the team's head coach and promoted defensive coordinator Lovie Smith as the team's fifth head coach on February 7, 2022.[63] The team traded away their starting quarterback Deshaun Watson to the Cleveland Browns and a 2024 fifth round pick for three 1st round picks, a 3rd round pick and a 4th round pick on March 20, 2022, due to sexual misconduct lawsuits toward Watson.[64] The Texans opened their 2022 season in a tie game against the Indianapolis Colts, the franchise's first tie in their 20-year existence.[65][66] On January 9, 2023, the Texans announced that they were going in a different direction by firing Lovie Smith after a 3–13–1 season.[67] On January 31, 2023, the Texans hired former player and 49ers defensive coordinator DeMeco Ryans as their new head coach, making him the sixth head coach in franchise history.[68] In the 2023 NFL draft the Texans selected Ohio State quarterback C. J. Stroud and traded up to the third pick to select Defensive End Will Anderson Jr..[69] Under Ryans and Stroud, the team saw improved fortunes as they made the playoffs while winning the AFC South for the first time since the 2019 season with a 10–7 record, becoming the first NFL team to win their division under a rookie head coach and quarterback.[70] The team defeated the Cleveland Browns 45–14 in the Wild Card Round.[71] The Texans saw their season end in the Divisional Round with a 34–10 loss to the Baltimore Ravens.[72] Stroud would later be named NFL offensive Rookie of the Year, and Anderson Jr. would be named NFL defensive Rookie of the Year Award.[73][74] Ryans also finished in a tie in total votes for NFL Coach of the Year with Browns head coach Kevin Stefanski though he lost the award to in a tiebreaker due to having one less first place vote.[75] The Texans are the youngest expansion team in the NFL, having only been competing in the NFL for 23 seasons since 2002 and have had limited regular season and postseason success. For that reason, they have not had the history or the reputation on which to build classic rivalries like the ones that often exist between older franchises. Despite this, the team has developed some rivalries. Its natural rivals are its fellow AFC South teams, which are the Tennessee Titans, Jacksonville Jaguars, and Indianapolis Colts.[76][77][78] The Tennessee Titans, who were formerly the Houston Oilers before their relocation in 1996, are viewed by many Houston fans as the Texans' chief rival as members of the AFC South ever since the early 2000s.[79][80] As of the 2023 season, the Titans lead the all-time series 23–21.[81] Ever since the early 2000s, the Texans also have an AFC South Division rivalry with the Indianapolis Colts, whom the Texans had not defeated until the 2006 season.[82] The first time that the Texans would sweep the Colts was in the 2016 NFL season.[83] More recently, Houston has increased bitterness with the Indianapolis Colts due to their young Houston-native quarterback Andrew Luck having been drafted by the Colts in 2012 and the franchise's first ever sweep of the Colts against Luck in 2016. In 2018 the two teams met in the AFC Wild Card Playoffs, with the Colts winning 21–7.[84][85][86][87] Having begun play in 1995 and 2002, respectively, the Jaguars and Texans are among two of the most-recently established franchises in the NFL. The Jaguars relocated from the AFC Central to the newly created AFC South where the Texans were placed into and have competed as division rivals since. The Jaguars are the only division rival the Texans have a winning record against as the Texans lead the series 29–15.[88] The Texans also have an intrastate/interconference rivalry with the Dallas Cowboys, with whom they contest the so-called Governor's Cup every year (a tradition started between the cities prior to the Oilers relocating) either in the preseason or the regular season for bragging rights in the state of Texas. In 2017, the destruction and flooding caused during Hurricane Harvey a few days before their Week 4 pre-season match up time scheduled caused the game to be relocated to AT&T Stadium in Arlington, Texas. However, out of concern for the safety of the fans and the condition of the player's families & communities, the game was canceled.[89] As of the 2024 season, the Cowboys lead the all-time series 4–3.[90] The Texans are the newest team in the league, but they have been embraced by a fair amount of celebrities since joining the NFL in 2002. The team has also adopted a number of former Houston Oilers fans in search of a new home team. Despite the lacking playoff success, there have been a present amount of loyal fans and even various celebrities such as Ryan Trahan, George Foreman, Paul Wall, Rico Rodriguez, and Raini Rodriguez who have been strong supporters of the team.[91][92][93] During the 2010s, the team adopted the moniker \"Bulls on Parade\" in honor of the Rage Against the Machine song, regularly used prior to the team's introduction before entering the field.[94] In the process of naming the new franchise leadership conducted an extensive review and research process; the final list of names was determined after several months of research conducted jointly by Houston NFL 2002 and NFL Properties. This included an online survey asking fans and the community to weigh in which received more than 65,000 responses in one week. On March 2, 2000, it was announced that the team name search had been narrowed down to five choices: Apollos, Bobcats, Stallions, Texans, and Wildcatters.[95] On September 6, 2000, the NFL's 32nd franchise was officially christened the Houston Texans before thousands at a downtown rally in Houston. McNair explained that the name and logo were chosen to \"embody the pride, strength, independence and achievement that make the people of Houston and our area special.\"[96][97] The name \"Texans\" had been used by several now-defunct football teams, including the Canadian Football League franchise in San Antonio; the World Football League franchise in Houston, which moved to Louisiana to become the Shreveport Steamer; the Dallas Texans of the NFL which played in only the 1952 season; and by the precursor of the present-day Kansas City Chiefs, when they were the second incarnation of the Dallas Texans in the American Football League (AFL). Owner Bob McNair received permission from Chiefs' owner Lamar Hunt to use the Texans name for his new team.[22] It is also a subtle homage to the naming style of the NHL team the Montreal Canadiens who also named their team after their respective demonym.[22] Along with the team name, McNair unveiled the team logo, an abstract depiction of a bull's head, split in such a way to resemble the flag of Texas and the state of Texas, including a lone star to stand for the eye, the five points of which representing pride, courage, strength, tradition and independence. McNair described the colors as \"Deep Steel Blue\", \"Battle Red\" and \"Liberty White\".[96] A year later the Texans unveiled their uniforms during another downtown rally.[98] The Texans' helmet is dark blue with the Texans bull logo. The helmet was initially white when the team name and logo were unveiled, but was later changed to dark blue. The uniform design consists of red trim and either dark blue or white jerseys. The team typically wears white pants with its blue jerseys and blue pants with its white jerseys. Starting with the 2006 season, the Texans wore all-white for their home opener, and the team began to wear an all-blue combination for home games vs. the Indianapolis Colts. In 2003, the Texans introduced an alternative red jersey with blue trim; they wear this jersey at one home game each year, usually against a division rival. In 2007, the Texans introduced red pants for the first time, pairing them with the red jerseys for an all-red look. They would wear this look until 2010, but was brought back in 2023. In October 2008 the Texans paired blue socks (instead of the traditional red) with their blue pants and white jerseys, eventually becoming the team's primary road uniform combination. In 2016, the Texans unveiled a new uniform combo against the Jacksonville Jaguars, pairing the red jersey with blue pants and red socks. In 2017, the Texans unveiled a Color Rush uniform, using an all-blue uniform but with minimal white elements. In 2021, the Texans began sporting all-white socks on select home and road games. In 2022, the Texans began using a red alternate helmet with the red uniform. In 2023, the red alternate helmet was worn with the Color Rush uniform in a 21–16 victory against the Arizona Cardinals.[99] In 2002, the team wore a patch commemorating their inaugural season. Also, they celebrated 10 years as a franchise by wearing an anniversary patch throughout 2012. From 2018 to 2019, the Texans wore a memorial patch to honor Bob McNair after his death.[100] In April 2024, the Texans unveiled redesigned uniforms. The primary dark blue helmets remained, but the home blue uniforms were updated to include the Texans primary crest on the sleeve and new collar stripes, while the road white uniform featured blue and red horn stripes on the sleeves, along with blue numbers with red trim. The white uniform's design also served as the basis for the red alternate uniform, which is paired with a red helmet containing the blue horn stripes. A second alternate uniform is a navy blue base with \"H-Town blue\" accents; numbers are red with \"H-Town blue\" trim. This set is paired with a navy blue alternate helmet containing the \"H-Star\" decal in \"H-Town blue\" with red trim. The inclusion of a second alternate helmet is due to the NFL allowing teams with new uniforms to unveil these helmets in advance this season.[101] Running backs (RB) Wide receivers (WR) Tight ends (TE) Defensive linemen (DL) Defensive backs (DB) Special teams Reserve 52 active, 13 reserve, 16 practice squad (+1 exempt) The Texans have had the top-overall pick in the NFL Draft three times.[102] On November 19, 2017, Andre Johnson was the first-ever inductee into the Texans Ring of Honor.[103] On October 6, 2019, Bob McNair was posthumously the second inductee into the Texans Ring of Honor.[104] On October 1, 2023, J. J. Watt was the third inductee into the Texans Ring of Honor.[105] Only two members of the Pro Football Hall of Fame have spent any portion of their career with Texans, due in part to the requirements to be inducted and the Texans only having been established in 2002. In 2024, Andre Johnson became the first player to be inducted into the Hall of Fame primarily for his time with the Texans.[106] → Coaching staff → Front office → More NFL staffs The Texans have had six full-time head coaches in their franchise history. The team has had two interim head coaches.[108] The team's official mascot is Toro, an anthropomorphic blue bull.[111] The team also has a cheerleading squad simply named the Houston Texans Cheerleaders.[112] Community outreach by the Houston Texans is primarily operated by the Houston Texans Foundation, who works with multiple community partners.[113] The Houston Texans organization is also a supporter of the character education program, Heart of a Champion.[114] In 2017, the 15th annual Houston Texans Charity Golf Classic raised more than $380,000 for the Foundation. More than $27.2 million has been raised for the Foundation since its creation in 2002.[115] Former Texans DE J. J. Watt raised $41.6 million in relief funds for Hurricane Harvey after the storm devastated the city in 2017.[116] Watt ended up winning the Walter Payton Man of the Year Award that season.[117] As of 2023[update], the Texans' flagship radio stations were KILT SportsRadio 610AM and KILT 100.3FM.[118] The AM station has an all-sports format, while the FM station plays contemporary country music.

                "content": "Dua Lipa (/ˈduːə ˈliːpə/ ⓘ DOO-ə LEE-pə, Albanian: [ˈdua ˈlipa]; born 22 August 1995) is a British and Albanian singer and songwriter. Her accolades include seven Brit Awards and three Grammy Awards. Time magazine included her in its list of the 100 most influential people in the world in 2024.[1] Lipa worked as a model before venturing into music and signing with Warner Bros. in 2014. She released her eponymous debut album in 2017, which peaked at number three on the UK Albums Chart and spawned the singles \"Be the One\", \"IDGAF\", and the UK number-one single \"New Rules\". She was honoured with the Brit Awards for British Female Solo Artist and British Breakthrough Act in 2018. Her second UK number-one single, \"One Kiss\" with Calvin Harris, was the best-selling song of 2018 in the UK and won the Brit Award for Song of the Year. She later won the Grammy Award for Best New Artist and for Best Dance Recording for \"Electricity\" featuring Silk City in 2019. Lipa's second album, Future Nostalgia (2020), became her first UK number-one album and peaked in the top-three in the US. Its lead single, \"Don't Start Now\", scored the longest top-ten stay for a British female artist on the UK Singles Chart and ranked in the top five on the US Billboard Hot 100 year-end chart of 2020. The album's success continued with the follow-up singles \"Physical\", \"Break My Heart\", and \"Levitating\", with the latter topping the Billboard year-end Hot 100 chart of 2021 and receiving a RIAA diamond certification in the US. Future Nostalgia won the Brit Award for British Album of the Year and the Grammy Award for Best Pop Vocal Album. Lipa subsequently scored her third and fourth UK number-one singles with the 2021 Elton John duet \"Cold Heart (Pnau remix)\" and \"Dance the Night\" from the soundtrack of the film Barbie (2023), wherein she also made her acting debut. Lipa released her third studio album, Radical Optimism (2024), which debuted atop the UK Albums Chart and was preceded by the UK top-ten singles \"Houdini\", \"Training Season\", and \"Illusion\". She also had a supporting role in the spy film Argylle. Dua Lipa was born on 22 August 1995,[2] in London,[3] the eldest child of Kosovo Albanian parents Anesa (née Rexha) and Dukagjin Lipa from Pristina, FR Yugoslavia (present-day Kosovo).[4][5] Her maternal grandmother is of Bosniak descent.[6][7][8] Lipa's ancestry can be traced back to the city of Peja, Kosovo. Both of her grandfathers were historians.[9] She has a sister, Rina, and a brother, Gjin.[10][11][12] Lipa was musically influenced by her father,[13][14][15] who was the lead singer and guitarist of the Kosovan rock band Oda.[16][17][12] Her father continued to play music at home, including his own compositions and songs of artists such as David Bowie, Bob Dylan, Radiohead, Sting, the Police, and Stereophonics.[14][15][18] Dua Lipa began singing at the age of five.[19] Lipa grew up in West Hampstead, London.[17] She attended Fitzjohn's Primary School[20][21] and her music lessons there included the cello.[5] When she auditioned to enter the school choir, the teacher told her that \"she could not sing\".[5][14][22] At the age of nine, she began weekend singing lessons at the Sylvia Young Theatre School.[5][6][23] Lipa moved with her family to Pristina after Kosovo declared independence in 2008.[6][19] There she attended Mileniumi i Tretë School,[24] learned more about the Albanian language, and considered a music career.[25][26] At age 15, Lipa moved back alone to London and shared a flat with a family friend.[27][28][29][30] At Parliament Hill School she passed her A-Levels, then re-entered Sylvia Young Theatre School part-time.[29][31] She uploaded her own songs to SoundCloud and YouTube. She began posting videos of herself covering songs such as \"If I Ain't Got You\" (2004) by Alicia Keys and \"Beautiful\" (2002) by Christina Aguilera on YouTube.[19] Lipa modelled with Topshop[28] and signed with a modelling agency, helping her land a role as a singer in an ITV advertisement for The X Factor in 2013, covering Sister Sledge's 1979 song \"Lost in Music\".[32][33] She acquired a producer and a manager.[4][29] In 2013, Lipa signed a contract with Tap Management, directed by Ben Mawson and Ed Millett, while working as a waitress in a cocktail bar. Lipa was introduced to Mawson by her lawyer, who discouraged her from signing another publishing deal that was offered to her. They then offered her a monthly salary to leave her job and focus on recording music.[34] During one of the sessions Lipa co-wrote the song \"Hotter than Hell\",[34] which led to her signing a record deal with Warner Bros. Records in 2014.[35][36] Millett retrospectively elaborated: \"Dua was really smart–she signed to Warner Bros. partly because they didn't have a big female pop artist and they needed one. They really wanted her, so she had the focus of the team from day one.\"[34] In August 2015, Lipa released her first single, \"New Love\",[37] produced by Emile Haynie and Andrew Wyatt.[38] Her second single, \"Be the One\", was issued to European success in October 2015,[39][40] reaching number one in Belgium,[41] Poland and Slovakia, as well as charting in the top ten in over eleven European territories. In Australia and New Zealand, the song became an airplay success, reaching numbers 6 and 20 respectively.[42] In November 2015, she was revealed as one of the acts to appear on the BBC Sound of... 2016 long list.[43] We've seen artists who might get half a good song out of 10 writing sessions; with Dua, one in five or one in four is a banger. She gets results out of other people as well, because her personality is so engaging and she is so charismatic. She definitely has that special something. Her first tour in the UK and Europe began in January 2016,[14] and concluded in early December 2016.[44] On 18 February 2016, Lipa released her third single, \"Last Dance\", followed by \"Hotter than Hell\" on 6 May. The latter was successful particularly in the UK, where it peaked at number 15.[45] On 26 August, her fifth overall single, \"Blow Your Mind (Mwah)\", was released, peaking at number 30 in the UK.[45] It became the singer's first entry on the US Billboard Hot 100, debuting at number 72.[46] The song also topped the Billboard Dance Club Songs chart[47] and reached number 23 on the Billboard Mainstream Top 40 chart.[48] Lipa was featured on Sean Paul's single \"No Lie\", released in November 2016,[49] which reached number ten in the UK.[50] The song became a top-ten hit in ten countries six years after its release, and it became Sean Paul's most-streamed song as of December 2022. The music video (directed by Tim Nackashi) surpassed 1 billion views on YouTube in April 2022.[51] The following month, a documentary about Lipa named See in Blue was commissioned by The Fader.[52] In January 2017, Lipa won the EBBA Public Choice Award,[53] and released the single \"Scared to Be Lonely\", a collaboration with Martin Garrix, reaching number 14 in the UK.[54] In May 2017, she performed at the anniversary of Indonesian television channel SCTV and won the award for Young and Promising International Artist at the SCTV Music Awards.[55][56] Lipa's first album Dua Lipa was released on 2 June 2017.[57] Its sixth single, \"New Rules\", released in the following month, became Lipa's first number one in the UK,[45] and the first by a female solo artist to reach the top in the UK since Adele's \"Hello\" in 2015.[58] Her best-selling single to date, the song also charted in the top ten of other countries, including number two in Australia, number six in the US, and number seven in Canada. As of 2024[update], the music video has streamed over three billion views on YouTube.[59][60] Lipa performed at the Glastonbury Festival in June.[61] In July, Lipa performed at the We The Fest, an Indonesian music festival in Jakarta.[62] She performed on the BBC's Later... with Jools Holland in October.[63] In December, Lipa was named the most streamed woman of 2017 in the UK by Spotify.[64] She had four singles reach the UK top 10 in 2017, with \"Be the One\", \"New Rules\", \"No Lie\", and \"Bridge over Troubled Water\", a charity single for the families of the victims of the Grenfell Tower fire in London.[65] In January 2018, Lipa received nominations in five categories at the Brit Awards, more nominations than any other artist that year. She was nominated for MasterCard British Album of the Year for Dua Lipa, British Single of the Year and British Video of the Year for \"New Rules\", British Female Solo Artist, and British Breakthrough Act winning the latter two.[66] This was the first time that a female artist had received five nominations.[67][68] Lipa performed at the awards ceremony held on 21 February at the O2 Arena in London.[66] The singer collaborated with American DJ Whethan on the song \"High\" for the Fifty Shades Freed soundtrack, released in February 2018.[69] She started working on new material for her second album in January 2018.[70] On 6 April, Lipa and Calvin Harris released the single \"One Kiss\",[71] which topped the UK Singles Chart on 20 April, making it Lipa's second number one in the chart;[72] Lipa provided the vocals and is also credited as a writer. The single went on to become the biggest selling song in the UK of 2018 and topped the chart for eight consecutive weeks. She performed in the opening ceremony of the 2018 UEFA Champions League Final in Kyiv on 26 May.[73] It was reported that Lipa would be releasing collaborations with other artists coming out later in 2018, such as one with Mark Ronson and Diplo's newly formed superduo Silk City.[74] Ronson later confirmed the song's title would be \"Electricity\".[75] The song was released on 9 September. Lipa was also featured in \"If Only\", a song from Italian singer Andrea Bocelli's sixteenth studio album Sì.[76] Lipa performed at the F1 Singapore Grand Prix in September.[77] In the same month, Lipa endorsed British car brand Jaguar's new electric car, I-PACE. The brand created a remix of Lipa's song \"Want To\" and launched a service where fans could create their own version of Dua Lipa x Jaguar's song on the Join the Pace website, based on their own driving behaviour or the music they listen to, and share it on social media. According to Lipa's team, Jaguar and Lipa set the world record for the \"most remixed song ever\".[78] In October, the singer released Dua Lipa: The Complete Edition, an expanded version of her debut album that includes three new songs, including the aforementioned \"Want To\", and her previous collaborations with other artists.[79] This included a collaboration with South Korean girl group Blackpink called \"Kiss and Make Up\".[80] In January 2019, Lipa released the single \"Swan Song\" as part of the soundtrack to the 2019 film Alita: Battle Angel.[81][82] That same month, Lipa stated that she spent the preceding year in the writing process for her second studio album.[83] Lipa commented that the album's sound would be a \"nostalgic\" pop record that \"feels like a dancercise class\".[84] In August 2019, Lipa partnered with brand Yves Saint Laurent to endorse their fragrance Libre.[85] Following the release of its lead single \"Don't Start Now\", Lipa's second album, Future Nostalgia, and its accompanying tour were announced in December 2019.[86][87][88] \"Don't Start Now\" peaked at number two on both the UK Singles Chart and the US Billboard Hot 100.[89][46] On the former, it earned the longest top 10 stay for a British female artist and the longest top 10 stay without reaching the summit in that chart's history.[90] The song also peaked at number one on the UK Big Top 40 and the US Billboard Mainstream Top 40 chart.[91][92] Lipa's second single leading up to the release of the album was \"Physical\".[93] It was released on 30 January 2020 and the song's music video was released a day later.[93] \"Physical\" debuted at number 60 on the US Billboard Hot 100.[94] Future Nostalgia was released on 27 March to widespread critical acclaim,[95] following the release of the record's third single \"Break My Heart\" on 25 March.[96] The album debuted at number two on the Official UK Albums Chart, 5550 copies behind 5 Seconds of Summer's Calm.[97] Future Nostalgia peaked at number one on the Official UK Albums Chart the following week in April 2020, while four of the album's singles entered the top ten of the Official Singles Chart.[98] The album holds the record for having the lowest one-week sales while at the top of the chart in the 21st century; when it was number one—the week beginning 15 May 2020—the album had only 7,317 sales.[99] At the time of the album's release, Lipa became the first British female artist since Vera Lynn to have three top-ten singles in a single calendar year, with Lynn having three in 1952.[100] Lipa eventually overrode this record with the single \"Levitating\", which also peaked within the top ten on the Billboard Hot 100 chart, becoming her third top-ten in the US overall. Lipa's music video for \"Physical\" was nominated for Best Art Director at the Berlin Music Video Awards in 2020.

I am very proud to be Albanian.\"[328] The kindergarten was completed in October 2021, and was named \"Sunny Hill Kindergarten\".[329] Lipa has also continuously raised awareness to the detrimental consequences of the Taliban takeover of 2021 in Afghanistan through her social media and her lifestyle newsletter Service95.[330] In August 2022, Lipa was named an Honorary Ambassador of Kosovo by the President of Kosovo Vjosa Osmani. In response, Lipa wrote that it was an \"honor and a privilege to be able to represent my country all over the world\" and that she supports the right of Kosovans \"to visa liberalization, freedom to travel and to dream big.\"[331] On 13 November 2022, Lipa dismissed reports that she was to perform at the opening ceremony of that year's FIFA World Cup, and denied ever being involved in any negotiation to perform, calling out the tournament's host country of Qatar for human rights violations.[332] In October 2023, Lipa signed an open letter for the \"Artists4Ceasefire\" campaign alongside 185 other artists, urging President Biden to push for a ceasefire and an end to the killing of civilians amid the 2023 Israeli invasion of the Gaza Strip, and for a corridor into Gaza to be established for humanitarian aid.[333] In November 2023, Israeli music duo Ness & Stilla released the single \"Harbu Darbu\",[334] which called for Lipa's death.[335] She and her father, Dukagjin, co-created the Sunny Hill Foundation in 2016 to raise funds to help people in Kosovo experiencing financial difficulties.

All of the proceeds went to families and victims affected by the seismic event.[349][350] On 15 March 2020, she asked her fans to make donations to the UNHCR agency to deal with COVID-19 pandemic because refugees are \"the most vulnerable on this planet\" and they \"often live in crowded places\" with \"limited health services\".[351][352] In the same month, she was part of a television special called \"Home Fest\" on The Late Late Show with James Corden From His Garage with the goal of raising money for CDC and Feed the Children where she performed her song, \"Don't Start Now\" (2019), from an apartment in London.[353] On 16 May 2020, she did a live performance of her song \"Break My Heart\" (2020) on the television special Graduate Together: America Honors the High School Class of 2020 aimed at the high school students whose graduation ceremonies and proms were cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic.[354] At the end of May 2020, she participated in a digital event called \"Dream with Us\" with the aim of raising funds,[355] whose event consisted of a streaming concert at which a portion of proceeds would go to organisations which help fight COVID-19.[356] She took part in a charitable project operated by BBC Radio 1 for a cover version of \"Times Like These\" released on 23 April 2020 for the Live Lounge segment.[357] She was part of the charity supergroup Live Lounge Allstars in which each member recorded and filmed their contribution to the song from their respective households to encourage social distancing in which profits from the single would primarily go to Children in Need and Comic Relief, as well as COVID-19 Solidarity Response Fund.[358] She used social media to encourage Lebanese citizens to donate blood to victims affected by the 2020 Beirut explosion.[359] She donated 5,000 euros to the Theatre of Dodona so that the venue could have its own ticket system and website.[360] She was part of an initiative organised by Belgian singer Angèle and KickCancer Foundation to fund research against childhood cancer, and it was about a charity raffle in which Lipa offered a manuscript of her song \"Don't Start Now\" (2019) as a prize.[361][362] She performed at 2021 Elton John AIDS Foundation Academy Award Party virtually to benefit the AIDS Foundation to combat HIV disease, whose event raised US$3 million.[363] Lipa's first name \"Dua\" was her grandmother's suggestion and means \"love\" in Albanian.[8] She is occasionally referred to affectionately by fans as \"Dula Peep\", which originated as a mispronunciation by American talk show host Wendy Williams in 2018.[364] Since then, she has positively embraced the nickname.[365] Lipa's native language is Albanian.[6] She was born and grew up mostly in London, and has a London accent when speaking English.[366] Despite this, she can speak her native language fluently and described her \"dual identity\" as her \"strength\".[367] Lipa has described herself as an \"honorary Liverpool supporter\", after her song \"One Kiss\" was adopted by the football club's fans in the wake of her performance at the 2018 UEFA Champions League final, since becoming a Reds anthem after significant Liverpool victories.[368][369][370] On 27 November 2022, Lipa was granted Albanian citizenship by president Bajram Begaj, one day before the country's 110th independence celebrations.[371][372] From June 2019 to December 2021, Lipa was in a relationship with American model Anwar Hadid.[373] Since January 2024, Lipa has been dating British actor Callum Turner.[374] Lipa was included in the Sunday Times Rich List for 2024 with an estimated net worth of £90 million.[375] Headlining Promotional Opening act",

Josko Gvardiol’s first-half header looked to have settled a clash that was low on quality, until Diallo punished a weak backpass from Matheus Nunes to win Ruben Amorim’s side a late penalty. Bruno Fernandes stepped up to equalise as the clock ticked over to 90 minutes - before Diallo struck again to reach a through pass, flick the ball over Ederson, and squeeze a finish in to spark wild scenes in the away end. The result means City have now lost eight of their last 11 games, while Amorim enjoyed his best moment yet in charge of United after starting the day by dropping both Marcus Rashford and Alejandro Garnacho. But up stepped Diallo, who inspired an unthinkable comeback. Follow all of the latest from the Manchester derby in our live blog below: FULL TIME!

City lost for the eighth time in 11 matches despite taking the lead into the 88th minute of their home Manchester derby at the Etihad, as Amad Diallo inspired a dramatic comeback for the visitors. Diallo first punished a back-pass from Matheus Nunes to win a penalty for Bruno Fernandes, before the winger latched onto a long ball to round Ederson and squeeze a finish into the net. It continued City’s miserable run under Pep Guardiola, who said after the champion’s latest defeat that he was “not good enough”, and Bernardo said the team “deserve to lose” based on their performance. Bernardo Silva rips into Man City for ‘playing like under-15s’ in collapse to Man Utd 21:25 , Jamie Braidwood L 1-2 vs Tottenham (A) - Carabao Cup L 1-2 vs Bournemouth (A) - Premier League L 1-4 vs Sporting (A) - Champions League L 1-2 vs Brighton (A) - Premier League L 0-4 vs Tottenham (H) - Premier League D 3-3 vs Feyenoord (H) - Champions League L 0-2 vs Liverpool (A) - Premier League W 3-0 vs Nottingham Forest (H) - Premier League D 2-2 vs Crystal Palace (A) - Premier League L 0-2 vs Juventus (A) - Champions League L 1-2 vs Manchester United (H) - Premier League 21:05 , Jamie Braidwood “I’m the boss, I’m the manager, I have to find solutions but I don’t find solutions,” Pep Guardiola said. “This is a big club and when you lose eight of (11) something is wrong. You can say the schedule is tough or the injuries to players, but no. “I’m the manager and I’m not good enough, simple as that. I have to find a way to talk to them, to train them in the way we need to play, to press the way we need to press. I’m not good enough. I’m not doing well. That is the truth.” 20:45 , Jamie Braidwood Pep Guardiola said he was “not good enough” to find a solution to Manchester City’s woes after they conceded two late goals to slump to a 2-1 home derby defeat to rivals Manchester United. City had led through Josko Gvardiol’s 36th-minute header but rarely looked comfortable in the game and it all unravelled in stunning fashion at the death. Matheus Nunes, asked to fill in at left-back, was guilty of a poor back-pass and then fouled Amad Diallo trying to make amends to concede a penalty which Bruno Fernandes converted in the 88th minute, and two minutes later Diallo found space to latch on to a long ball and score the winner. Pep Guardiola admits ‘I’m not good enough’ as Man City lose again 20:24 , Pete Hall It was bold. It was brave. And for 88 minutes it looked very foolish indeed. But this is why Ruben Amorim has been tasked with being Manchester United’s saviour. From the minute he walked in the door, he promised short-term pain for long-term game. It seemed, however, he had taken things a step too far. Whatever Marcus Rashford and Alejandro Garnacho had done to be omitted from the squad for a crucial Manchester derby, it should not have come at the cost of his team getting a result at the Etihad. Amad Diallo, in winning an 88th minute penalty and firing a sensational winner, instead gave Amorim the ultimate justification for making the big calls, even for the biggest games. Many will say such courage has long been conspicuous by its absence around Old Trafford. Amad is already Amorim’s posterboy for this high intensity, high press game he wants to instil at United. Rashford and Garnacho, already, are anything but. Ruben Amorim’s first major Man Utd call pays off to send message to dropped duo 19:52 , Jamie Braidwood Manchester United striker Rasmus Hojlund joked that Kyle Walker should win an Oscar after Roy Keane criticised the Manchester City’s defender play-acting in the derby. Hojlund and Walker were involved in a heated confrontation during the first half at the Etihad but it was the United striker who had the last laugh as Amad Diallo inspired a dramatic comeback. Walker was involved in an argument with Hojlund after clipping the United striker, but then fell to the ground as the pair went head-to-head. Along with a picture of himself and Walker butting heads, Hojlund wrote: “Manchester is red; Violets are blue; What a brilliant performance; But the Oscar goes to…” Hojlund produces brilliant comeback after Walker clash: ‘And the Oscar goes to...’ 19:29 , Jamie Braidwood Pep Guardiola has admitted that he is not finding the solutions to Manchester City’s problems after their latest defeat. He told Sky Sports that Man City’s form is “getting worse and worse”. “This year it happens many times unfortunately. We gave away many things. We are not nice in the way we played. Before it’s so fluid, now we’re struggling for different reasons. A lot of defeats. We put everything in and the game was almost closed. They had more possession first half but nothing special. We give away two goals, very difficult. “It is what it is. What can I say? We can not blame this player or that one, it’s not that. It’s the season, a tough season. We didn’t play our best. We are not our best and we struggle a bit. “Previously we didn’t lose that many in two seasons. Now we’ve done it in eight games. You have to defend. We have lost a lot of games. It’s difficult. We have to move on and try to find the solution and try to win games. “I think in nine years it wasn’t the toughest defeat. Champions League defeats harder. But at the moment, we need results to lift our mood. It’s getting worse and worse. I have to find the solution. So far I didn’t find it and this is the truth.” 19:21 , Jamie Braidwood Ruben Amorim makes sure to say Manchester United need to “improve their standards” after beating Manchester City. He adds that Marcus Rashford and Alejandro Garnacho will be given a “new week, new life” on Monday and can return to the team if they impress in training. Full quotes to come... 19:13 , Jamie Braidwood Some very strong words from Bernardo Silva when speaking to Sky Sports, who says Manchester City “deserved what happened” in the final five minutes because of “stupid decisions”. He adds that the champions “played like under-15s” when 1-0 up. “We totally deserved what happened,” Silva tells Sky Sports. “At this level, if it’s a game or two, you can say that they are being lucky. If it’s 10 games, it’s not about that. “If in the 87th minute of a derby, you are winning 1-0 with a corner for your team and the ball ends up with your ‘keeper and a penalty for them, my friend… “If you make these kinds of stupid decisions with three or four minutes to go, you deserve to pay for that. “If you look at the game, there was only one team that could win. But at the end, we lost, and it’s not one gamee, it’s a lot of games lately. “We have to look at ourselves. It’s not about luck. It’s the decisions you make. Today, in the last minutes we played like under-15s and we paid the price.” 19:10 , Richard Jolly For City, it was another capitulation, another collapse. After Feyenoord’s three goals in 15 minutes at the Etihad Stadium came United’s two in three. A team who lost a lead to Amorim’s Sporting last month repeated the feat against his Manchester United: but at home, but later, but when their plight is greater. It was an eighth defeat in 11 games for a manager who has been a byword for winning. Guardiola finished with the now familiar chorus of “sacked in the morning” ringing in his ears. His melodramatic reaction when Matheus Nunes conceded the spot kick that Bruno Fernandes was to convert showed his fears about the fragility of this side. They duly lost. Again. A shadow of themselves, Man City have reached an unthinkable position 19:01 , Jamie Braidwood Manchester City lost a home game after leading at half time for the first time since 8th May 2021, which came against Chelsea. Since then, City went 44 games without defeat in the Premier League after leading at half-time. 18:49 , Jamie Braidwood Plenty of talk about Manchester Citys horror run. But there should be just as much said about how Amad Diallo lit the derby. Here he is, speaking to Sky Sports: “We wanted to win, we pressed good. It’s a derby, you have to win. We showed today we could do it. “I want to thank God for this. Let’s enjoy this and then look to the next game.” Bruno Fernandes adds: “He’s a man of few words in English! He’s doing great things. There is more to come, too. I want him to keep going. He is always alive. When he’s like this he is unstoppable. He can do this week after week.” 18:45 , Jamie Braidwood City’s next game? They’re off in midweek and then go to Aston Villa on Saturday night. City are fifth, two points above sixth-placed Villa, and they lost there last season. Pep Guardiola’s side are still nine points behind leaders Liverpool, who have a game in hand. Until the 88th minute, they are about to go level on points with Arsenal. 18:40 , Jamie Braidwood Pep Guaridola will be “scratching his head, again”, says Gary Neville on Sky Sports. “This just does not happen to Manchester City, it does not happen to Pep Guardiola. These fans have not seen the like for many many years. These players, serial winners and serial campions.” “Shell-shocked” and “gob-smacked”, add Roy Keane and Micah Richards. All the reaction to come. 18:39 , Jamie Braidwood There were boos at full-time at the Etihad. Manchester City fans are not used to this under Pep Guardiola. An unthinkable late collapse continues a miserable run. Amad Diallo was United’s only spark and turned the derby. 18:38 , Chris Wilson It was a poor game in many respects in Manchester, with both sides lacking real quality in parts. City were probably the better of the two sides for the most part, but a draw would have been a fair result overall. In the end, United pounced at the right time to take advantage of some poor decision-making by City, and they come away with (a perhaps undeserved) three points. 18:35 , Chris Wilson 18:32 , Chris Wilson FULL-TIME! The referee brings the game to an end and somehow United escape with three points! A poor game gets a finish worthy of a classic, and City’s players look shellshocked. 18:31 , Chris Wilson 96 mins City launch it forward but United win it back, and Zirkzee is isolated as he launches his own attack, carrying it forward. There’s not much time left... 18:29 , Chris Wilson 95 mins Grealish’s cross is put behind by Lindelof, so City win a corner. Grealish knocks it in, but Martinez clears, before Yoro clears the second ball in. 18:28 , Chris Wilson 94 mins United knock it clear but it’s straight back to a City shirt every time. The hosts are applying all the pressure now. 18:27 , Chris Wilson 93 mins Plenty of nerves around the Etihad, from both sets of fans. It’s City with all the possession. 18:26 , Chris Wilson 91 mins There’ll be five minutes of added time here. Amad has been replaced by Victor Lindelof. 18:25 , Chris Wilson 90 mins GOAL! And United have turned it around! Martinez finds himself in space on the left and he looks up and picks out Amad, who has made the run in-between the centre-backs. His first touch knocks it over Ederson, and he then cushions in a finish at an angle! 18:23 , Chris Wilson 89 mins City have brought on Savinho for Gundogan as we approach 90 minutes. 18:22 , Chris Wilson 88 mins Fernandes steps up to take the penalty after a little delay. He takes a slow run-up and fires a low effort into the right-hand corner, sending Ederson the wrong way. 18:20 , Chris Wilson 86 mins Penalty! They had it under control but Nunes sells Ederson short with the pass and Amad latches onto it. He’s in the box but rather than shoot, he waits and falls under the challenge from Nunes for a penalty. 18:19 , Chris Wilson 84 mins City win a cheap corner but United manage to get it away. The home side are in control as it stands. 18:18 , Chris Wilson 82 mins Martinez tries to play in an early cross and Mainoo reaches it, but he can only direct a header well over. City are happy to let United have the ball in those areas. 18:15 , Chris Wilson 80 mins More good work from Amad to skip past Nunes in the box, but Fernandes can’t get the ball under control and it goes out for a goal kick. 18:12 , Chris Wilson 78 mins Subs from United this time as Hojlund, Mazraoui and de Ligt come off for Joshua Zirkzee, Antony and Leny Yoro. Questionable changes, I’d say. 18:11 , Chris Wilson 77 mins Gundogan swings in the corner and Maguire’s clearing header falls to Foden, who volleys over the bar. 18:11 , Chris Wilson 76 mins A comedy moment as Mazraoui slips and Doku slips in a pass to Hojlund. The cross bounces over to Haaland, whose effort is deflected for a corner. City bring off Doku for Jack Grealish. 18:09 , Chris Wilson 74 mins CLOSE! United’s first good attack of the game as Mazraoui does brilliantly to take it off Doku and escape a couple of challenges. He plays it to Hojlund, who threads a perfect through ball to Fernandes. The Portuguese clips his effort over the onrushing Ederson, but it rolls wide of the far post! 18:06 , Chris Wilson 72 mins A lull in activity here, with City still controlling the game as Hojlund is flagged offside from Mainoo’s ball over the top. 18:03 , Chris Wilson 69 mins Diallo gets past Nunes well on the touchline and plays a great pass to Dalot across the box, but the Portuguese can’t make anything of it. 18:02 , Chris Wilson 67 mins City have half a chance as the ball falls to Gundogan on the edge of the box, but he fires well over. 17:58 , Chris Wilson 64 mins United fans want a penalty as there’s a coming together in the box between Dias and Hojlund. It looks like the Portuguese’s leg has taken him down, but the referee isn’t interested. 17:57 , Chris Wilson 63 mins SAVE! Ederson’s first real save of the game as Dalot cuts back to Fernandes, who clips a diagonal cross into the box. Amad glances a header goalwards, forcing Ederson to get across and parry out for a corner. 17:56 , Jamie Braidwood Rather pedestrian fare from two uninspired teams in an error-riddled game. City at least have a lot of people in midfield, which Guardiola prefers. United were arguably the better side for the period around the goal, but still find themselves one down and, some Amad runs aside, not looking likely to equalise in a side that now seems overloaded with defenders. The attackers on the bench are, er, Zirkzee and Antony. 17:54 , Chris Wilson 61 mins Finally some innovation from United as Diallo runs at the City defence, but his promising run is ended as he gets into the box. Once again, the hosts are happy to sit back when United do have the ball. 17:53 , Chris Wilson 59 mins City, and in particular Foden, are finding more space between the lines at the moment, with the England man going close to slipping a through ball to Haaland a couple of minutes ago. Moments later, Nunes’ clipped ball over the top just outruns the Norwegian. 17:51 , Chris Wilson 57 mins United are enjoying a bit of possession but City look happy to let them have it. It ends with Fernandes playing another poor pass that’s intercepted near halfway. 17:49 , Chris Wilson 55 mins Another poor United attack comes to nothing as there’s no space for Mazraoui and Amad, before Fernandes fires a speculative cross straight out of play. So poor from the visitors. 17:47 , Chris Wilson 52 mins The corner goes short but De Bruyne’s cross is easily cleared. Perhaps strange that City aren’t just firing it into the box considering United’s recent corner woes. 17:47 , Chris Wilson 51 mins A real lack of quality on show in the last few minutes, with two United attacks breaking down after a poor pass from Doku, before Fernandes fires a free-kick straight to a City man and Doku wins a corner. 17:45 , Chris Wilson 50 mins The cameras show Amorim on the touchline with his head in his hands, almost bemused. It looks like reality is setting in for the Portuguese, if it hadn’t last week (or in the weeks before). 17:44 , Chris Wilson 48 mins Mazraoui gets into space and has the right idea in threading a through ball in for Hojlund, but City deal with it well. 17:41 , Chris Wilson 46 mins United’s first foray forwards ends with Mazraoui being flagged for offside despite some nice work from Mainoo in the box. 17:39 , Chris Wilson United get the second half started at the Etihad. 17:37 , Chris Wilson Both sides are emerging from the tunnel again, so we’ll be back underway soon. 17:33 , Chris Wilson A curious half in Manchester, with both sides looking nervous and some very disjointed play in attack. Even City’s goal prompted an irritate reaction from Guardiola, who was maybe annoyed at the short corner routine. The goal was fortuitous, but they’ve been the better of the two sides and will be fully aware of the lack of United threat if they can keep the game like this in the second half. For United, it’s a remarkably similar situation – they’ve played okay at times but have lacked anything in attack. 42 per cent of their conceded goals this season have come from corners, apparently. 17:27 , Chris Wilson 17:22 , Chris Wilson 50 mins HALF-TIME! De Bruyne could arguably shoot from here, but the angle is tight... He opts to clip a cross to Foden, but it runs to Ugarte and the half ends. 17:21 , Chris Wilson 48 mins Another ridiculous moment from Dalot as he fires a diagonal pass right near the United area, and Foden narrowly misses out on taking it under control. City attack again and Foden wriggles in between two challenges before his shot deflects off Maguire and forces Onana into making a save. From the corner, Martinez brings down De Bruyne for a free-kick right on the left-hand edge of the area. 17:19 , Chris Wilson 47 mins De Bruyne wins a cheap free-kick off Ugarte and there’ll be another chance to swing a set-piece into the box. He overhits the cross and it’s straight out of play. 17:17 , Chris Wilson 45 mins There’ll be at least four minutes of added time here. 17:16 , Chris Wilson 44 mins Amad is flagged offside, for what is at least the third time this half. From the attack, Haaland is penalised for a foul on Ugarte near the United box. 17:15 , Chris Wilson 43 mins Half a chance for De Bruyne as Onana’s clearance falls to him on the right-hand touchline, but his shot from distance is straight to the ‘keeper. 17:13 , Chris Wilson 41 mins Fernandes’ free-kick is a decent delivery and it bounces to Haaland, who hits it against Mainoo, and the ball rolls past the near post for a corner, which is cleared by Doku. 17:11 , Chris Wilson 39 mins Straight after the goal, there’s handbags as Hojlund makes contact with Kyle Walker. Walker fouls him, the Danish striker gets up, both move their head towards each other, but there’s just a telling off and a yellow card each from the ref. 17:09 , Chris Wilson 37 mins GOAL! And the home side are ahead! It’s a name that’s become reliable in recent months, as Gvardiol heads in. City work the corner short and De Bruyne’s cross is defected across and into the path of Gvardiol, who simply powers a header in past Onana. 17:07 , Chris Wilson 34 mins Amad has a second chance at a shot after Mainoo’s effort is blocked, but it’s too tame and it’s cleared. City counter, and Fernandes narrowly avoids a booking as he brings down Silva. Doku then wins a corner after his effort is blocked by Mazraoui. 17:06 , Richard Jolly, at the Etihad A quiet first half so far. City's system is something of an oddity, with a lot of midfielders in parts of the middle. There are times when Matheus Nunes is man-marking Amad Diallo, who looks United's main threat. United at least have hints of a counter-attacking threat, but without the decision-making to make the most of breaks. But very few chances and very little of Erling Haaland so far. 17:04 , Chris Wilson 32 mins United win the ball in their own half after a good challenge from Ugarte. Fernandes finds Amad in space down the wing, but the chances goes begging after it’s played back to Ugarte and he fires over from distance. 17:03 , Chris Wilson 30 mins A reminder that if City were to win here, despite all the attention on their results, they’d be only six points behind Liverpool (who would have a game in hand though). You never know what might happen if they dip into the market in January... Not a lot to report from the Etihad at the moment though, with both sides still exchanging possession too easily. 17:01 , Chris Wilson 28 mins Both sides look understandably nervy here. It’s certainly the only time in the last decade or so that they’ve meet in these sort of circumstances, and it’s showing in how the game is being played. No side taking any real risks in attack yet. 16:58 , Chris Wilson 26 mins United work their first good chance of the day, with Ugarte slipping a ball to Amad on the overlap, though the Ivorian hits the post when one-on-one. The flag goes up for offside anyway. 16:56 , Chris Wilson 24 mins The first real bit of quality on show as De Bruyne’s pass is dummied by Foden to Haaland, who then slips a pass into Foden. The England international works some space to shoot, but it’s blocked for a corner. From the set-piece, it’s headed over at the near post. 16:54 , Chris Wilson 23 mins There’s space to attack for both sides when they have the ball, with City’s tending to open up in the areas that Doku and Nunes are filling down the left. The Belgian has looked City’s most threatening player so far, with United sitting deep. 16:53 , Chris Wilson 21 mins The first half-chance of the game comes to City, as Doku’s cross is headed away to the feet of Foden, who drives a volley wide of the near post. 16:51 , Chris Wilson 19 mins City with 58 per cent of the possession, and neither side has had a shot yet. Tells you what you need to know so far. 16:50 , Chris Wilson 17 mins A little bit of frustration from both sides as a couple of promising attacks break down too easily. City do follow it with some well-worked combinations between Foden and De Bruyne, but it’s a little too static at the moment. 16:49 , Richard Jolly, at the Etihad Mason Mount's departure felt sadly predictable but continues his horrible misfortune with injuries. Mount is a player Ruben Amorim really likes and one of the few who suits his 3-4-3 formation. Without Garnacho and Rashford, Amorim had fewer options to replace him and United have a more defensive look now, with Kobbie Mainoo coming on in midfield and Bruno Fernandes moving further forward. 16:48 , Chris Wilson 15 mins A nice spin from Doku ends up winning the first dangerous free-kick of the game for City, not far from the United box. City take it quickly down to Doku on the wing, but his cross is headed away before Gundogan clips a cross out for a goal kick. 16:45 , Chris Wilson 13 mins Mount comes off and he’s replaced by Kobbie Mainoo. Such poor luck for the 25-year-old. 16:44 , Chris Wilson 12 mins United are enjoying a little more success with their possession in the last few minutes, though Amad is now flagged offside. The away side re trying to stifle City at the moment, in a similar way to how they did against Arsenal. Mason Mount is down injured, and he looks like he’ll have to come off. 16:42 , Chris Wilson 10 mins A real lack of quality from Dalot as he cuts back outside to make the space and then clips in a cross to nobody, straight out of play. The Portuguese was notably poor in the loss against Forest, so can he recover to produce better today? 16:41 , Chris Wilson 8 mins Both sides have been guilty of giving up possession far too easily on a couple of occasions, though neither have been in dangerous positions. There’s plenty of nerves at the Etihad. Amad tries to clip in a ball to the overlapping Fernandes, but Walker was covering well. 16:39 , Chris Wilson 6 mins United break quickly, led by Dalot, but his cross is easily collected by Ederson. They come again, enjoying their first bit of sustained possession so far in the match, but it ends up back with Onana. 16:37 , Chris Wilson 4 mins De Bruyne’s cross is aimed towards Haaland at the back post but Martinez does well to head behind for a corner. That battle could be a mismatch if it happens too often, though. 16:35 , Chris Wilson 3 mins Doku thinks he’s beaten Mazraoui down the wing but the ball went out. That battle will be key today, and Dku has had the better of it early on. City with the lion’s share of possession so far. 16:34 , Chris Wilson 1 min It is Nunes starting at left-back for City, with Silva on the right wing. For United, Mazraoui is right wing-back, with Diallo starting in the advanced midfield position alongside Mount. Plenty of high pressing early on for the home side. 16:32 , Chris Wilson The home side get us underway at the Etihad. There’s already been plenty of news to note so far today, and we’re sure to have some more soon. 16:25 , Chris Wilson Both sides are in the tunnel at the Etihad and we’re around five minutes from kick-off. 16:20 , Chris Wilson Manchester United have lost both of their last two Premier League games, last losing three in a row within a single season in December 2015 under Louis van Gaal. New manager Ruben Amorim is yet to lose three on the bounce in his top-flight managerial career, with this his 172nd such match across Portugal’s Primeira Liga and England’s Premier League. 39% of Man Utd’s goals conceded in the Premier League this season have come from corner situations (7/18), the highest share in the division. So far in 2024, they’ve conceded 15 goals from corners, just three fewer than they did in 2021 (8), 2022 (4) and 2023 (6) combined. Ruben Amorim has already beaten Manchester City this season, with his Sporting CP side winning 4-1. Only one manager has beaten the reigning Premier League champions with two different sides in a single campaign, with Alan Pardew beating Man City with both Newcastle United and Crystal Palace in 2014-15. 16:20 , Richard Jolly, at the Etihad Both are at a historic low - City over the last 10 games, United after 15 of a league campaign. Pep Guardiola looks to have gone with wing-backs - potentially Jeremy Doku and Matheus Nunes - because of a lack of defenders. United lack two of their usual forwards with Marcus Rashford and Alejandro Garnacho omitted from the squad. 16:16 , Chris Wilson In his own press conference, Ruben Amorim insisted that the United job “was my only option”, adding that “when Manchester United talked to me, I had no doubts because I had already something in my mind that it could be a possibility”. “We will face a great opponent and I’m more focused on our problems. So we have a lot of issues here, so I’m more focused on what we should do on Sunday to win the game. “I’m really focused on the details. I just want to improve the team so I cannot live it like a normal derby, like it should be – two great teams fighting for the title. And it’s not that in this moment. So it’s just one more game with a very good opponent. “The great teams can respond at any moment - and I think they are in a better place than us in the type of understanding the game, the way they play and the confidence they have. We will have a strategy: try to win the game with the strategy like it should be.” 16:12 , Chris Wilson City have conceded at least twice in seven of their last 11 Premier League games (W4 D3 L4), as many times as they had in their previous 62 in the competition. Erling Haaland has nine goal involvements in just four Premier League appearances against Manchester United (6 goals, 3 assists). It’s already the most goal involvements any Manchester City player has against the Red Devils in the competition. Phil Foden has scored six goals in his last four Premier League appearances against Manchester United. Only Sergio Agüero (8) has scored more Manchester derby goals for the Citizens in the competition than Foden (6, level with Erling Haaland). 16:10 , Chris Wilson In his pre-match press conference, Pep Guardiola said that for his players, “the less emotional you are the better”. “In our jobs we always want to do our best and when that doesn’t happen you are more uncomfortable. That is not just the managers but there is bigger scrutiny for the team. I’m fine. When I have more thoughts, it is about what we can do and what I feel right now is how I felt in he last month. Nothing has changed.” He added that City need “to shoot more and cut out the mistakes”, saying: “What I want is my players back. “I would desperately love to compete with the squad we had at the beginning of the season. My regret is that we don’t we have these, not needing new ones.” He added that despite the club’s positive financial results, it “doesn’t mean we have big, big resources to buy whatever we want, especially with how expensive the transfer market is”. 16:07 , Chris Wilson Explaining his decision to leave out Rashford and Garnacho, Amorim said: “Selection. We try to evaluate everything: training, performance, game performance, engagement with the team-mates, pushing the team-mates up. Everything is on the line when we analyse and try to choose the players, so that is my selection. “I don’t want to send a message. It’s simply an evaluation, and they know it. The players are really, really smart. Everybody understands my decision. I have to choose. “The context is difficult. We have to win games and we have a difficult situation. I pay attention to everything, the way you eat, the way you put on your clothes to go the game. Everything. I make my evaluation and then I have to decide. I have a lot of players to choose.” 16:05 , Chris Wilson Manchester City have won five of their last six Premier League games against Manchester United (L1), more than they had in their previous 13 (W4 D3 L6). United have lost each of their last three Premier League away games against Man City, conceding 13 goals in the process. They last lost four consecutive league visits to the Citizens between 1952 and 1955. The Red Devils have lost 20 Premier League games against Man City – only against Arsenal (21) have they lost more in the competition. 16:00 , Jamie Braidwood Ruben Amorim has explained why Marcus Rashford and Alejandro Garnacho were dropped from his Manchester United squad to face Manchester City in the derby, with the Portuguese manager revealing it was not purely a footballing decision. Rashford and Garnacho were surprise omissions from Amorim’s team to take on Pep Guardiola’s side at the Etihad, with both players having featured in the win at Viktoria Plzen on Thursday. Amorim confirmed that neither player is injured, adding that both Rashford and Garnacho trained at Carrington on Sunday morning while the first-team prepared for the trip to the Etihad. Amorim explains shock decision to drop Rashford and Garnacho from Man Utd squad 15:51 , Chris Wilson Manchester City have sounded out Paul Pogba about a potential move on his return to football in March. The player himself is understood to be reluctant to move back to Manchester, however, due to his experience there with local rivals United. Pogba recently had a four-year ban for increased levels of testosteronereduced to 18 months, meaning he is eligible to play again in March. The situation saw the 31-year-old leave Juventus in November, meaning he is a free agent. City have been assessing options in the midst of the most difficult season of Pep Guardiola‘s time so far, where injury and recruitment issues have left a thin squad exposed. Man City considering move for Paul Pogba but face key stumbling block 15:45 , Chris Wilson These two sides have met a total of 172 times, with the first meeting dating as far back as the 1890s. Overall, United have won 67 City have won 56, and 49 have ended as draws. Last season, City won both meetings in the league (3-0 at Old Trafford and 3-1 at the Etihad), though they lost the FA Cup final to their rivals in the final match of the season. In August, City won the Community Shield on penalties after a 1-1 draw. 15:40 , Chris Wilson Pep Guardiola has a new appreciation for Manchester City’s dominance amid their current struggles and claimed he would walk away if he felt he had lost the team. City host Manchester United in the derby at the Etihad on Sunday in the unfamiliar position of having lost seven of their last 10 games in all competitions. Guardiola ended speculation about his future by signing a new two-year contract three weeks ago but that certainty has so far not helped City arrest their slide. Pep Guardiola has new appreciation for Man City feats after recent poor form 15:31 , Chris Wilson Perhaps the biggest news from the United camp is that neither Marcus Rashford or Alejandro Garnacho are in the matchday squad. Ruben Amorim has made four changes to the side that beat Viktoria Plzen 2-1 in midweek, with Rasmus Hojlund starting up top ahead of Joshua Zirkzee. In midfield, Casemiro has dropped out in favour of summer signing Manuel Ugarte, while at wing-back Tyrell Malacia is benched in favour of Harry Maguire, with Diogo Dalot presumably moving to left wing-back and Amad Diallo on the right. In addition, Mason Mount has replaced Rashford, who is dropped. 15:23 , Chris Wilson Pep Guardiola has made two changes to the side that lost 2-0 to Juventus last time out. Rico Lewis and Jack Grealish drop out, with Matheus Nunes and Phil Foden replacing them. On paper, it seems that maybe Nunes will fill in at left-back if they are in a back four, with Doku and Bernardo on the wings and one of Foden and De Bruyne holding alongside Gundogan, perhaps. 15:18 , Chris Wilson City XI: Ederson, Walker, Dias, Gvardiol, Gundogan, De Bruyne, Bernardo, Nunes, Foden, Doku, Haaland.

While they may not have topped the table before playoffs started, these are two of the most experienced sides in navigating the playoffs with 20 Liga MX titles between them. Club America have a record 15 but in recent years, Monterrey have grown as a force. Now they'll go to battle in the second leg after America won the opening leg 2-1. Here are our storylines, how you can watch the match and more: Monterrey: Earning a seeded place in the playoffs after finishing fifth, Rayados have proceeded to let the goals fly in their matches so far hanging six on Pumas and six more on San Luis en route to making the final. The defense may be a concern allowing six goals but this is one of the most dangerous attacks in Liga MX led by German Berterame but there are contributions through the entire squad. Club America: They've grinded through more matches than Monterrey allowing only three goals in the playoffs so far but all of those goals came at the hands of league leaders Cruz Azul during a wild 4-3 victory that saw two players sent off with red cards deep into stoppage time after Rodrigo Aguirre's 94th minute penalty broke the deadlock in the match. America will enter this match with the advantage after USMNT man Alex Zendejas had an excellent game with a goal and an assist in the first leg. They hold a one-goal lead on aggregate but will need to hold off Monterrey's potent attack away from home. Kevin Alvarez was able to get a goal to keep things manageable but this is in America's control. Monterrey predicted XI: Luis Cardenas, Stefan Medina, Hector Moreno, Gerardo Arteaga, Sergio Canales, Oliver Torres, Jorge Rodriguez, Iker Jareth Fimbres Ochoa, Lucas Ocampos, Roberto de la Rosa, German Berterame Club America predicted XI: Luis Malagon, Cristian Borja, Sebastian Caceres, Ramon Juarez Del Castillo, Israel Reyes, Alvaro Fidalgo, Jonathan dos Santos, Richard Sanchez, Henry Martin, Alex Zendejas With home pitch advantage, Monterrey will overturn the deficit but America will win on penalties.

                "content": "by Dante Gonzalez December 15, 2024 Club America traveled to the BBVA Stadium to face Rayados de Monterrey in the second leg of the Apertura 2024 Liga MX Final. Holding a 2-1 lead on aggregate, America extended their advantage early in the match when midfielder Richard Sanchez delivered a sensational strike in the 24th minute. Despite already leading the tie, America approached the game with an attacking mindset. Moments before Sanchez’s goal, Henry Martin found the back of the net, but the effort was ruled out for offside. The breakthrough came after a brilliant sequence of play. Alvaro Fidalgo launched a perfectly placed long ball to Alejandro Zendejas, who set up Sánchez with a deft header. Sanchez unleashed a stunning shot, giving Las Aguilas a commanding 3-1 lead on aggregate. Monterrey pushed to stage a comeback and found a lifeline in the 85th minute. Spanish midfielder Sergio Canales threaded a precise ball to Johan Rojas, who had replaced Erick Aguirre earlier in the second half. Rojas cut inside the box and delivered a clinical finish to reduce the deficit to 3-2 on aggregate. However, Monterrey’s efforts fell short as the second leg ended in a 1-1 draw. With a 3-2 aggregate victory, Andre Jardine’s side claimed their third consecutive championship. Las Aguilas now boast an unrivaled 16 Liga MX titles, further cementing their dominance. They are followed by Guadalajara with 12, Toluca with 10, Cruz Azul with 9, Leon and Tigres UANL with 8 each, and UNAM and Pachuca with 7 apiece. Both America and Monterrey have left everything on the pitch in their pursuit of the Apertura 2024 title, but the intensity of the series has come at a cost, with injuries affecting key players on both sides. In the first leg, Monterrey suffered a major blow when forward Lucas Ocampos sustained a muscle injury just four minutes into the match, ruling him out for the decisive second leg. America has also faced its share of setbacks, losing striker Henry Martin during the first half of the return leg, followed by midfielder Richard Sanchez—who scored the opening goal—in the 71st minute.

                "content": "National Football League (1970–present) The Cincinnati Bengals are a professional American football team based in Cincinnati. The Bengals compete in the National Football League (NFL) as a member of the American Football Conference (AFC) North division. The team plays its home games at Paycor Stadium in downtown Cincinnati.[7] Former Cleveland Browns head coach Paul Brown began planning for the creation of the Bengals franchise in 1965, and Cincinnati's city council approved the construction of Riverfront Stadium in 1966. Finally, in 1967, the Bengals were founded when a group headed by Brown received franchise approval by the American Football League (AFL) on May 23, 1967, and they began play in the 1968 season.[8] Brown was the Bengals' head coach from their inception to 1975. After being dismissed as the Browns' head coach by Art Modell (who had purchased a majority interest in the team in 1961) in January 1963, Brown had shown interest in establishing another NFL franchise in Ohio and looked at both Cincinnati and Columbus. He ultimately chose the former when a deal between the city, Hamilton County, and Major League Baseball's Cincinnati Reds (who were seeking a replacement for the obsolete Crosley Field) was struck that resulted in an agreement to build a multipurpose stadium which could host both baseball and football games. Due to the impending merger of the AFL and the NFL, which was scheduled to take full effect in the 1970 season, Brown agreed to join the AFL as its 10th and final franchise. The Bengals, like the other former AFL teams, were assigned to the AFC following the merger. Cincinnati was also selected because, like their neighbors the Reds, they could draw from several large neighboring cities (Louisville and Lexington, Kentucky; Columbus, Dayton, and Springfield, Ohio) that are all no more than 110 miles (180 km) away from downtown Cincinnati, along with Indianapolis, until the Baltimore Colts relocated there prior to the 1984 NFL season.[9] After Paul Brown's death in 1991, controlling interest in the team was inherited by his son, Mike Brown. In 2011, Brown purchased shares of the team owned by the estate of co-founder Austin Knowlton and is now the majority owner of the Bengals franchise.[7] The Bengals won the AFC championship in 1981, 1988, and in 2021. After each of the 1981 and 1988 conference championships, they went on to lose to the San Francisco 49ers, in Super Bowls XVI and XXIII. The team struggled greatly in the 1990s and the early 2000s, during which time they were sometimes referred to disparagingly as \"The Bungles,\" a term coined by Steelers broadcaster Myron Cope.[10] [11][12][13][14] Following the 1990 season, the team went 14 years without making the NFL playoffs or posting a winning record. The Bengals went through several head coaches in that period, and many of their top draft picks did not pan out. The team's fortunes improved in the mid-2000s and into the mid-2010s, which saw them become more consistent postseason contenders, but they continued to struggle in the playoffs.[15][16][17][18] The turning point for the Bengals was during the 2021 season, when they won their first playoff game in 31 years and advanced to the first of two consecutive AFC Championship games. In 2021, they defeated the Kansas City Chiefs 27–24 in overtime and advanced to Super Bowl LVI, their first appearance in the Super Bowl in 33 years, where they lost to the Los Angeles Rams 23–20.[19] They advanced to the AFC Championship game again in 2022 but lost to the eventual Super Bowl champions, the Chiefs, by a score of 23-20 (the same exact score as in Super Bowl LVI).[20] The team does not have an official general manager. However, Duke Tobin is often, though incorrectly, referred to as the Bengals' general manager because he handles most personnel decisions.[21] In a 2011 survey, Brown was rated as among the worst team owners in American professional sports.[22] In a Forbes article on the value of NFL teams as of August 2022, the Cincinnati Bengals were ranked last with a value of $3 billion.[23] In 1967, an ownership group led by Paul Brown was granted a franchise in the American Football League. Brown named the team the Bengals in order \"to give it a link with past professional football in Cincinnati\".[24] Another Cincinnati Bengals team had existed in the city and played in three previous American Football Leagues[25] from 1937 to 1942. The city's world-renowned zoo was also home to a rare white Bengal tiger. In a possible insult to Art Modell – or possibly as a homage to the Massillon Tigers – Brown chose the exact shade of orange used by his former team. He added black as the secondary color. Brown chose a very simple logo: the word \"BENGALS\" in black lettering. One of the potential helmet designs Brown rejected was a striped motif that was similar to the helmets adopted by the team in 1981 still in use today; however, that design featured stripes which were more uniform in width.[26] The Bengals began play in the 1968 season. In 1966, the American Football League agreed to a merger with its older and more established rival, the National Football League.[27] Among the terms of the merger was that the AFL was permitted to add one additional franchise; the NFL wanted an even number of clubs in the merged league, so a team needed to be added to bring the number of clubs in the merged league to 26 teams. For the AFL, a key motive behind their agreement to accept a new team was that the guarantee of an eventual place in the NFL meant the league could charge a steep expansion fee of $10 million – 400 times the $25,000 the original eight owners paid when they founded the league in 1960. The cash from the new team provided the American Football League with the funds needed to pay the indemnities required to be paid by the AFL to the NFL, as stipulated by the merger agreement. Prior to the merger's announcement, Brown had not seriously considered joining the American Football League and was not a supporter of what he openly regarded to be an inferior competition, once famously stating that \"I didn't pay ten million dollars to be in the AFL.\"[28] However, with the announcement of the merger, Brown realized that the AFL expansion franchise would likely be his only realistic path back into the NFL in the short to medium term, and ultimately acquiesced to joining the AFL after learning that the team was guaranteed to become an NFL franchise after the merger was completed in 1970. There was also a major problem: Major League Baseball's Cincinnati Reds were in need of a facility to replace Crosley Field, which they had used since 1912. By this time, the small park was antiquated and rundown, and parking issues had plagued the city since the early 1950s, while the park also lacked modern amenities – issues that were exacerbated by the Mill Creek Expressway (I-75) project that ran alongside the park. While New York City – which had lost both its National League teams in 1957 after the Dodgers relocated to Los Angeles, and the Giants relocated to San Francisco – had actively courted Reds owner Powel Crosley to relocate his team there, Crosley was adamant that the Reds remain in Cincinnati and tolerated the worsening problems with the Crosley Field location. With assistance from Ohio governor Jim Rhodes, Hamilton County and the Cincinnati city council agreed to build a single multi-purpose facility on the dilapidated riverfront section of the city: the new facility had to be ready by the opening of the 1970 NFL season, and was officially named Riverfront Stadium. With the completion of the merger in 1970, the Cleveland Browns were one of three NFL teams that agreed to move to the AFL-based American Football Conference to give both conferences an equal number of teams and were placed in the AFC Central, the same division as the Bengals. An instant rivalry was born, fueled initially by Paul Brown's rivalry with Art Modell.[29][30] For their first two seasons, the Bengals played at Nippert Stadium, the current home of the University of Cincinnati Bearcats.[31] The team held training camp at Wilmington College in Wilmington, through the 1968 preseason. The team finished its first season with a 3–11 record[32] and running back Paul Robinson, who rushed for 1,023 yards, and was named the AFL Rookie of the Year.[33] Founder Paul Brown coached the team for its first eight seasons.[34] One of Brown's college draft strategies was to draft players from non-traditional football schools. Punter/wide receiver Pat McInally attended Harvard University, and linebacker Reggie Williams attended Dartmouth College and served on Cincinnati city council while on the Bengals' roster. Because of this policy, many former players went on to have successful careers in commentary and broadcasting as well as the arts. In addition, Brown had a knack for locating and recognizing pro football talent in unusual places.[35] In 1970, the Bengals moved to play at Riverfront Stadium, a home they shared with the Cincinnati Reds until the team moved to Paul Brown Stadium in 2000. Notable players of the 1970 team included Virgil Carter, Chip Meyers, Jack Meckstroth, Bob Trumpy, and Lemar Parrish. Virgil Carter threw for 1,647 yards. Chip Myers paced all receivers, catching 32 passes for 542 yards. Bob Trumpy contributed to the receiving game, too.[36] The team reached the playoffs three times during that decade, but could not win any of those postseason games. In 1975, the team posted an 11–3 record, giving them what remains the highest winning percentage (.786) in franchise history. But it only earned them a wild card spot in the playoffs, behind the 12–2 Pittsburgh Steelers, who went on to win the Super Bowl; the Bengals lost to the Oakland Raiders 31–28 in the divisional playoffs.[37] The Bengals reached the Super Bowl twice during the 1980s – in Super Bowl XVI and Super Bowl XXIII – and lost against the San Francisco 49ers both times.[38][39] The team appeared in the playoffs in 1990, making it to the second round before losing to the Los Angeles Raiders.[40] Before the following season got underway, Paul Brown died at age 82.[41] Due to declining health, he had already transferred control to his son, Mike Brown, but was reported to still influence the daily operations of the team.[42] The Bengals' fortunes changed for the worse as the team posted 14 consecutive non-winning seasons and were saddled with numerous draft busts. The Bengals began to emerge from that dismal period into a new era of increased consistency, however, after the team finished with its worst record in team history, 2–14, which led to the hiring of Marvin Lewis as head coach in 2003.[43] Carson Palmer, the future star quarterback, was drafted in 2003, but did not play a snap that whole season, as Jon Kitna had a comeback year (voted NFL Comeback Player of the Year).[44][45] Despite Kitna's success, Palmer was promoted to starting quarterback the following season.[46] The team finished with an 8–8 record and missed the postseason in 2004.[47] Under Palmer, the team advanced to the playoffs for the first time since 1990 losing in the Wild Card Roundto the Pittsburgh Steelers 31–17 in the 2005 season, which also was the first time the team had a winning percentage above .500 since 1990.[48][49][50] The Bengals returned to the playoffs again in 2009 in a season that included the franchise's first-ever division sweep. This was especially impressive since two of the teams swept by the Bengals – the Pittsburgh Steelers and the Baltimore Ravens – had made it to the AFC Championship Game the previous season. Marvin Lewis was rewarded for the accomplishment with the NFL Coach of the Year Award.[51] In the 2010 season, the Bengals posted a 4–12 record.[52] Following the disappointing 2010 season, quarterback Carson Palmer demanded to be traded. When the Bengals refused to do so, Palmer announced his retirement from the NFL.[53] He later was moved at the NFL trade deadline to the Oakland Raiders.[54] In the 2011 NFL draft, the Bengals selected wide receiver A. J. Green in the first round and quarterback Andy Dalton in the second round.[55] The Bengals improved to 9–7 in the 2011 season, and clinched a playoff spot.[56] Dalton and Green became the most prolific rookie WR-QB duo in history, connecting 65 times for 1,057 yards. However, they lost to the Houston Texans, 31–10, in the Wild Card round.[57] In the 2012 season, the Bengals clinched a playoff spot once more with a win over the Pittsburgh Steelers, going to the playoffs in back-to-back years for the first time since 1982.[58] However, the Bengals faced the Texans in the first round yet again and took another early exit, losing 19–13.[59] In the 2013 season, for the third straight year, the Bengals clinched a playoff berth and also won the AFC North, finishing with an 11–5 record.[60] But once again, the Bengals were defeated in the wild card round, this time by the San Diego Chargers, 27–10.[61] Most of the blame was put on Andy Dalton, who threw two interceptions and fumbled on a forward dive. This made the Bengals 0–5 in playoff games since Mike Brown took over as owner. The 2014 season started well, with the Bengals winning their first three contests against the Baltimore Ravens, Atlanta Falcons, and Tennessee Titans. However, they lost their Week 5 road matchup with the New England Patriots, 43–17. An overtime tie with the Carolina Panthers and a shutout loss to the Indianapolis Colts followed the primetime loss to the Patriots. Finishing the season 10–5–1 as the fifth seed, they lost to the Colts, 26–10, in the first round of the playoffs.[62][63] This was the first time the franchise made the playoffs four straight seasons. In 2015, the Bengals got out to a franchise-best 8–0 start with a 31–10 win over the Cleveland Browns.[64] Unfortunately, in Week 14 they would lose starting quarterback Andy Dalton to injury. He would not return that season, leaving A. J. McCarron to start under center. The Bengals finished with a franchise record-tying 12–4 mark.[65] Additionally, they lost to the division rival Pittsburgh Steelers, 18–16, in the Wild Card round in the final minute, making them the first franchise in NFL history to lose five straight opening-round playoff games.[66] This frustration continued in 2016 for the Bengals: they finished the 2016 campaign with a 6–9–1 record, losing several key players to injury, including A. J. Green, Giovani Bernard, and Jeremy Hill.[67][68] They missed the playoffs for the first time since 2010, marking the first time Andy Dalton missed the playoffs as the Bengals' starting quarterback. One notable game was a 27–27 tie against the Washington Redskins which was played in London in 2016.[69] Following a rough 2016 season, the Bengals looked forward into 2017. However, after starting 0–3, the Bengals never found their footing. At one point in the season, the Bengals were 5–9. There were rumors that Marvin Lewis would not return for the next season as the Bengals' head coach. However, after two come-from-behind victories over the Lions and Ravens that eliminated both teams from the playoffs, the Bengals finished 7–9.[70] The final two games were convincing enough for owner Mike Brown to give Lewis a new two-year contract.[71] The 2018 campaign began with promise for the Bengals under Lewis. Cincinnati began the season with a 4–1 record with impressive wins over the Colts, Ravens, Falcons, and Dolphins. However, the Bengals suffered many setbacks after the hot start: defensive coordinator Teryl Austin was fired mid-season because of defensive woes,[72] A. J. Green was injured and officially out for the last four games, and Andy Dalton injured his thumb in the Bengals' first game against the Browns and replaced by Jeff Driskel for the rest of the season.[73][74] The Bengals ended 2018 with a final record of 6–10 and finished last place in the AFC North.[75] On December 31, 2018, with one year to go on his contract, Lewis and the Bengals mutually parted ways after three straight losing seasons under his watch.[76] In 2019, they hired head coach Zac Taylor.[77] The 2019 campaign started off with reasonable success, with the Bengals barely losing to Seattle 21–20 at CenturyLink Field; but what started with promise ended in disaster.[78] The Bengals then lost 10 more games and were 0–11 heading into December 2019. To open the month of December, they got their first win of the season against the Jets, 22–6, in Cincinnati.[79] They eventually lost to the Patriots and then to the Dolphins, 38–35, in overtime after Dalton led the team back from 23 points down in the fourth quarter. With the loss to the Dolphins, the Bengals officially clinched the No. 1 overall pick in the 2020 NFL draft.[80] They capped off the season with a win against the Cleveland Browns, finishing 2–14, equaling the 2002 season as the team's worst record in history.[81][82] In 2020, the Bengals improved under rookies Joe Burrow and Tee Higgins.[83] Starting the season with a 2–5–1 record going into the bye week, including an overtime tie to the Philadelphia Eagles. Going into Week 11 facing the Washington Football Team, they lost Joe Burrow to a season-ending knee injury that all but ended their season, only winning two more contests against the Pittsburgh Steelers and Houston Texans.[84] Finishing the season 4–11–1.[85] In 2021, the Bengals won the AFC North with a 10–7 record, which included dominant sweeps of the rival Pittsburgh Steelers and Baltimore Ravens.[86] Led by Joe Burrow, who was playing in his first full season after recovering from his devastating knee injury in Week 11 of his rookie season and rookie receiver, and Burrow's college teammate at LSU, Ja'Marr Chase, Cincinnati would win the AFC North for the first time since 2015. They beat the Kansas City Chiefs, 34–31, in a Week 17 thriller to clinch the division. They then won their first playoff game since the 1990 season, beating the Las Vegas Raiders, 26–19, in the Wild Card round.[87] After that, they upset the top-seeded Tennessee Titans, 19–16, when Evan McPherson kicked a game-winning 52-yard field goal. A week later, they advanced to their first Super Bowl since 1989 when McPherson kicked a 33-yard field goal in overtime to cap off a comeback from being down 21–3 and shock the No. 2 seed Chiefs, 27–24. They lost a close Super Bowl to the Los Angeles Rams in Super Bowl LVI, 23–20.[88] In Week 1 of the 2022 NFL season, the Bengals lost, 23–20, to the Pittsburgh Steelers in overtime, breaking a three-game winning streak the Bengals had against Pittsburgh. After falling to a 4–4 record in Week 8, the Bengals proceeded to win 8 straight games to tie a franchise-record for single-season wins and earn a 3 seed in the AFC playoffs.[89][90] They defeated divisional rival Baltimore in the first round 24–17, behind a 98-yard fumble recovery returned for a touchdown by Sam Hubbard.[91][92] Despite missing three starting offensive linemen, the Bengals followed that up with a decisive 27–10 road win over the favored Buffalo Bills to reach a second straight AFC Championship appearance for the first time in franchise history.[93] Once again, they faced the Kansas City Chiefs in the Championship Game, but this time they lost 23–20, in another thrilling game.[94] In the 2023 season, during their Week 11 matchup against the Baltimore Ravens, Joe Burrow would suffer a wrist injury that would rule him out the rest of the season.[95] The consistent play of backup quarterback Jake Browning kept the Bengals alive in the postseason hunt after Burrow's injury.[96] The Bengals finished the season 9–8 and missed the playoffs.[97] When the team debuted in 1968, the Bengals' uniforms were modeled after the Cleveland Browns. When Paul Brown was fired by Art Modell, Brown still owned the equipment used by Cleveland, so after the firing, Paul Brown packed up all his equipment, which he then used for his new team in Cincinnati. The Cleveland Browns' team colors were brown, orange, and white, and their helmets were solid orange with a white dorsal stripe over the crest. The Bengals' team colors were orange, black, and white, and their helmets were a similar shade of orange, with the only variations being the word \"Bengals\" in black block letters (with a white outline) on either side of the helmet and no stripe on the helmet. The Cincinnati Bengals were unique in the NFL, as they did not have secondary uniform numbers on the jerseys (called \"TV numbers\") until they appeared on the sleeves in the 1980 season; they were the only NFL team that didn't have them prior to that point. That same year, the team changed their helmet face mask color from gray to black. The team did not discard their Cleveland-like uniforms until 1981. During that year, a then-unique uniform design was introduced: Although the team kept black jerseys, white jerseys, and white pants, they were now trimmed with orange and black tiger stripes. The team also introduced the orange helmets with black tiger stripes that are still in use today. Sports Illustrated likened the Bengals' new helmets to \"varicose pumpkins.\"[98] In 1997, the Bengals designed a logo consisting of a leaping tiger, and it was added to the uniform sleeves (with this, the TV numbers moved to the shoulder). Another alternate logo consisted of a Bengal's head facing to the left. However, the orange helmet with black tiger stripes continued to be the trademark. In 2004, a new tiger stripe pattern and more accents were added to the uniforms. The black jerseys now featured orange tiger-striped sleeves and white side panels, while the white jerseys began to use black tiger-striped sleeves and orange shoulders.[99] A new logo consisting of an orange \"B\" covered with black tiger stripes was introduced.[100] The team also started rotating black pants and debuted an alternate orange jersey, with white side panels and black tiger-striped sleeves. The Bengals have worn their black uniforms at home throughout their history, with some exceptions, such as the 1970 season, when the Bengals wore white at home for the entire season as well as most of the 1971 season (the Bengals were the first AFL team to wear white at home, as its rules required the home team to wear their dark jerseys, unlike the NFL, which allowed the home team choice of jersey color starting in 1964). Since 2005, the Bengals have worn white for September home games where the heat could become a factor. In 2016, the Bengals unveiled their all-white Color Rush alternate uniform, featuring black tiger stripes along the sleeves and pants. Orange was only used on the Nike mark, on the team logo, and as an outline color on the player's name.[101] The club announced a new uniform design on January 21, 2021. The new uniform design would be worn beginning with the 2021 NFL season.[102] The set retains the signature striped helmet, while simplifying the look by removing the side and shoulder panels, creating a new stripe pattern for the sleeves, getting rid of the number block shadow, and removing the stroke on the player's name. This set also puts the team's wordmark on the chest and lacks TV numbers on the sleeves. The shade of orange was changed, as well. The Bengals wore three different pants with this set: black pants with orange stripes, white pants with black stripes, and white pants with orange stripes. The white pants with black stripes were worn with the white jersey in 2021 playoff games at Tennessee and Kansas City. The white pants with orange stripes were worn with the black jersey in Super Bowl LVI against the Rams.[103] In 2022, after the NFL rescinded the \"one-helmet rule,\" the Bengals unveiled an alternate black-striped white helmet. In addition, the team brought back the all-white Color Rush uniform to be paired with the white helmets.[104][105] This would last one season, however, as the team decided to pair the white helmet with the primary white uniform for two games in 2023, effectively retiring the Color Rush uniform for the time being.[106] In 2024, the Bengals added orange pants to the uniform rotation after Madden NFL 25 leaked the option to the public.[107] The Bengals then unveiled a new all-orange uniform combination to be worn September 8 against the Patriots.[108] The team's official mascot is a Bengal tiger named Who Dey.[109] Its jersey number is 1.[110] Aside from Who Dey, the team also has the Ben-Gals, the team's cheerleading squad,[111] which included Laura Vikmanis, the oldest cheerleader in league history.[112] Carol Motsinger in 2015 said, \"In 2012, Cincinnati welcomed another tiger named Who Dey. This time, one that walks on four legs. More than 1,000 Bengals season ticket holders named a Malayan tiger Who Dey at Cincinnati Zoo & Botanical Garden. He was recently traded to a zoo in Kansas.\"[113] The Ohio History Central notes: \"In 1940, a third American Football League formed, and the Cincinnati Bengals joined it. Unfortunately, World War II began the following year, causing manpower shortages as men joined the armed forces. This prompted this newer AFL to cease playing after the 1941 season. Paul Brown, former coach of the Cleveland Browns, received authorization from a modern American Football League to create a team in Cincinnati. Brown chose the name Bengals to memorialize the teams of the same name that had represented Cincinnati in the past.\"[114] The Bengals' historic rivalry with the Cleveland Browns is often referred to as the \"Battle of Ohio\", started as the result of former Browns head coach and team founder Paul Brown starting the Bengals franchise after leaving the Browns.[115] The colors of each team are similar since Paul Brown chose the exact shade of orange used by the Browns for the Bengals, and the Bengals' original uniforms were identical to the Browns' uniforms, excluding the word \"Bengals\" on the helmet. The rivalry reached its peak during the 1980s when both teams were vying viciously for a spot in the playoffs. During the 1990s the rivalry also butted heads when Brown's sons were in charge of the day-to-day operations of the Bengals.[116] The Bengals lead the series 53–48 as of the end of the 2023 season.[117] The Bengals and Pittsburgh Steelers have played each other twice a year since becoming division rivals in 1970. This rivalry has gained intensity since the 2000s, as the teams have met twice in the playoffs, with both games being marked by hard hits and injuries with the most infamous example occurring in the 2005 playoffs.[118][119][120] The Steelers lead the overall series 70–39 and the postseason series 2–0.[121] However, the Steelers have been more dominant recently, posting a record of 28–7 since 2004, when they drafted Roethlisberger. There were two times that the rivalry has met during the playoffs: the Wild Card rounds of 2005 and 2015, with the Steelers winning both meetings at Cincinnati. The 2005 game is marked as a special time in the rivalry because this is when Steelers defensive tackle Kimo Von Oelhoffen injured Bengals quarterback Carson Palmer,[122] while the 2015 game is also special because Bengals running back Jeremy Hill fumbled the ball in the waning minutes when the Bengals had a 16–15 lead over the Steelers to give the latter one last chance. They used that chance wisely as they drove down the field (with the help of two costly personal fouls by the Bengals) and kicked a game-winning field goal.[123] The Bengals' rivalry with the Baltimore Ravens began when the original Browns franchise relocated to Baltimore to become the Ravens. Since then, the rivalry heated up when longtime Ravens defensive coordinator Marvin Lewis was hired as the head coach of the Bengals. The Ravens lead the all-time series 30–27 as of the 2023 season.[124] The Bengals won the only playoff meeting in the 2022 AFC Wild Card round.[125] The Joe Burrow-led Bengals have developed a recent rivalry with the Kansas City Chiefs, with Burrow being the only AFC quarterback to date to hold a winning record against Mahomes.[126] As of the 2023 season, the Bengals lead the all-time series 18–16.[127] The Bengals have played the Titans more than any non-divisional opponent by a significant margin. The Titans lead the all-time series 41–37–1.[128] A no-huddle offense was commonly used by all teams when time in the game was running low. However, Sam Wyche, the head coach of the Bengals in 1988, along with offensive coordinator Bruce Coslet, made the high-paced offense the standard modality for the ball club regardless of time remaining. By quickly substituting and setting up for the next play—often within 5–10 seconds after the last play despite being afforded 45 seconds—the Bengals hindered the other team's defense from substituting situational players, regrouping for tactics, and resting. In response, the NFL instituted rules allowing the defense ample time for substitutions when offensive substitutions were made. The hurry-up tactic was used by the franchise during the late 1980s while Sam Wyche was the coach. A rival for AFC supremacy during this time was the Buffalo Bills, coached by Marv Levy, who also used a version of the no-huddle offense starting with the 1989 season. The Bengals had beaten the Bills three times in 1988 (pre-season, regular season, and the AFC Championship Game). Marv Levy threatened to fake injuries if the Bengals used the \"no-huddle\" in the AFC Championship. Wyche was notified that the commissioner had ordered the \"no-huddle\" illegal for the game. The official notified Wyche and the Bengals' team just two hours before the game kickoff.[129] Wyche asked to talk directly to the commissioner and word immediately came back that the \"no-huddle\" would not be penalized. Levy did not have his players' fake injuries in the game but installed his version the next year, 1989. The Bengals first used the \"no-huddle\" in 1984.[130] Most of the high-profile games (the various games for AFC titles and regular-season games) between the two led to these changes in NFL rules. Wyche also first used the timeout periods as an opportunity to bring his entire team to the sideline to talk to all eleven players, plus substitutes, at one time. This allowed trainers time to treat a cut or bruise and equipment managers time to repair an equipment defect. The West Coast offense is the popular name for the high-percentage passing scheme designed by former Bengals assistant Bill Walsh.[131] Walsh formulated what has become popularly known as the West Coast offense during his tenure as assistant coach for the Cincinnati Bengals from 1968 to 1975, while working under the tutelage of Brown (and before embarking on his legendary coaching tenure with the San Francisco 49ers in the 1980s). Bengals quarterback Virgil Carter was the first player to successfully implement Walsh's system, leading the NFL in pass completion percentage in 1971.[132] Ken Anderson replaced Carter as Cincinnati's starting quarterback in 1972 and was even more successful. In 1975 he would bring widespread recognition to the West Coast offense as well as to the Cincinnati team and its quarterback in a nationally televised Monday night contest between the Bengals and a Buffalo Bills team built around the running game of star player O. J. Simpson. Anderson's 447 passing yards were enough to overcome Simpson's 197 yards on the ground in a game that proved a milestone, providing a striking contrast between the \"old\" game of defense-minded football and the new game of higher scores and more action through a sophisticated aerial attack.[133] The game, in effect, offered its viewers a glimpse of the future of professional football. Anderson, who was drafted by Paul Brown in 1971 and installed as starting quarterback in 1972, made four trips to the Pro Bowl, won four passing titles, was named NFL MVP in 1981, and set the record for completion percentage in a single season in 1982 with 70.66%. Defeated frequently during the 1970s by the Pittsburgh Steelers, a team that won four Super Bowls with 9 future Hall of Fame players, the Bengals under Anderson and head coach Forrest Gregg would finally break through the Steel Curtain, defeating the Steelers during both of their meetings in 1980 and again in 1981. Anderson, who had been named the \"team franchise\" by Bengal tight end Bob Trumpy, would ultimately prove his worth with a career record of 91 wins and 81 losses.[134] The defense created to combat the West Coast offense also came from Cincinnati. Then-Bengals defensive coordinator Dick LeBeau (who later served as the team's head coach from 2000 to 2002) created the zone blitz in the 1980s in response to the West Coast offense.[135] Running backs (RB) Wide receivers (WR) Tight ends (TE) Defensive linemen (DL) Defensive backs (DB) Special teams Reserve 52 active, 13 reserve, 14 practice squad In addition, Despite not being formally retired, the Bengals have certain numbers that are in limited circulation: There are four members of the Hall of Fame that have spent some portion of their career with the Bengals, but only Anthony Muñoz and Ken Riley spent their entire playing careers with the Bengals. Listed below are only Hall of Famers whose induction includes their tenure with the Bengals. Bengals founder and first coach Paul Brown is in the Hall of Fame, but was inducted before founding the team and is not credited as a Bengals Hall of Famer. Additionally, the Bengals have had two head coaches, Forrest Gregg and Dick LeBeau inducted for their playing career. In 2007, in celebration of their 40th anniversary the Bengals named an all-time team voted on by the fans.[148] Source:[149] The Bengals announced they would begin a Ring of Honor in 2021.[150] The inaugural class included Pro Football Hall of Fame tackle Anthony Muñoz and Paul Brown, who was the franchise's founder and first coach,[151] with Ken Anderson and Ken Riley added after a season ticket holder vote.[152] *Posthumous induction → Coaching staff → Front office → More NFL staffs The Bengals contract with iHeartMedia as their radio partner,[153] with their flagship radio stations being WCKY (1530) and WEBN (102.7 FM), along with WLW (700) if not in conflict with the Reds. Most preseason and regular season games, are telecast on WKRC-TV, channel 12, the CBS affiliate. Mike Watts and Anthony Muñoz are the TV announcers for preseason games, with Mike Valpredo as the sideline reporter.[154] Games that feature an NFC opponent playing at Paycor Stadium will be televised on WXIX, channel 19, the local Fox affiliate. WLWT-TV airs games when the Bengals are featured on Sunday Night Football. The radio broadcasting crew consists of Dan Hoard (play-by-play), and Dave Lapham (analyst).[155] \"The Bengal Growl\" is the Bengals fight song. It was written by Bengals entertainment director George \"Red\" Bird upon the team's founding in 1968. Bird had been friends with Paul Brown for over 30 years. The two had met at Massillon Washington High School when Brown was head football coach and Bird was director of the famed Massillon Tiger Swing Band. Bird had served as the Browns' music and entertainment director in 1946, and kept that role until Brown convinced him to come to Cincinnati in 1968. His first task was to pen a fight song along the lines of the Browns' fight song, \"Hi! O-Hi-O for Cleveland!\" The song remains very popular among Bengals fans, who are known to belt out the song at \"Bengals backer\" bars all over the country. In 2021, Elizabeth Blackburn, now the team's head of strategy and fan engagement, told The Athletic recalled stopping at one such bar in San Francisco during the 2015 playoffs, and was surprised to hear the viewers break out into the song. As a measure of how popular the song remains among the Bengals fan base, when Blackburn wrote an editorial on her efforts to overhaul the team's image for the Bengals Web site, Blackburn specifically mentioned that the song was not going anywhere.[156] \"Welcome to the Jungle\" is also a fight song for the Bengals.[157][158] The song is mainly played before kick-offs to intimidate visiting teams. \"Who Dey?!\" is the name of a chant of support by fans of the Cincinnati Bengals, in use since the 1980s. The entire chant is: \"Who dey, who dey, who dey think gonna beat dem Bengals?\"[159] The answer screamed in unison, \"Nobody.\" Sometimes fans will instead shout \"Who Dey?\" to represent the entire cheer. \"Who Dey\" is also the name of the team's mascot, a Bengal tiger.[110] Saying \"Who Dey\" at Bengals games is steeped in local beer lore. Hudy, a leading product of Hudepohl Brewing Company 1978 through the late 1980s, bears a phonetic similarity to the \"Who Dey\" chant. Beer vendors who carried full cases of bottled local beer up and down the steep upper stairs of what was then Riverfront Stadium would call out \"If Hudy\", \"Burger\" and other local beer names. Raucous fans would often chant back and forth with them as the vendors called out. During the 1980 season, the banter with the Hudepohl vendors grew organically into the now famous (Hu-Dey) -Who They?- chant.[160] The full Who Dey chant was first known to be used by fans of the 1980 Cincinnati Bengals.[161] While the origin of the chant is disputed, one possible source for the chant is a 1980 commercial for (the now-defunct) Red Frazier Ford of Cincinnati, which used this tagline: \"Who's going to give you a better deal than Red Frazier?...Nobody!\" Cincinnati fans who had seen the commercial many times may have just copied it when cheering.[162] The chant bears some similarities to the phrase \"Who Dat?\", which was officially adopted by the New Orleans Saints in 1983 but had been used by Louisiana's high school team fans for some time. The saying \"Who Dat?\" originated in minstrel shows and vaudeville acts in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, then it was taken up by New Orleans Jazz and various Big band folks in the 1920s and 1930s. In the late 1960s, local Louisiana High Schools, St. Augustine High School and Patterson High School reportedly have been using the cheer and Gulf Coast fans of Alcorn State University and Louisiana State University picked up the cheer in the 1970s. Southern University in Baton Rouge, Louisiana claims to have originated the cheer in the late 1960s in their version: \"Who dat talking 'bout beating dem Jags?\"[163]",

                "content": "If not listed, please contact your TV provider. JACKSONVILLE, Fla. (AP) Davante Adams and Aaron Rodgers gave the New York Jets' next general manager and head coach something to ponder with a glimpse into the past - and potentially the future. Adams caught nine passes from Rodgers for 198 yards and two touchdowns - all in the second half - and the Jets rallied to beat the Jacksonville Jaguars 32-25 to end a four-game skid Sunday. Adams hauled in a 71-yard TD pass with 3:24 remaining and a 41-yarder that set up Breece Hall's 1-yard plunge with 1:05 to play. In between, he made a circus catch along the sideline for a first down. It was vintage Adams, who became the 12th player in NFL history with 100 receiving touchdowns. And vintage Rodgers, who threw for 289 yards and three scores as the Jets (4-10) topped 30 points for the first time this season. The 41-year-old quarterback also led New York with 45 yards rushing. “Historic, magical,\" Jets interim coach Jeff Ulbrich said. \"To get his 100th TD ... I feel honored to have seen it and to have been here for it. It was an amazing moment for those two guys. Obviously, a lot of ball between them and a lot of touchdowns. So, for them to get that was special.” No one would be totally surprised to see the Jets run it back with Rodgers and Adams, even though the former Green Bay teammates are scheduled to count nearly $52 million against the Jets’ salary cap in 2025. After all, they showed their potential together against the Jags. “Oh yeah, today was one of those days in the second half,\" Adams said. “Definitely felt very, very similar to the way we used to get it rolling.\" Adams' 100th TD grab came on a 1-yard fade route in the third quarter. No. 101 was even more impressive. He streaked down the middle of the field, running past linebacker Devin Lloyd and seeing no safety help from Darnell Savage until it was too late. Adams was completely uncovered in the flat for the 41-yarder and then tackled at the 1. The Jets probably should have taken a knee from there, forced Jacksonville to use its remaining timeouts and kicked a short field goal to win it. But Hall's plunge gave the Jaguars (3-11) a chance late. “I wanted to be aggressive, and I wanted the points,” Ulbrich said. \"I wanted to put the nail in the coffin at the end.” Mac Jones drove Jacksonville into Jets territory before throwing his second interception of the day. Sauce Gardner's first pick of the season essentially ended the game. Jones completed 31 of 46 passes for 294 yards, with two touchdowns to rookie Brian Thomas Jr. and two interceptions. Thomas finished with 10 catches for 105 yards. Tight end Brenton Strange caught 11 passes for 73 yards. Jones looked as though he would improve to 6-0 as a starter against the Jets, and the Jaguars looked like they would win consecutive games for the first time in 13 months. But Rodgers and Adams had other thoughts. The duo has now connected 81 times for touchdowns, including the playoffs, for the fourth most by a QB-WR duo in NFL history. They are one shy of Miami’s Dan Marino and Mark Clayton. “Aaron is a great quarterback. He’s a Hall of Fame quarterback,” Jaguars coach Doug Pederson said. “They made plays that we didn’t make, and that part’s unfortunate. It comes down to just a couple plays in your season or your game or whatever could be a little bit different.” Both teams got off to fast starts - a rarity this season. The Jaguars scored a touchdown on their opening drive for the first time in 19 games. It had been the longest drought in the NFL. The Jets answered with their first opening-driving touchdown of the season. Rodgers connected with Garrett Wilson for a 22-yarder after the Jaguars left him wide open down the middle. Thomas, Jacksonville's first-round draft pick, broke two single-season team rookie receiving records that he had been chasing for weeks. He topped Justin Blackmon’s franchise mark of 865 yards receiving (2012) and hauled in his seventh TD catch, snapping a tie with Allen Hurns (2014). Jaguars defensive tackle Jeremiah Ledbetter, a 30-year-old veteran and a 300-pound defender, celebrated his third-quarter sack of Rodgers with an impressive backflip. Ledbetter’s second sack of the season resulted in a 14-yard loss and forced the Jets to settle for a field goal. Jets safety Jalen Mills (chest), safety Tony Adams (facial lacerations), linebacker Jamien Sherwood (evaluated for a concussion), running back Braelon Allen (back) and nickel cornerback Michael Carter (back) left the game. Adams, Sherwood and Allen returned. Jets: host the Los Angeles Rams next Sunday. Jaguars: play at the Las Vegas Raiders next Sunday. --- AP NFL: https://apnews.com/hub/nfl Copyright 2024 STATS LLC and Associated Press.

The Jaguars failed to build off last week’s 10-6 win against the Titans. A win Sunday would have marked the teams first achieved back-to-back wins in over a year. After struggling offensively throughout the season, Jacksonville was able to move the ball well against the New York’s defense. Quarterback Mac Jones, starting in place of the injured Trevor Lawrence, went 31-for-46 with 294 passing yards, two touchdowns and two interceptions. Rookie star wide receiver Brian Thomas Jr. caught 10 passes for 105 yards and two touchdowns. Thomas also broke both the Jaguars’ all-time rookie total receiving yards (851) and receiving touchdowns (6) during the contest.

                "title": "Final Score: New York Jets 32, Jacksonville Jaguars 25            - Gang Green Nation",
                "content": "Filed under: The Jets finally win one despite themselves In the 14th game of the 2024 season for the New York Jets, on a balmy late autumn afternoon in Jacksonville, Florida, the New York Jets survived a game they tried mightily to give away as they beat the Jacksonville Jaguars, 32 - 25. It was the Jets’ first victory since Halloween. After a first half in which the Jets couldn’t get anything going on offense and couldn’t stop the Jaguars from multiple long grinding drives on defense, the Jets went into the locker room at halftime trailing 13 - 7. It could have been much worse, as the Jaguars settled for field goals twice on drives where they had a first and goal situation. The Jaguars dominated the first half, though the scoreboard said otherwise. The Jets opened the third quarter on offense and drove down to the Jaguars 12 yard line, aided by a pass interference penalty drawn by Garrett Wilson. From there the Jets were pushed backwards before settling for a 43 yard field goal that drew the Jets within three points at 13 - 10. The Jaguars immediately answered with a field goal drive of their own. The Jets defense, facing a bad Jaguars offense featuring perhaps the worst starting quarterback in the NFL, one of the worst running games in the NFL, and one of the worst group of receivers in the NFL, was getting dominated in a lifeless performance. The only thing keeping the Jets in the game was the Jaguars’ inability to convert long drives into touchdowns. On the Jets next possession the Aaron Rodgers to Davante Adams connection got going, as Adams secured three receptions for 47 yards, including a one yard touchdown pass. That gave the Jets the lead for the first time in the game at 17 - 16 late in the third quarter. Now it was up to the defense to find a way to stop the Jaguars. The Jets defense rose to the occasion, at least for a moment, as they forced a quick three and out by the Jaguars and the Jets offense took over again. They couldn’t take advantage of the opportunity. The third quarter ended with the Jets having a fourth down in their own territory. The fourth quarter opened with the Jets punting and the Jaguars offense taking over at their 27 yard line. A Jets team that hasn’t been able to stand prosperity all season immediately stunk up the place. The Jaguars marched right down the field and scored on a Mac Jones to Brian Thomas touchdown pass. The extra point was missed, giving the Jaguars a 22 - 17 lead with just under 11 minutes left in the game. The ensuing Jets drive got into Jaguars territory before a crucial Allen Lazard drop inside the five yard line brought the Jets to a halt. They had to settle for a 48 yard field goal attempt, which Anders Carlson missed, and the score remained 22 - 17 in favor of the Jaguars with under eight minutes remaining in the fourth quarter. The Jets defense allowed the Jaguars to chew up the clock before stopping them in Jets territory, forcing a punt. The Jets offense took over with less than 4:30 remaining in the game, needing a touchdown. One last chance to avoid one of the more embarrassing defeats in a mortifyingly embarrassing season. A few plays and less than a minute later the Jets were in the end zone, courtesy of a 71 yard bomb from Aaron Rodgers to Davante Adams. The Jets converted a two point try and the Jets had a three point lead at 25 -22 with 3:24 left in the fourth quarter. Now it was the defense’s turn to close out the game. They were not up to the task. The Jaguars went down the field and scored on a 43 yard field goal, tying the game at 25 with less than two minutes remaining. The Jets took less than a minute to take the ball down to the Jaguars one yard line, highlighted by a pair of big plays by Davante Adams. They then foolishly ran the ball in for a touchdown against a Jaguars defense that was conceding the play. That gave the Jets a 32 -25 lead, but it left more than a minute and two timeouts for the Jaguars to even the score. Poor time management continued to plague the Jets. A few seconds later the Jets were bailed out of their poor clock management when Mac Jones sailed a terrible pass, Sauce Gardner secured his first interception of the season, and the Jets escaped with a hard fought 32 - 25 victory. With the win the Jets lifted their record to 4-10 on the season. The Jets are at home next week to take on the Los Angeles Rams. Gambling Problem? Call 1-800-GAMBLER (1-800-426-2537). Hope is here.
