                "content": "Taylor Alison Swift (born December 13, 1989) is an American singer-songwriter. Known for her biographical songwriting, artistic reinventions, and cultural impact, Swift is a leading figure in popular music and the subject of widespread public interest. Swift signed to Big Machine Records in 2005, starting as a country singer with the albums Taylor Swift (2006) and Fearless (2008). Her singles \"Teardrops on My Guitar\", \"Love Story\", and \"You Belong with Me\" found crossover success on country and pop radio formats. She experimented with rock on Speak Now (2010) and electronic on Red (2012), later re-calibrating her image from country to pop with the synth-pop album 1989 (2014); the ensuing media scrutiny inspired the hip-hop-imbued Reputation (2017). The albums contained the Billboard Hot 100 number-one singles \"We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together\", \"Shake It Off\", \"Blank Space\", \"Bad Blood\" and \"Look What You Made Me Do\". Shifting to Republic Records in 2018, Swift released the electropop album Lover (2019) and the autobiographical documentary Miss Americana (2020), explored indie folk styles in the 2020 albums Folklore and Evermore, and subdued pop genres on Midnights (2022) and The Tortured Poets Department (2024). She began re-recording her Big Machine albums as Taylor's Version[a] since 2021, due to an ownership dispute with the label. Through the 2020s, she garnered the US number one songs \"Cardigan\", \"Willow\", \"All Too Well\", \"Anti-Hero\", \"Cruel Summer\", \"Is It Over Now?\", and \"Fortnight\". Her sixth concert tour, the Eras Tour (2023–2024), and its accompanying concert film are respectively the highest-grossing tour and concert film of all time. Swift is one of the world's best-selling music artists, with over 200 million units sold and a record seven albums that moved one million copies first-week. She is the highest-grossing touring act, the first billionaire with music as primary income, and the world's richest female musician. She has been listed amongst history's greatest artists by publications such as Rolling Stone, Billboard and Forbes, as well as the only individual from the arts to have been named the Time Person of the Year (2023). Her accolades include 14 Grammy Awards, a Primetime Emmy Award, 40 American Music Awards, 30 MTV Video Music Awards, and 50 Billboard Music Awards, having won the Grammy Award for Album of the Year, MTV Video Music Award for Video of the Year and the IFPI Global Recording Artist of the Year at least four times each. She is an advocate of artists' rights and women's empowerment. Her fans are known as Swifties. Taylor Alison Swift was born on December 13, 1989, in West Reading, Pennsylvania.[1] She is named after the singer-songwriter James Taylor.[2][3] Her father, Scott Kingsley Swift, was a stockbroker for Merrill Lynch, and her mother, Andrea Gardner Swift (née Finlay), worked as a mutual fund marketing executive.[4] Swift's younger brother, Austin, is an actor.[5] Their maternal grandmother, Marjorie Finlay (née Moehlenkamp), was an opera singer,[6] whose singing in church became one of Swift's earliest memories of music that shaped her career.[4] Swift is of Scottish, English, and German descent, with distant Italian and Irish ancestry.[7][8][9] Swift spent her early years on a Christmas tree farm in Pennsylvania that her father had purchased from one of his clients,[10] and she spent her summers at her family's vacation home in Stone Harbor, New Jersey, where she occasionally performed acoustic songs at a local coffee shop.[11] She is a Christian[12] and attended preschool and kindergarten at a Montessori school run by the Bernardine Sisters of St. Francis before transferring to the Wyndcroft School.[13][14] When her family moved to Wyomissing, she attended Wyomissing Area Junior/Senior High School.[15][16] As a child, she performed in Berks Youth Theatre Academy productions[17] and traveled regularly to New York City for vocal and acting lessons.[18] Her early love for country music was influenced by Shania Twain, Patsy Cline, LeAnn Rimes, and the Dixie Chicks,[14] and she spent weekends performing at local festivals and events.[19][20] After watching a documentary about Faith Hill, she became determined to pursue a country-music career in Nashville, Tennessee.[21] At 11, Swift traveled to Nashville with her mother to visit record labels and submit demo tapes of Dolly Parton and Dixie Chicks karaoke covers.[22] She was rejected by all the labels, which led her to focus on songwriting.[23] She started learning the guitar at 12 with the help of Ronnie Cremer, a computer repairman and local musician who also assisted Swift with writing an original song.[24] In 2003, Swift and her parents started working with the talent manager Dan Dymtrow. With his help, Swift modeled for Abercrombie & Fitch and had an original song included on a Maybelline compilation CD.[25] After performing original songs at an RCA Records showcase, 13-year-old Swift was given an artist development deal and began to travel regularly to Nashville with her mother.[26][27] To help Swift break into the country music scene, her father transferred to Merrill Lynch's Nashville office when she was 14 years old, and the family relocated to Hendersonville, Tennessee.[28][29] Swift attended Hendersonville High School[30] before transferring to Aaron Academy after two years, which better accommodated her touring schedule through homeschooling. She graduated one year early.[3][31] In Nashville, Swift worked with experienced Music Row songwriters such as Troy Verges, Brett Beavers, Brett James, Mac McAnally, and the Warren Brothers[32][33] and formed a lasting working relationship with Liz Rose.[34] They began meeting for two-hour writing sessions every Tuesday afternoon after school.[35] Rose called the sessions \"some of the easiest I've ever done. Basically, I was just her editor. She'd write about what happened in school that day. She had such a clear vision of what she was trying to say. And she'd come in with the most incredible hooks.\" Swift became the youngest artist signed by Sony/ATV Tree Music Publishing,[36] but left then BMG-owned RCA Records (later bought by Sony Music) at the age of 14 due to the label's lack of care and them \"cut[ting] other people's stuff\". She was also concerned that development deals can shelve artists[27][20] and recalled: \"I genuinely felt that I was running out of time. I wanted to capture these years of my life on an album while they still represented what I was going through.\"[37] At an industry showcase at Nashville's Bluebird Cafe in 2005, Swift caught the attention of Scott Borchetta, a DreamWorks Records executive who was preparing to form an independent record label, Big Machine Records. She had first met Borchetta in 2004.[39] She was one of Big Machine's first signings,[27] and her father purchased a three-percent stake in the company for an estimated $120,000.[40][41][42] She began working on her eponymous debut album with Nathan Chapman.[20] Swift wrote or co-wrote all album tracks, and co-writers included Rose, Robert Ellis Orrall, Brian Maher, and Angelo Petraglia.[43] Released in October 2006, Taylor Swift peaked at number five on the US Billboard 200, on which it spent 157 weeks—the longest stay on the chart by any release in the US in the 2000s decade.[44][45] Swift became the first female country music artist to write or co-write every track on a platinum-certified debut album.[46] Big Machine Records was still in its infancy during the June 2006 release of the lead single, \"Tim McGraw\", which Swift and her mother helped promote by packaging and sending copies of the CD single to country radio stations.[47] She spent much of 2006 promoting Taylor Swift with a radio tour and television appearances; she opened for Rascal Flatts on select dates during their 2006 tour,[48] as a replacement for Eric Church.[49] Borchetta said that although record industry peers initially disapproved of his signing a 15-year-old singer-songwriter, Swift tapped into a previously unknown market—teenage girls who listen to country music.[47][28] Following \"Tim McGraw\", four more singles were released throughout 2007 and 2008: \"Teardrops on My Guitar\", \"Our Song\", \"Picture to Burn\", and \"Should've Said No\". All appeared on Billboard's Hot Country Songs, with \"Our Song\" and \"Should've Said No\" reaching number one. \"Our Song\" made Swift the youngest person to single-handedly write and sing a Hot Country Songs number-one single,[50] and \"Teardrops on My Guitar\" was Swift's breakthrough single on mainstream radio and charts.[51][52][53] Swift released two EPs, The Taylor Swift Holiday Collection in October 2007 and Beautiful Eyes in July 2008.[54][55] She promoted her debut album extensively as the opening act for other country musicians' tours in 2006 and 2007, including those by George Strait,[56] Brad Paisley,[57] and Tim McGraw and Faith Hill.[58] Swift won multiple accolades for Taylor Swift. She was one of the recipients of the Nashville Songwriters Association's Songwriter/Artist of the Year in 2007, becoming the youngest person given the title.[59] She also won the Country Music Association's Horizon Award for Best New Artist,[60] the Academy of Country Music Awards' Top New Female Vocalist,[61] and the American Music Awards' Favorite Country Female Artist honor.[62] She was also nominated for Best New Artist at the 50th Annual Grammy Awards.[63] In 2008, she opened for Rascal Flatts again[64] and briefly dated the singer Joe Jonas.[65] Swift's second studio album, Fearless, was released in November 2008 in North America,[66] and in March 2009 in other markets.[67] On the Billboard 200, Fearless spent 11 weeks at number one, becoming Swift's first chart topper and the longest-running number-one female country album.[68] It was the bestselling album of 2009 in the US.[69] Its lead single, \"Love Story\", was her first number one in Australia and the first country song to top Billboard's Pop Songs chart,[70][71] and its third single, \"You Belong with Me\", was the first country song to top Billboard's all-genre Radio Songs chart.[72] Three other singles were released in 2008–2010: \"White Horse\", \"Fifteen\", and \"Fearless\". All five singles were Hot Country Songs top 10 entries, with \"Love Story\" and \"You Belong with Me\" topping the chart.[73] In 2009, Swift toured as an opening act for Keith Urban and embarked on her first headlining tour, the Fearless Tour.[74] \"You Belong with Me\" won Best Female Video at the 2009 MTV Video Music Awards.[75] Her acceptance speech was interrupted by the rapper Kanye West, an incident that became the subject of controversy and widespread media coverage.[76] That year, Swift won five American Music Awards, including Artist of the Year and Favorite Country Album.[77] Billboard named her the 2009 Artist of the Year.[78] She won Video of the Year and Female Video of the Year for \"Love Story\" at the 2009 CMT Music Awards, where she made a parody video of the song with rapper T-Pain called \"Thug Story\".[79] At the 52nd Annual Grammy Awards, Fearless was named Album of the Year and Best Country Album, and \"White Horse\" won Best Country Song and Best Female Country Vocal Performance.[80] At the 2009 Country Music Association Awards, Swift won Album of the Year for Fearless and was named Entertainer of the Year, the youngest person to win the honor.[81] Throughout 2009, Swift featured on and wrote other musicians' releases. She featured on \"Half of My Heart\" by John Mayer, whom she was romantically linked with in late 2009.[82][83] She wrote \"Best Days of Your Life\" for Kellie Pickler,[84] co-wrote and featured on Boys Like Girls' \"Two Is Better Than One,[85] and wrote two songs—\"You'll Always Find Your Way Back Home\" and \"Crazier\"—for the soundtrack of Hannah Montana: The Movie, in which she had a cameo appearance.[86][87] She wrote and recorded \"Today Was a Fairytale\" for the soundtrack of Valentine's Day (2010), in which she had her acting debut.[88] \"Today Was a Fairytale\" was her first number-one single on the Canadian Hot 100.[89] While shooting Valentine's Day in October 2009, Swift dated co-star Taylor Lautner.[90] On television, she made her debut as a rebellious teenager in an CSI: Crime Scene Investigation episode[91] and hosted and performed as the musical guest on Saturday Night Live; she was the first host ever to write their own opening monologue.[92][93] Swift's third studio album, Speak Now, was released in October 2010.[94] Written solely by Swift,[95] the album debuted the Billboard 200 with over one million US copies sold first week[96] and became the fastest-selling digital album by a female artist.[97] Speak Now was supported by six singles: \"Mine\", \"Back to December\", \"Mean\", \"The Story of Us\", \"Sparks Fly\", and \"Ours\". \"Mine\" peaked at number three and was the highest-charting single on the Billboard Hot 100,[98] the first three singles reached the top 10 in Canada,[89] and the last two reached number one on Hot Country Songs.[73] Swift promoted Speak Now with the Speak Now World Tour from February 2011 to March 2012[99] and the live album Speak Now World Tour – Live.[100] At the 54th Annual Grammy Awards in 2012, Swift performed \"Mean\", which won Best Country Song and Best Country Solo Performance.[101] She was named Songwriter/Artist of the Year by the Nashville Songwriters Association (2010 and 2011),[102][103] Woman of the Year by Billboard (2011),[104] and Entertainer of the Year by the Academy of Country Music (2011 and 2012)[105] and the Country Music Association in 2011.[106] At the American Music Awards of 2011, Swift won Artist of the Year and Favorite Country Album.[107] Rolling Stone named Speak Now on its list of \"50 Best Female Albums of All Time\" (2012).[108] Red, Swift's fourth studio album, was released in October 2012.[109] On Red, Swift worked with Chapman and new producers including Max Martin, Shellback, Dan Wilson, Jeff Bhasker, Dann Huff, and Butch Walker, resulting in a genre-spanning record that incorporated eclectic styles of pop and rock such as Britrock, dubstep, and dance-pop.[110][111] The album opened at number one on the Billboard 200 with 1.21 million sales[112] and was Swift's first number-one album in the UK.[113] Its lead single, \"We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together\", was her first number one on the Billboard Hot 100,[114] and its third single, \"I Knew You Were Trouble\", reached the top five on charts worldwide.[115] Other singles from Red were \"Begin Again\", \"22\", \"Everything Has Changed\", \"The Last Time\", and \"Red\".[116] Red and its single \"Begin Again\" received three nominations at the 56th Annual Grammy Awards (2014).[117] Swift received American Music Awards for Best Female Country Artist in 2012, Artist of the Year in 2013,[118][119] and the Nashville Songwriters Association's Songwriter/Artist Award for the fifth and sixth consecutive years.[120] At the 2014 Country Music Association Awards, Swift was honored with the Pinnacle Award, making her the second recipient in history after Garth Brooks.[121] The Red Tour ran from March 2013 to June 2014 and became the highest-grossing country tour upon completion.[122] Swift continued writing songs for films and featuring on other artists' releases. On the soundtrack album to The Hunger Games (2012), Swift wrote and recorded \"Eyes Open\" and \"Safe & Sound\"; the latter of which was co-written with the Civil Wars and T-Bone Burnett. \"Safe & Sound\" won the Grammy Award for Best Song Written for Visual Media.[123] She wrote and produced \"Sweeter than Fiction\" with Jack Antonoff for the soundtrack to One Chance (2013).[124] Swift featured on B.o.B's \"Both of Us\" (2012)[125] and provided vocals for Tim McGraw's \"Highway Don't Care\" (2013), also featuring Keith Urban.[126] She was a voice actress in The Lorax (2012),[127] made a cameo in the sitcom New Girl (2013),[128] and had a supporting role in the dystopian film The Giver (2014).[129] From 2010 to 2013, Swift was romantically involved with the actor Jake Gyllenhaal, the political heir Conor Kennedy, and the singer Harry Styles.[83] In March 2014, Swift began living in New York City, which she credited as a creative influence on her fifth studio album, 1989.[note 1] She described 1989 as her first \"official pop album\" and produced it with Jack Antonoff, Max Martin, Shellback, Imogen Heap, Ryan Tedder, and Ali Payami.[132] Released in October 2014, the album opened atop the Billboard 200 with 1.28 million copies sold.[133] Its singles \"Shake It Off\", \"Blank Space\", and \"Bad Blood\" reached number one in Australia, Canada, and the US, with the first two making Swift the first woman to replace herself at the Hot 100 top spot.[134] Other singles include \"Style\", \"Wildest Dreams\", \"Out of the Woods\", and \"New Romantics\".[135] The 1989 World Tour (2015) was the highest-grossing tour of the year with $250 million in total revenue.[136] After publishing an op-ed in The Wall Street Journal stressing the importance of albums as a creative medium for artists,[137] in November 2014, Swift removed her catalog from ad-supported, free music streaming platforms such as Spotify.[138] In a June 2015 open letter, Swift criticized Apple Music for not offering royalties to artists during its free three-month trial period and threatened to withdraw her music from the platform,[139] which prompted Apple Inc. to announce that it would pay artists during the free trial period.[140] Swift then agreed to keep 1989 and her catalog on Apple Music.[141] Big Machine Records returned Swift's catalog to Spotify among other free streaming platforms in June 2017.[142] Swift was named Billboard's Woman of the Year in 2014, becoming the first artist to win the award twice.[143] At the 2014 American Music Awards, Swift received the inaugural Dick Clark Award for Excellence.[144] On her 25th birthday in 2014, the Grammy Museum at L.A. Live opened an exhibit in her honor in Los Angeles that ran until October 4, 2015.[145][146] In 2015, Swift won the Brit Award for International Female Solo Artist.[147] \"Bad Blood\" won Video of the Year and Best Collaboration at the 2015 MTV Video Music Awards.[148] At the 58th Grammy Awards (2016), 1989 won Album of the Year and Best Pop Vocal Album, making Swift the first woman to win Album of the Year twice.[149] Swift dated the DJ Calvin Harris from March 2015 to June 2016.[150] They co-wrote the song \"This Is What You Came For\", featuring vocals from Rihanna; Swift was initially credited under the pseudonym Nils Sjöberg.[151] She recorded \"I Don't Wanna Live Forever\" with Zayn Malik for the soundtrack to Fifty Shades Darker (2017)[152] and won a Country Music Association Award for Song of the Year with \"Better Man\", which she wrote for the band Little Big Town.[153] In April 2016, Kanye West released the single \"Famous\", in which he references Swift in the line, \"I made that bitch famous.\" Swift criticized West and said she never consented to the lyric, but West claimed that he had received her approval and his then-wife Kim Kardashian released video clips of Swift and West discussing the song amicably over the phone. The controversy made Swift a subject of an online \"cancel\" movement.[154] In late 2016, after briefly dating Tom Hiddleston, Swift began a six-year relationship with Joe Alwyn and retreated herself from the public spotlight.[155][156] In August 2017, Swift successfully countersued David Mueller, a former radio jockey for KYGO-FM, who sued her for damages from loss of employment. Four years earlier, she informed Mueller's bosses that he had sexually assaulted her by groping her at an event.[157] The public controversies influenced Swift's sixth studio album, Reputation, which explored the impact of her fame and musically incorporated electropop with urban styles of hip hop and R&B.[158] Released in November 2017,[159] Reputation opened atop the Billboard 200 with 1.21 million US sales[160] and topped the charts in the UK, Australia, and Canada.[161] The album's lead single, \"Look What You Made Me Do\", was Swift's first UK number-one single[162] and topped charts in Australia, Ireland, New Zealand, and the US.[163] Its singles \"...Ready for It?\", \"End Game\", and \"Delicate\" were released to pop radio.[164] Reputation was nominated for a Grammy Award for Best Pop Vocal Album.[165] Swift featured on the country duo Sugarland's \"Babe\" (2018).[166] At the 2018 American Music Awards, Swift won four awards, which made her accumulate 23 trophies in total and become the AMAs' most awarded female musician, surpassing Whitney Houston.[167] The same year, she embarked on her Reputation Stadium Tour,[168] which became the highest-grossing North American concert tour in history and grossed $345.7 million worldwide.[169] In November 2018, Swift signed a new deal with Universal Music Group, which promoted her subsequent albums under Republic Records' imprint.[170] The contract included a provision for Swift to maintain ownership of her masters. In addition, in the event that Universal sold any part of its stake in Spotify, it agreed to distribute a non-recoupable portion of the proceeds among its artists.[171][172] Swift's first album with Republic Records, Lover, was released in August 2019.[173] She produced the album with Antonoff, Louis Bell, Frank Dukes, and Joel Little.[174] Lover peaked atop the charts of such territories as Australia, Canada, Ireland, Mexico, Norway, Sweden, the UK, and the US.[175] The album spawned five singles: \"Me!\", \"You Need to Calm Down\", \"Lover\", \"The Man\", and \"Cruel Summer\"; the first two singles peaked at number two on the Billboard Hot 100, and the lattermost single became a resurgent success in 2023, reaching number one.[176] Lover was 2019's best selling album in the US and best selling album by a solo artist worldwide.[177] The album and its singles earned three nominations at the 62nd Annual Grammy Awards in 2020.[178] At the 2019 MTV Video Music Awards, Swift won three awards including Video of the Year for \"You Need to Calm Down\", becoming the first female and second artist overall to win the category for a self-directed video.[179] While promoting Lover in 2019, Swift became embroiled in a public dispute with the talent manager Scooter Braun after he purchased Big Machine Records, including the masters of her albums that the label had released.[180] Swift said she had been trying to buy the masters, but Big Machine would only allow her to do so if she exchanged one new album for each older one under a new contract, which she refused to sign.[180] In November 2020, Swift began re-recording her back catalog, which enabled her to own the new masters and the licensing of her songs for commercial use, substituting for the Big Machine-owned masters.[181] In February 2020, Swift signed a global publishing deal with Universal Music Publishing Group after her 16-year contract with Sony/ATV expired.[182] Amidst the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, Swift surprise-released two \"sister albums\" that she recorded and produced with Antonoff and Aaron Dessner: Folklore in July and Evermore in December.[183] Joe Alwyn co-wrote and co-produced a few songs under the pseudonym William Bowery.[184] Both albums incorporated a muted indie folk and alternative rock production;[185] each was supported by three singles catering to US pop, country, and triple A radio formats. The singles were \"Cardigan\", \"Betty\", and \"Exile\" from Folklore, and \"Willow\", \"No Body, No Crime\", and \"Coney Island\" from Evermore.[186] Folklore was the bestselling album of 2020 in the US[187] and, together with \"Cardigan\", made Swift the first artist to debut a US number-one album and a number-one song in the same week; she achieved the feat again with Evermore and \"Willow\".[188] According to Billboard, Swift was the highest-paid musician in the US and highest-paid solo musician worldwide of 2020.[189] Folklore made Swift the first woman to win the Grammy Award for Album of the Year three times, winning the category at the 63rd Annual Grammy Awards (2021).[190] At the American Music Awards, Swift won three awards including Artist of the Year for a third record time (2020)[191] and Favorite Pop/Rock Female Artist and Favorite Pop/Rock Album (2021).[192] Swift played Bombalurina in the film adaptation of Andrew Lloyd Webber's musical Cats (2019), for which she co-wrote and recorded the Golden Globe-nominated original song \"Beautiful Ghosts\".[193][194] The documentary Miss Americana, which chronicled parts of Swift's life and career, premiered at the 2020 Sundance Film Festival.[195] Swift's re-recordings of her first six studio albums began with Fearless (Taylor's Version) and Red (Taylor's Version), which were released in April and November 2021. Both peaked atop the Billboard 200, and the former was the first re-recorded album to do so.[196] Fearless (Taylor's Version) was preceded by \"Love Story (Taylor's Version)\", which made Swift the second artist after Dolly Parton to have both the original and re-recorded versions of a song reach number one on Hot Country Songs.[197] Red (Taylor's Version) was supported by \"All Too Well (10 Minute Version)\", which became the longest song in history to top the Hot 100.[198] Swift's tenth studio album, Midnights, was released in October 2022.[199] The album incorporates a restrained electropop[200] and synth-pop sound[201] with elements of hip hop, R&B, and electronica.[199][202] In the US, Midnights was her fifth to open atop the Billboard 200 with first-week sales of over one million copies, and its tracks, led by the single \"Anti-Hero\", made Swift the first artist to monopolize the top 10 of the Hot 100.[203] Globally, the album broke the record for the most single-day streams and most single-week streams on Spotify and peaked atop the charts of at least 14 countries.[204] The album's two further singles, \"Lavender Haze\" and \"Karma\", both peaked at number two on the Billboard Hot 100.[205] According to Billboard, Swift was the top-earning solo artist in the US and the top-earning musician worldwide of 2021.[206][207] She won six American Music Awards including Artist of the Year in 2022.[208] At the MTV Video Music Awards, Swift won her third and fourth trophies for Video of the Year with All Too Well: The Short Film, her self-directed short film that accompanies \"All Too Well (10 Minute Version)\", in 2022[209] and \"Anti-Hero\" in 2023.[210] During this period, Swift won three Grammy Awards: Best Music Video for All Too Well: The Short Film[211] and Best Pop Vocal Album and Album of the Year for Midnights. Swift became the first artist to win Album of the Year four times in Grammy history.[212] Swift's next two re-recorded albums, Speak Now (Taylor's Version) and 1989 (Taylor's Version), were released in July and October 2023. The former made Swift the woman with the most number-one albums (12) in Billboard 200 history, surpassing Barbra Streisand,[213] and the latter was her sixth album to sell one million copies in a single week in the US, claiming her career's largest album sales week.[214] 1989 (Taylor's Version)'s single \"Is It Over Now?\" peaked at number one on the Billboard Hot 100.[215] Swift featured on Big Red Machine's \"Renegade\" and \"Birch\" (2021),[216] Haim's \"Gasoline\" (2021),[217] Ed Sheeran's \"The Joker and the Queen\" (2022),[218] and the National's \"The Alcott\" (2023).[219] For the soundtrack of Where the Crawdads Sing (2022), she wrote and recorded \"Carolina\", which received nominations for Best Original Song at the Golden Globes and Best Song Written for Visual Media at the Grammy Awards.[220] In 2023, Swift was the most streamed artist on Spotify,[221] Apple Music,[222] and Amazon Music;[223] and the first act to place number one on the year-end Billboard top artists list in three different decades (2009, 2015 and 2023).[224] She had five out of the 10 best-selling albums of 2023 in the US, a record since Luminate began tracking US music sales in 1991.[225] Besides music, Swift had a supporting role in the period comedy film Amsterdam (2022)[226] and began writing an original script for her directorial feature film debut with Searchlight Pictures.[227] In March 2023, Swift embarked on the Eras Tour, a retrospective tour covering all her studio albums. Media outlets extensively covered the tour's global cultural and economic impact,[228] and its US leg broke the record for the most tickets sold in a day.[203] Ticketmaster received public and political criticisms for mishandling the tour's ticket sales.[229] The Eras Tour became the highest-grossing tour in history.[230][231] Its concert film, released to theaters worldwide on October 13, 2023, grossed over $250 million to become the highest-grossing concert film and was nominated for the Golden Globe Award for Cinematic and Box Office Achievement.[232][233] Swift's eleventh studio album, The Tortured Poets Department, was released on April 19, 2024.[234] Topping charts globally, the album broke a string of records: it marked the first album ever to amass 1 billion Spotify streams in a week; sold 2.6 million units in its first week in the US; made Swift the first artist to monopolize the top 14 of the Billboard Hot 100 and the top 10 of Australia's ARIA Singles Chart; and went on to spend 16 weeks atop the Billboard 200—Swift's longest-running number-one album on the chart. The lead single, \"Fortnight,\" featuring Post Malone, became Swift's 12th number one song on the Hot 100.[235][236][237] After the pandemic, Swift's music releases, touring, and related activities culminated in an unprecedented height of popularity.[238] From 2023 onward, Swift found ubiquitous success, albeit more dominant than before, with the successes of the re-recordings, the Eras Tour, its concert film, Midnights, and The Tortured Poets Department, significantly increasing her net worth; Music Business Worldwide remarked this as a \"new stratosphere of global career success\" for Swift.[239][240] In 2023, she began dating the American football player Travis Kelce,[241] and in 2024, won Artist of the Year at the 2024 iHeartRadio Music Awards.[242] The same year, AI-generated fake pornographic images portraying Swift were posted to Twitter and spread to other social media platforms, spurring criticism and demands for legal reform.[243] In July, Swift and Kelce received death threats from a stalker in Gelsenkirchen, Germany,[244] and three children were killed in a stabbing attack at a Swift-themed workshop in Southport, England, leading to civil unrest in the UK.[245] In August, all three of the Eras Tour concerts in Vienna were canceled following the arrest of two suspects for allegedly planning an Islamic State-inspired terrorist attack in the city. The plan was uncovered by US Intelligence and was thwarted by Austrian police forces.[246] Swift's early musical influences were 1990s female country musicians such as Shania Twain, Faith Hill, LeAnn Rimes, and the Dixie Chicks,[247] and Keith Urban's country crossover sounds incorporating rock, pop, and blues.[248] She self-identified as a country musician and achieved prominence as a country pop singer with her first four studio albums, from Taylor Swift to Red.[249] The albums feature country signifiers such as banjo, six-string banjo, mandolin, fiddle, and a slight vocal twang, in addition to pop melodies and rock influences;[250][251] Speak Now draws on rock styles such as pop rock, pop-punk, and 1980s arena rock.[95][252] Critics argued that country was an indicator of Swift's narrative songwriting rather than musical direction[253][254] and accused her of causing mainstream country music to stray from its roots.[255][256] After the critical debate around Red's eclectic pop, rock, and electronic styles, Swift chose 1980s synth-pop as a defining sound of her recalibrated pop artistry and image, inspired by the music of Phil Collins, Annie Lennox, Peter Gabriel, and Madonna.[257][258] 1989, the first album in this direction, incorporates electronic arrangements consisting of dense synthesizers and drum machines.[259] Swift expanded on the electronic production on her next albums;[260] Reputation consists of hip hop, R&B, and EDM influences;[158][261] and Lover features eclectic elements from country, pop-punk, and folk rock.[262] When Swift embraced a pop identity, rockist critics regarded her move as an erosion of her country music songwriting authenticity,[263] but others regarded it as necessary for Swift's artistic evolution and defended her as a pioneer of poptimism.[264][265] Her 2020 albums Folklore and Evermore explore alternative and indie styles of rock and folk, and both incorporate a subtle, stripped-back soundscape with orchestration, synthesizers, and drum pads.[266][267] The latter experiments with varied song structures, asymmetric time signatures, and diverse instruments.[268][269] Critics deemed the indie styles a mature representation of Swift's artistry as a singer-songwriter.[267] Midnights and The Tortured Poets Department both incorporate a minimalist, subdued synth-pop sound, making use of analog synthesizers, sustained bass notes, and simple drum machine patterns.[270][271] With continuous musical reinventions,[272] Swift was described by Time and the BBC as a musical \"chameleon\".[273][274] Jody Rosen commented that by originating her career in Nashville, Swift made a \"bait-and-switch maneuver, planting roots in loamy country soil, then pivoting to pop\".[275] Clash wrote that she has the versatility to \"no longer [...] be defined by any genre or sound label\".[276] According to Ann Powers, Swift's sound is genre-agnostic, blending and \"reconfiguring\" elements of country, R&B, indie pop, and hip hop.[277][278] Swift possesses a mezzo-soprano vocal range[283] and a generally soft and breathy timbre that Rolling Stone deemed versatile.[284][285] Reviews of Swift's early country albums criticized her vocals as weak and strained compared to those of other female country singers.[286] Despite the criticism, most reviewers appreciated that Swift refrained from correcting her pitch with Auto-Tune and how she prioritized \"intimacy over power and nuance\" to communicate the messages of her songs with her audience[287]—a style that has been described as conversational.[288][289] According to Powers, Swift's defining vocal feature was her attention to detail to convey an exact feeling—\"the line that slides down like a contented sigh or up like a raised eyebrow\".[290] On Red and 1989, Swift's vocals are electronically processed to accompany the pop production.[291][288] Her voice on Reputation and Midnights incorporates hip-hop and R&B influences that result in a near-rap delivery which emphasizes rhythm and cadence over melody.[292][277] She uses her lower register vocals extensively in \"Cardigan\"[293] and both her lower and upper registers in Evermore; the musicologist Alyssa Barca described her timbre in the upper register as \"breathy and bright\" and the lower register as \"full and dark\".[269] Reviews in The New York Times, Variety and The Atlantic were more appreciative of Swift's vocals in her later albums.[251][294][295][296] She ranked 102nd on Rolling Stone's 2023 list of the 200 Greatest Singers of All Time: \"A decade ago, including her on this list would have been a controversial move, but recent releases like Folklore, Evermore, and Midnights officially settled the argument.\"[285] Laura Snapes of The Guardian said that Swift's \"vocal directness\" enables her to express wide-ranging feelings, highlighting some trademarks such as \"yo-yoing vocal yelp\" and \"climactic, processed cri de coeur\".[297] Amanda Petrusich praised how the clarity and tone of Swift's live vocals accentuate her lyrics.[298] Swift's fascination with songwriting began in her childhood. She credited her mother with igniting confidence and early songwriting interests by helping her prepare for class presentations.[299][300] She enjoyed Disney film soundtracks and would make up lyrics once she had run out of words singing them.[301] Her lyrical influences include female country songwriters such as Patsy Cline, Loretta Lynn, Tammy Wynette, and Dolly Parton;[19][104] 1990s songwriters such as Melissa Etheridge, Sarah McLachlan, and Alanis Morissette;[302] Joni Mitchell;[303] and Fall Out Boy.[304] She listed Paul McCartney, Bruce Springsteen, Emmylou Harris, and Kris Kristofferson as career role models, citing their both evolving and consistent songwriting outputs.[28][305] Her literary influences include the authors William Shakespeare, Nathaniel Hawthorne, F. Scott Fitzgerald,[306] and the poets William Wordsworth, Robert Frost, and Emily Dickinson;[307] the last of whom was a distant cousin of Swift.[308] In The New Yorker in 2011, Swift said she identifies as a songwriter first: \"I write songs, and my voice is just a way to get those lyrics across\".[28] Her personal experiences were a common inspiration for her early songs, which helped her navigate life.[309][310] Her \"diaristic\" technique began with identifying an emotion, followed by a corresponding melody.[311][312] On her first three studio albums, love, heartbreak, and insecurities, from an adolescent perspective, were dominant themes.[95][313] She delved into the tumult of toxic relationships on Red,[314] and embraced nostalgia and post-romance positivity on 1989.[257] Reputation was inspired by the downsides of Swift's fame,[315] and Lover detailed her realization of the \"full spectrum of love\".[316] Other themes in Swift's music include family dynamics, friendship,[317][318] alienation, self-awareness, and tackling vitriol, especially sexism.[300][319] She often references or draws inspiration from historical events and figures.[320] Swift's confessional lyrics received positive reviews from critics,[321][28][322] who highlighted their vivid details and emotional engagement, which they found uncommon in pop music,[323][324][325] although some perceived her as a fragile, juvenile artist, a label she has consistently challenged.[321] Critics also praised her melodic compositions; Rolling Stone described Swift as \"a songwriting savant with an intuitive gift for verse-chorus-bridge architecture\".[326][327] NPR dubbed Swift \"a master of the vernacular in her lyrics\",[158] remarking that her songs offer emotional engagement because \"the wit and clarity of her arrangements turn them from standard fare to heartfelt disclosures\".[327] Despite the positive reception, The New Yorker stated she was generally portrayed \"more as a skilled technician than as a Dylanesque visionary\".[28] Tabloid media often speculated and linked the subjects of her songs with her ex-lovers, a practice reviewers and Swift herself criticized as sexist.[328][329][330] Aside from clues in album liner notes, Swift avoided talking about the subjects of her songs.[331] On her 2020 albums Folklore and Evermore, Swift was inspired by escapism and romanticism to explore fictional narratives.[332] She imposed emotions onto imagined characters and story arcs, which liberated her from tabloid attention and suggested new paths for her artistry.[311] Swift explained that she welcomed the new songwriting direction after she stopped worrying about commercial success.[332] According to Spin, she explored complex emotions with \"precision and devastation\" on Evermore.[333] Consequence stated her 2020 albums convinced skeptics of her songwriting prowess, noting her transformation from \"teenage wunderkind to a confident and careful adult\".[334] Swift divides her writing into three types: \"quill lyrics\", songs rooted in antiquated poeticism; \"fountain pen lyrics\", based on modern and vivid storylines; and \"glitter gel pen lyrics\", which are lively and frivolous.[335] Fans noticed that the fifth track of every Swift album was the most emotionally vulnerable of the album.[336] Awarding her with the Songwriter Icon Award in 2021, the National Music Publishers' Association remarked that \"no one is more influential when it comes to writing music today\".[337] The Week deemed her the foremost female songwriter of modern times,[338] and the Nashville Songwriters Association International named her Songwriter-Artist of the Decade in 2022.[203] Swift has also published two original poems: \"Why She Disappeared\" and \"If You're Anything Like Me\".[339] Critics have analyzed the distinctive qualities and thematic depth in Swift's songwriting. Critic Kitty Empire opined in 2024 that Swift is \"a profoundly old-fashioned artist\", whose songs \"tell a story, in succinct, emotive ways that often scan meticulously\" unlike most pop music of the time; Empire attributed it to Swift's country beginnings.[340] Swift's bridges are often noted as one of the best aspects of her songs,[341][334] earning her the title \"Queen of Bridges\" from Time.[342] Mojo dubbed her \"a sharp narrator with a gift for the extended metaphor\".[343] Academics have variably described her as a poet laureate,[344] philosopher,[345] and bard.[346] Swift commands large audiences on stage,[347][348][349] captivating them through emotional storytelling and vocal delivery rather than relying on elaborate choreography.[350] According to V magazine's Greg Krelenstein, she possesses \"a rare gift of turning a stadium spectacle into an intimate setting\", irrespective of whether she is \"plucking a guitar or leading an army of dancers\".[351] In a 2008 review of Swift's early performances, Sasha Frere-Jones of The New Yorker called Swift a \"preternaturally skilled\" entertainer with a vibrant stage presence, adding \"she returned the crowd's energy with the professionalism she has shown since the age of fourteen.\"[352] In 2023, Adrian Horton of The Guardian noted her \"seemingly endless stamina\" on the Eras Tour,[353] and i critic Ilana Kaplan called her showmanship \"unparalleled\".[354] Swift's concert productions have been characterized by elaborate Broadway theatricality and high technology,[355] and her performances frequently incorporate a live band, with whom she has played and toured since 2007.[356] Swift also often accompanies herself with musical instruments such as electric guitar;[357] acoustic guitar; piano;[358] and sometimes twelve-string guitar,[359][360] six-string banjo,[361] or ukulele.[362] Interacting frequently with the audience, her solo acoustic performances are considered intimate and emotionally resonant, complementing her story-based lyrics and fan connection.[298][363] Lydia Burgham of The Spinoff opined that this intimacy remains \"integral to her singer-songwriter origins\".[364][358] Chris Willman of Variety called Swift \"pop's most approachable superstar\",[365] and the 21st century's most popular performer.[366] Swift emphasizes visuals as a key creative component of her music-making process.[367] She has collaborated with different directors to produce her music videos, and over time, she has become more involved with writing and directing. She developed the concept and treatment for \"Mean\" in 2011[368] and co-directed the music video for \"Mine\" with Roman White the year before.[369] In an interview, White said that Swift \"was keenly involved in writing the treatment, casting and wardrobe. And she stayed for both the 15-hour shooting days, even when she wasn't in the scenes.\"[370] From 2014 to 2018, Swift collaborated with director Joseph Kahn on eight music videos—four each from her albums 1989 and Reputation. Kahn has praised Swift's involvement.[371] She worked with American Express for the \"Blank Space\" music video (which Kahn directed) and served as an executive producer for the interactive app AMEX Unstaged: Taylor Swift Experience, for which she won a Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Interactive Program in 2015.[372] Swift produced the music video for \"Bad Blood\" and won a Grammy Award for Best Music Video in 2016.[373] Her production company, Taylor Swift Productions, is credited with producing all of her visual media, starting with the 2018 concert documentary Reputation Stadium Tour.[374] She continued to co-direct music videos for the Lover singles \"Me!\" with Dave Meyers, and \"You Need to Calm Down\" (also serving as a co-executive producer) and \"Lover\" with Drew Kirsch,[375] but first ventured into sole direction with the video for \"The Man\" (which won her the MTV Video Music Award for Best Direction).[376] After Folklore: The Long Pond Studio Sessions, Swift debuted as a filmmaker with All Too Well: The Short Film,[203] which made her the first artist to win the Grammy Award for Best Music Video as a sole director.[377] Swift has cited Chloé Zhao, Greta Gerwig, Nora Ephron, Guillermo del Toro, John Cassavetes, and Noah Baumbach as filmmaking influences.[367] Swift's discography is a \"critically hailed songbook\", as per Time's Sam Lansky.[378] She has won 14 Grammy Awards (including four for Album of the Year—the most won by an artist),[379] an Emmy Award,[380] 40 American Music Awards (the most won by an artist),[381] 49 Billboard Music Awards (the most won by an artist),[382] 118 Guinness World Records,[383] 30 MTV Video Music Awards (including five Video of the Year wins—the most by an act),[384] 12 Country Music Association Awards (including the Pinnacle Award),[385] eight Academy of Country Music Awards,[386] and two Brit Awards.[147] As a songwriter, she has been honored by the Nashville Songwriters Association,[59][387] the Songwriters Hall of Fame, and the National Music Publishers' Association and was the youngest person on Rolling Stone's list of the 100 Greatest Songwriters of All Time in 2015.[388][389] At the 64th BMI Awards in 2016, Swift was the first woman to be honored with an award named after its recipient.[390] From available data, Swift has amassed over 50 million album sales and 150 million single sales as of 2019,[391][392][393] and 114 million units globally, including 78 billion streams as of 2021.[394][395] The International Federation of the Phonographic Industry ranked her as the Global Recording Artist of the Year for a record four times (2014, 2019, 2022, and 2023).[396] Swift has the most number-one albums in the UK and Ireland for a female artist this century,[397][398] earned the highest income for an artist on Chinese digital music platforms (CN¥ 159,000,000 as of 2021),[399] and is the first artist to occupy the entire top five[note 2] of the Australian albums chart[402][403] and the top ten of the country's singles chart.[404] Swift remains the world's highest-grossing touring act ever, with cumulative ticket sales at $3.12 billion as of December 2024, per Pollstar.[405] The Eras Tour is the highest-grossing tour of all time and the first to surpass $1 billion in revenue.[406][407] Beginning with Fearless, each of her studio albums have opened with over one million global units.[408][409] Swift is the most-streamed act on Spotify,[410] and the most-streamed female artist on Apple Music.[411] On Spotify, she is the only artist to have received more than 250 million and 350 million streams in one day (260 million on October 27, 2023, and 380 million on April 19, 2024)[412] and was the first female act to reach 100 million monthly listeners.[413][198] The most entries and the most simultaneous entries (175 and 34 songs), and most number-ones (5) for a soloist on the Billboard Global 200, are among her feats.[414][415] Swift is the first and only artist to occupy the top nine spots on the Global 200.[414] She has the most entries (154), top-ten songs (20), and number-ones (3)[note 3] among solo acts on the Global 200 Excl. US.[414] In the US, Swift has sold over 37.3 million albums as of 2019,[393] when Billboard placed her eighth on its Greatest of All Time Artists Chart.[416] Twelve of her songs have topped the Billboard Hot 100.[417] She is the longest-reigning and the first act to spend at least 100 weeks atop the Billboard Artist 100 (120 weeks);[418][419] the soloist with the most cumulative weeks atop and in the top ten of the Billboard 200 (84 and 425);[420][421] the woman with the most Billboard 200 number-ones (14),[422] Hot 100 entries (total and single-week: 264 and 32),[423] number-one debuts (7),[note 4] top-ten songs (59),[417] top-five songs (36),[198] Streaming Songs chart-toppers (9),[417] and weeks atop the Top Country Albums chart (101);[425] and the act with the most number-one songs on Pop Airplay (13)[426] and Digital Songs (29).[417] Swift is the first woman to simultaneously chart five albums in the top 10 and eleven albums on the entire Billboard 200;[427][428] and the first act to occupy the top four spots and chart seven albums[note 5] in the top 10 on the Top Album Sales chart.[430][431] She is the second highest-certified female digital singles artist (and fifth overall) in the US, with 137.5 million total units certified by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA),[432] and the first woman to have both an album (Fearless) and a song (\"Shake It Off\") certified Diamond.[433] Swift is the only artist in Luminate history to have seven albums sell over a million copies in a week.[434] Swift has appeared in various power listings. Time included her on its annual list of the 100 most influential people in 2010, 2015, and 2019.[435] She was one of the \"Silence Breakers\" that the magazine spotlighted as Person of the Year in 2017 for speaking up about sexual assault,[436] and she received the honor again in 2023 for her cultural domination that year.[378] Time described Swift as the first Person of the Year to be recognized for \"achievement in the arts\", as well as the first woman to be recognized and appear on a Person of the Year cover more than once.[437][378] In 2014, she was named to Forbes' 30 Under 30 list in the music category[438] and again in 2017 in its \"All-Star Alumni\" category.[439] Swift became the youngest woman to be included on Forbes' list of the 100 most powerful women in 2015, ranked at number 64.[440] In 2023, she was ranked by Forbes as the fifth-most powerful woman in the world, the first entertainer to place in the top five.[441] Swift received an honorary Doctor of Fine Arts degree from New York University and served as its commencement speaker on May 18, 2022.[203] In 2024, Billboard ranked her at number 2 on its \"Greatest Pop Stars of the 21st Century\" list.[442] Swift has been credited with making a profound impact on the music industry, popular culture, and the economy.[443][444] She dominates cultural conversations,[445][446] leading some publications to describe her as a cultural \"vitality\" or zeitgeist.[447][448][449] Her music, life, and public image are points of attention in global celebrity culture.[272] Initially a teen idol,[450] she has been referred to as a pop icon;[260][451] publications describe her enormous popularity and longevity as unwitnessed since the 20th century.[452][453] In 2013, New York magazine's Jody Rosen dubbed Swift the \"world's biggest pop star\" and opined that the trajectory of her stardom has defied established patterns. Rosen added that Swift \"falls between genres, eras, demographics, paradigms, trends\", leaving her contemporaries \"vying for second place\".[275] Critics regard Swift as a rare yet successful combination of the pop star and singer-songwriter archetypes.[454] Swift's fans are known as Swifties.[229] Billboard noted that only a few artists have achieved her level of chart success, critical acclaim, and fan support.[455] Swift's million-selling albums are considered an anomaly in the streaming-dominated industry following the end of the album era in the 2010s.[456][457] Economist Alan Krueger described Swift as an \"economic genius\".[458] Although labeled by the media in her early career as \"America's Sweetheart\" for her girl next door persona,[459][460] Swift has been called by detractors \"calculated\" and manipulative of her image, a narrative bolstered by her 2016 dispute with West.[461][462] Critics have also noted that her personal life and career have been subject to intense misogyny and \"slut-shaming\",[463][464] as well as rampant media scrutiny and tabloid speculation.[465] Swift has also been a victim of numerous house break-ins and stalkers, some of whom were armed.[466][467] Swift's private jet use has drawn scrutiny for its carbon emissions.[468][469] In 2023, a spokesperson for Swift stated that she had purchased more than double the required carbon credits to offset all tour travel and personal flights.[470][471] In December 2023, Swift's lawyers sent a cease and desist letter to American programmer Jack Sweeney over tracking her private jet, alleging stalking and safety risks; media outlets have reported that the information posted by Sweeney is a synthesis of publicly available data.[472][473] In February 2024, it was reported that Swift had sold one of her two private jets.[474] \"You have different artists dominating different sectors of the industry: Some are huge at streaming, some are big draws on the road. But we're at this moment where there's no one better than Taylor Swift, whether that's on the radio, with streaming, ticket sales or just cultural impact.\" Swift helped shape the modern country music scene,[476] having extended her success beyond the Anglosphere,[275][476] pioneered the use of the internet (Myspace) as a marketing tool,[27][47] and introduced the genre to a younger generation.[477][275] Country labels have since become interested in signing young singers who write their own music;[478] her guitar performances contributed to the \"Taylor Swift factor\": a phenomenon to which an upsurge in guitar sales to women, a previously ignored demographic, is attributed.[479][480] According to Pitchfork, Swift changed the music landscape with her genre transitions, a discography that accommodates cultural shifts,[481] and Billboard notes her ability to popularize any sound in mainstream music.[482] Lyrically, in being personal and vulnerable in her songs, music journalist Nick Catucci opined Swift helped make space for later singers like Billie Eilish, Ariana Grande, and Halsey to do the same.[483] Scholars have highlighted the literary sensibility and poptimist implications of Swift.[484][485] She has been credited with legitimizing and popularizing the concept of album \"eras\".[486][487] Swift is a subject of academic study and

                "content": "Taylor Alison Swift (born December 13, 1989) is an American singer-songwriter, record producer and actress. She is known for narrative songs about her personal life, as well as songs she wrote about other famous people, including Rebekah Harkness in the song “the last great american dynasty”. She has sold more than 52 million albums, including 37 million in the US. She is one of the world's best-selling music artists. She is the highest-earning female musician of the 2010s and 2020s.[source?] Taylor Swift has won 14 Grammy Awards, an Emmy Award, and 118 Guinness World Records. She is the most-awarded act and woman at the American Music Awards (29 wins) and Billboard Music Awards (23 wins). She has had eleven number-one songs on the Billboard Hot 100. In October 2023, she became a billionaire. She won Apple Music Artist of the Year in 2020 and 2023. Taylor Alison Swift was born on December 13, 1989,[1] at Reading Hospital in West Reading, Pennsylvania, [2]the daughter of Scott Swift and Andrea Gardner.[3] She is named after singer-songwriter James Taylor.[4]She has a younger brother, actor Austin Swift.[5] Swift was raised in Wyomissing, Pennsylvania on a Christmas tree farm.[6] She became interested in musical theater when she was nine. Later, she became interested in country music. On weekends, she performed music at local events. She moved to Hendersonville, Tennessee, near Nashville, when she was 14.[7] Her family moved there to help Swift's career in country music. In Nashville, she went to Hendersonville High School for two years. After that, she went to Aaron Academy, because Aaron Academy made it easier for her to tour while in school. She graduated high school one year early. Additionally, at the age of 10, Swift won a poetry writing competition.[8] She released her first single, \"Tim McGraw\", in 2006 at the age of 16. That same year she released her first album, Taylor Swift. The album reached number 5 on the Billboard albums chart, and sold one million copies by November 2007. She won Country Music Television's (CMT) \"Breakthrough Video of the Year\" award in 2007 for \"Tim McGraw\". She was also nominated by the Academy of Country Music for \"Top New Female Vocalist\". Swift’s second studio album, Fearless, was released in 2008. On September 10, 2009 it reached Platinum, selling 1 million copies. On October 25, 2010 she released her third album, Speak Now. The lead single from Swift's fourth album, Red, \"We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together\", became her first number-one song on the US Billboard Hot 100. The single \"I Knew You Were Trouble\" reached number two on the chart. It was also her first chart-topper on Billboard's Mainstream Top 40/Pop Songs chart. In 2012 Swift voiced the character Audrey in the movie The Lorax. Swift performed \"Shake It Off\", the lead single from her fifth album, 1989, at the 2014 MTV VMAs.[9] 1989 was released on October 27, 2014. \"Shake It Off\", along with the singles \"Blank Space\", and \"Bad Blood\", all reached number one on the Billboard Hot 100. These singles, along with \"Style\" and \"Wildest Dreams\", have also topped the Mainstream Top 40/Pop Songs chart. 1989 was based off of Taylors birthday year, 1989. In 2016 she featured on the single, \"I Don't Wanna Live Forever\" with English singer Zayn Malik (former member of One Direction). It was released as a single for the soundtrack of the film Fifty Shades Darker (2017). It reached number two on the Hot 100 in the US and Canada. On June 8, 2017, Swift restored her music on streaming sites such as Spotify and Apple Music after previously removing it from being streamed. On August 25, 2017, Swift released the single \"Look What You Made Me Do\", which topped the Billboard Hot 100 and broke YouTube's streaming record after getting 43 million views within 24 hours. It also became her first UK chart-topper. Swift announced that her sixth studio album, Reputation, would be released on November 10, 2017. The album included singles such as \"...Ready for It?\" and \"End Game\" featuring American rapper Future and English singer Ed Sheeran. During this era, she met backstage with global superstar Oliver Kang[source?] On April 26, 2019, Swift released the single \"ME!\" featuring Brendon Urie as the lead single from her seventh studio album, Lover. On June 14, 2019, Swift released Lover’s second single \"You Need to Calm Down\". Both of these songs reached number two on the US Hot 100. On August 16, Swift released \"Lover\" as the third single from Lover. She released a duet version of Lover with Canadian recording artist Shawn Mendes. In August 2020, Swift revealed that she was releasing a surprise album called folklore, after it was announced her Loverfest stadium tour was canceled due to the coronavirus pandemic. Its lead single, \"cardigan\", entered at number one on the US Hot 100, becoming her sixth US number-one single. folklore became her seventh US number-one album. She became the first artist to enter at number one on both the Hot 100 singles chart and Billboard 200 album chart in the same week.[10] On December 11, 2020, Swift released her ninth studio album, evermore. It is meant to be a \"sister\" album to folklore.[11] Due to Swift not being able to own her own masters, she has begun re-recording all of her old albums. She released the first song from the re-recording of Fearless (Taylor's Version), \"Love Story\" on February 12, 2021. On November 12, 2021 she released Red (Taylor's Version). Swift's 10th studio album Midnights came out on October 21, 2022. In March 2023 Swift started her Eras Tour. The tour covers all her albums. The US part of the tour sold the most tickets in one day ever. Many people said that the company handling the ticket sales, Ticketmaster, did not do well.[12] The Eras Tour earned the most money of any tour in history. It earned over $1 billion.[13][14] During this time, she also released Speak Now (Taylor's Version) and 1989 (Taylor's Version). On February 4, 2024, Swift won Album of the Year at the 66th Grammy Awards. She was the first artist to win in this category four times. She announced a new album, The Tortured Poets Department, due for release on April 19.[15]",

Today she's the most recognizable country-- or formerly country? or pop?-- artist in North America, if not the world: her songwriting takes in half a dozen genres, and her economic impact changes cities. We will move through Swift's own catalogue, including hits, deep cuts, outtakes, re-recordings, considering songwriting as its own art, distinct from poems recited or silently read. We will learn how to study fan culture, celebrity culture, adolescence, adulthood and appropriation; how to think about white texts, Southern texts, transatlantic texts, and queer subtexts. We will learn how to think about illicit affairs, and hoaxes, champagne problems and incomplete closure. We will look at her precursors, from Dolly Parton to the Border Ballads, and at work about her (such as the documentary \"Miss Americana\"). And we will read literary works important to her and works about song and performance, with novels, memoirs and poems by (among others) Willa Cather, James Weldon Johnson, Tracey Thorn, and William Wordsworth.

                "title": "Nancy Pelosi - Wikipedia",
                "content": "Nancy Patricia Pelosi (/pəˈloʊsi/ pə-LOH-see; née D'Alesandro; born March 26, 1940) is an American politician who served as the 52nd speaker of the United States House of Representatives from 2007 to 2011 and again from 2019 to 2023. A member of the Democratic Party, she was the first woman elected as U.S. House Speaker and the first woman to lead a major political party in either chamber of Congress, leading the House Democrats from 2003 to 2023. A member of the House since 1987, Pelosi currently represents California's 11th congressional district, which includes most of San Francisco. She is the dean of California's congressional delegation. Pelosi was born and raised in Baltimore, and is the daughter of mayor and congressman Thomas D'Alesandro Jr. She graduated from Trinity College, Washington, in 1962 and married businessman Paul Pelosi the next year; the two had met while both were students. They moved to New York City before settling down in San Francisco with their children. Focused on raising her family, Pelosi stepped into politics as a volunteer for the Democratic Party in the 1960s. After years of party work, rising to chair the state party, she was first elected to Congress in a 1987 special election and is now in her 19th term. Pelosi steadily rose through the ranks of the House Democratic Caucus to be elected House minority whip in 2001[1] and elevated to House minority leader a year later,[2] becoming the first woman to hold each of those positions in either chamber of Congress. In the 2006 midterm elections, Pelosi led the Democrats to a majority in the House for the first time in 12 years and was subsequently elected Speaker, becoming the first woman to hold the office.[3] Until Kamala Harris became vice president in 2021, Pelosi was the highest-ranking woman in the presidential line of succession in U.S. history, as the speaker of the House is second in the line of succession. During her first speakership, Pelosi was a major opponent of the Iraq War as well as the Bush administration's attempts to partially privatize Social Security. She participated in the passage of the Obama administration's landmark bills, including the Affordable Care Act, the Dodd–Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, the Don't Ask, Don't Tell Repeal Act, the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, and the 2010 Tax Relief Act. Pelosi lost the speakership after the Republican Party retook the majority in the 2010 midterm elections, but she retained her role as leader of the House Democrats and became House minority leader for a second time. In the 2018 midterm elections, Democrats regained majority control of the House, and Pelosi was again elected Speaker, becoming the first former speaker to reclaim the gavel since Sam Rayburn in 1955. During her second speakership, the House twice impeached President Donald Trump, first in December 2019 and again in January 2021; the Senate acquitted Trump both times. She participated in the passage of the Biden administration's landmark bills, including the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021, the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, the CHIPS and Science Act, the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022, and the Respect for Marriage Act. In the 2022 midterm elections, Republicans narrowly regained control of the House for the new Congress, ending her tenure as speaker. She subsequently retired as House Democratic leader. On November 29, 2022, the Steering and Policy Committee of the House Democratic Caucus named Pelosi \"Speaker Emerita\". She was reelected in 2024 to her 20th term in the House upon the convening of the 119th Congress, which begins on January 3, 2025. Nancy Pelosi was born in Baltimore, Maryland, to an Italian-American family. She was the only daughter and the youngest of six children of Annunciata M. \"Nancy\" D'Alesandro (née Lombardi)[4] and Thomas D'Alesandro Jr.[5] Her mother was born in Fornelli, Isernia, Molise, in Southern Italy, and immigrated to the U.S. in 1912;[6] her father traced his Italian ancestry to Genoa, Venice and Abruzzo.[5] When Pelosi was born, her father was a Democratic congressman from Maryland. He became Baltimore mayor seven years later.[7][5][8] Pelosi's mother was also active in politics, organizing Democratic women and teaching her daughter political skills.[9] Pelosi's brother, Thomas D'Alesandro III, also a Democrat, was elected Baltimore City Council president and later served as mayor from 1967 to 1971.[7] Pelosi helped her father at his campaign events, and she attended President John F. Kennedy's inaugural address in January 1961.[5] In 1958, Pelosi graduated from the Institute of Notre Dame, an all-girls Catholic high school in Baltimore. In 1962, she graduated from Trinity College (now Trinity Washington University) in Washington, D.C., with a Bachelor of Arts in political science.[10] Pelosi interned for Senator Daniel Brewster (D-Maryland) in the 1960s alongside future House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer.[11] After moving to San Francisco, Pelosi became friends with 5th district congressman Phillip Burton and began working her way up in Democratic politics.[12] In 1976, she was elected as a Democratic National Committee member from California, a position she would hold until 1996.[13] She was elected as party chair for Northern California in 1977, and four years later was selected to head the California Democratic Party, which she led until 1983. Subsequently, Pelosi served as the San Francisco Democratic National Convention Host Committee chairwoman in 1984, and then as Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee finance chair from 1985 to 1986.[14] Phillip Burton died in 1983 and his wife, Sala Burton, won a special election to fill the remainder of her husband's congressional term. She was then reelected to two more terms in her own right. Burton became ill with cancer in late 1986 and decided not to run for reelection in 1988. She wanted Pelosi to succeed her, guaranteeing Pelosi the support of the Burtons' contacts.[15] Burton died on February 1, 1987, one month after being sworn in for a second full term. Pelosi won the special election to succeed her, defeating Democratic San Francisco supervisor Harry Britt on April 7, 1987, and Republican Harriet Ross in a June 2 runoff. Pelosi took office a week later.[16][17] In the primary, Britt, a gay man, had courted San Francisco's sizable homosexual population by arguing that he would be better than Pelosi at addressing the HIV/AIDS epidemic.[18] Pelosi had held many campaign events, amassed a large number of campaign volunteers, and fundraised prolifically for her campaign.[19] Pelosi has continued to represent approximately the same area of San Francisco for her entire congressional career, despite the boundaries shifting marginally in decennial post-reapportionment redistrictings. This area has been represented in the House by Democrats uninterruptedly since 1949, and is strongly Democratic-leaning (as of 2006, 13% of registered voters in the boundaries of Pelosi's district were Republican). It has not seen a serious Republican congressional contender since the early 1960s.[20] Pelosi has been reelected to the House 18 times[21] without any substantive opposition. Unlike in her 1987 campaign, Pelosi has not participated in candidates' debates in her reelection campaigns. In her first seven reelection campaigns (from 1988 through 2004), she won an average of 80% of the vote.[20] At the time that Pelosi entered office, there were only 23 women in the House.[22] When Pelosi entered office, the AIDS epidemic was at a dire point.[23] San Francisco was greatly affected; its large population of gay men was the epidemic's initial epicenter.[24] Beginning in her first term, Pelosi became a prominent congressional advocate on behalf of those impacted by HIV/AIDS.[23] Shortly after she took office, she hired a gay man as her congressional office's director of AIDS policy. In her first floor speech, Pelosi promised that she would be an advocate in the fight against what she called \"the crisis of AIDS.\" With great stigma around the subject, some in her party privately chastised her for publicly associating herself with it.[18] Pelosi co-authored the Ryan White CARE Act, which allocated funding dedicated to providing treatment and services for those impacted by HIV/AIDS.[23] President George H. W. Bush signed the bill into law in December 1990.[25] In March 1988, Pelosi voted for the Civil Rights Restoration Act of 1987 (as well as to override President Ronald Reagan's veto).[26][27][28] Pelosi helped shape the Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act, working with California Senator Dianne Feinstein and New York Congressman Chuck Schumer. It became law in 1994.[19] Pelosi also held chairs on important committees, such as the House Appropriations Committee and the House Intelligence Committee.[19] In 2001, Pelosi was elected the House minority whip, second-in-command to Minority Leader Dick Gephardt. She was the first woman in U.S. history to hold that post.[29] Pelosi defeated John Lewis and Steny Hoyer for the position. A strong fundraiser, she used campaign contributions to help persuade other members of Congress to support her candidacy.[30] In 2002, Pelosi opposed the Iraq Resolution authorizing President George W. Bush to use military force against Iraq, which passed the House on a 296–133 vote.[31][32] She said, \"unilateral use of force without first exhausting every diplomatic remedy and other remedies and making a case to the American people will be harmful to our war on terrorism.\"[33] In November 2002, after Gephardt resigned as House minority leader to seek the Democratic nomination in the 2004 presidential election, Pelosi was elected to replace him, becoming the first woman to lead a major party in either chamber of Congress.[34] In the campaign to succeed Gephardt as the House Democratic Caucus's leader, Pelosi was challenged by Harold Ford Jr. and Marcy Kaptur. Kaptur withdrew her candidacy for the position before the November 15, 2002, caucus vote, and Pelosi defeated Ford 117–29 in the closed-door vote of caucus members.[35] Critics of Pelosi characterized her as too liberal to be a successful House leader.[36][37] As minority leader, Pelosi sharply criticized the handling of the Iraq War by President Bush and his administration, in 2004 saying Bush had demonstrated areas of \"incompetence\".[38] In a relative surprise, the Democratic Party lost three seats in the 2004 House elections, which coincided with Bush's reelection as president.[39] Focused on retaking the House majority in 2006, in her second term as minority leader Pelosi worked to criticize the Bush administration more effectively and to contrast the Democratic Party with it.[39][40] As part of this, Pelosi voiced even harsher criticism of Bush's handling of the Iraq War.[40] In November 2005, prominent congressional Democrat John Murtha proposed that the U.S. begin a withdrawal of troops from Iraq at the \"earliest predictable date\". Pelosi initially declined to commit to supporting Murtha's proposal.[41] Speaker Dennis Hastert soon brought to the floor a vote on a non-binding resolution calling for an immediate withdrawal of troops, seeking to trap Democrats into taking a more radical stance. Pelosi led Democrats in voting against the resolution, which failed in a 403–3 floor vote.[42] Roughly two weeks later, Pelosi held a press conference in which she endorsed Murtha's proposal.[43] Some critics believed that Pelosi's support for a troop withdrawal would prevent the Democrats from winning a House majority in the 2006 elections.[40] During her time as minority leader, Pelosi was not well known to much of the American public. Before the 2006 elections, Republicans made a concerted effort to taint public perception of her, running advertisements assailing her.[44] Advertisements demonizing Pelosi became a routine part of Republican advertising in subsequent elections.[45] For instance, during the 2022 election cycle, Republicans ran more than $50 million in ads that negatively characterized or invoked Pelosi, and in the 2010 cycle, they spent more than $65 million on such ads.[45][46] In the 2006 elections, the Democrats took control of the House, picking up 30 seats,[47] the party's largest House seat gain since the 1974 elections held in the wake of the Watergate scandal.[40] The party's House majority meant that as the party's incumbent House leader, Pelosi was widely expected to become speaker in the next Congress.[48][49] On November 16, 2006, the Democratic caucus unanimously nominated her for speaker.[50] Pelosi supported her longtime friend John Murtha for House majority leader, the second-ranking post in the House. His competitor was House Minority Whip Steny Hoyer, who had been Pelosi's second-in-command since 2003.[51] Hoyer was elected House majority leader over Murtha by a margin of 149–86.[52] On January 4, 2007, Pelosi defeated Republican John Boehner of Ohio, 233 votes to 202, in the election for speaker of the House.[53][54][55] Rahm Emanuel, the incoming chairman of the House Democratic Caucus, nominated Pelosi, and her longtime friend John Dingell swore her in, as the dean of the House of Representatives traditionally does.[56][57] Pelosi was the first woman, the first Californian, and the first Italian-American to hold the speakership. She was also the second speaker from a state west of the Rocky Mountains. The first was Washington's Tom Foley, the last Democrat to hold the post before Pelosi. During her speech, she discussed the historical importance of being the first woman to hold the position of Speaker: This is a historic moment—for the Congress, and for the women of this country. It is a moment for which we have waited more than 200 years. Never losing faith, we waited through the many years of struggle to achieve our rights. But women weren't just waiting; women were working. Never losing faith, we worked to redeem the promise of America, that all men and women are created equal. For our daughters and granddaughters, today, we have broken the marble ceiling. For our daughters and our granddaughters, the sky is the limit, anything is possible for them.[59] She also said Iraq was the major issue facing the 110th Congress while incorporating some Democratic Party beliefs: The election of 2006 was a call to change—not merely to change the control of Congress, but for a new direction for our country. Nowhere were the American people more clear about the need for a new direction than in Iraq. The American people rejected an open-ended obligation to a war without end.[59] As speaker, Pelosi remained the leader of the House Democrats, as the speaker is considered the leader of the majority caucus. But by tradition, she did not normally participate in debate and almost never voted on the floor, though she had the right to do so as a member of the House. She was also not a member of any House committees, also in keeping with tradition. Pelosi was reelected speaker in 2009. During and after her first tenure as speaker, Pelosi was widely characterized as a polarizing political figure. Republican candidates often associated their Democratic opponents with her.[60][61] Pelosi became the focus of heavy disdain by \"mainstream\" Republicans and Tea Party Republicans alike,[62] as well as from the left.[63] As they had in 2006, Republicans continued to run advertisements that demonized Pelosi.[64] Before the 2010 House elections, the Republican National Committee prominently used a \"Fire Pelosi\" slogan in its efforts to recapture the House majority.[65][66] This slogan was rolled out hours after the House passed the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act.[67] Republicans spent $65 million ahead of the 2010 elections on anti-Pelosi advertisements.[46] Pelosi has continued to be a fixture of Republican attack.[68] Ads demonizing her have been credited with fostering intense right-wing ire toward her,[69] and have been seen as one of the top factors in her unpopularity with the public.[30] Shortly after being reelected in 2004, President Bush claimed a mandate for an ambitious second-term agenda and proposed reforming Social Security by allowing workers to redirect a portion of their Social Security withholding into stock and bond investments.[70] Pelosi strongly opposed the plan, saying there was no crisis, and as minority leader she imposed intense party discipline on her caucus, leading them to near-unanimous opposition to the proposal, which was defeated.[71] In the wake of Bush's 2004 reelection, several leading House Democrats believed they should pursue impeachment proceedings against him, asserting that he had misled Congress about weapons of mass destruction in Iraq and violated Americans' civil liberties by authorizing warrantless wiretaps. In May 2006, with an eye on the upcoming midterm elections—which offered the possibility of Democrats taking back control of the House for the first time since 1994—Pelosi told colleagues that, while the Democrats would conduct vigorous oversight of Bush administration policy, an impeachment investigation was \"off the table\". A week earlier, she had told The Washington Post that although Democrats would not set out to impeach Bush, \"you never know where\" investigations might lead.[72] After becoming speaker in 2007, Pelosi held firm against impeachment, notwithstanding strong support for it among her constituents. In the 2008 election, she withstood a challenge for her seat by antiwar activist Cindy Sheehan, who ran as an independent primarily because of Pelosi's refusal to pursue impeachment.[73] Before the midterm elections, Pelosi announced that if Democrats gained a House majority, they would push through most of their agenda during the first 100 hours of the 110th Congress.[74][75] The \"first hundred hours\" was a play on President Franklin D. Roosevelt's promise for quick action to combat the Great Depression during his \"first hundred days\" in office. Newt Gingrich, who became speaker of the House in 1995, had a similar 100-day agenda to implement his Contract with America. On January 5, 2007, reacting to suggestions from Bush's confidants that he would increase troop levels in Iraq (which he announced in a speech a few days later), Pelosi and Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid condemned the plan. They sent Bush a letter reading: [T]here is no purely military solution in Iraq. There is only a political solution. Adding more combat troops will only endanger more Americans and stretch our military to the breaking point for no strategic gain. ... Rather than deploy additional forces to Iraq, we believe the way forward is to begin the phased redeployment of our forces in the next four to six months while shifting the principal mission of our forces there from combat to training, logistics, force protection, and counter-terror.[76] Pelosi was named Permanent Chair of the 2008 Democratic National Convention in Denver, Colorado.[77] Pelosi has been credited for spearheading Obama's health care law, the Affordable Care Act,[78] when it seemed doomed to defeat. After Republican Scott Brown won Democrat Ted Kennedy's former Senate seat in the January 2010 Massachusetts special election, costing Democrats their 60-seat filibuster-proof majority, Obama agreed with his then chief of staff Rahm Emanuel's idea to do smaller initiatives that could pass easily. But Pelosi dismissed Obama's compunction, mocking his scaled-back ideas as \"kiddie care\".[79] After convincing him that this was their only shot at health care reform because of the large Democratic majorities in Congress, she rallied her caucus as she began an \"unbelievable marathon\" of a two-month session to craft the bill, which passed the House 219–212. In Obama's remarks before signing the bill into law, he called Pelosi \"one of the best speakers the House of Representatives has ever had.\"[80][81][82][83] By early 2010, analysts were assessing Pelosi as possibly the most powerful woman in U.S. history and among the most powerful speakers of the previous 100 years.[84] In March 2010, Mark Shields wrote, In the last four months, [Pelosi] has not once, not twice but on three separate occasions done what none of her predecessors—including legendary giants [Tip O'Neill and Sam Rayburn]—could ever do: persuade the House of Representatives to pass national health-care reform. Pelosi has proved herself to be the most powerful woman in U.S. political history.[85] Later in 2010, Gail Russell Chaddock of The Christian Science Monitor opined that Pelosi was the \"most powerful House speaker since Sam Rayburn a half century ago\", adding that she had also been \"one of the most partisan\".[62] Scholars favorably assessed Pelosi's first speakership. In late 2010, Norman Ornstein, a congressional scholar at the conservative-leaning American Enterprise Institute, opined that despite polarized public opinion of Pelosi, \"she's going to rank quite high in the pantheon of modern speakers\", declaring that the only speaker of the previous 100 years he would rank higher than Pelosi was Sam Rayburn. Catholic University of America political scientist Matthew Green opined that the 111th Congress had \"been remarkable in its productivity—in both the number of bills enacted and their scope—and Pelosi shares much of the credit.\"[86] Green considered Pelosi's tenure as speaker to be among the greatest in U.S. history, highlighting the passage of the Affordable Care Act (\"a measure with far-reaching implications for our nation's health care policy\"). He also praised Pelosi for occasionally allowing House passage of measures that had majority overall House support but were opposed by the majority of the Democratic House Caucus. He noted that she had occasionally allowed bills to move forward in such fashion despite a high level of political polarization in the United States.[87] In November 2010, Brian Naylor of NPR opined that: During Nancy Pelosi's four years as speaker of the House, Congress approved the health care overhaul—widely considered the most significant piece of domestic legislation since Medicare—along with an $800 billion measure to stimulate the economy and a multi-billion-dollar rescue of the banks. It is a legislative legacy that rivals the accomplishments of any speaker in modern times.[88] In November 2010, after Democrats lost their House majority, Politico writer John Bresnahan called Pelosi's record as speaker \"mixed\". He opined that Pelosi had been a powerful speaker, describing her as wielding \"an iron fist in a Gucci glove\" and having held \"enormous power within the House Democratic Caucus\", but noting that she had a \"horrible approval rating with the rest of America\". Bresnahan wrote that Pelosi's leadership and the legislative agenda she advanced had significantly contributed to the party's loss of its House majority, citing the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act as an example of legislation that hurt the Democrats electorally in 2010. Bresnahan also believed that, ahead of the 2010 elections, Pelosi had \"disastrously\" misread public opinion, and that Pelosi had been a poor orator.[89] Thomas Mann of the Brookings Institution opined in 2018 that Pelosi had been the \"strongest and most effective speaker of modern times\" during her first speakership.[90] In 2018, Robert Draper wrote for The New York Times Magazine: During Nancy Pelosi’s four years as speaker, there was no confusion as to who was in control. Pelosi used the tools at her disposal—committee assignments, campaign donations—to establish a balance among her party’s coalitions while also reminding everyone that her job was not simply to officiate and appease...But as Newt Gingrich learned the hard way two decades ago, an autocratic speaker is a short-lived one. Pelosi’s reign was successful because she understood the will of her caucus rather than bending it to hers.[30] Draper also wrote that \"for all her mastery of Washington's inside game, Pelosi has never been a deft public-facing politician,\" and called her a poor orator.[30] Though Pelosi was reelected by a comfortable margin in the 2010 elections, the Democrats lost 63 seats and control of the House of Representatives to the Republicans. After this setback, Pelosi sought to continue leading the House Democratic Caucus as minority leader, the office she held before becoming speaker. Intraparty opposition failed to pass a motion to delay the leadership vote,[91] though she faced a challenge from Representative Heath Shuler. Shuler lost to Pelosi, 150–43, in the caucus vote on November 17, 2010.[92] On the opening day of the 112th Congress, Pelosi was elected minority leader.[93] In November 2011, 60 Minutes alleged that Pelosi and several other members of Congress had used information they gleaned from closed sessions to make money on the stock market. The program cited her purchases of Visa Inc. stock while a bill that would limit credit card fees was in the House. Pelosi denied the allegations and called the report \"a right-wing smear\".[94][95][96] When the Stop Trading on Congressional Knowledge Act (or STOCK Act) was introduced the next year, she voted for it and lauded its passing. Of representatives Louise Slaughter and Tim Walz, who drafted the bill, Pelosi said they \"shined a light on a gaping hole in our ethics laws and helped close it once and for all\".[97][98] On November 14, 2012, Pelosi announced that she intended to remain Democratic leader.[99] In August 2016, Pelosi said that her personal contact information had been posted online following a cyberattack against top Democratic campaign committees and she had received \"obscene and sick calls, voice mails and text messages\". She warned members of Congress to avoid letting children or family members answer phone calls or read text messages.[100] At times, centrists, progressive candidates and incumbent Democrats all expressed opposition to Pelosi's continued tenure as the party's House leader.[101] Prompted by colleagues after the 2016 presidential election, Tim Ryan of Ohio initiated a bid to replace Pelosi as House minority leader on November 17, 2016.[102] After Pelosi agreed to give more leadership opportunities to junior members,[103] she defeated Ryan by a vote of 134–63 on November 30.[104] In 2017, after Democrats lost four consecutive special elections in the House of Representatives, Pelosi's leadership was again called into question. In June 2017, Representative Kathleen Rice of New York and a small group of other House Democrats, including Congressional Black Caucus chairman Cedric Richmond, held a closed-door meeting to discuss potential new Democratic leadership.[105] Other House Democrats, including Ryan, Seth Moulton, and Filemon Vela, publicly called for new House leadership.[106] In an interview, Rice said, \"If you were talking about a company that was posting losing numbers, if you were talking about any sports team that was losing time and time again, changes would be made, right? The CEO out. The coach would be out and there would be a new strategy put in place.\"[106] In a press conference, Pelosi defended her leadership, saying, \"I respect any opinion that my members have but my decision about how long I stay is not up to them.\"[106] When asked specifically why she should stay on as House minority leader after numerous Democratic seats were lost, she responded, \"Well, I'm a master legislator. I am a strategic, politically astute leader. My leadership is recognized by many around the country, and that is why I'm able to attract the support that I do.\"[107] In November 2017, after Pelosi called for John Conyers's resignation over allegations of harassment, she convened the first in a series of planned meetings on strategies to address reforming workplace policies in the wake of national attention to sexual harassment. She said Congress had \"a moral duty to the brave women and men coming forward to seize this moment and demonstrate real, effective leadership to foster a climate of respect and dignity in the workplace\".[108] In February 2018, Pelosi sent a letter to Speaker Paul Ryan about the proposed public release of a memo prepared by Republican staff at the direction of House Intelligence Committee Chairman Devin Nunes. The memo attacked the Federal Bureau of Investigation for its investigation of Russian interference in the 2016 United States elections. Pelosi said the FBI and the Department of Justice had warned Nunes and Ryan that the memo was inaccurate and that its release could threaten national security by disclosing federal surveillance methods. She added that Republicans were engaged in a \"cover-up campaign\" to protect Trump: \"House Republicans' pattern of obstruction and cover-up to hide the truth about the Trump-Russia scandal represents a threat to our intelligence and our national security. The GOP has led a partisan effort to distort intelligence and discredit the U.S. law enforcement and intelligence communities.\"[109] She charged Nunes with \"deliberately dishonest actions\" and called for his immediate removal from his position.[110] In February 2018, Pelosi broke the record for longest House speech using the \"magic minute\" custom when she spent more than eight hours recounting stories from DREAMers—people brought to the United States as minors by undocumented immigrants—to object to a budget deal that would raise spending caps without addressing the future of DACA recipients, who were at risk of deportation by the Trump administration.[111][112][113] In May 2018, after the White House invited two Republicans and no Democrats to a Department of Justice briefing on an FBI informant who had made contact with the Trump campaign,[114] Pelosi and Schumer sent a letter to Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein and FBI director Wray calling for \"a bipartisan Gang of Eight briefing that involves congressional leadership from both chambers\".[115] In August 2018, Pelosi called for Duncan D. Hunter's resignation after his indictment on charges of misusing at least $250,000 in campaign funds, saying the charges were \"evidence of the rampant culture of corruption among Republicans in Washington today\".[116] In April 2018, Peter Beinart wrote in The Atlantic that Pelosi had been \"the most effective congressional leader of modern times—and, not coincidentally, the most vilified.\"[90] In the 2018 elections, the Democrats recaptured a House majority, gaining 41 seats. This was the party's largest gain in the House since the 1974 post-Watergate elections.[117][118] On November 28, House Democrats nominated Pelosi to once again serve as speaker.[119] She was reelected to the speakership at the start of the 116th Congress on January 3, 2019. Pelosi \"clinched the speakership after weeks of whittling down opposition from some fellow Democrats seeking a new generation of leadership. The deal to win over holdouts put an expiration date on her tenure: she promised not to stay more than four years in the job\". 220 House Democrats voted for Pelosi as Speaker and 15 for someone else or no one.[120] On February 4, 2020, at the conclusion of Trump's State of the Union address, Pelosi tore up her official copy of it.[121] Her stated reason for doing so was \"because it was a courteous thing to do considering the alternatives. It was a such a dirty speech\".[122] Trump and other Republicans criticized her for this.[123][124] In December 2021, Pelosi announced her candidacy for reelection to the House in 2022.[125] In 2018, and again in 2020, she had agreed not to stay on as speaker beyond January 2023, but otherwise avoided questions about her future.[126] In 2022, Pelosi was reelected, but the Democratic Party lost the House majority.[127] Ten days later, she announced that she would not seek a Democratic leadership post in the next Congress.[128][129] At the start of the 116th Congress, Pelosi opposed Trump's attempts to use the 2018–2019 federal government shutdown (which she called a \"hostage-taking\" of civil servants) as leverage to build a substantial wall on the U.S.-Mexico border.[130] She declined to allow Trump to give the State of the Union Address in the House chamber while the shutdown was ongoing.[131][132] After several polls showed Trump's popularity sharply falling due to the shutdown, on January 25, 2019, Trump signed a stopgap bill to reopen the government without any concessions regarding a border wall for three weeks to allow negotiations on an appropriations bill. But he reiterated his demand for border wall funding and said he would shut the government down again or declare a national emergency and use military funding to build the wall if Congress did not appropriate the funds by February 15.[133] On February 15, Trump declared a national emergency in order to bypass Congress, after being unsatisfied with a bipartisan bill that had passed the House and Senate the day before.[134] On September 29, 2019, Pelosi announced the launch of an impeachment inquiry against Trump.[135] On December 5, 2019, after the inquiry had taken place, Pelosi authorized the Judiciary Committee to begin drafting articles of impeachment.[136] After hearings were held,[137] two articles of impeachment were announced on December 10.[138] The House of Representatives approved both articles on December 18, thereby formally impeaching Trump.[139] The day after the January 6 United States Capitol attack, Pelosi demanded that Trump either resign or be removed from office through the clauses of section four the Twenty-Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution, threatening impeachment if this did not happen.[140] On January 10, she issued a 24-hour ultimatum to Vice President Mike Pence, that if he did not invoke the 25th amendment, she would proceed with legislation to impeach Trump.[141] On January 13, the House voted to impeach Trump a second time.[142] Pelosi facilitated passage of the CARES Act.[143] She attracted controversy when footage emerged in early September 2020 of her visiting a hair salon in San Francisco. This was contrary to regulations enforced at that time preventing service indoors.[144] Criticized for hypocrisy by Trump and the owners of the salon, Pelosi described the situation as \"clearly a setup\". Her stylist and other Democrats defended her.[145] Pelosi played a key role in the 2021 passage of the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act. The New York Times credited the legislation's passage to Pelosi's decision to adopt a Congressional Black Caucus proposal to pair together the final vote on the bill with a good-faith vote on the rules governing debate on a subsequent social safety net bill. The Times noted that Pelosi did not make herself the public face of this, instead having Congressional Black Caucus Chairwoman Joyce Beatty persuade House Democratic Caucus members to accept the proposal. The New York Times wrote, \"in effect, the speaker had harnessed one faction of her unruly Democrats to win over two others.\"[146] Chris Cillizza of CNN wrote: Consider the challenge Pelosi faced with this infrastructure bill—starting with the fact that she had only a three-seat majority, meaning that even a handful of renegade Democrats could scuttle the entire thing. Then add in the total lack of trust not only between House liberals and Senate moderates but also the decided lack of trust between House liberals and House moderates. And sprinkle in the fact that the entire bill had been at an impasse for months as both sides of the party wrangled for leverage on the broader $1.75 trillion social safety net legislation.[146] During the 117th Congress, the CHIPS and Science Act, Inflation Reduction Act, and Honoring our PACT Act of 2022 (PACT Act) were passed.[147] As with her first tenure, experts gave Pelosi's second tenure as speaker high marks, with many opining that during her two tenures as speaker she had been among the most effective individuals to hold the position. In June 2019, Brent Budowsky opined in The Hill that Pelosi had been \"the most important, consequential and effective Speaker since Tip O'Neill\" as well as \"one of the greatest Speakers who ever served.\"[148] In January 2020, on the eve of Trump's first impeachment trial before the U.S. Senate, Washington Post political writer Paul Kane called Pelosi the most powerful House speaker in at least 25 years, noting that some historians were comparing her influence to that of former speaker Sam Rayburn.[149] In 2021, former Republican speaker John Boehner opined that Pelosi had been the most powerful House speaker in U.S. history.[150] In November 2022, Chris Cillizza wrote that Pelosi was \"the most effective speaker ever.\"[146] Johnathan Bernstein opined for The Washington Post and Bloomberg News that Pelosi was \"the greatest speaker in history.\"[151] Jackie Calmes of the Los Angeles Times shared the same opinion.[152] Sarah Ferris of Politico called Pelosi \"a legislative giant regarded as one of the most powerful speakers in modern U.S. history.\"[153] Historian Lindsay M. Chervinsky wrote for NBC News that Pelosi was \"one of the most effective speakers in history\" and had been so while facing \"the double standards that apply to powerful women.\"[147] John Haduk wrote for the Brookings Institution: Whether you agree with her politics or not, it is undeniable that [Pelosi] has been a remarkably effective House leader. That success has come as both House Minority Leader and as Speaker of the House. As Speaker, she has worked with a majority as large as 81 seats in November and December 2009 (258–177) and one as small as 6 seats from April to May 2021 (218–212).[154] A number of progressive and liberal-leaning outlets published strong assessments of Pelosi's tenure. Harold Meyerson opined that Pelosi had been the greatest speaker in U.S. history in an article in The American Prospect.[155] Amanda Marcotte of Salon.com opined that Pelosi was the greatest speaker of all time, calling her \"both the most effective and most progressive House speaker of all time.\" Marcotte added that Pelosi had been effective \"both in terms of managing an unruly caucus and being able to push her party in more progressive directions.\"[156] On November 29, 2022, the Steering and Policy Committee of the House Democratic Caucus honorarily named Pelosi \"speaker emerita\" in the upcoming 118th U.S. Congress.[157][158] Her second speakership, and her participation in the House Democratic Party leadership, concluded on January 3, 2023, at the end of the 117th Congress.[159] Amid concerns about President Biden's reelection prospects in the 2024 presidential election, Pelosi played a key role in the effort to pressure him to withdraw his candidacy before the Democratic National Convention.[160] She personally warned Biden that she feared his faltering candidacy might not only result in Trump's victory but also have a coattail effect that could bring Democrats defeat in the coinciding House and Senate elections and give Republicans a government trifecta. When Democratic members of Congress privately sought her guidance on how to handle their concerns, Pelosi advised them \"speak their conscience\". On the July 10 edition of MSNBC’s Morning Joe, Pelosi said the party encouraged Biden to make the decision because time was running out.[161] Later that day, Pelosi's office stated: \"Speaker Pelosi fully supports whatever President Biden decides to do. We must turn our attention to why this race is so important: Donald Trump would be a disaster for our country and our democracy.\"[162] The growing number of members of Congress calling for Biden to withdraw heightened the pressure on him.[163][164][165] Biden withdrew his candidacy on July 21 and endorsed Vice President Kamala Harris as the party's presidential nominee.[166] Before Biden withdrew, Pelosi had expressed to other California congressional Democrats her belief that the possible selection of a new nominee should be done competitively through an \"open process\".[167] She briefly held off from endorsing Harris's candidacy[168] before doing so the next day.[169] Although Harris did not win any primary elections, Pelosi insisted that the process that led to Harris's nomination was a \"primary\". She told Semafor on September 18 that Harris earned her nomination because \"We had an open primary, and she won it. Nobody else got in the race.\"[170][171] After Harris lost to Trump, Pelosi blamed Biden's late exit from the race and the lack of an open Democratic primary.[172] In the House, Pelosi served on the Appropriations and Intelligence Committees and was the ranking member on the latter until her election as minority leader.[173] She is a member of the House Baltic Caucus and the Congressional Equality Caucus.[174][175] Early in her political career, Pelosi established herself as a prominent fundraiser in the party.[30] She was one of the party's most prolific fundraisers, transferring significant funds to committees for other candidates.[176][177] During the 2000 and 2002 election cycles, compared to other members of Congress, she contributed the most money to other congressional campaigns.[178] In 2006, Pelosi was the Democratic Party's third-largest fundraiser, behind former first couple Bill and Hillary Clinton.[44] From 2003 to 2014, Pelosi raised more than $400 million in campaign funds.[177] Pelosi was a founding member of the Congressional Progressive Caucus, which she left in 2003 after being elected House minority leader.[179] She is still widely considered a liberal.[180][181] In 2001, she voted in favor of the USA Patriot Act, but voted against reauthorization of certain provisions in 2005.[182] She voted against a Constitutional amendment banning flag-burning.[183] Pelosi voted against the Secure Fence Act of 2006.[184] In June 2018, Pelosi visited a federal facility used to detain migrant children separated from their parents and subsequently called for the resignation of Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen.[185] In July, Pelosi characterized the compromise immigration bill by the Republicans as a \"deal with the devil\" and said she had not had conversations with House Speaker Ryan about a legislative solution to the separation of families at the southern border.[186] In April 2021, after southern border crossings peaked, House Republicans criticized Pelosi for saying that immigration under the Biden administration was \"on a good path\". U.S. Customs and Border Protection reported that nearly 19,000 unaccompanied minors arrived in March.[187] Pelosi has long supported LGBT rights. In 1996, she voted against the Defense of Marriage Act,[188] and in 2004 and 2006, she voted against the proposed Federal Marriage Amendment, which would amend the United States Constitution to define marriage federally as being between one man and one woman, thereby overriding states' individual rights to legalize same-sex marriage.[189][190][191] When the Supreme Court of California overturned the state's ban on marriage between same-sex couples in 2008, Pelosi released a statement welcoming the \"historic decision\". She also indirectly voiced her opposition to California Proposition 8, a successful 2008 state ballot initiative which defined marriage in California as a union between one man and one woman.[192] In 2012, Pelosi said her position on LGBT rights such as same-sex marriage grows from and reflects her Catholic faith; it also places her at odds with Catholic doctrine, which defines marriage as a union between one man and one woman. She said: \"My religion compels me—and I love it for it—to be against discrimination of any kind in our country, and I consider [the ban on gay marriage] a form of discrimination. I think it's unconstitutional on top of that.\"[193] Pelosi supports the Equality Act, a bill that would expand the federal Civil Rights Act of 1964 to ban discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity. In 2019, she spoke in Congress in favor of the bill and called for ending discrimination against LGBT people. Pelosi also opposed Trump's transgender military ban.[194] Pelosi supports reform in marijuana laws, although NORML's deputy director Paul Armentano said she and other members of Congress had not done anything to change the laws.[195] She also supports use of medical marijuana.[196] As of 2014, Pelosi supported the Bush/Obama NSA surveillance program PRISM.[197] Pelosi repeatedly criticized the fact that the United States Capitol exhibited artworks depicting people who in various capacities supported the Confederacy in the American Civil War.[198][199][200] In 2017, this included at least 10 statues in the National Statuary Hall Collection, either in the National Statuary Hall itself or some less prominent Capitol rooms.[199] Almost all the statues in that collection were selected and donated by the states (two from each state) and could only be exchanged for others by an ordered process involving the consent of the states' legislatures and governors, but the speaker of the House directly could influence their precise placement. During her first tenure as speaker, Pelosi moved the statue of Robert E. Lee from the National Statuary Hall of the U.S. Capitol to the Capitol crypt.[198] In August 2017, she supported an initiative by Senator Cory Booker to have Confederate monuments and memorials removed from the Capitol Building by means of legislation.[199] In June 2020, following the nationwide protests over the murder of George Floyd, Pelosi pushed for the removal of all statues of Confederates from the Capitol. On June 18, Pelosi also ordered that four paintings of former Confederates in the Capitol Speaker's Gallery be taken down.[200] \"We didn't know about this until we were taking inventory of the statues and the curator told us that there were four paintings of Speakers in the Capitol of the United States, four Speakers who had served in the Confederacy\", Pelosi told reporters.[200] In 2002, while Pelosi was the ranking member of the House Intelligence Committee, she was briefed on the ongoing use of \"enhanced interrogation techniques\", including waterboarding, authorized for a captured terrorist, Abu Zubaydah.[201][202][203] After the briefing, Pelosi said she \"was assured by lawyers with the CIA and the Department of Justice that the methods were legal\".[204] Two unnamed former Bush administration officials say the briefing was detailed and graphic, and at the time she did not raise substantial objections.[205] One unnamed U.S. official present during the early briefings said, \"In fairness, the environment was different then because we were closer to September 11 and people were still in a panic. But there was no objecting, no hand-wringing. The attitude was, 'We don't care what you do to those guys as long as you get the information you need to protect the American people.'\"[206] These techniques later became controversial, and in 2007 Pelosi's office said she had protested their use at the time, and she concurred with objections raised by Democratic colleague Jane Harman in a letter to the CIA in early 2003.[207] Subsequently, several leading Democratic lawmakers in the House signed a letter on June 26, 2009, alleging CIA Director Leon Panetta had asserted that the CIA misled Congress for a \"number of years\" spanning back to 2001, casting clouds on the controversy.[208] The letter, lawmakers and the CIA all providing no details, and the circumstances surrounding the allegations, make it hard to assess the claims and counterclaims of both sides.[209] Officials in Congress say her ability to challenge the practices may have been hampered by strict rules of secrecy that prohibited her from taking notes or consulting legal experts or members of her own staffs.[210] In an April 2009 press conference, Pelosi said: \"In that or any other briefing ... we were not, and I repeat, were not told that waterboarding or any of these other enhanced interrogation techniques were used. What they did tell us is that they had some legislative counsel—the Office of Legislative Counsel opinions that they could be used, but not that they would. And they further [...] the point was that if and when they would be used, they would brief Congress at that time.\"[201][211] Pelosi voted against the 1995 Balanced Budget Proposed Constitutional Amendment, which passed the House by a 300–132 vote, but fell two votes short of the 2/3 supermajority required in the Senate (with 65 senators voting in favor).[212] As Speaker of the House, she spearheaded the Fair Minimum Wage Act of 2007 as part of the 100-Hour Plan. The act raises the minimum wage in the United States and the territories of the Northern Marianas Islands and American Samoa. American Samoa was initially absent from the act, but it was included as part of HR 2206. One Republican congressman who voted against the initial bill accused Pelosi of unethically benefiting Del Monte Foods (headquartered in her district) by excluding the territory, where Del Monte's StarKist Tuna brand is a major employer.[213] Pelosi co-sponsored legislation that omitted American Samoa from a raise in the minimum wage as early as 1999, before Del Monte's acquisition of StarKist Tuna in 2002.[214] Pelosi opposed the welfare reform President Bush proposed as well as reforms proposed and passed under President Clinton.[215] She also opposed the tax reform signed by Trump in December 2017, calling it \"probably one of the worst bills in the history of the United States of America ... It robs from the future [and] it rewards the rich ... and corporations at the expense of tens of millions of working middle-class families in our country.\"[216] She said \"this is Armageddon\" and argued that the tax bill increased the debt in a way that would adversely impact social insurance spending.[217] In January 2018, shortly after the tax bill passed, a reporter asked Pelosi to respond to statements by companies crediting the tax cuts with allowing them to raise wages and give bonuses. She said that, given the benefits corporations received from the tax bill, the benefits workers got were \"crumbs\".[218][219] Most companies that awarded bonuses gave out payments of hundreds of dollars, while some gave bonuses significantly over $1,000.[220] In November 2018, Pelosi said she had spoken with Trump about infrastructure development. Though he \"really didn't come through with it in his first two years in office\" while it was a topic during his campaign, the subject had not been a partisan matter in Congress. She mentioned potential bipartisan legislative initiatives that would \"create good paying jobs and will also generate other economic growth in their regions\".[221] On May 1, 2019, Pelosi and Schumer met with Trump about infrastructure funding.[222] In late May, a meeting to discuss an impending $2 trillion infrastructure plan was cut short when Trump abruptly left after only a few minutes.[223] In August 2018, after Trump signed an emergency declaration for federal aid in combating the Carr Fire in Northern California, Pelosi called the move \"an important first step\" but requested that Trump accede to California Governor Jerry Brown's request for further aid to other hard-hit areas in California. She called on the Trump administration to take \"real, urgent action to combat the threat of the climate crisis, which is making the wildfire season longer, more expensive and more destructive\".[224] In 1999, Pelosi voted against displaying the Ten Commandments in public buildings, including schools.[225] She voted for the No Child Left Behind Act,[226] which instituted testing to track students' progress and authorized an increase in overall education spending.[227][228] In 2019, Pelosi said climate change was \"the existential threat of our time\" and called for action to curb it.[229] She has supported the development of new technologies to reduce U.S. dependence on foreign oil and remediate the adverse environmental effects of burning fossil fuels.[230] Pelosi has widely supported conservation programs and energy research appropriations. She has also voted to remove an amendment that would allow for oil and gas exploration in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge.[231][232] Pelosi has blocked efforts to revive offshore oil drilling in protected areas, reasoning that offshore drilling could lead to an increase in dependence on fossil fuels.[233] Pelosi was instrumental in passing the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010.[234] She was a key figure in convincing Obama to continue pushing for health-care reform after the election of Massachusetts Senator Scott Brown in a January special election—a defeat seen as potentially fatal to Democratic reform efforts.[81] After delivering 219 votes in the House for Obama's health-care package, Pelosi was both praised and heckled as she made her way to Capitol Hill.[235][83] Pelosi has voted to increase Medicare and Medicaid benefits.[236] She does not endorse Senator Bernie Sanders's bill for single-payer healthcare.[237][238] On March 10, 2017, Pelosi said Democrats would continue battling Republican efforts to repeal the Affordable Care Act, but would also be willing to form a compromise measure if Republicans reached out for support. She indicated her support for the Republican plan to expand Health Savings Accounts and said the question of Republicans' accepting an expansion of Medicaid was important.[239] In September, Pelosi sent a letter to Democrats praising Senator John McCain for announcing his opposition to the latest Republican effort to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act and called on lawmakers and advocacy groups alike to pressure Republicans in the health-care discussion. She said Democrats would be unified in putting \"a stake in the heart of this monstrous bill\".[240] In July 2018, during a speech at Independence First, Pelosi said Democrats' goal \"has always been to expand coverage and to do so in a way that improves benefits ... and we have to address the affordability issue that is so undermined by the Republicans.\"[241] In November 2018, after Democrats gained a majority in the House in the midterm elections, she said, \"I'm staying as Speaker to protect the Affordable Care Act. That's my main issue, because I think that's, again, about the health and financial health of the America's families, and if Hillary had won, I could go home.\" She added that Republicans had misrepresented their earlier position of opposition to covering people with preexisting conditions during the election cycle and called on them to join Democrats in \"removing all doubt that the preexisting medical condition is the law—the benefit—is the law of the land\".[242] Pelosi voted against the Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act of 2003 and earlier attempts at similar bans, and voted against the criminalization of certain situations where a minor is transported across state lines for an abortion (HR 748, passed).[243] She has voted in favor of lifting the ban on privately funded abortions at overseas U.S. military facilities (HA 209, rejected); in favor of an amendment that would repeal a provision forbidding servicewomen and dependents from getting an abortion in overseas military hospitals (HA 722, rejected); and in favor of stripping the prohibition of funding for organizations working overseas that use their own funds to provide abortion services, or engage in advocacy related to abortion services (HA 997, rejected). She also voted in favor of the 1998 Abortion Funding Amendment, which would have allowed the use of district funds to promote abortion-related activities, but would have prohibited the use of federal funds.[243] In 2008, she was rebuked by Archbishop Donald Wuerl of Washington, D.C., for being \"incorrect\" in comments she made to Tom Brokaw on Meet the Press concerning Church teaching on the subjects of abortion of when a human life begins. The archbishop's statement quoted Pelosi as saying the church has not been able to define when life begins. During the interview she said, \"over the history of the church, this [what constitutes the moment of conception] is an issue of controversy.\"[244] In February 2009, Pelosi met with her bishop, Archbishop George Hugh Niederauer of San Francisco, and with Pope Benedict XVI regarding the controversy. Pelosi opposed the 2022 overturning of Roe v. Wade, calling it \"cruel\", \"outrageous\" and \"heart-wrenching\".[245] In a January 25, 2009, interview with George Stephanopoulos for ABC News, Pelosi said that one of the reasons she supported family planning services was that they would \"reduce costs to states and to the federal government.\"[246] Pelosi stands in favor of increased background checks for potential gun owners, as well as the banning of assault weapons. In February 2013, she called for the \"Boldest possible move\" on gun control, similar to a stance made just weeks earlier by former Representative, mass shooting victim, and fellow gun control advocate Gabby Giffords.[247] In 2012, she was given a 0% rating by Gun Owners of America and a 7% rating from the National Rifle Association of America for her stances on gun control.[248] In February 2018, following the Stoneman Douglas High School shooting, Pelosi said Republicans' \"cowering\" to the gun lobby was \"an assault on our whole country\" and that the victims were \"paying the price for our inaction\".[249] She requested House Speaker Ryan and Republicans take action via consideration of legislation expanding background checks or authorizing researchers to use federal dollars to examine public health as it relates to gun violence. Pelosi also advocated for the creation of a special committee on gun violence and said Republicans had previously created committees to investigate Planned Parenthood and the 2012 Benghazi attack.[249] In November 2018, after the Thousand Oaks shooting, Pelosi released a statement saying Americans \"deserve real action to end the daily epidemic of gun violence that is stealing the lives of our children on campuses, in places of worship and on our streets\" and pledged that gun control would be a priority for House Democrats in the 116th United States Congress.[250] With regard to Representative Charles Rangel's (D-NY) plan to introduce legislation that would reinstate the draft, Pelosi said she did not support it.[251] In March 2009, conservative watchdog group Judicial Watch had obtained emails sent by Pelosi's staff requesting the United States Air Force (USAF) to provide specific aircraft—a Boeing 757—for Pelosi to use for taxpayer-funded travel.[252] Pelosi responded that the policy was initiated by President Bush due to post-9/11 security concerns (Pelosi was third in line for presidential succession), and was initially provided for the previous Speaker Dennis Hastert. The Sergeant at Arms requested—for security reasons—that the plane provided be capable of non-stop flight, requiring a larger aircraft. The Pentagon said \"no one has rendered judgment\" that Pelosi's use of aircraft \"is excessive\".[253] During the first Trump administration, Pelosi voted in line with the president's stated position 17.6% of the time.[254] During a news conference on June 9, 2017, after a reporter asked her about tweets by President Donald Trump lambasting former FBI director James Comey following Comey's testimony to the Senate Intelligence Committee, Pelosi said no one at the White House seemed courageous enough to tell Trump his tweets were beneath the dignity of the presidency and that she was worried about his fitness for office.[255] In November, when asked about Democrats beginning the impeachment process against Trump in the event they won a majority of seats in the 2018 elections, Pelosi said it would not be one of their legislative priorities but that the option could be considered if credible evidence appeared during the ongoing investigations into Russian interference in the 2016 election.[256] In January 2018, Pelosi referred to Trump's 2018 State of the Union Address as a performance without serious policy ideas the parties could collaborate on. She questioned Trump's refusal to implement Russian sanctions after more than 500 members of Congress voted to approve them.[257] In February, after Trump blocked the release of a Democratic memo by the Intelligence Committee, Pelosi said the act was \"a stunningly brazen attempt to cover up the truth about the Trump-Russia scandal from the American people\" and \"part of a dangerous and desperate pattern of cover-up on the part of the president who has shown he had something to hide.\"[258] In March, Pelosi said she was \"more concerned about the president's policies which undermine the financial security of America's working families\" than the Stormy Daniels–Donald Trump scandal. Pelosi did note the scandal as having highlighted a double standard of Republicans on issues of family values and expectations of presidential behavior, saying the party would be very involved if the event was happening to a Democrat.[259] In April, following Scooter Libby being pardoned by Trump, Pelosi released a statement saying the pardon \"sends a troubling signal to the president's allies that obstructing justice will be rewarded and that the idea of those who lie under oath being granted a pardon \"poses a threat to the integrity of the special counsel investigation, and to our democracy\".[260] On August 15, after Trump revoked the security clearance of former CIA director John Brennan, Pelosi said the move was \"a stunning abuse of power [and] a pathetic attempt to silence critics\", and an attempt by Trump to distract attention from other issues of his administration.[261] Pelosi and Charles E. Schumer met with Trump and Pence in December 2018 to discuss changes to be made when the new Democratic representatives takes office in 2019.[262] In January 2019 she supported President Trump in his decision to back the leader of the opposition Juan Guaidó during Venezuelan protests and constitutional crisis.[263] The Democrats gained control of the House of Representatives in the November 2018 elections, and Pelosi took office as Speaker. Multiple House committees launched investigations into various actions by Trump and some of his cabinet members and requested or subpoenaed documents and information from the White House and the administration.[264] In April 2019, Trump vowed to defy \"all\" subpoenas from the House and to refuse to allow current or former administration officials to testify before House committees.[265] Pelosi initially resisted efforts by some fellow House Democrats to pursue Trump's impeachment,[266][267] but in September 2019, following revelations of the Trump–Ukraine scandal, announced the beginning of a formal House impeachment inquiry, saying \"The actions taken to date by the president have seriously violated the Constitution\" and that Trump \"must be held accountable—no one is above the law.\"[268] Privately, Pelosi expressed concern that focusing on impeachment would imperil the Democrats' House majority; she preferred to focus on other legislation.[269] In May 2019, the White House intervened to halt former White House Counsel Don McGahn from complying with a subpoena issued by the House Judiciary Committee, instructing the committee to redirect its records requests to the White House. Pelosi, who had previously urged \"Democrats to focus on fact-finding rather than the prospect of any impeachment\",[270][271] described Trump's interference regarding McGahn's records as an obstruction of justice, saying that \"Trump is goading us to impeach him.\"[272][273] Later that month, as the Trump administration continued to ignore subpoenas, refuse to release documents, and encourage or order current and former officials not to testify in Congress, Pelosi declared: \"we believe that the president of the United States is engaged in a cover-up.\"[274] Later that day, after learning of Pelosi's comments, Trump walked away from a scheduled White House meeting with Pelosi and Schumer, in which a $2 trillion infrastructure plan was supposed to be discussed. Trump told Pelosi and Schumer he could not work with them until they stopped investigating him. Later in the day, Pelosi accused Trump of \"obstructing justice\" and again said he \"is engaged in a cover-up\".[275] On June 5, 2019, during a meeting with senior Democrats about whether the House should launch impeachment proceeding against Trump, Pelosi said, \"I don't want to see him impeached, I want to see him in prison.\" According to multiple sources, rather than impeachment, she wanted to see Trump lose to a Democrat in the 2020 election, following which he could be prosecuted.[276] Eventually, under pressure from an alliance of left-wing Representatives led by Chair of the House Judiciary Committee Jerry Nadler, Pelosi backed an impeachment inquiry.[269] The House impeachment inquiry focused on efforts by Trump and Trump administration officials to pressure the government of Ukraine to smear former Vice President Joe Biden, a political rival of Trump's, while withholding $400 million in U.S. military aid, and a White House visit, from Ukraine; the inquiry also examined Trump's request in a July 2019 phone call to Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky to \"do us a favor\" and investigate Biden.[277] On December 18, 2019, the House voted nearly along party lines to impeach Trump for abuse of power (230–197) and obstruction of Congress (229–198), making him the third president in U.S. history to be impeached. Pelosi said, when opening debate on the articles of impeachment, \"If we do not act now, we would be derelict in our duty. It is tragic that the president's reckless actions make impeachment necessary. He gave us no choice.\"[277] Pelosi initially did not transmit the articles of impeachment to the Republican-controlled Senate for trial, seeking to negotiate an agreement with Senate Majority Mitch McConnell for the Senate to hear witness testimony and other additional evidence as part of a bid for a \"full and fair\" trial. McConnell rejected these efforts, and the House transmitted the articles to the Senate on January 15, 2020, with Pelosi naming seven Democratic Representatives, led by Representative Adam Schiff, as the House managers to argue the impeachment case against Trump in the Senate.[278][279] As expected, the Senate ultimately acquitted Trump in a nearly-party line vote in which every Democrat voted for conviction and all but one Republican, Senator Mitt Romney, voting for acquittal.[280] Ahead of the Senate vote Pelosi said that, irrespective of the outcome, the president \"has been impeached forever\", that the impeachment process had successfully \"pulled back a veil of behavior totally unacceptable to our founders, and that the public will see this with a clearer eye, an unblurred eye.\"[281] Following the Senate vote, Pelosi criticized Trump and Senate Republicans, saying their actions had \"normalized lawlessness and rejected the system of checks and balances\".[282][283] Following the Senate vote, Trump claimed vindication and criticized Democrats, the FBI, and Pelosi. In a speech at the National Prayer Breakfast, Trump referred to Pelosi as \"a horrible person\", and questioned her religious faith; Pelosi said these remarks were \"particularly without class\".[284] Before Trump's February 4, 2020 State of the Union Address, the day before the Senate impeachment vote, Trump and Pelosi exchanged mutual snubs.[285][286] Trump refused to shake Pelosi's outstretched hand, and Pelosi tore up her copy of Trump's speech.[285][286] Her stated reason for doing so was \"because it was a courteous thing to do considering the alternatives. It was a such a dirty speech.\"[287] Pelosi also said Trump's speech \"had no contact with reality whatsoever\"[288] and suggested the president appeared \"a little sedated\" during the address.[284] Pelosi's action was criticized by Trump and others.[289][290] Days after the Senate impeachment vote, Trump fired two officials who had testified against him during the impeachment inquiry: U.S. Ambassador to the European Union Gordon Sondland and Lieutenant Colonel Alexander Vindman, a National Security Council official. Pelosi called the firing of Vindman a \"shameful\" and \"clear and brazen act of retaliation that showcases the President's fear of the truth\", saying that \"History will remember Lieutenant Colonel Vindman as an American hero.\"[291] On October 8, 2020, Pelosi announced that legislation was being introduced in the House of Representatives to advance the creation of a commission to allow the use of the 25th Amendment to the Constitution to intervene and remove Trump from executive duties.[292] As of October 2022, Pelosi had voted in line with Joe Biden's stated position 100% of the time.[293] After the 1989 Tiananmen Square protests, Pelosi sought to take a harsher position toward China than President George H.W. Bush.[294]: 210 With the support of Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell, she took a lead role for the Democrats in criticizing Bush's China policy.[294]: 210 Pelosi's view was that Congress should oppose the annual presidential waiver for China under the Jackson-Vanik Amendment, an amendment to the Trade Act of 1974 that required the president to inform Congress if he intended to waive the Act to have a most favored nation trading relationship with a non-market economy.[294]: 211 Pelosi said that if China's economy suffered, Chinese people would be unhappy with their government and this would serve to advance democracy in China.[294]: 223 As part of a Congressional delegation, Pelosi unfurled a banner in the square in 1991, provoking a confrontation with Chinese police.[295] She advocated for Chinese political prisoners and dissidents to be able to come to the U.S.[295] In 1999, ahead of Chinese Premier Zhu Rongji's visit to the U.S. for talks over World Trade Organization admission for China, Pelosi called on President Clinton and Vice President Gore to ask Zhu to recognize the 1989 protests as a pro-democracy effort.[296] In 2008, after a meeting with the Dalai Lama and officials in the Tibetan government-in-exile, Pelosi criticized the People's Republic of China for its handling of the unrest in Tibet; addressing a crowd of thousands of Tibetans in Dharamsala, India, Pelosi called on \"freedom-loving people\" worldwide to denounce China for its human rights abuses in Tibet.[297] The same year, Pelosi commended the European Parliament for its \"bold decision\" to award the Sakharov Prize for Freedom of Thought to Chinese dissident and human rights activist Hu Jia, and called upon the Chinese government \"to immediately and unconditionally release Hu Jia from prison and to respect the fundamental freedoms of all the people in China.\"[298] In 2010, Pelosi backed a bill naming China a currency manipulator, which would appease exporters.[299] Pelosi criticized the imprisonment of Hong Kong democracy activists in August 2017 for their roles in a protest at the Civic Square in front of the Central Government Complex in Hong Kong. She called the ruling an injustice that should \"shock the conscience of the world\".[300] Before the Trump administration took concrete measures against China in late March 2018, Pelosi and other Democratic leaders pressed Trump to focus more on China and impose real punishments, such as fulfilling his own campaign commitments to name China a currency manipulator and stop China from pressuring U.S. tech companies into giving up intellectual property rights. Pelosi urged Trump to take a strong stand against unfair market barriers in China.[301][302][303][304] In September 2019, Pelosi met with Hong Kong pro-democracy activist Joshua Wong on Capitol Hill; Chinese media responded by accusing Pelosi of \"backing and encouraging radical activists\".[305] On the eve of the 2022 Winter Olympics in Beijing, Pelosi advised American athletes competing: \"I would say to our athletes, 'You're there to compete. Do not risk incurring the anger of the Chinese government, because they are ruthless'\".[306] On August 2, 2022, Pelosi became the highest-ranking U.S. government official to visit Taiwan in 25 years.[307][308][309] President Joe Biden discouraged but did not prevent Pelosi from traveling to Taiwan, and the White House later affirmed her right to visit.[310][311][312] Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell and 25 Senate Republicans backed Pelosi's decision to visit,[313] issuing a joint statement that also supported the trip.[314] Her trip triggered a new round of hostilities in the already tense relationship between the U.S. and China.[315] During and after her visit, China undertook a series of retaliatory measures against Taiwan and the United States. Pelosi said her visit was a sign of the U.S. Congress's commitment to Taiwan.[315] During her visit, she met with Taiwanese President Tsai Ing-Wen and called Taiwan one of the \"freest societies in the world\".[316] Pelosi publicly scolded Colombian president Álvaro Uribe during Uribe's May 2007 state visit to America. Pelosi met with Uribe and later released a statement that she and other members of Congress had \"expressed growing concerns about the serious allegations\" of links between paramilitary groups and Colombian government officials.[317] Pelosi also came out against the Colombian free-trade agreement.[318] In 2008, Pelosi said: \"For years, I have opposed the embargo on Cuba. I don't think it's been successful, and I think we have to remove the travel bans and have more exchanges—people to people exchanges with Cuba.\"[319] In 2015, Pelosi supported President Obama's Cuban Thaw, a rapprochement between the U.S. and Castro's regime in Cuba, and visited Havana for meetings with high-level officials.[320] Pelosi opposed U.S. intervention in the 1991 Gulf War.[215][321] In an interview on February 15, 2007, Pelosi said that Bush consistently said he supports a diplomatic resolution to differences with Iran \"and I take him at his word\". At the same time, she said, \"I do believe that Congress should assert itself, though, and make it very clear that there is no previous authority for the president, any president, to go into Iran\".[322] On January 12, 2007, Congressman Walter B. Jones of North Carolina introduced a resolution[323] requiring that—absent a national emergency created by an attack, or a demonstrably imminent attack, by Iran upon the United States or its armed forces—the president must consult with Congress and receive specific authorization prior to initiating any use of military force against Iran.[324] This resolution was removed from a military spending bill for the war in Iraq by Pelosi on March 13, 2007. In July 2015, Pelosi said she was convinced Obama would have enough votes to secure the Iran nuclear deal, crediting the president with having made a \"very strong and forceful presentation of his case supporting the nuclear agreement with Iran\" and called the deal \"a diplomatic masterpiece\".[325] In 2016, Pelosi argued against two bills that if enacted would block Iran's access to the dollar and impose sanctions for its ballistic missile program: \"Regardless of whether you supported the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), we all agree that Iran must not possess a nuclear weapon. At this time, the JCPOA is the best way to achieve this critical goal.\"[326] In May 2018, after Trump announced his intention to withdraw from the Iran nuclear deal, Pelosi said the decision was an abdication of American leadership and \"particularly senseless, disturbing & dangerous\".[327] In 2002, Pelosi opposed the Iraq Resolution authorizing President George W. Bush to use military force against Iraq, which passed the House on a 296–133 vote.[31][32] Pelosi said that \"unilateral use of force without first exhausting every diplomatic remedy and other remedies and making a case to the American people will be harmful to our war on terrorism.\"[33] In explaining her opposition to the resolution, Pelosi said CIA Director George Tenet had told Congress the likelihood of Saddam Hussein's launching an attack on the U.S. using weapons of mass destruction was low, saying: \"This is about the Constitution It is about this Congress asserting its right to declare war when we are fully aware what the challenges are to us. It is about respecting the United Nations and a multilateral approach, which is safer for our troops.\"[32] Although Pelosi voted against the Iraq War, anti-war activists in San Francisco protested against her voting to continue funding the war. UC Berkeley political scientist Bruce Cain said Pelosi had to balance the demands of her anti-war constituency against the moderate views of Democrats in tight races around the country in her role as minority leader.[328] Pelosi has never faced a serious challenger to her left in her district.[329] Pelosi has reaffirmed that \"America and Israel share an unbreakable bond: in peace and war; and in prosperity and in hardship\".[330] She has emphasized that \"a strong relationship between the United States and Israel has long been supported by both Democrats and Republicans. America's commitment to the safety and security of the State of Israel is unwavering ... [h]owever, the war in Iraq has made both America and Israel less safe.\" Pelosi's voting record shows consistent support for Israel. Pelosi voted in favor of the Jerusalem Embassy Act of 1995, which urged the federal government to relocate the American embassy in Israel to Jerusalem.[331] Before the 2006 elections in the Palestinian Authority, she voted for a Congressional initiative that disapproved of participation in the elections by Hamas and other organizations the legislation defined as terrorist. She agrees with the current U.S. stance in support of land-for-peace. She has applauded Israeli \"hopeful signs\" of offering land while criticizing Palestinian \"threats\" of not demonstrating peace in turn. Pelosi has said, \"If the Palestinians agree to coordinate with Israel on the evacuation, establish the rule of law, and demonstrate a capacity to govern, the world may be convinced that finally there is a real partner for peace\".[330] During the 2006 Lebanon War, Pelosi voted in favor of Resolution 921: \"... seizure of Israeli soldiers by Hezbollah terrorists was an unprovoked attack and Israel has the right, and indeed the obligation, to respond.\" She argues that organizations and political bodies in the Mideast like Hamas and Hezbollah \"have a greater interest in maintaining a state of hostility with Israel than in improving the lives of the people they claim to represent\". Pelosi asserts that civilians on both sides of the border \"have been put at risk by the aggression of Hamas and Hezbollah\" in part for their use of \"civilians as shields by concealing weapons in civilian areas\".[332] In September 2008, Pelosi hosted a reception in Washington with Israeli Speaker of the Knesset Dalia Itzik, along with 20 members of Congress, where they toasted the \"strong friendship\" between Israel and the United States. During the ceremony, Pelosi held up replica dog tags of the three Israeli soldiers captured by Hezbollah and Hamas in 2006 and said she keeps them as a \"symbol of the sacrifices made, sacrifices far too great by the people of the state of Israel\".[333] Pelosi supported Israel in the 2014 Israel–Gaza conflict.[334] In March 2018 Pelosi said, \"There is no greater political accomplishment in the 20th Century than the establishment of the State of Israel.\"[335] Pelosi condemned Rep. Ilhan Omar of Minnesota for posting controversial tweets related to Jews and Israel.[336] In March 2019, she said, \"Israel and America are connected now and forever. We will never allow anyone to make Israel a wedge issue.\"[337] In January 2017, Pelosi voted against a House resolution that would condemn the UN Security Council Resolution 2334. This UN Security Council Resolution called Israeli settlement building in the occupied Palestinian territories in the West Bank a \"flagrant violation\" of international law and a major obstacle to peace.[338][339] She condemned the Boycott, Divestment, and Sanctions (BDS) movement targeting Israel.[340] Pelosi has voiced heavy criticism over Israel's plan to annex parts of the West Bank and the Jordan Valley. She said Israeli annexation would undermine U.S. national security interests.[341] Pelosi said that Democrats are taking \"a great pride\" in Barack Obama's Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) that Israel signed with the Obama administration in 2016, for a guarantee of $38 billion in defense assistance over a decade.[341] On January 28, 2024, Pelosi suggested that some pro-Palestinian protesters calling for a ceasefire in the Israel–Hamas war could be connected to Russia and called on the FBI to investigate the possible connection.[342] Nancy Pelosi is one of the few members of Congress to have traveled to North Korea. She has expressed concern about the danger of nuclear proliferation from the North Korean regime, and the ongoing problems of hunger and oppression imposed by that country's leadership.[343][344] In August 2017, following Trump's warning that North Korea \"will be met with fire and fury like the world has never seen\" in the event of further threats to the United States, Pelosi said the comments were \"recklessly belligerent and demonstrate a grave lack of appreciation for the severity of the North Korean nuclear situation. His saber-rattling and provocative, impulsive rhetoric erode our credibility.\"[345] In November 2017, after the Pentagon sent a letter to lawmakers stating a ground invasion was the only way to destroy all North Korea's nuclear weapons without concern for having missed any, Pelosi said she was concerned about Pyongyang's selling nuclear technology to third parties and called for the United States to \"exhaust every other remedy\".[346] In June 2018, after Trump praised North Korean leader Kim Jong-un, Pelosi said in a statement, \"In his haste to reach an agreement, President Trump elevated North Korea to the level of the United States while preserving the regime's status quo.\"[347] In December 2017, Pelosi wrote a letter to Speaker Paul Ryan advocating for the continued House investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election on the grounds that Americans deserved \"a comprehensive and fair investigation into Russia's attack\" and \"America's democracy and national security\" being at stake. Pelosi cited the need for Congress to \"fully investigate Russia's assault on our election systems to prevent future foreign attacks\".[348] In February 2018, after the release of a Republican report alleging surveillance abuses by the Justice Department, Pelosi accused Trump of siding with Russian president Vladimir Putin at the expense of preserving intelligence sources and methods.[349] In July, Pelosi asserted that Trump was afraid to mention the 12 indictments against people connected to the intelligence community in Russia during his meeting with Putin and questioned what intelligence the Russians had on Trump to cause his behavior.[350] She said Putin would not be welcomed by Congress even if he visited Washington as a result of his actions: \"Putin's ongoing attacks on our elections and on Western democracies and his illegal actions in Crimea and the rest of Ukraine deserve the fierce, unanimous condemnation of the international community, not a VIP ticket to our nation's capital.\" She called for House Speaker Ryan to \"make clear that there is not—and never will be—an invitation for a thug like Putin to address the United States Congress.\"[351] On multiple occasions, Pelosi said of Trump, \"With him, all roads lead to Putin,\" including with regard to the Trump-Ukraine scandal,[352] a lack of action against the alleged Russian bounty program,[353] and Trump's incitement of the January 6 United States Capitol attack.[354] Pelosi supports the Syria Accountability Act and Iran Freedom and Support Act. In a speech at the AIPAC 2005 annual conference, Pelosi said that \"for too long, leaders from both parties haven't done enough\" to put pressure on Russia and China who are providing Iran with technological information on nuclear issues and missiles. \"If evidence of participation by other nations in Iran's nuclear program is discovered, I will insist that the Administration use, rather than ignore, the evidence in determining how the U.S. deals with that nation or nations on other issues.\"[355] In April 2007, Pelosi visited Syria, where she met Foreign Minister Walid Muallem, Vice President Farouk al-Sharaa and President Bashar Al-Assad, despite President Bush efforts to isolate Syria, because of militants crossing from Syria into Iraq, and supporting Hezbollah and Hamas.[356] During her visit, she conveyed Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert message for peace, and toured in Al-Hamidiyah Souq,[357] and the Umayyad Mosque.[358] Pelosi supported the NATO-led military intervention in Libya in 2011.[359] She also favored arming Syria's rebel fighters.[360] In January 2019, Pelosi criticized President Trump's planned withdrawal of U.S. troops from Syria and Afghanistan. She called Trump's announcement a \"Christmas gift to Vladimir Putin\".[361] In an October 2019 letter to Democratic caucus members, Pelosi wrote that both parties were condemning President Trump's deserting the US's \"Kurdish allies in a foolish attempt to appease an authoritarian strongman\" Recep Tayyip Erdoğan of Turkey and opined that the decision \"poses a dire threat to regional security and stability, and sends a dangerous message to Iran and Russia, as well as our allies, that the United States is no longer a trusted partner\".[362] Later that month, she visited Jordan to discuss the Syrian situation with King Abdullah II.[363] Afterwards, she went to Afghanistan, where she met President Ashraf Ghani and chief executive officer Abdullah Abdullah, and she was also briefed by U.S. diplomats on reconciliation efforts with the Taliban.[364] In mid-October 2007, after the House Foreign Affairs Committee passed a resolution to label the 1915 killing of Armenians by Ottoman Turks as genocide, Pelosi pledged to bring the measure to a vote.[365] The draft resolution prompted warnings from President Bush and fierce criticism from Turkey, with Turkey's Prime Minister saying that approval of the resolution would endanger U.S.–Turkey relations.[366] After House support eroded, the measure's sponsors dropped their call for a vote, and in late October Pelosi agreed to set the matter aside.[367] The resolution was passed during Pelosi's second term as Speaker. The House voted 405 to 11 in October 2019 to confirm the resolution.[368] On April 30, 2022, Pelosi met with President Volodymyr Zelenskyy in Kyiv, to pledge U.S. support for Ukraine during the Russian invasion.[369][370] After the drone strikes on aid workers from World Central Kitchen in April 2024, Pelosi, Mark Pocan, James P. McGovern, Jan Schakowsky, and 36 other Congressional Democrats urged President Biden in an open letter to reconsider planned arms shipments to the Israeli military.[371][372] Pelosi has often been described as a polarizing figure, facing criticism from both the political right and left. Progressives have criticized her for her knowledge of waterboarding and other enhanced interrogation techniques during the War on Terror, accusing her of not objecting strongly enough to these practices.[373] Conservatives and libertarians have taken issue with her positions on gun rights, viewing her advocacy for gun control as an infringement on Second Amendment rights.[374] They have also criticized her stance on taxation, particularly her support for higher taxes on the wealthy and corporations to fund social programs.[373] Pelosi's role in leading the House to impeach President Donald Trump twice has drawn significant criticism from Trump supporters and Republicans, who perceived the impeachments as politically motivated and divisive.[373][375] Pelosi has faced allegations of using her position for insider trading, particularly concerning stock transactions that critics claim were influenced by her legislative knowledge.[376] Critics have also depicted her as a symbol of liberal elitism, pointing to her strong opposition to populism and comments suggesting that some Americans reject Democratic policies due to their beliefs about \"guns, gays, [and] God\".[373][377] During the COVID-19 pandemic, Pelosi was accused of hypocrisy when she had her hair styled at a salon that was supposed to be closed for indoor appointments due to health restrictions, with critics alleging she used her position to receive preferential treatment.[378] Pelosi's only close race so far has been in the special election to succeed U.S. Representative Sala Burton after her death in February 1987. Pelosi defeated San Francisco Supervisor Harry Britt in the Democratic primary with 36 percent of the vote to his 32 percent,[15][379] then Republican Harriet Ross by more than 2-to-1.[380] Since then, Pelosi has enjoyed overwhelming support in her political career, collecting 76 and 77 percent of the vote in California's 5th congressional district 1988 and 1990. In 1992, after the redistricting from the 1990 census, Pelosi ran in California's 8th congressional district, which now covered the San Francisco area. She has continued to post landslide victories since, dropping beneath 80 percent of the vote only three times in general elections. After redistricting from the 2010 census, Pelosi ran in California's 12th congressional district, which she represented for the next decade. Due to the 2020 United States redistricting cycle from the 2020 census, Pelosi now represents California's 11th congressional district, which covers San Francisco.[381] Nancy D'Alesandro met Paul Francis Pelosi while she was attending college.[382] They married in Baltimore at the Cathedral of Mary Our Queen on September 7, 1963.[383] They then moved to New York, followed by a move to San Francisco in 1969, where her husband's brother Ronald Pelosi was a member of the City and County of San Francisco's Board of Supervisors.[384] Nancy and Paul Pelosi have five children, including Christine and Alexandra, and nine grandchildren.[385] Alexandra, a journalist, covered the Republican presidential campaigns in 2000 and made a film about the experience, Journeys with George. In 2007, Christine published a book, Campaign Boot Camp: Basic Training for Future Leaders.[386] Pelosi resides in the Pacific Heights neighborhood of San Francisco.[387][388] Her 2016 financial disclosure report lists among her assets a combined home and vineyard in St. Helena, California, two commercial buildings in San Francisco, and a townhouse in Loomis, California.[389] In January 2021, her San Francisco home was vandalized with graffiti, messages of \"[c]ancel rent\" were left on her garage, along with fake blood and a severed pig's head.[390][391] Pelosi's husband, Paul, is a wealthy investor and the primary source of the couple's wealth.[392] In 2009, OpenSecrets estimated Pelosi's net worth at $58 million, making her the 13th-wealthiest member of Congress.[393] In 2014, OpenSecrets reported Pelosi's net worth had almost doubled, to about $101 million, making her the 8th-wealthiest.[394] Business Insider reported that Pelosi's net worth was $26.4 million in 2012 and made her the 13th-richest member of Congress.[395] In 2018, Roll Call estimated Pelosi's net worth at $16.0 million, making her the 30th-wealthiest member.[396] Roll Call said Pelosi's earnings are connected to her husband's heavy investments in stocks that include Apple, Disney, Comcast and Facebook. Roll Call reported that the couple have $13.46 million in liabilities including mortgages on seven properties. According to Roll Call, Pelosi and her husband hold properties \"worth at least $23 million, including a St. Helena vineyard in Napa Valley worth at least $5 million.\"[396] As of 2021, Pelosi's net worth was valued at $120 million, making her the 6th richest person in Congress. According to journalist Glenn Greenwald, the Pelosis have traded $33 million worth of tech stocks over the past two years, including Apple, Amazon, Microsoft, Facebook, and Google stocks.[397] In May and June 2021, Pelosi's husband purchased stocks in tech companies such as Alphabet, Amazon, and Apple, netting a gain of $5.3 million. This occurred even while Speaker Pelosi was working on anti-trust legislation to better regulate the tech industry.[398] The CEO of Apple, Tim Cook, had called Pelosi to lobby her in opposition to the new regulations.[399] Pelosi opposes increasing regulations on stock trades by members of congress, stating that \"we're a free market economy\" and congresspeople \"should be able to participate in that\".[400] This comment drew strong criticism, including from Democrats who favor banning stock trades by members of Congress.[401] Pelosi is a board member of the National Organization of Italian American Women.[402] She served for 13 years as a board member of the National Italian American Foundation (NIAF). In 2007, she received the NIAF Special Achievement Award for Public Advocacy and remains involved in the foundation. Pelosi considers herself a devout Catholic, but she has had numerous disagreements with members of the church hierarchy over gay rights, abortion, contraception, and in vitro fertilization. She has said that her biggest disappointment was the church's lobbying against the Affordable Care Act because of contraception coverage.[22] Pelosi and Catholic bishops have also disagreed about abortion rights. Although she thought it was \"lovely\" that she had five children in a little over six years, she argued that \"It's a woman's right to make her own choices with her family, her God, her doctor.\"[22] On May 20, 2022, Salvatore Cordileone, archbishop of San Francisco, announced that Pelosi would be barred from receiving Holy Communion because of her support of pro-choice abortion policies.[403] Cordileone had communicated his concerns on April 7, 2022, writing, \"should you not publicly repudiate your advocacy for abortion 'rights' or else refrain from referring to your Catholic faith in public and receiving Holy Communion, I would have no choice but to make a declaration, in keeping with Canon 915, that you are not to be admitted to Holy Communion.\"[404] On June 29, 2022, Pelosi received Communion at a Papal Mass presided over by Pope Francis in Rome at St. Peter's Basilica.[405][406] In October 2022, while Pelosi was in Washington, D.C., an intruder entered her San Francisco home demanding to know her whereabouts, and attacked her husband, Paul Pelosi, with a hammer. Police arrested a suspect, 42-year-old David DePape, at the scene. He has been charged federally with attempting to kidnap Nancy Pelosi and assaulting a relative of a federal official, as well as six state charges.[407] In December 2024, Pelosi was hospitalized after sustaining an injury to her hip after a fall on stairs during an official trip to Luxembourg.[408][409][410]",

                "content": "Nancy Pelosi served as the 52nd Speaker of the House of Representatives, having made history in 2007 when she was elected the first woman to serve as Speaker of the House. She made history again in January 2019 when she regained her position second-in-line to the presidency – the first person to do so in more than six decades. Pelosi is the chief architect of generation-defining legislation under two Democratic administrations, including the Affordable Care Act and the American Rescue Plan. She led House Democrats for 20 years and previously served as House Democratic Whip. In 2013, she was inducted into the National Women’s Hall of Fame at a ceremony in Seneca Falls, the birthplace of the American women’s rights movement. In 2024, she was awarded by President Biden the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the nation’s highest civilian honor. Pelosi has represented San Francisco in Congress for 37 years. Currently serving as Speaker Emerita of the House and as the Representative for California’s 11th Congressional District, she is fighting For The People to lower costs, grow paychecks and create jobs. Under the Biden-Harris Administration, Speaker Pelosi led the House in crafting and enacting the American Rescue Plan. This life-saving legislation turned the tide of the pandemic: getting vaccines into hundreds of millions of Americans’ arms, delivering direct assistance to families in need, creating millions of new jobs, supporting teachers, police officers, firefighters, transit workers and other frontline heroes, and returning children safely to schools. Speaker Pelosi also engineered House passage of the bipartisan Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, which is strengthening roads, bridges, ports, water systems and broadband access in communities across the country while rebuilding America’s middle class. Her leadership on the House-passed Build Back Better Act paved the way for the enactment of the Inflation Reduction Act: historic action to bring down the cost of prescription drugs, lower health care premiums, deliver the most consequential climate action in human history and pay down the federal deficit. Pelosi was a key negotiator in assembling the bipartisan and bicameral CHIPS and Science Act, which is powering America to world leader status in semiconductor production and scientific discovery, while building a diverse and inclusive STEM workforce in communities across the country. In the 111th Congress, Speaker Pelosi led the House passage of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act to rescue the nation from the depths of the financial crisis, helping create or save millions of American jobs. Her leadership in enshrining the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act into law helped restore the ability of women to fight pay discrimination in the courts and ensure they too could participate in the economic recovery. Pelosi also led the Congress in enacting the historic Dodd-Frank reforms to rein in big banks and create strong protections for consumers, seniors and Servicemembers. Speaker Pelosi has long been a champion for families’ health care. Pelosi was the architect of the landmark Affordable Care Act, which has guaranteed protections for all Americans with pre-existing medical conditions, forbid insurers from treating being a woman as a pre-existing condition, ended annual and lifetime limits on health coverage, and provided affordable health coverage for tens of millions more Americans. As Democratic Leader in 2017, Pelosi led the charge to defend American families from Republicans’ monstrous “Trumpcare” legislation: mobilizing a massive nationwide campaign in support of the ACA and powering Democrats back into the Majority in 2018. For decades, Pelosi has also been a relentless leader on reducing the costs of prescription drugs by empowering the federal government to negotiate drug prices and capping out-of-pocket costs for seniors: action enshrined into law in the Inflation Reduction Act. Pelosi has made the climate crisis the flagship issue of her Speakership. In 2022, Speaker Pelosi delivered House passage of the Inflation Reduction Act – which contained the biggest, boldest climate action in history. This law included many House-crafted provisions to accelerate America’s transition to a clean energy future: putting the nation on a path to slash carbon pollution by 40 percent by 2030, while creating millions of new jobs and advancing environmental justice. This builds on progress from Pelosi’s first Speakership: in 2007, she enacted comprehensive energy legislation that raised vehicle fuel efficiency standards for the first time in three decades and made a game-changing commitment to America’s homegrown biofuels. In 2009, she led passage of the American Clean Energy and Security Act to create clean energy jobs, combat the climate crisis and transition America to a clean energy economy. A leader on conservation and the environment at home and abroad, Pelosi authored legislation to create the Presidio Trust and transform San Francisco’s former military post into an urban national park. She also secured passage of the “Pelosi Amendment” in 1989, now a global tool used to assess the potential environmental impacts of development. Speaker Pelosi has been a force for accountability, transparency and participation in government. Under her leadership, the House enacted the toughest ethics reform legislation in the history of the Congress – including the creation of an independent ethics panel. Pelosi also led an historic legislative campaign for voting rights, passing two once-in-a-generation pieces of legislation. The For The People Act would expand access to the ballot, clean up corruption in government, outlaw partisan gerrymandering and combat dark money in politics, and the John R. Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act would restore the federal government’s power to defend access to the ballot across the country. Speaker Pelosi is a steadfast defender of the Constitution and the rule of law. In 2019, after President Trump violated his oath of office by soliciting foreign intervention in the upcoming presidential election and withholding Congressionally appropriated assistance to Ukraine, the Democratic House launched an investigation that resulted in the third presidential impeachment in history. In 2021, after President Trump incited a violent insurrection targeting the U.S. Capitol and sought to overturn the results of the election, the House impeached Trump a second time. Speaker Pelosi then led the House in creating the bipartisan Select Committee to Investigate the January 6th Attack on the United States Capitol. Pelosi has been a staunch champion of America’s national security and a respected voice abroad in promoting democratic values. She is the longest-serving Member of the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence in history: serving from 1993-2003, including as Ranking Member from 2000-2003, and continues to serve in an ex officio capacity. As Speaker, she marshaled billions of dollars in security, economic and humanitarian assistance for the people of Ukraine after Russia’s unlawful invasion in February 2022. She orchestrated an overwhelmingly bipartisan and bicameral effort to impose swift and severe consequences on Russia, including a ban on the import of Russian energy and the revocation of normal trade relations. For decades, Pelosi has offered a powerful voice for human rights around the world – especially speaking out on behalf of Uyghur communities, the citizens of Hong Kong, the Tibetan people and all those oppressed by the government of China. In 2022, she became the first House Speaker and highest-ranking U.S. official to travel to Taiwan in a quarter-century: an historic visit that reaffirmed America’s unwavering support for the people of Taiwan. As Democratic Leader, she helped strengthen America’s security by securing the votes needed to defeat Republicans’ effort to disapprove of President Obama’s Iran Nuclear Agreement, a landmark policy that halted Iran’s progress toward a nuclear weapon. Speaker Pelosi has long been a leader in the fight for full equality. She spearheaded the historic repeal of the discriminatory “Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell” policy, allowing gay and lesbian Americans to openly serve their country. She passed the Matthew Shepard and James Byrd, Jr. Hate Crimes Prevention Act, a law advancing justice for the millions of Americans at risk of violence for being who they are. As Speaker, she twice passed the watershed Equality Act: ensuring justice for the LGBTQ community in the workplace and in every place. Pelosi also led the charge to fight back against the Trump Administration’s hateful ban on transgender Servicemembers. While serving as Democratic Leader, Pelosi’s strength at the negotiating table wrested critical legislative victories out of the GOP majority. In the 114th Congress, she achieved an historic bipartisan agreement to strengthen Medicare: ending the cycle of expensive “Doc Fix” patches and building a system that improves accuracy of payments and quality of care. She also delivered significant funding increases for key Democratic priorities, including the fight against the opioid epidemic, support for NIH medical research and permanent authorization of the World Trade Center Health Program. Negotiating directly with the Trump Administration, Speaker Pelosi was crucial to securing vital relief for families and small businesses in early COVID-19 pandemic relief laws. Additional key accomplishments signed into law during her four terms as Speaker include: landmark gun violence prevention measures; legislation to expand educational opportunities while reforming the financial aid system; legislation to provide health care for eleven million American children; new protections against hate crimes; an increase in the minimum wage for the first time in a decade; the largest college aid expansion since the GI bill; new funding to address PFAS forever chemicals; a new GI education bill for veterans of the Iraq and Afghanistan wars; and increased services for veterans, caregivers and the Veterans Administration. With Speaker Pelosi at the helm, the House also advanced important legislation to ensure equal pay for equal work; save lives through a reinstatement of the Assault Weapons Ban and mandatory background checks for gun purchases; protect pregnant workers against discrimination; reform America’s broken immigration system and secure justice for Dreamers and farmworkers; care for veterans exposed to toxic chemicals in the line of duty; and protect borrowers from unfair lending practices. Pelosi comes from a strong family tradition of public service. Her late father, Thomas D’Alesandro Jr., served as Mayor of Baltimore for twelve years, after representing the city for five terms in Congress. Her brother, Thomas D’Alesandro III, also served as Mayor of Baltimore. She graduated from Trinity College in Washington, D.C. She and her husband, Paul Pelosi, a native of San Francisco, have five grown children and ten grandchildren.",

                "title": "Nancy Pelosi | Biography, Book, Age, & Facts | Britannica",
                "content": "Our editors will review what you’ve submitted and determine whether to revise the article. Nancy Pelosi (born March 26, 1940, Baltimore, Maryland, U.S.) is an American Democratic politician who represents California in the U.S. House of Representatives (1987– ), where she served as the first female speaker (2007–11 and 2019–23). Her other notable posts have included House minority leader (2003–07 and 2011–19). During her career, Pelosi developed a reputation as a highly skillful legislator and is considered one of the most effective speakers in the history of the House. Nancy D’Alesandro—whose father, Thomas D’Alesandro, Jr., was a politician and New Deal Democrat—studied political science at Trinity College in Washington, D.C., graduating with a bachelor’s degree in 1962. The following year she married Paul Pelosi, and the couple moved to New York. Five children and six years later, the family settled in San Francisco, where Nancy Pelosi worked as a volunteer Democratic organizer. Earning a reputation as a highly effective fund-raiser, she rose through the ranks, serving on the Democratic National Committee and as chair of both the California Democratic Party (1981–83) and the host committee for the 1984 Democratic National Convention in San Francisco. Along the way, Pelosi befriended longtime U.S. Rep. Phil Burton. Burton died in 1983 and was succeeded by his wife, Sala, who, shortly before her death in 1987, urged Pelosi to run for the seat. She narrowly won a special election and was reelected in 1988 to a full term. Pelosi easily won subsequent elections in her overwhelmingly Democratic district. Pelosi developed a reputation as a shrewd politician, and she steadily rose within the party, becoming minority whip in 2002. Later that year she was elected minority leader, and, when she took office in 2003, she became the first woman to lead a party in Congress. Using what she referred to as her “mother of five” voice, Pelosi began pushing for unity among the diverse factions within her party by embracing conservatives and moderates. Still, Pelosi continued to vote consistently in favor of such liberal causes as gun control and abortion rights, opposed welfare reform, and cast a vote against the Iraq War. Her criticism of Pres. George W. Bush could be harsh; she once characterized him as an “incompetent leader.” Her critics in turn claimed that her “left coast,” left-wing politics put her out of touch with most of the country. Following the midterm elections in November 2006, the Democrats gained a majority in the House of Representatives. On January 4, 2007, Pelosi was elected speaker of the House of the 110th Congress. After Democrat Barack Obama assumed the presidency in 2009, Pelosi was a vocal supporter of many of his policies, helping to shepherd through Congress his $787 billion stimulus package in February 2009 and playing an instrumental role in the more-than-yearlong effort to secure health care reform, which ultimately passed in March 2010. The historic bill extended health care to some 30 million previously uninsured Americans and prohibited insurers from denying coverage to those with preexisting conditions. Pelosi’s popularity declined, however, as the economy continued to struggle and as opposition to legislation she had championed—notably health care reform and the stimulus package—increased. In the lead-up to the 2010 midterm elections, she became a target of Republican attacks and a rallying point for Tea Partiers, who were keen to turn the elections into a referendum on the Democratic agenda. The Democrats fared poorly in the November elections and lost control of the House. Despite calls for new party leadership, Pelosi was elected to serve as minority leader in the next Congress. She continued in that post as Democrats failed to regain control of the House in several subsequent elections. Their lackluster electoral performance, especially with working-class voters, led to unrest among House Democrats, and, after Republican Donald Trump was elected president in 2016, Tim Ryan from Ohio challenged Pelosi for minority leader. Pelosi ultimately prevailed. The 2018 midterm elections saw a massive resurgence for the Democrats as they regained control of the House. As calls continued for leadership changes, Pelosi made various concessions, notably accepting term limits, and in January 2019 she was officially elected speaker, becoming the first person in more than 60 years to serve nonconsecutive terms in the post. Pelosi’s political skills were also on display as she dealt with a government shutdown that had begun in late December. At issue was funding for a border wall, one of Trump’s key campaign pledges. Pelosi united her party in opposition to the president, who vowed to keep the government closed until he received billions for the proposed wall. Citing security concerns, Pelosi refused to allow Trump to hold the annual State of the Union address in the House chambers while the government was closed. In late January Trump finally agreed to end the shutdown, which was the longest to date, even though he had failed to secure the necessary funding. Pelosi drew particular praise for her handling of the situation. During this time Pelosi faced calls from within her party to launch impeachment proceedings against Trump. These escalated in March 2019 when special counsel Robert Mueller concluded his investigation into allegations of Russian interference in the 2016 election. Although Mueller reached no legal conclusions, critics of Trump believed that the findings supported impeachment, while the president’s supporters claimed that he had been exonerated. Pelosi was initially reluctant to move on impeachment, but in September 2019 it was publicly revealed that a whistleblower had filed a complaint alleging that Trump had withheld aid to Ukraine in order to pressure the country into opening a corruption investigation into Joe Biden, a political rival. Later that month Pelosi opened a formal impeachment inquiry in the House. The investigation concluded in early December 2019, and several weeks later the House voted to impeach the president. However, Pelosi delayed sending the articles of impeachment to the Senate until January. The move was seen as an attempt to secure certain conditions for the Senate trial, and its effect was debated. In February 2020 the Senate acquitted Trump. During this time the coronavirus was spreading around the world, eventually becoming a pandemic. In March 2020, as deaths in the United States began to mount, businesses and schools started to close, and the economy entered an economic downturn that soon rivaled the Great Depression. That month Pelosi helped secure the passage of a $2 trillion relief package, the largest stimulus bill in U.S. history. As the pandemic worsened in the country, she blamed the president—going so far as to call it the “Trump virus”—alleging that he had mishandled the government response. In the 2020 election Trump was defeated by Biden, the Democratic presidential candidate, and the Democrats maintained a slim majority in the House. Pelosi was elected to another term as speaker in 2021. During this time Trump contested the results of the presidential election, repeatedly alleging voter fraud despite the lack of evidence to support his claims. On January 6, 2021, his supporters stormed the Capitol as Congress was in the process of certifying Biden’s victory. Many accused Trump of encouraging the attack, and Pelosi demanded his removal from office. To that end, she oversaw passage of a House resolution that called on Vice Pres. Mike Pence to invoke the Twenty-fifth Amendment. After he refused, Pelosi launched impeachment proceedings, charging Trump with “incitement of insurrection.” The House voted to impeach Trump on January 13, 2021, a week before the end of his term. However, the Senate subsequently acquitted him. After the majority of Senate Republicans, led by Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, blocked the formation of a bipartisan independent commission to investigate the Capitol attack, Pelosi oversaw the formation of the House’s Select Committee to Investigate the January 6th Attack on the United States Capitol. When Pelosi refused to seat two of Republican House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy’s five nominees for the committee—Representatives Jim Banks and Jim Jordan—because, she argued, they were too closely involved with Trump to participate credibly, McCarthy withdrew all five nominations. In their places Pelosi appointed Republicans Liz Cheney and Adam Kinzinger, who joined the seven Democrats on the committee, which began its investigation in July 2021. In the meantime, Pelosi shepherded House passage of a massive bill aimed at restoring and improving U.S. infrastructure despite the Senate’s failure to approve the Build Back Better Act. Pelosi had originally refused to allow the House vote on the infrastructure bill until after Senate passage of Biden’s ambitious plan for expanding the country’s social safety net and combating climate change. In August 2022 Pelosi became the highest-ranking elected U.S. official to visit Taiwan in some 25 years. The controversial visit by Pelosi, a longtime critic of the Chinese government, heightened tensions between the U.S. and China, which considers the self-ruling island to be its territory and viewed the presence of a U.S. official of the speaker’s stature as provocatively enhancing the international standing of Taiwan’s government. Following the November 2022 midterm elections, in which the Democratic Party narrowly lost control of the House to the Republicans, Pelosi announced that she would step down as leader of the House Democrats but would remain a member of Congress. In January Hakeem Jeffries succeeded her. However, Pelosi remained a hugely influential figure within Congress and the Democratic Party. In June 2024 concerns arose over the viability of Biden’s reelection campaign following a disastrous debate against the Republican nominee, Trump. Pelosi reportedly pushed to have Biden leave the race, which he did in July. Almost immediately thereafter, she endorsed Vice President Kamala Harris as the Democratic nominee, and Harris ultimately was named the party’s candidate. In 2024 Pelosi won reelection against Republican challenger Bruce Lou. Pelosi is the recipient of numerous honors, including the Profile in Courage Award (2019) and the Presidential Medal of Freedom (2024). She also wrote the books Know Your Power: A Message to America’s Daughters (2008) and The Art of Power: My Story as America’s First Woman Speaker of the House (2024).",

                "content": "Nancy Pelosi is the Democratic Leader of the U.S. House of Representatives for the 115th Congress. From 2007 to 2011, Pelosi served as Speaker of the House, the first woman to do so in American history. As the Democratic Leader, Pelosi is fighting for bigger paychecks and better infrastructure for America’s middle class families. In 2013, she was inducted into the National Women’s Hall of Fame at a ceremony in Seneca Falls, the birthplace of the American women’s rights movement. For 30 years, Leader Pelosi has represented San Francisco, California’s 12th District, in Congress. She has led House Democrats for more than 12 years and previously served as House Democratic Whip. Under the leadership of Pelosi, the 111th Congress was heralded as “one of the most productive Congresses in history” by Congressional scholar Norman Ornstein. President Barack Obama called Speaker Pelosi “an extraordinary leader for the American people,” and the Christian Science Monitor wrote: “…make no mistake: Nancy Pelosi is the most powerful woman in American politics and the most powerful House Speaker since Sam Rayburn a half century ago.” Working in partnership with President Obama, Speaker Pelosi led House passage of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act in early 2009 to create and save millions of American jobs, provide relief for American families, and provide a tax cut to 95 percent of working Americans. With the House Democratic Caucus, Pelosi continues to focus on the need to create jobs in America and prevent them from being shipped overseas. Speaker Pelosi achieved passage of historic health insurance reform legislation in the House which establishes a Patients’ Bill of Rights and will provide insurance for tens of millions more Americans while lowering health care costs over the long term. The new law provides patients with affordable insurance choices, curbs abuses by the insurance industry, strengthens Medicare, and reduces the deficit by more than $100 billion over the next 10 years. In the 111th Congress, Speaker Pelosi also led the Congress in passing strong Wall Street reforms to rein in big banks and protect consumers as well as the Student Aid and Fiscal Responsibility Act, which expands educational opportunities and reforms the financial aid system to save billions of taxpayers’ dollars. Additional key legislation passed into law included the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act to restore the ability of women and all workers to access our judicial system to fight pay discrimination; legislation to provide health care for 11 million American children; national service legislation; and hate crimes legislation. In late 2010, Pelosi led the Congress in passing child nutrition and food safety legislation as well as repealing the discriminatory “Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell” policy, which prohibited gays and lesbians from serving openly in the military. Pelosi has made energy security her flagship issue, enacting comprehensive energy legislation in 2007 that raised vehicle fuel efficiency standards for the first time in 32 years and making an historic commitment to American home grown biofuels. In 2009, under her leadership, the House passed the landmark American Clean Energy and Security Act – a comprehensive bill to create clean energy jobs, combat climate change, and transition America to a clean energy economy. The legislation was blocked by Republicans in the United States Senate, but sent a strong signal to the world about the United States’ commitment to fighting the climate crisis. A leader on the environment at home and abroad, Pelosi secured passage of the “Pelosi amendment” in 1989, now a global tool to assess the potential environmental impacts of development. In San Francisco, Pelosi was the architect of legislation to create the Presidio Trust and transform the former military post into an urban national park. In continuing to push for accountability and transparency in government, under Speaker Pelosi, the House passed the toughest ethics reform legislation in the history of the Congress, including the creation of an independent ethics panel, and increased accountability and transparency in House operations, including earmark reforms. As Speaker, Pelosi led the fight to pass the DISCLOSE Act in the House, which fights a corporate takeover of U.S. elections and ensures additional disclosure; she continues to fight for this legislation today. Additional key accomplishments signed into law under the leadership of Speaker Pelosi include: an increase in the minimum wage for the first time in 10 years; the largest college aid expansion since the GI bill; a new GI education bill for veterans of the Iraq and Afghanistan wars; and increased services for veterans, caregivers, and the Veterans Administration. Pelosi comes from a strong family tradition of public service. Her late father, Thomas D’Alesandro Jr., served as Mayor of Baltimore for 12 years, after representing the city for five terms in Congress. Her brother, Thomas D’Alesandro III, also served as Mayor of Baltimore. She graduated from Trinity College in Washington, D.C. She and her husband, Paul Pelosi, a native of San Francisco, have five grown children and nine grandchildren.",

                "content": "Nestor Cortés Jr. (born December 10, 1994), nicknamed \"Nasty Nestor\" and \"the Hialeah Kid\",[1] is a Cuban-American professional baseball pitcher for the Milwaukee Brewers of Major League Baseball (MLB). He has previously played in MLB for the New York Yankees, Baltimore Orioles, and Seattle Mariners. The Yankees selected Cortés in the 36th round of the 2013 MLB draft. Taken by the Orioles in the Rule 5 draft after the 2017 season, he made his MLB debut with them in 2018 before returning to the Yankees. Cortés pitched for the Yankees in 2019 and the Mariners in 2020, rejoining the Yankees in 2021 and establishing himself in their starting rotation. Cortés was an MLB All-Star in 2022. Cortés was born in Surgidero de Batabanó, Cuba. When he was seven months old, his father, Nestor Cortés Sr., won the visa lottery, and they relocated to the United States in the city of Hialeah, Florida.[2] His father had been sentenced to one year in prison after a failed attempt to defect from Cuba in 1992. Nestor Sr. met his wife, Yuslaidy, the following year.[3] Nestor Sr. drove a forklift and his mother worked as a manicurist.[4] Cortés started playing baseball at the age of four.[2] His father took him to see the Florida Marlins of Major League Baseball (MLB) play at Pro Player Stadium in Miami Gardens.[3] Cortés attended Hialeah High School in Hialeah, Florida. He committed to play college baseball at Florida International University.[5] The New York Yankees selected Cortés in the 36th round of the 2013 MLB draft. He signed with the Yankees, receiving an $85,000 signing bonus,[4] and made his professional debut that year with the Gulf Coast Yankees of the Rookie-level Gulf Coast League, where he had a 0–1 win–loss record with a 4.42 earned run average (ERA) in 18+1⁄3 innings pitched. He returned there in 2014, going 1–2 with a 2.27 ERA in 11 games (two starts). Cortés spent 2015 with the Pulaski Yankees of the Rookie-level Appalachian League, where he compiled a 6–3 record with a 2.26 ERA in 12 games (ten starts). In 2016, he pitched for the Charleston RiverDogs of the Single–A South Atlantic League, Tampa Yankees of the High–A Florida State League, Trenton Thunder of the Double–A Eastern League, and the Scranton/Wilkes-Barre RailRiders of the Triple–A International League, pitching to a combined 11–4 record with a 1.53 ERA in 21 games (12 starts). Cortés played 2017 with Tampa, Trenton, and the RailRiders.[6] He finished the season with a 2.06 ERA between the three levels.[7] The Baltimore Orioles selected Cortés from the Yankees organization in the 2017 Rule 5 draft.[8] During spring training with the Orioles, Cortés competed for a spot on the Orioles' Opening Day roster as either a starting pitcher or relief pitcher.[9][10][11] Cortés made the Orioles' Opening Day roster in 2018 as a relief pitcher,[12] and made his major league debut on March 31.[13] Cortés allowed a grand slam to Josh Reddick on April 3, and then a walk with the bases loaded to Curtis Granderson followed by a grand slam by Josh Donaldson on April 9.[14] The Orioles designated Cortés for assignment the next day.[15] He had allowed four runs on ten hits, including two home runs, in four games pitched.[7] On April 13, 2018, the Orioles returned Cortés to the Yankees.[16] He played in one game for Trenton before returning to Scranton/Wilkes-Barre, combining for a 6–6 record and a lukewarm 3.68 ERA in 24 games.[17] After the regular season, Cortés played for the Estrellas Orientales of the Dominican Professional Baseball League, where he learned how to throw a cut fastball.[18] The Yankees invited Cortés to spring training as a non-roster player in 2019.[19] He did not make the team and was assigned to Scranton/Wilkes-Barre. The Yankees promoted him to the major leagues on May 9. On June 15, he earned his first major league win, striking out seven batters, and allowing two earned runs in five innings.[20] The Yankees optioned him to Triple-A with Aaron Judge coming off the injured list on June 21;[21] he was promoted to the major league roster on June 23 when Cameron Maybin went on the injured list.[22] He was 5–1 with an ERA of 5.67 in 33 games.[23] On November 25, 2019, the Yankees traded Cortés to the Seattle Mariners in exchange for $28,300 of international bonus pool money.[7][24] He hurt his elbow in August, ending up on the injured list.[25] Working at the Mariners' alternate training site, a coach helped him to change the grip of his fastball, which helped him to add backspin to the pitch.[7] In 2020, Cortés gave up 13 runs over 7+2⁄3 innings pitched for the Mariners. On October 22, 2020, Cortés was outrighted off of the 40-man roster after he was activated from the 60-day injured list, and elected free agency.[26] On December 20, 2020, Cortés signed a minor league contract to return to the New York Yankees organization.[27] Cortés began the 2021 season with the RailRiders, and the Yankees promoted him to the major leagues on May 30.[28] Throughout the 2021 season, Cortés became a favorite of Yankees fans, as his signature mustache, along with his unique style of pitching and many productive appearances garnered him much praise, along with the moniker \"Nasty Nestor.\"[29] He finished the year with 93 innings pitched over 22 games (14 started) to go along with a 2.90 ERA and 103 strikeouts.[23] Cortés began the 2022 season in the Yankees starting rotation.[30] Cortés threw an immaculate inning against the Orioles on April 16.[31] Against the Texas Rangers on May 9, Cortés pitched 7+1⁄3 innings before allowing his first hit.[32] He was selected for the 2022 All-Star Game, where he registered two strikeouts, a hit by pitch, and a walk in 1 inning pitched.[33] He finished the regular season with a 12-4 record and a 2.44 ERA in 158+1⁄3 innings pitched in 28 games started.[34] In November 2022, Cortés announced his intention to represent the United States national baseball team in the 2023 World Baseball Classic, held in March 2023.[35] He withdrew from the tournament due to a hamstring injury.[36] Cortes began the 2023 season out of the Yankees' rotation, posting a 5.16 ERA across 11 starts. On June 8, 2023, he was placed on the injured list with a left rotator cuff strain.[37] He was transferred to the 60-day injured list on July 7.[38] Cortes was activated on August 5.[39] He made one start and returned to the injured list on August 11 due to the rotator cuff strain.[40] He was transferred to the 60–day injured list on September 12, officially ending his season, as the Yankees missed the postseason for the first time since 2016. In 12 starts, he logged a 5–2 record and a 4.97 ERA with 67 strikeouts in 63+1⁄3 innings pitched.[41] With Gerrit Cole beginning the 2024 season on the injured list, the Yankees chose Cortes as their starting pitcher for Opening Day.[42] Cortes was 9-10 with a 3.77 ERA in 31 games (30 starts) for the 2024 season, ranking second on the team in innings (174+1⁄3) and third in strikeouts (162). Cortes was sidelined to begin the Yankees' 2024 postseason run due to a left elbow flexor strain suffered on September 18. He was readded to the 26-man roster for the 2024 World Series. In the bottom of the 10th inning of Game 1, Cortes allowed a walk-off grand slam to Freddie Freeman, becoming the first pitcher in World Series history to do so.[43] On December 13, 2024, the Yankees traded Cortés and Caleb Durbin to the Milwaukee Brewers for Devin Williams.[44] Cortés throws a four-seam fastball that averages approximately 91 miles per hour (146 km/h). He also throws a cutter, slider, changeup, and a curveball.[45][46] His curveball has been registered as slow as 47 miles per hour (76 km/h).[6] Cortés hides the ball well in his wind-up, which helps to alleviate the problems presented by his shorter frame. When throwing a slider or curveball, his arm angle is slightly lower than his four-seam fastball.[citation needed] Cortés also employs trickery in his wind-up to throw hitters off. He sometimes varies his step timing and sometimes pauses and rocks back and forth in the middle of his wind-up, and occasionally abbreviates his wind-up and releases the ball quickly.[47] Cortés and his girlfriend, Alondra Esteras Russy, became engaged after the 2022 All-Star Game.[48] They married in November 2023.[49] Cortés is a fan of horse racing, attending races at the Hialeah Park Race Track when he was young. He partnered with an equipment manager of the Yankees to purchase a harness racing horse in 2023.[50]",

                "content": "By Richard Tovar Updated on December 13, 2024 10:24PM EDT Updated on December 13, 2024 10:24PM EDT By Richard Tovar Nestor Cortes’ time with the New York Yankees has officially come to an end. After a rough start to his career, the Cuban pitcher eventually became a key figure for the Bombers. However, in a trade to acquire Devin Williams from the Milwaukee Brewers, Cortes’ run in New York is now over. Williams joins the Yankees with the expectation of competing for the closer role alongside Luke Weaver, as GM Brian Cashman recently confirmed. Cortes heads to Milwaukee along with another player, and it’s expected the Yankees will also send some cash as part of the deal. Cortes’ journey with the Yankees began in 2019, with a brief detour to Seattle in 2020, before returning in 2021. Over his tenure, he appeared in 126 MLB games for the franchise, both as a reliever and starter. While Williams, at 30, is not far behind Cortes in age, the two have vastly different postseason experiences. Cortes has been a fixture in the postseason since his debut in 2018, while Williams has only made one appearance in the playoffs. LOS ANGELES, CALIFORNIA – OCTOBER 25: Nestor Cortes #65 of the New York Yankees leaves the field after giving up a walk-off grand slam to Freddie Freeman #5 of the Los Angeles Dodgers in the tenth inning during Game One of the 2024 World Series at Dodger Stadium on October 25, 2024 in Los Angeles, California. (Photo by Maddie Meyer/Getty Images) According to Spotrac, Cortes earned $3.9 million in the 2024 season. He had been signing one-year deals with the Yankees since 2021. Over the course of his six years with the team, he earned a total of $8,627,990. While nothing is official yet, Spotrac estimates Cortes could make around $8.3 million on a one-year deal with the Brewers. His signing bonus is still unknown, but his last bonus with the Yankees was $85,000.

                "content": "Look up! The Geminds could put on quite the show tonight despite the bright moon. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here’s how it works. The Geminid meteor shower, one of the most prolific meteor showers of the year peaks tonight, Dec. 13. Famed for its bright, vividly colored meteors, the Geminids promise a spectacle as Earth passes through the debris left behind by asteroid 3200 Phaethon. Under optimal conditions, the Geminids can produce up to 120 meteors per hour, but this year's near full-moon will likely wash out fainter meteors, reducing visibility. Still, if you have clear skies, it's worth braving the chill for a glimpse of this celestial treat. While moonlight may hinder some meteor spotting efforts, brighter meteors and the occassional fireball can blaze so bright they'll still be visible. Geminid meteors will appear to radiate from the Gemini constellation but don't look directly at Gemini to spot the meteors, as the shooting stars will be visible across the night sky. Make sure to move your gaze around the nearby constellations as meteors closer to the radiant tend to have shorter trains and are more difficult to spot. Peak Geminid activity typically occurs in the late evening and into the early morning hours, with the best viewing time around 2 a.m. local time when the Gemini constellation, the shower's radiant, is at its highest point in the sky. You can also watch the Geminid meteor shower live online from the comfort of your own home courtesy of Astronomer Gianluca Masi of the Virtual Telescope Project. The livestream is scheduled to start at 6:00 p.m. EST (2300 GMT) on Dec. 13, weather permitting. Keep up to date with what you can see tonight with our night sky live blog. You don't need any special equipment to see meteors. Make sure you dress warmly, bring blankets and perhaps a thermos of hot chocolate to make the experience all the most cozy.

The Geminid meteor shower peaks tonight (Dec. 13) but if you're unable to catch the prolific shower in person, you can still enjoy this spectacular event from the comfort of your home. Astronomer Gianluca Masi of the Virtual Telescope Project is offering a free livestream of the Geminid meteor shower on Dec. 13, starting at 6:00 p.m. EST (2300 GMT), weather permitting. You can watch all the action unfold here on Space.com courtesy of the Virtual Telescope Project, or directly on their WebTV page or YouTube channel. Unfortunately this year, the bright near-full moon will wash out the fainter meteors, but we can still expect some impressive Geminids. \"While this shower offers at its peak 100 meteors per hour under dark skies, this time we can likely expect 15 shooting stars per hour,\" according to Masi. \"We will set up a special, very large field of view equipment in Manciano, under the darkest skies of Italy and will share the brightest meteors in real-time!\" Masi continued. Night sky live Keep up to date with what you can see tonight with our night sky live blog. The Geminid meteor shower is famed for being one of the brightest and most reliable meteor shower events of the year. From the Virtual Telescope Project livestream from Manciano Italy, the dark skies will give observers the best chance of catching a glimpse of an impressive Geminid, regardless of the bright moon. Geminds are unusual because unlike other meteor showers that result from debris left over from comets, they are created by bits of near-Earth object 3200 Phaethon, an asteroid that may have undergone a collision with another object in the distant past to create a stream of debris. The strange asteroid behaves like a comet and orbits the sun every 1.4 years. When Earth passes through the debris left behind by Phaethon the \"asteroid crumbs\" heat up as they enter Earth's atmosphere and burn up in bright bursts of light.

Here are some of the best-known meteor showers, when, and where to see them—followed by more details about each. Plus, meteor shower watching tips. Good luck—and be sure to share your experiences and any photos in the comments section! Jump to meteor shower watching tips Meteor shower season begins in the spring and ends in the winter. When gardens and wildlife wake up from winter’s sleep it’s as if the shooting stars do too—decorating the night with bright streaks! From the Lyrids to the Perseids, Geminids to the Quadrantids, each meteor shower has its own special charm. As the year goes on, these showers come and go, their brightness increasing and decreasing. By the time January comes, the sky quiets down, and the major meteor showers seem to take a break. This cycle is reminiscent of the old Roman calendar and the zodiac signs, which begin in spring. Just as the Earth starts fresh with the spring equinox, so does the cycle of shooting stars, mirroring the cycle of life through the four seasons. Speaking of four seasons … Find out what the weather will be like all year! This chart lists the most well-known meteor showers as well as the Farmers’ Almanac recommendations for your best chances of catching a shooting star, based on predictions of each shower’s period of peak activity. February and March usually don’t have big meteor showers like the ones in other months. But you might still spot meteors on any night. It only takes clear skies and a little bit of luck! These meteors, which people often call “random” meteors, don’t belong to any specific meteor shower and may be seen all year-round. Speaking of luck … Why is wishing on a shooting star believed to be good luck? Find out! Here are more details about each of the meteor showers listed above, including your probability of seeing shooting stars based on the phase of the Moon during each period of peak activity. We highly recommend: The Perseids (August), Geminids (December), and Quadrantids (January). Named after the Lyra constellation, the Lyrid Meteor Shower will light up the sky from April 14 to 25, with the best viewing on the early morning of April 22. Look east and overhead between 2 and 4 a.m. local time. This shower comes from the area near the bright star Vega, which makes it easier to spot, even if you’re not sure where Lyra is. Related: Learn more about Vega and the 10 Brightest Stars If you happen to see a meteor during this time, it most likely will be dust from Comet Thatcher. These meteors light up as bright lines when they hit Earth’s atmosphere at really fast speeds (110,000 miles per hour). The Lyrids have been watched for over 2,000 years and usually show about 10 to 20 meteors per hour. Sometimes, like in 1982, there can be a lot more—up to 90 meteors in an hour. 2024 Observation Note: The full Moon might make it a bit harder to see shooting stars. Still, 10 to 15 meteors per hour may be visible if the weather conditions are perfect. Catch a meteor this morning, when one of the year’s principal meteor showers—the Eta Aquarids—is due to reach its peak! Look southeast between 2 to 4 a.m. local time. While the Eta Aquarids may not dazzle you with impressive numbers, this shower has one significant claim to fame: its particles come from the most famous of all comets: Halley’s comet! Their radiant is just a few degrees from the intersection of Aquarius, Pegasus, and Pisces. Average rates tend to be about 5 to 20 per hour in the Northern Hemisphere and 60 or more per hour in the Southern Hemisphere. But do think of the Eta Aquarids as interplanetary postcards from the reigning king of comets, currently coasting out beyond the orbit of Neptune. 2024 Observation Note: Light from a waning crescent Moon in that part of the sky poses only a minor hindrance to spotting the faintest meteors. Shower activity will become noticeable once the radiant clears the eastern horizon at about 2:30 a.m. local daylight time. That’s when a bright Eta Aquarid may skim overhead, creating a long, dramatic “Earth-grazer.” Several weak, long lasting meteor showers that primarily emanate from out of the southern part of the sky are active from mid-July through August. The best is the Delta Aquarid shower, due to peak during the predawn hours of July 29. From midnight until the first light of dawn, you can normally expect to see about 10 to 20 moderately swift meteors emanating from out of the southern part of the sky. (We recommend looking between 1 to 3 a.m.) 2024 Observation Note: This year, the chances of seeing a meteor during this time may not be optimal based on the presence of the Moon, just past last quarter phase, that will rise soon after midnight. Related: Moon Phase Calendar Return to Top Get set for one of the best sky events of the year! The Perseid Meteor Shower begins on July 25 and ends on August 18, but it is going to be at its best at around 11 p.m. on August 11 until dawn on August 12. (We recommend 1 to 3 a.m. on August 12.) Related: Top Sky Events 2024 This yearly shower is famous for putting on a great show, usually sending 45 to 90 meteors across the sky every hour when it’s at its peak. If the sky is really dark, you might even see more! Do you live in a big city? One of the best things about The Perseids is that they are bright meteors that break up and leave long, glowing trails, which can still be seen even where there are city lights. 2024 Observation Note: The last quarter Moon will set around 11 p.m., leaving the sky nice and dark for the shooting stars to shine through! This year’s Orionid meteor shower is expected to peak early on the morning of October 21. Look south from 2 to 4 a.m. Under ideal conditions, you may be able to see up to 20 swift meteors might be seen per hour. The meteors of this annual display have paths that appear to radiate from a spot between Gemini and Orion. A few Orionids may actually appear as early as the start of October and as late as November 7 or so. 2024 Observation Note: Unfortunately, the Moon is in a bright waning gibbous phase nearby Taurus, and its glare will very likely spoil the view this year. Psst … did you know that the best time to stargaze is during a New Moon? Learn why! November provides two great opportunities for meteor watching. November 5, 2024 marks the peak of the Taurid Meteor Shower, which is known for its slow and bright meteors with impressive fireballs, radiating from the Taurus constellation. What’s great about the Taurids is that they are one of the few meteor showers that may be observed in the evening! This makes seeing shooting stars tonight much easier for kids (and people who don’t want to stay up or wake up at 3 a.m.). 2024 Observation Note: About a dozen shower meteors per hour may be visible under dark skies after a waxing crescent moon sets in the early evening. Optimal time for viewing begins around 11 p.m on November 4, 2025, when the Taurus constellation is directly overhead. We recommend looking south on November 5 from 1 to 3 a.m. for best results. The Taurids, specifically the Southern Taurids, are debris from Comet Encke. Although not the most abundant shower, their bright meteors make them worth observing from anywhere on Earth. You won’t need any special equipment—just look up. Swift meteors of the Leonid swarm will streak away from the Sickle of Leo during the latter part of November, but probably in reduced numbers for most observers. The comet (55P/Tempel-Tuttle) that produces spectacular meteor displays at roughly 33-year intervals arrived at aphelion, beyond the orbit of Uranus in 2014, and as a result the Leonids have been weak in recent years. The maximum of this year’s display occurs this morning, when about 20 meteors per hour are predicted under ideal conditions. 2024 Observation Note: Unfortunately, your chances of spotting a meteor this morning may be ruined by a bright waning gibbous Moon in Taurus brightening the predawn skies. Look east about one hour before the break of dawn (approximately 4 to 5 a.m.) when the constellation Leo will be high in the eastern sky. The Leonids are known for leaving visible trains. The Geminid Meteor Shower, due to peak during the overnight hours of December 13-14, can produce as many as 60 to 120 slow, graceful meteors per hour under ideal conditions. They tend to be bright and appear yellow and have a reputation for occasional fireballs. Rates increase steadily for several days before maximum, then drop off quickly. The meteors that appear after maximum, however, tend to be especially bright. Remember to dress warmly for the cold December night and perhaps bring along a warm drink to enhance your stargazing experience. The Geminids provide one of the best meteor viewing opportunities, not just for their quantity and brilliance, but also because they’re visible before midnight, making them accessible to many. With the Geminids stemming from an asteroid rather than a comet, they offer a unique twist on the typical meteor shower narrative. Don’t miss out on this cosmic event that promises to enchant anyone willing to gaze up at the vast night sky. 2024 Observation Note: Despite the near-full Moon’s presence, the intensity and brightness of the Geminids ensure a spectacular show, with vivid colors that make them stand out against the night sky. Although the moonlight may conceal the faintest meteors, you’ll still be treated to an unforgettable display, especially if you position yourself with the Moon at your back. Look overhead from approximately 1 to 3 a.m. Mark your calendars for January 3, 2025, for a spectacular night sky show! The Quadrantid Meteor Shower, known for its bright and quick appearance, will be at its best without the Moon’s light to interfere! 2025 Observation Note: This year, maximum activity for the “Quads,” which only lasts for a few hours, will occur at 10 a.m. EST and therefore will favor observers along the west coast of North America (7 a.m. PST) and Hawaii (5 a.m. HST). A single observer in these regions, between midnight and dawn might expect to see 40 to 60 of these moderately swift blue meteors per hour; across central and eastern North America, lesser numbers of around 20 to 30 per hour may be seen. The shower’s radiant is halfway between the head of Draco and the end of the Big Dipper’s handle in the predawn northeast sky. The Quadrantids get their name from an old constellation called Quadrans Muralis, even though they seem to come from the constellation Boötes nowadays. This meteor shower has been wowing people since the 1830s when it was first noted by Adolphe Quetelet. Return to Top The best way to watch for meteors is to check your weather forecast, find a place with a clear view of the sky, and arrange comfortable deck chairs with pillows and blankets. Be sure to wear warm clothing—even in summer—as the nights and earlier morning can be colder than you might think! Related: Farmers’ Almanac Extended Weather Forecast Another factor to consider is bright moonlight, which can considerably cut into the potential number of meteors that might be seen. If a gibbous or full Moon is present during your meteor watch, its bright light will make seeing meteors difficult. For a better experience, get away from city lights, give your eyes time to get used to the dark, and then just look up.

                "content": "Loop Illinois Around the Globe One of the best meteor showers of the year is peaking tonight, sparking shooting stars into the chilly December sky. Here's when and where to look for the Geminid meteor shower. By Brian Lada, AccuWeather meteorologist and senior content editor Published Dec 9, 2024 12:47 PM CST | Updated Dec 12, 2024 9:11 PM CST Although a nearly full moon will contest the peak of the Geminid meteor shower, there are ways you can still observe the shower. Don’t let the moon stop you from seeing shooting stars. One of the best meteor showers of the year is about to peak, sparking shooting stars into the chilly December sky. It's considered one of the best meteor showers of the year because the meteors are bright and plentiful. The Geminid meteor shower peaks tonight, Thursday, Dec. 12, into the early hours of Friday, Dec. 13. Most years, it boasts up to 120 meteors per hour; however, a nearly full moon will outshine many of the dimmer meteors in 2024. The Geminids over the Himalayas in Tibet (Getty Images) While the Geminid meteor shower is most prominently seen from the Northern Hemisphere, it is also observable from the Southern Hemisphere. Meteor showers derive their names from the constellation where their meteors seem to originate, with the upcoming event linked to Gemini. Gemini is relatively simple to identify in the night sky; it lies to the northeast of Orion and between the constellations Taurus and Cancer. The constellation is distinguished by its two brightest stars, Castor and Pollux, which symbolize the heads of the Gemini twins. To spot Geminid meteors, you don’t need to look directly at the constellation. The meteors will be visible throughout the entire night sky with the first shooting stars appearing not long after nightfall. However, due to the nearly full moon competing for dominance in the sky on peak night, stargazers are advised to look for meteors in darker areas where the moon is out of sight. Astronomy Professor Chris Palma from Penn State University offers his advice on how to catch the best astronomical events this December. December has the longest nights of the entire year, providing more time for stargazing. However, it also brings an uptick in storms and clouds, which can make it challenging to view some of the upcoming celestial sights. There is one final meteor shower of the year following the Geminids. On the night of Dec. 21 into the morning of Dec. 22, the Ursids will peak. However, it will not be as impressive of a show compared to the Geminids, as the late-December event only brings around 10 meteors per hour.

                "content": "Visit the Meteor Shower Calendar The 2024 Meteor Shower List is presented in four separate parts. The showers are broken down by intensity with major, minor, variable, and weak showers being separated into their own groups. The general public is encouraged to use the list of major showers as they are the most well known and provide the most activity on a year to year basis. The other showers rarely surpass ten meteors per hour at maximum and are difficult to observe by the general public. Information and Table Template Courtesy the International Meteor Organization and Masahiro Koseki. The meteor showers listed above are the easiest to observe and provide the most activity. Particular attention should be noted to the time and moonlight conditions. All these showers are best seen after midnight. Some are not even visible until after midnight. Showers that peak with the moon’s age between 10 and 20 days will be affected by moonlight and difficult to observe this year. While the time each shower is best seen remains much the same year after year, the moonlight conditions change considerably from one year to the next. The time listed is not necessarily the peak time, but the time in which the radiant is best positioned in the sky. We will post upcoming details of each major shower that is free from moonlight well in advance of their peak activity. Information and Table Template Courtesy the International Meteor Organization and Masahiro Koseki. The meteor showers listed above range from 2 to 10 shower members per hour at maximum activity. These meteors can be detected by experienced observers but novice observers and the general public will have difficultly distinguishing these meteors from the major showers or sporadic (random) meteors. Information and Table Template Courtesy the International Meteor Organization. The meteor showers listed above produce strong activity on rare occasions. Most of the time only a few scattered remnants of these showers are observed with rates of one shower member per NIGHT. Note that most of these showers are best seen during the evening hours, a situation quite opposite most meteor showers. Information and Table Template Courtesy the International Meteor Organization and Masahiro Koseki. The meteor showers listed above rarely produce an average of more than two shower members per hour. In some cases these showers have been recently discovered by video means, being too weak for visual observers to pick out from the sporadic background. This list is being provided for the experienced observer in order to follow the activity of these weak showers. Good luck with your observations in 2024! Shower: named for the constellation or closest star within a constellation where the radiant is located at maximum activity. Activity Period: the dates when the shower is active and the observer can expect activity from this source. Maximum: the date on which the maximum activity is expected to occur. S.L.: the equivalent solar longitude of the date of maximum activity. Solar longitude is measured in degrees (0-359) with 0 occurring at the exact moment of the spring equinox, 90 at the summer solstice, 180 at the autumnal equinox, and 270 at the winter solstice. Scientists use this time measurement as it is independent of the calendar and its leap years. Radiant: the area in the sky where shower meteors seem to appear from. This position is given in right ascension (celestial longitude) and declination (celestial latitude). The radiant must be near or above the horizon in order to witness activity from a particular shower. Velocity: the velocity at which shower meteors strike the Earth’s atmosphere. The velocity depends on the angle meteoroids (meteors in space) intersect the Earth. Meteoroids orbiting in the opposite direction of the Earth and striking the atmosphere head-on are much faster than those orbiting in the same direction as the Earth. This velocity is measured in kilometers per second. r: The Population Index, An estimate of the ratio of the number of meteors in subsequent magnitude classes. Simply stated: the lower the “r” value, the resulting overall mean magnitude of each shower will be brighter. “r” usually ranges from 2.0 (bright) to 3.5 (faint). ZHR: Zenith Hourly Rate, the average maximum number of shower meteors visible per hour if the radiant is located exactly overhead and the limiting magnitude equals +6.5 (a very dark sky). Actual counts rarely reach this figure as the zenith angle of the radiant is usually less and the limiting magnitude is usually lower than +6.5. ZHR is a useful tool when comparing the actual observed rates between individual observers as it sets observing conditions for all to the same standards. Time: this is the time of night when meteors from each shower are best seen. Quite often the radiant will culminate after sunrise therefore the last dark hour before dawn will be listed. Daylight Saving Time (Summer Time) is used from March through October. These figures are also highly dependent on the latitude of the observer. The time listed is most precise for mid-northern latitudes. Moon: the age of the moon in days where 0 is new, 7 is first quarter, 15 is full, and 22 is last quarter. Meteor activity is best seen in the absence of moonlight so showers reaching maximum activity when the moon is less than 10 days old or more than 25 are much more favorably observed than those situated closer to the full moon. Class: A scale developed by Robert Lunsford to group meteor showers by their intensity: The American Meteor Society, Ltd. is a non-profit scientific organization founded in 1911 and established to inform, encourage, and support the research activities of both amateur and professional astronomers who are interested in the fascinating field of Meteor Astronomy.

                "title": "Friday the 13th - Wikipedia",
                "content": "Friday the 13th is considered an unlucky day in Western superstition. It occurs when the 13th day of the month in the Gregorian calendar falls on a Friday, which happens at least once every year but can occur up to three times in the same year. For example, 2015 had a Friday the 13th in February, March, and November, which will happen again in 2026. Leap years that begin on Sunday (i.e. that follow Dominical Letter AG) such as 2012 and 2040, also have three Friday the 13ths in January, April, and July. 2017 through 2020 had two Friday the 13ths, as did 2023; 2016, 2021, and 2022 had just one Friday the 13th, as will 2025, 2027, and 2028; 2024 will have two Friday the 13ths.[1] For a month to have a Friday the 13th, the 1st must be a Sunday. One source mentioned for the unlucky reputation of the number 13 is a Norse myth about twelve gods having a dinner party in Valhalla. The trickster god Loki, who was not invited, arrived as the thirteenth guest, and arranged for Höðr, the god of darkness, to shoot Balder, the god of joy and gladness, with a mistletoe-tipped arrow. Balder died, triggering much suffering in the world, which caused the number 13 to be considered unlucky.[2][3] The superstition seems to relate to various things, like the story of Jesus's Last Supper and crucifixion in which there were thirteen individuals present in the Upper Room on the thirteenth of Nisan Maundy Thursday, the night before his death on Good Friday.[a][b][6] While there is evidence of both Friday[7] and the number 13[8] being considered unlucky, there is no record of the two items being referred to as especially unlucky in conjunction before the 19th century.[9][10] The Knights Templar Some cite the arrest of the Knights Templar on Friday, October 13, 1307, by officers of King Philip IV of France as the origin of the Friday the 13th superstition, but it is agreed the origins remain murky.[11] In France, Friday 13th might have been associated with misfortune as early as the first half of the 19th century. A character in the 1834 play Les Finesses des Gribouilles states, \"I was born on a Friday, December 13th, 1813 from which come all of my misfortunes\".[12] An early documented reference in English occurs in H. S. Edwards' biography of Gioachino Rossini, who died on Friday 13th of November 1868: It is possible that the publication in 1907 of T. W. Lawson's popular novel Friday, the Thirteenth,[14] contributed to popularizing the superstition. In the novel, an unscrupulous broker takes advantage of the superstition to create a Wall Street panic on a Friday the 13th.[9] Similar dates are prevalent in many cultures, although it is unclear whether these similarities are in any way historically connected or only coincidental. In Hispanic countries, instead of Friday, Tuesday the 13th (martes trece) is considered a day of bad luck.[15] The Greeks also consider Tuesday (and especially the 13th) an unlucky day.[16] Tuesday is considered dominated by the influence of Ares, the god of war (or Mars, the Roman equivalent). The fall of Constantinople to the Fourth Crusade occurred on Tuesday 13 April 1204, and the Fall of Constantinople to the Ottomans happened on Tuesday 29 May 1453, events that strengthen the superstition about Tuesday. In addition, in Greek the name of the day is Triti (Τρίτη) meaning the third (day of the week), adding weight to the superstition, since bad luck is said to \"come in threes\".[16] There is a Tuesday the 13th in months that begin on a Thursday. In Italian popular culture, Friday the 17th (and not the 13th) is considered a bad luck day.[17] The origin of this belief could be traced in the writing of the number 17, in Roman numerals: XVII. By shuffling the digits of the number one can get the Latin vīxī (\"I have lived\", implying death at present), an omen of bad luck.[18] In fact, in Italy, 13 is generally considered a lucky number,[19] although some people may consider 13 an unlucky number as well due to Americanization. The 2000 parody film Shriek if You Know What I Did Last Friday the Thirteenth was released in Italy with the title Shriek – Hai impegni per venerdì 17? (\"Shriek – Do You Have Something to Do on Friday the 17th?\").[citation needed] According to the Stress Management Center and Phobia Institute in Asheville, North Carolina, an estimated 17–21 million people in the United States are affected by Paraskevidekatriaphobia (fear of Friday the 13th), making it the most feared day and date in history. Some people are so paralyzed by fear that they avoid their normal routines in doing business, taking flights or even getting out of bed. It has been estimated that US$ 800–900 million is lost in business on this day.[20] Despite this, representatives for both Delta Air Lines and Continental Airlines (the latter now merged into United Airlines) have stated that their airlines do not suffer from any noticeable drop in travel on those Fridays.[21] In Finland, a consortium of governmental and nongovernmental organizations led by the Ministry of Social Affairs and Health promotes the National Accident Day (kansallinen tapaturmapäivä) to raise awareness about automotive safety, which always falls on a Friday the 13th.[22] The event is coordinated by the Finnish Red Cross and has been held since 1995.[23] A study by Scanlon, Luben, Scanlon, & Singleton (1993)[24] attracted attention from popular science literature,[c][d] as it concluded that \"the risk of hospital admission as a result of a transport accident may be increased by as much as 52 percent on the 13th\";[24]: 1584 however, the authors clearly state that \"the numbers of admissions from accidents are too small to allow meaningful analysis\".[24]: 1586 Subsequent studies have disproved any correlation between Friday the 13th and the rate of accidents.[27][28] On 12 June 2008 the Dutch Centre for Insurance Statistics stated to the contrary, that \"fewer accidents and reports of fire and theft occur when the 13th of the month falls on a Friday than on other Fridays, because people are preventatively more careful or just stay home. Statistically speaking, driving is slightly safer on Friday the 13th, at least in the Netherlands; in the last two years, Dutch insurers received reports of an average 7,800 traffic accidents each Friday; but the average figure when the 13th fell on a Friday was just 7,500.\"[29][30] In recent years, Friday the 13th has emerged as a holiday for tattoo parlors and enthusiasts; with many shops running for 24 hours, and offering flash tattoos featuring the number 13 in the design.[31] Some claim that having a number 13 tattoo can be an antidote to bad luck. According to Oliver Peck: \"Bad luck would come your way, it would see the number 13, see that bad luck is already there, and it would pass on by.” [32] Each 400 year Gregorian solar cycle contains 146,097 days (with 97 leap days) or exactly 20,871 weeks. Each cycle contains the same pattern of days of the week and therefore the same pattern of Fridays that are on the 13th. The 13th day of the month is very slightly more likely to be a Friday than any other day of the week.[33][34][35] Any month that starts on a Sunday contains a Friday the 13th, and there is at least one Friday the 13th in every calendar year. The months with a Friday the 13th are determined by the Dominical letter (G, F, GF, etc.) of the year. Years which begin on the same day of the week and are of the same type (i.e. common year or leap year), will have a Friday the 13th in the same months. This sequence, given here for 1900–2099, follows a 28-year cycle from 1 March 1900 to 28 February 2100: Although there is always at least one Friday the 13th per calendar year, it can be as long as 14 months between two Friday the 13ths.[36] The longest period that occurs without a Friday the 13th is 14 months, either from July to September the following year being a common year starting on Tuesday (F) (e.g. 2001–02, 2012–13 and 2018–19), or from August to October the following year being a leap year starting on Saturday (BA) (e.g. 1999–2000 and 2027–28). The shortest period that occurs with a Friday the 13th is just one month, from February to March in a common year starting on Thursday (D) (e.g. 2009, 2015 and 2026). On average, there is a Friday the 13th once every 212.35 days. Friday the 13ths occurs with an average frequency of 1.7218 per year or about 3477 since the year 1 CE. There can be no more than three Friday the 13ths in a single calendar year; either in February, March, and November in a common year starting on Thursday (such as 2009, 2015, or 2026) (D), or January, April, and July in a leap year starting on Sunday (such as 1984, 2012, or 2040) (AG).[37] In the 2000s, there were three Friday the 13ths in 2009, and two Friday the 13ths in 2001, 2002, 2006, and 2007. In the 2010s, there were three Friday the 13ths in 2012 and 2015, and two in 2013, 2017, 2018, and 2019.[1] In the 2020s, there were two Friday the 13ths in 2020 and 2023. There will also be three Friday the 13ths in 2026, and two in 2024 and 2029.[1] The remaining years all have at least one Friday the 13th.[1] For the details see the table below; this table is for the Gregorian calendar and Jan/Feb for leap years:",

                "content": "By: History.com Editors Updated: August 10, 2021 | Original: October 10, 2017 Long considered a harbinger of bad luck, Friday the 13th has inspired a late 19th-century secret society, an early 20th-century novel, a horror film franchise and not one but two unwieldy terms—paraskavedekatriaphobia and friggatriskaidekaphobia—that describe fear of this supposedly unlucky day. Just like walking under a ladder, crossing paths with a black cat or breaking a mirror, many people hold fast to the belief that Friday the 13th brings bad luck. Though it’s uncertain exactly when this particular tradition began, negative superstitions have swirled around the number 13 for centuries. While Western cultures have historically associated the number 12 with completeness (there are 12 days of Christmas, 12 months and zodiac signs, 12 labors of Hercules, 12 gods of Olympus and 12 tribes of Israel, just to name a few examples), its successor 13 has a long history as a sign of bad luck. The ancient Code of Hammurabi, for example, reportedly omitted a 13th law from its list of legal rules. Though this was probably a clerical error, superstitious people sometimes point to this as proof of 13’s longstanding negative associations. Fear of the number 13 has even earned a psychological term: triskaidekaphobia. According to biblical tradition, 13 guests attended the Last Supper, held on Maundy Thursday, including Jesus and his 12 apostles (one of whom, Judas, betrayed him). The next day, of course, was Good Friday, the day of Jesus’ crucifixion. The seating arrangement at the Last Supper is believed to have given rise to a longstanding Christian superstition that having 13 guests at a table was a bad omen—specifically, that it was courting death. Though Friday’s negative associations are weaker, some have suggested they also have roots in Christian tradition: Just as Jesus was crucified on a Friday, Friday was also said to be the day Eve gave Adam the fateful apple from the Tree of Knowledge, as well as the day Cain killed his brother, Abel. In the late-19th century, a New Yorker named Captain William Fowler (1827-1897) sought to remove the enduring stigma surrounding the number 13—and particularly the unwritten rule about not having 13 guests at a dinner table—by founding an exclusive society called the Thirteen Club. The group dined regularly on the 13th day of the month in room 13 of the Knickerbocker Cottage, a popular watering hole Fowler owned from 1863 to 1883. Before sitting down for a 13-course dinner, members would pass beneath a ladder and a banner reading “Morituri te Salutamus,” Latin for “Those of us who are about to die salute you.” Four former U.S. presidents (Chester A. Arthur, Grover Cleveland, Benjamin Harrison and Theodore Roosevelt) would join the Thirteen Club’s ranks at one time or another. The much‑feared day was the beginning of the end for the powerful warriors. The ancient Babylonian king ruled with military and diplomatic finesse—and he also knew a thing or two about self‑promotion. Symbols, amulets and other talismans from around the globe. An important milestone in the history of the Friday the 13th legend in particular (not just the number 13) occurred in 1907, with the publication of the novel Friday, the Thirteenth written by Thomas William Lawson. The book told the story of a New York City stockbroker who plays on superstitions about the date to create chaos on Wall Street, and make a killing on the market. The horror movie Friday the 13th, released in 1980, introduced the world to a hockey mask-wearing killer named Jason, and is perhaps the best-known example of the famous superstition in pop culture history. The movie spawned multiple sequels, as well as comic books, novellas, video games, related merchandise and countless terrifying Halloween costumes. On Friday, October 13, 1307, officers of King Philip IV of France arrested hundreds of the Knights Templar, a powerful religious and military order formed in the 12th century for the defense of the Holy Land. Imprisoned on charges of various illegal behaviors (but really because the king wanted access to their financial resources), many Templars were later executed. Some cite the link with the Templars as the origin of the Friday the 13th superstition, but like many legends involving the Templars and their history, the truth remains murky. In more recent times, a number of traumatic events have occurred on Friday the 13th, including the German bombing of Buckingham Palace (September 1940); the murder of Kitty Genovese in Queens, New York (March 1964); a cyclone that killed more than 300,000 people in Bangladesh (November 1970); the disappearance of a Chilean Air Force plane in the Andes (October 1972); the death of rapper Tupac Shakur (September 1996) and the crash of the Costa Concordia cruise ship off the coast of Italy, which killed 30 people (January 2012). “The Origins of Unlucky Friday the 13th,” Live Science.“Friday the 13th: why is it unlucky and other facts about the worst day in the calendar,” The Telegraph.“13 Freaky Things That Happened on Friday the 13th,” Live Science.“Here’s Why Friday the 13th is Considered Unlucky,” Time.“Friggatriskaidekaphobes Need Not Apply,” New-York Historical Society.

With the Geminids meteor shower illuminating the night sky, it’s a great opportunity to leave superstition behind and make a wish on a shooting star.

More:December to bring Geminid, Ursid meteor showers, naked eye view of Jupiter — how to view Friday the 13th’s reputation for bad luck largely originates from religious and cultural beliefs. In Christianity, it is associated with the Last Supper, where Judas, the 13th guest, betrayed Jesus, leading to his crucifixion on a Friday, according to USA TODAY. Norse mythology also contributes, with the 13th god, Loki, bringing chaos and death. This superstition deepened over time, particularly after the mass arrest of the Knights Templar on Friday, October 13th, 1307, further cementing the day’s unlucky status. Next year, the only Friday the 13th will fall in June.

                "content": "By Kaity Kline circa 1930: Members of Friday The Thirteenth Club walk under a ladder in single file at a meeting on the outskirts of Paris. The club meets every Friday 13th to do everything that superstitious people traditionally avoid. Hulton Archive/Keystone/Getty Images hide caption The superstition that Friday the 13th is an unlucky day has been around for the past 100 years. But it doesn't have the ancient origins that many might expect. It's hard to pinpoint exactly why Friday the 13th is considered an unlucky day. Experts can only speculate. \"The United States, we get it from England… it wasn't considered an unlucky day in England until the 20th century. The first recorded instance we have of that in print is 1913,\" said Moira Marsh, a folklore librarian at the University of Indiana Bloomington. \"People start to make references to it being unlucky without saying why they think it's unlucky. And because of that, typically what you get is all kinds of wild theories about why Friday the 13th is unlucky,\" said Stephen Winick, a folklore specialist at the American Folklife Center of The Library of Congress. Some speculate that Friday the 13th is unlucky because Judas was the 13th guest at the Last Supper, or that Knights Templar were condemned on a Friday the 13th. But Winick said experts don't know if any of those things are true. The first references Winick has seen saying Friday the 13th is unlucky are both from French writing and plays. A character in the 1834 play Les Finesses des Gribouilles says \"I was born on a Friday, December 13th, 1813 from which come all of my misfortunes.\" And in the French literary magazine Revue de Paris, Marquis de Salvo wrote about a father who killed his daughter on Friday the 13th, and said \"It is always Fridays and the number thirteen that bring back luck.\" While the combination of Friday and 13 is a relatively new invention, the idea that Fridays are unlucky is not. \"Fridays were considered unlucky days, and that's been true since the Middle Ages in the English speaking world and probably through most of Europe, because Friday was the day of crucifixion. And in the old Catholic tradition, every Friday was a day of penance. And that idea has persisted,\" said Marsh. Marsh said the idea that 13 is an unlucky number doesn't really show up until around the 17th century. \"Before that, it might have been considered a good number because it goes back to supposedly the 13 people who were at the Last Supper. Before reformation, Christians preferred to try and emulate that.\" After the Reformation came along, Marsh said ideas like that were forbidden as superstitious. And so what was considered a good number flipped to be considered a bad one. There's another idea about why the number 13 is unlucky. \"12 is a number that's very mathematically significant. It's divisible by many different numbers. And it's very useful mathematically for various things,\" said Winick. There are 12 months, 12 zodiac signs, 12 inches in a foot. \"And then 13 comes along and it's kind of a dud. It doesn't really help you out much mathematically.\" Marsh and Winick say that thanks to popular culture, like the movie Friday the 13th, the day is now pretty widespread in countries around the world. And journalists have had a hand in spreading the popularity of that idea. In Italy, Winick said, the unlucky day tends to be Friday the 17th. And then in Spanish speaking countries, the unlucky day tends to be Tuesday the 13th. \"People speculate that's because Tuesday is associated with the chaotic God of war. You know, Martes or Tuesday in Spanish is related to the God of war, Mars. Because of that, people think that may be the origin of Tuesday's being unlucky,\" said Winick. Marsh said a Greek nurse in the 1960s may be another source who found Tuesdays to be unlucky. According to this nurse, if a wedding ended on a Monday evening, the women of the family would keep the bridge close by so that her husband wouldn't touch her. Because if any child was conceived on a Monday evening, the beginning of Tuesday would be considered unlucky, and the baby would likely have birth defects. In Greece, Winick said they often link the potential origins back to ancient Greek culture. So they'll think about ancient Greek mathematics, which had ideas that the number 12 was a good number, and 13 was a bad number. \"We seek explanations for the chaotic experience of life. We want to explain to ourselves why things have happened in a certain way, why things didn't go our way… it gives us a sense of control even though we may not have control,\" said Winick.

But I'm feeling thirty-foOoOoOour 🎶 BuzzFeed Staff So today, on December 13th, I wanted to just take the time to use the media platform at which I happen to work (BuzzFeed Dot Com) to write you an intimate and personal letter that I hope somehow makes it to your eyes. Also, btw, CONGRATULATIONS ON BEING NAMED TIME MAGAZINE'S PERSON OF THE YEAR FOR 2023! That's kind of never-been-done-before-vibes. For a 33-year-old! Tay, be so honest with me. Do you think I too can become a billionaire in the next 6 calendar years? And that's not even to mentionTaylor Swift: The Eras Tour concert movie which ALSO broke box office records for first-day ticket sales and grossing more than $200 million at the global box office. And now we know that you and one particular H-O-T-T-I-E on that team have actually been romantically dating (in L-O-V-E, perhaps?) for like, many months... Another congratulations is in order because, Tay. Girl. He is hot. Like, soo hot. And sooo good at football, apparently. I know that you have to plan your life like, 2-3 years in advanced so I'm sure you could tell me a lot about what your 34th year will hold. But I'm sure you won't... you sneaky, secretive, little surprise girl! IDK but that seems like something you would do. Admit it! 🤭 If ANYONE has the power to do THAT particular thing, girl.... it's you. No offence. Because I was THERE when you spoke of it at the \"In Conversation With... Taylor Swift\" event at TIFF on Friday, September 9, 2022. And when I say \"I was there,\" I mean that I was absolutely outside, barred from entry, and screaming in the streets, waiting to catch even a glimpse of you. And you looked STUNISTA in that GOLDEN Oscar-statue-esque gown queen! Foreshadowing, perhaps? I know you don't go to that since *whispers*... buzzcut and bleach-blond hair era... But I think this could be the year to do it. I hope, more than any other guess, that I'm right about there being lots of time for rest in your year ahead. Rest and self-care and a nice, hearty glass of red wine - because you really deserve it!",

                "title": "Macy's Store Closing List 2024: Which Stores Will Macy's Close?",
                "content": "The department store chain announced that 50 locations will be shutting down by the end of this year alone. We've been independently researching and testing products for over 120 years. If you buy through our links, we may earn a commission. Learn more about our review process. It may be time to say goodbye to your local Macy's. The department store chain has announced plans to close approximately 150 stores across the country through 2026, including 50 locations this year alone. Macy's described the stores set to be shuttered as \"underproductive locations.\" While the brand has not yet released a full list of the Macy's stores that are closing, one of these locations has been confirmed by San Francisco Mayor London Breed's office as Macy's Union Square flagship store (though it will remain open indefinitely until the property is sold). In a statement released on February 27, Macy's revealed its new strategy — coined as \"A Bold New Chapter\" — will include closing the 150 stores and prioritizing investments in the remaining 350 locations. The strategy will also include opening new Bloomingdale's locations and Bluemercury stores, which are Macy's luxury brands. Macy's, Inc. is hoping this move will re-strengthen the company's brand, digital presence and relationship with customers. According to Macy's, the strategy aims to solidify Bloomingdale's and Bluemercury's positions in the luxury space by opening more physical locations and offering more immersive customer experiences. Tony Spring, who stepped into his position as the chief executive officer of Macy's in February, said in the statement: This isn't the first time Macy's has announced unfortunate news about store closings in recent years. The department store chain has closed roughly 300 stores since 2015, including closing 45 Macy's locations in 2021 and 28 locations in 2020. In January, Macy’s announced it was laying off about 3.5% of its workforce (around 2,350 employees) and closing five stores. The \"Bold New Chapter\" strategy includes focusing remaining resources on top-performing stores in order to improve customer shopping experiences and sales. The recent store closures and downsizing can be attributed to multiple factors (ahem, online shopping), but experts say the drop in the company's stock price most likely drove the plans to refocus on currently successful locations and luxury brands. Macy's stock price peaked at $73 a share in 2015, but nine years later it's dropped to $18 a share — that's a whopping 75% decrease. \"Our threshold to keep a store open has become more stringent,\" Spring said in a conference call with investors, per CBS News. \"In the past we may have continued to operate a store that was cash flow positive. Now the bar has been raised.\" Including the store closures announced in January, here is a list of the Macy's stores facing closure this year. Note: This list will be updated as more store closures are officially announced. Luckily for loyal shoppers, the remaining 350 Macy's locations will be reinvested in and improved upon — and if it turns out your local store is set to close and you're in need of a new dress or bottle of perfume, there's always Macys.com.

                "content": "In America, shopping malls are still a thing, but some have not made it to 2024. Within those shopping malls, exists the \"anchor stores,\" the four or so large department stores that are on the ends of each long pathway of the inside of the mall. One of those stores has had a legendary presence in America since the 1800s. Macy's, known for being one of the largest retail chains in America, is downsizing. In 2024, Macy's will shut down a total of 50 stores across America. It has an even broader plan to shut down 150 underperforming stores across America. After years of sluggish sales performance, Macy's is planning drastic cuts to its store fleet in order to concentrate on better-performing locations. According to Macy's CEO, Tony Spring, Macy's has \"too many locations that were built for a different era,\" adding that the company has \"no choice\" but to close stores if it wants to thrive and not just survive. Even with malls closing and Macy's stores ramping down it's locations, the brand is so iconic, that it believes it will not only be able to survive this new era of shopping, but thrive in it. The Macy’s brand remains highly recognized across America. Spring spoke about how the retailer is part of key moments in people’s lives, like buying a prom dress or suit or building a wedding registry. Let's not forget the Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade, which happens each Thanksgiving day in New York City. With it's brand recognition, and it's consumer loyalty, Macy's hopes that if they just trim the fat, per say, and get rid of some of their underperforming stores, they will make it another 100 plus years, moving forward.

Lakers: In its past 11 games, Los Angeles is averaging 103.3 points, while allowing its opponents to score an average of 113.7 points.

                "content": "Odell Cornelious Beckham Jr. (born November 5, 1992), commonly known by his initials OBJ,[1] is an American professional football wide receiver. He played college football for the LSU Tigers and was selected by the New York Giants in the first round of the 2014 NFL draft. Beckham started the 2012 BCS National Championship Game in his first year playing at LSU, and won the Paul Hornung Award following his junior season in 2013. In his first season with the New York Giants, Beckham broke numerous NFL rookie receiving records, despite missing the first four games of the season due to injury. Beckham became the first player to record more than 75 receptions, 1,100 yards, and ten touchdowns in a rookie season, and broke the rookie record for the most average receiving yards per game.[2] During Week 12 of his first season, Beckham came to national attention when he made a one-handed touchdown catch while falling backwards in a Sunday Night Football game against the Dallas Cowboys,[3] which numerous pundits and athletes called the greatest catch ever made.[4] Beckham won the 2014 Offensive Rookie of the Year award. In 2016, he became the fastest player in NFL history to reach both 200 career receptions and 4,000 career receiving yards. In 2016, he recorded his first 100-reception season and reached the NFL playoffs for the first time in his career, after helping the Giants to an 11–5 season record. Beckham was named to the Pro Bowl in each of his first three seasons and has been named a second-team All-Pro twice. After a stint with the Cleveland Browns, Beckham was signed by the Los Angeles Rams midway through the 2021 season. Beckham and the Rams went on to win Super Bowl LVI. He spent the 2022 season out of football while rehabbing an ACL injury he sustained in the Super Bowl before signing with the Baltimore Ravens in 2023. He left Baltimore for the Miami Dolphins in 2024 and mutually agreed to be released in December 2024. Beckham was born in Baton Rouge, Louisiana.[5] He attended Isidore Newman School in New Orleans, Louisiana, where he was a letterman in football, basketball, and track.[6] In football, he played wide receiver, quarterback, running back, and cornerback for the Greenies football team. As a junior, he caught 45 passes for 743 yards and 10 touchdowns, while also adding three more scores on the ground. As a senior, he hauled in 50 catches for 1,010 yards and 19 touchdowns, joining Cooper Manning as the only two players in school history to record 1,000 receiving yards in a season.[7] In addition, he rushed for 331 yards and six touchdowns, passed for 90 yards and a score and also averaged 30.0 yards per punt return.[8] He was named to the Times Picayune 2011 Blue-Chip list and to the Louisiana 2A All-State first-team as a wide receiver, while he also earned District 9-2A Offensive MVP honors and a spot on The Advocate's Super Dozen.[9] In basketball, Beckham lettered all four years and was an all-district selection his junior and senior years. As a standout track & field athlete, Beckham followed in his mother's footsteps to excel in the sprinting and jumping events while at Newman High. He took silver in the long jump event at the 2010 Newman Invitational, with a career-best leap of 6.83 meters.[10] At the 2010 LA 2A State Meet, he earned sixth-place finishes in both the 200-meter dash, with a PR time of 22.31 seconds, and in the long jump, with a leap of 6.71 meters (21 ft 11 in).[11] He was also a member of the Newman 4 × 100 m and 4 × 200 m relay teams. Beckham also played soccer growing up and considers English player David Beckham his childhood idol.[12] His soccer club coaches offered Beckham a chance to try out for a junior national team program, but he did not want to spend the required time overseas considering his talents in other sports at home.[12] Regarded as a four-star recruit by both Rivals.com and Scout.com, Beckham was rated as the No. 6 wide receiver and as the No. 40 player in the nation. He chose Louisiana State University (LSU) over scholarship offers from Ole Miss, Nebraska, Tulane, and Tulsa, among others.[13] He also played in the 2011 U.S. Army All-American Bowl.[14] As a true freshman at LSU in 2011, Beckham started nine of 14 games. He made his collegiate debut on September 3, 2011, against the #3 Oregon Ducks. Against the Ducks, he had two receptions for 10 yards in the 40–27 victory.[15] Against the #16 West Virginia Mountaineers on September 24, Beckham scored his first career collegiate touchdown, a 52-yard reception from Jarrett Lee, in the 47–21 victory.[16] In the SEC Championship against the #12 Georgia Bulldogs, Beckham was held without a catch but did have two punt returns in the 42–10 victory.[17] The Tigers finished with a 13–0 record and made the BCS National Championship game in Beckham's freshman season.[18] In the game, which was a rematch against the Alabama Crimson Tide, Beckham had five receptions for 38 yards in the 21–0 defeat.[19] Overall, in his freshman season, Beckham finished second on the team with 41 receptions for 475 yards and tied for third with two receiving touchdowns.[20] He was named a freshman All-SEC selection.[21] As a sophomore in 2012, Beckham started 12 of 13 games for the Tigers. In the season opener against the North Texas Mean Green, he had his first collegiate career punt return touchdown, a 70-yard return in the first quarter of the 41–14 victory.[22] On September 29, he had his first career collegiate game with over 100 yards against the Towson Tigers. He had five receptions for 128 yards and two touchdowns in the 38–22 victory over the Tigers.[23] On November 17, against SEC West rival Ole Miss, he was held to only two receptions for 13 yards, but he had an 89-yard punt return touchdown in the fourth quarter help tie the game late. The Tigers would end up beating the Rebels by a score of 41–35.[24] In the regular season finale against the Arkansas Razorbacks, he had four receptions for 112 receiving yards in the 20–13 victory.[25] LSU finished with a 10–2 record and qualified for the Chick-fil-A Bowl against Clemson.[26] Beckham had three receptions for 40 receiving yards as LSU lost 25–24 on a game-winning field goal by Clemson as time expired.[27] He finished first on the team in receiving yards with 713, second in receptions with 43, only behind Jarvis Landry's 56 receptions, and third on the team with two receiving touchdowns.[28] As a junior in 2013, he combined with Jarvis Landry to form one of the most productive wide receiver duos in college football.[29][30] On August 31, in the Tigers' regular season opener, he had five receptions for 118 receiving yards in the 37–27 victory over #20 TCU at AT&T Stadium in Arlington, Texas.[31] On September 7, in the game against UAB, Beckham had five receptions for 136 yards and three touchdowns in the 56–17 victory.[32] In the same game, he returned a failed field goal attempt for a record-long 109 yards and a touchdown, and this record would be tied by Auburn's Chris Davis later that year against the Alabama Crimson Tide.[33] On October 5, against SEC West rival Mississippi State, Beckham had nine receptions for a then-career high 179 receiving yards with two touchdowns in the 59–26 victory.[34] Against the Furman Paladins on October 26, Beckham had six receptions for a collegiate career-high 204 yards and two touchdowns in the 48–16 victory.[35] He was a first and second-team All-Southeastern Conference (SEC) selection.[36] In his role as a wide receiver and return specialist, Beckham was named the winner of the 2013 Paul Hornung Award, presented annually to the most versatile player in major college football.[37] He finished the 2013 season with 57 receptions for 1,117 yards and eight touchdowns.[38] He led the SEC with 32 kickoff returns for 845 net yards in the 2013 season.[39] After the season, he decided to forgo his senior season and entered the 2014 NFL draft.[40][41] Beckham was selected by the New York Giants with the 12th overall pick in the first round of the 2014 NFL draft.[44] He was the third wide receiver to be selected that year.[45] He signed a four-year contract with the Giants on May 19, 2014. The deal was for $10.4 million with a $5.88 million signing bonus.[46][47] After missing a majority of the training camp, preseason, and the first four games of the season because of a hamstring injury, Beckham made his debut on October 5, 2014, in Week 5 against the Atlanta Falcons recording four receptions for 44 yards and a touchdown in the 30–20 victory.[48] In his first Monday Night Football game against the Indianapolis Colts, Beckham caught eight passes for 156 yards in the 40–24 loss.[49] Against the Seattle Seahawks in Week 10, he caught seven passes for 108 yards in the 38–17 loss.[50] On November 23, 2014, during a game against the Dallas Cowboys on Sunday Night Football, Beckham had 10 catches for 146 yards and two touchdowns, including a one-handed touchdown reception hailed as the \"catch of the year\", with Cris Collinsworth, Tony Dungy, Victor Cruz and LeBron James all saying that it was one of the best catches ever.[51][52][53][54][55] Beckham made this catch despite a pass interference penalty called on Dallas cornerback Brandon Carr while diving backwards with full extension of his right hand using only three fingers. The Giants still lost by a score of 31–28 due to a late fourth quarter touchdown throw from Tony Romo to Dez Bryant.[56] On December 8, 2014, the Pro Football Hall of Fame put Beckham's game-worn jersey from his famous one-handed catch game against Dallas on display.[57] Beckham finished November with 38 receptions, 593 receiving yards and two touchdowns.[58] He had at least 90 yards receiving in all five games in November, setting an NFL rookie record for a calendar month.[59] He also broke Bill Groman's and Randy Moss's rookie record for consecutive games with 90 or more receiving yards in a season.[60] In Week 14, Beckham extended his 90 receiving yard streak to 6 games, recording 11 receptions for 131 yards and a touchdown in a 36–7 victory over the Tennessee Titans. He also joined Bill Groman as the only rookies to have over 700 receiving yards in a six-game span.[61] On December 14, 2014, Beckham became the first NFL rookie with at least 12 catches, 140 yards, and three scores in a game racking up 143 receiving yards, 12 catches and three touchdowns.[62] With his 12 receptions, Beckham tied former Giants tight end Mark Bavaro for the most in a game by a Giants rookie; Bavaro had 12 catches against the Cincinnati Bengals on October 13, 1985. Beckham's 143 receiving yards marked the fifth time he topped 100 receiving yards during the 2014 season, extending his own Giants record and setting an NFL rookie record of over 90 receiving yards in seven straight games. With 61 catches over seven games, Beckham also set the record for most ever receptions by an NFL rookie in a seven-game span. On December 21, 2014, Beckham extended his streak of 90 or more receiving yards in game to 8 when he racked up 148 receiving yards on 8 receptions and also hauled in 2 touchdowns vs. St. Louis Rams, including an 80-yard score, the longest touchdown reception by a Giants rookie in franchise history.[63] He also extended his streak of games with 130+ receiving yards and at least one receiving touchdown to three.[64] In the regular season finale against the Philadelphia Eagles, Beckham had a career-high 185 receiving yards, which was the most in a game by a rookie in franchise history.[65] Mark Bavaro previously held the record when he had 176 receiving yards against the Cincinnati Bengals on October 13, 1985.[66] Beckham also had 12 receptions and a receiving touchdown against the Eagles, which tied Torry Holt for most games with at least ten receptions, 100 receiving yards, and one receiving touchdown in a season with four. Beckham finished his impressive rookie campaign with 91 receptions, 1,305 yards and 12 touchdowns in just 12 games. He's the fourth rookie in NFL history to have at least 1,300 receiving yards in a season, and the only rookie to have at least 90 receptions and 10 receiving touchdowns in a season.[67] Beckham was named a first-alternate for the 2015 Pro Bowl.[68] On January 7, 2015, Beckham replaced Calvin Johnson in Pro Bowl due to injury. He was the first Giants rookie wide receiver in franchise history and the first Giants rookie since Jeremy Shockey in 2002 to make the Pro Bowl.[69] He was named to the NFL All-Rookie Team.[70] Beckham revealed after the Pro Bowl game that during the 2014 season he suffered from two hamstring injuries before the season, one occurring in an early-offseason workout and another in a preseason game. Beckham stated, \"I was never fully healthy, I was just trying to manage it and maintain it, It's still not right. [I'm] still working on it.\"[71][72] Beckham earned numerous accolades after the season, which sportswriters hailed as one of the greatest ever by a rookie.[73][74] On January 31, 2015, Beckham was named Offensive Rookie of the Year by the Associated Press.[75] He was also awarded the 2014 Pro Football Writers Association Offensive Rookie of the Year Award.[76] On May 13, 2015, Beckham was voted to the cover of Madden NFL 16, beating out Rob Gronkowski of the New England Patriots.[77] Beckham is the youngest player ever to grace the cover of Madden.[78] Early in the season, Beckham had a strong game against the Falcons with seven receptions for 146 yards and one touchdown in the 24–20 defeat.[79] On October 11, against the San Francisco 49ers, he had seven receptions for 121 yards and a touchdown in the 30–27 victory.[80] In a 52–49 shootout with the New Orleans Saints in Week 8, Beckham had eight receptions for 130 yards and three touchdowns.[81] His performance against the Saints was the first of six consecutive games for him with at least 100 receiving yards.

Despite still being unsigned by a team, Beckham participated in the Rams' championship banner ceremony before their opening night game against the Buffalo Bills at SoFi Stadium on September 8, 2022.[175] Ultimately, Beckham did not sign with a team during the 2022 season.[176] On April 9, 2023, Beckham signed a one-year contract with the Baltimore Ravens.[177][178][179] He caught his first touchdown with the Ravens on his 31st birthday in a 37–3 Week 9 rout of the Seattle Seahawks.[180] In Week 11, he had four receptions for 116 yards, which was his first 100+ yard receiving game since 2021, in a 34–20 victory over the Cincinnati Bengals.[181] In the 2023 season, he appeared in 14 games and started six. He recorded 35 receptions for 565 receiving yards and three receiving touchdowns.[182] On March 13, 2024, Beckham was released by the Ravens.[183] On May 8, 2024, Beckham signed a one-year contract with the Miami Dolphins.[184] He was placed on the reserve/PUP list to begin the season after needing surgery to address an unspecified injury.[185] He was activated on October 5.[186] On December 13, Beckham and the Dolphins mutually agreed for Beckham to be waived.[187] Prior to his release, he played in nine games, totaling nine catches for 55 yards.[188] Beckham has a younger brother and a younger sister.[226][227] In 2024, Beckham’s brother, Kordell Beckham, became the winner of reality dating competition show Love Island USA season 6.[228] Beckham's father, Odell Beckham Sr., was a standout running back at Marshall High School in Marshall, Texas,[229] and played running back at LSU from 1989 to 1992. Beckham Sr. was also mentioned in Buzz Bissinger's 1990 book Friday Night Lights: A Town, a Team, and a Dream.[230][231] Beckham's mother, Heather Van Norman, also attended LSU as a track runner.[232] In 1993, she ran for three national championship relay teams, winning the events of indoor and outdoor 4 × 400 m and the outdoor 4 × 100 m relay.[233] When Van Norman found out she was pregnant with Beckham in 1992, she was in the midst of training for the Olympic trials.[234] She later became the coach of the Nicholls State University track and field team. She resigned from this position on June 1, 2017.[235] After the NFL Combine, Beckham planned on challenging Van Norman to a race in the 40-yard dash.[236] Beckham is or has been friends with many celebrities, including David Beckham (no relation), James Corden, Beyoncé, LeBron James, Drake,[237] and David Alaba, who is also his favorite soccer player.[238] Beckham is a Christian.[239] In the summer of 2018, Beckham was baptized in the Jordan River.[240][241] On January 29, 2015, during a live ESPN broadcast from Glendale, Arizona, Beckham partnered with New Orleans Saints quarterback Drew Brees to establish a new world record for the most one-handed catches made in a minute. He shattered the previous record of 10 as he caught 33 passes.[242] However, this achievement was short lived as CFL wide receiver Andy Fantuz recorded 50 one-handed catches in a minute to set the new world record.[243] On February 17, 2022 Beckham and his partner Lauren Wood's first child, a son, was born. [244] On November 27, 2022, Beckham refused to put on his seatbelt and was escorted off an American Airlines flight before it left Miami bound for Los Angeles. The crew tried to wake him up but said that he was unresponsive and \"appeared to be coming in and out of consciousness\". The plane returned to the gate, where he refused to deplane, whereupon all passengers were required to deplane and he was escorted off the plane by Miami-Dade Police. He was later banned from all future flights on American Airlines.[245] Beckham has raised money and awareness for several topics, including cancer research, feeding hungry Americans, damage done by Hurricane Harvey and severe floods, and the Make-A-Wish Foundation.

Polio vaccination has been part of the routine childhood immunization schedule in the United States for decades. It's still part of the routine childhood immunization schedule. Inactivated polio vaccine (IPV) is the only polio vaccine that has been given in the United States since 2000. Oral polio vaccine (OPV) is used in other countries. There are two types of vaccines that protect against polio. Since 2000, only IPV has been used to eliminate the risk of polio variants that can occur with OPV. As part of routine childhood immunization, children in the United States should get IPV to protect against polio. IPV may sometimes be given in the same shot with other vaccines (also called combination vaccines). You can ask your child's doctor about this option. Children should get 4 doses total, one at each of the following ages: Children who are delayed in getting all recommended doses should finish their series by following the recommended catch-up schedule. Most adults have likely already been vaccinated against poliovirus during childhood. However, if you have never been vaccinated against polio you should get 3 doses of IPV: Anyone not fully vaccinated. If you have had 1 or 2 doses of polio vaccine before, you should get the remaining 1 or 2 doses. People at risk. If you are fully vaccinated but at increased risk of poliovirus exposure, you may receive 1 lifetime booster dose of IPV. Polio vaccination protects you child from: The risk of lifelong paralysis is very serious. Even children who seem to fully recover can later develop new muscle pain, weakness, or paralysis as adults. This can occur 15 to 40 years later. About 2 to 10 children out of 100 who have paralysis from polio die. This is because the virus affects the muscles that help them breathe. Thanks to a successful vaccination program, most people in the United States are protected from polio. However, people who are not vaccinated or who haven't received all recommended doses may be at risk of getting polio. The disease still occurs in other parts of the world. It only takes one person with polio traveling from another country to bring polio into the United States. Infants and children As part of routine childhood immunization, all children in the United States should get IPV to protect against polio. This includes children who have not started their polio vaccine series or who are delayed in getting all recommended doses. People who plan to travel internationally should make sure they and their children are fully vaccinated against polio before departure. Adults Most adults have likely already been vaccinated against poliovirus during childhood. However, if you know or suspect that you are unvaccinated or incompletely vaccinated you should receive polio vaccination. Situations that put adults at increased risk of exposure to poliovirus include: Check with your healthcare provider if your child has: People who are moderately or severely ill should wait to get the vaccine until they recover. These include infants with moderate or severe diarrhea or vomiting. If you have a mild illness, such as a cold, they can probably get the vaccine today. IPV protects against severe disease caused by poliovirus in almost everyone who has received all the recommended doses. There is a chance of side effects, but they are usually mild and go away on their own. Serious reactions are also possible. Some people get a sore spot where the shot was given. IPV has not been known to cause serious problems, and most people do not have any problems with it. Some problems that could happen after getting this vaccine: Your or your child’s doctor’s office is usually the best place to receive recommended vaccines. Vaccines may also be available at pharmacies, workplaces, community health clinics, health departments, schools, or religious centers. There are a few ways to cover the cost of vaccines: Most health insurance plans cover the cost of vaccines. However, you may want to check with your insurance provider before going to a healthcare provider. Check for cost information and for a list of in-network vaccine providers. Your children may be able to get no-cost vaccines through the Vaccines for Children (VFC) Program. This program helps families of eligible children who may not be able to afford or have access to vaccines. All 50 states and DC have state laws that require children entering childcare or public schools to have certain vaccinations. There is no federal law that requires this. CDC recommends that all children get 4 doses of IPV before or at school entry. Students in school settings have a higher likelihood of spreading chickenpox because they are constantly in close contact with each other. Getting vaccinated means: Polio was once one of the most feared diseases in the United States. Thanks to the polio vaccine, wild poliovirus has been eliminated in this country.

                "content": "The polio vaccines protect against polio, an infection caused by a virus that can lead to permanent paralysis. The vaccines come in two forms: Children usually get IPV at ages 2 months, 4 months, 6–18 months, and 4–6 years. Sometimes IPV is given in a combination vaccine (in the same shot) with other vaccines. In this case, a child might get a fifth dose of IPV. This is safe. OPV doses given before April 2016 can count toward a child's U.S. polio vaccination requirements. Doses given after that will not count. Kids who will travel to a country with a high risk for infection can get the 4 shots in a shorter timeframe, with the first dose as early as 6 weeks of age. They still should get the final dose at age 4 or older (at least 6 months after the previous dose). The vaccine offers protection against polio, which can cause paralysis and death. Polio has been eliminated from the United States, but still happens in other countries and can be spread by people who travel. The vaccine can cause mild side effects, such as a fever; and pain, redness, or swelling in the area where the shot was given. As with any vaccine, there is a small risk of fainting, and a very small chance of an allergic reaction. Simple colds or other minor illnesses should not prevent vaccination, but your doctor might choose to reschedule the vaccine if your child has a more serious illness. Talk to your doctor about whether the vaccine is a good idea if your child ever had a serious allergic reaction, or any allergic reaction after an earlier IPV shot or to the antibiotics neomycin, streptomycin, or polymyxin B. For pain or fever, check with your doctor to see if you can give either acetaminophen or ibuprofen, and to find out the right dose. A warm, damp cloth or a heating pad on the site of the shot may help reduce soreness, as can moving or using the arm or leg.

                "content": "Polio vaccines are vaccines used to prevent poliomyelitis (polio).[2][3] Two types are used: an inactivated poliovirus given by injection (IPV) and a weakened poliovirus given by mouth (OPV).[2] The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends all children be fully vaccinated against polio.[2] The two vaccines have eliminated polio from most of the world,[4][5] and reduced the number of cases reported each year from an estimated 350,000 in 1988 to 33 in 2018.[6][7] The inactivated polio vaccines are very safe.[2] Mild redness or pain may occur at the site of injection.[2] Oral polio vaccines cause about three cases of vaccine-associated paralytic poliomyelitis per million doses given.[2] This compares with 5,000 cases per million who are paralysed following a polio infection.[8] Both types of vaccine are generally safe to give during pregnancy and in those who have HIV/AIDS but are otherwise well.[2] However, the emergence of circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus (cVDPV), a form of the vaccine virus that has reverted to causing poliomyelitis, has led to the development of novel oral polio vaccine type 2 (nOPV2) which aims to make the vaccine safer and thus stop further outbreaks of cVDPV.[9] The first successful demonstration of a polio vaccine was by Hilary Koprowski in 1950, with a live attenuated virus which people drank.[10] The vaccine was not approved for use in the United States, but was used successfully elsewhere.[10] The success of an inactivated (killed) polio vaccine, developed by Jonas Salk, was announced in 1955.[2][11] Another attenuated live oral polio vaccine was developed by Albert Sabin and came into commercial use in 1961.[2][12] Polio vaccine is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines.[13] Interruption of person-to-person transmission of the virus by vaccination is important in global polio eradication,[14] since no long-term carrier state exists for poliovirus in individuals with normal immune function, polio viruses have no non-primate reservoir in nature,[15] and survival of the virus in the environment for an extended period of time appears to be remote. There are two types of vaccine: inactivated polio vaccine (IPV) and oral polio vaccine (OPV). When the IPV (injection) is used, 90% or more of individuals develop protective antibodies to all three serotypes of polio virus after two doses of inactivated polio vaccine (IPV), and at least 99% are immune to polio virus following three doses. The duration of immunity induced by IPV is not known with certainty, although a complete series is thought to provide protection for many years.[16] IPV replaced the oral vaccine in many developed countries in the 1990s mainly due to the (small) risk of vaccine-derived polio in the oral vaccine.[17][18] Oral polio vaccines were easier to administer than IPV, as it eliminated the need for sterile syringes and therefore was more suitable for mass vaccination campaigns. OPV also provided longer-lasting immunity than the Salk vaccine, as it provides both humoral immunity and cell-mediated immunity.[19] One dose of trivalent OPV produces immunity to all three poliovirus serotypes in roughly 50% of recipients.[20] Three doses of live-attenuated OPV produce protective antibodies to all three poliovirus types in more than 95% of recipients. As with other live-virus vaccines, immunity initiated by OPV is probably lifelong.[16] OPV produces excellent immunity in the intestine, the primary site of wild poliovirus entry, which helps prevent infection with wild virus in areas where the virus is endemic.[21] The oral administration does not require special medical equipment or extensive training. Attenuated poliovirus derived from the oral polio vaccine is excreted for a few days after vaccination, potentially infecting and thus indirectly inducing immunity in unvaccinated individuals, and thus amplifying the effects of the doses delivered.[22] Taken together, these advantages have made it the favored vaccine of many countries, and it has long been preferred by the global eradication initiative.[23] The primary disadvantage of OPV derives from its inherent nature. As an attenuated but active virus, it can induce vaccine-associated paralytic poliomyelitis (VAPP) in approximately one individual per every 2.7 million doses administered.[23] The live virus can persist circulate in under-vaccinated populations (termed either variant poliovirus or circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus, cVDPV) and over time can revert to a neurovirulent form causing paralytic polio.[23] This genetic reversal of the pathogen to a virulent form takes a considerable time and does not affect the person who was originally vaccinated. With wild polio cases at record lows, 2017 was the first year where more cases of cVDPV were recorded than the wild poliovirus.[24] Until recent times, a trivalent OPV containing all three virus strains was used, and had nearly eradicated polio infection worldwide.[25] With the complete eradication of wild poliovirus type 2[26] this was phased out in 2016 and replaced with bivalent vaccine containing just types 1 and 3, supplemented with monovalent type 2 OPV in regions where cVDPV type 2 was known to circulate.[23] The switch to the bivalent vaccine and associated missing immunity against type 2 strains, among other factors, led to outbreaks of circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 2 (cVDPV2), which increased from 2 cases in 2016 to 1037 cases in 2020.[27] A novel OPV2 vaccine (nOPV2) which has been genetically modified to reduce the likelihood of disease-causing activating mutations was granted emergency licencing in 2021, and subsequently full licensure in December 2023.[28] This has greater genetic stability than the traditional oral vaccine and is less likely to revert to a virulent form.[29][9] Genetically stabilised vaccines targeting poliovirus types 1 and 3 are in development, with the intention that these will eventually completely replace the Sabin vaccines.[30] In countries with endemic polio or where the risk of imported cases is high, the WHO recommends OPV vaccine at birth followed by a primary series of three OPV doses and at least one IPV dose starting at 6 weeks of age, with a minimum of 4 weeks between OPV doses. In countries with >90% immunization coverage and low risk of importation, the WHO recommends one or two IPV doses starting at 2 months of age followed by at least two OPV doses, with the doses separated by 4–8 weeks depending on the risk of exposure. In countries with the highest levels of coverage and the lowest risks of importation and transmission, the WHO recommends a primary series of three IPV injections, with a booster dose after an interval of six months or more if the first dose was administered before 2 months of age.[2] The inactivated polio vaccines are very safe. Mild redness or pain may occur at the site of injection. They are generally safe to be given to pregnant women and those who have HIV/AIDS but are otherwise well.[2] Inactivated polio vaccine can cause an allergic reaction in a few people since the vaccine contains trace amounts of antibiotics, streptomycin, polymyxin B, and neomycin. It should not be given to anyone who has an allergic reaction to these medicines. Signs and symptoms of an allergic reaction, which usually appear within minutes or a few hours after receiving the injected vaccine, include breathing difficulties, weakness, hoarseness or wheezing, heart rate fluctuations, skin rash and dizziness.[32] A potential adverse effect of the Sabin OPV is caused by its known potential to recombine to a form that causes neurological infection and paralysis.[33] The Sabin OPV results in vaccine-associated paralytic poliomyelitis (VAPP) in approximately one individual per every 2.7 million doses administered, with symptoms identical to wild polio.[23] Due to its improved genetic stability, the novel OPV (nOPV) has a reduced risk of this occurring.[34] In 1960, the rhesus monkey kidney cells used to prepare the poliovirus vaccines were determined to be infected with the simian virus-40 (SV40),[35] which was also discovered in 1960 and is a naturally occurring virus that infects monkeys. In 1961, SV40 was found to cause tumors in rodents.[36] More recently, the virus was found in certain forms of cancer in humans, for instance brain and bone tumors, pleural and peritoneal mesothelioma, and some types of non-Hodgkin lymphoma.[37][38] However, SV40 has not been determined to cause these cancers.[39] SV40 was found to be present in stocks of the injected form of the IPV in use between 1955 and 1963.[35] It is not found in the OPV form.[35] Over 98 million Americans received one or more doses of polio vaccine between 1955 and 1963 when a proportion of vaccine was contaminated with SV40; an estimated 10–30 million Americans may have received a dose of vaccine contaminated with SV40.[35] Later analysis suggested that vaccines produced by the former Soviet bloc countries until 1980, and used in the USSR, China, Japan, and several African countries, may have been contaminated, meaning hundreds of millions more may have been exposed to SV40.[40] In 1998, the National Cancer Institute undertook a large study, using cancer case information from the institute's SEER database. The published findings from the study revealed no increased incidence of cancer in persons who may have received vaccine containing SV40.[41] Another large study in Sweden examined cancer rates of 700,000 individuals who had received potentially contaminated polio vaccine as late as 1957; the study again revealed no increased cancer incidence between persons who received polio vaccines containing SV40 and those who did not.[42] The question of whether SV40 causes cancer in humans remains controversial, however, and the development of improved assays for detection of SV40 in human tissues will be needed to resolve the controversy.[39] During the race to develop an oral polio vaccine, several large-scale human trials were undertaken. By 1958, the National Institutes of Health had determined that OPV produced using the Sabin strains were the safest.[43] Between 1957 and 1960, however, Hilary Koprowski continued to administer his vaccine around the world. In Africa, the vaccines were administered to roughly one million people in the Belgian territories (now the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Rwanda, and Burundi).[44][45] The results of these human trials have been controversial,[46] and unfounded accusations in the 1990s arose that the vaccine had created the conditions necessary for transmission of simian immunodeficiency virus from chimpanzees to humans, causing HIV/AIDS. These hypotheses, however, have been conclusively refuted.[44] By 2004, cases of poliomyelitis in Africa had been reduced to just a small number of isolated regions in the western portion of the continent, with sporadic cases elsewhere. Recent local opposition to vaccination campaigns have evolved due to lack of adequate information,[47][48] often relating to fears that the vaccine might induce sterility.[49] The disease has since resurged in Nigeria and in several other African nations without necessary information, which epidemiologists believe is due to refusals by certain local populations to allow their children to receive the polio vaccine.[50] The Salk vaccine, IPV, is based on three wild, virulent reference strains, Mahoney (type 1 poliovirus), MEF-1 (type 2 poliovirus), and Saukett (type 3 poliovirus), grown in a type of monkey kidney tissue culture (Vero cell line), which are then inactivated with formalin.[51] The injected Salk vaccine confers IgG-mediated immunity in the bloodstream, which prevents polio infection from progressing to viremia and protects the motor neurons, thus eliminating the risk of bulbar polio and post-polio syndrome. In the United States, vaccine is administered along with the tetanus, diphtheria, and acellular pertussis vaccines (DTaP) and a pediatric dose of hepatitis B vaccine.[20] In the UK, IPV is combined with tetanus, diphtheria, pertussis, and Haemophilus influenzae type b vaccines.[52] OPV is an attenuated vaccine, produced by the passage of the virus through nonhuman cells at a subphysiological temperature, which produces spontaneous mutations in the viral genome.[53] Oral polio vaccines were developed by several groups, one of which was led by Albert Sabin. Other groups, led by Hilary Koprowski and H.R. Cox, developed their own attenuated vaccine strains. In 1958, the National Institutes of Health created a special committee on live polio vaccines. The various vaccines were carefully evaluated for their ability to induce immunity to polio, while retaining a low incidence of neuropathogenicity in monkeys. Large-scale clinical trials performed in the Soviet Union in late 1950s to early 1960s by Mikhail Chumakov and his colleagues demonstrated safety and high efficacy of the vaccine.[54][55] Based on these results, the Sabin strains were chosen for worldwide distribution.[43] Fifty-seven nucleotide substitutions distinguish the attenuated Sabin 1 strain from its virulent parent (the Mahoney serotype), two nucleotide substitutions attenuate the Sabin 2 strain, and 10 substitutions are involved in attenuating the Sabin 3 strain.[51] The primary attenuating factor common to all three Sabin vaccines is a mutation located in the virus's internal ribosome entry site,[56] which alters stem-loop structures and reduces the ability of poliovirus to translate its RNA template within the host cell.[57] The attenuated poliovirus in the Sabin vaccine replicates very efficiently in the gut, the primary site of infection and replication, but is unable to replicate efficiently within nervous system tissue. In 1961, type 1 and 2 monovalent oral poliovirus vaccine (MOPV) was licensed, and in 1962, type 3 MOPV was licensed. In 1963, trivalent OPV (TOPV) was licensed, and became the vaccine of choice in the United States and most other countries of the world, largely replacing the inactivated polio vaccine.[58] A second wave of mass immunizations led to a further dramatic decline in the number of polio cases. Between 1962 and 1965, about 100 million Americans (roughly 56% of the population at that time) received the Sabin vaccine. The result was a substantial reduction in the number of poliomyelitis cases, even from the much-reduced levels following the introduction of the Salk vaccine.[59] OPV is usually provided in vials containing 10–20 doses of vaccine. A single dose of oral polio vaccine (usually two drops) contains 1,000,000 infectious units of Sabin 1 (effective against PV1), 100,000 infectious units of the Sabin 2 strain, and 600,000 infectious units of Sabin 3. The vaccine contains small traces of antibiotics—neomycin and streptomycin—but does not contain preservatives.[60] In a generic sense, vaccination works by priming the immune system with an 'immunogen'. Stimulating immune response, by use of an infectious agent, is known as immunization. The development of immunity to polio efficiently blocks person-to-person transmission of wild poliovirus, thereby protecting both individual vaccine recipients and the wider community.[14] The development of two polio vaccines led to the first modern mass inoculations. The last cases of paralytic poliomyelitis caused by endemic transmission of wild virus in the United States occurred in 1979, with an outbreak among the Amish in several Midwest states.[20] In the 1930s, poliovirus was perceived as especially terrifying, as little was known of how the disease was transmitted or how it could be prevented. This virus was also notable for primarily impacting affluent children, making it a prime target for vaccine development, despite its relatively low mortality and morbidity.[61] Despite this, the community of researchers in the field thus far had largely observed an informal moratorium on any vaccine development as it was perceived to present too high a risk for too little likelihood of success.[62][63] This shifted in the early 1930s when American groups took up the challenge: Maurice Brodie led a team from the public health laboratory of the city of New York and John A. Kolmer collaborated with the Research Institute of Cutaneous Medicine in Philadelphia. The rivalry between these two researchers lent itself to a race-like mentality which, combined with a lack of oversight of medical studies, was reflected in the methodology and outcomes of each of these early vaccine development ventures.[64][65][61] Kolmer began his vaccine development project in 1932 and ultimately focused on producing an attenuated or live virus vaccine. Inspired by the success of vaccines for rabies and yellow fever, he hoped to use a similar process to denature the polio virus.[64] In order to go about attenuating his polio vaccine, he repeatedly passed the virus through monkeys.[66] Using methods of production that were later described as \"hair-raisingly amateurish, the therapeutic equivalent of bath-tub gin,\"[67] Kolmer ground the spinal cords of his infected monkeys and soaked them in a salt solution. He then filtered the solution through mesh, treated it with ricinolate, and refrigerated the product for 14 days[64] to ultimately create what would later be prominently critiqued as a \"veritable witches brew\".[68] In keeping with the norms of the time, Kolmer completed a relatively small animal trial with 42 monkeys before proceeding to self experimentation in 1934.[63] He tested his vaccine upon himself, his two children, and his assistant.[63] He gave his vaccine to just 23 more children before declaring it safe and sending it out to doctors and health departments for a larger test of efficacy.[63] By April 1935, he was able to report having tested the vaccine on 100 children without ill effect.[69] Kolmer's first formal presentation of results would not come about until November 1935 where he presented the results of 446 children and adults he had vaccinated with his attenuated vaccine.[69] He also reported that together the Research Institute of Cutaneous Medicine and the Merrell Company of Cincinnati (the manufacturer who held the patent for his ricinoleating process) had distributed 12,000 doses of vaccine to some 700 physicians across the United States and Canada.[69] Kolmer did not describe any monitoring of this experimental vaccination program nor did he provide these physicians with instructions in how to administer the vaccine or how to report side effects.[69] Kolmer dedicated the bulk of his publications thereafter to explaining what he believed to be the cause of the 10+ reported cases of paralytic polio following vaccination, in many cases in towns where no polio outbreak had occurred.[69][70] Six of these cases had been fatal.[69] Kolmer had no control group but asserted that many more children would have gotten sick.[70] At nearly the same time as Kolmer's project, Maurice Brodie had joined immunologist William H. Park at the New York City Health Department where they worked together on poliovirus. With the aid of grant funding from the President's Birthday Ball Commission (a predecessor to what would become the March of Dimes), Brodie was able to pursue development of an inactivated or \"killed virus\" vaccine. Brodie's process also began by grinding the spinal cords of infectious monkeys and then treating the cords with various germicides,[71] ultimately finding a solution of formaldehyde to be the most effective. By 1 June 1934, Brodie was able to publish his first scholarly article describing his successful induction of immunity in three monkeys with inactivated polio virus.[72][73] Through continued study on an additional 26 monkeys, Brodie ultimately concluded that administration of live virus vaccine tended to result in humoral immunity while administration of killed virus vaccine tended to result in tissue immunity.[69] Soon after, following a similar protocol to Kolmer, Brodie proceeded with self experimentation upon himself and his co-workers at the NYC Health Department laboratory.[63] Brodie's progress was eagerly covered by popular press as the public hoped for a successful vaccine to become available.[73] Such reporting did not make mention of the 12 children in a New York City Asylum who were subjected to early safety trials.[63] As none of the subjects experienced ill effects, Park, described by contemporaries as \"never one to let grass grow under his feet,\"[74] declared the vaccine safe.[66] When a severe polio outbreak overwhelmed Kern County, California it became the first trial site for the new vaccine on very short notice. Between November 1934 - May 1935, over 1,500 doses of the vaccine were administered in Kern County. While initial results were very promising, insufficient staffing and poor protocol design left Brodie open to criticism when he published the California results in August 1935.[73][69] Through private physicians, Brodie also conducted a broader field study, including 9,000 children who received the vaccine and 4,500 age- and location-matched controls who did not receive a vaccine. Again, results were promising. Of those who received the vaccine, only a few went on to develop polio. Most had been exposed prior to vaccination and none had received the full series of vaccine doses being studied.[69] Additionally, a polio epidemic in Raleigh, North Carolina provided an opportunity for the U.S. Public Health Service to conduct a highly structured trial of the Brodie vaccine using funding from the Birthday Ball Commission.[66][69] While their work was ongoing, the larger community of bacteriologists began to raise concerns regarding the safety and efficacy of the new poliovirus vaccines.[62] At this time there was very little oversight of medical studies, and ethical treatment of study participants largely relied upon moral pressure from peer academic scientists.[64] Brodie's inactivated vaccines faced scrutiny from many who felt killed virus vaccines could not be efficacious. While researchers were able to replicate the tissue immunity he had produced in his animal trials, prevailing wisdom was that humoral immunity was essential for an efficacious vaccine.[69] Kolmer directly questioned the killed virus approach in scholarly journals.[71] Kolmer's studies however had raised even more concern with increasing reports of children becoming paralysed following vaccination with his live virus vaccine and notably, with paralysis beginning at the arm rather than the foot in many cases.[75] Both Kolmer and Brodie were called to present their research at the Annual Meeting of the American Public Health Association in Milwaukee WI in October 1935.[62] Additionally, Thomas M. Rivers was asked to discuss each of the presented papers as a prominent critic of the vaccine development effort.[62] This resulted in the APHA arranging a Symposium on Poliomyelitis to be delivered at the Annual Meeting of their Southern Branch the following month.[62] It was during the discussion at this meeting that James Leake of the U.S. Public Health Service stood to immediately present clinical evidence that the Kolmer vaccine had caused several deaths and then allegedly accused Kolmer of being a murderer.[62] As Rivers recalled in his oral history, \"All hell broke loose, and it seemed as if everybody was trying to talk at the same time....Jimmy Leake used the strongest language that I have ever heard used at a scientific meeting.\"[62] In response to the attacks from all sides, Brodie was reported to have stood up and stated, \"It looks as though, according to Dr. Rivers, my vaccine is no good, and, according to Dr. Leake, Dr Kolmer's is dangerous.\"[62] Kolmer simply responded by stating, \"Gentlemen, this is one time I wish the floor would open up and swallow me.\"[62] Ultimately, Kolmer's live vaccine was undoubtedly shown to be dangerous and had already been withdrawn in September 1935 prior to the Milwaukee meeting.[75][70][69] While the consensus of the symposium was largely skeptical of the efficacy of Brodie's vaccine, its safety was not in question and the recommendation was for a much larger well-controlled trial.[75] However, when three children became ill with paralytic polio following a dose of the vaccine, the directors of the Warm Springs Foundation in Georgia (acting as the primary funders for the project) requested it be withdrawn in December 1935.[75] Following its withdrawal, the previously observed moratorium on human poliomyelitis vaccine development resumed and there would not be another attempt for nearly 20 years.[69][70] While Brodie had arguably made the most progress in the pursuit of a poliovirus vaccine, he suffered the most significant career repercussions due to his status as a less widely known researcher.[73] Modern researchers recognize that Brodie may well have developed an effective polio vaccine, however the basic science and technology of the time was insufficient to understand and utilize this breakthrough.[69] Brodie's work using formalin-inactivated virus would later become the basis for the Salk vaccine, but he would not live to see this success.[69] Brodie was fired from his position within three months of the symposium's publication.[69] While he was able to find another laboratory position, he died of a heart attack only three years later at age 36.[69][73] By contrast, Park, who was believed in the community to be reaching senility at this point in his older age, was able to retire from his position with honors[62] prior to his death in 1939.[66] Kolmer, already an established and well respected researcher, returned to Temple University as a professor of medicine.[69] Kolmer had a very productive career, receiving multiple awards, and publishing countless papers, articles, and textbooks up until his retirement in 1957.[66][62][70][76] A breakthrough came in 1948 when a research group headed by John Enders at the Children's Hospital Boston successfully cultivated the poliovirus in human tissue in the laboratory.[77] This group had recently successfully grown mumps in cell culture. In March 1948, Thomas H. Weller was attempting to grow varicella virus in embryonic lung tissue. He had inoculated the planned number of tubes when he noticed that there were a few unused tubes. He retrieved a sample of mouse brain infected with poliovirus and added it to the remaining test tubes, on the off chance that the virus might grow. The varicella cultures failed to grow, but the polio cultures were successful. This development greatly facilitated vaccine research and ultimately allowed for the development of vaccines against polio. Enders and his colleagues, Thomas H. Weller and Frederick C. Robbins, were recognized in 1954 for their efforts with a Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine.[78] Other important advances that led to the development of polio vaccines were: the identification of three poliovirus serotypes (Poliovirus type 1 – PV1, or Mahoney; PV2, Lansing; and PV3, Leon); the finding that prior to paralysis, the virus must be present in the blood; and the demonstration that administration of antibodies in the form of gamma globulin protects against paralytic polio.[62][51][79] During the early 1950s, polio rates in the U.S. were above 25,000 annually; in 1952 and 1953, the U.S. experienced an outbreak of 58,000 and 35,000 polio cases, respectively, up from a typical number of some 20,000 a year, with deaths in those years numbering 3,200 and 1,400.[80] Amid this U.S. polio epidemic, millions of dollars were invested in finding and marketing a polio vaccine by commercial interests, including Lederle Laboratories in New York under the direction of H. R. Cox. Also working at Lederle was Polish-born virologist and immunologist Hilary Koprowski of the Wistar Institute in Philadelphia, who tested the first successful polio vaccine, in 1950.[10][45] His vaccine, however, being a live attenuated virus taken orally, was still in the research stage and would not be ready for use until five years after Jonas Salk's polio vaccine (a dead-virus injectable vaccine) had reached the market. Koprowski's attenuated vaccine was prepared by successive passages through the brains of Swiss albino mice. By the seventh passage, the vaccine strains could no longer infect nervous tissue or cause paralysis. After one to three further passages on rats, the vaccine was deemed safe for human use.[43][81] On 27 February 1950, Koprowski's live, attenuated vaccine was tested for the first time on an 8-year-old boy living at Letchworth Village, an institution for physically and mentally disabled people located in New York. After the child had no side effects, Koprowski enlarged his experiment to include 19 other children.[43][82] The first effective polio vaccine was developed in 1952 by Jonas Salk and a team at the University of Pittsburgh that included Julius Youngner, Byron Bennett, L. James Lewis, and Lorraine Friedman, which required years of subsequent testing. Salk went on CBS radio to report a successful test on a small group of adults and children on 26 March 1953; two days later, the results were published in JAMA.[70] Leone N. Farrell invented a key laboratory technique that enabled the mass production of the vaccine by a team she led in Toronto.[83][84] Beginning 23 February 1954, the vaccine was tested at Arsenal Elementary School and the Watson Home for Children in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.[85] Salk's vaccine was then used in a test called the Francis Field Trial, led by Thomas Francis, the largest medical experiment in history at that time. The test began with about 4,000 children at Franklin Sherman Elementary School in McLean, Virginia,[86][87] and eventually involved 1.8 million children, in 44 states from Maine to California.[88] By the conclusion of the study, roughly 440,000 received one or more injections of the vaccine, about 210,000 children received a placebo, consisting of harmless culture media, and 1.2 million children received no vaccination and served as a control group, who would then be observed to see if any contracted polio.[43] The results of the field trial were announced 12 April 1955 (the tenth anniversary of the death of President Franklin D. Roosevelt, whose paralytic illness was generally believed to have been caused by polio). The Salk vaccine had been 60–70% effective against PV1 (poliovirus type 1), over 90% effective against PV2 and PV3, and 94% effective against the development of bulbar polio.[89] Soon after Salk's vaccine was licensed in 1955, children's vaccination campaigns were launched. In the U.S., following a mass immunization campaign promoted by the March of Dimes, the annual number of polio cases fell from 35,000 in 1953 to 5,600 by 1957.[90] By 1961 only 161 cases were recorded in the United States.[91] A week before the announcement of the Francis Field Trial results in April 1955, Pierre Lépine at the Pasteur Institute in Paris had also announced an effective polio vaccine.[92][93] In April 1955, soon after mass polio vaccination began in the US, the Surgeon General began to receive reports of patients who contracted paralytic polio about a week after being vaccinated with Salk polio vaccine from the Cutter pharmaceutical company, with the paralysis starting in the limb the vaccine was injected into.[94] The Cutter vaccine had been used in vaccinating 409,000 children in the western and midwestern United States.[95] Later investigations showed that the Cutter vaccine had caused 260 cases of polio, killing 11.[94] In response, the Surgeon General pulled all polio vaccines made by Cutter Laboratories from the market, but not before 260 cases of paralytic illness had occurred. Eli Lilly, Parke-Davis, Pitman-Moore and Wyeth polio vaccines were also reported to have paralyzed numerous children. It was soon discovered that some lots of Salk polio vaccine made by Cutter, Wyeth, and the other labs had not been properly inactivated, allowing live poliovirus into more than 100,000 doses of vaccine. In May 1955, the National Institutes of Health and Public Health Services established a Technical Committee on Poliomyelitis Vaccine to test and review all polio vaccine lots and advise the Public Health Service as to which lots should be released for public use. These incidents reduced public confidence in polio vaccine, leading to a drop in vaccination rates.[96] At the same time that Salk was testing his vaccine, both Albert Sabin and Hilary Koprowski continued working on developing a vaccine using live virus. During a meeting in Stockholm to discuss polio vaccines in November 1955, Sabin presented results obtained on a group of 80 volunteers, while Koprowski read a paper detailing the findings of a trial enrolling 150 people.[43] Sabin and Koprowski both eventually succeeded in developing vaccines. Because of the commitment to the Salk vaccine in America, Sabin and Koprowski both did their testing outside the United States, Sabin in Mexico[53] and the Soviet Union,[97] Koprowski in the Congo and Poland.[45] In 1957, Sabin developed a trivalent vaccine containing attenuated strains of all three types of poliovirus.[97] In 1959, ten million children in the Soviet Union received the Sabin oral vaccine. For this work, Sabin was given the medal of the Order of Friendship of Peoples, described as the Soviet Union's highest civilian honor.[98] Sabin's oral vaccine using live virus came into commercial use in 1961.[2] Once Sabin's oral vaccine became widely available, it supplanted Salk's injected vaccine, which had been tarnished in the public's opinion by the Cutter incident of 1955, in which Salk vaccines improperly prepared by one company resulted in several children dying or becoming paralyzed.[70] An enhanced-potency IPV was licensed in the United States in November 1987, and is currently the vaccine of choice there.[20] The first dose of polio vaccine is given shortly after birth, usually between 1 and 2 months of age, and a second dose is given at 4 months of age.[20] The timing of the third dose depends on the vaccine formulation, but should be given between 6 and 18 months of age.[52] A booster vaccination is given at 4 to 6 years of age, for a total of four doses at or before school entry.[21] In some countries, a fifth vaccination is given during adolescence.[52] Routine vaccination of adults (18 years of age and older) in developed countries is neither necessary nor recommended because most adults are already immune and have a very small risk of exposure to wild poliovirus in their home countries.[20] In 2002, a pentavalent (five-component) combination vaccine (called Pediarix)[99][100] containing IPV was approved for use in the United States.[101][100] A global effort to eradicate polio, led by the World Health Organization (WHO), UNICEF,[102] and the Rotary Foundation, began in 1988, and has relied largely on the oral polio vaccine developed by Albert Sabin and Mikhail Chumakov (Sabin-Chumakov vaccine).[103] Polio was eliminated in the Americas by 1994.[104] The disease was officially eliminated in 36 Western Pacific countries, including China and Australia, in 2000.[105][106] Europe was declared polio-free in 2002.[107] Since January 2011, no cases of the disease have been reported in India, hence in February 2012, the country was taken off the WHO list of polio-endemic countries. In March 2014, India was declared a polio-free country.[108][109][110] Although poliovirus transmission has been interrupted in much of the world, transmission of wild poliovirus does continue and creates an ongoing risk for the importation of wild poliovirus into previously polio-free regions. If importations of poliovirus occur, outbreaks of poliomyelitis may develop, especially in areas with low vaccination coverage and poor sanitation. As a result, high levels of vaccination coverage must be maintained.[104] In November 2013, the WHO announced a polio outbreak in Syria. In response, the Armenian government put out a notice asking Syrian Armenians under age 15 to get the polio vaccine.[111] As of 2014, polio virus had spread to 10 countries, mainly in Africa, Asia, and the Middle East, with Pakistan, Syria, and Cameroon advising vaccinations to outbound travellers.[112] Polio vaccination programs have been resisted by some people in Pakistan, Afghanistan, and Nigeria - the three countries as of 2017 with remaining polio cases. Almost all Muslim religious and political leaders have endorsed the vaccine,[113] but a fringe minority believes that the vaccines are secretly being used for sterilization of Muslims.[50] The fact that the CIA organized a fake vaccination program in 2011 to help find Osama bin Laden is an additional cause of distrust.[114] In 2015, the WHO announced a deal with the Taliban to encourage them to distribute the vaccine in areas they control.[115] However, the Pakistani Taliban was not supportive. On 11 September 2016, two unidentified gunmen associated with the Pakistani Taliban, Jamaat-ul-Ahrar, shot Zakaullah Khan, a doctor who was administering polio vaccines in Pakistan. The leader of the Jamaat-ul-Ahrar claimed responsibility for the shooting and stated that the group would continue this type of attack. Such resistance to and skepticism of vaccinations has consequently slowed down the polio eradication process within the two remaining endemic countries.[114] Travellers who wish to enter or leave certain countries must be vaccinated against polio, usually at most 12 months and at least 4 weeks before crossing the border, and be able to present a vaccination record/certificate at the border checks.[116]: 25–27 Most requirements apply only to travel to or from so-called 'polio-endemic', 'polio-affected', 'polio-exporting', 'polio-transmission', or 'high-risk' countries.[117] As of August 2020, Afghanistan and Pakistan are the only polio-endemic countries in the world (where wild polio has not yet been eradicated).[118] Several countries have additional precautionary polio vaccination travel requirements, for example to and from 'key at-risk countries', which as of December 2020 include China, Indonesia, Mozambique, Myanmar, and Papua New Guinea.[117][119] As of 2015[update], the Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunization supplies the inactivated vaccine to developing countries for as little as €0.75 (about US$0.89) per dose in 10-dose vials.[143] A misconception has been present in Pakistan that polio vaccine contained haram ingredients and could cause impotence and infertility in male children, leading some parents not to have their children vaccinated. This belief is most common in the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province and the FATA region. Attacks on polio vaccination teams have also occurred, thereby hampering international efforts to eradicate polio in Pakistan and globally.[144][145]",

                "content": "Polio can be prevented through immunization. Polio vaccine, given multiple times, almost always protects a child for life. The development of effective vaccines to prevent paralytic polio was one of the major medical breakthroughs of the 20th century. There are six different vaccines to stop polio transmission: If enough people in a community are immunized, the virus will be deprived of susceptible hosts and will die out. High levels of vaccination coverage must be maintained to stop transmission and prevent outbreaks occurring. In May 2012, the World Health Assembly declared the completion of polio eradication a programmatic emergency for global public health and the Polio Eradication and Endgame Strategic Plan 2013-2018 was developed and, in November 2012, endorsed by SAGE. Under objective 2 of the Eradication and Endgame Plan, at least one dose of inactivated poliomyelitis vaccine (IPV) should be introduced into all routine immunization programmes globally, and trivalent oral polio vaccines (tOPV) will be replaced with bivalent (bOPV) in all OPV-using countries. The global \"OPV Switch\" was successfully conducted worldwide in April 2016 – setting the stage for the eventual withdrawal of all OPV. In the new Eradication and Endgame strategy, research is a vital component of the Global Polio Eradication Initiative, providing the necessary evidence to guide the final steps to a lasting polio-free world and beyond. The Global Polio Eradication Initiative coordinates and supports an extensive program of research from a wide range of core scientific disciplines. The research program has two broad objectives: See more at: Polio eradication research This page presents the background information, programmatic considerations, implementation experiences and materials available related to the fractional dose administration of IPV. This is a resource for countries considering the introduction of fractional dose IPV in their routine programmes or in outbreak response. The evidence-base and information presented on this page is also summarized in the following document: English | French As an alternative to the intramuscular injection of a full dose of IPV, countries may consider using fractional doses (1/5 of the full IPV dose) via the intradermal route. In the context of an IPV shortage, countries should consider instituting a 2-dose fractional dose schedule, where feasible, which could ensure that all eligible infants receive IPV, is dose-sparing and results in better immunogenicity than a single full dose of IPV. However, the programmatic and logistic implications of this option must be carefully assessed. A schedule of fractional intradermal doses administered at 6 and 14 weeks ensures early and appropriately-timed protection. The 2 fractional doses should be separated by a minimum interval of 4 weeks. One fractional dose of IPV may be suitable for outbreak response if supplies are limited. Studies have demonstrated that a single fractional dose of IPV (1/5 of the full dose) gives lower seroconversion rates than a single full dose but after 2 fractional doses the rates are similar to those after 2 full doses.Furthermore, 2 fractional doses of IPV, given intradermally at 6 and 14 weeks provide higher seroconversion rates than a single full dose (intramuscular) given at 14 weeks. The following package presents a compilation of all the evidence related to fIPV, to support countries in considering implementing this strategy. fIPV information package fIPV Campaigns Telangana state, India In June 2016, India conducted a mass vaccination campaign using fIPV, reaching 311,064 children aged 6 weeks to 3 years (94% coverage) over a period of 6 days.The success of this campaign indicates that, with appropriate preparation, an emergency response using fIPV can be implemented promptly and effectively. The following paper provides further background on the campaign planning, implementation, monitoring and evaluation. fIPV in Routine Immunization In April 2016, India introduced the use of fractional dose IPV into the routine immunization programme in eight states. In August 2016, the use of fIPV was expanded to an additional eight states and since March 2017 has been scaled up nationwide in all 36 states. In July 2016, Sri Lanka changed to a schedule of 2 fractional doses of IPV in order to maximize the existing vaccine stocks in the country.Bangladesh plans to introduce fractional IPV doses in 2017. Other countries in the South-East Asia Region are also considering a shift to the use of fractional IPV doses in their immunization schedule. In March 2017, the Regional Technical Advisory Group (RTAG) for the Region of the Americas recommended that countries which administer >100 000 doses of IPV annually and have the capacity to adequately train and supervise health-care workers in intradermal injection, should move to a 2-dose fractional dose IPV schedule.",

Battle overwhelming threats OK, here’s the reality: everything, on every planet, wants you dead. This is the life of a Helldiver. School yourself on the diabolical Terminids and the nefarious Automaton Collective. An ancient, “highly advanced” species, desperately seeking to reclaim their former galactic supremacy. These mind-controlling, xenophobic aliens cannot be reasoned with. They must all be killed. The Voteless The Voteless are former loyal citizens of Super Earth, warped by Illuminate experimentation into mindless soldiers for their despotic regime. They have been stripped of something even deeper than their humanity: their capacity to participate in the Democratic process. The Watcher Watchers are the eyes of the Illuminate. These floating droids scan for free-thinking lifeforms, and report them to their masters for enslavement or eradication. Overseer Centuries old, Overseers are formidable, calculating warriors armed with arcane weaponry. They bend the Voteless to their will, using them as expendable shields in a craven attempt to conserve their own numbers. Harvester These spindly machines stalk the battlefield, reaping patriotic innocents with their cycloptic death beam. They see with only one eye, emblematic of the limited, closed-minded perspective of the entire Illuminate species. The ravenous Terminids are guided solely by an instinctive urge to reproduce, spread, and destroy Democracy. They are a fast-evolving plague, a shapeshifting infestation that threatens to devour and disenfranchise every single child on every single planet. Scavenger The brainless Scavenger is the lowliest of Terminids. Upon encountering an agent of Liberty, it emits a piercing scream that attracts nearby bugs in a reflexive attempt to destroy Freedom. Warrior Warriors are the natural end result of a species optimized for mindless expansion. In controlled environments, they have eviscerated innocent baby cows in under a second. One can only imagine what they would do to innocent baby humans. Hunter The pesky Hunters are known to dodge incoming fire with swift leaps. Scientists note that while this behavior might appear intelligent, it is merely a base instinct, akin to a housefly avoiding an incoming swat. Stalker A side effect of Terminid gene splicing research, Stalkers can camouflage themselves almost to the point of invisibility. But nothing can hide from the cleansing light of Freedom forever. Bile Spewer Bile Spewers appeared following unavoidable spills of toxic chemicals on Terminid E-710 farms. The Bile Spewer’s thorax is bloated with several metric tons of corrosive acid, which it vomits in revulsion upon encountering Democracy. Bile Titan The largest known Terminid strain, a single Bile Titan can destroy an entire SEAF platoon on its own. Engagement is not recommended without the support of heavy duty Orbital Stratagems or a high personnel replacement budget. Charger A rushing Charger is nearly impossible to stop, thanks to its meter-thick exoskeleton. Therefore, the recommended response protocol to this situation is the prompt execution of a Rapid Lateral Movement (RLM). Brood Commander Directing its foul brethren with a mixture of pheromone-like spores and authoritarian shrieks, the bloodthirsty Brood Commander is a rare and deadly strain known for its undeniable hatred of the right to vote. The Automatons are mindless, bloodthirsty robots, coded for nothing but murder and socialist violence. Their origins are a mystery, but their unthinking hatred of Freedom makes them a threat to all citizens of Super Earth. Trooper, Raider, Marauder Troopers are little more than guns with legs, base caricatures of consciousness fused to machine guns and rocket launchers. Unlike Super Earth, the bots seem to believe that strapping heavy weaponry to expendable cannon fodder is the solution to every problem. Commissar A crude simulation of military leadership, the Commissar is augmented with slightly faster processing and a crude command subroutine. The Commissar stays out of combat if possible, as despicably cowardly as it is unequivocally non-sentient. Scout Strider The Scout Strider is a machine operated by a machine, a walking turret guided by the limited intelligence of an Automaton Trooper. Another fruitless attempt to ape true intelligence, in this case by exercising mastery over a machine even more primitive than themselves. Berserker A primitive actualization of barbarity, the Berserker has CPUs in each chainsaw that are programmed to solve one problem: closing the space between saw and target as quickly as possible. Devastator The ironclad Devastator seeks to crush opponents of the Automatons’ totalitarian worldview with a diverse array of heinous weaponry: arm-cannons, arm-shields, arm-machineguns and arm-rocket-launchers. Variants: Armcannon (Base), MG/Heavy, Rocket. Hulk As with all Automaton units, the plodding Hulk is brainlessly optimized to do nothing except deliver heavy firepower. If encountered, the recommended protocol for Helldivers is to immediately call in the largest orbital bombardment available. Variants: Autocannon/Rocket, Flame, Rocket. Tank Shamelessly copied from Super Earth tank designs, the Automaton Tank is clearly inferior in such a multitude of aspects that it would be impractical to list them here. Variants: Heavy Cannon, Quad HMG. Dropship Packed to the brim with robotic infantry, Dropships conduct rapid deployment of mindless, mechanized despotism.

In 2024, he was honoured with the IFFI Special Recognition for Contribution to Bharatiya Cinema Award at the 55th IFFI.[12] Allu Arjun endorses a wide number of brands and products, and is a celebrity brand ambassador for the Pro Kabaddi League[13] and for the streaming service Aha.[14][15] Allu Arjun was born on 8 April 1982[a] in a Telugu family to film producer Allu Aravind and Nirmala in Madras (present-day Chennai). His paternal grandfather was the noted film comedian Allu Ramalingaiah who appeared in over 1000 films.[19][20] Their native place is Palakollu of West Godavari district, Andhra Pradesh.[21] Allu Arjun grew up in Chennai before their family moved to Hyderabad in the 1990s.[22][23] Arjun attended St. Patrick’s School in Chennai and obtained degree in Bachelor of Business Administration at MSR College, Hyderabad.[24] He is the second of three children.

Raghavendra Rao with his father Allu Aravind producing, along with C. Ashwini Dutt.[28] Praising his acting performance, Jeevi of Idlebrain criticised his looks in the film and added that \"Arjun should choose roles that amplify his strength and nullify his weaknesses.\"[29] He then appeared in Sukumar's Arya.[30] He plays the eponymous lead, an outgoing and free-spirited boy falling in love with Geetha (Anu Mehta), an introverted girl who is on the shield of another person Ajay (Siva Balaji).[31] The film proved to be his breakthrough, earning a first nomination for the Filmfare Award for Best Actor – Telugu and won the Nandi Special Jury Award and the CineMAA Award for Best Actor (Critics).[32] The film was a critical and commercial success,[33] grossing over ₹30 crore,[34] with a production budget of ₹4 crore.[35] In 2006, the film was dubbed and released in Malayalam in Kerala.

Vinayak's Bunny playing the eponymous lead, a college student.[37] Being successful at the box office, critics praised his efforts, mannerisms and dancing.[38][39] His next film was A. Karunakaran's musical love story Happy.[40][41] The film did well at the box-office especially in the overseas markets.[42] A critic appreciated his dancing skills and performance, but felt that his character is a typical happy-go-lucky guy.[43] He then starred in Puri Jagannadh's action film Desamuduru in which he played the role of Bala Govindam, a fearless journalist who falls for a woman with a darker past.[44] The film was a commercial success, fetching him a Santosham Film Award, a CineMAA Award and his second nomination for the Filmfare Award for Best Actor – Telugu.[45] The same year, he made his second cameo appearance alongside Chiranjeevi, in the song \"Jagadeka Veerudiki\" from the film Shankar Dada Zindabad. His next film was Bhaskar's Parugu, where he played the role of Krishna, a happy-go-lucky man from Hyderabad who helps his friend to elope with his love, only to experience the wrath of the woman's father and the emotional struggle he felt. Idlebrain wrote: \"Allu Arjun is pretty excellent in the first half as the characterization in the first half is vibrant and needs loads of energy. He carried the entire first half on his shoulders. He excelled in the emotional scenes in the second half.\"[46] Writing for Rediff.com, Radhikha Rajamani stated that \"Arjun performs well though he is rather subdued.\"[47] Allu Arjun won his first Filmfare Award for Best Actor – Telugu and his second Nandi Special Jury Award. Allu Arjun next starred in Sukumar's action comedy Arya 2. A spiritual sequel to the romantic action film Arya (2004), he played the role of Arya, an orphan who is behaviourally sick in that he is consumed with possessiveness for his friend Ajay (Navdeep), who never accepts him. The film revolved around the complexities of love–hate relationships and love triangles.[48] His character in the film had shades of grey.[49] Sify wrote that \"Allu Arjun is full of energy as the guy caught in the powerful current of love. Though he plays the part with negative shades, his characterization could evoke a lot of sympathy from the audiences. His dances are mind-blowing and he excels in emotional scenes.\"[50] Oneindia appreciated his dance moves and acting performances, especially the comedy scenes.[51] He received his fourth nomination for the Filmfare Award for Best Actor – Telugu for his performance in the film. He had two releases in 2010. The first was Gunasekhar's Varudu, in which he starred alongside Arya and Bhanu Sri Mehra.[52] The filmreceived mixed reviews from critics and was a box-office bomb.[53][54] His second release of the year was the highly acclaimed hyperlink anthology film Vedam. It was his first A-rated film in India, and the story takes an inspiration from 26/11 Mumbai blasts in Taj Mahal Palace Hotel, Mumbai.[55] He played the role of Anand \"Cable\" Raju, a cable operator hailing from Jubilee Hills (Hyderabad) slum. The film also features Anushka Shetty, Manchu Manoj and Manoj Bajpayee in other prominent roles.[56] His performance received appreciation from film critics,[57] with The Times of India calling it \"scintillating\"[58] and Idlebrain.com calling it as \"best in his career\".[59] A critic also commented that \"He's a good dancer and does justice to his role.\"[60] Another critic wrote that \"Allu Arjun is excellent as the groom who goes all out to get his bride back. His mass dialogues are good in the second half.\"[61] He achieved his second Filmfare Award for Best Actor – Telugu for the performance in the film. He next appeared in V. V. Vinayak's action film Badrinath (2011), in which he played the role of Badri, a modern-day Indian samurai who is assigned to protect the Badrinath Temple by his Guru (Prakash Raj), to whom he is very loyal.[62] Allu Arjun undertook intensive martial arts and sword fighting training in Vietnam[63][64] and marks his first pairing with Tamannaah.[65] He grew his hair out for his look as a warrior in the film.[citation needed] It his second A-rated film in India after Vedam (2010), on the account of graphic action violence.[66] The film completed a 50-day run in 187 cinemas.[67] His performance and character received mixed reviews.[68][69] A critic of The Times of India wrote that \"Arjun hardly has any scope to emote as he was mostly pushed into action scenes and song sequences.\"[70] After Badrinath, he signed Trivikram Srinivas's action comedy film Julayi in 2011.[71] It was released in 2012, in which he played the role of Ravindra Narayan, a street-smart yet spoilt brat whose life takes a drastic turn after he becomes the witness of a huge bank robbery. A critic wrote that \"Allu Arjun puts in a confident performance as the loveable rogue. It's a role that is right up his alley and he carries it off with a characteristic panache. He lights up the screen with his dancing in particular, pulling off some pretty challenging dance moves.\"[72] Riya Chakravarty of NDTV, in her review, stated that \"Arjun has delivered an outstanding performance.\"[73] He was nominated for the SIIMA Award for Best Actor – Telugu, for his performance in the film. The next year, he starred in Puri Jagannadh's action thriller Iddarammayilatho, playing Sanju Reddy, a guitarist with a dark past, alongside Amala Paul and Catherine Tresa. Sangeetha Devi Dundoo of The Hindu praised his performance in the action sequences and dance moves in various songs in the film, adding \"Allu Arjun uses his agility to his advantage in dances and stunt episodes\".[74] Another critic wrote that \"True to his tag of \"stylish star\", Allu Arjun looks trendier than ever before. His character of a guitarist, who is a street performer in Barcelona, was at its best sketchy, and looks completely different from his previous films. He once again proves that he is a good actor and probably because of the action director's meticulous planning, he makes perfect expressions in all the fight scenes.\"[75][76] The film marks his second and last collaboration, with Puri Jagannadh after Desamuduru (2007). In 2014, he appeared in a cameo role in Vamsi Paidipally's action thriller film Yevadu, alongside Kajal Aggarwal.[77][78] Y. Sunita Chowdary of The Hindu, in her review, wrote that \"Allu Arjun shows what an actor can do even in a short role, in the few minutes he packs his experience, internalises the character and makes an impressive exit even as he loses his identity.\"[79] His next film was Surender Reddy's Race Gurram, in which he played Allu Lakshman \"Lucky\" Prasad, a carefree guy.[80] He joined the production of the film in May 2013.[81] The film was successful at the box office, with the film being Allu's first ₹100 crore grosser.[82] Writing to Deccan Chronicle, Suresh Kavirayani felt that Allu Arjun steals the show with his energetic performance and also praised his dancing skills in the film.[83] Ranjani Rajendra too praised his dance moves, comic acting and performance in the action sequences, but felt that the story is predictable and routine.[84] For his performance, he won his third Filmfare Award for Best Actor – Telugu[85] and was nominated for the SIIMA Award for Best Actor – Telugu for the second time after Julayi. Allu Arjun produced and acted in a short film I Am That Change, which was released in August 2014. The film was directed by Sukumar,[86] to spread awareness on individual social responsibility. Upon its release, the short film received viral response online and was acclaimed by many including celebrities for its concept and execution.[87] It was screened in theaters across Andhra Pradesh and Telangana.[88] Allu Arjun next appeared in Trivikram Srinivas's S/O Satyamurthy (2015), which was released on 9 April 2015.[89] The film was a commercial success, with critics praising his performance.[90][91] His performance in the film earned him his seventh nomination for the Filmfare Award for Best Actor – Telugu.

After one year of college basketball with the Kansas Jayhawks, he was drafted third overall by the 76ers in the 2014 NBA draft. The 7-foot (2.13 m) Embiid is a seven-time NBA All-Star, a five-time member of the All-NBA Team, a three-time member of the All-Defensive Team, and a two-time NBA scoring champion. He was named the NBA Most Valuable Player (MVP) in 2023. Embiid also won a gold medal on the 2024 U.S. Olympic team. Multiple foot and knee injuries delayed Embiid's debut for two seasons until 2016–17 when he was named to the NBA All-Rookie First Team despite playing only 31 games. He has nicknamed himself \"the Process\" as an embrace of the era in 76ers history with the same name he played in early in his career.[3][4][5][6] Embiid led the NBA in scoring during the 2021–22 and 2022–23 seasons, becoming the first center to do so since Shaquille O'Neal (2000), and was also the first center since Moses Malone (1982) to average over 30 points per game, while also being the first foreign player to lead the NBA in scoring. Embiid was born in Yaoundé, Cameroon, to military officer Thomas Embiid[7] and his wife, Christine.[8] He played volleyball and soccer[9] in childhood and originally planned to play professional volleyball in Europe[10] but started playing basketball at age 15, modeling his game after NBA Hall of Fame center Hakeem Olajuwon.[7][10] Embiid was discovered at a basketball camp by Luc Mbah a Moute, a fellow native of Yaoundé and an NBA player.[10][11] With Mbah a Moute as his mentor, Embiid moved to the United States at age 16 to devote himself to becoming a professional basketball player.[12] Embiid enrolled at Montverde Academy, Mbah a Moute's alma mater, but transferred after his first year due to a lack of playing time.[10][13] He then attended The Rock School, a Christian academy, in Gainesville, Florida.[13] As a senior, he led their team to a 33–4 record and state championship, averaging 13.0 points, 9.7 rebounds and 1.9 blocks per game.

With these numbers, he became the first player in NBA history to average 40 or more points in a month on 60% field goal shooting.[144] On 2 January 2024, Embiid put up a triple-double with 31 points, 15 rebounds and 10 assists through playing only the first three quarters in a 110–97 win over the Chicago Bulls. He became the first player in NBA history to put up at least 30 points, 15 rebounds and 10 assists in a game without playing in the fourth quarter.[145] On 15 January, Embiid posted 41 points and 10 rebounds in a 124–115 win over the Houston Rockets.

He finished the playoffs averaging a career-high 33.0 points, 10.8 rebounds, and a career-high 5.7 assists.[156] On November 2, 2024, Embiid had shoved a reporter in the locker room following a loss to the Memphis Grizzlies after the columnist had allegedly written an article pertaining Embiid's son as well, as his late brother. Three days later, Embiid received a three-game suspension for the altercation, beginning once he 'is eligible and able to play', as Embiid missed the first several weeks of the regular season due to the management of a left knee ailment stemming from the previous season.[157] On November 21, 2024, it was reported that in an hour-long meeting involving players and coaches, Tyrese Maxey called Embiid out for being regularly late to team activities. Maxey said that Embiid's tardiness affects everyone, from the coaches to the players. [158] Embiid was eligible to compete for the national teams of Cameroon,[159] France and United States.[160] On 7 February 2017, Embiid was named to the preliminary Cameroon team to compete in the 2017 FIBA AfroBasket in the Republic of Congo,[161] with the group qualifier taking place in March, during the NBA regular season. Fellow Cameroon-born NBA player Luc Mbah a Moute has voiced his opinion on Embiid representing his country saying, \"It would be great for our team, our country and Joel\".[162] Embiid ultimately did not play for Cameroon.[163] In July 2022, Embiid was granted citizenship by France as \"a foreigner [...] whose naturalization is of exceptional interest\".[164][165] Later in September, he also became a U.S. citizen.[166] He had spoken to French President Emmanuel Macron on the phone, as Macron had courted him to play for the France national team.[167] Embiid committed to play for the 2024 U.S. Olympic team in Paris, stating that he wanted to win a gold medal for his son, who was born in the U.S.[160] After talking to my family, I knew it had to be Team USA. I want to play with my brothers in the league. I want to play for my fans because they’ve been incredible since the day I came here. But most of all, I want to honor my son who was born in the US. I want my boy to know I played my first Olympics for him.[168] During the Olympics, Embiid was frequently booed by French fans over his decision to play for the United States.[169][170] He helped Team USA win the gold medal, and in five games, he averaged 11.2 points, 3.8 rebounds, 1.4 assists and a block per game while shooting 56.8% from the field.[171] Embiid has not ruled out playing for Cameroon in the future. However, he would need permission from FIBA and the United States men's national basketball team in order to do so in 2028.[172] Embiid's younger brother, Arthur, died on 16 October 2014, in a car crash in his home country of Cameroon.[173][174] He also has a younger sister.[175] In addition to English, Embiid is fluent in French and Basaa.[176] Embiid has been in a relationship with Brazilian model Anne de Paula since 2018.[177] In September 2020, she gave birth to a son.[178] The couple was married in July 2023.[179] Embiid is known for his playful personality and social media presence, particularly for his trolling.[180][181][182] He is Catholic and a teetotaler.[180][183] Embiid is an avid supporter of Real Madrid CF, frequently posting on Twitter during the team's matches.[184] In March 2021, Embiid donated $100,000, his 2021 NBA All-Star Game winnings, to fight homelessness in Philadelphia,[185] for which he received the NBA Cares Community Assist Award in April 2021.[186][187]",

                "content": "Joel Embiid Philadelphia 76ers I swear to God, my life is a movie. It’s a movie. I know corny dudes are always saying that because they bought like an SUV or whatever, but I swear I can say it for real. I’ll prove it to you like this…. This is a real story. Hand to God. When I came over from Cameroon at 16, I didn’t know any English, didn’t know a single person in America, didn’t really understand the culture except for like basic hip-hop. And I know people sort of know my story, but I don’t think they really understand how crazy it is. Because I had just started playing basketball literally — literally — three months before I got an offer to come play high school ball in Florida. I could dunk, but I had no handle. So I went to the practice on the first day, and I was so bad that the coach kicked me out of the gym. I didn’t know what I was doing. I was so skinny, so soft. But the worst part was that all my own teammates were seriously pointing and laughing at me, like the asshole kids in the movies about high school. It was crazy. I’m looking at these dudes, not really understanding what they’re even saying, like, Damn guys, come on, let’s just trust the process here. And they’re just like, “LOL NAH YOU SUCK.” Man, I went back to my dorm and cried. I was like, This is crazy. What am I even doing here? I can’t play. I’m going home. But then I was sitting in my room listening to Lil Wayne or something, in my feelings, thinking about these dudes making fun of me, and suddenly my competitive side took over. I got really, really motivated. Whenever people say I can’t do something, I actually love it. It makes me want to prove them wrong so bad. So I said to myself, Alright, I’m literally just going to work and work in the gym until I’m good. KOBE. I got better and better, especially around the rim, but I still couldn’t shoot. So I started working out with one of my teammates, Michael Frazier II. Remember him? This dude was a shooter. Like, killing it. He hit 11 threes in a game once for Florida. So after practice, I’d do these three-point drills with him, and of course, he’s smashing me. I have no form, no fundamentals. I’m jacking shit up. But I just can’t take losing to this dude every day. I’m so competitive that I’m like, I gotta beat this guy. I gotta find a way. Young Joel Embiid in 2011 when I came over to the states ha #SwagWasAss #NoHairline #iWasAbout150Pounds #MyBestFriendWasVideoGames #DidntKnowEnglish #BasketballWasMyWorstNightmareCuzISucked A post shared by Joel \"The Process\" Embiid (@joelembiid) on Apr 25, 2015 at 6:56pm PDT So I’m chilling one night, and I go on YouTube, and I’m thinking I’m about to figure this shooting thing out. I go to the search box like…. HOW TO SHOOT 3 POINTERS. Nah. HOW TO SHOOT GOOD FORM Nah. Then the light bulb went off, man. I typed in the magic words. WHITE PEOPLE SHOOTING 3 POINTERS. Listen, I know it’s a stereotype, but have you ever seen a normal, 30-year-old white guy shoot a three-pointer? That elbow is tucked, man. The knees are bent. The follow-through is perfect. Always. You know how in America, there’s always an older guy wearing like EVERLAST sweat-shorts at the court? That guy is always a problem. His J is always wet. Those are the guys I learned from on YouTube. Just random people shooting threes with perfect form. Me and Michael would play after practice for hours, and I’d just try to imitate how they shot the ball, and I started being able to compete. It was crazy, because getting some range changed my whole game. Teams couldn’t play off me anymore, and I started doing a lot better. I know people are going to think I’m exaggerating, but that’s a real story. I didn’t even really know who J.J. Redick was at that point. I barely knew anything about the NBA because I could never watch it in Cameroon. And no, I don’t mean that like we were too poor and we didn’t have a TV. We had a TV. We had a pretty normal life. Americans have crazy ideas about Africa, like its all one big country. WHITE PEOPLE SHOOTING 3 POINTERS. No, the reason I couldn’t watch the NBA is because my mom was super, super strict about school. She didn’t play around. I could never stay up to watch the games. Every single day it was: Wake up, eat, go to school from seven to five, run home and take a nap, wake up and eat dinner, then study until like midnight. I’m telling you — school is too easy in America, man. In Cameroon, it’s crazy. Elementary school is like college. I didn’t even have any friends because all I ever did was sleep and do homework. I remember when Cameroon had the Golden Generation at the 2002 World Cup, I was eight years old, so I was begging my mom and dad to let me play soccer. But they weren’t having it. So when I got to be older, I got a little more rebellious, and I’d sneak out of the house to play. There was like an hour window after school when my mom wasn’t home yet, and the soccer field was right next to our house, so I had this whole scheme. I’d run home after school and put my bookbag by the kitchen table and then I’d open up a science book or whatever. And I’d have that thing all highlighted and everything, like I was really grinding. Papers and pens everywhere. Then once that was all set up, I’d run back out to the field. I literally got so good that I could hear the specific sound of my mom’s car coming down the street. If I was at the other end of the field and I was too far away, whoever was playing keeper would see her car coming and be yelling like, “Joel! Joellllllllllll! Your mom’s coming, bro! Run!” And I’d sprint into the back of our house, hide my shoes and sit down at the table, like sweating. Like I was thinking so hard about science that I was about to pass out. I had like 25 seconds before my mom parked her car, took off her shoes and got inside to make sure I was studying. I’d be sitting there with a glass of juice or whatever, like, “Hello, Mom. It’s me, Your Good Son.” The first time I ever watched an NBA game was the 2009 Finals. Lakers vs. Magic. Dwight. Pau. Odom. KOBE. I had never seen anything like that. I was watching those dudes shoot like 100% from the floor. Everything was going in. The way they moved, and the athleticism, I thought it was the coolest thing in the world. I had that moment like, I just wanna do that. I begged my mom and dad. I begged for a year. My dad was like, “Nobody in Cameroon plays basketball. You can play volleyball.” I’m like, “Yo, volleyball?” By that time, I had started hearing some American hip-hop on the internet, and I’d be trying to sing the words to look cool, even though I didn’t know any English. I’d be walking around school singing that Lil’ Bow Wow and Ciara song. Remember that? All I could say in English was like “Hello, good morning,” and then “I AIN’T NEVER HAD NOBODY DO ME LIKE YOU.” That was my exposure to American culture — Bow Wow, Kanye and Kobe. Sometimes I’d go to this court by my house where guys would play pickup, and every time I’d shoot the ball, I’d literally yell out, “KOBE!” Imagine it. I’m out there shooting bricks, yelling out Kobe, on a busted hoop in Cameroon. Seven years later, I was playing Kobe. It’s a movie. It’s really a movie. Even when people hear the story, they think like, “Oh, they discovered this crazy talent in Africa, and this guy came over and started killing it. Kansas. NBA. Boom.” Nah. You don’t even understand. When I was 16, Luc Mbah a Moute invited me to come to the basketball camp that he puts on every summer in Cameroon, and the only reason was because I was like 6 foot 10. I was so nervous that I didn’t even show up the first day. The second day, I showed up, they put me in the game and I dunked on somebody. I think I was so scared that my adrenaline took over or something. Straight away, first game. And I mean — not just dunked. Dunked on somebody. I was like, OH SHIT. I mean, I was still terrible, but it was enough. They could see something in me. I got a spot at the Basketball Without Borders camp in South Africa. Two months later, I was on a plane to Florida to go to high school in America. A year later, I committed to Kansas. I didn’t even know what March Madness was. I didn’t know who the good teams were. The only reason I chose Kansas was because Luc told me, “Kansas is the best. You should go to Kansas.” So I went to Kansas. And this is another true story … hand to God. My very first scrimmage at Kansas, I got dunked on so hard by Tarik Black that I almost quit. Tarik dunked on me so hard that I was looking at plane tickets home. This guy was a senior. He was a grown man. I didn’t know what was going on. He got his own rebound and dunked over me so hard that everything went in slow motion. He dunked the ball off my head, for real. But I didn’t even tell you the worst part. The worst part was that the entire Kansas women’s hoops team was sitting in the bleachers watching the scrimmage. The whole gym was laughing at me. It was crazy. Seriously, it was like a WORLDSTAR situation. So I went straight to Bill Self’s office afterward and I said, “I can’t do this. You have to redshirt me. I can’t play with these guys.” And Bill was like, “What? Are you serious? In two years, you’re going to be the No. 1 pick in the NBA draft.” The thing was, I had been told that all these college coaches lie. So I really thought he was trying to be slick with me. In my head, I was like, Alright, I’m just going to keep showing up and at least I’ll get a degree out of this. That will make my mom happy. The only thing that kept me going was the way that I was raised by my parents. They always told us to keep working, no matter what. I had this DVD that my coach in Cameroon had mailed to me when I first came to America. It was an hour-long tape of Hakeem Olajuwon and some other legendary big men. I probably watched that DVD every single day for three years. I would study the way Hakeem moved, and I would go out and try to imitate him. I did it in high school, and I did it at Kansas. I was basically just imagining that I was a good basketball player. The power of the mind is kind of amazing. I mean, I sucked. But somehow, I convinced myself that I was Hakeem. And I started getting better and better. And then I sort of started killing it. I pretended my way to the NBA. I seriously got to the league by watching YouTube and living in the gym. There’s no other way to explain it. Remember when KG won the title with the Celtics, and he was acting all crazy, screaming out, “ANYTHING IS POSSIBLLLLLLLLLLLLLE!!!!!!!!!!!!” That speaks to me. That’s my life. It happened so fast that it doesn’t even make sense. The most surreal moment was when Kobe was retiring, and he played his last game in Philly. After the game, they set up a little room for us to talk for a minute. He walked in, and I shook his hand and I told him, “Man, I know you probably hear this a lot, but I literally started playing basketball because of you seven years ago. Whenever I’d be shooting the ball at the park, I’d be yelling out, ‘KOBEEEEEE!’” He laughed and we talked for a minute, and then before he left he said the most Kobe thing. To most people, it wouldn’t mean anything. But to me, it was surreal. It was like I was in a video game or something. He said, in the most Kobe way, “O.K., young fella. Keep working. Keep working.” Thank you, Kobe. Thank you, Hakeem. Thank you, Mom and Dad. Thank you, Kansas. Thank you, Philly. Thank you, Lil’ Bow Wow. Thank you, Random White People. It’s a movie, I swear. I won’t try to define who I’ve become, over these last 17 years, in a single letter ... I can say this for sure: I have the Spurs and I have San Antonio to than Life is always about hard work and caring about the people close to you. Caring about your community. The real payoff isn’t money or anything material. Four years before I was on that plane with Hakeem telling me we’re going shopping for cashmere suits together, I was on the corner, selling drugs outside the Ch © 2024 Minute Media - All Rights Reserved",

                "content": "4 min read basketball-2 joel-embid sixers nba success-story Joel Embiid hit the genetic lottery. By the time he was 17 he was 6 foot 10 and was freakishly athletic. He was a candidate for the Cameroon National Volleyball team, and basketball was only an afterthought, but a man named Joe Touomou had other plans. Word had got around about the kid who was abnormally tall and agile on his feet. Joe Touomou, the first D1 basketball player out of Cameroon, saw the insane amount of potential that Embiid had. He even went down to see Embiid in person. Ex-Georgetown guard & Cameroon native Joe Touomou has accepted a job with NBA Academy Africa in Thies, Senegal as a Player Development Coach Shocked by Embid's stature, Joe invited Embiid to the Nba players, Luc Mbah a Moute's camp in Cameroon. Before the camp began, Embiid had a lot of work to do. Before this encounter, Embiid's basketball experience consisted of him going to the local park and imitating the late great Kobe Bryant's moves against the Magic in 2009. Every time he would shoot, he would yell \"KOBE.\" Due to this lack of experience, Embiid trained under Coach Moudio 3 months before camp. He had to sharpen up his skills as quickly as possible if he wanted any chance at taking this basketball pipe dream to the next level. 3 months later, it was finally time for Embiid to attend the camp he had worked so hard for. Embiid was anxious, but there was nothing he could do now. It was time for him to step up and show Luc Mbah a Moute that he deserves a shot. Unfortunately, Embiid's anxiousness got the better of him. On day 1 of the camp, Joel Embid did not show up and his coach had noticed his unusual absence. The next morning, Coach Moudio, went to Embid's house and found him playing video games with his little brother. Making sure Embid did not miss another day of the camp, Coach Moudio escorted Embid personally. Still anxious, it was time for Embid to go out and just play basketball. He had already missed a day, but it did not matter. In one play, a young Embid caught an off-target pass in the post and pulled off a Hakeem Olajuwon esque post-move. He did a quick dribble, then drop stepped past the defender, and exploded to the hoop. Luc Mbah a Moute was left in awe and even said that he knew people in the Nba that could not pull off that move. It’s National Mentoring month and @Sixers rookie stud @JoelEmbiid gets some sage advice from Hall of Famer Hakeem @DR34M Olajuwon! pic.twitter.com/1QrGYdKYQi After his performance at the camp, Embid got invited to the Basketball Without Borders Camp. He once again showed out and was sent to the US to play at the Montverde Academy in Florida, which is where Luc Mbah a Moute went just 8 years ago. When he was leaving Cameroon, Embid's little brother was devastated. He did not know when he would see his beloved older brother again, but Embid had to leave for a chance at a better life for his family. Embid's rise to NBA superstardom was just starting here. When arriving at Montverde, Embid did not know a lick of English. The only words he knew were \"Good Morning.\" He learned English by listening to comedians and rappers, but the day finally came where Embid stepped on the basketball court. At his first few practices, he made a complete fool of himself. He could not catch a ball, barely could dribble, and sometimes would miss layups. He was completely out of his element, and it would not help that his teammates would make fun of him constantly. This is where Embid's high school coach, Kevin Boyle dropped a legendary quote, \"'You laugh now, but in five years you are all going to go to Joel to borrow money because he's going to be rich.\" Fast-forwarding a year, Embid had completely rounded out his game. He was a much more polished and explosive player. He had also grown to 7 feet tall, which definitely improved his odds. Scouts were pouring in from all around the nation to watch the explosive 7-foot teenager from Cameroon. While he was doing this, he would constantly communicate with his family back home. He would always tell them he was fine, even though he was desperately missing them. Now it was finally time for Embid to pick a college that he wanted to attend. The good news, almost every school in the nation wanted Embid on their roster, but the bad news, Embid did not even know what the NCAA was. Thankfully, Embid had Luc Mbah a Moute to guide him through the whole process. In the end, he decided to go to Kansas where he would only spend one year. Once again, Embid did not believe in himself in the beginning. He finds himself full of anxiety, just like Luc Mbah a Moute's camp a few years ago. After the first practice at Kansas, he went to the coach said, \"I don't belong here.\" The coach was flabbergasted and told Embid, \" \"Are you kidding? You will be the No. 1 pick in the NBA in two years.\" Embid did not believe him at first, but after a dominant freshman collegiate season, Embid entered the draft as a one and done prospect. The coach was a little off, but Embid was picked by the Philadelphia 76ers with the third pick in the draft and the rest is history.

                "title": "Conan O'Brien - Wikipedia",
                "content": "Conan Christopher O'Brien (born April 18, 1963) is an American television host, comedian, actor, writer, and producer. He is best known for having hosted late-night talk shows, beginning with Late Night with Conan O'Brien (1993–2009) and The Tonight Show with Conan O'Brien (2009–2010) on the NBC television network, and Conan (2010–2021) on the cable channel TBS. Before his hosting career, O'Brien was a writer for the NBC sketch comedy series Saturday Night Live from 1988 to 1991, and the Fox animated sitcom The Simpsons from 1991 to 1993. He has also been host of the podcast series Conan O'Brien Needs a Friend since 2018 and starred in the 2024 travel show Conan O'Brien Must Go on Max. Born in Brookline, Massachusetts, O'Brien was raised in an Irish Catholic family. He served as president of The Harvard Lampoon while attending Harvard University, where he graduated with an AB degree in history and literature. [1] He was a writer for the sketch comedy series Not Necessarily the News. After writing for several comedy shows in Los Angeles, he joined the writing staff of Saturday Night Live. O'Brien was a writer and producer for The Simpsons for two seasons until he was selected by Lorne Michaels and NBC to take over David Letterman's position as host of Late Night in 1993. Despite unfavorable reviews and threats of cancellation in the show's first years, O'Brien and the show developed and became highly regarded, earning a Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Writing for a Variety Series. He hosted Late Night for 16 years, and as of 2023 is still the longest-serving host in the history of the franchise. In 2009, O'Brien moved from New York to Los Angeles to host his own incarnation of The Tonight Show for seven months until highly publicized network politics prompted a host change in 2010. After this departure, O'Brien hosted a 32-city live comedy tour titled The Legally Prohibited from Being Funny on Television Tour, which was the subject of the documentary Conan O'Brien Can't Stop (2011). He then hosted Conan from 2010 to 2021. Throughout his career, he has also hosted a number of awards shows and television specials, including the Emmy Awards in 2002 and 2006, the White House Correspondents' dinner in 1995 and 2013, and will host the Academy Awards in 2025.[2][3] Conan was named one of Time's 100 Most Influential People in 2010.[4] Known for his spontaneous hosting style, which has been characterized by The New York Times as \"awkward, self-deprecating humor\", O'Brien's late-night programs combine the \"lewd and wacky with more elegant, narrative-driven short films\".[5] His remotes have also become some of his best-received work, including the international travel series Conan Without Borders. With the retirement of David Letterman on May 20, 2015, O'Brien became the longest-working late-night talk show host active in the United States.[6] This active streak ended with O'Brien's retirement from late-night television in June 2021, with his entire run as a late-night host lasting nearly 30 years. Conan Christopher O'Brien was born on April 18, 1963, in Brookline, Massachusetts.[7] His father, Thomas Francis O'Brien (1929–2024), was a physician and professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School, specializing in epidemiology.[8][9] His mother, Ruth O'Brien (née Reardon; 1931–2024), was an attorney and partner at the Boston firm Ropes & Gray.[10][11] O'Brien has three brothers and two sisters.[12] O'Brien attended Brookline High School, where he served as the managing editor of the school newspaper, then called The Sagamore.[8] He was a congressional intern for Congressmen Robert Drinan and Barney Frank, and in his senior year won the National Council of Teachers of English writing contest with his short story \"To Bury the Living\".[13][14] After graduating as valedictorian in 1981, O'Brien entered Harvard University.[15] He lived in Holworthy Hall during his first year with future businessman Luis Ubiñas and two other roommates,[16] and in Mather House during his three upper-class years.[17] He majored in History & Literature, and graduated magna cum laude with a Bachelor of Arts degree in 1985.[18][19] O'Brien's senior thesis, entitled Literary Progeria in the Works of William Faulkner and Flannery O'Connor, concerned the use of children as symbols in the works of William Faulkner and Flannery O'Connor.[20][21] During college, O'Brien briefly played drums in a band called the Bad Clams and was a writer for the Harvard Lampoon humor magazine.[22] During his sophomore and junior years, he served as the Lampoon's president.[23] At this time, O'Brien's future boss at NBC, Jeff Zucker, was serving as president of the school newspaper The Harvard Crimson.[24] After graduating from Harvard, O'Brien moved to Los Angeles to join the writing staff of HBO's sketch comedy series Not Necessarily the News, where he worked for two seasons.[25] Around this time, he started taking improvisation classes with Cynthia Szigeti and The Groundlings.[26][27] His next job as a writer was on the short-lived The Wilton North Report.[28] In January 1988, Saturday Night Live (SNL) executive producer Lorne Michaels hired O'Brien as a writer.[29] During his three years on SNL, he wrote such recurring sketches as \"Mr. Short-Term memory\" and \"The Girl Watchers\"; the latter was first performed by Tom Hanks and Jon Lovitz.[30] While on a writers' strike from Saturday Night Live following the 1987–88 season, O'Brien put on an improvisational comedy revue in Chicago with fellow SNL writers Bob Odenkirk and Robert Smigel called Happy Happy Good Show.[31][32] While living in Chicago, O'Brien briefly shared an apartment with Jeff Garlin near Wrigley Field.[33] In 1989, O'Brien and his fellow SNL writers received an Emmy Award for Outstanding Writing for a Variety Series.[34] O'Brien, like many SNL writers, occasionally appeared as an extra in sketches; his most notable appearance was as a doorman in a sketch in which Tom Hanks was inducted into the SNL \"Five-Timers Club\" for hosting his fifth episode in 1990.[35] O'Brien and Robert Smigel wrote the television pilot for Lookwell starring Adam West, which aired on NBC in 1991.[36] Even with support from NBC president Brandon Tartikoff, the pilot never went to series.[37] Despite the negative reviews, it became a cult hit.[38] It was later screened at The Other Network, a festival of unaired TV pilots produced by Un-Cabaret; it featured an extended interview with O'Brien and was rerun in 2002 on the Trio network.[39] In 1991, after the failure of his sitcom, O'Brien also had an engagement to be married fall through and he quit Saturday Night Live, citing burnout.[40] \"I told Lorne Michaels I couldn't come back to work and I just needed to do something else,\" O'Brien recalled. \"I had no plan whatsoever. I was literally in this big transition phase in my life where I decided, I'll just walk around New York City, and an idea will come to me.\"[41]: 160–161 O'Brien would later return to the show as host in 2001,[42] and in a 2022 cameo appearance.[43] I was very nervous when I started. They showed me into this office and told me to start writing down some ideas. They left me alone in that office. I left after five minutes to go get a cup of coffee. I heard a crash. I walked back to the office, and there was a hole in the window and a dead bird on the floor. Literally, in my first ten minutes at The Simpsons, a bird had flown through the glass of my window, hit the far wall, broken its neck, and fallen dead on the floor. George Meyer came in and looked at it, and said, \"Man, this is some kind of weird omen.\" Mike Reiss and Al Jean, then showrunners of the animated sitcom The Simpsons, called O'Brien and offered him a job.[44] The series was prestigious in the writing community at the time; O'Brien recalls \"everyone wanted to be on that show, but they never hired.\"[41]: 160–161 O'Brien was one of the first hires after the show's original crew. With the help of an old Groundlings friend, actor Lisa Kudrow, O'Brien purchased an apartment in Beverly Hills.[40][41]: 163 He and Kudrow became romantically involved as well, and Kudrow believed he should begin performing rather than writing. O'Brien disagreed, feeling that Kudrow was flattering him, and asserting he was happy as a writer. In his speech given at Class Day at Harvard in 2000,[45] O'Brien credited The Simpsons with saving him, a reference to the career slump he was experiencing before being hired for the show.[46] From 1991 to 1993, O'Brien was a writer and producer for The Simpsons. When O'Brien first arrived at the Fox lot, they temporarily gave him writer Jeff Martin's office. O'Brien was nervous and self-conscious, feeling that he would embarrass himself in front of what he regarded as an intimidating collection of writers.[41]: 160–161 O'Brien would pitch characters in their voices, as he thought that was the norm, until Reiss informed him that no one did this.[41]: 162 [47] He fit in quickly, commanding control of the room frequently; writer Josh Weinstein called it a \"ten-hour Conan show, nonstop\".[41]: 160–161 According to John Ortved, one of his fellow writers said that Conan had been a shoo-in to take over as showrunner.[41]: 160–161 O'Brien wrote some of the series' most acclaimed episodes: \"Marge vs. the Monorail\" and \"Homer Goes to College\".[41]: 160–161 [48] The show was initially a highly realistic family sitcom; after O'Brien's debut, the show took a rapid shift in the direction of the surreal.[41]: 164 O'Brien also has sole writing credits on \"New Kid on the Block\" and \"Treehouse of Horror IV\", on which he wrote the episode wraparounds. Wallace Wolodarsky described a \"room character\" Conan put on for the writers: \"Conan used to do this thing called the Nervous Writer that involved him opening a can of Diet Coke and then nervously pitching a joke. He would spray Diet Coke all over himself, and that was always a source of endless amusement among us.\"[41]: 162 During his time at The Simpsons, O'Brien also had a side project working with Smigel on the script for a musical film based on the \"Hans and Franz\" sketch from Saturday Night Live, but the film was never produced.[49][50] Meanwhile, David Letterman was preparing to leave the talk show Late Night, prompting executive producer Lorne Michaels to search for a new host. Michaels approached O'Brien to produce; then-agent Gavin Polone stressed that O'Brien wanted to perform, rather than produce.[41]: 164 He arranged with Michaels that O'Brien would do a test audition on the stage of The Tonight Show. Jason Alexander and Mimi Rogers were the guests, and the audience was composed of Simpsons writers.[41]: 165 Wolodarksky recalled the experience: \"Seeing this friend of yours, this guy that you worked with, walk out from behind that curtain and deliver a monologue was like something you could only dream up that you couldn't ever imagine actually happening.\"[41]: 165 The performance was beamed by satellite to New York, where Lorne Michaels and NBC executives watched.[5] The audition was not well received by media commentators, citing his \"awkward\" humor.[51][52] O'Brien was picked as the new host of Late Night on April 26, 1993.[5] As the writers headed to the voice record for \"Homer Goes to College\", O'Brien received a phone call from Polone informing him of the decision.[53] \"He was passed out facedown into this horrible shag carpet. He was just quiet and comatose down there on that carpet,\" recalled postproduction supervisor Michael Mendel. \"I remember looking at him and saying, 'Wow. Your life is about to change, in a really dramatic way.'\"[41]: 166–167 Fox, however, would not let O'Brien out of his contract. Eventually, NBC and O'Brien split the cost to get him out of the contract.[41]: 166–167 [54][55] During pre-production, writer Robert Smigel suggested fellow writer Andy Richter to sit beside O'Brien and act as a sidekick.[56] After O'Brien's departure, the writers at The Simpsons would watch videotaped episodes of Late Night at lunch the day following their midnight broadcast and analyze them.[41]: 166–167 Late Night with Conan O'Brien, originating from Studio 6A at 30 Rockefeller Plaza in New York City, premiered on September 13, 1993, to unfavorable reviews from contemporary critics.[57] This reception was not completely unsurprising: there was significant public apprehension due to O'Brien being virtually unknown to the public,[58][59][60] and O'Brien himself wrote a self-deprecating The New York Times piece titled \"O'Brien Flops!\" on the day of the show's premiere.[61] Critics attacked O'Brien: Tom Shales of The Washington Post suggested that \"the host resume his previous identity, Conan O'Blivion.\"[5][62] Generally, critics viewed O'Brien as nervous and fidgety on-camera, and that he was \"too smart, too East Coast, too sophisticated, too young and even too tall to be successful.\"[5] The show was constantly at risk for cancellation; at one low point in 1994, NBC threatened to put him on a week-to-week contract. Executives were anxious to replace him with Greg Kinnear, who followed O'Brien with Later at 1:30 am.[5] Interns filled empty seats in the audience while affiliates began to inquire about replacement hosts.[63][64] In one installment after a short stretch of reruns, sidekick Andy Richter described his vacation activities as follows: \"I sat back and reminded myself what it's like to be unemployed.\" The in-joke alluded to the rumors floating in the trades that NBC was near canceling the program.[65] Late Night under O'Brien slowly but steadily acquired commercial and critical success. Sketches grew in popularity (\"If They Mated\", \"Desk Drive\", \"In the Year 2000\").[64] A reliable staple involved a TV screen, lowered behind O'Brien's desk and displaying a still photo of a news figure. The lips and voice of these characters (Clutch Cargo) – frequently a party-crazed \"hillbilly\" interpretation of Bill Clinton – were supplied by writing partner Robert Smigel.[64] A turning point was David Letterman's February 1994 appearance. \"It was a morale boost,\" said O'Brien. \"I'm thinking, If the guy who created the 12:30 thing comes on and says we're smart and funny, let's go.\"[66] The show went through a wobble in January 1995 when Robert Smigel, feeling burned out, quit as head writer.[40] An increase in quality over time, perceived by some observers, was sometimes credited to a growth in O'Brien's comedic performance.[67] Within a year, a comedic formula began to arise: the show would combine the lewd and wacky with more elegant, narrative-driven remotes.[5][68] One famous remote was when Conan visited a historic, Civil War-era baseball league.[5] That piece was one of O'Brien's personal favorites, later remarking, \"When I leave this earth, at the funeral, just show this, because this pretty much says who I'm all about.\"[69] O'Brien's audience, largely young and male (a coveted demographic), grew steadily and the show began to best competitors in the ratings, and continued to do so for 15 seasons.[5] In the early days of the Internet, fans launched unofficial websites, compiling precise summaries of each episode.[70] Even Tom Shales was a convert: he called the show \"one of the most amazing transformations in television history.\"[64] Beginning in 1996, O'Brien and the Late Night writing team were nominated annually for the Emmy Award for Best Writing in a Comedy or Variety Series, winning the award for the first and only time in 2007. In 1997, 2000, 2002, 2003, and 2004, he and the Late Night writing staff won the Writers Guild Award for Best Writing in a Comedy/Variety Series. In 2001, he formed his own television production company, Conaco, which subsequently shared in the production credits for Late Night.[8] That same year, he returned to Saturday Night Live, hosting the show during its 26th season.[42] As of October 2005[update], Late Night with Conan O'Brien had for eleven years consistently attracted an audience averaging about 2.5 million viewers.[63] In 2006, O'Brien exploited his perceived resemblance to Tarja Halonen, entering her second term as president of Finland. Capitalizing on the resemblance and on the 2006 Finnish presidential election, O'Brien and Late Night aired mock political ads both in support of Halonen and against her main opponent Sauli Niinistö, which influenced popular perception of the race, which Halonen eventually won.[71] O'Brien traveled to Finland shortly after the election.[72] \"We took the show to Helsinki for five days,\" O'Brien recalled, \"where we were embraced like a national treasure.\"[5][73] As part of the five-day trip, which was released as a one-hour special episode of Late Night, O'Brien met with Halonen at the Finnish Presidential Palace.[74] During the writers' strike in 2008, O'Brien staged a mock feud with Comedy Central's Jon Stewart (of The Daily Show) and Stephen Colbert (of The Colbert Report) over a dispute about which of the three were responsible for giving a \"bump\" to Mike Huckabee's campaign to become the Republican presidential nominee.[75] This feud crossed over all three shows during the 2007–08 Writers Guild of America strike.[76] On February 20, 2009, NBC aired the last episode of Late Night with Conan O'Brien.[77] The show consisted of a compilation of previous Late Night clips and included a surprise appearance by former sidekick Andy Richter. Will Ferrell, John Mayer, and the White Stripes also appeared. O'Brien ended the episode by destroying the set with an axe, handing out the pieces of the set to the audience,[78] and thanking a list of people who helped him. Among those thanked were Lorne Michaels, David Letterman, Jay Leno, and O'Brien's wife and children.[79] In 2019, clips from O'Brien's time on Late Night began to be posted on his TBS website and on the Team Coco YouTube channel.[80] As part of a new contract negotiated with NBC in 2004, the network decided that O'Brien would take over The Tonight Show from Jay Leno in 2009.[82] Leno then moved to a prime time slot, named The Jay Leno Show.[83] Hosting The Tonight Show was a lifelong dream of O'Brien's, and the promise of succeeding Leno kept him in NBC's employ despite the fact that he likely could have secured a more lucrative deal at another network.[84] O'Brien was a guest on Jay Leno's final episode of The Tonight Show.[85] On June 1, 2009, Will Ferrell became Conan's first Tonight Show guest on the couch and Pearl Jam appeared as his first musical guest.[86] Conan acquired the nickname \"Coco\" after its use in the first \"Twitter Tracker\" sketch during the second episode of his Tonight Show run.[87] Guest Tom Hanks used the nickname during his subsequent interview, even getting the audience to chant it. In reaction to the moniker, Conan remarked to Hanks in jest, \"If that catches on, I'll sue you.\"[88] During the taping of the Friday, September 25, 2009, episode of The Tonight Show, O'Brien suffered a mild concussion after he slipped and hit his head while running a race as part of a comedy sketch with guest Teri Hatcher. He was examined at a hospital and released the same day. A rerun was aired that night, but O'Brien returned to work the following Monday and poked fun at the incident.[89][90] By November 2009, ratings for O'Brien's The Tonight Show declined by around 2 million viewers since the previous year when Leno was host.[91] On January 7, 2010, NBC executive Jeff Zucker met with Jay Leno and Conan O'Brien to discuss how to move Leno out of prime time, where his ratings were lackluster, and back into late night.[92] It was proposed that O'Brien would remain as host of The Tonight Show, which would run at 12:05 am with Leno hosting a 30-minute show at 11:35 pm.[93] Three days later, NBC Universal Television Entertainment chairman Jeff Gaspin confirmed that The Jay Leno Show would be moved to 11:35 pm following NBC's coverage of the 2010 Winter Olympics.[94] Every comedian, every comedian dreams of hosting The Tonight Show and—for seven months—I got to do it. I did it my way, with people I love, and I do not regret a second [of it].... All I ask is one thing, and I'm asking this particularly of young people that watch: Please do not be cynical. I hate cynicism; for the record it's my least favorite quality. It doesn't lead anywhere. Nobody in life gets exactly what they thought they were going to get. But if you work really hard and you're kind, amazing things will happen. Sources familiar with the situation stated that O'Brien was unhappy and disappointed with NBC's plan.[96] On January 12, O'Brien released this statement: \"I sincerely believe that delaying The Tonight Show into the next day to accommodate another comedy program will seriously damage what I consider to be the greatest franchise in the history of broadcasting. The Tonight Show at 12:05 simply isn't The Tonight Show.\"[97] On January 21, 2010, it was announced that Conan had reached a deal with NBC that would see him exit The Tonight Show the next day. The deal also granted him $45 million, of which $12 million was designated for distribution to his staff, who had moved with Conan to Los Angeles from New York when he left Late Night.[98] The final Tonight Show with Conan aired January 22, 2010, and featured guests Tom Hanks, Steve Carell (who did an exit interview and shredded Conan's ID badge), Neil Young (singing \"Long May You Run\"), and Will Ferrell. For Ferrell's appearance, Conan played guitar with the band and Ferrell sang \"Free Bird\" while reprising his SNL cowbell. Ferrell's wife, Viveca Paulin, together with Ben Harper, Beck, and ZZ Top guitarist Billy Gibbons, also joined the band for this final performance.[99][100] Jay Leno returned to The Tonight Show following NBC's coverage of the 2010 Winter Olympic Games. Under the $45 million deal with NBC, Conan was allowed to start working for another network as soon as September 2010.[101][102] Conan's rumored next networks ranged from Fox to Comedy Central.[103] Other networks reportedly interested in O'Brien included TNT, HBO, FX, Showtime, Revision3,[104] and even the NBC Universal–owned USA Network.[105] On February 8, 2010, it was reported that O'Brien was attempting to sell his Central Park West penthouse in New York with an asking price of $35 million.[106] He had purchased the apartment in 2007 for $10 million.[107] Two years earlier, O'Brien had purchased a home in the Brentwood section of Los Angeles for over $10.5 million.[108] Some industry insiders have speculated that O'Brien had chosen to stay on the west coast in order to facilitate a return to late night television and because he did not want to put his children through another move.[109] O'Brien was included in the 2010 Time 100, a list compiled by Time of the 100 most influential people in the world as voted on by readers.[110] After being prohibited from making television appearances of any kind until May, O'Brien spoke about the Tonight Show conflict on the CBS newsmagazine 60 Minutes on May 2, 2010.[111] During the interview with Steve Kroft, O'Brien said the situation felt \"like a marriage breaking up suddenly, violently, quickly. And I was just trying to figure out what happened.\" He also said he \"absolutely\" expected NBC to give him more of a chance and that, if in Jay Leno's position, he would not have come back to The Tonight Show. However, Conan said he did not feel unfortunate. \"It's crucial to me that anyone seeing this, if they take anything away from this, it's I'm fine. I'm doing great,\" said O'Brien. \"I hope people still find me comedically absurd and ridiculous. And I don't regret anything.\"[112] On March 11, 2010, O'Brien announced via his Twitter account that he would embark on a 30-city live tour beginning April 12, 2010, entitled, \"The Legally Prohibited from Being Funny on Television Tour\".[113] Co-host Andy Richter, along with members of the former Tonight Show Band, joined O'Brien on the tour.[114] Max Weinberg, however, was not able to join,[115] except for a guest appearance at one of Conan's New York City shows.[116] On April 12, 2010, O'Brien opened his two-month comedy tour in Eugene, Oregon, with a crowd of 2,500 and no TV cameras.[117] The tour traveled through America's Northwest and Canada before moving on to larger cities, including Los Angeles and New York City, where he performed at Radio City Music Hall, next to his former Late Night studios.[118][119] The tour ended in Atlanta on June 14.[120] In 2011, the documentary film titled Conan O'Brien Can't Stop was released which followed O'Brien throughout his comedy tour.[121] The film premiered March 2011 at the South by Southwest media festival to positive reviews.[122][123] It was directed by Rodman Flender who is O'Brien's personal friend and classmate at Harvard University.[124] The day his live tour began, O'Brien announced that he would host a new show on cable station TBS.[2] The show, Conan, debuted on November 8, 2010, and aired Monday through Thursday at 11:00 pm ET/10:00 pm CT.[125][126] O'Brien's addition moved Lopez Tonight with George Lopez back one hour.[3] Refusing at first to do to Lopez what had happened to him at NBC, O'Brien agreed to join the network after Lopez called to persuade him to come to TBS.[127] In February 2015, following the onset of the Cuban thaw, O'Brien became the first American television personality to film in Cuba for more than half a century.[128] O'Brien then visited Armenia for his next show abroad, during which he featured his assistant Sona Movsesian, who is Armenian American.[129] While visiting, Conan guest-starred as a gangster on an Armenian soap opera.[130] In April 2016, O'Brien visited South Korea in response to a fan letter urging him to visit, as well as a growing fan base online. His visit included a trip to the Korean Demilitarized Zone, which resulted in O'Brien and Steven Yeun also visiting North Korea on a technicality by stepping across the border line at the DMZ. Conan commented on the significance during the sketch, claiming, \"The idea that you and I could be in North Korea, talking and communicating freely, seems like kind of a cool message.\"[131][132] These remotes were later branded Conan Without Borders and became part of their own series, with O'Brien eventually traveling to thirteen countries in total.[133][134] The series became some of his most popular work, winning an Emmy in 2018.[135][133] The international shows became available on Netflix before moving to HBO Max.[136][137] TBS extended the show through 2018 in 2014[138] and through 2022 in 2017.[139] In late 2018, Conan took a three-month hiatus while O'Brien launched another national comedy tour. The show returned January 22, 2019, in a new half-hour format without the live band.[140] In response to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, the program switched to a remotely-produced format from O'Brien's home beginning March 30, 2020.[141][142] In July 2020, it was announced that Conan would continue with this format, but would be filmed with limited on-site staff from the Largo at the Coronet in Los Angeles and no studio audience — making it the first American late-night talk show to return to filming outside of the host's residence (albeit still not from its main studio).[143] In November 2020, TBS announced that Conan would end in June 2021.[144] The final show aired on June 24, 2021, featuring a live audience and marking the end of O'Brien's twenty-eight year run as a late-night host.[145] It was announced that O'Brien would move to a weekly untitled variety show on fellow WarnerMedia property HBO Max, where he was expected to focus more on his podcast and travel shows with a relaxed production schedule.[146][147] On his final show, O'Brien featured fictional character Homer Simpson, marking also the three episodes that O'Brien wrote for the series.[148] Comedians Will Ferrell and Jack Black also paid their farewell to the show in the series finale.[149] In 2018, O'Brien's production company, Team Coco, partnered with Earwolf to launch his own weekly podcast, Conan O'Brien Needs a Friend.[150] The podcast debuted November 18, 2018, with Will Ferrell as the first guest.[140] O'Brien stated the title is tongue-in-cheek, saying he would like to see if celebrity guests would actually be his friends.[151] In each episode, Conan is joined by his guest, as well as his assistant Sona Movsesian and the show's producer Matt Gourley.[152] Guests on the podcast have included Barack and Michelle Obama, Stephen Colbert, and Bob Newhart among others.[153] The podcast has received strong reviews and became the top podcast on iTunes. The podcast has also won numerous awards throughout its run.[154][155] Deadline Hollywood reported that, as of August 2021, the podcast had been downloaded over 250 million times and was averaging more than 9 million downloads per month.[152] O'Brien made a cameo appearance as himself on the February 26, 2022 episode of Saturday Night Live, as a guest inducting John Mulaney into the Five-Timers Club with Tina Fey, Steve Martin, Paul Rudd, Candice Bergen and Elliott Gould.[43] In May 2022, O'Brien's podcast, as well as the entire Team Coco digital media business, was sold to SiriusXM for $150 million.[a] This sale included all other Team Coco podcasts including Inside Conan and Parks and Recollection, as well as the development of a comedy channel for SiriusXM radio service.[158][159] On April 18, 2024, HBO released a four-episode international travel series titled Conan O'Brien Must Go on Max to widespread critical acclaim.[160] The series featured O'Brien traveling to Norway, Argentina, Thailand, and Ireland to meet fans whom he had previously featured via video calls in his podcast series Conan O'Brien Needs a Fan.[161][162][163][164] The show was renewed for a second season of six episodes in May 2024.[160] To promote the first season's release, O'Brien appeared on the interview show Hot Ones, where guests eat increasingly spicy chicken wings. The intensity and humor of his episode received significant media attention, resulting in widespread praise of his performance and more generally as a comedic performer.[165][166][167] In 2024, He teamed up with Norwegian rap duo E.D.A. to release the song \"Velkommen til Klubben\".[168] O'Brien was executive producer and co-wrote the pilot of the 2007 NBC adventure/comedy series Andy Barker, P.I., starring O'Brien's sidekick Andy Richter.[169] After six episodes and low ratings, the show was canceled despite being named one of the Top Ten Shows of 2007 by Entertainment Weekly.[170][171] Later, USA Network ordered a pilot episode of the medical-themed Operating Instructions, which was produced by O'Brien's production company Conaco.[172] In January 2010, NBC ordered two pilots from Conaco, the one-hour courtroom drama Outlaw and a half-hour comedy.[173] Outlaw was produced in eight episodes and premiered on September 15, 2010.[174] O'Brien's first guest appearance after beginning his late-night career was playing himself in the season five Simpsons episode \"Bart Gets Famous\", interviewing Bart Simpson during his rise to fame as a catchphrase comedian.[44] In 1999, O'Brien made an appearance on Futurama in the second-season episode \"Xmas Story\". O'Brien played himself as a head in a jar and still alive in the year 3000.[175] O'Brien has made multiple voice appearances on the Adult Swim series Robot Chicken, including the specials Robot Chicken: Star Wars and Robot Chicken: Star Wars Episode II.[176] Other voice work performed by O'Brien includes the voice of Robert Todd Lincoln in the audiobook version of Assassination Vacation by Sarah Vowell,[177] the voice of talk show host Dave Endochrine in the 2013 DC Universe Animated Original Movie Batman: The Dark Knight Returns (Part 2),[178] the voice of the character Kuchikukan in the \"Operation: Lunacorn Apocalypse\" episode of Nickelodeon's The Penguins of Madagascar,[179] and the voice of Santa Claus in The Backyardigans episode \"The Action Elves Save Christmas Eve\".[180] On the TV show 30 Rock, O'Brien is depicted as an ex-boyfriend of lead character Liz Lemon, who works in the same building.[181] In the episode \"Tracy Does Conan\", Conan appears as himself, awkwardly reunited with Lemon and coerced by network executive Jack Donaghy into having the character Tracy Jordan on Late Night, despite having been assaulted in Jordan's previous appearance.[182] O'Brien also made a cameo appearance on the U.S. version of The Office. In the episode \"Valentine's Day\", Michael believes that he spots former SNL cast member, Tina Fey, but has actually mistaken another woman for her. In the meantime, Conan has a quick walk-on, and the camera crew informs Michael when he returns from talking to the Tina Fey lookalike.[183] In 2011, he starred as himself in the web series Web Therapy (opposite Lisa Kudrow) for three episodes.[184] O'Brien also made a guest appearance as the \"Wandering MC\" in the 2019 video game Death Stranding,[185][186] where he communicates with the player using voice lines and facial expressions recorded during his visit to Kojima Productions' headquarters.[187] O'Brien has hosted several awards shows and television specials. He hosted the 54th Primetime Emmy Awards in 2002 and the 58th Primetime Emmy Awards in 2006, to critical acclaim.[188] He also hosted the 2014 MTV Movie Awards.[189] In 2011 and 2012, O'Brien hosted the Christmas in Washington special for TBS' sister network, TNT, featuring celebrity performances and a special appearance by the Obama family both years.[190][191] Conan has served as the master of ceremonies for the White House Correspondents' Association dinner in Washington, D.C. twice, in 1995 and 2013.[192] In 2016, O'Brien hosted the 5th Annual NFL Honors in San Francisco, California.[193] He also hosted a reunion special in Northern Ireland for Game of Thrones in 2018 for the final season of the series.[194] The special was released on HBO Max in 2021.[195] On March 2, 2025, O'Brien will host the 97th Academy Awards.[196] O'Brien lists among his comedic influences Carol Burnett, Bob Newhart,[197] David Letterman,[198] Peter Sellers,[199] Sid Caesar,[200] Warner Bros. Cartoons,[44] Johnny Carson,[201] Ernie Kovacs,[202] Bob Hope,[203] and Woody Allen;[204] and upon his retirement from Conan, he described his style as the pursuit of a \"strange, phantom intersection between smart and stupid.\"[205] In turn, actors and comedians who claim O'Brien as an influence include Mindy Kaling,[206] Pete Holmes,[207] Seth Meyers,[208] Nikki Glaser,[209] John Krasinski,[210] Moses Storm,[211] Sam Richardson,[212] Colin Jost,[213] Kumail Nanjiani,[214] Ron Funches,[215] John Mulaney,[216] Eric André,[217] and Taylor Tomlinson.[218] The military working dog Conan is reportedly named after O'Brien according to Newsweek.[219] On Late Night, O'Brien became known for his active and spontaneous hosting style,[8] which has been characterized as \"self-deprecating\" by both media outlets and O'Brien himself.[220][221] This spontaneity is also apparent in remotes in which he is put in novel and open-ended environments. Some of these, such as a \"Civil War-era baseball\" remote during Late Night and his international Conan Without Borders shows, are among his best-received work.[69][222] O'Brien met Elizabeth Ann \"Liza\" Powel in 2000, when, as a senior copywriter for the advertising agency Foote, Cone & Belding, she appeared in a skit on Late Night with Conan O'Brien in which O'Brien sought to craft a more effective TV commercial for Hilton Furniture, a store in Houston, where O'Brien's show was only broadcast at 2:40am.[223][224] The couple dated for nearly 18 months before their 2002 marriage in Powel's hometown of Seattle.[225] O'Brien and Powel have a daughter, Neve (born 2003)[226] and a son, Beckett (born 2005).[227] O'Brien often speaks about his Irish Catholic heritage.[228][229] On a 2009 episode of Inside the Actors Studio, he stated that ancestors from both sides of his family moved to America from Ireland starting in the 1850s, subsequently marrying only other Irish Catholics, and that his lineage is thus 100% Irish Catholic.[8] His entirely homogenous ancestry was confirmed via DNA test a decade later, which he shared on The Late Show with Stephen Colbert. O'Brien noted that being entirely descended from just one ethnic group is extremely rare for an American, and that his being so \"shocked\" his doctor.[230] He has been a registered Democrat since casting his first vote for president in 1984 for Walter Mondale. He considers himself a moderate on the political spectrum.[8][231] O'Brien founded the anti-hunger organization Labels Are For Jars with his friend and former Harvard dormmate Father Paul B. O'Brien.[232] He also helped open the Cor Unum meal center in Lawrence, Massachusetts in 2006.[233][234] Starting in September 2006, O'Brien was stalked by Father David Ajemian of the Archdiocese of Boston, who, despite multiple warnings to stop, sent O'Brien letters signed as \"your priest stalker\".[235] Ajemian later sent O'Brien death threats and tried to forcefully enter a taping of Late Night before being arrested.[236] On April 8, 2008, Ajemian pleaded guilty to stalking, and was later laicized.[237][238] In January 2008, after his show was put on hold for two months owing to the strike by the Writers Guild of America, he reemerged on late-night TV sporting a beard, which guest Tom Brokaw described as making him look like \"a draft dodger from the Civil War.\"[239] After leaving The Tonight Show with Conan O'Brien in 2010, O'Brien again grew a beard, which he kept until May 2011, when it was partially shaved on the set of Conan by Will Ferrell (and completely shaved off-screen by a professional barber).[240] O'Brien purchased a $10.5-million mansion in Brentwood, Los Angeles, California, to prepare for his move there in 2009 from New York City to host The Tonight Show at Universal Studios Hollywood.[241] As part of a long-running gag, he brought his 1992 Ford Taurus SHO with him to California, showcasing it on both the inaugural episodes of The Tonight Show and Conan.[242] O'Brien purchased an ocean-front house in Carpinteria, California in 2016.[243] He listed the house for sale for $16.5 million in July 2022.[244] On June 12, 2011, O'Brien was awarded an honorary Doctor of Arts degree from Dartmouth College.[245] In addition to the honorary degree, he delivered the commencement speech.[246][247] On October 21, 2011, O'Brien was ordained as a minister by the Universal Life Church Monastery,[248] allowing him to perform a same-sex marriage in New York, then one of the few states in the US where gay marriage was legal, to tape a week's worth of shows.[249] The wedding, between a member of O'Brien's staff and his partner, was held on the stage of the Beacon Theatre on November 3, 2011, and broadcast on Conan.[250] The same-sex marriage ceremony was the first to be broadcast on American late night television.[251]",

The bid-ask spread can indicate a stock’s liquidity, which is how easy it is to buy and sell in the marketplace. Often, a smaller spread suggests higher liquidity, meaning more buyers and sellers in the market are willing to negotiate. In contrast, a larger spread suggests lower liquidity, as there are fewer investors willing to negotiate.

                "content": "Archibald Charles Manning[2] (born April 27, 2005) is an American football quarterback for the Texas Longhorns. He is a member of the Manning family. Manning played high school football at Isidore Newman School in New Orleans. In his freshman year, Manning was the varsity starter at quarterback, the first freshman quarterback to start Newman's season opener in at least 40 years.[3] He shined in his debut, leading Newman to a 26-point victory.[4] In the final game of the season against Dunham, Manning threw for only 71 yards on 20 attempts and 10 completions. They would lose, 22–20.[5] Manning completed his freshman season with 2,509 yards and 34 touchdowns, earning MaxPreps National Freshman of the Year honors.[6] Manning opened his sophomore season by having six touchdowns against East Jefferson.[7] On October 15, 2020, he made his national television debut in a game against Booker T. Washington, throwing for two touchdowns and rushing for two more.[8] In a game where Newman beat Cohen, 76–0, Manning passed for 169 yards and five touchdowns in the first quarter of action before being pulled from the game.[9] In the first round of the Division III playoffs, Newman received a bye and played Catholic - N.I. in the second round. Manning would throw for 127 yards and a touchdown in the 14–7 win.[10] In the final game of the season in the semifinals, Manning completed less than 50 percent of his passes and threw an interception to lose to Lafayette Christian Academy, 21–7.[11] Manning was again named the starting quarterback for Newman for his junior season in 2021. In Newman's first game against Vandebilt Catholic, Manning passed for 258 yards and accounted for all four touchdowns in the 28-point shutout victory.[12] Weeks later, Manning went a perfect 11-of-11 for 179 yards and five total touchdowns in the first half of their 70–0 win over Fisher.[13] Manning had another perfect night against Cohen, going 9-of-9 for 153 yards and five passing touchdowns in the 34-point shutout win.[14] In the second round of the playoffs, Manning played Episcopal and threw for 164 yards and accounted for three touchdowns in the 37–6 win.[15] The following week, Lafayette Christian would blow out Newman, 49–7. In 2021, Manning threw for 1,841 yards, 26 touchdowns, and four interceptions while having six rushing touchdowns. Manning was the captain of the Newman football team for his senior season in 2022. In their matchup against Pearl River, Manning threw for 356 yards and seven touchdowns in a 59–7 victory, breaking Eli's record of 7,268 career passing yards and Peyton's record of 93 career touchdowns.[16] To avoid a media frenzy, Manning's family withheld him from media interviews and also declined premature college scholarship offers. He ran a private account on Instagram, allowing only friends and coaches to follow him, including Ole Miss head coach Lane Kiffin. \"They've shut down everything,\" said one member of the local media, \"but the attention is going to come.\"[2] In his college search he visited SMU, Clemson, LSU,[17] Alabama, Texas,[18] Georgia,[19] and Virginia,[20] as well as Ole Miss, his grandfather's, father's, and uncle's former team.[21][22] On December 21, 2022, Manning signed a letter of intent to play for the University of Texas and committed on June 23, 2022; only then did he make his account public.[23][24] After playing in the spring game for Team Orange, Manning was named the team's third-string quarterback behind Quinn Ewers and Maalik Murphy.[25] Manning made his collegiate debut on November 24, during the third quarter of a blowout win against Texas Tech, completing 2-of-5 passing attempts for 30 yards.[26] After the season, Manning was redshirted.[27] Manning made his 2024 season debut against Colorado State when he entered the game in relief of Ewers during the third quarter while the Longhorns had a 38–0 lead. Manning finished with five completions for 95 yards and a touchdown. He also added a rushing touchdown.[28] Against UTSA, Ewers left with an abdominal injury in the second quarter forcing Manning to come into the game with a 14–0 lead. On his first play of the game, Manning threw a 19-yard touchdown to DeAndre Moore. Two plays later, he rushed for a 67-yard touchdown to put the Longhorns ahead 28–7. After Manning threw a 75-yard strike to freshman wide receiver Ryan Wingo to go up 42–7, he added another passing touchdown in the fourth quarter to go up 49–7 before being relieved by freshman Trey Owens. Manning finished the game with 223 passing yards, 53 rushing yards, and five total touchdowns (four passing, one rushing) as Texas blew out UTSA, 56–7.[29][30] On September 19, head coach Steve Sarkisian announced that Manning would be the starting quarterback the following week against Louisiana–Monroe.[31] This announcement came after Manning shared the title of SEC Freshman of the Week with Texas A&M quarterback Marcel Reed for Week 3.[32] He was also named Earl Campbell Tyler Rose Award National Player of the Week and was tabbed to the Davey O'Brien Award Great 8 list.[33][34] A member of the Manning family, he is the oldest son of Cooper Manning, who is the oldest son of Archie Manning, and nephew to Cooper's NFL quarterback brothers, Peyton and Eli.[35] His younger brother, Heid, was the center for the football team and played lacrosse at Isidore Newman School.[36]",

                "content": "Editions: En/ncaa Manning opened up about serving behind Quinn Ewers The college football world buzzed with curiosity as Arch Manning's first year with the Texas Longhorns unfolded in unexpected ways. After joining a program steeped in high expectations and legacy, the quarterback found himself navigating a new reality when Quinn Ewers, the established starter, reclaimed his spot after recovering from an early-season injury. Manning's name became synonymous with anticipation, as fans and analysts debated whether his time on the sidelines would prompt a quick exit from Texas. Speculation ran rampant when Ewers announced he would be returning for another year instead of heading to the NFL Draft. Yet, the younger Manning chose patience over impulsiveness, a move that revealed much about his approach to the game and his commitment to the program. The journey was new territory for Manning. Speaking during a candid January 2024 interview, he shared his reflections on the challenges of adjusting to a backup role for the first time. \"High school was different-I was always the starter,\" Manning admitted. He described the unexpected lessons he absorbed from his teammates and coaching staff, noting, \"I've learned a lot from Quinn, Maalik, and our coaches. Staying patient isn't easy, but it's essential.\" These insights came after Manning's brief stint under the spotlight, filling in for Ewers during a stretch when Texas needed him most. He compiled respectable stats with over 900 passing yards, nine touchdowns, and only two interceptions. Still, the return of a healthy Ewers nudged him back to the bench, sparking questions about his next move. When asked why he resisted the growing trend of entering the transfer portal, Manning's response was rooted in loyalty and long-held dreams. \"There's nowhere else I want to be,\" he told The Athletic. \"Playing for Texas was always the goal, and I'm not ready to give up on that.\" The young quarterback's decision also drew praise from his famous uncle, Peyton Manning, who voiced his approval during an appearance on The Pat McAfee Show. \"Arch staying at Texas says a lot about him,\" Peyton remarked. \"Most kids in that situation would have moved on, but he's committed for all the right reasons.\" Head coach Steve Sarkisian has been transparent about the current pecking order: when healthy, Ewers is QB1. However, Manning's dedication hints that his time will come. For now, he continues to sharpen his skills and await his chance, knowing that patience could be the key to future success at Texas. © Unidad Editorial Información Deportiva, S.L.U.

                "content": "By Ariadna Pinheiro November 08, 2024 11:55AM EDT November 08, 2024 11:55AM EDT By Ariadna Pinheiro Arch Manning is much more than a football prospect; he is the heir to a dynasty that breathes the sport in every play. In his veins runs the weight of a name that has defined eras—a family legend woven into the yards. With a focused gaze and determination in his stance, he is not just the future, but an echo of the past and a promise for the generations to come. Even amidst the pressure and greatness, he is committed to writing his own career. He has followed in his family’s footsteps by joining the University of Texas team, turning down offers from other elite programs like Alabama and Georgia, ensuring that the Manning legacy remains strong and present. Arch Manning is a 19-year-old American football player who has gained notoriety as one of the sport’s most promising talents in the United States. He belongs to the iconic Manning family, famous in the NFL.

(Source: Tim Warner/Getty Images) He stood out as the star quarterback at Isidore Newman High School in New Orleans, setting records and showcasing remarkable skills on the field. His talent earned him recognition as one of the top recruits in the 2023 class. After much anticipation, he decided to join the Texas Longhorns, despite the competition he would face on the team and the high expectations placed on him. The combination of his talent and his family name has led many experts to closely follow his career. With Texas, he has demonstrated strong performance, standing out in several games during the 2024 season, clearly showing he has the potential to carry on the family legacy in American football. Arch Manning is closely related to quaterbacks Peyton and Eli Manning, as the two NFL stars are his uncles. Without a doubt, the young player has received significant support from his family, particularly from these two members.

(Source: IMAGO / Newscom World — Jeff Bottari/Getty Images) Since he began standing out in football at a very young age, his family has been by his side, providing both guidance and the benefit of their experience in the sport. It seems that the family legacy will continue without strain… Though they have made sure not to pressure him, both Peyton and Eli have been available to offer technical advice and leadership tips that they learned throughout their successful careers, which have established them among the best. Arch is the son of Cooper Manning, Peyton and Eli’s older brother, who also had aspirations in American football but was forced to retire prematurely due to an injury. His father’s career was affected by a condition in the spine called spinal stenosis, which cut short his career in the sport and in the NFL. However, he has always been present in the sports futures of his family. Arch Manning 16 of the Texas Longhorns as he walks in before the game vs the UL Monroe Warhawks — Cooper Manning in 2016. (Source: IMAGO / Newscom World — Mike Coppola/Getty Images for Bleacher Ball) Cooper has emphasized that Arch has grown up in a supportive and motivating environment, where he has been able to develop his talent without the pressure of being compared to his famous uncles. He has focused on his own growth. Throughout his life, he has stayed away from the playing field but has been involved in other aspects of the sports world, such as analysis and media. So he has never been too far removed from this world. He was a commentator on sports programs and has been part of the coverage of NFL-related events. Additionally, he has worked in real estate. He is also known for his charisma in sports entertainment. The family’s influence began with Archie Manning, who was a star quarterback at the University of Mississippi in the 1960s before playing 13 seasons in the NFL, primarily with the New Orleans Saints. He was a symbol of leadership. Peyton Manning, Archie Manning and Eli Manning attends the NERF Father’s Day Football Throwdown on June 14, 2008. (Source: Astrid Stawiarz/Getty Images) Though his career may not be marked by championships, Archie’s legacy as a skilled and determined player earned him respect and admiration. His role as a mentor planted the seeds for a dynasty that would redefine excellence. Peyton Manning and Eli, Archie’s sons, elevated the family name to new heights. Peyton, one of the greatest quarterbacks in NFL history, revolutionized the game with his unmatched preparation, precision and intelligence. Eli forged his own path, excelling in high-pressure moments and leading the New York Giants to two legendary Super Bowl victories. Together, the brothers proved that success requires not just talent but also resilience, preparation and humility. The next chapter in the Manning legacy is already being written with Arch Manning. As the highly-touted prospect of the third generation, he is ready to continue the family tradition, starting on the same team.

Cox/Getty Images) Looking ahead, his future in football appears promising. His decision to stay with the University of Texas team, even with the possibility of limited playing time, reflects a long-term vision for his career. By continuing to develop under the guidance of Texas’s coaching staff, he is positioning himself as a potential starting quarterback in the coming seasons. His performances have already sparked discussions about his readiness to lead the team. The Manning name is more than a family legacy—it is a cornerstone of football history. For decades, they have shaped this sport not only through their achievements on the field but also by embodying the values that define American football. Their influence is not confined to wins and championships; it extends to the culture, education and future of the game. Archie laid the foundation for the family’s enduring impact. What truly sets the family apart is their lasting influence off the field. Their commitment to mentoring young athletes, organizing football camps and supporting charitable causes reflects their dedication to the sport’s growth at every level. The Manning Passing Academy, for instance, has become a premier event for young quarterbacks, giving these players the opportunity to learn from one of the most iconic families in sports.
