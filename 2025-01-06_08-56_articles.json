                "content": "If not listed, please contact your TV provider. GREEN BAY, Wis. (AP) Caleb Williams gained a shot of confidence and Cairo Santos earned a measure of redemption. The Chicago Bears finished a disappointing season on a high note, while the Green Bay Packers limped into the playoffs with plenty of questions. Williams drove Chicago to Santos' 51-yard field goal as time expired in a 24-22 victory over the Packers, who lost quarterback Jordan Love and wide receiver Christian Watson to injuries on Sunday. The Bears (5-12) beat the Packers for the first time since 2018 and ended an 11-game losing streak in this rivalry. They had dropped 10 straight overall - a slump that included the firing of coach Matt Eberflus the day after Thanksgiving - to match a franchise record for consecutive losses within a single season. “To be able to have that moment was great,” said Williams, the No. 1 overall pick in the 2024 draft. “Being able to have the first win of 2025, being able to have the first win since 2015 in Lambeau, to be able to have the first win against Green Bay in (12) games. It’s the first of a lot, and really excited about this offseason.” Santos bounced back after he had a 46-yard field goal blocked by Karl Brooks on the final play of a 20-19 loss to the Packers on Nov. 17. “I don’t think I could have (written) a cooler script for myself,” Santos said. Green Bay (11-6) is the No. 7 seed in the NFC playoffs and will play at Philadelphia in the wild-card round. Now the Packers wait on the status of Watson and Love. Watson was carted off the field with a knee injury in the second quarter and Love departed later in that same series. Love said he lost feeling in his throwing hand but expects to be fine for the playoffs. Coach Matt LaFleur said Love could have returned to the game if necessary. “It’s obviously not the note we wanted to end on with a loss to the Vikings and then turn around and (have) a loss here,” Love said. “It’s the reality of our situation. We’ve got to find a way to improve this week, get better and look forward to seeing Philly.” LaFleur wasn’t as optimistic about Watson, who had his left hand on his head in apparent frustration as he was carted to the locker room. Love’s injury came early in the second quarter when he landed after flipping a pass to Josh Jacobs while facing heavy pressure. Earlier in the same series, Watson fell to the ground and clutched his right knee while running a pattern. Malik Willis took over for Love and went 10 of 13 for 136 yards with a fumble while helping Green Bay rally from an early 14-3 deficit. Brandon McManus put Green Bay ahead 22-21 by making a 55-yard field goal with 54 seconds left. Williams got the Bears into field-goal range by throwing an 18-yard completion to DJ Moore, whose fumble had set up the McManus kick. LaFleur blamed himself for calling a timeout to debate whether to go for the first down or attempt a field goal with the Packers facing fourth-and-4 from the 37. That gave Williams enough time to drive the Bears into field-goal range on their next series, though a horse-collar tackle penalty on Kingsley Enagbare also had an impact. “I’m disappointed that I put our team in that situation at the end of the game because (I was) just being indecisive, and you can’t do that in those critical moments because it came back and burned us,” LaFleur said. Williams was 21 of 29 for 148 yards. He threw a touchdown pass to Moore, who had nine catches for 86 yards. The Bears took their first lead since the opening quarter of a 30-27 overtime loss to Minnesota on Nov. 24 by utilizing some trickery on a punt return. As Moore acted as though he was preparing to catch a punt near Green Bay’s sideline, Josh Blackwell actually got the ball while his back was toward the line of scrimmage way over near Chicago’s sideline. Most of the Packers in coverage converged on Moore and other Bears, creating a clear lane for Blackwell on a 94-yard touchdown. That play enabled Chicago to end the first quarter ahead 7-3 despite getting outgained 87-(minus-4). It was the first time since Sept. 4, 1994, that a team led a game after the first quarter despite having less than zero total yards. Chicago interim coach Thomas Brown said the Bears’ belief never wavered even after they fell behind and seemed destined for one more close loss in a season full of them. “You think about the first game, how the first game ended at our place against Green Bay,” Brown said. “No better feeling than Cairo having a chance to come on the field, great job on our field-goal team to protect. It was perfect execution, drilled it. Game over.” Along with the injuries to Watson and Love, Bears S Jaylon Johnson hurt his quadriceps. Packers WR Romeo Doubs missed the game due to an illness.

                "title": "Bears vs. Packers: Game updates, live score from Week 18",
                "content": "The Chicago Bears (4-12) will battle the Green Bay Packers (11-5) in Week 18, where the Bears are looking to snap a 10-game losing streak as the regular season comes to a close. The Bears are coming off an ugly 6-3 loss to the Seattle Seahawks on Thursday Night Football. While the defense had a respectable performance -- holding the Seahawks to six points -- the offense was atrocious. They managed just a field goal 11 first downs, seven punts and 179 total yards. While Caleb Williams continued to make incredible plays, he was sacked seven times, which now totals 67 on the season, the most ever in franchise history. Stay tuned for updates. The Bears offense extended their lead to eight points after an eight-play, 61-yard scoring drive that culminated in a 32-yard touchdown catch by receiver DJ Moore. That marked the 20th touchdown pass for Caleb Williams this season, which is just the 13th time a Bears quarterback has thrown for 20 or more touchdowns in a season. After initially failing on a two-point attempt, a penalty gave them another chance. But Thomas Brown opted to settle for the field goal to keep it a one-score game. Bears 21, Packers 13 The Bears defense has brought the heat against the Packers offense, and they got another turnover on the afternoon thanks to a beautiful hit on a blitz by safety Kevin Byard, who sacked Packers backup quarterback Malik Willis and stripped him of the football. It was recovered by linebacker T.J. Edwards, setting the Chicago offense up near midfield. Bears 14, Packers 13 Yep, you read that correctly. Facing first-and-10 at Green Bay's 40-yard line, Thomas Brown called a trick play where Keenan Allen was going to attempt a pass to Rome Odunze. But Allen pulled the pass down, when Odunze wasn't open, and instead forced it into triple coverage, where it was picked by Xavier McKinney. Bear 14, Packers 13 The Bears held the Packers out of the end zone for the first quarter-plus. But, even after losing receiver Christian Watson and quarterback Jordan Love to injuries, Chicago's defense couldn't defend tight end Tucker Kraft or running back Josh Jacobs, and the latter found the end zone for a 9-yard rushing score. Bears 14, Packers 10 Chicago's offense, which had -4 yards heading into the second quarter, finally was able to move the ball (if only 21 yards) and find the end zone to extend their lead. After receiver DJ Moore took a screen pass 15 yards, running back D'Andre Swift finished the drive with a 4-yard touchdown run. Bears 14, Packers 3 Cornerback Jaylon Johnson had a textbook Peanut Punch to force a Jayden Reed fumble, which was recovered by safety Jonathan Owens and returned to the Green Bay 21-yard line. It set up the Bears offense in prime scoring position. Bears 7, Packers 3 Chicago actually scored in the first quarter -- thanks to their special teams and some trickery from Richard Hightower. After forcing the Packers to punt, DJ Moore faked like he was receiving the punt, which drew Green Bay defenders his way. But they didn't see Josh Blackwell fielding the ball on the other side of the field, and he easily ran it back 94 yards for the touchdown. Bears 7, Packers 0 Bears vs. Packers will broadcast on FOX in Week 18 of the 2024 NFL season. Kevin Kugler and Daryl Johnston will call the game from the booth at Lambeau Field, with Laura Okmin reporting from the sidelines. Streaming options for the game include FUBO, which offers a free trial to new subscribers. It feels like a lifetime ago since the Bears last won a football game, but it's been even longer since Chicago last defeated the Packers -- 11 games. Even if Green Bay were to rest starters with the playoffs locked up -- although the No. 6 seed is up for grabs -- it's hard to imagine the Bears snapping that losing skid against their arch rivals. Sure, Chicago should've won the last meeting, but that was a different team just seven weeks ago. This game could get ugly, and it would be a fitting end to what's been the franchise's worst season in recent history. While 10 points seems significant, it's worth noting that both the Lions and Vikings blew out the Bears by 17-plus points in recent weeks after narrow victories against Chicago earlier in the year.

Cairo Santos converted the extra point. The Packers responded with a 37-yard field goal made by Brandon McManus. Chicago led 7-3 after the first quarter. Chicago's lead grew when D'Andre Swift rushed for a 4-yard touchdown. Santos converted the extra point. To make matters worse for Green Bay, Love exited the game due to an elbow injury and was replaced by Malik Willis. However, the hosts fired back with a 9-yard touchdown run from Josh Jacobs and McManus converted the extra point. Green Bay then lessened the deficit further when McManus made a 30-yard field goal. At halftime, the Bears had a narrow 14-13 lead over the Packers. Both teams failed to create big chances in the third quarter, which ended scoreless. The Bears eventually resumed the scoring in the fourth quarter when Williams connected with DJ Moore for a 32-yard touchdown. Santos converted the extra point. The Packers then fought hard to get back into the game and were rewarded when Emanuel Wilson rushed for a 21-yard touchdown. They went for a successful 2-point conversion via Jayden Reed. The Packers thought completed the comeback when McManus made a 55-yard field goal. However, in the final play of the game, Santos made a 51-yard field goal to give the Bears a narrow 24-22 win.

                "content": "More on the Meaning of Patriot The word patriot signifies a person who loves their country and is ready to boldly support and defend it. That meaning has endured since the word's arrival in English in the 16th century, but it has not marched through the years unchallenged. Ultimately derived from Greek patrios, meaning \"of one’s father,\" patriot entered English via French patriote—meaning \"fellow countryman\" or \"compatriot\"—during a time of political unrest in western Europe that was characterized by infighting among fellow countrymen—especially among those of the Protestant and Catholic faiths. For much of the 17th century, words like good were attached to patriot to distinguish patriots who shared both a love of country and a common allegiance from those having opposing beliefs and loyalties: to be deemed a \"good patriot\" was to be a lover of country who agreed on political and/or religious matters with whoever was doing the deeming. The Catholiques were knowne good Patriots under our former Kings. — Henry Hammond, A view of some exceptions which have been made by a Romanist to the Lord Viscount Falkland's discourse…, 1646 Patriot was used to mean \"good patriot\" without modification more frequently by the end of the 17th century, but it tended to apply to a supporter of the ruling monarchy. A Patriot, both the King and Country serves; Prerogative, and Privilege preserves. — John Dryden, Fables, Ancient and Modern, 1700 Another effect of the tumultuous times was the development of a derogatory use of patriot to refer to hypocritical patriots: people who claimed devotion to one's country and government but whose actions or beliefs belied such devotion. This ultimately led to the discrediting of the loyalty and steadfastness associated with the word patriot. The years leading up to the American Revolutionary War further propagated the notion of patriot as a name for a seditious rebel against the monarchy. American writers of the 18th century, however, heartily embraced the word to define the colonists who took action against British control. As tensions continued to escalate, a new meaning of patriot came to the forefront, referring to a person who advocates or promotes the independence of their land or people from the country of which they are a colony. Benjamin Franklin provides an early record of this use. It should be no Wonder … if among so many Thousand true Patriots as New England contains there should be found even Twelve Judases. — Benjamin Franklin, letter, 7 July 1773 In the end, the patriots won the war and, centuries after America’s Declaration of Independence, patriot has held its place of honor in the English language as the meritorious name for the brave men and women of the armed forces who defend the rights and freedoms of their country. Stripped of all past disparagement, the word has returned to its original meaning: \"one who loves his or her country.\" Today, active fighting or resistance is not a requirement to being a patriot: a person only needs a strong sense of love for one’s country.

Gomez is also nominated for her role as Jessi Del Monte in “Emilia Pérez” — her first Spanish-speaking role. \"How about this gal?\" Martin said on the carpet, gushing about her performance. Outside of her many professional successes, Gomez also recently announced her engagement to music producer Benny Blanco.

She is basking in worthiness. And she feels deeply, deeply SEEN.” Davis, one of a handful artists who’ve achieved the coveted “EGOT” status (by winning an Emmy, a Grammy, an Oscar and a Tony), won a Golden Globe in 2017 and has been nominated for the award seven times throughout her career. “Being an actor has always been the cosmic carrot to a much higher, deeper journey. I’ve ALWAYS been in search of connection to people but also to.....myself. I found it through artistry,” she wrote in the post. “It’s a sacred, magical tool that has elevated my life in every way.

News on the red carpet that she feels so comfortable with the act now that she \"can't wait to tell this to a room full of people.\" Because of that, she is preparing to even go off book if the moment calls for it. She added that she's feeling \"so ready\" and that \"the nerves aren't there yet.\" Her confidence is warranted, but she also said \"it's blowing my mind that Angelina Jolie has to listen to me talk for nine minutes.\" As for Glen Powell, Glaser needs him sitting in the back row with sunglasses on \"so he can't throw me. ... I need to stay dry.\" Alicia Victoria Lozano Saba Hamedy Twenty-eight years after Lyle and Erik Menendez were sentenced to life in prison for killing their parents, the brothers may be getting a second chance at freedom. On Friday, the family-led Justice for Erik and Lyle Coalition said over 20 relatives of the Menendez brothers are expected to sit down with Los Angeles County District Attorney Nathan Hochman in a continued push for a reduced sentence for the siblings. Some legal experts say the Hollywood projects, as well as a public shift in attitude toward victims of sexual abuse, helped bring renewed attention to the Menendez brothers, paving the way for their potential release from prison. Among the buzzy Hollywood titles? “Monsters: The Lyle and Erik Menendez Story,” a Ryan Murphy-led true crime series on Netflix that’s nominated for three Globes. Read the full story here. Ronda Racha Penrice “Nickel Boys,” director RaMell Ross’ first narrative feature, is set at the fictional Nickel Academy, based on the notoriously cruel Arthur G. Dozier School for Boys near Tallahassee, Florida, which operated for 111 years before the Justice Department shut it down in 2011. Ross and producer Joslyn Barnes adapted the film from Colson Whitehead’s Pulitzer Prize-winning 2019 novel, “The Nickel Boys.” The film is nominated in the drama category. Read the full story here. Rebecca Cohen One thing was obvious the minute “Nobody Wants This” dropped on Netflix: Adam Brody’s rizz — while playing a rabbi, no less — is off the charts. But for loyal millennial TV stans, that’s been obvious since at least 2003, when Brody first graced our screens (and our hearts) as teen heartthrob Seth Cohen — a nerd by all means whose biting sarcasm and frizzy hair somehow helps him score the hottest girl in his Southern California high school. For all of us who have been pining for Seth Cohen for, yes, decades, Brody’s Noah in “Nobody Wants This” was a welcome character in our streaming rotations, allowing us to revel in the memories of Chrismukkah (which conveniently made a resurgence in 2024) and all of the other glory brought by “The OC.” Clearly, those nominating for the Golden Globes agreed, offering Brody his first nomination at the coveted show. A long time coming for us longtime Brody stans. Rabbi Noah is reminiscent of the beloved Seth Cohen: charming, bright, quick and, of course, Jewish. This time, he plays opposite Kristen Bell, a non-Jew who stumbles into a situationship with her friend’s friend — a rabbi. The 10-episode miniseries catalogues Noah and Joanne’s attempt at love and how they make it work when everything seems to be stacked against them. In an appearance on the E! red carpet, Brody was asked how it feels to, again, be everyone's favorite internet boyfriend, 20 years after his stint on \"The OC.\" He joked that he hopes to be back again in 20 more years — as everyone's favorite \"grandpa boyfriend.\" Angela Yang Seating arrangements are ready for the year’s first star-studded party. The Golden Globes hinted at tonight’s seating charts in a video revealing “Wicked” stars Ariana Grande, Cynthia Erivo and Michelle Yeoh at one table and the likes of Kate Winslet, Angelina Jolie and Denzel Washington at another. Celebrity couples to be seated together include nominee Selena Gomez and her fiancé, Benny Blanco, as well as nominee Timothée Chalamet with Kylie Jenner. Rebecca Cohen Richard Gadd, who wrote and starred in the viral miniseries \"Baby Reindeer,\" said he can't believe he's at the Golden Globes. The nine months since the show came out, he added, have been crazy. Gadd said he's already working on his next project, a new BBC/HBO show. He revealed only scant details: It's about \"dysfunctional men and how they move through life.\" When asked who he would love to work with, Gadd shocked listeners with his answer: Dwayne \"The Rock\" Johnson. He said he has been a wrestling fan his whole life. One day, he added, he'd also love to write and direct a film. \"But I'm happy where I am at the moment this evening,\" Gadd said. Sophia PargasSophia Pargas is a news associate for NBC News. Broadway lovers are represented in a big way at this year’s Globes, with four nominations for the immensely “Popular” adaptation of “Wicked” — including best motion picture and the cinematic and box office achievement award. Starring duo Cynthia Erivo and Ariana Grande are also nominated for best lead and supporting actress, respectively. Though the movie adaptation faced much pressure to live up to the original 2003 Broadway musical, it has been met with praise from both loyal theater fans and “Wicked” newbies. The movie is credited with bringing film, music and theater fanatics together at the box office and beyond. “Wicked” has now surpassed “Mamma Mia” as the highest-grossing Broadway musical adaptation, with over $634 million in ticket sales. Fans continue to attend showings clad in their best pink and green, sing along at special showings and anticipate the release of “Wicked: For Good” in November. The musical would be the 11th Broadway-to-film adaptation to take home a Golden Globe — joining most recently a best motion picture win for “Les Misérables” in 2013. Angela Yang The winners of the Glen Powell and Timothée Chalamet lookalike contests, two events that drew attention last year amid a craze over competitions to honor various celebrities' doppelgängers, are on the red carpet together. A video posted by The Hollywood Reporter shows both attendees holding a sign that reads: “I won a lookalike contest and now I’m at the Golden Globes.” Saba Hamedy After three years, actress and activist Laverne Cox announced on Friday that she’s leaving her red carpet hosting gig with E! “With an incredible amount of gratitude I’ve decided not to return as host of #LiveFromE’s red carpet coverage,” Cox wrote in an Instagram post before the Golden Globes. The “Orange Is the New Black” alum became a red carpet favorite in 2022, when she took over E!’s red carpet coverage after longtime host Giuliana Rancic left. (NBCUniversal is the parent company of E! News and NBC News.) “These moments are a reminder to me of what an incredible privilege it has been to talk to some of the world’s greatest artists about their work, navigating the pressures of success, etc.,” Cox wrote in her social media post. “I’m so excited to keep growing, evolving and exploring great opportunities as an actress, artist, host and speaker. I hope you’ll all continue to go with me on my evolving journey.” Pilar Melendez Netflix’s “Nobody Wants This,” nominated in several TV categories, got mixed responses from viewers. The show stars Adam Brody as Noah, aka “hot rabbi,” who falls hard for Joanna, a “shiksa” podcaster played by Kristen Bell. Some have praised it for its positive portrayal of Judaism; others have criticized how it depicts Jewish women. NBC News spoke with four rabbis about the buzzy series to get their thoughts on the discourse. Read the full story here. Daniel Arkin “The Apprentice” charts Donald Trump’s rise to the top of Manhattan real estate under the tutelage of notorious fixer Roy Cohn. Trump’s campaign says the film is “garbage.” Both Jeremy Strong, who plays Cohn, and Sebastian Stan, who plays Trump, are nominated tonight. NBC News spoke with director Ali Abbasi when the film was released in October. Read the full story here. Kimmy Yam Lee Jung-jae, who reprised his role as game winner Seong Gi-hun in season two of “Squid Game,” said that this time around, his character is darker and more serious after a traumatic first season. The show, which debuted its second season on Dec. 26, is nominated in the TV category. Read the full story here. Sophia PargasSophia Pargas is a news associate for NBC News. Get ready for some nostalgia at tonight's Golden Globes. Zendaya, Ariana Grande, Selena Gomez and Miley Cyrus — all known for their beginnings as Disney and Nickelodeon child stars — snagged nominations in various categories tonight. The four former child actors will likely have a mini reunion at the event, which has prompted many social media users to express their excitement about seeing the faces they grew up watching on TV now thriving in Hollywood alongside one another. Through pop stardom, fashion exploration and various acting roles, the four nominees have expressed continued support for one another and gratitude for their unique shared experience growing up in the spotlight. “It’s incredibly special,” Grande told Entertainment Tonight when she was asked about being nominated alongside Cyrus and Gomez. “I love those girls and to grow up with the world watching, really, and then to have your work recognized in this way, it makes me so happy.” Angela Yang People at tonight’s show can buy champagne from a vending machine. The Golden Globes teased on social media this weekend that the venue is equipped with Moët & Chandon vending machines. Daniel Arkin Iranian director Mohammad Rasoulof learned he had been sentenced to eight years in prison while he was completing his latest film, the tense political thriller “The Seed of the Sacred Fig.” NBC News recently spoke with Rasoulof, a fierce critic of Iran’s theocratic regime who escaped the country on foot after he made the Golden Globe-nominated film. Read the full story here. Saba Hamedy Ready to critique red carpet looks from the comfort of your couch? Us too. Most red carpet coverage will kick off about two hours before the show, though many stars usually don’t trickle in that early. We’ll have our eyes on “Entertainment Tonight” and Variety’s digital red carpet preshow, which will air live on Variety.com, CBS and Paramount+ beginning at 6:30 p.m. ET/3:30 p.m. PT. We’ll also be watching E!’s coverage, which will be hosted by “Access Hollywood’s” Zuri Hall and comedian Heather McMahan. “Live From E!: Golden Globes” starts at 6 p.m. ET/3 p.m. PT. Daniel Arkin The group behind the Globes introduced a new category last year: cinematic and box office achievement. It’s a field that allows voters to recognize movies that have “garnered extensive global audience support” (read: ticket sales); last year, the prize went to “Barbie.” Eight hit movies are in the running this year: “Alien: Romulus,” “Beetlejuice Beetlejuice,” “Deadpool & Wolverine,” “Gladiator II,” “Inside Out 2,” “Twisters,” “Wicked” and “The Wild Robot.” “Inside Out 2” and “Deadpool & Wolverine” were the two highest-grossing titles of 2024, each raking in more than $600 million at the domestic box office. But don’t be surprised if the award goes to the third-highest-grossing release: “Wicked.” Saba Hamedy Zendaya served themed red carpet looks while promoting her tennis-centric film “Challengers” last spring. Her style inspired many fans to hop on the \"tenniscore\" trend, giving rise to attire inspired by the sport. (Read more in our full story here.) She is nominated for her role as Tashi Duncan, a tennis player-turned-coach, in the Luca Guadagnino-directed film, which also stars Mike Faist and Josh O’Connor. Will she bring back that “tenniscore” — a tennis-inspired aesthetic — tonight? We’ll see. Angela Yang After it swept the 2024 Emmy Awards with six wins out of 11 nominations, Netflix’s hit series “Baby Reindeer” is entering 2025 with three Golden Globe nominations, including best performance nods for Richard Gadd and Jessica Gunning. Despite its overwhelming popularity among audiences, the show was embroiled in legal controversy after Fiona Harvey — the women who claimed to be the real-life inspiration behind its stalker character, Martha (played by Gunning) — sued Netflix, claiming defamation and intentional infliction of emotional distress. Gadd, the show’s creator, has maintained that its characters were not representations of real people. Ronda Racha Penrice Denzel Washington is nominated for his role in “Gladiator II” as Macrinus, a saboteur and opportunist in the Roman Empire epic. “His grand purpose,” Washington said in a recent interview, “is to take over the world.” Read the full story here. Daniel Arkin The Globes, unlike the Academy Awards, split the best film prize into two categories: drama and musical/comedy. It’s a model that allows voters to recognize a wider array of film projects, with six entrants in each race. The editors of Gold Derby, an awards prediction website, say the drama movies with the best odds are “The Brutalist,” an epic saga of the postwar immigrant experience, and “Conclave,” a thriller about the top-secret battle for the papacy. The other drama nominees are “A Complete Unknown,” “Dune: Part Two,” “Nickel Boys” and “September 5.” In the musical/comedy category, Gold Derby editors say the odds favor “Anora,” a madcap portrait of a Brooklyn sex worker, and “Wicked,” an adaptation of the popular Broadway musical. The other contenders are “Challengers,” “Emilia Pérez,” “A Real Pain” and “The Substance.” “Conclave” and “Wicked” were released by units of NBCUniversal, the parent company of NBC News. Rebecca Cohen Bob Dylan has nothing but praise for Timothée Chalamet, who is nominated for his portrayal of the famed singer-songwriter in the upcoming film “A Complete Unknown” about Dylan’s life. Dylan took to X to share his excitement for the biopic and his faith in Chalamet’s taking on the role. Read the full story here. Daniel Arkin Globes voters also recognize achievement in TV. In the drama series race, Gold Derby gives the best odds to “Shōgun,” a saga set in feudal Japan. (The acclaimed series won the equivalent prize at the most recent Emmys.) The other nominees in the drama series category are “The Day of the Jackal,” “The Diplomat,” “Mr. and Mrs. Smith,” “Slow Horses” and “Squid Game.” In the comedy series field, “Hacks” appears to have momentum after claiming the equivalent trophy at the most recent Emmys. The other contenders in the category are “Abbott Elementary,” “The Bear,” “The Gentlemen,” “Nobody Wants This” and “Only Murders in the Building.” Mike Calia It isn’t so rare for an actor to end up with multiple nominations at the Golden Globes in a single year. After all, the ceremony has 14 acting categories across TV and film. No surprise, either, that the list of past double nominees is an illustrious group. It includes: Meryl Streep, Jamie Foxx and Audrey Hepburn, among many others. This year, there are three double nominees: Selena Gomez (best actress in a TV comedy for “Only Murders in the Building” and supporting actress in a film for “Emilia Perez”), Sebastian Stan (best actor in a film drama for “The Apprentice” and film comedy for “A Different Man”) and Globes stalwart Kate Winslet (best actress in a film drama for “Lee” and best actress in a limited series, anthology series or TV movie for “The Regime.”) This is the third time Winslet has been up for multiple Globes in one year, and it could bode well for her chances to take home another statuette. The last time she was a double nominee, in 2012, she won for her title role in the HBO limited series “Mildred Pierce” but lost in the best actress, comedy/musical film, category. In 2009, she won both categories in which she was nominated: best actress in a drama film for “Revolutionary Road” and best supporting actress in a film for “The Reader.” Angela Yang Demi Moore received her first Golden Globes nod since 1997. This time, she is nominated for best performance by a female actor in a musical or comedy film for the body-horror satire “The Substance.” She posted her reaction to hearing the news of the nomination, throwing her fists up with an ecstatic cheer as she watched “The Substance,” and later her own name, appear on a TV screen as 2025 nominees. She described it as the “best news to wake up to” in her Instagram post, adding that she’s “Truly honored to be nominated and so proud of this film.” Rebecca Cohen It’s a year of many firsts: Twenty-six of tonight’s nominees are on the ballot for the first time. Some of those joining the nominations list for the first time might surprise you, like mega pop star Ariana Grande, who was nominated for her role as Glinda in “Wicked.” Joining Grande with inaugural Globes nominations are Adam Brody, Pamela Anderson, Zoe Saldaña, Mikey Madison, Glen Powell and Jesse Plemons, among others. Host Nikki Glaser also received her first nomination for her comedy special, “Nikki Glaser: Someday You’ll Die.” Angela Yang Hugh Grant got a nod this year for his role as a sadistic kidnapper who terrorizes two young Mormon missionaries in the horror-thriller film “Heretic.” He took to X in December to express his surprise at being nominated for best performance by a male actor in a musical or comedy. “Massive thanks to the Golden Globes for so warmly welcoming a blatant gate crasher,” Grant wrote. “Also to Scott Beck and Bryan Woods for spotting my need to kill, and to A24 for sponsoring it.” This is the seventh nomination for Grant, who won his first and only Golden Globe Award for “Four Weddings and a Funeral” in 1995. Saba Hamedy In a post to her Instagram story, nominee Ariana Grande shared her gratitude for her time working on \"Wicked.\" The singer has gained praise for her role as Galinda/Glinda, who is later known as “Glinda the Good.\" \"all i can think about this afternoon and all morning is how deeply grateful i am to have been able to do this work and to have spent these years with Galinda ...\" she wrote in the post, which she shared with a photo of what appears to be a copy of her \"Wicked\" script.\" She said she's excited to celebrate \"all of the beautiful art that was made this year\" with the rest of the cast, who she called her \"Ozian family,\" and \"our new friends,\" likely referring to the slew of other A-listers who will be there tonight. \"happy Golden Globes day\" she added. TODAY Watch \"The TODAY Show\" break down everything to know ahead of tonight's show. Mike Calia The Globes will carve out time to honor two longtime stars with awards outside the main slate. Viola Davis will receive the Cecil B. DeMille Award, which the Globes have given out since 1952, when the honor’s namesake was the first recipient. Davis, a Globe winner herself for “Fences” in 2017, is also one of a handful of EGOT winners — meaning she’s taken home what are traditionally known as the big four awards: Emmy, Grammy, Oscar and Tony. Past DeMille Award honorees include Walt Disney, Sophia Loren and Davis’ “Fences” co-star and director, Denzel Washington. Ted Danson, meanwhile, will receive the comparatively new Carol Burnett Award, which the Globes started in 2019 to single out greats in television. Danson, a prominent presence on TV comedies and dramas across six decades, is a three-time Globe winner — including twice for his signature role as pitcher-turned-barkeep Sam Malone on long-running 1980s sitcom “Cheers.” Beyond Burnett herself, past winners include Ryan Murphy, Norman Lear and Ellen DeGeneres. The awards were given out Friday, two days before the full Globes ceremony, but Davis and Danson will also be honored during the main broadcast. Austin Mullen Per usual, the Globes has a long list of A-list stars set to present. On that list: Elton John, Viola Davis, Jeff Goldblum, Anya Taylor-Joy, Gal Gadot, Dwayne Johnson, Melissa McCarthy, Nicolas Cage, Salma Hayek Pinault, Colman Domingo, Sharon Stone, Kerry Washington, Colin Farrell, Michael Keaton, Mindy Kaling, Seth Rogen, Kate Hudson, Nate Bargatze, Sarah Paulson and Vin Diesel. Ariana DeBose, Anthony Mackie, Glenn Close, Rob McElhenney, Anthony Ramos, Kaley Cuoco, Awkwafina, Kathy Bates, Miles Teller, Rachel Brosnahan, Auliʻi Cravalho, Morris Chestnut, Zoë Kravitz, Édgar Ramírez, Catherine O’Hara and Brandi Carlile are also all slated to present awards. Daniel Arkin Emmy- and Grammy-nominated stand-up comedian Nikki Glaser will make her debut as Globes emcee. She is the first woman to host the ceremony solo. In recent years, Tina Fey and Amy Poehler hosted together four times, while Sandra Oh split hosting duties with Andy Samberg in 2019. In an interview with the Globes’ official website, Glaser said headlining the show was “scary,” but she was excited about the challenge. Glaser is coming off a high-profile year. “Nikki Glaser: Someday You’ll Die,” her second HBO stand-up special, debuted on the network in May. She also appeared in Netflix’s “The Roast of Tom Brady.” NBC News TV series (drama) TV series (comedy or musical) TV series (limited or TV movie) TV actor (drama) TV actor (comedy) TV actor (limited series or TV movie) TV actress (drama) TV actress (comedy) TV actress (limited series or TV movie) Supporting actor Supporting actress Stand-up comedy performance NBC News Motion picture (drama) Motion picture (comedy or musical) Actor (drama) Actress (drama) Actor (comedy or musical) Actress (comedy or musical) Supporting actor Supporting actress Director Screenplay Score Song Animated feature Non-English language film Cinematic box office achievement Daniel Arkin The Globes will take place at the Beverly Hilton Hotel on Sunday and air live on CBS starting at 8 p.m. ET.

The Brutalist, starring Adrien Brody, and Conclave, starring Ralph Fiennes, also landed a sizable haul of nominations with seven and six nods, respectively.

When the news broke in 2024, Glaser paid tribute to past hosts who inspired her. \"Some of my favorite jokes of all time have come from past Golden Globes opening monologues when Tina [Fey], Amy [Poehler], or Ricky [Gervais] have said exactly what we all didn't know we desperately needed to hear,\" Glaser said. \"I just hope to continue in that time-honored tradition (that might also get me canceled).\" Born in Cincinnati and raised in St. Louis, Glaser discovered her passion for comedy while studying at the University of Colorado Boulder, where she wrote her first jokes at 18. She later graduated from the University of Kansas with a degree in English. Her comedy career skyrocketed with TV appearances and her stand-up specials, Perfect (2016), Bangin' (2019), and Someday You'll Die (2024). In addition to her stand-up success, Glaser is known for hosting shows like Blind Date and FBoy Island and starring in her E! reality series, Welcome Home Nikki Glaser. If streaming is your go-to option, viewers can catch the ceremony on the CBS app (with cable credentials) or Paramount+. The show will stream live and on-demand for Paramount+ with Showtime subscribers, while Paramount+ Essential subscribers can access it on-demand starting the day after it airs. Additionally, platforms like Hulu + Live TV, YouTube TV, and FuboTV will offer live streaming of the event, ensuring fans don't miss a moment of the star-studded night. For the first time since the early 1980s, the Golden Globe Awards will air on CBS, marking a significant shift after its long run on NBC. Fans can tune in to catch the star-studded event starting at 8 p.m. ET/PT on Sunday, January 5. Known for its glamorous red carpet moments and memorable speeches, the ceremony typically runs around three hours, so grab your popcorn and settle in for a dazzling night celebrating the best in film and television. The 82nd Golden Globe Awards will bring Hollywood's brightest stars together under one roof at the Beverly Hilton in Los Angeles on Sunday, January 5. Celebrating the best in television and film from 2024, the ceremony promises a night of unforgettable moments, stunning fashion, and recognition of standout performances. Among this year's highlights, Wicked co-stars Cynthia Erivo and Ariana Grande both earned nominations, with the film also up for Best Motion Picture—Musical or Comedy. Selena Gomez is a double nominee, competing for supporting actress in Emilia Pérez (which leads with 10 nominations) and lead actress for her work in Only Murders in the Building. Top contenders in film include A Complete Unknown (the Bob Dylan biopic starring Timothée Chalamet), The Substance (with Demi Moore), Conclave (featuring Ralph Fiennes), and The Brutalist (starring Adrien Brody), each earning multiple nominations across acting and best movie categories. Though the Golden Globes often hint at trends for the Oscars, experts caution that they aren't always a reliable predictor for the Academy Awards, which follow eight weeks later. Fans can tune in at 8 p.m. ET/PT on CBS and Paramount+ to catch all the action. To read how Newsweek uses AI as a newsroom tool, Click here. Amanda M.

                "title": "Falcon - Wikipedia",
                "content": "38; see text. Falcons (/ˈfɒlkən, ˈfɔːl-, ˈfæl-/) are birds of prey in the genus Falco, which includes about 40 species. Some small species of falcons with long, narrow wings are called hobbies,[7] and some that hover while hunting are called kestrels.[7][8] Falcons are widely distributed on all continents of the world except Antarctica, though closely related raptors did occur there in the Eocene.[9] Adult falcons have thin, tapered wings, which enable them to fly at high speed and change direction rapidly. Fledgling falcons, in their first year of flying, have longer flight feathers, which make their configuration more like that of a general-purpose bird such as a broadwing. This makes flying easier while still learning the aerial skills required to be effective hunters like the adults. The falcons are the largest genus in the Falconinae subfamily of Falconidae, which also includes two other subfamilies comprising caracaras and a few other species of \"falcons\". All these birds kill prey with their beaks, using a tomial \"tooth\" on the side of their beaks — unlike the hawks, eagles and other larger birds of prey from the unrelated family Accipitridae, who use talons on their feet. The largest falcon is the gyrfalcon at up to 65 cm (26 in) in length. The smallest falcon species is the pygmy falcon, which measures just 20 cm (7.9 in). As with hawks and owls, falcons exhibit sexual dimorphism, with the females typically larger than the males, thus allowing a wider range of prey species.[10] As is the case with many birds of prey, falcons have exceptional powers of vision; the visual acuity of one species has been measured at 2.6 times that of human eyes.[11] They are incredibly fast fliers, with the Peregrine falcons having been recorded diving at speeds of 320 km/h (200 mph), making them the fastest-moving creatures on Earth; the fastest recorded dive attained a vertical speed of 390 km/h (240 mph).[12] The genus Falco was introduced in 1758 by the Swedish naturalist Carl Linnaeus in the tenth edition of his Systema Naturae.[13] The type species is the merlin (Falco columbarius).[14] The genus name Falco is Late Latin meaning a \"falcon\" from falx, falcis, meaning \"a sickle\", referring to the claws of the bird.[15][16] In Middle English and Old French, the title faucon refers generically to several captive raptor species.[17] The traditional term for a male falcon is tercel (British spelling) or tiercel (American spelling), from the Latin tertius (third) because of the belief that only one in three eggs hatched a male bird. Some sources give the etymology as deriving from the fact that a male falcon is about one-third smaller than a female[18][19][20] (Old French: tiercelet). A falcon chick, especially one reared for falconry, still in its downy stage, is known as an eyas[21][22] (sometimes spelled eyass). The word arose by mistaken division of Old French un niais, from Latin presumed nidiscus (nestling) from nidus (nest). The technique of hunting with trained captive birds of prey is known as falconry. Compared to other birds of prey, the fossil record of the falcons is not well distributed in time. For years, the oldest fossils tentatively assigned to this genus were from the Late Miocene, less than 10 million years ago.[23] This coincides with a period in which many modern genera of birds became recognizable in the fossil record. As of 2021, the oldest falconid fossil is estimated to be 55 million years old.[24][25] Given the distribution of fossil and living Falco taxa, falcons are probably of North American, African, or possibly Middle Eastern or European origin. Falcons are not closely related to other birds of prey, and their nearest relatives are parrots and songbirds.[26] Falcons are roughly divisible into three or four groups. The first contains the kestrels (probably excepting the American kestrel);[17] usually small and stocky falcons of mainly brown upperside colour and sometimes sexually dimorphic; three African species that are generally gray in colour stand apart from the typical members of this group. The fox and greater kestrels can be told apart at first glance by their tail colours, but not by much else; they might be very close relatives and are probably much closer to each other than the lesser and common kestrels. Kestrels feed chiefly on terrestrial vertebrates and invertebrates of appropriate size, such as rodents, reptiles, or insects. The second group contains slightly larger (on average) species, the hobbies and relatives. These birds are characterized by considerable amounts of dark slate-gray in their plumage; their malar areas are nearly always black. They feed mainly on smaller birds. Third are the peregrine falcon and its relatives, variably sized powerful birds that also have a black malar area (except some very light color morphs), and often a black cap, as well. They are very fast birds with a maximum speed of 390 kilometres per hour. Otherwise, they are somewhat intermediate between the other groups, being chiefly medium grey with some lighter or brownish colours on their upper sides. They are, on average, more delicately patterned than the hobbies and, if the hierofalcons are excluded (see below), this group typically contains species with horizontal barring on their undersides. As opposed to the other groups, where tail colour varies much in general but little according to evolutionary relatedness,[note 1] the tails of the large falcons are quite uniformly dark grey with inconspicuous black banding and small, white tips, though this is probably plesiomorphic. These large Falco species feed on mid-sized birds and terrestrial vertebrates. Very similar to these, and sometimes included therein, are the four or so species of hierofalcon (literally, \"hawk-falcons\"). They represent taxa with, usually, more phaeomelanins, which impart reddish or brown colors, and generally more strongly patterned plumage reminiscent of hawks. Their undersides have a lengthwise pattern of blotches, lines, or arrowhead marks. While these three or four groups, loosely circumscribed, are an informal arrangement, they probably contain several distinct clades in their entirety. A study of mtDNA cytochrome b sequence data of some kestrels[17] identified a clade containing the common kestrel and related \"malar-striped\" species, to the exclusion of such taxa as the greater kestrel (which lacks a malar stripe), the lesser kestrel (which is very similar to the common, but also has no malar stripe), and the American kestrel, which has a malar stripe, but its colour pattern – apart from the brownish back – and also the black feathers behind the ear, which never occur in the true kestrels, are more reminiscent of some hobbies. The malar-striped kestrels apparently split from their relatives in the Gelasian, roughly 2.0–2.5 million years ago (Mya), and are seemingly of tropical East African origin. The entire \"true kestrel\" group—excluding the American species—is probably a distinct and quite young clade, as also suggested by their numerous apomorphies. Other studies[27][28][29][30][31] have confirmed that the hierofalcon are a monophyletic group–and that hybridization is quite frequent at least in the larger falcon species. Initial studies of mtDNA cytochrome b sequence data suggested that the hierofalcon are basal among living falcons.[27][28] The discovery of a NUMT proved this earlier theory erroneous.[29] In reality, the hierofalcon are a rather young group, originating at the same time as the start of the main kestrel radiation, about 2 Mya. Very little fossil history exists for this lineage. However, the present diversity of very recent origin suggests that this lineage may have nearly gone extinct in the recent past.[31][32] The phylogeny and delimitations of the peregrine and hobby groups are more problematic. Molecular studies have only been conducted on a few species, and the morphologically ambiguous taxa have often been little researched. The morphology of the syrinx, which contributes well to resolving the overall phylogeny of the Falconidae,[33][34] is not very informative in the present genus. Nonetheless, a core group containing the peregrine and Barbary falcons, which, in turn, group with the hierofalcon and the more distant prairie falcon (which was sometimes placed with the hierofalcon, though it is entirely distinct biogeographically), as well as at least most of the \"typical\" hobbies, are confirmed to be monophyletic as suspected.[27][28] Given that the American Falco species of today belong to the peregrine group, or are apparently more basal species, the initially most successful evolutionary radiation seemingly was a Holarctic one that originated possibly around central Eurasia or in (northern) Africa. One or several lineages were present in North America by the Early Pliocene at latest. The origin of today's major Falco groups—the \"typical\" hobbies and kestrels, for example, or the peregrine-hierofalcon complex, or the aplomado falcon lineage—can be quite confidently placed from the Miocene-Pliocene boundary through the Zanclean and Piacenzian and just into the Gelasian, that is from 2.4 to 5.3 Mya, when the malar-striped kestrels diversified. Some groups of falcons, such as the hierofalcon complex and the peregrine-Barbary superspecies, have only evolved in more recent times; the species of the former seem to be 120,000 years old or so.[31] The sequence follows the taxonomic order of White et al. (1996),[35] except for adjustments in the kestrel sequence. Several more paleosubspecies of extant species also been described; see species accounts for these. \"Sushkinia\" pliocaena from the Early Pliocene of Pavlodar (Kazakhstan) appears to be a falcon of some sort. It might belong in this genus or a closely related one.[36] In any case, the genus name Sushkinia is invalid for this animal because it had already been allocated to a prehistoric dragonfly relative. In 2015 the bird genus was renamed Psushkinia.[44] The supposed \"Falco\" pisanus was actually a pigeon of the genus Columba, possibly the same as Columba omnisanctorum, which, in that case, would adopt the older species name of the \"falcon\".[37] The Eocene fossil \"Falco\" falconellus (or \"F.\" falconella) from Wyoming is a bird of uncertain affiliations, maybe a falconid, maybe not; it certainly does not belong in this genus. \"Falco\" readei is now considered a paleosubspecies of the yellow-headed caracara (Milvago chimachima).",

                "content": "The game between the New England Patriots and the Buffalo Bills had no meaning for playoff concerns, but it was still important for one reason: a loss for the Patriots would mean that they would hold the first overall pick in the 2025 NFL draft. But that's not what happened. It was a golden opportunity to try and test new things. Drake Maye, who had been questionable for the entire week, played just a few snaps before giving way for Joe Milton to take over as the quarterback for the day. For the Bills, however, with the number two seed already guaranteed, there was also no reason to play its starters in a meaningless game, and Mitchell Trubisky took over. Even with the win, head coach Jerod Mayo was fired from New England after just one season. Looking to predict NFL playoff Scenarios? Try our NFL Playoff Predictor for real-time simulations and stay ahead of the game! A win is rarely a bad thing in the NFL, but for New England, this triumph does not have a good taste. They improved from the first to the fourth overall position in the 2025 NFL Draft, missing out on what would likely be a great haul of picks from a team desperate to find a franchise quarterback. Josh Allen did nothing more than play the very first offensive snap of the game to be considered the starter, but overall, it was Mitchell Trubisky doing the work. The backup put together a solid outing with no turnovers. A great game from quarterback Joe Milton, who also took over quickly after Drake Maye played in the first series just to be named as the starter for the game. He made great throws and impressed during his time on the field, even if a win was not wanted. Kayshon Boutte did not appear much during the year, but in the season finale, he made great connections with Milton. One of the key aspects for the Patriots to improve in 2025 is their group of pass catchers, and Boutte could have a role to play on the roster. Buffalo Bills Nation!

                "title": "Bills–Patriots rivalry - Wikipedia",
                "content": "The Bills–Patriots rivalry is a National Football League (NFL) rivalry between the Buffalo Bills and New England Patriots. Both teams are members of the East division of the American Football Conference (AFC) and play two games against each other annually. The series debuted in 1960 when both were charter members of the American Football League (AFL). The two clubs have combined for seventeen AFL or AFC championships, the most of any two teams in the AFC East.[a] In addition, either the Patriots or Bills have won the AFC East division in 28 out of 35 seasons since 1988.[b] The rivalry has traditionally been a very competitive one (41–38–1 at the close of the 20th century, in favor of New England) with the Patriots holding slight edges in the 1960s and 1980s, and the Bills with similar edges in the 1970s and 1990s. The series then became notable for its extreme lopsidedness during the New England career of quarterback Tom Brady, whose Patriots compiled a record of 32–3[2][3][4] (3–2 in the five games he missed) against the Bills in his two decades with the franchise (the 2000s and 2010s). Until January 2021 (when Josh Allen passed him) Brady had won more games at Highmark Stadium than any quarterback for Buffalo since 2001,[5][6] and Brady beat the Bills more times in his New England career than any other team.[7] Buffalo is 8–2 against New England in the 2020s. The Bills dominated the Patriots, 47–17, in a wild card matchup of the 2021–22 NFL playoffs that was the first \"perfect offensive game\" (i.e., scoring touchdowns on every drive with no punts, kicks, or turnovers) by any team in NFL history.[8][9] This was the first playoff game in the series since the two franchises joined the NFL in 1970; in their AFL days, Gino Cappelletti kicked four field goals en route to a 26–8 Boston Patriots victory to break their tie of identical regular season records in 1963. The Patriots lead the overall series, 79–51–1. The two teams have met twice in the playoffs, winning one each.[1] On September 16, 1973, O. J. Simpson of the Bills broke the all-time professional football single-game rushing record in this rivalry game against the Patriots.[10] Simpson rushed for 250 yards, breaking the record set by Willie Ellison of the Rams in 1971.[10] In the same game, Simpson became the all-time leading rusher for the Bills franchise, and was described after the game as having \"more yardage than Secretariat\" by Patriots linebacker Edgar Chandler.[10] Chuck Fairbanks, coaching his first game for the Patriots, described Simpson looking \"like Grant going through Richmond.\"[10] Fullback Larry Watkins also rushed for over 100 yards for the Bills, as the team racked up 360 rushing yards for the game.[11] The Bills defeated the Patriots by a score of 31–13.[10] The Bills dominated the Patriots in this rivalry's first playoff game in over 58 years, their first as NFL teams, and their first after the Boston Patriots changed their location name to New England, by a score of 47–17 in the wild card round of the 2021–22 NFL playoffs. This went into record books as the first \"Perfect Offensive Game\" by any NFL team as the Bills, led by Josh Allen, scored touchdowns on every drive of the entire game without any punts, kicks, or turnovers.[12] Allen threw more touchdowns than incomplete passes as the Bills gained 480 yards on just 51 snaps.[13][14] USA Today remarked the game \"served as another reminder that the Bills own the AFC East in these post-Tom Brady years\", while Patriots linebacker Matthew Judon observed that \"it wasn’t one drive, one play or one single player. It was everything. It was the whole game.\"[14] Bills defensive tackle Harrison Phillips opined the game's statistics sounded \"like some Pop Warner stuff.\"[13] It was Patriots' second-worst loss of the 21st century, the three worst of which were all suffered in the Bills–Patriots rivalry.[15] The Bills and Patriots played for the first time in a preseason game during the first season of the American Football League on July 30, 1960. The game was played at War Memorial Stadium in Buffalo, and the Patriots won the game 28–7.[16] The teams met for their first regular season game during Week 3 of the inaugural season of the American Football League in 1960. The game was played at Nickerson Field at Boston University on Friday, September 23, 1960. The Bills scored a touchdown in each of the first two quarters and shut the Patriots out 13–0.[17] The two teams met for their first playoff match in the AFL divisional game in December 1963. The Patriots won 26–8. In this game, Jack Kemp played quarterback for the Bills and Gino Cappelletti made four field goals and two extra points to help lift the Patriots to victory.[18] Throughout the remainder of the decade, the teams would complete a 12–9 record in favor of the Patriots. The Bills won the AFL championship game in 1964 and 1965 and won the division in 1966. The Patriots lost to the San Diego Chargers in their only AFL championship appearance in 1963. Both teams were placed into the AFC East after the AFL–NFL merger. The Bills sustained a winning streak of 9 games from 1971 to 1975.[19] The two teams played a pair of highly competitive games in the 1974 season. The Bills withstood a late Patriots rally at Rich Stadium to win, 30–28. Two weeks later, the Bills edged the Patriots, 29–28, when a last-second field goal attempt by the Patriots was blocked. Two years after his NFL record rushing game in this rivalry against the Pats, Simpson again had one of the most dramatic games of his career on November 23, 1975, against the Patriots. Simpson scored four touchdowns (including two passes from Joe Ferguson) as the Bills won, 45–31. Patriots rookie Steve Grogan threw for 365 yards and two touchdowns but was intercepted three times. 1976 was Simpson's final year in Buffalo; on October 24 Simpson rushed for 110 yards and two touchdowns in a 26–22 Patriots win. Two weeks later, on November 7, Simpson was held to just eight rushing yards before being ejected following a scuffle at midfield; Patriots rookie Mike Haynes ran back a second quarter punt 89 yards for a touchdown, the first such touchdown in Patriots history. The Patriots won the game, 20–10, completing their first season sweep of the Bills since 1968.[20] The Bills would go on to win the decade, 12–8. The 1980s was a better decade for the Patriots, as they won the decade series 13–6. The Patriots also completed their own 11-game winning streak over the Bills from January 1983 to September 1988. The Bills began to rebuild their team in the late 1980s with the additions of Jim Kelly at quarterback, Thurman Thomas as running back, Andre Reed as a receiver, Bruce Smith on defense, and Marv Levy as coach. The Bills bested the Patriots to win the AFC East division four years in a row from 1988 to 1992. During the final stretch of the 1980s, the Bills took three out of four meetings with the Patriots.[19] The Bills would regain their edge in this decade, winning it 12–8. In the 1990 season, the Bills reached the Super Bowl for the first time, in Super Bowl XXV. The Bills continued to dominate the Patriots in the early 1990s, winning eight of the first nine games, including five straight. New England, however, made the rivalry more competitive with the addition of Drew Bledsoe as quarterback and the hiring of Parcells as head coach. The Bills also saw many of their Super Bowl players leave during this time period. By the end of the 1990s, the Bills led the decade with 12 wins to the Patriots' 8 wins.[19] Throughout the decade, the two teams combined to win the AFC East six times, with the Patriots reaching the Super Bowl in 1996 and the Bills reaching the Super Bowl in 1990, 1991, 1992, and 1993. The decade saw several memorable games between the two. On September 11, 1994, Buffalo led 28–14 at the half and 35–21 at the start of the fourth quarter after Mike Lodish grabbed a Patriots fumble at the New England goalline. The Patriots scored two touchdowns to tie the game, but Buffalo won 38–35 after Steve Christie booted a 32-yard field goal as time expired. Late that season the Bills hosted the Patriots. Buffalo was 7–7 while the Patriots were 8–6. The Patriots erased a 17–3 gap by scoring 38 unanswered points. Frank Reich, replacing Jim Kelly, was intercepted twice and the Bills fumbled three times; Ricky Reynolds ran back a Buffalo fumble for a touchdown. The 41–17 Patriots win eliminated Buffalo from the playoffs. 1996 was Jim Kelly's last season; his Bills won 17–10 on September 8 on a 63-yard touchdown throw to Quinn Early and then on a last-second goal line stand. On October 27, the Bills had an 18–15 lead at the two-minute warning; Curtis Martin ran in a ten-yard score, then Willie McGinest intercepted Kelly and ran in a 46-yard touchdown, but Kelly then completed a 48-yard touchdown off two Patriots defenders to Andre Reed; the onside kick failed and the Patriots won 28–25. The 1998 season saw the return of Doug Flutie, who'd been Patriots quarterback in 1988–89; he replaced Rob Johnson as Bills quarterback after Buffalo started 1–3. Flutie led the Bills to win four of his first five starts, including a 13–10 victory over the Patriots at Rich Stadium on November 15, but on November 29 in Flutie's return to Foxboro Stadium the Patriots, despite a broken index finger for Drew Bledsoe, rallied to a controversial last-second touchdown to Ben Coates and a 25–21 Patriots win that was aided by a pass interference penalty against the Bills as time expired. The 2000s was the most lopsided decade for the rivalry to date.[21][22][23] On November 5, 2000, Flutie and the Bills defeated the Patriots and new head coach Bill Belichick at Foxboro Stadium 16–13 in overtime. But after this the Patriots won 18 of the next 19 against the Bills. This decade also saw several notable personnel changes. Following New England's 2001 championship year, Drew Bledsoe was traded by New England to Buffalo in 2002. Lawyer Milloy was then cut after the 2003 preseason and was immediately signed by Buffalo.[24] Doug Flutie, released by the Bills after 2000, joined the Patriots by way of the San Diego Chargers in 2005. The Patriots assembled a five-game winning streak over the Bills in the beginning of the decade, which was snapped when Buffalo defeated the Patriots 31–0 in 2003. However, the Patriots then defeated the Bills by the same score later in the season. That win began a 15-game winning streak for the Patriots against the Bills stretching through 2010. The Bills did come close to winning on two occasions, but lost both times due to fourth quarter gaffes, surrendering a safety in 2006 to lose 19–17,[25] and fumbling a kickoff return to set up New England's game-winning touchdown in 2009.[26] On December 28, 2008, the 10–5 Patriots needed a win and help from other teams to win the AFC East, while the 7–8 Bills were wrapping up the ninth straight season without a playoff berth. Played with severe wind gusts that required stadium officials to use ropes to keep the goalposts from swaying, the game was a 13–0 Patriots win as Matt Cassel, subbing for injured Tom Brady, threw only eight passes. However, the Patriots fell short of the division title. The game on September 26, 2010, was noteworthy on several levels. The Patriots won 38–30, marking the 400th win in the history of the Patriots franchise (regular-season and playoffs). It was first start of the season for Buffalo's former backup quarterback Ryan Fitzpatrick. Randy Moss caught two touchdowns; they turned out to be his last with the Patriots. On September 25, 2011, the Bills came back from a 21–0 deficit to defeat the Patriots 34–31 and snap the Patriots' 15-game winning streak.[27] Despite this win, the Patriots won the final meeting of the season, on January 1, 2012, erasing a 21–0 Bills lead to win 49–21[28] On September 30, 2012, the Patriots erased a 21–7 Bills lead in the third quarter by outscoring them, 45–7 on six straight touchdowns, winning 52–28.[29] On November 11, 2012, the Bills stayed toe-to-toe with the Patriots; down, 37–31, the Bills were driving until Devin McCourty intercepted a Fitzpatrick pass in the endzone.[30] Following the death of long time Bills owner Ralph Wilson, the Bills were sold to Buffalo Sabres owners Terry Pegula and his wife Kim.[31] In his first game as Bills owner the Bills team hosted the Patriots on October 12, 2014, a 37–22 Patriots win. Tom Brady threw for 361 yards - his 60th 300-yard game - and four touchdowns, including a 43-yard strike to Brian Tyms.[32] In Week 17, the Bills won their first matchup at Gillette Stadium since the facility's construction. It was Buffalo's first regulation win in New England in over 20 years. Having clinched home field advantage throughout the playoffs, the Patriots only played Brady during the first half of the game before replacing him with Jimmy Garoppolo in the second half. Neither quarterback found the endzone in the 17–9 Buffalo win.[33] After the 2014 season, Buffalo hired former New York Jets head coach Rex Ryan.[34] When asked if the Jets would be his focus during the 2015 season, Ryan admitted that the Patriots would still be his number one target.[35] 2016 saw the Patriots hosting the Bills in week 4. The Patriots faced a shortage at quarterback, as Tom Brady was suspended in the aftermath of the Deflategate scandal and primary backup Jimmy Garoppolo was sidelined with an injury. As a result, third-string quarterback Jacoby Brissett made the start for the Patriots.[36] Unable to overcome a strong defensive showing from the Bills and an efficient performance by quarterback Tyrod Taylor, Brissett and the Patriots lost 16–0. It was the first shutout loss at home for New England since 1993.[37] During the rematch later that season, in which the Patriots won 41–25 with Brady's return, a spectator notoriously tossed a sex toy onto the field in the middle of a play,[38] starting a trend that would carry on in subsequent seasons.[39][40] During a game with playoff implications on December 3, 2017, Patriots tight end and Buffalo native Rob Gronkowski hit Bills cornerback Tre'Davious White with a flying elbow after White intercepted Tom Brady in garbage-time. Though the game was already decided at that point with the Patriots going on to win 23–3, the play added tension between the teams.[41] During the rematch just three weeks later, Buffalo raced to a 16–13 lead in the third quarter, but ultimately lost 37–16 as Brady led three consecutive touchdown drives. Another controversial moment occurred when Bills receiver Kelvin Benjamin had a touchdown reception overturned during the second quarter.[42] In a game reminiscent of the first Bills–Patriots game of 2011, the two teams met at New Era Field in September 2019 with undefeated records and the division lead on the line. However, the game was a defensive struggle as opposed to an offensive shootout, with both Tom Brady and Bills quarterback Josh Allen being held to under 153 passing yards apiece. The Patriots emerged victorious after holding an early 13–0 lead, which proved too much for Buffalo to overcome due to numerous turnovers and Allen leaving the game in the fourth quarter due to injury. The final score was 16–10 in favor of New England.[43] The two teams again met later in the season on a Saturday NFL Network Special with the division title on the line; as with the first matchup, the final result was within one touchdown's score, with the Patriots prevailing 24–17 after the Patriots staged a successful goal-line stand in the closing minutes of the game. (Both teams had already clinched a wild-card bid at minimum.)[44] This would be Brady's final win as a Patriot, as the Patriots lost their final regular season game to the Miami Dolphins and were eliminated from the playoffs a week later in a Wild Card round loss to the Tennessee Titans; Brady, who was said by USA Today Sports to make Bills fans \"cringe when they hear his name\" and called the \"creator of Buffalo nightmares\" by Yahoo Sports, signed with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers in free agency during the offseason.[45][3][4] His record of 32–3 against the Bills while with the Patriots was called simply \"ridiculous\" by Sports Illustrated.[2] The current decade has begun in favor of the Bills, who hold a 7–2 edge including a historic playoff domination of the Patriots in January 2022.[46] In the first game of this new decade, the two teams met at Bills Stadium on November 1, 2020. This game was yet another tightly contested game between the two opponents, with both teams opting to rely primarily on their run games. After a 28-yard field goal put the Bills up 24–21, the Patriots would drive down the field in the final minutes of the fourth quarter, reaching Buffalo's 19 yard line. However, the Bills recovered the football after the Patriots' new quarterback, Cam Newton, fumbled with 31 seconds left in the game, giving the Bills their first win over New England since 2016, breaking a 7-game winning streak for the Patriots in the series.[47] Buffalo would go on to claim the division title in week 15, ending New England's streak of division titles at 11 years, an NFL-record.[48] The two teams met again at Gillette Stadium in Foxborough later in the season. This game was dominated by the Bills, with Buffalo mostly relying on their passing game. Bills quarterback Josh Allen threw four touchdown passes as the Bills would go on to win 38–9, the worst loss of New England coach Bill Belichick's career up to that point. This marked the first time that the Bills swept the Patriots in the season series since the 1999 season.[49] It stands as the worst home loss for the Patriots in the 21st century and the worst loss anywhere since the Bills defeated them 31–0 at home in 2003.[50] The following year, Buffalo and New England would find each other battling for the division lead throughout the season. During their first meeting on December 6, which was impacted by winds greater than 40 miles per hour, the Patriots only threw the ball 3 times with rookie quarterback Mac Jones, running the ball 46 times, including a 64-yard touchdown run by Damien Harris, as Buffalo opted to pass more. The Bills scored a touchdown on just one of their four redzone possessions, failing to score on their final two attempts and allowing New England to win 14–10.[51] Buffalo won the week 16 rematch in New England 33–21, taking advantage of the normalized weather conditions as Allen passed for over 300 yards and 3 touchdowns. Jones, however, was held to less than 150 yards passing with two interceptions and 14 of 32 passes completed.[52] In 2022 came \"The Perfect Offensive Game\" by the Bills against the Patriots in the wild card round of the playoffs; the 47–17 loss was one of the three worst losses of the Patriots in the 21st century, all three of which were suffered at the hands of the Bills in this rivalry.[15] The 2022 season saw Buffalo easily defeat New England 24–10 in the game in Foxborough. In the second meeting in Buffalo, the Bills were playing their first game following the collapse of Damar Hamlin the previous game against the Bengals; because that game ended up being cancelled and the Kansas City Chiefs finished with a 14–3 record to clinch the AFC's #1 seed, Buffalo at 12–3 was no longer able to finish atop the conference, but did defeat New England 35–23, eliminating the Patriots from playoff contention after a series of close losses late in the season. The game was notable for Buffalo's Nyheim Hines returning two kickoffs for touchdowns, including on the opening kickoff the first play after Hamlin's hospitalization. After another sweep by Buffalo during the 2022 regular season, New England upset the Bills in Foxboro with a 29–25 win, as Mac Jones, who had one of the best performances in his career, led a game-winning touchdown drive.[53] The win was one of only a few for New England, which suffered its worst season since 1992. The Bills beat the Patriots 27–21 in the rematch in Buffalo thanks to several Patriots turnovers, clinching their fifth straight season with double-digit wins.[54] There have been several players who have played for the Bills and Patriots, including: In addition to players, the two teams have shared head coaches. Lou Saban was the first coach in Patriots history but was fired after five games of the 1961 season. He took over the Bills in 1962 and won two American Football League titles (1964–65). After a five-season period in Denver he returned to the Bills for the 1972–76 period.[71] Hank Bullough coached both teams: He was co-head coach (with Ron Erhardt) for the Patriots at the end of 1978 and coached the Bills for the final twelve games of 1985 and the first nine games of 1986.[72] Pepper Johnson joined the Bills coaching staff in 2014 after fourteen seasons on the Patriots staff.[73] Brian Daboll was hired as the Bills' offensive coordinator on January 14, 2018, having previously served as the Patriots' tight-end coach.[74] The Bills–Patriots rivalry was parodied in the 2014 Family Guy episode \"3 Acts of God\" in which the teams' levels of success at the time were reversed. In the first part of the episode, Peter Griffin—along with his family and friends—attends a game between his hometown Patriots and the Bills at Gillette Stadium, which the Patriots lose following a last-minute blunder, leading to their 10th straight loss. This convinces Peter and his friends that God hates the Patriots.[75] The episode also features former Bills players Mario Williams and C. J. Spiller guest starring as themselves.[76] Ryan Fitzpatrick was also slated to guest star, but his part was cut as he was no longer on the Bills' roster at the time of the episode's airing.[75]",

                "content": "PHILADELPHIA - The New York Giants have found nothing but frustration, agony and despair in Philadelphia over the past decade. There's now a total of 12 consecutive losses, including their playoff defeat that ended Brian Daboll's first season as head coach, for the Giants here at Lincoln Financial Field. Will this game represent the last one of Daboll’s tenure, or that of general manager Joe Schoen? We won't know that until Daboll and Schoen meet with Giants co-owners John Mara and Steve Tisch, which is expected to happen at some point this week, likely later Monday or possibly even Tuesday - so there may not be an immediate answer on their fates. What we do know: one of the worst seasons in Giants history - in a year where they hoped to celebrate their 100th year anniversary - has mercifully come to an end, poetically in the stadium where they have endured some of their greatest heartache in recent memory. The Giants (3-14) dropped a 20-13 decision to the Eagles, who rested most of their starters, including Saquon Barkley, in preparation for the playoffs. In terms of the Giants' lineup, their mixing and matching resembled that of a preseason game for much of the afternoon. By virtue of the Giants' defeat, they will pick no lower than No. 4 in the 2025 NFL Draft. A Patriots victory over the Bills - they're leading 20-16 in the fourth quarter - would allow the Giants to jump to No. 3 overall. The Giants have not won at Lincoln Financial Field since 2013, and on that day when they last did, Josh Brown kicked five field goals, Peyton Hillis was the leading rusher and Victor Cruz was the leading receiver for Tom Coughlin's team. Chip Kelly's offense with the Eagles was all the NFL could talk about. Michael Vick and Matt Barkley were at quarterback in place of an injured Nick Foles. And Eli Manning passed Phil Simms as the franchise's all-time leader in yards passing in that game. On Sunday, Giants rookie Malik Nabers established a new team record for receptions in a season (109), breaking the mark set by Steve Smith in 2009. He finished with five catches for 64 yards and a touchdown, ending his first campaign with 109 receptions, 1,204 yards and seven touchdowns. Here's how the rest of the game played out: Malik Nabers is in the end zone again, and yet again, he has done it in pretty spectacular fashion. The Giants' rookie caught a 45-yard touchdown from Drew Lock, absorbing a hit at the 10-yard line, keeping his balance along the sideline before diving into the end zone near the front right pylon for the score. He now has 109 catches on the season. One quarter left in what has been a brutal season for the Giants. Tanner McKee tossed his second touchdown of the game and the Eagles extended their lead. At this point, the defensive lineup for the Giants resembles a preseason game. The Eagles have been there from the start. Malik Nabers now has the most catches in a single season in Giants history, surpassing Steve Smith's previous mark of 107 set in 2009. Nabers is at 108 with his fourth reception and the Giants got on the board with a Graham Gano field goal. A lot of nothing going on, other than Malik Nabers surpassing what was Puka Nacua's rookie record for receptions with three catches. The Giants have 84 yards of total offense and Nabers is at 106, so he'll hold the mark for wide receivers. Raiders rookie tight end Brock Bowers broke Nacua's record last week and sits at 108 heading into today's action. The Eagles backups ... and Dallas Goedert, who has four catches for 55 yards in the first quarter, including a grab on fourth and 2 to keep the chains moving. Well, that was quick. After the Giants went for it and failed on a fourth-and-8 at midfield, the Eagles marched right down the field and found the end zone with Tanner McKee hitting Ainias Smith for the touchdown. GIANTS EAGLES The pick: Eagles 17, Giants 14 Why: The Eagles won't be playing many of their starters, and that includes Saquon Barkley, whose run at the NFL record should take a backseat to Philly's chances in the NFC playoffs. It's hard to imagine the Giants duplicating their performance from the victory over the Colts, although Malik Nabers needs four catches to set the Giants' single season record for receptions currently held by Steve Smith (107, 2009).

                "content": "The Philadelphia Eagles and the New York Giants met in Week 18 of the regular season, in a game without a lot of meaning for both teams. The Eagles, already qualified for the playoffs, rested almost all of their key starters ahead of the Wild Card Round game. The Giants, on the other hand, would not complain about a loss, as they wanted to keep themselves with a high pick in the 2025 NFL draft. Although neither team had much of an incentive in this game, with Philadelphia locked in the second NFC seed, it was a good opportunity to assess some of their backups and get ready for the January run. Looking to predict NFL playoff Scenarios? Try our NFL Playoff Predictor for real-time simulations and stay ahead of the game! The Giants had no real incentive to win this game, and they lost indeed. They did put up a fight in the second half, but ultimately, the Eagles did just enough to keep themselves afloat, even if most of their starters did not step foot into the game. Apart from his interception, Lock mostly played a solid game, with a great throw to Malik Nabers in a touchdown but not much impressive after. He will remain a backup in the NFL in 2025, but there's no chance he'll start the season as a starter for any team. With another good performance, Nabers finished the season with 109 receptions, 1,204 yards and seven touchdowns, playing with below-average quarterbacks throughout the year. Even if this isn't the most exciting season for New York fans, at least they can be happy with the young star receiver. Jalen Hurts was never going to play in this game, but Philadelphia decided to give the starting nod to McKee with Kenny Pickett suffering from a problem in the ribs. And he impressed, with 269 passing yards, two touchdowns and no turnovers. Dallas Goedert was one of the few starters who saw game-time in this Week 18 game. The team wanted to give him a few plays to, as they defined, \"knock off the rust\". The tight end has been injured, but he's an important player in the Eagles' scheme. Giants Nation!

                "content": "James Lee Williams (12 April 1992 – January 2025), known professionally as The Vivienne, was a British drag performer, known for being appointed as the UK Drag Ambassador in 2015 for American reality television series RuPaul's Drag Race. He later competed in and won the first series of RuPaul's Drag Race UK in 2019, and competed again in the seventh season of RuPaul's Drag Race All Stars in 2022. He became the first drag performer to compete on Dancing on Ice in 2023, appearing as a contestant on the fifteenth series, in which he finished in third place. The Vivienne delved into other ventures such as releasing his debut extended play (EP), Bitch on Heels (2022). He starred as the Wicked Witch of the West for The Wizard of Oz in the 2024 UK tour. Williams was born and raised in North Wales and moved to Liverpool at 16 years old. He attended Rydal Penrhos in Colwyn Bay.[1] He was of Welsh and Romani heritage.[2] Williams was given the name The Vivienne, because she was known for wearing Vivienne Westwood clothing, adding the definite article to make it unique. Her first drag show was located in Liverpool and has worked in various bars such as Superstar Boudoir.[3] The Vivienne competed in a one-day event judged by RuPaul, Katie Price, and Jonathan Ross, taking place at Café de Paris. She placed in the top two alongside drag performer La Voix, and was crowned as the UK Ambassador for RuPaul's Drag Race on 28 May 2015.[4] The Vivienne was later flown to Los Angeles and made a cameo appearance for the eight series of RuPaul's Drag Race (2016).[5] On 21 August 2019, The Vivienne was announced as one of the ten contestants to be competing in the first series of RuPaul's Drag Race UK.[6] In September 2019, she participated in Jag Race, a racing competition in collaboration with Jaguar Cars, and raced for Sahir House, a charity based in her hometown of Liverpool that provides a space in which people can speak freely without fear of prejudice, stigma, abuse or exploitation in relation to HIV.[7] In November 2019, she was crowned the first winner of RuPaul's Drag Race UK. In November to December 2019, The Vivienne, alongside the cast of the first series of RuPaul's Drag Race UK embarked on a tour hosted by Drag Race alum Alyssa Edwards.[8] The show saw The Vivienne and Baga Chipz reprise their Snatch Game impersonations of Donald Trump and Margaret Thatcher respectively, to host a fictional television news show, and consisted of six episodes as of January 2020.[9] At DragCon UK in January 2020 an additional episode was filmed with The Vivienne and Baga appearing as themselves.[10] Guests on the web series included fellow Drag Race UK alumni Sum Ting Wong as Queen Elizabeth II and Cheryl Hole as Gemma Collins.[11][12] In March 2020, World of Wonder announced six-part series The Vivienne Takes on Hollywood, documenting The Vivienne travelling to Los Angeles in order to make a music video. The show premiered on BBC Three on 9 April, and simultaneously started streaming on WOW Presents Plus.[13][14] The same month, The Vivienne, once again alongside Baga Chipz, started presenting the UK version of I Like to Watch, a web series produced by Netflix in which they humorously review Netflix programming.[15] In July 2020, The Vivienne voiced as Donald Trump in the BBC Three documentary Trump in Tweets.[16] She was one of the four competitors who appeared in the special Christmas edition of The Great British Sewing Bee that was transmitted on New Year's Eve 2020 on BBC One.[17] In June 2021, The Vivienne made a guest appearance as herself in the ITV soap opera, Emmerdale.[18] In January 2022, The Vivienne starred in Channel 4's Celebrity Hunted, in aid of Stand Up to Cancer.[19] In April 2022, The Vivienne was announced as part of the seventh season of RuPaul's Drag Race All Stars, whereby former winners of the franchise returned for the title of \"Queen of All Queens\".[20] In October 2022, she was announced to be competing in the fifteenth series of ITV ice-skating reality show, Dancing on Ice, setting her to be the first drag artist to participate in the show.[21] On 12 March 2023, The Vivienne finished in third place.[22] In June 2023, The Vivienne presented the award for \"Scene of the Year\" at the 2023 British Soap Awards.[23] Williams married David Ludford in 2019.[24][25] In April 2023, the couple announced their separation.[26] In June 2023, Williams was the victim of a homophobic attack in a McDonald's restaurant in Liverpool.[27] In a statement, Merseyside Police confirmed that \"a man made homophobic comments towards him [The Vivienne] and then proceeded to punch him in the face before fleeing the scene\".[28] Williams utilised the attack as a way of highlighting the fact that homophobia still exists in 2023 and for members of the LGBT+ community to remain vigilant when out in public.[29] In December 2023, 51-year-old Alan Whitfield from Everton was found guilty of assault motivated by homophobia.[30] He was sentenced to 12 weeks in prison with an 18-month suspended sentence on 5 January 2024.[31] On 5 January 2025, it was announced that Williams had died at the age of 32.[32][33] In a statement from his agent, it was confirmed that Williams had \"[died] over the weekend\" and that [his family] would not be releasing any further details at present.[34] As of 5 January 2025,[update] the cause of death is unknown.[35] The RuPaul's Drag Race social media accounts paid tribute to Williams, memorialising him as a \"beacon of creativity and authenticity\" and that [The Vivienne] \"embodied what it [meant] to be a true champion\". Tributes were paid by several of The Vivienne's Drag Race co-stars, as well as Michelle Visage, who described Williams as a \"beacon to so many\" and added that he would be \"so missed\".[36][37] (with the Cast of RuPaul's Drag Race UK) (RuPaul featuring the Cast of RuPaul's Drag Race UK)",

James Lee Williams, the popular British drag performer, actor and singer who went by the name The Vivienne, has died aged 32. The news was announced by their publicist, Simon Jones, who shared a statement from social media. “It is with immense sadness that we let you know our beloved James Lee Williams – The Vivienne, has passed this weekend,” Jones said. “James was an incredibly loved, warm-hearted, and amazing person. Their family are heartbroken at the loss of their son, brother, and uncle. “They are so proud of the wonderful things James achieved in their life and career.” The Vivienne, who was born in Wales and based in Liverpool, rose to prominence after competing in and eventually winning the first season of RuPaul’s Drag Race UK in 2019, having previously been appointed as the UK Drag Ambassador to the US show four years earlier. Among their many memorable moments on RuPaul’s Drag Race UK was their candid discussions about dealing with drug addiction: “I didn’t really expect to talk about it, but when you’re on a reality TV show you do open up a lot more, because it’s just a pressure cooker of emotions and personalities,” they said in a 2021 interview. They revealed that they often received at least 30 messages a day from fans who had been inspired to get clean. “I also get messages off dads who have just discovered their son really loves Drag Race and they think maybe they’re gay, [saying] ‘I’ve tried everything to try and help him along, what can I do?’ When I reply, I’ll usually say something like, ‘You’re doing everything right. They’re young, they’ll find their people, they’ll find their tribe, they’ll find out who they are – as long as you are there to love and support them, you’re doing everything right’,” they added. After Drag Race, The Vivienne went on to appear in the critically acclaimed, award-winning medical drama This is Going to Hurt, based on Adam Kay’s memoir of the same name. They were the first drag performer to compete on Dancing on Ice in 2023, finishing in third place. In 2024, they starred as the Wicked Witch of the West in a UK and Ireland tour of The Wizard of Oz musical, calling it “the most iconic story ever told”.

Jones’s statement concluded: “We please ask that James’s family are given the time and privacy they now need to process and grieve.” In a separate post, he said these were words he “never wanted to write”, adding: “No one has ever made me laugh in my life as much as Viv did. Their comic genius and quick wit was like no other. “I’m so proud and lucky that Viv was such a big part of my life every day for the last five years.” Jones continued: “It’s tragic that their career was only just beginning. In musical theatre Viv had found a space and career they loved, excelled and thrived in. I am heartbroken and devastated at this news. RIP my wonderful friend, You left us way too soon.” Following the news, tributes immediately began pouring in from hundreds of The Vivienne’s friends and supporters. “I don’t have the words. Utterly heartbroken,” RuPaul’sDrag Race judge Michelle Visage wrote. Sharing photos of herself with The Vivienne, she said: “I don't know how to say how I feel. My darling @thevivienne_ we go back to when I started coming over here to the UK. “You were always there, always laughing, always giving, always on point. Your laughter, your wit, your talent, your drag. I loved all of it but I loved your friendship most of all.” She added: “I love you my darling. You will be so missed my lovely. May your light shine fiercely, forever.” “I’m so sorry,” fellow drag artist Bimini wrote on Jones’s post. “I’m in total shock.” Former Little Mix star and solo artist Perrie Edwards shared a series of heart emojis, while singer Nicole Appleton wrote: “Oh Simon I’m so sorry sending you love.” Emmerdale actor Lisa Riley called The Vivienne an “incredible human”. “Never stop shining your beautiful light over us all,” she wrote. “Love and strength to all your family.

                "content": "The Miami Dolphins entered Sunday with one scenario in mind: defeat the New York Jets, and they would make the playoffs if the Denver Broncos also lost to the Kansas City Chiefs. But they would have to do it without star quarterback Tua Tagovailoa, who was sidelined with a hip injury. The Jets, meanwhile, had long been out of playoff contention. However, they were still looking to end the season on a high note in what could be the final game of Aaron Rodgers' storied career. Looking to predict NFL playoff Scenarios? Try our NFL Playoff Predictor for real-time simulations and stay ahead of the game! Both teams traded losses of possession to begin the game - first a Dolphins punt, then a Jets interception that was punished with a field goal. After that, both teams traded punts on the next three drives before the Dolphins scored another field goal to end the first quarter. The second quarter began with an exchange of punts, before the Jets finally seized the lead via an Aaron Rodgers touchdown to Tyler Conklin - the 500th of the multiple-time MVP's career. Then they got a major break when Ashtyn Davis intercepted Tyler Huntley. However, they proceeded to lose the ball on downs on the ensuing drive. Fortunately, the defense forced a sack fumble on Huntley, which Rodgers proceeded to punish with a touchdown to Allen Lazard plus two-pointer: Another interception on Huntley ended the first half. The second half began with an exchange of losses of possession: first a Jets punt, then a Dolphins fumble that was punished with a field goal after. The rest of the second quarter developed into a very long drive for the Dolphins, who eventually got a touchdown from De’Von Achane in the final quarter. Rodgers responded by finding Davante Adams for six for what could be the last time in his career: Despite already being eliminated from playoff contention after the Broncos’ shutout of the Chiefs was confirmed, the Dolphins continued to fight, with Jonnu Smith catching a touchdown: But Breece Hall sealed the game with a rushing touchdown.

        "Atlanta Falcons": [
            {
                "title": "Atlanta Falcons - Wikipedia",
                "content": "The Atlanta Falcons are a professional American football team based in Atlanta. The Falcons compete in the National Football League (NFL) as a member of the National Football Conference (NFC) South division. The Falcons were founded on June 30, 1965, and joined the NFL in 1966[6] as an expansion team, after the NFL offered then-owner Rankin Smith a franchise to keep him from joining the rival American Football League (AFL). In their 57 years of existence, the Falcons have compiled a record of 390–503–6 (380–489–6 in the regular season and 10–14 in the playoffs), winning division championships in 1980, 1998, 2004, 2010, 2012, and 2016. The Falcons have appeared in two Super Bowls, the first during the 1998 season in Super Bowl XXXIII, where they lost to the Denver Broncos 34–19,[7] and the second 18 years later, a 34–28 overtime loss to the New England Patriots in Super Bowl LI. They are the oldest major professional sports team in America with no championships.[8] The Falcons' current home field is Mercedes-Benz Stadium, which opened for the 2017 season; the team's headquarters and practice facilities are located at a 50-acre (20 ha) site in Flowery Branch,[9] northeast of Atlanta in Hall County. Professional football first came to Atlanta in 1962, when the American Football League (AFL) staged two preseason contests, with one featuring the Denver Broncos vs. the Houston Oilers and the second pitting the Dallas Texans against the Oakland Raiders. Two years later, the AFL held another exhibition, this time with the New York Jets taking on the San Diego Chargers. In 1965, after the Atlanta–Fulton County Stadium (then known simply as Atlanta Stadium) was built, the city of Atlanta felt the time was right to start pursuing professional football.[10] One independent group which had been active in NFL exhibition promotions in Atlanta applied for franchises in both the AFL and NFL, acting entirely on its own with no guarantee of stadium rights. Another group reported it had deposited earnest money for a team in the AFL.[11] With everyone running in different directions, some local businessmen (Cox Broadcasting) worked out a deal and were awarded an AFL franchise on June 8, contingent upon acquiring exclusive stadium rights from city officials.[12][13] NFL Commissioner Pete Rozelle, who had been moving slowly in Atlanta matters, was spurred by the AFL interest and headed on the next plane down to Atlanta to block the rival league's claim on the city of Atlanta.[6][10][13] He forced the city to make a choice between the two leagues;[14] by June 30, the city picked Rankin Smith and the NFL.[10][15] The AFL's original expansion plans in June 1965 were for two new teams in 1966,[16][17] in Atlanta and Philadelphia.[18] It later evolved into the Miami Dolphins in 1966 and the Cincinnati Bengals in 1968. The NFL had planned to add two teams in 1967; the competition with the AFL for Atlanta forced the first to be added a year early in 1966. The odd number of teams (15) resulted in one idle team (bye) each week, with each team playing 14 games over 15 weeks (similar to 1960: 12 games over 13 weeks). The second expansion team, the New Orleans Saints, joined the NFL as planned in 1967 as its sixteenth franchise. The Atlanta Falcons franchise began when it was approved to begin play in 1966 by a unanimous vote of the NFL club owners on June 21, 1965.[19] Rozelle granted ownership nine days later on June 30 to 40-year-old Rankin Smith Sr., an executive vice president of Life Insurance Company of Georgia. He paid $8.5 million, the highest price in NFL history at the time for a franchise.[6] Rozelle and Smith made the deal in about five minutes and the Atlanta Falcons brought the largest and most popular sport to the city of Atlanta. The Atlanta expansion team became the 15th NFL franchise, and they were awarded the first overall pick in the 1966 NFL draft as well as the final pick in each of the first five rounds.[20] They selected consensus All-American linebacker Tommy Nobis from the University of Texas, making him the first-ever Falcon. The league also held the expansion draft six weeks later in which Atlanta selected unprotected players from the 14 existing franchises. Although the Falcons selected many good players in those drafts, they still were not able to win right away.[6] The Atlanta team received its nickname on August 29, 1965. Miss Julia Elliott, a school teacher from Griffin, was singled out from many people who suggested \"Falcons\" as the nickname for the new franchise.[21] She wrote: \"the Falcon is proud and dignified, with great courage and fight. It never drops its prey. It is deadly and has a great sporting tradition.\"[22][23] The Falcons' inaugural season was in 1966, and their first preseason game was on August 1, a loss to the Philadelphia Eagles. Under head coach Norb Hecker, Atlanta lost their first nine regular-season games in 1966; their first victory came on the road against the struggling New York Giants on November 20 in Yankee Stadium. Two weeks later, Atlanta won at Minnesota, and beat St. Louis in Atlanta the next week for their first home win.[24] The team finished with a 1–12–1 record the next year, with the only win coming in Week 7 in a 21–20 win over the Minnesota Vikings in 1967.[25] After a 0–3 start to the 1968 season, Hecker was dismissed.[26] Norm Van Brocklin finished out the season as head coach with a 2–9 record.[27] Van Brocklin continued to coach the team the next season. The team improved to a 6–8 record in 1969.[28] The Falcons had their first Monday Night Football game in Atlanta during the 1970 season, a 20–7 loss to the Miami Dolphins. The team went 4–8–2 in 1970.[29] The only two winning seasons in their first 12 years were 1971 (7–6–1) and 1973 (9–5). In the 1978 season, the 9–7 Falcons qualified for the playoffs for the first time and won the Wild Card game against the Eagles 14–13.[30][31] The following week, they lost to the Dallas Cowboys 27–20 in the Divisional Playoffs.[32] The 1979 team regressed to a 6–10 record.[33] In the 1980 season, after a nine-game winning streak, the Falcons posted a franchise then-best record of 12–4 and captured their first NFC West division title. The next week, their dream season ended at home with a loss to the Cowboys 30–27 in the divisional playoffs. In the strike-shortened 1982 season, the 5–4 Falcons made the playoffs but lost to the Minnesota Vikings, 30–24.[34] Falcons coach Leeman Bennett was fired after the loss.[35] The team then had losing seasons for the next eight years. Dan Henning was hired prior to the 1983 season.[36] In the 1989 NFL draft, the Falcons selected cornerback Deion Sanders in the first round, who helped them for the next four years, setting many records for the franchise.[37] \"Neon Deion\" (a.k.a. \"Prime Time\") had a flashy appeal and helped bring media attention to one of the league's most anonymous franchises. Sanders was also famous for playing on major league baseball teams (New York Yankees and the Atlanta Braves) while simultaneously playing in the NFL. After defeating the New Orleans Saints in the NFC Wild Card game, the Falcons' 1991 season ended in a divisional playoff loss to the Washington Redskins. In the 1991 NFL draft, the Falcons selected quarterback Brett Favre as the 33rd overall pick. During his rookie season, he played in two games where he amassed a record of four passing attempts with no receptions and two interceptions. The following February, Favre was traded to the Green Bay Packers.[38] In 1992, the Atlanta Falcons opened a new chapter in their history moving into the newly constructed Georgia Dome, where the team has defeated all 31 other NFL teams at least once during its time there.[39] In 1998, under recently acquired head coach Dan Reeves, quarterback Chris Chandler and running back Jamal Anderson the \"Dirty Bird\" Falcons had their greatest season to date.[40][41] On November 8, they beat the New England Patriots 41–10, ending a streak of 22 losses at cold-weather sites. The team finished with a franchise-best 14–2 regular-season record and the NFC West division championship.[42] On January 17, 1999, the Falcons upset the top-seeded Vikings at the Hubert H. Humphrey Metrodome in the NFC Championship Game 30–27, in an exciting overtime victory. However, in their first-ever Super Bowl appearance, they lost 34–19 to the defending champion Denver Broncos in Super Bowl XXXIII. In the second game of the Falcons 1999 season, running back Jamal Anderson, who had been a key player in the Falcons' 1998 success, suffered a season-ending knee injury. The Falcons finished the season with a very disappointing 5–11 regular-season record.[43] In 2000, the Falcons suffered through another horrendous season finishing 4–12 and once again missing the playoffs.[44] In the 2001 NFL draft, the Falcons orchestrated a trade with the San Diego Chargers, acquiring the first overall pick (which was used on quarterback Michael Vick) in exchange for wide receiver-return specialist Tim Dwight and the fifth overall pick (used on running back LaDainian Tomlinson).[45] The Falcons finished the 2001 season with a record of 7–9 and missed the playoffs.[46] Jessie Tuggle retired following 14 seasons in Atlanta.[47] On December 6, 2001, billionaire Home Depot co-founder Arthur M. Blank reached a preliminary agreement with the Falcons' Taylor Smith to purchase the team for a reported $545 million.[48] In a special meeting prior to Super Bowl XXXVI in New Orleans on February 2, 2002, NFL owners voted unanimously to approve the deal.[49] The 2002 season saw the Falcons return to the playoffs with a regular-season record of 9–6–1, tying the Pittsburgh Steelers.[50] It was Vick's first year as the starter, and the team, with newly acquired running back Warrick Dunn, delivered the Green Bay Packers their first home playoff loss ever with a 27–7 result in the Wild Card Round.[51] A 20–6 loss to the Donovan McNabb-led Philadelphia Eagles the following week, however, ended the Falcons' season.[52] On March 19, 2003, the Falcons presented their new logo.[53][6] During the 2003 preseason Vick broke his leg and missed the first 12 games of the season. After losing 7 straight games, the decision was made to fire head coach Dan Reeves.[54] Wade Phillips acted as interim coach for the final three games.[55] Although the Falcons won 3 of their last 4 games after the return of Vick, they ended up with a 5–11 record that year.[56] In 2004, a new head coach, Jim L. Mora, was hired and Vick returned for the full season. The Falcons went 11–5, winning their third division title and earning a first-round bye into the playoffs. In the divisional playoffs, the Falcons defeated the St. Louis Rams, 47–17, in the Georgia Dome, advancing to the NFC Championship Game, which they lost to the Eagles, 27–10.[57][58][59] The Falcons again fell short of achieving back-to-back winning seasons in 2005, going 8–8.[60] In 2006, Michael Vick became the first quarterback in league history to rush for more than 1,000 yards in a season, with 1,039.[61] After finishing the season 7–9, however, coach Jim Mora was dismissed.[62] Bobby Petrino, the University of Louisville's football coach, replaced Mora.[63] Before the 2007 season began, Vick was suspended indefinitely by the NFL after pleading guilty to charges involving dog fighting in the state of Virginia.[64] On December 10, 2007, Vick received a 23-month prison sentence and was officially cut from the Atlanta roster.[65] For the 2007 season, the Falcons were forced to start Joey Harrington at quarterback.[66] On December 11, 13 games into his first NFL season as head coach, Bobby Petrino resigned without notice to coach at the University of Arkansas, leaving the beleaguered players only a note in the locker room.[67] Secondary Coach Emmitt Thomas was named interim coach for the final three games of the season on December 12. The Falcons ended the year with a dismal 4–12 record.[68] After the tumultuous and disappointing 2007 season, the Falcons made a number of moves, hiring a new general manager and head coach, drafting a new starting quarterback, and signing a starting running back. On January 13, 2008, the Falcons named former Patriots director of college football scouting Thomas Dimitroff General Manager.[69] On January 23, Jacksonville Jaguars defensive coach and former linebackers coach for the 2000 Super Bowl champion Baltimore Ravens Mike Smith was named the Falcons' new head coach.[70] Chargers back-up running back Michael Turner agreed to a 6-year, $30 million deal on March 2.[71] On April 26, Matt Ryan (quarterback from Boston College) was drafted third overall in the 2008 NFL draft by the Falcons.[72] The Falcons finished the 2008 regular season with a record of 11–5, and the #5 seed in the playoffs.[73] On December 21, 2008, Atlanta beat the Minnesota Vikings 24–17 to clinch a wild card spot, earning a trip to the playoffs for the first time since 2004. The Falcons would go on to lose in the wild-card round of the 2008 NFL playoffs to the eventual NFC champion Arizona Cardinals, 30–24.[74] Matt Ryan started all 16 games in his rookie season and was named the Associated Press Offensive Rookie of the Year.[75] First-year head coach Mike Smith was named 2008 NFL Coach of the Year.[76] Although they failed to make the playoffs in 2009 the team rallied to win their final three regular-season games to record back-to-back winning seasons for the first time in franchise history. The Falcons defeated the Tampa Bay Buccaneers 20–10 in the final game of the season to improve their record to 9–7.[77] In 2010, with a regular-season record of 13–3, the Falcons secured a third straight winning season, their fourth overall divisional title, and the top overall seed in the NFC playoffs; however, the Falcons were overpowered by the eventual Super Bowl XLV champion Green Bay Packers in the NFC Divisional Playoffs 48–21.[78][79] The Falcons scored 414 points – the fifth-most in franchise history.[7] The team sent an NFL-high and franchise-best nine players to the 2011 Pro Bowl.[80] The Falcons made a surprise trade up with the Cleveland Browns in the 2011 NFL draft to select Alabama wide receiver Julio Jones sixth overall. In exchange, the Falcons gave up their first-, second- and fourth-round draft picks in 2011, and their first and fourth draft picks in 2012.[81] Jones, along with teammates Tony Gonzalez and Roddy White, have since been dubbed Atlanta's \"Big Three\" (based on their total number of reception yards).[82] On August 30, 2011, Sports Illustrated senior writer Peter King, who correctly predicted the 2011 Super Bowl, made his predictions for the 2011 season and picked the Falcons to defeat the San Diego Chargers in the 2012 Super Bowl.[83] The Falcons finished the season at 10–6, securing the fifth seed after a Week 17 beatdown of Tampa Bay in which the Falcons pulled their starters after leading 42–0 just 23 minutes into the game.[84] The Falcons then went on to play the New York Giants in a 2011 NFC Wild Card Game at MetLife Stadium in East Rutherford, New Jersey. The first half was a defensive struggle, with the first points coming off of a safety by the Falcons, giving Atlanta a 2–0 lead. In the second quarter, though, Eli Manning connected with Hakeem Nicks for a short touchdown pass to make it 7–2 Giants heading into the second half. Then the Giants took control, as Manning threw for two more touchdown passes to Mario Manningham and Nicks and the defense completed its shutout of the Falcons to give the New York Giants the win, 24–2, and the Falcons their third straight playoff loss with Matt Ryan and Mike Smith.[85] After the season, defensive coordinator Brian VanGorder accepted a coaching job at Auburn University, and the offensive coordinator Mike Mularkey took the head coaching job in Jacksonville.[86] Atlanta exploded out of the gate, going a franchise-best 8–0 and remaining the last unbeaten team in the NFL that year.[87] Their hopes to get an undefeated season came to an end with a 27–31 loss to the division rival Saints. Julio Jones had a remarkable second year, grabbing 10 touchdowns and 1,198 yards. The Falcons finished the season 13–3, and clinched the number one seed in the NFC playoffs.[88][89] The Falcons played the Seattle Seahawks in their first playoff game. Although they went down 28–27 with only 31 seconds left on the clock, Matt Ryan led the team to their first playoff victory, 30–28.[90] It was the only playoff victory in the Mike Smith era. The Atlanta Falcons then advanced to face the San Francisco 49ers. The Falcons seized control of the game early with a Matt Bryant field goal, a trio of Matt Ryan touchdown passes caught by Julio Jones and Tony Gonzalez coupled with outstanding defensive play. By the end of the half, the score was 24–14. The tides of the game began to shift in the second half as the 49ers rallied back with a pair of Frank Gore touchdown runs. Atlanta's offense attempted to reply but were ultimately shut down by the 49er defense. A few series later, late in the 4th quarter with little time remaining, Atlanta found themselves in a 4th and 4 situation at the 10-yard line. The Falcons needed just 10 more yards to secure victory and advance to their first Super Bowl berth in 14 years. Matt Ryan fired a pass to Roddy White which was ultimately broken up by inside linebacker NaVorro Bowman, resulting in a 28–24 defeat.[91] Following the success of the previous season, the Falcons were an expected Super Bowl contender. However, injuries hampered the team's performance and the team finished the season 4–12.[92] With that, the streak of consecutive winning seasons came to an end and Mike Smith had his first losing season as a head coach. Tony Gonzalez, in his final season in the NFL, was selected to the 2014 Pro Bowl as a starter representing Team Rice. Following the conclusion of the 2012 season, director of player personnel Les Snead departed the team to join the St. Louis Rams and Dave Caldwell, assistant to general manager Thomas Dimitroff, left the team to join the Jacksonville Jaguars. Scott Pioli, former GM of the Kansas City Chiefs, was announced as the Falcons' new assistant GM. Mike Smith was given a one-year extension on his contract as head coach. The Falcons had the 6th overall pick in the 2014 NFL draft with which they selected Jake Matthews, who played as offensive tackle for Texas A&M.[93] Despite having another rough season, the Falcons still had an opportunity to qualify for the playoffs at the end of the regular season. The Falcons hosted the Carolina Panthers in their regular season finale, with the winners clinching the NFC South division. Unfortunately, the Falcons lost in a 34–3 blowout as Matt Ryan threw two interceptions that were returned for touchdowns and got sacked six times. The Falcons finished the season 6–10, marking the second consecutive losing season for the team.[94] The following day, Mike Smith was fired after seven seasons as head coach.[95] The Falcons would soon hire Seattle Seahawks defensive coordinator Dan Quinn as the team's 16th head coach.[96] The Falcons had the 8th overall pick in the 2015 NFL draft with which they selected Vic Beasley, a defensive end from Clemson University.[97] In February 2015, the team was investigated by the NFL for alleged use of artificial crowd noise in the Georgia Dome.[98] The Falcons lost a 2016 NFL draft selection as a result of the league's investigation.[99] Dan Quinn's first season saw a 5–0 start, the team's best start in four years. They would then struggle throughout the rest of the season by losing 8 of their last 11 games, resulting in an 8–8 record in the 2015 season.[100] They did, however, give the Panthers their only regular-season loss. The Falcons used their first-round pick in the 2016 NFL draft on safety Keanu Neal from the University of Florida.[101] In the Falcons' 25th and final season in the Georgia Dome, Atlanta lost their week 1 game to the Buccaneers 24–31. The Falcons would then win their next four including one over the Panthers, when the franchise set new records: Matt Ryan threw for 503 yards, and Julio Jones caught 12 passes for 300 yards.[102] Beating the San Francisco 49ers 41–13 in Week 15, the Falcons improved to 9–5 and secured their first winning season since 2012. One week later, the Falcons defeated the Panthers in Charlotte, North Carolina, and clinched their first NFC South division title since 2012. In their last regular-season game at the Georgia Dome, the Falcons defeated the New Orleans Saints, and secured an 11–5 record and a first-round bye.[103] In the divisional round of the playoffs, Atlanta defeated the Seahawks 36–20 in the Georgia Dome, and hosted their last game at the Georgia Dome against the Green Bay Packers in the NFC Championship Game on January 22, 2017.[104] The Falcons defeated the Packers 44–21 to advance to Super Bowl LI as the NFC champions.[105] Atlanta was up 28–3 late in the third quarter, and the New England Patriots scored 31 unanswered points, with the last 6 in the first-ever overtime in the Super Bowl. The Patriots' 25-point comeback was the largest in Super Bowl history.[106] In 2016, the Falcons scored 540 points in the regular season, the seventh-most in NFL history, tied with the Greatest Show on Turf (the 2000 St. Louis Rams).[107] However, the Falcons defense gave up 406 points, 27th in the league.[108] The Falcons moved into their new home, the Mercedes-Benz Stadium, this season.[109] Their first game ever played at the new stadium was a preseason loss to the Arizona Cardinals. The first regular-season game at the new stadium was a rematch of the 2016–17 NFC Championship, with Atlanta defeating Green Bay 34–23.[110] Their first loss of the season was a 23–17 home defeat to the Buffalo Bills in week 4.[111] The team returned to the playoffs with a 10–6 record (albeit with a third-place finish in the NFC South). The Falcons defeated the Los Angeles Rams 26–13 in the Wild Card round, but their 2017 season came to an end a week later in the Divisional Playoff round at the hands of the eventual Super Bowl champion Philadelphia Eagles 15–10.[112][113] The 2018 and 2019 seasons saw the Falcons go 7–9 and miss the postseason both years.[114][115] In their first game with new uniforms, the Falcons lost to the Seattle Seahawks at home 38–25.[116] The Falcons then suffered comebacks made by both the Cowboys on the road (39–40) and then back in Atlanta against the Bears (26–30).[117][118] On October 11, after the team suffered a 23–16 loss at home against the Carolina Panthers and fell to 0–5, the Falcons announced the firings of Quinn and Dimitroff.[119] Defensive coordinator Raheem Morris took over for the rest of the season, leading the team to a 4–12 record.[120] Morris was not retained after the season, and soon joined the Los Angeles Rams as their defensive coordinator.[121] On January 15, 2021, the Falcons announced that Tennessee Titans offensive coordinator Arthur Smith had been named the 18th head coach in franchise history.[122] Four days later, New Orleans Saints executive Terry Fontenot was named the Falcons' new general manager.[123] Tight end Kyle Pitts was selected with the 4th pick of the 2021 draft, and longtime star receiver Julio Jones was traded to the Titans, after publicly requesting a trade from Atlanta.[124][125] The Falcons improved on their record from the prior year, finishing the season with a 7–10 record.[126] On March 21, 2022, the Falcons traded longtime star quarterback Matt Ryan to the Indianapolis Colts.[127] During the 2022 season, the team finished last place in the NFC South with a 7–10 record.[128] The Falcons entered the 2023 seasons with heightened expectations after drafting Texas running back Bijan Robinson with the eighth overall pick of the 2023 draft and making significant improvements in free agency, including signing Jessie Bates and Calais Campbell to improve their defense.[129] However, the team finished with a 7–10 record for the third consecutive season, although they had been in contention for a playoff spot until the final day of the season before a 48–17 loss to the New Orleans Saints on January 7, 2024.[130] The following day, Smith was fired after three years as head coach.[131] On January 25, 2024, the Falcons announced Raheem Morris's return to the organization, this time as the 19th head coach in Falcons history.[132] During the early months of his tenure, Morris faced scrutiny and criticism for his questionable player selection decisions.[133] The Falcons have called three stadiums home in their 51 years of existence, and its third home in their history opened in the late summer of 2017. The first was the Atlanta–Fulton County Stadium, sharing with the Atlanta Braves Major League Baseball team until 1991. In 1992, the Georgia Dome was built, and the Falcons played there from its opening to the 2016 season. The Dome has been frequently used for college football, including Georgia State football and college bowl games such as the Peach Bowl. In an effort to replace the aging Georgia Dome and potentially host a future Super Bowl, team owner Arthur Blank proposed a deal with the city of Atlanta to build a new state-of-the-art stadium not far from where the Georgia Dome is located. Blank will contribute $800 million and the city of Atlanta will contribute an additional $200 million via bonds backed by the city's hotel/motel tax towards the construction of a retractable roof stadium. Blank will contribute additional money for cost overruns if it is needed. The team will provide up to $50 million towards infrastructure costs that weren't included in the construction budget and to retire the remaining debt on the Georgia Dome. In addition, Blank's foundation and the city will each provide $15 million for development in surrounding neighborhoods. Though the total cost of the stadium was initially estimated to be around $1 billion,[134] the total cost was revised to $1.5 billion according to Blank.[135] In March 2013, the Atlanta City Council voted 11–4 in favor of building the stadium.[136] The retractable roof Mercedes-Benz Stadium broke ground in May 2014, and became the third home stadium for the Falcons and the first for the new Atlanta United FC Major League Soccer club upon opening in 2017.[137] The Atlanta Falcons' colors are black, red, silver and white.[138] When the team began play in 1966, the Falcons wore red helmets with a black falcon crest logo. In the center of the helmet was a center black stripe surrounded by two gold stripes and two white stripes. These colors represented the two college rival schools in the state of Georgia; rival schools Georgia Tech Yellow Jackets (white and gold) and the Georgia Bulldogs (red and black). Although the gold was removed after several seasons, the white remains to this day. They wore white pants and either black or white jerseys. At first, the falcon crest logo was also put on the jersey sleeves, but it was replaced by a red and white stripe pattern four years later. They switched from black to red jerseys in 1971, and the club began to wear silver pants in 1978. The facemasks on the helmets were initially gray, becoming white in 1978, and then black in 1984; the team wore black face masks until its 2020 redesign. A prototype white helmet was developed for the team prior to the 1974 season, but was never worn. In 1990, the uniform design changed to black helmets, silver pants, and either black or white jerseys.[139] The numbers on the white jerseys were black, but were changed to red in 1997. (The red numerals could be seen on the away jerseys briefly in 1990.) Both the logo and uniforms changed in 2003. The logo was redesigned with red and silver accents to depict a more powerful, aggressive falcon, which now more closely resembles the capital letter F.[53][140] Although the Falcons still wore black helmets, the new uniforms featured jerseys and pants with red trim down the sides. The uniform design consisted of either black or white jerseys, and either black or white pants. During that same year, a red alternate jersey with black trim was also introduced. The Falcons also started wearing black cleats with these uniforms.[141] In 2004, the red jerseys became the primary jerseys, and the black ones became the alternate, both worn with white pants. In select road games, the Falcons wear black pants with white jerseys. The Falcons wore an all-black combination for home games against their archrivals, the New Orleans Saints, winning the first two contests (24–21 in 2004 and 36–17 in 2005), but losing 31–13 in 2006. The Falcons wore the all-black combination against the New Orleans Saints for four straight seasons starting in 2004, With the last time being in 2007, losing 34–14. They wore the combination again in 2006, against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers in Week 2. The Falcons won that game, 14–3. The Falcons also wore their all-black uniform in 2007 against the New York Giants, and in 2008 against the Carolina Panthers and against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers (for the second time). After that, the black pants and uniforms were retired and the white pants were now used full-time with the regular uniforms. In the 1980s, the Falcons wore their white uniforms at home most of the time because of the heat. When the Falcons started playing in a dome, the team switched to their dark uniforms for home games but have worn their white uniforms at home a few times since switching to the dome. It was announced at the 2009 state of the franchise meeting that the Falcons would wear 1966 throwback uniforms for a couple games during the 2009 season. The Atlanta Falcons wore 1966 throwback jerseys for two home games in 2009 – against the Carolina Panthers on September 20 and against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers on November 29. The Falcons won both of those games. They donned the throwbacks again for 2 games in 2010, against Baltimore and San Francisco, winning both of those games as well. The throwbacks were used twice in 2011 and 2012; both times were against the Panthers and Saints. However, the throwbacks were retired following a 2013 NFL rule requiring only one helmet shell per team. The Falcons unveiled an all-red Color Rush uniform on September 13, 2016; however, due to the fact that the Falcons and the Tampa Bay Buccaneers had similar all-red Color Rush uniforms, the Falcons were unable to wear their Color Rush uniform until the 2017 season.[142][143] Also in 2016, the Falcons unveiled a mixed throwback uniform set. The uniform tops, pants and socks closely resembled their 1960s kits. From 2016 to 2021, due to the NFL's one-shell rule, the Falcons wore the black helmets with the original logo decal similar to the design they wore in the 1990s. However, starting in 2022, with the NFL now reinstating the use of alternate helmets, the Falcons brought back the original red helmets to pair with their throwback uniforms.[144] It was revealed in January 2020 that the Falcons will change uniforms for the 2020 NFL season.[145] The ensuing design featured the return to black as the primary home uniform color for the first time since 2003. Both the primary home and road uniforms featured the \"ATL\" abbreviation in red above either white or black numbers with red drop shadows. The white and black tops are usually paired with either white or black pants. The alternate uniform featured a red/black gradient design and also featured the \"ATL\" abbreviation in white above white numbers with black drop shadows. Black pants are only used with this uniform. All three uniforms feature red side stripes. The current throwback uniform was also retained. In addition, the Falcons switched to matte helmets with the enlarged falcon logo and gray facemasks.[146] The red/black gradient alternates only lasted three seasons before it was removed from the uniform rotation in 2023.[147] The Falcons have shared a heated divisional rivalry with the New Orleans Saints (first the NFC West, and now the NFC South). The two teams were often basement-dwellers in the division; but the rivalry grew as a means of pride between the two cities, as they were the only two NFL teams in the Deep South for multiple decades. The series is the oldest and most iconic rivalry in the NFC South as the two teams have long harbored bad blood against one another.[148] The series is currently tied at 55–55, including the most recent loss to the Saints on January 7, 2024, when the Falcons lost 48–17.[149] In addition, the Falcons share a similar, rivalry with the Carolina Panthers, with both teams having been in the NFC West from the Panthers' founding in 1995 to the NFL realignment in 2002. Similar to their rivalry with the Saints, the Falcons have often endured several competitive divisional battles with the Panthers for lead of the NFC South, though the two have yet to meet in the postseason. The series is also known as the \"I-85 Rivalry\"[150] due to Atlanta and Charlotte being only four hours apart on Interstate 85.[151][152] The Falcons lead the series 36–22.[153] The Falcons share a less-intense divisional rivalry with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers since the NFL realignment in 2002. The two had been regional opponents but very little had linked any further animosity towards the two as the Buccaneers played in the former NFC Central before the realignment.[154][155][156] The two teams would find themselves competing over staff and players alike, particularly during the 2000s after the Falcons had lured general manager Rich McKay after winning Super Bowl XXXVII the season prior.[157] McKay's ties with Tampa extend into his family as his father John McKay was head coach of the Buccaneers for nine seasons.[158][159][160][161] The Eagles lead the Falcons 21–15–1, with a 3–1 lead in playoff games.[162] The rivalry first emerged after the Falcons upset the Eagles 14–13 in the 1978 Wild Card Round,[163] and only intensified further in the 2000s thanks to the rivalry between prominent dual-threat quarterbacks Donovan McNabb, and Michael Vick. Recently, the Falcons lost to the Eagles in the 2017 divisional round.[164][165][166] The Falcons have also shared a playoff rivalry with the Green Bay Packers as much of the connections between the two teams stems from Atlanta trading future hall-of-fame quarterback Brett Favre to the Green Bay on February 11, 1992, in exchange for a first-round pick.[167][168] The two teams have met four times in the postseason, most recently during the 2016–17 NFC Championship as it would also be the final game played at the Georgia Dome.[169][170][171] The Packers lead the all-time series 19–16, while both teams are tied in the postseason 2–2.[172] Includes postseason records[173] Source:[174] Note: W = Wins, L = Losses, T = Ties Running backs (RB) Wide receivers (WR) Tight ends (TE) Defensive linemen (DL) Defensive backs (DB) Special teams Reserve 53 active, 12 reserve, 15 practice squad (+1 exempt) Humphrey is the only person in the Hall of Fame who spent the majority of his career with the Falcons. Fourteen members are included in the Atlanta Falcons Ring of Honor.[200][201][202][203] In the team's history, the Falcons have had the number one overall pick four times.[205] In their history, the Atlanta Falcons have had 18 head coaches. Five coaches have served in interim roles[206][207] → Coaching staff → Front office → More NFL staffs The Falcons' flagship radio station is WZGC 92.9 The Game.[208] Wes Durham, son of longtime North Carolina Tar Heels voice Woody Durham, is the Falcons' play-by-play announcer, with former Atlanta Falcons quarterback and pro football veteran, Dave Archer serving as color commentator.[209][210] In 2014, The CW affiliate WUPA became the official television station of the Falcons, gaining rights to its preseason games, which are produced by CBS Sports.[211] In the regular season, the team's games are seen on Fox's O&O affiliate WAGA. When the Falcons challenge an AFC team, CBS affiliate WANF will air those games while Sunday night games are televised on WXIA, the local NBC affiliate. Source:[212]",

                "content": "Joseph Jay Milton III[1] (born March 6, 2000) is an American professional football quarterback for the New England Patriots of the National Football League (NFL). He played college football for the Michigan Wolverines and Tennessee Volunteers. Milton was selected by the Patriots in the sixth round of the 2024 NFL draft. Milton attended Olympia High School in Orlando, Florida.[2] He committed to the University of Michigan to play college football.[3][4] Milton spent his first two years at Michigan (2018, 2019) as a backup to starter Shea Patterson.[5] During those two years, he played in eight games, completing 6 of 11 passes for 117 yards, one touchdown, two interceptions and also had two rushing touchdowns.[6] Milton competed with Dylan McCaffrey to be Michigan's starter in 2020.[7][8] Milton was considered the favorite after McCaffrey decided to transfer.[9] Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, Michigan's season was shortened to only six games.[10] Milton started the first three games but steadily lost more playing time to Cade McNamara as the season progressed.[11] Milton passed for 1,077 yards, four passing touchdowns, and four interceptions to go along with 38 carries for 109 rushing yards and one rushing touchdown in Michigan's 2–4 season.[12] Milton transferred to Tennessee, where he was named the team's starter going into the 2021 season.[13] During the Volunteers' second game of the season against Pittsburgh, Milton suffered an injury, and Hendon Hooker, a fellow transfer quarterback from Virginia Tech, replaced him in the lineup.[14] He recorded a passing touchdown against #1 Georgia in relief in the 41–17 loss on November 13.[15] Milton played in a relief role in six games for the rest of the 2021 season.[16] In the 2022 season, Hooker was the primary starter for the 11–2 Volunteers.[17] Milton played the backup role for most of the season. He had productive outings in relief of Hooker with multiple games going over 100 yards passing and scoring at least one passing touchdown.[18] On November 19, against South Carolina, Hooker sustained a season-ending ACL injury, making Milton the starter for the rest of the season.[19][20] Milton made his first start of the season against Vanderbilt. He passed for 147 yards and a touchdown in the 56–0 victory.[21] Tennessee qualified for the Orange Bowl against #7 Clemson.[22] In the game, Milton passed for 251 yards and three touchdowns in the 31–14 victory to earn MVP honors.[23] Milton began the 2023 season as the Volunteers' starting quarterback. He threw for two passing touchdowns and ran for two rushing touchdowns in a 49–13 victory over Virginia.[24] Following three total touchdowns in a 30–13 win over Austin Peay, Milton and the Vols had their first setback against Florida on September 16.[25][26] To start Tennessee's 45–14 victory over UTSA in the following game, Milton had an 81-yard rushing touchdown on the Vols' first offensive drive. The play marked the longest rushing play by a quarterback in program history.[27] Following conference victories over South Carolina and Texas A&M, Milton had 271 yards and two passing touchdowns in a loss to Alabama.[28][29][30] After a 2–2 stretch, Milton passed for 383 yards and four touchdowns to go along with two rushing touchdowns in a 48–24 victory over Vanderbilt to end the regular season. The performance marked the most touchdowns accounted for by a Volunteer in a single game since 2009.[31] Milton finished his final season with the Volunteers with an 8–4 record after deciding to opt out of the Volunteers' bowl game.[32][33] Milton was selected by the New England Patriots in the sixth round (193rd overall) of the 2024 NFL draft.[37] The Patriots obtained the pick by trading quarterback Mac Jones to the Jacksonville Jaguars. Milton signed his rookie contract with the Patriots on May 10, 2024.[38] Milton was named the third-string quarterback behind Jacoby Brissett and fellow rookie Drake Maye to start the 2024 season. On January 5, 2025, Milton made his professional debut in the season finale against the Buffalo Bills after relieving Maye, who departed after the opening drive. Milton finished 22-of-29 for 241 yards and accounted for two touchdowns as the Patriots won 23–16, knocking them out of contention for the first overall pick in the 2025 NFL draft.[39]",

                "content": "Former Tennessee football QB Joe Milton made his NFL debut for the New England Patriots on Sunday and quickly made a good impression. Though usual starting quarterback Drake Maye played the first possession in Sunday's game against the Buffalo Bills (a 3-and-out), he made way for Milton for his NFL debut in the regular season. Milton led a good opening drive and capped it off with a 1-yard rushing touchdown on the read option keeper, celebrating with a backflip in the end zone. It's an interesting spot for Milton and the Patriots in Sunday's game. Buffalo is resting most of its best players with the playoffs opening next week and the Bills locked into the No. 2 seed in the AFC. New England earns the No. 1 overall pick with a loss on Sunday and could fall out of the top three picks with a win. Patriots coach Jerod Mayo, the former Vols linebacker, is reportedly on the hot seat at the end of his first year as Bill Belichick's replacement. Milton's performance on Sunday could also help him stay in the league. The sixth-round pick last April has been the Patriots' No. 3 quarterback for most of the season and can stake a claim to the No. 2 job with a quality game on Sunday.",

                "title": "Texan English - Wikipedia",
                "content": "Texan English is the array of American English dialects spoken in Texas, primarily falling under Southern U.S. English. As one nationwide study states, the typical Texan accent is a \"Southern accent with a twist\".[1] The \"twist\" refers to inland Southern U.S., older coastal Southern U.S., and South Midland U.S. accents mixing together, due to Texas's settlement history, as well as some lexical (vocabulary) influences from Mexican Spanish.[1] In fact, there is no single accent that covers all of Texas and few dialect features are unique to Texas alone. The newest and most innovative Southern U.S. accent features are best reported in Lubbock, Odessa, somewhat Houston and variably Dallas, though general features of this same dialect are found throughout the state, with several exceptions:[2] Abilene and somewhat Austin, Corpus Christi, and El Paso appear to align more with Midland U.S. accents than Southern ones. After Mexico gained independence in 1821, Mexican Texas legally permitted an influx of American settlers mainly from the Southern United States,[3] who within a decade outnumbered Hispanics in Texas,[4] making English as common as Spanish in central and north Texas. After Texas became an independent republic in 1836, English, with its distinct Southern influences, became the predominant language. After the Mexican Revolution of 1910–1920, a great number of Spanish-speaking Mexicans immigrated to Texas,[5][6] slowing down in the mid-20th century only to increase massively since 1990,[4] driving the development of a young Spanish-influenced dialect of Texan English: Tejano English. Some linguists draw dialect boundaries based upon phonological (sound-pattern) differences and others on lexical (word-usage) differences, leading to various views on how to classify dialects in Texas, often by dividing the state into an eastern versus a western dialect region.[7] 20th-century lexical research delimited Texas into two \"layers\": a southern Texas layer along the Mexican border with several Spanish loanwords and a central Texas layer settled by speakers of German and other European languages amidst a dominant Anglo-American settlement.[8][9] 21st-century phonological research reveals accents in Texas grouped in a way not easy to demarcate in terms of simple geographical boundaries,[10] and ongoing research reveals an urban–rural divide within Texas becoming more significant than a region-wide divide. Some linguists propose that urbanization, geographic and social mobility, and the mass media have homogenized the speech of the United States to a national norm.[11] Due to rapid urbanization, increasing dominance of high tech industries, and massive migrations, Texan speech has been reshaped as well, especially since 1990.[4] The general tendency in the phonology of Texas English is that mergers expand at the expense of distinctions, although traditional Southern-style Texan English preserved older phonemic distinctions.[11] Since much of the traditional regional vocabulary concerned farming and rural life, these terms are now disappearing or being replaced by technical terms.[11] As stated above, an internal rural–urban split is emerging within Texan English, meaning that most traditionally Southern (or stereotypically Texan) features remain strong in rural areas but tend to disappear in large urban areas and small cities.[4] The urban-rural linguistic split mainly affects Southern-style phonological phenomena like the pen-pin merger, the loss of the offglide in /aɪ/, and upgliding diphthongs, all of which are now recessive in metropolitan areas.[4] Meanwhile, some traditional grammatical features like y'all and fixin' to are expanding to non-natives in metropolitan areas as well as to the Hispanic population.[4] Essentially all Texas English phonologically falls under the Southeastern super-dialect region of the United States and often specifically the Southern dialect region, though noticeably not the cities of El Paso, Abilene, and Austin, and not particularly Houston and Corpus Christi.[2] Moreover, as of 21st-century research, the accents of Dallas show enormous variability.[10] Texas English may use many grammatical constructions typically associated with Southern U.S. English, including fixin' to,[19] multiple modals like might could and should oughta (reportedly used by every social class and, as of the 1980s Linguistic Atlas of the Gulf States, predominately in Upper and Lower East Texas), and plural verbal -s as in Our father and mother helps used by both Black and (somewhat less commonly) white Texans.[20] Many of these lexical terms are shared with the Midland and Southern dialects generally: Due to Spain's past influence in Texas, the vocabulary of Texas is much more influenced by Spanish than the vocabulary of other states. Some of the Texan terms that originated from Spanish are listed below.[22] Texan English frequently shows up in the media. In the 1950s and 1960s, many Hollywood western movies like Giant, Hud, and The Alamo were set in Texas. In those movies, Hollywood stars like James Dean, Rock Hudson, Dennis Hopper, Paul Newman, and Patricia Neal first had to learn how to speak Texan English and were instructed by native Texans. Also the famous TV series Dallas was often characterized by Texan English. Texas Instruments sometimes uses Texan English in its products. The TIFORM software for its TI-990 minicomputer sometimes displayed \"Shut 'er Down Clancey She's a-Pumping Mud\" as a humorous error message.[28] The Texan accent gained nationwide fame with the presidency of native Texan Lyndon B. Johnson. A lifelong resident of the Texas Hill Country, Johnson's thick accent was a large part of his personality and brought attention and fame to the dialect.[4][29] The Texan dialect gained fame again when George W. Bush started to serve as president. He had moved to West Texas at the age of two and has since retained the Texan dialect. In his speech, words like \"America\" sometimes sound like \"Amur-kah\" or even just like \"Mur-kah\".[4][30] Former U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson also speaks with a distinctively Texan accent.[31][32] Due to hundreds of years of Spanish and later Mexican intermingling, around 6 million (ca. 29%) people in Texas speak Spanish as the first language.[33] Recent data shows that Spanish is still increasing.[34] Since there are so many Spanish speakers in Texas, Spanish has a high impact on the English dialect spoken in Texas.[35] Many Mexican Americans in Texas speak their own variety of English which has many Spanish features (terms, phonology, etc.), Tejano English, a Chicano English dialect mostly spoken by working-class Mexican Americans. A very distinctive feature of that dialect is the /-t,d/-deletion in words which contain a /t/ or /d/ in the final position.[36]",

                "content": "The Houston Texans are a professional American football team based in Houston. The Texans compete in the National Football League as a member of the American Football Conference (AFC) South division. The team plays its home games at NRG Stadium. The Texans were founded in 1999, and were owned by Bob McNair until his death in 2018; following McNair's death, the majority ownership of the team went to his wife, Janice. The McNairs' son, Cal, became operating head of the franchise upon his father's death, and became principal owner when his mother transferred ownership to him in 2024.[7] The team replaced the city's previous NFL franchise, the Houston Oilers, who played from 1960 to 1996 before moving to Nashville and eventually becoming the Tennessee Titans. The Texans began play as an expansion team in 2002, making them the youngest franchise currently competing in the NFL.[8] While the Texans mainly struggled in the 2000s, their fortunes would take a turn for the better in the 2010s when they won their first division championship in 2011, clinching their first playoff berth.[9][10] The Texans have gone on to win seven more AFC South division championships in 2012, 2015, 2016, 2018, 2019, 2023, and 2024. They are the only franchise to have never won a road playoff game along with the only one to have never appeared in a conference championship game; they are also one of four franchises to have never appeared in a Super Bowl,[11] alongside the Cleveland Browns, Detroit Lions, and division rival Jacksonville Jaguars. According to an article by Forbes, the Houston Texans are the eleventh richest team in the NFL with a value of $4.7 billion in August 2022.[12] After the Texas Rangers won the 2023 World Series, the Houston Texans became the only big four professional sports franchise currently based in Texas without a championship. In 1997, Houston entrepreneur Bob McNair had a failed bid to bring a National Hockey League (NHL) expansion team to the city, and Bud Adams relocated the city's NFL team, the Houston Oilers, to Nashville, Tennessee, where they were renamed the Tennessee Titans in 1999. In 1996, the Cleveland Browns had controversially relocated to become the Baltimore Ravens. As part of the settlement between the NFL, the city of Cleveland, and the team owned by Art Modell, the league promised to return football to Cleveland within the next three years. In order to even out the franchises to 32, the NFL contemplated adding another expansion franchise. As Houston was one of the favorites for the extra franchise, along with Toronto and Los Angeles (the latter of whom had lost the Rams and the Raiders in 1995), McNair then decided to join the football project and founded Houston NFL Holdings with partner Steve Patterson. With Houston Livestock Show and Rodeo, they would push for a domed stadium as part of the bid to lure the NFL back to Houston. On October 6, 1999, the NFL awarded the 32nd team to Houston at a cost of $700 million.[1] The Houston Texans joined the NFL in the 2002 season, playing at the newly opened Reliant Stadium under head coach Dom Capers.[13] With their opening game victory over the Dallas Cowboys on September 8, 2002, the Texans became the first expansion team to win its opening game since the Minnesota Vikings beat the Chicago Bears in 1961.[14] The Texans went 4–12 and finished last in the AFC South in their debut season.[15] The team improved to a 5–11 mark in the 2003 season.[16] The team continued to make progress with a 7–9 record in the 2004 season.[17] In the 2005 season, the Texans fell to a 2–14 record for the worst mark in the league.[18] Following the end of the season, the team fired Capers as head coach.[19] They earned the top pick in the 2006 NFL Draft.[20] While the team struggled in its early seasons, results began to improve when native Houstonian Gary Kubiak became the head coach in 2006.[21] The Texans finished with a .500 season (8–8) in 2007 and 2008, and nearly qualified for the 2009–10 playoffs with a 9–7 result in 2009. The Texans started the 2010 season on a 4–2 record going into a Week 7 bye week, but promptly collapsed 2–8 in the second half of the season, finishing 6–10. In the 2011 NFL draft, the Texans acquired Wisconsin star defensive end J. J. Watt 11th overall. The following season, former Cowboys head coach Wade Phillips was hired as the defensive coordinator for the Texans, and the improved defense led to them finishing 10–6, winning their first AFC South title.[22] The Texans then beat wild card Cincinnati Bengals 31–10 in the first round of the 2011–12 playoffs,[23] before a 20–13 defeat by the Ravens in the Divisional Round.[24] The Texans surged as the team to beat in the AFC South in 2012, starting 5–0 and holding an 11–1 record by week 14. However, they lost three of their last four games to finish 12–4; beating the rival Indianapolis Colts in that four-game stretch allowing them to clinch their 2nd AFC South title. The Texans beat the Bengals again in the wild-card round,[25] but they lost in the Divisional Round to the New England Patriots.[26] In the 2013 NFL draft, the Texans acquired Clemson wide receiver DeAndre Hopkins 27th overall.[27] In 2013, the Texans started 2–0 but went into a tailspin and lost every game afterwards.[28] Kubiak was fired as head coach after being swept by the rival Jacksonville Jaguars, who themselves started 0–8.[29] Wade Phillips filled in as head coach, but the Texans' poor form did not change, and they finished 2–14, tying, with 2005, their worst record in franchise history.[30] The 14-game losing streak is the worst in franchise history. The Texans entered the 2014 season with a 14-game losing streak. Former Penn State head coach Bill O'Brien became the Texans' new head coach, and the third in franchise history, during the offseason.[31][32] In 2014, the Texans won three of their first four games, defeating the Redskins in the season opener while ending the losing streak, the Raiders, and the Bills, losing to the New York Giants. They lost three of their next four games, losing to the Dallas Cowboys, the Indianapolis Colts, and the Pittsburgh Steelers, respectively. The Texans went on to finish 9–7 in the 2014 season and barely missed the playoffs.[33] In the 2015 season, they were featured on HBO, on the show \"Hard Knocks\".[34] That year, the Texans started with a 2–5 record. Quarterback Ryan Mallett was released amidst controversy regarding his benching in favor of Brian Hoyer during a loss against the Indianapolis Colts.[35] After a poor start, the Texans finished with a 9–7 record and won their third AFC South title.[36] However, they were shut out by the Kansas City Chiefs in the Wild Card round 30–0, ending their championship hopes for the year.[37] On March 9, 2016, the Texans signed former Denver Broncos quarterback Brock Osweiler to a 4-year, $72 million deal.[38] Despite Osweiler's lucrative deal, he struggled significantly during the 2016 season. After throwing two interceptions in Week 15 against the Jaguars, coach Bill O'Brien benched the offseason acquisition in favor of backup quarterback Tom Savage. Savage led a comeback effort against the Jaguars, and was named the starter for the remainder of the season. The Texans clinched their fourth AFC South division title in six years in Savage's first career start against the Bengals in Week 16. They defeated the wildcard Oakland Raiders 27–14 in the opening round of the playoffs with Osweiler as the starting quarterback due to Savage being out with a concussion.[39] Osweiler started in the Divisional Playoffs game against the New England Patriots, throwing three interceptions in the second half. The Texans lost 34–16.[40] In the 2017 NFL draft, the Texans traded up to the 12th overall selection to select Clemson star quarterback Deshaun Watson.[41] Watson started six games his rookie year, going 3–3 and having arguably the greatest and most decorated rookie season by a quarterback in NFL history, eventually rising up to become the Texans' franchise quarterback. However, his success would come up very short, following a Week 8 41–38 loss to the Seattle Seahawks, Watson tore his ACL in practice and was ruled out the remainder of the season, which caused the Texans to have one of their worst seasons.[42] Plagued by a series of unexpected injuries (including a second consecutive season-ending injury to J. J. Watt) and controversy involving the team's suspected violation of the league's concussion protocol, after backup quarterback Tom Savage suffered a seizure following a Week 14 game against the San Francisco 49ers, the Texans went 1–9 the rest of the season and eventually finish 4–12 and last in the AFC South in 2017, missing the playoffs for the first time since 2014 and giving Bill O'Brien his first losing season as Texans head coach.[43] In 2018, the Texans started the season 0–3, losing by a combined 15 points to the New England Patriots, Tennessee Titans, and New York Giants, before winning a 37–34 overtime shootout on the road in Indianapolis. This win sparked a nine-game winning streak for the Texans, their first since starting 5–0 in 2012, which included a Week 8 win against the Miami Dolphins that included five touchdown passes from Deshaun Watson.[44] This streak was the longest ever for a team that started the season 0–3; the previous record was a seven-game win-streak set by the New York Giants in 1918 after starting out 0–3.[45] On November 23, 2018, the owner of the Houston Texans, Bob McNair, died from skin cancer.[46] On November 26, 2018, McNair's wife, Janice McNair, became the principal owner and Senior Chair of the Houston Texans, while their son, D. Cal McNair, became the chairman and Chief Operating Officer.[47] The Texans finished the season 11–5, and won another AFC South division championship under Bill O'Brien.[48] They lost 21–7 in the first round of the playoffs to their AFC South division rival Indianapolis Colts.[49] In 2019, the Texans won the AFC South division championship and qualified for the NFL playoffs on the back of a 10–6 record.[50] They went on to defeat the Buffalo Bills by a score of 22–19 in overtime in the AFC wild-card round.[51] However, the Texans' 2019 season came to an end the following week, as they lost to the eventual Super Bowl champion Kansas City Chiefs by a score of 51–31 in the AFC divisional round.[52] The Texans had a 24–0 lead in the game before the Chiefs came back.[53] On March 22, 2020, the Texans traded away all-pro wide receiver DeAndre Hopkins and a fourth-round pick in the 2020 NFL draft to the Arizona Cardinals. In return, Houston received running back David Johnson, a 2020 second-round pick, and a 2021 fourth-round pick.[54] The move was confusing and controversial among fans and sportswriters alike, as many claimed that the Texans should have received more valuable assets for Hopkins, who was among the best receivers in the NFL.[55] The Texans began the 2020 NFL season with a record of 0–4, and Bill O'Brien was consequentially fired following a disappointing loss to the Minnesota Vikings in Week 4. Romeo Crennel, who was the head coach of the Cleveland Browns from 2005 to 2008 and of the Kansas City Chiefs in 2011–12,[56] was named the interim head coach for the remainder of the season.[57] Crennel managed to win more than half of his first 7 games as Houston's head coach, giving Houston a record of 4–7. However, the Texans ended the season on a five-game losing streak.[58] With a final record of 4–12, the Texans were unable to make the playoffs.[59] On January 27, 2021, the Texans hired David Culley as the team's head coach.[60] Culley most recently worked as the Baltimore Ravens assistant head coach, wide receivers coach and passing game coordinator. On February 12, 2021, the Texans released all-pro defensive end J.J. Watt. It was confirmed that Watt personally requested owner Cal McNair for his release.[61] On January 13, 2022, the Texans fired David Culley after posting a 4–13 record[62] as the team's head coach and promoted defensive coordinator Lovie Smith as the team's fifth head coach on February 7, 2022.[63] The team traded away their starting quarterback Deshaun Watson to the Cleveland Browns and a 2024 fifth round pick for three 1st round picks, a 3rd round pick and a 4th round pick on March 20, 2022, due to sexual misconduct lawsuits toward Watson.[64] The Texans opened their 2022 season in a tie game against the Indianapolis Colts, the franchise's first tie in their 20-year existence.[65][66] On January 9, 2023, the Texans announced that they were going in a different direction by firing Lovie Smith after a 3–13–1 season.[67] On January 31, 2023, the Texans hired former player and 49ers defensive coordinator DeMeco Ryans as their new head coach, making him the sixth head coach in franchise history.[68] In the 2023 NFL draft the Texans selected Ohio State quarterback C. J. Stroud and traded up to the third pick to select Defensive End Will Anderson Jr..[69] Under Ryans and Stroud, the team saw improved fortunes as they made the playoffs while winning the AFC South for the first time since the 2019 season with a 10–7 record, becoming the first NFL team to win their division under a rookie head coach and quarterback.[70] The team defeated the Cleveland Browns 45–14 in the Wild Card Round.[71] The Texans saw their season end in the Divisional Round with a 34–10 loss to the Baltimore Ravens.[72] Stroud would later be named NFL offensive Rookie of the Year, and Anderson Jr. would be named NFL defensive Rookie of the Year Award.[73][74] Ryans also finished in a tie in total votes for NFL Coach of the Year with Browns head coach Kevin Stefanski though he lost the award in a tiebreaker due to having one less first place vote.[75] The Texans are the youngest expansion team in the NFL, having only been competing in the NFL for 23 seasons since 2002 and have had limited regular season and postseason success. For that reason, they have not had the history or the reputation on which to build classic rivalries like the ones that often exist between older franchises. Despite this, the team has developed some rivalries. Its natural rivals are its fellow AFC South teams, which are the Tennessee Titans, Jacksonville Jaguars, and Indianapolis Colts.[76][77][78] The Tennessee Titans, who were formerly the Houston Oilers before their relocation in 1996, are viewed by many Houston fans as the Texans' chief rival as members of the AFC South ever since the early 2000s.[79][80] As of the 2023 season, the Titans lead the all-time series 23–21.[81] Ever since the early 2000s, the Texans also have an AFC South Division rivalry with the Indianapolis Colts, whom the Texans had not defeated until the 2006 season.[82] The first time that the Texans would sweep the Colts was in the 2016 NFL season.[83] More recently, Houston has increased bitterness with the Indianapolis Colts due to their young Houston-native quarterback Andrew Luck having been drafted by the Colts in 2012 and the franchise's first ever sweep of the Colts against Luck in 2016. In 2018 the two teams met in the AFC Wild Card Playoffs, with the Colts winning 21–7.[84][85][86][87] Having begun play in 1995 and 2002, respectively, the Jaguars and Texans are among two of the most-recently established franchises in the NFL. The Jaguars relocated from the AFC Central to the newly created AFC South where the Texans were placed into and have competed as division rivals since. The Jaguars are the only division rival the Texans have a winning record against as the Texans lead the series 29–15.[88] The Texans also have an intrastate/interconference rivalry with the Dallas Cowboys, with whom they contest the so-called Governor's Cup every year (a tradition started between the cities prior to the Oilers relocating) either in the preseason or the regular season for bragging rights in the state of Texas. In 2017, the destruction and flooding caused during Hurricane Harvey a few days before their Week 4 pre-season match up time scheduled caused the game to be relocated to AT&T Stadium in Arlington, Texas. However, out of concern for the safety of the fans and the condition of the player's families & communities, the game was canceled.[89] As of the 2024 season, the Cowboys lead the all-time series 4–3.[90] The Texans are the newest team in the league, but they have been embraced by a fair amount of celebrities since joining the NFL in 2002. The team has also adopted a number of former Houston Oilers fans in search of a new home team. Despite the lacking playoff success, there have been a present amount of loyal fans and even various celebrities such as Ryan Trahan, George Foreman, Paul Wall, Rico Rodriguez, and Raini Rodriguez who have been strong supporters of the team.[91][92][93] During the 2010s, the team adopted the moniker \"Bulls on Parade\" in honor of the Rage Against the Machine song, regularly used prior to the team's introduction before entering the field.[94] In the process of naming the new franchise leadership conducted an extensive review and research process; the final list of names was determined after several months of research conducted jointly by Houston NFL 2002 and NFL Properties. This included an online survey asking fans and the community to weigh in which received more than 65,000 responses in one week. On March 2, 2000, it was announced that the team name search had been narrowed down to five choices: Apollos, Bobcats, Stallions, Texans, and Wildcatters.[95] On September 6, 2000, the NFL's 32nd franchise was officially christened the Houston Texans before thousands at a downtown rally in Houston. McNair explained that the name and logo were chosen to \"embody the pride, strength, independence and achievement that make the people of Houston and our area special.\"[96][97] The name \"Texans\" had been used by several now-defunct football teams, including the Canadian Football League franchise in San Antonio; the World Football League franchise in Houston, which moved to Louisiana to become the Shreveport Steamer; the Dallas Texans of the NFL which played in only the 1952 season; and by the precursor of the present-day Kansas City Chiefs, when they were the second incarnation of the Dallas Texans in the American Football League (AFL). Owner Bob McNair received permission from Chiefs' owner Lamar Hunt to use the Texans name for his new team.[22] It is also a subtle homage to the naming style of the NHL team the Montreal Canadiens who also named their team after their respective demonym.[22] Along with the team name, McNair unveiled the team logo, an abstract depiction of a bull's head, split in such a way to resemble the flag of Texas and the state of Texas, including a lone star to stand for the eye, the five points of which representing pride, courage, strength, tradition and independence. McNair described the colors as \"Deep Steel Blue\", \"Battle Red\" and \"Liberty White\".[96] A year later the Texans unveiled their uniforms during another downtown rally.[98] The Texans' helmet is dark blue with the Texans bull logo. The helmet was initially white when the team name and logo were unveiled, but was later changed to dark blue. The uniform design consists of red trim and either dark blue or white jerseys. The team typically wears white pants with its blue jerseys and blue pants with its white jerseys. Starting with the 2006 season, the Texans wore all-white for their home opener, and the team began to wear an all-blue combination for home games vs. the Indianapolis Colts. In 2003, the Texans introduced an alternative red jersey with blue trim; they wear this jersey at one home game each year, usually against a division rival. In 2007, the Texans introduced red pants for the first time, pairing them with the red jerseys for an all-red look. They would wear this look until 2010, but was brought back in 2023. In October 2008 the Texans paired blue socks (instead of the traditional red) with their blue pants and white jerseys, eventually becoming the team's primary road uniform combination. In 2016, the Texans unveiled a new uniform combo against the Jacksonville Jaguars, pairing the red jersey with blue pants and red socks. In 2017, the Texans unveiled a Color Rush uniform, using an all-blue uniform but with minimal white elements. In 2021, the Texans began sporting all-white socks on select home and road games. In 2022, the Texans began using a red alternate helmet with the red uniform. In 2023, the red alternate helmet was worn with the Color Rush uniform in a 21–16 victory against the Arizona Cardinals.[99] In 2002, the team wore a patch commemorating their inaugural season. Also, they celebrated 10 years as a franchise by wearing an anniversary patch throughout 2012. From 2018 to 2019, the Texans wore a memorial patch to honor Bob McNair after his death.[100] In April 2024, the Texans unveiled redesigned uniforms. The primary dark blue helmets remained, but the home blue uniforms were updated to include the Texans primary crest on the sleeve and new collar stripes, while the road white uniform featured blue and red horn stripes on the sleeves, along with blue numbers with red trim. The white uniform's design also served as the basis for the red alternate uniform, which is paired with a red helmet containing the blue horn stripes. A second alternate uniform is a navy blue base with \"H-Town blue\" accents; numbers are red with \"H-Town blue\" trim. This set is paired with a navy blue alternate helmet containing the \"H-Star\" decal in \"H-Town blue\" with red trim. The inclusion of a second alternate helmet is due to the NFL allowing teams with new uniforms to unveil these helmets in advance this season.[101] Running backs (RB) Wide receivers (WR) Tight ends (TE) Defensive linemen (DL) Defensive backs (DB) Special teams Reserve 53 active, 15 reserve, 15 practice squad (+1 exempt) The Texans have had the top-overall pick in the NFL Draft three times.[102] On November 19, 2017, Andre Johnson was the first-ever inductee into the Texans Ring of Honor.[103] On October 6, 2019, Bob McNair was posthumously the second inductee into the Texans Ring of Honor.[104] On October 1, 2023, J. J. Watt was the third inductee into the Texans Ring of Honor.[105] Only two members of the Pro Football Hall of Fame have spent any portion of their career with Texans, due in part to the requirements to be inducted and the Texans only having been established in 2002. In 2024, Andre Johnson became the first player to be inducted into the Hall of Fame primarily for his time with the Texans.[106] → Coaching staff → Front office → More NFL staffs The Texans have had six full-time head coaches in their franchise history. The team has had two interim head coaches.[108] The team's official mascot is Toro, an anthropomorphic blue bull.[111] The team also has a cheerleading squad simply named the Houston Texans Cheerleaders.[112] Community outreach by the Houston Texans is primarily operated by the Houston Texans Foundation, who works with multiple community partners.[113] The Houston Texans organization is also a supporter of the character education program, Heart of a Champion.[114] In 2017, the 15th annual Houston Texans Charity Golf Classic raised more than $380,000 for the Foundation. More than $27.2 million has been raised for the Foundation since its creation in 2002.[115] Former Texans DE J. J. Watt raised $41.6 million in relief funds for Hurricane Harvey after the storm devastated the city in 2017.[116] Watt ended up winning the Walter Payton Man of the Year Award that season.[117] As of 2023[update], the Texans' flagship radio stations were KILT SportsRadio 610AM and KILT 100.3FM.[118] The AM station has an all-sports format, while the FM station plays contemporary country music. Both are owned by Audacy. Marc Vandermeer is the play-by-play announcer.[119] Heisman Trophy winner Andre Ware provides color commentary, and SportsRadio 610 host Rich Lord serves as the sideline reporter.[120][121] Preseason and regular season Monday night games from ESPN are telecast by KTRK, an ABC owned and operated station. Kevin Kugler calls the preseason games on TV, with former Texans defensive end N. D. Kalu providing color commentary.[122] Regular season games are aired over CBS affiliate KHOU, Fox affiliate KRIV if the Texans host an NFC team, and NBC affiliate KPRC for Sunday night games. Spanish-language radio broadcasts of the team's games are aired on KGOL ESPN Deportes 1180AM.[123] Enrique Vásquez is the play-by-play announcer. José Jojo Padrón provides color commentary,[124] and Fernando Hernández serves as sideline reporter.

However, pride was at stake for both teams and neither were seemingly keen on capping off the season with a defeat. Here's how the game panned out: Looking to predict NFL playoff Scenarios?

With one week left in the regular season, here's an updated look at who would be in, who would be out, and where all the postseason teams would be seeded in Week 18: POWER RANKINGS: Packers, Steelers, Falcons fall; Commanders, Bengals, Bucs climb for Week 18 The bracket reflects current NFL playoff standings if the regular season ended before Week 18 (clinched) 1. Kansas City Chiefs 15-1 (champions, AFC West): The Chiefs have locked up home-field advantage and the lone bye in the AFC playoffs ahead of their Week 18 game at Denver. (clinched) 2. Buffalo Bills 13-4 (champions, AFC East): The Bills are locked into this seed and rested starters in Week 18 after getting Josh Allen into the game against the Patriots, an eventual meaningless loss. (clinched) 3. Baltimore Ravens 12-5 (champions, AFC North): The Ravens got off to a slow start, but put the game away in the fourth quarter. Quarterback Lamar Jackson and Derrick Henry had to play way more than expected in Week 18, but won't complain with a divisional crown. (clinched) 4. Houston Texans 10-7 (champions, AFC South). The Texans were careful with their starters against the Titans as they also were locked into their position with a home wild-card playoff game upcoming, but they won regardless to end the season. (clinched) 5. Los Angeles Chargers 11-6 (second place, AFC West): The Chargers, who finished with a win over the Raiders moved up to the No. 5 spot with the Ravens winning the AFC North and the Steelers losing to the Bengals (clinched) 6.

Philadelphia Eagles 14-3 (champions, NFC East): The Eagles will be resting key players including Saquon Barkley as they are locked into this seed regardless of the Vikings-Lions outcome. (clinched) 3. Tampa Bay Buccaneers 10-7 (champions, NFC South): The Buccaneers won the the division by beating the Saints in Week 18 and moved up when the resting Rams lost to the Seahawks. (clinched) 4. Los Angeles Rams 10-7 (champions, NFC West): The Rams rested their starters because they were guaranteed the division tiebreaker over the winning Seahawks and were OK losing the conference tiebreaker to the Buccaneers. 5. Minnesota Vikings 14-2 (second place, NFC North): The Vikings would win the division with a win over the Lions on Sunday night. If they lose, they would stay here and face either the Rams or Buccaneers on the road in the wild-card round. (clinched) 6. Washington Commanders 12-5 (second place, NFC East): The Commanders clinched the second wild-card position for the NFC playoffs by defeating the Cowboys. (clinched) 7.

                "content": "If not listed, please contact your TV provider. The NFL has reached its final destination in the 2024 regular season: Week 18. For some, this will mark the end of the road as they'll play out the string and fade off into the offseason. Others will embark on a run toward the playoffs and kickstart a run they all hope will land them in New Orleans for Super Bowl LIX. With the early window in the rearview mirror, the overall playoff picture is starting to crystalize. After the Buccaneers were able to defeat the Saints, Tampa Bay has claimed the NFC South title, ousting the Atlanta Falcons from playoff contention. While that was the lone division locked up in the early slate, we also saw some seeding get determined after the Chicago Bears hit a game-winning field goal as time expired. That solidified the Washington Commanders as the No. 6 seed and the Green Bay Packers as the No. 7 seed in the NFC. And this is just the start of the action. Still to come, is the massive NFC Showdown between the Detroit Lions and Minnesota Vikings. The winner of that game will clinch the NFC North title and earn the No. 1 seed in the conference, while the loser will be the No. 5 seed. Meanwhile, the AFC has one final wild-card spot is still up for grabs, and it'll either be the Cincinnati Bengals, Miami Dolphins, or Denver Broncos who claim it. The Broncos have the easiest path towards getting that final playoff position as they merely need to defeat the Kansas City Chiefs -- who are resting starters -- and they'll get in. If they lose, however, that opens the door for the Dolphins, who'd get in with a win over the New York Jets in that scenario. If both the Broncos and Dolphins fall, the Bengals would sneak in after defeating the Steelers on Saturday night. It's going to be a wild dash to the finish line. To make sure you don't miss a thing, check out our playoff live blog, which we'll be updating below throughout the day. Los Angeles is inching closer to locking up the No. 5 seed in the AFC after taking a 34-13 lead over the Raiders. With a win, they'll be the top wild-card entry and face the Houston Texans during Super Wild Card Weekend. With the 38-0 win over the Chiefs, the Denver Broncos have clinched a playoff spot and are the No. 7 seed in the AFC. This win by the Broncos also eliminates the Cincinnati Bengals and Miami Dolphins from playoff contention. The Seahawks have taken back the lead over the Rams with a 16-yard touchdown pass from Geno Smith to Noah Fant, who somersaulted into the end zone. After the 2-point conversion failed, it's a 30-25 lead with the Rams looking to solidify the No. 3 seed with a win. The Rams are now up 25-24 over Seattle as Joshua Karty capped off a seven-play drive with a 38-yard field goal. A win gets the Rams the No. 3 seed in the NFC and would make the Buccaneers the No. 4 seed. The No. 7 seed is going to go to the Denver Broncos as they have built up a 38-0 lead over the Chiefs. Audric Estime ran through for a goal-line touchdown to further put them out in front. This will eliminate both the Dolphins and Bengals. After Justin Herbert ripped off a 41-yard run to get the Chargers in the red zone, the QB completed a goal-line touchdown pass to Will Dissly. That increases the L.A. lead to 27-13. The Chargers get the No. 5 seed with a win. Los Angeles is still sticking around with the Seahawks, despite playing mostly backups. Jimmy Garoppolo found Tyler Johnson for a fourth-quarterback touchdown. That made it a 24-22 Seattle lead after L.A. failed to convert the 2-point attempt. No. 3 seed on the line for the Rams with a win. With the Broncos leading the Chiefs, the Dolphins playoff hopes are dwindling. However, even if Denver was down, Miami isn't doing itself any favors as the Jets have built a double-digit lead midway through the third quarter. New York now holds an 18-6 lead. Denver is on its way to clinching a playoff berth as they have now built up a 31-0 lead over the Kansas City Chiefs with just under three minutes to play in the third quarter. Marvin Mims has two touchdowns on the day to help put Denver out in front. With a win, the Broncos are the No. 7 seed in the AFC, while the Dolphins and Bengals are eliminated. Seattle is now up 24-16 over the Rams in their regular season finale. If the Rams don't mount a come back, they will be the No. 4 seed in the NFC, while the Buccaneers will be the No. 3 seed. Los Angeles is starting to pull away from the Raiders. After netting a field goal, they are up by double-digits over Las Vegas. Again, if the Chargers -- who have already clinched a playoff spot -- win, they are the No. 5 seed and will take on the Houston Texans in the wild-card round. If they lose, they'll face the Baltimore Ravens as the No. 6 seed. Miami's fate is tied to the Broncos losing on Sunday, and they are currently up 24-0 over the Chiefs. If Denver somehow blows their game and Miami rallies, the Dolphins would clinch a playoff spot. The Rams decided to rest starters for this game and find themselves behind by just four at the break. If L.A. comes back and wins this game, they'll be the No. 3 seed in the NFC. If they lose, they'll be the No. 4 seed. The Chargers snuck ahead of the Raiders with 10 seconds left in the first half. If they hold onto this lead, they'll be the No. 5 seed in the AFC. With the Broncos holding a commanding lead over the Chiefs this may not matter, but the Jets have gone ahead of the Dolphins with a Rodgers touchdown to Allen Lazard. If the Broncos blow this game, a win by Miami would get them into the playoffs. If both Denver and Miami lose, Cincinnati is in. Again, looks like Denver has this secure. At halftime, it's all Broncos, who hold a 24-0 lead over the Chiefs. Kansas City elected to rest starters, but this is a massive game for Denver as a win would put them in the playoffs. They are well on their way to securing that and eliminating the Bengals and Dolphins in the process. Cameron Dicker netted a 49-yard field goal to cut the Raiders lead to a single point with a minute left in the first half. As we noted, the Chargers are playing for seeding as a win would secure the No. 5 seed and a loss would land them as the No. 6 seed. If Denver holds this lead over the Chiefs, it will send them to the playoffs. It'll also eliminate the Cincinnati Bengals and Miami Dolphins from contention. Denver is running away with the No. 7 seed in the AFC, going up over the Chiefs by three scores. Los Angeles elected to rest key starters, so seeing them fall behind isn't a surprise. That said, D.K. Metcalf hauled in a touchdown to increase Seattle's lead to 14-3. If the Rams lose, they'll be the No. 4 seed in the NFC and the Bucs will be the No. 3 seed. Jakobi Meyers is torching the Chargers secondary with the latest coming as a 25-yard touchdown to give the Raiders a 10-3 lead. So far today, Meyers has six catches for 86 yards and that score. Again, this game doesn't mean anything for Las Vegas, but it does for the Chargers seeding. They'd be the No. 5 seed with a win and the No. 6 seed with a loss. The Dolphins are clinging to playoff hopes and are getting a strong effort from running back De'Von Achane. He ripped off a 61-yard gain to get Miami in the red zone. If the Dolphins win and the Broncos lose, they are in the playoffs. Las Vegas is up 3-0 over the Chargers. L.A. has already solidified a place in the playoffs, but the seeding is still to be determined. If they lose, they are the No. 6 seed. If they win, they are the No. 5 seed. That's the difference between playing the Ravens (No. 6 seed) or Texans (No. 5 seed). Seattle has jumped out to a 7-0 lead over the Rams with a Jake Bobo touchdown. While this game doesn't mean anything for the Seahawks, it does determine seeding in the NFC. If the Rams lose, they'll be the No. 4 seed. If they win, they'll be the No. 3 seed, flip-flopping with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. After connecting on a 47-yard gain, Bo Nix and Courtland Sutton capped off the drive with a touchdown. This gives Denver a commanding 14-0 lead. Again, if the Broncos win, they are in the playoffs as the No. 7 seed. The Broncos are on the move again after scoring an early touchdown. Bo Nix uncorked a 47-yard pass to Courtland Sutton, who is also eyeing some key incentives. He needed 82 yards to max out a $2 million bonus coming into today. The Denver Broncos have taken an early 7-0 lead over the Kansas City Chiefs thanks to a 32-yard touchdown from Marvin Mims. If the Broncos simply win this game, they will secure the No. 7 seed in the AFC and eliminate the Bengals and Dolphins. The Tampa Bay Buccaneers are your NFC South champions.

Week 18 is set up to be monumental in the NFL starting with big games in the AFC on Saturday and ending with a winner-take-all game on Sunday night. In between, there is plenty of intrigue. On Saturday, the Baltimore Ravens clinched the three seed and in the process, forced the Pittsburgh Steelers into a wild card spot. The most intriguing part of the early afternoon window on Sunday is the NFC South, where a Buccaneers win solidified them as the winner of the division. The Washington Commanders won and the Green Bay Packers lost, locking Washington into the six seed and Green Bay in the seven. In the late afternoon, the Denver Broncos clinched their playoff spot with a win and the Chargers finished in fifth after their win, dropping the Steelers for the six seed. We also saw the Rams lose, which moves the Buccaneers up to the three seed in the NFC while dropping LA to four. That’s a big difference in quality of opponent, it would seem. The Sunday night game is a huge showdown between the Detroit Lions and Minnesota Vikings.

They scored with just over three minutes left to make it a 25-point game and clinch the three seed in the AFC. The Bengals are 9-8 and have won their fifth straight game to stay aline in the playoff race. They need a lot of help un Sunday, but they are alive. The Steelers lost four straight in December, and could slip to the sixth seed if the Chargers win on Sunday. Pittsburgh would then travel to the Baltimore Ravens, who won the AFC North on Saturday. The results happened almost simultaneously, when the Packers allowed a last-second field goal and the Commanders scored a go-ahead two-point conversion to lock in the playoff seeding. The Packers will face the Eagles in a rematch of the Week 1 Brazil game while the Commanders and will play the three seed. Tampa didn’t play Atlanta, but the two were locked in a final battle for the NFC South. The Bucs’ win over the Saints locked up the division for Tampa. They got some help, too, as the Seahawks knocked off the Rams, allowing Tampa to move up to the three seed. Bo Nix and the Denver Broncos absolutely smoked the Chiefs on Sunday, but KC didn’t really care. The Buffalo Bills will host Denver in the wild card round and the Broncos’ rookie QB not only gets to the playoffs in his first season, but potentially validates Denver’s decision to move on from Russell Wilson. The Seahawks had some financial incentives to play for, but the Rams needed a win to stay in third place in the NFC. Seattle won, and coupled with the Bucs win earlier, means the Rams will host the loser of the Lions/Vikings showdown.

                "title": "Game Recap: Rams fall to Seahawks 30-25",
                "content": "Senior Staff Writer INGLEWOOD, Calif. – The Rams (10-7) fell to the Seahawks 30-25 on Sunday at SoFi Stadium. The loss means Los Angeles will be the No. 4 seed in the NFC and host the loser of Lions-Vikings next weekend in the Wild Card round of the playoffs. Down five with 3:19 remaining in the fourth quarter, Los Angeles marched to the Seattle 9-yard line to face a 4th-and-3 with 21 seconds left, but quarterback Jimmy Garoppolo's pass intended for wide receiver Jordan Whittington was incomplete. Kicker Josh Karty set the franchise rookie kicker scoring record with his made extra point attempt and four made field goals. He also tied Frank Corral (29) for the most made field goals by a rookie kicker in franchise history. Starting for Matthew Stafford – who was one of several offensive starters resting – Garopollo completed 27 of 41 pass attempts for 334 yards with two touchdowns against one interception in the loss. Here is the complete game recap, presented by Quidel: Seattle took an early lead on a 4-yard touchdown pass from Smith to wide receiver Jake Bobo with 5:21 left in the first quarter. The Rams added a 37-yard field goal by Karty to cut their deficit to four late in the first quarter. The Seahawks extended their lead to 14-3 on a 20-yard touchdown pass from quarterback Geno Smith to wide receiver DK Metcalf, but the Rams responded with a 6-yard touchdown pass from quarterback Jimmy Garoppolo to tight end Tyler Higbee to again cut their deficit to four midway through the second quarter. After kicker Jason Myers connected on a 56-yard field goal to put Seattle up 17-10 with 3:21 left in the first half, Los Angeles answered with a 43-yard kickoff return by Whittington. The prime field position went away three plays later after Garoppolo's pass intended for wide receiver Tyler Johnson was intercepted by Seahawks safety Julian Love, though the Seahawks didn't come away with points on the possession. Karty drilled a career-long 58-yard field goal at the end of the first half for a 17-13 halftime deficit. A 57-yarder midway through the third quarter reduced the Rams' deficit to just one. The Seahawks responded with a 4-yard touchdown pass from Smith to tight end A.J. Barner, then the Rams countered with a 4-yard touchdown pass from Garoppolo to wide receiver Tyler Johnson, but the ensuing 2-point attempt was unsuccessful, leaving the Rams trailing by two early in the fourth quarter. Karty's 38-yard field goal put the Rams ahead 25-24 for their first lead of the game with 7:29 to play, but Seattle regained the lead 30-25 on a 16-yard touchdown pass from Smith to tight end Noah Fant on the following drive. The ensuing 2-point attempt failed, leaving the Rams with a five-point deficit with 3:19 remaining. L.A.'s last-gasp drive was kept alive by a 7-yard fourth down completion from Garoppolo to Higbee and reached Seattle's 9-yard line, but the unsuccessful fourth-down attempt ended it.

The Los Angeles Rams have already won the NFC West and clinched a postseason berth, but they could improve their seeding in their Week 18 matchup with the Seattle Seahawks. The Rams (10-6) can clinch the No. 3 seed with a win, while a loss, plus results from other games, could push them to the 4-seed. As for the Seahawks (9-7), they were eliminated from postseason contention last week but could still achieve their first double-digit win season since 2020. Los Angeles prevailed on the road, 26-20, in Week 9, and the Rams have won the last three matchups. Matthew Stafford, Cooper Kupp, Puka Nacua and Kyren Williams are among the Los Angeles starters who will be held out (rest). Kickoff is set for 4:25 p.m. ET from SoFi Stadium in Inglewood, Calif. Seattle is favored by 7.5 points in the latest Seahawks vs. Rams odds, while the over/under is 38.5 points per SportsLine consensus. Before entering any Rams vs. Seahawks picks, you'll want to see the NFL predictions from the model at SportsLine. The model, which simulates every NFL game 10,000 times, is up well over $7,000 for $100 players on top-rated NFL picks since its inception. The model enters Week 18 of the 2024 NFL season on an incredible 30-14 betting hot streak on top-rated NFL picks this year -- a stunning 68% success rate. Longer term, it is on a 210-142 roll on top-rated NFL picks that dates back to the 2017 season and a 64-35 roll on top-rated NFL picks since Week 7 of 2022. The model also ranked in the top 10 on NFLPickWatch four of the past six years on straight-up NFL picks and beat more than 94% of CBS Sports Football Pick'em players four times during that span. Anyone following at sportsbooks and on betting apps has seen strong returns. The model has set its sights on Seahawks vs. Rams. You can head to SportsLine to see its picks. Here are several NFL betting lines for Rams vs. Seahawks: The Rams have been playing as well as anyone over the last few months, going 9-2 over their last 11 games. Winning the turnover battle has been essential during this run, with Los Angeles boasting a plus-nine mark over this stretch. That strength should capitalize on a Seattle weakness as just five teams have more giveaways than the Seahawks' 24 this season. The Rams also don't hurt themselves as they've committed the fewest penalties of any team this season. Sean McVay's side also has a huge advantage with both recent history and with the spread. L.A. has outright won six of its last eight matchups with Seattle, while covering in seven of those eight meetings. Additionally, the Seahawks enter Sunday's game with three straight ATS defeats in the 2024 NFL season, while the Rams have covered in four of their last five. See which team to pick here. Seattle has played much better away from Lumen Field this season as its 6-1 road record is the second-best in the NFL. The team is also averaging 24 points on the road, compared to 19.3 at home, and its offensive potential may be too much for the Rams to contend with. Los Angeles has failed to reach 20 points in each of its last three games, averaging only 14.7 points over this stretch, despite all three opponents being teams currently under .500. Geno Smith ranks in the top five in both passing yards and completion percentage, and he has dangerous wideouts at his disposal. Jaxon Smith-Njigba is showing why he was a first-round pick as he's closing in on 100 catches and has over 1,100 receiving yards. Meanwhile, DK Metcalf is closing in on 1,000 yards himself and has a history of success versus the Rams, with seven touchdowns over his last seven games against them. Finally, veteran Tyler Lockett could be playing in his final game as a Seahawk and would want to put out an impressive showing, just as he did in Week 9 versus L.A. when he had 63 yards and a score. See which team to pick here. The model has simulated Seahawks vs. Rams 10,000 times and the results are in. The model is leaning over the total, and it's also generated a point-spread pick that is hitting in well over 50% of simulations. You can only see the pick at SportsLine. So who wins Rams vs. Seahawks on Sunday, and which side of the spread cashes in well over 50% of simulations? Visit SportsLine right now to see which side of the Seahawks vs. Rams spread you should be all over Sunday, all from the model on a 210-142 roll on its top-rated NFL picks, and find out. © 2004-2024 CBS Interactive.

                "content": "Trey Aubrey Lance (born May 9, 2000) is an American professional football quarterback for the Dallas Cowboys of the National Football League (NFL). He played college football for the North Dakota State Bison, where he received the Walter Payton and Jerry Rice Awards as a freshman en route to winning the 2020 NCAA Division I Football Championship Game. Lance was selected third overall by the San Francisco 49ers in the 2021 NFL draft, but limited play and injuries led to him being traded after two seasons to the Cowboys. Lance was born on May 9, 2000, in Marshall, Minnesota.[1] He was trained mainly by his father, Carlton, a former cornerback for the Saskatchewan Roughriders of the Canadian Football League and the London Monarchs of the World League of American Football.[1][2][3][4] Lance played running back in youth football and first played at quarterback in middle school.[4][1] He later attended Marshall High School, where he was viewed as the best quarterback prospect in Minnesota.[5] Lance initially wanted to play at the University of Minnesota and had been ready to commit there after attending a recruiting event in February 2017. However, he was deemed a wide receiver or defensive back prospect by them and other Power Five schools.[3][1] Lance eventually committed to North Dakota State in December 2017.[3][6][7] Lance was redshirted at North Dakota State for the 2018 season, but played in two games in which he recorded two rushing touchdowns. Lance was named the starter in 2019 and led the Bison to the 2020 NCAA Division I Football Championship Game and was named the MVP during the 28–20 victory.[8][1] He finished the season completing 192-of-287 passes for 2,786 yards, 28 touchdowns, and no interceptions, an NCAA record for most passing attempts in a season without an interception while also rushing for 1,100 yards and 14 touchdowns.[9] For his performance that season, Lance won the Walter Payton Award as the FCS's most outstanding offensive player and the Jerry Rice Award as the FCS's best freshman.[10][11] Lance was set to start again in 2020 before the season was postponed due to the COVID-19 pandemic. His only game appearance that season was in a single game against Central Arkansas in October 2020. Lance threw for two touchdowns and ran for an additional two, while throwing the only interception of his college career.[9] The Bison were scheduled to make up the rest of the season in early 2021, but Lance announced following the game that he would opt out to prepare for the 2021 NFL draft.[9] Ahead of the 2021 NFL draft, most analysts predicted Lance or Alabama quarterback Mac Jones would be taken third overall by the San Francisco 49ers, who traded up with the Miami Dolphins in exchange for their first-round picks in 2021, 2022, and 2023 and their third-round pick in 2022.[14][15] The 49ers selected Lance, making him their first first-round quarterback since Alex Smith in 2005 and the second-highest drafted FCS player after fellow North Dakota State quarterback Carson Wentz.[16] Considered a top quarterback prospect in the draft, Lance was one of five quarterbacks taken in the first round. He signed his four-year rookie contract, worth $34.1 million, on July 28, 2021.[17][18] Lance began the 2021 season as the second-string quarterback behind incumbent starter Jimmy Garoppolo, but made his NFL debut in Week 1 against the Detroit Lions. Lance was used in one play during the first quarter, in which he contributed to the eventual 41–33 road victory by throwing a five-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Trent Sherfield.[19] Two weeks later against the Green Bay Packers, Lance took the field for two plays and scored a rushing touchdown in the first as the 49ers narrowly lost by a score of 30–28.[20] During a Week 4 28–21 loss to the Seattle Seahawks, Lance saw his first significant playing time when he relieved an injured Garoppolo in the second half. Lance completed nine of 18 passes for 157 yards and two touchdowns and rushed seven times for 41 yards.[21] Due to Garoppolo's injury, Lance was named the starter for the following week's game against the Arizona Cardinals.[22] Lance completed 15-of-29 passes for 192 yards and an interception while also rushing 16 times for 89 yards during the 17–10 road loss.[23] Following the game, it was announced Lance suffered a sprained knee.[24] The injury made him unavailable for the Week 7 matchup against the Indianapolis Colts, with Nate Sudfeld replacing Lance as the second option behind a returning Garoppolo.[25] Lance returned as Garoppolo's backup during the next week's 33–22 victory over the Chicago Bears.[26] Lance did not take field again until the 49ers' final drive against the Jacksonville Jaguars in Week 11. He rushed for seven yards before taking the victory formation to complete the 30–10 road victory.[27] Lance remained the second-string quarterback for the next five weeks until Garoppolo suffered a thumb injury during a 20–17 road loss to the Tennessee Titans. Making his second start in Week 17 against the Houston Texans, Lance threw for 249 yards, two touchdowns, and an interception. The 49ers won the game by a score of 23–7, earning Lance his first career win.[28] Lance's start marked his final appearance in 2021 after Garoppolo returned for the regular season finale against the Los Angeles Rams.[29] Lance held a backup role during the 49ers' playoff run, which concluded with a defeat to the Rams in the NFC Championship Game.[30] Following the season, Lance revealed he spent the year battling a right index finger injury he suffered in a preseason game against the Las Vegas Raiders.[31] Lance was named the starter over Garoppolo for the 2022 season, but appeared in only two games before suffering a season-ending ankle injury against the Seahawks in Week 2.[32] His only full game of the season was the opener against the Bears, completing 13-of-28 passes for 164 yards and an interception in a 19–10 road loss.[33][34][35] Lance had a second surgery on his ankle to remove hardware causing irritation.[36] Lance entered the 2023 training camp on uncertain terms due to his limited play with the 49ers and the success of second-year quarterback Brock Purdy the previous season, who helped lead the 49ers to the 2022 NFC Championship Game.[37][38] Ahead of the season, Lance was named the third-string backup behind Purdy and free agent acquisition Sam Darnold, which led to further speculation over his future in San Francisco.[39] Lance completed 22-of-33 passes for 285 yards with two touchdown passes and an interception while playing in San Francisco's first two preseason games against the Las Vegas Raiders and Denver Broncos; he did not play in the team's final preseason game against the Los Angeles Chargers. On August 26, 2023, Lance was traded to the Dallas Cowboys for a 2024 fourth-round pick (Malik Mustapha).[40][41] He was later named the third-string quarterback and was a healthy scratch all season.[42][43] On May 1, 2024, the Cowboys declined the fifth-year option on Lance's contract, making him a free agent after the 2024 season.[44] During the 2024 preseason, Lance saw the majority of action at quarterback in place of starter Dak Prescott and backup Cooper Rush. In a 26–19 preseason loss to the Los Angeles Chargers, Lance completed 33 of 49 passes for 323 yards and a touchdown but was intercepted five times.[45][46] Lance is an Evangelical Christian and was a leader of his local Fellowship of Christian Athletes chapter in high school.[4] His younger brother, Bryce, plays wide receiver at North Dakota State.[47]",

                "content": "DallasCowboys.com Staff Writer FRISCO, Texas – Trey Lance doesn't know just yet whether he'll be the Cowboys starting quarterback on Sunday in the season finale against the Washington Commanders, but he's confident that he can be a starting quarterback in the NFL. \"Yea, absolutely, no doubt.\" Lance said. Why does he believe that? \"I think if you don't think that about yourself, then you've got no chance. And I truly believe that in my heart,\" Lance said. \"I feel like it's just where you drive your confidence from, what you have your faith in, and I feel like I've worked to this point to get to this point and I'm not going to stop until that opportunity comes and I'm able to make the most of it.\" Lance, who was traded for a fourth-round pick from the San Francisco 49ers in 2023, has yet to start a game for the Cowboys and instead has watched Cooper Rush start the last eight games in place of Dak Prescott. That doesn't mean that Lance isn't ready if his name is called upon though. \"I'll be ready if I get an opportunity,\" Lance said. \"Just going to continue the week normal, same as I have been, excited to end this one the right way.\" A majority of Lance's work this season has come as Dallas' scout team quarterback, allowing Lance more time to continue and develop. Even with a chance to be bumped up to the starting role on Sunday, he's comfortable in the weekly routine that's gotten him this far. \"Same exact process, I've got a real good process going through these last few years,\" Lance said. \"I've spent plenty of time as a backup my first four years, so I feel like I've learned how to prepare the right way.\" Sure, it's frustrating to not be on the field and playing every week. But Lance understands what his role is in Dallas and is working diligently to make sure that his preparation during the week translates to the development of his game. In that case, he'll be able to do whatever is asked of him when needed. \"I want to play every week, but that's the reality of this business, reality of playing quarterback in this league,\" Lance said. \"It's tough, only one guy gets to play. You've got to be realistic with yourself and find ways to continue to get better.\" With the offseason looming, Lance along with Cooper Rush is a free agent, but he isn't thinking about that right now and is instead focused on Sunday. Regardless of what happens from here on out, Lance feels he's grown during his time in Dallas. \"I feel like I've improved a ton over my last few years here, it's been a ton of fun, I've had a ton of fun getting to know these guys and see what happens after this.\" The Dallas Cowboys now know each of their opponents for the 2025 regular season, and there are some intriguing challenges ahead. The Cowboys will select 12th in the upcoming 2025 NFL draft following a 7-10 season, the highest selection the team has had since they took Micah Parsons with the 12th pick in the 2021 NFL draft. Whether or not the Cowboys move on from the head coach, this season has shown us all year, including Sunday's loss to Washington, how much change is needed. With the 2024 season in the books, the Cowboys' owner and general manager had plenty to say about the future — Jerry Jones holding court at AT&T Stadium. With questions looming over his future with the Cowboys, head coach Mike McCarthy made it clear that he wants to remain the head coach in Dallas and feels he can continue to build on the program he's created. Plays that might be forgotten include a number of plays in which the Cowboys fell short inside the 20-yard line. With Trey Lance getting the start at quarterback, the Cowboys managed only one touchdown in six trips to the red zone, eventually falling to the Commanders, 23-19, in another fourth-quarter thriller. As @spags52 writes in his Friday column, no matter how difficult it may be, the show must go on one last time in this 2024 season. Here's a final look at Sunday's preview with the Commanders and Cowboys at AT&T Stadium. In the final \"Here We Goooo\" of the 2024 season, we look at how special teams plays, a reignited pass rush, and more can help the Cowboys cap off their year with a victory at home. Cowboys guard Tyler Smith earned his second straight Pro Bowl nomination in 2024, becoming the third guard in NFL history to make two Pro Bowls before turning 24 years old. And he's only getting better. Make no mistake about it, the Commanders want revenge for what the Cowboys did to them a few weeks ago, and there are several players to watch. ©2025 Dallas Cowboys.

                "content": "POPULAR SEARCHES BROWSE BY ARLINGTON, Texas (AP) — Trey Lance started at quarterback for the Dallas Cowboys against the Washington Commanders on Sunday, his first in the regular season since San Francisco's third overall pick from the 2021 draft was still with the 49ers. The Cowboys (7-9) were out of playoff contention going into their finale against the postseason-bound Commanders (11-5). Cooper Rush started the previous eight games after Dak Prescott's season-ending hamstring tear. Lance was 3 of 4 for 70 yards on the first Dallas possession, which ended with Brandon Aubrey's 34-yard field goal for a 3-0 lead. Lance, acquired by Dallas for a fourth-round pick last season after he lost the competition for the backup job in San Francisco, played extensively this preseason. That included the entire preseason finale, when Lance threw five interceptions in a 26-19 loss to the Los Angeles Chargers. The 49ers made a bold move up to draft Lance despite his limited college experience at North Dakota State. He opted out of the COVID-19-shortened 2020 season. Lance made just four starts in two seasons with the 49ers, the last in Week 2 of 2022 when he sustained a broken ankle. Brock Purdy eventually took over as the starter and led the 49ers to an NFC championship game and the Super Bowl in consecutive seasons. ___ AP NFL: https://apnews.com/hub/nfl",

                "content": "Editions: En/nfl/dallas-cowboys Lance is listed as Cooper Rush's backup Sunday against the Eagles Trey Lance is ready to take the field as the Dallas Cowboys quarterback for the first time in his career and, although he is not considered to start Sunday's game at home against the Philadelphia Eagles, he has already raised his hand to tell his coach, Mike McCarthy, that he is ready if needed. Since his arrival to the team in 2020, McCarthy has held Rush as a backup to Dak Prescott and took over the team in the 2021 season, when Prescott lost playing time due to a hand fracture, with a 5-1 record, which allowed him to make the playoffs even without his star. On Sunday, Rush took the field to replace Prescott, who was later revealed to be out for several weeks with a hamstring problem and, according to McCarthy, Rush will be his starter while Prescott returns. However, during the week there has been speculation as to whether this situation could allow Trey Lance to receive some snaps that would allow him to show himself and get some proposal, looking ahead to next season, as his rookie contract ends at the end of this season. \"I would love the opportunity to be on the field in any way I can, if that's what the coach thinks is best,\" Lance said after Wednesday's practice at The Star. \"I feel like I'm in a really good situation right now.\" But he also reiterated that he is \"absolutely convinced\" that he can lead the offense with a level of confidence \"as high as possible.\" The specialized press assures that Lance is more talented than Rush and criticizes the latter's numbers, because the playbook is shortened to allow him to play due to his lack of mobility. However, he has appeared in 30 games since 2017 with nine touchdown passes and six interceptions and when he was called upon to start, he did so efficiently, in the backup role that has always been expected of him. Lance was a third overall pick in the NFL by the San Francisco 49ers in 2021. On that occasion, the Niners traded future picks to move up in the draft, confident that he would be their next franchise passer. Nothing happened and last year, the Cowboys traded picks for him to see if he still had something in the tank. That's why, in an intermediate solution, he could have limited time on the field, to appear in designed running plays or under the 'Wildcat' system, to take advantage of the potential of his ground game or the power of his arm. However, it should not be forgotten that in preseason he showed that he has problems making the right decisions when passing, as he threw a large number of interceptions. In fact, Jerry Jones himself acknowledged that Lance could \"really make a mark\" on the offense, even without being a starter. © Unidad Editorial Información Deportiva, S.L.U. All rights reserved.

He played college football for the Stanford Cardinal and was drafted by the Eagles in the sixth round of the 2023 NFL draft. McKee attended Centennial High School in Corona, California. He played in the 2018 U.S. Army All-American Bowl and 2018 Polynesian Bowl, where he was named MVP.[1][2] McKee committed to Stanford University to play college football.[3] McKee spent two years on a mission in Brazil for the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints before playing at Stanford.[4][5][6] His first season with the team was 2020, in which he played in one game, completing three passes for 62 yards against the then 12th-ranked Oregon Ducks. McKee competed with Jack West for the starting job in 2021. Although West started during the season opener against the Kansas State Wildcats, McKee still attempted 18 passes, completing 15 of them for 118 yards and a touchdown.[7] He was named the starter for the following week's game against the USC Trojans.[8][9] In just his 4th collegiate start, McKee led the unranked Cardinal to a miraculous upset victory against the #3 ranked Oregon Ducks, throwing 3 touchdowns and spearheading an 87-yard game-tying drive at the end of the 4th quarter.[10] McKee was selected by the Philadelphia Eagles in the sixth round, 188th overall, of the 2023 NFL draft.[13] He made his NFL debut in Week 17 of the 2024 season against the Dallas Cowboys in relief of Kenny Pickett. He completed three passes for 54 yards and two touchdowns in the 41–7 win.[14] McKee was named the starter for Week 18 against the New York Giants after Pickett and Jalen Hurts were declared inactive. With the #2 seed already secured; McKee threw for 269 yards and 2 touchdowns with no turnovers as the Eagles defeated the Giants 20–13, giving McKee his first NFL victory.[15] He married his wife Lauren, in June of 2022.[16] He is a member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints.[4]",

The one exception comes in their quarterback room, where Philadelphia is dealing with a slew of injuries. In a crucial divisional matchup last week, star quarterback Jalen Hurts was lit up on a scramble and left the game with a concussion. He was unable to clear concussion protocol ahead of Week 17, making him unavailable for the Eagles' game against the Cowboys. Kenny Pickett filled in for Hurts last week and got the call this Sunday, but Pickett's first start of the season didn't last long, as he took a shot to the ribs in the third quarter which forced him to exit the game. With both Hurts and Pickett sidelined, the Eagles turned to second-year quarterback Tanner McKee. This marked McKee's first appearance in a regular season game of his young career. McKee played admirably against the Cowboys and even cemented himself in the NFL \"history book\" of obscure stats. Tanner McKee of the @Eagles is the first player in the NFL Draft era (since 1936) to have multiple TD passes in his NFL debut while attempting five or fewer passes. pic.twitter.com/gZcJbSoIWs After making his NFL debut, let's get to know McKee's background. NFL HQ: Live NFL scores | Updated NFL standings | Full NFL schedule McKee was the Eagles' 6th-round selection in the 2023 draft out of Stanford University. Before today, McKee had only seen NFL playing time in the preseason, where he went 34-of-56 for 296 passing yards in three games during the 2024 preseason. A native of Irvine, Calif., McKee spent the entirety of his football career in the Sunshine State prior to being drafted by the Eagles. Outside of football, McKee most notably spent two years on mission for the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints before joining the football team at Stanford. Even with two years away from the game, McKee is still just 24 and in the second year of his NFL career. Prior to being drafted by the Eagles, McKee spent his collegiate career with the Stanford Cardinal. He appeared in 23 games for the Cardinal before declaring for the 2023 NFL Draft. MORE NFL WEEK 17: McKee didn't get much of a chance to play in his first collegiate season, but he went on to win the starting job in his sophomore year. He took off from there, throwing for a combined 5,274 yards and 28 touchdowns in his final two seasons. McKee's collegiate career was highlighted by an upset victory over the No. 3 ranked Oregon Ducks in his sophomore season. Unfortunately, he was not able to lead the Cardinal to a bowl game in his two seasons as the primary starter at Stanford.

                "content": "SAO PAULO, Brazil − The Eagles held a press conference for Brazilian media members Thursday, featuring some of their key players like quarterback Jalen Hurts and running back Saquon Barkley. But it was Eagles' third-string quarterback Tanner McKee, who has never played a down in an NFL game, who stole the proverbial show. ON THE SCENE:It's Day 1 in São Paulo, Brazil, for Eagles: Here are writer Martin Frank's observations SUPER BOWL OR SUPER BUST?5 things that can propel Eagles to the Super Bowl this season. This rookie will be key McKee was already well known in Brazil because he spent nearly two years in the South American country, from 2018-20, on a mission for the Church of Jesus Christ and Latter-Day Saints. He became fluent in Portuguese during that time. And it made the media's day when McKee took a question in Portuguese from a reporter, then answered in Portuguese, then translated it into English, even though the NFL had supplied a translator. This is how the exchange went after the question came in: McKee said to the crowd of about 50 media members: \"You want me to do it in Portuguese?\" The translator said the question in English: \"Basically, we wanted (to know what it’s like) to be back in Brazil again and be back here after years of living here.\" McKee responded: \"So you want me to say it in Portuguese and you’ll translate it? I can translate for myself.\" After a long answer in Portuguese, McKee says in English: “It’s great to be back.\" Then there was a long pause for effect, followed by laughter, before McKee continued: \"It’s pretty fun because I always try to keep up with my Portuguese. I try to say things on Whatsapp or Instagram with people that I’ve met and had friendships with down here. \"But it’s different (today) because we can actually talk to someone face to face. I have family that’s here. My wife’s here. My parents are here. And they’re going to Rio and places that I lived and served in … So it’s really fun to just kind of be back in the culture.\" McKee was asked another question in Portuguese about some players' fears about crime in Brazil, which has been reported over the past week. And if McKee has talked to those players to allay their fears. Again, McKee answered in Portuguese, then translated for himself: \"I was just saying, a lot of guys haven’t been here before, so it’s a lot of things they don’t really know. So they’re asking me, 'How’s the crime rate? How’s this?' We have a lot of things that we do whenever we travel to any city: We’re going to have to be safe. We’re not going to walk out on the street, whether we’re in the United States or outside of the United States. \"It’s not necessarily specific to here. It’s just a) people don’t really know the culture, and b) it is a big city … The people are great. The (players) are excited for the game. There’s nothing to be scared of. It’s pretty cool.\" The Brazilian media also asked McKee a football question, about what the offense will look like under new coordinator Kellen Moore. And here, McKee provided some clues for what the offense might look like Friday night. \"A lot of pre-snap motion, a lot of changing things on defense,\" he said. \"I think it is more quarterback friendly of just being able to go through progressions. I think with football, we have a lot of good players, and you don’t want to slow down by having to think too much. \"You just want to go out and play fast, and have a kind of clean edge and go out and play. I think that’s kind of what they’re giving us this year – go out and play football, let’s not over-complicate things ... We’re going to run what we run. I’m just excited to see it, and I’m just as excited for you guys to see AJ (Brown) and (DeVonta Smith) and Jalen and Saquon go do their thing.\" Contact Martin Frank at mfrank@delawareonline.

                "title": "Kansas City, Missouri - Wikipedia",
                "content": "Kansas City, Missouri (KC or KCMO) is the largest city in the U.S. state of Missouri by population and area. Most of the city lies within Jackson County, and other portions spill into Clay, Platte, and Cass counties. It is the central city of the Kansas City metropolitan area, which straddles the Missouri–Kansas state line and has a population of 2,392,035.[9][10][11][4] As of the 2020 census, the city had a population of 508,090,[2] making it the 37th most-populous city in the United States, as well as the sixth-most populous city in the Midwest.[12] Kansas City was founded in the 1830s as a port on the Missouri River at its confluence with the Kansas River from the west. On June 1, 1850, the town of Kansas was incorporated; shortly after came the establishment of the Kansas Territory. Confusion between the two ensued, and the name Kansas City was assigned to distinguish them soon after. Sitting on Missouri's western boundary with Kansas, with Downtown near the confluence of the Kansas and Missouri Rivers, the city encompasses about 319.03 square miles (826.3 km2), making it the 25th largest city by total area in the United States. It is one of Jackson County's two seats along with the major satellite city of Independence; and its other major Missouri suburbs include Blue Springs, Lee's Summit, Raytown, and Liberty. Its major Kansas suburbs include Overland Park, Olathe, Lenexa, and Kansas City, Kansas. The city is composed of several neighborhoods, including the River Market District, 18th and Vine District, and the Country Club Plaza. Celebrated cultural traditions include Kansas City jazz; theater, as a historical center of the Vaudevillian Orpheum circuit in the 1920s; the nickname City of Fountains; the Chiefs and Royals sports franchises; and cuisine such as Kansas City–style barbecue and strip steak. The town of Kansas, Missouri, was incorporated on June 1, 1850, reincorporated and renamed City of Kansas on March 28, 1853, and renamed Kansas City in 1889. The area straddles the border between Missouri and Kansas at the confluence of the Kansas and Missouri rivers, and was considered a good place to settle. The Antioch Christian Church, Dr. James Compton House, and Woodneath are listed on the National Register of Historic Places.[13] In past centuries, the area's tribal inhabitants include the Hopewell tradition, Mississippian culture, Kansa, Osage, Otoe, and Missouri.[14] The first documented European visitor to the eventual site of Kansas City was Étienne de Veniard, Sieur de Bourgmont, who was also the first European to explore the lower Missouri River. Criticized for his response to the Native American attack on Fort Détroit, he had deserted his post as fort commander and was avoiding French authorities. Bourgmont lived with a Native American wife in a village about 90 miles (140 km) east near Brunswick, Missouri, where he illegally traded furs. To clear his name, he wrote Exact Description of Louisiana, of Its Harbors, Lands and Rivers, and Names of the Indian Tribes That Occupy It, and the Commerce and Advantages to Be Derived Therefrom for the Establishment of a Colony in 1713 and The Route to Be Taken to Ascend the Missouri River in 1714. In the documents, he describes the junction of the \"Grande Riv[ière] des Cansez\" and Missouri River, as the first adoption of those names. French cartographer Guillaume Delisle used the descriptions to make the area's first reasonably accurate map. The Spanish took over the region in the Treaty of Paris in 1763, but were not to play a major role other than taxing and licensing Missouri River ship traffic. The French continued their fur trade under Spanish license. The Chouteau family operated under Spanish license at St. Louis, in the lower Missouri Valley as early as 1765 and in 1821 the Chouteaus reached Kansas City, where François Chouteau established Chouteau's Landing. After the 1803 Louisiana Purchase, Lewis and Clark visited the confluence of the Kansas and Missouri rivers, noting it was a good place to build a fort. In 1831, a group of Mormons from New York state led by Joseph Smith settled in the area. They built the first school within what became Kansas City, but were forced out by mob violence in 1833.[15] In 1831, Gabriel Prudhomme Sr., a Canadian trapper and partner of François Chouteau, purchased 257 acres (104 ha) fronting the Missouri River. He established a home for his wife, Josephine, and six children. He operated a ferry on the river.[citation needed] In 1833, John McCoy, son of Baptist missionary Isaac McCoy and brother-in-law of Johnston Lykins, established West Port along the Santa Fe Trail, 3 miles (4.8 kilometers) south of the river. In 1834, McCoy established Westport Landing on a bend in the Missouri to serve as a landing point for West Port, with Lykins as the first postmaster. He found it more convenient to have his goods offloaded at the Prudhomme landing next to Chouteau's landing than in Independence. Several years after Gabriel Prudhomme's death, a group of fourteen investors purchased his land at auction on November 14, 1838. By 1839, the investors divided the property and the first lots were sold in 1846 after legal complications were settled. The remaining lots were sold by February 1850.[citation needed] In 1850, the landing area was incorporated as the town of Kansas, Missouri.[16] By that time, the towns of Kansas, Westport, and nearby Independence, had become critical points in the westward expansion of the United States. Three major trails – the Santa Fe, California, and Oregon – all passed through Jackson County. On February 22, 1853, Kansas was reincorporated and renamed the City of Kansas with its first elected mayor, William Samuel Gregory. Due to a legal discovery of living outside city boundaries, he was soon succeeded by Johnston Lykins as the second (but first legally elected) mayor.[17][18] The city had an area of 0.70 square miles (1.8 km2) and a population of 2,500. The boundary lines extended from the middle of the Missouri River south to what is now Ninth Street, and from Bluff Street on the west to a point between Holmes Road and Charlotte Street on the east.[19] During the Civil War, the city and its immediate surroundings were the focus of intense military activity. Although the First Battle of Independence in August 1862 resulted in a Confederate States Army victory, the Confederates were unable to leverage their win in any significant fashion, as Kansas City was occupied by Union troops and proved too heavily fortified to assault. The Second Battle of Independence, which occurred on October 21–22, 1864, as part of Sterling Price's Missouri expedition of 1864, also resulted in a Confederate triumph. Once again their victory proved hollow, as Price was decisively defeated in the pivotal Battle of Westport the next day, effectively ending Confederate efforts to regain Missouri. General Thomas Ewing, in response to a successful raid on nearby Lawrence, Kansas, led by William Quantrill, issued General Order No. 11, forcing the eviction of residents in four western Missouri counties – including Jackson – except those living in the city and nearby communities and those whose allegiance to the Union was certified by Ewing. After the Civil War, Kansas City grew rapidly. The selection of the city over Leavenworth, Kansas, for the Hannibal and St. Joseph Railroad bridge over the Missouri River brought significant growth. The population exploding after 1869, when Hannibal Bridge, designed by Octave Chanute, opened. The boom prompted a name change to Kansas City in 1889, and the city limits to be extended south and east. Westport became part of Kansas City on December 2, 1897. In 1900, Kansas City was the 22nd largest city in the country, with a population of 163,752 residents.[20] Landscape architect George Kessler shaped Kansas City into a leading example of the City Beautiful movement, with a network of boulevards and parks.[21] New neighborhoods like Southmoreland and the Rockhill District were conceived to accommodate the city's largest residencies of palatial proportions.[citation needed] The obsolescence of Union Depot in West Bottoms in favor of the new Union Station in 1914, and the opening of the Liberty Memorial in 1923, provided two of the city's most identifiable landmarks. Robert A. Long, president of the Liberty Memorial Association, was a driving force in the funding for construction. Long was a longtime resident and wealthy businessman. He built the R.A. Long Building for the Long-Bell Lumber Company, his home, Corinthian Hall (now the Kansas City Museum) and Longview Farm.[citation needed] Further spurring Kansas City's growth was the opening of the innovative Country Club Plaza development by J.C. Nichols in 1925, as part of his Country Club District plan.[citation needed] The Kansas City streetcar system once had hundreds of miles of streetcars running through the city and was one of the largest systems in the country.[22] In 1903 the 8th Street Tunnel was built as an underground streetcar system through the city. The last run of the streetcar was on June 23, 1957, but the tunnel still exists.[23] At the start of the 20th century, political machines gained clout in the city, with the one led by Tom Pendergast dominating the city by 1925. Several important buildings and structures were built during this time, including the Kansas City City Hall and the Jackson County Courthouse. During this time, he aided one of his nephew's friends, Harry S. Truman, in a political career. Truman eventually became a senator, then vice president, then president.[24] The machine fell in 1939 when Pendergast, riddled with health problems, pleaded guilty to tax evasion after long federal investigations. His biographers have summed up his uniqueness: Pendergast may bear comparison to various big-city bosses, but his open alliance with hardened criminals, his cynical subversion of the democratic process, his monarchistic style of living, his increasingly insatiable gambling habit, his grasping for a business empire, and his promotion of Kansas City as a wide-open town with every kind of vice imaginable, combined with his professed compassion for the poor and very real role as city builder, made him bigger than life, difficult to characterize.[25] Troost Avenue was once the eastern edge of Kansas City, Missouri and a residential corridor nicknamed Millionaire Row. It is now widely seen as one of the city's most prominent racial and economic dividing lines due to urban decay, which was caused by white flight.[26][27] During the civil rights era the city blocked people of color from moving to homes west of Troost Avenue, causing the areas east of Troost to have one of the worst murder rates in the country. This led to the dominating economic success of neighboring Johnson County.[28] In 1950, African Americans represented 12.2% of Kansas City's population.[20] The city's most populous ethnic group, non-Hispanic whites,[29] declined from 89.5% in 1930 to 54.9% in 2010.[20] In 1940, the city had about 400,000 residents; by 2000, it had about 440,000. From 1940 to 1960, the city more than doubled its physical size, while increasing its population by only about 75,000. By 1970, the city covered approximately 316 square miles (820 km2), more than five times its size in 1940.[citation needed] Aggressively annexing the surrounding suburbs and undeveloped land spared Kansas City from the severe population loss suffered by cities like St. Louis and Detroit, similar cities which both lost over 50% of their population in the postwar era. In the most neglected neighborhoods, however, the same pattern of abandonment occurred and left behind massive numbers of vacant lots and abandoned homes, especially in the areas east of Troost. The Hyatt Regency walkway collapse was a major disaster that occurred on July 17, 1981, killing 114 people and injuring more than 200 others during a tea dance in the 45-story Hyatt Regency hotel in Crown Center. It is the deadliest structural collapse in US history other than the September 11 attacks.[30] In 2015 a memorial called the Skywalk Memorial Plaza was built for the families of the victims of the disaster, across the street from the hotel which is now a Sheraton.[31] In the 21st century, the Kansas City area has undergone extensive redevelopment, with more than $6 billion in improvements to the downtown area on the Missouri side. One of the main goals is to attract convention and tourist dollars, office workers, and residents to downtown KCMO. Among the projects include the redevelopment of the Power & Light District into a retail and entertainment district; and the Sprint Center, an 18,500-seat arena that opened in 2007, funded by a 2004 ballot initiative involving a tax on car rentals and hotels, designed to meet the stadium specifications for a possible future NBA or NHL franchise,[32] and was renamed T-Mobile Center in 2020; Kemper Arena, which was functionally superseded by Sprint Center, fell into disrepair and was sold to private developers. By 2018, the arena was being converted to a sports complex under the name Hy-Vee Arena.[33] The Kauffman Performing Arts Center opened in 2011 providing a new, modern home to the KC Orchestra and Ballet. In 2015, an 800-room Hyatt Convention Center Hotel was announced for a site next to the Performance Arts Center & Bartle Hall. Construction was scheduled to start in early 2018 with Loews as the operator.[34] From 2007 to 2017, downtown residential population in Kansas City quadrupled and continues to grow. The area has grown from almost 4,000 residents in the early 2000s to nearly 30,000 as of 2017[update]. Kansas City's downtown ranks as the sixth-fastest-growing downtown in America with the population expected to grow by more than 40% by 2022. Conversions of office buildings such as the Power & Light Building and the Commerce Bank Tower into residential and hotel space has helped to fulfill the demand. New apartment complexes like One, Two, and Three Lights, River Market West, and 503 Main have begun to reshape Kansas City's skyline. Strong demand has led to occupancy rates in the upper 90%.[35] The residential population of downtown has boomed, and the office population has dropped significantly from the early 2000s to the mid-2010s. Top employers like AMC moved their operations to modern office buildings in the suburbs. High office vacancy plagued downtown, leading to the neglect of many office buildings. By the mid-2010s, many office buildings were converted to residential uses and the Class A vacancy rate plunged to 12% in 2017. Swiss Re, Virgin Mobile, AutoAlert, and others have begun to move operations to downtown Kansas City from the suburbs and expensive coastal cities.[36][37] The area has seen additional development through various transportation projects, including improvements to the Grandview Triangle, which intersects Interstates 435 and 470, and U.S. Route 71. In July 2005, the Kansas City Area Transportation Authority (KCATA) launched Kansas City's first bus rapid transit line, the Metro Area Express (MAX), which links the River Market, Downtown, Union Station, Crown Center and the Country Club Plaza. The KCATA continues to expand MAX with additional routes on Prospect Avenue, Troost Avenue, and Independence Avenue.[38] In 2013, construction began on a two-mile streetcar line in downtown Kansas City (funded by a $102 million ballot initiative that was passed in 2012) that runs between the River Market and Union Station, it began operation in May 2016. In 2017, voters approved the formation of a TDD to expand the streetcar line south 3.5 miles from Union Station to UMKC's Volker Campus. Additionally in 2017, the KC Port Authority began engineering studies for a Port Authority funded streetcar expansion north to Berkley Riverfront Park. Citywide, voter support for rail projects continues to grow with numerous light rail projects in the works.[39][40] In 2016, Jackson County, Missouri, acquired unused rail lines as part of a long-term commuter rail plan. For the time being, the line is being converted to a trail while county officials negotiate with railroads for access to tracks in Downtown Kansas City. On November 7, 2017, Kansas City voters overwhelmingly approved a new single terminal at Kansas City International Airport by a 75% to 25% margin. The new single terminal replaced the three existing \"Clover Leafs\" at KCI Airport on February 28, 2023. The city has an area of 319.03 square miles (826.28 km2), of which, 314.95 square miles (815.72 km2) is land and 4.08 square miles (10.57 km2) is water.[41] Bluffs overlook the rivers and river bottom areas. Kansas City proper is bowl-shaped and is surrounded to the north and south by glacier-carved limestone and bedrock cliffs. Kansas City is at the confluence between the Dakota and Minnesota ice lobes during the maximum late Independence glaciation of the Pleistocene epoch. The Kansas and Missouri rivers cut wide valleys into the terrain when the glaciers melted and drained. A partially filled spillway valley crosses the central city. This valley is an eastward continuation of the Turkey Creek Valley. It is the closest major city to the geographic center of the contiguous United States, or \"Lower 48\". Kansas City comprises more than 240[42] neighborhoods, some with histories as independent cities or as the sites of major events. The Nelson-Atkins Museum of Art opened its Euro-Style Bloch addition in 2007, and the Safdie-designed Kauffman Center for the Performing Arts opened in 2011. The Power and Light Building is influenced by the Art Deco style and sports a glowing sky beacon. The new world headquarters of H&R Block is a 20-story all-glass oval bathed in a soft green light. The four industrial artworks atop the support towers of the Kansas City Convention Center (Bartle Hall) were once the subject of ridicule, but now define the night skyline near the T-Mobile Center along with One Kansas City Place (Missouri's tallest office tower), the KCTV-Tower (Missouri's tallest freestanding structure) and the Liberty Memorial, a World War I memorial and museum that flaunts simulated flames and smoke billowing into the night skyline. It was designated as the National World War I Museum and Memorial in 2004 by the United States Congress. Kansas City is home to significant national and international architecture firms including ACI Boland, BNIM, 360 Architecture, HNTB, Populous. Frank Lloyd Wright designed two private residences and Community Christian Church there. Kansas City hosts more than 200 working fountains, especially on the Country Club Plaza. Designs range from French-inspired traditional to modern. Highlights include the Black Marble H&R Block fountain in front of Union Station, which features synchronized water jets; the Nichols Bronze Horses at the corner of Main and J.C. Nichols Parkway at the entrance to the Plaza Shopping District; and the fountain at Hallmark Cards World Headquarters in Crown Center. Since its inception in 1857, City Market has been one of the largest and most enduring public farmers' markets in the American Midwest, linking growers and small businesses to the community. More than 30 full-time merchants operate year-round and offer specialty foods, fresh meats and seafood, restaurants and cafes, floral, and home accessories.[43] The City Market has the Arabia Steamboat Museum, which houses artifacts from a steamboat that sank near Kansas City in 1856.[43] Downtown Kansas City is 2.9 square miles (7.5 km2) bounded by the Missouri River to the north, 31st Street to the south, Troost Avenue to the east, and State Line Road to the west. Areas near Downtown Kansas City include the 39th Street District, which is known as Restaurant Row,[44] and features one of Kansas City's largest selections of independently owned restaurants and boutique shops. It is a center of literary and visual arts, and bohemian culture. Crown Center is the headquarters of Hallmark Cards and a major downtown shopping and entertainment complex. It is connected to Union Station by a series of covered walkways. The Country Club Plaza, or \"the Plaza\", is an upscale, outdoor shopping, and entertainment district. It is the first suburban shopping district in the United States,[45] designed to accommodate shoppers arriving by automobile,[46] and is surrounded by apartments and condominiums, including several high rise buildings. The associated Country Club District to the south includes the Sunset Hill and Brookside neighborhoods, and is traversed by Ward Parkway, a landscaped boulevard known for its statuary, fountains, and large, historic homes. Union Station is home to Science City, restaurants, shopping, theaters, and the city's Amtrak facility. After years of neglect and seas of parking lots, Downtown Kansas City is undergoing a period of change with over $6 billion in development since 2000. Many residential properties recently have been or are under redevelopment in three surrounding warehouse loft districts and the Central Business District. The Power & Light District, a new, nine-block entertainment district comprising numerous restaurants, bars, and retail shops, was developed by the Cordish Company of Baltimore, Maryland. Its first tenant opened on November 9, 2007. It is anchored by the T-Mobile Center, a 19,000-seat sports and entertainment complex.[47] Kansas City is in the Midwestern United States, near the geographic center of the country, at the confluence of the Missouri and Kansas rivers. The city lies in either the humid continental zone when using the 0 °C (32 °F) isotherm, or in the humid subtropical zone when using the −3 °C (27 °F) isotherm.[48] The city experiences roughly 104 air frosts on average per annum.[49] [unreliable source?] The city is part of USDA plant hardiness zones 5b and 6a.[50] In the center of North America, far removed from a significant body of water, there is significant potential for extreme hot and cold swings throughout the year. The warmest month is July, with a 24-hour average temperature of 81.0 °F (27.2 °C). The summer months are hot and humid, with moist air riding up from the Gulf of Mexico, and high temperatures surpass 100 °F (38 °C) on 5.6 days of the year, and 90 °F (32 °C) on 47 days.[51][52] The coldest month of the year is January, with an average temperature of 31.0 °F (−0.6 °C). Winters are cold, with 22 days where the high temperature is at or below 32 °F (0 °C) and 2.5 nights with a low at or below 0 °F (−18 °C).[51] The official record highest temperature is 113 °F (45 °C), set on August 14, 1936, at Downtown Airport, while the official record lowest is −23 °F (−31 °C), set on December 22 and 23, 1989.[51] Normal seasonal snowfall is 13.4 inches (34 cm) at Downtown Airport and 18.8 in (48 cm) at Kansas City International Airport. The average window for freezing temperatures is October 31 to April 4, while for measurable (0.1 in or 0.25 cm) snowfall, it is November 27 to March 16 as measured at Kansas City International Airport.[51] Precipitation, both in frequency and total accumulation, shows a marked uptick in late spring and summer. Kansas City is located in Tornado Alley, a broad region where cold air from Canada collides with warm air from the Gulf of Mexico, leading to the formation of powerful storms, especially during the spring. The Kansas City metropolitan area has experienced several significant outbreaks of tornadoes in the past, including the Ruskin Heights tornado in 1957[53] and the May 2003 tornado outbreak sequence. The region can also experience ice storms during the winter, such as the 2002 ice storm during which hundreds of thousands of residents lost power for days or weeks.[54] Kansas City and its outlying areas are also subject to flooding, including the Great Floods of 1844, 1951, and 1993. Kansas City has the second largest Somali and Sudanese populations in the United States. The Latino/Hispanic population of Kansas City, which is heavily Mexican and Central American, is spread throughout the metropolitan area, with some concentration in the northeast part of the city and southwest of downtown. The Asian population, mostly Southeast Asian, is partly concentrated within the northeast side to the Columbus Park neighborhood in the Greater Downtown area, a historically Italian American neighborhood, the UMKC area and in River Market, in northern Kansas City.[60][61][62] The Historic Kansas City boundary is roughly 58 square miles (150 km2) and has a population density of about 5,000 inhabitants per square mile (1,900/km2). It runs from the Missouri River to the north, 79th Street to the south, the Blue River to the east, and State Line Road to the west. During the 1960s and 1970s, Kansas City annexed large amounts of land, which are largely undeveloped. Between the 2000 and 2010 census counts, the urban core of Kansas City continued to drop significantly in population. The areas of Greater Downtown in the center city, and sections near I-435 and I-470 in the south, and Highway 152 in the north are the only areas of Kansas City, Missouri, to have an increase in population, with the Northland population growing the most.[63] Even so, the population of Kansas City as a whole from 2000 to 2010 increased by 4.1%. In February 2022, the city had an estimated 3,000 homeless people.[65][66] The racial makeup (including Hispanics in the racial counts) was 55.30% (280,985) White alone, 26.10% (132,617) Black alone, 0.63% (3,221) Native American alone, 3.14% (15,966) Asian alone, 0.30% (1,501) Pacific Islander alone, 5.52% (28,063) Other Race alone, and 9.00% (45,737) Multiracial or Mixed Race.[70] The racial and ethnic makeup (where Hispanics are excluded from the racial counts and placed in their own category) was 52.80% (268,273) White alone (non-Hispanic), 25.78% (130,983) Black alone (non-Hispanic), 0.36% (1,854) Native American alone (non-Hispanic), 3.11% (15,793) Asian alone (non-Hispanic), 0.29% (1,456) Pacific Islander alone (non-Hispanic), 0.47% (2,366) Other Race alone (non-Hispanic), 5.20% (26,396) Multiracial or Mixed Race (non-Hispanic), and 12.00% (60,969) Hispanic or Latino.[69] The federal government is the largest employer in the Kansas City metro area, with more than 146 agencies. Kansas City is one of ten regional office cities for the US government.[71] The Internal Revenue Service maintains a large service center in Kansas City that occupies nearly 1.4 million square feet (130,000 m2).[72] It is one of only two sites to process paper returns.[73] The IRS has approximately 2,700 full-time employees in Kansas City, growing to 4,000 during tax season. The General Services Administration has more than 800 employees. Most are at the Bannister Federal Complex in South Kansas City. The Bannister Complex housed the Kansas City Plant, which is a National Nuclear Security Administration facility operated by Honeywell. The Kansas City Plant has since been moved to a new location on Botts Road. Honeywell employs nearly 2,700 at the Kansas City Plant, which produces and assembles 85% of the non-nuclear components of the United States nuclear bomb arsenal.[74] The Social Security Administration has more than 1,700 employees in the metro, with more than 1,200 at its downtown Mid-America Program Service Center (MAMPSC).[75] One of the largest US drug manufacturing plants is the Sanofi-Aventis plant in south Kansas City on a campus developed by Ewing Kauffman's Marion Laboratories.[76] It has been developing academic and economic institutions related to animal health sciences, with Manhattan, Kansas at one end of the[77] Kansas City Animal Health Corridor, and Kansas City hosting the National Bio and Agro-Defense Facility which researches animal diseases. The Stowers Institute for Medical Research engages in medical basic science research, working with Open University and University of Kansas Medical Center in a joint Interdisciplinary Graduate Program in Biomedical Science (IGPBS). Agriculture companies include Dairy Farmers of America, the largest dairy co-op in the United States. The National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics and The National Association of Basketball Coaches are based in Kansas City. The Kansas City Federal Reserve Bank opened a new building in 2008 near Union Station. Missouri is the only state to have two of the 12 Federal Reserve Bank headquarters, with the second in St. Louis. Kansas City's effort to get the bank was helped by former mayor James A. Reed, who as senator, broke a tie to pass the Federal Reserve Act.[78] The national headquarters for the Veterans of Foreign Wars is headquartered just south of Downtown. With a Gross Metropolitan Product of $41.68 billion in 2004, Kansas City's (Missouri side only) economy makes up 20.5% of Missouri's gross state product.[79] In 2014, Kansas City was ranked #6 for real estate investment.[80] Three international law firms, Lathrop & Gage, Stinson Leonard Street, and Shook, Hardy & Bacon are based in the city. In 2022, the city had an estimated 3,000 homeless people,[65] addressed by the Zero KC initiative.[66] The following companies are headquartered in Kansas City, Missouri: According to the city's Fiscal Year 2014–15 Comprehensive Annual Financial Report,[82] the top ten principal employers are as follows: Kansas City, Missouri is abbreviated as KCMO and the metropolitan area as KC. Residents are Kansas Citians. It is officially nicknamed the City of Fountains.[83] The fountains at Kauffman Stadium, commissioned by original Kansas City Royals owner Ewing Kauffman, are the largest privately funded fountains in the world.[84] In 2018, UNESCO designated Kansas City its first and only City of Music in the US, in \"recognition of [Kansas City's] investment and commitment to music, arts, and creativity as a driver of urban economic development\".[85] The city has more boulevards than any other city except Paris and has been called Paris of the Plains. Soccer's popularity, and Children's Mercy Park's popularity as a home stadium for the U.S. Men's National Team, led to the appellation Soccer Capital of America. The city is called the Heart of America, in proximity to the population center of the United States and the geographic center of the 48 contiguous states. In 1886, Kansas City had only two theaters when David Austin Latchaw, originally from rural Pennsylvania, moved there. Latchaw maintained friendly relations with several actors such as Otis Skinner, Richard Mansfield, Maude Adams, Margaret Anglin, John Drew, Minnie Maddern Fiske, Julia Marlowe, E. H. Sothern, and Robert Mantell.[86] Theater troupes in the 1870s toured the state, performing in cities or small towns forming along the railroad lines. Rail transport had enhanced the theater troupe tour market, by allowing full costumes, props, and sets. As theater grew in popularity after the mid-1880s, that number increased and by 1912, ten new theaters had been built in Kansas City. By the 1920s, Kansas City was the center of the vaudevillian Orpheum circuit.[86] The Kansas City Repertory Theatre is the metro's top professional theatre company.[87] The Starlight Theatre is an 8,105-seat outdoor theatre designed by Edward Delk.[88] The Kansas City Symphony was founded by R. Crosby Kemper Jr. in 1982 to replace the defunct Kansas City Philharmonic, which was founded in 1933.[89] The symphony performs at the Kauffman Center for the Performing Arts. Matthias Pintscher is the symphony's music director and lead conductor. Lyric Opera of Kansas City, founded in 1958, performs at the Kauffman Center, offers one American contemporary opera production during its season, consisting of either four or five productions. The Civic Opera Theater of Kansas City performs at the downtown Folly Theater and at the UMKC Performing Arts Center. Every summer from mid-June to early July, The Heart of America Shakespeare Festival performs at Southmoreland Park near the Nelson-Atkins Museum; the festival was founded by Marilyn Strauss in 1993. The Kansas City Ballet, founded in 1957 by Tatiana Dokoudovska, is a ballet troupe comprising 25 professional dancers and apprentices. Between 1986 and 2000, it combined with Dance St. Louis to form the State Ballet of Missouri, although it remained in Kansas City. From 1980 to 1995, the Ballet was run by dancer and choreographer Todd Bolender. The Ballet offers an annual repertory split into three seasons, performing classical to contemporary ballets.[90] The Ballet also performs at the Kauffman Center. The Kansas City Chorale is a professional 24-voice chorus with an annual concert series and a concert in Phoenix each year with sister choir the Phoenix Chorale. The Chorale has made several recordings, including with the Phoenix Chorale. Kansas City jazz in the 1930s marked the transition from big bands to the bebop influence of the 1940s. The 1979 documentary The Last of the Blue Devils portrays this era in interviews and performances by local jazz notables. In the 1970s, Kansas City attempted to resurrect the glory of the jazz era in a family-friendly atmosphere. In the 1970s, an effort to open jazz clubs in the River Quay area of City Market along the Missouri ended in a gang war. Three of the new clubs were blown up in what ultimately ended Kansas City mob influence in Las Vegas casinos. The annual Kansas City Blues and Jazz Festival attracts top jazz stars and large tourist audiences. In 2007 it was rated Kansas City's \"best festival\" by The Pitch.[91] Live music venues are throughout the city, with the highest concentration in the Westport entertainment district centered on Broadway and Westport Road near Country Club Plaza, and the 18th and Vine neighborhood's flourish for jazz music. A variety of music genres are performed or have originated there, including musicians Janelle Monáe, Puddle of Mudd, Isaac James, The Get Up Kids, Shiner, Flee The Seen, The Life and Times, Reggie and the Full Effect, Coalesce, The Casket Lottery, The Gadjits, The Rainmakers, Vedera, The Elders, Blackpool Lights, The Republic Tigers, Tech N9ne, Krizz Kaliko, Kutt Calhoun, Skatterman & Snug Brim, Mac Lethal, Ces Cru, and Solè. Kansas City Jazz Orchestra is big band style. In 2018, UNESCO named Kansas City a City of Music, as the only one in the United States. The designation is based on the city's rich musical heritage, and its $7 million budget for improving the 18th and Vine Jazz District in 2016.[85] In 2021, the US Census Bureau estimated 253,040 people of Irish descent in the metro, with 123,934 in Jackson, Clay, and Platte Counties.[92] The Irish were the first large immigrant group to settle in Kansas City following the lead of Fr. Bernard Donnelly (c. 1800–1880) and founded its first newspaper.[93] The Irish community includes bands, dancers, Irish stores, newspapers, and the Kansas City Irish Center at Drexel Hall in Midtown. The first book detailing Irish history in Kansas City is Missouri Irish: Irish Settlers on the American Frontier, published in 1984. The Kansas City Irish Fest is held over Labor Day weekend in Crown Center and Washington Park.[94][95] Missouri voters approved riverboat casino gaming on the Missouri and Mississippi Rivers by referendum with a 63% majority on November 3, 1992. The first casino facility in the state opened in September 1994 in North Kansas City by Harrah's Entertainment (now Caesar's Entertainment).[96] The combined revenues for four casinos exceeded $153 million per month in May 2008.[97] The metropolitan area is home to six casinos: Ameristar Kansas City, Argosy Kansas City, Harrah's North Kansas City, Isle of Capri Kansas City, the 7th Street Casino (which opened in Kansas City, Kansas, in 2008) and Hollywood Casino (which opened in February 2012 in Kansas City, Kansas). Kansas City is famous for its steak and Kansas City-style barbecue.[98] During the heyday of the Kansas City Stockyards, the city was known for its Kansas City steaks or Kansas City strip steaks. The most famous of its steakhouses is the Golden Ox in the Kansas City Live Stock Exchange in the West Bottoms stockyards. These stockyards were second only to those of Chicago in size, but they never recovered from the Great Flood of 1951 and eventually closed. Jess & Jim's Steakhouse was founded in 1938 in the Martin City neighborhood. The Kansas City Strip cut of steak is similar to the New York Strip cut, and is sometimes referred to just as a strip steak. Along with Texas, Memphis, North Carolina, and South Carolina, Kansas City is lauded as a \"world capital of barbecue\". More than 90 barbecue restaurants[99] operate in the metropolitan area.[100][101] The American Royal each fall hosts what it claims is the world's biggest barbecue contest. Classic Kansas City-style barbecue was an inner-city phenomenon that evolved from the pit of Henry Perry, a migrant from Memphis who is generally credited with opening the city's first barbecue stand in 1921, and blossomed in the 18th and Vine neighborhood. Arthur Bryant's took over the Perry restaurant and added sugar to his sauce to sweeten the recipe a bit. In 1946 one of Perry's cooks, George W. Gates, opened Gates Bar-B-Q, later Gates and Sons Bar-B-Q when his son Ollie joined the family business. Bryant's and Gates are the two definitive Kansas City barbecue restaurants; native Kansas Citian and essayist Calvin Trillin famously called Bryant's \"the single best restaurant in the world\" in an essay he wrote for Playboy magazine in the 1960s. Fiorella's Jack Stack Barbecue is also well regarded. In 1977, Rich Davis, a psychiatrist, test-marketed his own concoction called K.C. Soul Style Barbecue Sauce. He renamed it KC Masterpiece, and in 1986, he sold the recipe to the Kingsford division of Clorox. Davis retained rights to operate restaurants using the name and sauce, whose recipe popularized the use of molasses as a sweetener in Kansas City-style barbecue sauces.[citation needed] Kansas City has several James Beard Award-winning/nominated chefs and restaurants. Winning chefs include Michael Smith, Celina Tio, Colby Garrelts, Debbie Gold, Jonathan Justus and Martin Heuser. A majority of the Beard Award-winning restaurants are in the Crossroads district, downtown and in Westport. 50.75% of Kansas City area residents have a known religious affiliation. The most common religious denominations in the area are:[105] In 1911, Elias Disney moved his family from Marceline to Kansas City. They lived in a new home at 3028 Bellefontaine with a garage he built, in which Walt Disney made his first animation.[106] In 1919, Walt returned from France where he had served as a Red Cross ambulance driver in World War I. He started the first animation company in Kansas City, Laugh-O-Gram Studio, in which he designed Mickey Mouse. When the company went bankrupt, Walt Disney moved to Hollywood and started The Walt Disney Company on October 16, 1923. Professional sports teams in Kansas City include the Kansas City Chiefs in the National Football League (NFL), the Kansas City Royals in Major League Baseball (MLB) and Sporting Kansas City in Major League Soccer (MLS). The following table lists the professional teams in the Kansas City metropolitan area: 2021 (as KC NWSL) 2003 (as the Kansas City T-Bones) The Chiefs, now a member of the NFL's American Football Conference, started play in 1960 as the Dallas Texans of the American Football League before moving to Kansas City in 1963. The Chiefs lost Super Bowl I to the Green Bay Packers by a score of 35–10. In 1969, the team became the last AFL champion and won Super Bowl IV.[107] In 2020, they won Super Bowl LIV,[108] in 2023, they won Super Bowl LVII,[109] and in 2024 they won Super Bowl LVIII.[110] The Athletics baseball franchise played in the city from 1955, after moving from Philadelphia, to 1967, when the team relocated to Oakland, California. The city's current Major League Baseball franchise, the Royals, started play in 1969, and are the only major league sports franchise in Kansas City that has not relocated or changed its name. The Royals were the first American League expansion team to reach the playoffs (in 1976) to reach the World Series (in 1980) and to win the World Series (in 1985).[111] The Royals returned to the World Series in 2014 and won in 2015.[112][113] The Kansas City Monarchs, formerly the Kansas City T-Bones, is an unaffiliated minor league team. It played in the independent Northern League from 2003 until 2010 and has been part of the independent American Association since 2011. Its home is Legends Field in Kansas City, Kansas.[114] The Kansas City Wiz became a charter member of Major League Soccer in 1996. It was renamed the Kansas City Wizards in 1997. In 2011, the team was renamed Sporting Kansas City and moved to its new stadium Children's Mercy Park in Kansas City, Kansas. It won the MLS Cup twice, the Supporters' Shield once, and the US Open Cup four times. FC Kansas City played from 2013 to 2017 in the National Women's Soccer League; the team's home games were held at Swope Soccer Village. They won the NWSL in 2014 and 2015. The team folded after the 2017 season and its assets were transferred to Utah Royals FC. After the 2020 season, the Utah Royals folded and its assets were transferred to a new Kansas City team, now known as the Kansas City Current. The Current moved to Children's Mercy Park after spending their first season at Legends Field, where they were known as KC NWSL.[115] On October 6, 2022, the team's ownership broke ground on an 11,500-seat soccer-specific stadium on the Berkley Riverfront Park,[116][117] with a goal to open by March 2024.[118] Kansas City was selected on June 16, 2022, as one of the eleven US host cities for the 2026 FIFA World Cup.[119] In college athletics, Kansas City has been the home of the Big 12 College Basketball Tournaments. The men's tournament has been played at T-Mobile Center since March 2008. The women's tournament is played at Municipal Auditorium. The city has one NCAA Division I program, the Kansas City Roos, representing the University of Missouri–Kansas City (UMKC). The program, historically known as the UMKC Kangaroos, adopted its current branding after the 2018–19 school year. In addition to serving as the home stadium of the Chiefs, Arrowhead Stadium serves as the venue for various intercollegiate football games. It has hosted the Big 12 Championship Game five times. On the last weekend in October, the MIAA Fall Classic rivalry game between Northwest Missouri State University and Pittsburg State University took place at the stadium. Kansas City is represented on the rugby pitch by the Kansas City Blues RFC, a former member of the Rugby Super League and a Division 1 club. The team works closely with Sporting Kansas City and splits home-games between Sporting's training pitch and Rockhurst University's stadium. Kansas City briefly had four short-term major league baseball teams between 1884 and 1915: the Kansas City Unions of the short-lived Union Association in 1884, the Kansas City Cowboys in the National League in 1886, a team of the same name in the then-major league American Association in 1888 and 1889, and the Kansas City Packers in the Federal League in 1914 and 1915. The Kansas City Monarchs of the now-defunct Negro National and Negro American Leagues represented Kansas City from 1920 through 1955. The city also had a number of minor league baseball teams between 1885 and 1955. After the Kansas City Cowboys began play in the 1885 Western League, from 1903 through 1954, the Kansas City Blues played in the high-level American Association minor league. In 1955, Kansas City became a major league city when the Philadelphia Athletics baseball franchise relocated to the city in 1955. Following the 1967 season, the team relocated to Oakland, California. Kansas City was represented in the National Basketball Association by the Kansas City Kings (called the Kansas City-Omaha Kings from 1972 to 1975), when the former Cincinnati Royals moved to the Midwest in 1972. The team left for Sacramento in 1985.[120] In 1974, the National Hockey League placed an expansion team in Kansas City called the Kansas City Scouts. The team moved to Denver in 1976, then to New Jersey in 1982 where they have remained ever since as the New Jersey Devils. Kansas City has 132 miles (212 km) of boulevards and parkways, 214 urban parks, 49 ornamental fountains, 152 baseball diamonds, 10 community centers, 105 tennis courts, 5 golf courses, 5 museums and attractions, 30 pools, and 47 park shelters.[121][122] These amenities are found across the city. Much of the system, designed by George E. Kessler, was constructed from 1893 to 1915. Cliff Drive, in Kessler Park on the North Bluffs, is a designated State Scenic Byway. It extends 4.27 miles (6.87 km) from The Paseo and Independence Avenue through Indian Mound on Gladstone Boulevard at Belmont Boulevard, with many historical points and architectural landmarks. Ward Parkway, on the west side of the city near State Line Road, is lined by many of the city's largest and most elaborate homes.[123][124] The Paseo is a major north–south parkway that runs 19 miles (31 km) through the center of the city beginning at Cliff Drive. It was modeled on the Paseo de la Reforma, a fashionable Mexico City boulevard. It has been recently renamed Martin Luther King Jr. Boulevard and now the city has voted to change it back to the Paseo.[125] Swope Park is one of the nation's largest city parks, comprising 1,805 acres (3 sq mi), more than twice the size of New York City's Central Park.[126] It features a zoo, a woodland nature and wildlife rescue center, 2 golf courses, 2 lakes, an amphitheatre, a day-camp, and numerous picnic grounds. Hodge Park, in the Northland, covers 1,029 acres (416 ha) (1.61 sq. mi.). This park includes the 80-acre (320,000 m2) Shoal Creek Living History Museum, a village of more than 20 historical buildings dating from 1807 to 1885. Berkley Riverfront Park, 955 acres (3.86 km2) on the banks of the Missouri River on the north edge of downtown, holds annual Independence Day celebrations and other festivals. A program went underway to replace many of the fast-growing sweetgum trees with hardwood varieties.[127] In 1974, the Kansas City Park and Boulevard System was recognized by the American Society of Civil Engineers (ASCE) as a National Historic Civil Engineering Landmark.[128] The nomination noted that this park system was among \"...the first to integrate the aesthetics of landscape architecture with the practicality of city planning, stimulating other metropolitan areas to undertake similar projects.\"[129] The park's plan developed by landscape architect George Kessler included some of the \"...first specifications for pavements, gutters, curbs, and walks. Other engineering advances included retaining walls, earth dams, subsurface drains, and an impoundment lake – all part of Kansas City's legacy that has influenced urban planning in cities throughout North America.\"[129] Kansas City is home to the largest municipal government in the state of Missouri. The city has a council/manager form of government. The role of city manager has diminished over the years. The non-elective office of city manager was created following excesses during the Pendergast days. The mayor is the head of the Kansas City City Council, which has 12 members elected from six districts (one member elected by voters in the district and one at-large member elected by voters citywide). The mayor is the presiding member. By charter, Kansas City has a \"weak-mayor\" system, in which most of the power is formally vested in the city council. However, in practice, the mayor is very influential in drafting and guiding public policy. Kansas City holds city elections in every fourth odd-numbered year. The last citywide election was held in April 2023. The officials took office in August 2023 and will hold the position until 2027. Pendergast was the most prominent leader during the machine politics days. The most nationally prominent Democrat associated with the machine was Harry S Truman, who became a Senator, Vice President and then President of the United States from 1945 to 1953. Kansas City is the seat of the United States District Court for the Western District of Missouri, one of two federal district courts in Missouri. The United States District Court for the Eastern District of Missouri is in St. Louis. It also is the seat of the Western District of the Missouri Court of Appeals, one of three districts of that court (the Eastern District is in St. Louis and the Southern District is in Springfield). The Mayor, City Council, and City Manager are listed below:[130][131] Kansas City hosted the 1900 Democratic National Convention, the 1928 Republican National Convention and the 1976 Republican National Convention. The urban core of Kansas City consistently votes Democratic in presidential elections; however, on the state and local level Republicans often find success, especially in the Northland and other suburban areas of Kansas City. Kansas City is represented by three members of the United States House of Representatives: Some of the earliest organized violence in Kansas City was during the American Civil War. Shortly after the city's incorporation in 1850, so-called Bleeding Kansas erupted, affecting border ruffians and Jayhawkers. During the war, Union troops burned all occupied dwellings in Jackson County south of Brush Creek and east of Blue Creek to Independence in an attempt to halt raids into Kansas. After the war, the Kansas City Times turned outlaw Jesse James into a folk hero via its coverage. James was born in the Kansas City metro area at Kearney, Missouri, and notoriously robbed the Kansas City Fairgrounds at 12th Street and Campbell Avenue. In the early 20th century under Pendergast, Kansas City became the country's \"most wide open town\". Though this gave rise to Kansas City jazz and to the Kansas City mob (initially under Johnny Lazia), and the arrival of organized crime. In the 1970s, the Kansas City mob was involved in a gang war over control of the River Quay entertainment district, in which three buildings were bombed and several gangsters were killed. Police investigations gained after boss Nick Civella was recorded discussing gambling bets on Super Bowl IV (where the Kansas City Chiefs defeated the Minnesota Vikings). The war and investigation led to the end of mob control of the Stardust Casino, which was the basis for the 1995 film Casino, though the production minimizes the Kansas City connections. As of November 2012[update], Kansas City ranked 18th on the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI)'s annual survey of crime rates for cities with populations over 100,000.[135] Much of the city's violent crime occurs on the city's lower income East Side. Revitalizing the downtown and midtown areas has been fairly successful and now these areas have below average violent crime compared to other major downtowns.[136][irrelevant citation] According to a 2007 analysis by The Kansas City Star and the University of Missouri-Kansas City, downtown experienced the largest drop in crime of any neighborhood in the city during the 2000s.[137] Many universities, colleges, and seminaries are in the Kansas City metropolitan area, including: The city is not served by one unified school district, but 15 separate districts due to the historical unwillingness of suburban voters to merge their existing school districts with the Kansas City district as the city expanded its limits in the 1950s and 1960s.[139] School outcomes vary between and even within districts, with a some high schools being nationally ranked,[140] and others having some of the lowest graduation rates.[141] There are also numerous private schools; Catholic schools are governed by the Diocese of Kansas City. The following public school districts serve Kansas City:[142] In the Jackson County portion of the city: In the Cass County portion: In the Clay County portion: In the Platte County portion: The Kansas City Star is the area's primary newspaper. William Rockhill Nelson and his partner, Samuel Morss, first published the evening paper on September 18, 1880. The Star competed with the morning Kansas City Times before acquiring that publication in 1901. The Times name was discontinued in March 1990, when the morning paper was renamed the Star.[144] Weekly newspapers include The Call (which is focused toward Kansas City's African-American community), the Kansas City Business Journal, The Pitch, Ink, and the bilingual publications Dos Mundos and KC Hispanic News. Publications include Ingram's Magazine and a local society journal, the Independent. The city is served by two major faith-oriented newspapers: The Kansas City Metro Voice, serving the Christian community, and the Kansas City Jewish Chronicle, serving the Jewish community. It is the headquarters of the National Catholic Reporter, an independent Catholic newspaper. The Kansas City media market (ranked 32nd by Arbitron[145] and 31st by Nielsen[146]) includes 10 television stations, 30 FM and 21 AM radio stations. Kansas City broadcasting jobs have been a stepping stone for national television and radio personalities, notably Walter Cronkite and Mancow Muller. WDAF radio (now at 106.5 FM; original 610 AM frequency now occupied by KFNZ) signed on in 1927 as an affiliate of the NBC Red Network, under the ownership of The Star. In 1949, the Star signed on WDAF-TV as an affiliate of the NBC television network. The Star sold off the WDAF stations in 1957, following an antitrust investigation by the United States government (reportedly launched at Truman's behest, following a long-standing feud with the Star) over the newspaper's ownership of television and radio stations. KCMO radio (originally at 810 AM, now at 710 AM) signed on KCMO-TV (now KCTV) in 1953. The respective owners of WHB (then at 710 AM, now at 810 AM) and KMBC radio (980 AM, now KMBZ), Cook Paint and Varnish Company and the Midland Broadcasting Company, signed on WHB-TV/KMBC-TV as a time-share arrangement on VHF channel 9 in 1953; KMBC-TV took over channel 9 full-time in June 1954, after Cook Paint and Varnish purchased Midland Broadcasting's stations. The major broadcast television networks have affiliates in the Kansas City market (covering 32 counties in northwestern Missouri, with the exception of counties in the far northwestern part of the state that are within the adjacent Saint Joseph market, and northeastern Kansas); including WDAF-TV 4 (Fox), KCTV 5 (CBS), KMBC-TV 9 (ABC), KCPT 19 (PBS), KCWE 29 (The CW), KSHB-TV 41 (NBC) and KSMO-TV 62 (MyNetworkTV). Other television stations in the market include Saint Joseph-based KTAJ-TV 16 (TBN), Kansas City, Kansas-based TV25.tv (consisting of three locally owned stations throughout northeast Kansas, led by KCKS-LD 25, affiliated with several digital multicast networks), Lawrence, Kansas-based KMCI-TV 38 (independent), Spanish-language station KUKC-LD 20 (Univision), Spanish-language station KGKC-LD 39 (Telemundo), and KPXE-TV 50 (Ion Television). The Kansas City television stations also serve as alternates for the nearby Saint Joseph television market. Kansas City has been a locale for film and television productions. Between 1931 and 1982 Kansas City was home to the Calvin Company, a large film production company that specialized in promotional shorts for corporations and in educational films for schools and the government. Calvin was an important venue for Kansas City arts, training local filmmakers who went on to Hollywood careers and also employing local actors, most of whom earned their main income in fields such as radio and television announcing. Kansas City native Robert Altman directed movies at the Calvin Company, which led him to shoot his first feature film, The Delinquents, in Kansas City using many local players. The 1983 television movie The Day After was filmed in Kansas City and Lawrence, Kansas. The 1995 film Truman, starring Gary Sinise, was filmed in the city. Other films shot in or around Kansas City include Article 99, Mr. & Mrs. Bridge, Kansas City, Paper Moon, In Cold Blood, Ninth Street, and Sometimes They Come Back (in and around nearby Liberty, Missouri). More recently, a scene in the controversial film Brüno was filmed in downtown Kansas City's historic Hotel Phillips. Today, Kansas City is home to an active independent film community. The Independent Filmmaker's Coalition is an organization dedicated to expanding and improving independent filmmaking in Kansas City. The city launched the KC Film Office in October 2014 with the goal of better marketing the city for prospective television shows and movies to be filmed there. The City Council passed several film tax incentives in February 2016 to take effect in May 2016; the KC Film Office is coordinating its efforts with the State of Missouri to reinstate film incentives on a statewide level.[147] Kansas City was named as a top city to live and work in as a movie maker in 2020.[148] Originally, Kansas City was the launching point for travelers on the Santa Fe, Oregon, and California trails. Later, with the construction of the Hannibal Bridge across the Missouri River, it became the junction of 11 trunk railroads. More rail tonnage passes through the city than through any other U.S. city. Trans World Airlines (TWA) located its headquarters in the city, and had ambitious plans to turn the city into an air hub. Missouri and Kansas were the first states to start building interstates with Interstate 70. Interstate 435, which encircles the entire city, is the second longest beltway in the Interstate Highway System. (Interstate 275 around Cincinnati, Ohio is the longest.) The Kansas City metro area has more limited-access highway lane-miles per capita than any other large US metro area, over 27% more than the second-place Dallas–Fort Worth metroplex, over 50% more than the average American metropolitan area. From 2013 to 2017 the average commuting time was 21.8 minutes.[149] The Sierra Club blames the extensive freeway network for excessive sprawl and the decline of central Kansas City.[150] However, the relatively uncongested road network contributes significantly to Kansas City's position as one of America's largest logistics hubs.[151] Kansas City has a confluence of major U.S. interstate highways: I-29, I-35, I-49, I-70, I-435, I-470, I-635, and I-670. Kansas City includes these US highways: US 24, US 40, US 50, US 56, US 69, US 71, and US 169. State routes are Route 1, Route 9, Route 12, Route 45, Route 78, Route 92, Route 150, Route 152, Route 210, Route 269, Route 283, Route 291, and Route 350. Missouri supplemental routes are Route AA, Route D, Route K, Route V, and Route W.[152] Other routes include the Chicago–Kansas City Expressway and the Lewis and Clark National Historic Trail. Kansas City International Airport (airport code MCI) was built to TWA's specifications to make a world hub.[153] Its original passenger-friendly design placed each of its gates 100 feet (30 m) from the street. Following the September 11, 2001 attacks, it required a costly overhaul to conform to tighter security protocols from the Transportation Security Administration. In March 2023, a new $1.5 billion terminal opened on the site of the old Terminal A.[154] Designed by Skidmore, Owings and Merrill, it is a single, advanced technology terminal with 39 gates, eventually planned to entirely replace remaining Terminals B and C. Charles B. Wheeler Downtown Airport (airport code MKC) was TWA's original headquarters and houses the Airline History Museum. It is used for general aviation and airshows. Like most American cities, Kansas City's mass transit system was originally rail-based. From 1870 to 1957, Kansas City's streetcar system was among the top in the country, with over 300 miles (480 km) of track at its peak. The rapid sprawl in the following years led this private system to be shut down. Amtrak currently operates two routes via Kansas City, the Southwest Chief to Chicago or Los Angeles, and the Missouri River Runner to St. Louis. On December 28, 1965, the Kansas City Area Transportation Authority (KCATA) was formed via a bi-state compact created by the Missouri and Kansas legislatures. The compact gave the KCATA responsibility for planning, construction, owning, and operating passenger transportation systems and facilities within the seven-county area. In July 2005, the KCATA launched Kansas City's first bus rapid transit line, the Metro Area Express (MAX). MAX links River Market, Downtown, Union Station, Crown Center, and Country Club Plaza.[155] MAX operates and is marketed more like a rail system than a local bus line. A unique identity was created for MAX, including 13 modern diesel buses and easily identifiable \"stations\". MAX features (real-time GPS tracking of buses, available at every station), and stoplights automatically change in their favor if buses are behind schedule. In 2010, a second MAX line was added on Troost Avenue.[156] The city is planning another MAX line down Prospect Avenue.[157] The Prospect MAX line launched in 2019 and Mayor Quinton Lucas announced the service would be fare-free indefinitely.[158] On December 12, 2012, a ballot initiative to construct a $102 million, 2-mile (3.2 km), modern KC Streetcar line in downtown Kansas City was approved by local voters.[159] The streetcar route runs along Main Street from River Market to Union Station; it debuted on May 6, 2016.[160] A new non-profit corporation made up of private sector stakeholders and city appointees – the Kansas City Streetcar Authority – operates and maintains the system. Unlike many similar systems around the U.S., no fare is to be charged initially.[161] Residents within the proposed Transportation Development District are determining the fate of the KC Streetcar's southern extension through Midtown and the Plaza to UMKC. The Port Authority of Kansas City is also studying running an extension to Berkley Riverfront Park. In 2015, the KCATA, Unified Government Transit, Johnson County Transit, and IndeBus began merging from individual metro services into one coordinated transit service for the metropolitan area, called RideKC. The buses and other transit options are branded as RideKC Bus, RideKC MAX, RideKC Streetcar, and RideKC Bridj. RideKC Bridj is a micro transit service partnership between Ford Bridj and KCATA that began on March 7, 2016, much like a taxicab service and with a mobile app. The merger and full coordination is expected to be complete by 2019.[162] Intercity bus services to Kansas City are provided by Greyhound Lines and Jefferson Lines at the Kansas City Bus Station. Amtrak also serves the city at Union Station via the Southwest Chief and Missouri River Runner. A 2015 study by Walk Score ranked Kansas City as the 42nd most walkable out of the 50 largest U.S. cities.[163] As a whole, the city has a score of 34 out of 100. However, several of the more densely populated neighborhoods have much higher scores: Westport has a score of 91, the Downtown Loop has a score of 85, the Crossroads scored 85, and the Plaza scored 83.[164] Those ratings range from \"A Walker's Paradise\" to \"Very Walkable\". In April 2017, voters approved an $800 million general obligation bond, part of which is designated for sidewalk repairs and creating complete-streets. According to the American Community Survey, 81.6 percent of working Kansas City residents commuted to work by driving alone, 7.9 percent carpooled, 2.7 percent used public transportation, and 1.7 percent walked to work. About 1.5 percent commuted by other means, including taxi, bicycle, or motorcycle. About 4.6 percent of working Kansas City residents worked at home.[165] In 2015, 11.4 percent of Kansas City households were without a car, which was virtually unchanged in 2016 (11.3 percent). The national average was 8.7 percent in 2016. Kansas City averaged 1.58 cars per household in 2016, compared to a national average of 1.8 per household.[166] Kansas City has 15 sister cities:[167] Current or former long-time residents include cartoonists Walt Disney,[172] Friz Freleng, and Ub Iwerks; musicians Count Basie and Tech N9ne; actors Don Cheadle and Chris Cooper; politicians Emanuel Cleaver and Tom Pendergast; and reporter Walter Cronkite.",

                "content": "Bryce Young (born July 25, 2001) is an American professional football quarterback for the Carolina Panthers of the National Football League (NFL). He played college football for the Alabama Crimson Tide, setting the school record for most passing yards in a single game (559) and winning several player of the year awards in 2021, including the Heisman Trophy. Young was selected first overall by the Panthers in the 2023 NFL draft. Young was born on July 25, 2001, in Wynnewood, Pennsylvania.[1][2] He later moved to Pasadena, California, where he lived for most of his adolescence.[3][4] Young attended Cathedral High School in Los Angeles and transferred to Mater Dei High School in Santa Ana, California, in 2018.[5] As a senior, he was the Los Angeles Times Player of the Year and California's Gatorade Football Player of the Year after throwing for 4,528 yards and 58 touchdowns.[6][7] He was also the USA Today High School Offensive Player of the Year.[8] During his high school career he passed for 13,520 yards and 152 touchdowns and was a five star recruit ranked the nation's #1 quarterback prospect and second overall recruit.[9][10] After originally committing to USC to play football, Young instead decided to play at Alabama.[11][12] Young has been friends with Houston Texans quarterback C. J. Stroud since the two went to nearby high schools in Southern California. The two continued their friendship in college, and ultimately were selected with the first two picks in the 2023 NFL draft.[13] During his freshman year at Alabama, Young was the backup to junior quarterback Mac Jones throughout the 2020 season. On September 26, 2020, Young made his collegiate debut in the late third quarter against Missouri at Faurot Field. That night, Young went 5-of-8 for 54 passing yards with two rushing yards on four attempts.[14] On November 21, he threw his first collegiate touchdown pass in a 63–3 victory over Kentucky.[15] Young appeared in nine games in 2020, finishing the season with 156 passing yards and one touchdown.[16] On September 4, 2021, Young made his debut as the Crimson Tide's starting quarterback.[17] In a 44–13 win over the #14 Miami Hurricanes, he passed for 344 yards and four touchdowns.[18] On November 20, against Arkansas, Young threw for 559 yards to break the Alabama school record for passing yards in a game. The previous record was held by Scott Hunter.[19] Young won the Heisman Trophy following the end of the 2021 season, becoming the first Alabama quarterback to win the award.[20][21] In addition to the Heisman Trophy, Young won AP Player of the Year, the Davey O'Brien Award, the Manning Award, the Maxwell Award, Southeastern Conference (SEC) Offensive Player of the Year, and was a consensus All-American.[22][23][24][25][26][27] Overall, Young passed for 4,872 yards, 47 passing touchdowns, and seven interceptions to go along with three rushing touchdowns in 15 games.[28] He led the SEC in passing yards and passing touchdowns in the 2021 season.[29] Young started his junior season off strong with 195 passing yards and five passing touchdowns to go along with five carries for 100 rushing yards and one rushing touchdown in the 55–0 victory over Utah State.[30] In his junior year, Young led the Crimson Tide to an 11–2 record, including a 45–20 victory over No. 14 Kansas State in the 2022 Sugar Bowl.[31][32] He finished in sixth in Heisman Trophy voting.[33] He passed for 3,328 yards, 32 passing touchdowns, and five interceptions to go along with 49 carries for 185 rushing yards and four rushing touchdowns in 12 games.[34] On January 2, 2023, Young announced that he would forgo his senior season and enter the 2023 NFL Draft.[35] Young was selected by the Carolina Panthers as the first overall pick in the 2023 NFL Draft. The Panthers, who held the ninth overall pick, traded that pick, wide receiver D. J. Moore, and several other draft picks to the Chicago Bears for the first overall pick.[37] He signed his four-year rookie contract, worth $37.9 million fully guaranteed, on July 21, 2023.[38] On September 10, 2023, Young made his NFL debut in a Week 1 loss against the Atlanta Falcons, where he threw his first career touchdown to Hayden Hurst. He also threw two interceptions, both to Falcons safety Jessie Bates.[39] In week two, Young threw for 153 yards and a touchdown to Adam Thielen in his home and primetime debut in a 20-17 loss to the New Orleans Saints.[40] On September 22, 2023, Young was ruled out for Week 3 with a sprained ankle.[41] On October 29, 2023, in Week 8, Young got his first win as he defeated 2nd overall pick C. J. Stroud and the Houston Texans 15–13. Young threw for 235 yards and one touchdown in the win.[42] On December 17, 2023, in Week 15 against the rival Falcons, Young threw for 167 yards and led a 95-yard game-winning drive for a 9–7 victory. The win was the Panthers' second of the season and ended a six-game losing streak.[43] The following week against Jordan Love and the Green Bay Packers, Young had the best game of his rookie year to that point, throwing for 312 yards and two touchdowns, both to D. J. Chark. The Panthers lost 33–30.[44] He finished his rookie season throwing for 2,877 yards, 11 touchdowns and ten interceptions as the Panthers finished with a 2–15 record.[45][46] Young also finished with a passer rating of 72.2, a QBR of 33.2 and completed only 59.8% of his passes.[47] Young had the worst passer rating under pressure of any quarterback in the league with 27.6.[48] Young finished the season with the second worst touchdown percentage by a starting quarterback, only behind Pittsburgh Steelers quarterback Kenny Pickett, at 1.9%.[49] Following the second week of the season, Young was benched for veteran Andy Dalton. The Panthers had lost their first two games to the Saints and Chargers by a combined 60 points, as Young threw three interceptions and no touchdowns over that span.[50] Prior to the Panthers' Week 8 game against the Denver Broncos, Young was named the starter again as a result of Dalton spraining his thumb in a car accident.[51] During his return, Young threw his first touchdown pass of the season on a six yard pass to rookie receiver Xavier Legette. He finished the game completing 24 of 37 passes for 224 yards, two touchdowns and two interceptions as the Panthers lost 28-14.[52] After losing to the Broncos, Young led victories against the New Orleans Saints and New York Giants, marking the first time the Panthers won consecutive games since 2022.[53] In his back-to-back wins with the Panthers, Young threw a combined two touchdowns, one interception and completed 60.8% of his passes (31-of-51) for 297 total yards.[54][55] Despite Dalton recovering from his injury, Young was once again named the team's starter ahead of their Week 12 game against the Kansas City Chiefs.[56] Young led the Panthers to a narrow 30-27 loss to the Chiefs in which he recorded one of his best games as a starter. He completed 60% of his passes (21-of-35) for 263 yards and a touchdown. [57] He continued to lead the Panthers through two narrow losses by single score margins against Tampa Bay and Philadelphia.[58][59] During the game against the Buccaneers, Young threw for 298 yards, the second most of his career up to that point, and a passing touchdown as well as rushing for another one.[60] In week 16, Young led the Panthers to a 36-30 overtime victory against the Arizona Cardinals eliminating them from playoff contention.

                "content": "Editions: En/nfl/carolina-panthers The rookie QB responds to the boos and pressure, saying his confidence lies in faith and perseverance Carolina Panthers rookie quarterback Bryce Young faced a storm of emotions after another crushing defeat. In what has quickly become a rocky start to his NFL career, the young QB didn't shy away from the pressure, addressing fans and critics with a level of poise beyond his years. As the final whistle blew on Sunday's blowout loss, Young's frustration was evident. Cameras caught the 22-year-old walking off the field, his head hung low, eyes seemingly welling with the weight of expectation. It was a moment of raw vulnerability that fans across the league latched onto, sparking discussions about the mental toll of the NFL on a young star. The boos that echoed through the stadium at halftime were deafening. A once-loyal Panthers fanbase, desperate for a spark, voiced their displeasure as the team struggled to find its footing. Young, however, wasn't fazed. After the game, the rookie addressed those jeers, speaking directly to the heart of the fanbase. \"I understand the frustration,\" Young said. \"I know this city loves the Panthers. That passion is something I respect, and I share that same fire. We're all disappointed, but this is part of the journey.\" His words struck a balance between humility and determination, acknowledging the pain while refusing to back down. But what really grabbed headlines was Young's response when questioned about his confidence following back-to-back rough outings. \"I draw confidence from the Lord,\" he said, his voice unwavering. \"I've been blessed beyond measure, and while this isn't the start I envisioned, I believe everything happens for a reason. My faith is stronger than any setback.\" In a sport where swagger and bravado are often seen as key traits for a quarterback, Young's calm reliance on his faith stood out. His response quickly went viral, with fans and fellow athletes praising the maturity he displayed in the face of adversity. Young's message wasn't just about football, though. His remarks touched on something deeper-the idea that success isn't always immediate, and that sometimes the greatest challenges forge the strongest individuals. For Panthers fans, it was a glimmer of hope amid the team's struggles. As the media buzzed with reactions to his comments, Young remained steady, choosing not to dwell on the losses but instead focus on the bigger picture. \"This is part of the process,\" he continued. \"There's no growth without challenges. I'm committed to this team, and we'll get better. We just have to stay the course.\" Young's perspective is a refreshing one, especially in a league that demands instant results. His ability to take the long view, to see past the immediate setbacks, speaks to the mindset of a player who isn't just playing for the next game, but for a greater purpose. For now, the Panthers' struggles continue, but one thing is certain: Bryce Young isn't backing down. He's standing firm, drawing strength from his faith, and ready to face whatever comes next. The road ahead may be tough, but if Young's words are any indication, he's prepared for the journey. © Unidad Editorial Información Deportiva, S.L.U. All rights reserved. Follow us",

                "content": "Watch CBS News By Kate Gibson Edited By Alain Sherter Updated on: January 5, 2025 / 2:06 PM EST / CBS News Update: President Biden is now expected to sign the Social Security Fairness Act at 4 p.m. on Sunday, January 5. President Biden on Monday is expected to sign into law legislation extending full Social Security benefits to nearly 3 million U.S. retirees, according to advocates for the measure. Decades in the making, the Social Security Fairness Act would eliminate two federal policies that prevent former police officers, firefighters, postal workers, teachers and others with a public pension from collecting their full Social Security benefits. \"The Senate finally corrects a 50-year mistake,\" proclaimed Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, a Democrat from New York, after senators approved the legislation on December 21 in the waning hours of the 118th Congress. Organizations representing firefighters and police officers told members that they had been informed that Mr. Biden was poised to sign the bill. The president was scheduled to hold a signing ceremony for the measure on Monday at 10 a.m. Eastern Time, according to the International Association of Fire Fighters, IAFF, and the National Association of Police Organizations (NAPO), although his schedule could change. Edward Kelly, IAFF's general president, was invited to the signing. \"The IAFF has been working on the issue for years, and Mr. Kelly has been present on Capitol Hill lobbying for the WEP/GPO repeal,\" an IAFF spokesperson told CBS MoneyWatch. NAPO's leadership was informed of the coming event by the White House, NAPO told its members in a post on social media. The bill's passage is \"a monumental victory for millions of public service workers who have been denied the full benefits they've rightfully earned,\" said Shannon Benton, executive director for the Senior Citizens League, which advocates for retirees and which has long pushed for the expansion of Social Security benefits. \"This legislation finally restores fairness to the system and ensures the hard work of teachers, first responders and countless public employees is truly recognized.\" Benton said she was told by a congressional staffer that Mr. Biden would sign the bill into law on Monday. The White House did not respond to requests for comment. The Social Security Fairness Act would repeal two federal policies — the Windfall Elimination Provision (WEP) and the Government Pension Offset (GPO) — that reduce Social Security payments to nearly 3 million retirees. That encompasses people who also collect pensions from state and federal jobs that aren't covered by Social Security, including teachers, police officers and U.S. postal workers. The bill would also rescind a second provision that reduces Social Security benefits for those workers' surviving spouses and family members. The WEP impacts about 2 million Social Security beneficiaries and the GPO nearly 800,000 retirees. The Senate held its first hearings into the policies in 2003. The measure had bipartisan support, yet faced last-minute objections from some Republicans due to its cost. According to the Congressional Budget Office, the proposed legislation would add a projected $195 billion to federal deficits over a decade. Senate supporters of the bill, including Louisiana Republican Bill Cassidy, argued that while Social Security's funding shortfall needs to be addressed, that shouldn't be done at the expense of retirees with public pensions. Once signed into law, the legislation is retroactive for Social Security payments starting in January 2024, according to the text of the bill. That means eligible recipients who previously only received partial benefits will get a full payment retroactive to a year ago. Still, calculating what beneficiaries are owned may not be simple or quick. \"The Social Security Fairness Act would eliminate the reduction of Social Security benefits while entitled to public pensions from work not covered by Social Security,\" the Social Security Administration stated in an update Thursday. \"The Social Security Administration is evaluating how to implement the Act if signed into law. We will provide more information as soon as available.\" Americans who previously filed for Social Security benefits that are partially or completely offset do not need to take any action other than to verify that the Social Security Administration has their current mailing address and direct deposit information. \"Most people can do this online with their personal my Social Security account without calling or visiting Social Security. Visit www.ssa.gov/myaccount to sign in or create your account,\" the agency advised. Workers with a public pension who are interested in filing for Social Security benefits can file online at ssa.gov or schedule an appointment, it added.
