                "content": "A winter storm will bring heavy snow and hazardous ice from the Central Plains to the Mid-Atlantic later this week, the National Weather Service (NWS) has warned. Icing, snow, and other wintry weather affects pose a risk to travel conditions, and can disrupt other aspects of daily life, such as prompting school closures. Certain groups, such as young infants and senior citizens, are also at higher risk from plunging temperatures. The service said there was \"growing confidence\" that a storm will produce \"significant wintry weather\" beginning later this week. Regions in the Central Plains and Mississippi Valley, particularly along and north of Interstate 70, are likely to experience heavy snowfall, with a 60-80 percent chance of accumulating at least six inches, the NWS said. A winter storm is expected to begin impacting the Central Plains by Saturday night, with heavy snow and significant icing potential spreading eastward to the Mid-Atlantic by early next week. See our latest Key Messages below. ❄️ pic.twitter.com/habFiutQEO The NWS map shows that central Illinois, northern Missouri, and parts of western and central Indiana are most likely to experience the storm's effects. It is also likely in parts of Maryland, Kansas, and Ohio. There is also at least a 40 percent chance of impacts in Delaware, northeast Virginia, southern Iowa, northeastern West Virginia, some northern regions of Kentucky, and the southeastern tip of Nebraska, as well as small pockets of New Jersey. The NWS said there is potential for significant sleet and freezing rain to impact eastern Kansas and the Ozarks, possibly extending eastward into the Tennessee and lower Ohio valleys this weekend. Additionally, some icing may affect portions of the southern Appalachians on Sunday. States with the greatest potential for \"significant\" icing included parts of Virginia, West Virginia, Kentucky, Indiana, Illinois, Missouri, and Kansas. Meteorologist Jim Cantore wrote on X, formerly Twitter: \"This is a great depiction of what that storm will produce Saturday night through Tuesday morning and the challenges... that lie ahead.\" Meteorologist Jacob Dickey wrote on X: \"Major travel impacts likely across Central and Southern Illinois by Midday Sunday with the approaching winter storm. Keeping a very close eye on things, the storm arrives Sunday morning. Amounts still TBD, but areas with over 6\" appear likely. \"Travel impacts across the Southern part of Illinois south of I-70 are expected to be major from potential ice and freezing rain. The central part of the state is expected to see more snow.\" The NWS said uncertainty remains \"regarding the timing and location of the storm track, which will be important in determining where the most significant impacts will occur.\" The service updates its forecasts regularly.

                "content": "Manage your account A massive winter storm is expected to bring \"significant wintry weather\" from the Central Plains to the Mid-Atlantic beginning later this week. The National Weather Service said Thursday morning there is growing confidence the storm will begin impacting the Central Plains by late Saturday, the Ohio and Tennessee valleys on Sunday, and the Mid-Atlantic region early next week. The weather service says that heavy lake-enhanced snow is likely for areas downwind of the Great Lakes over the next few days, with 6-12 inches of snow with isolated higher amounts possible by Saturday morning. Additionally, a low-pressure system tracking across the central U.S. is expected to produce a light swath of snowfall from Iowa across the Ohio Valley on Thursday and into the Central Appalachians on Friday. Snowfall accumulations of 6-12 inches are possible over the Central Appalachians, according to the weather service. The weather service said areas in the Central Plains and Mississippi Valley, especially along and north of Interstate 70, have a high chance of seeing at least 6 inches of snow. Further south, the weather service says there are concerns about potentially significant sleet and freezing rain affecting eastern Kansas and the Ozarks, which may extend eastward to the Tennessee and lower Ohio valleys this weekend. \"Some icing may also occur in parts of the southern Appalachians on Sunday,\" the weather service said. AccuWeather meteorologists say a major snowstorm is forecast from a \"large part of Nebraska to southern and central Ohio and West Virginia,\" and that \"enough snow to shovel and plow (3-6 inches or more) will extend for about 1,000 miles from western Nebraska to West Virginia.\" Cities expected to see many inches of snow include St. Louis, Kansas City, Indianapolis and Cincinnati, among others. The areas most likely to see the highest snowfall accumulations are somewhere from northern Missouri to west-central Illinois to northeastern Kansas, according to AccuWeather. The weather service also says that high pressure is expected to build over the Great Plains, sending \"frigid arctic air\" down through the Central and Eastern U.S. through the weekend. AccuWeather meteorologists are warning that round after found of arctic air is \"poised to plunge into the central and eastern United States,\" with each outbreak having the potential to bring colder air farther south than the previous round. This could lead to a surge in energy demands and the risk of freeze-related damage in the Southern U.S., according to AccuWeather. \"The magnitude and extent of the Arctic air will build into the first full week of January and linger through the middle of the month and will, at times, affect more than 250 million people living in more than 40 states in the Central and Eastern regions,\" according to AccuWeather forecasters.

Gunner was elevated to the role of starting quarterback for the University of Georgia after quarterback Carson Beck suffered an elbow injury during the SEC Championship Game against Texas on December 7. Beck underwent season-ending surgery and has since declared himself for the 2025 NFL Draft. Born in Tiger, Georgia, roughly 75 miles from University of Georgia’s campus in Athens, Gunner grew up a massive fan of the Bulldogs. A son of two collegiate athletes — his father, Rob, played football at Georgia Southern and his mom, Sherri, played basketball at Erskine College — he has athletics in his blood. “The number one thing for Gunner is he’s known our community, and especially our family, his friends, and those people closest to him, believe in him,” Rob told UGASports in a story published on Sunday, December 29. “We’ve always loved him and want the best for him. This is something that he’s worked for [and] something he’s dreamed of.” Rob added, “You look at pictures of your kid, and they’re throwing the ball in your backyard and dreaming of being the starting quarterback at the University of Georgia. It has happened. It is unreal.” For more about Gunner’s story, keep reading. Gunner’s great-grandfather, V.D. Stockton, served in World War II. A newspaper at the time referred to him as “Gunner Stockton.” According to The Athletic, Gunner’s parents liked the nickname so much that they decided to give it to their son. In October 2010, Gunner’s grandfather, Lawrence Stockton, died shortly after leaving Georgia’s 34-31 overtime loss to the Florida Gators at Jacksonville’s EverBank Field. According to ESPN, Lawrence walked back to a tailgating area after the game and collapsed and died from a heart attack. He was 63 years old. Gunner shares a close bond with his oldest sister, Georgia, his only sibling. The duo shared a cute moment when Georgia was dropped off at Presbyterian College in Clinton, South Carolina in the summer of 2019. “PC officially has a baller on campus,” Gunner shared via Instagram. “I know it’s gonna be hard for you not seeing me everyday but hopefully it won’t be too hard for ya 😂. You are the best. Love you more than you know ❤️” In 2021, Gunner and Georgia took in a Bulldogs game from the sidelines of Sanford Stadium. “Pretty good way to end the week,” Gunner shared via Instagram alongside a picture of him and his sister. Gunner, Georgia and the rest of their extended family spent the holidays together in 2024, just days before the Bulldogs’ game against Notre Dame in the 2025 Sugar Bowl, as evidenced by a series of photos shared by Georgia via Instagram. Gunner originally committed to play quarterback at SEC rival South Carolina. However, he announced his decommitment in January 2021. “After much discussion and prayer with my family, I have decided to decommit from The University of South Carolina,” Gunner said in a statement at the time. “Back in August, I made the decision to commit to the University, program, and staff. A lot has changed since that time, and I feel that I should reevaluate my situation.” Gunner’s decision came on the heels of Will Muschamp, the head coach to which Gunner committed, being fired. The quarterback announced his commitment to the University of Georgia later that month. If you see a 1984 Ford F-150 driving around Georgia’s campus, that’s just the team’s starting quarterback. “It was literally broke down, parked up at their house and wouldn’t crank,” his father, Rob, told the Athens Banner-Herald in a story published on Friday, December 27. “He wanted to get it running, so me and him tinkered with it.” You have successfully subscribed.

The truck has no air conditioning and more than 300,000 miles on the odometer. “I would say he’s going to continue driving that old truck no matter what kind of opportunities knock for him,” Rob said.

In two years as the starter, Beck has led the team to 24 wins, including a victory in the Orange Bowl last season. Unfortunately, the Bulldogs will be without their starting quarterback in the College Football Playoff quarterfinals against Notre Dame. Beck suffered an elbow injury in the SEC Championship game and underwent season-ending surgery to repair his UCL. Without Beck, Georgia will turn to redshirt sophomore Gunner Stockton. This will be Stockton's first career start, as he's primarily played in relief of Beck in blowouts across the past two seasons. He did replace an injured Beck in the SEC Championship game, finishing 12-of-16 for 71 yards and an INT against Texas. As Stockton prepares to take the field on the national stage, let's get to know a bit about his background as a kid growing up in Georgia. MORE: Carson Beck injury update and return timeline Stockton grew up in Tiger, Ga., a town just 16 miles south of the Tennessee border with a population of 574 people. Tiger is located in Rabun County and is quite rural, as you might expect given its size. On top of playing football and baseball, Stockton also spent his time in high school as the owner of several cows. He was responsible for 14 cows to be exact. SN's PLAYOFF HQ: Live CFP scores | Updated CFP bracket | Full CFP schedule Stockton attended Rabun County High School where he was the school's starting quarterback for all four years of his high school career. During his tenure as Rabun County's signal caller, Stockton led the team to the state quarterfinals on several occasions while absolutely lighting up the stat sheet. On top of his success in football, Stockton was a baseball star at Rabun County, earning All-America honors twice in three years. If it were not for his prolific talents as a quarterback that caused him to step away from baseball, Stockton may have earned an All-America nod for a third consecutive season. COLLEGE FOOTBALL AWARDS Stockton was absolutely dominant in high school, setting a state record for the most career passing touchdowns with 177. He was able to accomplish this through the air all while rushing for 4,372 yards and 77 touchdowns in his career. Originally committed to South Carolina, Stockton ultimately committed to Georgia as the No. 7 (No. 5 dual-threat) quarterback in the 2022 class. Stockton has spent his collegiate career waiting behind Stetson Bennett and Carson Beck. Wednesday's game will be his first start in a Bulldog uniform, and he'll get an opportunity to prove whether he can be Georgia's quarterback of the future.

                "content": "Melvin Wayne Osmond (August 28, 1951 – January 1, 2025) was an American musician. He was the second-oldest of the original Osmond Brothers singers and the fourth oldest of the nine Osmond children. Starting in 1958, Wayne and three of his brothers (Alan, Merrill, and Jay in their respective age orders) began singing as a barbershop quartet. They were later discovered in 1961 by Jay Emerson Williams, the father of Andy Williams, at a performance at Disneyland which was being filmed for the Disneyland After Dark episode of Walt Disney's Wonderful World of Color. In 1962, the four Osmonds were cast over a seven-year period on NBC's The Andy Williams Show, a musical variety program. Each of these four Osmond brothers were also cast in nine episodes of the 1963–1964 ABC Western series, The Travels of Jaimie McPheeters, with Wayne in the role of young Leviticus Kissel. In the band's rock formation, Wayne played guitar[2] and occasionally drums,[3] among many other instruments, with Wayne recalling shortly before his death that he learned to play eight instruments during his time with the band.[4] Wayne was found to have perfect pitch.[2] His last intended appearance with the Osmonds was October 13, 2018, although he made an additional appearance with his brothers a year later as a birthday present to their sister, Marie.[5] Osmond was born in Ogden, Utah, the fourth son out of nine children born to Olive May (née Davis; 1925–2004) and George Virl Osmond (1917–2007). Like the rest of his family, he was a member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. On December 13, 1974, Wayne married Kathlyn White from Bountiful, Utah, a former Miss Davis County Fair and Miss Utah of 1974. They had five children, three daughters and two sons. In the 1990s, Osmond moved to Branson, Missouri. In 1997, he was diagnosed with a brain tumor, which was successfully treated, at the expense of his hearing; the treatment damaged his cochlea, leaving Wayne nearly deaf. A stroke in 2012 left him unable to play guitar.[2] He held a pilot's license, from which he earned the nickname \"Wings,\" and continued to fly aircraft until mobility issues prevented him from doing so near the end of his life.[4] Osmond suffered another, more massive stroke and died in a hospital in Salt Lake City, Utah on January 1, 2025, at the age of 73, surrounded by his family.[6][3] This article about an American musician is a stub.

By Rania Aniftos Wayne Osmond, the second-oldest of the legendary Osmond Brothers, died on Wednesday (Jan. 1). He was 73 years old. The musician’s family confirmed the news of his death in a statement to Salt Lake City news station, KSL TV. “Wayne Osmond, beloved husband and father, passed away peacefully last night surrounded by his loving wife and five children,” the statement reads. “His legacy of faith, music, love, and laughter have influenced the lives of many people around the world. He would want everyone to know that the gospel of Jesus Christ is true, that families are forever, and that banana splits are the best dessert. We love him and will miss him dearly.” Following the news of his death, a number of Wayne’s family members took to social media to honor him. Jay Osmond said that he has “always felt the most connected to Wayne out of all of my siblings.” Related Charli XCX's 'Brat' Lights Up London Eye in New Year's Eve Fireworks Show 01/01/2025 Explore Explore The Osmonds See latest videos, charts and news See latest videos, charts and news See latest videos, charts and news See latest videos, charts and news “My heart is deeply saddened for the loss of my brother Wayne. It is said that where there is great love there is great grief as we part during our earthly journey,” the post reads. “What gives me joy is to know that my brother ‘Wings’ has earned his wings and I can only imagine the heights he is soaring right now.” Trending on Billboard Merrill Osmond noted in his post that Wayne had suffered a “massive stroke” and was hospitalized shortly before his death. “My brother was a saint before he came into this world, and he will leave as an even greater saint than he came in,” he wrote in a Facebook post. “I’ve never known a man that had more humility. A man with absolute no guile. An individual that was quick to forgive and had the ability to show unconditional love to everyone he ever met.” He continued, “His departure from this earth will be a sad moment for some, but for those who are waiting for him on the other side, there will be a massive celebration beyond anything we can imagine.” Donny Osmond also shared a heartfelt tribute on X, writing, “Wayne brought so much light, laughter, and love to everyone who knew him, especially me. He was the ultimate optimist and was loved by everyone. I’m sure I speak on behalf of every one of us siblings when I state that we were fortunate to have Wayne as a brother.” Wayne, one of nine Osmond siblings, started a barbershop quartet in 1958 alongside his brothers Alan, Merrill and Jay. After getting discovered from a Disneyland performance, the boys were cast over a seven-year period on NBC’s The Andy Williams Show beginning in 1962. When brothers Jimmy and Donny joined the group, they became known as the Osmonds and were the standout teen idols throughout the 1970s. The Osmonds had four top 10 hits on the Billboard Hot 100 — “One Bad Apple” (No. 1 in 1971), “Yo Yo” (No. 3 in 1971), “Down by the Lazy River” (No. 4 in 1972) and “Love Me For a Reason” (No. 10 in 1974). Alan and Merrill Osmond co-wrote “Down by the Lazy River,” making it the group’s biggest self-penned hit. The group’s top-charting album on the Billboard 200 was Phase-III, which reached No. 10 in 1972. The Osmond family was honored with a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame in 2003. Wayne is survived by his wife Kathlyn Louise White and their five children.

After her junior year, her uncle Michael Markle helped secure her an internship as a junior press officer at the American embassy in Buenos Aires,[30] and considered a political career.[31][32] However, she did not score high enough in the Foreign Service Officer Test to proceed further with the US State Department[33] and returned to NU. She also attended a study abroad program in Madrid.[29] In 2003, Markle earned her bachelor's degree with a double major in theater and international studies from Northwestern's School of Communication.[31][33] According to Markle, she had some difficulty getting roles early in her career due to being \"ethnically ambiguous\" because \"I wasn't black enough for the black roles and I wasn't white enough for the white ones.\"[34] To support herself between acting jobs, she worked as a freelance calligrapher and taught bookbinding.[11][35] Her first on-screen appearance was a small role as a nurse in an episode of the daytime soap opera General Hospital,[36][37] a show for which her father served as a lighting director.[38] Markle had small guest roles on the television shows Century City (2004), The War at Home (2006) and CSI: NY (2006).[36] For her role in Century City, she told the casting directors that she was a SAG-AFTRA member when she was not, but after being cast, the employers were obliged to help her join the union according to the Taft–Hartley Act.[39] Markle also did several contract acting and modeling jobs.

At age 9, she and her friends reportedly campaigned against the Gulf War.[90] Decades later, she backed Hillary Clinton during the 2016 United States presidential election and publicly denounced the opponent and eventual winner, Donald Trump. In the same year, when the referendum on the United Kingdom's membership of the European Union resulted in favor of Brexit, Markle expressed her disappointment on Instagram.[91] In 2017, Markle recommended the book Who Rules the World? by left-wing intellectual Noam Chomsky on her Instagram account.[92] In July 2018, Irish Senator Catherine Noone tweeted that the Duchess was \"pleased to see the result\" of the Irish referendum on legalizing abortion. Meghan received criticism for potentially breaching the protocol that prohibits royals from interfering in politics;[93] Noone deleted her tweet and emphasized that her statement was misleading and \"the Duchess was not in any way political\".[93] After she returned to the United States and as an eligible voter, she released a video with her husband encouraging others to register for the 2020 United States presidential election on National Voter Registration Day. Some media outlets took it as an implicit endorsement of the Democratic candidate, Joe Biden, which prompted then-President Trump to dismiss their messaging at a press conference.[94] In October 2021, she penned an open letter to Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, advocating for paid leave for parents.[95] Her remarks were met by backlash from Republican representatives Jason Smith and Lisa McClain, who found her statement \"out of touch\" and criticized her interference with American politics while utilizing her British royal titles.[96] Meghan has reportedly lobbied senators from both parties on the issue of paid family leave, including Democratic senators Patty Murray and Kirsten Gillibrand, as well as Republican senators Shelley Moore Capito and Susan Collins.[97][98] She has also publicly spoken in support of federal voting protections.[99] In February 2022, she voiced her support for the Supreme Court nomination of Ketanji Brown Jackson.[100] In June 2022, she publicly supported Moms Demand Action, an organization which campaigns for safer gun laws in the US.[101] In the same month, in an interview with Jessica Yellin for Vogue, Meghan criticized the decision of the Supreme Court of the United States that abortion is not a protected constitutional right and voiced her support for the proposed Equal Rights Amendment.[102] After becoming engaged, Markle's first official public appearance with Prince Harry was at a World AIDS Day walkabout in Nottingham on December 1, 2017.[103][104] On March 12, the 2018 Commonwealth Day service at Westminster Abbey was the first royal event she attended with the Queen.[105] On March 23, Harry and Meghan made an unannounced day visit to Northern Ireland.[106] In total, Markle attended 26 public engagements prior to the wedding.[107] Meghan's first official engagement after marriage was on May 22, when she and her husband attended a garden party celebrating the charity work of King Charles III (then the Prince of Wales).[108] In July 2018, Meghan's first official trip abroad as a royal was to Dublin, Ireland, alongside Harry.[109][110] In October 2018, the Duke and Duchess traveled to Sydney for the 2018 Invictus Games.[111] This formed part of a Pacific tour that included Australia, Fiji, Tonga and New Zealand.[112][113] As representatives of the Queen, the couple were greeted warmly by crowds in Sydney, and the announcement of Meghan's pregnancy hours after their arrival delighted the public and media.[113][114] During their visit to Morocco in February 2019, the Duke and Duchess focused on projects centered on \"women's empowerment, girls' education, inclusivity and encouragement of social entrepreneurship\".[115] Meghan also participated in her husband's work as youth ambassador to the Commonwealth, which included overseas tours.[116][117] As part of establishing a separate office from that of the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge in 2019, the Duke and Duchess created an Instagram social media account, which broke the record for the fastest account at the time to reach a million followers.[118] In July 2019, the Duchess's security team were criticized for creating an empty zone of about 40 seats around her at Wimbledon where she was watching a match between Serena Williams and Kaja Juvan.[119] In August 2019, Meghan and her husband were criticized by environmental campaigners for using private jets regularly when taking their personal trips abroad, which would leave more carbon footprint per person compared to commercial planes. The criticism was in line with similar criticism faced by the royal family in June 2019, after it was claimed that they \"had doubled [their] carbon footprint from business travel\".[120][121] In September and October 2019, a Southern African tour included Malawi, Angola, South Africa and Botswana. Archie traveled with his parents, making it \"their first official tour as a family\".[122] Meghan completed 179 engagements in total in 2018 and 2019.[123] In January 2020, Meghan and Harry returned to the UK from a vacation in Canada and announced that they were stepping back from their role as senior members of the royal family and would balance their time between the United Kingdom and North America.[124][125] A statement released by the Palace confirmed that the Duke and Duchess were to cease to undertake royal duties as representatives of the Queen and would therefore no longer receive the relevant financial support.[126] The couple would retain their HRH styles but not use them.[126] The formal role of the Duke and Duchess was subject to a twelve-month review period, ending in March 2021. Meghan's final public solo engagement as a senior royal was a visit to Robert Clack School on March 7, 2020, in Dagenham ahead of International Women's Day.[127] She and Harry attended the Commonwealth Day service at Westminster Abbey on March 9, 2020, which was their last engagement as a couple before they officially stepped down on March 31.

The collection sought to help \"unemployed and disadvantaged women\", through selling items \"on a one-for-one basis, meaning an item is donated for each item purchased\".[209] Taking advantage of the \"Meghan Markle effect\" (driving consumer purchases), in 10 days the collection provided a year's worth of clothes for the charity.[210] In February 2018, Markle and fiancé Harry attended the first annual forum of The Royal Foundation.[211] After marriage, Meghan became the foundation's fourth patron alongside Prince Harry, Prince William and his wife, Catherine.[212] In May 2019, as a part of their Heads Together initiative, the Duchess of Sussex together with her husband and in-laws launched Shout, a text messaging service for those who suffer from mental issues.[213] In June 2019, it was announced that Harry and Meghan would split from the charity and establish their own foundation. Nevertheless, the couples would collaborate on mutual projects, such as the mental health initiative Heads Together.[214][215] The following month, \"Sussex Royal The Foundation of The Duke and Duchess of Sussex\" was registered in England and Wales.[216] However, it was confirmed on February 21, 2020, that \"Sussex Royal\" would not be used as a brand name for the couple, following their step back from official life as working royals.[217] On August 5, 2020, the Sussex Royal Foundation was renamed \"MWX Foundation\" and dissolved the same day.[218] In March 2021, it was reported that the Charity Commission for England and Wales was conducting a review of the Sussex Royal organization in a \"regulatory and compliance case\" regarding its conduct under charity law during dissolution.[219] Representatives for the couple claimed that Sussex Royal was \"managed by a board of trustees\" and that \"suggestion of mismanagement\" directed exclusively at the Duke and Duchess would be incorrect.[219] The commission later concluded that the foundation did not act unlawfully, but criticized the board of directors for expending a \"substantial proportion of funds\" to setting up and closing the charity.[220][221] In April 2020, Meghan and Harry confirmed that an alternative foundation (in lieu of Sussex Royal) would be called \"Archewell\".[222] The name stems from the Greek word \"arche\", which means \"source of action\"—the same word that inspired the name of their son.[222] Archewell was registered in the United States.[223] Its website was officially launched in October 2020.[224] Between 2010 and 2012, Markle anonymously ran the blog The Working Actress, which detailed the \"pitfalls and triumphs of struggling to make it in Hollywood\".[225] In 2014, she founded her own lifestyle blog The Tig, which posted articles about food, fashion, beauty, travel, and inspirational women.[226] The viewing audience consisted primarily of the fans of Markle and Suits. Promotion of the blog on other social media platforms targeted three million followers on Instagram, 800,000 on Facebook and 350,000 on Twitter.[227] In April 2017, The Tig closed. In January 2018, she took all articles offline and deleted her social media accounts.[227] It is estimated that Markle's social media activities annually earned her about $80,000 from endorsements and sponsorships.[42] She rejoined Instagram in January 2025.[228] She was also known for socializing at Soho House.[229] Markle became known through The Tig for her fashion sense,[45] releasing two fashion collections with Canadian clothing company Reitmans in 2015 and 2016.[227] The lines were based on her personal style and that of her Suits character.[45] Markle has cited Emmanuelle Alt as her style inspiration.[230][231] In 2016, she hosted USA Network's video series Power Lunch with Meghan Markle in collaboration with Lexus and Eater, discussing the culinary inspirations of five different New York kitchens.[232] In 2015, Markle visited Malta after discovering an ancestor had been born there. Her trip was documented by Elle UK.[233][234] She was featured in the cover story for the October 2017 issue of Vanity Fair and the December 2017 issue of Elle France.[235][236] Shortly after her engagement to Prince Harry in 2017, she caused a surge of interest in Scottish retailer Strathberry after carrying one of its handbags to a public event.[237][238] This was reported as an indication that her fashion choices would produce results similar to the Kate Middleton effect.[237][239] After Markle and Prince Harry's first appearance as a couple, brands Mackage, Birks, R&R Jewelers, Crown Jewelers, and Everlane noted an upswing in their website hits and sales.[240][241][238] It was speculated that Markle's effect would be broader internationally because she already had a strong American appeal.[239] Consequently, the United States saw a boost in yellow gold jewelry sales in the first quarter of 2018.[242] In 2018, Tatler included Meghan with other senior royal women on its list of Britain's best dressed people.[243] Following the announcement of her pregnancy, she appeared in a Karen Gee dress that resulted in the Australian designer's website crashing.[244] Fashion website Net-a-Porter ranked Meghan as one of the best dressed women in 2018.[245] She was nominated for the 2018 Teen Choice Awards in the category Choice Style Icon.[246] In 2019, British brand Reiss reported a growth in profits after Meghan was seen wearing a mini dress by them on International Women's Day.[247] In 2022, the black Armani dress worn by Meghan during her Oprah interview was selected by the Fashion Museum, Bath, as Dress of the Year 2021.[248] In the same year, she was featured in the cover story for the 2022 Fall Fashion issue of The Cut.[249] There was controversy over her claim in the interview that she had been told at the premiere of The Lion King that her marriage resulted in rejoicing in South Africa similar to that seen at Nelson Mandela's release from prison in 1990.[250] In 2018, Time selected Meghan as one of the 100 Most Influential People in the World[251] and placed her on its shortlist for Person of the Year.[252] Her name appeared again on the listicle in 2021, and she and her husband were featured on one of the magazine's seven worldwide covers.[253] In 2019, the magazine named Meghan and Prince Harry among the 25 Most Influential People on the Internet.[254] She was also chosen as one of the 25 most influential women in the United Kingdom by British Vogue magazine in 2018, 2019 and 2021.[255][256][257] Her influence was also recognized in both the 2019 and 2020 editions of Powerlist, the 100 most influential Britons of African and Afro-Caribbean descent.[258] In 2022, she was named as one of the 50 Women Changing the World over the past year by Worth magazine.[259] In the same year, Variety named her as a stellar honoree for its Power of Women issue,[260][261] and Financial Times included her on its list of \"25 most influential women of 2022\".[262] In December 2022, Meghan was found to be the second most disliked member of the British royal family by statistics and polling company YouGov, behind her husband's uncle Prince Andrew.[263] In March 2023, The Independent included her on its \"Influence List 2023\".[264] Meghan and Harry's exit from the royal family was satirized in a 2023 episode of South Park.[265] In the same year, James Hibberd of The Hollywood Reporter named Meghan and Harry among the Hollywood losers of 2023.[266] Following Meghan and Harry's trip to Nigeria in May 2024, Lucia Stein of the ABC argued that the couple could have been used by the royal family, and added that \"perhaps how helpful they would have been\" had an agreement on a \"hybrid working model\" been achieved.[267] Among other things, she noted Meghan's style and meetings were extensively covered internationally. Media editor, Tina Brown commented in relation to the visit, they are \"enormously appealing to the public, and very good at [public engagement].\"[267] Brown later criticized Meghan's activities arguing that she had \"the worst judgement of anyone in the entire world\" and \"her issue is that she doesn't listen... She does what she wants to do.\"[268] In November 2016, the MailOnline was criticized for running an article on Markle's family background titled \"(Almost) Straight Outta Compton\", which triggered a response from Prince Harry's Communications Secretary.[15] In October 2019, Meghan filed a lawsuit against Associated Newspapers Limited (ANL), the publisher of The Mail on Sunday and MailOnline over the publication of a letter she had sent to her father.[269][270] Thomas Markle Sr. had provided the publisher with excerpts of the letter after five of his daughter's friends, including Abigail Spencer,[271] referenced it in a People article.[4][272][273] She subsequently received support from more than 70 female MPs from different parties who in an open letter condemned the use of \"outdated, colonial undertones\" against her in some national media outlets.[274] In May 2020, the court dismissed claims of the tabloid's alleged dishonesty and malice, as they were deemed either vague or irrelevant to the case.[275] In February 2021, the High Court of Justice found in a summary judgment that ANL's Mail on Sunday had invaded Meghan's privacy by publishing the letter,[276] and she won her claim for \"misuse of private information and copyright infringement\" in May 2021.[277] She was given a £450,000 down payment on her £1.5 million legal fees as an interim payment, and pursuant to copyright law, her legal team asked for a front-page statement by The Mail on Sunday and MailOnline to acknowledge her legal victory.[278] The Court of Appeal granted ANL permission to appeal against the ruling.[279] The appeal was subsequently launched by ANL in November 2021.[280] Meghan and Harry's former communications secretary Jason Knauf—who had previously denied co-authoring the letter with Meghan[281]—gave a statement to the court of appeal, mentioning that Meghan gave him briefing points to share with Finding Freedom's authors Omid Scobie and Carolyn Durand and that Prince Harry welcomed the suggestion that they should conceal their involvement, while they both discussed the book \"on a routine basis\".[282] ANL had previously applied to use the book in their defense.[283][284] Knauf also revealed that Meghan wondered whether she should refer to her father as \"daddy\" in the letter, as she believed \"in the unfortunate event that it leaked, it would pull at the heartstrings\".[282] Meghan subsequently apologized to the court for not remembering the emails earlier, adding that the \"extent of the information\" Knauf shared with the book's authors was \"unknown\" to her.[285] She also stated in her witness statement that she was \"unable to retrieve any text messages with Mr Knauf\" due to \"an automatic deletion system\" that had been installed on her devices in 2016 for security reasons.[286] In December 2021, three senior appeal judges upheld the judgement of the High Court against ANL, prompting Meghan to call for reform of the tabloid industry.[287] In the same month, ANL's The Mail on Sunday and MailOnline published a front-page statement on Boxing Day acknowledging Meghan's victory, adding that there had been an agreement on \"financial remedies\".[288] In addition to covering a portion of Meghan's legal costs, the outlet agreed to pay her £1 in damages for invading her privacy and a confidential sum for infringing her copyright.[289] They were also banned from naming Meghan's friends, who had spoken to People magazine about the letter in 2018.[289] In November 2016, The Sun ran the headline \"Harry girl's on Pornhub\".[57] The outlet denied any smear after it was revealed that the clips were illegally uploaded scenes from the TV series Suits and not pornographic material.[57] They subsequently apologized via an official statement in February 2017.[290] In February 2018, a letter containing white powder and a racist note addressing Markle was sent to St James's Palace, triggering counter-terrorism and hate crime investigations by Scotland Yard.[291] Meghan and Harry obtained a formal apology in May 2019 from Splash News for privacy invasion at their Cotswolds residence.[292][293] In December 2019, PA Media retracted the publishing of a Christmas card photograph of Meghan, Harry, and their son Archie. The agency said that the photo was retracted because they had been advised that the photograph was \"not representative of the Christmas card sent by the Duke and Duchess of Sussex\".[294] The couple had a legal warning issued to the press in general in January 2020 after the publication of paparazzi photographs.[295] In March 2020, the couple took Splash UK to court after Meghan and her son were photographed without permission in Canada during a \"private family outing\". The case was settled later that year with Splash UK agreeing to no longer take unauthorized photos of the family.[296] The Duke and Duchess announced in April that they would no longer cooperate with the Daily Mail, The Sun, Daily Mirror and Daily Express.[297] They won an apology in October from American news agency X17 for taking photographs of their son at their home using drones.[298] In March 2021, ITV News reported Meghan had complained directly to ITV's CEO about Piers Morgan's comments on mental health following her interview with Oprah Winfrey.[299] Ofcom received over 57,000 complaints about the program including one from the Duchess of Sussex.[300][301] In the same month, it was reported that an American private investigator unlawfully handed over personal details about Meghan to The Sun, including her Social Security number, cell phone number and address, when she first started dating Prince Harry in 2016. Meghan and her husband condemned the \"predatory practices\" of the British tabloids, while The Sun stated that the investigator \"was instructed clearly in writing to act lawfully\", and they did not \"use the information he provided for any unlawful practice\".[302] In July 2021, Meghan filed legal complaints against The Times for two separate articles, with the first one covering an unproven allegation from Robert Lacey's book that she had left an engagement in Fiji for not being appointed by UN Women as a goodwill ambassador and the second one claiming that the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge had refused to talk to Prince Harry after Prince Philip's funeral due to fears of a potential leak.[303][304] In January 2022, the couple jointly filed a legal complaint against The Times for an article reporting on Archewell raising less than $50,000 in 2020.[305] In the same month, she complained to the BBC regarding their five-part podcast Harry, Meghan and the Media, in which the presenter Amol Rajan stated that Meghan had \"apologized for misleading\" the Court of Appeal in her case against the Mail on Sunday.[306][307] The BBC responded by issuing a statement on its \"corrections and clarifications\" website to emphasize that she had \"apologized to the court for not remembering email exchanges\".[307] In March 2022, Meghan's half-sister, Samantha Markle, filed a defamation lawsuit against her in Florida, accusing her of lying in the Oprah interview and disseminating false statements via her communications secretary for the book Finding Freedom and sought damages in excess of $75,000.[308][309] In June 2022, Meghan's initial motion to dismiss the case was rejected by a judge following amendments made by Samantha in her complaint.[310] She filed a second motion in the same month.[310][311] In addition to applying for the case to be dismissed, Meghan's lawyer also applied for the discovery process to be delayed, pending the outcome of the dismissal application.[312] A Florida judge later denied the application to halt the discovery process,[313] but dismissed the lawsuit in March 2023.[314] In April 2023, Samantha refiled the lawsuit with another amended complaint that covered statements made by Meghan in her Netflix docuseries as well.[315] The lawsuit was later dismissed with prejudice in March 2024, after a judge ruled that the claimant was unable to provide evidence of defamation.[316] Samantha later appealed the decision.[317] Between December 2022 and January 2023, more than 25,000 complaints were submitted to the Independent Press Standards Organisation (IPSO) about a column by Jeremy Clarkson in The Sun,[318] in which he stated that he hated Meghan \"on a cellular level\" and dreamed \"of the day when she is made to parade naked through the streets of every town in Britain while the crowds chant, 'Shame!' and throw lumps of excrement at her.\"[319] On December 20, 2022, Conservative MP Caroline Nokes wrote to The Sun's editor, Victoria Newton, calling for \"action [to be] taken\" against Clarkson. The letter was signed by more than 60 cross-party MPs.[320] On December 23, The Sun issued an apology, stating \"columnists' opinions are their own\" but they \"regret the publication of this article\" and are \"sincerely sorry\".[321] On the following day, a spokesperson for the Duke and Duchess of Sussex described the apology as \"nothing more than a PR stunt\".[322] Clarkson said his column was a reference to a scene from the television series Game of Thrones and he later revealed that he had emailed Meghan and Harry on Christmas Day 2022 to apologise.[318][323] A spokesperson for the couple said Clarkson wrote solely to Harry and the article was not an isolated incident.[318] In February 2023, IPSO announced that it was launching an investigation about the article.[324] In June 2023, IPSO concluded that the column was sexist and contained a \"pejorative and prejudicial reference\" to Meghan's sex, but it rejected complaints that the piece raised an issue of fact, or was meant to harass her or included discriminatory references on the grounds of race.[325] In 2021, shortly before Meghan and Harry were due to be interviewed by Oprah Winfrey, Valentine Low reported in The Times that Meghan's former communications secretary, Jason Knauf, complained in October 2018 that her conduct at Kensington Palace had caused two personal assistants to quit and had undermined the confidence of a third employee,[326] prompting an investigation by Buckingham Palace into the bullying allegations.[327][328] The palace hired an external law firm to examine the claims, with ten aides reported to have cooperated with the review.[329][330] Criticism of Meghan for twice wearing earrings gifted from Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman in 2018, after he was accused of complicity in the assassination of Jamal Khashoggi, appeared at the same time.[331][326][332] Her representatives denied her awareness of the accusations against Mohammed bin Salman and said The Times were being used by Buckingham Palace for \"a smear campaign\" against her.[333][326] The television special Oprah with Meghan and Harry was broadcast on CBS on March 7, 2021.[334] Meghan spoke about her personal and royal life and public pressure. She claimed to have been contemplating suicide during her time as a working royal and complained of a lack of protection for her and her son while being part of the royal institution.[335] There was a wide and polarized reaction to the interview.[336] In an updated epilogue for the couple's unauthorized biography, Finding Freedom by Omid Scobie and Carolyn Durand, the authors claimed that \"two of the individuals mentioned in [Knauf's] email asked for any allegations made to HR about their experiences with Meghan to be rescinded\".[337] Speaking on behalf of the Duchess in a BBC documentary, Jenny Afia, a lawyer who represented Meghan in her case against ANL, stated that the bullying allegations were \"just not true\".[338] In June 2022, The Times reported that the results from the inquiry made Buckingham Palace modify some of the policies and procedures in its HR department, but the report would not be published to ensure the privacy of those who took part in it.[339] In September 2024 The Hollywood Reporter reported on complaints raised by American staff members about Meghan's behavior. Her spokesperson declined to comment.[340] In March 2019, European consulting firm 89up reported on their discovery of 1,103 highly connected Twitter accounts with more than two and a half million tweets in favor of Meghan, most of which appeared to be bots carrying out \"coordinated attacks\" on royal correspondents who had reported negatively on her.[341][342] In the same year, CNN had reported on research by Hope not Hate, stating that out of 5,200 \"abusive tweets directed at Meghan\" in January and February 2019, 3,600 came from a small group of trolls.[341] In March 2019, the royal family introduced new rules for followers commenting on its official social media accounts in response to the online abuse aimed at Meghan and her sister-in-law Catherine.[343] In October 2021, Twitter analytics service Bot Sentinel released their analysis of more than 114,000 tweets about the Duke and Duchess of Sussex, as a result of which they found 83 accounts with a combined number of 187,631 followers that were possibly responsible for approximately 70% of the negative content posted about the couple.[344][345][346] The report prompted an investigation by Twitter.[344] The company stated that it found no evidence of \"widespread coordination\" between the accounts and said that it had taken action against users who violated Twitter's conduct policy.[344] Bot Sentinel released three more reports in the following months, arguing that the accounts were part of a \"bot network\" and a similar network could be found on YouTube.[347][348][349] In January 2022, the BBC named Meghan and Harry among people whose photos and videos were used in fake instant profits advertisements and bitcoin-related investment schemes.[350] Among theories widespread on social media, including Twitter and YouTube, were unfounded assertions that Meghan had faked her pregnancies, instead using surrogate mother(s), or that her children do not exist at all.[351][352][353] Meghan's half-sister, Samantha, was reported to have run multiple Twitter accounts that targeted Meghan.[354][355] Meghan became a princess of the United Kingdom upon her marriage to Prince Harry, entitled to the style of Royal Highness.[356] After her marriage, she was styled \"Her Royal Highness The Duchess of Sussex\". She also holds the titles of Countess of Dumbarton and Baroness Kilkeel.[357] She is the first person to hold the title \"Duchess of Sussex\".[358][359] Following the Duke and Duchess's decision to step back from royal duties in 2020, the couple agreed not to use the style of Royal Highness in practice, but they are still referred to as \"His/Her Royal Highness\" in legal settings.[360][361][362][363] During Meghan's trip to Nigeria in May 2024, Igwe Alfred Achebe, the Obi of Onitsha, and Oba Abdulrosheed Akanbi, the Oluwo of Iwo, gave her the chieftaincy titles Ada Mazi (transl. 'the daughter of the Igbo ancestral palace') and Adetokunbo (transl. 'royalty from across the seas').[131]",

                "content": "Our editors will review what you’ve submitted and determine whether to revise the article. Meghan, duchess of Sussex (born August 4, 1981, Los Angeles, California, U.S.) is an American British actress and consort (2018– ) of Prince Harry, duke of Sussex and fifth in line to the British throne. Markle was born to Doria Ragland, an African American former television studio intern who later became a social worker and yoga instructor, and her husband, Thomas Markle, a lighting director who was white; the couple met on the set of the soap opera General Hospital. Markle’s parents divorced when she was a young child, but both remained active in her life. In 1995 she had an uncredited role in the sitcom Married…with Children, for which her father served as director of lighting and of photography. After graduating from Immaculate Heart High School, an all-girls Roman Catholic school, in 1999, Markle studied theatre and international studies at Northwestern University in Evanston, Illinois (B.A., 2003). Markle then returned to Los Angeles to embark on an acting career. She quickly began landing guest roles in TV shows, including CSI: NY, 90210, CSI: Miami, and Fringe, and she supplemented her income working as a freelance calligrapher. Her big break came when she was cast as paralegal Rachel Zane in the popular USA Network legal drama series Suits (2011–19). She also played leading roles in such movies as Random Encounters (2013) and Anti-Social (2015). In addition, she ran a lifestyle blog, The Tig (2014–17). Markle, who had briefly been married (2011–13) to producer Trevor Engelson, was introduced to Prince Harry by a mutual friend in 2016; Harry is the younger of the two sons of Prince Charles (later Charles III) and Princess Diana; his older brother is Prince William. An early date was a camping trip to Botswana. The tabloid press quickly discovered the relationship, and its coverage of the couple was seen by many as salacious and often insulting and racist. Late in 2016 Harry made the relationship public while berating the British press for its treatment of Markle. The couple’s engagement was announced in November 2017. The wedding took place at Windsor Castle on May 19, 2018, and Meghan was given the title duchess of Sussex. Their first child, Archie Harrison Mountbatten-Windsor, was born on May 6, 2019. Though Meghan was often praised for her open and relaxed demeanour, the couple continued to be bedeviled by the tabloid press. In addition, a rift between Harry and Meghan and the other royals began to appear. In January 2020 the couple announced that they would retreat from their royal duties and planned to become financially independent of the royal family. It was later announced that they would, as of March 31, no longer be “working members” of the royal family. The couple subsequently relocated to Los Angeles, where they continued to support various charities. In addition, Meghan publicly discussed politics and personal subjects that were considered unsuitable topics for members of the royal family. Notably, in 2020 she revealed that she had experienced a miscarriage. On June 4, 2021, she gave birth to a daughter, Lilibet (“Lili”) Diana Mountbatten-Windsor; the name honoured both Harry’s mother and his grandmother Elizabeth II, whose nickname was Lilibet. Shortly thereafter Meghan released the children’s book The Bench, about a father-son relationship. In 2022 she began hosting the podcast Archetypes, which sought to “investigate the labels that try to hold women back.” In September 2022 Elizabeth II died, and Meghan and Harry were prominent at various events, including the funeral. In addition, they made a joint appearance with William and his wife, Princess Catherine, at Windsor Castle, despite an alleged rift between the brothers. Later that year the highly anticipated docuseries Harry & Meghan aired on Netflix. A candid look at their relationship, it chronicled the couple’s courtship, marriage, and decision to step back from their royal duties. The docuseries also highlighted Harry and Meghan’s struggles with the news media.",

Markle was born at West Park Hospital in Canoga Park, Los Angeles, California. She grew up in the View Park-Windsor Hills and Hollywood neighborhoods of Los Angeles County. Her father is of a Dutch and Irish background and her mother is African American. She was married to producer Trevor Engelson from 2011 to 2013. Starting her acting career in 2011, she played Rachel Zane in the legal drama series Suits. She had the role of Amy Jessup in the Fox science fiction-drama Fringe. Markle began dating Prince Harry of Wales in June 2016. They became engaged in November 2017.[1] In preparation for the wedding, the Archbishop of Canterbury, Justin Welby, baptised Markle and confirmed her into the Church of England on March 6, 2018. The couple married at St George's Chapel, Windsor Castle on May 19, 2018.[2] After their wedding, they became the Duke and Duchess of Sussex. In October 2018, it was announced that the Duchess was pregnant with the couple's first child.[3] The baby, Archie Harrison Mountbatten-Windsor, was born on May 6, 2019.[4] In January 2020, Meghan and Harry announced that they would no longer take on royal duties and were stepping down from their roles. In November 2020, the Duchess revealed in an opinion piece for The New York Times that she suffered a miscarriage in July of that year.[5] In March 2021, Meghan and Harry were interviewed by Oprah Winfrey about their struggles of being in the royal family. This interview was controversial because the couple spoke about their mistreatment by certain members of the family (who were not named) and by people working for the monarchy. On 4 June 2021, the couple's daughter Lilibet Diana Mountbatten-Windsor was born in Santa Barbara, California.[6] Harry and Meghan have also made a television series named Harry & Meghan which documented their time in the royal family.",

                "title": "Cybertruck driver had likely self-inflicted gunshot wound to the head, sheriff says : NPR",
                "content": "By NPR Washington Desk Fire vehicles surround the valet area where a Tesla Cybertruck caught fire at the Trump International Hotel in Las Vegas on Jan. 1. David Becker for the Washington Post/Getty Images hide caption Authorities have identified the driver of the Cybertruck that exploded in front of the Trump hotel in Las Vegas as 37-year-old Master Sgt. Matthew Alan Livelsberger. In a news briefing Thursday afternoon, police say they still don't have 100 percent confirmation because he was \"burned beyond recognition\" in the Jan. 1 blast. They're awaiting DNA tests to confirm his identity. Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Sheriff Kevin McMahill says Livelsberger sustained a gunshot wound to the head prior to the Cybertuck detonating; investigators believe it was self inflicted. Officials found several items in the vehicle including multiple firearms, fireworks, a military ID, an iPhone and several credit cards. The FBI and local law enforcement officials are still looking for a motive. Livelsberger was an active-duty Special Operations soldier with the U.S. Army. Officials noted similarities with 42-year-old Shamsud-Din Jabbar, the man who drove a pickup truck onto the sidewalk in New Orleans, killing at least 14 and injuring dozens more on New Year's Day. McMahill said both men served at Fort Bragg in North Carolina, though there's no indication they served in the same unit. They also both served in Afghanistan in 2009, and they both used the rental car app Turo to rent the vehicles used in these attacks. McMahill said details on additional parallels are unknown. Law enforcement and intelligence officials are investigating any potential connection between the two incidents. Livelsberger served in the active-duty Army from January 2006 to March 2011. He then joined the National Guard from March 2011 to July 2012, followed by the Army Reserve from July 2012 to December 2012. U.S. Army Special Operations Command confirmed that Livelsberger was on approved leave at the time of his death. On Wednesday, Las Vegas police said that crews pulled gasoline canisters, camp fuel canisters and large firework mortars from the back of the Cybertruck. The explosion, which was caught on video, also injured seven people. Police said the Cybertruck was rented in Colorado. Authorities were able to trace the vehicle through Tesla charging stations to see that it arrived in Las Vegas about an hour before the explosion. Authorities called the incident \"isolated.\" Jeremy Schwartz, acting special agent in charge of the FBI in Las Vegas, said the agency was working closely with area law enforcement to learn more about the explosion. The FBI's Joint Terrorism Task Force was working to determine whether the explosion was an act of terrorism. A source familiar with Livelsberger's background who was not authorized to speak publicly on the matter tells NPR's Tom Bowman that Livelsberger was deployed five times to Afghanistan on combat missions. He had not been deployed for the past 12 months. Livelsberger was awarded a Bronze Star for valor, an Army commendation for valor, as well as a combat infantry badge, the source said. The Jan. 1 truck attack in New Orleans killed at least 14 people, not 15 as a previous version of this story said. Sponsor Message Become an NPR sponsor",

                "content": "Profile Sections Local tv Featured More From NBC Follow NBC News news Alerts There are no new alerts at this time Authorities said Thursday that their investigation into an explosion that rattled the Trump Hotel in Las Vegas and killed one person had narrowed in on a decorated U.S. Army soldier, but that key details including a motive for the incident remained elusive. At a news conference, officials said that identification belonging to the soldier, Matthew Alan Livelsberger, was found at the scene, where a Tesla Cybertruck burst into flames after an improvised explosive was detonated in the truck's bed. Livelsberger had rented the Cybertruck through the online platform Turo. Before the news conference, two senior law enforcement officials told NBC News that it was Livelsberger who had died. Clark County/Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Sheriff Kevin McMahill acknowledged speculation on social media surrounding Livelsberger, 37, a master sergeant in the U.S. Army’s elite special forces unit and resident of Colorado Springs, but said there was no immediate indication that he was working as part of a larger operation. “We don’t believe there’s any further threat or anyone associated with him in Las Vegas,” McMahill told reporters. Authorities said a military ID, a passport and credit cards found at the scene were in Livelsberger's name, but that the body in the Cybertruck was “burned beyond recognition.” Investigators are still awaiting DNA or medical record confirmation of the body’s identity, but had other evidence indicating Livelsberger had died, including tattoos on the body’s stomach and arms. Authorities also recovered two handguns, including a .50-caliber Desert Eagle and a semiautomatic pistol. The body recovered from the Cybertruck sustained an apparent self-inflicted gunshot wound to the head, McMahill said, adding that one of the weapons was found at the body's feet. The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives said the guns were traced back to Livelsberger, who lawfully purchased them on Dec. 30. ATF officials said they are still investigating the explosive device and sifting through debris, but the components appear to include consumer-grade fireworks, mortars and aerial shells. The incident was being investigated as a possible terrorist attack, three senior law enforcement members said Wednesday. Spencer Evans, a special agent in charge of the FBI's Las Vegas field office, said Thursday that officials have been vetting tips, one of which was \"alluding to this person's experiences related to his time in the military.\" An Army spokesperson said Livelsberger was assigned to the U.S. Army Special Operations Command and on approved leave from his base in Germany. He first entered the Army in 2006, re-entered active duty in December 2012 and was a Green Beret candidate after serving in the National Guard and the Army Reserve. Earlier Thursday, federal law enforcement agents began searching a residence in Colorado Springs connected with the case and were expected to be on-site for several hours, the agency said in a statement. “This activity is related to the explosion in Las Vegas,” the FBI said on X, declining to provide further details. The blast in Las Vegas came just hours after a driver plowed a pickup truck into New Year's Eve revelers on Bourbon Street in New Orleans, killing at least 14 and injuring more than 30 others before being shot dead by police. A flag of the Islamic State terrorist group was found in the back of the pickup truck. The driver in New Orleans was identified Wednesday as a U.S. Army veteran from Texas, and officials said they believe he acted alone. Livelsberger's long military career included deployments to the Republic of Congo in 2014, Ukraine in 2016, Tajikistan in 2016 and Afghanistan in 2017, 2018 and 2019. “The military gave him several honors, including multiple Bronze Star medals, at least one with valor, meaning he saw combat and was considered to have served with valor or individual merit.” Officials said Wednesday that the pickup truck and the Tesla in the Las Vegas explosion were rented from the same company, Turo. The company said in a statement it is assisting investigators. “We do not believe that either renter involved in the Las Vegas and New Orleans attacks had a criminal background that would have identified them as a security threat,” the statement said. Federal officials also said Thursday they had not found any association between the two events. \"At this point, there is no definitive link between the attack here in New Orleans and the one in Las Vegas,\" Chris Raia, the deputy assistant director of the FBI’s counterterrorism division, told reporters during a news conference updating on the investigation into the New Orleans attack. Still, the fact that the incidents in New Orleans and Las Vegas came just hours apart and both appeared to involve military members with somewhat similar backgrounds has been noted by officials. \"If these turn out to be similarities, very strange similarities to have,\" McMahill said. Authorities said Livelsberger rented the Tesla in Denver three days after Christmas and charged the electric vehicle near Colorado Springs on Monday. He charged it again in towns along Interstate 40 in New Mexico and Arizona before arriving in Las Vegas early Wednesday. The Cybertruck ignited within 17 seconds of arriving at the valet at the Trump International Hotel, McMahill said. The explosion was reported at about 8:40 a.m. local time; seven bystanders were hurt, but their injuries were considered minor. In videos circulating online, sirens can be heard in the Trump International Hotel lobby as the vehicle just outside the doors is engulfed in flames. A person on social media said they were near the front door when the vehicle exploded and they were forced to leave their luggage by the door. Other posts showed smoke filling the air around the building and first responders racing to the scene. McMahill said Tesla CEO Elon Musk helped to track the route of the vehicle and provided video showing the Cybertruck at Tesla charging stations. Musk, who is also a part of President-elect Donald Trump's inner circle, said on X that the vehicle itself did not cause the explosion. \"We have now confirmed that the explosion was caused by very large fireworks and/or a bomb carried in the bed of the rented Cybertruck and is unrelated to the vehicle itself,\" Musk wrote. \"All vehicle telemetry was positive at the time of the explosion.\" Trump's son Eric Trump thanked local law enforcement for their \"swift response.\" \"The safety and well-being of our guests and staff remain our top priority,\" Eric Trump said in a statement.

We'll send your free family report and tips to find out more The lion symbol represents the ferocious nature of family members, their bravery and valor. It is one of the oldest symbols in heraldry and is considered to be one of the most desirable to have on a coat of arms. The 'bordure' edge around the shield is a mark of difference used to identify separate families that hold similar coat of arms designs. It is one that became a distinctive mark of pride over time for those families that used one. The black color (known as Sable) symbolizes constancy and the enduring nature of the family. It is a symbol of family longevity through time. The red color (known as Gules) traditionally symbolized martyrdom and the historic military strength of family members when called upon in times of war. Skattebo is a surname of Norwegian origin, possibly derived from geographic features or historical references in Norway. The name may indicate a connection to specific locations or a heritage linked to farming or land ownership, reflecting the family’s roots in Scandinavian culture. Family crests and coats of arms emerged during the Middle Ages, mostly in wider Europe. They were used as a way to identify knights and nobles on the battlefield and in tournaments. The designs were unique to each family and were passed down from generation to generation. The earliest crests were simple designs, such as a single animal or symbol, but they became more elaborate over time. Coats of arms were also developed, which included a shield with the family crest, as well as other symbols and colors that represented the family's history and achievements. The use of family crests and coats of arms spread throughout Europe and became a symbol of social status and identity. They were often displayed on clothing, armor, and flags, and were used to mark the family's property and possessions. Today, family crests and coats of arms are still used as a way to honor and celebrate family heritage. Variations of the family name Skattebo can be intriguing, reflecting linguistic shifts and cultural adaptations across different countries. In the 17th century, the name saw variations like Skatteberg in Sweden, which emerged through the phonetic blending of regional dialects. As the 18th century progressed, migration patterns led to the variation Skattaboe in the Netherlands, where the double vowel was influenced by Dutch phonetics. Meanwhile, in the early 19th century, the name evolved into Skatibo in parts of Eastern Europe, showcasing Slavic suffixes that adapted the original structure. By the late 19th century, in America, the name transformed into Skattybo, often influenced by a desire for simplicity and ease of pronunciation among English speakers. Each variation tells a story of cultural exchange, phonetic evolution, and the adaptability of family identities through time and geography. Learn how to find your family crest.

                "content": "Watch CBS News By Christina Fan Updated on: January 2, 2025 / 6:35 PM EST / CBS New York NEW YORK - Police are searching for four suspects after they opened fire into a crowd of 15 people standing outside an event space in Jamaica, Queens. Ten teenagers were hurt in the shooting, which happened just after 11:15 p.m. on New Year's Day outside the Amazura Concert Hall on 144th Place. \"Last night in Queens, a memorial for a teen lost to gun violence turned to horror when gunmen opened fire on the crowd, including several young people who are now hospitalized. This cannot be our normal. We are working with authorities to bring the perpetrators to justice,\" Gov. Kathy Hochul said. Police said about 90 people were inside the address for a private event. Police sources told CBS News New York they were attending a vigil for 16-year-old Taearion Mungo, who was shot and killed last October. Sources said his mother booked the hall for what would have been his birthday. While the concert hall called it an isolated incident, police sources said officers have been called to the location for previous incidents. Sources also said the shooting appears to be gang-related. The venue was at capacity, and a line of about 15 people were waiting outside. Law enforcement sources say they were waiting to get into a celebration of life ceremony. Police said that's when four men walking down 91st Avenue approached the crowd and fired about 30 shots. They then ran toward 143rd Place, where they got in a light colored sedan with a New Jersey license plate, according to police. Surveillance video shows four people running toward the venue, and then - less than 20 seconds later - it appears the same four can be seen running away. \"Zero tolerance for these senseless shooting, these horrible acts of violence on our streets. And those responsible for this crime will be apprehended,\" NYPD Chief of Patrol Philip Rivera. Neighbors said it was so loud they thought people were celebrating the holiday. \"A lot of noise, like big fireworks,\" one person said. \"We thought people were celebrating the Happy New Year,\" said another. \"We are deeply saddened by the recent and unfortunate isolated incident that occurred. Our hearts go out to all those affected by this senseless act. We are working closely with law enforcement to ensure a thorough investigation and to help bring those responsible to justice,\" Amazura Concert Hall said in a statement on social media. The street was crowded with ambulances waiting to rush the victims to local hospitals. They range in age from 16 to 19 years old and are all expected to survive their injuries. \"Officers responded to the multiple 911 calls and found a total of 10 victims -- six females, four males -- who were taken to area hospitals. All of the victims are expected to recover with non-life-threatening injuries,\" Rivera said. Six of the victims were taken to the Jamaica Hospital Trauma Center with injuries ranging from gunshot wounds to the leg, foot, arm and buttocks, to graze wounds to the back. The other four are being treated at New York-Presbyterian Queens, Long Island Jewish Medical Center and Cohen Children's Medical Center. Police said they were also actively canvassing local medical centers for any unaccounted for gunshot victims related to this incident. Queens Borough President Donovan Richards Jr. called the shooting a \"life-changing ordeal\" and shared his thoughts for those impacted. \"Ten families woke up this morning to some of the most devastating news one could imagine receiving — their loved one had been shot. My thoughts are with the victims and all those impacted as they navigate this life-changing ordeal, and I'm relieved that seemingly no lives will be lost due to this despicable shooting,\" Richards said in a statement. \"I have been in constant communication with law enforcement, and while it does not appear this incident has a Queens nexus, under no circumstance will we allow any example of gun violence in our borough to go unpunished. I'm confident that those who perpetrated this heinous act will be arrested and held accountable for their actions.\" Investigators noted the public has been instrumental in helping them solve high-profile crimes in recent weeks, and they hope the public will once again help them catch the suspects in this case. Anyone with information about the shooting is asked to call the NYPD's Crime Stoppers hotline at 1-800-577-TIPS (8477) or 1-888-57-PISTA (74782) for Spanish. You can also submit a tip via their website. All calls are kept confidential. Allen Devlin and John Dias contributed to this report.

                "content": "JAMAICA, Queens (WABC) -- An active investigation is underway Thursday as police work to track down three to four men who shot at a crowd of people in Queens, leaving 10 teenagers injured. It happened outside of the Amazura nightclub on 144th Place around 11:30 p.m. A private event was taking place at the space with about 90 people inside when bullets started flying. Eyewitness News has learned the gathering was to celebrate the birthday and life of Taearion Mungo, a 16-year-old fatally shot in Fort Greene, Brooklyn, last Oct. 26. He would have turned 17 on Wednesday. Among the panicked crowd were six women and four men between the ages of 16-20 who were injured in the gunfire. All victims were taken to area hospitals for treatment. The NYPD said it was a dangerous scene as about 30 shots were fired before the suspects got away in a gray Infiniti Q50 with a red interior and New Jersey plates. The car was last seen on the Van Wyck Expressway. \"Four males walked towards the venue, three to four males began firing over 30 times in the direction of the people outside the venue hitting multiple victims,\" said NYPD Chief of Patrol Philip Rivera. \"There is zero tolerance for these senseless shootings, these acts of violence. Those responsible will be brought to justice.\" Meanwhile, NYC Mayor Eric Adams issued his own statement about the shooting on social media, saying in part that there is \"no room for this criminal behavior in our city.\" Police say this was not an act of terror and they are investigating whether the mass shooting might be gang-related. All of the injured victims are expected to survive. Amazura released a statement that they are working with police to find those responsible: \"We are deeply saddened by the recent and unfortunate isolated incident that occurred. Our hearts go out to all those affected by this senseless act. We are working closely with law enforcement to ensure a thorough investigation and to help bring those responsible to justice.\" ----------* More Queens news* Send us a news tip* Download the abc7NY app for breaking news alerts * Follow us on YouTube Have a breaking news tip or an idea for a story we should cover?

Nearby residents described quick bursts of gunfire along with screaming. “It was bam, bam, bam, bam,” Maria Lopez told The New York Times. “I thought it was fireworks. I was saying to myself, it’s too late in the evening for this, too late for it to be New Year’s celebrations.” About 90 people were inside the club while a smaller group of about 15 were standing outside, police said. “It lasted about 10 seconds and then there was silence,” neighborhood resident Juan Alulema told the New York Post. “I saw people screaming.” Amazura Concert Hall urged the public to contact police with any information about the shooting. “We are deeply saddened by the recent and unfortunate isolated incident that occurred,\" the venue said in an Instagram post. “Our hearts go out to all those affected by this senseless act.”",

                "content": "Jocelyn Alice Wildenstein (née Jocelyne Périsset; 5 August 1940 – 31 December 2024) was a Swiss socialite[1] known for her extensive cosmetic surgery, which created a cat-like facial appearance; her 1999 high-profile divorce from billionaire art dealer and businessman Alec Wildenstein;[2][3] and her extravagant lifestyle and subsequent bankruptcy filing. Jocelyn Alice Wildenstein[4] was born as Jocelyne Périsset in Lausanne, Switzerland, on 5 August 1940.[5][6] Her father Armand Périsset worked in a sporting goods store and her mother Liliane Périsset was a housewife.[5] She began dating Swiss Cyril Piguet, producer of the 1964 film Un commerce tranquille, at the age of 17.[7] She later lived in Paris with Italian French filmmaker Sergio Gobbi.[8] While there, she became a skilled hunter and pilot.[1] Périsset was introduced to Alec N. Wildenstein, of the wealthy family of renowned art dealers,[9] by Saudi arms dealer Adnan Khashoggi at a shooting weekend at the Wildenstein African ranch \"Ol Jogi\" in 1977.[10][6] Périsset and Wildenstein eloped to Las Vegas on 30 April 1978[6] and had two children together.[11] The Wildensteins' divorce in 1999[2][10] was not amicable.[12] Jocelyn walked in on her husband and a 21-year-old Russian model in her bedroom at the Wildenstein New York City home, and he threatened Jocelyn with a gun.[13][14] This resulted in a night in jail for Alec Wildenstein.[14] The presiding judge, Marilyn Diamond, received death threats in the mail during the proceedings.[15] During her divorce, the judge stipulated that she could not use any alimony payments for further cosmetic surgery.[16] Jocelyn enlisted the services of Ed Rollins[8][17] for public-relations assistance and at various times both Bernard Clair[8][18] and Kenneth Godt[19] for legal counsel. Wildenstein began dating fashion designer Lloyd Klein in 2003.[20] Wildenstein had extensive cosmetic surgeries to her face.[21] Her cat-like appearance[22] led media outlets to nickname her \"Catwoman\", \"The Lion Queen\", and \"The Bride of Wildenstein\".[23] She denied having excessive plastic surgery, citing her Swiss heritage,[22] but admitted to a multimillion dollar surgery to make her eyes more cat-like,[24] which she did with her husband.[6] According to Alec Wildenstein, \"She was thinking that she could fix her face like a piece of furniture. Skin does not work that way, but she wouldn't listen\".[6] Wildenstein was known for having lived her life in an extravagant manner. She once calculated her yearly telephone bill at $60,000 and food and wine costs at $547,000.[9] Wildenstein received $2.5 billion in her divorce settlement (although this amount has been rumored to be as high as $3.8 billion[25]) and $100 million each year for the following 13 years.[26] The judge stipulated that she could not use any alimony payments for further cosmetic surgery.[16] Following her divorce, Wildenstein sold the marital home in New York City to real estate developer Janna Bullock for $13 million.[27] In 2018, Wildenstein filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection, claiming she had $0 in her bank account and listing various tangible assets of $16.39 million against $6.38 million in liabilities.[28] In 2020, her three apartments in Trump Tower were repossessed. Wildenstein told The Times in 2023 that she attributed her financial difficulties to problems with the trust set up following her divorce, and that in 2015, the family of Alec Wildenstein had cut her off from payments.[29] Wildenstein died from a pulmonary embolism at a hotel in Paris, on 31 December 2024, at the age of 84.[30][31]",

                "content": "Jocelyn Wildenstein, the Swiss-born socialite famous for the surgery-enhanced feline features that earned her nicknames in the American press like \"Catwoman\" and the \"Bride of Wildenstein,\" has died. Her partner Lloyd Klein told AFP she died of a pulmonary embolism in Paris. Wildenstein, who sometimes spelled her name \"Jocelyne,\" was a staple of New York tabloids for much of her adult life, due to her tempestuous love life, drastically changing appearance and the hefty payout she received in her divorce from an art world bigwig (though she eventually claimed she'd gone bankrupt, having depleted her billions). Wildenstein often downplayed the extent of her cosmetic procedures, claiming the \"cat eyes\" she was so infamous for were a family trait, or that different hairstyles changed the way she looked. Occasionally, though, she gave a winking tidbit to journalists who, well, needled her about her procedures. \"If you feel good with your imperfections, with your aging, then you should do nothing,\" she reportedly told photographer Zed Nelson in 2006. \"Otherwise, it's all about choosing the right doctor.\" Jocelyn Périsset (her maiden name) spent her early life in Lausanne, Switzerland. (Her birthday had proved hard to track down, as she gave reporters different dates. Klein told AFP that she died at age 79, while other outlets reported that she was 84 at the time of her death.) As a child, she spent her time swimming in lakes or skiing on nearby mountains. Her father inspired in her an early love of African mammals, she told Interview magazine in 2023. She traded Lausanne for Paris in her early 20s, dancing at discos and hobnobbing with well-to-do fellow expats, but she held onto that childhood dream of traveling to Africa. She made several trips to the continent before eventually meeting the billionaire art dealer Alec Wildenstein on a Kenyan safari in 1977. Alec told Vanity Fair in 1998 that he'd been asked to kill a lion on a neighbor's land, and his future wife tagged along. The pair married the following year, and the new Mrs. Wildenstein gained a new residence: Ol Jogi, the massive ranch her husband's family owned in Kenya — her favorite of several new international homes. Her love affair with African big cats continued shortly thereafter on a grander scale — as did her much-reported proclivity for exorbitant spending. After inheriting Ol Jogi through marriage, she installed a bulletproof enclosure for two tigers, a fitting addition to a property that reportedly included 200 buildings staffed by over 300 servants. She told Vanity Fair she and her then-husband spent about $1 million a month. For Wildenstein, a couture Chanel gown costing $350,000 was worth the price. Her most enduring project was her face. Wildenstein underwent extensive cosmetic surgery in her lifetime, starting about a year into her marriage to Alec, though she long denied it. The two first sought \"his-and-hers eye-lifts,\" as described pithily in a 1998 Vanity Fair feature, but Wildenstein went further. Throughout most of her adult life, the outer corners of Wildenstein's eyes slanted up towards her temples, resembling the felines she so admired; her skin was pulled so taut and her cheeks sat so high on her face that it was free of wrinkles well into her 70s. Wildenstein's marriage had soured by 1998 when she claimed she discovered her husband in bed with another woman. Alec was charged with menacing his wife after she said he pointed a loaded pistol as she walked in on the scene in their New York mansion, which they shared with other members of the Wildenstein family. After a contentious trial, Alec was ordered to pay Wildenstein $2.5 billion in a divorce settlement — and $100 million each year for 13 years. He later died in 2008. Wildenstein's next most public relationship was with Lloyd Klein, a French designer nearly three decades her junior. They met at New York Fashion Week in 2003 and instantly connected over a mutual love of extravagant style, he told People in 2016. Their relationship, however, was often tumultuous: Wildenstein was arrested twice, in 2016 and 2017, for fighting with her beau at one of their residences in Trump World Tower in New York, and at one point the two took out restraining order against each other. Klein told People that some of their fights were brought on by Wildenstein's stress about her \"financial duress.\" Despite her massive divorce settlement in 1999, Wildenstein filed for bankruptcy in 2018. She told British newspaper The Times that she was still \"broke\" in late 2023. After years of avoiding the public eye save for her appearances at her beau's runway presentations, a decision she said she made to keep her two children, born during her marriage to Alec, out of the press, Wildenstein returned to the spotlight in her later life. Her otherworldly features, which tabloids once snarked over, were celebrated by stylish outlets like Paper and Interview, for which she posed for grand photoshoots. That she maintained her gaudy glamor (and continued unwillingness to cop to plastic surgery) amid her bankruptcy made her a campy icon of sorts, one even imitated in the front row at haute couture fashion week. And yet, for all the time she spent in Page Six and other tabloids, much of Wildenstein's life remains a mystery or myth: her true age, the origins of her feline looks, where all her money really went. She'd promised to tell more of her story in an HBO series that she claimed would air in 2023, but the project has yet to materialize. Still, the way Wildenstein looked at it, she didn't mind if people misunderstood her. \"I have nothing to prove,\" she told Paper in 2018. \"In the end, I don't care.\" Hearst Television participates in various affiliate marketing programs, which means we may get paid commissions on editorially chosen products purchased through our links to retailer sites.",

                "content": "Known as ‘one of the jet set’s most outrageous characters’, Wildenstein died in Paris hotel aged 84 The Swiss socialite and cosmetic surgery aficionado Jocelyne Wildenstein, sometimes known as “Catwoman” due to her extensive plastic surgery, has died, her partner said on Wednesday. “It is with heavy heart and with great sadness that Mr Lloyd Klein announces the unexpected death of his beloved fiancée and longtime companion, Jocelyne Wildenstein,” the fashion designer said in an English-language statement sent to the Agence France-Presse news agency. Klein said that “Mrs Wildenstein died peacefully in her sleep in the late afternoon of December 31st, 2024 in her … suite in Paris where the couple had taken temporary residence.” Wildenstein, nee Jocelynnys Dayannys da Silva Bezerra Périsset, became a New York socialite after marrying the art dealer Alec Wildenstein, of the French art dealing and thoroughbred racing dynasty, with whom she had two children. She was referred to variously as Jocelyne and Jocelyn in the English-language media. She was born in 1940 in Lausanne, Switzerland, and died on 31 December at the age of 84. It was Wildenstein’s extensive self-remodeling to make herself look more “feline”, inspired by wild big cats – along with a reported $2.5bn divorce settlement and $100m each year for 13 years afterward – that caught the public’s attention. She had spent time in Africa with the European film-maker Sergio Gobbi , telling New York magazine: “Africa is a paradise. You meet people who look at life differently. They love the adventure.” She had met her husband, Alec Wildenstein, while on safari in Kenya and married him a year later in Las Vegas. Then Wildenstein embarked on a cosmetic adventure to look more like a big cat. According to the Daily Mail, she spent £2m on surgeries, apparently to please her husband, who loved the big cats. She kept a lynx as a pet, telling Vanity Fair “the lynx has perfect eyes”. But her husband told Vanity Fair: “She was crazy. I would always find out last. She was thinking that she could fix her face like a piece of furniture. Skin does not work that way. But she wouldn’t listen.” But a messy divorce came with rumours spread by her ex-husband that she had been a courtesan with Madame Claude, the Parisian bordello owner. During the divorce, he was reported to have cut her monthly allowance from $150,000 to $50,000. A judge overseeing her divorce settlement reportedly stipulated that she could not use any of the settlement for further surgery. “I never wanted to change my face,” she told the French television news channel C8 this autumn, though admitting she might have wanted her lips to be a little thicker. She denied rumours she embarked on cosmetic surgery to keep her ex-husband. Interview magazine last remarked that Wildenstein had “been one of the jet set’s most outrageous characters for nearly five decades”. In a conversation with the outlet, Wildenstein estimated that she spent more than $700,000 a year on food, wine, flowers, pills and more, adding “and that was just the beginning”. Where some saw extremism, others saw beauty. “I remember seeing you once at Beige [a legendary Tuesday-night party at the Bowery Bar and Grill in New York City]. It was burned into my brain forever because the glamour was turned up so high,” wrote the editor and interviewer Mel Ottenberg. Ottenberg asked Wildenstein about her love of big cats. She explained there were 2,000 animals at Ol Jogi [the Wildenstein family ranch in Kenya] under protection. “We have everything except lions, because they would kill what we are trying to protect,” she said. Asked for her favourite animal, she said she liked all animals, but settled on the leopard, saying it was because they become attached to only one person. “Leopards are jealous,” she said. Wildenstein said that huge press attention based on her appearance had usefully kept her in the public eye during her divorce. “Journalists can say whatever they like … it’s really not my problem.” AFP contributed reporting",

Much talk had taken place between both schools ahead of the matchup, setting the tune for a heated game. After the dominant victory at The Horseshoe, Buckeyes quarterback Will Howard posted on social media, sending a very strong statement to Tennessee. Will Howard has become one of the biggest trash-talkers in the country. The star QB in Columbus is not afraid to taunt opponents, and so far he’s been able to walk the talk (except for The Game against Michigan). When Ohio State defeated Indiana, earlier on the season, Howard mocked the Hoosiers by ‘putting out a cigarette’. Leading up to the Tennessee-Ohio State matchup, almost everyone in the NCAA shared their opinions on the SEC and Big Ten Conferences, debating which was superior. The Buckeyes, however, delivered a dominant performance at home, handing the Vols a resounding defeat. Howard didn’t let the chatter go unnoticed, delivering a blunt statement through a social media post. “When people ask you what happened here, tell them the North remembers,” Will Howard posted, along with pictures of the Buckeyes-Volunteers game. “Tell them Winter came for the Volunteers. See y’all in Pasadena.” Will Howard #18 of the Ohio State Buckeyes reacts prior to a game against the Penn State Nittany Lions at Beaver Stadium on November 02, 2024 in State College, Pennsylvania. Howard’s impersonation of Arya Stark’s cold-blooded speech from Game of Thrones put a definitive full stop to the recent heated rivalry between the Buckeyes and Vols. It served as a fitting, cinematic ending to one of the most anticipated matchups in college football this season. see also Buckeyes HC Ryan Day reveals the key to Will Howard's standout performance against Tennessee With their big win over Tennessee, the Buckeyes sent the Volunteers packing back to Knoxville. As for Ryan Day’s squad, Ohio State advanced to the CFP quarterfinal at the Rose Bowl, where they will face the No. 1 Oregon Ducks on New Year’s Day for a spot in the semifinal. Oregon and Ohio State will meet again after their nail-biter classic earlier this season. The Buckeyes are hungry for revenge after the narrow 32-31 defeat during their visit to Eugene. Will Howard played, arguably, his best game of the year against Oregon. He finished the night with 28 completions for 326 yards and 2 touchdown passes. Will Howard #18 of the Ohio State Buckeyes celebrates after a touchdown against the Tennessee Volunteers during the third quarter in the Playoff First Round Game at Ohio Stadium on December 21, 2024 in Columbus, Ohio. Day and the Buckeyes offense are hoping for a similar outing when both schools clash in Pasadena. Moreover, Howard is ecstatic for the chance to face Oregon and earn a shot at redemption on a bigger stage. see also Buckeyes QB Will Howard sends strong warning to Dan Lanning's Ducks ahead of the Rose Bowl “Yeah, I’m excited, man,” Howard stated. “It’s going to be a heck of an opportunity for all of us. We’ve all been looking forward to this one and for another crack at [those] guys. The way that last one ended doesn’t sit right with me. It still bugs me.” It’s going to be a spectacle for sure. It doesn’t get any bigger than a New Year’s Day matchup at the Rose Bowl in Pasadena. The Big Ten powerhouses will clash, with only one emerging to head to the CFP semifinal at the Cotton Bowl, where they’ll face the winner of the Texas-Arizona State game.

Early in the fourth quarter, Cade Cunningham missed a 3-pointer and both Ivey and Magic guard Cole Anthony chased after the loose ball.

Ivey's left foot and ankle got trapped under Anthony's body, while his lower leg and knee bent awkwardly from the force of the collision. Ivey crashed to the floor and screamed in pain. He was soon surrounded by medical personnel, who worked quickly to stabilize his leg. Once that was complete, he was loaded onto a stretcher and wheeled off the court. An emotional Anthony watched on along with players and coaches from both teams. \"It's tough. It's tough on all of us,\" Pistons coach J.B.

In Year 3, Ivey is averaging 17.6 points, 4.1 rebounds and 4.0 assists and shooting 40.9% from 3-point range. Save for assists, all of those numbers are career highs. After a frustrating sophomore season under Monty Williams, Ivey has had a breakout campaign with Bickerstaff in charge.

He was playing well tonight and unfortunately, that happened. We're all just praying for him.\" The injury comes as Ivey was finding his groove in the Motor City following two inconsistent years to open his NBA career. Through 30 games, he was averaging 17.6 points, 4.1 rebounds and 4.0 assists, and he was setting personal bests in field-goal percentage (46.0) and three-point percentage (40.9). His development was a hugely positive sign for the Pistons, whose 15 wins already exceed their total from all of last year. It's unclear how much time the 22-year-old will miss, but it's safe to assume he'll be out for most or all of what's left in the regular season. The focus for he and the Pistons will be on working toward his return in 2025-26. Ivey has a $10.1 million club option before he's eligible for restricted free agency in 2026.",

                "content": "The Cotton Bowl is an outdoor stadium in Dallas, Texas, United States. Opened in 1930 as Fair Park Stadium, it is on the site of the State Fair of Texas, known as Fair Park. The Cotton Bowl was the longtime home of the annual college football post-season bowl game known as the Cotton Bowl Classic, after which the stadium is named. Starting on New Year's Day 1937, it hosted the first 73 editions of the game, through January 2009; the game was moved to AT&T Stadium in Arlington in January 2010. The stadium hosts the Red River Rivalry, the annual college football game between the Oklahoma Sooners and the Texas Longhorns, and formerly, the First Responder Bowl. The stadium has been home to many football teams over the years, including: SMU Mustangs (NCAA), Dallas Cowboys (NFL; 1960–1971), Dallas Texans (NFL) (1952), Dallas Texans (AFL; 1960–1962), and soccer teams, the Dallas Tornado (NASL; 1967–1968), FC Dallas (MLS; as the Dallas Burn 1996–2004, as FC Dallas 2005), and Dallas Trinity FC (USLS; 2024-). It was also one of the nine venues used for the 1994 FIFA World Cup. As of 2022, it is the largest stadium by capacity in the United States without a professional or college team as a regular tenant. It became known as \"The House That Doak Built,\" due to the immense crowds that SMU running back Doak Walker drew to the stadium during his college career in the late 1940s.[7] In their seventh season, the Cowboys hosted the Green Bay Packers for the NFL championship at the Cotton Bowl on January 1, 1967.[8][9] The college bowl game that year included SMU and was played the day before, New Year's Eve, which required a quick turnaround to transform the field.[10] The two games were filled to its 75,504 capacity, but both home teams lost to the visitors. Artificial turf was installed in 1970 and removed in 1993 in preparation for the 1994 FIFA World Cup. The elevation of the playing field is approximately 450 feet (140 m) above sea level. Construction began on Fair Park Stadium in 1930 on the same site as the wooden football stadium before known as Fair Park Stadium. Completed that year, the first game in the stadium was between Dallas-area high schools in October 1930. The original stadium–the lower half of the current facility–was built for a cost of $328,000 and seated 45,507 spectators. The name was officially changed to the Cotton Bowl in 1936. In 1948, a second deck was added to the west side, increasing capacity to 67,000. The east side was double-decked the following year, increasing capacity to 75,504. These decks were added to respond to the demand for fans to watch SMU halfback Doak Walker, leading the Cotton Bowl to be known as \"the house that Doak built.\" The superstructure was also built at this time, creating the distinctive facade for the stadium. In 1968, chair-backs were installed, reducing capacity to 72,032. In 1970, the Cotton Bowl installed an AstroTurf surface, which remained until 1993. In 1950, as a way to break the Texas League record for opening-day attendance, Richard Burnett got permission to play in the Cotton Bowl, which at the time could hold as many as 75,000. In order to draw a big crowd, he wanted a lineup of former stars to don Dallas Eagles uniforms and face one Tulsa hitter in the top of the first inning. Most of the retired stars were cool to the idea, except for then-current Dallas Eagles manager Charlie Grimm. When the legendary Ty Cobb agreed to come to Dallas, the others followed his lead. Preceding the game was a parade through downtown Dallas. \"It was the pre-game show that got 'em\", bellowed Dizzy Dean by way of self-congratulation. \"Cobb, Cochrane, Home Run Baker, Speaker, and Ol' Diz in Dallas duds.\" The 54,151 who showed up were lucky enough to see Ty Cobb hit several balls into the stands, just to show he could still handle the bat. The Kilgore College Rangerettes drill team performed on the field prior to the game. Texas governor Allan Shivers threw out the first pitch. Defensively, the old-timer lineup of the Eagles were: Duffy Lewis in left field, Cobb in center field, Texas native Tris Speaker in right field, Frank \"Home Run\" Baker at third base, Travis Jackson at shortstop, Charlie Gehringer at second base, manager Grimm at first base, Mickey Cochrane at catcher, and former Houston Buffaloes star pitcher Dizzy Dean on the mound. Dean walked the leadoff batter for Tulsa, Harry Donabedian, on a 3–2 count, and then the regular Dallas players took the field. Dean got into an orchestrated rhubarb and was tossed from the game. The attendance figure still stands as the largest in Texas League history and second largest in the history of the minor leagues. The Cotton Bowl hosted six matches of the 1994 World Cup. To meet FIFA requirements for these games the stadium field was widened, the press box was enlarged and natural grass was re-installed. The playing surface has remained natural grass ever since. Capacity was decreased to 71,615 in 1994 and to 68,252 in 1996.[11] The Stadium also hosted the Gold Cup Soccer Matches in 1993. In the 2000s (decade), the renewed dominance of both the Oklahoma Sooners and the Texas Longhorns created a new interest in their rivalry, and the stadium. Temporary stands were erected in each end zone to increase seating for these games from just over 68,000 to 90,000. In November 2006, the city of Dallas and the State Fair of Texas finally agreed on funding for a long-planned[12] $50 million renovation, with $30 million of this amount from a city bond.[13] Thus, in April 2007, the schools signed a contract to play at the Cotton Bowl through 2015, coupled with a $57 million fund for upgrades and improvements to the aging stadium.[14] The 2008 Red River Showdown was held on October 11. The 2008 renovations include the expansion of the seating capacity of the stadium from 68,252 to 92,100,[2] mostly through the complete encircling of the second deck, new media and VIP facilities, a new scoreboard and video screen, updated restrooms and concession areas, lighting, utility and sound upgrades and the replacement of all the stadium's seats. A new record for attendance was set when 96,009 fans attended the 2009 Texas vs. Oklahoma football game. The renovation was also intended to increase the chances of the Cotton Bowl Classic becoming a part of the Bowl Championship Series. However, the renovation was not enough to prevent the Cotton Bowl Classic from moving out of its namesake stadium after the 2009 game. Dallas' occasionally cold January weather had been a longstanding concern for the game, and was believed to have precluded any prospect of adding it to the BCS even after the expansion. (The Cotton Bowl Classic would eventually be added to the \"New Year's Six\" College Football Playoff bowls after the game moved to what is now AT&T Stadium.) [15] On January 1, 2020, the NHL Winter Classic was held at the Cotton Bowl. Over 85,000 attended the match between the Dallas Stars and Nashville Predators. On December 6, 2023, it was announced the Red River Rivalry would stay in the Cotton Bowl through 2036. It was also announced with the single largest investment into the stadium from the city of Dallas with an estimated $140 million two-year renovation.[16] The Cotton Bowl has been used by a number of teams in several sports throughout its history, and has hosted three collegiate bowl games. The Cotton Bowl has also hosted large music concerts, including the inaugural Texxas Jam and other similar events. From 1937 to 2009, the Cotton Bowl hosted the Cotton Bowl Classic, an annual NCAA Division I bowl game. Beginning in 2010, the bowl game has been played at AT&T Stadium in Arlington. From 1941 to 1994, the Southwest Conference champion would play in the bowl game; since 1997, the first postseason of the Big 12 Conference, its second-place team has competed against an SEC team in the Cotton Bowl Classic. The first professional football team in Texas was the Dallas Texans of the National Football League in 1952. Plagued by financial hardship and poor play, the Texans lasted only one season. The team played four games in the Cotton Bowl before going bankrupt, being taken over by the league, and finishing the season as a traveling team based in Hershey, Pennsylvania. The Dallas Cowboys called the Cotton Bowl home for 12 seasons, from the team's formation in 1960 until 1971. The 1966 NFL Championship Game between the Cowboys and Green Bay Packers was played in the Cotton Bowl. After playing their first two home games in 1971 at the Cotton Bowl, the Cowboys opened Texas Stadium in Irving on October 24. The Dallas Texans of the American Football League used the stadium all three of their seasons in Dallas (1960–1962), sharing it with the NFL Cowboys. Following the Texans' 1962 AFL Championship season, owner Lamar Hunt moved the franchise to Kansas City, Missouri and renamed it the Chiefs. From January 2011 until 2018, the Cotton Bowl was the home of the First Responder Bowl, an annual college football bowl game. The game was tentatively named the \"Dallas Football Classic\" prior to TicketCity being announced as the bowl game's first title sponsor. The game was called the \"TicketCity Bowl\" for the first two match ups. On October 4, 2012, the name changed again to the \"Heart of Dallas Bowl\" for eight seasons before changing to the \"First Responder Bowl\" for the 2018 season. In 2019 the game was relocated to Gerald J. Ford Stadium at Southern Methodist University in University Park, Texas, to accommodate the 2020 NHL Winter Classic.[17] While originally a temporary measure, the game has remained at Ford Stadium in succeeding years. The game has had bowl tie-ins with the Big 12 Conference in 2011, Conference USA in 2012, and the Big Ten Conference in both 2011 and 2012. The inaugural game saw the Texas Tech Red Raiders defeat the Northwestern Wildcats, 45–38. The annual college football game between the University of Texas and the University of Oklahoma Sooners, also known before 2005 as the Red River Shootout, is played at the Cotton Bowl during the State Fair of Texas, instead of on either school's campus. Ticket sales are equally divided between the two schools, and the fans are split on the 50-yard line. Following the 2023 game, the Longhorns have a record of 63–51–5 against the Sooners.[18] The Cotton Bowl served as the home for the SMU Mustangs football team for two periods in the program's history. SMU played at least a few games at the Cotton Bowl from 1932 onward. They gradually moved more of their home games there during the 1930s and 1940s, as it was double the size of their on-campus stadium, Ownby Stadium. The Mustangs moved there permanently in 1948 due to Doak Walker's popularity. The Mustangs played at the Cotton Bowl until 1978, when they moved to Texas Stadium. The Cotton Bowl also served as home to SMU in the 1990s, after the team served the NCAA death penalty due to numerous recruiting violations, and spent the first six years after their return at Ownby Stadium. Games moved back to campus in 2000 with the completion of Gerald J. Ford Stadium. In addition to the Red River Rivalry, the Grambling State University Tigers and the Prairie View A&M University Panthers play each other at the Cotton Bowl in the State Fair Classic. This game often occurs the weekend before the Texas-OU Red River Rivalry game. It is a neutral site for both teams; Grambling State is located in northern Louisiana and Prairie View A&M is located about 30 miles (48 km) northwest of Houston. The halftime show, the \"Battle of the Bands\", is arguably more eagerly anticipated than the game itself. The State Fair Classic is heavily marketed in the Dallas – Fort Worth Metroplex, with local hip hop stations encouraging a large turnout among the region's African-American community. The State Fair Classic is currently the largest FCS football game in Texas. In 2016, the Texas State Fair in conjunction with the City of Dallas announced an expansion of games played during the state fair for 2018 and 2019. Following the Red River Rivalry weekend, the Texas Southern University Tigers played against the Southern University Jaguars. The game was on a neutral site for both teams, Texas Southern University is centrally located in Houston and Southern University is located in Baton Rouge, Louisiana (South Louisiana). The two schools are long-time SWAC rivals and have nationally recognized marching bands.[19] The Cotton Bowl has a long history of hosting Texas high school football games. From the early days of the stadium, it was used for playoff and championship games. In 1945 and 1967, the stadium hosted two of the largest audiences to ever see a Texas high school football game.[20] In 2011 and 2012, it played host to the North Texas Football Classic to kick off those seasons. Blondes vs. Brunettes powderpuff football games are played in cities across the United States.[21] Proceeds from the event are donated to The Alzheimer's Association. The annual contests were started by Sara Allen Abbott whose father, Texas State Representative Joseph Hugh Allen, died of Alzheimer's disease in 2008. Looking for a way to raise funds for The Alzheimer's Association, Abbott organized a powderpuff football game in tribute to her father, a lifelong football fan.[22] The games are currently played in over 20 cities throughout the United States. The increasing popularity of the game in the Dallas area resulted in moving the 2012 game to the Cotton Bowl where it could accommodate a larger crowd.[23] On July 29, 2014, the Cotton Bowl hosted a soccer match between Real Madrid and A.S. Roma which was part of the 2014 International Champions Cup and AS Roma won the match 1–0.[24] It also hosted 6 matches of the 1994 FIFA World Cup. Early in their existence, the Dallas Tornado played two seasons of professional soccer in the Cotton Bowl. They spent their inaugural year, 1967, as a franchise of the United Soccer Association and 1968 as members of the North American Soccer League in the Cotton Bowl. For the Tornado, a wider field was installed that required several storm drains to be moved.[25][26] The team moved to P.C. Cobb Stadium for the 1969 season and played at four more venues in the Dallas area before they folded after the 1981 season.[27] The Dallas Burn, a founding member of Major League Soccer (MLS), played at the Cotton Bowl for their first seven seasons between 1996 and 2002.[28] Their first match, played in front of 27,779 spectators on April 14, 1996, was a 1–0 win against the San Jose Clash.[29] The Burn paid $15,000 per match at the Cotton Bowl and lacked control over scheduling and concession sales;[28] the team drew an average attendance of roughly 12,000 to 15,000 until they moved in 2003 to Dragon Stadium in Southlake, Texas.[30][31] The Burn (later renamed FC Dallas) returned to the Cotton Bowl for the 2004 and 2005 seasons while preparing to open their own stadium in Frisco.[32] Their final regular season match at the Cotton Bowl was a 2–2 draw with the San Jose Earthquakes on July 3, 2005.[33] FC Dallas later returned to the Cotton Bowl for a doubleheader with a Mexico–Colombia international friendly on September 30, 2009.[34] The event drew 51,012 spectators to the stadium.[35] FC Dallas would not return to the Cotton Bowl until 2024 when they played a preseason friendly against Inter Miami CF, whose popularity had surged following the signing of Lionel Messi. Dallas Trinity FC, a women's professional soccer team and founding member of the USL Super League, currently plays at the Cotton Bowl. Their first home game was an exhibition match against FC Barcelona Femení on August 30, 2024, followed by their home season opener against DC Power FC on September 7, 2024.[36] The 2020 NHL Winter Classic was held at the Cotton Bowl on January 1, 2020. The game was hosted by the Dallas Stars against the Nashville Predators; the Dallas Stars won.[37] It was the first Winter Classic appearance for both teams.[38] It also marked the first outdoor NHL game to be hosted in a southern state. The Stars defeated the Predators in a 4–2 comeback victory. Recorded attendance was 85,630, the second highest ever for an NHL game.[39] The stadium has also been a venue for a number of historic concerts, most notably that which featured then 21-year-old Elvis Presley, which took place on October 11, 1956, and attracted what was then the largest audience in Texas history for an outdoor concert, in excess of 27,000. Many consecutive summers of huge concerts, featuring several artists, began in July 1978, with the 1st annual Texxas Jam, which sold out with over 80,000 attendees. For crowd control purposes, ticket sales for any future Cotton Bowl General Admission floor seating was limited, and Jams following the 1978 Jam, never reached 80,000 for that reason. Each Texxas Jam had a unique lineup of major artists chosen by the promoter. Over the years, the Texxas Jam featured some of the top-billed headliner artists of the day, including Aerosmith, Heart, Deep Purple, Boston, Journey, Ted Nugent, Scorpions, Loverboy, Cheap Trick, Van Halen, Blue Öyster Cult, Sammy Hagar, Nazareth, Styx, Foghat, Santana, The Eagles & Triumph, among others. The annual events came to an end in the summer of 1988, when Van Halen headlined the \"Monsters Of Rock\" Tour. U2 played here during the first leg of the Popmart Tour Since then, the stadium has continued to be used as a major concert venue; Eric Clapton held his first three-day Crossroads Guitar Festival there in 2004. South Korean boy band BTS was set to perform at the stadium on May 9–10, 2020 as part of their Map of the Soul Tour; however, the shows were canceled due to the COVID-19 pandemic.[40][41] The Rolling Stones have played 7 shows at the Cotton Bowl July 6, 1975, October 31, 1981, November 1, 1981, November 10, 1989, November 11, 1989, November 18, 1994, and November 2, 2021. The Cotton Bowl hosted both the 1971 VFW National Championships and the 1991 Drum Corps International World Championships. †= Team's stadium under construction or refurbishment at time 1 = A team used the stadium when their permanent stadium was unable to be used as a result of damage.",

                "content": "The Cotton Bowl Classic (also known as the Cotton Bowl) is an American college football bowl game that has been held annually in the Dallas–Fort Worth metroplex since January 1, 1937. The game was originally played at its namesake stadium in Dallas before moving to Cowboys Stadium (now AT&T Stadium) in nearby Arlington in 2010.[1] Since 2014, the game has been sponsored by the Goodyear Tire and Rubber Company and officially known as the Goodyear Cotton Bowl Classic; it was previously sponsored by Mobil (1989–1995) and Southwestern Bell Corporation/SBC Communications/AT&T (1997–2014). Historically, the game hosted the champion of the Southwest Conference (SWC) against a team invited from elsewhere in the country, frequently a major independent or a runner-up from the Southeastern Conference (SEC). Following the dissolution of the SWC in 1996, the game hosted a runner-up from the Big 12 Conference, facing an SEC team from 1999 to 2014. The Cotton Bowl Classic has served as one of six bowls in the College Football Playoff (CFP) since the 2014 season; it hosted a national semifinal following the 2015, 2018 and 2021 seasons. With the expansion of the College Football Playoff to 12 teams in 2024, the Cotton Bowl Classic will become an annual feature of that playoff, along with the other New Year's Six bowls. Traditional conference tie-ins prior to 2024 will still try to be respected for the 2024 and 2025 seasons but are no longer obligated to be met.[2] The winner of the Cotton Bowl is awarded the Field Scovell Trophy. The Cotton Bowl Classic was founded in Dallas in 1937 at the Texas State Fair Grounds, when Texas oil executive J. Curtis Sanford financed the first bowl game. Texas Christian and star quarterback Sammy Baugh took on Marquette, winning 16–6, but the game lost money even though some 17,000 attended. Nonetheless, Sanford persevered, and in 1938 the game made a profit as Rice defeated Byron White's Colorado 28–14 in front of a crowd of 37,000. Some 40,000 attended the 1939 match between Saint Mary's College of California and Texas Tech, with the Gaels upsetting the undefeated Red Raiders 20–13. In 1940, an underdog Clemson team surprised the Boston College Eagles 6–3, in the first and only appearance at the Cotton Bowl Classic by Tigers coach Frank Howard. Attendance at this game was given as 20,000. Later that year, a group of prominent Dallas citizens took over the staging of the game as the Cotton Bowl Athletic Association. A few months later, the CBAA became an agency of the Southwest Conference. From 1941 to 1994, the SWC's champion hosted the Cotton Bowl Classic. In 1943, The Texas Longhorns represented the SWC in their first ever bowl game against a highly ranked Georgia Tech team at the time. Prior to the game, sportswriters boasted that Texas did not belong in the same league as Georgia Tech. Texas proved the public wrong by defeating the Yellow Jackets 14–7 in what was mostly a defensive battle. This Cotton Bowl was the first bowl appearance for Texas as the Longhorns would go on to appear in a record 22 Cotton Bowls, the most of any team. In 1946, Missouri was defeated by Texas, despite the 4th quarter work of freshman fullback Robert (Bob) Lee Clodfelter, who was to mature under Weeb Ewbank at Washington University in St. Louis the next three years. In 1947 LSU and Arkansas played in front of 38,000 people to a scoreless tie in what would later become known as the \"Ice Bowl.\" LSU got the better of Arkansas most of the game, but the game truly belonged to the weatherman. In 1948 Penn State, in a bowl game for the first time in 25 years, played Dallas' SMU to a 13–13 tie. Because none of the Dallas hotels would provide accommodations for the two African-American members of the Penn State team, the Penn State team ended up staying at a Naval Air Station 14 miles from Dallas. This was the first interracial game played at the Cotton Bowl Stadium.[3] The 1953 Cotton Bowl would be a rematch of the 1951 bowl game as Texas and Tennessee played for the second time. Texas defensive stars shut out the Vols 16–0 as the Longhorns avenged the previous meeting when Tennessee beat Texas 20–14. The 1954 Cotton Bowl Classic featured one of the most famous plays in college football history. Rice's Dickey Moegle (last name spelling later changed to \"Maegle\") began a run around end from his team's 5-yard line and down the open field. Alabama's Tommy Lewis jumped off the bench and tackled Moegle. The referee, Cliff Shaw, saw what happened and signaled touchdown even though Moegle was \"tackled\" at the 42-yard line. The 1957 Classic matched the TCU Horned Frogs against the Jim Brown-led Syracuse Orangemen. Brown rushed for 135 yards, scored three touchdowns and kicked three extra points but a fourth-quarter blocked extra point by TCU's Chico Mendoza proved the margin of victory as TCU won, 28–27. TCU QB Chuck Curtis passed for 174 yards, threw for two touchdowns and rushed for another to lead the Frogs. In 1960, Syracuse defeated Texas 23–14 to win the national championship. Syracuse was led by bowl MVP Ernie Davis, who ran for one touchdown, caught a Cotton Bowl Classic record 87-yard touchdown, and intercepted a pass leading to a third touchdown. There was a brawl on the field just before the end of the first half; some said it was because of Texas taking cheap shots at Ernie Davis.[4] The University of Texas president Logan Wilson called for an NCAA hearing on the fight after the game. Syracuse Athletic Director Lew Andreas asserted that no one from his university had accused Texas of dirty play, and attributed those claims to members of the media.[5] The issue was dropped shortly thereafter. In 1961, Davis became the first black athlete to win the Heisman Trophy, but died of leukemia before his pro career could begin. Duke defeated Arkansas 7–6 in the 1961 game. Duke scored with 2:45 remaining and recovered a fumble on the ensuing series to win the game. In 1962, Texas would again be selected to play in the Cotton Bowl after winning another SWC crown. This time the Longhorns faced a highly talented Mississippi Rebels team. The game was a low scoring meeting that came down to the final quarter as Texas won 12–7. The 1963 game featured the returning Texas Longhorns and the LSU Tigers, who, like Mississippi, were from the SEC. Lynn Amedee's 23-yard field goal gave the Tigers a 3–0 halftime lead after Texas had missed their own which led to an 80-yard drive. This was the first field goal in the Classic since 1942. Amedee recovered a Longhorn fumble at the 37 early in the third quarter and Jimmy Field scored 5 plays later on a touchdown run. Buddy Hamic recovered a Longhorn fumble to set up an Amedee field goal 13 plays later as the Tigers shut the Longhorns out.[6] In 1964, No. 1 Texas completed an undefeated season by defeating No. 2 Navy (led by Heisman Trophy winner and future Dallas Cowboys quarterback Roger Staubach). The game was played six weeks after the assassination of John F. Kennedy (coincidentally, a retired Naval officer) in Dallas. The 1964 game is the second bowl game in college football history to pair the No. 1 and No. 2 teams in the nation (the 1963 Rose Bowl being the first). In 1965, the Arkansas Razorbacks took an undefeated record (10–0) into the Classic versus a 9–1 Nebraska Cornhuskers team. Although Alabama had been awarded the AP and UPI (Coaches) polls national titles before the bowl games (which was standard at that time), Arkansas still had a chance to claim a share of the national championship with a victory over Nebraska. After a hard-fought defensive battle, the Hogs prevailed 10–7. That victory, coupled with an Alabama loss in the Orange Bowl to Texas (a team Arkansas defeated in Austin, Texas.), gave Arkansas the Grantland Rice Trophy emblematic of the national championship awarded by the Football Writers Association of America (FWAA). In the 1966 game, Arkansas put its 22-game winning streak at risk playing LSU, who defeated the Razorbacks, 14–7. The 1967 game was moved to Saturday, December 31, 1966, due to the Dallas Cowboys hosting the NFL Championship Game at the stadium on New Year's Day, a Sunday. The other major bowl games that year—the Rose Bowl, Sugar Bowl, and Orange Bowl—were played on Monday, January 2. The 1968 game saw SWC champs Texas A&M, led by coach Gene Stallings defeat former A&M head coach Bear Bryant and the Alabama Crimson Tide. Stallings was one of Bryant's \"Junction Boys\" as well as a former assistant, and would eventually go on to coach the Tide. After the Aggies defeated the Tide 20–16, Bryant embraced Stallings and carried him off the field. In 1969, Texas was off and running with its new offensive formation, the Wishbone. After dismantling all opponents of the 1968 season, Texas won the SWC crown again and this time faced the Tennessee Volunteers, in what was a lopsided win for Texas with almost 400 rushing yards. Texas won 36–13. The 1970 game featured Notre Dame's return to bowl games after a 45-year self-imposed ban. When the Irish made that decision, 9–1 LSU was overlooked for the game, and the Tigers stayed home instead. The Irish, led by quarterback Joe Theismann, faced top-ranked and undefeated Texas. Notre Dame led 17–14 late in the fourth quarter, but the Longhorns scored a late touchdown to clinch a 21–17 victory and an undisputed national championship. The same two teams met the next year, but this time, the Irish ended the Longhorns' 30-game winning streak with a 24–11 victory, denying Texas the Associated Press national championship (the Longhorns had already clinched the regular season championship in the UPI poll, a pre-bowl poll until the 1974 season; Nebraska won the AP title). Texas and Notre Dame met again in the 1978 game, with the Longhorns again top-ranked, only to see the Irish and quarterback Joe Montana roll to a 38–10 victory. The Irish vaulted from fifth to first in the final polls with the victory. The 1973 game featured Texas and Alabama once again playing in a bowl game. Alabama led 13–10 going into the 4th quarter when Texas quarterback, Alan Lowry, ran the bootleg to perfection and scrambled 32 yards for the go-ahead touchdown. Again, Texas defeated Alabama and Bear Bryant, 17–13. The 1976 Cotton Bowl showcased SWC co-Champ Arkansas against SEC stalwart Georgia. The Razorbacks had beaten No. 2 Texas A&M in a blowout to force a tie for the conference crown, and opened the door for Arkansas to stroll to Dallas on New Year's Day. After the Bulldogs jumped out to a 10–0 lead, the Hogs came roaring back, scoring 31 unanswered points, and defeating Georgia, 31–10. Arkansas finished the season 10–2. The 1977 Cotton Bowl featured SWC Champions Houston Cougars, who were entering the Cotton Bowl for the first time, against the undefeated Maryland Terrapins. Houston won 30–21, handing the Terps their only loss of the year. The 1979 Cotton Bowl Classic, nicknamed the Chicken Soup Game, featured one of the most historic comebacks in bowl history. Notre Dame trailed Houston 34–12 midway through the fourth quarter. Thanks to a blocked punt and the brilliance of future NFL Hall of Famer Joe Montana, the Irish rallied to win 35–34, their second consecutive Cotton Bowl Classic victory. The 1982 game between Texas and Alabama would be the final time that Bear Bryant would face the Longhorns. Having lost to Texas in all meetings prior, Alabama went into the fourth quarter ahead 10–0 and it would appear that the Bear would finally get a win over Texas while at Alabama. But the Longhorns scored their first points with a quarterback draw by Robert Brewer on a 3rd-and-long with 10:38 remaining.[7] On Texas' next possession, Terry Orr scored from eight yards out to cap an 11-play, 80-yard drive to put the Longhorns up 14–10 with 2:05 remaining. Alabama's Joey Jones returned the ensuing kickoff to the Texas 38-yard line, and Tide quarterback Walter Lewis took over with 1:54 left. On the very next play, UT's William Graham picked off a Lewis pass at the one. The Longhorns took a safety to insure better field position and Texas once again stunned Alabama and the Bear with a 14–12 victory.[8] The 1984 game featured No. 7 Georgia of the SEC against undefeated No. 2 Texas of the SWC. Texas led 9–3 with more than four minutes to play in a battle of field goals between Georgia's Kevin Butler and Texas' Jeff Ward. A Chip Andrews (Georgia) punt was muffed by Texas defensive back Craig Curry late in the fourth quarter, then Georgia quarterback John Lastinger ran 17 yards for a touchdown with 3:22 left to play to capture a 10–9 victory, costing the Longhorns a possible national title. The 1989 game between UCLA and Arkansas was highly publicized in the Dallas area because Bruin quarterback Troy Aikman was expected to be the top pick in the 1989 NFL draft; the first pick was held by the Dallas Cowboys. Much was made of Cowboys longtime head coach Tom Landry watching Aikman practice at Texas Stadium, UCLA's practice facility for game preparation. Landry never got to draft Aikman, because he was fired the next month, but his successor, Jimmy Johnson, did. UCLA and Aikman won, 17–3. The Cotton Bowl Classic has seen its share of great quarterbacks. Sammy Baugh, Davey O'Brien, Babe Parilli, Bobby Layne, Norm Van Brocklin, Y. A. Tittle, Bart Starr, Roger Staubach, Ken Stabler, Joe Theismann, Joe Montana, Dan Marino, Doug Flutie, Troy Aikman, and Eli Manning all have played in the game. Three of the four Heisman Trophy winners from the 1984–87 seasons finished their college career in the Cotton Bowl Classic: Doug Flutie for Boston College in January 1985, Bo Jackson of Auburn in 1986, and Tim Brown of Notre Dame in 1988. Brown and fellow Heisman winner Davey O'Brien, who played in the 1937 Cotton Bowl, both attended nearby Woodrow Wilson High School in the Lakewood area. \"Woodrow\" became the first high school ever to produce two Heisman winners. For 53 years, the SWC champion played as the home team in the Cotton Bowl Classic, a tie-in which continued through the 1994 season. Until the mid-1980s, the contest was almost universally counted as a major New Year's Day bowl. However, by the late 1980s, the Cotton Bowl Classic's prestige had fallen significantly. During the 1980s, many SWC teams were left ineligible for postseason play due to NCAA probations for rule violations. Also, the conference's quality of play suffered a marked decline. The SWC champion lost the last seven times in which it received an automatic bid to the game, and the last national champion for almost four decades to play in the Cotton Bowl Classic was Notre Dame in 1977 (eventual national champions Alabama and Clemson would later play in the Cotton Bowl after the 2015 and 2018 seasons, respectively). Finally, the Cotton Bowl Classic was played outdoors during cold weather on occasion (most notably the 1979 game). Meanwhile, the Fiesta Bowl, unhindered by conference tie-ins and played in generally warm weather, propelled itself to major-bowl status by attracting national championship contenders, most notably with its January 1987 matchup between Penn State and Miami. In the minds of many fans, the Fiesta replaced the Cotton as a major bowl. Despite this, the Cotton Bowl Classic still retained enough prestige that it was included as one of the top bowls in the Bowl Coalition when it was formed in 1992. However, in 1995, the new Bowl Alliance (the predecessor of the BCS) chose to include the Fiesta over the Cotton in its rotation. While it was still capable of landing Top 10 teams, it was no longer in a position to decide the national championship. In 18 of the 21 seasons since 1995, the Cotton Bowl has featured two ranked opponents. In the other three seasons, one of the teams was ranked (2002, 2003, and 2010). In 1995, the SWC gave up control of the Cotton Bowl Classic as part of its planned dissolution after the season. From 1999 to 2014, the Cotton Bowl Classic had the second pick from the Big 12 after the Bowl Alliance and its successor, the Bowl Championship Series–usually the championship game loser or a division runner-up. From 1996 to 1998, the other participant was either the champion of the Western Athletic Conference or the runner-up of the Pac-10 Conference. In 1996, the No. 5 BYU Cougars joined Notre Dame as the only programs outside of a major conference to play in the Cotton Bowl in the modern era, defeating the Kansas State Wildcats 19–15, winning an NCAA record 14th game, and finishing the season ranked fifth in the country with a 14–1 record. In 1999, the Cotton Bowl arranged for a team from the Southeastern Conference to be the Big 12 opponent, and Southwestern Bell (now AT&T) began sponsoring the event. More often than not, the SEC representative was the runner-up from the West Division. However, Tennessee appeared in 2001 and 2005, and Missouri appeared in 2014. Through 2008, the Cotton Bowl Classic continued to be played on New Year's Day (except in 2004 and 2006, when the game was moved to January 2) and was usually the second game of the day to kick off, generally following the Outback Bowl. This decade was kicked off in grand fashion, as two former Southwest Conference rivals faced off in the 2000 Classic. The Arkansas Razorbacks, now a member of the SEC (as of 1992[update]), and Texas Longhorns, now a member of the Big XII (as of 1996[update]) faced off in the first college football game of the last year of the 20th Century. After a lackluster first half ended with the game tied 3–3, the Razorbacks opened things up, led by Offensive MVP running back Cedric Cobbs. Arkansas beat their former hated rival, 27–6, holding the Longhorns to negative yards rushing, and sacking the Texas QB a bowl-record 8 times. The 2003 Cotton Bowl Classic saw a rematch between the Texas Longhorns and the LSU Tigers. LSU led at the half 17–7 however Roy Williams of Texas had a tremendous breakout in the second half to lead Texas to victory over the Tigers, 35–20. The 2004 Cotton Bowl Classic saw the return of the Mississippi Rebels, whose last appearance in the Cotton Bowl Classic was a 12–7 loss to Texas in 1962. The 2004 Cotton Bowl Classic would also be New York Giants quarterback Eli Manning's last college football game. Manning led his team to beat Oklahoma State 31–28. The 2007 Cotton Bowl Classic was between Auburn Tigers and the Nebraska Cornhuskers; Auburn won 17–14. In the 2008 Cotton Bowl Classic, Missouri's running back Tony Temple broke the bowl game rushing record by gaining 281 yards on 24 carries. (The record was previously held by Rice's Dickey Maegle, who had rushed for 265 yards.) Missouri beat Arkansas 38–7.[9] In April 2008, Cotton Bowl Classic officials announced that in 2009 and 2010 the game would be moved from its traditional start time of 10 a.m. CST on January 1 to 1 p.m. CST on January 2.[10] In the final Cotton Bowl Classic game to be held in the Cotton Bowl stadium, the 8–4, No. 20 Ole Miss Rebels defeated the 11–1, No. 7 Texas Tech Red Raiders, 47–34. Tech quarterback Graham Harrell broke the NCAA record in this game for most touchdown passes thrown by anyone in Cotton Bowl Classic history.[11] In 2010, the Cotton Bowl Classic moved to the new Cowboys Stadium (now AT&T Stadium) in Arlington, as part of a bid by bowl officials to make it part of the BCS in 2011. The Cotton Bowl had recently been remodeled and expanded to over 92,000 seats as part of a long-term drive to regain major status for the bowl game. However, Dallas' frequently cold January weather had been a longstanding concern, and was thought to have hampered any prospect of upgrading the game to the BCS. In contrast, the new stadium would offer top amenities and a retractable roof.[12] A new four-year agreement between the BCS and ESPN had forestalled any possibility of the Cotton Bowl Classic joining the BCS until 2015 at the earliest.[13] Later findings that the Fiesta Bowl reimbursed employees more than $46,000 for political contributions could have opened the door for the Cotton Bowl to replace the Fiesta in the BCS bowl rotation;[14] however, the Fiesta Bowl did not lose its BCS rotation. In the 2010 Cotton Bowl Classic played between the Oklahoma State Cowboys and the Ole Miss Rebels at the new Cowboys Stadium, the Rebels shut down the high scoring Cowboys offense to win the 74th annual Cotton Bowl Classic 21–7. In 2010, the Cotton Bowl celebrated its 75th anniversary with a new logo dedicated to the yearlong celebration. Texas A&M played Louisiana State University in the 2011 AT&T Cotton Bowl Classic on January 7, 2011. LSU would beat Texas A&M 41–24. This was the first Cotton Bowl Classic to be played in prime time, as well as the latest calendar date for the game.[15] In the 2012 match-up, the Arkansas Razorbacks defeated the Kansas State Wildcats 29–16. It was a BCS-worthy game, featuring two Top 10 teams. The game was highlighted by Razorback Joe Adams punt return of 51 yards for a touchdown in the second quarter, to give Arkansas early command. It was the first punt returned for a touchdown in the Cotton Bowl Classic since former Razorback Lance Alworth did it in 1961. After the Hogs posted 19 unanswered points, Kansas State responded with 16 consecutive points of their own in the second and third quarters. But the Razorbacks pulled away late in the third quarter and early fourth quarter, led by quarterback Tyler Wilson, the game's offensive MVP. Arkansas improved to 11–2 for the 2011 season, and finished ranked No. 5, while K-State fell to 10–3. In 2013, the No. 10 Texas A&M Aggies defeated the No. 12 Oklahoma Sooners 41–13 to win the Cotton Bowl Classic and to finish the season with an 11–2 record. Johnny Manziel rushed for 229 yards during the game, a Cotton Bowl record, rushing for two touchdowns and throwing for two more. Though the halftime score was 14–13 Texas A&M, the Aggies went on to score 27 unanswered second half points to win the game. The Cotton Bowl Classic returned to \"major\" bowl status in the 2014 season in conjunction with the first year of the new College Football Playoff. It will host a national semifinal once every three years (in the 2015, 2018, 2021, 2024 seasons), and in other years will host two at-large teams that did not get selected to the four-team playoff. As part of this move, television rights switched to ESPN, which also televises other games in the playoff system. The January 2015 game featured two team ranked in the top ten for the first time in 20 seasons; the No. 8 Michigan State Spartans of the Big Ten Conference and the No. 5 Baylor Bears of the Big 12 Conference. The Spartans beat the Bears by a score of 42–41 to claim the school's first-ever Cotton Bowl Classic championship. The 2017 game saw the No. 15 Western Michigan Broncos of the Mid-American Conference (MAC) meet the No. 9 Wisconsin Badgers of the Big Ten Conference. The Badgers beat the previously undefeated Broncos, 24–16. The Broncos were the first team from the MAC to participate in the Cotton Bowl Classic. From 1989 until 1995, the game was sponsored by Mobil Oil and known as the Mobil Cotton Bowl Classic. From 1996 to 2013, the game was sponsored by Southwestern Bell Corporation; however, it went through several name changes, first in 2000 when the firm adopted a standardized \"SBC\" branding reflecting its name it adopted in 1995, SBC Communications, and since 2006, after their acquisition of AT&T Corporation, and its subsequent name change to AT&T Inc., as the AT&T Cotton Bowl Classic. On October 15, 2014, ESPN.com reported that AT&T would no longer sponsor the Cotton Bowl since it already holds the naming rights to the stadium in which it is played.[16][17] On November 7, 2014, it was announced that Goodyear would become the new sponsor of the game, now known for sponsorship reasons as the Goodyear Cotton Bowl Classic.[18] The Cotton Bowl is a stadium which opened in 1930 and became known as \"The House That Doak Built\" due to the immense crowds that former SMU running back Doak Walker drew to the stadium during his college career in the late 1940s. Originally known as the Fair Park Bowl, it is located in Fair Park, site of the State Fair of Texas. The Cotton Bowl Classic called its namesake home since the bowl's inception in 1937 until the 2010 game. The NFL's Dallas Cowboys called the Cotton Bowl home for 11 years, from the team's formation in 1960 until 1971, when the Cowboys moved to Texas Stadium. Although not the first established bowl game, the Cotton Bowl is a play on the phrase \"cotton boll.\" Texas is the leading producer of cotton in the United States. AT&T Stadium, formerly Cowboys Stadium, is a domed stadium with a retractable roof in Arlington, Texas. After failed negotiations to return the Cowboys to the Cotton Bowl, Jerry Jones along with the city of Arlington, Texas funded the stadium at a cost of $1.15 billion. It was completed on May 29, 2009, and seats 80,000, but is expandable to seat up to 100,000. AT&T Stadium is the largest domed stadium in the world.[19] A highlight of AT&T Stadium is its center-hung high-definition television screen, the second largest in the world. The 160 by 72 feet (49 by 22 m), 11,520-square-foot (1,070 m2) scoreboard surpasses the 8,736 sq ft (812 m2) screen that opened in 2009 at the renovated Kauffman Stadium in Kansas City, Missouri.[20][21][22] Team rankings entering games for which the Cotton Bowl Classic was designated a CFP semifinal are taken from CFP rankings. Otherwise, rankings are taken from the AP Poll (inaugurated in 1936), before each game was played.

From 1999 to 2014, the Cotton Bowl Classic was televised by Fox. As part of the College Football Playoff rotation, ESPN took over rights to the game beginning in 2015.[29] In 2013, Fox Deportes televised the game nationally for the first time in Spanish.[30] The game returned to Fox Deportes in 2014. In 2015, ESPN Deportes becomes the new Spanish-language television home of the game. The game is also broadcast nationally on radio by ESPN Radio and ESPN Deportes Radio. ESPN Radio succeeded former longtime Cotton Bowl carrier Westwood One in 2013.[31] 2013 marked the first Spanish radio broadcast of the game.",

Texas State Historical Association (TSHA) https://www.tshaonline.org https://www.tshaonline.org/handbook/entries/cotton-bowl By: Lisa C. Maxwell Published: 1976 Updated: October 16, 2024 The Cotton Bowl is the stadium in which the annual Cotton Bowl Classic football game is played. The stadium, located in Fair Park in Dallas, is the second stadium at the site. In the 1890s unsuccessful attempts were made to build a wooden stadium there to host a world-championship prizefight. In 1921 the first stadium, with a seating capacity of 15,000, was constructed on the site of the future Cotton Bowl and named Fair Park Football Stadium. It was used for community events and football games, and was never filled until it sold out for the 1923 football game between Baylor and Southern Methodist University. In 1930 ground was broken for the construction of the Fair Park Bowl on the site of the Fair Park Football Stadium. The 46,000-seat stadium was completed in time for a football game on October 26, 1930. The cut-and-fill construction lowered the playing surface twenty-four feet below the original ground level. The dirt that was removed was placed around the field, so that the back seats were fifteen feet above the street. In addition to football games the stadium was used for such events as the Cavalcade of History during the Texas Centennial Exposition (1936), an outdoor play with 250 actors. That same year President Franklin D. Roosevelt spoke to 40,000 in the stadium. A milestone in the history of the stadium occurred on January 1, 1937, when the first Cotton Bowl Classic was played before a crowd of 17,000 between the Texas Christian University Horned Frogs and Marquette University; TCU won 16 to 6. The Cotton Bowl Classic, which reflected the new name the stadium had acquired, was the idea of J. Curtis Sanford, a Dallas oilman who lost $6,000 on the first game. Within three years the game was being called \"Sanford's Folly,\" and in 1940 the 12,000 paid customers were not enough to prevent Sanford's losing $20,000. In 1941 Sanford arranged a partnership with the Southwest Conference, and the game between Texas A&M and Fordham University sold 45,507 tickets. After this first sellout, every subsequent game was sold out. World War II did not suspend the Cotton Bowl, as it did some other Dallas events. In 1944 a team composed of soldiers from Randolph Field in San Antonio played the University of Texas Longhorns. The score was the first tie at the Cotton Bowl Classic. With the growing popularity of the Cotton Bowl games, the stadium was in need of expansion and renovation. Its design made maintenance difficult. Heavy rain during a tropical storm in 1947 washed dirt onto the playing field. The previous year Mayor Woodall Rogers had called for the sale of bonds to support renovation. These $100 bonds matured in thirty years and allowed the purchaser to buy reserved tickets for any event at the Cotton Bowl during that time. The proceeds virtually rebuilt the old stadium in 1948 and added 21,431 seats, bringing the seating capacity to 67,431. The next year more improvements increased the seating capacity to 75,504 and added new team dressing rooms, a three-story press box, and an automatic lawn-sprinkler system. The opening baseball game of the Texas League season, attendance 53,748, was played at the Cotton Bowl on April 11, 1950, and pitted the Dallas Eagles against Tulsa. In 1952 the Dallas Texans played in the Cotton Bowl after Dallas was awarded a National Football League franchise, but poor fan support led to the team's moving to Baltimore the following year. Two other professional football teams, the Dallas Cowboys and an American Football League team named the Dallas Texans, had the Cotton Bowl as their home stadium at one time. The AFL Dallas Texans played there from 1960 through 1962 before moving to Kansas City. The Dallas Cowboys were at the bowl from their formation in 1960 until Texas Stadium was completed in Irving in 1971. On January 1, 1967, in the National Football League championship game, the Cowboys lost to the Green Bay Packers at the Cotton Bowl, 34 to 27. The Cotton Bowl, however, is best known for the Cotton Bowl Classic, which until the demise of the Southwest Conference matched the winner of that conference with a highly rated team from some other conference or an independent team such as Notre Dame. Beginning in 1937, the game has been a showcase for future NFL stars and for winners of prestigious college football awards. The 1937 game featured Texas Christian University quarterbacks Sammy Baugh, later Washington Redskins quarterback and a member of the NFL Hall of Fame, and Davey (Robert David) O'Brien, who won the Heisman trophy in 1938 and later played for the Philadelphia Eagles. In 1946 Bobby (Robert Lawrence) Layne, future quarterback of the Detroit Lions, led Texas over Missouri. The 1948 game was the first to match undefeated and nationally ranked teams-Southern Methodist University (9–0-1), ranked number 3, and Penn State (9–0-0), ranked number 4. A black member of the Penn State team was the first African American to play in the Cotton Bowl. The 1954 game is best remembered for the off-the-bench tackle of Rice's Dickie Maegle by Alabama's Tommy Lewis. Syracuse University (10–0) and the University of Texas (9–1) played in 1960, the first time a national championship was decided by the Cotton Bowl Classic. The 1970 game was the outstanding bowl game of the season. Notre Dame (8–1-1), which had had a policy since 1925 of playing no postseason games, agreed to play the number-one-ranked University of Texas (10–0). Texas scored with a minute and eight seconds left to win both the game and the Longhorns' second national championship. The 1971 game was a rematch between Texas (10–0) and Notre Dame (9–1). Joe Theismann led the Irish to a 24-to-11 win and ended UT's thirty-game winning streak. Heisman Trophy winners who have played in the Cotton Bowl Classic are Davey O’Brien (TCU, 1937 Cotton Bowl), Doak Walker (SMU, 1948;1949), Ernie Davis (Syracuse, 1960), Roger Staubach (Navy, 1964), John Cappilletti (Penn State, 1972), Earl Campbell (Texas, 1978), Doug Flutie (Boston College, 1985), Bo Jackson (Auburn, 1986), Tim Brown (Notre Dame, 1988), Gino Torretta (Miami, 1993), Ricky Williams (Texas, 1999), and Johnny Manziel (Texas A&M, 2013). Outland Trophy winners have been Bud Brooks (Arkansas, 1955 Cotton Bowl, Scott Appleton (Texas, 1964), Tommy Nobis (Texas, 1964), Lloyd Phillips (Arkansas, 1965), Bill Stanfill (Georgia, 1967), Brad Shearer (Texas, 1978), Dave Rimington (Nebraska, 1980), Mike Ruth (Boston College, 1985), Russell Maryland (Miami, 1991), Kris Farris (UCLA, 1998), John Henderson (Tennessee, 2001), and Luke Joeckel (Texas A&M, 2013). Lombardi Award winners in the Cotton Bowl have been Walt Patulski (Notre Dame, 1970;1971 Cotton bowls), Wilson Whitley (Houston, 1977), Ross Browner (Notre Dame, 1978), Kenneth Sims (Texas, 1982), Dave Rimington (Nebraska, 1980), and Tony Degrate (Texas, 1984). Winners of the Walter Camp Award have been John Cappilletti (Penn State, 1972 Cotton Bowl), Ken MacAfee (Notre Dame, 1978), Doug Flutie (Boston College, 1985), Bo Jackson (Auburn, 1986), Gino Torretta (Miami, 1993), Ricky Williams (Texas, 1999), and Darren McFadden (Arkansas, 2008). Davey O'Brien Award winners who have played in the Cotton Bowl Classic have been Earl Campbell (Texas, 1978 Cotton Bowl), Mike Singletary (Baylor, 1981), and Doug Flutie (Boston College, 1985). The Maxwell Award has gone to Davey O'Brien (TCU, 1937 Cotton Bowl), Doak Walker (SMU, 1948; 1949), Roger Staubach (Navy, 1964), Tommy Nobis (Texas, 1964), Ross Browner (Notre Dame, 1978), Doug Flutie (Boston College, 1985), and Johnny Manziel (Texas A&M, 2013). Some others who have played in the Classic and become professional football stars are Kenny Stabler (Alabama, 1968 Cotton Bowl), Tobin Rote (Rice, 1950), Vito \"Babe\" Parilli (Kentucky, 1952), Jim Brown (Syracuse, 1957), King Hill and Frank Ryan (Rice, 1958), Joe Montana (Notre Dame, 1978), Bob Golic (Notre Dame, 1978), and Troy Aikman (UCLA, 1989). The Classic was first televised nationwide in 1953, and in 1958 a long-term contract with CBS sports was signed, the same year the Cotton Bowl Parade was first held. The parade was televised by CBS for the first time in 1964. By 1992 it had become an important Dallas event, with an attendance downtown of 150,000 and a television audience of twenty million. That year the parade had forty-seven floats, six helium balloons, and ten marching bands, with a total participation of 5,000. The next year, however, the parade was canceled because lost television coverage had caused a loss of financial support from businesses. In addition to the Cotton Bowl Classic the annual football game between the University of Texas and the University of Oklahoma is played in the stadium. Southern Methodist University played its home games there until Texas Stadium was built. By the 1990s the Cotton Bowl was supported by Mobil Oil and was called the Mobil Cotton Bowl Classic. In 1993–94 the Cotton Bowl was renovated, after a great deal of controversy. The $2.8 million expense was authorized by the city of Dallas to prepare for hosting part of the 1994 World Cup Soccer Tournament. It required the removal of some seats to expand the field and the replacement of the artificial turf with natural grass. Sporting events have not been the only entertainment at the Cotton Bowl. Every Independence Day a display of fireworks has been held. General Douglas MacArthur spoke before a crowd in the bowl. Such religious leaders as Norman Vincent Peale and Billy Graham have spoken there. In addition, in the early days USO shows were performed at the Cotton Bowl. Frank Sinatra and Elvis Presley appeared there, and rock concerts occurred at the bowl into the 1990s.

Fortunately, there are plenty of places to go. Whether you’re looking to hunt down some last-minute bargains, get an early start on 2025’s holiday shopping, or catch one last movie, there are plenty of options.
