                "content": "The US has opened the 119th Congress with a vote for the speakership in its lower chamber, the House of Representatives. The United States House of Representatives has re-elected Republican Mike Johnson as its speaker, in a vote seen as a nail-biting test of party unity in advance of President-elect Donald Trump’s second term in the White House. But Johnson’s campaign to keep the speaker’s gavel was not without its bumps on Friday. Johnson emerged victorious after an uncertain first round of voting, as some members of his party initially withheld their votes over issues like his role in the recent bipartisan budget negotiations. He ultimately won the speakership with 218 votes out of a total of 435, after two of the holdouts — Ralph Norman of South Carolina and Keith Self of Texas — changed their votes. Another 215 votes, all Democratic, went to minority leader Hakeem Jeffries. Representative Thomas Massie, who had pledged to refuse Johnson, cast his vote for fellow Republican Tom Emmer. The tight vote underscored the narrow margin of control Republicans have over the chamber. With only 219 seats in the House, Republicans will need nearly every vote they have to reach a majority in a party-line vote. That may give certain far-right members greater sway over legislation, as they exercise their leverage. Friday’s vote for Johnson also put Trump’s ability to muster Republican votes under the microscope. He had called on the party to back Johnson, as he prepares to pursue an ambitious agenda of tax cuts and mass deportation when he takes office on January 20. The vote for the speakership came on the first day of the 119th Congress, following November’s general election. Republicans hold majorities in both the House and the Senate, after flipping the upper chamber from Democratic control. The race for the speakership was expected to be a nail-biter as the House gathered for its first session of the new year. Several Republicans had pledged in the lead-up to the session to reject Johnson, particularly after he led a bipartisan push to pass a temporary budget bill in December. Some objected to the lack of spending cuts. Others felt frustration that the bill did not address the federal borrowing limit, as President-elect Trump had demanded. But on Friday morning, top Republicans appeared to rally around Johnson, including Trump himself. “Good luck today for Speaker Mike Johnson, a fine man of great ability, who is very close to having 100% support,” Trump wrote on social media. “A win for Mike today will be a big win for the Republican Party, and yet another acknowledgment of our 129 year most consequential Presidential Election!!” While Trump had previously endorsed Johnson, he had also said the “others are very good, too”. Later, on the House floor, Representative Lisa McClain, another leading Republican, gave a speech to nominate Johnson. She placed his leadership in the context of broader party priorities. “We have the opportunity to put America first again. We have an opportunity to do something about crime. We have an opportunity to do something about the border. And we have an opportunity to take care of our veterans,” McClain said. She briefly appeared to acknowledge the possibility of party discord over the vote. “No speaker is perfect. And no one will ever be. However, achieving perfection requires incremental gains and hard decisions along the way. None of us will get exactly what we want,” McClain said. Johnson himself exuded an air of confidence when he arrived at the Capitol on Friday, having spent the night seeking to win over hardline holdouts. “We don’t have time for drama,” Johnson said as he walked into the Capitol on Friday. Nevertheless, after the roll-call vote was held, Johnson was initially shy of the 218 votes needed for victory. Three Republicans initially cast their votes for other candidates. Norman tapped Jim Jordan, Massie backed Emmer and Self put forward Byron Donalds. Several other Republicans — including Chip Roy of Texas, another Johnson critic — offered no vote at all. But when asked after the first vote if they would back a candidate, Roy and others supported Johnson. A group of Republicans — including several holdouts — briefly left the House floor with Johnson to negotiate. When they returned, Norman and Self changed their vote. In a Friday post on the social media platform X, Massie explained why he would remain a holdout, voting “hell no” on Johnson’s leadership. He expressed fear Johnson would not be able to enact Trump’s legislative priorities. “President Trump’s agenda needs to become law. Speaker Johnson has already demonstrated he is not the man who can get that done,” Massie wrote. The speakership election comes after Republicans also elected John Thune as the Senate’s majority leader, with Chuck Schumer representing the Democratic minority in the chamber. Thune has pledged to shepherd through Trump’s agenda, despite the fact that Republicans hold only 53 seats in the 100-person chamber. That falls short of the 60-vote supermajority needed to overcome the filibuster, a means for the minority to stall or scuttle legislation. Both chambers of Congress will be faced with several controversial pieces of legislation this upcoming year, setting the stage for heated battles. Congress will need to revisit the question of funding the federal government when the current budget bill expires in March. And it will also need to weigh raising the debt ceiling — the amount the federal government is able to borrow — later this year. The federal government already has more than $36 trillion in debt, and many congressional Republicans are expected to demand significant spending cuts going forward. The election of a House speaker, once considered a ho-hum ceremony, has become increasingly contentious in recent years. In 2023, the chamber went through 15 rounds of voting over four days before electing Kevin McCarthy to the role. Johnson, a low-profile conservative Christian lawyer from Louisiana, was elevated to speaker after the party ousted McCarthy in the middle of his term. In the wake of his re-election, Johnson pledged to “reject business as usual” in the House. “We’re going to drastically cut back the size and scope of government,” he said in a speech to members.

                "content": "The Los Angeles Lakers are an American professional basketball team based in Los Angeles. The Lakers compete in the National Basketball Association (NBA) as a member of the Pacific Division of the Western Conference. The Lakers play their home games at Crypto.com Arena, an arena they share with the Los Angeles Sparks of the Women's National Basketball Association and the Los Angeles Kings of the National Hockey League.[10] The Lakers are one of the most successful teams in the history of the NBA with 17 championships, the second most in the league behind the Boston Celtics.[11] The franchise began in 1946 as the Detroit Gems of the National Basketball League (NBL).[12] After one season, a new ownership relocated the team to Minneapolis, Minnesota,[13][12] and renamed the team as the Minneapolis Lakers.[14] The Lakers won the 1948 NBL championship before joining the rival Basketball Association of America, where they won the 1949 BAA championship. Following the merger of the NBL and the BAA into the NBA in 1949, the Lakers won four of the next five NBA championships.[15] After struggling financially in the late 1950s, they relocated to Los Angeles before the 1960–61 season. The Lakers made the NBA Finals six times in the 1960s, but lost every series to the Celtics, beginning their long and storied rivalry. In 1968, the Lakers acquired four-time NBA Most Valuable Player (MVP) Wilt Chamberlain, and won their sixth NBA title in 1972, led by coach Bill Sharman. After the retirement of Chamberlain, the team traded for superstar Kareem Abdul-Jabbar. Two big changes came in 1979, first, Jerry Buss purchased the Lakers, and pioneered a vision of basketball as entertainment as well as sport.[16] Second, the Lakers drafted Magic Johnson first overall in the 1979 NBA draft. The combination of Johnson, a prodigy point guard, and dominant center in Abdul-Jabbar provided the Lakers with superstars to anchor their roster. The promotion of head coach Pat Riley in 1981 and addition of forward James Worthy through the 1982 draft established the Lakers as an NBA powerhouse throughout the 1980s. The franchise won five championships in a nine-year span, including two out of three marquee Finals matchups against the Celtics. The Lakers were defeated by their Boston archrivals in the 1984 Finals, but triumphed over them in 1985 and 1987. After Riley departed and Abdul-Jabbar, Johnson, and Worthy retired, the Lakers struggled in the early 1990s. It was not until 1996 when the team traded with the Charlotte Hornets for the draft rights to Kobe Bryant and signed center Shaquille O'Neal that the Lakers returned to dominance during the early 2000s. The superstar duo, along with Hall of Fame coach Phil Jackson, led the Lakers to three consecutive championships between 2000 and 2002, securing the franchise's second \"three-peat\".[17] The dynamic \"Shaq-and-Kobe\" era ended when the Lakers traded away O'Neal after the team lost to the Detroit Pistons in the 2004 Finals. It was not until the Lakers traded for Pau Gasol that Bryant and Jackson returned to the NBA Finals, losing to the Celtics in 2008 but winning championships in 2009 and 2010. The 2010 Finals marked the latest matchup of the Lakers and Celtics, with Los Angeles winning its 16th title. Jackson retired in 2011, and the Lakers endured their longest playoff drought in franchise history. Gasol departed in 2014, and Bryant retired in 2016. After rebuilding seasons with young, highly rated prospects, the Lakers signed superstar LeBron James in 2018.[18] In 2019, the team traded several of those prospects for star big man Anthony Davis.[19] The Lakers—led by James, Davis, and coach Frank Vogel—won the team's 17th championship in 2020, tying the Celtics for the most titles until 2024.[20] The Lakers hold the record for NBA's longest winning streak, 33 straight games, set in 1971–72.[21] 26 Hall of Famers have played for Los Angeles, while four have coached the team. Abdul-Jabbar, Johnson, O'Neal, and Bryant won a combined eight NBA MVP awards with the Lakers.[22] The franchise was founded in 1946 as the Detroit Gems and played in the National Basketball League (NBL) during the 1946–47 season where it finished last in the league with only 4 wins in 44 games. Though the team was scheduled to continue in the NBL the following season,[23] its ownership, faced with high losses due to low attendance and lack of homecourt, decided on selling the team to Ben Berger and Morris Chalfen of Minnesota for $15,000[13][24] Minneapolis sportswriter Sid Hartman played a key behind-the-scenes role in helping put together the deal and later the team.[25] Inspired by Minnesota's nickname, \"Land of 10,000 Lakes\", the team rechristened themselves the Lakers.[26][27] Hartman helped them hire John Kundla from College of St. Thomas, to be their first head coach, by meeting with him and selling him on the team.[28][29] As the franchise had the worst record in the NBL the previous season, it got the first pick in the 1947 Professional Basketball League of America dispersal draft, which they used to select George Mikan. Led by Mikan, the Lakers had a solid roster, which also featured forward Jim Pollard and playmaker Herm Schaefer.[30] In their first season, they led the league with a 43–17 record, later winning the NBL championship that season.[31] In 1948, the Lakers moved from the NBL to the Basketball Association of America (BAA), and Mikan's 28.3 point per game (ppg) scoring average set a BAA record. In the 1949 BAA Finals they won the championship, beating the Washington Capitols four games to two.[32] Following the season, the BAA and the NBL merged to form the National Basketball Association (NBA).[33] In the newly formed league, the Lakers improved to 51–17 record and won their third straight professional championship.[34] In the 1950–51 season, Mikan won his third straight scoring title at 28.4 ppg and the Lakers went 44–24 to win their second straight division title.[35] One of those games, a 19–18 loss against the Fort Wayne Pistons, became infamous as the lowest scoring game in NBA history.[36] In the playoffs, they defeated the Indianapolis Olympians in three games but lost to the Rochester Royals in the next round.[30] During the 1951–52 season, the Lakers won 40 games, finishing second in their division.[37] They faced the New York Knicks in the NBA Finals, which they won in seven games.[38] In the 1952–53 season, Mikan led the NBA in rebounding, averaging 14.4 rebounds per game (rpg), and was named MVP of the 1953 NBA All-Star Game.[35] After a 48–22 regular season, the Lakers defeated the Fort Wayne Pistons in the Western playoffs to advance to the NBA Finals.[38] They then defeated the New York Knicks to win their second straight championship.[39] Though Lakers star George Mikan suffered from knee problems throughout the 1953–54 season, he was still able to average 18 ppg.[40] Clyde Lovellette, who was drafted in 1952, helped the team win the Western Division.[40] The team won its third straight championship in the 1950s and sixth in seven seasons when it defeated the Syracuse Nationals in seven games.[39] Following Mikan's retirement in the 1954 off-season, the Lakers struggled but still managed to win 40 games. Although they defeated the Rochester Royals in the first round of the playoffs, they were defeated by the Fort Wayne Pistons in the semifinals.[41] Although they had losing records the next two seasons, they made the playoffs each year.[37] Mikan came back for the last half of the 1955–56 season, but struggled and retired for good after the season.[42] Led by Lovellette's 20.6 points and 13.5 rebounds, they advanced to the Conference Finals in 1956–57. The Lakers had one of the worst seasons in team history in 1957–58 when they won a league-low 19 games.[43] They had hired Mikan, who had been the team's general manager for the previous two seasons, as head coach to replace Kundla. Mikan was fired in January when the team was 9–30, and Kundla was rehired.[37][44] The Lakers earned the top pick in the 1958 NBA draft and used it to select Elgin Baylor. Baylor, who was named NBA Rookie of the Year and co-MVP of the 1959 NBA All-Star Game, averaged 24.9 ppg and 15.0 rpg helping the Lakers improve to second in their division despite a 33–39 record.[45] After upsetting the Hawks in six games in the division finals, they returned to the NBA Finals, but were swept by the Celtics, beginning their long rivalry.[46] In their last year in Minneapolis, the Lakers went 25–50. On January 18, 1960, the team was coming off a loss and traveling to St. Louis when their plane crash-landed.[49] Snow storms had driven the pilot 150 miles off course when he was forced to land in a cornfield. No one was hurt.[50] Their record earned them the number two pick in the 1960 NBA draft. The team selected Jerry West from West Virginia University.[51] During the 1960 off-season, the Lakers became the NBA's first West Coast team when owner Bob Short decided to move the team to Los Angeles.[52] Led by Baylor's 34.8 ppg and 19.8 rpg, Los Angeles won 11 more than the year before in West's first season.[53] On November 15 that season, Baylor set a new NBA scoring record when he scored 71 points in a victory against the New York Knicks while grabbing 25 rebounds.[54] In doing so, Baylor broke his own NBA record of 64 points. Despite a losing record, the Lakers made the playoffs.[37] They came within two points of the NBA Finals when they lost in game seven of their second round series against St. Louis.[55] Led by Baylor and West at 38.3 and 30.8 ppg respectively,[56] the Lakers improved to 54–26 in 1961–62, and made the finals. In a game five victory, Baylor grabbed 22 rebounds and set the still-standing NBA record for points in a finals game with 61,[57] despite fouling out of the game.[58] The Lakers, however, lost to the Celtics by three points in overtime of game seven.[56] Frank Selvy, after making two jumpers in the final 40 seconds to tie the game,[59][60] missed a potential game-winning 18 foot jump shot in regulation, a miss which he said in June 2010 still haunted him more than 40 years later.[60] Los Angeles won 53 games in 1962–63, behind Baylor's 34.0 ppg and West's 27.1 ppg[61] but lost in the NBA Finals in six games to the Celtics.[61] After falling to 42–38 and losing in the first round of the 1964 NBA playoffs to the Hawks, the team won 49 games in 1964–65. The Lakers surged past the Baltimore Bullets in the division finals, behind West's record-setting 46.3 ppg in the series.[62] They lost again to the Celtics in the Finals however, this time in five games.[63] Los Angeles lost in the finals to Boston in seven games again in 1966, this time by two points.[64] Down by 16 entering the fourth quarter, and 10 with a minute and a half to go, the Lakers mounted a furious rally in the closing moments, which fell just short.[65] After dropping to 36 wins and losing in the first round of the 1967 NBA playoffs, they lost in the finals to the Celtics again in 1968.[37] Los Angeles moved to a brand-new arena, The Forum, in 1967, after playing seven seasons at the Los Angeles Memorial Sports Arena. On July 9, 1968, the team acquired Wilt Chamberlain from the Philadelphia 76ers for Darrell Imhoff, Archie Clark, and Jerry Chambers.[67] In his first season as a Laker, Chamberlain set a team record by averaging a league-leading 21.1 rpg.[68] West, Baylor, and Chamberlain each averaged over 20 points, and Los Angeles won their division.[69] The Lakers and Celtics again met in the finals, and Los Angeles had home court advantage against Boston for the first time in their rivalry. They won the first game behind Jerry West's 53 points,[70] and had a 3–2 lead after five.[71] Boston won the series in seven games however,[72] and earned their 11th NBA Championship in 13 seasons.[73] West was named the first-ever Finals MVP; this remains the only time that a member of the losing team has won the award.[74] In 1970, West won his first scoring title at 31.2 ppg, the team returned to the finals, and for the first time in 16 years, they did not have to face the Celtics; instead playing the New York Knicks, who defeated them 4–3.[75][76] The next season the Lakers were defeated by the Milwaukee Bucks, led by future Laker Lew Alcindor (now known as Kareem Abdul-Jabbar) in the Western Conference Finals.[77] The 1971–72 season brought several changes. Owner Jack Kent Cooke brought in Bill Sharman as head coach,[78] and Elgin Baylor announced his retirement early in the season after realizing that his legs were not healthy enough.[78] Sharman increased the team's discipline.[79] He introduced the concept of the shootaround, where players would arrive at the arena early in the morning before a game to practice shots.[80] They won 14 straight games in November and all 16 games played in December.[78] They won three straight to open the year of 1972 but on January 9, the Milwaukee Bucks ended their winning streak by defeating the Lakers, 120–104.[81] By winning 33 straight games, Los Angeles set a record for longest winning streak of any team in major American professional team sports.[82][83] The Lakers won 69 games that season, which stood as the NBA record for 24 years until the Chicago Bulls won 72 games in 1995–96.[84] Chamberlain averaged a low 14.8 points but led the league in rebounding at 19.2 a game.[85] West's 9.7 assists per game (apg) led the league, he also averaged more than 25 points, and was named MVP of the 1972 NBA All-Star Game.[85] The team failed to score 100 points just once all year,[86] and at the end of the season, Bill Sharman was named Coach of the Year.[87] The Lakers went on to reach the finals against the New York Knicks where they would avenge their 1970 finals loss by defeating them 4 games to 1. Chamberlain tallied 24 points and 29 rebounds in game five and won the NBA Finals Most Valuable Player Award.[88][89] The Lakers won 60 games in the 1972–73 season, and took another Pacific Division title.[90] Wilt Chamberlain, playing in his final season, again led the league in rebounding and set the NBA record for field-goal percentage at 72.7% which stood for several decades.[90] The team defeated the Chicago Bulls in seven games in the conference semifinals, then the Golden State Warriors in five in the Western Division Finals.[90] They played the New York Knicks in the 1973 NBA Finals. Los Angeles took the first game by three points, but New York won the series in five games.[91] During the 1973–74 season, the team was hampered by the loss of West, who played only 31 games before his legs gave out.[92] Goodrich, averaging 25.3 points, helped the team to a late-season surge.[92] Trailing the Golden State Warriors by three games with seven left to play, the Lakers rallied to finish 47–35 and win the Pacific Division.[92] They made the playoffs but managed just one win against Milwaukee in the conference semifinals. Following the season, West retired due to contract disagreements with Cooke, and filed a suit for unpaid back wages.[93] After missing the playoffs in the 1974–75 season, the Lakers acquired Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, who had won three league MVPs by that time.[94] Abdul-Jabbar wanted out of Milwaukee, demanding a trade to either New York or Los Angeles.[95] He was traded for Elmore Smith, Brian Winters, Junior Bridgeman, and Dave Meyers. Abdul-Jabbar had his fourth MVP season in 1975–76, leading the league in rebounding, blocked shots, and minutes played.[96] The Lakers struggled in January, going 3–10, and finished out of the playoffs at 40–42.[96] West and Cooke settled their differences—and the former Laker's lawsuit—and Cooke hired him to replace Sharman as the team's coach.[97] West became upset, however, when Cooke refused to spend the money necessary to acquire forward Julius Erving, who the Nets were selling.[98] Behind another MVP season from Abdul-Jabbar, Los Angeles won the Pacific Division, finishing the 1976–77 season a league-best 53–29.[99] They defeated the Warriors in a seven-game series to open the postseason before being swept by Portland in the Western Conference Finals.[96] During the off-season, Los Angeles picked up Jamaal Wilkes from Golden State and signed first-round draft pick Norm Nixon. In the first two minutes of the first game of the 1977–78 season, Abdul-Jabbar punched Bucks center Kent Benson for an overly aggressive elbow and broke his hand.[100] Two months later, a healthy Abdul-Jabbar got into an altercation with Houston Rockets center Kevin Kunnert after a rebound. The team's starting power forward, Kermit Washington, who was averaging 11.5 points and 11.2 rebounds,[101] entered the fight, and when Rudy Tomjanovich ran in from the bench to break up the action, Washington punched him in the face.[102] Tomjanovich nearly died from the punch, suffering a fractured skull and other facial injuries, which prematurely ended his playing career.[103] Washington, who stated that he assumed Tomjanovich was a combatant, was suspended for two months by the NBA, and released by the Lakers.[104] The team won 45 games despite being down a starter in Washington and not having Abdul-Jabbar for nearly two months, but lost in the first round of the playoffs to Seattle.[105] During the 1978–79 season, the team posted a 47–35 record but lost to the SuperSonics in the semifinal round of the playoffs.[96] In the 1979 NBA draft, Los Angeles selected 6-foot, 9-inch point guard Magic Johnson from Michigan State with the first overall pick.[106] It took Johnson's teammates time to acclimate themselves to his passing ability, as his \"no-look\" passes often caught them unaware. Once they adjusted, his passing became a key part of Los Angeles' offense.[107] The Lakers won 60 games in Johnson's rookie year, and defeated the Philadelphia 76ers in six games in the 1980 NBA Finals. Johnson won the Finals MVP award, after starting at center for the injured Abdul-Jabbar in game six, and tallying 42 points, 15 rebounds, and seven assists.[108] The team fell off in the 1980–81 season, though, as the Lakers lost Johnson for most of the season to a knee injury.[109] The team turned in a 54–28 record and finished second behind the Phoenix Suns in the Pacific Division.[109] The Rockets, led by Moses Malone, defeated Los Angeles in the first round of the playoffs.[109] Early in the 1981–82 season, Johnson complained to the media about head coach Paul Westhead and demanded a trade.[110] Westhead was fired shortly after Johnson's criticisms, and although Lakers' owner Jerry Buss stated that Johnson's comments did not factor into the decision, Johnson was vilified by the national media and booed both on the road and at home.[111][112][113] Buss promoted assistant coach Pat Riley to \"co-head coach\" with Jerry West (although West considered himself Riley's assistant) on November 19 and the team won 17 of its next 20 games.[109][114][115] Nicknamed \"Showtime\" due to the team's new Johnson-led fast break-offense, the Lakers won the Pacific Division title and swept both the Suns and Spurs in the 1982 playoffs.[116] Los Angeles stretched its postseason winning streak to nine games by taking the first contest of the NBA Finals from the 76ers.[109][117] The team won the Finals 4–2 to finish a 12–2 playoff run.[109] On draft night in 1982, the Lakers had the first overall pick (the result of a trade with Cleveland midway through the 1979–80 season, when the Lakers had sent Don Ford and a 1980 first-round pick to the Cavaliers for Butch Lee and their 1982 selection) and selected James Worthy from North Carolina.[118] The Lakers won the Pacific Division at 58–24, but Worthy suffered a leg injury in the last week of the season and missed the rest of the season.[119] Nevertheless, they advanced to play Philadelphia in the 1983 NBA Finals after defeating Portland and San Antonio.[119] The Sixers, however, won the series and the championship in four games.[118] After the season West replaced Sharman as the team's GM.[120] In the 1983–84 season, Los Angeles went 54–28, and played Boston in the Finals for the first time since 1969.[121] The Lakers won two of the first three games. However, Kevin McHale's hard clothesline foul of Lakers forward Kurt Rambis on a fast break is credited as a turning point of the series.[122] Boston won three of the next four to win the title and send Los Angeles's record to 0–8 in Finals series against the Celtics.[121] Using the past year's Finals defeat as motivation, the team won the Pacific Division for the fourth straight year and lost just two games in the Western Conference playoffs. In the NBA Finals, the Celtics were again the Lakers' final hurdle. Los Angeles lost game one of the NBA Finals by a score of 148–114, in what is remembered as the \"Memorial Day Massacre\".[123] The Lakers, behind 38-year-old Finals MVP Abdul-Jabbar, recovered to defeat the Celtics in six games.[124] The team won the title in the Boston Garden and became the first visiting team to ever win an NBA championship in Boston, as the Golden State Warriors later achieved this feat in 2022.[123] In the 1985–86 season, the Lakers started 24–3 and went on to win 62 games and their fifth straight division title.[126] The Rockets, however, defeated the Lakers in five games in the Western Conference Finals. Houston won the series when Ralph Sampson hit a 20-foot jumper as time expired in game five at The Forum.[126] Prior to the 1986–87 season, the Lakers moved A.C. Green into the starting lineup, and acquired Mychal Thompson from the Spurs.[127] Johnson won his first career MVP Award while leading the Lakers to a 65–17 record,[127] and Michael Cooper was named NBA Defensive Player of the Year.[127] Before the season, Riley had made the decision to shift the focus of the offense to Johnson over the 40-year-old Abdul-Jabbar.[128] The Lakers advanced to the NBA Finals by sweeping the Nuggets, defeating the Warriors in five games, and sweeping the SuperSonics in the Western Conference Finals.[129] The Lakers defeated Boston in the first two games of the Finals, and the teams split the next four games, giving Los Angeles their second championship in three seasons.[127] The series was highlighted by Johnson's running \"baby hook\" shot to win game four at Boston Garden with two seconds remaining.[130] Johnson was named the NBA Finals MVP, in addition to regular season MVP.[131] At the Lakers' championship celebration in Los Angeles, coach Riley brashly declared that Los Angeles would repeat as NBA champions,[127] which no team had done since the 1968–69 Boston Celtics. Looking to make good on Riley's promise in the 1987–88 season, the Lakers took their seventh consecutive Pacific Division title with a 62–20 record. They swept the Spurs in the first round of the Western Conference Finals before pulling out a tough seven-game series win over the Utah Jazz led by youngsters Karl Malone and John Stockton. A seven-game Western Conference finals win over the Dallas Mavericks propelled the Lakers to the NBA Finals once again. In their seventh trip to the Finals in nine years, they met the Detroit Pistons. Los Angeles would take the series in seven games, and James Worthy's game seven triple-double earned him a Finals MVP award.[132] The win marked their fifth title in nine years, but would also mark their last title until 2000. In the 1988–89 season, Los Angeles won 57 games and their eighth consecutive Pacific Division crown. They swept through the playoffs defeating Portland, Seattle, and Phoenix. In an eighth trip to the NBA Finals in 10 years, they once again faced the Detroit Pistons.[133] Hampered by injuries to Byron Scott and Johnson, the Lakers were swept by Detroit.[134] Following the 1989 Finals, on June 28, 1989, after 20 professional seasons, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar announced his retirement. The Lakers still cruised through the Pacific Division, winning their ninth consecutive division crown with a 63–19 record. However, after beating the Rockets in the first round, they lost four games to one in the second round of the playoffs to the Suns.[135] Riley announced he was stepping down after the season citing burnout,[136] and was replaced by Mike Dunleavy.[137] Riley's departure received a mixed reaction from the players. They respected his contributions, but some, such as Worthy and Scott, had grown tired of his intense practices and felt he tried to take too much credit for the team's successes.[138] Following the season, 1987 Defensive Player of the Year winner Michael Cooper decided to play in Europe and was waived at his request.[139] The 1990–91 Lakers failed to win the Pacific Division for the first time in 10 years, but still finished with a 58–24 record. After cruising through the Western Conference playoffs, the Lakers found themselves in the NBA Finals once again, their ninth trip to the Finals in 12 years. The 1991 Finals represented a changing of the guard as the Lakers were defeated in five games by the Chicago Bulls, led by superstar Michael Jordan.[140] On November 7, 1991, Magic Johnson announced he had tested positive for HIV and would retire immediately.[141] In their first season without Johnson, the team won 43 games to earn the eighth seed in the Western Conference playoffs.[37] The Lakers were defeated in the first round by Portland. Following the season, head coach Mike Dunleavy was fired. The Lakers would lose 43 games in 1992–93 under Randy Pfund, their first losing season since 1976. The Lakers would still make the playoffs, and would become the first eighth seed to win the opening two games on the road against a number one seed when they took a 2–0 lead against Phoenix.[142] They lost the next two games at home however, then game five in Phoenix in overtime.[142] During the 1993–94 season, Pfund was fired during the season that would result in the Lakers failing to make the playoffs for the first time since 1976. Magic Johnson, would coach the final 16 games of the season with former teammate Michael Cooper as his lead assistant.[143] Johnson decided not to take the job permanently due to what he felt was a lack of commitment from certain players, and Los Angeles ended the season with a 10-game losing streak to finish 33–49.[144][145] Under new coach Del Harris, Los Angeles made the playoffs each of the next two seasons but was eliminated in the second and first rounds respectively.[146][147] The team was led by young guards Nick Van Exel and Eddie Jones.[148] Johnson came out of retirement to return as a player in the 1995–96 season to lead the then 24–18 Lakers to a 29–11 finish.[149] After some run-ins with Van Exel, displeasure with Harris's strategies, and a first-round loss to the Rockets, Johnson decided to retire for the final time after the season.[150] During the 1996 off-season, the Lakers acquired 17-year-old Kobe Bryant from the Charlotte Hornets for Vlade Divac; Bryant was drafted 13th overall out of Lower Merion High School in Ardmore, Pennsylvania in that year's draft, by Charlotte. Los Angeles also signed free-agent Shaquille O'Neal.[151] Trading for Bryant was West's idea, and he was influential in the team's signing of the all-star center.[152] \"Jerry West is the reason I came to the Lakers\", O'Neal later said.[153] They used their 24th pick in the draft to select Derek Fisher.[154] During the season, the team traded Cedric Ceballos to Phoenix for Robert Horry.[155] O'Neal led the team to a 56–26 record, their best effort since 1990–91, despite missing 31 games due to a knee injury.[156] O'Neal averaged 26.2 ppg and 12.5 rpg and finished third in the league in blocked shots (2.88 bpg) in 51 games.[156][157] The Lakers defeated the Portland Trail Blazers in the first round of the playoffs as O'Neal scored 46 points in Game 1 against the Trail Blazers, marking the highest single-game playoff scoring output by a Laker since Jerry West scored 53 against the Celtics in 1969.[156] In the next round, the Lakers lost in five games to the Utah Jazz.[156] In the 1997–98 season, O'Neal and the Lakers had the best start in franchise history, 11–0.[158] O'Neal would miss 20 games on the season due to an abdominal injury.[158] Los Angeles battled Seattle for the Pacific Division title most of the season. In the final two months, the Lakers won 22 of their final 25 games,[158] finishing 61–21, but still finished second to Seattle in the standings.[158] The Lakers defeated Portland three games to one in the first round to advance to face Seattle. Although the Sonics won the first game, the Lakers responded with four straight wins, taking the series,[158] but were swept by the Jazz in the Western Conference Finals.[158] During the 1998–99 season, All-Star guard Eddie Jones and center Elden Campbell were traded to the Charlotte Hornets.[159] The team also acquired J. R. Reid, B. J. Armstrong, and Glen Rice.[160] Head coach Del Harris was fired in February after a three-game losing streak and replaced on an interim basis by former Laker Kurt Rambis.[161] The team finished 31–19 in the strike-shortened season, which was fourth in the Western Conference.[162] The Lakers defeated Houston in the first round of the playoffs, but were swept by San Antonio in the next round. Game four of the series would be the last game ever played at the Great Western Forum.[163] Before the 1999–2000 season, West was prepared to hire Rambis as the team's full-time coach before an outcry from fans and members of the organization caused him to seek out a bigger name.[164] Los Angeles hired former Chicago Bulls coach Phil Jackson, who had coached that team to six championships, and gave him a lucrative $6 million a year contract.[165] He brought along assistant Tex Winter and they installed Winter's version of the triangle offense.[166] The Lakers signed veterans Brian Shaw, John Salley, Ron Harper, and A.C. Green, who was a Laker during the \"Showtime\" era.[155] The team also moved to a new arena, the Staples Center.[167] Led by league MVP O'Neal, the Lakers won 31 of their first 36 games.[168] They finished 67–15, the highest win total since they won 65 in the 1986–87 season.[168] Then eliminated Sacramento and Phoenix in the first two rounds of the playoffs.[169] After the Lakers took a three games to one lead in the Western Conference Finals against Portland, the Trail Blazers won the next two games to force a game seven.[170] The Lakers, who trailed by 15 points in the fourth quarter, would go on 19–4 run to tie the game and eventually win 89–84 to advance to the NBA Finals.[170] In their first trip to the Finals since 1991, the Lakers defeated Reggie Miller and the Indiana Pacers four games to two win their first title since 1988.[171] West retired from his spot in the team's front office after the season after a power struggle between him and Jackson over control of the team's operations.[172] After the season, starters Rice and Green left the team,[173] and Los Angeles signed Horace Grant.[174] The following season, the Lakers won 11 fewer regular season games than the prior year,[175] but swept the first three rounds of the playoffs, defeating the Portland, Sacramento, and San Antonio.[176] They met Allen Iverson and the Philadelphia 76ers in the NBA Finals. Although the Sixers took game one in overtime,[177] the Lakers won the next four games to win their second straight title. Their 15–1 postseason record was the best in NBA history.[178] The Lakers won 58 games in 2001–02. In the playoffs, they swept Portland and defeated San Antonio four games to one to advance to the Western Conference Finals to face Sacramento.[181] The series would go on to be known as one of the greatest playoff matchups in NBA history. The series extended to all seven games and ended in a Lakers victory.[182] In game one, Bryant scored 30 points as the Lakers won, 106–99. The series would then shift in Sacramento's favor, with the Kings winning the next two games. Facing a deficit in game 4, the Lakers had the ball with under 20 seconds to play. After misses by both Bryant and O'Neal, Kings center Vlade Divac tapped the ball away from the rim in an attempt to wind down the clock. It went straight into Robert Horry's hands, who drained a game-winning three with under three seconds to play. After the Kings won game five on a buzzer-beater by Mike Bibby, the Lakers were faced with a must-win game six. In one of the most controversial playoff games in league history (Tim Donaghy's betting scandal), the Lakers would win by four points.[183] The Lakers went on to win game seven in overtime, with the Kings missing numerous potentially game-saving shots and free throws. The Lakers then achieved a three-peat by sweeping Jason Kidd and the New Jersey Nets in the NBA Finals.[184] O'Neal won each of the Finals series' MVP awards, making him the only player besides Michael Jordan to win three consecutive Finals MVPs.[185] The Lakers would attempt a four-peat the following year, but started the 2002–03 season 11–19.[186] However, they finished the season 39–13 to finish 50–32.[187] They defeated Minnesota in the first round of the playoffs, but the four-peat attempt ended as they were eliminated by San Antonio in six games in the second round.[188] During the 2003–04 season, the team was the subject of intense media coverage generated by the teaming of four stars and the sexual-assault case involving Kobe Bryant.[189][190] Before the season, the Lakers signed two-time MVP Karl Malone formerly of the Jazz, and former Seattle Defensive Player of the Year Gary Payton to join O'Neal and Bryant,[191] forming the first \"superteam\" of the 21st century.[192][193] Three of the \"big four\", however, struggled with injuries: O'Neal suffered from a strained calf, Malone an injured knee, and Bryant an injured shoulder.[194][195] The Lakers started 18–3 and finished 56–26 and won the Pacific Division title, entering the playoffs as the No. 2 seed. They defeated Houston, San Antonio, and Minnesota to advance to the NBA Finals.[196] In the Finals, they would lose to Detroit in five games. During the 2004 off-season, the team entered a rebuilding phase when O'Neal was traded to the Miami Heat for Lamar Odom, Brian Grant, Caron Butler, and a first-round draft pick.[197] Bryant and O'Neal had clashed in the past,[198] and the media credited their feud as one of the motivating factors for the trade.[199] Jackson did not return as head coach, and wrote a book about the team's 2003–04 season, in which he heavily criticized Bryant and called him \"uncoachable\".[200][201][202] The Lakers front office said that the book contained \"several inaccuracies\".[203] The Lakers also traded Rick Fox and Gary Payton to Boston, for Chris Mihm, Marcus Banks, and Chucky Atkins before the 2004–05 season.[204] Derek Fisher, frustrated with losing playing time, opted out of his contract and signed with the Warriors.[204] The team hired Rudy Tomjanovich to replace Jackson.[204] After sitting out the first half of the 2004–05 season, Malone announced his retirement on February 13, 2005.[205] Tomjanovich coached the team to a 22–19 record before resigning due to health problems.[206] Assistant Frank Hamblen was named interim head coach to replace Tomjanovich for the remainder of the season.[207] Bryant (ankle) and Odom (shoulder) suffered injuries, and the Lakers finished 34–48, missing the playoffs for only the fifth time in franchise history and the first time since 1994.[37] With the tenth overall pick in the 2005 NBA draft, the Lakers selected Andrew Bynum, a center from St. Joseph High School in Metuchen, New Jersey.[208] The team also traded Caron Butler and Chucky Atkins to Washington for Kwame Brown and Laron Profit.[209] Jackson returned to coach the team after Rudy Tomjanovich resigned midway through the previous season.[210] On January 22, 2006, Bryant scored 81 points against Toronto, the second-highest total in NBA history.[211] Ending the season 45–37, the team made the playoffs after a one-season absence.[212] After taking a three games to one lead in the first round, Phoenix came back to take the series in seven games.[213] In the following season, the Lakers won 26 of their first 39 games,[214] but lost 27 of their last 43—including seven in a row at one point—to finish 42–40.[214] They were eliminated in the first round by Phoenix again.[214] Frustrated by the team's inability to advance in the playoffs, Bryant demanded to be traded in the off-season.[215] Buss initially agreed to seek a trade,[216] but also worked to try to change Bryant's mind.[217] After re-acquiring Derek Fisher, the Lakers started the 2007–08 season with a 25–11 record, before Andrew Bynum, their center who was leading the league in field-goal percentage, went out for the year due to a knee injury in mid-January.[218] In what would become a crucial transfer for the franchise's return to championship form, they acquired the six-time all-star power forward Pau Gasol from the Memphis Grizzlies in a trade in early February and went 22–5 to finish the season.[219] The Lakers' 57–25 record earned them the first seed in the Western Conference.[220] Bryant was awarded the league's MVP award, becoming the first Laker to win the award since O'Neal in 2000.[221][222] In the playoffs, they defeated the Nuggets in four games, the Jazz in six, and the defending champion Spurs in five, but lost to the Celtics in six games in the NBA Finals.[223] In the 2008–09 season, the Lakers finished 65–17; the best record in the Western Conference.[224] They defeated the Jazz in five games, the Rockets in seven and the Nuggets in six, to win the Western Conference title. They then won their 15th NBA championship by defeating the Orlando Magic in five games in the NBA finals.[225] Bryant was named the NBA Finals MVP for the first time in his career.[226] The Lakers, who had added Ron Artest (Metta World Peace)[227] in place of Trevor Ariza in their starting lineup, finished the 2009–10 season with the best record in the Western Conference for the third straight time. On January 13, 2010, the Lakers became the first team in NBA history to win 3,000 regular-season games by defeating the Dallas Mavericks 100–95.[228] They defeated the Oklahoma City Thunder, the Utah Jazz, and the Phoenix Suns in the Western Conference playoffs. In the finals, the Lakers played the Boston Celtics for the 12th time. They rallied back from a 3–2 disadvantage in the series and erased a 13-point deficit in the fourth quarter of the seventh game to defeat the Celtics. This series win gave them their 16th NBA title overall and 11th since they moved to Los Angeles.[229] Bryant was named Finals MVP for the second year in a row, despite a 6–24 shooting performance in game seven.[230] After much speculation, head coach Phil Jackson returned for the 2010–11 season.[231] In the playoffs, the Lakers defeated the New Orleans Hornets in the first round.[232] But their opportunity for a three-peat was denied by the Dallas Mavericks in a four-game sweep of the second round. After the season, it was announced that Jackson will not be returning to coach the Lakers.[233] After Jackson's retirement, former Cleveland Cavaliers head coach Mike Brown was hired as head coach on May 25, 2011.[234] Before the start of the shortened 2011–12 season, the Lakers traded Lamar Odom to the Dallas Mavericks after Odom requested to be traded.[235] On the trade deadline long time Laker Derek Fisher along with a first round draft pick were traded to the Houston Rockets for Jordan Hill.[236] With a 41–25 regular season record the Lakers entered the playoffs as the third seed, the team defeated the Denver Nuggets in the first round in seven games but were eliminated by the Oklahoma City Thunder in the second round in five games.[237][238] On July 4, 2012, Steve Nash of the Phoenix Suns agreed to a sign-and-trade deal that would send him to the Lakers in exchange for the Lakers' 2013 and 2015 first round draft picks, 2013 and 2014 second round draft picks, and $3 million. The trade was made official on July 11, 2012, the first day the trade moratorium was lifted.[239] On August 10, 2012, in a four-team trade the Lakers traded Andrew Bynum and acquired Dwight Howard.[240] The combination of these players with Bryant and Gasol led media outlets to refer to them as a \"superteam\" comparable to the 2003-04 Lakers.[241][242] On November 9, 2012, Mike Brown was relieved of coaching duties after a 1–4 start to the 2012–13 season.[243] Assistant Coach Bernie Bickerstaff took over as interim head coach, leading the Lakers to a 5–5 record. On November 12, 2012, the Lakers hired Mike D'Antoni as head coach.[244] On February 18, 2013, Lakers owner Jerry Buss died from cancer at age 80.[245] On the court, D'Antoni coached the Lakers to a 40–32 record the rest of the way to finish 45–37, their worst record since 2007. The Lakers clinched a playoff berth on the final game of the season and finished seventh in the Western Conference after beating the Houston Rockets on April 16, 2013.[246][247] The Lakers battled injuries all season, the most prominent of which is the Achilles tendon rupture to Kobe Bryant that ended his season after 78 games. The absence of Bryant was sorely felt as the Lakers were swept by the San Antonio Spurs in the first round of the 2013 NBA playoffs.[248] Nevertheless, Bryant passed Lakers legend Wilt Chamberlain to become the fourth all-time leading scorer in NBA history on March 30, 2013, against the Sacramento Kings.[249] On December 8, 2013, Bryant played in his first game since tearing his Achilles tendon on April 12, 2013.[250] However, on December 17, 2013, he suffered a broken bone in his knee, and did not return for the remainder of the season.[251][252] On March 25, 2014, the Lakers scored 51 points in the third quarter against the New York Knicks, the most points scored in a quarter in the history of the franchise.[253] The Lakers went on to miss the NBA playoffs for the first time since 2005, for just the second time in the last two decades and for just the sixth time in franchise history. On April 30, 2014, Mike D'Antoni resigned from his position as head coach after a 27–55 season.[254] After spending the majority of the off-season without a head coach, the Lakers named former player Byron Scott as the new head coach.[255] After the season, he was the frontrunner to become the new Lakers head coach. Scott interviewed three times for the position, which had become vacant after Mike D'Antoni's resignation.[256] On July 28, 2014, he signed a multi-year contract to coach the Lakers.[257] During the first game of the 2014–15 season, the seventh overall pick in the 2014 NBA draft, Julius Randle went down with a broken leg, which ended his rookie season. The Lakers began their season losing 10 of their first 16 games. After playing only 35 games, Kobe Bryant tore a rotator cuff in his shoulder ending his season. Nick Young was also forced to end his season with a fractured kneecap, leaving the team with a record of 14–41.[258] With 27 games left in the regular season, Byron Scott gave rookie Jordan Clarkson more playing time. Clarkson, the 46th overall pick in the 2014 draft, finished his rookie season with game stats of 11.9 ppg, 3.2 rpg, 3.5 apg, and shooting 44.8% from the field.[259] The Lakers' season ended with a record of 21–61, the fourth worst record in the league and at the time the worst record in franchise history. The next season, the Lakers had the second overall pick of the 2015 NBA draft, which they used to select Ohio State freshman point guard D'Angelo Russell. The team also selected Larry Nance Jr. with the 27th overall pick.[260] On November 30, 2015, Bryant announced he would retire at the end of the season after 20 seasons with the team.[261] In Bryant's last season the team missed the playoffs for the third straight year with a 17–65 record, the worst in franchise history.[262] On April 24, 2016, the Lakers announced that they would not exercise their option on Byron Scott's contract for the following season.[263] On April 29, the team announced another former Laker, Luke Walton, as their new head coach. At the time of his hiring, Walton was an assistant coach for the Golden State Warriors, who were in the playoffs, so he could not officially begin his duties as head coach until the Warriors' playoff run was over.[264] The Lakers earned the second overall pick in the 2016 NBA draft,[265] and selected Brandon Ingram from Duke University.[266] The team also selected Ivica Zubac with the 32nd overall pick.[267] On February 21, 2017, the Lakers fired general manager Mitch Kupchak, while Magic Johnson was named as the president of basketball operations. The team's governor Jeanie Buss, also announced the removal of her brother, Jim Buss, from his position as executive vice president of basketball operations.[268][269] On March 7, 2017, the Lakers hired Rob Pelinka as the general manager, signing him to a five-year deal.[270] The Lakers again earned the second overall pick, this time, in the 2017 NBA draft,[271] and selected Lonzo Ball from UCLA.[272] The Lakers also acquired Kyle Kuzma from the University of Utah with the 27th overall pick from a draft-day trade, along with Brook Lopez in exchange for D'Angelo Russell and Timofey Mozgov.[273] The Lakers also traded their 28th overall pick, Tony Bradley, in exchange for the 30th overall pick, Josh Hart, from Villanova University and the 42nd overall pick, Thomas Bryant, from Indiana University.[274] In February 2018, Nance Jr. and Clarkson were traded away to the Cleveland Cavaliers in exchange for Isaiah Thomas, Channing Frye, and a 2018 first-round draft pick.[275] On July 2, 2018, Randle was renounced by the Lakers.[276] On July 9, 2018, the Lakers signed LeBron James to a four-year, $154 million contract.[277][278] By the Christmas Day game, the Lakers were six games over .500 before James sustained a groin injury leading to several weeks of missed games. Ball and Ingram also ended their seasons early due to injuries. On February 7, 2019, Zubac was traded to the Los Angeles Clippers along with Michael Beasley in exchange for Mike Muscala.[279] On April 9, 2019, Johnson stepped down as the team's president of basketball operations,[280] and two days later, the Lakers parted ways with head coach Walton after the team failed to reach the playoffs for the sixth straight year.[281] On May 13, Frank Vogel was named the Lakers' head coach.[282] The Lakers received the fourth overall pick in the 2019 NBA draft lottery.[283] On July 6, the Lakers acquired Anthony Davis from the New Orleans Pelicans for Ball, Ingram, Hart, and three first-round picks, including the number four overall in the 2019 draft.[284] This trade officially ended the young core era of the Lakers; only Kuzma remained out of the group of players. Following the suspension of the 2019–20 NBA season, the Lakers were one of the 22 teams invited to the NBA Bubble to participate in the final eight games of the regular season.[285] The Lakers finished the regular season with a 52–19 record, entering the playoffs for the first time since 2013,[286] and as the top seed for the first time since 2010.[287] They advanced to the NBA Finals for the first time since 2010.[288] They defeated the Miami Heat 4–2 to win the 2020 NBA Finals,[289] and James was named the Finals MVP for the fourth time in his career.[290] The win gave Los Angeles their 17th championship in franchise history, tying the Boston Celtics for the most all-time.[291] Primary Lakers owner Jeanie Buss, who took over the team in 2017, would also become the first female controlling owner of an NBA team to win the NBA Finals.[292] During the 2021 off-season, the Lakers picked up many NBA veterans, the most notable of which was Russell Westbrook, who was acquired in a blockbuster trade with the Washington Wizards. Kyle Kuzma, the last player left from the Lakers' young core era, was traded away, along with others. Other veterans picked up during the off-season included Carmelo Anthony, DeAndre Jordan, and returning players Wayne Ellington, Trevor Ariza, Dwight Howard and Rajon Rondo.[293] Alex Caruso left the Lakers and signed with the Chicago Bulls, and veteran locker-room voice Jared Dudley retired.[294][295] The Lakers made a surprising run in the 2023 Playoffs, making the Western Conference Finals, but were defeated by the eventual champion Denver Nuggets. On December 9, 2023, the Lakers won the inaugural NBA In-Season Tournament after defeating the Indiana Pacers in the championship game. James was named the inaugural tournament MVP.[296] They finished the 2023–24 season 47–35 and beat the New Orleans Pelicans in the Play-In to make the playoffs as the seventh seed. On June 27, 2024, the Lakers selected Bronny James, the son of LeBron, at 55th overall in the 2024 NBA draft, forming the first father-son duo in NBA history.[297] JJ Redick was hired as head coach of the Lakers.[298] On October 23, 2024, the team made NBA history as being the first one to have father and son (LeBron James & Bronny James) play together as they beat Minnesota Timberwolves on their season opening game.[299] The rivalry between the Boston Celtics and the Lakers involves the two most storied basketball franchises in National Basketball Association (NBA) history. It has been called the best rivalry in the NBA.[300] The two teams have met a record 12 times in the NBA Finals, starting with their first Finals meeting in 1959. They would go on to dominate the league in the 1960s and the 1980s, facing each other six times in the 1960s and three times in the 1980s. The rivalry had been less intense since the retirements of Magic Johnson and Larry Bird in the early 1990s, but in 2008 it was renewed as the Celtics and Lakers met in the Finals for the first time since 1987, with the Celtics winning the series 4–2. They faced off once again in the 2010 NBA Finals, which the Lakers won in 7 games. The two teams were tied for the highest number of championships, with 17 titles apiece, until the Celtics surpassed this record in the 2024 NBA Finals; together, the 35 championships account for almost half of the 78 championships in NBA history. The all-time series record for the Lakers vs Celtics is 209–165 with the Celtics being the forerunners. Boston is the only NBA team with an overall winning record against the Lakers.[301] The rivalry between the Lakers and the Detroit Pistons developed in the late 1980s.[302]: 228 Both teams faced each other in back-to-back finals appearances in the 1988 NBA Finals, which the Lakers won in 7 games and the 1989 NBA Finals, which the Pistons won in 4 games. The rivalry reemerged in the early 2000s as both teams squared off against one another in the 2004 NBA Finals, which the Pistons won in five games. The Lakers have a lengthy history with the Golden State Warriors as both franchises relocated to California during the early 1960s. Geography does play a minor role in the rivalry; however there exists more respect between both teams and fans alike, unlike the Dodgers–Giants rivalry of MLB, or the 49ers–Rams rivalry of the NFL in which both teams express fierce animosity against one another.[303][304] The rivalry began to sprout during the 1970s as the two teams would meet six times in the postseason from 1967 to 1991. Both teams fluctuated in success at varying times, however; the Lakers recent rise following the signing of LeBron James contributed heavily to adding a level of competition between both sides as James had previously faced the Warriors in four straight finals as a member of the Cavaliers. Both teams have met seven times in the postseason, combining for 38 division titles since both teams relocated to California in the early 1960s.[305][306] The Lakers lead the all time regular season series 262–173, and the postseason series 25–11.[307][308] The rivalry between the Lakers and the Los Angeles Clippers is unique because they were the only two NBA teams to share an arena, the Crypto.com Arena. It is also one of only two intra-city rivalries in the NBA, the other being the new crosstown rivalry between the New York Knicks and Brooklyn Nets. Los Angeles fans have historically favored the Lakers.[309][310] Some contend that the term rivalry was inaccurate until the Clippers became more successful.[311] The Lakers and the Phoenix Suns rivalry didn't develop until the 2000s where the teams were led by Kobe Bryant and Steve Nash, respectively. The San Antonio Spurs and the Lakers, developed what some would classify as a rivalry in the late 1990s and early 2000s. Since 1999, the teams have met in the NBA Playoffs five times, with the clubs combining to appear in seven consecutive NBA Finals (from 1999 to 2005). Additionally, the teams combined to win five NBA championships from 1999 to 2003; the Spurs won the NBA championship in 1999, 2003, 2005, 2007 and 2014 while the Lakers won the championship in 2000, 2001, 2002, 2009 and 2010. From 1999 to 2004 the clubs' rivalry was often considered the premier rivalry in the NBA,[312] and each time the clubs faced each other in the playoffs the winner advanced to the NBA Finals. In 2008, the teams met again in the Western Conference Finals where the Spurs were handily defeated only to beat the Lakers when they met again in 2013. The Kings and the Lakers have faced each other in the playoffs nine times between 1949 and 2002, and since the Kings moved to Sacramento in 1985, both have been based in California. The 2002 Western Conference Finals was one of the most bitterly contested in NBA history, with many controversial calls in game 6.[313] The Lakers would win the series in game 7. Berger and Chalfen purchased the NBL's disbanded Detroit Gems for $15,000 in 1947, changed their name to the Lakers, and relocated them to Minnesota. Max Winter bought a third of the club in their early years and sold his share to Mikan in 1954. Berger bought Mikan's share in 1956 giving him a controlling (⅔) interest.[314] After Mikan retired, attendance plummeted and the team lost money for several seasons, leading the ownership group to put the team up for sale in 1957.[315] Marty Marion, a retired baseball player and manager, and his business partner Milton Fischman attempted to purchase the team with the intention of moving the club to Kansas City, Missouri.[315][316] Mikan offered to mortgage his home in an attempt to buy the team and keep the club in Minnesota.[317] The Lakers were sold to a group of investors led by Bob Short, however.[314] The team was sold to Short's group with the agreement that it would not be relocated to Kansas City but kept in Minnesota.[318] Short's ownership group consisted of 117 Minnesota businesses and private citizens, who amassed a total of $200,000 for the purchase; $150,000 to buy the team and $50,000 to run it.[314] By 1958 Short had become 80% owner of the team by buying out his partners,[314] but the team was floundering. Attendance remained poor, and the NBA had put the Lakers on \"financial probation\", notifying them that if they did not meet certain ticket sales numbers they could be bought out by the league and relocated. Short was forced to move the team to Los Angeles in 1960; the club had lost $60,000 in the first half of the 1959–60 season alone.[319] The NBA's owners originally voted 7–1 against the move.[320] When Short indicated that he might take the team to a new rival league that was developing, however, the owners held another vote that same day and allowed the relocation (8–0).[321] Aided by Baylor's drawing power,[322][323] and the new locale, the team's finances improved when they arrived in LA.[324][325] Short sold the team to Washington Redskins owner and publisher Jack Kent Cooke in 1965 for a then league record amount of $5.175 million.[326] Short insisted the deal be conducted in cash as he was wary of Cooke, so guards transported the money in a cart from one New York bank to another.[327] Cooke was a more hands-on owner than Short, and overhauled the team's operations.[328] He personally financed construction of the Forum in 1967 at a cost of $16.5 million.[329][330] He owned the team until 1979 when he sold it, the NHL's Los Angeles Kings, the Forum, and some real estate to Jerry Buss for $67 million.[331] Cooke was forced to sell the team as he was undergoing a costly divorce.[332][333] Buss was a local chemical engineer and former University of Southern California professor who had become wealthy in real estate.[330][334] Philip Anschutz bought a stake in the team in 1998,[335] and until October 2010 Magic Johnson was a minority owner as well.[336] Buss started the trend of allowing sponsors to add their name to team's stadiums when he renamed the Forum the Great Western Forum in 1988.[337] In 2009 major sponsors included Verizon Wireless, Toyota, Anheuser-Busch, American Express, and Carl's Jr., and the team's $113 average ticket price was the highest in the league.[335] In 2013, Buss died at the age of 80 after being hospitalized for 18 months with cancer.[338][339][340] His controlling ownership of the team passed to his six children via a trust, with each child receiving an equal vote.[341][342] Buss' succession plan had daughter Jeanie Buss assume his title as the Lakers' governor as well as its team representative at NBA Board of Governors meetings.[342][343] Given the team's proximity to Hollywood, the Lakers fanbase includes numerous celebrities, many of whom can be seen at the Staples Center during home games.[344] Jack Nicholson, for example, has held season tickets since the 1970s, and directors reportedly need to work their shooting schedules around Lakers home games.[345] From 2002 and 2007 the team averaged just over 18,900 fans, which placed them in the top ten in the NBA in attendance. Red Hot Chili Peppers' song \"Magic Johnson\", from their 1989 album Mother's Milk, is a tribute to the former point guard, and frontman Anthony Kiedis and bassist Michael \"Flea\" Balzary are frequently seen attending home games.[346] In 2008, the team sold out every home game,[347] and in 2010, the Lakers had the most popular team merchandise among all NBA teams, and Bryant the most popular jersey.[348] The Laker nickname came from the state of Minnesota being the Land of 10,000 Lakes.[14][349] The team's colors are purple, gold and white.[350][6][351] The Lakers logo consists of the team name, \"Los Angeles Lakers\" written in purple on top of a gold basketball. The team usually wears white jerseys for Sunday and holiday home games.[350][352] List of the last five seasons completed by the Lakers. For the full season-by-season history, see List of Los Angeles Lakers seasons. The Lakers have won 17 NBA titles and have appeared in the NBA Finals 15 other times.[37] These appearances include eight NBA Finals appearances in the 1980s. The best record posted by the team was 69–13, in 1972; the worst record was 17–65, in 2016.[37] Note: GP = Games played, W = Wins, L = Losses, W–L% = Winning percentage Bryant holds most individual team records for longevity including most games played (1,333), and most minutes logged (48,298). Johnson holds all significant assist records for the club including career assists (10,141), assists in a game (24), and highest assist average for a season (13.1). Johnson also has the most triple doubles, with his 138 over 100 more than the next closest player (Bryant; 17). Elmore Smith holds team records for blocks in a game (17), blocks per game for a season (4.85), and career blocks per game (3.93). The scoring records are mostly shared by Elgin Baylor and Bryant, with Baylor having the highest average for a career (27.4) while Bryant has the highest points scored in a single game (81). Baylor, Bryant and West hold the top five single-season scoring averages, with Bryant occupying the first (35.4) and fourth (31.6) spots, while Baylor has the second (34.8), and third (34.0), and West the fifth (31.3).[353][354] The Lakers hold several NBA records as a team including most consecutive games won overall (33) and most consecutive road games won (16), both of which came during the 1971–72 season,[355] highest field-goal percentage for a season at 54.5% (1984–85),[356] and highest road winning percentage at 0.816 (1971–72).[66] They also hold records for having (into the 2009–10 season) the most wins (3,027), the highest winning percentage (61.9%), and the most NBA Finals appearances (31).[37][357] The 2000–01 team set the NBA record for best playoff record at 15–1, which was later broken by the Golden State Warriors in 2017.[358] The 1971–72 team holds franchise records in wins (69), most points scored, and largest margin of victory; both of the latter came in the team's 63 point win versus Golden State (162–99).[359] They also held the record for most wins at home in the regular season (going 36–5 in 1971–72, then 37–4 in both 1976–77 and 1979–80) unil the Boston Celtics set the current record of 40–1 in the 1985–86 season. The Lakers play their home games at Crypto.com Arena, located at L.A. Live in downtown Los Angeles. The arena opened in fall 1999 and seats up to 18,997 for Lakers games.[360] Owned and operated by AEG and L.A. Arena Company, the arena is also home to the Los Angeles Clippers, the WNBA's Los Angeles Sparks, and the NHL's Los Angeles Kings.[360] Before moving to Staples Center, for 32 seasons (1967–1999), the Lakers played their home games at The Forum in Inglewood, California, located approximately 10 miles southwest of the team's current home.[167] During the 1999 preseason, the Lakers played their home games at the Forum before officially moving into Crypto.com Arena, and once again hosted a preseason game versus the Golden State Warriors on October 9, 2009, this time to commemorate the team's 50th-anniversary season in Los Angeles.[361] In the first seven years in Los Angeles, the team played their home games at the Los Angeles Memorial Sports Arena, south of downtown Los Angeles.[362] While the team played in Minneapolis, the team played their home games at the Minneapolis Auditorium and the Minneapolis Armory from 1947 to 1960.[363] Roster Last transaction: December 29, 2024 The Lakers hold the draft rights to the following unsigned draft picks who have been playing outside the NBA.[364] A drafted player, either an international draftee or a college draftee who is not signed by the team that drafted him, is allowed to sign with any non-NBA teams. In this case, the team retains the player's draft rights in the NBA until one year after the player's contract with the non-NBA team ends.[365] This list includes draft rights that were acquired from trades with other teams. The Lakers have had three first overall picks in their history: Elgin Baylor (selected in 1958), Magic Johnson (selected in 1979) and James Worthy (selected in 1982).[368] The Lakers have also had six lottery picks in their history: Eddie Jones (selected tenth overall in 1994), Andrew Bynum (selected tenth overall in 2005), Julius Randle (selected seventh overall in 2014), D'Angelo Russell (selected second overall in 2015), Brandon Ingram (selected second overall in 2016) and Lonzo Ball (selected second overall in 2017).[368] Other draft picks include Jerry West and Gail Goodrich in the 1960s, Michael Cooper and Norm Nixon in the 1970s, A.C. Green and Vlade Divac in the 1980s, Elden Campbell, Nick Van Exel, Derek Fisher and Devean George in the 1990s, and Luke Walton, Sasha Vujačić, and Ronny Turiaf in the 2000s.[368] There have been 29 head coaches for the Lakers franchise. John Kundla coached the team in Minneapolis when they won their first five BAA/NBA championships from 1949 to 1954.[52] Pat Riley is second in franchise history in both regular season and playoff games coached and wins.[369] Phil Jackson broke Riley's regular-season wins record in 2009, and he passed Riley's playoff wins and games coached records in 2010.[369] Jackson, Riley, Kundla, and Bill Sharman have all been inducted into the Basketball Hall of Fame for their coaching careers. George Mikan, Jim Pollard, Jerry West, Pat Riley, Magic Johnson, Kurt Rambis, Byron Scott and Luke Walton have all played and head-coached for the Lakers. Jackson, who had two stints as head coach, was coach from 2005 to 2011. In May 2011, Mike Brown was named his replacement for the 2011–12 season.[370] Brown was fired[371] on November 9, 2012, after a 1–4 start. Assistant coach Bernie Bickerstaff served as interim head coach for five games before the Lakers selected Mike D'Antoni as their new head coach. D'Antoni resigned at the end of the 2013–14 season. In July 2014, Byron Scott was hired as head coach.[372] After the 2015–16 season ended, Scott was fired. On April 29, 2016, former Lakers player Luke Walton was named as Scott's replacement,[373] and served as head coach until the end of the 2018–19 season.[374] Frank Vogel was named his successor on a multiyear deal announced on May 13, 2019.[375] Vogel was fired following the conclusion of the 2021–22 season.[376] On June 6, 2022, Darvin Ham was named as Vogel's successor as head coach.[377] However, Ham was fired by the Lakers on May 3, 2024, after the Lakers were eliminated in Game 5 of the first round by the Denver Nuggets. Among his accomplishments was leading the Lakers to their first In-Season Tournament championship.[378] On June 24, 2024, former NBA player JJ Redick was hired as the 29th coach in team history.[379] The Lakers have 41 Hall of Famers (31 players, 5 head coaches, 1 assistant coach, and 4 contributors) who contributed to the organization.[380][381][382] Notes: The Lakers have retired thirteen jersey numbers and an honorary microphone in honor of their players and broadcaster:[392][393][394][395][396] On January 13, 2025, Michael Cooper will have his #21 jersey retired.[397] In addition, several other players and coaches who were instrumental to the franchise's success during its days in Minneapolis have a banner commemorating them as Hall of Fame members of the Minneapolis Lakers, although jersey numbers for these players are not retired by the franchise:[400] For 41 years, Chick Hearn was the team's broadcaster until his death in 2002. He broadcast 3,338 consecutive games between November 21, 1965, and December 16, 2001.[401] Hearn came up with West's \"Mr. Clutch\" nickname.[402] He was a part of the team's \"inner sanctum\" when Cooke was owner, and was consulted on basketball decisions.[403] Paul Sunderland, who had filled in for a couple of games while Hearn recuperated in the 2001–02 season, was named the permanent play-by-play announcer. Stu Lantz was retained as the color commentator.[404] When Sunderland's contract expired in the summer of 2005, the team chose not to renew it.[405] Then, Joel Meyers moved in alongside Lantz as the television announcer, with Spero Dedes and former Laker player Mychal Thompson on the radio.[406] For the 2011–12 season, Bill Macdonald became the new television play-by-play announcer, joining Lantz who remained as the color analyst. Meanwhile, John Ireland joined Mychal Thompson to call the games on radio.[407] Beginning in the 2009–10 season, Lakers radio broadcasts were heard on KSPN (Los Angeles ESPN Radio affiliate) in English and KWKW in Spanish.[406][408] KLAC had the team's radio broadcast rights from the 1976–77 season until the 2008–09 season.[408][409] Until 2011, telecasts had been split between KCAL-TV (road games) and Fox Sports West (home games), unless they are chosen for national broadcasts on ABC.[410] KCAL had been the Lakers' over-the-air television broadcaster since 1977, dating back to when the station was the RKO General-owned KHJ-TV, the longest relationship between an NBA team and a television station. Prior to KHJ, Laker games were televised on KTLA. The Lakers had been on Fox Sports West since 1985, dating to when it was the original Prime Ticket and owned by Buss.[411] On February 14, 2011, Time Warner Cable and the Lakers announced the formation of two new regional sports networks (one in English, one in Spanish) that would exclusively televise the team's games and related programming for 20 years starting with the 2012–13 season.[412] The said networks were originally known as Time Warner Cable SportsNet, before it was renamed Spectrum SportsNet in 2016 upon Charter Communications' purchase of Time Warner Cable.[413]",

                "content": "Real Madrid Club de Fútbol (Spanish pronunciation: [reˈal maˈðɾið ˈkluβ ðe ˈfuðβol] ⓘ), commonly referred to as Real Madrid, is a Spanish professional football club based in Madrid. The club competes in La Liga, the top tier of Spanish football. Founded in 1902 as Madrid Football Club, the club has traditionally worn a white home kit since its inception. The honorific title real is Spanish for \"royal\" and was bestowed to the club by King Alfonso XIII in 1920 alongside with the crown in the club crest. Real Madrid have played their home matches in the 85,000-capacity Santiago Bernabéu in Madrid since 1947. Unlike most European sporting clubs, Real Madrid's members (socios) have owned and operated the club throughout its history. The official Madrid anthem is the \"Hala Madrid y nada más\", written by RedOne and Manuel Jabois.[8] The club is one of the most widely supported in the world and is the most followed football club on social media according to the CIES Football Observatory as of 2023.[9][10] It was estimated to be worth $6.6 billion in 2024, making it the world's most valuable football club.[11] In 2024, Real Madrid become the first football club to make €1 billion ($1.08bn) in revenue according to the club's announcement.[12] Real Madrid are one of the most successful clubs in the sport. In domestic football, the club has won 71 trophies; a record 36 La Liga titles, 20 Copa del Rey, 13 Supercopa de España, a Copa Eva Duarte and a Copa de la Liga.[13] In International football, Real Madrid have won a record 35 trophies: a record 15 European Cup/UEFA Champions League titles, a record six UEFA Super Cups, two UEFA Cups, a joint record two Latin Cups, a record one Iberoamerican Cup, and a record nine FIFA Club World championships.[note 1] Madrid was ranked first in the International Federation of Football History & Statistics Club World Ranking for 2000, 2002, 2014, 2017.[17] In UEFA, Madrid ranks first in the all-time club ranking.[18][19] Being one of the three founding members of La Liga that have never been relegated from the top division since its inception in 1929 (along with Athletic Bilbao and Barcelona), Real Madrid has many long-standing rivalries, most notably El Clásico with Barcelona and El Derbi Madrileño with Atlético Madrid. The club established itself as a major force in both Spanish and European football during the 1950s and 60s, winning five consecutive and six overall European Cups and reaching a further two finals. This success was replicated on the domestic front, with Madrid winning 12 league titles in 16 years. This team, which included Alfredo Di Stéfano, Ferenc Puskás, Paco Gento and Raymond Kopa is considered, by some in the sport, to be the greatest of all time.[20][21] Real Madrid is known for its Galácticos policy, which involves signing the world's best players, such as Ronaldo, Zinedine Zidane and David Beckham to create a superstar team.[22] The term 'Galácticos policy' generally refers to the two eras of Florentino Pérez's presidency of the club (2000–2006 and 2009–2018); however, players brought in just before his tenure are sometimes considered to be part of the Galácticos legacy. A notable example is Steve McManaman, who like many other players also succeeded under the policy.[23] On 26 June 2009, Madrid signed Cristiano Ronaldo for a record-breaking £80 million (€94 million);[24] he became both the club's and history's all-time top goalscorer.[25][26][27][28] Madrid have recently relaxed the Galácticos policy, instead focusing on signing young talents such as Vinícius Júnior, Rodrygo, Jude Bellingham[29] and Kylian Mbappé.[30][31] Real Madrid is recognised as the greatest football club of the 20th century by FIFA and as the best European club during the same timeframe by the IFFHS,[32] while also receiving the FIFA Centennial Order of Merit in 2004.[33] Real Madrid has the highest participations in the European Cup/Champions League (55),[18] a tournament in which they hold the overall record for the most wins, most draws and most goals scored.[34] Real Madrid is the only club to have won three consecutive titles (three-peat) in the European Cup/Champions League twice, first in 1955–56, 1956–57, and 1957–58, and second in 2015–16, 2016–17 and 2017–18 and was the first and the only club to win La Decima (in 2013-14).[35] In June 2024, they won a record-extending 15th Champions League title (the sixth in eleven seasons), recognised as such by Guinness World Records.[36] Real Madrid is the first club across all of Europe's top-five leagues to win 100 trophies in all competitions.[37] As of July 2024,[update] Real Madrid are ranked 2nd in the UEFA club rankings and first in last 10 years (2013–2023) overall.[38][39] Real Madrid's origins go back to when football was introduced to Madrid by the academics and students of the Institución Libre de Enseñanza, which included several Cambridge and Oxford University graduates.[40] They founded (Sociedad) Sky Football in 1897, commonly known as La Sociedad (The Society) as it was the only one based in Madrid, playing on Sunday mornings at Moncloa. In 1900, conflict between members caused some of them to leave and create a new club, Nueva Sociedad de Football (New Society of Football), to distinguish themselves from Sky Football. Among the dissenters were Julián Palacios, recognized as the first Real Madrid president, Juan Padrós and Carlos Padrós, the latter two being brothers and future presidents of Real Madrid. In 1901, this new club was renamed as Madrid Football Club. Later, following a restructuring in 1902, Sky was renamed as \"New Foot-Ball Club\".[41][42][43] On 6 March 1902, after a new Board presided by Juan Padrós had been elected, Madrid Football Club was officially founded.[7] The Padrós brothers summoned other football enthusiasts to a meeting in the back room of Al Capricho, the family business. They viewed football as a mass sport that should be accessible to representatives of all social classes, and thought the new club should embody that idea. The brothers proposed the name, Madrid Football Club, which was unanimously accepted. The membership fee was also set, two pesetas a month, and the color of the shirt was chosen to be white in honour of a famous English team Corinthian, which Juan Padrós had met on one of his trips.[44][45] Three years after its founding, in 1905, Madrid FC won its first title after defeating Athletic Bilbao in the Spanish Cup final. The club became one of the founding sides of the Royal Spanish Football Federation on 4 January 1909, when club president Adolfo Meléndez signed the foundation agreement of the Spanish FA. After moving between several grounds, the team relocated to the Campo de O'Donnell in 1912.[46] In 1920, the club's name was changed to Real Madrid after King Alfonso XIII granted the title of Real (Royal) to the club.[47] In 1929, the first Spanish football league was founded. Real Madrid led the first league season until the last match, a loss to Athletic Bilbao, meant they finished runners-up to Barcelona.[48] Real Madrid won its first league title in the 1931–32 season and retained it the following year.[49] On 14 April 1931, the arrival of the Second Spanish Republic caused the club to lose the title Real and the royal crown on its emblem, going back to being named Madrid Football Club until the end of the Spanish Civil War. Football continued during the Second World War, and on 13 June 1943, Madrid beat Barcelona 11–1 in the second leg of the Copa del Generalísimo semi-finals, the Spanish Cup having been renamed in honour of General Franco.[note 2][50] The first leg, played at the Les Corts in Catalonia, had ended with Barcelona winning 3–0. Madrid complained about all the three goals that referee Fombona Fernández had allowed for Barcelona,[51] with the home supporters also whistling Madrid throughout, whom they accused of employing roughhouse tactics, and Fombona for allowing them to. The newspaper Ya reported the whistling as a \"clear intention to attack the representatives of Spain.\"[52] Barcelona fans were banned from traveling to Madrid. The day of the second leg, the Barcelona team were insulted and stones were thrown at their bus as soon as they left their hotel. Barcelona's striker Mariano Gonzalvo said of the incident, \"Five minutes before the game had started, our penalty area was already full of coins.\" Barcelona goalkeeper Luis Miró rarely approached his line—when he did, he was armed with stones. As Francisco Calvet told the story, \"They were shouting: Reds! Separatists!... a bottle just missed Sospedra that would have killed him if it had hit him. It was all set up.\"[53] Real Madrid went 2–0 up within half an hour. The third goal brought with it a sending off for Barcelona's Benito García after he made what Calvet claimed was a \"completely normal tackle\". Madrid's José Llopis Corona recalled: \"At which point, they got a bit demoralized,\" while Ángel Mur countered, \"at which point, we thought: 'go on then, score as many as you want'.\"[54] Madrid made it 8–0 by half-time; two goals were also ruled out for offside, and proceeded to score a further three goals in the second half, to which Barcelona replied with a late consolation goal.[55] According to football writer Sid Lowe, \"There have been relatively few mentions of the game [since] and it is not a result that has been particularly celebrated in Madrid. Indeed, the 11–1 occupies a far more prominent place in Barcelona's history. This was the game that first formed the identification of Madrid as the team of the dictatorship and Barcelona as its victims.\"[51] Fernando Argila, Barcelona's reserve goalkeeper from the 1943 match, said: \"There was no rivalry. Not, at least, until that game.\"[56] Santiago Bernabéu became president of Real Madrid in 1943.[57] Under his presidency, the club was rebuilt after the Civil War, and he oversaw the construction of the club's current stadium, Estadio Real Madrid Club de Fútbol (now known as the Santiago Bernabéu), and its training facilities Ciudad Deportiva. Additionally, during the 1950s former Real Madrid Amateurs player Miguel Malbo founded Real Madrid's youth academy, or \"cantera,\" known today as La Fábrica. Beginning in 1953, he embarked upon a strategy of signing world-class players from abroad, the most prominent being Alfredo Di Stéfano.[58] In 1955, acting upon the idea proposed by Gabriel Hanot, a French sports journalist and editor of L'Équipe, Bernabéu, Ernest Bedrignan (deputy chairman of the Ligue de Football Professionnel)[59] and Gusztáv Sebes created the European Cup, a continental tournament for the league champions around Europe, which is today known as the UEFA Champions League.[60] It was under Bernabéu's guidance that Real Madrid established itself as a major force in both Spanish and European football. The club won the European Cup five times in a row between 1956 and 1960, which included the 7–3 Hampden Park final against Eintracht Frankfurt in 1960.[58] After these five consecutive successes, Real was permanently awarded the original cup and earned the right to wear the UEFA badge of honour.[61] Real Madrid's achievements in Europe were built upon its unprecedented domestic dominance, with the club winning twelve league titles out of sixteen possible from 1953–54 to 1968–69, including a five-in-a-row sequence in 1961–65, and finishing runners-up a further three times.[62] The club won the European Cup for a sixth time in 1966, defeating Partizan Belgrade 2–1 in the final with a team composed entirely of same nationality players, a first in the competition.[63] This team became known as the Yé-yé. The name \"Yé-yé\" came from the \"Yeah, yeah, yeah\" chorus in The Beatles' song \"She Loves You\" after four members of the team posed for Marca and impersonated the Beatles.[64] The Yé-yé generation was also European Cup runners-up in 1962[65] and 1964.[63] In the 1970s, Real Madrid won six league championships and three Spanish Cups.[66] The club competed in its first European Cup Winners' Cup in 1970–71 and progressed all the way to the final, where it lost to English side Chelsea 2–1 in a replay.[67] On 2 July 1978, club president Santiago Bernabéu died while the World Cup was being played in Argentina. FIFA decreed three days of mourning to honour him during the tournament.[68] The following year, the club organized the first edition of the Trofeo Santiago Bernabéu in memory of its former president. Bernabéu had been Real Madrid's president for almost 35 years, during which his club won one Intercontinental Cup, six European Cups, 16 league titles, six Spanish Cups, two Latin Cups and one Copa Eva Duarte.[69] In the early 1980s, Real Madrid had lost its grasp on the La Liga title, until a new cohort of home-grown stars brought domestic success back to the club.[70][71] Spanish sports journalist Julio César Iglesias gave to this generation the name La Quinta del Buitre (\"Vulture's Cohort\"), which was derived from the nickname given to one of its members, Emilio Butragueño. The other four members were Manolo Sanchís, Martín Vázquez, Míchel and Miguel Pardeza. All five footballers were graduates of Real Madrid's youth academy.[70][71] With La Quinta del Buitre (reduced to four members when Pardeza left for Zaragoza in 1986) and notable players like goalkeeper Francisco Buyo, right-back Miguel Porlán Chendo and Mexican striker Hugo Sánchez, Real Madrid had one of the best teams in Spain and Europe during the second half of the 1980s, winning two UEFA Cups, five Spanish championships in a row, one Spanish Cup, and three Spanish Super Cups.[70][71] In the early 1990s, La Quinta del Buitre split up after Martín Vázquez, Emilio Butragueño and Míchel left the club. In 1996, President Lorenzo Sanz appointed Fabio Capello as coach.[72] Although his tenure lasted only one season, Real Madrid were proclaimed league champions, and players like Predrag Mijatović, Davor Šuker, Clarence Seedorf, Roberto Carlos and keeper Bodo Illgner, arrived at the club to strengthen a squad that already boasted the likes of Raúl, Fernando Hierro and Fernando Redondo. As a result, Real Madrid (with the addition of Fernando Morientes in 1997) finally ended its 32-year wait for its seventh European Cup: in 1998, under manager Jupp Heynckes, they defeated Juventus 1–0 in the final with a goal from Mijatović.[73] In November 1999, Vicente del Bosque took over as coach. For the last season of the century, 1999–2000, the squad was still led by the older veterans such as Fernando Hierro, Fernando Redondo, Roberto Carlos and Raúl. Real added the budding young talents of Guti and Iker Casillas, supported by the arrival of Steve McManaman and Nicolas Anelka from the English Premier League, alongside local talents Míchel Salgado and Iván Helguera. In Del Bosque's first season in charge, Real won the Champions League for the eighth time, following a 3–0 victory over Valencia in the final, with goals from Morientes, McManaman and Raúl.[74] This victory marked the beginning of a successful period in Real Madrid's history.[75] In July 2000, Florentino Pérez was elected club president.[76] He vowed in his campaign to erase the club's €270 million debt and modernize the club's facilities. However, the primary electoral promise that propelled Pérez to victory was the signing of Luís Figo from arch-rivals Barcelona.[77] The following year, the club had its training ground rezoned and used the money to begin assembling the Galácticos team by signing a global star every summer, which included Zinedine Zidane, Ronaldo, Luís Figo, David Beckham and Fabio Cannavaro.[78] It is debatable whether the gamble paid off, as despite winning the UEFA Champions League and an Intercontinental Cup in 2002, followed by La Liga in 2003, the club failed to win a major trophy for the next three seasons. Off the pitch, the Zidanes y Pavones policy resulted in increased financial success based on the exploitation of the club's high marketing potential around the world, particularly in Asia.[79] The few days after the capturing of the 2003 La Liga title were surrounded with controversy. The first controversial decision came when Pérez sacked winning coach Vicente del Bosque.[80] Over a dozen players left the club, including Madrid captain Fernando Hierro, while defensive midfielder Claude Makélélé refused to take part in training in protest at being one of the lowest-paid players at the club and subsequently moved to Chelsea.[81] \"That's a lot [of players leaving] when the normal rule is: never change a winning team,\" stated Zidane.[82] Real Madrid, with newly appointed coach Carlos Queiroz, started their domestic league slowly after a hard win over Real Betis.[82] The 2005–06 season began with the promise of several new signings: Júlio Baptista (€24 million), Robinho (€30 million), and Sergio Ramos (€27 million).[83] However, Real Madrid suffered from some poor results, including a 0–3 loss at the hands of Barcelona at the Santiago Bernabéu in November 2005.[84] Madrid's coach Wanderley Luxemburgo was sacked the following month and his replacement was Juan Ramón López Caro.[85] A brief return to form came to an abrupt halt after Madrid lost the first leg of the Copa del Rey semi-finals 6–1 to Real Zaragoza,[86] a defeat that was nearly reversed with a 4–0 home victory. Shortly after, Real Madrid were eliminated from the Champions League for a fourth successive year, this time at the hands of Arsenal. On 27 February 2006, Florentino Pérez resigned.[87] Ramón Calderón was elected as club president on 2 July 2006 and subsequently appointed Fabio Capello as the new coach and Predrag Mijatović as the new sporting director. Real Madrid won the Liga title in 2007 for the first time in four years, but Capello was nonetheless sacked at the end of the campaign.[88] The title was won on 17 June, where Real faced Mallorca at the Bernabéu while Barcelona and Sevilla, the other title challengers, faced Gimnàstic de Tarragona and Villarreal, respectively. At half-time, Real were 0–1 down, while Barcelona had surged ahead into a 0–3 lead in Tarragona. However, three goals in the last half-hour secured Madrid a 3–1 win and their first league title since 2003.[89] Real Madrid repeated as league winners in 2007–08, but the following season ended up being one of the most disastrous in the club's history: Real was knocked out of the Champions League at the round of 16 stage for the fifth time in a row, losing to Liverpool 0–5 on aggregate, and was embarrassed by Barcelona at the Santiago Bernabéu with a humiliating 2–6 loss, which all but confirmed the league title for Barça that went on to win the treble.[90] On 1 June 2009, Florentino Pérez regained Real Madrid's presidency amid the outrage over the club's decline.[91][92] Pérez continued with the Galácticos policy pursued in his first term, buying Kaká from Milan for a record-breaking (in pounds sterling) sum of £56 million,[93] and then breaking the record again by purchasing Cristiano Ronaldo from Manchester United for £80 million.[94] Real Madrid spent in excess of €261 million in the summer of 2009, and the assembled team was soon dubbed the Second Galácticos.[95] The 2009–10 season, however, was a transitional one as Madrid again finished second in the league, although this time amassing 96 points, the club's record at the time, and went out of the Champions League at the hands of Lyon. The season was marred by Cristiano Ronaldo's injury, that sidelined him for seven weeks,[96] although he still topped the goalscoring charts with 33 goals, and Madrid became the highest scoring team in La Liga, with 102 goals. Real Madrid also had the misfortune to become the runners-up with the highest points total in the history of Europe's top five leagues, until surpassed by Liverpool's 97 points in 2018–19.[97][98] José Mourinho took over as manager in May 2010.[99][100] In the 2010–11 season, the rebuilt Madrid successfully fought on all fronts, going toe to toe with a brilliant Barcelona side which some regard as the greatest team in football history. Ultimately, Madrid finished second in the league, with 92 points and four behind their perennial rivals, defeated them in the Copa del Rey final, and lost to Barça in the Champions League semi-finals, where Real progressed to for the first time since 2002–03. Moreover, from 16 April through 3 May, a rare occurrence happened when, for the first time ever, four Clásicos were to be played in a span of just 18 days. The first fixture was in the league campaign on 16 April (which ended 1–1 with penalty goals for both sides), the second one was in the Copa del Rey final (which was won by Madrid 1–0 a.e.t., bringing them their first trophy in the second Galáctico era) on 20 April and the third and fourth ones in the controversial[101][102] two-legged Champions League semi-finals on 27 April and 3 May (Barcelona won on aggregate with a 2–0 away victory and a 1–1 home draw).[103] Madrid again became the highest scoring team in La Liga, with 102 goals, repeating its output from the previous season, with Ronaldo scoring 40 and winning the European Golden Shoe. In the 2011–12 season, Real Madrid won La Liga for a record 32nd time in its history, also finishing the season with numerous league records set, including 100 points amassed in a single season, a total of 121 goals scored, a goal difference of +89, 16 away games won, and 32 wins overall.[104] They also competed in the UEFA Champions League for the 15th successive season,[105] losing in the semi-finals to Bayern Munich in a penalty shoot-out after a 3–3 aggregate tie. Madrid entered the Copa del Rey as the defending champions, but lost 3–4 on aggregate in the quarter-finals to Barcelona. In the same season, Cristiano Ronaldo became the fastest player to reach 100 goals scored in Spanish league history. In reaching 101 goals in 92 games, Ronaldo surpassed Real Madrid legend Ferenc Puskás, who scored 100 goals in 105 matches. Ronaldo set a new club mark for individual goals scored in one year (60) and became the first player ever to score against all 19 opposition teams in a single season.[106][107] Real Madrid started the 2012–13 season by winning the Supercopa de España, defeating Barcelona on away goals. However, the super cup turned out to be their only trophy of the season, despite being close to win them all. Real finished runners-up to Barça in La Liga, accumulating 85 points, and reached the semi-finals of the UEFA Champions League for the third year in a row, where they were eliminated by Borussia Dortmund 3–4 on aggregate. Madrid also entered the Copa del Rey in the round of 32, going on a memorable run to the final, which saw them defeat Barcelona in the semi-finals before losing to Atlético Madrid 1–2 a.e.t. Real Madrid faced the Blaugrana six times throughout the season, coming away with three wins, two draws, and one loss. A major transfer of the season was the signing of Luka Modrić from Tottenham Hotspur for a fee in the region of £33 million.[108] After a loss to Atlético in the Copa del Rey final, Pérez announced the departure of José Mourinho at the end of the season by \"mutual agreement\".[109] On 25 June 2013, Carlo Ancelotti succeeded Mourinho to become the manager of Real Madrid on a three-year deal, with Zinedine Zidane named as one of his assistants.[110] On 1 September 2013, the long-awaited transfer of Gareth Bale from Tottenham Hotspur was announced. The transfer of the Welshman was reportedly a new world record signing, with the transfer price approximated at €100 million.[111] In Ancelotti's first season at the club, Real Madrid fought on all three fronts for the continental treble. Despite leading in the league campaign on multiple occasions, Madrid ultimately finished in third place (level on points with Barcelona and three behind cross-city rivals Atlético Madrid), collecting 87 points in total and scoring a record 104 goals.[112] By that time, Los Blancos had already secured the Copa del Rey – against rivals Barcelona – in April, with Bale scoring the winner.[113] The major breakthrough came in the UEFA Champions League, where Real returned to the final after twelve years, having beaten defending champions Bayern Munich 5–0 on aggregate in the semi-finals.[114] In the final, they defeated then-recently-league winners Atlético Madrid 4–1 a.e.t. to clinch their tenth European Cup (first since 2002) and become the first team to win ten European Cups/Champions League titles, an achievement known as \"La Décima\" (Spanish: \"The Tenth,\" [la ˈðeθima]).[115] Real's attacking trio of Bale, Benzema and Cristiano, dubbed the BBC, finished the season with 97 goals.[116] After winning the 2014 Champions League, Real Madrid signed goalkeeper Keylor Navas, midfielder Toni Kroos and attacking midfielder James Rodríguez.[117] In August, Madrid won the 2014 UEFA Super Cup against Sevilla, the club's 79th official trophy.[118] During the last week of the 2014 summer transfer window, Real Madrid sold two players key to the previous season's successes: Xabi Alonso to Bayern Munich and Ángel Di María to Manchester United. This decision by the club was surrounded by controversy, with Cristiano Ronaldo stating, \"If I was in charge, maybe I would have done things differently,\" while Carlo Ancelotti admitted, \"We must start again from zero.\"[119] After a slow start to the 2014–15 season, Real Madrid went on a record-breaking 22-match winning streak, which included wins against Barcelona and Liverpool, surpassing the previous Spanish record of 18 successive wins set by Frank Rijkaard's Barça in the 2005–06 season.[120] In late December, Real Madrid won their first Club World Cup, defeating San Lorenzo 2–0 in the final.[121] The winning streak came to an end in their opening match of 2015 with a loss to Valencia, leaving the club two short of equalling the world record of 24 consecutive wins.[122] Madrid was in contention for both the La Liga title and the UEFA Champions League until the end but ultimately came up short, finishing with 92 points in the league, two behind treble-winning Barcelona and losing to Juventus 2–3 on aggregate in the Champions League semi-finals.[123] Ronaldo finished the season scoring 48 league goals, winning his fourth European Golden Shoe, and 61 goals in all competitions, breaking his record from 2011 to 2012.[124] Overall, despite playing an attractive attacking football and being the highest scoring team in Europe with 118 league goals,[125] several narrow defeats meant that Real finished the season with two trophies out of six possible, which contributed to the dismissal of Carlo Ancelotti on 25 May 2015.[126][127] On 3 June 2015, Rafael Benítez was confirmed as the new Real Madrid manager for the 2015–16 season, signing a three-year contract.[128] Real Madrid remained unbeaten in the league until a 3–2 loss at Sevilla on the matchday 11. This was followed by a 0–4 home loss in the first Clásico of the season against Barcelona. Perhaps, his reign is best remembered by multiple lopsided wins achieved both in La Liga and the Champions League (6–0 vs Espanyol, 8–0 vs Malmö, 10–2 vs Rayo Vallecano and others). In the Copa del Rey round of 32, Real accidentally fielded an ineligible player in a 3–1 first leg win at Cádiz and was disqualified from the tournament two days later by the competition judge, despite protests from president Pérez.[129][130][131] In the meantime, Madrid comfortably topped their UCL group with 16 points and a +16 goal difference. Benítez was relieved of his duties on 4 January 2016 following allegations of unpopularity with supporters, displeasure with players and a failure to produce good results against top teams.[132] Benítez's departure was announced along with the promotion of Zinedine Zidane to his first head coaching role.[133] Under Zidane, Madrid managed to turn the odds in its favour, ultimately winning the Champions League, something no one expected. The notable results include a 2–1 away victory over reigning treble winners Barcelona, who were on a record-breaking winning streak, a fantastic comeback against Wolfsburg in the Champions League quarter-finals (after losing the away game 0–2, Madrid erased the deficit and won 3–0 at home, courtesy of a Cristiano Ronaldo hat-trick), as well as a 12-game winning streak to conclude the league campaign, meaning Real finished second, with 90 points and just one point behind champions Barcelona, coming agonizingly close to clinching the title and overcoming a 12-point deficit in the process.[134] Finally, on 28 May, Real Madrid's eleventh Champions League title was won thanks to a 5–3 penalty shoot-out victory over rivals Atlético Madrid after a 1–1 draw in the final, with the achievement being termed \"La Undécima\".[135][136][127] Real Madrid began their 2016–17 campaign, which was to be Zidane's first full season in charge of the club, with a victory in the 2016 UEFA Super Cup against Sevilla.[137] On 10 December 2016, Madrid played their 35th-straight match without a loss, which set a new club record.[138] On 18 December 2016, the club defeated Japanese outfit Kashima Antlers 4–2 in the final of the 2016 FIFA Club World Cup.[139] With a 3–3 draw at Sevilla in the second leg of the Copa del Rey round of 16 on 12 January 2017, Madrid progressed to the quarter-finals with a 6–3 aggregate victory and extended its unbeaten run to 40 matches, breaking Barcelona's Spanish record of 39 matches unbeaten in all competitions from the previous season.[140] Their unbeaten streak ended after a 1–2 away loss against the same opposition in La Liga three days later.[141] The team then was knocked out of the Copa del Rey by Celta Vigo 3–4 on aggregate. These slips, however, did not affect the overall trajectory of the season. In May, Madrid won the league title for a record 33rd time, their first title in five years, accumulating 93 points in the process.[142] On 3 June 2017, the club's victory over Juventus in the Champions League final resulted in Real Madrid becoming the first team to successfully defend their title in the UEFA Champions League era, and the first to win consecutive titles in the competition since Milan in 1989 and 1990, when the tournament was known as the European Cup.[143][144] Real Madrid's title was its 12th, extending the record, and its third in four years. The achievement is also known as \"La Duodécima\".[145] The 2016–17 season was the greatest campaign in terms of trophies won (four out of possible five) in the history of Real Madrid, an achievement that would be later equalled in the 2017–18 season.[146] Real kicked off the 2017–18 campaign by winning its second consecutive and fourth overall UEFA Super Cup in a 2–1 victory against Manchester United.[147] Five days later, Real Madrid beat Barcelona at the Camp Nou 3–1 in the first leg of the 2017 Supercopa de España and then defeated Barça 2–0 in the return leg, ending their 24 consecutive match scoring record in El Clásico matches and winning the second trophy of the season.[148] On 16 December 2017, Real beat Brazilian club Grêmio 1–0 in the FIFA Club World Cup final and became the first team to retain the trophy.[149] In the 2017–18 UEFA Champions League, Madrid once again progressed to the final where they defeated Liverpool 3–1 to become the first club to win three straight titles in the Champions League era, as well as the first team to win three consecutive titles in the European Cup/Champions League since Bayern Munich in 1976. The trophy also marked Madrid's fourth win in five years and their eighth consecutive semi-finals appearance. On 31 May, only five days after winning the final, Zidane announced his resignation as Real Madrid manager, citing the club's \"need for change\" as his rationale for departing.[150][151] Zidane's and Ronaldo's departures marked the end of the Second Galáctico Era that yielded four Champions League titles, two La Liga titles, two Copa del Rey, two Supercopa de España, three UEFA Super Cups, and three FIFA Club World Cup titles. The team was instrumental in ending Barcelona's dominance, despite the Blaugrana boasting arguably the greatest collection of talent in history,[152] and overshadowed the Catalans on the European stage.[153] Real Madrid was also somewhat notoriously unlucky in its league campaigns throughout these nine years, finishing runners-up with 96, 92 (twice) and 90 points, as well as on 87 points in third place, just three off the league winners.[98] On 12 June 2018, Real Madrid named Julen Lopetegui, the head coach of the Spanish national team, as their new manager. It was announced that he would officially begin his managerial duties after the 2018 FIFA World Cup. However, the Spanish national team sacked Lopetegui a day prior to the tournament, stating that he had negotiated terms with the club without informing them.[154][155] The club then began re-shaping the squad in the summer of 2018, which included the sale of Cristiano Ronaldo to Juventus for a reported €117 million.[156] Madrid began their 2018–19 campaign by losing to Atlético Madrid 2–4 a.e.t. in the 2018 UEFA Super Cup. After a 1–5 loss to Barcelona in El Clásico on 28 October which left Real Madrid in the ninth place with only 14 points after ten games, Lopetegui was dismissed a day later and replaced by then Castilla coach, Santiago Solari.[157] On 22 December 2018, Real Madrid beat Al Ain 4–1 in the FIFA Club World Cup and became the outright record winners of the Club World Cup with four titles.[158] However, they were then knocked out of the Copa del Rey at the semi-final stage by Barcelona, losing 1–4 on aggregate. On 5 March 2019, Real was defeated by Ajax 1–4 (3–5 on aggregate) at home, crashing out of the Champions League at the round of 16 stage after eight consecutive semi-finals appearances. On 11 March 2019, Real Madrid dismissed Solari and reinstated Zidane as the head coach of the club.[159] Madrid finished the season with 68 points and a +17 goal difference, its lowest totals since 2001–02 and 1999–2000 respectively.[160] In the summer of 2019, Madrid signed Eden Hazard, Luka Jović, Éder Militão, Ferland Mendy, Rodrygo, Reinier and other players for a total of more than €350 million.[161] On 12 January 2020, Madrid beat cross-city rivals Atlético Madrid in a penalty shootout in the Supercopa de España final to win their eleventh title.[162] After a three-month hiatus due to the COVID-19 outbreak in March 2020, La Liga was restarted in June and Madrid won ten games in a row to capture the team's 34th league title, collecting 87 points in total.[163] From the competition's resumption in June and until the end of the 2020–21 season, Real temporarily played home fixtures at the Alfredo Di Stéfano Stadium, while the Santiago Bernabéu underwent extensive renovations.[164][165] Zidane left a second time on 27 May 2021 after going trophyless that season,[166] with Carlo Ancelotti returning to coach the team for the 2021–22 season.[167] On the domestic front, he delivered two trophies out of possible three, winning La Liga and the Supercopa de España.[168][169][170] As such, Ancelotti won all six available top trophies at Madrid.[171] In the Champions League, Madrid produced one of the most memorable runs of all time,[172] defeating pre-tournament favourites Paris Saint-Germain,[173][174] defending champions and favourites Chelsea,[175] Premier League champions and heavy favourites Manchester City,[176] all in dramatic fashion,[177] and setting up the final against Liverpool, who were once again widely considered as favourites,[178] in a rematch of their 2018 encounter. A lone Vinícius Júnior goal sealed the 14th European Cup for Los Blancos, their fifth in nine years, and Ancelotti's second in charge.[179][180] Real also claimed their fourth ever European double (after 1956–57, 1957–58, and 2016–17). Despite Real's status as the most decorated team in the history of the Champions League, they were not favoured to win that year's edition, and their improbable run was widely considered a surprise.[181] After a highly successful 2021–22 season, Real Madrid signed German defender Antonio Rüdiger and French midfielder Aurélien Tchouaméni, while club legends Marcelo, Isco, Gareth Bale and Casemiro left the club. Real Madrid's 2022–23 season began with lifting the UEFA Super Cup and later the FIFA Club World Cup. The season ended with Real Madrid winning the 2022–23 Copa del Rey, but losing the La Liga and Spanish Super Cup to FC Barcelona and the Champions League to Manchester City, being defeated 5–1 on aggregate. In 2023, Real Madrid signed Jude Bellingham, who was given the number #5 jersey, previously used by Zinedine Zidane. Real also signed Arda Güler and Fran García. Meanwhile, Vinícius Júnior was given the number #7 jersey, previously used by Raúl and Cristiano Ronaldo; while Rodrygo was given the number #11 jersey, previously used by Gareth Bale. Karim Benzema left the club, while Toni Kroos would later announce that he would retire from football after this season. The 2023-24 season would prove to be another highly successful season for Los Blancos. First, Real Madrid lifted the Spanish Super Cup against Barcelona 4–1, taking revenge of the previous year's 3–0 defeat. Then, Real Madrid lifted the La Liga with relative ease, reaching 95 points, the second-best winning campaign by Real Madrid in La Liga history after the 2011–12 100 points season. In the 2023–24 UEFA Champions League, Real Madrid knocked out RB Leipzig in the Round of 16, then defending champions Manchester City in penalties. In the semifinals, Real Madrid faced Bayern Munich again. The first match was a 2–2 draw, while the second match in the Bernabéu was marked by a double by Joselu in the last few minutes of the game, with Bayern Munich suffering a historic comeback after leading 1–0. Real Madrid faced Borussia Dortmund in the final, and won 2–0, with Dani Carvajal being the man of the match and scoring with a header after a Toni Kroos corner, and Vinícius Júnior once again scoring in a UCL final. Real Madrid won their 15th Champions League without losing a single match during the campaign. Following the conclusion of the 2023–24 season, Real Madrid announced that striker Kylian Mbappé would be joining the club on a free transfer from Paris Saint-Germain in July 2024, concluding one of the most highly anticipated transfer sagas in modern history.[182] On 18 December 2024, Real Madrid clinched their second trophy of the season, uplifting the inaugural 2024 FIFA Intercontinental Cup by beating Pachuca 3-0.[183] The first crest had a simple design consisting of a decorative interlacing of the three initials of the club, \"MCF\" for Madrid Club de Fútbol, in dark blue on a white shirt. The first change in the crest occurred in 1908 when the letters adopted a more streamlined form and appeared inside a circle.[184] The next change in the configuration of the crest did not occur until the presidency of Pedro Parages in 1920. At that time, King Alfonso XIII granted the club his royal patronage which came in the form of the title \"Real Madrid,\" meaning \"Royal.\"[185] Thus, Alfonso's crown was added to the crest and the club styled itself Real Madrid Club de Fútbol.[184] With the dissolution of the monarchy in 1931, all royal symbols (the crown on the crest and the title of Real) were eliminated. The crown was replaced by the dark mulberry band of the Region of Castile.[49] In 1941, two years after Nationalist victory in the Civil War, the Francoist regime restored the crest's \"Real Corona\", or \"Royal Crown\", while the mulberry stripe of Castile was retained as well.[186][57] In addition, the whole crest was made full color, with gold being the most prominent, and the club went back to its honorific name Real Madrid Club de Fútbol.[184] The most recent modification to the crest occurred in 2001 when the club wanted to better situate itself for the 21st century and further standardize its crest. One of the modifications made was changing the mulberry stripe to a more bluish shade.[184] Real Madrid has maintained the white shirt for its home kit throughout the history of the club. There was, however, one season that the shirt and shorts were not both white. It was an initiative undertaken by Juan Padrós in honour of an English team Corinthian, which he had met on one of his trips, one of the most famous teams at the time known for its elegance and sportsmanship.[44] It was decided that Real Madrid would wear black shorts in an attempt to replicate the English team, which had also inspired Madrid's original white kit, but the initiative lasted just one year. After being eliminated from the cup by Barcelona with a 1–5 defeat in Madrid and a 2–0 defeat in Catalonia, President Parages decided to return to an all-white kit, claiming that the other kit brought bad luck.[note 3] By the early 1940s, the manager changed the kit again by adding buttons to the shirt and the club's crest on the left breast, which has remained ever since. On 23 November 1947, in a game against Atlético Madrid at the Metropolitano Stadium, Real Madrid became the first Spanish team to wear numbered shirts.[57] English club Leeds United permanently switched their blue shirt for a white one in the 1960s, to emulate the dominant Real Madrid of the era.[187] Real's traditional away colours are all blue or all purple. Since the advent of the replica kit market, the club has also released various other one colour designs, including red, green, orange and black. The club's kit is manufactured by Adidas, whose contract extends from 1998.[188][189] Real Madrid's first shirt sponsor, Zanussi, agreed for the 1982–83, 1983–84 and 1984–85 seasons. Following that, the club was sponsored by Parmalat and Otaysa before a long-term deal was signed with Teka in 1992.[190][191] In 2001, Real Madrid ended their contract with Teka and for one season and used the Realmadrid.com logo to promote the club's website. Then, in 2002, a deal was signed with Siemens and in 2006, the BenQ Siemens logo appeared on the club's shirt.[192] Real Madrid's shirt sponsor from 2007 until 2013 was bwin.com following the economic problems of BenQ Siemens.[193][194] Fly Emirates became their shirt sponsor in 2013, and in 2017 the club renewed the sponsorship with the airliner, signing a deal until 2022 worth €70 million per year.[195] In 2022, the agreement was again extended, until 2026.[196] In 2015, Madrid signed a new ten-year contract with Adidas, believed to be worth a total of £850 million (€1 billion), with the club earning £59 million (€64 million) per season. The contract includes a clause sanctioning penalty or agreement termination anytime, if Real Madrid fails to qualify for the European competitions or is relegated from La Liga.[197] Note: early termination clauses can be activated at any time depending on the team's performance. After moving between several grounds, the team relocated to the Campo de O'Donnell in 1912, which remained its home stadium for 11 years.[46] After this period, the club moved for one year to the Campo de Ciudad Lineal, a small ground with a capacity of 8,000 spectators. After that, Real Madrid started playing its home matches at the Estadio Chamartín, which was inaugurated on 17 May 1923 with a match against Newcastle United.[203] In this stadium, which hosted 22,500 spectators, Real Madrid celebrated its first Spanish league title.[48] Following his election in 1943, president Santiago Bernabéu decided that the Chamartín was not big enough for the ambitions of the club, and thus a new stadium was built and inaugurated on 14 December 1947.[57][204] Initially knows as Nuevo Chamartín, the stadium was renamed in honour of Bernabéu in 1955 and continues to bear his name to this day.[58] The first match at the Bernabéu was played between Madrid and the Portuguese club Belenenses, with Los Blancos winning 3–1 and Sabino Barinaga scoring the first goal.[57] The capacity has changed frequently, peaking at 120,000 after a 1953 expansion.[205] Since then, there have been a number of reductions due to modernizations (the last standing areas were removed in 1998–99 in response to UEFA regulations which had forbidden standing at matches in European competitions), countered to some extent by expansions.[205] The current capacity is 81,044 spectators. Real Madrid has the fourth-highest average attendance in Europe, behind Borussia Dortmund, Barcelona and Manchester United.[206][207][208][209] The Bernabéu has hosted the 1964 UEFA European Championship final, the 1982 FIFA World Cup final, and the 1957, 1969, 1980 and 2010 European Cup/Champions League finals.[210] The stadium has its own namesake Madrid Metro station along the 10 line.[211] On 14 November 2007, the Bernabéu was upgraded to Elite Football Stadium status by UEFA.[212] On 9 May 2006, the Alfredo Di Stéfano Stadium, named after club legend Alfredo Di Stéfano, was inaugurated in the Real Madrid City, where Real Madrid usually trains. The inaugural match was played between Real Madrid and Reims, a rematch of the 1956 European Cup final. Real Madrid 6–1, with goals from Sergio Ramos, Antonio Cassano (2), Roberto Soldado (2) and José Manuel Jurado. The venue is now part of the Ciudad Real Madrid, the club's training facility located outside Madrid, in Valdebebas. The stadium's capacity is 5,000 people, and it is Real Madrid Castilla's home ground.[213] For the latter part of the 2019–20 season and throughout the 2020–21 season, the stadium hosted the first team's home games due to a combination of the COVID-19 pandemic-triggered restrictions and an extensive renovation of the Santiago Bernabéu.[214][165] The latest renovation of the Santiago Bernabéu is set to increase the capacity by approximately 4,000 with the addition of an extra tier, bringing it to nearly 85,000.[215][216] Furthermore, the height will also be increased by ten metres and a retractable roof, a retractable pitch and a 360-degree screen will be installed.[217][218] The works have started in 2019, and the renovated stadium was initially planned to be unveiled in 2022; however, the COVID-19 pandemic and Russian invasion of Ukraine caused significant disruption to supply chains, prompting the club to postpone the stadium's inauguration to 2023.[219][220] Raúl holds the record for most appearances with Real Madrid, with 741 appearances from 1994 to 2010. Iker Casillas comes second with 725 appearances, followed by Manuel Sanchis Jr., having played 710 times.[221] The record for a goalkeeper is held by Iker Casillas, with 725 appearances. With 63 goals, Cristiano Ronaldo has scored the most international goals while playing for the club. Meanwhile, Sergio Ramos has accumulated the most caps while playing for the club, with 176. Cristiano Ronaldo (2009–2018) is Real Madrid's all-time top goalscorer, with 450 goals in 438 matches.[222][223] Six other players have also scored over 200 goals for Real: Alfredo Di Stéfano (1953–1964), Santillana (1971–1988), Ferenc Puskás (1958–1966), Hugo Sánchez (1985–1992), Karim Benzema (2009–2023) and the previous goalscoring record-holder Raúl (1994–2010). Cristiano Ronaldo also holds the record for the most league goals scored in one season (48 in 2014–15), alongside being Real's top goalscorer of all time in La Liga history with 311 goals. Di Stéfano's 49 goals in 58 matches was for decades the all-time highest tally in the European Cup, until it was surpassed by Raúl in 2005, and is now held by Cristiano Ronaldo with 105 goals for Madrid and 140 overall. The fastest goal in the history of the club (13 seconds) was scored by the Chilean Iván Zamorano on 3 September 1994 during a league match against Sevilla.[224] Officially, the highest home attendance figure for a Real Madrid match is 129,690, which was for a European Cup match in 1956 against Milan. The current official capacity of the Santiago Bernabéu is 80,000.[225] Real has also set records in Spanish football, most notably the most domestic titles (36 as of 2023–24) and the most seasons won in a row (five, during 1960–65 and 1985–90).[1] With 121 matches (from 17 February 1957 to 7 March 1965), the club holds the record for longest unbeaten run at home in La Liga.[226] The club also holds the record for winning the European Cup/UEFA Champions League fifteen times[227] and for the most semi-finals appearances (33). As of June 2024, Cristiano Ronaldo is the all-time top scorer in the UEFA Champions League, with 140 (141 including qualifiers) goals in total, 105 while playing for Real Madrid. The team has the record number of consecutive participations in the European Cup (before it became the Champions League) with 15, from 1955–56 to 1969–70.[228] Among the club's on-field records is a 22-game winning streak in all competitions during the 2014–15 season, a Spanish record. In September 2017, the club equalled the record of the Brazilian club Santos, starring Pelé, by scoring in their 73rd consecutive game, before Bayern Munich breaks the record in 2021.[229] In June 2009, the club broke its own record for the highest transfer fee ever paid in the history of football after purchasing Manchester United star Cristiano Ronaldo for €94 million (£80 million).[230][231] The fee of €77.5 million (100 billion lire) for Zinedine Zidane's transfer from Juventus to Real Madrid in 2001 was the previous highest transfer fee ever paid. This record (in pounds sterling) had been broken previously in June 2009, for a few days, when Real Madrid agreed to buy Kaká from Milan for €67 million (£65 million). The transfer of Tottenham Hotspur's Gareth Bale in 2013 was reportedly a new world record signing, with the transfer fee approximated at around €100 million.[111] In January 2016, documents pertaining to Bale's transfer were leaked which confirmed a world record transfer fee of €100,759,418.[232] Real Madrid equalled their record signing in 2019, when the club signed Eden Hazard from Chelsea for a reported €115 million.[233] The club's record sale occurred on 10 July 2018, when Juventus signed Cristiano Ronaldo for €117 million.[234] During most home matches, the majority of the seats in the stadium are occupied by season-ticket holders, of which the figure is capped at 65,000.[235] To become a season ticket holder one must first be a socio, or club member. In addition to members, the club has more than 1,800 peñas (official, club-affiliated supporters' groups) in Spain and around the world. Real Madrid has the second highest average all-time attendance in Spanish football and regularly attracts over 74,000 fans to the Bernabéu. One of the best supported teams globally, Real Madrid was the first sports team (and first brand) to reach 100 million fans on Facebook in April 2017.[236][237] Real Madrid's hardcore supporters are the so-called Ultras Sur supporters, or simply Ultras. They are known for their extreme right-wing politics, akin to Barcelona's hardcore supporters group Boixos Nois. The Ultras Surs have developed an alliance with other right wing groups, most notably Lazio Irriducibili fans, and have also developed an alliance with left-wing groups. On several occasions, they have racially abused opposing players, and have been investigated by UEFA for doing so.[238][239] Florentino Pérez took it upon himself to ban the Ultras from the Bernabéu and assign their seats to the general public. This decision was controversial with some of the Bernabéu faithful, however, as the lively atmosphere of games would suffer as a result.[240][241] The Ultras have since held protests outside the Bernabéu and have demanded to be reinstated and allowed to enter the grounds.[242] Questioned over Pope Francis' adherence to 2014 FIFA Club World Cup Final opponents San Lorenzo, Madrid captain Sergio Ramos stated: \"In the semi-finals we noticed the love from supporters in Marrakesh and it seemed like we were playing at home. That sums up the greatness of this team. Madrid is God's team and the team of the world\".[243] Among the club's famous supporters is golfer Sergio García, who was invited to take the honorary kickoff for El Clásico at the Bernabeu wearing his green jacket from winning the 2017 Masters.[244] There is often a fierce rivalry between the two strongest teams in a national league, and this is particularly the case in La Liga, where the game between Real Madrid and Barcelona is known as \"The Classic\" (El Clásico). From the start of national competitions the clubs were seen as representatives of two rival regions in Spain: Castile and Catalonia, as well as of the two cities. The rivalry reflects what many regard as the political and cultural tensions felt between the Castilians and Catalans, seen by one author as a re-enactment of the Spanish Civil War.[245] Over the years, the record for Real Madrid and Barcelona is 105 victories for Madrid, 101 victories for Barcelona, and 52 draws as at December 2024.[246] As early as the 1930s, Barcelona \"had developed a reputation as a symbol of Catalan identity, opposed to the centralising tendencies of Madrid\".[248][249] During the dictatorships of Miguel Primo de Rivera and especially Francisco Franco, all regional languages and identities in Spain were frowned upon and restrained. As such, most citizens of Barcelona were in strong opposition to Franco's regime. In that period, Barcelona gained their motto Més que un club (English: More than a club) because of its alleged connection to Catalan nationalist as well as to progressive beliefs.[250] There is an ongoing controversy as to what extent Franco's rule (1939–75) influenced the activities and on-pitch results of both Barcelona and Real Madrid. Fans of both clubs tend to exaggerate the myths favouring their narratives. Most historians agree that Franco did not have a preferred football team, but his Spanish nationalist beliefs led him to associate himself with the establishment teams, such as Atlético Aviación and Madrid FC (that recovered its \"royal\" name after the fall of the Republic and again became Real Madrid). On the other hand, he also wanted the renamed Barcelona succeed as \"Spanish team\", rather than a Catalan one. During the early years of Franco's rule, Real Madrid were not particularly successful, winning two Copa del Generalísimo titles and a Copa Eva Duarte; Barcelona claimed three league titles, one Copa del Generalísimo and one Copa Eva Duarte. During that period, Atlético Aviación were believed to be the preferred team over Real Madrid. The most contested stories of the period include Real Madrid's 11–1 home win against Barcelona in the Copa del Generalísimo, where the Catalan team alleged intimidation, and the controversial transfer of Alfredo Di Stéfano to Real Madrid, despite his agreement with Barcelona. The latter transfer was part of Real Madrid chairman Santiago Bernabéu's \"revolution\" that ushered in the era of unprecedented dominance. Bernabéu, himself a veteran of the Civil War who fought for Franco's forces, saw Real Madrid on top, not only of Spanish, but also European football, helping create the European Cup, the first true competition for Europe's best club sides. His vision was fulfilled when Real Madrid not only started winning consecutive league titles, but also swept the first five editions of the European Cup in the 1950s.[251] These events had a profound impact on Spanish football and influenced Franco's attitude. According to historians, during this time he realized the importance of Real Madrid for his regime's international image, and the club became his preferred team until his death. Fernando Maria Castiella, who served as Minister of Foreign Affairs under Franco from 1957 until 1969, noted that \"[Real Madrid] is the best embassy we have ever had\". Franco died in 1975, and the Spanish transition to democracy soon followed. Under his rule, Real Madrid had won 14 league titles, six Copa del Generalísimo titles, one Copa Eva Duarte, six European Cups, two Latin Cups and one Intercontinental Cup. In the same period, Barcelona had won eight league titles, nine Copa del Generalísimo titles, three Copa Eva Duarte titles, three Inter-Cities Fairs Cups and two Latin Cups.[252][186] The rivalry was intensified during the 1950s when the clubs disputed the signing of Alfredo Di Stéfano. Di Stéfano had impressed both Barcelona and Real Madrid while playing for Los Millonarios in Bogotá, Colombia, during a players' strike in his native Argentina. Soon after Millonarios' return to Colombia, Barcelona directors visited Buenos Aires and agreed with River Plate, the last FIFA-affiliated team to have held Di Stéfano's rights, for his transfer in 1954 for the equivalent of 150 million Italian lira (according to other sources 200,000 dollars). This started a battle between the two Spanish rivals for his rights. FIFA appointed Armando Muñoz Calero, former president of the Spanish Football Federation as mediator. Calero decided to let Di Stéfano play the 1953–54 and 1955–56 seasons in Madrid, and the 1954–55 and 1956–57 seasons in Barcelona. The agreement was approved by the Football Association and their respective clubs. Although the Catalans agreed, the decision created various discontent among the Blaugrana members and the president was forced to resign in September 1953. Barcelona sold Madrid their half-share, and Di Stéfano moved to Los Blancos, signing a four-year contract. Real paid 5.5 million Spanish pesetas for the transfer, plus a 1.3 million bonus for the purchase, an annual fee to be paid to the Millonarios, and a 16,000 salary for Di Stéfano with a bonus double that of his teammates, for a total of 40% of the annual revenue of the Madrid club.[253] Di Stéfano became integral in the subsequent success achieved by Real Madrid, scoring twice in his first game against Barcelona. With him, Madrid won the first five editions of the European Cup.[254] The 1960s saw the rivalry reach the European stage when Real Madrid and Barcelona met twice in the European Cup, with Madrid triumphing en route to their fifth consecutive title in 1959–60 and Barcelona prevailing en route to losing the final in 1960–61. Ahead of the 1973–74 season, Johan Cruyff arrived to Barcelona for a world record £920,000 from Ajax.[255] Already an established player with Ajax, Cruyff quickly won over the Barcelona fans when he told the European press that he chose Barcelona over Real Madrid because he could not play for a club associated with Francisco Franco. He further endeared himself when he named his son \"Jordi\", after the local Catalan Saint George.[256] In 2002, the European encounter between the clubs was dubbed the \"Match of The Century\" by Spanish media, and Madrid's win was watched by more than 500 million people around the world.[257] A fixture known for its intensity and indiscipline, it has also featured memorable goal celebrations from both teams, often involving mocking the opposition.[258] In October 1999, Real Madrid forward Raúl silenced 100,000 Barcelona fans at the Camp Nou when he scored before he celebrated by putting a finger to his lips as if telling the crowd to be quiet.[258][259] In 2009, Barcelona captain Carles Puyol kissed his Catalan armband in front of Madrid fans at the Bernabéu.[258] Cristiano Ronaldo twice gestured to the hostile crowd to \"calm down\" after scoring against Barcelona at the Camp Nou in 2012 and 2016.[258] In April 2017, Messi celebrated his 93rd-minute winner for Barcelona against Real Madrid at the Bernabéu by taking off his Barcelona shirt and holding it up to incensed Real Madrid fans – with his name and number facing them.[258] Later that year, in August, Ronaldo was subbed on in the first leg of the Supercopa de España, proceeded to score in the 80th minute and took his shirt off before holding it up to Barça's fans with his name and number facing them.[260] The club's nearest neighbour is Atlético Madrid, a rivalry being shared between fans of both football teams. Although Atlético was founded by three Basque students in 1903, it was joined in 1904 by dissident members of \"Madrid FC\". The two teams met for the first time on 2 December 1906 in the regional championship, with Real Madrid winning 2–1. Their first league meeting came on 21 February 1929 in matchday three of the first league championship at the former Chamartín. It was the first official derby of the new tournament, and Real won 2–1.[48] After the Civil War, during the early Francoist period, Atlético became associated with the military air force (and thus renamed Atlético Aviación), although the alleged preference of the regime for the club is subject to discussion. In any case, during this period Atlético became the most successful club in Spain, reducing the historical gap between the two clubs, until the regime preference shifted towards Real Madrid in the 1950s, as Franco sought to make political capital out of Real Madrid's multiple European Cup titles at a time when Spain was internationally isolated; one minister said, \"Real Madrid are the best ambassadors we've ever had.\"[186] Thus, Atlético fans regularly chanted that Real were \"El equipo del gobierno, la vergüenza del país\" – \"The team of the government, the shame of the country\" – and allegedly adopted a more left-wing slant (tempered by the rise of ultras culture and Rayo Vallecano's presence as the \"true\" leftist club in Madrid).[261][262] The rivalry first gained international attention in 1959 during the European Cup when the two clubs met in the semi-finals. Real won the first leg 2–1 at the Santiago Bernabéu, while Atlético won 1–0 at the Metropolitano. The tie went to a replay, which Real won 2–1. Atlético, however, gained some revenge when, led by former Real Madrid coach José Villalonga, it defeated its city rivals in two successive Copa del Generalísimo finals in 1960 and 1961.[263] In the 1970s, Atlético again took the lead as the most successful Spanish club of the decade, which prompted the Real Madrid fanbase to look down on Atlético calling them and their supporters \"Indios\" (Indians, a reference to the Latin American players signed by the Red-and-whites).[264] By then, Real Madrid did not want to sign non-Caucasian players (president Santiago Bernabéu even stated, when he decided not to sign Portuguese star Eusebio at the end of the 1960s, \"Mientras yo viva, aquí no jugará ningún negro ni un blanco con bigote\" (\"As long as I live, no black or white with a mustache will play here\").[265] Atlético's supporters accepted the new \"Indian\" nickname joyfully and have been using it until today. The Santiago Bernabéu, Real Madrid's stadium, is alongside banks and businesses on the upper class Paseo de la Castellana street, while the Vicente Calderón (the stadium that Atlético Madrid used until the 2016–17 season) could be found near a brewery, alongside the Manzanares River and a motorway. Real draw greater support all across the region because of their historically greater resources and success, while Atlético have a relatively working class fan base mainly from the south of the city, with some fans also scattered throughout the city.[266][267] In fact, the Atlético crest includes the Coat of arms of Madrid, whereas Real crest has no such a reference to the city (instead, it includes a reference to the broader Castile region). Between 1961 and 1989, when Real dominated La Liga, only Atlético offered it any serious challenge, winning league titles in 1966, 1970, 1973 and 1977. In 1965, Atlético became the first team to beat Real at the Bernabéu in eight years. Real Madrid's record against Atlético in more recent times has been favourable.[268] A high point came in the 2002–03 season, when Real clinched the La Liga title after a 4–0 victory at the Vicente Calderón. Atlético's first win over its city rivals since 1999 came in the Copa del Rey final in May 2013. In 2013–14, Real and Atlético were finalists of the UEFA Champions League, the first final which hosted two clubs from the same city. Real Madrid triumphed with a 4–1 comeback victory in extra time.[269] On 7 February 2015, Real suffered their first defeat in 14 years at the Vicente Calderón, a 4–0 loss.[270] On 28 May 2016, Real and Atlético again met for the Champions League title, which resulted in a win for Real after a penalty shootout at San Siro.[271] A further minor rivalry exists between Real Madrid and Athletic Bilbao. This is known as El Viejo Clásico (the old classic),[272] so named as the two clubs were dominant in the first half of the 20th century, meeting in nine Copa del Rey finals including the first in 1903.[273][274] Until 10 December 2011, this fixture was the most played in the history of Spanish football, when it was surpassed by El Clásico.[275] Athletic Bilbao, who operate a policy of only using local players,[276] have long since ceased to be a competitive rival to clubs such as Real Madrid who scour the globe for the best talent; the Lions won only two of the 26 matches between the teams from 2005–06 to 2016–17.[272][277][278] However, the matches remain keenly fought due to their historical and cultural significance, with some parallels to the political aspect of the Barcelona/Catalonia rivalry as Athletic are the largest club in the Basque region.[279][262][280] Real Madrid and Bayern Munich are two of the most successful clubs in the UEFA Champions League/European Cup competition, with Real winning 15 times and Bayern winning six times.[281][282] Although they have never met in a final, Real Madrid versus Bayern is the match that has historically been played most often in the Champions League/European Cup with 26 matches (twelve wins for Madrid, eleven wins for Bayern, with three draws),[283] with several controversial incidents occurring due to the great importance of most of their meetings.[284][285][286] Real Madrid supporters often refer to Bayern as the \"Bestia negra\" (\"Black Beast\"). During the 2010s, the two teams met in the 2011–12 Champions League semi-finals, which ended 3–3 on aggregate (Bayern won 3–1 on penalties after extra time, but lost the final at their own stadium by the same method), then at the same stage in the 2013–14 edition with Real Madrid winning 5–0 on aggregate,[287] and again in 2017–18 with the Spanish club progressing 4–3;[288] both times they went on to win the competition. Another match that is often played in the European Cup/Champions League is Real Madrid vs Juventus, the most decorated Italian club. They have played each other in 21 matches and have an almost perfectly balanced record (nine wins for Juventus, ten wins for Real Madrid and two draws), as well as nearly the same goal difference (Madrid ahead 26 to 25).[289][290][291] Their first meeting was in the quarter-finals of the 1961–62 European Cup, which Real Madrid won 3–1 in a replay held in Paris.[290] At the quarter-final stage in 1995–96, Juventus prevailed 2–1 over the two legs and went on to lift the trophy.[290] In the 1998 UEFA Champions League Final between the teams in Amsterdam, Real Madrid won 1–0.[290][292] They met again in the 2002–03 UEFA Champions League semi-finals, when both clubs were in their respective 'golden eras'; Juventus won 4–3 on aggregate.[290] By that time, star midfielder Zinedine Zidane, who played for the Bianconeri in the 1998 final, had moved from Turin to Madrid in a world record €77 million deal.[293] The teams met again in the 2013–14 UEFA Champions League group stage, with Madrid winning 2–1 at home and drawing 2–2 away en route to their tenth title. In the 2014–15 UEFA Champions League semi-finals, former Real Madrid player Álvaro Morata scored one goal in each leg to take Juventus to the final, winning 3–2 on aggregate, while Cristiano Ronaldo scored both goals for Madrid.[290] They faced off again in the 2017 UEFA Champions League Final in Cardiff, with Ronaldo scoring twice as Real Madrid won 4–1.[290][294][295] The latest Champions League meeting was in the 2017–18 quarter-finals, which Real Madrid won 4–3 on aggregate; the tie ended in dramatic and controversial fashion, with a debatable penalty awarded to Real Madrid in the last minute of the second leg after Juventus built a 3–0 lead at the Bernabeu to pull level in the tie following a defeat at the Allianz Stadium by the same scoreline.[296][297] Cristiano Ronaldo scored three goals over the two matches including the decisive penalty and a spectacular overhead kick,[298] and having won the Champions League with Madrid for a fourth time,[299] he transferred to Juventus a few months later for a €117 million fee.[300] It was under Florentino Pérez's first presidency (2000–2006) that Real Madrid started its ambition of becoming the world's richest professional football club.[301] The club ceded part of its training grounds to the city of Madrid in 2001, and sold the rest to four corporations: Repsol YPF, Mutua Automovilística de Madrid, Sacyr Vallehermoso and OHL. The sale eradicated the club's debts, paving the way for it to buy the world's most expensive players, such as Zinedine Zidane, Luís Figo, Ronaldo and David Beckham. The city had previously rezoned the training grounds for development, a move which in turn increased their value, and then bought the site.[79] The European Commission started an investigation into whether the city overpaid for the property, to be considered a form of state subsidy.[302] The sale of the training ground for office buildings cleared Real Madrid's debts of €270 million and enabled the club to embark upon an unprecedented spending spree which brought big-name players to the club. In addition, profit from the sale was spent on a state-of-the-art training complex on the city's outskirts.[303] Although Pérez's policy resulted in increased financial success from the exploitation of the club's high marketing potential around the world, especially in Asia, it came under increasing criticism for being too focused on marketing the Real Madrid brand and not enough on the performances of the team.[82] By September 2007, Real Madrid was considered the most valuable football brand in Europe by BBDO. In 2008, it was ranked the second-most valuable club in world football, at €951 million (£640 million / $1.285 billion),[304] only beaten by Manchester United, which was valued at €1.333 billion (£900 million).[305] In 2010, Real Madrid had the highest turnover in football worldwide.[306] In September 2009, Real Madrid's management announced plans to open the club's own dedicated theme park by 2013.[307] A study at Harvard University concluded that Real Madrid \"is one of the 20 most important brand names and the only one in which its executives, the players, are well-known. We have some spectacular figures in regard to worldwide support of the club. There are an estimated 287 million people worldwide who follow Real Madrid.\"[308] In 2010, Forbes evaluated Real Madrid's worth to be around €992 million (US$1.323 billion), ranking them second only to Manchester United, based on figures from the 2008–09 season.[309][310] According to Deloitte, Real Madrid had a recorded revenue of €401 million in the same period, ranking first.[311] Along with Barcelona, Athletic Bilbao and Osasuna, Real Madrid is organised as a registered association. This means that the club is owned by its supporters, who elect the president. The president cannot invest his own money,[312] and the club can only spend what it earns, which is mainly derived through sponsorships, commercial partnerships, merchandise sales, television rights, prize money and ticket sales. Unlike a limited company, it is not possible to purchase shares in the club, but only a membership.[313] The members of Real Madrid, called \"socios\", form an assembly of delegates which is the highest governing body of the club.[314] As of 2010, the club had 60,000 socios.[315] At the end of the 2009–10 season, the club's board of directors stated that Real Madrid had a net debt of €244.6 million, €82.1 million lower than the previous fiscal year. Real Madrid announced that it had a net debt of €170 million after the 2010–11 season. From 2007 to 2011, the club made a net profit of €190 million.[316][317] During the 2009–10 season, Real Madrid made €150 million through ticket sales, the most of any club in top-flight football.[316] Real Madrid has the highest number of shirt sales per season, around 1.5 million.[316] For the 2010–11 season, Madrid's wage bill totalled €169 million, which was second-highest in Europe behind Barcelona;[318] furthermore, its wage bill to turnover ratio was the best in Europe at 43 percent, ahead of Manchester United and Arsenal at 46 percent and 50 percent, respectively. In 2013, Forbes listed the club as the world's most valuable sports team, worth $3.3 billion.[319] Real Madrid was valued at €3.47 billion ($4.1 billion) in 2018, and in the 2016–17 season it was the second highest-earning football club in the world, with an annual revenue of €674.6 million.[320] In November 2018, the average first-team pay at Madrid was £8.1m ($10.6m) per year, making it the second-highest paid sports team in the world after Barcelona.[321][322] In 2022, Forbes listed Real Madrid as the most valuable football club in the world, at $5.1 billion.[323] Real Madrid was the featured club in the second installment of the Goal! football movie trilogy, Goal! 2: Living the Dream... (2007). The film follows former Newcastle United star Santiago Muñez as he is first scouted and then signed by Real Madrid for the 2005–06 season. The film's creators wanted to put emphasis on the changes in Muñez's life after his move to Madrid. Production was done with the full support of UEFA, allowing the film crew to use many real life players in cameo roles. Real Madrid squad members featured in the film included Iker Casillas, Zinedine Zidane, David Beckham, Ronaldo, Roberto Carlos, Raúl, Sergio Ramos, Robinho, Michael Owen, Míchel Salgado, Júlio Baptista, Steve McManaman and Iván Helguera. Non-Real Madrid players to make cameo appearances included Ronaldinho, Thierry Henry, Lionel Messi, Samuel Eto'o, Andrés Iniesta, Pablo Aimar, Freddie Ljungberg, Cesc Fàbregas and Santiago Cañizares. In the film, both Florentino Pérez and Alfredo Di Stéfano presented the fictional player Muñez to the club after his signing.[324] Real, The Movie is a 2005 part feature, part documentary film that showcases the worldwide passion for Real Madrid. Produced by the club and directed by Borja Manso, it follows five sub-stories of fans from around the world and their love for the club. Along with the fictional portion of the film, it also contains real footage of the squad, during training at Ciudad Real Madrid, matches, and interviews. Although the film mentions all of the squad, it mainly focuses on galácticos such as David Beckham, Zinedine Zidane, Raúl, Luís Figo, Ronaldo, Iker Casillas and Roberto Carlos, among others. The film was originally produced in Spanish, but has been dubbed for their worldwide fanbase. The book White Storm: 100 years of Real Madrid by Phil Ball was the first English-language history of Real Madrid. Published in 2002, it talks about the most successful moments of the club during its first centenary, having been translated into various languages. In late 2011, Real Madrid released a digital music album, entitled Legends, and a remix of the club's anthem, \"Himno del Real Madrid,\" was released as the first single from the album.[325] Real Madrid TV is an encrypted digital television channel, operated by Real Madrid and specialising in the club. The channel is available in Spanish and English. It is located at Ciudad Real Madrid in Valdebebas (Madrid), Real Madrid's training centre. Hala Madrid is a magazine published quarterly for the Real Madrid club members and the Madridistas Fan Club card holders.[326] The phrase Hala Madrid, meaning \"Forward Madrid\" or \"Go Madrid\", is also the title of the club's official anthem, which is often sung by the Madridistas (the club's fans).[6] The magazine includes reports on the club's matches in the previous month, as well as information about the reserve and youth teams. Features often include interviews with players, both past and present, and the club's historic matches.[326] Real Madrid has appeared in many football-based video games, namely in the FIFA, EA Sports FC, and Pro Evolution Soccer series. A Real Madrid player has appeared on the cover of both titles a combined seven times. In 2007, Spanish game publisher Virgin Play signed a deal with the club to make officially licensed Real Madrid video games. The only one released under the deal (due to Virgin Play's liquidation in September 2009) would end up being Real Madrid: The Game, which was developed by Atomic Planet Entertainment and was published under Virgin Play's publishing division V.2 Play in May 2009 for the PlayStation 2, PlayStation Portable, Windows, Wii and Nintendo DS exclusively in European territories Virgin Play released their products in. The game featured a career mode with a mixture of role-playing and simulation as well as arcade-styled Football gameplay. Spanish teams are limited to three players without EU citizenship. The squad list includes only the principal nationality of each player; several non-European players on the squad have dual citizenship with an EU country. Also, players from the ACP countries in Africa, the Caribbean, and the Pacific that are signatories to the Cotonou Agreement are not counted against non-EU quotas due to the Kolpak ruling. Note: Flags indicate national team as defined under FIFA eligibility rules; some limited exceptions apply. Players may hold more than one non-FIFA nationality.

Real Madrid was officially founded in 1902, though its history can be traced back to 1897. It joined the Royal Spanish Football Federation in 1909. Real Madrid has won 15 European Cup/Champions League titles, far more than any other team. Real Madrid has won the Copa del Rey, Spain’s main football cup competition, 20 times. Real Madrid played at several venues until club president Santiago Bernabéu spearheaded the construction of the stadium that today bears his name. Opened in 1947, the Bernabéu holds more than 80,000 spectators. Real Madrid's biggest rivalry is with FC Barcelona. Matches between Barcelona and Real Madrid are known as El Clásico (“The Classic”). Real Madrid, Spanish professional football (soccer) club based in Madrid. Known for their all-white uniforms, which led to its nickname “Los Blancos,” Real Madrid is one of the world’s best-known teams. Real Madrid grew out of Football Club Sky, a team formed in Madrid in 1897. The club was officially founded in 1902 and joined the Royal Spanish Football Federation in 1909. Real Madrid played at a variety of venues until ambitious club president Santiago Bernabéu spearheaded the construction of the stadium that bears his name. Opened in 1947, the Bernabéu holds more than 80,000 spectators and was the venue for the 1982 Fédération Internationale de Football Association (FIFA) World Cup final. The European Cup was first held during the 1955–56 season, with a prestigious field consisting of clubs that had won their own country’s league championship. Real Madrid was the tournament’s first winner, defeating French club Stade de Reims in the final. It continued on a run of European dominance that no team has matched since. Gifted players such as Ferenc Puskás, Alfredo Di Stéfano, Paco Gento, Hector Rial, and Miguel Muñoz helped the club win the first five European Cups in a row. The club’s play in the 1960 European Cup final against the West German team Eintracht Frankfurt—a 7–3 Real victory—is widely considered one of the finest club performances of all time. Real has won a total of 15 European Cup/Champions League titles, far more than any other team. 1956, 1957, 1958, 1959, 1960, 1966, 1998, 2000, 2002, 2014, 2016, 2017, 2018, 2022, 2024 Real Madrid has won more Spanish top-division (La Liga) championships (36) than any other Spanish side. The club has also won the Copa del Rey, the main Spanish cup competition, 20 times and the Supercopa de España (Spanish Super Cup) 13 times. It won UEFA Cup twice, in 1985 and 1986. Real’s local competition is Atlético Madrid, but the club’s biggest rivalry is with FC Barcelona. The tension between the football clubs from Spain’s two biggest cities was amplified by a struggle between the teams in the 1950s to sign Di Stéfano, who reneged on a proposed deal with Barcelona to sign with Madrid, helping Real become a football power in the 1950s and ’60s. Matches between Barcelona and Real Madrid are known as El Clásico (“The Classic”) and are watched throughout Spain, in large part because the two sides symbolize for many the ongoing political and cultural difficulties between Castilian (Real) and Catalonian (Barcelona) Spain. From the late 1990s Real Madrid spent enormous sums on luring some of the world’s most famous foreign players to the club, where they are known as galácticos (“superstars”). Those players were often the most expensive (by transfer fee) footballers in the world and included such stars as David Beckham, Luis Figo, Ronaldo, Zinedine Zidane, Kaká, Cristiano Ronaldo, and James Rodriguez. Sergio Ramos and Iker Casillas are other notable players of this era. Following his departure from Paris Saint-Germain after the 2023–24 season, Kylian Mbappé joined Real Madrid.",

                "title": "Matt Gaetz - Wikipedia",
                "content": "Matthew Louis Gaetz II (/ɡeɪts/ GAYTS; born May 7, 1982) is an American politician and lawyer who served as the U.S. representative for Florida's 1st congressional district from 2017 until his resignation in 2024. His district included all of Escambia, Okaloosa, and Santa Rosa counties, and portions of Walton County. A member of the Republican Party and a self-described libertarian populist, Gaetz is widely regarded as a proponent of far-right politics as well as a staunch ally of Donald Trump.[1] In October 2023, Gaetz filed a motion to vacate which led to the removal of Kevin McCarthy as speaker of the U.S. House of Representatives. The son of prominent Florida politician Don Gaetz and grandson of North Dakota politician Jerry Gaetz, Gaetz was raised in Fort Walton Beach, Florida. After graduating from William & Mary Law School, he briefly worked in private practice before running for state representative. He served in the Florida House of Representatives from 2010 until 2016, and received national attention for defending Florida's \"stand-your-ground law\". In 2016, he was elected to the U.S. House of Representatives, and was re-elected in 2018, 2020, 2022, and 2024. In 2020, Gaetz was accused of sex trafficking and having sexual relationships with minors. After an investigation, the United States Department of Justice (DOJ) decided not to charge him. Prior to his resignation as a representative, Gaetz was being investigated by the House Ethics Committee. In December 2024, the House Ethics Committee released a report which found evidence that Gaetz paid for sex—including with a 17-year-old—and abused illegal drugs during his tenure in the U.S. House of Representatives.[2] On November 13, 2024, president-elect Donald Trump announced he would nominate Gaetz to serve as United States attorney general, which was received badly by some Senate Republicans. Upon Trump's announcement, Gaetz resigned from the House of Representatives. A week later, Gaetz withdrew himself from consideration for the post of attorney general. Though he had already won re-election to the 119th United States Congress, he submitted a letter of resignation prior to the swearing in. Gaetz started hosting a political talk show airing weeknights on One America News Network, airing from January 2025 onwards. Matthew Louis Gaetz II was born on May 7, 1982, in Hollywood, Florida, to Victoria (née Quertermous) and Don Gaetz, who later became a prominent local politician,[3][4][5] earning Matthew Gaetz the nickname \"Baby Gaetz\".[6] He has a younger sister.[7] He grew up in a conservative and religious family near Fort Walton Beach, and graduated from Niceville High School.[8][9] He graduated from Florida State University in 2003 with a Bachelor of Science in interdisciplinary sciences, and from the William & Mary Law School in 2007 with a Juris Doctor.[10][11] Gaetz was admitted to the Florida Bar on February 6, 2008.[12] Gaetz's father represented parts of northwest Florida as a member of the Florida State Senate from 2006 to 2016, was Senate president from 2012 to 2014, and was elected to the Florida Senate again in 2024.[13] Gaetz's grandfather, Jerry Gaetz, was the mayor of Rugby, North Dakota, and a candidate for lieutenant governor of North Dakota at the 1964 North Dakota Republican Party state convention, where he died of a heart attack.[14] After graduating from law school,[15] Gaetz worked at the law firm Keefe, Anchors & Gordon (now AnchorsGordon)[16] in Fort Walton Beach.[7] In October 2021, the Florida bar suspended Gaetz from practicing law due to unpaid fees.[17] He was reinstated after the $265 fee was paid.[18] In March 2010, after Republican state representative Ray Sansom's resignation on corruption charges in February 2010,[19] Gaetz ran in the special election to succeed Sansom in the 4th district, which included southern Santa Rosa County and Okaloosa County.[20] In a crowded Republican primary that included Craig Barker, Kabe Woods, Jerry G. Melvin, and Bill Garvie, Gaetz won with 43 percent of the vote.[20] In the special general election, Gaetz defeated Democratic nominee Jan Fernald with 66 percent of the vote.[21] During his campaign, Gaetz received almost $480,000 in contributions, about five times more than anyone else in the field, and almost 50 times more than Fernald, including $100,000 of his own money.[7] Gaetz was unopposed for a full term in 2010.[22] In 2012, following the reconfiguration of Florida House of Representatives districts, Gaetz's district no longer contained any of Santa Rosa County. He was reelected unopposed in 2012[23] and 2014.[24] While serving in the state house, Gaetz and state senator Joe Negron proposed legislation that would hasten the execution of many inmates on Florida's death row by requiring the governor to sign an execution warrant for those who had exhausted their appeals.[25] He also joined state senator Greg Evers in proposing legislation to eliminate the federal ethanol content mandate that 10 percent of gasoline sold in Florida contain ethanol;[26][27] Governor Rick Scott signed the legislation in May 2013.[28] In 2015, Gaetz was one of two members to vote against a Florida bill which criminalized revenge porn, due to \"personal animosity\". He had successfully blocked the bill previously.[29] Florida House speaker Will Weatherford announced that he would order hearings on the stand-your-ground law.[30] Gaetz, the chairman of the Criminal Justice Subcommittee, was tasked with reviewing the legislation; he announced before hearings that he would not support changing \"one damn comma\", but said he would listen to both sides' testimony.[31][32] After the hearings, he authored legislation to allow defendants who successfully used a stand-your-ground defense during trial to be able to expunge relevant information from their criminal records.[33] When his subcommittee was considering legislation that would keep suspects' mugshots off the Internet until their convictions, Gaetz brought up his 2008 arrest and non-conviction, arguing that his mistakes made him who he is and that publicly available mugshots \"could be a problem for those unaccustomed to publicity\".[34] In 2015, Gaetz supported the presidential campaign of Jeb Bush.[35] Bush emailed Gaetz about introducing a bill to change the 2016 Florida Republican presidential primary to an earlier date in order to benefit Bush, Florida's former governor.[36] Don Gaetz, then the president of the Florida Senate, also endorsed Bush, along with several other members of Florida's state legislature.[37] In 2013, Gaetz announced that, in 2016, he would run for the 1st district State Senate seat held by his father, Don Gaetz, who was term-limited in 2016.[38] On March 21, 2016, Gaetz withdrew from the race, choosing instead to run for the U.S. House seat representing Florida's 1st congressional district; the incumbent, Jeff Miller, had announced 11 days earlier that he would not seek reelection.[39] On August 30, 2016, Gaetz won the Republican primary with 35.7 percent of the vote to Greg Evers's 21.5 percent and Cris Dosev's 20.6 percent, along with five other candidates.[40] This virtually assured Gaetz of victory in the general election; with a Cook Partisan Voting Index of R+22, the 1st is Florida's most Republican district, and one of the most Republican in the nation. In the November 8 general election, Gaetz defeated Democratic nominee Steven Specht with 69 percent of the vote.[41] He is only the seventh person to represent this district since 1933 (the district was numbered the 3rd before 1963). Though a financial disclosure form Gaetz filed in 2016 showed a net worth of $388,000, he donated $200,000 of his own money to his congressional campaign. He also resigned from two Florida House political action committees he had started and chaired; the PACs closed down and transferred $380,000 to a federal super PAC, North Florida Neighbors, whose purpose was to support Gaetz's congressional campaign.[7] Following the death of Miami Marlins pitcher José Fernández, Gaetz criticized the athletes protesting during the national anthem in a tweet on September 25, 2016.[42][43] Gaetz was listed as a member of the moderate Republican Main Street Partnership from at least January to June 2017.[44][45][46] Gaetz served as a top campaign adviser to Ron DeSantis during his 2018 gubernatorial campaign. He managed debate preparations and \"drafted early administration organizational charts, helped steer early policy decisions and played a huge role in DeSantis' appointments\", according to Politico.[47] Gaetz hired Darren Beattie as a speechwriter in April 2019. Beattie had previously been fired as a speechwriter for the Trump administration after attending a conference associated with white nationalists.[48] Gaetz attended political rallies in 2018 and 2019 at which members of the Proud Boys were present.[49][50] After the 2020 State of the Union Address, Gaetz filed an ethics complaint against speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi, arguing that she had committed a \"flagrant violation of decorum\" and perhaps broken the law by ripping up her copy of the speech.[51] Gaetz announced that he would no longer accept campaign contributions from federal political action committees in February 2020.[52] House Republican leader Kevin McCarthy complained on a January 10, 2021, phone call that Gaetz was unnecessarily \"putting people in jeopardy\", noting that the rioters at the U.S. Capitol on January 6 \"came prepared with rope\". The conversation was reported in April 2022.[53] Gaetz and Georgia representative Marjorie Taylor Greene began a nationwide \"America First Tour\" on May 7, 2021, in The Villages, Florida.[54] During the tour, Gaetz and Greene repeated debunked claims of fraud in the 2020 election, attacked Big Tech and, at one event, argued that the Second Amendment was for \"maintaining, within the citizenry, the ability to maintain an armed rebellion against the government, if that becomes necessary.\"[55][56] As a consequence of the controversy the speakers had generated, their appearance at a conference site at Laguna Hills, in Orange County, California, was canceled.[57] Gaetz was one of 21 House Republicans to vote against a resolution to give the Congressional Gold Medal to police officers who defended the U.S. Capitol on January 6 in June 2021.[58] Gaetz invited Corey Ryan Beekman to lead the pledge of allegiance at a Judiciary Committee hearing in February 2023. Beekman was charged with murder in 2019 in Michigan, and the victim's family criticized the invitation.[59][60][61] Gaetz apologized to the family.[62] Republicans regained a narrow House majority in the 2022 midterm elections. Although sitting minority Leader Kevin McCarthy sought the speakership and had the support of 213 members, he needed five more votes to reach a majority to be elected. Certain members of the Freedom Caucus, including Gaetz, could contribute the required margin. Democrats held 212 votes, with one seat unfilled due to the November death of a holdover incumbent. The anti-McCarthy members withheld more than four votes through 14 ballots. They were thought to be holding out for substantial concessions regarding House rules and committee chair assignments. Their withholding of votes prevented McCarthy earning a majority of votes needed for the speakership.[63] Thirteen months earlier, Gaetz had discussed with former president Trump the possibility of getting Trump elected to the speakership, for which House membership is not required.[64] Gaetz nominated him once and voted for Trump on the 7th, 8th and 11th ballots.[65] After midnight, January 7, on the 15th and last ballot, Gaetz switched his vote to \"present\", lowering the number of votes McCarthy needed and allowing him to win the speakership.[66] On October 2, 2023, Gaetz filed a resolution to oust McCarthy from his role as speaker of the U.S. House of Representatives after the latter had negotiated with Democrats to pass a shutdown-averting continuing resolution which did not include fiscally conservative reforms.[67][68] Gaetz's resolution ended up passing by a vote of 216–210.[69] In April 2024, McCarthy accused Gaetz of filing the motion to oust him as a means of protecting himself against allegations of having had sex with a 17-year-old minor.[70][71][72] According to McCarthy, the House ethics committee had been investigating the case since 2021, prior to McCarthy's appointment as speaker of the House.[73] On February 26, 2019, the night before the scheduled public hearing of Michael Cohen, Trump's former personal attorney, before the House Oversight Committee, Gaetz directed a tweet to Cohen that implied without evidence that Cohen had had multiple extramarital affairs and also suggested his wife might be unfaithful while he was imprisoned due to new information disclosed to her.[74] Other members of Congress saw the tweet as an attempt to intimidate a witness.[75][76] Gaetz initially defended his tweet, saying it was part of \"witness testing, not witness tampering\" and \"I don't threaten anybody.\" Asked to clarify, he said his \"tweet speaks for itself\".[77][78] After sharp criticism from other members of Congress and an implicit rebuke by speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi,[79][80] Gaetz deleted the tweet and posted a tweet in which he apologized.[78][76][81] Despite not being a member of the House Oversight Committee,[78] Gaetz appeared at Cohen's hearing, saying that he wanted to observe and ask questions.[82] During the hearing, U.S. Virgin Islands delegate Stacey Plaskett, a member of the Oversight Committee, recommended that Gaetz be referred to both the House Ethics Committee and criminal prosecutors for witness intimidation and tampering.[80][83] After the hearing, Gaetz reportedly texted an apology to Cohen, who thanked him for it.[84] The Florida Bar opened an investigation into Gaetz for the tweet,[85][86] as did the House Ethics Committee.[87] In August 2019, the Florida Bar announced it had found no probable cause that Gaetz had violated its rules.[88] Politico reported in April 2020 that Gaetz had spent nearly $200,000 of taxpayer funds renting an office from Collier Merrill, a Pensacola real estate developer and restaurateur and longtime friend, adviser, campaign donor, and legal client.[89] Gaetz and Merrill separately told Politico that Gaetz paid below-market rent for the space, but Gaetz later said that the rent was \"at or below market rate\".[90] House rules explicitly disallow below-market rentals, and require that parties to such leases \"have [not] had, [n]or continue to have, a professional or legal relationship (except as a landlord and tenant)\".[89] On July 1, 2020, the Office of Congressional Ethics notified Gaetz it had terminated its review of the lease arrangements.[91] In July 2020, Politico reported that its investigation had found expenditures by Gaetz that appeared to violate the House ethics rules: spending tens of thousands of dollars for a speech-writing consultant and having a private company install a television studio in his father's home in Niceville, Florida, which Gaetz uses when he appears on television.[92] Gaetz's office acknowledged that he spent $28,000 on speech-writing services, which is prohibited by House rules except in special circumstances and with prior approval from congressional officials, but said that it was a clerical error that would be fixed.[93][94] Of the television studio, Gaetz said that the company received $100 per month from his office, an amount not reported in his congressional spending records, and also charged television networks each time a network connected to the studio.[92] A statement from Gaetz's office said the arrangement complied with House rules, and that during the setup process, his office consulted with the House Ethics Committee and the House Administration Committee.[94] Gaetz and a dozen other Republican House members skipped votes and enlisted others to vote for them in late February 2021, citing the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. But he and the other members were actually attending the Conservative Political Action Conference, which was held at the same time as their absences.[95] In response, the Campaign for Accountability, an ethics watchdog group, filed a complaint with the House Committee on Ethics and requested an investigation into Gaetz and the other lawmakers.[96] The Intercept reported in March 2023 that Gaetz had hired Derrick Miller as his military legislative aide. Miller spent eight years in prison after he was convicted of murdering a civilian during his army service in Afghanistan.[97] For the 118th Congress:[98] President-elect Trump announced he would nominate Gaetz to serve as United States attorney general on November 13, 2024.[104] Gaetz resigned from the U.S. House of Representatives shortly after the announcement.[105] His planned nomination was received negatively by multiple Senate Republicans, several of whom indicated that they would not support it due to standing allegations against him and perceived lack of qualifications.[106][107] On November 21, 2024, Gaetz announced on X that he was withdrawing his name from consideration as attorney general to avoid complicating the Trump transition.[108][109] The next day, he said he did not intend to join the 119th Congress, though he had already won reelection.[110] He later confirmed his resignation in writing.[111] Florida Governor Ron DeSantis requested that an interim election be held in Gaetz's former Florida district to fill his House seat, as is the constitutional procedure when there is a resignation.[112] In January 2025, Gaetz began hosting a 9 p.m. Eastern weeknight political talk show on One America News Network.[113] Gaetz has self-identified as a \"libertarian populist\".[114] Observers have described his views as far-right.[1] In January 2018, Gaetz invited Charles C. Johnson, an alt-right activist and Holocaust denier, to attend Donald Trump's State of the Union address.[115] Johnson previously raised money for the neo-Nazi website The Daily Stormer.[116] Gaetz defended Johnson in an interview, saying that Johnson was neither a Holocaust denier nor a white supremacist.[115] Gaetz has endorsed the white nationalist Great Replacement theory. In 2021, he called the Anti-Defamation League a \"racist organization\" after it condemned Tucker Carlson's promotion of Great Replacement theory. Gaetz said that Carlson \"is CORRECT about Replacement Theory as he explains what is happening to America.\"[117][118] Gaetz was an early supporter of Trump and his appeal to the Republican Party base, echoing his talking points. In several commercials during his 2016 congressional campaign, Gaetz promised to \"kill Muslim terrorists and build the wall\".[119] In a September 2022 episode of Steve Bannon's War Room podcast, Gaetz said that Republicans should prioritize \"impeachment inquiries\" against Democrats \"to investigate them and to hold them accountable\" if Republicans won the 2022 U.S. House of Representatives elections. He added, \"it should be investigations [of Democrats] first—[and] policy, bill-making, to support the lobbyists and the PACs, as a far, far diminished priority.\"[120] Gaetz has introduced legislation to reclassify cannabis from Schedule I to Schedule III under the Controlled Substances Act.[121][122] He has also introduced legislation to loosen federal restrictions on the cultivation of cannabis for research purposes.[123][124] Gaetz has criticized the federal government for having \"lied to the American people for a generation\" about the medical benefits of cannabis.[125] As a member of the Florida House, he sponsored a bill, eventually signed into law,[126] to expand the state's Right to Try Act to include the medical use of cannabis.[127][128] In September 2017, Gaetz keynoted the American Medical Marijuana Physicians Association's annual conference.[129] In November 2019, Gaetz was one of only two Republicans on the House Judiciary Committee to vote for the Marijuana Opportunity Reinvestment and Expungement (MORE) Act, which among other reforms sought to remove cannabis from the Controlled Substances Act.[130] He was also the only Republican cosponsor of the bill (of 55 cosponsors) at the time of its passage.[131] Gaetz introduced the STATES Act to prevent federal interference in states that have legalized cannabis for medical or recreational purposes.[132] Gaetz said he had multiple conversations with President Trump about cannabis policy.[133] Nonetheless, Gaetz did not find positions on marijuana to be a dealbreaker in the 2024 Republican Speaker nominee selection, repeatedly supporting anti-cannabis candidates.[134][135][136] Worried about protesters disrupting his appearance at his town hall in Pace, Florida, Gaetz prepared what his staffers called a nonverbal town hall on February 23, 2017. He printed out part of his speech onto giant boards that he would hold up if he was unable to speak.[137] Gaetz arrived 30 minutes late to the meeting, where at least 500 constituents crowded into a bowling alley. At the meeting, he was questioned about his relationship with Trump, his stance on repealing the Affordable Care Act, and his proposal to abolish the Environmental Protection Agency. He said that Trump should release his tax returns, but stopped short of saying Congress should subpoena them. Gaetz closed his town hall by shouting Trump's 2016 campaign slogan, \"Make America Great Again\".[138][139][140] Gaetz is seen as a vocal ally of Trump.[141] Politico called Gaetz \"one of the most enthusiastic defenders of president Trump on cable news\" and a \"proud Trump protégé\" in April 2018.[142] Aaron Blake of The Washington Post called him one of Congress' \"most controversial members\", and one who has \"unabashedly aligned himself with Trump on basically all things\".[74][143] In May 2018, Gaetz was one of 18 House Republicans to vote to nominate Trump for the Nobel Peace Prize for his role in peace talks with North Korea.[144][145] Appearing on The View in February 2020, shortly before Trump associate Roger Stone was sentenced, Gaetz said he would support a pardon for Stone.[146] Gaetz is a member of the House Judiciary Committee, but not of the Intelligence, Foreign Affairs, or Oversight and Reform Committees, and so was not allowed to join lawmakers' closed-door deposition of former White House Russia aide Fiona Hill in October 2019. He told reporters that, since his committee oversees impeachment, he should have been allowed to be part of depositions related to the Trump impeachment inquiry.[147] On April 6, The New York Times reported that during the final weeks of Trump's first presidency, Gaetz privately asked the White House for a blanket pardon for himself and some unknown congressional allies for any crimes they may have committed.[148] The White House reportedly never seriously considered the request, because it was decided that issuing preemptive pardons would set a bad precedent.[149][150][148] The Times also reported that aides had told Trump of the request. On April 7, Trump denied that Gaetz had asked him for a pardon and noted that Gaetz \"totally denied the accusations against him\".[151] The same day, CNN's Maggie Haberman revealed that Trump had reportedly wanted to defend Gaetz, but that his advisors talked him out of it due to the seriousness of the allegations.[152][153] In November 2017, Gaetz introduced a congressional resolution calling for Robert Mueller to recuse himself as special counsel because of what were said to be conflicts of interest.[154] He also asked for a special counsel investigation into the Federal Bureau of Investigation's handling of the Hillary Clinton email controversy, undue interference by U.S. attorney general Loretta Lynch in the investigation, and the Russian state corporation Rosatom's acquisition of Uranium One during Mueller's time as FBI director.[155][156] Gaetz said he did not trust Mueller to lead the investigation because of Mueller's alleged involvement in approval of the Uranium One deal and alleged close relationship with dismissed FBI director James Comey, a probable person of interest in a proposed new investigation.[157][158] After Ohio congressman Jim Jordan denied that he was aware of the sexual abuse of Ohio State University wrestlers during the period when Jordan was a coach there,[159] Gaetz said that the allegations came from people in the \"deep state\" and were intended to reduce the credibility of Jordan's criticism of Mueller's investigation of the Trump campaign and Russia.[160][161] Gaetz said of then–U.S. attorney general Jeff Sessions that \"over at the Department of Justice, he's got Stockholm syndrome, he's become sympathetic with his captors over there in the Deep State.\"[162] During Mueller's testimony to two congressional committees on July 24, 2019, Gaetz told him, \"If Russians were lying to Christopher Steele to undermine our confidence in our newly elected president, that would be precisely in your purview because you stated in your opening that the organizing principle was to fully and thoroughly investigate Russian interference. But you weren't interested in whether the Russians interfered through Steele—and if Steele was lying, then you should have charged him with lying like you charged a variety of other people.\"[163] In October 2019, Gaetz organized a \"storming\" of a Sensitive Compartmented Information Facility on Capitol Hill by about two dozen Republican congressmen, including House minority whip Steve Scalise, in an effort to sit in on and hear the deposition of a Pentagon official during the impeachment inquiry into Trump. The congressmens' cell phones and other devices put the secure facility, and U.S. national security, at risk.[164][165][166] One committee member said, \"It was the closest thing I've seen around here to mass civil unrest as a member of Congress.\"[167][168] House Homeland Security Committee chairman Bennie Thompson of Mississippi wrote to the House sergeant-at-arms about Gaetz and others, requesting that he take action regarding their \"unprecedented breach of security\". South Carolina's senior U.S. senator, Lindsey Graham, admonished the House members, calling them \"nuts\" for having made a \"run on the SCIF\".[169][166] Ohio representative Jim Jordan said, \"The members have just had it, and they want to be able to see and represent their constituents and find out what's going on.\"[166] A day later, Jordan appeared on Fox News to justify the intrusion, saying of the chair of the committee: \"Adam Schiff is doing this unfair, partisan process in secret and our members finally said, 'Enough'. We're so frustrated. They reached a boiling point and these guys marched in and said we want to know what's going on.\"[169] In the 116th Congress, Pelosi, who is a committee member ex officio, appointed Schiff and 12 Democratic members of the House Intelligence Committee.[170] House minority leader Kevin McCarthy, also an ex officio member, appointed the ranking member, Devin Nunes, and eight other Republicans to the committee.[171] Each side got equal time to question witnesses.[167] The disruption delayed Deputy Assistant Defense Secretary Laura Cooper's testimony by many hours.[165][166] On January 7, 2021, after Trump supporters violently broke into the U.S. Capitol, Gaetz falsely blamed antifa for the attack, suggesting that rioters were \"masquerading as Trump supporters\".[172][173] Joel Valdez, a senior communications aide to Gaetz, posted a video on Parler hours before the storming of the Capitol with the caption \"From the top of the Capitol office buildings, WE HEAR YOU LOUD AND CLEAR! #StopTheSteal\".[174] Gaetz voted against the second impeachment of Donald Trump. Gaetz co-sponsored a resolution by Andy Biggs to impeach Secretary of Homeland Security Alejandro Mayorkas in August 2021.[175] Later that month, Gaetz co-sponsored a resolution by Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene to impeach president Biden.[176] In September 2022, he called impeaching Biden a \"priority\".[177] He expressed the belief that many Republicans in Congress were hesitant to impeach Biden, but that Republican voters would feel \"betrayed\" if they did not.[178] Very early into the 118th Congress, Gaetz cosponsored another resolution to impeach Mayorkas.[179] In May 2023, Gaetz co-sponsored resolutions by Marjorie Taylor Greene to impeach Biden and Mayorkas.[180][181] During an invitation-only video conference moderated by Steve Bannon days after a Biden impeachment inquiry was opened in September 2023, Gaetz denounced the impeachment effort as a political stunt. Gaetz said, \"I don't believe that we are endeavoring upon a legitimate impeachment of Joe Biden ... I think it's for the sake of having another bad thing to say about Joe Biden.\"[182] Gaetz voted for the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017.[183] He acknowledged that the bill's pass-through tax deduction would benefit Trump, but added, \"so many Americans benefit when commercial real estate becomes easier and more accessible.\"[184] Gaetz was among the 71 Republicans who voted against final passage of the Fiscal Responsibility Act of 2023 in the House.[185] Gaetz acknowledged global warming in 2016 but said he disagrees with the scientific consensus on climate change that human activity is the primary cause.[186] In April 2017, the Center for American Progress and Vice Media said Gaetz was a climate change denier, citing his 2016 statements.[187][non-primary source needed][188] Gaetz proposed legislation to abolish the Environmental Protection Agency in January 2017, claiming that it hurts small businesses via the costs associated with compliance.[27][189] Gaetz joined the bipartisan Climate Solutions Caucus in November 2017.[190][191] He said he advocated technological innovation and economic incentives that address climate change, and increased federal funds for global warming research by NASA, NOAA and universities, but remained opposed to increased environmental regulation.[192] Gaetz and Democratic Representative Scott Peters introduced the bipartisan Super Pollutants Act, which aimed to slow climate change by regulating greenhouses gases, especially black carbon, hydrofluorocarbons, and methane, in 2019.[193] A press release stated, \"These short-lived climate pollutants, also called super pollutants, are significantly more potent than carbon dioxide.\"[194] In 2021, Gaetz was one of 14 House Republicans to vote against a measure condemning the Myanmar coup d'état that overwhelmingly passed, for reasons reported to be unclear.[195] On October 12, 2017, Gaetz introduced a resolution affirming the connection between the Jewish people and Jerusalem and condemning UNESCO's efforts to the contrary.[196] In December 2017, he supported Trump's decision to recognize Jerusalem as Israel's capital and said that the move would pressure Palestine to recognize Israel.[197] In 2019, Gaetz was one of 60 representatives to vote against condemning Trump's withdrawal from Syria.[198] In April 2019, after the House passed a resolution withdrawing American support for the Saudi Arabian-led intervention in Yemen, Gaetz was one of nine lawmakers to sign a letter to Trump requesting a meeting with him and urging him to sign Senate Joint Resolution 7, which invokes the War Powers Act of 1973, to end unauthorized US military participation in the Saudi-led coalition's armed conflict against Houthi forces in Yemen.[199] In June 2021, Gaetz was one of 49 House Republicans to vote to repeal the Authorization for Use of Military Force Against Iraq Resolution of 2002.[200][201] In 2023, Gaetz was among 47 Republicans to vote in favor of H.Con.Res. 21, which directed president Joe Biden to remove U.S. troops from Syria within 180 days.[202][203] He voted to provide Israel with support following 2023 Hamas attack on Israel.[204][205] In March 2024, Niger announced it was ending its security relationship with the United States, which had been in place since 2012.[206] In a report issued by Gaetz the following month, Gaetz stated that the United States embassy in Niger was suppressing information related to the decay of Niger-United States diplomatic relations.[206] According to Gaetz's report, Niger has not authorized flights for United States Department of Defense efforts, including the sending of food, equipment, mail, or medical supplies.[206] In April 2024, Gaetz voted against the $60 billion military aid package for Ukraine, although much of the money would have gone to his constituency.[207] On June 1, 2020, during the nationwide George Floyd protests, Gaetz tweeted, \"Now that we clearly see antifa as terrorists, can we hunt them down like we do those in the Middle East?\" In response, Twitter hid the tweet and labeled it as \"[violating] the Twitter Rules about glorifying violence\". Gaetz called the label a \"badge of honor\", accused Twitter of enabling antifa, and again said that \"[o]ur government should hunt [Antifa] down\".[208] On August 26, 2020, Gaetz tweeted \"The mob wants to destroy America. We need PATRIOTS who will defend her\"[209] in support of Kyle Rittenhouse, a 17-year-old from Antioch, Illinois, who traveled to Kenosha, Wisconsin, and shot and killed two people in self-defense during the protests of the Jacob Blake shooting.[210][211][212] Gaetz was one of three representatives to offer Rittenhouse a Congressional internship.[213] Former National Rifle Association president Marion Hammer called Gaetz \"one of the most pro-gun members to have ever served in the Florida Legislature\".[214] Gaetz is a lifetime member of the NRA,[214] and has an A+ rating from it.[215] When Gaetz served in the Florida House of Representatives, he led an unsuccessful effort to allow Floridians with concealed-weapons permits to carry those weapons openly in public.[216] In lobbying for the bill, he said that the open carry of weapons was a right \"granted not by government but by God\".[217] Gaetz supports Florida's stand-your-ground law and supported legislation that strengthened it against legal challenges.[218] He also supports concealed carry reciprocity.[218] During a May 2021 \"America First\" rally with Marjorie Taylor Greene, Gaetz told an audience: \"We have a Second Amendment in this country, and I think we have an obligation to use it!\" He then said this meant allowing Americans \"the ability to maintain an armed rebellion against the government if that becomes necessary\".[219][220] Immediately before his remarks on the Second Amendment, Gaetz criticized Big Tech companies for trying to \"suppress us, discourage us\", saying, \"Silicon Valley can't cancel this movement, or this rally, or this congressman\". As a result, politicians including Ted Lieu accused Gaetz of inciting violence against Silicon Valley employees, which Gaetz denied.[221][222] In October 2017, Gaetz argued that the Medicaid expansion permitted by the Affordable Care Act fueled the opioid crisis.[223] PolitiFact rated the claim \"mostly false\", noting that \"experts were universal in saying that the evidence that Medicaid expansion is somehow fueling the opioid crisis doesn't exist.\"[223] In June 2021, Gaetz introduced the Digital Health Pass Prevention Act (DHPPA), a bill aimed at preventing the federal government from funding and enforcing any digital passes associated with COVID-19 vaccination status, with the support of representatives Louie Gohmert and Lance Gooden.[224] The full title of the bill is \"To prohibit Federal funds from being used to implement, administer, enforce, or carry out programs with respect to digital health passes, and for other purposes.\"[225] It was sent to the House Committee on Energy and Commerce which referred it to the Subcommittee on Health. No further action was reported.[226] In early March 2020, Gaetz wore a gas mask during a House debate on funds to combat the COVID-19 pandemic.[227] He argued that wearing the gas mask was not an act of mockery but a way of \"demonstrating his concern\".[228] Several journalists characterized the decision as a stunt.[229][230][231] A few days later, on March 9, Gaetz's office reported that he had been in contact with a Conservative Political Action Conference attendee who tested positive for COVID-19. As a result, Gaetz was placed under self-quarantine for 14 days. On March 10, he said his test was negative, but that he would stay under self-quarantine until the 14-day period ended on March 12.[232] On April 14, Gaetz said the Wuhan Institute of Virology \"birthed a monster\", a reference to the hypothesis that COVID-19 was leaked out of a Chinese research lab.[233] He also stated that the National Institutes of Health had given the Institute a $3.7 million grant. The U.S.-based EcoHealth Alliance that worked with the Institute under a grant the Trump administration approved, eventually had that funding withdrawn.[233] The EcoHealth Alliance later said that, under the grant, it had enhanced a bat coronavirus so it became potentially more infectious to humans, which the NIH said was an \"unexpected result\" of the research it had funded that was carried out in partnership with the Wuhan Institute. Nevertheless, the NIH denied it had helped create the virus that sparked the COVID-19 pandemic.[234][235] After Politico reported on November 7 that Gaetz had tested positive for COVID-19, he texted Politico \"I have tested positive for antibodies\" and \"I have no live virus\". He said he had no symptoms and was not sure when he had contracted the disease.[236] On December 4, 2020, Gaetz attended an indoor New York Young Republicans Club conference in Jersey City, New Jersey, during a period of surging COVID-19 cases throughout the state and the country. He was seen posing for photos in a crowd of unmasked attendees, prompting New Jersey governor Phil Murphy and Jersey City mayor Steven Fulop to publicly condemn him. Gaetz and other GOP members mocked Democrats and their COVID-19 regulations on social media. Murphy also said state officials were investigating whether the event violated the state's COVID-19 regulations.[237] After a contentious House committee hearing on June 10, 2021, Gaetz said a Chinese whistle-blower possessed text messages and documents concerning COVID-19's origins that US government investigators had failed to pursue.[238] On July 31, Gaetz said of COVID-19 variants that \"next it'll be the Chi Omega variant or the Pi Kappa Psi variant. I got the Florida variant. I got the freedom variant. It affects the brain. It gets you to think for yourself where you don't just surrender to the truth that they're trying to create in corrupt big media.\"[239] Gaetz opposes abortion. On July 23, 2022, he gave a speech at a Student Action Summit gathering in Tampa, Florida, in which he said that overweight or unattractive women were unlikely to become pregnant and mocked them for supporting abortion rights, saying, \"They're like 5'2\", 350 pounds, and they're like, 'Give me my abortions or I'll get up and march and protest.'\"[240][241] Olivia Julianna, a Texas teenager, tweeted a post mocking Gaetz, who responded with a photo of her that, according to NPR, implied his comments had touched a nerve; she used the incident to raise over $2 million for abortion funds.[240][242] On December 19, 2017, Gaetz was the only representative to vote against the Combating Human Trafficking in Commercial Vehicles Act, a bill allocating additional government resources to help combat human trafficking.[243][244][245] Gaetz later explained that his vote was due to his small government principles and his belief that existing federal agencies could adequately combat human trafficking.[245][246] On February 27, 2018, Gaetz voted against the Allow States and Victims to Fight Online Sex Trafficking Act, which had by then been combined with the Stop Enabling Sex Traffickers Act. It passed, 388–25.[247] On July 26, 2022, Gaetz voted against the Frederick Douglass Trafficking Victims Prevention and Protection Reauthorization Act, which passed 401–20.[248] Gaetz opposes sanctuary cities, which limit their cooperation with the federal government in enforcing immigration law.[249] Upon announcing his run for Congress in 2016, he said that undocumented immigrants were \"sucking us dry\".[250] In January 2018, Gaetz defended a statement by Trump that reportedly said Haiti and African nations were \"shithole\" countries, saying that Haiti was covered by \"sheet metal and garbage\" and in \"disgusting\" condition.[251] In October 2018, Gaetz falsely stated that George Soros paid for a caravan of migrants from Central America to the United States.[252] Gaetz voted against the Further Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2020 which authorizes DHS to nearly double the available H-2B visas for the remainder of FY 2020.[253][254] Gaetz voted against Consolidated Appropriations Act (H.R. 1158), an act which effectively prohibits ICE from cooperating with Health and Human Services to detain or remove illegal alien sponsors of unaccompanied alien children (UACs).[255][256] Gaetz tweeted on June 23, 2021 that the FBI should be defunded. At that time, it was investigating him for alleged sex trafficking and having sex with a minor. He wrote, \"If Democrats want to defund the police, they should start with the FBI.\"[257] Gaetz later deleted the tweet.[258][259] The week before, he claimed without evidence that \"FBI operatives organized and participated in the January 6th Capitol riot.\"[257] As of 2024[update], there is still no evidence for such a claim.[260] As a Florida state representative in 2015, Gaetz and Representative David Richardson sponsored an amendment to repeal the state ban on same-sex adoptions.[261] He also persuaded his father, in the Florida State Senate, to support the repeal.[262] In 2015, after the U.S. Supreme Court decided Obergefell v. Hodges, which established the legal recognition of same-sex marriage in the United States, Gaetz said he disagreed with the court's ruling, saying that each state should have the right to decide for itself whether to allow same-sex marriage. He argued that the decision was an example of \"judicial activism\" that posed \"a threat to our democracy\".[263] During the 116th Congress, Gaetz voted against the Equality Act,[264] which would ban discrimination on the basis of sex, sexual orientation, and gender identity in federal law. In 2022, Gaetz voted against the Respect for Marriage Act,[265] which repealed the Defense of Marriage Act, which restricted legal recognition of marriage to opposite-sex marriage in federal law. In 2024, Gaetz condemned schools for promoting what he described as \"degenerate LGBT and anti-White propaganda\" as he introduced his \"National Prayer In School Act\".[266][267][268] Gaetz was one of 39 Republicans to vote for the Merger Filing Fee Modernization Act of 2022, an antitrust package that would crack down on corporations for anti-competitive behavior.[269][270] Gaetz's tenure as congressman was widely criticized and controversial, with The New York Times noting accusations of:[107] sexual misconduct and illicit drug use; sharing inappropriate images or videos on the House floor; misusing state identification records; converting campaign funds to personal use; and accepting impermissible gifts under House rules.[107] Gaetz routinely conflicted with members of Republican leadership. In October 2023, Gaetz filed a motion to vacate which led to the removal of Kevin McCarthy as speaker of the U.S. House of Representatives.[68] Former White House aide Cassidy Hutchinson wrote in her memoir that, during a trip to Camp David in 2020, Gaetz made \"repeated passes\" at her and asked her to \"escort\" him to his room. Gaetz has denied these actions.[271] In January 2020, the U.S. Secret Service reportedly received a tip that, in April 2018, Gaetz had accompanied Seminole County tax collector Joel Greenberg to a government office where Greenberg was producing fake IDs.[272] Greenberg was indicted in August 2020 on an array of charges, including sex trafficking a 17-year-old girl in 2017 and creating fake IDs to facilitate sex trafficking.[273][274] The investigation of Greenberg led federal officials to look into some of Gaetz's related activities.[272] In late 2020, the Justice Department opened its investigation of Gaetz for allegedly sex trafficking the same 17-year-old girl in 2017 and whether he had violated federal sex trafficking laws by paying her to travel with him across state lines.[273][275][276] As part of his plea bargain, Greenberg cooperated with the investigation of Gaetz and others.[277][278] Axios reported that Gaetz was \"seriously considering not seeking re-election and possibly leaving Congress early for a job at Newsmax\" on March 30, 2021.[279] The same day, The New York Times reported the Justice Department's investigation of Gaetz.[273] According to CNN, a person briefed on the matter said investigators also examined whether Gaetz used campaign money in his relationships with young women for travel and expenses and whether cash and drugs were involved.[280] By April 2, the Justice Department was examining whether Gaetz asked women to recruit others for sex.[281][282] According to the 2021 reports, federal investigators were looking into Gaetz's September 2018 trip to the Bahamas.[274] Gaetz was reportedly joined by marijuana entrepreneur and hand surgeon Jason Pirozzolo, who allegedly paid trip accommodations, traveling expenses, and escort services. Investigators were reportedly exploring whether the escorts were sexually trafficked for Gaetz and whether Gaetz accepted paid escorts in exchange for political access or legislative favors for Pirozzolo, who at the time chaired the board of the Medical Marijuana Physicians Association. Gaetz made two speeches for the organization while in Congress, and Pirozzolo gave two separate donations of $1,000 to Gaetz's campaign arm, \"Friends of Matt Gaetz\", in March 2016 and May 2017.[283] A spokeswoman for Gaetz denied the new allegations.[284] A woman on the Bahamas trip—a Capitol Hill intern who did not work in Gaetz's office but who was dating him—reportedly agreed in May 2021 to cooperate with investigators, who believe she has information about Gaetz's financial transactions on the trip.[285][286] Investigators believe that Greenberg met women through a website for sex and introduced them to Gaetz, who also had sex with them.[273] Evidence including mobile payment receipts reportedly suggesting Gaetz had illegally exchanged money for sex, such as May 2018 Venmo transaction records showing Gaetz sending $900 (with a memo referring to a woman) to Greenberg, who then relayed the money (with the memos \"tuition\" and \"school\") to three women, one of whom was 18.[287] Joseph Ellicott, an associate of both Gaetz and Greenberg, pleaded guilty in January 2022 to two charges related to this investigation and is also cooperating with authorities.[288] Gaetz had argued in a November 2020 Fox News appearance that Trump \"should pardon Michael Flynn [and] everyone from himself to his administration officials to Joe Exotic\".[289][290] In late 2020, Greenberg apparently attempted to secure a pardon from the Trump administration via a confession letter (first reported by The Daily Beast in April 2021), writing that he and Gaetz had had sex with a 17-year-old girl they believed was 19, which Greenberg learned of on September 4, 2017, and that payments had been made on behalf of Gaetz to her and other women in exchange for sex.[291] Greenberg attempted to bribe Roger Stone with a $250,000 Bitcoin payment to secure a presidential pardon, texting Stone, \"They know [Gaetz] paid me to pay the girls and that he and I both had sex with the girl who was underage.\"[291] By the end of the Trump administration, Greenberg was under indictment, investigators had been questioning some Gaetz associates, and federal agents had seized the phone of one of Gaetz's former girlfriends.[292] Gaetz's phone was also seized, and he changed his phone number in late December.[274] Denying any sexual relationships with minors, Gaetz said on March 30, 2021, that he did not plan to resign from the House.[273] That same day, he tweeted that he and his family were \"victims of an organized criminal extortion involving a former DOJ official seeking $25 million\".[273][293] This allegedly began on March 16, with a text message to his father demanding money in exchange for making sex trafficking allegations \"go away\".[294] Gaetz and his father purportedly received communications saying that the FBI had photographs of Gaetz engaged in a \"sexual orgy with underage prostitutes\". The sender demanded millions of dollars to help secure the release of U.S. federal agent Robert Levinson (who had disappeared in Iran in 2007 and had already been presumed and declared dead),[295][296] proposing that president Joe Biden would pardon Gaetz as a reward for freeing Levinson.[297][298] The sender was later identified as Florida developer Stephen Alford, who was arrested on August 31.[299][300] Gaetz said his attorneys contacted the FBI, whom he said had informed them that Gaetz was a subject, not a target, of an investigation. He also said his father agreed to wear a \"wire\" to help the FBI record the alleged extortionists.[301] Gaetz sent Axios screenshots of text messages, emails and documents outlining the alleged extortion scheme, which he asserted was being run by David McGee,[302] a former federal prosecutor who has been a private attorney since 2005[303] and has represented the Levinson family.[304] McGee's law firm called Gaetz's allegation \"completely, totally false\" and defamatory,[294] telling The Daily Beast that Gaetz was attempting to distract from the sex trafficking investigation.[305] Alford, who has previously been federally convicted of fraud and is represented by McGee, was federally indicted in August 2021 for allegedly conducting the scheme. Prosecutors alleged that Alford said he had contacts in the Justice Department who could arrange for a presidential pardon for Gaetz and directed Don Gaetz to wire the money to a trust account managed by McGee. McGee reportedly met with Don Gaetz before Alford did,[304][306] but apparently did not discuss a presidential pardon, which Alford later admitted to the FBI that he had lied about his ability to arrange.[296] Also on March 30, Tucker Carlson interviewed Gaetz on Fox News. In addition to denying the allegations about his relationship with a 17-year-old girl, Gaetz denied a previously unreported claim that he had been photographed \"with child prostitutes\", and said that the FBI had urged a friend of his (whom Carlson had supposedly met) to claim Gaetz was \"involved in some pay-for-play scheme\". He also argued that \"Providing for flights and hotel rooms for people that you're dating who are of legal age is not a crime.\"[307][308][309] House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy said he had no plans to remove Gaetz from his seats on the Judiciary and Armed Services Committees on March 31, 2021, but that he might change his mind if Gaetz \"gets indicted\"[310] or \"if it comes out to be true\".[311] CNN reported on April 1 that Gaetz had shown pictures of naked women to colleagues on the House floor. Gaetz had allegedly claimed to have slept with the women in the photos.[312] The next day, his communications director, Luke Ball, and his legislative director, Devin Murphy, resigned. Both had begun working for Gaetz when he joined Congress in 2017.[313][314][315] On April 6, The New York Times reported that in the last weeks of the Trump administration, Gaetz privately requested a blanket presidential pardon for himself and others, which was reportedly denied because it would set a bad precedent.[290] The next day, Trump publicly denied that Gaetz had asked him for a pardon.[316] On April 7, journalist Maggie Haberman revealed on CNN that Trump had reportedly wanted to defend Gaetz but was told to stand down due to the seriousness of the allegations.[152][153] Gaetz's congressional office released a statement purportedly from his female employees vouching for his character, stating they \"uniformly reject these allegations as false\" on April 8. Gaetz's new communications director, Joel Valdez, told Forbes that \"all of the office's eight female staffers signed it\", but the version of the statement that was released did not have anyone's signature or identify any specific employee.[317] That evening, Representative Adam Kinzinger tweeted that Gaetz should resign, becoming the first congressional Republican to make such a call.[318][319] The House Ethics Committee opened an investigation on April 9 into allegations that Gaetz \"may have engaged in sexual misconduct and/or illicit drug use, shared inappropriate images or videos on the House floor, misused state identification records, converted campaign funds to personal use, and/or accepted a bribe, improper gratuity, or impermissible gift\".[320] The committee deferred its investigation at the request of the Justice Department, but resumed it in June 2023.[321][322] In late April, Gaetz fundraised to run his own political ads, claiming that he was under attack by powerful interests such as \"big government, big tech, big business, big media\" that perceived him as a political threat.[323] A public relations firm hired by Gaetz issued a denial statement regarding The Daily Beast's reporting on Greenberg's correspondence implicating him and Gaetz.[291] Greenberg pleaded guilty to multiple crimes on May 17 in a plea bargain in which he would have to cooperate with prosecutors.[278] By June, the federal investigation had reportedly broadened to include obstruction of justice, relating to Gaetz's phone conversation with a witness.[324][325] Later in June, ABC News reported that the investigation had engulfed many in the Central Florida political scene and that prosecutors could decide whether to bring charges against Gaetz as early as July.[326] In August, ABC News reported that Greenberg had \"provided investigators with years of Venmo and Cash App transactions and thousands of photos and videos, as well as access to personal social media accounts\". These include September 2018 text messages between Greenberg and a woman engaging in prostitution, which indicate that a prostitute was arranged for Gaetz and that MDMA may have been proffered. A spokesperson for Gaetz said, \"not one woman has come forward to accuse Rep. Gaetz of wrongdoing\" and that Gaetz had \"addressed the debunked allegations against him\" on his new podcast, Firebrand.[327][328] According to Greenberg, he made the arrangements for Gaetz.[327] Two top Washington prosecutors—a public corruption investigator with expertise in child exploitation crimes and a leader of the public corruption unit—have worked on Gaetz's case since at least mid-2021.[329] Greenberg's sentencing hearing was originally scheduled for August 2021,[330] but due to his cooperation in related investigations, had been repeatedly delayed.[331][332] In January 2022, an ex-girlfriend of Gaetz's testified before a grand jury after being granted immunity;[333] she reportedly had information relevant to two of three criminal charges being considered for Gaetz: sex trafficking a minor and obstruction of justice.[333] (A year later, her attorney said that Justice Department prosecutors made the right decision not to charge Gaetz because \"they didn't have evidence to prove a crime\".)[334] Gaetz was also accused of violating the Mann Act, which prohibits sex trafficking across state lines.[335] Later in January 2022, Joseph Ellicott confessed that on September 4, 2017, he witnessed Greenberg telling Gaetz over the phone that the woman they had both had sex with was underage.[336][337][338] Thanks to his assistance with the prosecutors in a series of investigations, including those involving Gaetz, Greenberg was sentenced to 11 years in prison, plus 10 years of supervised release, on December 1, 2022.[339] The sentencing judge, Gregory A. Presnell, said, \"He has provided substantial cooperation to the government...more than I've seen in 22 years.\"[339] Court documents filed in September 2024 stated that, according to multiple eyewitnesses, Gaetz had attended a party in 2017 alongside a 17-year-old girl, at the home of lobbyist Chris Dorworth where people engaged in sexual activities and did drugs, including cocaine, ecstasy, and cannabis.[340][341] A September 2022 Washington Post article reported that prosecutors had recommended not to charge Gaetz in the sex trafficking investigation, telling Justice Department superiors that a conviction is unlikely in part because of credibility questions about the two central witnesses.[342] In February 2023, the DOJ communicated to the attorneys for Gaetz that they had concluded their investigation and would not be laying charges against him, effectively ending a multiyear probe including allegations of misconduct.[343] The House Ethics Committee began its probe in April 2021 into Gaetz's alleged misconduct but soon paused it while the DOJ investigated. Shortly after the February 2023 conclusion of the DOJ investigation, the House Ethics Committee reopened its probe.[344][345] Two women, both represented by attorney Joel Leppard, testified that Gaetz paid them for sex. One of those women said that in July 2017, she saw Gaetz having sex with her 17-year-old friend and that once Gaetz became aware of the girl's age, he paused the relationship until she turned 18.[346] The woman who was 17 at the time of the incident told the House Ethics Committee that she had two sexual encounters with Gaetz at the same party.[347] The DOJ had charted payments showing that, between July 2017 and January 2019, Gaetz paid both women a total of over $10,000 across 27 Venmo transactions and a check. The committee received this chart from the DOJ, but the DOJ did not turn over other information the committee requested.[348][349] The committee also contacted Gaetz's ex-girlfriend who in 2022 had received immunity and testified in the criminal investigation, though reportedly it did not expect her to cooperate in the ethics investigation voluntarily.[350] In mid-November 2024, days before the committee was scheduled to vote whether to release its report, which was nearly complete and which insiders said was \"highly critical\" of Gaetz,[351][352][353] Gaetz resigned from the House, in part due to an announcement of his nomination as United States Attorney General for Donald Trump's second term.[354] This caused the committee to lose jurisdiction to continue its probe[355] and, under the House's own rules, it cannot release the report either. (Despite this internal rule, the House has released reports on former members before.)[356] House Speaker Mike Johnson said he would \"strongly request that the Ethics Committee not issue the report\".[357] Given the Senate's role in approving Gaetz's nomination for Attorney General, several senators including Joni Ernst, John Curtis, John Cornyn, and Markwayne Mullin called on the House to allow them to review the Ethics Committee report.[358][359] Attorneys for the two women called for the report to be released publicly: John Clune (representing the woman who had been 17 at the time of the incident) and Joel Leppard (representing the witness).[356][360] The sworn testimony of the woman who said she had sex with Gaetz in 2017 when she was 17, along with corroborating eyewitness testimony to that sexual encounter, was obtained by a hacker on November 18. A lawyer on the case noticed the suspicious download. The hacker did not immediately leak the material.[361] The House Ethics Committee decided that by December 5, it would finish its report and vote on whether to release it.[362][363] Gaetz withdrew his nomination for attorney general on November 21,[364] and indicated the following day that he would not return to the House.[365] The House Ethics Committee voted to release its report in December 2024.[366] It was made public on December 23. The Ethics Committee report concluded that Gaetz had violated Florida state laws, including those prohibiting statutory rape, procurement of prostitution, and illicit drug use, but that Gaetz did not engage in sex trafficking across state lines. The committee identified at least 20 occasions on which he had paid women for sex or drugs. It found a total of over $90,000 in payments to the 17-year-old girl and 11 other women.[367][2][368][369] Gaetz was arrested for driving under the influence as he was driving back from a nightclub on Okaloosa Island, Florida, in 2008. Police recorded him driving 48 mph (77 km/h) in a 35 mph (56 km/h) zone and noted that he showed physical signs of intoxication.[370] Gaetz initially denied that he had drunk alcohol, but later admitted to drinking two beers. He failed an eye test twice, then declined field sobriety tests. After Gaetz was arrested, he refused to take a breathalyzer test.[370] Shortly after Gaetz's case was referred to state attorney Steve Meadows, Gaetz's driving license was reinstated. Though Florida law requires a year's suspension when a driver refuses a breathalyzer test, Gaetz's suspension was less than a year. His refusal also did not lead to a criminal prosecution, during which it could have been used against him. A field officer for the Florida Department of Highway Safety and Motor Vehicles declared there was no evidence that Gaetz refused a breathalyzer test, despite the arresting police officer having documented it in an affidavit and the arrest report and Gaetz's own attorney also having documented it, too. Gaetz's attorney also argued that an unnamed witness who knew Gaetz \"observed no indication of impairment\".[370] The charges against Gaetz were dismissed.[370] Gaetz has published a 2020 book and a 2021 podcast, both titled Firebrand. In both, he criticizes former House speaker Paul Ryan for joining the board of Fox News's parent company and blames him for canceling Lou Dobbs Tonight.[328][371] In the book, while discussing dating in Washington, he writes, \"I knew going in how many people had been brought down by sexual missteps in this town, so I set some rules to help me err on the safe(r) side ... [including] no dating your staff members, [etc.].\"[371] In December 2020, Gaetz announced his engagement to his girlfriend, Ginger Luckey, the sister of Oculus VR founder and major Republican donor Palmer Luckey.[372] They married in August 2021.[373] Gaetz is a Baptist.[374] On several occasions he has mentioned that he had regarded his ex-girlfriend's younger brother, Nestor Galbán, as his family.[375] Though Gaetz has referred to Galbán as his son in the past, the two are not related genetically or legally.[376][377][378]",

                "content": "Matt Gaetz, a member of the 118th Congress, is currently serving his fourth term in the U.S. House of Representatives. He is a member of the House Armed Services Committee and the House Judiciary Committee. His work in Congress focuses on national security, veterans’ affairs, and adherence to constitutional principles. From Florida to D.C., Matt has lived up to his reputation as an outspoken conservative firebrand. Matt has been a prominent voice for uncovering corruption within the Department of Justice and the Federal Bureau of Investigation during his tenure in the US House, as well as fighting to advance former President Trump’s America First agenda for the United States on the House floor, on television, directly to his constituents during “Open Gaetz Days” or town halls, and most recently in a nation-wide America First tour. During the Russia Hoax and subsequent partisan impeachment inquiry into President Donald Trump, Matt was a staunch defender of the President and a fierce advocate for his acquittal. Matt spearheaded the charge for transparency during the Democrats’ partisan impeachment depositions by leading over fifty Republican colleagues into their secretive, closed-door impeachment inquiry to observe the proceedings. Matt was a tireless defender of President Trump and his vision for the United States during the Trump Administration, and continues to defend the former president. He has earned nicknames such as the “Trumpiest Congressman in Trump’s Washington” by GQ magazine and “the Trumpiest Congressman” by Rolling Stone, which he considers badges of honor. Matt has authored key pieces of legislation on foreign policy, veterans’ health care, immigration, climate change, and more during his time in office. In 2019, Matt introduced the “Green Real Deal,” a plan to address climate change by harnessing the power of free markets, embracing technological innovation and entrepreneurship, and cutting excessive governmental red tape. In 2020, he introduced the “PANDEMIC Act,” which mandates the deportation of all illegal aliens held in the United States when a national emergency related to a communicable disease is declared, and in 2020 he authored the “Ainsworth Act,” which allows centenarian military veterans to qualify for full pension benefits from the Department of Veterans’ Affairs regardless of their net worth. Since Northwest Florida is home to strategic military installations such as Eglin AFB, Hurlburt Field, and NAS Pensacola, Matt has made it a priority to ensure the military has extraordinary capabilities to protect America. During the FY2022 National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA), Matt secured numerous provisions, including an amendment to increase the Basic Allowance for Housing (BAH) to service members in the district, and a $600 million in funding for Military Construction Projects throughout the district and enhancements to the Gulf Test Range. Matt graduated from Florida State University in Tallahassee, Florida, with a bachelor’s degree in interdisciplinary sciences. After finishing his undergraduate studies, Matt moved to Williamsburg, Virginia, to attend William & Mary Law School, where he received his Juris Doctorate. Prior to serving in Congress, Matt worked as an attorney in Northwest Florida with the Keefe, Anchors & Gordon law firm, where he advocated for a more open and transparent government. In 2010, Matt was elected to serve in the Florida House of Representatives to represent portions of Okaloosa and Santa Rosa county. He was chairman of the Finance and Tax Committee, where he authored and passed $1 billion in tax cuts, all while balancing the state budget and repealing or replacing over 4,000 regulations. Matt also served as chairman of the Criminal Justice Subcommittee, where he authored and passed some of America’s toughest penalties against violent sexual predators. Matt was born in Hollywood, Florida, to Don and Vicky Gaetz and grew up in Northwest Florida. He is a member of First Baptist Church in Fort Walton Beach, Florida. Matt is married to Ginger Gaetz and has one son, Nestor, who he has described raising as “the most rewarding thing I’ve done in my life.”",

                "content": "Matthew Louis Gaetz II[1] (/ɡeɪts/; born May 7, 1982) is an American lawyer and politician. He was the U.S. representative for Florida's 1st congressional district from 2017 to 2024. He is a member of the Republican Party. He is known as a strict Trump supporter.[2] He has been seen as a strong supporter of far-right politics as well as an ally of president-reelect Donald Trump.[3][4] In 2020, Gaetz was accused of sex trafficking and having sexual relationships with minors.[5] In October 2023, Gaetz filed a motion to vacate which led to the removal of Kevin McCarthy as Speaker of the U.S. House of Representatives.[6][7] In November 2024, President-elect Donald Trump announced he would nominate Gaetz to serve as United States attorney general.[8] Gaetz resigned from the U.S. House of Representatives shortly after his nomination.[9] However after controversy regarding sexual abuse and sex trafficking accusations, Gaetz withdrew his nomination on November 21, 2024.[10] Matthew Louis Gaetz II was born on May 7, 1982, in Hollywood, Florida, to Victoria (née Quertermous) and Don Gaetz, a politician.[11][12][13] He was raised near Fort Walton Beach.[14][15] He graduated from Florida State University in 2003 and from the William & Mary Law School in 2007.[16][17] He became a lawyer in 2008.[18] Gaetz worked at the law firm Keefe, Anchors & Gordon (now AnchorsGordon)[19] in Fort Walton Beach.[20] In October 2021, the Florida bar banned Gaetz from practicing law because of unpaid fees.[21] He was allowed to become a lawyer again after the $265 fee was paid.[22] In March 2010, Gaetz ran in the special election in the 4th district for the Florida Senate.[23] He won with 43 percent of the vote.[23] In the special general election, Gaetz beat Democratic nominee Jan Fernald with 66 percent of the vote.[24] He ran for re-election and won in 2010 (for a full term), then in 2012 and 2014.[25] Gaetz supported the death penalty during his time in the state senate.[26] Gaetz was one of two members to vote against a Florida bill making revenge porn illegal in 2015.[27] In 2015, Gaetz supported the presidential campaign of former Governor Jeb Bush.[28] In 2013, Gaetz announced that, in 2016, he would run for the 1st district Florida State Senate seat held by his father, Don Gaetz.[29] In March 2016, Gaetz decided to run for the U.S. House instead.[30] In August 2016, Gaetz won the Republican primary with 35.7 percent.[31] In the November general election, Gaetz beat Democratic nominee Steven Specht with 69 percent of the vote.[32] He was re-elected in 2018, 2020, 2022 and 2024. In January 2018, Gaetz invited alt-right Holocaust denier Charles C. Johnson to Donald Trump's State of the Union address.[33] Gaetz has gone to political rallies in 2018 and 2019 at which members of the Proud Boys were present.[34][35] On January 10, 2021, House Republican leader Kevin McCarthy argued with Gaetz on a phone call that he was unnecessarily \"putting people in jeopardy\" during the January 6 United States Capitol attack.[36] In June 2021, Gaetz was one of 21 House Republicans to vote against a resolution to give the Congressional Gold Medal to police officers who defended the U.S. Capitol on January 6.[37] Gaetz, a critic of Kevin McCarthy, voted against him for Speaker of the U.S. House, instead nominating former President Donald Trump.[38][39][40] He made it harder for McCarthy to become speaker, however changed his vote on January 7, 2023.[41] However, in October 2023, Gaetz successfully filed a resolution to remove McCarthy from his role as speaker.[42] In April 2024, McCarthy said that Gaetz wanted to remove him as speaker to protecting himself against allegations of having had sex with a 17 year old minor.[43][44][45] Gaetz resigned from the U.S. House of Representatives on November 13, 2024 after he was nominated as United States Attorney General.[9] In November 2024, President-elect Donald Trump announced he would nominate Gaetz to serve as United States attorney general during his second administration.[8] His nomination surprised many Republicans and some did not like it.[46] After his nomination, there was controversy about Gaetz paying minors for sex along with accusations of sex trafficking.[10] Gaetz withdrew his nomination on November 21, 2024.[10] In December 2020, Gaetz announced his engagement to his girlfriend, Ginger Luckey.[47] They married in August 2021.[48] Gaetz is a Baptist.[49] In 2020, Gaetz was accused of sex trafficking and having sexual relationships with minors. After an investigation, the United States Department of Justice (DOJ) decided not to charge him, although Gaetz remained under investigation of the House Ethics Committee up until his resignation.[5] In March 2021, Gaetz was being investigated for having a sexual relationship with a 17-year-old girl in 2019, and that investigators were examining whether he had violated federal sex trafficking laws by allegedly paying her to travel with him.[50][51] A few weeks later, Axios reported that Gaetz was \"seriously considering not seeking re-election and possibly leaving Congress early for a job at Newsmax\".[52] Former White House aide Cassidy Hutchinson wrote in her memoir that Gaetz harassed her many times.[53] She wrote that during a trip to Camp David in 2020 he interrupted her meeting with Kevin McCarthy, repeatedly asking her to \"escort\" him to his room. Gaetz has said that this is not true.[54]",

                "title": "Boston Celtics - Wikipedia",
                "content": "The Boston Celtics (/ˈsɛltɪks/ SEL-tiks[a]) are an American professional basketball team based in Boston. The Celtics compete in the National Basketball Association (NBA) as a member of the Atlantic Division of the Eastern Conference. Founded in 1946 as one of the league's original eight teams, the Celtics play their home games at TD Garden, a shared arena with the NHL's Boston Bruins. The Celtics are commonly regarded as the most successful team in NBA history and hold the records for most NBA championships won, with 18, and most recorded wins of any NBA franchise.[11][12] The Celtics' rise to dominance began in the late 1950s, after the team, led by coach Red Auerbach, acquired Bill Russell in 1956, later becoming the cornerstone of the Celtics dynasty. Led by Russell, Bob Cousy, and Tom Heinsohn, the Celtics won their first NBA championship in 1957. Russell, along with a talented supporting cast of future Hall of Famers including Heinsohn, Don Nelson, K. C. Jones, John Havlicek, Sam Jones, Satch Sanders, and Bill Sharman, would usher the Celtics into the greatest period in franchise history, winning eight consecutive NBA championships from 1959 to 1966. After Russell became the team's player-coach, as well as the first African American head coach in any United States sport, they won back-to-back titles in 1968 and 1969. The Celtics entered a period of rebuilding after Russell retired in 1969. In the mid-1970s, the Celtics became contenders once again, winning championships in 1974 and 1976 under the leadership of head coach Tom Heinsohn with Dave Cowens, Havlicek, and Jo Jo White. In the 1980s, the Celtics returned to dominance. Anchored by the \"Big Three\" of Larry Bird, Kevin McHale, and Robert Parish, the team experienced a renewed rivalry with the \"Showtime\" Lakers and won championships in 1981, 1984, and 1986, the latter two with head coach K. C. Jones against the Lakers. After the retirements of Bird and McHale, the departure of Parish, and the untimely deaths of 1986 draft pick Len Bias and star player Reggie Lewis, the Celtics struggled through the 1990s and much of the early 2000s. After another period of rebuilding, the Celtics assembled a new \"Big Three\" around team captain Paul Pierce by acquiring Ray Allen and Kevin Garnett in the 2007 offseason. Under the leadership of head coach Doc Rivers, the team defeated the Lakers to win their 17th championship in 2008, while also losing to the Lakers in the 2010 Finals. Allen, Garnett, and Pierce were no longer with the team by the start of the 2013–14 season, with Garnett and Pierce being traded to the Brooklyn Nets for four total future first round picks. With two of these first round picks, the team drafted Jaylen Brown and Jayson Tatum in 2016 and 2017, respectively. Led by \"The Jays\", the team returned to the NBA Finals in 2022, losing to the Golden State Warriors, and defeated the Dallas Mavericks in 2024 to secure their 18th championship. The \"Celtics\" nickname and the team's mascot \"Lucky the Leprechaun\" are nods to Boston's historically large Irish population, and also to the Original Celtics, a barnstorming basketball team that played in the early 20th century.[13] The Celtics have a notable rivalry with the Los Angeles Lakers, who are second in NBA history with 17 championships. The teams' rivalry was especially pronounced in the 1960s and 1980s. The Celtics have played the Lakers a record 12 times in the NBA Finals and have defeated them nine times. 41 members of Basketball Hall of Fame have played for the Celtics at least once in their careers. Four Celtics players (Bob Cousy, Bill Russell, Dave Cowens and Larry Bird) have won the NBA Most Valuable Player award; overall, Celtics players have won an NBA-record 10 MVP awards.[14] The Boston Celtics were formed on June 6, 1946, by Boston Garden-Arena Corporation president Walter A. Brown as a team in the Basketball Association of America. In 1948, the team earned its first playoff appearance, only to lose to the Chicago Stags 4–1. In 1949, the team missed the playoffs, fifth in the Eastern Division. Then, on August 3, 1949, the team became part of the National Basketball Association following the merger of the BAA and rival National Basketball League.[15][16] In 1950, the Celtics signed Chuck Cooper, becoming the first NBA franchise to draft a black player.[17] Chuck Connors of The Rifleman fame was an original member of the Celtics in 1946.[18] The Celtics struggled during their early years, until the hiring of coach Red Auerbach.[19] In the franchise's early days, Auerbach had no assistants, ran all the practices, did all the scouting—both of opposing teams and college draft prospects—and scheduled all road trips. One of the first great players to join the Celtics was Bob Cousy, whom Auerbach initially refused to draft out of nearby Holy Cross because he was \"too flashy\".[20] Cousy's contract eventually became the property of the Chicago Stags,[21] but when that franchise went bankrupt, Cousy went to the Celtics in a dispersal draft. After the 1955–56 season, Auerbach made a stunning trade, sending perennial All-Star Ed Macauley to the St. Louis Hawks along with the draft rights to Cliff Hagan for the second overall pick in the draft.[22] After negotiating with the Rochester Royals—a negotiation that included a promise that the Celtics owner would send the highly sought-after Ice Capades to Rochester if the Royals would let Russell slide to No. 2—Auerbach used the pick to select University of San Francisco center Bill Russell.[23] Auerbach also acquired Holy Cross standout, and 1957 NBA Rookie of the Year, Tom Heinsohn.[24] Both Russell and Heinsohn worked extraordinarily well with Cousy, and they were the players around whom Auerbach would build the champion Celtics for more than a decade.[24] With Bill Russell, the Celtics advanced to the 1957 NBA Finals and defeated the St. Louis Hawks in seven games, earning their first NBA title.[25] In 1958, the Celtics again advanced to the NBA Finals, this time losing to the Hawks in 6 games.[26] Following the acquisition of K.C. Jones in 1958, the Celtics began a dynasty that would last for more than a decade.[27] In 1959, the Celtics won the NBA championship after sweeping the Minneapolis Lakers, the first of their record eight consecutive championships.[28] During that time, the Celtics met the Lakers in the Finals five times, starting an intense and often bitter rivalry that has spanned generations. In 1964, the Celtics became the first NBA team to have an all African-American starting lineup. On December 26, 1964, Willie Naulls replaced an injured Tom Heinsohn, joining Tom 'Satch' Sanders, K.C. Jones, Sam Jones, and Bill Russell in the starting lineup. The Celtics defeated St. Louis 97–84. Boston won its next 11 games with Naulls starting in place of Heinsohn.[29] The Celtics of the late 1950s–1960s are widely considered one of the most dominant teams of all time.[30] Auerbach retired as coach after the 1965–66 season and Russell took over as player-coach, which was Auerbach's ploy to keep Russell interested.[31] With his appointment Russell became the first African-American coach in any U.S. pro sport. Auerbach would remain the general manager, a position he would hold well into the 1980s. However, the Celtics' string of NBA titles ended when they lost to the Philadelphia 76ers in the 1967 Eastern Conference Finals. The aging team managed two more championships in 1968 and 1969, defeating the Los Angeles Lakers each time.[32] Russell retired after the 1969 season, effectively ending a Celtics dynasty that had garnered an unrivaled 11 NBA titles in 13 seasons.[33] The team's run of 8 consecutive is the longest championship streak in U.S. professional sports history,[34] with Russell's 11 titles being the most won by an NBA player. The 1969–70 season was a rebuilding year, as the Celtics had their first losing record since the 1949–50 season. However, with the acquisition of Paul Silas and future Hall of Famers Dave Cowens[35] and Jo Jo White,[36] the Celtics soon became dominant again. After losing in the Eastern Conference Finals in 1972, the Celtics regrouped and came out determined in 1973 and posted an excellent 68–14 regular season record. But the season ended in disappointment, as they were upset in seven games by the New York Knicks in the Conference Finals. John Havlicek injured his right shoulder in game six and was forced to play game seven shooting left-handed.[37] The Celtics returned to the playoffs the next year, defeating the Milwaukee Bucks in the 1974 NBA Finals for their 12th NBA championship.[38] Boston took a 3–2 series lead and had a chance to claim the title on their home court. The Bucks won Game Six in Boston when Kareem Abdul-Jabbar nestled in a hook shot with 3 seconds left in the game's second overtime, and the series returned to Milwaukee. Cowens was the hero in Game 7, scoring 28 points, as the Celtics brought the title back to Boston for the first time in five years. In 1976, the team won yet another championship, defeating the Phoenix Suns in six games. The Finals featured one of the greatest games in NBA history. With the series tied at two games apiece, the Suns trailed early in the Boston Garden, but came back to force overtime. In double overtime, a Gar Heard turn-around jumper at the top of the key sent the game to a third overtime, at which point the Celtics prevailed.[39] After the 1976 championship and a playoff appearance in 1977, Boston went into another rebuilding phase. In the 1977 NBA draft, the Celtics drafted a young forward from UNC Charlotte named Cedric Maxwell.[40] \"Cornbread\" Maxwell did not contribute much in his rookie season, but he showed promise. Auerbach's job became even tougher following the 1977–78 season in which they went 32–50 as Havlicek, the Celtics' all-time leading scorer, retired after 16 seasons.[41] The Celtics owned two of the top eight picks in the 1978 NBA draft.[42] Auerbach took a risk by selecting junior Larry Bird of Indiana State with the sixth overall pick, knowing that Bird would stay in college for his senior year but believing that his potential would make him worth the wait. The team retained Bird's rights for one year and signed him soon after he led Indiana State to the NCAA championship game. In 1978, Celtics owner Irv Levin traded franchises with Buffalo Braves owner John Y. Brown Jr.[43] Two weeks before the swap of franchises was made official, details of a six-player trade between the two teams were reported. Boston sent Freeman Williams, Kevin Kunnert, and Kermit Washington to the Braves for \"Tiny\" Archibald, Billy Knight, and Marvin Barnes.[44] The move turned Boston fans against Brown, both because Kunnert and Washington were seen as key pieces of the team's future and because Auerbach publicly stated that he was not consulted about the trade.[44] The relationship between Brown and Auerbach worsened with Brown's decision to acquire Bob McAdoo in February 1979,[45] in exchange for three first-round draft picks that Auerbach had planned to use to rebuild the franchise.[46] Again, Brown made the trade without consulting Auerbach.[47] Auerbach almost left Boston to take a job with the New York Knicks as a result.[46] With public support strongly behind Auerbach, Brown sold the team to Harry Mangurian in 1979 rather than run the risk of losing his famed general manager.[48][49] The Celtics would struggle through the season, going 29–53.[50] Newcomers Chris Ford, Rick Robey, Cedric Maxwell and Nate Archibald failed to reverse the team's momentum.[51] Larry Bird debuted for the Celtics during the 1979–80 season.[52] With a new owner in place, Auerbach made a number of moves that would bring the team back to prominence. He almost immediately traded McAdoo,[53] a former NBA scoring champion, to the Detroit Pistons for guard M. L. Carr, a defensive specialist, and two first-round picks in the 1980 NBA draft.[49] He also picked up point guard Gerald Henderson from the CBA. Carr, Archibald, Henderson and Ford formed a highly competent backcourt, blending in well with the talented frontcourt of Cowens, Maxwell and Bird. With Bird winning NBA Rookie of the Year honors[54] the team went 61–21, a 32-game improvement from the previous season. Playing strong in the playoffs, the Celtics fell to the Philadelphia 76ers in the Eastern Conference Finals.[55] After the season, Auerbach completed one of the most lopsided trades in NBA history, garnering a pair of future Hall of Famers for a pair of first-round draft picks. Seeking to improve the team immediately, Auerbach sent the team's two first-round draft picks to the Golden State Warriors for both center Robert Parish[56] and the Warriors' first-round pick. He then used the pick the Celtics obtained from Golden State to select University of Minnesota power forward Kevin McHale.[57] The \"Big Three\" of Bird, McHale and Parish played together for the Celtics until 1992, won three NBA championships together,[58] and were later described as the best NBA frontcourt of all time.[59][60][61][62] Despite losing center Dave Cowens to retirement late in training camp, the Celtics went 62–20 under coach Bill Fitch in 1980–81.[63] Once again, the Celtics faced the 76ers in the Eastern Conference Finals, falling behind 3–1 before coming back to win Game Seven, 91–90. The Celtics went on to win the 1981 NBA championship over the Houston Rockets,[64] with Maxwell being named NBA Finals MVP.[65] Following the 1981–82 season, the Celtics once again met the 76ers in the playoffs. This time, they lost in seven games.[66] In 1983 the Celtics were swept in the playoffs (a first for the franchise) by the Milwaukee Bucks;[67] afterwards, Fitch resigned and the team was sold to new owners led by Don Gaston.[68] In 1983–84, the Celtics under new coach K. C. Jones would go 62–20 and return to the NBA Finals after a three-year hiatus.[69] Boston came back from a 2–1 deficit to defeat the Lakers for their 15th championship.[70] Bird renewed his college rivalry with Lakers star Magic Johnson during this series. After the season, Auerbach officially retired as general manager, but maintained the position of team president.[71] He was succeeded by Jan Volk.[71] In 1985, the Lakers and Celtics met again in the Finals, with the Lakers winning.[72] This was the first time the Lakers had defeated the Celtics in the Finals and the only time the team had won a championship at Boston Garden. During the following off-season, the Celtics acquired Bill Walton from the Los Angeles Clippers in exchange for Cedric Maxwell.[73] Walton had been an All-Star and league MVP while leading the Portland Trail Blazers to the 1977 NBA championship, but injuries had hobbled him since. Considered the best passing center in NBA history, he stayed healthy and was a big part of the Celtics' success in 1986. The Celtics won the second pick in the 1986 NBA draft and drafted University of Maryland star Len Bias, one of the most heralded prospects of his era.[74] Bias died 36 hours later of an accidental cocaine overdose.[75] Despite the tragedy, the Celtics remained competitive in 1986–87, going 59–23 and again winning the Eastern Conference Championship.[76] They were defeated in the Finals by the Lakers in six games. In 1988, the Celtics lost in six games to the Detroit Pistons in the Eastern Conference Finals.[77] Following the season, head coach K.C. Jones retired and was replaced by assistant Jimmy Rodgers. Boston's hopes for 1988–89 faded when Bird underwent a procedure to remove bone spurs in his feet early in the season, and the Celtics won just 42 games before a first-round playoff defeat to the Pistons. Bird returned in 1989–90 and led the Celtics to a 52–30 record. In the playoffs, the Celtics collapsed after winning the first two games in a best-of-five series against the New York Knicks, losing three straight games and the series. After the playoffs, Rodgers was fired and replaced by assistant coach and former Celtics player Chris Ford. Under Ford's leadership, the Celtics improved to 56–26 in 1990–91, recapturing the Atlantic Division title even though Bird missed 22 games with several injuries. The Celtics again lost to the Pistons in the playoffs. In 1992, a late-season rally allowed a 51–31 Celtics team to catch the New York Knicks and repeat as Atlantic Division champions. After sweeping the Indiana Pacers in the first round, the Celtics lost a seven-game Eastern Conference Semifinals series to the Cleveland Cavaliers. Back injuries limited Bird to only 45 regular season games, and just four of ten in the playoffs. After thirteen NBA seasons and a gold medal at the Barcelona Olympics with the Dream Team, continued back trouble led Bird to retire in 1992. The loss of Bird and the aging of the team's other veteran stars forced coach Chris Ford into rebuilding mode.[78] Hopes centered on 26-year-old Reggie Lewis, a small forward out of Boston's Northeastern University. In the first round of the 1993 playoffs Lewis fainted during Boston's four-game series loss by the Charlotte Hornets.[79] An examination revealed heart problems,[80] but Lewis was able to get doctors to clear him for a comeback. Before he could make it he died of a heart attack while shooting baskets at Brandeis University during the off-season.[81] The Celtics honored his memory by retiring his number 35.[82] With McHale having retired after the Celtics' playoff loss to the Hornets, Boston's original Big 3 era came to an end in 1994 upon Robert Parish's signing with Charlotte.[56] The team collapsed, finishing out of the playoffs with a 32–50 mark. In 1994, the Celtics hired former player and legendary towel-waving cheerleader M. L. Carr as the team's new vice president of basketball operations. Working alongside general manager Jan Volk, Carr selected University of North Carolina star Eric Montross with Boston's first-round pick in the 1994 NBA draft. Montross became the new heir apparent in the paint, but failed to develop and was eventually traded. 1994–95 was the Celtics' final season in the Boston Garden. The Celtics signed aging Dominique Wilkins as a free agent, who led the team in scoring with 17.8 PPG. Second-year player Dino Rađa, a power forward from Croatia, added an interior presence the team had been lacking in 1993–94. The Celtics made the playoffs, losing to the heavily favored Orlando Magic in four games. In 1995, the Celtics moved from the Boston Garden to the Fleet Center (later TD BankNorth, then TD Garden). Carr fired Chris Ford and took the coaching reins himself. After drafting Providence College star Eric Williams, the Celtics struggled to a 33–49 record. Things got worse in 1996–97 as the Celtics lost a franchise-record 67 games, setting an unwanted NBA record winning only once against other Atlantic Division teams and just fifteen victories overall. In spite of the emergence of 1st-round draft pick Antoine Walker, Carr resigned after the season ended, while Rick Pitino was hired to join the franchise as the team's president, director of basketball operations, and head coach, reportedly on a $70 million ten-year contract. Volk resigned on May 7, 1997.[83][84] Pitino's appointment as team president was controversial as Auerbach, the incumbent who had filled that role for more than 25 years, first heard about the change from local media. Unfortunately for the franchise, Pitino was not the savior everyone hoped he would be. Auerbach bore the insult of being elbowed out with dignity, even as the team failed to improve. The Celtics received the third and sixth draft picks in the 1997 NBA draft,[85] and used the picks to select a brand new backcourt through Chauncey Billups and Ron Mercer. The young team that lost 67 games the year before was dismantled, with David Wesley, Dino Rađa and Rick Fox being let go, and Williams traded to the Denver Nuggets for a pair of second round draft picks (Williams would return to the Celtics in 1999 and played for four years). Walter McCarty was also acquired in a trade with the Knicks. With a promising start, upsetting the defending champions Chicago Bulls at home on opening night,[86] and hard play from the youngsters that led to leaderships in turnovers and steals, the team improved its victories from 15 to 36 despite many losing streaks.[87][88] Billups was subsequently traded to the Raptors during his rookie year,[89] and Mercer was traded to the Nuggets during his third season.[90] The following year in the 1998 NBA draft, the Celtics drafted Paul Pierce,[91] a college star who had been expected to be drafted much earlier than the Celtics' 10th overall pick. Pierce had an immediate impact during the lockout-shortened 1998–99 season, averaging 19.5 points and being named Rookie of The Month in February as he led the league in steals.[92] However, the Celtics continued to struggle as Pitino failed to achieve meaningful success. After Boston lost to the Toronto Raptors on March 1, 2000, on a buzzer-beater by Vince Carter, Pitino delivered the memorable \"walking through that door\" speech, invoking Bird, McHale and Parish, which has been frequently cited over the years as a reality check for organizations wrestling with bygone glory.[93] He resigned in January 2001.[94] Following the resignation of Rick Pitino, the Celtics saw modest improvement under coach Jim O'Brien. Paul Pierce matured into an NBA star and was ably complemented by Antoine Walker and the other players acquired over the years. While the team was 12–21 when Pitino left, O'Brien's record to finish the season was 24–24.[95] Following the 2000–01 season O'Brien was given the job of head coach on a permanent basis. As a result of numerous trades, the Celtics had three picks in the 2001 NBA draft. They selected Joe Johnson, Joe Forte, and Kedrick Brown. Only Johnson managed to succeed in the NBA, becoming a perennial All-Star after leaving the Celtics. The Celtics entered the 2001–02 season with low expectations. The team's success in the latter stages of 2000–01 was largely forgotten, and critics were surprised when the team, along with the New Jersey Nets, surged to the top of the Atlantic Division ahead of the Philadelphia 76ers, who were fresh off a trip to the NBA Finals. The Celtics won a hard-fought 5-game series with the 76ers in the first round, 3–2. Pierce scored 46 points in the series-clinching game at the Fleet Center. In the Conference Semifinals, the Celtics defeated the favored Detroit Pistons 4–1. In their first trip to the Eastern Conference Finals since 1988, the Celtics jumped out to a 2–1 series lead over the Nets, after rallying from 21 points down in the fourth quarter to win Game 3, but would lose the next three games to fall 4–2.[96] In 2003, the Celtics were sold by owner Paul Gaston to Boston Basketball Partners L.L.C.,[97] led by H. Irving Grousbeck, Wycliffe Grousbeck and Steve Pagliuca. The team made it back to the playoffs but were swept by the Nets in the second round, despite bringing Game 4 to double overtime.[98] Before their elimination, the team hired former Celtics' guard Danny Ainge as general manager, moving Chris Wallace to another position in the organization. Ainge believed the team had reached its peak and promptly sent Antoine Walker to the Dallas Mavericks (along with Tony Delk).[99] In return, the Celtics received the often-injured Raef LaFrentz, Chris Mills, Jiří Welsch,[100] and a first-round pick in 2004. The Celtics made the playoffs, only to be swept in the first round by the Indiana Pacers, losing all four games.[101] The Celtics were a young team under new coach Doc Rivers during the 2004–05 season,[102] having drafted youngsters Al Jefferson, Delonte West and Tony Allen in the 2004 Draft. Yet they seemed to have a core of good young players, led by Pierce and rookie Al Jefferson, to go along with a group of able veterans. The Celtics went 45–37 and won their first Atlantic Division title since 1991–92, receiving a boost from returning star Antoine Walker in mid-season. The Pacers defeated them in the first round yet again, with the series culminating in an embarrassing 27-point loss in Game 7 at the Fleet Center. After the season Walker was traded again, this time to the Miami Heat. Despite Pierce's career season, in which he averaged career-highs in points (26.8), the Celtics missed the playoffs with a 33–49 record, owing largely to a young roster and constant roster shuffling, which saw the likes of Marcus Banks, Ricky Davis and Mark Blount traded for underachieving former first-overall pick Michael Olowokandi and former all-star Wally Szczerbiak. The Celtics continued to rebuild in the 2006 NBA draft. The Celtics selected Kentucky point guard Rajon Rondo, who was to become a key piece in the team's revival. In the second round the Celtics added center Leon Powe.[103] The 2006–07 season was a gloomy one for the franchise, starting with the death of Red Auerbach at 89. Auerbach was one of the few remaining people who had been a part of the NBA since its inception in 1946.[104] The Celtics went 2–22 from late December 2006 through early February 2007 after losing Pierce to injury, the result of a stress reaction in his left foot. At first, the Celtics received a much-needed boost from guard Tony Allen but he tore his ACL and MCL on a needless dunk attempt after the whistle.[105] The Celtics compiled a record of 24–58, second-worst in the NBA, including a franchise-record 18-game losing streak.[106] At the end of the season, the Celtics, with the second-worst record in the NBA, were at least hopeful that they could secure a high draft pick and select either Greg Oden or Kevin Durant to help rebuild the franchise, but the Celtics fell to fifth in the Draft Lottery. In the summer of 2007, general manager Danny Ainge made a series of moves that returned the Celtics to prominence. On draft night, he traded No. 5 pick Jeff Green, Wally Szczerbiak and Delonte West to Seattle for perennial All-Star Ray Allen and Seattle's second-round pick, which the team used to select LSU's Glen \"Big Baby\" Davis.[107] The Celtics then traded Ryan Gomes, Gerald Green, Al Jefferson, Theo Ratliff, Sebastian Telfair, and a first-round draft pick to the Timberwolves in exchange for superstar power forward Kevin Garnett.[108] These moves created a new \"Big Three\" of Pierce, Allen, and Garnett. In the 2007–08 season, Celtics completed the largest single-season turnaround in NBA history. The team went 66–16 in the regular season, a 42-game improvement over its 2006–07 record. However, the team struggled in the early rounds of the playoffs, needing seven games to defeat the Atlanta Hawks in the first round and another seven to defeat the Cleveland Cavaliers in the conference semifinals. The Celtics then beat the Detroit Pistons in six games in the Eastern Conference Finals, winning two road games.[109] For the 11th time in league history, and for the first time since 1987, the Celtics and the Lakers faced off in the NBA Finals. The Celtics won Game One at home 98–88, fueled by strong play by Garnett and Pierce's dramatic comeback from a second-half knee injury. They won Game Two 108–102 despite nearly blowing a 24-point lead in the fourth quarter. As the series shifted to Los Angeles, the Lakers stifled Pierce and Garnett in Game Three and won 87–81. However, the Celtics would overcome a 24-point deficit in Game 4 to win 97–91, making the largest in-game comeback in NBA Finals history. After again blowing a large lead, the Lakers hung on to win Game 5 103–98, sending the series back to Boston. In Game 6, the Celtics overpowered the Lakers, winning 131–92 and clinching their 17th NBA title. Paul Pierce was named Finals MVP.[110] With the win the Celtics set a record for most games a team had ever played in a postseason with 26.[111] The 2008–09 Celtics started off the season at 27–2, the then-best starting record in NBA history.[112] They also had a franchise-record 19-game streak.[113] After the All-Star Break, Kevin Garnett was injured in a loss against the Utah Jazz and missed the last 25 games of the season. Garnett was eventually shelved for the playoffs. The 2009 Celtics still finished with 62 victories, but their playoff run would end against the Magic in the second round.[114] In 2009, with the return of Garnett from injury and the additions of Rasheed Wallace and Marquis Daniels, the Celtics started the season 23–5 and at one point had the best record in the NBA. However, Doc Rivers decided to lessen his aging stars' minutes to keep them fresh for the playoffs. As a result, the Celtics sputtered to an even 27–27 record the rest of the way and finished the 2009–10 regular season with a 50–32 record.[115] Despite being the fourth seed in the Eastern Conference, the Celtics managed to make the NBA Finals. Rajon Rondo emerged as a star during postseason play.[116] For the 12th time, the Celtics faced the Lakers in the Finals. After taking a 3–2 lead heading into Los Angeles for Game Six, the Celtics appeared poised to win their 18th title. However, starting center Kendrick Perkins suffered a severe knee injury early in Game Six,[117] and the Celtics went on to lose the series in seven games. During the 2010 off-season, with Perkins expected to be out until February 2011, the Celtics signed two former All-Star centers, Shaquille O'Neal and Jermaine O'Neal. Shaquille O'Neal's presence wound up leading to Perkins' departure: the Celtics were 33–10 in games Perkins had missed during the year due to injury[118] and had a 19–3 record in games when O'Neal played over 20 minutes.[119] Consequently, Perkins was traded to the Oklahoma City Thunder in February, when the Celtics were 41–14 and led the Eastern Conference despite another rash of injuries. Following the trade, however, they proceeded to win only 15 of their final 27 games. They finished with a 56–26 record, sliding to the third seed.[118][120] The 2010–11 season still provided three landmarks: The Celtics became the second team to reach 3,000 victories, Paul Pierce became the third Celtic to score 20,000 points (the others are Larry Bird and John Havlicek), and Ray Allen broke the NBA record for most career three-pointers. The 2011 NBA playoffs started with the Celtics sweeping the New York Knicks 4–0 in the opening round. In the second round, they were ousted by eventual Eastern Conference champions Miami Heat in five games. Shaquille O'Neal, limited to 12 minutes in two games of the second round, retired at the end of the season.[121] The Celtics started the lockout-shortened season 0–3, as Pierce was out with a heel injury. At the All-Star break, the Celtics were below .500 with a 15–17 record. However, they were one of the hottest teams in the league after the break, going 24–10 the rest of the year and winning their fifth division title in a row. The Celtics made the playoffs as the fourth seed in the Eastern Conference. In the playoffs, the Celtics faced the Atlanta Hawks in the first round, beating them in six games led by strong play from Pierce and Garnett. In the conference semifinals, the Celtics defeated the 76ers in seven games. The Celtics faced the Miami Heat in the Eastern Conference Finals, losing in seven games to the eventual NBA champions. The 2012 off-season started with the Celtics having only six players under contract. While Kevin Garnett was signed to a new contract, Ray Allen signed with the Miami Heat for less money than the Celtics offered; this move brought the five-year \"Big Three\" era to a somewhat acrimonious end. The Celtics finished the season with 41 wins.[122] The Celtics trailed the New York Knicks 3–0 in the first round of the 2013 NBA playoffs before losing the series in six games. In Game Six, the Celtics nearly completed a comeback when they went on a 20–0 run to cut the lead to four.[123] During the off-season, head coach Doc Rivers was allowed to terminate his contract. He departed the Celtics to coach the Los Angeles Clippers, and the Celtics received a 2015 unprotected first-round pick as compensation. A few days later, Pierce, Garnett (who waived a no-trade clause), Jason Terry, and D. J. White, were traded to the Brooklyn Nets for Keith Bogans, MarShon Brooks, Kris Humphries, Kris Joseph, Gerald Wallace, and three future first-round draft picks (2014, 2016, 2018), together with the right to swap 2017 first-round picks with Brooklyn.[124] The deal marked the start of a youth movement for the team.[125] On July 3, 2013, the Celtics announced that Brad Stevens, the head coach of Butler University, would replace Doc Rivers as head coach.[126] Halfway through the season, in January, Rajon Rondo made his return and was named the 15th Team Captain in team history, and the team furthered the youth movement by acquiring two draft picks in a three-team trade that sent Jordan Crawford and MarShon Brooks to the Golden State Warriors while the Celtics received the Heat center Joel Anthony. The 2013–14 season marked the Celtics' first missed playoffs since the \"Big Three\".[127] The next off-season, the Celtics drafted Marcus Smart with the 6th overall pick and James Young with the 17th overall pick in the 2014 NBA draft,[128] and signed Evan Turner. The 2014–15 season had several roster moves, the most prominent being Rondo and rookie Dwight Powell traded to the Dallas Mavericks for center Brandan Wright, forward Jae Crowder, veteran point guard Jameer Nelson, and future picks.[129] A total of 22 players spent time with the Celtics,[130] leading scorer and rebounder Sullinger suffered a season-ending left metatarsal stress fracture,[131] and the team was only tenth in the East with 28 games remaining.[132] However, midseason acquisition Isaiah Thomas helped the team win 22 of their last 34 games, finishing the season with a 40–42 record, enough for the seventh seed in the Eastern Conference Playoffs.[133] The Celtics were swept by the second seeded Cleveland Cavaliers in the first round. In the 2015 NBA draft Boston selected Terry Rozier, R.J. Hunter, Jordan Mickey, and Marcus Thornton with the 16th, 28th, 33rd, and 45th selections respectively. During the off-season, the Celtics signed forward Amir Johnson and traded Gerald Wallace and Chris Babb in exchange for Warriors forward David Lee. The Celtics finished the 2015–16 NBA season with a 48–34 record, earning the fifth seed in the Eastern Conference. They played the fourth seed Atlanta Hawks in the first round of the playoffs. After leading by 3 points in the fourth quarter of Game 1, guard Avery Bradley went down with a hamstring injury, making him sit out for the rest of the series. The Celtics lost the series 4–2 to the Hawks, ending their season. In the 2016 NBA draft, the Celtics selected Jaylen Brown with the third pick. On July 8, 2016, the team signed four-time All-Star Al Horford.[134] The Celtics finished the 2016–17 season with a 53–29 record and clinched the top seed in the Eastern Conference.[135] After a hip injury ended Thomas' playoff run in game 2 of the Eastern Conference Finals,[136] the Celtics eventually lost to the Cavaliers in five games. Isaiah Thomas was selected for his second straight All-Star game and first All-NBA selection, finishing third in the league in scoring and fifth in MVP voting. For the 2017 NBA draft, the Celtics won the draft lottery, earning them the first pick.[b] They were projected to select freshman guard Markelle Fultz, but the pick was subsequently traded to the Philadelphia 76ers in exchange for the third pick in the 2017 draft and future picks.[137] The 76ers would go on to draft Fultz, while the Celtics used the third pick to select freshman forward Jayson Tatum. During the off-season, the team signed Gordon Hayward.[138] On August 22, 2017, the Celtics agreed to a deal that sent Isaiah Thomas, Jae Crowder, Ante Žižić, and the Brooklyn Nets' 2018 first-round draft pick to the Cleveland Cavaliers in exchange for Kyrie Irving.[139] By the end of the off-season, only four Celtics' players remained from the 2016–17 team,[140] with Marcus Smart being the longest-tenured Celtic from the 2014 NBA draft. On the team's opening night game in the first quarter against the Cavaliers, Hayward suffered a fractured tibia and dislocated ankle in his left leg,[141] causing him to be ruled out for the rest of the regular season.[142] Despite the loss, the Celtics went on a 16-game winning streak, which also went down as the fourth-longest winning streak in the teams' history.[143] The Celtics finished the year with a 55–27 record, good enough for second place in the Eastern Conference. In the playoffs, they defeated the Milwaukee Bucks in the first round in seven games, and continued the feat in the Conference Semifinals by defeating the Philadelphia 76ers in five games before losing to the Cleveland Cavaliers in seven games in the Conference Finals. The Celtics finished the 2018–19 season with a 49–33 record. Analysts started questioning the team's performance and chances for the championship when the Celtics had a 10–10 record after the first 20 games on November 24, 2018.[144] The Celtics then won the next eight games improving their record to 18–10.[145] During the eight-game win streak, the Celtics defeated the Cleveland Cavaliers 128–95, the New York Knicks 128–100, and also defeated the Chicago Bulls by 56 points (133–77), setting a record for the largest margin in a victory in franchise history, while also tying the record for largest victory margin by an away team.[146] The Celtics finished the regular season in fourth place in the Eastern Conference. During an April 7 game, Marcus Smart injured his hip and was ruled out for the rest of the regular season and the first round of the playoffs.[147] In the 2019 playoffs, the Celtics swept the Indiana Pacers in the first round, and then lost to the Milwaukee Bucks in five games.[148] [149] The Celtics held four picks in the 2019 NBA draft. Following a series of transactions, the team landed Romeo Langford with the 14th pick and also added Grant Williams, Carsen Edwards, and Tremont Waters (2020 G-league Rookie of the year).[150] During the 2019 off-season, Irving and Horford signed with the Brooklyn Nets and Philadelphia 76ers, respectively. Irving left, despite promising to stay in Boston.[151] On June 30, 2019, the Celtics and point guard Kemba Walker agreed to a four-year maximum contract worth $141 million. On July 6, 2019, the Celtics officially acquired Walker in a sign and trade with the Charlotte Hornets; the Celtics sent guard Terry Rozier and a protected 2020 second-round draft pick to Charlotte in exchange for Walker and a 2020 second-round draft pick.[152] On July 1, 2019, the Celtics agreed to a two-year contract with center Enes Kanter.[153] Following the suspension of the 2019–20 NBA season, the Celtics were one of the 22 teams invited to the NBA Bubble to participate in the final 8 games of the regular season.[154] In the 2020 playoffs, the Celtics swept the Philadelphia 76ers in the first round, beat the Toronto Raptors in a seven-game series, and fell to the Miami Heat in the Eastern Conference Finals in six games.[155] Boston struggled with injuries in the 2020–21 season, with Walker, Tatum and Brown all missing games at different points in the season due to injury and COVID-19. Boston could not automatically qualify for the playoffs and were sent to the play-in tournament, where they defeated the Washington Wizards 119–100. In the playoffs, they lost to the Brooklyn Nets in five games.[156] On June 2, 2021, the Celtics named head coach Brad Stevens as president of basketball operations replacing Danny Ainge after he announced his retirement.[157] On June 18, Stevens made his first transaction in his new position trading away Kemba Walker, the 16th pick in the 2021 NBA draft, and a 2025 second-round pick in exchange for former Celtic Horford, Moses Brown, and a 2023 second-round pick.[158] On June 23, 2021, it was reported that Stevens had made the decision to hire Ime Udoka as his own replacement as head coach of the Celtics.[159][160] Tatum made his third All-Star appearance off the bench at the 2022 NBA All-Star Game in Cleveland. In April 2022, the Celtics qualified for the 2022 NBA playoffs as the second seed in the Eastern Conference, having a 51–31 record; they swept the Brooklyn Nets in the first round of the postseason.[161] They next faced the Milwaukee Bucks in the Eastern Conference Semifinals and the Miami Heat in the Eastern Conference Finals, defeating both teams in seven-game series, earning the Celtics their first Finals appearance since 2010. The Celtics took a 2–1 series lead, but lost the next three games to lose to the Golden State Warriors 4–2.[162] In September, the Celtics suspended Udoka for the whole 2022–23 season for engaging in an improper intimate relationship with a female staffer.[163] Assistant coach Joe Mazzulla replaced Udoka as the interim head coach.[164] On February 16, 2023, Mazzulla was named the team's permanent head coach after leading the Celtics to a league-best 42–17 record at the NBA All-Star break.[165] After overcoming a 3–2 deficit against the Philadelphia 76ers to advance to the Eastern Conference Finals, the Celtics fell behind 3–0 in a rematch against the Heat. They battled their way back to Game 7 thanks to a Derrick White buzzer-beater in Game 6, but the Heat ultimately prevented the first 3–0 comeback in NBA history with a decisive win in Boston. During the 2023 off-season, the Celtics acquired Kristaps Porziņģis from the Wizards. In the trade, they sent Marcus Smart to the Memphis Grizzlies in a three-team deal,[166] and also traded Grant Williams to the Dallas Mavericks.[167] On October 1, 2023, the Celtics acquired Jrue Holiday in exchange for Malcolm Brogdon, Robert Williams III and two draft picks.[168] On February 7, 2024, before the trade deadline, the Celtics acquired Xavier Tillman from the Grizzlies.[169] The Celtics finished the 2023–24 regular season with the best record in the NBA, securing a 64–18 record.[170] After the regular season's close, the Celtics entered the 2024 NBA playoffs, defeating the Miami Heat in the first round, moving on to defeat the Cleveland Cavaliers in the East Semifinals, and moving on again to defeat the Indiana Pacers in the Eastern Conference Finals.[171][172][173] The Celtics' victory in the Eastern Conference Finals on May 27, 2024, was accompanied by the announcement that Jaylen Brown had been selected as the NBA Eastern Conference Finals MVP, and Brown was presented with the Larry Bird trophy, the first of his career.[174][175] The Celtics would go on to defeat the Dallas Mavericks in five games to win the NBA Finals, their record-setting 18th championship and breaking the tie with the Lakers (who have 17).[176] The rivalry between the Boston Celtics and Los Angeles Lakers involves the two most storied franchises in NBA history. It has been called the NBA's best rivalry.[177] The two teams have met a record twelve times in the NBA Finals, starting with their first Finals meeting in 1959. They would go on to dominate the league in the 1960s and the 1980s, facing each other six times in the 1960s, three times in the 1980s, in 2008, and in 2010. The Celtics have won the first eight finals meetings, while the Lakers won three of last four. The rivalry had been less intense since the retirements of Magic Johnson and Larry Bird in the early 1990s, but in 2008 it was renewed as the Celtics and Lakers met in the Finals for the first time since 1987, with the Celtics winning the series in six games. They faced off once again in the 2010 NBA Finals which the Lakers won in seven games. The two teams are first and second for the highest number of championships, with the Celtics leading the Lakers, 18 titles to 17; together, their 35 championships account for almost half of the 78 championships in NBA history. The Celtics–Hawks rivalry is a rivalry in the Eastern Conference of the National Basketball Association that has lasted for over five decades, although the two teams have played each other since the 1949–50 season, when the then-Tri-Cities Blackhawks joined the NBA as part of the National Basketball League and the Basketball Association of America merger. However, the Blackhawks could not field a truly competitive team until they moved to St. Louis as the St. Louis Hawks after a four-year stopover at Milwaukee. The two teams have faced each other eleven times in the NBA Playoffs, four times in the NBA Finals, with the Celtics winning ten of twelve series against the Hawks, including three out of four NBA Finals.[178] While the Hawks have only defeated the Celtics twice out of eleven series in the NBA Playoffs, they still often managed to make their series with the Celtics memorable. The rivalry intensified in 2016 with Hawks All-Star Center Al Horford spurning the team and joining the Celtics. The Boston Celtics were once rivals of the New Jersey Nets during the early 2000s due to their respective locations and their burgeoning stars. The Nets were led by Jason Kidd and Kenyon Martin, while the Celtics were experiencing newfound success behind Paul Pierce and Antoine Walker. The rivalry began to heat up in the 2002 Eastern Conference Finals, which was preceded by trash-talking from the Celtics[179] who claimed Martin was a \"fake\" tough guy. Things progressed as the series started, and on-court tensions seemed to spill into the stands. Celtics' fans berated Kidd and his family with chants of \"Wife Beater!\"[180] in response to Kidd's 2001 domestic abuse charge. When asked about the fan barbs being traded, Kenyon Martin stated, \"Our fans hate them, their fans hate us.\" Bill Walton said at the time that Nets-Celtics was the \"beginning of the next great NBA rivalry\" during the Eastern Conference Finals in 2002 with the Nets advancing to the NBA Finals, though New Jersey would go on to sweep Boston in the 2003 playoffs. In 2012, the year the Nets returned to New York in the borough of Brooklyn, there were indications that the rivalry might be rekindled when an altercation occurred on the court on November 28, resulting in the ejection of Rajon Rondo, Gerald Wallace, and Kris Humphries. Rondo was suspended for two games in the aftermath, while Wallace and Kevin Garnett were fined.[181] The story was revisited on December 25, when Wallace grabbed Garnett's shorts and the two had to be broken up by referees and players alike. However, the rivalry between the Nets and the Celtics appeared significantly cooled off by the June 2013 blockbuster trade that dealt Celtics stars Garnett and Paul Pierce to the Nets in exchange for Wallace, Humphries, and others. This move was billed as a merger of the two Atlantic Division teams.[182] The rivalry between the Celtics and the Detroit Pistons peaked in the 1980s, featuring players such as Larry Bird, Kevin McHale, Robert Parish, Isiah Thomas, Bill Laimbeer, Dennis Rodman, and Joe Dumars. These teams met in the NBA playoffs five times in 7 seasons from 1985 to 1991, with the Celtics winning in 1985 and 1987, and the Pistons coming out on top en route to back-to-back Finals appearances in 1988 and their championship seasons of 1989 and 1990. Led by Paul Pierce, Kevin Garnett and Ray Allen in the 2008 Eastern Conference Finals the Celtics defeated the Pistons in 6 games to advance to the NBA Finals where they went on to beat the Lakers also in 6 games.[183] The rivalry between the Celtics and the New York Knicks stems from the location of the teams, both of which are in the NBA's Atlantic division. It is one of many rivalries between Boston and New York teams, most notably the New York Yankees and the Boston Red Sox in Major League Baseball. Boston and New York are also the only two original NBA franchises that have remained in the same city for the duration of their existence. The teams have played 512 games against each other during the regular season, with the Celtics winning 276 times. The two teams have also faced each other 61 times during the playoffs, with the Celtics winning 34 times.[184] The Celtics and the Philadelphia 76ers are the two teams who have the most meetings in the NBA playoffs, playing each other in 22 series, of which the Celtics have won 15.[185] The 76ers are considered the Celtics' biggest rival in the Eastern Conference. The rivalry reached its peak when players Bill Russell and Wilt Chamberlain of the 76ers played each other from 1965 to 1968. Their play would result in the Celtics not winning every NBA Finals series in the 1960s when the 76ers won in 1967.[186] One of the most recent and unexpected rivalries that has been created between the Celtics is with the Washington Wizards. Although both teams had engaged in a fight in 1984,[187] the rivalry intensified during the 2015–16 season in a January regular season game after Jae Crowder was given a technical foul. Crowder then began to exchange words with then Wizards coach Randy Wittman. It began to escalate that off-season when the Celtics were trying to sign Al Horford. It was publicly reported that Jae Crowder emphasized that the Celtics beat the Wizards in all of their meetings that season and should sign with them rather than Washington. In their first meeting of the 2016–17 season, Wall hit Marcus Smart in the back-court when they were up by 20 late in the 4th quarter. Wall was hit with a Flagrant 2 foul and was promptly ejected. Smart immediately got back up and began to scuffle with Wall. Their words continued even after being separated with Wall telling Smart to meet him out back after the game. No incident was reported between the two following the game. In their next meeting, the Celtics won 117–108. However, after the game Wall and Crowder exchanged words in front of the Wizards bench. Crowder ended up trying to jab his finger at Wall's nose and Wall tried to fight back with a slap. Teammates and coaches from both sides had to step in and separate the two teams but the players continued to yell while entering their respective locker rooms. Police officers had to be on guard between the two locker rooms to ensure no further confrontation. Otto Porter is quoted as calling the Celtics as dirty. Isaiah Thomas replied \"If playing hard is dirty, then I guess we are a dirty team.\"[188] In their next game in January, the Wizards wore all black to enter the game. The notion was that it is similar to the attire of a funeral. Their decision worked as they defeated the Celtics 123–108. The two teams would go on to meet in the Conference Semifinals in the 2017 Playoffs. In Game 1, Markieff Morris landed on Horford's ankle after shooting a jumpshot. Morris sprained his ankle and had to miss the rest of the game which was a 123–111 loss. Morris believed that Horford did this intentionally. In Game 2, Morris retaliated by grabbing Horford by the waist and pushed him into the seats.[189] In Game 3, Kelly Olynyk set a hard screen on Kelly Oubre. Olynyk's shoulder hit Oubre in the chin causing him to drop to the floor. Oubre angrily rose and pushed Olynyk down onto the floor. Oubre was then assessed a flagrant 2 foul and was ejected while also being suspended for Game 4.[190] No significant altercations erupted in the rest of the seven-game series in which the Celtics would go on to win. The rivalry has since dissipated as the Celtics have retooled their roster but their match-ups are still seen as significant as they played on Christmas in 2017. The Boston Celtics and the Miami Heat developed an intense rivalry during the 2010s. The two teams were highlighted by their star trios in Boston's Ray Allen, Kevin Garnett and Paul Pierce whereas Miami had LeBron James, Dwyane Wade and Chris Bosh. They first met in the 2010 NBA Playoffs where Boston won the series in 5 games. They would then meet the following year where Miami would end up winning in 5 games. The teams would meet for the third straight year in the 2012 Eastern Conference Finals. Despite Boston holding a 3–2 lead, Miami would win the next 2 games to advance to the NBA Finals where they defeated the Oklahoma City Thunder. In the 2020 NBA Bubble, the Miami Heat and Boston Celtics met in the 2020 Eastern Conference Finals where Miami won in 6 games and advanced to the NBA Finals where they were prevented Boston from meeting their longtime rival Los Angeles Lakers. Unfortunately, Miami lost in 6 games to the Los Angeles Lakers. They would meet in the 2022 Eastern Conference Finals where Boston finally beat the Miami Heat in 7 games. It was their first win against Miami since 2010. In the following year, the two met in the 2023 Eastern Conference Finals. Despite Miami taking a commanding a 3–0 lead, Boston won the next three games to send the series to 7 games. However, Miami won to avoid earning the distinction of blowing a 3–0 lead. They then met in the 2024 first round where Boston beat Miami in 5 games. List of the last five seasons completed by the Celtics. For the full season-by-season history, see List of Boston Celtics seasons. Note: GP = Games played, W = Wins, L = Losses, W–L% = Winning percentage The Celtics have won an NBA-record 18 championships.[191] Forty-eight members of the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame are connected to the Celtics,[192] and the franchise has retired 23 jersey numbers, more than any other American sports team.[193] As of December 2023, the Celtics have won more NBA regular season games than any other team.[194] 37 people were inducted in the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame as players, 6 – as coaches, 6 – as contributors.[195] Additionally, Johnny Most and Mike Gorman were honored with the Hall of Fame's Curt Gowdy Media Award. Most was awarded in 1993 for his 37-year career as the Celtics radio announcer, while Gorman was awarded in 2021 for his 40-year career as the Celtics television announcer. Notes: FIBA, the body which governs international basketball, has selected two players associated with the Celtics to the FIBA Hall of Fame for contributions to international basketball. Roster Last transaction: December 26, 2024 The Celtics hold the draft rights to the following unsigned draft picks who have been playing outside the NBA. A drafted player is ostensibly either an international draftee or a college draftee who is not signed by the team that drafted him, is allowed to sign with any non-NBA teams. In this case, the team retains the player's draft rights in the NBA until one year after the player's contract with the non-NBA team ends.[196] This list includes draft rights that were acquired from trades with other teams. Bold denotes still active with the team. Italic denotes still active but not with the team. Points scored (regular season) (as of the end of the 2023–24 season)[217] Other statistics (regular season) (as of the end of the 2023–24 season)[217] There have been 18 head coaches in Celtics' history. Red Auerbach is the most successful franchise's head coach having won 9 NBA championships with the team. Celtics' legend Bill Russell took coaching duties from Auerbach and led them to 2 NBA championships while playing and coaching at the same time. The other two coaches that won 2 NBA titles with the team are Tom Heinsohn and K. C. Jones. Bill Fitch and Doc Rivers led the Celtics to 1 NBA championship apiece, as has current head coach Joe Mazzulla.[218] The Boston Celtics logo features a leprechaun spinning a basketball, named Lucky, originally depicted with a large basketball for a background. It was originally designed by Zang Auerbach, the brother of Celtics head coach Red Auerbach.[219] Through the 1995–96 season, the logo's only colors were green, white and black.[220] Then for the 1996–97 season, celebrating the club's 50th anniversary, the logo got a full-color treatment. Lucky's face and hands were both painted tan, while gold was included on the vest, bow tie and hat, as well as brown on the ball and shillelagh, and black on its pants and shoes.[221] The Celtics also have various alternative logos, with the most popular being a white shamrock with the letters \"Celtics\" above it, wrapped in a green circle, which has been used since the 1998–99 season. The alternate logo is based on logos used by the Celtics before they used the Zang Auerbach leprechaun. For much of its history, the shamrock was trimmed in gold, as seen in the old team warmup jackets. A new secondary logo, unveiled in 2014, featured a variation of the leprechaun logo, in silhouette form.[5][222] For much of their history, the Celtics wore green uniforms on the road and white uniforms at home. The basic template of the current Celtics' uniforms was formalized in the team's early years, and along the way they made a few adjustments in the lettering and stripes.[223] Among the more notable changes in the uniforms were the switch from serifed to sans-serif block lettering in 1968, the addition of names in 1972, and the incorporation of the three-leaf shamrock logo in 1998. While the white uniforms remained largely intact, the green uniforms have featured either the city name (1950s–1965; 2014–present) or the team name (1965–2014).[224] When Nike became the NBA's uniform provider in 2017, they decided to eliminate the \"home\" and \"away\" uniform designations. Thus the white Celtics uniforms became known as the \"Association\" uniforms while the green uniforms became the \"Icon\" uniforms. Both sets are now used regardless of home and road games.[4] In January 2017, the Celtics signed a multi-year deal with General Electric where they became the \"exclusive Data and Analytics partner\" for the team. As part of the deal, GE agreed to pay the Celtics more than $7 million per year[225] to have the uniforms with a GE logo prominently placed on the left shoulder of jerseys in green and white. This was the first time a corporate logo were placed on the game uniforms.[226][227] Along with the GE logo, the Nike logo now emblazons the right shoulder of the Celtics' uniforms. In November 2020, the Celtics signed a multi-year deal with Vistaprint who became the main jersey sponsor of the team.[228] In July 2024, Amica Mutual Insurance signed on as the team's jersey sponsor.[7] From 2005 to 2017, the Celtics wore alternate green uniforms with black lettering and trim featuring the word \"Boston\" on the front side. One noticeable difference in the alternate uniforms was the black panels with a green shamrock, reminiscent of the original Celtics uniforms worn in the late 1940s.[229] A gray uniform set was also used from 2014 to 2017. Dubbed \"Parquet Pride\", the uniforms featured sleeves (a prominent figure in Adidas' NBA uniforms), white letters with green trim, the silhouetted leprechaun logo on the shorts, the shamrock logo on the left leg, and a parquet-like pattern on the sides.[230] For 2017 and beyond, the Celtics will wear black \"Statement\" uniforms (labeled by Nike in reference to the league's third jerseys). The uniform features a black base with \"Celtics\" in green lettering and white trim, and other than a few changes in the striping scheme, the uniform remained essentially the same. Starting in 2020, the \"Statement\" uniform would feature the Air Jordan brand logo, a feature previously exclusive to the Charlotte Hornets uniforms.[231] Between 2006 and 2017, the Celtics wore special St. Patrick's Day uniforms. The initial uniforms were worn from 2006 to 2013 and it strongly resembled their regular green uniforms save for gold and white trim and the city name in front.[232] For 2014 and 2015, the uniforms were sleeved, replaced the city name in front in favor of the team name, and now resembled their green/black alternates.[233] In 2016 and 2017, the uniforms were again sleeveless and featured the city name in front, but kept the previous striping. During the NBA Europe Live Tour prior to the 2007–08 season, the Celtics used the alternate road jerseys in their game against the Toronto Raptors in Rome, except that the words \"Boston\" on the front side of the jersey and the shamrock on the shorts and on the reverse side of the jersey contained the green, white and red tricolors of the Italian flag. In the second game in London, the regular road jerseys featured a patch containing the Union Jack. At the 2008–09 season opener against the Cleveland Cavaliers, the Celtics wore a modified version of their home uniforms, accented with gold, to commemorate last season's championship team. The Celtics have also worn special edition Christmas Day uniforms since the 2008–09 season. For the first four games, they wore their regular green uniforms modified with the NBA logo inside a snowflake. Then in the 2012–13 season, they wore monochrome uniforms with green lettering trimmed in white. For the 2016–17 season, the Celtics wore a special green uniform with a more ornate script lettering, but without the additional striping. Starting with the 2017–18 season, the Celtics wore special edition \"City\" uniforms designed by Nike. Their first \"City\" uniforms were in gray and featured a pattern of the parquet floor throughout, a green shamrock with white trim on the left leg, green letters with white trim, Red Auerbach's signature near the uniform tag, and a portion of the 2008 championship banner on the beltline.[234] For the 2018–19 season, the Celtics wore white \"City\" uniforms with green letters and shamrocks trimmed in gold. It also has Red Auerbach's signature near the uniform tag and a gold-trimmed alternate Celtics logo on the beltline.[235][236] In addition, the Celtics wore an \"Earned\" edition uniform exclusive only to the 16 teams that made the 2018 NBA playoffs. Their rendition is a palette swap of the \"City\" uniforms with a green base and gold letters and shamrocks with white trim. Both uniforms were inspired by the team's warmup jackets they wore from the 1950s until 1998, which contained a brighter gold trim.[237] The Celtics' \"City\" uniform for the 2019–20 season featured a green base and a stylized \"Boston\" wordmark and numbers in gold with black trim. A Celtic knot in the shape of a shamrock adorn the beltline.[238] The 2020–21 Celtics' \"City\" uniform was patterned after the 17 championship banners that adorn the TD Garden rafters. The uniform, which is white with thick green stripes, features the full name in Futura Condensed stacked in front, and Red Auerbach's signature and quote \"The Boston Celtics are not a basketball team. They're a way of life.\" appears above the manufacturer's tag.[239] The Celtics also released a second \"Earned\" uniform after qualifying in the 2020 NBA playoffs; this design features a dark green base with Celtic and lime green striping, and the letters were rendered in Celtic green with white trim.[240] The Celtics' green \"City\" uniform for the 2021–22 season was a mix of previous uniform designs. The neck and arm striping was taken from their current uniforms. The green lettering with white drop shadows was a nod to the 1949 uniform design. The gray triangles on the shorts represented the franchise's initial uniforms; the left side contained the team's 75th anniversary emblem, while the right side contained a green-and-white version of the Red Auerbach memorial shamrock used in the 2006–07 season. Contrasting nameplates on the back were inspired by the warmup jackets the team used for much of its history, and the original \"jumping leprechaun\" logo from the 1960s was added to the waist. Retired numbers, the Auerbach signature and quotation (see 2021 \"City\" uniform), and 17 shamrocks representing each championship season, surrounded the jock tag.[241] The 2022–23 \"City\" uniform served as a memorial to Bill Russell, who died on July 31. The uniform is dark green with metallic gold and black accents, and has the \"Celtics\" wordmark inspired by the Slade's Bar & Grill restaurant once owned by Russell. The black stripes contained 11 gold diamonds on each side, commemorating each of Russell's championships, and also featured a grayscale pattern of the parquet floor. The waistband contained Russell's jersey no. 6 surrounded by the 11 gold diamonds.[242] The \"City\" uniform in the 2023–24 season featured a nod to the origins of the game of basketball. The white-based design featured dark green letters and brown trim in reference to traditional maker's marks from Boston's history of furniture makers, along with wood grain accents to reference the peach baskets first used in the game.[243] In another first, the Celtics unveiled an alternate court specific to the 2023 NBA in-season tournament. The design, which is based on the \"City\" uniform, featured a mostly green-painted maple court with a brown strip along the free throw lanes. The silhouette of the NBA Cup is situated along the free throw lanes, and the actual trophy is painted at center court along with the \"BOSTON\" wordmark.[244] For the 2024–25 \"City\" uniform, the Celtics built upon last season's \"City\" uniform and focused on continuous evolution of the game of basketball. The black-based uniform featured \"Action green\" (neon green) letters and striping, along with futuristic-style numbers. [245] During the 2006–07 season, the Celtics wore a commemorative patch of a black shamrock with the nickname \"Red\" in green letters on the right top of the jersey in remembrance of Red Auerbach, who died shortly prior to the beginning of the season.[246] The team has honored deceased members of the Celtics family with a commemorative black band on the left shoulder strap of the jersey. It has been featured thirteen times to date: Walter Brown (1964–65), Bob Schmertz (1975–76), Joan Cohen (1989–90), Johnny Most (1992–93), Reggie Lewis (1993–94), Dorothy Auerbach (2000–01), Dennis Johnson (2006–07),[246] Jim Loscutoff (2015–16), Jo Jo White (2017–18), John Havlicek (2018–19), Tom Heinsohn, and K. C. Jones (both 2020–21), Sam Jones (2021–22), and Bill Walton (2023–24). During the 2019–20 season, the Celtics wore a black band in honor of two people who had never been part of the Celtics organization; former NBA commissioner David Stern and former Los Angeles Lakers star Kobe Bryant. The Celtics have also worn a black band for reasons not directly related to the franchise, such as the Boston Marathon bombing in 2013, and the death of Isaiah Thomas' younger sister during the 2017 NBA playoffs. In the 2022–23 season, the Celtics joined the rest of the NBA in wearing the black no. 6 patch in memory of Bill Russell.[247] The team also had the tradition of wearing black sneakers through most of their history. According to legend, Celtics patriarch Red Auerbach had a problem with the white sneakers, claiming that the white sneakers can easily get dirty; hence starting a long tradition with the black sneakers. In the early 1970s, the Celtics changed their sneaker color to green, but by 1985, returned to the customary black due to the difficulty of producing the right shade of Celtic green.[248] Prior to the 2003–04 season, then-Celtics general manager Danny Ainge and captain Paul Pierce suggested wearing white sneakers, in due part to a growing number of teams wearing black sneakers. Ainge gladly accepted and the white sneakers have remained since on home games. They still wore the black sneakers on away games, and brought them back for all home games during the 2004 NBA playoffs, and in one home game during the 2005 NBA playoffs. In the 2008–09 season, they wore white sneakers with green and gold accents while wearing their St. Patrick's Day jerseys on the road. Most recently, when the Celtics play on Christmas Day, they wore white or green sneakers with red and gold accents.[249] Since the 2009–10 season, the NBA relaxed its rules on specified sneaker colors, and Celtics players are now seen wearing custom-made and personalized sneakers at home and on the road, although for the most part they wear either green, white or black sneakers. The Celtics were the only team to wear warmup jackets with the player names on the back. During the 1980s, this style was dominant in most NBA warmup jackets, but by the late 1990s, this style gradually declined. The Celtics, however, kept the design in keeping with tradition, before discontinuing the practice after the 2011–12 season in favor of a templated jacket design common to all 30 teams. NBC Sports Boston is the Boston Celtics' main television outlet, having aired its games since 1981 when the station was known as PRISM New England. In 1983, it rebranded as SportsChannel New England. Like all the other SportsChannel networks, the New England channel was rebranded as Fox Sports New England when former owner Cablevision entered into a partnership with Liberty Media and News Corporation in 1998. Comcast purchased Cablevision's original network stake in 2001, then acquired the remaining stake in what was now FSN New England in 2007 and rebranded the network as Comcast SportsNet New England. In 2017, all CSN networks (including CSN New England) were renamed as NBC Sports Regional Networks in reference to Comcast's current ownership of NBCUniversal. As of the 2024–25 season, Drew Carter serves as the television play-by-play announcer with Brian Scalabrine as an analyst. All Celtics games are heard on radio through Beasley Broadcast Group's WBZ-FM (98.5, otherwise branded as \"The Sports Hub\"), with play-by-play from Sean Grande and color commentary from Cedric Maxwell, a deal in place since the 2013–14 season.[250] It is carried on stations in 5 of the 6 New England States via the Boston Celtics Radio Network. Long-time announcers Johnny Most and Mike Gorman have won the Curt Gowdy Media Award for their outstanding work as broadcasters. Most was the team's radio announcer from 1953 to 1990, and Gorman served as the television announcer from 1981 to 2024. *Sale not approved by NBA[254]",

It often causes upper respiratory infections, but it can sometimes cause lower respiratory infections like pneumonia, asthma flare-ups or make chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) worse. HMPV infections are more common in the winter and early spring. Advertisement Cleveland Clinic is a non-profit academic medical center. Advertising on our site helps support our mission. We do not endorse non-Cleveland Clinic products or services. Policy Most people get HMPV before they turn 5. You can get HMPV again, but symptoms are usually mild after your first infection. Human metapneumovirus most often causes symptoms similar to a cold, but some people can get very sick. You’re more likely to get severely sick the first time you get HMPV, which is why young kids have a greater risk for serious illness. You get some protection (immunity) from your first infection and then are more likely to have mild, cold-like symptoms if you get another HMPV infection. Adults over 65 and people with breathing problems or a weakened immune system may also get severe symptoms. Researchers estimate that about 10% to 12% of respiratory illnesses in children are caused by HMPV. Most cases are mild, but about 5% to 16% of children will develop a lower respiratory tract infection like pneumonia. It’s not the same, but human metapneumovirus is similar to RSV (respiratory syncytial virus). It’s part of the same genus — or scientific grouping — as RSV (Pneumovirus), and can cause similar symptoms. The peak age for severe illness from HMPV is between 6 and 12 months, but RSV is more likely to cause severe illness in infants younger than 6 months. Symptoms of human metapneumovirus include: Advertisement A virus — a small germ that uses your cells to make more copies of itself — causes HMPV. It’s part of the same group of viruses that cause RSV, measles and mumps. HMPV spreads through direct contact with someone who has it or from touching things contaminated with the virus. For instance: Anyone can get HMPV, but you’re at a higher risk for severe illness if you: Sometimes HMPV causes complications. These might be serious and require you to be hospitalized. They include: Healthcare providers usually diagnose HMPV based on your symptoms and health history. They might use a soft-tipped stick (swab) to get a sample from your nose or throat. A lab tests the sample for viruses and other infections. Keep in mind that you probably won’t be tested for HMPV unless you have serious symptoms. Sometimes, your provider may also do a bronchoscopy or chest X-rays to look for changes in the airways of your lungs. There aren’t any antiviral medications that treat human metapneumovirus. Most people can manage their symptoms at home until they feel better. If you or your child are severely ill, you might need to be admitted to the hospital. There, healthcare providers can monitor your condition and help prevent you from getting sicker. They might treat you with: No. Antibiotics only treat bacteria. Since HMPV is a virus, antibiotics won’t get rid of it. Sometimes people who get pneumonia from HMPV also get a bacterial infection at the same time (secondary infection). If your provider prescribes antibiotics, it would be to treat any secondary infections. You can reduce your risk of getting HMPV and other infectious diseases by: Advertisement Mild cases of human metapneumovirus usually last a few days to a week. If you’re very sick, it’ll probably take longer to feel better. You might also have lingering symptoms, like a cough, that take longer to go away.

If you’re older than 5, you’ve probably already had it at least once. Most of the time, you’ll get better at home in a few days. But sometimes HMPV can cause serious complications. Young children, adults over 65 and people with weakened immune systems are at a higher risk for severe illness. Talk to your healthcare provider if you have any concerns about HMPV. Seek medical care right away if you or your child is having trouble breathing or if you have other signs of serious illness. Advertisement Last reviewed on 06/20/2023.

Human metapneumovirus (HMPV) can cause upper and lower respiratory disease in people of all ages, especially among young children, older adults, and people with weakened immune systems. Discovered in 2001, HMPV is in the Pneumoviridae family along with respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). Broader use of molecular diagnostic testing has increased identification and awareness of HMPV as an important cause of upper and lower respiratory infection. Symptoms commonly associated with HMPV include cough, fever, nasal congestion, and shortness of breath. Clinical symptoms of HMPV infection may progress to bronchitis or pneumonia and are similar to other viruses that cause upper and lower respiratory infections. The estimated incubation period is 3 to 6 days, and the median duration of illness can vary depending upon severity but is similar to other respiratory infections caused by viruses. HMPV is most likely spread from an infected person to others through In the U.S., HMPV circulates in distinct annual seasons. HMPV circulation begins in winter and lasts until or through spring. Surveillance data from CDC's the National Respiratory and Enteric Virus Surveillance System (NREVSS) shows HMPV to be most active during late winter and spring in temperate climates. HMPV, RSV, and influenza can circulate simultaneously during the respiratory virus season. Your patients can help prevent the spread of HMPV and other respiratory viruses by following these steps: Patients who have cold-like symptoms should In addition, cleaning possible contaminated surfaces (such as doorknobs and shared toys) may potentially help stop the spread of HMPV. In healthcare settings, healthcare providers should follow CDC's 2007 Guideline for Isolation Precautions: Preventing Transmission of Infectious Agents in Healthcare Settings. Since HMPV is a recently recognized respiratory virus, healthcare professionals may not routinely consider or test for HMPV. However, healthcare professionals should consider HMPV testing during winter and spring, especially when HMPV is commonly circulating. Infection with HMPV can be confirmed usually by Currently, there is no specific antiviral therapy to treat HMPV and no vaccine to prevent HMPV. Medical care is supportive.

It is a seasonal disease that usually occurs in the winter and early spring, similar to RSV and the flu. Anyone can be infected with hMPV but it is most common in children, older adults and people with weakened immune systems. It spreads through close contact with an infected person and, in most cases, will go away on its own after a few days. People with hMPV usually have mild symptoms similar to a cold, but young children, older adults and those with a weakened immune system may develop a more severe illness. Most hMPV infections only last about 2-5 days and go away on their own. Treatment consists of supportive care to ease symptoms. Many times, patients with severe hMPV are very young, so they rely on a caregiver to talk to their doctor. Here are some questions to ask on their behalf.

These may include: In more severe cases, patients may experience wheezing, difficulty breathing and asthma flare-ups. Secondary lower respiratory infections may occur such as bronchiolitis, bronchitis or pneumonia, requiring additional medical care. Most people experiencing mild hMPV symptoms do not need to see a doctor, as the illness should go away on its own and supportive care of symptoms at home is enough. However, if symptoms worsen and you develop shortness of breath, severe cough or wheezing, you should see a doctor. To diagnose a respiratory infection, your doctor will complete a physical and patient history. To further diagnose hMPV as the source of the respiratory infection, your doctor may order lab tests to confirm the type of virus causing your illness. In very few severe hospitalized cases, doctors may do a bronchoscopy where a small, flexible camera is inserted into the lung and a sample of fluid is removed to test for viruses.

                "content": "Diseases & Conditions Human metapneumovirus (hMPV) is a recently identified member of a family of viruses that also includes respiratory syncytial virus and parainfluenza virus. Although identified in 2001 by investigators from the Netherlands, data suggest this is a common virus that has been responsible for respiratory illnesses for at least 50 years worldwide. Human metapneumovirus can cause upper and lower respiratory tract infections in patients of all ages but respiratory illnesses most often occur in young children or older adults. Spread of the virus is most likely to occur by direct or close contact with the respiratory secretions of infected persons or by contact with objects and surfaces contaminated by their secretions. Most persons with hMPV infection have mild symptoms including cough, runny nose or nasal congestion, sore throat and fever. More severe illness, with wheezing, difficulty breathing, hoarseness, cough, pneumonia, and in adults, aggravation of asthma, also has been reported. In children younger than 1 year of age, the elderly and persons who have weak immune systems, hMPV can cause more serious respiratory illness. It is most common in late winter and early spring in the United States, however, one summer outbreak of hMPV respiratory illnesses in residents and staff of a long-term care facility in the United States has been reported. It is believed most persons who develop illness will do so three to five days after being exposed to this virus. Limited data suggests that reinfection with hMPV can occur. It is believed most children become infected early in life and adult infections represent persons becoming infected with hMPV again. Repeated infection appears to result in milder illness although serious disease is a risk for patients who are immunocompromised. Human metapneumovirus testing is not readily available. At this time, research laboratories and a limited number of commercial laboratories perform testing for this virus. Supportive treatment for patients varies with the severity of the illness but generally treatment consists of fever reducers, antihistamines, breathing treatments and other means of providing comfort to the patient until the illness resolves. Control measures used for other respiratory illnesses should be emphasized: covering the mouth and nose with a tissue when coughing or sneezing, or, coughing or sneezing into the upper sleeve rather than the hands, prompt disposal of used tissues and proper handwashing. Non-human primates can become infected with human metapneumovirus; humans are their likely source of infection.",

With no time to waste in 2025, the first celestial show of the year gets underway this week with the Quadrantid meteor shower peak. NASA said the Quadrantid meteor shower is unique because of its brief peak and the origin of the shooting stars. Most meteor showers originate from comet debris, but the Quadrantids come from an asteroid.

(Photo by Tayfun Coskun/Anadolu via Getty Images) (Getty Images) The Quadrantids peak each year in early January as the Earth passes through the debris trail from asteroid 2003 EH1. Astronomers say this asteroid could be a new object known as a \"dead comet\" or \"rock comet.\" DON'T MISS THESE CELESTIAL EVENTS IN 2025 Although the Quadrantids have been observed in the night sky since the early 1800s, their origin was only discovered in 2003.

(Photo by Tayfun Coskun/Anadolu via Getty Images) Also, unlike other annual meteor showers, which peak over several days, the Quadrantids are a quick skygazing show. The peak lasts just six hours. According to NASA, this brief encounter is because the Earth crosses the thin stream of particles at a perpendicular angle. According to the American Meteor Society (AMS), this year's peak happens Friday, with the best chance of seeing meteors early Friday morning. During the peak, as many as 200 meteors can be seen under perfect weather and viewing conditions. The timing of this year's Quadrantid meteor shower peaks between 15:00 and 18:00 UTC (10 a.m. and 1 p.m. EST), which favors those in Hawaii and Alaska, according to AMS Editor Robert Lunsford. The cloud cover forecast for Friday morning. (FOX Weather) While early January doesn't offer the best weather for stargazing, the peak this year happens a few days after a new Moon with only 11% illumination. This means less moonlight to compete with the meteor shower. Unfortunately, cloud cover will cover many parts of the U.S. with active winter weather happening. According to the AMS, the Quadrantids continue through mid-January, when an average of 25 meteors per hour are possible under good conditions.

                "content": "A daily update by email. Science news, great photos, sky alerts. The Quadrantid meteor shower is one of a few each year with a narrow peak, in this case lasting only about 6 hours. When to watch: The best time to watch for the 2025 Quadrantids is the hours before dawn on January 3. (The predicted peak** is 19 UTC on January 3). Nearest moon phase: A first quarter moon will come at 23:56 UTC on January 6, 2025 (5:56 p.m. CST) so the moon will be a waxing crescent and set a few hours after sunset on January 2 and not interfere with the Quadrantid meteors. Radiant: Rises in the north-northeast after midnight and is highest up before dawn. The radiant point for the Quadrantids is in a now-obsolete constellation, Quadrans Muralis the Mural Quadrant. Nowadays, we see the radiant near the famous Big Dipper asterism. Because the Quadrantid radiant is far to the north on the sky’s dome, this is mostly a far-northern shower, not as good for the Southern Hemisphere. Expected meteors at peak, under ideal conditions: Under a dark sky with no moon, when the radiant is high in the sky, the Quadrantids can (briefly) produce over 100 meteors per hour. Duration of shower: The Quadrantid meteor shower runs from mid-November through mid-January each year, according to this 2017 article in the journal Icarus. You might see a Quadrantid streak by any time during that interval. But most activity is centered on the peak. This time period is when we’re passing through the meteor stream in space! Note: The Quadrantid shower is one of four major meteor showers each year with a sharp peak (the other three are the Lyrids, Leonids and Ursids). Report a fireball (very bright meteor) to the American Meteor Society: it’s fun and easy! From the late, great Don Machholz (1952-2022), who discovered 12 comets … For many years, the parent comet for the Quadrantids remained unknown. That’s because astronomers were looking for an object whose orbit matched the orbit of the Quadrantids’ meteor stream. Other meteor showers do have parent objects whose orbits match their meteor streams. But the Quadrantids’ parent object – or objects – are different. There are currently at least two related objects associated with Quadrantid meteors. Neither presently comes anywhere near Earth’s orbit. But both seem to be responsible for these early January meteors. The chief object that spawns the Quadrantids is an asteroid named 2003 EH1. It’s believed to be a dormant or extinct comet. The Lowell Observatory Near-Earth-Object Search (LONEOS) based near Flagstaff, Arizona, found asteroid 2003 EH1 on March 6, 2003. The asteroid takes 5.5 years to orbit the sun. Its closest point to the sun (perihelion) is 1.2 astronomical units (AU). One AU is the distance between the Earth and the sun. In past centuries, 2003 EH1 must have passed much closer to the Earth’s orbit. Now, though, this asteroid stays well outside Earth’s orbit. Yet particles ejected from this asteroid do intersect Earth’s orbit, to produce the Quadrantids’ narrow peak. And astronomers now say there is also a second, related object that also contributes to this meteor shower. The second object – Comet 96P/Machholz – produces a less intense and shallower peak. The material we see streaking across the sky left this comet centuries ago. Its perihelion distance is 0.12 AU, and it orbits the sun every 5.3 years. It was back near the Earth in late January 2023. 2025 EarthSky lunar calendar is available now. A unique and beautiful poster-sized calendar with phases of the moon for every night of the year. Get yours today! What’s the story on these two parent objects for the Quadrantids? The latest theory is that a large comet was captured by our sun and settled into a short-period orbit in about 2,000 BCE. This comet supplied meteors to the inner solar system and then it broke apart sometime between 100 CE and 950 CE. This breakup produced the Machholz Complex. In other words, there are multiple resultant offspring of this great comet. They are Comet 96P/Machholz, the Marsden Comet Group, the Kracht Comet Group, asteroid 2003 EH1 and eight meteor showers. The group is named the Machholz Complex after the main object, 96P/Machholz. A comet that was seen more than 500 years ago, C/1490 Y1, might be involved, too. The orbit calculated for this comet comes from rough positions calculated for the comet’s predicted return, which should be every few years. But we have not seen this comet again. One study suggests it approached too close to the planet Jupiter. So it might have been thrown out of the solar system. That might be why we haven’t seen it since 1490. Or, the comet might have split up prior to its next return, producing the Machholz Complex. This is not the final word about the parent objects of the Quadrantid meteor shower. Research continues among orbit calculators to better understand the transition of material from the surface of these objects to our Earth’s atmosphere every January. A new paper comes out nearly every year on the subject. That is how science works. Regardless of their origins, the Quadrantid meteor shower is a fine way to start a new year. The radiant point of the Quadrantid shower makes an approximate right angle with the Big Dipper and the bright star Arcturus. If you trace the paths of the Quadrantid meteors backward, they appear to radiate from this point on the starry sky. See chart at the top of this page. Now for our usual caveat. You don’t need to find the meteor shower radiant to see the Quadrantid meteors. You need to be at mid-northern or far-northern latitudes, up in the wee hours of the morning, and hope the peak comes at just the right time to your part of the world. The meteors will radiate from the northern sky but appear in all parts of the sky. Most meteor showers get their name from the constellations from which they appear to radiate. So it is with the Quadrantids. But the Quadrantids’ constellation no longer exists, except in memory. The name Quadrantid comes from the constellation Quadrans Muralis (Mural Quadrant). French astronomer Jerome Lalande created this constellation in 1795. This now-obsolete constellation was between the constellations of Boötes the Herdsman and Draco the Dragon. What happened to it? Where’d it go? To understand the history of the Quadrantids’ name, we go back to the earliest observations of this meteor shower. In early January 1825, Antonio Brucalassi in Italy reported that: … the atmosphere was traversed by a multitude of the luminous bodies known by the name of falling stars. They appeared to radiate from Quadrans Muralis. In 1839, two men, Adolphe Quetelet of Brussels Observatory in Belgium and Edward C. Herrick in Connecticut, independently suggested the Quadrantids as an annual shower. Then, in 1922, the International Astronomical Union (IAU) created a list of the 88 modern constellations. And it did not include Quadrans Muralis. Hardly anyone would remember this old constellation, if not for the Quadrantid meteor shower. The Quadrantids favor the Northern Hemisphere because their radiant is so far north on the sky’s dome. If you’re in the Southern Hemisphere, you might be tempted to resign yourself to the months-long meteor drought that kicks off every year and ends in April with the Lyrids. But, once in a while, we do hear from Southern Hemisphere dwellers who’ve seen a few Quadrantids! Bottom line: The best time to watch the Quadrantid meteor shower in 2025 is the hours before dawn on January 3, in a moon-free sky. This shower has a narrow peak, lasting only hours. **Peak times for meteor showers provided by Robert Lunsford of the American Meteor Society. Note that meteor shower predicted peaks may vary.

                "content": "The first meteor shower of the New Year also has the potential to be one of the year's best – if the weather cooperates. But astronomers lament that the Quadrantid meteors tend to fall short of expectations due to the comparatively short length of their maximum activity and the obscuring wintry conditions of early January. That doesn't mean the cosmic display – one of the few meteor showers to be caused by debris from an asteroid instead of a comet – isn't worth seeking out. Stargazers could be treated to a host of bright fireballs and the sight of multiple meteors per hour whizzing across the night sky at more than 25 miles per second when the Quadrantids reach their peak. Here's what to know about the Quadrantid meteor shower, including when it peaks and what causes it. Meteor showers occur on a predictable schedule each year, with some lasting for mere days and others stretching on for weeks. A meteor shower is at its best when the Earth passes through the densest part of the associated cosmic debris. That window, otherwise known as the shower's peak activity, is when stargazers will want to be on the lookout for meteors. The Quadrantids began zipping through the skies on Dec. 26 and will continue through Jan. 16, according to the American Meteor Society. But while most meteor showers have a two-day peak, the Quadrantids' maximum activity only lasts a few hours – making the meteors much more difficult to spot, according to NASA. For stargazers, that means the best time to catch the Quadrantid meteors will be in the predawn hours Thursday night into Friday morning, astronomers say. Timeanddate.com offers a detailed schedule for when to see the Quadrantids. The Quadrantids are best viewed from the Northern Hemisphere and are not well seen from the Southern Hemisphere. During its peak, anywhere from 60 to 200 Quadrantid meteors can be seen per hour under ideal conditions, according to NASA. While the meteors are known to lack persistent tails, they often produce bright fireballs, which are larger explosions of light persisting longer than an average meteor streak. The meteors seem to emerge – or radiate – from an obsolete constellation called \"Quadrans Muralis\" that today is located between the constellations of Bootes and Draco near the end of the handle of the Big Dipper, NASA says. Both the constellation and the shower are named after the quadrant, an early astronomical instrument used to observe and plot star positions. Astronomers caution that the radiant is not a good guide for where stargazers should look to view the streaking meteors, which should be visible across the night sky. Here are some general viewing tips from NASA: ◾ Find an area well away from street lights and the light pollution of cities. ◾ Come prepared for winter temperatures with a sleeping bag, blanket, or lawn chair. ◾ Lie flat on your back with your feet facing northeast and look up, taking in as much of the sky as possible. It should take less than 30 minutes for your eyes to adapt so that you can see streaking meteors. Meteor showers occur when Earth passes through dusty debris trails left by comets and other space objects as they orbit the sun. The debris – space rocks known as meteoroids – collides with Earth's atmosphere at high speed and disintegrates, creating fiery and colorful streaks in the sky, according to NASA. Those resulting fireballs, better known as \"shooting stars,\" are meteors. If meteoroids survive their trip to Earth without burning up in the atmosphere, they are called meteorites, NASA says. Unlike most meteor showers, the Quadrantid meteor shower doesn't originate from a comet, but from an asteroid. For many years, the origin of the Quadrantids remained unknown. Though the Quadrantids were first seen in 1825, it wasn't until 2003 that an astronomer at Lowell Observatory in Arizona discovered a small asteroid, 2003 EH1, was the source of the shower. Astronomers theorize that 2003 EH1, which takes about 5 ½ years to orbit the sun, is a dead comet that is now essentially a rock. Eric Lagatta covers breaking and trending news for USA TODAY.

The Quadrantid meteor shower is active from late December 2024 to early January 2025. It will peak on 3–4 January. Read on for tips on how to catch the best view of this stunning shower from planetary scientist and meteorite expert Dr Ashley King. Meteors are often called shooting stars, though the bright streaks you see in the sky don’t have anything to do with stars. In fact, what you’re wishing on are tiny particles of dust – leftovers from the birth of our solar system – vaporising in Earth’s atmosphere. Some of the more spectacular of these meteors can sometimes be visible from city centres, including in London, however you’re bound to get the best experience away from the light pollution in urban areas. A bright meteor recorded on a meteor-monitoring CCTV camera at the Natural History Museum. “The darker the skies, the better your chances of seeing the really faint meteors as well,” says Ashley. “You could go to the coast or stand on a hill in the middle of the countryside somewhere.” A full Moon can really light up the sky too, so you’ll likely have more success spotting meteors when a shower’s peak coincides with a new Moon. Fortunately, in 2025, several showers are set to occur when the skies are at their darkest. You also need to be patient. “You might not be able to see anything for the first 10 minutes while your eyes adjust to the dark,” he adds. “Once you get used to the low light levels you’ll begin to notice more and more. So don’t give up too quickly.” Meteor showers occur when Earth passes through streams of tiny pieces of debris – meteoroids – left behind by comets and asteroids. The peak of a meteor shower is when we see the highest rate of meteors. This happens as we pass through the densest part of the debris stream. Most comets are composed of dust and ice, which Ashley likens to “a big, dirty snowball”. “As comets orbit the Sun, the ice sublimes [changes from a solid to a gas] and the trapped dust is swept out into a tail behind them.” Nearly all meteors are tiny dust particles, about the size of a grain of sand travelling at tens of kilometres per second through space. “As they come out of the vacuum of space and into Earth’s atmosphere, that little dust grain interacts with all the particles and ions in the atmosphere. It gets heated up by the friction and forms the impressive flash that we see,” he says. “The Earth isn’t close to the comet – it’s just passing through some of the dust it left behind.” At other times of year, you may still see meteors in the sky, but only about one every 10 minutes. These sporadic meteors, as they are known, will come from random directions. A lone meteor. © Jacek Halick (CC BY-SA 4.0) via Wikimedia commons The Quadrantid meteor shower begins on 28 December 2024 and ends on 12 January 2025, and is best viewed from the Northern Hemisphere. It’s thought to occur when Earth passes through the trail left by the asteroid 2003 EH1. The Quadrantid meteor shower has a much shorter peak than others, lasting for just six hours before its intensity rapidly drops off. In 2025, the peak will occur on 3–4 January, just a few days after a new Moon. At its peak, and in ideal viewing conditions, up to 120 meteors and bright fireballs can be seen per hour, with the particles entering Earth’s atmosphere at around 40 kilometres per second. The Quadrantids appear to radiate from an area near the Big Dipper between the constellations of Boötes and Draco. This area was previously recognised as a separate constellation, which was named Quadrans Muralis by French astronomer Jerome Lalande in 1795. In 1922, the decision was made to no longer recognise Quadrans Muralis as an official constellation, but the meteor shower still continues to be named after it. In March 2003, a small near-Earth asteroid was discovered and named as 2003 EH1. This body completes an orbit of the Sun once every 5.5 years and is thought to be the source of the Quadrantid meteor shower. Some think that 2003 EH1 might be an extinct comet. This is a comet that has expelled most of its ice and so appears more like an asteroid, as it no longer has enough material to form a tail or coma – the ice and dust envelope that forms around a comet’s solid centre. People watching a meteor shower. © Allexxandar/ Shutterstock The Lyrid meteor shower takes place between 14–30 April as the Earth’s orbit passes through the dust trail left behind, hundreds of years ago, by comet C/186 G1 (Thatcher). This year, at the peak of the display on 22 April, around 18 meteors per hour are expected to be visible. The most spectacular are ‘Lyrid fireballs’, which occur when meteoroids the size of a large marble pass through the atmosphere. Their slightly larger size produces a meteor train which we see as a flash and line across the night sky. This year, the peak of the Lyrids falls during the Moon’s last quarter, making viewing conditions much better than in 2024, when it coincided with a full Moon. The Lyrid meteor shower gets its name because it appears to radiate from the area of the sky near the constellation Lyra, the Harp – but the meteors can appear anywhere in the sky. Comet Thatcher, responsible for the Lyrid meteor shower, takes 415 years to complete a full orbit of the Sun. We have no photographs of this comet because the last time it visited the inner solar system was in 1861 – well before the widespread use of photography. We won’t see it again until the year 2283.

Most meteors are pieces of dust around the size of a grain of sand. Larger pieces can create spectacular fireballs and make bright trails across the sky. The Perseid shower may feature more than 100 meteors per hour at its peak, including bright streaks and fireballs. The best views will be from a dark location on the night of 12 August. This meteor shower is usually one of the best celestial events of the year to watch. Unfortunately, viewing conditions for the Perseids won’t be ideal this year, with the peak falling just three days after a full Moon. Perseids get their name because they appear to radiate from the constellation Perseus, but they can appear anywhere in the sky. Swift-Tuttle, responsible for the Perseid meteor shower, takes 133 years to complete a full orbit of the Sun. At 26 kilometres wide it is the largest solar system object to regularly pass so close to Earth. It’s likely significantly bigger than the asteroid that ended the age of dinosaurs, but don’t worry, calculations have shown that Swift-Tuttle isn’t a threat to the planet. Swift-Tuttle’s elongated orbit means that debris enters Earth’s atmosphere at great speed.

In 2025, the shower is due to peak on the night of 21–22 October. This year the peak falls on a moonless night, giving you ideal dark sky conditions for spotting meteors. Orionids are some of the fastest and brightest meteors, entering the atmosphere at just under 70 kilometres per second. Orionids get their name because they seem to radiate from the constellation Orion, but they can appear anywhere in the sky. Stargazers can usually expect to see up to 20 meteors per hour. Halley’s Comet is a short-period comet, meaning it takes less than 200 years to go around the Sun. Its orbital period is 75–76 years and it last passed close to Earth in 1986. It will be back again in 2061. In 1986, space agencies sent the missions Vega, Giotto, Sakigake and Suisei to Halley – known as the ‘Halley Armada’ – so it’s one of the best-studied comets. Halley’s Comet has been observed for centuries – in 1066 it was considered an omen of doom. It even appears on the Bayeux Tapestry, which depicts events leading up to the Norman conquest of England in the eleventh century. Orionid meteor shower and the Milky Way. © Brian Spencer/ Shutterstock The Leonid meteor shower takes place annually between 6–30 November as Earth crosses the trail of comet 55P/Tempel-Tuttle. Entering the atmosphere at 70 kilometres per second, the Leonids are some of the fastest-moving and brightest meteors. The shower promises up to 15 meteors per hour at its peak on the evening of 17 November, which is just a few days before a new Moon. Leonids get their name because they seem to radiate from the constellation Leo. Comet Tempel-Tuttle is a short-period comet, taking 33 years to go around the Sun. Its last visit was in 1998 with a return expected in 2031. The comet is quite small, only about three kilometres across. The comet is named for the two astronomers, Ernst Tempel and Horace Tuttle, who each independently discovered it in 1865 and 1866, respectively. Horace Tuttle also co-discovered Comet Swift-Tuttle, which causes the Perseid meteor shower. One of the most spectacular meteor showers of the year, the Geminids take place from 4–20 December as Earth passes through the trail of dust left by the ‘rock comet’ 3200 Phaethon. At the shower’s peak on the morning of 14 December, stargazers willing to brave the cold could be rewarded with a display of up to 150 multicoloured meteors per hour. It’s often one of the best showers of the year for viewers in the northern hemisphere, as it’s one of the most active. This year it falls just a few days before a new Moon. Geminids get their name because meteors appear to radiate from the constellation Gemini. Discovered by satellite in 1983, Phaethon has an orbital period of 524 days and is one of only a few asteroids associated with a meteor shower. According to Ashley, there’s been quite a lot of debate about what Phaethon really is. “Like other comets, Phaethon has an elliptical orbit but is unusual as it doesn’t go to the outer solar system. It has been officially classified as a B-type asteroid, but it has also been suggested that it could be a ‘rock comet’ or a ‘dead comet’.” Scientists have been studying Phaethon’s infrared emissions to learn more about this mysterious space rock. In 2023, this research revealed that Phaethon is likely linked to the CY group of carbonaceous chondrites. Carbonaceous chondrites are some of the oldest rocks in the solar system. They are often rich in water, sulphur and organic material, but those in the CY group show signs of drying and decomposition caused by heating. Phaethon travels even closer to the Sun than Mercury does. Scientists at the Natural History Museum have helped estimate that, at perihelion – the asteroid’s closest point to the Sun – its surface reaches 730 °C and some of its components turn to gas. The pressure this gas creates causes the rock to break down, leaving a comet-like trail of dust behind the asteroid as it travels through space. Phaethon may once have been similar to the asteroid Ryugu, from which the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA) Hayabusa2 mission returned samples in December 2020, and Bennu, an asteroid visited by NASA’s OSIRIS-REx mission, which returned to Earth with samples in September 2023. Our scientists have been leading some of the first analyses of the Bennu samples. Phaethon is considered a potentially hazardous asteroid, meaning it could impact the Earth at some point hundreds of years in the future. For this reason, it’s very well studied and there are plans to send space missions there in the future, such as DESTINY+, which aims to launch in 2028.

Anyone can capture the majesty of the galaxy with a simple camera. All you need is a dark, clear night and the willingness to have a go. When an unusual rock fell to Earth in 1795, it prompted the first large-scale investigation into the origin of meteorites. Falling from the sky in a blaze of glory, meteorites certainly know how to make an entrance, and the stories they tell span the history of our solar system.

                "title": "Illinois Fighting Illini men's basketball - Wikipedia",
                "content": "The Illinois Fighting Illini men's basketball team is an NCAA Division I college basketball team competing in the Big Ten Conference, that represent the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign. Home games are played at the State Farm Center, located on the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign's campus in Champaign. Illinois has one pre-tournament national championship and one non-NCAA tournament national championship in 1915 and 1943, awarded by the Premo-Porretta Power Poll. Illinois has appeared in the NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament 34 times, and has competed in 5 Final Fours, 10 Elite Eights, and has won 18 Big Ten regular season championships, and 4 Big Ten Tournament Championships. The team is currently coached by Brad Underwood, who was hired on March 18, 2017. Through the end of the 2023–24 season, Illinois ranks 13th all-time in winning percentage and 13th all-time in wins among all NCAA Division I men's college basketball programs. The Illinois Fighting Illini men's basketball team began play during the 1905–06 season with Elwood Brown guiding the team to a 9–8 record as their first coach. Frank L. Pinckney took control of the team before the start of the 1906–07 season. The team would win their first game but would end up dropping the next 10 contests. Another coaching change led to Fletcher Lane being in charge of the team for the 1907–08 season. After starting the season 14–1 in non-conference, Illinois would finish the season losing five of their 11 conference games, ending the year third in the Western Conference with a 20–6 (6–5) record. Even though Lane led a successful season, his style of coaching was deemed subpar. Former Illini player Herb Juul was then hired as the head coach of the 1908–09 squad. The Illini would not see the same success as the season prior, finishing the season with a 7–6 (5–6) record. Despite the struggles, Juul became the first coach in Illinois history to return for more than one season. However, the 1909–10 season would be his last as the Illini finished with a 5–4 (5–4) record. Thomas E. Thompson took the reigns before the 1910–11 season. The Illini would finish fourth in the Western Conference after earning a 6–6 (6–5) record. The 1911–12 season was Thompson's last year as head coach of the Illini after they finished with an 8–8 (4–8) record. Before the start of the 1912–13 season, Illinois hired former Purdue head coach, Ralph Jones. During his three seasons in West Lafayette, Jones compiled a 32–9 record, while also winning the previous two Western Conference titles. During his first season with Illinois, Jones led the Illini to a 10–6 record which was Illinois' second 10-win season in school history. During the 1914–15 season, Illinois won their first-ever Big Ten title, going 16–0 (12–0). They were retroactively declared champion of that season by the Helms Athletic Foundation and the Premo-Porretta Power Poll. They would earn another Big Ten title during the 1916–17 season, sharing it with Minnesota. Before the start of the 1936–37 season, Douglas R. Mills began acting as the head coach and athletic director of the Illinois men's basketball team. In his first season, the Illini finished with a 14–4 (10–2) record, which was good enough to share the Big Ten title with Minnesota. Before World War II broke out, the Fighting Illini men's basketball program had achieved a status that had never been seen prior. Mills grouped a team of players, all around 6-foot-3, into a nearly undefeatable lineup later known as the \"Whiz Kids\". The 1941–42 freshman and sophomore lineup of Arthur Smiley, Ken Menke, Andy Phillip, Gene Vance, Victor Wukovits, and Art Mathisen dominated the Big Ten by posting a 13–2 conference record and winning the conference title outright. It would be their first unanimous Big Ten championship since 1915. The Illini finished 1942–43 season with a 17–1 (12–0) record, winning their second-straight Big Ten title. Despite being ranked No. 1 in the nation, they opted not to play in the 1943 NCAA tournament after three of their five starters were called to duty in World War II. At the end of the season, they were named Premo-Porretto Pre-Associated Press Poll national champions. The 1946–47 season, would be Mills' last season as the head coach of the Illini. The team ended the season with a 14–6 (8–4) record, finishing one game behind Wisconsin in the Big Ten standings. Under Mills, the Illini compiled a record of 151 wins and 66 losses while winning three conference championships in the process. Champaign High School basketball coach Harry Combes was hired to succeed Doug Mills as Mills left the position to focus on his duties as the athletic director. Through his first five seasons as head coach, Combes led the Fighting Illini to three NCAA Final Four appearances in 1949, 1951, and 1952.[2] During his tenure as coach, Combes increased the Fighting Illini's offensive output by changing their style of play. Combes implemented Full-court press defense, causing turnovers at a high rate which translated into Fast break points.[2] In 1951, Combes signed the first black player to don an Illinois uniform, 3x All-State point guard Walt Moore of Mount Vernon. Along with teammate and future Illinois standout Max Hooper, Moore led the Rams to back-to-back state championship titles, culminating with a perfect 33–0 record in 1950. During the 1957–58 season, Mannie Jackson and Govoner Vaughn were inserted into the starting lineup as the first two African-Americans to start and letter in basketball at Illinois.[3] Combes also oversaw the Illini's move from Huff Hall to Assembly Hall in 1963 and during that same season the Illini won a fourth Big Ten Conference championship under Combes. However, the Illini lost to eventual national champion Loyola (Chicago) in the Elite Eight of the 1963 NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament. The following 1964–65 season, saw several upset victories over defending national champion UCLA Bruins and national powerhouse Kentucky Wildcats at Memorial Coliseum in Lexington, Kentucky.[2] Combes' tenure came to an end as a result of the University of Illinois slush fund scandal. As head coach of the basketball team, he was primarily responsible for the basketball fund, and thus held a key role in the scandal. Assistant basketball coach Howie Braun also lost his job due to the scandal. Former Illini player Harv Schmidt was hired to fill the head coaching vacancy ten days after Combes' forced resignation. During his tenure, the Illini compiled an 89-77 overall record but went 43-55 in conference play. The team did not have any postseason appearances during his tenure. Gene Bartow would later sign a five-year contract to replace Schmidt in 1974, but he left after one season in which the Illini finished last place in the conference to replace John Wooden at UCLA. In 1975, after having taken New Mexico State (and future Illinois assistant coach Jimmy Collins) to the 1970 Final Four, Lou Henson moved to the University of Illinois to replace Gene Bartow, after Bartow left Illinois to replace the legendary John Wooden at UCLA. Henson would lead the Fighting Illini back to their glory after having a number of difficult years following the Illinois slush fund scandal (where Illinois was hit with severe penalties for infractions that other Big 10 schools had in years prior been punished much more leniently (according to Sports Illustrated) at the time). In 21 years at Illinois, Henson garnered 423 wins and 224 losses (.654 winning percentage), and with a record of 214 wins and 164 losses (.567) in Big Ten Conference games. The 214 wins in Big Ten games were the third highest total ever at the time of his retirement. At Illinois, Henson coached many future NBA players, including Eddie Johnson, Derek Harper, Ken Norman, Nick Anderson, Kendall Gill, Kenny Battle, Marcus Liberty, Steve Bardo, and Kiwane Garris. In 1981, Illinois made strides in its return to the national spotlight with a 21–8 record, a third-place Big Ten finish and an invitation to the NCAA Tournament. The team received a first-round bye in the NCAA Tournament and beat Wyoming, 67–65, in Los Angeles to advance to the regionals in Salt Lake City, where Illinois lost to Kansas State, 57–52. During this season, the Fighting Illini led the Big Ten in scoring for the second consecutive season and were again led by Eddie Johnson and Mark Smith. Guards Craig Tucker and Derek Harper arrived to add backcourt punch, and Harper began his Illini career being named First-Team Freshman All-America by ESPN and ABC. The top-seeded and top-ranked 1989 Illini were upset 83–81 in the Final Four on a last second basket by Michigan's Sean Higgins, ending the school's deepest run in the tournament at that time. Illinois had beaten the Wolverines by 12 and 16 points in two previous meetings that season. The 1988–89 Illinois Fighting Illini team gained the moniker \"Flyin' Illini\" by Dick Vitale during an ESPN broadcast that season. The team also gained national prominence for its athletic players, such as NCAA slam dunk champions Kenny Battle and Kendall Gill, as well as Lowell Hamilton, Nick Anderson, Marcus Liberty, and Stephen Bardo. The early 1990s Illini were dominated by players such as guards Andy Kauffman, Richard Keene, and Kiwane Garris, as well as centers Shelly Clark and Deon Thomas. Thomas was at the center of a report of misconduct by Iowa Hawkeyes men's basketball assistant coach Bruce Pearl, who alleged that Thomas had been offered cash to attend Illinois. The Illini were suspended from postseason play for one season for unrelated violations uncovered during the investigation. After longtime coach Lou Henson's departure, Illinois hired Lon Kruger to fill the vacancy for the 1996 season. Kruger was the 14th head basketball coach in program history. During his four-year tenure he compiled a 59–38 record. He immediately made an impact at Illinois leading them to a 22–10 record and a second round NCAA tournament appearance in his first year. This created excitement because of the ninth-place finish the Illini had taken just before his arrival. Kruger inherited players such as Victor Chukwudebe, Jerry Hester, Kevin Turner, Jerry Gee, Matt Heldman, Brian Johnson, Kiwane Garris and Cleotis Brown. During his four seasons at Illinois, three of which resulted in NCAA Tournament berths, (all three of which saw the Illini eliminated in the 2nd round) Kruger became the only Big Ten coach to successfully sign three consecutive Illinois Mr. Basketball winners, inking Sergio McClain, Frank Williams, and Brian Cook between 1997 and 1999.Several times during his coaching tenure the Illini were predicted to be at the bottom of the Big Ten, however he overcame adversity each time performing far better than expected. Illinois picked Tulsa coach Bill Self from a list of numerous candidates, including popular assistant Jimmy Collins, to succeed Kruger, who moved on to the NBA to coach the Atlanta Hawks. Bill Self was hired to the Illini coaching staff as the 15th head coach in the history of the program. He spent his previous seven years as the head coach of Oral Roberts University and Tulsa University where he compiled an overall record of 129–71. In 2001, his first season at Illinois, Self coached his new Fighting Illini squad to a 27–8 record, a share of the Big Ten title, and a number 1 seed in the NCAA Tournament. That 27-game winning season in Self's first year was the second most winning season in school history at that time. McClain, Cook and preseason Big Ten player of the year Cory Bradford led the Illini to the Elite Eight, where they fell to eventual finalist Arizona in a much disputed contest. The Illini were accused of being overly physical most of the season, especially McClain and pesky guards Sean Harrington and Lucas Johnson (younger brother of former Illini forward Brian Johnson). The '01 Illini team also included Robert Archibald, Damir Krupalija and Marcus Griffin. With mostly the same core, Illinois followed up the season with impressive 2002 and 2003 campaigns, but fell in the Sweet 16 in 2002. He was the first head coach in the Big Ten, since 1912, to lead his team to conference championships in each of his first two seasons. It was also the first time Illinois won back-to-back titles in 50 years. Self, also, had an overall record of 78–24 in his three years as Illinois head coach. Self left for Kansas after the 2003 season.[4] Bruce Weber served as the head coach of Illinois basketball for nine seasons from 2003 to 2012. After Bill Self left, Illinois AD Ron Guenther hired Weber to coach the Fighting Illini on April 30, 2003. Weber came from Southern Illinois University (SIU) in Carbondale and was touted as a loyal coach, which was valued by the Illinois AD after both Kruger and Self left Champaign with relatively short tenures. In his five seasons as head coach at SIU, Weber took the Saluki program to the top of the Missouri Valley Conference, winning league titles in 2002 and 2003. He posted records of 28–8 and 24–7 in his last two seasons, leading the Salukis to back-to-back NCAA Tournament appearances, including a run to the Sweet 16 in 2002 with wins over Texas Tech and Georgia at the United Center in Chicago. His .689 (62–28) winning percentage in MVC play ranked 12th in the long history of the league. Weber earned Missouri Valley Conference Coach of the Year honors following the 2003 season. Illinois totaled 210 victories under Weber from 2004 to 2012. He ranks third on the Illinois career coaching wins list. He won 67.5 percent of his games while in charge of the Fighting Illini (210–101). Under Weber, the Illini had two Big Ten Championships (2004, 2005), two runner-up finishes (2006, 2009) and seven upper-division finishes. Illinois had five players selected in the NBA draft under Weber, as Deron Williams (No. 3, Utah Jazz) and Luther Head (No. 24, Houston Rockets) were taken in the first round of the 2005 NBA draft, and James Augustine (No. 41, Orlando Magic) and Dee Brown (No. 46, Utah Jazz) were chosen in the second round of the 2006 NBA draft. Meyers Leonard was chosen 11th by the Portland Trail Blazers in the 2012 NBA draft following Weber's final season. Utah's selection of Williams at No. 3 overall in the 2005 lottery made him the highest-drafted player in Illinois history. It took just one season for Weber to etch his name in the Big Ten and Illinois record books after leading the Fighting Illini to its first outright Big Ten title in 52 years during the 2003–04 season. In leading his young team that featured just one senior on the roster, Weber became just the third coach in the history of the Big Ten to win an outright title in his first season. Illinois had to win 10 straight to end the regular season to claim the championship, including six-straight wins on the road. Illinois' 26 wins in 2003–04 tied the fourth-winningest season in school history. Weber also led the Illini to the Sweet 16 with NCAA Tournament victories over Murray State and Cincinnati. Weber's second year at Illinois, the 2004–05 season, will be remembered as one of the greatest in Fighting Illini history, finishing 37–2 as the National Runner-Up in the NCAA tournament. In a remarkable year where Illinois celebrated its centennial season of basketball, the Illini reeled off 29 straight wins to start the year, tying the 12th-best start in NCAA Div. I history and the third-best start in Big Ten history. Illinois also secured its second-straight outright Big Ten championship with a 15–1 league record, as Weber became the first coach in Big Ten history to win consecutive outright titles in his first two seasons. Illinois then added a Big Ten tournament championship in addition to its regular season title. The Illini were ranked No. 1 in the nation for 15 straight weeks, including a first-ever No. 1 ranking in the final Associated Press poll. They gained the #1 overall seed in the NCAA Tournament and prevailed in one of the most memorable games in NCAA history against Arizona. Down 15 points with around 4 minutes left, the Illini rallied with a run led by Luther Head and Deron Williams. The game was sent into overtime and the Illini pulled off a one-point win to advance to the 2005 Final Four in St. Louis. It was the Fighting Illini's first Final Four Appearance since the 1988–89 season. Against the Louisville Cardinals in the national semifinal game, the Illini posted their final victory of the season. All of the five Illini starters–Deron Williams, Luther Head, Dee Brown, James Augustine, and Roger Powell, Jr.–would eventually play in the NBA. Williams and Brown both joined the Utah Jazz roster, while Luther Head went on to play for the Sacramento Kings. With all that Illinois accomplished during the season, Weber swept the 2005 National Coach of the Year awards, claiming the following: the Naismith Award, the most prestigious coaching award in college basketball; the Henry Iba Award, presented by the U.S. Basketball Writers Association; and, the Adolph F. Rupp Cup. Weber was also named National Coach of the Year by the NABC, Associated Press, The Sporting News, Basketball Times, CBS/Chevrolet, Victor Awards and Nike Championship Basketball Clinic. Despite losing three starters and 63 percent of its scoring from the 2004–05 NCAA runner-up squad, Weber directed the 2005–06 Illini to a third-consecutive 4829-win season, a runner-up finish in the Big Ten, the second round of the NCAA Tournament, and a ranking among the nation's top 17 teams throughout the entire season. The Illini spent the majority of 2005–06 ranked in the Top 10 and recorded 26 wins on the year to tie the fourth-winningest season in school history. The Illini were given a number 4 seed in the NCAA tournament, where they beat Air Force in the opening round, before falling to the University of Washington in the second round. The 2006–07 team finished with a record of 23–12 (9–7) and finished tied for fourth in the Big Ten. With a depleted roster that had six different players combine to miss a total of 58 games due to injury, the Illini still advanced to the NCAA Tournament. They were awarded a 12 seed and lost in the opening round to Virginia Tech. The 2007–08 season was one of the worst seasons in Illinois history, highlighted by a string of close losses. The lone bright spot came as Illinois came on strong to win four of its last five and five of its final seven games, which culminated with a runner-up finish at the Big Ten tournament. Weber's Illini became the first No. 10 seed in the tournament's history to advance to the title game, winning three games in three days with victories over Penn State, No. 17 Purdue, and Minnesota to reach the championship game vs. No. 8 Wisconsin. However, with an overall record of 16–19 (5–13), the Illini were not selected to participate in postseason play. Weber's 2008–09 UI squad was one of the most improved teams in the country finishing with a record of 24–10 (11–7). With 10 more regular season victories than it achieved the year before, Illinois posted the third-biggest turnaround in NCAA Division I and the second-biggest turnaround among BCS programs on the year. The Illini recorded 24 wins, ranking as the 10th winningest season in school history. Illinois was the Big Ten runner-up, earned a No. 5 seed in the 2009 NCAA Tournament, and finished the year ranked 24th in the Pomeroy rankings. The Illini lost in the first round of the NCAA tournament to the 12th-seeded Western Kentucky Hilltoppers. During the 2009–10 season, the Illini finished 21–15 (10–8) and finished 5th in the Big Ten. The team was widely considered to be \"on the bubble\" for the NCAA tournament and missed the tournament field by a narrow margin. The Illini competed in the NIT, falling at home to the Dayton Flyers in the NIT Quarterfinals. Illinois rebounded in 2010–11 to finish 20–14 (9–9) and tied for fourth in the Big Ten. The Illini were selected to join the NCAA tournament as a #9 seed, where they defeated the #8 seeded UNLV Rebels setting up a matchup with the #1 seeded Kansas Jayhawks and former coach Bill Self. Kansas proved to be too much for the Illini, and the season came to an end in the round of 32. In 2011–12, Weber's last as coach of the Illini, the team finished 17–15 (6–12), good for 9th in the conference. The team did not compete in the postseason. Illinois' new AD Mike Thomas fired Weber after the 2011–12 season. John Groce was hired by the new athletic director Mike Thomas on March 28, 2012.[5] During the 2012–13 season, the Illini were the Maui Invitational champions and later made the NCAA tournament, losing their second game to the Miami Hurricanes by a score of 63–59. The Illini spent eight weeks nationally ranked in the NCAA Division I rankings, and for two weeks were ranked as high as 10th in the country. The 2013–14 season saw major roster turnover, with nine players leaving and nine players joining the program. This season was one to forget, as the Illini would ultimately miss the NCAA Tournament and lose in the second round of the NIT. In 2014, Groce continued Illinois' success in November, improving to 21–0 under Groce and 32–0 overall during the past four seasons. Illinois is the only program in the nation with an undefeated November record dating back to 2011.[6] The 2014–2015 season was once again disappointing for the Illini. Illinois finished with a record of 19–14, finishing tied for 7th place in the Big Ten with a record of 9–9. The Illini were then beaten in the first round of the NIT. The 2015–16 season ended with the fewest total wins in almost 20 years since the 98–99 Lon Kruger crew won only 14 games. Groce's squad finished with a record of 15–19, taking 12th place in the Big Ten and receiving no post-season tournament invitations. The 2016–17 season was another disappointing season for the Fighting Illini, as they finished the season at 18–14 and 8–10 in the conference, failing to make the NCAA Tournament for the fourth consecutive year. On March 11, 2017, the university announced via press release that Groce had been relieved of his duties as head men's basketball coach. The next day, the team was put into the NIT as a 2-seed. The team was coached during the NIT by interim coach Jamall Walker, making it to the quarterfinals before being eliminated by the University of Central Florida. On March 18, 2017, Brad Underwood was hired by athletic director Josh Whitman.[7] Underwood previously coached at Stephen F. Austin from 2013 to 2016, before spending one year at Oklahoma State. In Underwood's first season at Illinois, the team won each of their first five contests. After beginning conference play 0–8, they ended the season with a record of 14–18. While the 2018–19 season featured the debut of key pieces including Ayo Dosunmu, Giorgi Bezhanishvili, Andres Feliz, and Alan Griffin, the Illini posted one of the worst records in program history at 12–21 (7–13 in Big Ten). Despite the poor record, Illinois had many memorable moments such as upsetting #9 Michigan State at home and Bezhanishvili scoring 35 points against Rutgers, breaking the Illini record for most points by a freshman in a single game. The 2019–20 season was the freshman year of highly ranked center Kofi Cockburn. The Illini started the season slow in the first game, barely beating Nicholls State 78–70 in overtime. During the ACC–Big Ten Challenge, Illinois played Miami where they lost 81–79 after they mounted a huge comeback before a charge was called against Dosunmu on the game's final play. The next game they traveled to College Park to play against #3 Maryland. The Illini led by 14 at the half, but Maryland outscored Illinois 34–19 in the second half and won the game by an Anthony Cowan free throw. The Illini next played #5 Michigan at the State Farm Center. They would beat the Wolverines 71–62 to improve to 7–3 on the season. Over the next 12 games, the Illini went 10–2, including Dosunmu's game-winning shot during their second matchup against Michigan to give Illinois a 64–62 lead with half a second left on the clock. Illinois would finish the season with a 21–10 (13–7) record which would be good enough for 4th in the Big Ten. They would also finish ranked 21st in the AP Poll and 22nd in the Coaches Poll. The 2020–21 season that Underwood finally had mostly his recruits running the team and it certainly showed on the court. After much deliberation, Ayo Dosunmu returned to Illinois for his junior season instead of going to the NBA. He, along with Kofi Cockburn, helped make Illinois into a top-10 team. They went 16-4 (0.800) in the B1G conference but had a worse record than Michigan (14-3, 0.824), and therefore did not earn even a share of the title. This title was disputed as Michigan had failed to play three extra games because of COVID protocols, and only one loss in those three games would have given Illinois the title; Illinois had beaten Michigan by 23 without leading scorer Ayo Dosunmu in Ann Arbor. The team went on to win the Big Ten tournament title, however, after a hard-fought, overtime 91–88 win over OSU. Illinois became a #1 seed in the NCAA Tournament for the 4th time in school history. They were upset by Loyola-Chicago in the 2nd round and finished the season 24–7. Dosunmu became the first player in Illini history to earn 1st-team All-America honors by the AP. Cockburn was named to the AP All-American 2nd-team. Before the 2021–22 season, Ayo Dosunmu was drafted by the Chicago Bulls, and Adam Miller transferred to LSU, leading to André Curbelo being expected to serve as the primary ball handler. Unfortunately, Curbelo suffered a concussion prior to the season opener that would continue to affect him throughout the season. The team was led by fifth-year players Trent Frazier and Da'Monte Williams. Kofi Cockburn returned for his junior year but was suspended for the first three games for selling his team jerseys during the off-season. The team tied with Wisconsin for a share of the Big Ten regular season title, with a record of 15-5. Due to the tiebreaker rules, the team was seeded first in the Big Ten Tournament but lost its first game to ninth-seeded Indiana. The team was given the #4 seed in the South region of the NCAA tournament. After a 54-53 victory against Chattanooga, the team lost in the second round to Houston. Cockburn was named to the AP All-American 1st-team. The roster suffered from some major turnover before the 2022–23 season, with five players transferring out of the program, four players graduating, and Kofi Cockburn electing to stay in the NBA draft (and ultimately going undrafted). Three players transferred into the program and six freshmen were recruited. As a result of the roster changes, the team would be led by Terrence Shannon Jr. and Coleman Hawkins. The Illini would secure two major wins in non-conference play, beating #8 UCLA in the Continental Tire Main Event semifinal and #2 Texas in the Jimmy V Classic. Both Zacharie Perrin and Skyy Clark left the program during the season. Ultimately the season was a step back for the program, as due to tiebreaker rules, the team received a seven seed and lost to Penn State in their first game of the Big Ten Tournament. The team then received the #9 seed in the West region and lost in the first round of the NCAA Tournament to Arkansas. For the first time since Underwood's second season, the team finished the season unranked in the AP Poll. The 2023-24 season would be one to remember. Three pivotal graduate transfers, Marcus Domask, Quincy Guerrier, and Justin Harmon joined the team, with Domask and Guerrier starting most games. The Illini went on an undefeated trip to Spain and then beat #1 ranked Kansas in a televised exhibition game. The team lost only two games to non-NCAA tournament teams, once to Penn State and once to Maryland. After finishing second in the Big Ten standings, the team ultimately won the Big Ten Tournament, prevailing over Wisconsin. The team was selected to the NCAA tournament as the #3 seed in the East region. For the first time in Underwood's tenure, the team made the Sweet Sixteen, where it beat the #2 seed, Iowa State. For the first time since the 2004–05 season, the team made the Elite Eight, where it lost to #1-overall and eventual national champion UConn. Record Champion Bids † – Conference co-champions The NCAA began seeding the tournament with the 1979 edition. The NIT began seeding the tournament with the 2006 edition. Kenney Gym Annex is a 5,000-seat multi-purpose arena that is the practice facility for the Fighting Illini gymnastics team. Before the opening of Huff Hall in 1925, Kenney Gym housed the Illinois Fighting Illini men's basketball team. It also was home to the Women's Volleyball program from 1974 until 1989, after which the program moved to Huff Hall in 1990. Huff Hall is a 4,050-seat multi-purpose arena in Champaign, Illinois, United States. The arena opened in 1925 and was known as Huff Gymnasium until the 1990s. It is named after George Huff, the school's athletic director from 1895 to 1935. Huff Hall is home to the University of Illinois Fighting Illini volleyball and wrestling teams. Before the opening of Assembly Hall in 1963, it was home to the basketball team as well. Assembly Hall opened on March 2, 1963, and hosts the home games for the men's and women's basketball teams. Max Abramovitz, an Illinois alumnus, was the lead architect behind the building of the indoor arena. At the time of its opening, Assembly Hall could hold 16,128 people, making it the largest dome structure in North America until the Houston Astrodome opened in 1965. In 2008, school officials, led by athletic director Ron Guenther, conducted a study to decide whether to refurbish the Assembly Hall or build a new basketball arena. In 2010, they decided to keep the arena. In 2014, renovations began under the watch of AECOM, an architectural firm based out of Dallas Texas. The estimated cost of the project was estimated to be around $169.5 million and in turn State Farm Insurance decided to buy the naming rights of the stadium. The 2-story, 40,000-square-foot building is home to the University of Illinois Men's and Women's basketball programs. The facility includes offices, locker areas, weight training facilities and team meeting rooms in addition to the practice basketball courts. The Illinois Champions Campaign was a major catalyst of the $40 million renovation.[8] In November 2015, the arena hosted the team for five games while renovations to the State Farm Center were completed.[9] Illinois and Indiana's rivalry started because the teams share a state border and they are located about 153 miles (246 km) apart. They have played annually since 1906. Indiana currently leads the series 96–92. The teams have played each other in five top-ten matchups, the first coming in 1952 when 2nd-ranked Illinois beat 4th-ranked Indiana 78–66. The longest winning streak was when Indiana won nine consecutive matchups from 1972 to 1977. Illinois has had a total of 34 players who have claimed All-American status. † = Consensus All-American In 2004, during the celebration of the program's 100th year of basketball as a varsity sport, the University of Illinois Division of Intercollegiate Athletics announced its All-Century Team. The 20-man team was selected after online voting by fans and the Illinois Basketball Centennial Committee. The honorees were feted during the Illinois Basketball Centennial Reunion Weekend, Jan. 28–30, 2005.[24] † Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame inductee. ‡ National Collegiate Basketball Hall of Fame inductee. § Illinois Basketball Coaches Association Hall of Fame inductee.

The award was annually given to a male student-athlete until it was discontinued in 1973. Revived in 1983, the University of Illinois now recognizes both male and female athletes who have distinguished themselves in athletic achievement. In 1993, the awards were named in honor of former Olympian Dwight \"Dike\" Eddleman, who participated in basketball, football and track and field in 1943 and 1946–49, earning a combined 11 varsity letters during that timeframe.[77] The following list includes Illini basketball players who earned the award.

                "content": "The Illinois Fighting Illini (/ɪˈlaɪnaɪ/) are the intercollegiate athletic teams that represent the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign. The university offers 10 men's and 11 women's varsity sports. The university operates a number of athletic facilities, including Memorial Stadium for football, the State Farm Center for both men's and women's basketball, Illinois Field for baseball, the ARC Pool for women's swimming and diving, the Atkins Tennis Center for men's and women's tennis, Eichelberger Field for softball, Huff Hall for men's and women's gymnastics, women's volleyball and men's wrestling, Demirjian Park for women's soccer and for men's and women's outdoor track and field, the Atkins Golf Club at the University of Illinois for men's and women's golf, the University of Illinois Arboretum for cross country and the University of Illinois Armory for men's and women's indoor track and field. The Fighting Illini lay claim to over 25 National Championships dating back to 1900. The University of Illinois official team name is the Fighting Illini.[2] The Illiniwek, Illinois Confederation, or Illini, were made up of 12 to 13 tribes who lived in the Mississippi River Valley. The term \"Illini\", in relation to campus activities, appears to be first mentioned in January 1874, when the weekly newspaper changed its name from The Student to The Illini. An editorial in the first edition of the renamed newspaper indicated that Illini was a new term. During the late 19th century and beginning of the 20th century, it was used to refer to the students, faculty, staff, and alumni of the university, as well as to the campus as a whole. Many NCAA and High School mascots bearing reference to first nation people have changed their names. However, the University of Illinois maintains its position that the Illini nickname does not refer to the first nation inhabitants of the same land.[3] The term Illini referring to the university's athletic teams seems to come from secondhand accounts of the athletic teams. The earliest reference in the Illio yearbook appears to be one mention in the summary of the 1907 football season. The term was more widely used in the 1910s especially during the 1914, 1915, and 1916 football seasons. The Daily Illini and football programs prior to these dates do not extensively cite the term and also used the terms \"Indians\", \"our men\", \"Orange and Blue\", and the \"homecomers\".[3] The Illinois Confederation, also referred to as the Illiniwek or Illini, lived in the Mississippi River Valley and expanded their tribes in an area that stretched from Lake Michigan to Iowa, Illinois, Missouri, and Arkansas.[4] The term Fighting Illini first appeared in a January 29, 1911, newspaper article describing the basketball team's effort during a game versus Purdue. By March 3, 1911, the athletic teams appeared to have earned the Fighting Illini nickname as a formal appellation evidenced in a newspaper report. In 2005, evidence suggested Fighting Illini was first used in 1921 as part of a fundraising campaign for construction of Memorial Stadium, but articles discovered in 2013 show it was first used in 1911.[2] The Fighting Illini nickname was adopted by general consensus as an unofficial school nickname sometime between 1921 and 1930. It was then used in newspaper articles, football programs and other publications eventually becoming the official name.[2] Illinois has won 18 overall men's and women's NCAA team national championships through the 2017 NCAA athletic season.[5] Illinois ranks thirty-sixth all-time in total NCAA Division I national championships through the 2020–21 NCAA athletic season.[5] Fighting Illini baseball has 10 NCAA Tournament appearances, 33 Big Ten championships and 4 Big Ten Tournament championships in 1989, 1990, 2000 and 2011. Fighting Illini men's basketball titles include the 1915 Helms national championship, five NCAA Final Four appearances in 1949, 1951, 1952, 1989, 2005, 17 Big Ten championships and four Big Ten Tournament championships in 2003, 2005, 2021, and 2024. Through the end of the 2013–14 season, Illinois ranks 11th all-time in winning percentage and 14th all-time in wins among all NCAA Division I men's college basketball programs. Fighting Illini women's basketball began play in 1974. The team won the 1997 Big Ten championship. They have made 8 NCAA Tournament appearances, including 2 Sweet Sixteen appearances in 1997 and 1998. The men's cross country team were the Big Ten Champions in 1921, 1947 and 1984. The Fighting Illini women's cross country team began play in 1977. Illinois won an individual NCAA championship in 2009. The University of Illinois has been selected for national championship titles for their accomplishments in five seasons (1914, 1919, 1923, 1927, 1951) by NCAA-designated major selectors, often using mathematical algorithms.[6][7]: 111–113 Illinois claims championships for all five years.[8] The Fighting Illini program recognizes the 1951 co-national title selection by William F. Boand,[9] but as recently as 2006 this was not mentioned officially by the school.[10] The team also has 15 Big Ten Championship Football victories with 8 Bowl Game Victories at the 1947 Rose Bowl, 1952 Rose Bowl, 1964 Rose Bowl, 1990 Florida Citrus Bowl, 1994 Liberty Bowl, 1999 MicronPC.com Bowl, 2010 Texas Bowl, and 2011 Kraft Fight Hunger Bowl. The men's golf team play their home matches on the Atkins Golf Club at the University of Illinois five miles from the university's campus, and are currently led by head coach Mike Small. The Fighting Illini men's golf program has won 18 Big Ten championships and in 2013 finished as national runner-up at the NCAA Division I Men's Golf Championships, which was the highest finish in the program's history. 2014 was the third time in the past four years the program had qualified for the match play portion of the NCAA Men's Golf Championships in which the final eight teams compete in a bracket format.[11] The Fighting Illini women's golf team began play in 1975. The team has made four NCAA Tournament appearances in 2002, 2003, 2011 and 2012. The men's gymnastics team have been invited to 44 NCAA tournaments and have won 10 team NCAA championships, which is second most all-time only to Penn State Nittany Lions 12 team titles.

The team has four sweet sixteen appearances in 2004, 2006, 2008, 2013 and one elite eight appearance in 2004. The Illini are currently led by Janet Rayfield, who has been the head coach since 2002.[14] The Fighting Illini softball team began play in 2000. The team has made eight NCAA Tournament appearances in 2003, 2004, 2009, 2010, 2016, 2017, 2019, and 2022. The current head coach is Tyra Perry.

The Illinois men's tennis program was founded in 1908, but has enjoyed most of its success in recent years. The Illini have been one of the most successful men's tennis programs in the nation over the past twenty seasons, winning nine consecutive Big Ten Championships from 1997 to 2005; six of seven Big Ten Tournament Championships between 1999 and 2005; appearing in the NCAA Sweet Sixteen fourteen times, including eight years in a row (2002–09); advancing to three NCAA Final Fours between 2003 and 2007; and winning the 2003 NCAA National Championship. They have also won two ITA National Team Indoor Championships (2003, 2004)[15] and lost in the championship match three other times (1998, 1999, 2002). Illinois men's tennis owns the record for longest consecutive win streak in NCAA history at 64 matches, spanning from their first match of the 2002–03 season and ending with a 4–2 defeat by UCLA in the semifinals of the 2004 NCAA Men's Tennis Tournament.

Both the men's and women's boxing teams compete as part of the United States Intercollegiate Boxing Association. Illinois hosted the USIBA national championships in 2018, and the men's team won the 2018 and 2019 tournaments.[30][31] The women's team won the 2022 tournament.[32] The men's ice hockey team has played in the Division I Central States Collegiate Hockey League conference since 1979, which is part of the American Collegiate Hockey Association (ACHA), winning national championships in 2005 and 2008, with runner-up finishes in 2009 and 2018. A second team competes in the Division II Mid-American Collegiate Hockey Association. A feasibility study published in March 2018, and commissioned by the NHL, NHLPA, and College Hockey, Inc., found a high probability of success for the hockey program to transition to NCAA Division I.[33][34] Founded in 1963, the University of Illinois Men's Rugby Football Club plays in Division 1-A in the Big Ten Universities conference. The Illini have experienced success in college rugby, including winning several Big 10 championships in the 1980s and reaching the national semifinals in 1980, 1983 and 1985.[35][36] The Illini play their home matches in Urbana at the Complex Fields. The men's wheelchair basketball team was founded in 1948 by Timothy Nugent in response to a large number of disabled veterans using the G.I. Bill to attend the University of Illinois.[37] Nugent later started a women's team in 1970. A total of 29 national championships are claimed between the men and women's teams. Founded in 2005, Illini Rowing is one of the youngest university rowing teams in the country. They practice on Clinton Lake and in the ARC.[38] On Clinton Lake, they host the Illinois Collegiate Rowing Invitational where they race against many other midwestern universities.[39] They compete across the country in the American Collegiate Rowing Association.[40] The Marching Illini is the marching band of the university. The Marching Illini is an organization which annually includes approximately 350 students. Part of the College of Fine and Applied Arts and the School of Music, the Marching Illini represent virtually every college, discipline, and major on the university's diverse Urbana-Champaign campus. The band primarily performs before, during, and after University of Illinois home football games. The band also performs an indoor concert at the Krannert Center for the Performing Arts featuring special lighting effects, performances by individual sections, and slightly pithy comic routines. The Sousa Archives and Center for American Music houses a collection of University Band recordings and performances and recording sessions from 1940 to 1987.[41] The band has several traditions such as the Pregame Show, Three-In-One, Illinois Loyalty and Oskee Wow-Wow. Illinois Loyalty is the main school song of the university. It was first performed on March 3, 1906, and is one of the oldest songs of its kind in the United States. The song was written by Thacher Howland Guild, instructor in rhetoric and a member of the band's solo cornet section.[42] Due to the song's length, it is normally played only at the beginning, halftime, and end of football games. Oskee Wow-Wow is the official fight song of the University of Illinois.[43] Most commonly, it is played \"from the hold\" at the start of the chorus, when the \"O\" in \"Oskee Wow-Wow\" is held out. This version is played after first downs and touchdowns in football, and leading into time outs in basketball. Coincidentally, the buzzers at nearly every arena are in the same chord as the hold. For many years, the band started playing the song \"from the top\" toward the end of the warmup period in basketball. When conducted correctly, the \"hold\" is played just as the buzzer sounds. The Oskee Wow-Wow yell is a University of Illinois spirit yell originated in 1899. The yell was modified in 1912 and 1916.[43][44] The university has a number of notable alumni and administrators in the world of athletics. In football, notable Alumni include Dick Butkus, Red Grange, Jeff George, Simeon Rice, Ray Nitschke and George Halas. Famous basketball alumni include Dee Brown, Deron Williams, Luther Head, Derek Harper, Nick Anderson, Chuck Carney, Brian Cook, Kendall Gill, Steve Bardo, Jerry Colangelo, and Johnny Orr. Notable athletes in baseball include Lou Boudreau,[45] Hoot Evers[46] and Ken Holtzman. The university has also a number of Olympic athletes that include George Kerr, Don Laz, Daniel Kinsey, Harold Osborn, Bob Richards, and Justin Spring, From 1926 to 2007, Chief Illiniwek was the symbol for the Fighting Illini. Chief Illiniwek was a Native American symbol portrayed by a white student.[47] Chief Illiniwek symbolized the Illini, a confederation of indigenous tribes who historically had inhabited much of present-day Illinois; however the clothing and regalia for the symbol was from the Sioux nation. Chief Illiniwek would perform during halftime at Illinois football and basketball games, wearing a feathered headdress and buckskin clothes, and dancing while the marching band played \"Three in One\", an arrangement of three original songs. It was customary for Illinois fans and attendees to raise their arms at the end of the halftime proceedings and, in unison, yell \"chief\". In 2005, the Chief was one of 18 mascots (though Illiniwek was considered a symbol and not a mascot) cited as \"hostile or abusive\" by the NCAA in a policy that banned schools from full participation in postseason activities as long as they continued to use such mascots.[48] The University of Illinois retired Chief Illiniwek in 2007. Debate about the Chief has continued to this day.[49][50] The university chancellor appointed a Commission on Native Imagery to recommend ways \"to provide closure, healing and reconciliation... to facilitate the establishment of new traditions... [and] to honor and partner with the Native Nations for whom Illinois is their ancestral home.\"[51] The Fighting Illini are one of three Big Ten programs that do not have a mascot. (The other two are the Wolverines and the Hoosiers.)[52] In the 2020 student elections, the student body voted 4222 to 3597 for a preliminary proposal to adopt a new mascot, the belted kingfisher. The female belted kingfisher, which is \"naturally true to the orange and blue,\" would be the first female mascot in the Big Ten—and Illinois' first mascot.[53] The referendum was downplayed by the university administration, which stated that the \"results will be shared with the university administration and the board of trustees but will not result in a new mascot at this time.\"[54] After the student referendum, the University Senate voted 105–2 in an advisory vote to endorse the belted kingfisher as the new [in fact, the first] mascot.[55]",

                "content": "Terry Alan Crews[2] (born July 30, 1968) is an American actor, television host, and former football player. He played Julius Rock in the UPN/CW sitcom Everybody Hates Chris, which aired from 2005 to 2009, and portrayed Terry Jeffords in the Fox and NBC sitcom Brooklyn Nine-Nine (2013–2021). Crews starred in the BET reality series The Family Crews (2010–2011), and hosted the U.S. version of the game show Who Wants to Be a Millionaire from 2014 to 2015. He has appeared in films, including Friday After Next (2002), White Chicks (2004), Idiocracy (2006), Blended (2014), The Expendables film series (2010–2014), and Rumble (2021). Crews began hosting America's Got Talent in 2019, following his involvement in the same role for the program's spin-off series America's Got Talent: The Champions. He also had a brief wrestling career Crews played as a defensive end and linebacker in the National Football League (NFL) for the Los Angeles Rams, San Diego Chargers, and Washington Redskins, as well as in the World League of American Football (WLAF) for the Rhein Fire and college football at Western Michigan University. A public advocate for women's rights and activist against sexism, Crews has shared stories of the abuse his family endured at the hands of his violent father, and was also included among the group of people named as Time Person of the Year in 2017 for going public with stories of sexual assault during the MeToo movement.[3] Crews was born on July 30, 1968[4] in Flint, Michigan; he is the son of Patricia Ann (née Simpson) and Terry Crews.[1][5] The middle child of three,[6] he grew up in a strict Christian household in Flint and was raised mainly by his mother, who was 18 when he was born.[5] His father was an alcoholic and abusive to his mother.[3][7] Crews received a flute from his great aunt, and took lessons for eight years.[8] He spent a summer at Interlochen Arts Academy and entered Western Michigan University in Kalamazoo on an art scholarship. After his freshman year, he tried out for the football team and earned a full athletic scholarship.[6] Crews was drafted by the Los Angeles Rams in the 11th round of the 1991 NFL draft.[10] His career included stints with the Rams (six games), the Green Bay Packers[11] (no games), the San Diego Chargers (10 games), the Washington Redskins (16 games), and the Philadelphia Eagles (no games). He also played for the Rhein Fire of the World League of American Football (later NFL Europe) during its 1995 season.[12] Repeatedly cut from rosters, Crews often supplemented his football income by receiving portrait commissions from teammates.[13] After retiring from the NFL in 1997, Crews moved to Los Angeles to pursue an acting career. He had a long-standing ambition to work in the film industry, but up until then had no plans to pursue acting, and simply wanting to be involved in some way. A year earlier, he co-wrote and co-produced the independent feature film Young Boys Incorporated. A self-funded production filmed in Detroit with an anti-drug message, the film drew on his own observations, as well as those of his friends and family. Despite describing it as a \"horrible\" film, he credits the experience with getting him interested in the film industry.[14] In 1999, Crews auditioned for a role as a character athlete (known as Warriors) in the syndicated game show Battle Dome, which became his first acting part. He played T-Money for two seasons until its cancellation in 2001. The audition process and the opportunity to perform in front of an audience made him realize that he wanted to pursue acting as a career. However, he failed to land another acting job for the following two years.[15] Appearances in commercials for products such as Old Spice, films, and music videos soon followed.[14] His breakout role came in Friday After Next starring rapper-turned-actor Ice Cube, for whom Crews previously worked as on-set security.[16][17] Having never taken acting classes, instead he asked himself what the audience wanted, and he believes this ultimately brought him success. He now believes acting is what he was born to do and would not wish to have any other career, despite the physically demanding nature of the work.[14] Based on his performance in White Chicks (2004), Adam Sandler changed a role in The Longest Yard (2005) to give it to Crews, who auditioned for another role in the film.[14] His role as Julius Rock, the father on the UPN/CW sitcom Everybody Hates Chris, brought Crews wider public recognition, and the series aired for four seasons from 2005 to 2009.[17] Since then, Crews has had main roles as husband and father Nick Kingston-Persons in the TBS sitcom Are We There Yet?, which aired for three seasons from 2010, and as NYPD Sergeant (and commencing in Season 7, Lieutenant) Terry Jeffords in the Fox/NBC ensemble sitcom Brooklyn Nine-Nine, which premiered in 2013.[18] Crews has appeared mainly in comedic roles, such as President Camacho in Idiocracy, but he later found success in action roles beginning with his part as Hale Caesar in The Expendables series, which saw him make his first appearance in a film sequel. Although he has managed to sustain an athletic physique in his career as an actor, Crews has avoided being type-cast as a muscle-bound action hero and has attained critical success through exploiting the contrast of his elaborate character comedy with his physique, which extends to the point of even mocking the stereotype of the gym-obsessed bodybuilder. This contrast has also led to sustained work as part of various humorous Old Spice TV commercials.[16][19][20] He has lent his voice to animations such as American Dad! and Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs 2. He found that he enjoyed the work and sought out more of it, finding satisfaction in how it carries his spirit into the animation.[17] From 2010 to 2011, Crews starred in his own reality series on BET, The Family Crews. It ran for two seasons. From 2014 to 2015, he hosted the syndicated game show Who Wants to Be a Millionaire. He has also been the American host of Netflix's Ultimate Beastmaster. For eight seasons he played Terry Jeffords on Brooklyn Nine-Nine. In June 2020, Crews stated in an interview with Access Daily that four planned episodes for Season 8 had been aborted following the George Floyd protests, as the murder of George Floyd prompted the producers to reassess the direction of the season's storyline.[21][22] The series was not renewed for a ninth season. In early 2021, Crews commented: \"I'm sad it will end, but happy to have had the chance to be a part of something so special\".[23] Crews cites the many similarities between acting and professional football, including the structure and expectations, as helping his transition between the two careers. He credits Reginald Hubbard with mentoring him in his early career in the film business.[14] In June 2017, he was cast in the science fiction comedy film Sorry to Bother You.[24] The film was released in theaters on July 6, 2018.[25] Also in 2018, he appeared as Bedlam in the superhero film Deadpool 2.[26] Crews made appearances in the music videos for \"Pressure\" and \"Algorithm\" by British rock band Muse.[27][28] Crews also starred in the video for Brittany Howard's 2019 song \"Stay High\" in which he lip-syncs the vocals.[29] Crews's first job in the arts was as a courtroom sketch artist in Flint, Michigan. He received an art scholarship from college before an athletic scholarship.[13] He later worked as courtroom sketch artist for WJRT. During his football career, Crews supplemented his income by creating portraits of fellow players. At times it was the primary income on which his family depended, typically bringing $5,000 for a two-month commission.[30] His work included a series of NFL-licensed lithographs.[14] He believes his imaginative side has transferred itself to his acting work.[14] Crews and fashion designer Nana Boateng founded a design company called Amen & Amen.[31][32] Their first collection was a set of furniture and light fixtures by the designer and artist Ini Archibong.[33][34] In 2017 Crews designed a collection of furniture for Bernhardt Design which was shown at the International Contemporary Furniture Fair (ICFF) in New York.[35][36] In 2021, announced that Amen & Amen had entered the film production sector as a \"virtual production studio\" based in Pasadena, California.[37] In 2021 Crews and his wife Rebecca King wrote a memoir titled Together: How Fame, Failure and Faith Transformed Our Lives.[38] He has written several other books including Tough: My Journey to True Power.[39] He has also written and illustrated children's books including Terry's Crew, and with Ken Harvey, Come Find Me, a story about the adventures of two brothers, Anthony and Marcus, who are based on Crews' sons.[40] Together with Unnar Helgi Danielsson, Dylan Sprouse and Hafþór Júlíus Björnsson, Crews is a co-founder and brand ambassador of Thor's Skyr, an American-made high-protein cultured dairy product based on a traditional Icelandic recipe, which is high in probiotics and low in sugar.[41][42] On March 10, 2021, Crews announced the Ethereum-based cryptocurrency $POWER.[43] Crews is a devout Christian.[44][45] He met Rebecca King when he was a college sophomore; she was the music minister at a local church.[6] They married on July 29, 1989.[46] They have four daughters and a son, Isaiah Crews, also an actor, and one grandchild.[6][47] In 2014, Crews released his autobiography, Manhood: How to Be a Better Man or Just Live with One.[48] In the book, Crews detailed his long-standing pornography addiction, which had seriously affected his marriage and his life, but which he overcame around 2009 and 2010 after entering rehabilitation. Since then he has taken an active role in speaking out about the condition and its impact, including posting on Facebook in his Dirty Little Secret Series.[49][50][51][52] Crews is very keen on personal development and his favorite book is The Master Key System by Charles F. Haanel: \"I have read hundreds of personal development books, but this is the one that clearly showed me how to visualize, contemplate, and focus on what I truly wanted. It revealed to me that we only get what we desire most, and to apply myself with a laserlike focus upon a goal, task or project. That in order to 'have', you must 'do', and in order to 'do', you must 'be' – and this process is immediate. [...] I also reread it probably once a month to keep my vision clear\".[53] On an interview with Rotten Tomatoes in 2020, Crews listed his five favorite films as Do the Right Thing, Star Wars, Aliens, Training Day and Pulp Fiction.[54] On October 10, 2017, in the wake of numerous Hollywood actresses going public with their stories of sexual harassment and assault by film producer Harvey Weinstein, Crews revealed that a male Hollywood executive groped him at a party in 2016, but he did not report the incident for fear of retaliation.[55][56] It was later revealed that the \"high-level executive\" was Adam Venit, head of the motion picture department of the talent company William Morris Endeavor (WME).[57] For his part in coming forward with the sexual assault allegations, Crews was named as one of the \"Silence Breakers\" from the Time Person of the Year award in 2017.[58] WME reportedly concluded from an investigation that the incident was isolated. Venit was demoted and returned to work after a one-month suspension. In response, Crews stated, \"Someone got a pass\".[59] Crews filed a lawsuit against Venit and WME for sexual assault.[60] Some witnesses stated that Venit had gotten intoxicated, dismissed the groping as \"horseplay\", and apologized to Crews the next day. WME responded to the lawsuit, arguing that their reaction to Crews' claims was \"both swift and serious\".[61] In March 2018, prosecutors decided not to file any charges against Venit. The city attorney's office announced that the statute of limitations to prosecute Venit had expired, as the alleged incident was in February 2016 and Crews did not report it until November 2017.[62] After Crews said that producer Avi Lerner attempted to silence him on the assault in order to retain his role in The Expendables film series, Crews vowed not to appear in any further installments of the franchise.[63]",

                "content": "Defunct Newspapers Journals TV channels Websites Other Economics Gun rights Identity politics Nativist Religion Watchdog groups Youth/student groups Miscellaneous Other Clarence Thomas (born June 23, 1948) is an American lawyer and jurist who has served since 1991 as an associate justice of the Supreme Court of the United States. President George H. W. Bush nominated him to succeed Thurgood Marshall. After Marshall, Thomas is the second African American to serve on the U.S. Supreme Court and has been its longest-serving member since Anthony Kennedy's retirement in 2018. He has also been the Court's oldest member since Stephen Breyer retired in 2022. Thomas was born in Pin Point, Georgia. After his father abandoned the family, he was raised by his grandfather in a poor Gullah community near Savannah, Georgia. Growing up as a devout Catholic, Thomas originally intended to be a priest in the Catholic Church, but he was frustrated by what he saw as the church's insufficient attempts to combat racism. He abandoned his aspiration of becoming a clergyman and graduated from the College of the Holy Cross and Yale Law School, where he was influenced by a number of conservative authors, especially Thomas Sowell. Upon graduating, he was appointed as an assistant attorney general in Missouri and later entered private practice there. He became a legislative assistant to U.S. Senator John Danforth in 1979, and was made Assistant Secretary for Civil Rights at the U.S. Department of Education in 1981. President Ronald Reagan appointed Thomas as Chairman of the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) the next year. President George H. W. Bush nominated Thomas to the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit in 1990. He served in that role for 19 months before filling Marshall's seat on the Supreme Court. Thomas's confirmation hearings were bitter and intensely fought, centering on an accusation that he had sexually harassed Anita Hill, a subordinate at the Department of Education and the EEOC.[5] The Senate confirmed Thomas by a vote of 52–48, the narrowest margin in a century.[6] Since the death of Antonin Scalia, Thomas has been the Court's foremost originalist, stressing the original meaning in interpreting the U.S. Constitution.[7] In contrast to Scalia—who had been the only other consistent originalist—he pursues a more classically liberal variety of originalism.[8] Until 2020, Thomas was known for his silence during most oral arguments,[9] though has since begun asking more questions to counsel.[10] He is notable for his majority opinions in Good News Club v. Milford Central School (determining the freedom of religious speech in relation to the First Amendment to the U.S. Constitution) and New York State Rifle & Pistol Association, Inc. v. Bruen (affirming the individual right to bear arms outside the home), as well as his dissent in Gonzales v. Raich (arguing that the U.S. Congress may not criminalize the private cultivation of medical cannabis). He is widely considered to be the Court's most conservative member. Thomas was born on June 23, 1948, in his parents' wooden shack in Pin Point, Georgia.[11][12] Pin Point was a small community near Savannah founded by freedmen in the 1880s.[13] He was the second of three children of M.C. Thomas, a farm worker, and Leola Williams.[11] Williams had been born out of wedlock; after her mother's death, she was sent from Liberty County, Georgia, to live with an aunt in Pin Point.[14][15][16] The family were descendants of enslaved people and spoke Gullah as a first language.[17] Thomas's earliest known ancestors were slaves named Sandy and Peggy, who were born in the late 18th century and owned by wealthy planter Josiah Wilson of Liberty County.[18] Thomas's older sister, Emma, was born in 1946, and his younger brother, Myers, in 1949.[19] Upon becoming pregnant with Thomas's older sister, Leola was expelled from her Baptist church and dropped out of high school after the 10th grade; her father ordered her to marry M.C. in January 1947. After three years of marriage, M.C. sued for divorce, claiming that Leola neglected the children, and a judge granted the request in March 1951.[19] After the divorce, M.C. moved to Savannah and later Pennsylvania, visiting his children only once. Leola went to work as a maid in Savannah during the week and returned to Pin Point on the weekends. Custody of the children was awarded to Leola's aunt.[20][21] When her aunt's house burned down in 1955, Leola took her children to live with her in the room she rented in a tenement with an outdoor toilet in Savannah, leaving her daughter with the aunt in Pin Point. She asked her father, Myers Anderson, for help. He initially refused but agreed after his wife threatened to throw him out.[22][23] Thomas and his brother went to live with Anderson, his maternal grandfather, in 1955 and experienced amenities such as indoor plumbing and regular meals for the first time.[24] Despite having little formal education, Anderson had built a successful business delivering coal, oil, and ice.[22] When racial unrest led to widespread protest and marches in Savannah from 1960 to 1963, Anderson used his wealth to bail out demonstrators and took his grandchildren to meetings promoted by the NAACP.[25] Thomas has described his grandfather as the person who has influenced his life the most.[26] Anderson converted to Catholicism and sent Thomas to be educated at a series of Catholic schools. Thomas attended the predominantly black St. Pius X High School in Chatham County[27] for two years before transferring to St. John Vianney's Minor Seminary on the Isle of Hope, where he was the segregated boarding school's first black student.[28][29] Though he experienced hazing, he performed well academically.[15] He spent many hours at the Carnegie Library, the only library for Blacks in Savannah before libraries were desegregated in 1961.[30][31][a] When Thomas was ten years old, Anderson began putting his grandsons to work during the summers, helping him build a house on a plot of farmland he owned, building fences, and doing farm work.[33] He believed in hard work and self-reliance,[34] never showed his grandsons affection,[33] beat them frequently according to Leola, and impressed the importance of a good education on them.[35] Anderson taught Thomas that \"all of our rights as human beings came from God, not man\", and that racial segregation was a violation of divine law.[36] During his freshman year from 1967 to 1968, Thomas attended Conception Seminary College, a Benedictine seminary in Missouri, with the intent to become a priest; no one in Thomas's family had attended college before.[37][28] After Martin Luther King Jr.'s assassination, he overheard a fellow student say, \"Good. I hope the son of a bitch dies\" and \"[t]hat's what they should do to all the niggers\".[38][39][40] The display of racism moved Thomas to leave the seminary.[41] He thought the church did not do enough to combat racism and resolved to abandon the priesthood.[42][38] He left at the end of the semester.[38] At a nun's suggestion, Thomas enrolled at the College of the Holy Cross, an elite Catholic college in Massachusetts, as a sophomore transfer student on a full academic scholarship.[43][44] He was one of the college's first black students, being one of twenty recruited by President John E. Brooks in 1968 in a group that also included the future attorney Ted Wells, the running back Eddie Jenkins Jr., and the novelist Edward P. Jones.[45] In the fall of that year, Thomas and other black students founded the college's Black Student Union (BSU), which became an important part of their campus identity.[46] Without financial support from his grandfather, he defrayed his expenses by working as a waiter and dishwasher in the college's dining hall.[47] Thomas later recalled, \"I was 19. My only hope was Holy Cross College\".[48] Professors at Holy Cross remembered Thomas as a determined, diligent student.[49] He kept to a strict routine of studying alone and stayed back during holidays to continue working.[50] Thomas C. Lawler, an English professor at Holy Cross,[51] recalled him as having \"never talked very much in class. He was the kind of person you really might not notice\".[49] By contrast, he was outspoken at BSU meetings, distinguishing himself as a contrarian who often feuded with Ted Wells. The future running back Ed Jenkins, a BSU member, said Thomas \"could turn on a dime and reduce you to intellectual rubble\".[52][53] Edward P. Jones, who lived across from Thomas as a sophomore, reflected that \"there was a fierce determination I sensed from him [Thomas], that he was going to get as much as he could and get as far, ultimately, as he could\".[54] Thomas became a vocal student activist as an undergraduate. He became acquainted with black separatism, the black Muslim Movement, the black power movement, and displayed a poster of Malcolm X in his dormitory room.[56] When some black students were disproportionately punished in comparison with white students for the same violation, he suggested a walkout in protest. The BSU adopted his idea, and Thomas, along with sixty other black students, departed campus.[57][58] Some of the priests negotiated with the protesting black students to reenter the school.[28] When administrators granted amnesty to all protesters, Thomas returned to the college, later also to attend anti-war marches. In April 1970, he participated in the violent 1970 Harvard Square riots.[59] He has credited his protests for his turn toward conservatism and subsequent disillusionment with leftist movements.[60][61][54] Having struggled with English as a native speaker of Gullah, Thomas chose to major in English literature.[62][63] He became a member of Alpha Sigma Nu, the Jesuit honor society, and the Purple Key Society, of which he was the only black member.[64] The college's focus on a liberal arts education introduced him to the writings of black intellectuals such as Richard Wright, whose literary works Thomas sympathized with.[56] His admiration of Malcolm X led him to read The Autobiography of Malcolm X to the point of wearing down the pages of his copy.[65] Thomas graduated from Holy Cross on June 4, 1971, with a Bachelor of Arts, cum laude, ranked ninth in his class.[66] He applied to and was accepted by Yale Law School, Harvard Law School, and the University of Pennsylvania Law School.[67][68] That same year, Thomas matriculated at Yale Law School as one of twelve black students.[69] Yale offered him the best financial aid package, and he was attracted to the civil rights activism of some of its faculty members.[70][71] Finding it difficult to keep up with the school's expectations, he struggled to connect with other students who came from upper-class backgrounds. He enrolled in Yale's most difficult courses and became a student of the property law scholar Quintin Johnstone, who became his favorite professor.[72][73] Johnstone remembered Thomas as having \"performed very well\".[74] Guido Calabresi, the dean of Yale Law School, described Thomas and fellow student Hillary Clinton as \"both excellent students [who] had the same kind of reputation\".[74] Thomas obtained his Juris Doctor on May 20, 1974.[75] After graduation, he sought to enter private practice as a corporate lawyer in Atlanta, Georgia.[76] He saw his experience in law school as disappointing, as law firms assumed he was accepted because of affirmative action.[77] According to Thomas, the law firms also \"asked pointed questions, unsubtly suggesting that they doubted I was as smart as my grades indicated\".[78] In his 2007 memoir, he wrote: \"I peeled a fifteen-cent sticker off a package of cigars and stuck it on the frame of my law degree to remind myself of the mistake I'd made by going to Yale. I never did change my mind about its value.\"[79] Hill, Jones, and Farrington, the Savannah law firm where Thomas had interned the previous summer, offered him a job upon graduation, but he declined.[80][81] With no job offers from major law firms, Thomas took a position as an associate with Missouri attorney general John Danforth, who offered him the prospect of practicing what he liked.[82] Thomas moved to Saint Louis to study for the Missouri bar, and was admitted on September 13, 1974.[83] He remained financially destitute even after leaving Yale, trying unsuccessfully on one occasion to make money by selling his blood at a blood bank, and hoped that by working for Danforth he might later acquire a job in private practice.[84][85] From 1974 to 1977, Thomas was an assistant attorney general of Missouri—the only African-American member of Danforth's staff. He worked first in the office's criminal appeals division and later in the revenue and taxation division. Thomas conducted lawsuits independently, gaining a reputation as a fair but controversial prosecutor.[86] Years later, after he joined the Supreme Court, Thomas recalled his position in Missouri as \"the best job I've ever had\".[87] When Danforth was elected to the U.S. Senate in 1976, Thomas left to become an attorney in Monsanto's legal department in Saint Louis.[88] He found the job unsatisfying, so left to rejoin Danforth in Washington, D.C., as a legislative assistant.[89] From 1979 to 1981, he handled energy issues for the Senate Commerce Committee. Thomas, who had switched his party affiliation from Democratic to Republican while working for Danforth in Missouri,[90] soon drew the attention of officials in the newly elected Reagan Administration as a black conservative.[90][91] Pendleton James, Reagan's personnel director, offered Thomas the position of assistant secretary for civil rights at the U.S. Department of Education. Initially reluctant, Thomas agreed after Danforth and others pressed him to take the post.[92] President Ronald Reagan nominated Thomas as assistant secretary of education for the Office for Civil Rights (OCR) on May 1, 1981.[93][94] The Senate received the nomination on May 28, 1981, and Thomas was quickly confirmed before the Senate Labor and Human Resources Committee on June 19, succeeding Cynthia Brown at the age of 32.[95][96] He held the position for a brief period before James offered him a new position as chairman of the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC), a promotion that Thomas believed, as with his position in the OCR, was because of his race.[97] After James consulted the President, Thomas hesitantly took up the chair with Reagan's approval.[98] Thomas chaired the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) from 1982 to 1990. As chairman, he was tasked with enforcing the Civil Rights Act of 1964 in an agency that had been mutually resented by both Democrats and Republicans. He announced a reorganization of the EEOC and upgraded its record-keeping under an uncompromising leadership that eschewed racial quotas.[97][99] Concerned by the EEOC's limited statutory authority, Thomas sought to impose criminal penalties for employers who practiced employment discrimination, moving to shift funding towards agency investigators. Though he had been critical of affirmative action, Thomas also opposed the Reagan Administration's agenda to remove affirmative action policies, believing it to be a detraction from socioeconomic issues.[100][90] During Thomas's tenure, he was credited with improving the efficiency of the EEOC.[101] Settlement award amounts to victims of discrimination tripled, while the number of suits filed decreased. The EEOC's lack of the use of goals and timetables drew criticism from civil rights advocates, who lobbied representatives to review the EEOC's practices; Thomas testified before Congress more than 50 times. Near the end of his final term, the EEOC came under congressional scrutiny for the mishandling of age-discrimination cases.[102][103] In early 1989, President George H. W. Bush expressed interest in nominating Thomas to a federal judgeship. Thomas, now at age 41, initially rejected the position, believing himself unready to make a lifetime commitment to being a judge. White House Counsel C. Boyden Gray and White House Chief of Staff John H. Sununu advocated for his nomination, and Judge Laurence Silberman advised Thomas to accept an appointment.[104] Anticipating Thomas's nomination, a liberal coalition—including the Alliance for Justice and the National Organization for Women (NOW)—emerged to oppose his candidacy.[105] On October 30, 1989, President George H. W. Bush nominated Thomas to the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit to fill the seat vacated by Robert Bork.[106][107] Thomas gained the support of other African American officials, including former transportation secretary William Coleman, and said that when meeting white Democratic staffers in the United States Senate, he was \"struck by how easy it had become for sanctimonious whites to accuse a black man of not caring about civil rights\".[65] In February 1990, the Senate Judiciary Committee recommended Thomas by a vote of 12 to 1. On March 6, 1990, the Senate confirmed him to the Court of Appeals by a vote of 98 to 2.[105] He developed cordial relationships during his 19 months on the federal court, including with Judge Ruth Bader Ginsburg.[65] During his judgeship, Thomas authored 19 opinions.[108] When Justice William Brennan retired from the Supreme Court in July 1990, Thomas was Bush's favorite among the five candidates on his shortlist for the position. However, Bush's advisors, including Attorney General Dick Thornburgh, considered Thomas inexperienced,[111] and he instead nominated David Souter of the First Circuit Court of Appeals.[65] A year later, Justice Thurgood Marshall announced his retirement on June 27, 1991, and Bush nominated Thomas to replace him.[112][113] Bush announced his selection on July 1, calling Thomas the \"best qualified at this time\".[65] Thornburgh cautioned Bush that replacing Marshall with any candidate who was not perceived to share Marshall's views would make confirmation difficult.[114] Liberal interest groups sought to challenge Thomas's nomination by paralleling the same strategy used against Robert Bork's confirmation.[115] Abortion-rights groups, including the National Abortion Rights Action League and the NOW, were concerned that Thomas would be among those to overrule Roe v. Wade.[116] Republican officials in turn emphasized his personal history and gathered support from African American interest groups, including the NAACP.[117] Other civil rights organizations, such as the Southern Christian Leadership Conference and the National Urban League, were convinced not to oppose Thomas, believing that he was Bush's last black nominee. On July 31, 1991, the board of directors of the NAACP voted against endorsing Thomas, announcing their opposition to his confirmation the same day.[118] The American Bar Association (ABA) appraised Thomas as \"qualified\" for the Supreme Court.[119][b] The result came in contrast to the \"well qualified\" rating some nominees had received previously.[121][122] The Bush Administration anticipated that the organization would rate Thomas more poorly than it thought he deserved, so pressured the ABA for at least the mid-level qualified rating while simultaneously discrediting it as partisan.[123] Opponents of Thomas's nomination saw the assessment as indicating that he was unfit for the Court.[124] The ABA gave Thomas its highest rankings in integrity and judicial temperament and a middle-grade in professional competence.[125] On September 10, 1991, formal confirmation hearings began before the Senate Judiciary Committee.[126][127] Thomas testified for 25 hours, the second-longest of any Supreme Court nominee.[128] He was reticent when answering senators' questions, recalling what had happened to Robert Bork when Bork expounded on his judicial philosophy during his confirmation hearings four years earlier.[129] As many of his earlier writings frequently referenced natural law, his views on the legal theory became a focus of the hearings. Thomas said he regarded natural law as a \"philosophical background\" to the Constitution.[130][131][132] Ninety witnesses testified in favor of or against Thomas.[133][citation needed] A motion on September 27, 1991, to give the nomination a favorable recommendation failed 7–7, and the Judiciary Committee voted 13–1 to send it to the full Senate without recommendation.[134][135][136] At the conclusion of the committee's confirmation hearings, the Senate was debating whether to give final approval to Thomas's nomination. An FBI interview with Anita Hill, a former colleague of Thomas at the EEOC, was soon leaked to the press and allegations of sexual harassment followed.[137][138] As a result, on October 8, the final vote was postponed, and the confirmation hearings were reopened. It was only the third time in the Senate's history that such an action was taken and the first since 1925, when Justice Harlan F. Stone's nomination was recommitted to the Judiciary Committee.[136] Hill was raised in Oklahoma and, like Thomas, graduated from Yale Law School.[139] She told James Brudney, a fellow Yale alumnus, about alleged sexual advances Thomas had made, telling him that she also did not wish to testify or make the allegations public to the Senate Judiciary Committee. Hill requested to the staff of Senator Joe Biden, the chair of the committee, that her allegations be made anonymously if she chose to testify and that Thomas not be informed of them, which Biden declined. Hill then notified Democratic staffers the day after the hearings had ended that she wished to make her allegations known to the committee.[140] Hill's allegations were corroborated by Susan Hoerchner, a judge in California, who also wished to remain anonymous.[141][142] Hoerchner called Harriet Grant, a chief counsel to Biden, to inform him of her allegations. She recalled that Thomas told Hill in an elevator at the EEOC that he would ruin her career if she spoke about his behavior.[143] When Grant told Hill and Hoerchner that the FBI would be involved, they were reluctant to be investigated. Hill declined to speak with the FBI, as she feared it would misconstrue her words, so instead arranged to deliver a written statement. The statement described how Thomas pressured her to date him, and included descriptions of him speaking about sexual interests involving pornographic films.[144] Hill also alleged that Thomas spoke of sex at work despite her being uncomfortable with the subject, adding, \"I sensed that my discomfort with his discussions only urged him on, as though my reaction of feeling ill at ease and vulnerable was what he wanted\".[145] The FBI report of its investigation was not made public. The White House announced that the FBI had found the allegations \"without foundation\". Congressional officials who had seen the report told the New York Times that \"the bureau could not draw any conclusion because of the 'he said, she said' nature of the subject\".[146][147] The use of the FBI was contentious in the Judiciary Committee because it answers to the president, who was sponsoring Thomas. Biden used the FBI instead of the committee's investigators to avoid the appearance of partisanship.[148] The hearings reconvened on October 11, 1991, with Thomas going first. In his opening statement, he denied that he had said or done anything to Hill \"that could have been mistaken for sexual harassment\". He told the Committee that he would not allow any questions about \"what goes on in the most intimate parts of my private life or the sanctity of my bedroom\" so as not to \"provide the rope for my own lynching\".[149] The committee then questioned Hill for seven hours. She testified that ten years earlier Thomas had subjected her to comments of a sexual nature, calling it \"behavior that is unbefitting an individual who will be a member of the Court\".[150][151][152] Her testimony included graphic details, and some senators questioned her aggressively.[153][154] Hill accused Thomas of making two sexually offensive remarks to her: comparing his penis to that of Long Dong Silver, a black porn star, and saying he had discovered a pubic hair on his Coca-Cola can.[155][156] And from my standpoint as a black American, as far as I'm concerned, [this proceeding] is a high-tech lynching for uppity blacks that in any way deign to think for themselves, to do for themselves, to have different ideas, and it is a message that unless you kowtow to the old order, this is what will happen to you. You will be lynched, destroyed, caricatured by a committee of the United States Senate rather than hung from a tree. In the evening, Thomas was recalled before the committee. He again denied the allegations and was prompted by Senator Orrin Hatch's questioning to launch a speech that criticized the proceeding as a \"high-tech lynching for uppity blacks\".[158] The speech resonated with Southern blacks and stimulated Thomas's supporters,[159] with public opinion shifting in his favor afterward.[160][161] Hill was the only person to publicly testify that Thomas had sexually harassed her.[162] Angela Wright, who worked under Thomas at the EEOC and had alleged that \"Thomas had continually pressured her to date him and made sexual comments about women's bodies\",[163][164] and a corroborating witness she had named were not called to testify.[163] Their written depositions were entered into the congressional records unrebutted.[165][166][167] Sukari Hardnett, a former Thomas assistant, wrote to the Senate committee that although Thomas had not harassed her, \"If you were young, black, female and reasonably attractive, you knew full well you were being inspected and auditioned as a female.\"[168][169] In addition to Hill and Thomas, the committee heard other witnesses.[136] A former colleague, Nancy Altman, testified that for two years she had shared an office with Thomas at the Department of Education and \"heard virtually every conversation\" Thomas had and never heard him make a sexist or offensive comment.[170][non-primary sources needed] On October 13, Hill voluntarily took and passed a polygraph test, which her lawyer took as proof that she had been truthful about the harassment claims, even if the test was not admissible as evidence in court. Danforth's office then issued a statement saying that persons suffering from a delusional disorder might pass a lie detector test.[171][172][173][174] After the confirmation hearings ended, they became a focus of divided scholarship, with authors who revisited them reaching varying conclusions in favor of either Thomas or Hill.[161] On October 15, 1991, the Senate voted to confirm Thomas as an associate justice, 52–48.[136] Thomas received the votes of 41 Republicans and 11 Democrats, while 46 Democrats and two Republicans voted to reject his nomination.[175] As of 2024[update], Thomas is the most recent Supreme Court justice to be confirmed by a Senate controlled by the opposing party of the appointing president. The 99 days during which Thomas's nomination was pending in the Senate was the second-longest of the 16 nominees receiving a final vote since 1975, second only to Bork's 108 days.[136] The vote to confirm Thomas was the narrowest margin for approval in more than 100 years.[176] Thomas received his commission on October 23 and took the prescribed constitutional and judicial oaths of office, becoming the Court's 106th justice.[177][c] He was sworn in by Justice Byron White in a ceremony initially scheduled for October 21, which was postponed because of the death of Chief Justice William Rehnquist's wife, Natalie.[179][180][181] His first set of law clerks included future judges Gregory Katsas and Gregory Maggs and U.S. Ambassador Christopher Landau.[182][183] After joining the Supreme Court, Thomas emerged as a member of the Court's conservative wing.[184] He aligned himself with Justice Antonin Scalia, with whom he shared an originalist approach to constitutional interpretation, and sided with him in 92 percent of cases during his first 13 years on the bench.[d] Over time, Thomas and Scalia's jurisprudence separated,[e] with Thomas favoring stronger emphasis on the Constitution's original understanding and demonstrating greater willingness to overrule precedent.[192] His appointment represented a decline in the Court's liberal wing, which then comprised only Justices John Paul Stevens and Harry Blackmun.[193][194] In his early days on the Court, Thomas adopted a bold style of legal jurisprudence that alienated him from Justices Blackmun and Sandra Day O'Connor. He became the subject of intense media criticism for his decisions, including from figures that supported his appointment. Having previously experienced scrutiny during his confirmation hearings, Thomas believed in producing results without regard for his public image, a characteristic embodied in his lack of questions during oral arguments. His conservative approach moved O'Connor to take liberal positions but attracted Scalia. He formed a friendship with Justice Byron White, with whom he shared multiple interests, and found support from Justice David Souter.[195][196] Thomas is a proponent of original meaning, incorporating what had been Scalia's narrower approach to the doctrine and the original intent of the Framers of the Constitution, including those espoused in the Declaration of Independence. As a means to impartiality, he is an advocate of judicial restraint to limit judicial discretion.[197][f] Thomas has been the most-willing of all justices on the Court to overrule precedent; according to Scalia, \"he does not believe in stare decisis, period\".[200][201][g] By October 1, 2012, he had written 475 opinions, including 171 majority opinions, 138 concurrences, and 166 dissenting opinions—approximately 10 percent of the 1,772 cases the Court had decided since he was elevated.[203] In 2016, Thomas wrote nearly twice as many opinions as any other justice.[9] Thomas has been called the most conservative member of the Supreme Court,[196][204][205] though others gave Scalia that designation while they served on the Court together.[206][207] Thomas's influence, particularly among conservatives, was perceived to have significantly increased during Donald Trump's presidency,[208][209] and Trump appointed many of his former clerks to political positions and judgeships.[210][211][212] As the Supreme Court became more conservative, Thomas and his legal views became more influential on the Court.[213][214][215] This influence increased further by 2022, with Thomas authoring an opinion expanding Second Amendment rights and contributing to the Court's overruling of Roe v. Wade. He was also the most senior associate justice by that time.[216][217][218] Thomas believes the Court should not follow erroneous precedent, a view not currently held by other justices.[219] He has called to reconsider New York Times Co. v. Sullivan (1964), and criticized Roe v. Wade (1973) and Gideon v. Wainwright (1963). At a 2013 Federalist Society dinner, Judge Diane S. Sykes asked Thomas whether \"stare decisis doesn't hold much force for you?\" He responded, \"Oh, it sure does, but not enough to keep me from going to the Constitution\".[220][221] In 2019, The New York Times reported that data gathered by political scientist Stephen L. Wasby of the University at Albany found that Thomas wrote \"more than 250 concurring or dissenting opinions seriously questioning precedents, calling for their reconsideration or suggesting that they be overruled\".[220] In the 2010 gun regulation case McDonald v. City of Chicago, Thomas sought to repeal past precedents and insisted that \"stare decisis is only an 'adjunct' of our duty as judges to decide by our best lights what the Constitution means\".[222] In Gamble v. United States (2019), he joined the majority opinion, which revisited an exception to the Double Jeopardy Clause, writing separately to state his position against the Court's prevailing view of multi-factor analysis regarding whether to follow precedent:[223] In my view, if the Court encounters a decision that is demonstrably erroneous—i.e., one that is not a permissible interpretation of the text—the Court should correct the error, regardless of whether other factors support overruling the precedent. Federal courts may (but need not) adhere to an incorrect decision as precedent, but only when traditional tools of legal interpretation show that the earlier decision adopted a textually permissible interpretation of the law. A demonstrably incorrect judicial decision, by contrast, is tantamount to making law, and adhering to it both disregards the supremacy of the Constitution and perpetuates a usurpation of the legislative power.[224] In Franchise Tax Board of California v. Hyatt (2019),[h] Thomas wrote the 5–4 decision overruling Nevada v. Hall (1979), which said states could be sued in courts of other states. In his majority opinion, he noted that stare decisis \"is not an inexorable command\". Thomas explicitly disavowed the concept of reliance interests as justification for adhering to precedent. In dissent from Hyatt III, Justice Breyer asked what other decisions might eventually be overruled, and suggested Roe v. Wade might be among them. Breyer stated that it is best to leave precedents alone unless they are widely seen as erroneous or become impractical.[225] Thomas has supported a broad interpretation of executive power and has theorized about its constitutional aspects.[9] In Hamdi v. Rumsfeld (2004),[i] he dissented from the majority opinion, arguing that courts should have had complete deference to the executive decision to determine that Yaser Esam Hamdi was an enemy combatant.[226] He wrote in Hamdi that the president does not have the singular authority to detain a citizen who was captured while in enemy service.[227] In addition, Thomas noted that \"structural advantages [of the Presidency] are most important in the national-security and foreign-affairs contexts\" and thus \"the Founders intended that the President have primary responsibility—along with the necessary power—to protect the national security and to conduct the nation's foreign relations\".[228] Thomas was one of three justices to dissent in Hamdan v. Rumsfeld (2006),[j] which concerned whether the president can establish military tribunals to try detained enemy combatants for war crimes conspiracy. As in Hamdi, he relied on The Federalist Papers in proposing that the president is responsible for protecting national security.[229][230] In Zivotofsky v. Kerry (2015), Thomas relied on the Articles of Confederation for his opinion. He wrote, \"the President is not confined to those powers expressly identified in [the Constitution]\", concluding that residual foreign affairs were vested in the president, not Congress.[231] Rather than finding the original intent or original understanding, Thomas wrote in the case that he sought the \"understanding of executive power [that] prevailed in America\" at the time of the founding.[232] In the Ninth Circuit case East Bay Sanctuary Covenant v. Trump (2018), which placed an injunction on the Trump administration's asylum policy, Thomas dissented from a denial of stay application. The Ninth Circuit imposed an injunction on the Trump administration's policy granting asylum only to refugees entering from a designated port of entry, ruling that it violated the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952. Ninth Circuit Judge Jay Bybee's majority opinion concluded that denial of the ability to apply for asylum regardless of entry point is \"the hollowest of rights that an alien must be allowed to apply for asylum regardless of whether she arrived through a port of entry if another rule makes her categorically ineligible for asylum based on precisely that fact.\" Gorsuch, Alito, Kavanaugh also dissented in the decision to deny a stay to the Ninth Circuit's injunction.[233][234] Thomas views federalism as a foundational limit on federal power.[235] In interpreting congressional powers, he has defended strict constructionism—an approach Scalia rejected.[236] On September 24, 1999, Thomas delivered the Dwight D. Opperman Lecture at Drake University Law School on \"Why Federalism Matters\", saying that it was an essential safeguard to protect \"individual liberty and the private ordering of our lives\". He also asserted that federalism enhances self-government, protects individual liberty by separating political power, and checks federal authority.[237] According to law professor Ann Althouse, the Court has yet to move toward \"the broader, more principled version of federalism propounded by Justice Thomas\".[238] Nothing in the Constitution deprives the people of each State of the power to prescribe eligibility requirements for the candidates who seek to represent them in Congress. The Constitution is simply silent on this question. And where the Constitution is silent, it raises no bar to action by the States or the people. — Thomas, dissenting in U.S. Term Limits, Inc. v. Thornton (1995)[239][235] In the 1995 case U.S. Term Limits, Inc. v. Thornton,[k] parties challenged the constitutionality of an amendment to the Arkansas Constitution that added age, citizenship, and residency requirements for congressional service. In a 5–4 decision, the Supreme Court ruled the amendment unconstitutional, also affirming the previous rulings of both the state's trial court and the Arkansas Supreme Court; Justice Stevens wrote for the majority. Thomas—joined by Justices Rehnquist, O'Connor, and Scalia—dissented in what is to date his lengthiest opinion.[240] He argued that states could impose term limits on members of Congress, as state citizens are \"the ultimate source of the Constitution's authority\".[241] That same year, Thomas concurred in United States v. Lopez, which invalidated the Gun-Free School Zones Act of 1990 for going beyond the Commerce Clause. He opined that the Court had deviated \"from the original understanding of the Commerce Clause\" and that the substantial effects test, \"if taken to its logical extreme, would give Congress a 'police power' over all aspects of American life\".[242] Thomas dissented in Gonzales v. Raich (2005), which held that the Controlled Substances Act applies to homegrown marijuana, on the grounds of original meaning.[243] His interpretation of the interstate commerce clause differed from Scalia's, and they also held conflicting beliefs about the general welfare clause, the Indian commerce clause, and the necessary and proper clause. Scalia joined the majority opinion, but Thomas disputed the relevance of homegrown marijuana to interstate commerce, writing that if Congress can regulate it, \"it can regulate virtually anything—and the Federal Government is no longer one of limited and enumerated powers\".[244][245] In United States v. Comstock (2010),[l] the Supreme Court, in a majority opinion by Justice Stephen Breyer, held that the Necessary and Proper Clause allows Congress to enact a law that authorized the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) to detain a mentally ill and dangerous federal prisoner beyond the DOJ's original lawful date. Thomas's dissent, joined by Scalia, argued that the clause allows Congress only to execute enumerated powers.[246] When the Court upheld the Affordable Care Act in National Federation of Independent Business v. Sebelius (2012), he authored a short dissent and joined the joint dissent finding the act completely unconstitutional.[247] As of 2007, Thomas was the justice most willing to exercise judicial review of federal statutes but among the least likely to overturn state statutes.[248] According to a New York Times editorial, \"from 1994 to 2005 ... Justice Thomas voted to overturn federal laws in 34 cases and Justice Scalia in 31, compared with just 15 for Justice Stephen Breyer\".[249] In Northwest Austin Municipal Utility District No. 1 v. Holder, Thomas was the sole dissenter, voting to throw out Section Five of the 1965 Voting Rights Act. Section Five requires states with a history of racial voter discrimination—mostly states from the old South—to gain Justice Department clearance when revising election procedures. Congress had reauthorized Section Five in 2006 for another 25 years, but Thomas said the law was no longer necessary, stating that the rate of black voting in seven Section Five states was higher than the national average. He wrote, \"the violence, intimidation and subterfuge that led Congress to pass Section 5 and this court to uphold it no longer remains.\"[250] He took this position again in Shelby County v. Holder, voting with the majority and concurring with the reasoning that struck down Section Five.[251] Thomas has generally written opinions in favor of protections for free speech.[252][253] He has voted in favor of First Amendment claims in cases involving issues including campaign contributions and commercial speech.[254] A 2002 study by Eugene Volokh found Thomas to be the justice second-most likely to uphold free speech claims (tied with Souter).[255] He has ruled against laws regulating hate speech, as in R.A.V. v. City of St. Paul (1992), United States v. Stevens (2010), and Snyder v. Phelps (2011).[256] Conversely, he has been reluctant to uphold speech deemed intimidating, as in Virginia v. Black (2003).[257][258] Thomas's first opinion on free speech was the 1995 case McIntyre v. Ohio Elections Commission,[m] finding that the Founding Era contained the expansive use of anonymous pamphlets and columns. Although he agreed with the result of Justice John Paul Stevens's majority opinion, he disagreed with its methodology and did not join it.[259] With the announcement of McIntyre, the Court also decided Rubin v. Coors Brewing Company, in which Thomas wrote his first majority opinion concerning free speech. In Rubin, Thomas was joined unanimously in ruling unconstitutional a 1935 federal law that prohibited beer labels from disclosing alcohol content. He similarly concurred the next year in 44 Liquormart v. Rhode Island, which struck down a state law that banned the advertisement of prices of alcoholic beverages.[260] In Colorado Republican Federal Campaign Committee v. FEC (1996), the Supreme Court ruled against the decision of the Federal Election Commission (FEC) to fine the Colorado Republican Federal Campaign Committee for running a political advertisement targeting Senator Tim Wirth. Thomas joined Justice Stephen Breyer's majority opinion in the case, but wrote separately to call against the framework established in the previous campaign finance case of Buckley v Valeo (1976): I believe that contribution limits infringe as directly and as seriously upon freedom of political expression and association as do expenditure limits. The protections of the First Amendment do not depend upon so fine a line as that between spending money to support a candidate or group and giving money to the candidate or group to spend for the same purpose. In principle, people and groups give money to candidates and other groups for the same reason that they spend money in support of those candidates and groups: because they share social, economic, and political beliefs and seek to have those beliefs affect governmental policy.[261] Thomas has made public his belief that all limits on federal campaign contributions are unconstitutional and should be struck down.[262] In Citizens United v. FEC (2010), Thomas joined the majority but dissented in part, arguing that the Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act's disclaimer and disclosure requirements were unconstitutional. He reinforced his defense of anonymous speech in Doe v. Reed (2010), writing that the First Amendment protects \"political association\" by means of signing a petition.[263] In Tinker v. Des Moines Independent Community School District (1969), Justice Hugo Black dissented from the Court's opinion invalidating a school's policy to forbid students from wearing armbands in protest of the Vietnam War. Thomas endorsed Black's dissent in Morse v. Frederick (2007), concurring with narrowing the rationale of Tinker and arguing that Tinker be overruled as it was a constitutionally unsupported \"sea change in students’ speech rights\".[264] In his view, the Constitution does not govern whether public school students may be disciplined for expressive behavior.[265] In Mahanoy Area School District v. B.L.—in which a high school punished a student for sending a profane message on social media about her school, softball team, and cheer team—Thomas was the lone dissenter, siding with the school. He criticized the majority for relying on \"vague considerations\" and wrote that historically schools could discipline students in similar situations.[266] In Walker v. Texas Division, Sons of Confederate Veterans, he joined the majority opinion that Texas's decision to deny a request for a Confederate Battle Flag specialty license plate was constitutional.[267] Thomas agreed with the judgment in McDonald v. Chicago (2010) that the right to keep and bear arms is applicable to state and local governments, but he wrote a separate concurrence finding that an individual's right to bear arms is fundamental as a privilege of American citizenship under the Privileges or Immunities Clause rather than as a fundamental right under the due process clause.[268] The four justices in the plurality opinion specifically rejected incorporation under the privileges or immunities clause, \"declin[ing] to disturb\" the holding in the Slaughter-House Cases, which, according to the plurality, had held that the clause applied only to federal matters.[269][270] Since 2010, Thomas has dissented from denial of certiorari in several Second Amendment cases. He voted to grant certiorari in Friedman v. City of Highland Park (2015), which upheld bans on certain semi-automatic rifles; Jackson v. San Francisco (2014), which upheld trigger lock ordinances similar to those struck down in Heller; Peruta v. San Diego County (2016), which upheld restrictive concealed carry licensing in California; and Silvester v. Becerra (2017), which upheld waiting periods for firearm purchasers who have already passed background checks and already own firearms. He was joined by Scalia in the first two cases, and by Gorsuch in Peruta.[271][272][273][274] Thomas dissented from the denial of an application for a stay presented to Chief Justice Roberts in the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit case Guedes v. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives (2019), a case challenging the Trump administration's ban on bump stocks. Only Thomas and Gorsuch publicly dissented.[275] Thomas authored the majority opinion in New York State Rifle & Pistol Association, Inc. v. Bruen (2022), guaranteeing the right of law-abiding citizens to carry firearms in public. The case held: \"When the Second Amendment's plain text covers an individual's conduct, the Constitution presumptively protects that conduct. The government must then justify its regulation by demonstrating that it is consistent with the Nation's historical tradition of firearm regulation. Only then may a court conclude that the individual's conduct falls outside the Second Amendment's 'unqualified command.'\" Justice Stephen Breyer, dissenting, wrote, \"when courts interpret the Second Amendment, it is constitutionally proper, indeed often necessary, for them to consider the serious dangers and consequences of gun violence that lead States to regulate firearms.\"[276] Thomas was the sole dissenter in United States v. Rahimi. In Rahimi, the Court was tasked with deciding whether 18 U.S.C. § 922(g)(8) (a federal statute that prohibits people subject to a domestic restraining order from possessing guns during the time they are subject to the order and imposes up to 15 years' imprisonment for each violation) is unconstitutional on its face. The other eight justices found that the statute could be applied constitutionally, but Thomas argued that the surety, affray, and \"going armed\" laws the government proffered were not sufficient analogies to §922(g)(8) for many reasons, including that historical surety laws did not actually disarm people but only required them to post a bond that would be forfeited if they breached the peace, and that affray laws targeted violence that occurred in public, not private interpersonal violence within the home.[277][278][279] In cases regarding the Fourth Amendment, which prohibits unreasonable searches and seizures, Thomas often favors police over defendants. For example, his opinion for the Court in Board of Education v. Earls upheld drug testing for students involved in extracurricular activities, and he wrote again for the Court in Samson v. California, permitting random searches on parolees. He dissented in Georgia v. Randolph, which prohibited warrantless searches that one resident approves and the other opposes, arguing that the Court's decision in Coolidge v. New Hampshire controlled the case. In Indianapolis v. Edmond, Thomas described the Court's extant case law as having held that \"suspicionless roadblock seizures are constitutionally permissible if conducted according to a plan that limits the discretion of the officers conducting the stops.\" He expressed doubt that those cases were decided correctly but concluded that since the litigants in the case at bar had not briefed or argued that the earlier cases be overruled, he believed that the Court should assume their validity and rule accordingly.[280] Thomas was in the majority in Kyllo v. United States, which held that the use of thermal imaging technology to probe a suspect's home without a warrant violated the Fourth Amendment. In cases involving schools, Thomas has advocated greater respect for the doctrine of in loco parentis,[281] which he defines as \"parents delegat[ing] to teachers their authority to discipline and maintain order\".[282] His dissent in Safford Unified School District v. Redding illustrates his application of this postulate in the Fourth Amendment context. School officials in the Safford case had a reasonable suspicion that 13-year-old Savana Redding was illegally distributing prescription-only drugs. All the justices concurred that it was therefore reasonable for the school officials to search Redding, and the main issue before the Court was only whether the search went too far by becoming a strip search or the like.[282] All the justices except Thomas concluded that the search violated the Fourth Amendment. The majority required a finding of danger or reason to believe drugs were hidden in a student's underwear in order to justify a strip search. Thomas wrote, \"It is a mistake for judges to assume the responsibility for deciding which school rules are important enough to allow for invasive searches and which rules are not\"[283] and \"reasonable suspicion that Redding was in possession of drugs in violation of these policies, therefore, justified a search extending to any area where small pills could be concealed\". He added, \"[t]here can be no doubt that a parent would have had the authority to conduct the search.\"[282] In Doggett v. United States, the defendant had technically been a fugitive from the time he was indicted in 1980 until his arrest in 1988. The Court held that the delay between indictment and arrest violated Doggett's Sixth Amendment right to a speedy trial, finding that the government had been negligent in pursuing him and that he was unaware of the indictment.[284] Thomas dissented, arguing that the Speedy Trial Clause's purpose was to prevent \"'undue and oppressive incarceration' and the 'anxiety and concern accompanying public accusation'\" and that the case implicated neither.[284] He cast the case instead as \"present[ing] the question [of] whether, independent of these core concerns, the Speedy Trial Clause protects an accused from two additional harms: (1) prejudice to his ability to defend himself caused by the passage of time; and (2) disruption of his life years after the alleged commission of his crime\". Thomas dissented from the court's decision to, as he saw it, answer the former in the affirmative.[284] He wrote that dismissing the conviction \"invites the Nation's judges to indulge in ad hoc and result-driven second guessing of the government's investigatory efforts. Our Constitution neither contemplates nor tolerates such a role\".[285] In Garza v. Idaho, Thomas and Gorsuch, in dissent, suggested that Gideon v. Wainwright (1963), which required that indigent criminal defendants be provided counsel, was wrongly decided and should be overruled.[220] Thomas was among the dissenters in Atkins v. Virginia and Roper v. Simmons, which held that the Eighth Amendment prohibits the application of the death penalty to certain classes of persons. In Kansas v. Marsh, his majority opinion indicated a belief that the Constitution affords states broad procedural latitude in imposing the death penalty, provided they remain within the limits of Furman v. Georgia and Gregg v. Georgia, the 1976 case in which the Court reversed its 1972 ban on death sentences if states followed procedural guidelines.[citation needed] In Hudson v. McMillian, a prisoner had been beaten by respondent prison guards, sustaining a cracked lip, broken dental plate, loosened teeth, cuts, and bruises. The Court held that \"the use of excessive physical force against a prisoner may constitute cruel and unusual punishment even though the inmate does not suffer serious injury.\"[286] Dissenting, Thomas wrote, \"a use of force that causes only insignificant harm to a prisoner may be immoral, it may be tortious, it may be criminal, and it may even be remediable under other provisions of the Federal Constitution, but it is not 'cruel and unusual punishment'. In concluding to the contrary, the Court today goes far beyond our precedents.\"[286] Thomas's vote—in one of his first cases after joining the Court—was an early example of his willingness to be the sole dissenter (Scalia later joined the opinion).[287] His opinion was criticized by the seven-member majority, which wrote that, by comparing physical assault to other prison conditions such as poor prison food, it ignored \"the concepts of dignity, civilized standards, humanity, and decency that animate the Eighth Amendment\".[286] According to historian David Garrow, Thomas's dissent in Hudson was a \"classic call for federal judicial restraint, reminiscent of views that were held by Felix Frankfurter and John M. Harlan II a generation earlier, but editorial criticism rained down on him\".[288] Thomas later responded to the accusation \"that I supported the beating of prisoners in that case. Well, one must either be illiterate or fraught with malice to reach that conclusion ... no honest reading can reach such a conclusion.\"[288] In United States v. Bajakajian, Thomas joined with the Court's liberal justices to write the majority opinion declaring a fine unconstitutional under the Eighth Amendment. The fine was for failing to declare more than $300,000 in a suitcase on an international flight. Under a federal statute, 18 U.S.C. § 982(a)(1), the passenger would have had to forfeit the entire amount. Thomas noted that the case required a distinction to be made between civil forfeiture and a fine exacted with the intention of punishing the respondent. He found that the forfeiture in this case was clearly intended as a punishment at least in part, was \"grossly disproportional\" and violated the Excessive Fines Clause.[289] Thomas has written that the \"Cruel and Unusual Punishment\" clause \"contains no proportionality principle\", meaning that the question whether a sentence should be rejected as \"cruel and unusual\" depends only on the sentence itself, not on what crime is being punished.[290] He concurred with the Court's decision to reject a request for review from a petitioner who had been sentenced to 25 years to life in prison under California's \"Three-Strikes\" law for stealing golf clubs because the combined value of the clubs made the theft a felony and he had two previous felonies in his criminal record.[non-primary source needed] Thomas believes the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment forbids consideration of race, such as race-based affirmative action or preferential treatment. In Adarand Constructors v. Peña, he wrote, \"there is a 'moral [and] constitutional equivalence' between laws designed to subjugate a race and those that distribute benefits on the basis of race in order to foster some current notion of equality. Government cannot make us equal; it can only recognize, respect, and protect us as equal before the law. That [affirmative action] programs may have been motivated, in part, by good intentions cannot provide refuge from the principle that under our Constitution, the government may not make distinctions on the basis of race.\"[291] In Gratz v. Bollinger, Thomas wrote, \"a State's use of racial discrimination in higher education admissions is categorically prohibited by the Equal Protection Clause.\"[292] In Parents Involved in Community Schools v. Seattle School District No. 1, Thomas joined the opinion of Chief Justice Roberts, who wrote that \"[t]he way to stop discrimination on the basis of race is to stop discriminating on the basis of race.\"[293] Concurring, Thomas wrote, \"if our history has taught us anything, it has taught us to beware of elites bearing racial theories\", and charged that the dissent carried \"similarities\" to the arguments of the segregationist litigants in Brown v. Board of Education.[293] Thomas joined the majority in Students for Fair Admissions v. Harvard, which struck down affirmative action in college admissions. He filed a concurring opinion, which he read from the bench, a rare practice for Supreme Court justices.[294] Thomas has contended that the Constitution does not address abortion.[295] In Planned Parenthood v. Casey (1992), the Court reaffirmed Roe v. Wade. Thomas and Justice Byron White joined the dissenting opinions of Rehnquist and Scalia. Rehnquist wrote, \"[w]e believe Roe was wrongly decided, and that it can and should be overruled consistently with our traditional approach to stare decisis in constitutional cases.\"[296] Scalia's opinion concluded that the right to obtain an abortion is not \"a liberty protected by the Constitution of the United States\".[296] \"[T]he Constitution says absolutely nothing about it,\" Scalia wrote, \"and [ ] the longstanding traditions of American society have permitted it to be legally proscribed\".[296] In Stenberg v. Carhart (2000), the Court struck down a state ban on partial-birth abortion, concluding that it failed Casey's \"undue burden\" test. Thomas dissented, writing, \"Although a State may permit abortion, nothing in the Constitution dictates that a State must do so.\"[297] He went on to criticize the reasoning of the Casey and Stenberg majorities: \"The majority's insistence on a health exception is a fig leaf barely covering its hostility to any abortion regulation by the States—a hostility that Casey purported to reject.\" In Gonzales v. Carhart (2007), the Court rejected a facial challenge to a federal ban on partial-birth abortion.[298] Concurring, Thomas asserted that the court's abortion jurisprudence had no basis in the Constitution but that the court had accurately applied that jurisprudence in rejecting the challenge.[298] He added that the Court was not deciding the question of whether Congress had the power to outlaw partial-birth abortions: \"[W]hether the Act constitutes a permissible exercise of Congress's power under the Commerce Clause is not before the Court [in this case] ... the parties did not raise or brief that issue; it is outside the question presented; and the lower courts did not address it.\"[298] In December 2018, Thomas dissented when the Court voted not to hear cases brought by Louisiana and Kansas to deny Medicaid funding to Planned Parenthood.[299] Alito and Gorsuch joined Thomas's dissent, arguing that the Court was \"abdicating its judicial duty\".[300] In February 2019, Thomas joined three of the Court's other conservative justices in voting to reject a stay to temporarily block a law restricting abortion in Louisiana.[301] The law that the court temporarily stayed, in a 5–4 decision, would have required that doctors performing abortions have admitting privileges in a hospital.[302] In Box v. Planned Parenthood of Indiana and Kentucky, Inc. (2019), a per curiam decision upholding the provision of Indiana's abortion restriction regarding fetal remains disposal on rational basis scrutiny and upholding the lower court rulings striking down the provision banning race, sex, and disability, Thomas wrote a concurring opinion comparing abortion and birth control to eugenics, which was practiced in the U.S. in the early 20th century and by the Nazi government in Germany in the 1930s and 1940s, and comparing Box to Buck v. Bell (1927), which upheld a forced sterilization law regarding people with mental disabilities. In his opinion, Thomas quoted Margaret Sanger's support for contraception as a form of personal reproductive control that she considered superior to \"the horrors of abortion and infanticide\" (Sanger's words).[303][non-primary source needed] His opinion referred several times to historian/journalist Adam Cohen's book Imbeciles: The Supreme Court, American Eugenics, and the Sterilization of Carrie Buck; shortly afterward, Cohen published a sharply worded criticism saying that Thomas had misinterpreted his book and misunderstood the history of the eugenics movement.[304] In Box, only Thomas, Sonia Sotomayor, and Ginsburg publicly registered their votes. Ginsburg and Sotomayor concurred in part and dissented in part, stating they would have upheld the lower court decision on striking down the race, sex, and disability ban as well as the lower court decision striking down the fetal remains disposal provision.[303] In a concurring opinion in Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization (2022), Thomas wrote that \"any substantive due process decision is 'demonstrably erroneous'\",[305] and argued that the Supreme Court should go beyond Roe vs. Wade and reconsider other substantive due process precedents, including those established in Griswold v. Connecticut (1965), Lawrence v. Texas (2003) and Obergefell v. Hodges (2015). The overturning of these previous decisions would enable states to limit access to contraception, criminalize sodomy, and criminalize same-sex marriage, respectively.[306][307][308] In Romer v. Evans (1996), Thomas joined Scalia's dissenting opinion arguing that Amendment Two to the Colorado State Constitution did not violate the Equal Protection Clause. The Colorado amendment forbade any judicial, legislative, or executive action designed to protect persons from discrimination based on \"homosexual, lesbian, or bisexual orientation, conduct, practices or relationships\".[309] In Lawrence v. Texas (2003), Thomas issued a one-page dissent in which he called the Texas statute prohibiting sodomy \"uncommonly silly\", a phrase originally used by Justice Potter Stewart. He then said that if he were a member of the Texas legislature he would vote to repeal the law, as it was not a worthwhile use of \"law enforcement resources\" to police private sexual behavior. But Thomas opined that the Constitution does not contain a right to privacy and therefore did not vote to strike the statute down. He saw the issue as a matter for states to decide for themselves.[310] In Bostock v. Clayton County, Georgia (2020), Thomas joined Alito and Kavanaugh in dissenting from the decision that Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 protects employees against discrimination based on sexual orientation or gender identity. (Alito wrote a dissent that Thomas joined, and Kavanaugh dissented separately.) The 6–3 ruling's majority consisted of two Republican-appointed justices, Roberts and Gorsuch, along with four Democratic-appointed justices: Ginsburg, Breyer, Sotomayor, and Kagan.[311] In October 2020, Thomas joined the other justices in denying an appeal from Kim Davis, a county clerk who refused to give marriage licenses to same-sex couples, but wrote a separate opinion reiterating his dissent from Obergefell v. Hodges and expressing his belief that it was wrongly decided.[312][313][314] In July 2021, he was one of three justices, with Gorsuch and Alito, who voted to hear an appeal from a Washington florist who had refused service to a same-sex couple based on her religious beliefs against same-sex marriage.[315][316][317] In November 2021, Thomas dissented from the majority of justices in a 6–3 vote to reject an appeal from Mercy San Juan Medical Center, a hospital affiliated with the Roman Catholic Church, which had sought to deny a hysterectomy to a transgender patient on religious grounds.[318] Alito and Gorsuch also dissented, and the vote to reject the appeal left in place a lower court ruling in the patient's favor.[319][320] During a 10-year period from February 2006 to February 2016, Thomas read his opinions from the bench but asked no questions during oral arguments.[321][322] By May 2020, he had asked questions in two oral arguments since 2006 and had spoken during 32 of the roughly 2,400 arguments since 1991.[323][324] Thomas has given many reasons for his silence, including self-consciousness about how he speaks, a preference for listening to those arguing the case, and difficulty getting in a word.[325] He said in 2013 that it was \"unnecessary in deciding cases to ask that many questions ... we should listen to lawyers who are arguing their cases, and I think we should allow the advocates to advocate.\"[325] His speaking and listening habits may have been influenced by his Gullah upbringing, during which his English was relatively unpolished.[17][63][326] In a 2017 paper in Northwestern University Law Review, RonNell Andersen Jones and Aaron L. Nielson wrote that while asking few questions, \"in many ways, [Thomas] is a model questioner.\"[327][328] Thomas took a more active role in questioning when the Supreme Court shifted to holding teleconferenced arguments in May 2020 during the COVID-19 pandemic, in which the justices took turns asking questions in order of seniority.[329][330][331][324] Since the court resumed in-person oral arguments at the beginning of the 2021 term, the justices agreed to allow Thomas to ask the first question of each lawyer following their opening statements.[332] In 1971, Thomas married Kathy Grace Ambush. The couple had one child, Jamal Adeen, born in 1973, who is Thomas's sole child. Thomas and his first wife separated in 1981 and divorced in 1984.[333][334] In 1987, Thomas married Virginia Lamp, a lobbyist and aide to U.S. Representative Dick Armey.[335] In 1997, they took in Thomas's six-year-old great-nephew, Mark Martin Jr.,[336] who had lived with his mother in Savannah public housing.[337] Since 1999, Thomas and his wife have traveled across the U.S. in a motorcoach between Court terms.[338][339] Virginia \"Ginni\" Thomas has remained active in conservative politics, serving as a consultant to The Heritage Foundation and as founder and president of Liberty Central.[340] In 2011, she stepped down from Liberty Central to open a conservative lobbying firm, touting her \"experience and connections\", meeting with newly elected Republican representatives and calling herself an \"ambassador to the Tea Party\".[341][342] Also in 2011, 74 Democratic members of the House of Representatives wrote that Justice Thomas should recuse himself on cases regarding the Affordable Care Act because of \"appearance of a conflict of interest\" based on his wife's work.[343] The Washington Post reported in February 2021 that Ginni Thomas apologized to a group of Thomas's former clerks on the email listserv \"Thomas Clerk World\" for her role in contributing to a rift relating to \"pro-Trump postings and former Thomas clerk John Eastman, who spoke at the rally and represented Trump in some of his failed lawsuits filed to overturn the election results\".[344] In March 2022, texts between Ginni Thomas and Trump's chief of staff Mark Meadows from 2020 were turned over to the Select Committee on the January 6 Attack.[345] The texts show Ginni Thomas repeatedly urging Meadows to overturn the election results and repeating conspiracy theories about ballot fraud.[346] In response, 24 Democratic members of the House of Representatives and the Senate demanded that Thomas recuse himself from cases related to efforts to overturn the results of the 2020 presidential election and the January 6 attack at the U.S. Capitol on the grounds that Ginni Thomas's involvement in such efforts raised questions about his impartiality.[347] An April 2022 Quinnipiac poll found that 52% of Americans agreed that, in light of Ginni Thomas's texts about overturning the results of the 2020 presidential election, Thomas should have recused himself from related cases.[348] Thomas was reconciled to the Catholic Church in the mid-1990s.[349] In his autobiography, he criticized the church for failing to grapple with racism in the 1960s during the civil rights movement, saying it was not so \"adamant about ending racism then as it is about ending abortion now\".[350] As of 2021, Thomas is one of 14 practicing Catholic justices in the Court's history and one of six currently serving (along with Alito, Kavanaugh, Roberts, Sotomayor, and Barrett).[351] In 1975, when Thomas read economist Thomas Sowell's Race and Economics, he found an intellectual foundation for his philosophy.[352][353] The book criticizes social reform by government and argues for individual action to overcome circumstances and adversity. Ayn Rand's works also influenced him, particularly The Fountainhead, and he later required his staffers to watch the 1949 film version of the novel.[354][355] Thomas acknowledges \"some very strong libertarian leanings\", though he does not consider himself a libertarian.[356] Thomas has said novelist Richard Wright is the most influential writer in his life; Wright's books Native Son and Black Boy \"capture[d] a lot of the feelings that I had inside that you learn how to repress\".[333] Native Son and Ralph Ellison's Invisible Man are Thomas's two favorite novels.[191] In 2016, Moira Smith, vice-president and general counsel of a natural gas distributor in Alaska, said that Thomas groped her buttocks at a dinner party in 1999. She was a Truman Foundation scholar helping the director of the foundation set up for a dinner party honoring Thomas and David Adkins. Smith's roommates at the time confirmed that she had told them about the incident. Thomas denied the allegation.[357][358] Louis Blair, who was the head of the Truman Foundation and hosted the dinner at his home, said he had \"no recollection of the incident\" and that he had neither seen nor heard of Smith's allegation. Blair acknowledged that he was in the kitchen most of the time so, if the incident happened, he wouldn't have seen it, but was also \"skeptical that the justice and Moira would have been alone\", given that there were approximately 16 people in three rooms.[359][360] Norma Stevens, who attended the event, said that the incident \"couldn't have happened\" because Thomas was never alone, as he was the guest of honor.[361] In 2004, the Los Angeles Times reported that Thomas had accepted gifts from Harlan Crow, a wealthy Dallas-based real estate investor and prominent Republican donor, including a Bible that once belonged to abolitionist Frederick Douglass and a bust of Abraham Lincoln.[362][363] Crow also gave Thomas a portrait of the justice and his wife, according to the painter, Sharif Tarabay. Crow's foundation gave $105,000 to Yale Law School, Thomas's alma mater, for the \"Justice Thomas Portrait Fund\", tax filings showed.[364] Spousal income and connections to cases has been redacted from the Justices' ethical disclosure forms.[365] In 2011, Politico reported that Crow gave $500,000 to a Tea Party group founded by Thomas's wife and that Thomas had failed to report her income on his disclosure for more than a decade.[366][367] Also that year, the advocacy group Common Cause reported that between 2003 and 2007, Thomas failed to disclose $686,589 in income his wife earned from The Heritage Foundation, instead reporting \"none\" where \"spousal noninvestment income\" would be reported on his Supreme Court financial disclosure forms.[368] The next week, Thomas said the disclosure of his wife's income had been \"inadvertently omitted due to a misunderstanding of the filing instructions\".[369] He amended reports going back to 1989.[370] In April 2023, ProPublica reported that Thomas had \"accepted luxury trips virtually every year\" from Crow for two decades and failed to report them. They included flights on Crow's private jet, international cruises on Crow's superyacht, and stays at Crow's private resort in the Adirondacks and the private club Bohemian Grove.[364][371][367] The Ethics in Government Act requires justices, judges, members of Congress and federal officials to annually disclose gifts they receive.[372] Many elected officials criticized the appearance of impropriety, given Crow's donations to conservative causes and Republican candidates, and his service on the board of trustees for the American Enterprise Institute and the Hoover Institution, which have filed amicus briefs before the Supreme Court.[373][364] In May 2023, ProPublica reported that Crow had paid for private school tuition for Thomas's grandnephew, Mark Martin, of whom Thomas had legal custody. Thomas did not report the payments on his financial disclosure forms, while ethics law experts said that they were required to be disclosed as gifts. Mark Paoletta, a longtime friend of Thomas, said that Crow paid for one year each at Hidden Lake and Randolph-Macon Academy, which ProPublica estimated to be worth around $100,000.[374][367] On the same day, The Washington Post reported that in January 2012 conservative judicial activist Leonard Leo had Republican pollster Kellyanne Conway's polling firm bill the Judicial Education Project $25,000, which her firm then paid to Ginni Thomas's firm, Liberty Consulting, for a total of $80,000 between June 2011 and June 2012. Leo instructed Conway not to mention Thomas's name on the paperwork. The documents the newspaper reviewed did not indicate the nature of the work Thomas did for the Judicial Education Project or Conway's company. In 2012 the Judicial Education Project filed a brief to the Supreme Court in a landmark voting rights case.[375][367] In 2023, The New York Times reported that a friend had paid for Thomas's Prevost Le Mirage XL Marathon RV, purchased for $267,230 in 1999 (roughly equivalent to $489,000 in 2023). Anthony Welters, a former UnitedHealthcare executive and a close friend, lent Thomas the purchase price. In response to a Senate inquiry, Welters revealed that the loan was discharged in 2008, forgiving much of the original balance. A bank would have been unlikely to offer such a loan, given the Marathon's high capacity for customization, which can make used models difficult to appraise. Thomas had previously said that he \"had scrimped and saved to afford the motor coach\", according to the Times, and a friend, Armstrong Williams, said that Thomas had told him that \"he saved up all his money to buy it\". When the loan was forgiven, Thomas was required to disclose the money as a gift.[376][377][378][367][379] In June 2024, Thomas filed an amendment to his financial disclosure report for 2019 to include information he had \"inadvertently omitted\". The amendment disclosed that he had received food and lodging at a hotel in Bali and a private club in California from Harlan Crow in July 2019.[380][381] He did not report travel to and from the destinations on private jets or the nine-day cruise on Crow's superyacht.[380][381] In 2023, both the Senate Judiciary Committee and the Senate Finance Committee opened investigations into Thomas's undisclosed gifts.[382][383] The two committees found additional undisclosed travel on Crow's private jet and superyacht, including international trips in 2010 and domestic trips in 2017, 2019, and 2021.[382][384] In 2023, in response to Thomas's nondisclosures, Senate Judiciary Committee Democrats called on Chief Justice Roberts to open an investigation into Thomas's conduct.[385] On December 21, 2024, Democratic members of the Senate Judiciary Committee released a report revealing that Thomas had taken an additional two trips in 2021 paid for by Crow.[386] Fix the Court released an analysis showing that, over the 20 years beginning in 2004, Thomas had accepted gifts worth $4.2 million, based on reporting by ProPublica and others.[387][388][389] It estimated that over the same 20 years, the other eight justices plus the eight retired or deceased justices received gifts worth roughly $600,000 combined.[389] Thomas was awarded the 1992 Horatio Alger Award by the Horatio Alger Association of Distinguished Americans.[390] In 2001, Thomas was awarded the Francis Boyer Award presented by the American Enterprise Institute.[391] In 2012, Thomas received an honorary degree from the College of the Holy Cross, his alma mater.[392] He was a member of the college's board of trustees in 1990, and also from 2004 to 2006.[393] In 2020, Belmont Abbey College awarded him the Benedict Leadership Award for his devotion to the Catholic faith and government service.[394]",

And what he learned as a child had a life-long impact.</span> Why Clarence Thomas Rarely Speaks from the Supreme Court Bench Chip Somodevilla|Getty Images Clarence Thomas is a powerful, yet often-silent orator. The reason may surprise some who forget he was born in poverty. Clarence Thomas hadn't asked a question from the bench of the U.S. Supreme Court in 10 years , not until late February after the death of his colleague Antonin Scalia. He'd been questioned often about this. Journalists from nearly every major news organization on the planet repeatedly raised the topic in their stories about major cases before the high court (like Citizens United, which Thomas is somewhat responsible for). Once he did speak, it became major headlines for days. But why does Thomas usually remain silent? Jeff NesbitMarch 28, 2016 The high court's most controversial justice has offered an explanation just once – but it is a fairly extraordinary one. Progressives routinely dismiss it – or any sort of interpretation of what it means – but it's an interesting answer and shouldn't be dismissed so quickly or easily. The reason he's silent from the bench – a practice that first began during law school – has to do with his formative years, he told The New York Times 15 years ago. Until he was 6, Thomas lived in deep poverty in the lowcountry in Pin Point, Georgia. Like nearly every black child who grows up in Gullah-Geechee homes in the lowcountry – which includes communities descended from plantation slaves primarily in Georgia and South Carolina, but with roots in northern Florida and southern North Carolina – he spoke Gullah at home. For years, Gullah was considered to be \"pidgin English\" – corrupted or badly spoken English that whites generally dismissed as the language of the uneducated. But Gullah isn't that, scholars have proven. Gullah is a beautiful language, with a rich heritage. Some of the stories from the Gullah tradition have made their way into popular culture in America, though most people don't realize the origin. Br'er Rabbit and his briar patch is a Gullah story. The next time you sing \"Kumbayah\" proudly, with emotion and feeling, you can thank Gullah at the end of the song. \"In the 1700s, rice plantations flourished along the coastal areas and barrier islands stretching from North Carolina to Florida. Because they required specific skills, slaves were brought here from similar environments in Africa, where rice had been grown successfully for centuries,\" syndicated columnist Fyllis Hockman wrote in 2013. \"In many cases the Africans' knowledge of rice cultivation far exceeded that of their masters. Because the work required a wide variety of skills that only the Africans possessed, they were often accorded more responsibility and autonomy than their cotton-picking counterparts.\" USN&WR \"They came with their own language, beliefs and customs — and because they were so isolated in coastal regions that were not connected to the mainland until the 1950s, their Gullah culture flourished and proliferated among the many Africans who came to settle there, and it still endures today,\" she wrote. These slaves also had to learn how to communicate with slaves from other parts of the world who didn't necessarily know their West African dialect. They needed to learn enough English to satisfy the demands of their white masters, while simultaneously communicating with one another in ways those same white masters might not recognize. Gullah emerged from those twin demands. It is a pure example of prevailing in the face of nearly impossible odds and, when descendants of slaves in the lowcountry speak Gullah in their homes today, it is a reflection of their heritage and ability to overcome adversity. But Thomas doesn't see it that way. All he remembers is what many children from Gullah-Geechee homes learn quickly when they go to public school: You can speak Gullah, the language of your ancestors, in your home. But don't speak Gullah in public schools, especially around white people. If you do, you'll be branded as poor, uneducated and disadvantaged. So Thomas stopped speaking Gullah in public. And he largely stopped speaking publicly at all, he told the New York Times, for fear that any trace of that former life in Pin Point would somehow work its way into his speech. \"When I was 16, I was sitting as the only black kid in my class, and I had grown up speaking a kind of a dialect ... called Geechee. Some people call it Gullah, and people praise it now. But they used to make fun of us back then. It's not standard English,\" the Supreme Court justice told the Times. Jeff NesbitMarch 29, 2016 \"So I learned that, and I just started developing the habit of listening. And it just got to be, I didn't ask questions in college or law school,\" he said. \"For all those reasons and a few others, I just think that it's more in my nature to listen rather than to ask a bunch of questions. The only reason I could see for asking the questions is to let people know I've got something to ask. That's not a legitimate reason in the Supreme Court of the United States.\" Most progressives and observers of Thomas' actions on the high court, however, dismiss this explanation. \"Thomas bears the scars of yet another black prejudice: not only was he too black, he was also culturally too backcountry,\" Howard University sociology professor Orlando Patterson wrote in his 2007 review of Kevin Merida and Michael A. Fletcher's exhaustive biography, \"Supreme Discomfort: The Divided Soul of Clarence Thomas.\" \"Coastal Georgia is one of the few areas in America where a genuinely Afro-English creole — Gullah — is used, and Thomas grew up speaking it. In Savannah he was repeatedly mocked for his 'Geechee' accent and was so traumatized by this that he developed the habit of simply listening when in public,\" he wrote. \"That experience, Thomas claims, helps explain his mysterious silence on the Supreme Court during oral arguments. This seems a stretch, since Thomas is now an eloquent public speaker and an engaging conversationalist who, like most educated Southerners north of home, erased his accent long ago.\" Patterson doesn't offer another explanation for Thomas' silence on the bench of the high court; neither do other journalists, analysts, or observers. But what if Thomas' simple explanation – that he's ashamed of his roots in poverty, expressed through the language of his ancestors – actually makes the most sense? Andre Chung|MCT via Getty Images Ophelia Grant of Georgia Gullah/Geechee Shouters of McIntosh County, Ga., performs in Washington, D.C., Jan. 23, 2011. Interestingly, Thomas shares his Gullah heritage with first lady Michelle Obama. Like Thomas, Mrs. Obama has deep Gullah connections. She may not have grown up in the lowcountry but, unlike Thomas, Mrs. Obama doesn't distance herself from her Gullah roots. She displays them proudly. In fact, she went out of her way to incorporate Gullah into her husband's 2013 inauguration celebration. A float in the inauguration parade included a quilt that told the story of her ties to the Gullah culture. Mrs. Obama's ancestors were slaves at the Friendfield Plantation in Georgetown, South Carolina. One of the dignitaries who rode on that 2013 float in the Obama inauguration – Robert Macdonald, the director emeritus of the Museum of the City of New York – was astounded the then-new Gullah-Geechee Heritage Commission was given such a place in the spotlight. \"For such a young organization, it's rather startling in a way,\" Macdonald told the Charleston Post and Courier. \"I think it reflects the interest in preserving the diversity of American culture and history, which has made this country unique.\" One reason the float made its appearance is almost certainly due to the insistence of U.S. Rep. James Clyburn (D-S.C.), who has fought for greater national recognition of the Gullah heritage. Clyburn, who was instrumental in the creation of the Gullah national commission in the first place, wrote the commission to see if it was interested in taking part, and then to the inauguration committee itself to see that it was included, pointing out Mrs. Obama's connection to the Gullah-Geechee culture. The celebration of Gullah heritage is, finally, starting to take hold in America. Journalists have started to dig into the history, culture, roots and absorbing history behind Gullah along the coastline of the United States. Scholars like J. Herman Blake, a sociologist from the University of South Carolina,—Beaufort, are working to preserve decades of the Gullah heritage before it's forgotten. Blake said it's important to capture what Gullah was like a century ago since, as in all things, the language has changed in the decades since it was born. People tend to speak Gullah privately in their homes, and English in public. But it's starting to be forgotten, even in Gullah homes. And because some, like Clarence Thomas, dismiss it as a relic of poverty that must be abandoned in public, it causes communities to distance themselves from it further. \"The Geechee people of Sapelo don't understand Gullah-Geechee that well themselves anymore, and it's a different kind of speech,\" Blake wrote in The Black Scholar, describing recordings made in the 1930s by the first African-American linguist, Lorenzo Dow Turner. \"So this is the first time they are hearing Gullah-Geechee spoken the way it was 70 years ago. So it's a matter of tuning your ear to the older stage of the language. The differences between life on the island in the 1930s and today also present difficulties. They are talking about their daily lives 70 years ago and their lives were much different than what they are today…the words they used are quite different.\" Gullah – and what it means today – is a complicated tapestry for people to grasp. Some, like Clarence Thomas, run away from it. Others, like Mrs. Obama, embrace it. But what is absolutely essential is that we talk about these sorts of things publicly.

                "title": "Notre Dame Fighting Irish football - Wikipedia",
                "content": "The Notre Dame Fighting Irish football team is the college football team representing the University of Notre Dame in Notre Dame, Indiana, north of the city of South Bend, Indiana. The team plays its home games at the campus's Notre Dame Stadium, which has a capacity of 77,622. Notre Dame is one of three schools that competes as an Independent at the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) Football Bowl Subdivision (FBS) level; however, they play five games a year against opponents from the Atlantic Coast Conference (ACC), of which Notre Dame is a member in all other sports except ice hockey.[5] The Fighting Irish are among the most prestigious college football teams of all time. Since their inaugural season in 1887, Notre Dame has claimed 11 national championships, including 8 from the major wire-service: AP Poll and/or Coaches' Poll.[6] Seven Notre Dame players have won the Heisman Trophy. Notre Dame has 948 official victories, with an additional 21 having been vacated by the NCAA in 2016 for self-reported academic misconduct.[7] Notre Dame has had 22 undefeated seasons including 12 perfect seasons.[8] Notre Dame home games have been televised by NBC since 1991.[9][10] Football did not have an auspicious beginning at the University of Notre Dame. In their inaugural game on November 23, 1887, the Irish lost to Michigan by a score of 8–0.[11] Their first win came in the final game of the 1888 season when the Irish defeated Harvard Prep School of Chicago by a score of 20–0.[12] At the end of the 1888 season, they had a record of 1–3 with all three losses being at the hands of Michigan. Between 1887 and 1899, Notre Dame compiled a record of 31 wins, 15 losses, and 4 ties against a diverse variety of opponents ranging from local high school teams to other universities.[13] In 1894, James L. Morrison was hired as Notre Dame's first head football coach.[14] Notre Dame took a significant step toward respectability, prominence, and stability when they hired Morrison.[15] He wrote an acquaintance after his first day on the job: \"I arrived here [Notre Dame] this morning and found about as green a set of football players that ever donned a uniform... They want to smoke, and when I told them that they would have to run and get up some wind, they thought I was rubbing it in on them. \"One big, strong cuss remarked that it was too much like work. Well, maybe you think I didn't give him hell! I bet you a hundred no one ever makes a remark like that again.\"[15] In 1908, the win over Franklin saw end Fay Wood catch the first touchdown pass in Notre Dame history.[16] Notre Dame continued its success near the turn of the century and achieved their first victory over Michigan in 1909 by the score of 11–3, after which Michigan refused to play Notre Dame again for 33 years. By the end of the 1912 season they had amassed a record of 108 wins, 31 losses, and 13 ties.[17] Jesse Harper became head coach in 1913, coaching for five years until retiring in 1917.[18] During his tenure, the Irish began playing only intercollegiate games and posted a record of 34 wins, five losses, and one tie.[19] This period would also mark the beginning of the rivalry with Army and the continuation of rivalry with Michigan State.[20][21] In an effort to gain respect for a regionally successful but small-time Midwestern football program, Harper scheduled games in his first season with national powerhouses Texas, Penn State, and Army.[22] That year, Notre Dame burst into the national consciousness and helped to transform the collegiate game in a single contest. On November 1, 1913, the Notre Dame squad stunned the Black Knights of the Hudson 35–13 in a game played at West Point.[23] Led by quarterback Gus Dorais and end Knute Rockne, the Notre Dame team attacked the Cadets with an offense that featured both the expected powerful running game but also long and accurate downfield forward passes from Dorais to Rockne. This game has been miscredited as the invention of the forward pass.[24] Prior to this contest, receivers would come to a full stop and wait on the ball to come to them, but in this contest, Dorais threw to Rockne in stride, changing the forward pass from a seldom-used play into the dominant ball-moving strategy that it is today.[24][23] Irish assistant Knute Rockne became head coach in 1918.[25] During his 13 years, the Irish won three national championships, had five undefeated seasons, won the Rose Bowl in 1925,[26] and produced players such as George Gipp and the \"Four Horsemen\".[27] Rockne's offenses employed the Notre Dame Box and his defenses ran a 7–2–2 scheme.[28][29] Rockne took over in the war-torn season of 1918[30] He made his coaching debut on September 28, 1918, against Case Tech in Cleveland, Ohio, and earned a 26–6 victory.[31] Leonard Bahan, George Gipp, and Curly Lambeau were in the backfield.[32][33] With Gipp, Rockne had an ideal handler of the forward pass.[34][35] The Irish posted a 3–1–2 record for the season, losing only to the Michigan Agricultural Aggies. The 1919 team had Rockne handle the line and Gus Dorais handle the backfield.[36] The Irish went undefeated and were one of four teams to be selected for the national championship, although Notre Dame does not claim it.[37][38] Gipp died at age 25 on December 14, 1920,[39] just two weeks after Walter Camp elected him as Notre Dame's first All-American.[40][39] Gipp likely contracted strep throat and pneumonia while giving punting lessons after his final game on November 20 against Northwestern.[40] Since antibiotics were not available in the 1920s, treatment options for such infections were limited and they could be fatal even to young, healthy individuals.[41] Rockne was speaking to Gipp on his hospital bed when he was purported to have delivered the famous \"Win one for the Gipper\" line.[42][39][43][44][45] John Mohardt led the 1921 Notre Dame team to a 10–1 record with 781 rushing yards, 995 passing yards, 12 rushing touchdowns, and nine passing touchdowns.[46] Grantland Rice wrote that \"Mohardt could throw the ball to within a foot or two of any given space\" and noted that the 1921 Notre Dame team \"was the first team we know of to build its attack around a forward passing game, rather than use a forward passing game as a mere aid to the running game.\"[47] Mohardt had both Eddie Anderson and Roger Kiley at end to receive his passes.[48][49] The national champion 1924 team included the \"Four Horsemen\" backfield of Harry Stuhldreher, Don Miller, Jim Crowley, and Elmer Layden.[50][51] The line was known as the \"Seven Mules\".[52] The Irish capped an undefeated, 10–0 season with a victory over Stanford in the Rose Bowl.[26] The 1926 team beat Army and was led by Christie Flanagan,[53][54] but was undone by a loss to Carnegie Tech in the penultimate game of the season. In this game, Rockne made what an Associated Press writer called \"one of the greatest coaching blunders in history\" by traveling to Chicago for the Army–Navy Game to \"write newspaper articles about it, as well as select an All-America football team.\" Carnegie Tech used the coach's absence as motivation for a 19–0 win; the upset likely cost the Irish a chance for a national title.[55] The 1928 team lost to national champion Georgia Tech.[56] \"I sat at Grant Field and saw a magnificent Notre Dame team suddenly recoil before the furious pounding of one man–Peter Pund,\" said Rockne. \"Nobody could stop him. I counted 20 scoring plays that this man ruined.\"[57] Among the events that occurred during Rockne's tenure none may be more famous than the Rockne's \"Win one for the Gipper\" speech.[58] Army came into the 1928 matchup undefeated and was the clear favorite.[59] Notre Dame, on the other hand, was having their worst season under Rockne's leadership and entered the game with a 4–2 record.[59] At the end of the half Army was leading and looked to be in command of the game. Rockne entered the locker room and gave his account of Gipp's final words: \"I've got to go, Rock. It's all right. I'm not afraid. Some time, Rock, when the team is up against it, when things are going wrong and the breaks are beating the boys, tell them to go in there with all they've got and win just one for the Gipper. I don't know where I'll be then, Rock. But I'll know about it, and I'll be happy.\"[60] The speech inspired the team and they went on to upset Army and win the game 12–6.[61] The 1929 and 1930 teams both went undefeated,[62][63] winning national championships,[64][65] and the 1930 team was led by the likes of Frank Carideo, Joe Savoldi, Marchy Schwartz and Marty Brill.[65] It featured the first and only example of all four members of a backfield being named to an All-American team during the same season. The 1929 team played all of its games on the road while the new Notre Dame Stadium was being built.[66] In 1930, \"Jumping Joe\" Savoldi scored the first Notre Dame touchdown in the new stadium on a 98-yard kickoff return.[67] Savoldi is also known as \"the first hero in the lore of Notre Dame's Stadium\" based on scoring three touchdowns in the official stadium dedication game against Navy the following week.[68] Rockne coached his last game on December 14, 1930, when he led a group of Notre Dame all-stars against the New York Giants in New York City.[69][70] The game raised funds for the Mayor's Relief Committee for the unemployed and needy of the city.[71] 50,000 fans turned out to see the reunited \"Four Horsemen\" along with players from Rockne's other championship teams take the field against the pros.[72] On March 31, 1931, Rockne died at age 43 in the crash of a Transcontinental & Western Air airliner in Kansas; he was on his way to help in the production of the film The Spirit of Notre Dame.[73][74][75] The crash site is located in a remote expanse of Kansas known as the Flint Hills and now features a Rockne Memorial.[76] As Notre Dame's head coach from 1918 to 1930, Rockne posted what has remained for decades the all-time highest winning percentage (.881) for a football coach in the NCAA's flagship FBS division.[77][78] During his 13-year tenure as head coach of the Fighting Irish, Rockne collected 105 victories, 12 losses, 5 ties and 3 national championships.[79][80] Rockne also coached Notre Dame to 5 undefeated and untied seasons.[79][80] Through game broadcasts during the Golden Age of Radio, Notre Dame football gained a nationwide following of \"subway alumni\", Catholics who became fans whether or not they attended the university.[81] Former Saint Louis head coach Heartley \"Hunk\" Anderson was promoted from assistant coach and took the helm of the Irish after Knute Rockne's death, leading them to a record of 16 wins, nine losses, and two ties.[82] Anderson was a former Irish player under Rockne and was serving as an assistant coach at the time of Rockne's death. Notre Dame finished 6–2–1 in 1931.[83] The Irish lost a heartbreaker by a score of 16–14 to USC on November 21 that snapped the program's 26-game unbeaten streak.[84] 1933 was a tough year for the Irish as they finished with a 3–5–2 record, the first losing season for the program since 1888. ND suffered a four-game losing streak, failing to score a point in all four losses to Carnegie Tech, Pittsburgh, Navy, and Purdue.[85] Anderson resigned as Irish head coach after the 1933 season to accept the position of head football coach at NC State.[86] Anderson was replaced by Elmer Layden, who was one of Rockne's \"Four Horsemen\" in the 1920s. After graduating, Layden played professional football for one year and then began a coaching career.[87] Layden's 1935 squad posted one of the greatest wins in school history by rallying to defeat Ohio State by a score of 18–13 in a game billed as the \"Game of the Century\".[88][89] His 1938 team finished 8–1, losing only to USC in the season finale.[90] This loss cost them a possible consensus national championship, but the team was named national champion by the Dickinson System.[91] Like Rockne before him, Layden was a goodwill ambassador for Notre Dame during his time as head coach.[92][93] He was able to schedule a home-and-home series with Michigan after meeting with Fielding H. Yost, healing a rift between the two schools.[94] The two teams had not met since 1909, when, after eight straight losses to the Wolverines, the Irish posted their first win.[95][96] They were scheduled to meet again in 1910, but Michigan canceled the game and refused to play the Irish again.[96] By the time they met again in 1943, Layden had left Notre Dame and Frank Leahy had taken his place.[96] The Irish posted a record of 47 wins, 13 losses, and three ties in seven years under Layden,[97] the most successful record of a Notre Dame coach not to win a national championship.[98] He left Notre Dame after the 1940 season to become Commissioner of the National Football League.[98][87] Boston College head coach Frank Leahy was hired by Notre Dame to take over for Layden in 1941 and was another former Irish player who played during the Rockne era. After graduating from Notre Dame, Leahy held several coaching positions, including line coach of the Seven Blocks of Granite of Fordham University that helped that team win all but two of their games between 1935 and 1937.[99] He then coached the Boston College Eagles to a win in the 1941 Sugar Bowl and a share of the national championship.[100][101] His move to Notre Dame began a new period of gridiron success for the Irish and ensured Leahy's place among the winningest coaches in the history of college football.[102] Leahy coached the team for 11 seasons from 1941 to 1943 and 1946 to 1953.[99] After finishing in the AP top 10 each of his first two seasons, Leahy's 1943 team went 9–1 and captured Notre Dame's fourth national championship (and first since the advent of the AP Poll). Quarterback Angelo Bertelli became Notre Dame's first Heisman Trophy winner. From 1944 to 1945, Leahy served in the U.S. Navy during World War II and was honorably discharged as a captain.[103] Edward McKeever, Leahy's assistant coach, became interim head coach when Leahy left for the Navy.[104] During 1944, his one year at the helm, the Irish managed 8 wins and 2 losses.[105] McKeever left Notre Dame in 1945 to take over as head coach of Cornell.[106] For the 1945 season, he was replaced by Hugh Devore, who led the Irish to a 7–2–1 record.[107] Upon Leahy's return in 1946 and due to his status as a veteran himself, the Irish heavily recruited returning veterans who were often much older than incoming freshmen. Largely thanks to this influx of talent, Notre Dame went four consecutive seasons after World War II without losing a game, winning the 1946, 1947, and 1949 national championships in the process.[108] The 1946 game against Army, ending in a 0–0 tie, pitted two of the greatest teams of all time against each other and included three consecutive Heisman Trophy winners (Army's Doc Blanchard and Glenn Davis and Notre Dame's Johnny Lujack, who quarterbacked the 1946 and 1947 Irish). The 1948 team missed out on a national championship due only to a 14–14 tie at USC in the final game of the season. In 1949, Notre Dame went unbeaten and untied for the second time in three seasons behind Heisman Trophy-winning end Leon Hart, who would later be selected first overall in the 1950 NFL Draft. A fifth national championship was lost because of a 1953 tie against Iowa, in a game that featured 1953 Heisman Trophy winner Johnny Lattner[109] that caused a minor scandal at the time, when it appeared that some Irish players had faked injuries to stop the clock, leading some to nickname those players the \"Fainting Irish\".[110][111][112] Leahy retired in 1954 reportedly due to health issues.[113] Perhaps the best example of this occurred during the Georgia Tech game in 1953. Leahy fell ill during the game, which led to him collapsing during halftime.[114][self-published source] The situation was so dire that a priest was called in to give Leahy Catholic last rites.[115] However, Leahy recovered, and the consequent diagnosis was that he was suffering from nervous tension and pancreatitis.[116] Leahy has the second highest winning percentage (.864) of any college coach in history. He led the Irish to a record of 87 wins, 11 losses, and nine ties including 39 consecutive games without a loss (37–0–2), four national championships, and six undefeated seasons.[102][117] The departure of Frank Leahy ushered in a downward slope in Notre Dame's performance.[118] 25-year old assistant coach Terry Brennan was hired as Frank Leahy's successor as the Notre Dame head coach in 1954 and would stay until 1958. Brennan was a former player under Leahy. Before joining the Irish, he had coached the Mount Carmel High School team in Chicago.[119] His first two seasons the Irish were ranked fourth and ninth respectively in the AP poll, with a loss to Purdue the only blemish on the 1954 team's schedule.[119][120] It was the 1956 season that began to darken Brennan's reputation, for it became one of the most dismal in the team's history and saw them finish the season with a mere two wins, including losses to Michigan State, Oklahoma, and Iowa.[121] One bright spot in the 1956 season was the awarding of the Heisman Trophy to Paul Hornung, who would go on to a legendary NFL career with the Green Bay Packers. Hornung is the only Heisman winner to win the award while playing for a team that had a losing record.[122] The Irish would recover the following season, posting a record of 7–3[123] and including in their wins a stunning upset of Oklahoma, in Norman, Oklahoma, that ended the Sooners' still-standing record of 47 consecutive wins.[124] In Brennan's final season, though, the Irish finished 6–4,[125] leading to Brennan's firing in mid-December.[126] Brennan's tenure can only be properly framed with the understanding that in a time of zero scholarship limitations in college football, Notre Dame's administration inexplicably began a process of de-emphasizing football, severely cutting scholarships and hindering Brennan from building a roster of any meaningful depth.[127] He departed with a total of 32 wins and 18 losses.[128] Former San Francisco, Chicago Cardinals and Washington Redskins head coach Joe Kuharich took the head coaching position at Notre Dame in 1959, realizing a longtime ambition to return to his alma mater.[129][130] He had earlier been courted by Notre Dame after the 1956 season, after the Irish finished 2–8, but before he had a chance to accept an offer, Terry Brennan was given a reprieve.[131] Kuharich brought a professional touch to Irish football, putting shamrocks on the players' helmets and shoulder stripes on their jerseys.[131][132] However, his tenure became one of the worst stretches in program history, including a school-record eight-game losing streak in 1960, a year in which the Irish finished 2–8.[133] The consensus opinion was that Kuharich never made the adjustment from pro football to college football, attempting to use complicated pro coaching techniques with collegiate players, and never adapted to the limited substitution rules in effect at the time, having big, immobile linemen playing both ways in an era where smaller, quicker players were preferred. He often said, \"You win some and you lose some\", and seemed perfectly content finishing 5–5 every year. This did not sit well with the Irish faithful, who expected Notre Dame to beat everybody.[134] When the pressure of winning became too much to bear, Kuharich resigned in the spring of 1963 and assumed the post of supervisor of NFL officials.[131] Because it was so late in the spring, the freshman team's coach Hugh Devore was named head coach for the 1963 season while the search for a permanent replacement was being conducted.[135] Kuharich compiled a 17–23 record over four non-winning seasons and remains to this day the only coach ever to have an overall losing record at Notre Dame. Despite his unsuccessful tenure, Kuharich remains the only Irish coach to post back-to-back shutouts over their greatest rival, the USC Trojans, in 1960 (17–0) and 1961 (30–0).[136] In 1964, Ara Parseghian left his job as the Northwestern head football coach when he was hired to take over the coaching duties at Notre Dame.[137] He immediately brought the team back to a level of success in Irish football history that was comparable only to Rockne and Leahy. These three coaches have an 80% or greater winning percentage while at Notre Dame – Rockne at .881, Leahy at .864, and Parseghian at .836. Parseghian's teams never won fewer than seven nor lost more than three games during the ten-game regular seasons of the era.[138] In his first year, the Irish improved their record to 9–1 behind Heisman Trophy-winning quarterback John Huarte, but they lost any hope for a national championship in the last game of the season at USC when Craig Fertig connected with a touchdown pass to Rod Sherman.[139] Parseghian earned coach of the year honors from the American Football Coaches Association, the Football Writers Association, and The Sporting News, as well as several others, and a cover story in Time magazine.[140][141] The 1966 team did finish unbeaten, finishing #1 in the AP Poll and winning the national championship in the process. The Irish had six shutout wins, each by 30 or more points. This includes a season-ending 51-0 win at #10 USC, the largest margin of victory by either side in the rivalry's history. This season is most remembered for a 10–10 tie at #2 Michigan State in the \"Game of the Century\" in which the injury-plagued Irish played for a tie rather than risking a loss.[142] It was under Parseghian as well that Notre Dame lifted its 40-plus year-old \"no bowl games\" policy,[143] beginning with the season of 1969, after which the Irish played the #1 Texas Longhorns in the Cotton Bowl Classic, losing in the final minutes in a closely contested game.[144] The following year, Parseghian's 9–1 squad[145] ended Texas' Southwest Conference record 30-game winning streak in the Cotton Bowl.[144] In 1971, Cliff Brown became the first African-American quarterback to start a game for the program.[146] The Irish returned to glory by winning Parseghian's second national championship in 1973, sweeping through their regular-season schedule 10–0 and defeating #1 Alabama 24-23 in the Sugar Bowl by taking advantage of a fourth-quarter missed extra point by the Crimson Tide. Due to health issues, Parseghian was forced to retire from coaching after another bowl win over Alabama to conclude the 1974 season.[147] During Parseghian's eleven-year career, the Irish amassed a record of 95–17–4 and captured two national championships. The Irish finished in the AP Top 10 nine times and never ranked lower than #14 at the end of a season. Parseghian was also named coach of the year by several selectors in his national championship years of 1966 and 1973 and was inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame in 1980.[148][149] Dan Devine was hired to take over as head coach upon Parseghian's retirement from Notre Dame in 1975.[150] Devine was already a highly successful coach and had led Arizona State, Missouri, and the NFL's Green Bay Packers.[150] Devine had been a leading candidate for the head coaching job at Notre Dame in 1964, when Ara Parseghian was hired.[151] When approached for the job following Parseghian's resignation, Devine accepted immediately, joking that it was probably the shortest job interview in history.[152] When he arrived at Notre Dame he already had a college coaching record of 120 wins, 40 losses, and eight ties and had led his teams to victory in four bowl games.[153] At Notre Dame he would lead the Irish to 53 wins, 16 losses, and a tie as well as three bowl victories.[153] His lasting achievement came midway through this run, when the 1977 Notre Dame team won the national championship, led by junior quarterback Joe Montana.[154] Before the game against USC, played at home on October 22, Devine changed the team's jerseys from navy blue & white to kelly green & gold, later known as the \"green jersey game\", resulting in a 49–19 victory over the Trojans.[155] The Irish continued to wear green for the rest of Devine's tenure at the school.[155] The championship season climaxed with a 38–10 win in the 1978 Cotton Bowl Classic over previously top-ranked Texas, led by Heisman Trophy winner Earl Campbell.[156] The win vaulted the Irish from fifth to first in the polls. The following season, the Irish lost their first two games including a shocking 3–0 loss to Missouri in South Bend, but would recover to finish the regular season 8–3 and earn a berth in the Cotton Bowl against Houston. The Irish used three Montana touchdowns (two passing, one rushing) to recover from a 22-point deficit in the fourth quarter and win 35–34, the largest fourth-quarter comeback in college football history at the time. The game became known as the \"Chicken Soup Game\" after Montana ate a bowl of chicken soup at halftime while battling the flu.[157] The 1979 and 1980 Irish did not live up to the standards set by earlier Devine teams, although the former season did see Vagas Ferguson set the single-season program rushing record (1,437 yards) that still stands today. Because he had the unenviable task of following a legend, Devine came under heavy scrutiny while at Notre Dame and it was felt that he was never fully embraced by the Notre Dame community, despite winning a national championship.[158] After a 5–2 start in his first season, rumors of incompetence were circulated and that Devine would be dismissed and replaced by Don Shula or even Ara Parseghian (who went so far as to say he would not return to Notre Dame under any circumstances).[159] Even on the day of the 1977 USC game, \"Dump Devine\" bumper stickers were being sold outside Notre Dame Stadium.[159] On August 15, 1980, Devine announced that he would be leaving Notre Dame at the end of season, saying he wanted to be able to spend more time with his wife.[158] Gerry Faust was a surprise choice when hired to replace Devine in 1981.[160] Prior to Notre Dame, Faust had been one of the more successful high school football coaches in the country. As coach of Moeller High School in Cincinnati he amassed a 174–17–2 record over 19 seasons.[161] Many of his players had gone on to play for Notre Dame; indeed, when he arrived in South Bend, he was reunited with nine of his former players from Moeller. Despite his success in the high school ranks, Faust's success at Notre Dame was mixed. In his first season, the Irish finished 5–6.[162] In Faust's second season, Notre Dame improved slightly to 6–4–1.[163] The most successful years under Faust were the 1983 and 1984 campaigns where the Irish finished 7–5 and made trips to the Liberty Bowl and Aloha Bowl respectively.[164][165] His final record at Notre Dame was 30–26–1.[166] To avoid being fired, Faust resigned at the end of the 1985 season.[167][168] He announced his resignation prior to the final game of the year, where Notre Dame suffered a humiliating 58–7 loss at Miami; Allen Pinkett scored the Irish TD. Faust proceeded to take over as head coach at Akron.[169] Lou Holtz had 17 years of head coaching experience by the time he was hired to lead the Irish.[170] He had previously been head coach of William & Mary, North Carolina State, the NFL's New York Jets, Arkansas, and Minnesota.[170] In contrast to Faust, Holtz was well known as a master motivator and a strict disciplinarian.[171][172] The tone was set with Holtz's first meeting with his team as Irish head coach in 1986, immediately demanding his players sit up straight in their chairs and look him in the eye as he spoke.[173] Holtz began in 1986 where his predecessor left off in 1985, finishing with an identical record of 5–6.[174] However, unlike the 1985 squad, which was generally outcoached and outplayed, Holtz's 1986 edition was competitive in nearly every game, losing five out of those six games by a combined total of 14 points. That would be his only losing season as he posted a record of 95–24–2 over the next ten seasons adding up to a 100–30–2 record overall.[175][176] In 1987, Holtz led the Irish to an 8–4 record.[177] Notre Dame's best player was star wide receiver Tim Brown, who would win the Heisman Trophy that season and is Notre Dame's seventh and most recent Heisman winner.[178][179] The 1988 campaign began with high hopes, as former Notre Dame coaches Rockne, Leahy, Parseghian, and Devine all won their first national championship in their third season with the program. The Irish defeated their first five opponents, ascending to the #4 ranking in the lead-up to a visit from the reigning national champion Miami Hurricanes. In a game which became known as Catholics vs. Convicts due to a popular T-shirt design on Notre Dame's campus, the Irish upset the Hurricanes 31–30 when Pat Terrell knocked down Steve Walsh's two-point conversion attempt with no time on the clock. When star players Ricky Watters and Tony Brooks showed up late for dinner right before the then top-ranked Irish played second-ranked USC in the final regular season game of 1988,[180] in a controversial move, Holtz took his 10–0 Irish squad to Los Angeles without them.[181] His move was vindicated when the Irish defeated USC anyway.[182] Holtz was named national coach of the year,[170] and a win over No. 3 West Virginia in the Fiesta Bowl captured the Irish's 11th-all time national championship.[183] 1988 remains Notre Dame's most recent undefeated season and national championship.[184][185] In 1989, Holtz led the Irish to a 12–1 record. The Irish began the season in the Kickoff Classic game in East Rutherford, New Jersey, against Virginia.[186] The Irish won by a score of 36–13 and ascended to the #1 spot in the AP Poll.[187] Next, top-ranked Notre Dame defeated #2 Michigan by a score of 24–19.[188] After nine more consecutive victories to begin the season 11–0, the Irish would lose to #7 Miami in the final week of the season, ending Notre Dame's 23-game winning streak.[189] Holtz would lead the Irish to a victory in the Orange Bowl over #1 Colorado to end the season, finishing #2 in the AP poll behind Miami.[190] After beginning the 1990 season with a #1 ranking and a victory over #4 Michigan by a score of 28–24 and two more wins for a 3–0 start, the Irish took their first loss of the season, losing to Stanford by a score of 36–31. The Irish would ascend back to #1 on the strength of a home win over #2 Miami, a game that saw the end of the series between the two until 2010.[191] However, late-season losses to Penn State and Colorado in the Orange Bowl would eliminate the Irish from national championship contention.[192] The 1991 Fighting Irish began the season 8-1, but lost back-to-back games for the first time since 1987 when they again lost to Penn State. The Irish would receive a berth in the Sugar Bowl in New Orleans, Louisiana, where they defeated Florida by a score of 39–28.[193][194] In 1992, Notre Dame finished 10–1–1. After defeating Northwestern to start the season,[195] the Fighting Irish tied #5 Michigan, their first tie of the Holtz era.[196] This season saw the Irish's largest win in history against Purdue, a 48–0 win at Notre Dame Stadium, and a 28–3 Cotton Bowl against previously unbeaten #4 Texas A&M.[197][198] The Irish enjoyed another successful season in 1993, finishing the season at 11–1. After scoring 27 points in wins over Northwestern and #2 Michigan to start the season, the Irish defeated their next six opponents to enter a matchup with undefeated #1 Florida State 8–0 and ranked just behind the Seminoles at #2. For the first time, ESPN's College GameDay decided to make a visit to campus to host the show live on Saturday morning.[199] In a classic, the Irish defeated the Seminoles 31–24, ascending to the #1 ranking a day later. However, a loss to #17 Boston College on a game-winning field goal as time expired by a score of 41–39 ended the Irish's national championship aspirations.[200] The Irish would face a rematch with #6 Texas A&M in the Cotton Bowl to finish the season, a game the Irish won by a score of 24–21.[201][202] Controversially, Notre Dame finished #2 in the AP poll behind a team in Florida State it had beaten. In 1994, Holtz led Notre Dame to a 6–5–1 record, the Irish's worst record since Holtz's first season in 1986.[203] The team lost three of four games midseason to drop out of the rankings for the first time since 1986. The Irish would improve to 9–3 in 1995, but lost to #8 Florida State in the Orange Bowl.[204][205] Lou Holtz's final season at Notre Dame in 1996 resulted in an 8–3 record. The season notably saw Notre Dame's first participation in the Emerald Isle Classic in Ireland, a 54–27 win over Navy, and an overtime loss to USC, snapping the Irish's 13-game non-losing streak against the Trojans.[206][207] Holtz's option offense, which helped catapult Notre Dame to many victories in the late 1980s and early 1990s, also helped rack up impressive recruiting classes. During the 1989 season, Holtz had the following future NFL players on offense: QB Rick Mirer, RB Ricky Watters, RB Anthony Johnson, RB Rodney Culver RB Dorsey Levens, and WR Raghib Ismail. In 1990, he added RB Jeff Burris (who would later move to safety), FB Jerome Bettis and TE Irv Smith. 1991 saw the additions of RB Reggie Brooks and FB Ray Zellars. 1992 saw the addition of WR Derrick Mayes. For 1993, he added FB Marc Edwards. In 1995, he added RB Autry Denson. From the 1987–1995 NFL Drafts, there were a total of 65 Notre Dame players selected.[208] Overall, Holtz took Notre Dame to one undefeated season, nine consecutive New Year's Day bowl games, and top 10 finishes in the AP poll in five seasons,[209] as well as overseeing the majority of the longest winning streak against USC in program history (11 games). Holtz retired from Notre Dame following the 1996 season,[210] but would unretire in 1999 to accept the head coaching position at South Carolina where he would serve until the completion of the 2004 season.[211][212] Bob Davie, who had been Holtz's defensive coordinator from 1994 to 1996, was promoted to head coach when Holtz retired.[213] Davie, who turned down a head coaching offer from Purdue to accept the Irish's head coaching position,[214] was a well-respected defensive mind who had also served as defensive coordinator at Tulane and Texas A&M.[215] Davie had also filled in as head coach for one game during the 1995 season when Lou Holtz was dealing with a health issue.[216] One of his first major decisions was to fire long-time offensive line coach Joe Moore, who then successfully sued the university for age discrimination.[217] On Davie's watch, the team suffered three bowl game losses (1997 Independence Bowl,[218] 1999 Gator Bowl,[219] and 2001 Fiesta Bowl),[220] and it failed to qualify for a bowl game in two others (1999 and 2001). The highlight of Davie's tenure was a 36–20 upset win in 1998 over #5 Michigan, the defending national champions.[221][222] On December 17, 1999, Notre Dame was placed on probation by the NCAA. The association's Committee on Infractions found two series of violations. The New York Times reported \"the main one involved the actions of a booster, Kimberly Dunbar, who lavished gifts on football players with money she later pleaded guilty to embezzling.\" In the second series of events, a football player was accused of trying to sell several complimentary game tickets and of using others as repayment of a loan. The player was also said \"to have been romantically involved with a woman (not Dunbar), a part-time tutor at the university, who wrote a term paper for another player for a small fee and provided players with meals, lodging and gifts.\"[223] The Dunbar violation began while Lou Holtz was head coach: \"According to the NCAA committee report, Dunbar, the woman at the center of the more serious violations, had become romantically involved with several Notre Dame football players from June 1995 to January 1998 and had a child with one, Jarvis Edison.\"[223] Notre Dame was placed on probation for two years and lost one of its 85 football scholarships each year in what the Times termed \"minor\" penalties.[223][224] Davie nearly defeated top-ranked Nebraska in 2000, with the Irish comeback bid falling short in overtime 27–24.[225] The aforementioned 2001 Fiesta Bowl was Notre Dame's first invitation to the Bowl Championship Series. The Irish lost by 32 points to Oregon State,[226] but would finish No. 15 in the AP Poll, Davie's highest ranking as head coach. Despite Davie's rocky tenure, new athletic director Kevin White gave the coach a contract extension following the 2000 season,[227] then saw the team start 0–3 in 2001 – the first such start in school history.[228] Disappointed by the on-field results, coupled with the Joe Moore and Kim Dunbar scandals, the administration decided to dismiss Davie after the 2001 season.[229] His final record at Notre Dame was 35–25.[230] On December 9, 2001, Notre Dame hired George O'Leary, the head coach at Georgia Tech, to replace Davie.[231] However, while researching a story on O'Leary, New Hampshire Union Leader reporter Jim Fennell uncovered misrepresentations in O'Leary's resume that had influenced the administration's decision to hire him.[232] The resulting media scandal embarrassed Notre Dame officials and tainted O'Leary; he resigned five days later, before coaching a single practice, recruiting a single player, or hiring a single assistant coach.[233] O'Leary's tenure is the shortest of any head coach in FBS history.[234] O'Leary would go on to become the head football coach at the University of Central Florida.[235] Once again in need of a new head coach, the school turned to Tyrone Willingham, the head coach at Stanford.[236] Willingham's hiring made him the first African American head coach in Notre Dame football history.[237] Bringing a feeling of change and excitement to campus, Willingham led the 2002 squad to a 10–2 regular season record, including an 8–0 start with wins over #7 Michigan and #11 Florida State, and a #4 ranking. This great early start, however, would be the lone highlight of Willingham's tenure, as Notre Dame finished the year with a loss to Boston College, then lopsided losses to USC and North Carolina State in the Gator Bowl.[238] The program faltered over the next two seasons under Willingham, compiling an 11–12 record.[239] During this time, Notre Dame lost a game by at least 30 points on five occasions. Furthermore, Willingham's 2004 recruiting class was judged by analysts to be the worst at Notre Dame in more than two decades.[240] Citing Notre Dame's third consecutive four-touchdown loss to arch-rival USC[241] compounded by another year of subpar recruiting efforts, the Willingham era ended on November 30, 2004 (after the conclusion of the 2004 season) when the university chose to terminate him and pay out the remainder of Willingham's six-year contract.[242] After Willingham's firing, Notre Dame initially pursued Utah head coach Urban Meyer, who had been an Irish assistant from 1996 to 2000 and had a clause in his Utah contract that stated he could take the Notre Dame head coaching job without paying a buyout.[243][244] After Meyer accepted the Florida head coaching position and turned down the Irish,[245] Charlie Weis left the NFL's New England Patriots, where he won three Super Bowls as offensive coordinator,[246] to become head football coach for the Irish beginning with the 2005 season.[247] A first-time head coach when he was hired by Notre Dame,[248] Weis was officially introduced on December 12, 2004.[249] Weis' hiring as the Irish's 30th head football coach made him the first Notre Dame graduate to hold the football head coaching position on a full-fledged basis since Joe Kuharich.[250] Weis signed a six-year contract worth about $2 million annually excluding incentives.[251][252][253] To kick off his inaugural season, Weis led the Irish to back-to-back road wins over ranked teams, the first time that had been done by a Notre Dame coach since Knute Rockne. On September 25, Weis and the Irish traveled to Seattle to face Washington and former head coach Tyrone Willingham, who was hired by the Huskies to be their head coach two weeks after getting fired at Notre Dame.[254] The Irish won by a score of 36–17.[255] Entering the rivalry game with USC, defending national champions and owners of a 27-game winning streak, the Irish had risen to #9 in the AP Poll. In one of the most famous games in the rivalry's history, USC defeated Notre Dame 34–31. The game is most remembered for Trojan running back and eventual Heisman winner Reggie Bush, who had already scored three touchdowns that day, illegally pushing quarterback Matt Leinart into the end zone on the final play of the game, in a play now known as the \"Bush Push\". The Irish won their remaining five games to earn an appearance in the Fiesta Bowl. There, they were defeated by the Ohio State Buckeyes 34–20[256] to finish the season 9–3 and #9 in the AP poll, their highest final ranking since 1993. Quarterback Brady Quinn broke numerous team passing records that season and became a top Heisman Trophy contender.[257] Wide receiver Jeff Samardzija was the team's leading receiver and also broke Notre Dame's single-season records for receiving yards and touchdowns.[258] During the 2005 season, Notre Dame signed Weis to a big raise and ten-year contract extension that was set to keep the coach in South Bend through the 2015 season.[259][260] Weis and the Irish went into the 2006 season with a No. 2 preseason ranking in the ESPN/Coaches Poll.[261] They finished the regular season with a 10–2 record, losing only to Michigan and USC. Notre Dame accepted a bid to the 2007 Sugar Bowl, losing to LSU 41–14. This marked their ninth consecutive postseason loss, the longest drought in NCAA history.[262] As a result, Notre Dame dropped to #17 in the final rankings.[263][264] In the wake of a graduating class that sent eleven players to the NFL,[265] the 2007 season included various negative milestones: the most losses in a single year (9);[266] two of the ten worst losses in program history (38–0 losses to both Michigan[267] and USC);[268] and the first 6-game losing streak for home games.[269] The Naval Academy recorded their first win over the Irish since 1963, breaking Notre Dame's NCAA-record 43-game win streak.[270] In 2008, the Irish started 4–1, but completed the regular season with a 6–6 record,[271] including a 24–23 home loss to Syracuse, the first time that Notre Dame had fallen to an eight-loss team.[272] Quarterback Jimmy Clausen was the team's star player, completing over 60% of his passes.[273][274] Despite speculation the university might fire Weis, it was announced he would remain head coach.[275] Weis's Notre Dame squad ended the season breaking the Irish's NCAA bowl losing streak by beating Hawaii, 49–21, in the Hawaii Bowl.[276] Weis entered the 2009 season with the expectation from the Notre Dame administration that his team would be in position to compete for a BCS Bowl berth.[277] Notre Dame started the first part of the season 4–2, with close losses to Michigan and USC. Sitting at 6–2, however, Notre Dame lost to Navy for the second time in three years,[278] which became the first loss in a four-game losing streak to finish the season. Quarterback Jimmy Clausen and wide receiver Golden Tate would forgo their senior seasons and enter the NFL Draft.[279] Weis was fired on November 30, 2009.[280] According to Weis' buyout, he was to be paid $6 million then $2.05 million annually until the contract ran out in December 2015 for a total of about $19 million.[281] During that time, Weis made more money annually not to coach the Irish than his successor, Brian Kelly, made to coach the team.[282] On December 10, 2009, Cincinnati head coach Brian Kelly became the 31st head coach of the Fighting Irish after leading the Bearcats to a 12–0 record and BCS bowl-game berth, but he left the team before the bowl game.[283][284] Kelly's hiring surprised very few as he was a northern Irish Catholic who was considered one of college football's rising stars.[285] In his first season, Kelly led the Fighting Irish to an 8–5 record.[286] Tragedy struck early in the season when Declan Sullivan, a junior working for the athletic department, died while filming a practice on a scissor lift in dangerously high winds.[287] Dayne Crist started the season at quarterback but was injured for a second consecutive year, this time in the Tulsa game, which the Irish lost.[288] Kelly turned to freshman quarterback Tommy Rees, who led the Irish to victories in the last three games against #15 Utah, Army in Yankee Stadium, and breaking an eight-year losing streak to USC in the LA Coliseum. Kelly guided the Irish to a 33–17 win over Miami (FL) in the 2010 Sun Bowl to finish 2010 with an 8–5 record.[289] With senior wideout Michael Floyd returning for his senior season and an outstanding recruiting class that included several highly touted defensive linemen,[290] Kelly and the Irish looked to improve on their 8–5 record from the prior year. However, an early season upset to a Skip Holtz-led South Florida team and a last-second loss to Michigan in Ann Arbor, games in which the Irish committed 10 total turnovers, left the Irish at 0–2 to start the season. The Irish bounced back to beat #15 Michigan State and had two 4-game winning streaks, with the only loss during that stretch coming at the hands of USC.[291] The Irish also broke Navy's 2-game winning streak over Notre Dame. Notre Dame lost 18–14 to Florida State in the 2011 Champs Sports Bowl, concluding the 2011 campaign with an 8–5 record overall, identical to the 2010 season.[292] In the team's losses, multiple turnovers from the quarterback position were often the culprit, and as a whole turnovers at critical times in the game often derailed potential Irish comebacks. On September 12, 2012, during the football program's 125th season, Notre Dame announced that it would leave the Big East Conference for the Atlantic Coast Conference, excluding the football and hockey programs.[293] This move became official on July 1, 2013. While the Fighting Irish football team remained an FBS independent, it agreed to play five games per season against ACC teams starting with the 2014 football season. In return, Notre Dame became eligible to participate in the ACC's sub-BCS level bowl arrangements.[294] The 2012 season was another entry in historic third seasons for Notre Dame head coaches. The Irish began the season 7–0, including wins over ranked rivals in Michigan State, Michigan, and Stanford. The game against the Cardinal required a goal-line stand against running back Stepfan Taylor in overtime to preserve the win for the Irish.[295] The season's signature win came at #8 Oklahoma with ESPN's College GameDay in town. On November 18, after a loss by #1 Oregon, Notre Dame became ranked #1 in the nation in both the AP and Coaches' polls after reaching 11–0 during the regular season for the first time since 1993, also ranking #1 in the BCS standings for the first time in the 14-year history of the selection system.[296] After defeating USC on November 24,[297] Notre Dame concluded its first 12–0 regular season, and the Irish were soon formally named to appear in the BCS National Championship Game for the first time. In that game, on January 7, 2013, the Irish lost to Alabama 42–14.[298] The strength of the 2012 Fighting Irish was its defense, captained by senior leader Manti Te'o, who broke the school record for interceptions by a linebacker with 7 and finished second to Johnny Manziel in Heisman Trophy voting. Coming off the previous year's national title game appearance, the Fighting Irish were dealt a blow when 2012 starting quarterback, Everett Golson, was suspended from the University due to an academic violation.[299] Senior Tommy Rees then took over. Notre Dame's 2013 season ended with a record of 9–4,[300] a victory over Rutgers in the Pinstripe Bowl, and a #20 AP poll ranking.[301][302] The 2014 season started off with 6 straight victories and a #5 national ranking heading into a showdown with #2 Florida State in Tallahassee, Florida. FSU won that game 31–27, on a controversial offensive pass interference call that brought back a last-second Notre Dame touchdown. The Fighting Irish bounced back with a win against Navy before dropping their final 4 games of the season. They did win the Music City Bowl by defeating the LSU Tigers and finished the season at an 8–5 record.[303] The 2015 Fighting Irish began its season with another new offensive coordinator, Mike Sanford Jr.[304] Led for most of the year by sophomore quarterback DeShone Kizer, the Irish had fourteen plays of over 50 yards during the season, which was a school record, including two touchdowns of over 90 yards (a 91-yard touchdown run by C. J. Prosise and a 98-yard touchdown run by Josh Adams). The Irish only had two in the previous 126 years of Notre Dame football. They finished the regular season averaging 34 points per game, including a 62-point effort against UMass, the most points in a game since 1996. The Irish began the season 10–1 and were in position for a College Football Playoff appearance, but lost a last-second game to Stanford to finish with a 10–2 record and a berth in the Fiesta Bowl.[305] Star linebacker Jaylon Smith was injured early in the game which became a loss to Ohio State.[306] The 2016 season ended with a 4–8 record, Brian Kelly's worst win–loss record at Notre Dame. The tone for the season was set early, with a heartbreaking double overtime loss to Texas in the season opener.[307] Just 4 games into the season, Brian Kelly fired defensive coordinator Brian VanGorder.[308] At the end of the season, starting quarterback DeShone Kizer declared for the NFL Draft[309] and backup quarterback Malik Zaire announced he would be transferring in the winter after graduation.[310][311] Amidst speculation that Kelly's job was in jeopardy and that Kelly was looking to leave Notre Dame, athletics director Jack Swarbrick announced that Kelly would return for the 2017 season.[312] The 2017 season was one of Kelly's strongest seasons at ND. An early one-point loss to #2 Georgia was the only blemish on an 8-1 start, keyed by a 49-14 blowout over rival USC. The tough running of running back Josh Adams behind an experienced and talented offensive line, which included future top-10 picks Quenton Nelson and Mike McGlinchey and won the Joe Moore Award as the best offensive line in that nation, allowed Notre Dame to string together 6 consecutive 20+ point victories. However, when #3 Notre Dame visited #7 Miami in South Florida on November 7, an embarrassing 41-8 loss effectively ended the Irish hopes of a playoff run. They ended the season with a win over LSU in the Music City Bowl.[313] The Irish opened the 2018 season at home against Michigan and won, 24–17.[314] After benching quarterback Brandon Wimbush in favor of Ian Book, the Irish then won the remainder of their regular season games, including victories over #7 Stanford, #24 Virginia Tech, #12 Syracuse, and Northwestern.[315] This led to Notre Dame's first undefeated regular season since 2012.[316] They were ranked #3 in the nation by the College Football Playoff committee and selected to play in the College Football Playoff semifinal at the Cotton Bowl against Clemson.[317] Notre Dame's undefeated streak came to an end after losing to the eventual national champions 30–3 to finish the season at 12–1.[318] Kelly was named AP Coach of the Year and Home Depot Coach of the Year for the 2018 season.[319][320] Kelly and the Fighting Irish started off the 2019 season with a #9 ranking in the AP Poll. Notre Dame won their first two games before dropping a 23–17 result to #3 Georgia. Notre Dame won their next three games before dropping a 45–14 game to #19 Michigan. Notre Dame closed out the regular season with victories in their last five games, followed by a win in the Camping World Bowl 33–9 over Iowa State.[321] In response to the COVID-19 pandemic and the cancellation of regular season scheduled games, Notre Dame joined the Atlantic Coast Conference (ACC) in football for a single season in 2020 and played a full slate of conference matches.[322] The Irish won all ten of their games, including a mid-season contest against perennial conference power and top-ranked Clemson. The Fighting Irish defeated the Tigers 47–40 in double overtime. However, Clemson defeated the Irish in a rematch in the ACC Championship Game 34–10. Notre Dame qualified for the College Football Playoff as the #4 seed.[323] In the College Football Playoff Semifinals against Alabama at the Rose Bowl, Notre Dame lost 31–14 to finish with a 10–2 record.[324] In what would become Kelly's final season as head coach in 2021, the Fighting Irish were ranked #9 to begin the season, but struggled in their first two games, beating Florida State 41–38 and Toledo 32–29. Following a 24–13 loss to #7 Cincinnati, Kelly helped lead the Fighting Irish to a seven-game winning streak to finish the regular season 11–1 and earn a berth in the Fiesta Bowl.[325] On November 29, 2021, Kelly resigned as Notre Dame head coach to accept a ten-year, $95 million contract offer to become head coach at LSU.[326] In so doing, Kelly became the first Irish head coach since Thomas A. Barry in 1907 to leave Notre Dame for another coaching job.[327] Kelly left the Irish as the program's all-time winningest head coach.[328][329] On December 3, 2021, Notre Dame's defensive coordinator Marcus Freeman was promoted to the head coaching position to replace Brian Kelly, becoming the 32nd head coach in program history.[330][331] The second African American head coach in the history of the Irish football program, Freeman signed a five-year contract worth $4 million annually excluding incentives.[332][333][334] Freeman took control immediately, coaching the Irish in their Fiesta Bowl loss to Oklahoma State.[335][336] Freeman opened the 2022 season with losses to Ohio State (his alma mater) and Marshall, thus becoming first head coach in Notre Dame history to start his tenure with three losses.[337] He gained his first win the following week against the California.[338][339] Freeman's Irish would go on to finish the regular season ranked 19th with a record of 8-4, including an upset win over No. 5 Clemson.[340][341] They were awarded a berth in the Gator Bowl where they defeated South Carolina 45–38.[342][343] For the 2023 season, Freeman guided the Notre Dame program to a 10-win season. Safety Xavier Watts received the Bronko Nagurski Trophy for college football's best defensive player and the team earned victories over #17 Duke, #10 USC and #19 Oregon State in the Sun Bowl. Notre Dame finished the year ranked #14 in the final AP Top 25. Freeman and the Fighting Irish held their first home game of the 2024 season against the Northern Illinois Huskies as the #5 ranked team in the AP Top 25 and as a 28.5-point favorite to win. They fell to the Huskies 16-14, throwing two interceptions and giving up two blocked field goals. It was the second early-season home loss for the Irish against a heavy underdog in three years (following the 2022 loss to Marshall), was the first-ever win by a Mid-American Conference football program against a top 5 team, the first-ever Huskie win against a top 10 team, and one of the largest point-spread upsets in modern college football.[344] The Irish went on to complete the regular season 11-1 and hosted a home game in the first year of the expanded college football playoffs, in which they beat the Indiana Hoosiers 27-17. They then beat the Georgia Bulldogs on Jan 2, by a score of 23-10. Notre Dame's 11 claimed national championships are: Following its appearance in the 1925 Rose Bowl, Notre Dame did not play in a post-season game for 44 consecutive years (1925–1968), including after many of the team's most successful seasons from the Rockne era in the 1920s and the Leahy era in the 1940s. The university's stated reasons for its self-imposed hiatus were that bowl games were \"glorified exhibitions\" that played no part in national championship selections and that they extended the season too far to the detriment of players' academic progress.[351] Notre Dame has made 874 appearances in the Associated Press poll over 71 seasons. Notre Dame has spent 591 weeks in the Top 10, 318 weeks in the Top 5, and 98 weeks at No. 1.[352] Notre Dame has finished the year ranked in the final Associated Press poll of the season 56 times: Notre Dame has participated in eleven \"No. 1 vs No. 2\" matchups since the AP poll began in 1936.[369] They have a record of 5–3–2 in such games, with a 4–1–1 record as the No. 1 team in such matchups. Here's a list of such games: Notre Dame has played in many regular season games that have been widely regarded by both the media[370] and sports historians[371] as historic or famous games. Notre Dame has played in many games labeled \"Game of the Century\" as well as several No. 1 vs No. 2 matchups.[372] Notre Dame has also played in several bowl games considered by many sportswriters to be among the best bowl games played:[384][385] Notre Dame's all-time record after the 2023 season stands at 948 wins, 338 losses, and 42 ties. † George O'Leary did not coach a single practice or game, resigning five days after being hired for misrepresenting his academic credentials.‡ Kent Baer served as interim head coach for one game at the 2004 Insight Bowl after Tyrone Willingham was fired. Notre Dame has made 44 bowl game appearances, winning 22 and losing 21, with one game vacated.[387] After an initial appearance in a postseason contest in the 1925 Rose Bowl, the Fighting Irish refused to participate in bowl games for more than four decades;[388] Sports Illustrated's Dan Jenkins speculated that Notre Dame might have gone to as many as twenty bowl games during the self-imposed forty-five-year hiatus.[388] From 1994 to the 2006 football seasons, Notre Dame lost 9 consecutive bowl games, tied with Northwestern for the most in NCAA history. That streak ended with a 49–21 win over Hawaii in the 2008 Hawaii Bowl. In the process, Notre Dame scored its highest point total in postseason play. The record of 9 consecutive bowl losses was later tied by Northwestern in 2011, then that streak was snapped a year later. The Fighting Irish suffered in a multi-decade skid with an 0-8 record in BCS/Playoff games and an 0-10 record in major bowl games between 1994 and 2025. The losing streak would come to an end when Notre Dame beat Georgia in the 2025 Sugar Bowl. Between 2009 and 2016, and resuming again in 2018, Notre Dame has hosted an annual off-site home football game known as the Shamrock Series. The series promotes Notre Dame's athletic and academic brand, and has brought the Fighting Irish to San Antonio, New York, Greater Washington, D.C., Chicago, Indianapolis, Boston and the Dallas–Fort Worth metroplex. Notre Dame has yet to lose a game in the Shamrock Series with a record of 11-0 (including the later-vacated win over Arizona State in the 2013 season). Prior to the 2012 season, Notre Dame Athletic Director Jack Swarbrick announced at a news conference of plans to continue the series through 2016. He confirmed after his news conference that New York is expected to fall in that rotation and then continue to be the one consistently repeating venue for Shamrock Series games. The Shamrock Series was not held in 2017, but resumed in 2018. One of the unique aspects of the Shamrock Series is its inclusion of academic and other non-football activities in the area of that year's host city the days and hours leading up to the game, which include pep rallies, drummers' circles, and academic lectures.[389][390][391] The Shamrock Series held in Las Vegas was the largest crowd for a college athletic event in Nevada history.[392] Seven Notre Dame football players have won the Heisman Trophy, which ties them with the University of Oklahoma for the second most by any university. (Ohio State also has seven trophies that were won by only six players, while USC has the most winners with eight). Heisman voting:[394] 50 former Notre Dame players and 6 coaches have been inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame, located in Atlanta, Georgia.[364] Notre Dame leads all universities in players inducted. Notre Dame's home jersey is navy blue with white numerals, gold outlining, and a small interlocking \"ND\" logo on each sleeve. The away jersey is white with navy numerals, gold outlining, and the interlocking \"ND\" on the sleeves. These uniforms were introduced by Lou Holtz in 1986 and retained during the tenures of Bob Davie (1997-2001) and Tyrone Willingham (2002–04). In 2005, Charlie Weis removed the interlocking \"ND\" from the sleeves, replacing it with the player's number, the first time the Irish had worn \"TV numbers\" since 1986, when they were located on the shoulders. These jerseys remained throughout Weis' tenure. When Brian Kelly succeeded Weis in 2010, the interlocking \"ND\" returned to the sleeves, and it has remained since. The Irish traditionally have not worn player names on their jerseys during regular season games, but they were included during the coaching tenures of Dan Devine (1975–80) and Gerry Faust (1981-85). When Notre Dame appeared in the 1970 Cotton Bowl Classic, its first bowl game in 45 years, Ara Parseghian had player names placed on the backs of the jerseys, a tradition which was retained for four other bowl appearances under Parseghian. Holtz, Davie, Willingham and Weis (in the 2006 Fiesta Bowl and 2007 Sugar Bowl) did not adhere to this tradition for bowl games they coached, but it returned under Weis for the 2008 Hawaii Bowl and has been continued by Kelly and Marcus Freeman. Notre Dame's helmets are solid gold with gray facemasks, the gold being emblematic of the University's famed \"Golden Dome\". Notre Dame's tradition for the team's student managers to spray-paint the team's helmets prior to each game ended in 2011 when the football equipment staff, along with Notre Dame Athletics Director Jack Swarbrick and head coach Brian Kelly outsourced the painting process to Hydro Graphics Inc. During Gerry Faust's tenure (1981–85), Notre Dame's blue jerseys switched from the traditional navy (although Notre Dame wore green jerseys full-time between the 1977 game vs. USC and the end of the 1980 season) to royal blue with gold and white stripes on the sleeves (they also wore a green jersey with sleeve stripes for the 1983 game vs. USC). The navy blue jerseys returned for the 1984 season (the Irish wore a redesigned white jersey during the 1983 Liberty Bowl without sleeve stripes and navy blue names and numbers which was carried over to 1984). No uniform numbers have been retired by Notre Dame. Upon being issued a number, each player is given a card that lists some of the more famous players who have worn that particular number. Number 3 is perhaps the most famous number in Irish football history, having been worn by Ralph Guglielmi, George Izo, Daryle Lamonica, Coley O'Brien, Joe Montana, Michael Floyd, Rick Mirer and Ron Powlus, among others.[425] Number 5 is also notable, as it is the only number to be worn by one of the Four Horsemen (Elmer Layden) a Heisman Trophy Winner (Paul Hornung) and a National Title winning Quarterback (Terry Hanratty).[425] Number 7 has been worn by such Irish greats as 1964 Heisman Trophy winner John Huarte, 1970 Heisman runner-up Joe Theismann, Steve Beuerlein, Jimmy Clausen and Jarious Jackson.[425] In 2011, both Michigan and Notre Dame wore throwback uniforms in their game against each other. For each Shamrock Series game, Notre Dame wears specially-designed helmets, jerseys, and pants. Champion supplied football jerseys for Notre Dame for over 50 years until the Irish switched to Adidas in 2001. On July 1, 2014, the Notre Dame athletic department began wearing uniforms and footwear supplied by Under Armour. Over the years, Notre Dame has occasionally worn green instead of blue as its home jersey, sometimes adopting the jersey for an entire season – or more – at a time. Notre Dame is confirmed to have worn green as far back as 1926 against Penn State, and in 1942 they officially became an alternate color for the team.[426] Currently, Notre Dame reserves its green jerseys for special occasions. Sometimes on such occasions, the Irish will take the field for warmups dressed in blue, only to switch to green when they go back to the locker room before kickoff. This tradition was started by Dan Devine in 1977 before the USC game. Notre Dame has also been known to switch jerseys at halftime, as during the 1985 USC game and in the loss to Nile Kinnick-led Iowa in 1939, although this was to help avoid confusion between their navy uniforms and Iowa's black ones. The current design of the jersey is kelly green with gold numbers and white outlining. For the 2006 Army game, Coach Charlie Weis broke out the green jerseys as a reward to his senior players and in an attempt to end the string of losses by the Irish when wearing green. Notre Dame wore throwback green jerseys in 2007 against USC in honor of the 30th anniversary of the 1977 National Championship team but lost the game 38-0.[427] As of 2023, Notre Dame's record in green is 42-15-1, going back to 1975.[426] On at least one occasion (1992 Sugar Bowl) Notre Dame has worn an away variant of the jersey, a white jersey with green numbers. Notre Dame Stadium is the home football stadium for the University of Notre Dame Fighting Irish football team. Located on the southeast part of the university's campus in Notre Dame, Indiana and with a seating capacity of 77,622, Notre Dame Stadium is one of the most renowned venues in college football.[428] The Sporting News ranks Notre Dame Stadium as #2 on its list of \"College Football Cathedrals\".[429] and the stadium experience evokes a more traditional feel. Notre Dame Stadium is used for football-related activities and for Commencement (since 2010). Notre Dame Stadium had no permanent lighting until the expansion project in 1997. NBC paid for the lighting as they have televised all Notre Dame home football games since 1991. On April 12, 2014, it was announced during the annual Blue-Gold Spring Game that a FieldTurf synthetic surface would replace the grass field after the 2014 Commencement Weekend. In November 2014 the University of Notre Dame embarked on a $400 million stadium expansion called the Crossroads Campus Project, which was completed in time for the 2017 season. Cartier Field was the original playing field of the Fighting Irish. In 1930, it was replaced by Notre Dame Stadium, due to the growing popularity of ND football. Known by fans as \"The Gug\" (pronounced \"goog\"), The Guglielmino Athletics Complex is Notre Dame's football headquarters. The Gug houses the offices for all team staff members, an auditorium, a weight room, a training room, the equipment room, the practice locker room, a brand new napping room, and various other spaces for the football team to utilize. The complex was underwritten by Don F. Guglielmino and his family. The indoor practice facility has a synthetic turf field and a video board at midfield for replay and graphics. On the second level of the facility, there is a 1,600-square-foot recruiting lounge. In all, the facility totals 111,400 square feet, and the ceiling is 95 feet at its peak. Notre Dame has rivalries with several universities. Although the Fighting Irish competes as an Independent, they play a national schedule that includes annual or otherwise regularly scheduled rivalry games. Army, Boston College, Michigan, Michigan State, Navy, Northwestern, Pittsburgh, Purdue, Stanford, and USC are among Notre Dame's rivals. Notre Dame and the Miami Hurricanes first met during the 1955 college football season.[430] They met three times during the 1960s (1960, 1965, and 1967) and proceeded to play each other annually from 1971 to 1990 (except in 1986). Notre Dame consistently dominated the series in the 1970s, but in the 1980s, Miami began to dominate as the once docile rivalry intensified significantly. Both teams were national contenders in the later part of the decade, and both teams cost each other at least one national championship. Hostilities were fueled when the Hurricanes routed the Fighting Irish in the 1985 season finale 58–7, with Miami widely accused of running up the score in the second half. The rivalry gained national attention and both teams played their most famous games from 1988 to 1990. The game known as Catholics vs. Convicts in South Bend was won by the Fighting Irish 31–30. The following year, Miami ended Notre Dame's 23-game winning streak with a 27–10 victory. The rivalry ended after the Fighting Irish dashed #2 Miami's hopes for a repeat national championship with a 29–20 victory in South Bend. Notre Dame dropped Miami from its schedule due to the intensified rivalry. The two teams are next scheduled to meet during a yet to specified date during the 2025 season. They also will play each other in yet to be scheduled dates in the 2031, 2032, 2034, and 2037 seasons.[431] The first meeting between Notre Dame and Michigan was in 1887, the first official football game in Notre Dame's history.[432] The two schools have met 44 times in total, the latest matchup in 2019. Through the 2021 season, the two schools are both in the top five in all-time Division I winning percentage, with Notre Dame fourth and Michigan third Meeting for the first time in 1897, Notre Dame and Michigan State play for the Megaphone Trophy. The two schools played in 64 out of 70 seasons from 1948 to 2017, but have not met since. Their next scheduled game is in 2026.[433] Notable games in the series include the 1966 \"Game of the Century\". Through the 2023 season, Notre Dame leads the all-time series 48–28–1 and the trophy series 33–27–1.[434] Navy and Notre Dame played 93 games without interruption from 1927 to 2019. Notre Dame had a 43-game win streak during this time frame, the longest streak by one team over another in Division I-A football, which ended in 2007.[435] While the 2020 contest was cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the series resumed in 2021. Through the 2024 season, Notre Dame leads the series 83–13–1.[436] USC is Notre Dame's primary rival, and the schools compete annually for the Jeweled Shillelagh. The rivalry has produced 39 national championships,[437]: 113–118 15 Heisman Trophy winners,[438] and 184 Consensus All-Americans through the 2021 season.[439] It is considered one of the most prominent rivalries in college football,[440][441][442][443] and has been called the greatest rivalry not dictated by conference affiliation or geography.[444] The teams have played each other annually since 1926, except from 1943 to 1945 and 2020. Notable games in the series include the 1977 \"Green Jersey\" game and the 2005 \"Bush Push\" game. Through the 2024 season, Notre Dame leads the all-time series 50–37–5 and the trophy series 35–30–3.[445] Due to its long and storied history, Notre Dame football boasts many traditions unique to Notre Dame. Some of these are: Since the NFL began drafting players in 1936, 495 Notre Dame football players have been selected by NFL teams. Additionally, Notre Dame has had 65 players selected in the first round of the NFL draft, including five overall number one picks. Of the 46 Super Bowls competed, as of 2012, only 14 teams have won the event without an Irish player on the roster.[457] Looking at both participating team rosters, there have only been five Super Bowls that did not feature at least one former Notre Dame player on either team's roster – Denver vs. Atlanta, 1999; Dallas vs. Buffalo, 1994; Washington vs. Denver, 1988; Dallas vs. Denver, 1978; and Baltimore vs. Dallas, 1971.[457] Eleven former players have won multiple Super Bowls: Mark Bavaro, Rocky Bleier, Nick Buoniconti, Eric Dorsey, Dave Duerson, David Givens, Terry Hanratty, Bob Kuechenberg, Joe Montana, Steve Sylvester and Justin Tuck.[457] 13 former Notre Dame players, plus 1 non-player alumnus, have been inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame, tying it for first with USC among all college football programs.[458][459] *McNally graduated from St. John's (MN), but started his career at Notre Dame and is listed as a hall of famer under both schools in the Pro Football Hall of Fame.[460] The Fighting Irish are the only team, professional or collegiate, to have all their games broadcast nationally on the radio and their home games on television.[462] Notre Dame famously left the College Football Association, a consortium that administered television broadcast rights on behalf of over 64 schools, in 1990, in order to establish its own broadcasting deal with NBC. From 1968 to 2007, Westwood One served as the official radio partner for the Irish, broadcasting their games for 40 consecutive years.[463] Until the 2006 Air Force game, Notre Dame had a record 169 consecutive games broadcast nationally on either NBC, ABC, ESPN, or CBS.[464] The 2006 ND vs. Air Force game was broadcast on CSTV, a college sports channel owned by CBS who had an exclusive contract with the Mountain West Conference, of which Air Force is a member. Radio rights to the Fighting Irish are held by Skyview Networks, who began distributing the broadcasts as part of a multi-sport arrangement in 2020.[465] NBC has been televising Notre Dame Home football games since the 1991 season.[9] In addition to TV broadcasts, NBC also maintains several dedicated websites to ND football and Notre Dame Central,[466] which provides complete coverage, full game replays and commentary of the Notre Dame team. NBC's television contract with Notre Dame was renewed in April 2013 and was set to continue through the 2025 football season,[467] before another contract renewal was made in 2023. NBC is now set to be the home of Notre Dame football through the 2029 season. It also aired football games on NBC's streaming service Peacock started in the 2021 season, with the home opener on September 11, 2021, against Toledo aired exclusively on the streaming service.[468][469] Internationally Sky Sports has been covering Notre Dame Football home games in the United Kingdom, Republic of Ireland, Italy and Germany since 2018 as a result of Comcast's takeover of Sky Although the Notre Dame football program is not a full member of the Atlantic Coast Conference (ACC), it has an agreement to play an average of five ACC schools per season. In return Notre Dame has access to the non-College Football Playoff ACC bowl line-up.[470][471] Notre Dame utilizes a format of six home games in South Bend, five away games, and one major metropolitan area neutral site \"Shamrock Series\" home game for scheduling.[389] This includes preserving traditional yearly rivalries with USC, Stanford, and Navy,[472] five rotating ACC opponents (two away ACC games will coincide in even years with away games at Navy and three away ACC games will coincide in odd years with home games against Navy),[473] two home and home series (one home game and one away game), one one-time opponent home game, and the traveling \"Shamrock Series\" home game.[474][475] TBA: 1 additional ACC away game will be scheduled. TBA: 1 additional ACC home game and 1 additional non-ACC home game will be scheduled. TBA: 1 additional ACC game and 3 additional non-ACC games will be scheduled. TBA: 1 additional ACC game and 2 additional non-ACC games will be scheduled. TBA: 1 additional ACC game and 2 additional non-ACC games will be scheduled.

Areas at highest risk include cities in Kansas, Missouri, Illinois, Iowa, Indiana, Ohio, Virginia, West Virginia, and Delaware. The NWS also predicts significant sleet and freezing rain this weekend, spanning from eastern Kansas and the Ozarks to the Tennessee and lower Ohio Valleys. Per the NWS, cities most at risk from \"significant\" icing included those in southeast Kansas, south Missouri, south Illinois, Kentucky, south Indiana, Virginia, and West Virginia. The Weather Channel said that Baltimore, Charleston, West Virginia, Cincinnati, Philadelphia, Pittsburgh, and Washington, D.C., are some of the major cities facing wintry travel conditions. It added that affected cities were at risk of these travel conditions prompting delays or closures. Meteorologist Jim Cantore said on X, formerly Twitter: \"Pending coast to coast winter storm (TWC named #Blair) will crank east of the Rockies starting Saturday night into Tuesday off the east coast. Still model to model differences on timing and positioning that will make all the difference in precipitation type for the i64 corridor. This will be a high impact event that starts on a post holiday travel weekend so keep that in mind as snow rates and ice accretion are all on its resume all the way to the east coast. Below a look at the two-pieced system on satellite and its trek east through next Tuesday at 500mb.\" Meteorologist Ryan Maue wrote on X: \"Sunday and Monday will be a brutal mess for huge population in bunch of big cities. \"Heavy snow, sleet, freezing rain may surprise folks in how fast it's falling and accumulating with cold temps in the 20s. \"Try to travel Fri/Sat, or wait until Tues.\" The NWS winter storm forecast was for Saturday, January 4 to Monday, January 6.

                "content": "Winter Storm Blair, the first named winter storm of 2025, continues to evolve, with forecasts indicating snow, ice, and freezing temperatures impacting up to 250 million people across 40 states this weekend. Models are still shifting, and Mansfield is closely monitoring developments to keep you informed. The storm is expected to bring hazardous conditions beginning Saturday in the Rockies, Plains, and Midwest, affecting cities like Kansas City, St. Louis, and Wichita. By Sunday, it will extend east into West Virginia and the Appalachian Mountains and move south into Oklahoma, impacting Cincinnati, Indianapolis, and Louisville. By Monday, snow will spread into the mid-Atlantic, including Baltimore, Philadelphia, Pittsburgh, Charleston, S.C., and parts of West Virginia. Forecasts predict 6–12 inches of snow across affected areas, with sub-freezing temperatures lingering through mid-January and potentially impacting areas as far south as Texas, Oklahoma, and Florida. Carriers within the impacted region expect to continue deliveries as normal until conditions make it unsafe to do so. In preparation for potential weather disruptions, Mansfield encourages customers to ensure driveways, tanks, and drop areas remain clear of snow and ice to allow safe and efficient deliveries. We also encourage you to top off fuel tanks in advance to avoid last-minute shortages caused by weather delays and monitor local weather and road conditions as the situation develops. With Arctic air pushing temperatures well below average, diesel fuel gelling and delivery delays may pose additional challenges. Mansfield proactively treats inventory-managed sites with additives and kerosene to prevent gelling and optimize cold-weather performance. If you are not yet enrolled in Mansfield’s ColdPRO program for winterized fuel or have any questions about cold-weather fuel preparation, please contact your account representative or email info@mansfieldoil.com. Mansfield’s team is available 24/7 to assist with fuel adjustments, deliveries, or emergency support during the storm.

                "content": "Melvin Wayne Osmond (August 28, 1951 – January 1, 2025) was an American musician. He was the second-oldest of the original Osmond Brothers singers and the fourth-oldest of the nine Osmond children. Starting in 1958, Wayne and three of his brothers (Alan, Merrill, and Jay in their respective age orders) began singing as a barbershop quartet. They were later discovered in 1961 by Jay Emerson Williams, the father of Andy Williams, at a performance at Disneyland which was being filmed for the Disneyland After Dark episode of Walt Disney's Wonderful World of Color. In 1962, the four Osmonds were cast over a seven-year period on NBC's The Andy Williams Show, a musical variety program. After their early singles failed, MGM Records signed the band, inspired by the success of the Jackson 5, and sent them to Muscle Shoals. There, they recorded One Bad Apple, a song initially written for the Jacksons but rejected by their label.[2] Each of these four Osmond brothers were also cast in nine episodes of the 1963–1964 ABC Western series, The Travels of Jaimie McPheeters, with Wayne in the role of young Leviticus Kissel. In the band's rock formation, Osmond played guitar[3] and occasionally drums,[4] among many other instruments, with Osmond recalling shortly before his death that he learned to play eight instruments during his time with the band.[5] He was found to have perfect pitch.[3] His last intended appearance with the Osmonds was October 13, 2018; however, the four brothers performed as a group a year later at CBS daytime show The Talk, as a birthday present to their sister, Marie.[6][7] Osmond was born on August 28, 1951, to Olive May (née Davis; 1925–2004) and George Virl Osmond (1917–2007) in Ogden, Utah. He was the fourth oldest out of nine children.[8] Like the rest of his family, he was a member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints,[7] mainly because he \"like(d) being part of that organization,\" one that aligned with his personal values.[9] In 2004, he said of his faith: \"we have a very high moral and ethical code that we live by . . . it's not something that's forced upon us. Anyone can do what they want to; everyone has their free agency. In fact, that's God's greatest gift to mankind, his free agency.\"[9] He also noted that he had never felt substantial temptation to engage in the stereotypical sinful activities such as affairs, vulgar language or substance abuse.[9] On December 13, 1974, Osmond married Kathlyn White from Bountiful, Utah, a former Miss Davis County Fair and Miss Utah of 1974. They had five children, three daughters and two sons.[10][11] In the 1990s, Osmond moved to Branson, Missouri. In 1997, he was diagnosed with a brain tumor, which was successfully treated at the expense of his hearing; the treatment left Osmond nearly deaf and reliant on a cochlear implant.[12] He continued to tour and perform with Merrill and Jay (Alan had left the touring production due to multiple sclerosis)[9] until a stroke in 2012 left him unable to play guitar.[3] He held a pilot's license, from which he earned the nickname \"Wings,\" and continued to fly aircraft until mobility issues prevented him from doing so near the end of his life.[5] He also mentored Alan's son David Osmond, who had followed in the Osmond family musical tradition.[10] Osmond suffered another, more severe stroke and died at University of Utah Hospital in Salt Lake City, Utah, on January 1, 2025, at the age of 73. Among those who attended his deathbed were his wife, children, and brothers Donny and Merrill.[4][5][13] This article about an American musician is a stub. You can help Wikipedia by expanding it.",

                "content": "Advertisement Supported by He was a founding member of the family pop group, whose slew of hits in the 1970s included the No. 1 record “One Bad Apple.” By Hank Sanders and Emmett Lindner Wayne Osmond, an original member of the Osmonds, the family singing group that had a string of pop hits in the 1970s and helped launch the careers of his more renowned siblings Donny and Marie, died on Wednesday in Salt Lake City. He was 73. His death, at University of Utah Hospital, was caused by complications of a recent stroke, his daughter Amy Cook said. As an original member of the group, which began as a sibling quartet called the Osmond Brothers, Wayne and his brothers were child stars and later became a ubiquitous pop act. As practicing Mormons, the family built a brand on resisting the temptations of fame while capturing the spirit of the era with their flared jumpsuits and rollicking dance choreography. Songs like “One Bad Apple” and “Yo-Yo” became Top 10 singles in the early 1970s. (“One Bad Apple” reached No. 1.) The group drew comparisons to the Jackson Five — young Donny, known for his raspy high notes, was their equivalent of Michael Jackson — and reached a feverish level of fame. When the Osmonds landed at Heathrow Airport in London on a trip to Britain in 1972, “they were lucky to escape alive,” a reporter wrote in The New York Times that year, and they “produced the kind of teary, lip‐trembling, shrieking scenes that recalled the early impact of the Beatles, post‐Liverpool.” We are having trouble retrieving the article content.

                "title": "Wayne Osmond, member of Utah's singing Osmond Brothers, dies",
                "content": "Wayne Osmond — a member of the Osmond Brothers, the singing siblings who brought bubblegum pop music and Utah wholesomeness to a worldwide audience — has died. Osmond died Wednesday night, his brother Merrill wrote in a Facebook post Thursday, in a Salt Lake City hospital after suffering “a massive stroke.” He was 73. “I’ve never known a man that had more humility,” Merrill wrote. “A man with absolutely no guile. An individual that was quick to forgive and had the ability to show unconditional love to everyone he ever met.” Another brother, Donny, posted on Facebook that “Wayne brought so much light, laughter, and love to everyone who knew him, especially me. He was the ultimate optimist and was loved by everyone.” The children of George and Olive Osmond, the nine Osmond children were born and raised in Ogden. Wayne was born Aug. 28, 1951. Four of the brothers — Alan, Wayne, Jay and Merrill — started as a barbershop quartet around Ogden in 1958. The quartet moved from Utah gigs to performing at Disneyland. It was at Disneyland where Jay Williams, the father of “Moon River” crooner Andy Williams, discovered the Osmonds. In 1963, the quartet made a national television debut on “The Andy Williams Show.” The Osmonds became regular performers on the NBC variety show. (NBC) The original Osmond Brothers — Alan, Wayne, Merrill and Jay, from left — with host Andy Williams on his variety show in the 1960s. Wayne sang baritone and was the guitarist of the group. He also was known as the onstage goofball. Merrill wrote that Wayne’s “legacy will go down as someone who was not only a genius in his ability to write music, but was able to capture the hearts of millions of people and bring them closer to God.” On “The Andy Williams Show,” the quartet became a quintet, when younger brother Donny joined the group. Another recurring Osmond was the youngest brother, Jimmy, who would act as comic relief. Donny would go on to become the most successful solo artist in the family. He maintained a long partnership with the one Osmond sister, Marie, that spanned decades with a ’70s TV variety show and long concert runs in Las Vegas. Jimmy also had a successful solo career, particularly in the United Kingdom, where, at age 9 in 1972, he had a hit single with “Long-Haired Lover from Liverpool.” The Osmond Brothers hit their peak of popularity in the early 1970s, right around the time “The Andy Williams Show” ended its run in 1971. The group had a string of six gold albums (including a live album) from 1970 to 1973. (Heinrich Klaffs) The Osmonds performing in 1973. They hit No. 1 on the pop charts with “One Bad Apple” in 1970. Other hits followed, including “Double Lovin’,” “Yo-Yo,” “Down by the Lazy River” and “Love Me for a Reason.” Wayne co-wrote two of the group’s hits, “Hold Her Tight” and “Crazy Horses,” with Alan and Merrill. The Osmonds also became unofficial ambassadors of their faith, The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. They became symbols of their church and their home state. In 1982, when President Ronald Reagan visited Utah, the quartet sang a rendition of “The Battle Hymn of the Republic” at an event that reportedly brought a tear to Reagan’s eye. In 1974, while attending church-owned Brigham Young University, Wayne Osmond met Kathlyn White, then the reigning Miss Utah in the Miss America competition. They married in December that year, The Salt Lake Tribune reported at the time, and Kathlyn was forced to relinquish her title. Their “working honeymoon” happened while the Osmond Brothers were touring Europe. When Donny and Marie’s star rose on the strength of their ABC variety show, the brothers kept touring. In later years, the brothers launched careers away from performing — and Wayne, who had a pilot license before he was old enough to drive cars, flew corporate jets. In 1993, the Osmonds regrouped to find new success in a new location: Branson, Missouri. They got the inspiration from their longtime friend, Andy Williams, who had opened a theater in the town’s growing entertainment district. Williams’ success inspired Jimmy Osmond to open the Osmond Family Theater there and get the brothers back together. Wayne and Kathlyn relocated to the Ozarks, along with their five children — as did Alan, Merrill and Jay, with their wives and a combined 16 kids. Jay joked at the time that the family “doubled the public school population” of Branson. The influx of Osmonds led to formation of the first Latter-day Saint ward, or congregation, for the southwest Missouri/northwest Arkansas region. Wayne told The Tribune in 1993 that performing with his brothers again was a cinch. “After 35 years under your belt,” he said, “it’s not that difficult any more.” The brothers toured for years, until health issues forced Alan and Wayne to retire. Wayne suffered brain tumors in the late ’90s, while Alan was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis. The last time the four brothers performed as a group was in 2019, to serenade their sister, Marie, for her 60th birthday on the CBS daytime show “The Talk,” where Marie was then one of the hosts. Marie credited her older siblings for establishing all of the family’s careers. “If you really go back to the beginning,” Marie said in 2019, “none of us would have been here without the four original Osmond brothers.” Wayne is the first of the nine Osmond siblings to die. He is survived by his singing siblings — Alan, Merrill, Jay, Donny, Jimmy and Marie — as well as the two oldest brothers who did not perform, Virl and Tom. Survivors include his wife of 50 years, Kathlyn; their five children: Amy Cook, Steven Osmond, Gregory Osmond, Sarah Hilton and Michelle Erickson; and 20 grandchildren. Details for a memorial have yet to be announced. In Los Angeles, a wreath of white and pink roses was placed in Wayne’s honor on The Osmonds’ star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame on Thursday, the walk’s organizers posted on X.

                "content": "Pontic Steppe Caucasus East Asia Eastern Europe Northern Europe Pontic Steppe Northern/Eastern Steppe Europe South Asia Steppe Europe Caucasus India Indo-Aryans Iranians East Asia Europe East Asia Europe Indo-Aryan Iranian Indo-Aryan Iranian Others European The Celts (/kɛlts/ KELTS, see pronunciation for different usages) or Celtic peoples (/ˈkɛltɪk/ KEL-tik) were a collection of Indo-European peoples[1] in Europe and Anatolia, identified by their use of Celtic languages and other cultural similarities.[2][3][4][5] Major Celtic groups included the Gauls; the Celtiberians and Gallaeci[6][7] of Iberia; the Britons, Picts, and Gaels of Britain and Ireland; the Boii; and the Galatians. The interrelationships of ethnicity, language and culture in the Celtic world are unclear and debated;[8] for example over the ways in which the Iron Age people of Britain and Ireland should be called Celts.[5][8][9][10] In current scholarship, 'Celt' primarily refers to 'speakers of Celtic languages' rather than to a single ethnic group.[11] The history of pre-Celtic Europe and Celtic origins is debated. The traditional \"Celtic from the East\" theory, says the proto-Celtic language arose in the late Bronze Age Urnfield culture of central Europe, named after grave sites in southern Germany,[12][13] which flourished from around 1200 BC.[14] This theory links the Celts with the Iron Age Hallstatt culture which followed it (c. 1200–500 BC), named for the rich grave finds in Hallstatt, Austria,[14][15] and with the following La Tène culture (c. 450 BC onward), named after the La Tène site in Switzerland. It proposes that Celtic culture spread westward and southward from these areas by diffusion or migration.[16] A newer theory, \"Celtic from the West\", suggests proto-Celtic arose earlier, was a lingua franca in the Atlantic Bronze Age coastal zone, and spread eastward.[17] Another newer theory, \"Celtic from the Centre\", suggests proto-Celtic arose between these two zones, in Bronze Age Gaul, then spread in various directions.[11] After the Celtic settlement of Southeast Europe in the 3rd century BC, Celtic culture reached as far east as central Anatolia, Turkey. The earliest undisputed examples of Celtic language are the Lepontic inscriptions from the 6th century BC.[18] Continental Celtic languages are attested almost exclusively through inscriptions and place-names. Insular Celtic languages are attested from the 4th century AD in Ogham inscriptions, though they were being spoken much earlier. Celtic literary tradition begins with Old Irish texts around the 8th century AD. Elements of Celtic mythology are recorded in early Irish and early Welsh literature. Most written evidence of the early Celts comes from Greco-Roman writers, who often grouped the Celts as barbarian tribes. They followed an ancient Celtic religion overseen by druids. The Celts were often in conflict with the Romans, such as in the Roman–Gallic wars, the Celtiberian Wars, the conquest of Gaul and conquest of Britain. By the 1st century AD, most Celtic territories had become part of the Roman Empire. By c. 500, due to Romanisation and the migration of Germanic tribes, Celtic culture had mostly become restricted to Ireland, western and northern Britain, and Brittany. Between the 5th and 8th centuries, the Celtic-speaking communities in these Atlantic regions emerged as a reasonably cohesive cultural entity. They had a common linguistic, religious and artistic heritage that distinguished them from surrounding cultures.[19] Insular Celtic culture diversified into that of the Gaels (Irish, Scots and Manx) and the Celtic Britons (Welsh, Cornish, and Bretons) of the medieval and modern periods.[2][20][21] A modern Celtic identity[22] was constructed as part of the Romanticist Celtic Revival in Britain, Ireland, and other European territories such as Galicia.[23] Today, Irish, Scottish Gaelic, Welsh, and Breton are still spoken in parts of their former territories, while Cornish and Manx are undergoing a revival. The first recorded use of the name 'Celts' – as Κελτοί (Keltoi) in Ancient Greek – was by Greek geographer Hecataeus of Miletus in 517 BC,[24] when writing about a people living near Massilia (modern Marseille), southern Gaul.[25] In the fifth century BC, Herodotus referred to Keltoi living around the source of the Danube and in the far west of Europe.[26] The etymology of Keltoi is unclear. Possible roots include Indo-European *kʲel 'to hide' (seen also in Old Irish ceilid, and Modern Welsh celu), *kʲel 'to heat' or *kel 'to impel'.[27] It may come from the Celtic language. Linguist Kim McCone supports this view and notes that Celt- is found in the names of several ancient Gauls such as Celtillus, father of Vercingetorix. He suggests it meant the people or descendants of \"the hidden one\", noting the Gauls claimed descent from an underworld god (according to Commentarii de Bello Gallico), and linking it with the Germanic Hel.[28] Others view it as a name coined by Greeks; among them linguist Patrizia de Bernardo Stempel, who suggests it meant \"the tall ones\".[29] In the first century BC, Roman leader Julius Caesar reported that the Gauls called themselves 'Celts', Latin: Celtae, in their own tongue.[30] Thus whether it was given to them by others or not, it was used by the Celts themselves. Greek geographer Strabo, writing about Gaul towards the end of the first century BC, refers to the \"race which is now called both Gallic and Galatic\", though he also uses Celtica as another name for Gaul. He reports Celtic peoples in Iberia too, calling them Celtiberi and Celtici.[31] Pliny the Elder noted the use of Celtici in Lusitania as a tribal surname,[32] which epigraphic findings have confirmed.[33][34] A Latin name for the Gauls, Galli (pl.), may come from a Celtic ethnic name, perhaps borrowed into Latin during the Celtic expansion into Italy from the early fifth century BC. Its root may be Proto-Celtic *galno, meaning \"power, strength\" (whence Old Irish gal \"boldness, ferocity\", Welsh gallu \"to be able, power\"). The Greek name Γαλάται (Galatai, Latinized Galatae) most likely has the same origin, referring to the Gauls who invaded southeast Europe and settled in Galatia.[35] The suffix -atai might be a Greek inflection.[36] Linguist Kim McCone suggests it comes from Proto-Celtic *galatis (\"ferocious, furious\"), and was not originally an ethnic name but a name for young warrior bands. He says \"If the Gauls' initial impact on the Mediterranean world was primarily a military one typically involving fierce young *galatīs, it would have been natural for the Greeks to apply this name for the type of Keltoi that they usually encountered\".[28] Because Classical writers did not call the inhabitants of Britain and Ireland Κελτοί (Keltoi) or Celtae,[5][8][9] some scholars prefer not to use the term for the Iron Age inhabitants of those islands.[5][8][9][10] However, they spoke Celtic languages, shared other cultural traits, and Roman historian Tacitus says the Britons resembled the Gauls in customs and religion.[11] For at least 1,000 years the name Celt was not used at all, and nobody called themselves Celts or Celtic, until from about 1700, after the word 'Celtic' was rediscovered in classical texts, it was applied for the first time to the distinctive culture, history, traditions, language of the modern Celtic nations – Ireland, Scotland, Wales, Cornwall, Brittany, and the Isle of Man.[37] 'Celt' is a modern English word, first attested in 1707 in the writing of Edward Lhuyd, whose work, along with that of other late 17th-century scholars, brought academic attention to the languages and history of the early Celtic inhabitants of Great Britain.[38] The English words Gaul, Gauls (pl.) and Gaulish (first recorded in the 16–17th centuries) come from French Gaule and Gaulois, a borrowing from Frankish *Walholant, 'Roman-land' (see Gaul: Name), the root of which is Proto-Germanic *walha-, 'foreigner, Roman, Celt', whence the English word Welsh (Old English wælisċ). Proto-Germanic *walha comes from the name of the Volcae,[39] a Celtic tribe who lived first in southern Germany and central Europe, then migrated to Gaul.[40] This means that English Gaul, despite its superficial similarity, is not actually derived from Latin Gallia (which should have produced *Jaille in French),[citation needed] though it does refer to the same ancient region. Celtic refers to a language family and, more generally, means 'of the Celts' or 'in the style of the Celts'. Several archaeological cultures are considered Celtic, based on unique sets of artefacts. The link between language and artefact is aided by the presence of inscriptions.[41] The modern idea of a Celtic cultural identity or \"Celticity\" focuses on similarities among languages, works of art, and classical texts,[42] and sometimes also among material artefacts, social organisation, homeland and mythology.[43] Earlier theories held that these similarities suggest a common \"racial\" (race is now a contested concept) origin for the various Celtic peoples, but more recent theories hold that they reflect a common cultural and linguistic heritage more than a genetic one. Celtic cultures seem to have been diverse, with the use of a Celtic language being the main thing they had in common.[5] Today, the term 'Celtic' generally refers to the languages and cultures of Ireland, Scotland, Wales, Cornwall, the Isle of Man, and Brittany; also called the Celtic nations. These are the regions where Celtic languages are still spoken to some extent. The four are Irish, Scottish Gaelic, Welsh, and Breton; plus two recent revivals, Cornish (a Brittonic language) and Manx (a Goidelic language). There are also attempts to reconstruct Cumbric, a Brittonic language of northern Britain. Celtic regions of mainland Europe are those whose residents claim a Celtic heritage, but where no Celtic language survives; these include western Iberia, i.e. Portugal and north-central Spain (Galicia, Asturias, Cantabria, Castile and León, Extremadura).[44] Continental Celts are the Celtic-speaking people of mainland Europe and Insular Celts are the Celtic-speaking people of the British and Irish islands, and their descendants. The Celts of Brittany derive their language from migrating Insular Celts from Britain and so are grouped accordingly.[45] The Celtic languages are a branch of the Indo-European languages. By the time Celts are first mentioned in written records around 400 BC, they were already split into several language groups, and spread over much of western mainland Europe, the Iberian Peninsula, Ireland and Britain. The languages developed into Celtiberian, Goidelic and Brittonic branches, among others.[46][47] The mainstream view during most of the twentieth century is that the Celts and the proto-Celtic language arose out of the Urnfield culture of central Europe around 1000 BC, spreading westward and southward over the following few hundred years.[14][48][49][50] The Urnfield culture was preeminent in central Europe during the late Bronze Age, circa 1200 BC to 700 BC. The spread of iron-working led to the Hallstatt culture (c. 800 to 500 BC) developing out of the Urnfield culture in a wide region north of the Alps. The Hallstatt culture developed into the La Tène culture from about 450 BC, which came to be identified with Celtic art.[citation needed] In 1846, Johann Georg Ramsauer unearthed an ancient grave field with distinctive grave goods at Hallstatt, Austria. Because the burials \"dated to roughly the time when Celts are mentioned near the Danube by Herodotus, Ramsauer concluded that the graves were Celtic\".[51] Similar sites and artifacts were found over a wide area, which were named the 'Hallstatt culture'. In 1857, the archaeological site of La Tène was discovered in Switzerland.[51] The huge collection of artifacts had a distinctive style. Artifacts of this 'La Tène style' were found elsewhere in Europe, \"particularly in places where people called Celts were known to have lived and early Celtic languages are attested. As a result, these items quickly became associated with the Celts, so much so that by the 1870s scholars began to regard finds of the La Tène as 'the archaeological expression of the Celts'\".[51] This cultural network was overrun by the Roman Empire, though traces of La Tène style were still seen in Gallo-Roman artifacts. In Britain and Ireland, the La Tène style survived precariously to re-emerge in Insular art.[citation needed] The Urnfield-Hallstatt theory began to be challenged in the latter 20th century, when it was accepted that the oldest known Celtic-language inscriptions were those of Lepontic from the 6th century BC and Celtiberian from the 2nd century BC. These were found in northern Italy and Iberia, neither of which were part of the 'Hallstatt' nor 'La Tène' cultures at the time.[11] The Urnfield-Hallstatt theory was partly based on ancient Greco-Roman writings, such as the Histories of Herodotus, which placed the Celts at the source of the Danube. However, Stephen Oppenheimer shows that Herodotus seemed to believe the Danube rose near the Pyrenees, which would place the Ancient Celts in a region which is more in agreement with later classical writers and historians (i.e. in Gaul and Iberia).[52] The theory was also partly based on the abundance of inscriptions bearing Celtic personal names in the Eastern Hallstatt region (Noricum). However, Patrick Sims-Williams notes that these date to the later Roman era, and says they suggest \"relatively late settlement by a Celtic-speaking elite\".[11] In the late 20th century, the Urnfield-Hallstatt theory began to fall out of favour with some scholars, which was influenced by new archaeological finds. 'Celtic' began to refer primarily to 'speakers of Celtic languages' rather than to a single culture or ethnic group.[11] A new theory suggested that Celtic languages arose earlier, along the Atlantic coast (including Britain, Ireland, Armorica and Iberia), long before evidence of 'Celtic' culture is found in archaeology. Myles Dillon and Nora Kershaw Chadwick argued that \"Celtic settlement of the British Isles\" might date to the Bell Beaker culture of the Copper and Bronze Age (from c. 2750 BC).[53][54] Martín Almagro Gorbea (2001) also proposed that Celtic arose in the 3rd millennium BC, suggesting that the spread of the Bell Beaker culture explained the wide dispersion of the Celts throughout western Europe, as well as the variability of the Celtic peoples.[55] John T. Koch[56] and Barry Cunliffe[57] have developed this 'Celtic from the West' theory. It proposes that the proto-Celtic language arose along the Atlantic coast and was the lingua franca of the Atlantic Bronze Age cultural network, later spreading inland and eastward.[11] More recently, Cunliffe proposes that proto-Celtic had arisen in the Atlantic zone even earlier, by 3000 BC, and spread eastwards with the Bell Beaker culture over the following millennium. His theory is partly based on glottochronology, the spread of ancient Celtic-looking placenames, and thesis that the Tartessian language was Celtic.[11] However, the proposal that Tartessian was Celtic is widely rejected by linguists, many of whom regard it as unclassified.[58][59] Celticist Patrick Sims-Williams (2020) notes that in current scholarship, 'Celt' is primarily a linguistic label. In his 'Celtic from the Centre' theory, he argues that the proto-Celtic language did not originate in central Europe nor the Atlantic, but in-between these two regions. He suggests that it \"emerged as a distinct Indo-European dialect around the second millennium BC, probably somewhere in Gaul [centered in modern France] ... whence it spread in various directions and at various speeds in the first millennium BC\". Sims-Williams says this avoids the problematic idea \"that Celtic was spoken over a vast area for a very long time yet somehow avoided major dialectal splits\", and \"it keeps Celtic fairly close to Italy, which suits the view that Italic and Celtic were in some way linked\".[11] The Proto-Celtic language is usually dated to the Late Bronze Age.[14] The earliest records of a Celtic language are the Lepontic inscriptions of Cisalpine Gaul (Northern Italy), the oldest of which pre-date the La Tène period. Other early inscriptions, appearing from the early La Tène period in the area of Massilia, are in Gaulish, which was written in the Greek alphabet until the Roman conquest. Celtiberian inscriptions, using their own Iberian script, appear later, after about 200 BC. Evidence of Insular Celtic is available only from about 400 AD, in the form of Primitive Irish Ogham inscriptions.[citation needed] Besides epigraphic evidence, an important source of information on early Celtic is toponymy (place names).[60] Arnaiz-Villena et al. (2017) demonstrated that Celtic-related populations of the European Atlantic (Orkney Islands, Scottish, Irish, British, Bretons, Basques, Galicians) shared a common HLA system.[clarification needed][61] Other genetic research does not support the notion of a significant genetic link between these populations, beyond the fact that they are all West Europeans. Early European Farmers did settle Britain (and all of Northern Europe) in the Neolithic; however, recent genetics research has found that, between 2400 and 2000 BC, over 90% of British DNA was overturned by European Steppe Herders in a migration that brought large amounts of Steppe DNA (including the R1b haplogroup) to western Europe.[62] Modern autosomal genetic clustering is testament to this fact, as both modern and Iron Age British and Irish samples cluster genetically very closely with other North Europeans, and less so with Galicians, Basques or those from the south of France.[63][64] The concept that the Hallstatt and La Tène cultures could be seen not just as chronological periods but as \"Culture Groups\", entities composed of people of the same ethnicity and language, had started to grow by the end of the 19th century. At the beginning of the 20th century the belief that these \"Culture Groups\" could be thought of in racial or ethnic terms was held by Gordon Childe, whose theory was influenced by the writings of Gustaf Kossinna.[65] As the 20th century progressed, the ethnic interpretation of La Tène culture became more strongly rooted, and any findings of La Tène culture and flat inhumation cemeteries were linked to the Celts and the Celtic language.[66] In various[clarification needed] academic disciplines the Celts were considered a Central European Iron Age phenomenon, through the cultures of Hallstatt and La Tène. However, archaeological finds from the Halstatt and La Tène culture were rare in Iberia, southwestern France, northern and western Britain, southern Ireland and Galatia[67][68] and did not provide enough evidence for a culture like that of Central Europe. It is equally difficult to maintain that the origin of the Iberian Celts can be linked to the preceding Urnfield culture. This has resulted in a newer theory that introduces a 'proto-Celtic' substratum and a process of Celticisation, having its initial roots in the Bronze Age Bell Beaker culture.[69] The La Tène culture developed and flourished during the late Iron Age (from 450 BC to the Roman conquest in the 1st century BC) in eastern France, Switzerland, Austria, southwest Germany, the Czech Republic, Slovakia and Hungary. It developed out of the Hallstatt culture without any definite cultural break, under the impetus of considerable Mediterranean influence from Greek, and later Etruscan civilisations. A shift of settlement centres took place in the 4th century. The western La Tène culture corresponds to historical Celtic Gaul. Whether this means that the whole of La Tène culture can be attributed to a unified Celtic people is difficult to assess; archaeologists have repeatedly concluded that language and material culture do not necessarily run parallel. Frey notes that in the 5th century, \"burial customs in the Celtic world were not uniform; rather, localised groups had their own beliefs, which, in consequence, also gave rise to distinct artistic expressions\".[70] Thus, while the La Tène culture is certainly associated with the Gauls, the presence of La Tène artefacts may be due to cultural contact and does not imply the permanent presence of Celtic speakers.[citation needed] The Greek historian Ephorus of Cyme in Asia Minor, writing in the 4th century BC, believed the Celts came from the islands off the mouth of the Rhine and were \"driven from their homes by the frequency of wars and the violent rising of the sea\". Polybius published a history of Rome about 150 BC in which he describes the Gauls of Italy and their conflict with Rome. Pausanias in the 2nd century AD says that the Gauls \"originally called Celts\", \"live on the remotest region of Europe on the coast of an enormous tidal sea\". Posidonius described the southern Gauls about 100 BC. Though his original work is lost, later writers such as Strabo used it. The latter, writing in the early 1st century AD, deals with Britain and Gaul as well as Hispania, Italy, and Galatia. Caesar wrote extensively about his Gallic Wars in 58–51 BC. Diodorus Siculus wrote about the Celts of Gaul and Britain in his 1st-century history.[citation needed] Diodorus Siculus and Strabo both suggest that the heartland of the people they call Celts was in southern Gaul. The former says that the Gauls were to the north of the Celts, but that the Romans referred to both as Gauls (linguistically the Gauls were certainly Celts). Before the discoveries at Hallstatt and La Tène, it was generally considered that the Celtic heartland was southern Gaul, see Encyclopædia Britannica for 1813.[citation needed] The Romans knew the Celts then living in present-day France as Gauls. The territory of these peoples probably included the Low Countries, the Alps and present-day northern Italy. Julius Caesar in his Gallic Wars described the 1st-century BC descendants of those Gauls.[citation needed] Eastern Gaul became the centre of the western La Tène culture. In later Iron Age Gaul, the social organisation resembled that of the Romans, with large towns. From the 3rd century BC the Gauls adopted coinage. Texts with Greek characters from southern Gaul have survived from the 2nd century BC.[71] Greek traders founded Massalia about 600 BC, with some objects (mostly drinking ceramic vessels) being traded up the Rhône valley. But trade became disrupted soon after 500 BC and re-oriented over the Alps to the Po valley in the Italian peninsula. The Romans arrived in the Rhone valley in the 2nd century BC and encountered a mostly Celtic-speaking Gaul. Rome wanted land communications with its Iberian provinces and fought a major battle with the Saluvii at Entremont in 124–123 BC. Gradually Roman control extended, and the Roman province of Gallia Transalpina developed along the Mediterranean coast.[72][73] The Romans knew the remainder of Gaul as Gallia Comata, 'Long-haired Gaul'.[74] In 58 BC, the Helvetii planned to migrate westward but Julius Caesar forced them back. He then became involved in fighting the various tribes in Gaul, and by 55 BC had overrun most of Gaul. In 52 BC, Vercingetorix led a revolt against Roman occupation but was defeated at the Battle of Alesia and surrendered.[75] Following the Gallic Wars of 58–51 BC, Caesar's Celtica formed the main part of Roman Gaul, becoming the province of Gallia Lugdunensis. This territory of the Celtic tribes was bounded on the south by the Garonne and on the north by the Seine and the Marne.[76] The Romans attached large swathes of this region to neighbouring provinces Belgica and Aquitania, particularly under Augustus.[77] Place- and personal-name analysis and inscriptions suggest that Gaulish was spoken over most of what is now France.[78][79] Until the end of the 19th century, traditional scholarship dealing with the Celts did acknowledge their presence in the Iberian Peninsula[80][81] as a material culture relatable to the Hallstatt and La Tène cultures. However, since according to the definition of the Iron Age in the 19th century Celtic populations were supposedly rare in Iberia and did not provide a cultural scenario that could easily be linked to that of Central Europe, the presence of Celtic culture in that region was generally not fully recognised. Modern scholarship, however, has proven that Celtic presence and influences were most substantial in what is today Spain and Portugal (with perhaps the highest settlement saturation in Western Europe), particularly in the central, western and northern regions.[82][83] In addition to Gauls infiltrating from the north of the Pyrenees, the Roman and Greek sources mention Celtic populations in three parts of the Iberian Peninsula: the eastern part of the Meseta (inhabited by the Celtiberians), the southwest (Celtici, in modern-day Alentejo) and the northwest (Gallaecia and Asturias).[84] A modern scholarly review[85] found several archaeological groups of Celts in Spain: The origins of the Celtiberians might provide a key to understanding the Celticisation process in the rest of the Peninsula. The process of Celticisation of the southwestern area of the peninsula by the Keltoi and of the northwestern area is, however, not a simple Celtiberian question. Recent investigations about the Callaici[90] and Bracari[91] in northwestern Portugal are providing new approaches to understanding Celtic culture (language, art and religion) in western Iberia.[92] John T. Koch of Aberystwyth University suggested that Tartessian inscriptions of the 8th century BC might be classified as Celtic. This would mean that Tartessian is the earliest attested trace of Celtic by a margin of more than a century.[93] In Germany by the late Bronze Age, the Urnfield culture (c. 1300 BC – c. 750 BC) had replaced the Bell Beaker, Unetice and Tumulus cultures in central Europe,[96] whilst the Nordic Bronze Age had developed in Scandinavia and northern Germany. The Hallstatt culture, which had developed from the Urnfield culture, was the predominant Western and Central European culture from the 12th to 8th centuries BC and during the early Iron Age (8th to 6th centuries BC). It was followed by the La Tène culture (5th to 1st centuries BC). The people who had adopted these cultural characteristics in central and southern Germany are regarded as Celts. Celtic cultural centres developed in central Europe during the late Bronze Age (c. 1200 BC until 700 BC). Some, like the Heuneburg, the oldest city north of the Alps,[97] grew to become important cultural centres of the Iron Age in Central Europe, that maintained trade routes to the Mediterranean. In the 5th century BC the Greek historian Herodotus mentioned a Celtic city at the Danube – Pyrene, that historians attribute to the Heuneburg. Beginning around 700 BC (or later), Germanic peoples (Germanic tribes) from southern Scandinavia and northern Germany expanded south and gradually replaced the Celtic peoples in Central Europe.[98][99][100][101][102][103] The Canegrate culture represented the first migratory wave of the proto-Celtic[104][105] population from the northwest part of the Alps that, through the Alpine passes, had already penetrated and settled in the western Po valley between Lake Maggiore and Lake Como (Scamozzina culture). It has also been proposed that a more ancient proto-Celtic presence can be traced back to the beginning of the Middle Bronze Age, when North Westwern Italy appears closely linked regarding the production of bronze artefacts, including ornaments, to the western groups of the Tumulus culture.[106] La Tène cultural material appeared over a large area of mainland Italy,[107] the southernmost example being the Celtic helmet from Canosa di Puglia.[108] Italy is home to Lepontic, the oldest attested Celtic language (from the 6th century BC).[109] Anciently spoken in Switzerland and in Northern-Central Italy, from the Alps to Umbria.[110][111][112][113] According to the Recueil des Inscriptions Gauloises, more than 760 Gaulish inscriptions have been found throughout present-day France – with the notable exception of Aquitaine – and in Italy,[114][115] which testifies the importance of Celtic heritage in the peninsula.[citation needed] In 391 BC, Celts \"who had their homes beyond the Alps streamed through the passes in great strength and seized the territory that lay between the Apennine Mountains and the Alps\" according to Diodorus Siculus. The Po Valley and the rest of northern Italy (known to the Romans as Cisalpine Gaul) was inhabited by Celtic-speakers who founded cities such as Milan.[116] Later the Roman army was routed at the battle of Allia and Rome was sacked in 390 BC by the Senones.[117] At the battle of Telamon in 225 BC, a large Celtic army was trapped between two Roman forces and crushed.[118] The defeat of the combined Samnite, Celtic and Etruscan alliance by the Romans in the Third Samnite War sounded the beginning of the end of the Celtic domination in mainland Europe, but it was not until 192 BC that the Roman armies conquered the last remaining independent Celtic kingdoms in Italy.[citation needed] The Celts also expanded down the Danube river and its tributaries. One of the most influential tribes, the Scordisci, established their capital at Singidunum (present-day Belgrade, Serbia) in the 3rd century BC. The concentration of hill-forts and cemeteries shows a dense population in the Tisza valley of modern-day Vojvodina, Serbia, Hungary and into Ukraine. Expansion into Romania was however blocked by the Dacians.[citation needed] The Serdi were a Celtic tribe[119] inhabiting Thrace. They were located around and founded Serdika (Bulgarian: Сердика, Latin: Ulpia Serdica, Greek: Σαρδῶν πόλις), now Sofia in Bulgaria,[120] which reflects their ethnonym. They would have established themselves in this area during the Celtic migrations at the end of the 4th century BC, though there is no evidence for their existence before the 1st century BC. Serdi are among traditional tribal names reported into the Roman era.[121] They were gradually Thracianized over the centuries but retained their Celtic character in material culture up to a late date.[when?][citation needed] According to other sources they may have been simply of Thracian origin,[122] according to others they may have become of mixed Thraco-Celtic origin. Further south, Celts settled in Thrace (Bulgaria), which they ruled for over a century, and Anatolia, where they settled as the Galatians (see also: Gallic Invasion of Greece). Despite their geographical isolation from the rest of the Celtic world, the Galatians maintained their Celtic language for at least 700 years. St Jerome, who visited Ancyra (modern-day Ankara) in 373 AD, likened their language to that of the Treveri of northern Gaul.[citation needed] For Venceslas Kruta, Galatia in central Turkey was an area of dense Celtic settlement.[citation needed] The Boii tribe gave their name to Bohemia, Bologna and possibly Bavaria, and Celtic artefacts and cemeteries have been discovered further east in what is now Poland and Slovakia. A Celtic coin (Biatec) from Bratislava's mint was displayed on the old Slovak 5-crown coin.[citation needed] As there is no archaeological evidence for large-scale invasions in some of the other areas, one current school of thought holds that Celtic language and culture spread to those areas by contact rather than invasion.[123] However, the Celtic invasions of Italy and the expedition in Greece and western Anatolia, are well documented in Greek and Latin history.[124][125] There are records of Celtic mercenaries in Egypt serving the Ptolemies. Thousands were employed in 283–246 BC and they were also in service around 186 BC. They attempted to overthrow Ptolemy II.[126] All living Celtic languages today belong to the Insular Celtic languages, derived from the Celtic languages spoken in Iron Age Britain and Ireland.[127] They separated into a Goidelic and a Brittonic branch early on. By the time of the Roman conquest of Britain in the 1st century AD, the Insular Celts were made up of the Celtic Britons, the Gaels (or Scoti), and the Picts (or Caledonians).[citation needed] The renown of insular Celts has caused a popular belief that Celtic clans only lived in the British Isles.[128] Linguists have debated whether a Celtic language came to the British Isles and then split, or whether the two branches arrived separately. The older view was that Celtic influence in the Isles was the result of successive migrations or invasions from the European mainland by diverse Celtic-speaking peoples over several centuries, accounting for the P-Celtic vs. Q-Celtic isogloss. This view has been challenged by the hypothesis that the islands' Celtic languages form an Insular Celtic dialect group.[129] In the 19th and 20th centuries, scholars often dated the \"arrival\" of Celtic culture in Britain (via an invasion model) to the 6th century BC, corresponding to archaeological evidence of Hallstatt influence and the appearance of chariot burials in what is now England. Cunliffe and Koch propose in their newer 'Celtic from the West' theory that Celtic languages reached the Isles earlier, with the Bell Beaker culture c.2500 BC, or even before this.[130][131] More recently, a major archaeogenetics study uncovered a migration into southern Britain in the Bronze Age from 1300 to 800 BC.[132] The newcomers were genetically most similar to ancient individuals from Gaul.[132] From 1000 BC, their genetic marker swiftly spread through southern Britain,[133] but not northern Britain.[132] The authors see this as a \"plausible vector for the spread of early Celtic languages into Britain\".[132] There was much less immigration during the Iron Age, so it is likely that Celtic reached Britain before then.[132] Cunliffe suggests that a branch of Celtic was already spoken in Britain, and the Bronze Age migration introduced the Brittonic branch.[134] Like many Celtic peoples on the mainland, the Insular Celts followed an Ancient Celtic religion overseen by druids. Some of the southern British tribes had strong links with Gaul and Belgica, and minted their own coins. During the Roman occupation of Britain, a Romano-British culture emerged in the southeast. The Britons and Picts in the north, and the Gaels of Ireland, remained outside the empire. During the end of Roman rule in Britain in the 400s AD, there was significant Anglo-Saxon settlement of eastern and southern Britain, and some Gaelic settlement of its western coast. During this time, some Britons migrated to the Armorican peninsula, where their culture became dominant. Meanwhile, much of northern Britain (Scotland) became Gaelic. By the 10th century AD, the Insular Celtic peoples had diversified into the Brittonic-speaking Welsh (in Wales), Cornish (in Cornwall), Bretons (in Brittany) and Cumbrians (in the Old North); and the Gaelic-speaking Irish (in Ireland), Scots (in Scotland) and Manx (on the Isle of Man).[citation needed] Classical writers did not call the inhabitants of Britain and Ireland Celtae or Κελτοί (Keltoi),[5][8][9] leading some scholars to question the use of the term 'Celt' for the Iron Age inhabitants of those islands.[5][8][9][10] The first historical account of the islands was by the Greek geographer Pytheas, who sailed around what he called the \"Pretannikai nesoi\" (the \"Pretannic isles\") around 310–306 BC.[135] In general, classical writers referred to the Britons as Pretannoi (in Greek) or Britanni (in Latin).[136] Strabo, writing in Roman times, distinguished between the Celts and Britons.[137] However, Roman historian Tacitus says the Britons resembled the Celts of Gaul in customs and religion.[11] Under Caesar the Romans conquered Celtic Gaul, and from Claudius onward the Roman empire absorbed parts of Britain. Roman local government of these regions closely mirrored pre-Roman tribal boundaries, and archaeological finds suggest native involvement in local government.[citation needed] The native peoples under Roman rule became Romanised and keen to adopt Roman ways. Celtic art had already incorporated classical influences, and surviving Gallo-Roman pieces interpret classical subjects or keep faith with old traditions despite a Roman overlay.[citation needed] The Roman occupation of Gaul, and to a lesser extent of Britain, led to Roman-Celtic syncretism. In the case of the continental Celts, this eventually resulted in a language shift to Vulgar Latin, while the Insular Celts retained their language.[citation needed] There was also considerable cultural influence exerted by Gaul on Rome, particularly in military matters and horsemanship, as the Gauls often served in the Roman cavalry. The Romans adopted the Celtic cavalry sword, the spatha, and Epona, the Celtic horse goddess.[138][139] To the extent that sources are available, they depict a pre-Christian Iron Age Celtic social structure based formally on class and kingship, although this may only have been a particular late phase of organisation in Celtic societies. Patron-client relationships similar to those of Roman society are also described by Caesar and others in the Gaul of the 1st century BC.[citation needed] In the main, the evidence is of tribes being led by kings, although some argue that there is also evidence of oligarchical republican forms of government eventually emerging in areas which had close contact with Rome. Most descriptions of Celtic societies portray them as being divided into three groups: a warrior aristocracy; an intellectual class including professions such as druid, poet, and jurist; and everyone else. In historical times, the offices of high and low kings in Ireland and Scotland were filled by election under the system of tanistry, which eventually came into conflict with the feudal principle of primogeniture in which succession goes to the first-born son.[citation needed] Little is known of family structure among the Celts. Patterns of settlement varied from decentralised to urban. The popular stereotype of non-urbanised societies settled in hillforts and duns,[140] drawn from Britain and Ireland (there are about 3,000 hill forts known in Britain)[141] contrasts with the urban settlements present in the core Hallstatt and La Tène areas, with the many significant oppida of Gaul late in the first millennium BC, and with the towns of Gallia Cisalpina.[citation needed] Slavery, as practised by the Celts, was very likely similar to the better documented practice in ancient Greece and Rome.[142] Slaves were acquired from war, raids, and penal and debt servitude.[142] Slavery was hereditary,[143] though manumission was possible. The Old Irish and Welsh words for 'slave', cacht and caeth respectively, are cognate with Latin captus 'captive' suggesting that the slave trade was an early means of contact between Latin and Celtic societies.[142] In the Middle Ages, slavery was especially prevalent in the Celtic countries.[144] Manumissions were discouraged by law and the word for 'female slave', cumal, was used as a general unit of value in Ireland.[145] There are only very limited records from pre-Christian times written in Celtic languages. These are mostly inscriptions in the Roman and sometimes Greek alphabets. The ogham script, an Early Medieval alphabet, was mostly used in early Christian times in Ireland and Scotland (but also in Wales and England), and was only used for ceremonial purposes such as inscriptions on gravestones. The available evidence is of a strong oral tradition, such as that preserved by bards in Ireland, and eventually recorded by monasteries. Celtic art also produced a great deal of intricate and beautiful metalwork, examples of which have been preserved by their distinctive burial rites.[146] In some regards the Atlantic Celts were conservative: for example, they still used chariots in combat long after they had been reduced to ceremonial roles by the Greeks and Romans. However, despite being outdated, Celtic chariot tactics were able to repel the invasions of Britain attempted by Julius Caesar.[147] According to Diodorus Siculus: The Gauls are tall of body with rippling muscles and white of skin and their hair is blond, and not only naturally so for they also make it their practice by artificial means to increase the distinguishing colour which nature has given it. For they are always washing their hair in limewater and they pull it back from the forehead to the nape of the neck, with the result that their appearance is like that of Satyrs and Pans since the treatment of their hair makes it so heavy and coarse that it differs in no respect from the mane of horses. Some of them shave the beard but others let it grow a little; and the nobles shave their cheeks but they let the moustache grow until it covers the mouth. During the later Iron Age the Gauls generally wore long-sleeved shirts or tunics and long trousers (called braccae by the Romans).[148] Clothes were made of wool or linen, with some silk being used by the rich. Cloaks were worn in the winter. Brooches[149] and armlets were used, but the most famous item of jewellery was the torc, a neck collar of metal, sometimes gold. The horned Waterloo Helmet in the British Museum, which long set the standard for modern images of Celtic warriors, is in fact a unique survival, and may have been a piece for ceremonial rather than military wear.[150] Archaeological evidence suggests that the pre-Roman Celtic societies were linked to the network of overland trade routes that spanned Eurasia. Archaeologists have discovered large prehistoric trackways crossing bogs in Ireland and Germany. Due to their substantial nature, these are believed to have been created for wheeled transport as part of an extensive roadway system that facilitated trade.[151] The territory held by the Celts contained tin, lead, iron, silver and gold.[152] Celtic smiths and metalworkers created weapons and jewellery for international trade, particularly with the Romans.[153] The myth that the Celtic monetary system consisted of wholly barter is a common one, but is in part false. The monetary system was complex and is still not understood (much like the late Roman coinages), and due to the absence of large numbers of coin items, it is assumed that \"proto-money\" was used. This included bronze items made from the early La Tène period and onwards, which were often in the shape of axeheads, rings, or bells. Due to the large number of these present in some burials, it is thought they had a relatively high monetary value, and could be used for \"day to day\" purchases. Low-value coinages of potin, a bronze alloy with high tin content, were minted in most Celtic areas of the continent and in South-East Britain prior to the Roman conquest of these lands. Higher-value coinages, suitable for use in trade, were minted in gold, silver, and high-quality bronze. Gold coinage was much more common than silver coinage, despite being worth substantially more, as while there were around 100 mines in Southern Britain and Central France, silver was more rarely mined. This was due partly to the relative sparsity of mines and the amount of effort needed for extraction compared to the profit gained. As the Roman civilisation grew in importance and expanded its trade with the Celtic world, silver and bronze coinage became more common. This coincided with a major increase in gold production in Celtic areas to meet the Roman demand, due to the high value Romans put on the metal. The large number of gold mines in France is thought to be a major reason why Caesar invaded.[154] Very few reliable sources exist regarding Celtic views on gender roles, though some archaeological evidence suggests their views may have differed from those of the Greco-Roman world, which tended to be less egalitarian.[155][156] Some Iron Age burials in northeastern Gaul suggest women may have had roles in warfare during the earlier La Tène period, but the evidence is far from conclusive.[157] Celtic individuals buried with both female jewellery and weaponry have been found, such as the Vix Grave in northeastern Gaul, and there are questions about the gender of some individuals buried with weaponry. However, it has been suggested that the weapons indicate high social rank rather than masculinity.[158] Most written accounts of the Ancient Celts are from the Romans and Greeks, though it is not clear how accurate these are. Roman historians Ammianus Marcellinus and Tacitus mentioned Celtic women inciting, participating in, and leading battles.[159] Plutarch reports that Celtic women acted as ambassadors to avoid a war among Celtic chiefdoms in the Po valley during the 4th century BC.[160] Posidonius' anthropological comments on the Celts had common themes, primarily primitivism, extreme ferocity, cruel sacrificial practices, and the strength and courage of their women.[161] Cassius Dio suggests there was great sexual freedom among women in Celtic Britain:[162] ... a very witty remark is reported to have been made by the wife of Argentocoxus, a Caledonian, to Julia Augusta. When the empress was jesting with her, after the treaty, about the free intercourse of her sex with men in Britain, she replied: \"We fulfill the demands of nature in a much better way than do you Roman women; for we consort openly with the best men, whereas you let yourselves be debauched in secret by the vilest\". Such was the retort of the British woman. Barry Cunliffe writes that such references are \"likely to be ill-observed\" and meant to portray the Celts as outlandish \"barbarians\".[163] Historian Lisa Bitel argues the descriptions of Celtic women warriors are not credible. She says some Roman and Greek writers wanted to show that the barbarian Celts lived in \"an upside-down world ... and a standard ingredient in such a world was the manly warrior woman\".[164] The Greek philosopher Aristotle wrote in his Politics that the Celts of southeastern Europe approved of male homosexuality. Greek historian Diodorus Siculus wrote in his Bibliotheca historica that although Gaulish women were beautiful, the men had \"little to do with them\" and it was a custom for men to sleep on animal skins with two younger males. He further claimed that \"the young men will offer themselves to strangers and are insulted if the offer is refused\". His claim was later repeated by Greco-Roman writers Athenaeus and Ammianus.[165] H. David Rankin, in Celts and the Classical World, suggests some of these claims refer to bonding rituals in warrior groups, which required abstinence from women at certain times,[166] and says it probably reflects \"the warlike character of early contacts between the Celts and the Greeks\".[167] Under Brehon Law, which was written down in early Medieval Ireland after conversion to Christianity, a woman had the right to divorce her husband and gain his property if he was unable to perform his marital duties due to impotence, obesity, homosexual inclination or preference for other women.[168][169][failed verification] Celtic art is generally used by art historians to refer to art of the La Tène period across Europe, while the Early Medieval art of Britain and Ireland, that is what \"Celtic art\" evokes for much of the general public, is called Insular art in art history. Both styles absorbed considerable influences from non-Celtic sources, but retained a preference for geometrical decoration over figurative subjects, which are often extremely stylised when they do appear; narrative scenes only appear under outside influence. Energetic circular forms, triskeles and spirals are characteristic. Much of the surviving material is in precious metal, which no doubt gives a very unrepresentative picture, but apart from Pictish stones and the Insular high crosses, large monumental sculpture, even with decorative carving, is very rare; possibly it was originally common in wood. Celts were also able to create developed musical instruments such as the carnyces, these famous war trumpets used before the battle to frighten the enemy, as the best preserved found in Tintignac (Gaul) in 2004 and which were decorated with a boar head or a snake head.[170] The interlace patterns that are often regarded as typical of \"Celtic art\" were characteristic of the whole of the British Isles, a style referred to as Insular art, or Hiberno-Saxon art. This artistic style incorporated elements of La Tène, Late Roman, and, most importantly, animal Style II of Germanic Migration Period art. The style was taken up with great skill and enthusiasm by Celtic artists in metalwork and illuminated manuscripts. Equally, the forms used for the finest Insular art were all adopted from the Roman world: Gospel books like the Book of Kells and Book of Lindisfarne, chalices like the Ardagh Chalice and Derrynaflan Chalice, and penannular brooches like the Tara Brooch and Roscrea Brooch. These works are from the period of peak achievement of Insular art, which lasted from the 7th to the 9th centuries, before the Viking attacks sharply set back cultural life.[citation needed] In contrast the less well known but often spectacular art of the richest earlier Continental Celts, before they were conquered by the Romans, often adopted elements of Roman, Greek and other \"foreign\" styles (and possibly used imported craftsmen) to decorate objects that were distinctively Celtic. After the Roman conquests, some Celtic elements remained in popular art, especially Ancient Roman pottery, of which Gaul was actually the largest producer, mostly in Italian styles, but also producing work in local taste, including figurines of deities and wares painted with animals and other subjects in highly formalised styles. Roman Britain also took more interest in enamel than most of the Empire, and its development of champlevé technique was probably important to the later Medieval art of the whole of Europe, of which the energy and freedom of Insular decoration was an important element. Rising nationalism brought Celtic revivals from the 19th century.[citation needed] The Coligny calendar, which was found in 1897 in Coligny, Ain, was engraved on a bronze tablet, preserved in 73 fragments, that originally was 1.48 metres (4 feet 10 inches) wide and 0.9 metres (2 feet 11 inches) high (Lambert p. 111). Based on the style of lettering and the accompanying objects, it probably dates to the end of the 2nd century.[171] It is written in Latin inscriptional capitals, and is in Gaulish. The restored tablet contains 16 vertical columns, with 62 months distributed over 5 years.[citation needed] French archaeologist J. Monard speculated that it was recorded by druids wishing to preserve their tradition of timekeeping in a time when the Julian calendar was imposed throughout the Roman Empire. However, the general form of the calendar suggests the public peg calendars (or parapegmata) found throughout the Greek and Roman world.[172] Tribal warfare appears to have been a regular feature of Celtic societies. While epic literature depicts this as more of a sport focused on raids and hunting rather than organised territorial conquest, the historical record is more of tribes using warfare to exert political control and harass rivals, for economic advantage, and in some instances to conquer territory.[citation needed] The Celts were described by classical writers such as Strabo, Livy, Pausanias, and Florus as fighting like \"wild beasts\", and as hordes. Dionysius said that their:[173] [174] manner of fighting, being in large measure that of wild beasts and frenzied, was an erratic procedure, quite lacking in military science. Thus, at one moment they would raise their swords aloft and smite after the manner of wild boars, throwing the whole weight of their bodies into the blow like hewers of wood or men digging with mattocks, and again they would deliver crosswise blows aimed at no target, as if they intended to cut to pieces the entire bodies of their adversaries, protective armour and all. Polybius (2.33) indicates that the principal Celtic weapon was a long bladed sword which was used for hacking edgewise rather than stabbing. Celtic warriors are described by Polybius and Plutarch as frequently having to cease fighting in order to straighten their sword blades. This claim has been questioned by some archaeologists, who note that Noric steel, steel produced in Celtic Noricum, was famous in the Roman Empire period and was used to equip the Roman military.[175][176] However, Radomir Pleiner, in The Celtic Sword (1993) argues that \"the metallographic evidence shows that Polybius was right up to a point\", as around one third of surviving swords from the period might well have behaved as he describes.[177] In addition to these long bladed slashing swords, spears and specialized javelins were also used.[178] Polybius also asserts that certain of the Celts fought naked: \"The appearance of these naked warriors was a terrifying spectacle, for they were all men of splendid physique and in the prime of life.\"[179] According to Livy, this was also true of the Celts of Asia Minor.[180] Celts had a reputation as head hunters.[181] Paul Jacobsthal says: \"Amongst the Celts the human head was venerated above all else, since the head was to the Celt the soul, centre of the emotions as well as of life itself, a symbol of divinity and of the powers of the other-world.\"[182] Writing in the first century BC, Greek historians Posidonius and Diodorus Siculus said Celtic warriors cut off the heads of enemies slain in battle, hung them from the necks of their horses, then nailed them up outside their homes.[181] Strabo wrote in the same century that Celts embalmed the heads of their most esteemed enemies in cedar oil and put them on display.[181] Roman historian Livy wrote that the Boii beheaded a defeated Roman general after the Battle of Silva Litana, covered his skull in gold, and used it as a ritual cup.[181] Archaeologists have found evidence that heads were embalmed and displayed by the southern Gauls.[183][184] In another example, at the southern Gaulish site of Entremont, there stood a pillar carved with skulls, within which were niches where human skulls were kept, nailed into position.[185] Roquepertuse nearby has similar carved heads and skull niches. Many lone carved heads have been found in Celtic regions, some with two or three faces.[186] Examples include the Mšecké Žehrovice Head and the Corleck Head. Severed heads are a common motif in Insular Celtic myths, and there are many tales in which 'living heads' preside over feasts or speak prophecies.[181][186] The beheading game is a motif in Irish myth and Arthurian legend, most famously in the tale Sir Gawain and the Green Knight, where the Green Knight picks up his own severed head after Gawain has struck it off. There are also many legends in Celtic regions of saints who carry their own severed heads. In Irish myth, the severed heads of warriors are called the mast or nuts of the goddess Macha.[187] Like other European Iron Age societies, the Celts practised a polytheistic religion and believed in an afterlife.[188][189][unreliable source] Celtic religion varied by region and over time, but had \"broad structural similarities\",[188] and there was \"a basic religious homogeneity\" among the Celtic peoples.[190] Because the ancient Celts did not have writing, evidence about their religion is gleaned from archaeology, Greco-Roman accounts, and literature from the early Christian period.[191] The names of over two hundred Celtic deities have survived (see list of Celtic deities), although it is likely that many of these were alternative names, regional names or titles for the same deity.[188] Some deities were venerated only in one region, but others were more widely known.[188] According to Miranda Aldhouse-Green, the Celts were also animists, believing that every part of the natural world had a spirit.[191] The Celts seem to have had a father god, who was often a god of the tribe and of the dead (Toutatis probably being one name for him); and a mother goddess who was associated with the land, earth and fertility[192] (Dea Matrona probably being one name for her). The mother goddess could also take the form of a war goddess as protectress of her tribe and its land.[192] There also seems to have been a male celestial god—identified with Taranis—associated with thunder, the wheel, and the bull.[192] There were gods of skill and craft, such as the pan-regional god Lugus, and the smith god Gobannos.[192] Celtic healing deities were often associated with sacred springs,[192] such as Sirona and Borvo. Other pan-regional deities include the horned god Cernunnos, the horse and fertility goddess Epona, the divine son Maponos, as well as Belenos, Ogmios, and Sucellos.[188][191] Caesar says the Gauls believed they all descended from a god of the dead and underworld.[188] Triplicity is a common theme in Celtic cosmology, and a number of deities were seen as threefold,[193] for example the Three Mothers.[194] Celtic religious ceremonies were overseen by priests known as druids, who also served as judges, teachers, and lore-keepers. Other classes of druids performed sacrifices for the perceived benefit of the community.[195] There is evidence that ancient Celtic peoples sacrificed animals, almost always livestock or working animals. It appears some were offered wholly to the gods (by burying or burning), while some were shared between gods and humans (part eaten and part offered).[196] There is also some evidence that ancient Celts sacrificed humans, and some Greco-Roman sources claim the Gauls sacrificed criminals by burning them in a wicker man.[197] The Romans said the Celts held ceremonies in sacred groves and other natural shrines, called nemetons.[188] Some Celtic peoples built temples or ritual enclosures of varying shapes (such as the Romano-Celtic temple and viereckschanze), though they also maintained shrines at natural sites.[188] Celtic peoples often made votive offerings: treasured items deposited in water and wetlands, or in ritual shafts and wells, often in the same place over generations.[188] Modern clootie wells might be a continuation of this.[198] Most surviving Celtic mythology belongs to the Insular Celtic peoples: Irish mythology has the largest written body of myths, followed by Welsh mythology. These were written down in the early Middle Ages, mainly by Christian scribes. The supernatural race called the Tuatha Dé Danann are believed to represent the main Celtic gods of Ireland. Their traditional rivals are the Fomóire, whom they defeat in the Battle of Mag Tuired.[199] Barry Cunliffe says the underlying structure in Irish myth was a dualism between the male tribal god and the female goddess of the land.[188] The Dagda seems to have been the chief god and the Morrígan his consort, each of whom had other names.[188] One common motif is the sovereignty goddess, who represents the land and bestows sovereignty on a king by marrying him. The goddess Brigid was linked with nature as well as poetry, healing and smithing.[193] Some figures in medieval Insular Celtic myth have ancient continental parallels: Irish Lugh and Welsh Lleu are cognate with Lugus, Goibniu and Gofannon with Gobannos, Macán and Mabon with Maponos, while Macha and Rhiannon may be counterparts of Epona.[200] In Insular Celtic myth, the Otherworld is a parallel realm where the gods dwell. Some mythical heroes visit it by entering ancient burial mounds or caves, by going under water or across the western sea, or after being offered a silver apple branch by an Otherworld resident.[201] Irish myth says that the spirits of the dead travel to the house of Donn (Tech Duinn), a legendary ancestor; this echoes Caesar's comment that the Gauls believed they all descended from a god of the dead and underworld.[188] Insular Celtic peoples celebrated four seasonal festivals, known to the Gaels as Beltaine (1 May), Lughnasa (1 August), Samhain (1 November) and Imbolc (1 February).[188] The Roman invasion of Gaul brought a great deal of Celtic peoples into the Roman Empire. Roman culture had a profound effect on the Celtic tribes which came under the empire's control. Roman influence led to many changes in Celtic religion, the most noticeable of which was the weakening of the druid class, especially religiously; the druids were to eventually disappear altogether. Romano-Celtic deities also began to appear: these deities often had both Roman and Celtic attributes, combined the names of Roman and Celtic deities, or included couples with one Roman and one Celtic deity. Other changes included the adaptation of the Jupiter Column, a sacred column set up in many Celtic regions of the empire, primarily in northern and eastern Gaul. Another major change in religious practice was the use of stone monuments to represent gods and goddesses. The Celts had probably only created wooden cult images (including monuments carved into trees, which were known as sacred poles) before the Roman conquest.[194] While the regions under Roman rule adopted Christianity along with the rest of the Roman empire, unconquered areas of Ireland and Scotland began to move from Celtic polytheism to Christianity in the 5th century. Ireland was converted by missionaries from Britain, such as Saint Patrick. Later missionaries from Ireland were a major source of missionary work in Scotland, Anglo-Saxon parts of Britain, and central Europe (see Hiberno-Scottish mission). Celtic Christianity, the forms of Christianity that took hold in Britain and Ireland at this time, had for some centuries only limited and intermittent contact with Rome and continental Christianity, as well as some contacts with Coptic Christianity. Some elements of Celtic Christianity developed, or retained, features that made them distinct from the rest of Western Christianity, most famously their conservative method of calculating the date of Easter. In 664, the Synod of Whitby began to resolve these differences, mostly by adopting the current Roman practices, which the Gregorian Mission from Rome had introduced to Anglo-Saxon England.[citation needed] Genetic studies on the limited amount of material available suggest continuity between Iron Age people from areas considered Celtic and the earlier Bell Beaker culture of Bronze Age Western Europe.[205][206][207] Like the Bell Beakers, ancient Celts carried a substantial amount of Western Steppe Herders ancestry, which is derived from Yamnaya pastoralists who expanded westwards from the Pontic–Caspian steppe during the late Neolithic and the early Bronze Age and associated with the initial spread of Indo-European languages.[208] This ancestry was particularly prevalent among Celts of Northwest Europe.[207] Examined individuals overwhelmingly carry types of the paternal haplogroup R-M269,[202][203][204] while the maternal haplogroups H and U are frequent.[209][210] These lineages are associated with steppe ancestry.[202][209] The spread of Celts into Iberia and the emergence of the Celtiberians is associated with an increase in north-central European ancestry in Iberia, and may be connected to the expansion of the Urnfield culture.[211] The paternal haplogroup haplogroup I2a1a1a has been detected among Celtiberians.[212] There appears to have been significant gene flow among Celtic peoples of Western Europe during the Iron Age.[213][207] While the Gauls of southern France display genetic links with the Celtiberians, the Gauls of northern France display links with Great Britain and Sweden.[214] Modern populations of Western Europe, particularly those who still speak Celtic languages, display substantial genetic continuity with the Iron Age populations of the same areas.[215][216][217] Geography Organisations",

                "title": "Pronunciation of Celtic: Why are there two ways? | Merriam-Webster",
                "content": "Celtic refers to Irish culture and heritage, along with the historical people who migrated from the British Isles throughout much of Europe. While the early pronunciation was with an /s/ sound, reflecting its nearest origin in French, the modern standard is a hard \"c\" sound like /k/. This is because language historians desired the word to better reflect its Greek and Classical Latin origins. The soft \"c\" sound is usually reserved for sports teams now, like the Boston Celtics. Be it in the pub or in the halls of academia, whenever the topic of Irish culture, language, music, literature—basically, anything Irish—is brought up, the words Celt and Celtic are bound to be heard. In modern-day English, those words are commonly used in reference to the Irish people and their widely-accepted traditions (of course everybody is Irish on St. Patrick's Day; the Celtic cross or knot is a popular tattoo; the Claddagh ring makes a nice gift). The \\k\\ pronunciation for Celt and Celtic dates to the 18th century. The \\k\\ pronunciation for Celt and Celtic dates to the 18th century. The \\k\\ pronunciation for Celt and Celtic dates to the 18th century. The etymology of the noun Celt—from which the adjective Celtic is derived—is straightforward. It's a 16th-century borrowing of the French word Celte, which itself is from Latin Celta, the singular of Celtae, which is the name for a member of an early Indo-European people from antiquity who spread over much of Europe from the British Isles and Spain to Asia Minor. The Latin name is derived from Greek Keltoi, and both the Latin and Greek words referred to the Gauls, the Celtic people who occupied the region that is now France and Belgium. See? Straightforward. With that history laid out, we're wondering how you pronounced all the capital 'c' and 'k' words, especially if you're unfamiliar with French, Latin, Greek, and even English Celt and Celtic, for that matter. The question: is the 'c' sounded \\s\\ or \\k\\? Following its French and Latin predecessors, early pronunciation of Celt was actually \\SELT\\. (In French and Latin, the 'c' is pronounced \\s\\, as in the last name of the French painter Paul Cézanne and in Latin century.) The pronunciation \\KELT\\ started being heard as early as the 18th century, which, in time, ushered in the variant spelling Kelt. The variants were introduced by language and history academics who believed that the pronunciation of Celt should reflect the initial \\k\\ sound in the ancient Greek Keltoi and the Classical Latin Celtae. (It wasn't until the Middle Ages that the letter 'c' in Latin began being pronounced before vowels as the combination \\ts\\—prior, it was pronounced \\k\\; English speakers subsequently reduced the Latin 'c' to a simple \\s\\.) Outside of academia, the variant Kelt never caught on, and it is rarely if ever used today; however, the \\k\\ pronunciation for Celt and Celtic has since flourished. Another influence on pronouncing Celt and Celtic with a soft 'c' is English's phonetic rule for 'c' when followed by 'e' (or 'i,' as in circus or Cicero), which says that, in such cases, the 'c' is usually pronounced as \\s\\. Think cell, cereal, ceiling, and dance. Nevertheless, English speakers, especially those who wanted to sound knowledgeable about things Celtic, grew to prefer the hard 'c' pronunciation, which harkened back to the words' ancient roots. From the 18th century onward, more and more people began sounding the words with an initial \\k\\. By the mid-20th century, \\k\\ became the norm, which is fitting since the pronunciation is in line with that of the Celtic family of languages that include Irish, Scottish Gaelic, Welsh, Breton, and the now-extinct (or, depending on who you talk to, nearly extinct) languages Manx and Cornish. Apparently, people appreciated the ethnic pronunciation. This shift in the pronunciation of Celt is fully evinced when comparing H. W. Fowler's 1926 Dictionary of Modern English with Robert Burchfield's 1996 revised edition. Here's what Fowler had to say about Celt(ic): \"The spelling C-, & the pronunciation s-, are the established ones, & no useful purpose seems to be served by the substitution of k-.\" Decades later, Burchfield observes a different trend: \"Except for the football club Celtic (in Glasgow), which is pronounced [SEL-tik], both Celt and Celtic are pronounced with initial \\k\\ in standard English.\" Burchfield is referring to the Scottish Celtic Football Club, founded in 1887. In America, there is basketball's Boston Celtics, founded in 1946, whose name is also pronounced with an initial \\s\\. The European away support that Celtic enjoys is phenomenal. Few clubs have a fanbase that travels in such numbers or makes as much noise, all the more remarkable when you consider the poor record that the club has away from home in recent times.— Liam Kelly, The Celtic Star, 20 Feb. 2020 Aside from this use of the initial soft 'c' in sports teams' names, Celtic with a hard 'c' is the standard; however, you might still sometimes hear the 'c' softly sounded by those who are uninitiated in the history and etymology of Celt and Celtic as well as those who are unfamiliar with the words and resort to the phonetic rules of English. (And, as happens so often in English, those phonetic rules let them down.) See Definitions and Examples » Get Word of the Day daily email! Learn a new word every day.

                "title": "Celtic Britons - Wikipedia",
                "content": "The Britons (*Pritanī, Latin: Britanni, Welsh: Brythoniaid), also known as Celtic Britons[1] or Ancient Britons, were the indigenous Celtic people[2] who inhabited Great Britain from at least the British Iron Age until the High Middle Ages, at which point they diverged into the Welsh, Cornish, and Bretons (among others).[2] They spoke Common Brittonic, the ancestor of the modern Brittonic languages.[2] The earliest written evidence for the Britons is from Greco-Roman writers and dates to the Iron Age.[2] Ancient Britain was made up of many tribes and kingdoms, associated with various hillforts. The Britons followed an Ancient Celtic religion overseen by druids. Some of the southern tribes had strong links with mainland Europe, especially Gaul and Belgica, and minted their own coins. The Roman Empire conquered most of Britain in the 1st century AD, creating the province of Britannia. The Romans invaded northern Britain, but the Britons and Caledonians in the north remained unconquered and Hadrian's Wall became the edge of the empire. A Romano-British culture emerged, mainly in the southeast, and British Latin coexisted with Brittonic.[3] It is unclear what relationship the Britons had with the Picts, who lived outside of the empire in northern Britain, however, most scholars today accept the fact that the Pictish language was closely related to Common Brittonic.[4] Following the end of Roman rule in Britain during the 5th century, Anglo-Saxon settlement of eastern and southern Britain began. The culture and language of the Britons fragmented, and much of their territory gradually became Anglo-Saxon, while the north became subject to a similar settlement by Gaelic-speaking tribes from Ireland. The extent to which this cultural change was accompanied by wholesale population changes is still debated. During this time, Britons migrated to mainland Europe and established significant colonies in Brittany (now part of France), the Channel Islands,[5] and Britonia (now part of Galicia, Spain).[2] By the 11th century, Brittonic-speaking populations had split into distinct groups: the Welsh in Wales, the Cornish in Cornwall, the Bretons in Brittany, the Cumbrians of the Hen Ogledd (\"Old North\") in southern Scotland and northern England, and the remnants of the Pictish people in northern Scotland.[6] Common Brittonic developed into the distinct Brittonic languages: Welsh, Cumbric, Cornish and Breton.[2] In Celtic studies, 'Britons' refers to native speakers of the Brittonic languages in the ancient and medieval periods, \"from the first evidence of such speech in the pre-Roman Iron Age, until the central Middle Ages\".[2] The earliest known reference to the inhabitants of Britain was made by Pytheas, a Greek geographer who made a voyage of exploration around the British Isles between 330 and 320 BC. Although none of his own writings remain, writers during the following centuries make frequent reference to them. The ancient Greeks called the people of Britain the Pretanoí or Bretanoí.[2] Pliny's Natural History (77 AD) says the older name for the island was Albion,[2] and Avienius calls it insula Albionum, \"island of the Albions\".[7][8] The name could have reached Pytheas from the Gauls.[8] The Latin name for the Britons was Britanni.[2][9] The P-Celtic ethnonym has been reconstructed as *Pritanī, from Common Celtic *kʷritu, which became Old Irish cruth and Old Welsh pryd.[2] This likely means \"people of the forms\", and could be linked to the Latin name Picti (the Picts), which is usually explained as meaning \"painted people\".[2] The Old Welsh name for the Picts was Prydyn.[10] Linguist Kim McCone suggests the name became restricted to inhabitants of the far north after Cymry displaced it as the name for the Welsh and Cumbrians.[11] The Welsh prydydd, \"maker of forms\", was also a term for the highest grade of a bard.[2] The medieval Welsh form of Latin Britanni was Brython (singular and plural).[2] Brython was introduced into English usage by John Rhys in 1884 as a term unambiguously referring to the P-Celtic speakers of Great Britain, to complement Goidel; hence the adjective Brythonic refers to the group of languages.[12] \"Brittonic languages\" is a more recent coinage (first attested in 1923 according to the Oxford English Dictionary). In the early Middle Ages, following the Anglo-Saxon settlement of Britain, the Anglo-Saxons called all Britons Bryttas or Wealas (Welsh), while they continued to be called Britanni or Brittones in Medieval Latin.[2] From the 11th century, they are more often referred to separately as the Welsh, Cumbrians, Cornish, and Bretons, as they had separate political histories from then.[2] From the early 16th century, and especially after the Acts of Union 1707, the terms British and Briton could be applied to all inhabitants of the Kingdom of Great Britain, including the English, Scottish, and some Irish, or the subjects of the British Empire generally.[13] The Britons spoke an Insular Celtic language known as Common Brittonic. Brittonic was spoken throughout the island of Britain (in modern terms, England, Wales, and Scotland).[2][14] According to early medieval historical tradition, such as The Dream of Macsen Wledig, the post-Roman Celtic speakers of Armorica were colonists from Britain, resulting in the Breton language, a language related to Welsh and identical to Cornish in the early period, and is still used today. Thus, the area today is called Brittany (Br. Breizh, Fr. Bretagne, derived from Britannia). Common Brittonic developed from the Insular branch of the Proto-Celtic language that developed in the British Isles after arriving from the continent in the 7th century BC. The language eventually began to diverge; some linguists have grouped subsequent developments as Western and Southwestern Brittonic languages. Western Brittonic developed into Welsh in Wales and the Cumbric language in the Hen Ogledd or \"Old North\" of Britain (modern northern England and southern Scotland), while the Southwestern dialect became Cornish in Cornwall and South West England and Breton in Armorica. Pictish is now generally accepted to descend from Common Brittonic, rather than being a separate Celtic language. Welsh and Breton survive today; Cumbric and Pictish became extinct in the 12th century. Cornish had become extinct by the 19th century but has been the subject of language revitalization since the 20th century.[citation needed] Celtic Britain was made up of many territories controlled by Brittonic tribes. They are generally believed to have dwelt throughout the whole island of Great Britain, at least as far north as the Clyde–Forth isthmus. The territory north of this was largely inhabited by the Picts; little direct evidence has been left of the Pictish language, but place names and Pictish personal names recorded in the later Irish annals suggest it was indeed related to the Common Brittonic language.[15] Their Goidelic (Gaelic) name, Cruithne, is cognate with Pritenī. The following is a list of the major Brittonic tribes, in both the Latin and Brittonic languages, as well as their capitals during the Roman period. The La Tène style, which covers British Celtic art, was late arriving in Britain, but after 300 BC the Ancient British seem to have had generally similar cultural practices to the Celtic cultures nearest to them on the continent. There are significant differences in artistic styles, and the greatest period of what is known as the \"Insular La Tène\" style, surviving mostly in metalwork, was in the century or so before the Roman conquest, and perhaps the decades after it.[citation needed] The carnyx, a trumpet with an animal-headed bell, was used by Celtic Britons during war and ceremony.[16][17] There are competing hypotheses for when Celtic peoples, and the Celtic languages, first arrived in Britain, none of which have gained consensus. The traditional view during most of the twentieth century was that Celtic culture grew out of the central European Hallstatt culture, from which the Celts and their languages reached Britain in the second half of the first millennium BC.[18][19] More recently, John Koch and Barry Cunliffe have challenged that with their 'Celtic from the West' theory, which has the Celtic languages developing as a maritime trade language in the Atlantic Bronze Age cultural zone before it spread eastward.[20] Alternatively, Patrick Sims-Williams criticizes both of these hypotheses to propose 'Celtic from the Centre', which suggests Celtic originated in Gaul and spread during the first millennium BC, reaching Britain towards the end of this period.[21] In 2021, a major archaeogenetics study uncovered a migration into southern Britain during the Bronze Age, over a 500-year period from 1,300 BC to 800 BC.[22] The migrants were \"genetically most similar to ancient individuals from France\" and had higher levels of Early European Farmers ancestry.[22] From 1000 to 875 BC, their genetic marker swiftly spread through southern Britain,[23] making up around half the ancestry of subsequent Iron Age people in this area, but not in northern Britain.[22] The \"evidence suggests that rather than a violent invasion or a single migratory event, the genetic structure of the population changed through sustained contacts between mainland Britain and Europe over several centuries, such as the movement of traders, intermarriage, and small-scale movements of family groups\".[23] The authors describe this as a \"plausible vector for the spread of early Celtic languages into Britain\".[22] There was much less migration into Britain during the subsequent Iron Age, so it is more likely that Celtic reached Britain before then.[22] Barry Cunliffe suggests that a branch of Celtic was already being spoken in Britain and that the Bronze Age migration introduced the Brittonic branch.[24] The Anglo-Saxon Chronicle, which was originally compiled by the orders of King Alfred the Great in approximately 890, starts with this sentence: \"The island Britain is 800 miles long and 200 miles broad. And there are in the island five nations; English, Welsh (or British), Scottish, Pictish, and Latin. The first inhabitants were the Britons, who came from Armenia, and first peopled Britain southward\" (\"Armenia\" is possibly a mistaken transcription of Armorica, an area in northwestern Gaul including modern Brittany).[25] In 43 AD, the Roman Empire invaded Britain. The British tribes opposed the Roman legions for many decades, but by 84 AD the Romans had decisively conquered southern Britain and had pushed into Brittonic areas of what would later become northern England and southern Scotland. During the same period, Belgic tribes from the Gallic-Germanic borderlands settled in southern Britain. Caesar asserts the Belgae had first crossed the channel as raiders, only later establishing themselves on the island.[26] 122 AD, the Romans fortified the northern border with Hadrian's Wall, which spanned what is now Northern England. In 142 AD, Roman forces pushed north again and began construction of the Antonine Wall, which ran between the Forth–Clyde isthmus, but they retreated back to Hadrian's Wall after only twenty years. Although the native Britons south of Hadrian's Wall mostly kept their land, they were subject to the Roman governors, whilst the Brittonic-Pictish Britons north of the wall probably remained fully independent and unconquered. The Roman Empire retained control of \"Britannia\" until its departure about AD 410, although parts of Britain had already effectively shrugged off Roman rule decades earlier.[citation needed] Thirty years or so after the time of the Roman departure, the Germanic-speaking Anglo-Saxons began a migration to the south-eastern coast of Britain, where they began to establish their own kingdoms, and the Gaelic-speaking Scots migrated from Dál nAraidi (modern Northern Ireland) to the west coast of Scotland and the Isle of Man.[27][28] At the same time, Britons established themselves in what is now called Brittany and the Channel Islands. There they set up their own small kingdoms and the Breton language developed from Brittonic Insular Celtic rather than Gaulish or Frankish. A further Brittonic colony, Britonia, was also set up at this time in Gallaecia in northwestern Spain. Many of the old Brittonic kingdoms began to disappear in the centuries after the Anglo-Saxon and Scottish Gaelic invasions; Parts of the regions of modern East Anglia, East Midlands, North East England, Argyll, and South East England were the first to fall to the Germanic and Gaelic Scots invasions. The kingdom of Ceint (modern Kent) fell in 456 AD. Linnuis (which stood astride modern Lincolnshire and Nottinghamshire) was subsumed as early as 500 AD and became the English Kingdom of Lindsey. Regni (essentially modern Sussex and eastern Hampshire) was likely fully conquered by 510 AD. Ynys Weith (Isle of Wight) fell in 530 AD, Caer Colun (essentially modern Essex) by 540 AD. The Gaels arrived on the northwest coast of Britain from Ireland, dispossessed the native Britons, and founded Dal Riata which encompassed modern Argyll, Skye, and Iona between 500 and 560 AD. Deifr (Deira) which encompassed modern-day Teesside, Wearside, Tyneside, Humberside, Lindisfarne (Medcaut), and the Farne Islands fell to the Anglo-Saxons in 559 AD and Deira became an Anglo-Saxon kingdom after this point.[29] Caer Went had officially disappeared by 575 AD becoming the Anglo-Saxon kingdom of East Anglia. Gwent was only partly conquered; its capital Caer Gloui (Gloucester) was taken by the Anglo-Saxons in 577 AD, handing Gloucestershire and Wiltshire to the invaders, while the westernmost part remained in Brittonic hands, and continued to exist in modern Wales. Caer Lundein, encompassing London, St. Albans and parts of the Home Counties,[30] fell from Brittonic hands by 600 AD, and Bryneich, which existed in modern Northumbria and County Durham with its capital of Din Guardi (modern Bamburgh) and which included Ynys Metcaut (Lindisfarne), had fallen by 605 AD becoming Anglo-Saxon Bernicia.[31] Caer Celemion (in modern Hampshire and Berkshire) had fallen by 610 AD. Elmet, a large kingdom that covered much of modern Yorkshire, Lancashire, and Cheshire and likely had its capital at modern Leeds, was conquered by the Anglo-Saxons in 627 AD. Pengwern, which covered Staffordshire, Shropshire, Herefordshire, and Worcestershire, was largely destroyed in 656 AD, with only its westernmost parts in modern Wales remaining under the control of the Britons, and it is likely that Cynwidion, which had stretched from modern Bedfordshire to Northamptonshire, fell in the same general period as Pengwern, though a sub-kingdom of Calchwynedd may have clung on in the Chilterns for a time.[citation needed] Novant, which occupied Galloway and Carrick, was soon subsumed by fellow Brittonic-Pictish polities by 700 AD. Aeron, which encompassed modern Ayrshire,[32] was conquered by the Anglo-Saxon kingdom of Northumbria by 700 AD. Some Brittonic kingdoms were able to successfully resist these incursions: Rheged (encompassing much of modern Northumberland and County Durham and areas of southern Scotland and the Scottish Borders) survived well into the 8th century AD, before the eastern part peacefully joined with the Anglo-Saxon kingdom of Bernicia–Northumberland by 730 AD, and the west was taken over by the fellow Britons of Ystrad Clud.[33][34] Similarly, the kingdom of Gododdin, which appears to have had its court at Din Eidyn (modern Edinburgh) and encompassed parts of modern Northumbria, County Durham, Lothian and Clackmannanshire, endured until approximately 775 AD before being divided by fellow Brittonic Picts, Gaelic Scots and Anglo-Saxons. The Kingdom of Cait, covering modern Caithness, Sutherland, Orkney, and Shetland, was conquered by Gaelic Scots in 871 AD. Dumnonia (encompassing Cornwall, Devonshire, and the Isles of Scilly) was partly conquered during the mid 9th century AD, with most of modern Devonshire being annexed by the Anglo-Saxons, but leaving Cornwall, the Isles of Scilly (Enesek Syllan), and for a time part of western Devonshire (including Dartmoor), still in the hands of the Britons, where they became the Brittonic state of Kernow. The Channel Islands (colonised by Britons in the 5th century) came under attack from Norse and Danish Viking attack in the early 9th century AD, and by the end of that century had been conquered by Viking invaders. The Kingdom of Ce, which encompassed modern Marr, Banff, Buchan, Fife, and much of Aberdeenshire, disappeared soon after 900 AD. Fortriu, the largest Brittonic-Pictish kingdom which covered Strathearn, Morayshire and Easter Ross, had fallen by approximately 950 AD to the Gaelic Kingdom of Alba (Scotland). Other Pictish kingdoms such as Circinn (in modern Angus and The Mearns), Fib (modern Fife), Fidach (Inverness and Perthshire), and Ath-Fotla (Atholl), had also all fallen by the beginning of the 11th century AD or shortly after. The Brythonic languages in these areas were eventually replaced by the Old English of the Anglo-Saxons, and Scottish Gaelic, although this was likely a gradual process in many areas. Similarly, the Brittonic colony of Britonia in northwestern Spain appears to have disappeared soon after 900 AD. The kingdom of Ystrad Clud (Strathclyde) was a large and powerful Brittonic kingdom of the Hen Ogledd (the 'Old North') which endured until the end of the 11th century, successfully resisting Anglo-Saxon, Gaelic Scots and later also Viking attacks. At its peak it encompassed modern Strathclyde, Dumbartonshire, Cumbria, Stirlingshire, Lanarkshire, Ayrshire, Dumfries and Galloway, Argyll and Bute, and parts of North Yorkshire, the western Pennines, and as far as modern Leeds in West Yorkshire.[34][35] Thus the Kingdom of Strathclyde became the last of the Brittonic kingdoms of the 'Old North' to fall in the 1090s when it was effectively divided between England and Scotland.[36] The Britons also retained control of Wales and Kernow (encompassing Cornwall, parts of Devon including Dartmoor, and the Isles of Scilly) until the mid 11th century AD when Cornwall was effectively annexed by the English, with the Isles of Scilly following a few years later, although at times Cornish lords appear to have retained sporadic control into the early part of the 12th century AD. Wales remained free from Anglo-Saxon, Gaelic Scots and Viking control, and was divided among varying Brittonic kingdoms, the foremost being Gwynedd (including Clwyd and Anglesey), Powys, Deheubarth (originally Ceredigion, Seisyllwg and Dyfed), Gwent, and Morgannwg (Glamorgan). These Brittonic-Welsh kingdoms initially included territories further east than the modern borders of Wales; for example, Powys included parts of modern Merseyside, Cheshire and the Wirral and Gwent held parts of modern Herefordshire, Worcestershire, Somerset and Gloucestershire, but had largely been confined to the borders of modern Wales by the beginning of the 12th century. However, by the early 1100s, the Anglo-Saxons and Gaels had become the dominant cultural force in most of the formerly Brittonic ruled territory in Britain, and the language and culture of the native Britons was thereafter gradually replaced in those regions,[37] remaining only in Wales, Cornwall, the Isles of Scilly and Brittany, and for a time in parts of Cumbria, Strathclyde, and eastern Galloway. Cornwall (Kernow, Dumnonia) had certainly been largely absorbed by England by the 1050s to early 1100s, although it retained a distinct Brittonic culture and language.[38] Britonia in Spanish Galicia seems to have disappeared by 900 AD. Wales and Brittany remained independent for a considerable time, however, with Brittany united with France in 1532, and Wales united with England by the Laws in Wales Acts 1535–1542 in the mid 16th century during the rule of the Tudors (Y Tuduriaid), who were themselves of Welsh heritage on the male side. Wales, Cornwall, Brittany and the Isles of Scilly continued to retain a distinct Brittonic culture, identity and language, which they have maintained to the present day. The Welsh and Breton languages remain widely spoken, and the Cornish language, once close to extinction, has experienced a revival since the 20th century. The vast majority of place names and names of geographical features in Wales, Cornwall, the Isles of Scilly and Brittany are Brittonic, and Brittonic family and personal names remain common. During the 19th century, many Welsh farmers migrated to Patagonia in Argentina, forming a community called Y Wladfa, which today consists of over 1,500 Welsh speakers. In addition, a Brittonic legacy remains in England, Scotland and Galicia in Spain,[39] in the form of often large numbers of Brittonic place and geographical names. Examples of geographical Brittonic names survive in the names of rivers, such as the Thames, Clyde, Severn, Tyne, Wye, Exe, Dee, Tamar, Tweed, Avon, Trent, Tambre, Navia, and Forth. Many place names in England and Scotland are of Brittonic rather than Anglo-Saxon or Gaelic origin, such as London, Manchester, Glasgow, Edinburgh, Carlisle, Caithness, Aberdeen, Dundee, Barrow, Exeter, Lincoln, Dumbarton, Brent, Penge, Colchester, Gloucester, Durham, Dover, Kent, Leatherhead, and York. Schiffels et al. (2016) examined the remains of three Iron Age Britons buried ca. 100 BC.[40] A female buried in Linton, Cambridgeshire carried the maternal haplogroup H1e, while two males buried in Hinxton both carried the paternal haplogroup R1b1a2a1a2, and the maternal haplogroups K1a1b1b and H1ag1.[41] Their genetic profile was considered typical for Northwest European populations.[40] Though sharing a common Northwestern European origin, the Iron Age individuals were markedly different from later Anglo-Saxon samples, who were closely related to Danes and Dutch people.[42] Martiano et al. (2016) examined the remains of a female Iron Age Briton buried at Melton between 210 BC and 40 AD.[43] She was found to be carrying the maternal haplogroup U2e1e.[44] The study also examined seven males buried in Driffield Terrace near York between the 2nd century AD and the 4th century AD during the period of Roman Britain.[43] Six of these individuals were identified as native Britons.[45] The six examined native Britons all carried types of the paternal R1b1a2a1a and carried the maternal haplogroups H6a1a, H1bs, J1c3e2, H2, H6a1b2 and J1b1a1.[44] The indigenous Britons of Roman Britain were genetically closely related to the earlier Iron Age female Briton, and displayed close genetic links to modern Celts of the British Isles, particularly Welsh people, suggesting genetic continuity between Iron Age Britain and Roman Britain, and partial genetic continuity between Roman Britain and modern Britain.[46][45] On the other hand, they were genetically substantially different from the examined Anglo-Saxon individual and modern English populations of the area, suggesting that the Anglo-Saxon settlement of Britain left a profound genetic impact.[47]",

Fullerton police and fire personnel responded to reports of an \"unknown plane\" that crashed into the roof of a commercial building shortly after 2 p.m. local time, Fullerton Police Department spokesperson Kristy Wells told USA TODAY. The incident, which remains under investigation, occurred about half a mile from the Fullerton Municipal Airport. 19 people who were working inside the building during the time of the plane crash were injured, authorities confirmed. Eleven people were transported to area hospitals for treatment and eight others were treated and released on scene. The identities of the people killed, both of whom are believed to have been in the aircraft at the time of the crash, will be released by the Orange County Coroner’s Office pending next of kin notifications, police said. After arriving at the scene, police and fire personnel immediately began evacuating the surrounding business area due to an active fire. Local television footage and images showed plumes of smoke rising out of the building. The crash resulted in a 4-alarm fire and a massive response from firefighters and police, who were dispatched to the area, officials told ABC 7. U.S. Rep. Lou Correa, who represents parts of Orange County, said in a statement on X that the plane crashed into a furniture manufacturing building.

The people who died were believed to have been on the plane, while those injured were inside the building. The deceased victims will be identified after officials have contacted the next of kin, the Fullerton Police Department said in a statement. Eleven people were taken to hospitals, while eight were treated and released at the scene, police said. The plane crashed less than two minutes after taking off from the Fullerton Municipal Airport in Orange County, located 6 miles from Disneyland, according to the flight-tracking website FlightAware. Security camera footage from Rucci Forged, a wheel manufacturer across the street, shows the plane was tilted on its side as it dove into the building, causing a fiery explosion and black plume of smoke. Firefighters and police arrived on scene and battled the blaze and evacuated surrounding businesses, Fullerton police spokesperson Kristy Wells said. Chris Villalobos, an airport operations worker, came to the warehouse to see what had happened after receiving a phone call about a plane going down nearby. He noted the airplane's owner was a regular at the airport and has frequently taken off from there. \"He has a hangar here and everything,\" Villalobos said. After taking off, the pilot told air traffic control he was going to turn around to make an emergency landing, but it was unclear what the issue with the plane was, Villalobos said. The building struck by the plane was occupied by Michael Nicholas Designs, a furniture upholstery manufacturer, according to a sign on a door. There appeared to be sewing machines and textile stock inside. The Federal Aviation Administration is investigating the accident and identified the plane as a single-engine, four-seat Van's RV-10. The National Transportation Safety Board said it also is investigating. The airport in Fullerton has one runway and a heliport. Metrolink, a regional train line, is nearby and flanks a residential neighborhood and commercial warehouse buildings. The Fullerton City Council posted a statement on social media calling the crash a \"solemn tragedy.\" \"The City of Fullerton is committed to providing support for all those affected and working with the agencies involved to uncover the details of this incident,\" Mayor Fred Jung said in the statement. \"We are grateful for the strength of our community and the compassion we show one another in times of crisis.\" Another four-seat plane crashed into a tree a half-mile from the airport in November while making an emergency landing shortly after takeoff, The Orange County Register reported. Both people on board suffered moderate injuries. Fullerton is a city of about 140,000 people about 25 miles southeast of Los Angeles. Copyright 2025 NPR",

                "content": "Georgia (Georgian: საქართველო, romanized: sakartvelo, IPA: [sakʰartʰʷelo] ⓘ) is a transcontinental country in Eastern Europe[13][14][15] and West Asia. It is part of the Caucasus region, bounded by the Black Sea to the west, Russia to the north and northeast, Turkey to the southwest, Armenia to the south, and Azerbaijan to the southeast. Georgia covers an area of 69,700 square kilometres (26,900 sq mi).[16] It has a population of 3.7 million,[c][17] of which over a third live in the capital and largest city, Tbilisi. Georgians, who are native to the region, constitute a majority of the country's population and are its titular nation. Georgia has been inhabited since prehistory, hosting the world's earliest known sites of winemaking, gold mining, and textiles.[18][19] The classical era saw the emergence of several kingdoms, such as Colchis and Iberia, that formed the nucleus of the modern Georgian state. In the early fourth century, Georgians officially adopted Christianity, which contributed to their unification under the Kingdom of Georgia. Georgia reached its Golden Age during the High Middle Ages under the reigns of King David IV and Queen Tamar. Beginning in the 15th century, the kingdom declined and disintegrated under pressure from various regional powers, including the Mongols, the Ottoman Empire, and Persia, before being gradually annexed into the Russian Empire starting in 1801. After the Russian Revolution in 1917, Georgia briefly emerged as an independent republic under German protection,[20] but was invaded and annexed by the Red Army in 1921, becoming one of the republics of the Soviet Union. In the 1980s, an independence movement grew quickly, leading to Georgia's secession from the Soviet Union in April 1991. For much of the subsequent decade, the country endured economic crises, political instability, and secessionist wars in Abkhazia and South Ossetia. Following the peaceful Rose Revolution in 2003, Georgia strongly pursued a pro-Western foreign policy, introducing a series of democratic and economic reforms aimed at integration into the European Union and NATO. This Western orientation led to worsening relations with Russia, culminating in the Russo-Georgian War of 2008 and continued Russian occupation of parts of Georgia. Georgia is a representative democracy governed as a unitary parliamentary republic.[21][22] It is a developing country with a very high Human Development Index and an emerging market economy. Sweeping economic reforms since 2003 have resulted in one of the freest business climates in the world, greater economic freedom and transparency, and among the fastest rates of GDP growth.[23] In 2018, Georgia became the second country to legalize cannabis, and the first former socialist state to do so. Georgia is a member of numerous international organizations, including the Council of Europe, Eurocontrol, BSEC, GUAM, Energy Community. As part of the Association Trio, Georgia is a candidate for membership in the European Union.[24] Ancient Greeks (Strabo, Herodotus, Plutarch, Homer, etc.) and Romans (Titus Livius, Tacitus, etc.) referred to early western Georgians as Colchians and eastern Georgians as Iberians (Iberoi, Ἰβηροι in some Greek sources).[25] The first mention of the name Georgia is in Italian on the mappa mundi of Pietro Vesconte dated 1320.[26] At the early stage of its appearance in the Latin world, the name was often spelled Jorgia.[27] Lore-based theories were given by traveller Jacques de Vitry, who explained the name's origin by the popularity of St. George among Georgians,[28] while Jean Chardin thought that Georgia came from the Greek γεωργός ('tiller of the land'). These centuries-old explanations for the word Georgia/Georgians are now mostly rejected by the scholarly community, who point to the Persian word gurğ/gurğān (گرگ, 'wolf'[29]) as the likely root of the word.[30] Under this hypothesis, the same Persian root was later adopted in numerous other languages, including Slavic and West European languages.[30][31] The native name is Sakartvelo (საქართველო; 'land of Kartvelians'), derived from the core central Georgian region of Kartli, recorded from the 9th century, and in extended usage referring to the entire medieval Kingdom of Georgia prior to the 13th century. The Georgian circumfix sa-X-o is a standard geographic construction designating 'the area where X dwell', where X is an ethnonym.[32] The self-designation used by ethnic Georgians is Kartvelebi (ქართველები, i.e. 'Kartvelians'), first attested in the Umm Leisun inscription found in the Old City of Jerusalem. The medieval Georgian Chronicles present an eponymous ancestor of the Kartvelians, Kartlos, a great-grandson of Japheth who medieval chroniclers believed to have been the root of the local name of their kingdom. However, scholars agree that the word Kartli is derived from the Karts, a proto-Kartvelian tribe that emerged as a dominant regional group in ancient times.[30] The name Sakartvelo (საქართველო) consists of two parts. Its root, kartvel-i (ქართველ-ი), specifies an inhabitant of the core central-eastern Georgian region of Kartli, or Iberia as it is known in sources of the Eastern Roman Empire.[33] The official name of the country is Georgia per Article 2 of the Georgian Constitution,[34] adopted in 1995. In Georgia's two official languages (Georgian and Abkhaz), the country is named საქართველო (Sakartvelo) and Қырҭтәыла (Kərttʷʼəla) respectively. Prior to the adoption of the Constitution in 1995 and following the dissolution of the USSR, the country was commonly[citation needed] called the \"Republic of Georgia\" and occasionally it still is.[35] Several languages continue to use the Russian variant of the country's name, Gruzia, which the Georgian authorities have sought to replace through diplomatic campaigns. Since 2006, Israel,[36] Japan,[37] and South Korea[38] legally changed their appellation of the country to variants of the English Georgia.[39] In 2020, Lithuania became the first country in the world to adopt Sakartvelas in all official communications.[40] The oldest traces of archaic humans in what is now Georgia date from approximately 1.8 million years ago in the form of the Dmanisi hominins, a subspecies of Homo erectus representing the oldest-known fossils of hominins in Eurasia.[41] Buffered by the Caucasus and benefiting from the Black Sea ecosystem, the region seems to have served as a refugium throughout the Pleistocene,[42] while the first continuous primitive settlements date back to the Middle Paleolithic, close to 200,000 years ago.[43] During the Upper Paleolithic, settlements developed mostly in Western Georgia, in the valleys of the Rioni and Qvirila rivers.[44] Signs of agriculture date back to at least the 6th millennium BC, especially in Western Georgia, while the Mtkvari basin became stably populated in the 5th millennium BC, as evidenced with the rise of various cultures closely associated with the Fertile Crescent, including the Trialetian Mesolithic, the Shulaveri–Shomu culture, and the Leyla-Tepe culture.[45] Archaeological findings show that settlements in modern-day Georgia were responsible for the first use of fibers, possibly for clothing, more than 34,000 years ago,[46] the first cases of viticulture (7th millennium BC),[47][better source needed] and the first signs of gold mining (3rd millennium BC).[48] The Kura-Araxes, Trialeti, and Colchian cultures coincided with the development of proto-Kartvelian tribes that may have come from Anatolia during the expansion of the Hittite Empire, including the Mushki, Laz, and Byzeres. Some historians have suggested that the collapse of the Hittite world in the Late Bronze Age led to an expansion of the influence of these tribes to the Mediterranean Sea, notably with the Kingdom of Tabal.[49] The classical period saw the rise of a number of Georgian states, including Colchis in western Georgia, where Greek mythology located the Golden Fleece sought after by the Argonauts. Archaeological evidence points to a wealthy kingdom in Colchis as early as the 14th century BC[50] and an extensive trade network with Greek colonies on the eastern Black Sea shore (such as Dioscurias and Phasis),[51] though, the entire region would be annexed first by Pontus and then by the Roman Republic in the first century BC. Eastern Georgia remained a decentralized mosaic of various clans (ruled by individual mamasakhlisi) until the 4th century BC when it was conquered by Alexander the Great, eventually leading to the creation of the Kingdom of Iberia under the protectorate of the Seleucid Empire, an early example of advanced state organization under one king and an aristocratic hierarchy.[52] Various wars with the Roman Empire, Parthia, and Armenia made Iberia regularly change its allegiance, though it remained a Roman client state for most of its history. In 337, King Mirian III adopted Christianity as the state religion of Iberia, beginning the Christianization of the Western Caucasus region and solidly anchoring it in Rome's sphere of influence by abandoning the ancient Georgian polytheistic religion heavily influenced by Zoroastrianism.[53] However, the Peace of Acilisene in 384 formalized the Sasanian control over the entire Caucasus, though Christian rulers of Iberia sought to rebel at times, leading to devastating wars in the 5–6th centuries, most famously under the rule of King Vakhtang Gorgasali who expanded Iberia to its largest historical extent by capturing all of western Georgia and building a new capital in Tbilisi. In 580, the Sasanian Empire abolished the Kingdom of Iberia, leading to the disintegration of its constituent territories into various feudal regions by the early Middle Ages. The Roman–Persian Wars plunged the region into chaos, with both Persia and Constantinople supporting various warring factions in the Caucasus; however, the Byzantine Empire was able to establish control over Georgian territories by the end of the 6th century, ruling Iberia indirectly through a local Kouropalates.[54] In 645, the Arabs invaded southeastern Georgia, starting an extended period of Muslim domination in the region; this also led to the establishment of several feudal states seeking independence from each other, such as the Emirate of Tbilisi and the Principality of Kakheti.[55] Western Georgia remained mostly a Byzantine protectorate, especially following the Lazic War.[56] The lack of a central government in Georgia allowed the rise of the Bagrationi dynasty in the early 9th century. Consolidating lands in the southwestern region of Tao-Klarjeti, Prince Ashot I (813–830) used infighting between Arab governors to expand his influence to Iberia and was recognized as Presiding Prince of Iberia by both the Abbasid Caliphate and the Byzantine Empire. Though Ashot's descendants formed competing princely lines, Adarnase IV managed to unify most Georgian lands (except for Kakheti and Abkhazia) and was crowned King of the Iberians in 888, restoring the monarchy abolished three centuries prior.[57] In Western Georgia, the Kingdom of Abkhazia benefited from the weakening of Byzantium in the region to unify various tribes and become one of the most powerful states of the Caucasus in the 8th century.[58] In the 9th-10th centuries, Abkhazia grew its influence through several military campaigns and came to control much of Iberia and competing with the Bagrationi. Dynastic conflicts eventually weakened Abkhazia in the second half of the 10th century while in Tao-Klarjeti, Prince David III used his influence within Byzantine Anatolia to empower the Bagrationi. Bagrat III, heir of the Bagrationi dynasty, successively became King of Abkhazia (978), Prince of Tao-Klarjeti (1000), and King of the Iberians (1008), allowing him to unify most Georgian feudal states and be crowned in 1010 as King of Georgia. For much of the 11th century, the nascent Georgian kingdom experienced geopolitical and internal difficulties, with various noble factions opposed to the centralization of the Georgian state. They were often backed by the Byzantine Empire, which feared a dominion of the Caucasus region by the Bagrationi dynasty, and in some instances fueled internal conflict through aristocratic families seeking more power. However, ties between Byzantium and Georgia were normalized when the two countries faced a new common enemy, the rising Seljuk Empire in the 1060s. Following the decisive Byzantine defeat at the Battle of Manzikert in 1071, Constantinople started to retreat from eastern Anatolia and entrusted Georgia with its administration, placing Georgia at the forefront of Turkish in the 1080s. The Kingdom of Georgia reached its zenith in the 12th to early 13th centuries. This period during the reigns of David IV (r. 1089–1125) and his great-granddaughter Tamar (r. 1184–1213) has been widely termed as the Georgian Golden Age.[59] This early Georgian renaissance, which preceded its Western European analog, was characterized by impressive military victories, territorial expansion, and a cultural renaissance in architecture, literature, philosophy and the sciences.[60] The Golden Age of Georgia left a legacy of great cathedrals, romantic poetry and literature, and the epic poem The Knight in the Panther's Skin, considered a national epic.[61][62] David IV suppressed dissent of feudal lords and centralized power in his hands to effectively deal with foreign threats. In 1121, he decisively defeated much larger Turkish armies during the Battle of Didgori and abolished the Emirate of Tbilisi.[63] The 29-year reign of Tamar, the first female ruler of Georgia, is considered the most successful in Georgian history.[65] Tamar was given the title \"king of kings\"[64] and succeeded in neutralizing her opposition, while embarking on an energetic foreign policy aided by the downfall of the rival powers of the Seljuks and Byzantium. Supported by a powerful military élite, Tamar was able to build on the successes of her predecessors to consolidate an empire that dominated the Caucasus, and extended over large parts of present-day Azerbaijan, Armenia, eastern Turkey, and northern Iran, and used the vacuum of power left by the Fourth Crusade to create the Empire of Trebizond as a Georgian vassal state.[66] The revival of the Kingdom of Georgia was set back after Tbilisi was captured and destroyed by the Khwarezmian leader Jalal ad-Din in 1226,[67] followed by devastating invasions by Mongol ruler Genghis Khan. The Mongols were expelled by George V the Brilliant (r. 1299–1302), known for reuniting eastern and western Georgia and restoring the country's previous strength and Christian culture. After his death, local rulers fought for their independence from central Georgian rule, until the total disintegration of the kingdom in the 15th century. Georgia was further weakened by several disastrous invasions by Timur. Invasions continued, giving the kingdom no time for restoration, with both Qara Qoyunlu and Aq Qoyunlu Turkomans constantly raiding its southern provinces. The Kingdom of Georgia collapsed into anarchy by 1466 and fragmented into three independent kingdoms and five semi-independent principalities. Neighboring large empires subsequently exploited the internal division of the weakened country, and beginning in the 16th century, various Ottoman and Iranian forces subjugated western and eastern regions of Georgia, respectively.[68] This pushed local Georgian rulers to seek closer ties with Russia. In 1649, the Kingdom of Imereti sent ambassadors to the Russian royal court, with Russia returning the favor in 1651. In the presence of these ambassadors, Alexander III of Imereti swore an oath of allegiance to Tsar Alexis of Russia on behalf of Imereti.[69] Subsequent rulers also sought assistance from Pope Innocent XII but without success.[70] The rulers of regions that remained partly autonomous organized rebellions on various occasions. As a result of incessant Ottoman–Persian Wars and deportations, the population of Georgia dwindled to 784,700 inhabitants at the end of the 18th century.[71] Eastern Georgia, composed of the regions of Kartli and Kakheti, had been under Iranian suzerainty since the Peace of Amasya signed with neighboring rivalling Ottoman Turkey (Safavid Georgia). With the death of Nader Shah in 1747, both kingdoms broke free and were reunified through a personal union under the energetic king Heraclius II, who succeeded in stabilizing Eastern Georgia to a degree.[72] In 1783, Russia and the eastern Georgian Kingdom of Kartli-Kakheti signed the Treaty of Georgievsk, which made eastern Georgia a protectorate of Russia, guaranteed its territorial integrity and the continuation of its reigning Bagrationi dynasty in return for prerogatives in the conduct of Georgian foreign affairs.[73] Despite its commitment to defend Georgia, Russia rendered no assistance when the Iranians invaded in 1795, capturing and sacking Tbilisi and massacring its inhabitants.[74] Although Russia initiated a punitive campaign against Persia in 1796, the Russian Imperial authorities subsequently violated key promises of the Georgievsk Treaty and in 1801 proceeded to annex eastern Georgia, while abolishing the Georgian royal Bagrationi dynasty, as well as the autocephaly of the Georgian Orthodox Church. Pyotr Bagration, one of the descendants of the abolished house of Bagrationi, later joined the Russian army and became a prominent general in the Napoleonic wars.[75] On 22 December 1800, Tsar Paul I of Russia, at the alleged request of the Georgian King George XII, signed the proclamation on the incorporation of Georgia (Kartli-Kakheti) within the Russian Empire, which was finalized by a decree on 8 January 1801,[76][77] and confirmed by Tsar Alexander I on 12 September 1801.[78][79] The Bagrationi royal family was deported from the kingdom. The Georgian envoy in Saint Petersburg reacted with a note of protest that was presented to the Russian vice-chancellor, Prince Kurakin.[80] In May 1801, under the oversight of General Carl Heinrich von Knorring, Imperial Russia transferred power in eastern Georgia to the government headed by General Ivan Petrovich Lazarev.[81] The Georgian nobility did not accept the decree until 12 April 1802, when Knorring assembled the nobility at the Sioni Cathedral and forced them to take an oath on the Imperial Crown of Russia. Those who disagreed were temporarily arrested.[82] In the summer of 1805, Russian troops on the Askerani River near Zagam defeated the Iranian army during the 1804–13 Russo-Persian War and saved Tbilisi from reconquest now that it was officially part of the Imperial territories. Russian suzerainty over eastern Georgia was officially finalized with Iran in 1813 following the Treaty of Gulistan.[83] Following the annexation of eastern Georgia, the western Georgian kingdom of Imereti was annexed by Tsar Alexander I. The last Imeretian king and the last Georgian Bagrationi ruler, Solomon II, died in exile in 1815, after attempts to rally people against Russia and to enlist foreign support against the latter, had been in vain.[84] From 1803 to 1878, as a result of numerous Russian wars now against Ottoman Turkey, several of Georgia's previously lost territories – such as Adjara – were recovered, and also incorporated into the empire. The principality of Guria was abolished and incorporated into the Empire in 1829, while Svaneti was gradually annexed in 1858. Mingrelia, although a Russian protectorate since 1803, was not absorbed until 1867.[85] Russian rule offered the Georgians security from external threats, but it was also often heavy-handed and insensitive. By the late 19th century, discontent with the Russian authorities grew into a national revival movement led by Ilia Chavchavadze. This period also brought social and economic change to Georgia, with new social classes emerging: the emancipation of the serfs freed many peasants but did little to alleviate their poverty; the growth of capitalism created an urban working class in Georgia. Both peasants and workers found expression for their discontent through revolts and strikes, culminating in the Revolution of 1905. Their cause was championed by the socialist Mensheviks, who became the dominant political force in Georgia in the final years of Russian rule. After the Russian Revolution of 1917, the Transcaucasian Democratic Federative Republic was established with Nikolay Chkheidze acting as its president. The federation consisted of three nations: Georgia, Armenia and Azerbaijan.[20] As the Ottomans advanced into the Caucasian territories of the crumbling Russian Empire, Georgia declared independence on 26 May 1918.[86] The Menshevik Social Democratic Party of Georgia won the parliamentary election and its leader, Noe Zhordania, became prime minister. Despite the Soviet takeover, Zhordania was recognized as the legitimate head of the Georgian Government by France, UK, Belgium, and Poland through the 1930s.[87] The 1918 Georgian–Armenian War, which erupted over parts of disputed provinces between Armenia and Georgia populated mostly by Armenians, ended because of British intervention. In 1918–1919, Georgian general Giorgi Mazniashvili led an attack against the White Army led by Moiseev and Denikin to claim the Black Sea coastline from Tuapse to Sochi and Adler for independent Georgia.[88] In 1920 Soviet Russia recognized Georgia's independence with the Treaty of Moscow. But the recognition proved to be of little value, as the Red Army invaded Georgia in 1921 and formally annexed it into the Soviet Union in 1922.[86] In February 1921, during the Russian Civil War, the Red Army advanced into Georgia and brought the local Bolsheviks to power. The Georgian army was defeated, and the Social Democratic government fled the country. On 25 February 1921, the Red Army entered Tbilisi and established a government of workers' and peasants' soviets with Filipp Makharadze as acting head of state. Georgia was incorporated into what would soon become the Soviet Union. Soviet rule was firmly established only after local insurrections were defeated.[89] Georgia would remain an unindustrialized periphery of the USSR until the first five-year plan (1928–1932), when it became a major centre for textile goods. Joseph Stalin, an ethnic Georgian, was prominent among the Bolsheviks,[90] ultimately becoming the de facto leader of the Soviet Union from 1924 until his death on 5 March 1953. Fellow Georgians such as Lavrentiy Beria and Vsevolod Merkulov likewise held powerful positions in the Soviet government. Stalin's Great Purge between 1936 and 1938 led to thousands of Georgian dissidents, intellectuals, and other presumed threats to Soviet authority being executed or sent to Gulag penal labor camps, severely truncating the nation's cultural and intellectual life.[91] During World War II, Germany led an Axis invasion of the Soviet Union in June 1941 with the aim of conquering all territory up to the Ural Mountains. As the initial operation stalled, the Axis launched the Fall Blau offensive in 1942 to take control of strategic Caucasian oil fields and munitions factories; ultimately, Axis troops were stopped before reaching Georgian borders. Over 700,000 Georgians—constituting about 20 percent of the population—fought in the Red Army to repel the invaders and advance towards Berlin; an estimated 350,000 were killed.[92] After Stalin's death, Nikita Khrushchev became the leader of the Soviet Union and implemented a policy of de-Stalinization. Khrushchev's purges were met with riots in Tbilisi that had to be dispersed by military force. This violent turn of events that compromised Georgian loyalty to the Soviet Union, contributing to the nation's consolidation.[93] 1978 Georgian demonstrations saw the return of mass anti-Soviet protests, but this time government backed down. Throughout the remainder of the Soviet period, Georgia's economy continued to grow and experience significant improvement, though it increasingly exhibited blatant corruption and alienation of the government from the people. With the beginning of perestroika in 1986, the Georgian Soviet leadership proved so incapable of handling the changes that most Georgians, including rank and file communists, concluded that the only way forward was a break from the existing Soviet system. Starting in 1988, mass protests erupted in Georgia in favor of independence, led by Georgian nationalists such as Merab Kostava and Zviad Gamsakhurdia. The following year, the brutal suppression by Soviet forces of a large peaceful demonstration held in Tbilisi on 4–9 April 1989 proved to be a pivotal event in discrediting the continuation of Soviet rule over the country.[94] In October 1990, the first multi-party elections were held in Soviet Georgia, which were the first multi-party elections in the entire Soviet Union, in which the opposition groups were registered as formal political parties.[95] The Round Table—Free Georgia coalition led by Zviad Gamsakhurdia secured victory in this election and formed a new government. On 9 April 1991, shortly before the collapse of the Soviet Union, the Supreme Council of Georgia declared independence [ka] after a referendum held on 31 March.[96] Georgia was the first non-Baltic republic of the Soviet Union to officially declare independence,[97] with Romania becoming the first country to recognize Georgia in August 1991.[98] On 26 May, Gamsakhurdia was elected president in the first presidential election with 86.5% of the vote on a turnout of over 83%.[99] Gamsakhurdia was soon deposed in a bloody coup d'état, from 22 December 1991 to 6 January 1992. The coup was instigated by part of the National Guard and a paramilitary organization called \"Mkhedrioni\" (\"horsemen\"). The country then became embroiled in a bitter civil war, which lasted until December 1993. Simmering disputes within two regions of Georgia; Abkhazia and South Ossetia, between local separatists and the majority Georgian populations, erupted into widespread inter-ethnic violence and wars.[100] Supported by Russia, Abkhazia and South Ossetia achieved de facto independence from Georgia, with Georgia retaining control only in small areas of the disputed territories.[100] Eduard Shevardnadze (Soviet Minister of Foreign Affairs from 1985 to 1991) was named as the head of Georgia's new government in March 1992[101] and was elected as head of state in that year's elections, later as president in 1995.[102] During the War in Abkhazia (1992–1993), roughly 230,000 to 250,000 Georgians[103] were expelled from Abkhazia by Abkhaz separatists and North Caucasian militants (including Chechens). Around 23,000 Georgians fled South Ossetia.[104] By 1994, Georgia was facing a severe economic crisis, with bread rations and shortages of electricity, water and heat.[105] In 2003, Shevardnadze (who won re-election in 2000) was deposed by the Rose Revolution, after Georgian opposition and international monitors asserted that 2 November parliamentary elections were marred by fraud.[106] The revolution was led by Mikheil Saakashvili, Zurab Zhvania and Nino Burjanadze, former members and leaders of Shevardnadze's ruling party. Mikheil Saakashvili was elected as President of Georgia in 2004.[107] Following the Rose Revolution, a series of reforms were launched to strengthen the country's military and economic capabilities, as well as to reorient its foreign policy westwards. The new government's efforts to reassert Georgian authority in the southwestern autonomous republic of Adjara led to a major crisis in 2004.[108] The country's newly pro-Western stance, along with accusations of Georgian involvement in the Second Chechen War,[109] resulted in a severe deterioration of relations with Russia, fueled also by Russia's open assistance and support to the two secessionist areas. Despite these increasingly difficult relations, in May 2005 Georgia and Russia reached a bilateral agreement[110] by which Russian military bases (dating back to the Soviet era) in Batumi and Akhalkalaki were withdrawn. Russia withdrew all personnel and equipment from these sites by December 2007[111] while failing to withdraw from the Gudauta base in Abkhazia, which it was required to vacate after the adoption of the Adapted Conventional Armed Forces in Europe Treaty during the 1999 Istanbul summit.[112] There was a Russo-Georgian diplomatic crisis in April 2008.[113][114] A bomb explosion on 1 August 2008 targeted a car transporting Georgian peacekeepers. South Ossetians were responsible for instigating this incident, which marked the opening of hostilities and injured five Georgian servicemen, then several South Ossetian militiamen were killed by snipers.[115][116] South Ossetian separatists began shelling Georgian villages on 1 August. These artillery bombardments caused Georgian servicemen to return fire periodically.[113][116][117][118][119] On 7 August 2008, the Georgian president Mikheil Saakashvili announced a unilateral ceasefire and called for peace talks.[120] More attacks on Georgian villages (located in the South Ossetian conflict zone) were soon matched with gunfire from Georgian troops, who then proceeded to move in the direction of the capital of the self-proclaimed Republic of South Ossetia (Tskhinvali) on the night of 8 August, reaching its centre in the morning of 8 August.[121][122][123] According to Russian military expert Pavel Felgenhauer, the Ossetian provocation was aimed at triggering Georgian retaliation, which was needed as a pretext for a Russian military invasion.[124] According to Georgian intelligence and several Russian media reports, parts of the regular (non-peacekeeping) Russian Army had already moved to South Ossetian territory through the Roki Tunnel before the Georgian military action.[125][126] Russia accused Georgia of \"aggression against South Ossetia\" and began a large land, air and sea invasion of Georgia under the pretext of a \"peace enforcement\" operation on 8 August 2008.[127][118] Abkhaz forces opened a second front on 9 August with the Battle of the Kodori Valley, an attack on the Kodori Gorge, held by Georgia.[128] Tskhinvali was seized by the Russian military by 10 August.[129] Russian forces occupied Georgian cities beyond the disputed territories.[130] During the conflict, there was a campaign of ethnic cleansing against Georgians in South Ossetia, including destruction of Georgian settlements after the war had ended.[131][132] The war displaced 192,000 people and while many were able to return to their homes after the war, a year later around 30,000 ethnic Georgians remained displaced.[133][134] In an interview published in Kommersant, South Ossetian leader Eduard Kokoity said he would not allow Georgians to return.[135][136] The President of France, Nicolas Sarkozy, negotiated a ceasefire agreement on 12 August 2008.[137] Russia recognized Abkhazia and South Ossetia as separate republics on 26 August.[138] The Georgian government severed diplomatic relations with Russia.[139] Russian forces left the buffer areas bordering Abkhazia and South Ossetia on 8 October and the European Union Monitoring Mission in Georgia was dispatched to the buffer areas.[140][141] Since the war, Georgia has maintained that Abkhazia and South Ossetia are occupied Georgian territories.[142][143] In preparation for the 2012 parliamentary elections, Georgia implemented constitutional reforms to switch to a parliamentary democracy, moving executive powers from the President to the Prime Minister.[144] The transition was set to start with the October 2012 parliamentary elections and to be completed with the 2013 presidential elections. Against the expectations of the ruling United National Movement (UNM) of president Mikheil Saakashvili, a 6-party coalition centred around the newly founded Georgian Dream party won the parliamentary elections in October 2012, bringing an end to nine years of UNM rule and marking the first peaceful electoral transfer of power in Georgia. President Saakashvili acknowledged the defeat of his party on the following day.[145] Georgian Dream was founded, led and financed by tycoon Bidzina Ivanishvili, the country's richest man, who was subsequently elected by parliament as new Prime Minister.[146] Due to the incomplete transition to parliamentary democracy, a year of uneasy cohabitation between Ivanishvili and Saakashvili followed until the presidential election in October 2013,[147][148] which was won by Giorgi Margvelashvili from the Georgian Dream party.[149] With the completed transfer of power, Prime Minister Ivanishvili stepped aside and named one of his close business associates, Irakli Garibashvili, as the next prime minister.[150] Ivanishvili has since been called the informal leader of Georgia, arranging political reappointments from behind the scenes.[151] Saakashvili left Georgia shortly after the election. In 2018, he was convicted in absentia on corruption charges and abuse of power, which he denied.[152] Georgian Dream won the parliamentary elections with 48.61% of the vote while UNM received 27.04%.[153] As result of the mixed proportional-majoritarian voting system, this translated into a parliamentary supermajority of 115 out of 150 seats (77%). This electoral imbalance became a key issue of political and civil society strife in the following years.[154][155][156] In the 2018 presidential election, the Georgian Dream party backed Salome Zurabishvili, who won in the second round, becoming the first woman in Georgia to hold the office in full capacity.[157] This was the last direct election of a Georgian president, as additional constitutional reforms removed the popular vote.[158] After international mediation to overcome the deep political crisis in the run-up to the 2020 parliamentary elections, an amended electoral system was adopted, specifically for the 2020 elections.[159] Nine parties were elected to parliament. Georgian Dream secured over 48% of votes, which translated into 90 out of 150 seats. They were thus able to continue to govern alone. The opposition made accusations of fraud, which Georgian Dream denied. Thousands of people gathered outside the Central Election Commission to demand a new vote.[160] This led to a new political crisis that was (temporarily) resolved by an EU brokered agreement,[161] from which the Georgian Dream later withdrew.[162] In February 2021, Prime Minister Giorgi Gakharia resigned and Irakli Garibashvili became Prime Minister once more.[163] During the Russian invasion of Ukraine in 2022, Georgian provided diplomatic and humanitarian support for Ukraine but did not join other countries in imposing sanctions on Russia. Since the beginning of war Georgia has topped the list of countries to which Russian exiles moved; Russians have been allowed to stay in Georgia for at least one year without a visa since 2015, though many Georgians began to view the presence of more Russian citizens in Georgia as a security risk.[164][165] On 7 March 2023, the Parliament of Georgia, led by the Georgian Dream coalition, attempted to pass the Law on Transparency of Foreign Influence which requires Non-Governmental Organizations (NGOs) to register as \"agents of foreign influence\", if upwards of 20% of their funding is from foreign support.[166] The passing of the bill resulted in severe protests and criticism from the US State Department, United Nations and European Union, leading to the termination of further discussions of the bill.[167] On 3 April 2024, the Georgian Parliament announced the draft of a similar law named the Proposed Law on Transparency of Foreign Influence,[168] leading to larger protests, the bill has been described as \"the Russian law\" by the opposition and protestors, in reference to the Russian foreign agent law.[169] At least 200,000 people have joined the protests against the law, which they describe as \"Kremlin-style\", and a threat to democracy and free speech.[170][171] Following the announcement of the results of the 2024 Georgian parliamentary election, protests erupted in Georgia on 28 October, with the protestors citing alleged violations of electoral law, such as voter fraud. The High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy called on the Central Election Commission of Georgia (CEC) to \"swiftly, transparently and independently investigate and adjudicate electoral irregularities and allegations thereof\".[172] The Georgian opposition parties and the President of Georgia Zurabishvili have stated their support for the protestors alleging the violation of the law by the Georgian Dream government.[173] Protests have gotten more intense since 28 November following the postponing of Georgia's integration into the European Union until 2028.[174] The protestors started using pyrotechnics and molotov cocktails.[175] The use of water cannon and tear gas by the police led to injuries described as torture by Georgia's rights ombudsman.[176] On 2 December, opposition leader Zurab Japaridze was arrested, and on 4 December another opposition leader, Nika Gvaramia, was arrested. Both opposition leaders have been set free since then.[177][178] Georgia is a mountainous country situated almost entirely in the South Caucasus, while some slivers of the country are situated north of the Caucasus Watershed in the North Caucasus.[179][180] The country lies between latitudes 41° and 44° N, and longitudes 40° and 47° E, with an area of 67,900 km2 (26,216 sq mi). The Likhi Range divides the country into eastern and western halves.[181] Historically, the western portion of Georgia was known as Colchis while the eastern plateau was called Iberia.[182] The Greater Caucasus Mountain Range forms the northern border of Georgia.[181] The main roads through the mountain range into Russian territory lead through the Roki Tunnel between Shida Kartli and North Ossetia and the Darial Gorge (in the Georgian region of Khevi). The southern portion of the country is bounded by the Lesser Caucasus Mountains.[181] The Greater Caucasus Mountain Range is much higher in elevation than the Lesser Caucasus Mountains, with the highest peaks rising more than 5,000 metres (16,404 ft) above sea level. The highest mountain in Georgia is Mount Shkhara at 5,203 metres (17,070 ft), and the second highest is Mount Janga at 5,059 m (16,598 ft) above sea level. Other prominent peaks include Mount Kazbek at 5,047 m (16,558 ft), Shota Rustaveli Peak 4,960 m (16,273 ft), Tetnuldi 4,858 m (15,938 ft), Ushba 4,700 m (15,420 ft), and Ailama 4,547 m (14,918 ft).[181] Out of the abovementioned peaks, only Kazbek is of volcanic origin. The region between Kazbek and Shkhara (a distance of about 200 km (124 mi) along the Main Caucasus Range) is dominated by numerous glaciers.[182] The term Lesser Caucasus Mountains is often used to describe the mountainous (highland) areas of southern Georgia that are connected to the Greater Caucasus Mountain Range by the Likhi Range.[181] The overall region can be characterized as being made up of various, interconnected mountain ranges (largely of volcanic origin) and plateaus that do not exceed 3,400 metres (11,155 ft) in elevation. Prominent features of the area include the Javakheti Volcanic Plateau, lakes, including Tabatskuri and Paravani, as well as mineral water and hot springs. Two major rivers in Georgia are the Rioni and the Mtkvari.[182] The landscape within the nation's boundaries is quite varied. Western Georgia's landscape ranges from low-land marsh-forests, swamps, and temperate rainforests to eternal snows and glaciers, while the eastern part of the country even contains a small segment of semi-arid plains.[182] Much of the natural habitat in the low-lying areas of western Georgia has disappeared during the past 100 years because of agricultural development and urbanization. A large majority of the forests that covered the Colchis plain are now virtually non-existent with the exception of the regions that are included in the national parks and reserves (e.g. Lake Paliastomi area). At present, the forest cover generally remains outside of the low-lying areas and is mainly located along the foothills and the mountains. Western Georgia's forests consist mainly of deciduous trees below 600 metres (1,969 ft) above sea level and contain species such as oak, hornbeam, beech, elm, ash, and chestnut. Evergreen species such as box may also be found in many areas. About 1,000 of the 4,000 higher plants of Georgia are endemic.[183] The west-central slopes of the Meskheti Range in Ajaria as well as several locations in Samegrelo and Abkhazia are covered by temperate rain forests. Between 600–1,000 metres (1,969–3,281 ft) above sea level, the deciduous forest becomes mixed with both broad-leaf and coniferous species making up the plant life. The zone is made up mainly of beech, spruce, and fir forests. From 1,500–1,800 metres (4,921–5,906 ft), the forest becomes largely coniferous. The tree line generally ends at around 1,800 metres (5,906 ft) and the alpine zone takes over, which in most areas, extends up to an elevation of 3,000 metres (9,843 ft) above sea level.[182] Eastern Georgia's landscape (referring to the territory east of the Likhi Range) is considerably different from that of the west, although, much like the Colchis plain in the west, nearly all of the low-lying areas of eastern Georgia including the Mtkvari and Alazani River plains have been deforested for agricultural purposes.[citation needed] The general landscape of eastern Georgia comprises numerous valleys and gorges that are separated by mountains. In contrast with western Georgia, nearly 85 per cent of the forests of the region are deciduous. Coniferous forests only dominate in the Borjomi Gorge and in the extreme western areas. Out of the deciduous species of trees, beech, oak, and hornbeam dominate. Other deciduous species include several varieties of maple, aspen, ash, and hazelnut.[182] At higher elevations above 1,000 metres (3,281 ft) above sea level (particularly in the Tusheti, Khevsureti, and Khevi regions), pine and birch forests dominate. In general, the forests in eastern Georgia occur between 500–2,000 metres (1,640–6,562 ft) above sea level, with the alpine zone extending from 2,000–2,300 to 3,000–3,500 meters (6,562–7,546 to 9,843–11,483 ft). The only remaining large, low-land forests remain in the Alazani Valley of Kakheti.[182] The climate of Georgia is extremely diverse, considering the nation's small size. There are two main climatic zones, roughly corresponding to the eastern and western parts of the country. The Greater Caucasus Mountain Range plays an important role in moderating Georgia's climate and protects the nation from the penetration of colder air masses from the north. The Lesser Caucasus Mountains partially protect the region from the influence of dry and hot air masses from the south.[184] Much of western Georgia lies within the northern periphery of the humid subtropical zone with annual precipitation ranging from 1,000–2,500 mm (39–98 in), reaching a maximum during the Autumn months. The climate of the region varies significantly with elevation and while much of the lowland areas of western Georgia are relatively warm throughout the year, the foothills and mountainous areas (including both the Greater and Lesser Caucasus Mountains) experience cool, wet summers and snowy winters (snow cover often exceeds 2 metres or 6 feet 7 inches in many regions).[184] Eastern Georgia has a transitional climate from humid subtropical to continental. The region's weather patterns are influenced both by dry Caspian air masses from the east and humid Black Sea air masses from the west. The penetration of humid air masses from the Black Sea is often blocked by mountain ranges (Likhi and Meskheti) that separate the eastern and western parts of the nation.[182] The wettest periods generally occur during spring and autumn, while winter and summer months tend to be the driest. Much of eastern Georgia experiences hot summers (especially in the low-lying areas) and relatively cold winters. As in the western parts of the nation, elevation plays an important role in eastern Georgia where climatic conditions above 1,500 metres (4,921 ft) are considerably colder than in the low-lying areas.[182] Because of its high landscape diversity and low latitude, Georgia is home to about 5,601 species of animals, including 648 species of vertebrates (more than 1% of the species found worldwide) and many of these species are endemics.[185] A number of large carnivores live in the forests, namely Brown bears, wolves, lynxes and Caucasian Leopards. The common pheasant (also known as the Colchian Pheasant) is an endemic bird of Georgia which has been widely introduced throughout the rest of the world as an important game bird. The species number of invertebrates is considered to be very high but data is distributed across a high number of publications. The spider checklist of Georgia, for example, includes 501 species.[186] The Rioni River may contain a breeding population of the critically endangered bastard sturgeon.[187] Slightly more than 6,500 species of fungi, including lichen-forming species, have been recorded from Georgia,[188][189] but this number is far from complete. The true total number of fungal species occurring in Georgia, including species not yet recorded, is likely to be far higher, given the generally accepted estimate that only about seven per cent of all fungi worldwide have so far been discovered.[190] Although the amount of available information is still very small, a first effort has been made to estimate the number of fungal species endemic to Georgia, and 2,595 species have been tentatively identified as possible endemics of the country.[191] 1,729 species of plants have been recorded from Georgia in association with fungi.[189] According to the International Union for Conservation of Nature, there are 4,300 species of vascular plants in Georgia.[192] Georgia is home to four ecoregions: Caucasus mixed forests, Euxine-Colchic deciduous forests, Eastern Anatolian montane steppe, and Azerbaijan shrub desert and steppe.[193] It had a 2018 Forest Landscape Integrity Index mean score of 7.79/10, ranking it 31st globally out of 172 countries.[194] Georgia is a representative democratic parliamentary republic; the President serves as the largely ceremonial head of state,[195] whereas the Prime Minister is head of government. Executive power is vested in the Cabinet of Georgia, composed of ministers headed by the Prime Minister and appointed by the Parliament. Salome Zurabishvili is the current President of Georgia after winning 59.52% of the vote in the 2018 Georgian presidential election. Since February 2024, Irakli Kobakhidze has been the prime minister of Georgia. Legislative authority is vested in the Parliament of Georgia. It is unicameral and has 150 members, known as deputies, of whom 30 are elected by plurality to represent single-member districts, and 120 are chosen to represent parties by proportional representation. Members of parliament are elected for four-year terms. Different opinions exist regarding the degree of political freedom in Georgia. Saakashvili believed in 2008 that the country is \"on the road to becoming a European democracy.\"[196] In their 2022 report[update] Freedom House lists Georgia as \"partly free\", recognizing a trajectory of democratic improvement surrounding the 2012–13 transfer of power, yet observing a gradual backslide in later years.[197] In the 2023 Democracy Index, the Economist Intelligence Unit classifies Georgia as a \"hybrid regime\", which denotes an incomplete democratic transition from authoritarianism to democracy characterized by elements of both systems.[198] The explicit western orientation of Georgia, deepening political ties with the US and European Union, notably through its EU and NATO membership aspirations, the US Train and Equip military assistance programme, and the construction of the Baku–Tbilisi–Ceyhan pipeline, increasingly strained Tbilisi's relations with Moscow in the early 2000s. Georgia's decision to boost its presence in the coalition forces in Iraq was an important initiative.[199] The European Union has identified Georgia as a prospective member,[200] and Georgia has sought membership.[201] Georgia is currently working to become a full member of NATO. In August 2004, the Individual Partnership Action Plan of Georgia was submitted officially to NATO. On 29 October 2004, the North Atlantic Council of NATO approved the Individual Partnership Action Plan (IPAP) of Georgia, and Georgia moved on to the second stage of Euro-Atlantic Integration. In 2005, the agreement on the appointment of Partnership for Peace (PfP) liaison officer between Georgia and NATO came into force, whereby a liaison officer for the South Caucasus was assigned to Georgia. On 2 March 2005, the agreement was signed on the provision of the host nation support to and transit of NATO forces and NATO personnel. On 6–9 March 2006, the IPAP implementation interim assessment team arrived in Tbilisi. On 13 April 2006, the discussion of the assessment report on implementation of the Individual Partnership Action Plan was held at NATO Headquarters, within 26+1 format.[202] In 2009 the Georgia-NATO Interparliamentary Council was created within the NATO Parliamentary Assembly to hold twice yearly meetings to discuss all aspects of Georgia-NATO cooperation. In 2017, a poll by the National Democratic Institute, an American NGO, revealed that the majority of Georgians and politicians in Georgia support the push for NATO membership.[203] In 2011, the North Atlantic Council designated Georgia as an \"aspirant country\".[204] Since 2014, Georgia–NATO relations are guided by the Substantial NATO–Georgia Package (SNGP), which includes the NATO–Georgia Joint Training and Evaluation Centre and facilitation of multi-national and regional military drills.[205] In September 2019, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said that \"NATO approaching our borders is a threat to Russia.\"[206] He was quoted as saying that if NATO accepts Georgian membership with the article on collective defence covering only Tbilisi-administered territory—i.e., excluding the Georgian territories Abkhazia and South Ossetia, both of which are currently Russian-supported unrecognized breakaway republics—\"we will not start a war, but such conduct will undermine our relations with NATO and with countries who are eager to enter the alliance.\"[207] George W. Bush became the first sitting U.S. president to visit the country.[208] The street leading to Tbilisi International Airport has since been dubbed George W. Bush Avenue.[209] On 2 October 2006, Georgia and the European Union signed a joint statement on the agreed text of the Georgia–European Union Action Plan within the European Neighbourhood Policy (ENP). The Action Plan was formally approved at the EU–Georgia Cooperation Council session on 14 November 2006, in Brussels.[210] In June 2014, the EU and Georgia signed an Association Agreement, which entered into force on 1 July 2016.[211] On 13 December 2016, EU and Georgia reached the agreement on visa liberalization for Georgian citizens.[212] On 27 February 2017, the Council adopted a regulation on visa liberalization for Georgians travelling to the EU for a period of stay of 90 days in any 180-day period.[213] Georgia applied for EU membership on 3 March 2022, soon after the beginning of the Russian invasion of Ukraine.[214] In December 2023, Georgia was granted EU Candidate status by the European Council.[215][216][217][218] In November 2024, Prime Minister Irakli Kobakhidze declared the country's EU accession process would be paused until 2028, leading to protests.[219] Georgia's military is organized into land and air forces collectively known as the Georgian Defense Forces (GDF); naval forces were merged into the Coast Guard in 2009, which falls under the Internal Affairs Minister. More than 20% of the GDF consists of conscripts.[220] The mission and functions of the GDF are based on the Constitution of Georgia, Georgia's Law on Defense and National Military Strategy, and international agreements to which Georgia is signatory.[citation needed] As of 2021, Georgia's military budget was 900₾ ($280) million, of which newly two-thirds is allocated for maintaining defence forces readiness and potency development.[221] After its independence from the Soviet Union, Georgia began to develop its own military industry, namely through the state owned STC Delta.[222] The country produces a range of indigenous military equipment, including armored vehicles, artillery systems, aviation systems, personal protection equipment, and small arms.[223] Georgian military personnel have served in several international operations. During later periods of the Iraq War, Georgia had up to 2,000 soldiers serving in the American-led Multi-National Force.[224] Georgia also participated in the NATO-led International Security Assistance Force in Afghanistan; with 1,560 troops in 2013, it was at that time the largest contributor among non-NATO countries[225] and in per capita terms.[226][227] Over 11,000 Georgian soldiers rotated through Afghanistan during the course of the war;[228] 32 were killed,[229] mostly during the Helmand campaign, and 435 were wounded, including 35 amputees.[230][231] The Ministry of Internal Affairs of Georgia is charged with internal law enforcement. In recent years, the Patrol Police Department of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of Georgia has undergone a radical transformation, with the police having now absorbed a great many duties previously performed by dedicated independent government agencies. New duties performed by the police include border security and customs functions and contracted security provision; the latter function is performed by the dedicated 'security police'.[citation needed] In 2005, President Mikheil Saakashvili fired the entire traffic police force (numbering around 30,000 police officers) of the Georgian National Police due to corruption.[232][233] A new force was then subsequently built around new recruits.[232] The U.S. State Department's Bureau of International Narcotics and Law-Enforcement Affairs has provided assistance to the training efforts and continues to act in an advisory capacity.[234] The new Patruli force was first introduced in the summer of 2005 to replace the traffic police, a force which was accused of widespread corruption.[235] The police introduced a 0–2–2 (currently, 1–1–2) emergency dispatch service in 2004.[236] Prior to the Rose Revolution, Georgia was among the most corrupt countries in the world.[237] However, following the reforms brought by the peaceful revolution, corruption in the country abated dramatically. In 2010, Transparency International (TI) named Georgia \"the best corruption-buster in the world.\"[238] In 2012, the World Bank called Georgia a \"unique success\" of the world in fighting corruption, noting \"Georgia's experience shows that the vicious cycle of endemic corruption can be broken and, with appropriate and decisive reforms, can be turned into a virtuous cycle.\"[239] Although Georgia has been very successful in reducing blatant forms of corruption, other more subtle corrupt practices have been noted. For example, in its 2017 report, Council of Europe observed that while most day-to-day corruption has been eliminated, there are some indications of a \"clientelistic system\" whereby the country's leadership may allocate resources in ways that generate the loyalty and support it needs to stay in power.[240] Since 2012 stagnation in corruption fighting efforts can be observed, according to Transparency International.[241] Since 2016 the Transparency International Corruption Perception Index hovers around 56 out of 100 points. In comparison, that places Georgia in the top 50 out of 180 countries, among Central European and Mediterranean EU member states.[242] Human rights in Georgia are guaranteed by the country's constitution. There is an independent human rights public defender elected by the Parliament of Georgia to ensure such rights are enforced.[243] Georgia has ratified the Framework Convention for the Protection of National Minorities in 2005. NGO \"Tolerance\", in its alternative report about its implementation, speaks of a rapid decrease in the number of Azerbaijani schools and cases of appointing headmasters to Azerbaijani schools who do not speak the Azerbaijani language.[244] The government came under criticism for its alleged use of excessive force on 26 May 2011 when it dispersed protesters led by Nino Burjanadze, among others, with tear gas and rubber bullets after they refused to clear Rustaveli Avenue for an independence day parade despite the expiration of their demonstration permit and despite being offered to choose an alternative venue.[245][246][247][248] While human rights activists maintained that the protests were peaceful, the government pointed out that many protesters were masked and armed with heavy sticks and Molotov cocktails.[249] Georgian opposition leader Nino Burjanadze said the accusations of planning a coup were baseless, and that the protesters' actions were legitimate.[248][250] Since independence, Georgia maintained harsh policies against drugs, handing out lengthy sentences even for marijuana use. This came under criticism from human rights activists[251] and led to protests.[252] In response to lawsuits from civil society organizations, in 2018 the Constitutional Court of Georgia ruled that \"consumption of marijuana is an action protected by the right to free personality\"[253] and that \"[Marijuana] can only harm the user's health, making that user him/herself responsible for the outcome. The responsibility for such actions does not cause dangerous consequences for the public.\"[254] With this ruling, Georgia became one of the first countries in the world to legalize cannabis, although using the drug in the presence of children is still illegal and punishable by fines or imprisonment.[255] Georgian prisons tend to be overcrowded with poor living conditions.[256][257] LGBT individuals in Georgia frequently face harassment and violence.[258] Minor protections exist against discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation or gender identity. Since 2008 transgender people are allowed to change their gender marker following sex reassignment surgery. However, a bill passed in 2024 seeks to remove many protections from LGBT people.[259][260][261] The European Union, and various human rights organizations have condemned the legislation.[259][262][263] In 2024, Georgian President Salome Zourabichvili condemned the high-profile murder of a Georgian trans woman and subsequently attended her funeral to pay respects.[264][265] Georgia is administratively divided into 9 regions, 1 capital region, and 2 autonomous republics. These in turn are subdivided into 67 districts and 5 self-governing cities.[266] Georgia contains two official autonomous regions, of which one has declared independence. Officially autonomous within Georgia,[267] the de facto independent region of Abkhazia declared independence in 1999.[268] In addition, another territory not officially autonomous has also declared independence. South Ossetia is officially known by Georgia as the Tskinvali region, as it views \"South Ossetia\" as implying political bonds with Russian North Ossetia.[269] It was called South Ossetian Autonomous Oblast when Georgia was part of Soviet Union. Its autonomous status was revoked in 1990. De facto separate since Georgian independence, offers were made to give South Ossetia autonomy again, but in 2006 an unrecognized referendum in the area resulted in a vote for independence.[269] In both Abkhazia and South Ossetia large numbers of people had been given Russian passports, some through a process of forced passportization by Russian authorities.[270] This was used as a justification for Russian invasion of Georgia during the 2008 South Ossetia war after which Russia recognized the region's independence.[271] Georgia considers the regions as occupied by Russia.[142][272] The two self-declared republics gained limited international recognition after the 2008 Russo-Georgian War. Most countries consider the regions to be Georgian territory under Russian occupation.[273] Archaeological research demonstrates that Georgia has been involved in commerce with many lands and empires since ancient times, largely due its location on the Black Sea and later on the historical Silk Road. Gold, silver, copper and iron have been mined in the Caucasus Mountains. Georgian wine making is a very old tradition and a key branch of the country's economy. The country has sizeable hydropower resources.[274] Throughout Georgia's modern history agriculture and tourism have been principal economic sectors, because of the country's climate and topography. For much of the 20th century, Georgia's economy was within the Soviet model of command economy. Since the fall of the USSR in 1991, Georgia embarked on a major structural reform designed to transition to a free market economy. As with all other post-Soviet states, Georgia faced a severe economic collapse. The civil war and military conflicts in South Ossetia and Abkhazia aggravated the crisis. The agriculture and industry output diminished. By 1994 the gross domestic product had shrunk to a quarter of that of 1989.[275] Since the early 21st century visible positive developments have been observed in the economy of Georgia. In 2007, Georgia's real GDP growth rate reached 12 per cent, making Georgia one of the fastest-growing economies in Eastern Europe. Georgia has become more integrated into the global trading network: its 2015 imports and exports account for 50% and 21% of GDP respectively.[276] Georgia's main imports are vehicles, ores, fossil fuels and pharmaceuticals. Main exports are ores, ferro-alloys, vehicles, wines, mineral waters and fertilizers.[277][278] The World Bank dubbed Georgia \"the number one economic reformer in the world\" because it has in one year improved from rank 112th to 18th in terms of ease of doing business,[279] and by 2020 further improved its position to 6th in the world.[280] As of 2021, it ranked 12th in the world for economic freedom. In 2019, Georgia ranked 61st on the Human Development Index (HDI). Between 2000 and 2019, Georgia's HDI score improved by 17.7%.[281] Of factors contributing to HDI, education had the most positive influence[282] as Georgia ranks in the top quintile in terms of education. Georgia is developing into an international transport corridor through Batumi and Poti ports, Baku–Tbilisi–Kars Railway line, an oil pipeline from Baku through Tbilisi to Ceyhan, the Baku–Tbilisi–Ceyhan pipeline (BTC) and a parallel gas pipeline, the South Caucasus Pipeline.[283] Since coming to power the Saakashvili administration accomplished a series of reforms aimed at improving tax collection. Among other things a flat income tax was introduced in 2004.[284] As a result, budget revenues have increased fourfold and a once large budget deficit has turned into a surplus.[285][286] As of 2001, 54 per cent of the population lived below the national poverty line but by 2006 poverty decreased to 34 per cent and by 2015 to 10.1 per cent.[287] In 2015, the average monthly income of a household was 1,022.3₾ (about $426).[288] 2015 calculations place Georgia's nominal GDP at US$13.98 billion.[289] Georgia's economy is becoming more devoted to services (as of 2016[update], representing 59.4 per cent of GDP), moving away from the agricultural sector (6.1 per cent).[290] Since 2014, unemployment has been gradually decreasing each year but remained in double digits and worsened during the COVID-19 pandemic.[291] A perception of economic stagnation led to a 2019 survey of 1,500 residents finding unemployment was considered a significant problem by 73% of respondents, with 49% reporting their income had decreased over the prior year.[292] Georgia's telecommunications infrastructure is ranked the last among its bordering neighbors in the World Economic Forum's Network Readiness Index (NRI) – an indicator for determining the development level of a country's information and communication technologies. Georgia ranked number 58 overall in the 2016 NRI ranking,[293] up from 60 in 2015.[294] Georgia was ranked 57th in the Global Innovation Index in 2024.[295] Tourism is an increasingly significant part of the Georgian economy. In 2016, over 2.7 million tourists brought approximately US$2.16 billion to the country.[296] In 2019, the number of international arrivals reached a record high of 9.3 million people.[297] with foreign exchange income in the year's first three-quarters amounting to over US$3 billion. The country plans to host 11 million visitors by 2025 with annual revenues reaching US$6.6 billion.[298] According to the government, there are 103 resorts in different climatic zones in Georgia. Tourist attractions include more than 2,000 mineral springs, over 12,000 historical and cultural monuments, four of which are recognized as UNESCO World Heritage Sites (Bagrati Cathedral in Kutaisi and Gelati Monastery, historical monuments of Mtskheta, and Upper Svaneti).[299] Other tourist attractions are Cave City, Ananuri Castle/Church, Sighnaghi and Mount Kazbek. In 2018, more than 1.4 million tourists from Russia visited Georgia.[300] Today, transport in Georgia is provided by rail, road, ferry, and air. The total length of roads in Georgia, excluding the occupied territories, is 21,110 kilometres (13,120 mi) and railways – 1,576 km (979 mi).[301] Positioned in the Caucasus and on the coast of the Black Sea, Georgia is a key country through which energy imports to the European Union from neighboring Azerbaijan pass.[citation needed] In recent years, Georgia has invested large amounts of money in the modernization of its transport networks. The construction of new highways has been prioritized and, as such, major cities like Tbilisi have seen the quality of their roads improve dramatically; despite this, however, the quality of inter-city routes remains poor and to date only one motorway-standard road has been constructed – the ს 1 (S1), the main east–west highway through the country. The Georgian railways represent an important transport artery for the Caucasus, as they make up the largest proportion of a route linking the Black and Caspian Seas. In turn, this has allowed them to benefit in recent years from increased energy exports from neighbouring Azerbaijan to the European Union, Ukraine, and Turkey.[302] Passenger services are operated by the state-owned Georgian Railway while freight operations are carried out by a number of licensed operators. Since 2004, the Georgian Railways have been undergoing a rolling programme of fleet-renewal and managerial restructuring which is aimed at making the service provided more efficient and comfortable for passengers.[303] Infrastructural development has also been high on the agenda for the railways, with the key Tbilisi railway junction expected to undergo major reorganization in the near future.[304] Additional projects also include the construction of the economically important Kars–Tbilisi–Baku railway, which was opened on 30 October 2017 and connects much of the Caucasus with Turkey by standard gauge railway.[305][306] Air and maritime transport is developing in Georgia, with the former mainly used by passengers and the latter for transport of freight. Georgia currently has four international airports, the largest of which is by far Tbilisi International Airport, hub for Georgian Airways, which offers connections to many large European cities. Other airports in the country are largely underdeveloped or lack scheduled traffic, although, as of late, efforts have been made to solve both these problems.[307] There are a number of seaports along Georgia's Black Sea coast, the largest and most busy of which is the Port of Batumi; while the town is itself a seaside resort, the port is a major cargo terminal in the Caucasus and is often used by neighbouring Azerbaijan as a transit point for making energy deliveries to Europe. Scheduled and chartered passenger ferry services link Georgia with Bulgaria,[308] Romania, Turkey and Ukraine.[309] Like most native Caucasian peoples, the Georgians do not fit into any of the main ethnic categories of Europe or Asia. The Georgian language, the most pervasive of the Kartvelian languages, is not Indo-European, Turkic, or Semitic. The present-day Georgian or Kartvelian nation is thought to have resulted from the fusion of indigenous inhabitants with various immigrants who moved into South Caucasus from Anatolia in remote antiquity.[311] The population of Georgia totaled 3,688,647 as of 2022,[312][d] a decrease from 3,713,804 in the previous census in October 2014.[313][d] The population declined by 40,000 in 2021, a reversal of the trend towards stabilization of the last decade and, for the first time since independence, the population was recorded to be below 3.7 million. According to the 2014 census, Ethnic Georgians form about 86.8 percent of the population, while the remainder includes ethnic groups such as Abkhazians, Armenians, Assyrians, Azerbaijanis, Greeks, Jews, Kists, Ossetians, Russians, Ukrainians, Yezidis and others.[313][d] The Georgian Jews are one of the oldest Jewish communities in the world. According to the 1926 census there were 27,728 Jews in Georgia.[314][e] Georgia was also once home to significant ethnic German communities, numbering 11,394 according to the 1926 census.[314][f] Most of them were deported during World War II.[317] The 2014 census, carried out in collaboration with the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA), found a population gap of approximately 700,000 compared to the 2014 data from the National Statistical Office of Georgia, Geostat, which was cumulatively built on the 2002 census. Consecutive research estimated the 2002 census to be inflated by 8 to 9 percent,[318] which affected the annually updated population estimates in subsequent years. One explanation put forward by UNFPA is that families of emigrants continued to list them in 2002 as residents for fear of losing certain rights or benefits. Also, the population registration system from birth to death was non-functional. It was not until around 2010 that parts of the system became reliable again. With the support of the UNFPA, the demographic data for the period 1994–2014 has been retro-projected.[319] On the basis of that back-projection, Geostat has corrected its data for these years. The 1989 census recorded 341,000 ethnic Russians, or 6.3 percent of the population,[320] 52,000 Ukrainians and 100,000 Greeks in Georgia.[321] The population of Georgia, including the breakaway regions, has declined by more than 1 million due to net emigration in the period 1990–2010.[322][321] Other factors in the population decline include birth-death deficits for the period 1995–2010 and the exclusion of Abkhazia and South Ossetia from the statistics. Russia received by far the most migrants from Georgia. According to United Nations data, this totaled 625,000 by 2000, declining to 450,000 by 2019.[323] Initially, the out-migration was driven by non-Georgian ethnicities, but increasing numbers of Georgians emigrated as well,[324] due to the war, the crisis-ridden 1990s, and the subsequent bad economic outlook. The 2010 Russian census recorded about 158,000 ethnic Georgians living in Russia,[325] with approximately 40,000 living in Moscow by 2014.[326] There were 184 thousand immigrants in Georgia in 2014 with most of them hailing from Russia (51.6%), Greece (8.3%), Ukraine (8.11%), Germany (4.3%), and Armenia (3.8%).[327][d] In the early 1990s, following the dissolution of the Soviet Union, violent separatist conflicts broke out in the autonomous region of Abkhazia and Tskhinvali Region. Many Ossetians living in Georgia left the country, mainly to Russia's North Ossetia.[328] On the other hand, at least 160,000 Georgians left Abkhazia after the breakout of hostilities in 1993.[329] Of the Meskhetian Turks who were forcibly relocated in 1944, only a tiny fraction returned to Georgia as of 2008[update].[330] In the 2024 Global Hunger Index, Georgia is one of 22 countries with a GHI score of less than 5. Differences between their scores are minimal. With a score under 5, Georgia has a level of hunger that is low.[331] The most widespread language group is the Kartvelian family, which includes Georgian, Svan, Mingrelian and Laz.[332][333][334][335][336][337] The official language of Georgia is Georgian, with Abkhaz having official status within the autonomous region of Abkhazia. Georgian is the primary language of 87.7 per cent of the population, followed by 6.2 per cent speaking Azerbaijani, 3.9 per cent Armenian, 1.2 per cent Russian, and 1 per cent other languages.[338][d] Azerbaijani once served as a lingua franca for communication among various nationalities inhabiting Eastern Caucasus.[316] Main religions (2014)[3][d] Today, 83.4 percent of the population practices Eastern Orthodox Christianity, with the majority of these adhering to the national Georgian Orthodox Church.[339][d] The Georgian Orthodox Church is one of the world's oldest Christian churches, and claims apostolic foundation by Saint Andrew.[340] In the first half of the 4th century, Christianity was adopted as the state religion of Iberia (present-day eastern Georgia), following the missionary work of Saint Nino of Cappadocia.[341][342] The Church gained autocephaly during the early Middle Ages; it was abolished during the Russian domination of the country, restored in 1917 and fully recognized by the Ecumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople in 1989.[343] The special status of the Georgian Orthodox Church is officially recognized in the Constitution of Georgia and the Concordat of 2002, although religious institutions are separate from the state.[citation needed] Religious minorities of Georgia include Muslims (10.7 percent), Armenian Christians (2.9 percent) and Roman Catholics (0.5 percent).[339][d] 0.7 percent of those recorded in the 2014 census declared themselves to be adherents of other religions, 1.2 percent refused or did not state their religion and 0.5 percent declared no religion at all.[339] Islam is represented by both Azerbaijani Shia Muslims (in the south-east), ethnic Georgian Sunni Muslims in Adjara, Chechen sub-ethnic group of Sunni Kists in the Pankisi Gorge, and Laz-speaking Sunni Muslims as well as Sunni Meskhetian Turks along the border with Turkey. In Abkhazia, a minority of the Abkhaz population is also Sunni Muslim. There are also smaller communities of Greek Muslims (of Pontic Greek origin) and Armenian Muslims, both of whom are descended from Ottoman-era converts to Turkish Islam from Eastern Anatolia who settled in Georgia following the Lala Mustafa Pasha's Caucasian campaign that led to the Ottoman conquest of the country in 1578. Georgian Jews trace the history of their community to the 6th century BC[344] but due to immigration to Israel, by early 2000s their numbers had dwindled to several thousand.[345][346] Despite the long history of religious harmony in Georgia,[347] there have been instances of religious discrimination and violence against \"nontraditional faiths\", such as Jehovah's Witnesses, by followers of the defrocked Orthodox priest Basil Mkalavishvili.[348] In addition to traditional religious organizations, Georgia retains secular and irreligious segments of society (0.5 percent),[349] as well as a significant portion of religiously affiliated individuals who do not actively practice their faith.[350] The education system of Georgia has undergone sweeping, though controversial, modernization since 2004.[351][352] Education in Georgia is mandatory for all children aged 6–14.[353] The school system is divided into elementary (six years; ages 6–12), basic (three years; ages 12–15), and secondary (three years; ages 15–18), or alternatively vocational studies (two years). Access to higher education is given to students who have gained a secondary school certificate. Only those students who have passed the Unified National Examinations may enroll in a state-accredited higher education institution, based on ranking of the scores received at the exams.[354] Most of these institutions offer three levels of study: a bachelor's programme (three to four years); a master's programme (two years), and a doctoral programme (three years). There is also a certified specialist's programme that represents a single-level higher education programme lasting from three to six years.[353][355] As of 2016[update], 75 higher education institutions are accredited by the Ministry of Education and Science of Georgia.[356] Gross primary enrolment ratio was 117 percent for the period of 2012–2014, the 2nd highest in Europe after Sweden.[357] Tbilisi has become the main artery of the Georgian educational system, particularly since the creation of the First Georgian Republic in 1918 permitted the establishment of modern, Georgian-language educational institutions. Tbilisi is home to several major institutions of higher education in Georgia, notably the Tbilisi State Medical University, which was founded as Tbilisi Medical Institute in 1918, and the Tbilisi State University (TSU), which was established in 1918 and remains the oldest university in the entire Caucasus region.[358] The number of faculty and staff (collaborators) at TSU is approximately 5,000, with over 35,000 students enrolled. The following four universities are also located in Tbilisi: Georgian Technical University,[359] which is Georgia's main and largest technical university, The University of Georgia (Tbilisi),[360] as well as Caucasus University[361] and Free University of Tbilisi.[362] Georgian culture evolved over thousands of years from its foundations in the Iberian and Colchian civilizations.[363] Georgian culture enjoyed a renaissance and golden age of classical literature, arts, philosophy, architecture and science in the 11th century.[364] Georgian culture was influenced by Classical Greece, the Roman Empire, the Byzantine Empire, the various Iranian empires (notably the Achaemenid, Parthian, Sassanian, Safavid, and Qajar empires),[365][366][367][368] and later, since the 19th century, by the Russian Empire and the Soviet Union.[369] This long history has provided a national narrative which encompasses the successful preservation of unique culture and identity in a consistent territory, despite external pressures. Christianity and the Georgian language are particularly important national identifiers.[370] These cultural, religious, and later political attributes are associated with a European and Western identity, based on a national perception of these attributes that contrasts with surrounding powers.[369][370][371][372] This self-identity is stronger among the dominant ethnic Georgian population than in the country's minority groups.[372] Georgia is known for its folklore, traditional music, dances, theatre, cinema, and art. Notable painters from the 20th century include Niko Pirosmani, Lado Gudiashvili, Elene Akhvlediani; notable ballet choreographers include George Balanchine, Vakhtang Chabukiani, and Nino Ananiashvili; notable poets include Galaktion Tabidze, Lado Asatiani, and Mukhran Machavariani; and notable theatre and film directors include Robert Sturua, Tengiz Abuladze, Giorgi Danelia, and Otar Ioseliani.[373] Georgian architecture has been influenced by many civilizations. There are several architectural styles for castles, towers, fortifications and churches. The Upper Svaneti fortifications, and the castle town of Shatili in Khevsureti, are some of the finest examples of medieval Georgian castle architecture. Other architectural features of Georgia include Rustaveli Avenue in Tbilisi and the Old Town District.[citation needed] Georgian ecclesiastic art is one of the most notable aspects of Georgian Christian architecture, which combines the classical dome style with the original basilica style, forming what is known as the Georgian cross-dome style. Cross-dome architecture developed in Georgia during the 9th century; before that, most Georgian churches were basilicas. Other examples of Georgian ecclesiastic architecture can be found outside Georgia: Bachkovo Monastery in Bulgaria (built in 1083 by the Georgian military commander Grigorii Bakuriani), Iviron monastery in Greece (built by Georgians in the 10th century), and the Monastery of the Cross in Jerusalem (built by Georgians in the 9th century). One of the most famous late 19th/early 20th century Georgian artists was primitivist painter Niko Pirosmani.[374] The Georgian language, and the Classical Georgian literature of the poet Shota Rustaveli, were revived in the 19th century after a long period of turmoil, laying the foundations of the romantics and novelists of the modern era such as Grigol Orbeliani, Nikoloz Baratashvili, Ilia Chavchavadze, Akaki Tsereteli, and Vazha-Pshavela.[373] The Georgian language is written in three unique scripts which, according to traditional accounts, were invented by King Pharnavaz I of Iberia in the 3rd century BC.[375][376] Television, magazines, and newspapers in Georgia are all operated by both state-owned and for-profit corporations which depend on advertising, subscription, and other sales-related revenues. The Constitution of Georgia guarantees freedom of speech.[citation needed] The media environment of Georgia remains the freest and most diverse in the South Caucasus,[377] despite the long-term politicization and polarisation affecting the sector. The political struggle for control over the public broadcaster has left it without a direction in 2014 too.[378] Georgia has an ancient musical tradition, which is primarily known for its early development of polyphony. Georgian polyphony is based on three vocal parts, a unique tuning system based on perfect fifths, and a harmonic structure rich in parallel fifths and dissonances.[citation needed] Three types of polyphony have developed in Georgia: a complex version in Svaneti, a dialogue over a bass background in the Kakheti region, and a three-part partially improvised version in western Georgia.[379] The Georgian folk song \"Chakrulo\" was one of 27 musical compositions included on the Voyager Golden Records that were sent into space on Voyager 2 on 20 August 1977.[380] Georgian cuisine and wine have evolved through the centuries, adapting traditions in each era. One of the most unusual traditions of dining is supra, or Georgian table, which is also a way of socializing with friends and family. The head of supra is known as tamada. He also conducts the highly philosophical toasts, and makes sure that everyone is enjoying themselves. Various historical regions of Georgia are known for their particular dishes: for example, khinkali (meat dumplings), from eastern mountainous Georgia, and khachapuri, mainly from Imereti, Samegrelo and Adjara.[381] Georgia is one of the oldest wine-producing countries in the world. Archaeology indicates that fertile valleys and slopes in and around Georgia have been home to grapevine cultivation and neolithic wine production (Georgian: ღვინო, ɣvino) for millennia.[382][383][384][385] Local traditions associated with wine are entwined with its national identity.[382] In 2013, UNESCO added the ancient traditional Georgian winemaking method using the Kvevri clay jars to the UNESCO Intangible Cultural Heritage Lists.[382][386] Georgia's moderate climate and moist air, influenced by the Black Sea, provide the best conditions for vine cultivation. The soil in vineyards is so intensively cultivated that the grapevines grow up the trunks of fruit trees, eventually hanging down along the fruit when they ripen. This method of cultivation is called maglari.[387] Among the best-known Georgian wine regions are Kakheti (further divided into the micro-regions of Telavi and Kvareli), Kartli, Imereti, Racha-Lechkhumi and Kvemo Svaneti, Adjara and Abkhazia. Georgian wine has been a contentious issue in recent relationships with Russia. Political tensions with Russia have contributed to the 2006 Russian embargo of Georgian wine, Russia claimed Georgia produced counterfeit wine. It was an \"official\" reason, but the instability of economic relations with Russia is well known, as they use the economic ties for political purposes.[388] Counterfeiting problems stem from mislabelling by foreign producers and falsified \"Georgian Wine\" labels on wines produced outside of Georgia and imported into Russia under the auspices of being Georgian produced.[388] The shipment of counterfeit wine has been primarily channelled through Russian managed customs checkpoints in Russian-occupied Georgian territories Abkhazia and South Ossetia, where no inspection and regulation occurs.[388] The most popular sports in Georgia are football, basketball, rugby union, wrestling, judo, and weightlifting. Rugby is considered Georgia's national sport.[389] Historically, Georgia has been famous for its physical education; the Romans were fascinated with Georgians' physical qualities after seeing the training techniques of ancient Iberia.[390] Wrestling remains a historically important sport of Georgia, and some historians think that the Greco-Roman style of wrestling incorporates many Georgian elements.[391] Within Georgia, one of the most popularized styles of wrestling is the Kakhetian style. There were a number of other styles in the past that are not as widely used today. For example, the Khevsureti region of Georgia has three styles of wrestling. Other popular sports in 19th century Georgia were polo, and Lelo, a traditional Georgian game very similar to rugby.[392] The first and only race circuit in the Caucasian region is located in Georgia. Rustavi International Motorpark originally built in 1978, was re-opened in 2012 after total reconstruction[393] costing $20 million. The track satisfies the FIA Grade 2 requirements and currently hosts the Legends car racing series and Formula Alfa competitions.[394] Basketball was always one of the notable sports in Georgia, and Georgia had a few very famous Soviet Union national team members, such as Otar Korkia, Mikheil Korkia, Zurab Sakandelidze and Levan Moseshvili. Dinamo Tbilisi won the prestigious EuroLeague competition in 1962. Georgia has had five players in the NBA: Vladimir Stepania, Jake Tsakalidis, Nikoloz Tskitishvili, Tornike Shengelia and former Golden State Warriors centre Zaza Pachulia. Other notable basketball players include the two time EuroLeague champion Giorgi Shermadini and EuroLeague players Manuchar Markoishvili and Viktor Sanikidze. The sport is regaining its popularity in the country recently, and the Georgia national basketball team has qualified for the EuroBasket tournament five consecutive times since its first appearance in 2011.[citation needed] There are a number of world-class Georgian MMA fighters. Ilia Topuria, Merab Dvalishvili, Giga Chikadze and Roman Dolidze are highly ranked fighters currently signed with the UFC. Georgian athletes have won a total of 40 Olympic medals, mostly in wrestling, judo and weightlifting.[395] Competitive bodybuilding sanctioned by the European IFBB is also popular in the country.[396] 42°00′N 43°30′E﻿ / ﻿42.000°N 43.500°E﻿ / 42.000; 43.500",

                "content": "Georgia is a state in the Southeastern region of the United States. It borders Tennessee and North Carolina to the north, South Carolina and the Atlantic Ocean to the east, Florida to the south, and Alabama to the west. Of the 50 United States, Georgia is the 24th-largest by area and eighth most populous. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, its 2024 estimated population was 11,180,878.[6] Atlanta, a global city, is both the state's capital and its largest city. The Atlanta metropolitan area, with a population of more than 6.3 million people in 2023, is the sixth most populous metropolitan area in the United States and contains about 57% of Georgia's entire population. Other major metropolitan areas in the state include Augusta, Savannah, Columbus, and Macon.[7] The Province of Georgia was established in 1732, with its first settlement occurring in 1733 when Savannah was founded. By 1752, Georgia had transitioned into a British royal colony, making it the last and southernmost of the original Thirteen Colonies.[8] Named in honor of King George II of Great Britain, the Georgia Colony extended from South Carolina down to Spanish Florida and westward to French Louisiana along the Mississippi River. On January 2, 1788, Georgia became the fourth state to ratify the United States Constitution.[9] Between 1802 and 1804, a portion of western Georgia was carved out to create the Mississippi Territory, which eventually became the U.S. states of Alabama and Mississippi. Georgia declared its secession from the Union on January 19, 1861, joining the ranks of the original seven Confederate States. After the Civil War, it was the last state to be readmitted to the Union on July 15, 1870.[9] In the late 19th century, during the post-Reconstruction period, Georgia's economy underwent significant changes, driven by a coalition of influential politicians, business leaders, and journalists, notably Henry W. Grady, who promoted the \"New South\" ideology focused on reconciliation and industrialization.[10] In the mid-20th century, several notable figures from Georgia, including Martin Luther King Jr., emerged as key leaders in the civil rights movement.[9] Atlanta was chosen to host the 1996 Summer Olympics, celebrating the centennial of the modern Olympic Games. Since 1945, Georgia has experienced significant population and economic expansion, aligning with the larger Sun Belt trend. Between 2007 and 2008, 14 of Georgia's counties were listed among the 100 fastest-growing in the United States.[11] Georgia is defined by a diversity of landscapes, flora, and fauna. The northern part of the state features the Blue Ridge Mountains, which are part of the broader Appalachian Mountain range. Moving south, the Piedmont plateau stretches from the foothills of the Blue Ridge to the Fall Line, an escarpment that marks the transition to the Coastal Plain in the southern region of the state. The highest elevation in the state is Brasstown Bald, reaching 4,784 feet (1,458 m) above sea level, while the lowest point is at the Atlantic Ocean. Except for some elevated areas in the Blue Ridge, Georgia predominantly experiences a humid subtropical climate. Among the states located entirely east of the Mississippi River, Georgia ranks as the largest in terms of land area.[12] Before settlement by European colonists, Georgia was inhabited by the mound building cultures. The Province of Georgia was founded by British General James Oglethorpe at Savannah on February 12, 1733, a year after its creation as a new British colony.[13] It was administered by the Trustees for the Establishment of the Colony of Georgia in America under a charter issued by (and named for) King George II. The Trustees implemented an elaborate plan for the colony's settlement, known as the Oglethorpe Plan, which envisioned an agrarian society of yeoman farmers and prohibited slavery. The colony was invaded by the Spanish in 1742, during the War of Jenkins' Ear. In 1752, after the government failed to renew subsidies that had helped support the colony, the Trustees turned over control to the crown. Georgia became a crown colony, with a governor appointed by the king of Great Britain.[14] The Province of Georgia was one of the Thirteen Colonies that revolted against British rule in the American Revolution by signing the 1776 Declaration of Independence. The State of Georgia's first constitution was ratified in February 1777. Georgia was the 10th state to ratify the Articles of Confederation on July 24, 1778,[15] and was the 4th state to ratify the United States Constitution on January 2, 1788.[16] After the Creek War (1813–1814), General Andrew Jackson forced the Muscogee (Creek) tribes to surrender land to the state of Georgia, including in the Treaty of Fort Jackson (1814), surrendering 21 million acres in what is now southern Georgia and central Alabama, and the Treaty of Indian Springs (1825).[17] In 1829, gold was discovered in the North Georgia mountains leading to the Georgia Gold Rush and establishment of a federal mint in Dahlonega, which continued in operation until 1861. The resulting influx of American settlers put pressure on the federal U.S. government to take land from the Cherokee Nation. In 1830, President Andrew Jackson signed into law the Indian Removal Act, sending many eastern Indian nations to reservations in present-day Oklahoma, including all of Georgia's tribes. Despite the Supreme Court's ruling in Worcester v. Georgia (1832) that U.S. states were not permitted to redraw Indian boundaries, President Jackson and the state of Georgia ignored the ruling. In 1838, his successor, Martin Van Buren, dispatched federal troops to gather the tribes and deport them west of the Mississippi. This forced relocation, known as the Trail of Tears, led to the death of more than four thousand Cherokees. In early 1861, Georgia joined the Confederacy (with secessionists having a slight majority of delegates)[18] and became a major theater of the Civil War. Major battles took place at Chickamauga, Kennesaw Mountain, and Atlanta. In December 1864, a large swath of the state from Atlanta to Savannah was destroyed during General William Tecumseh Sherman's March to the Sea. 18,253 Georgian soldiers died in service, roughly one of every five who served.[19] In 1870, following the Reconstruction era, Georgia became the last Confederate state to be restored to the Union. With white Democrats having regained power in the state legislature, they passed a poll tax in 1877, which disenfranchised many poor black (and some white) people, preventing them from registering.[20] In 1908, the state established a white primary; with the only competitive contests within the Democratic Party, it was another way to exclude black people from politics.[21] They constituted 46.7% of the state's population in 1900, but the proportion of Georgia's population that was African American dropped thereafter to 28%, primarily due to tens of thousands leaving the state during the Great Migration.[22] According to the Equal Justice Initiative's 2015 report on lynching in the United States (1877–1950), Georgia had 531 deaths, the second-highest total of these extralegal executions of any state in the South. The overwhelming number of victims were black and male.[23] Political disfranchisement persisted through the mid-1960s, until after Congress passed the Voting Rights Act of 1965. An Atlanta-born Baptist minister who was part of the educated middle class that had developed in Atlanta's African-American community, Martin Luther King Jr., emerged as a national leader in the civil rights movement. King joined with others to form the Southern Christian Leadership Conference (SCLC) in Atlanta in 1957 to provide political leadership for the Civil Rights Movement across the South. The civil rights riots of the 1956 Sugar Bowl would also take place in Atlanta after a clash between Georgia Tech's president Blake R. Van Leer and Governor Marvin Griffin.[24] On February 5, 1958, during a training mission flown by a B-47, a Mark 15 nuclear bomb, also known as the Tybee Bomb, was lost off the coast of Tybee Island near Savannah. The bomb was thought by the Department of Energy to lie buried in silt at the bottom of Wassaw Sound.[25] By the 1960s, the proportion of African Americans in Georgia had declined to 28% of the state's population, after waves of migration to the North and some immigration by whites.[22] With their voting power diminished, it took some years for African Americans to win a state-wide office. Julian Bond, a noted civil rights leader, was elected to the state House in 1965, and served multiple terms there and in the state senate. Atlanta Mayor Ivan Allen Jr. testified before Congress in support of the Civil Rights Act, and Governor Carl Sanders worked with the Kennedy administration to ensure the state's compliance. Ralph McGill, editor and syndicated columnist at the Atlanta Constitution, earned admiration by writing in support of the Civil Rights Movement. In 1970, newly elected Governor Jimmy Carter declared in his inaugural address that the era of racial segregation had ended. In 1972, Georgians elected Andrew Young to Congress as the first African American Congressman since the Reconstruction era. In 1980, construction was completed on an expansion of what is now named Hartsfield–Jackson Atlanta International Airport (ATL). The busiest and most efficient airport in the world, it accommodates more than a hundred million passengers annually.[26] Employing more than 60,000 people, the airport became a major engine for economic growth.[26] With the advantages of cheap real estate, low taxes, right-to-work laws and a regulatory environment limiting government interference, the Atlanta metropolitan area became a national center of finance, insurance, technology, manufacturing, real estate, logistics, and transportation companies, as well as the film, convention, and trade show businesses. As a testament to the city's growing international profile, in 1990 the International Olympic Committee selected Atlanta as the site of the 1996 Summer Olympics. Taking advantage of Atlanta's status as a transportation hub, in 1991 UPS established its headquarters in the suburb of Sandy Springs. In 1992, construction finished on Bank of America Plaza, the tallest building in the U.S. outside of New York or Chicago. On February 19, 2003, Georgia adopted its current state flag, resembling the state's first official flag. In 2024, it was announced that Atlanta would host multiple games during the 2026 FIFA World Cup, which further substantiated the economic investment and growth in the city and state. Beginning from the Atlantic Ocean, the state's eastern border with South Carolina runs up the Savannah River, northwest to its origin at the confluence of the Tugaloo and Seneca Rivers. It then continues up the Tugaloo (originally Tugalo) and into the Chattooga River, its most significant tributary. These bounds were decided in the 1797 Treaty of Beaufort, and tested in the U.S. Supreme Court in the two Georgia v. South Carolina cases in 1923 and 1989.[citation needed] The border then takes a sharp turn around the tip of Rabun County, at latitude 35°N, though from this point it diverges slightly south (due to inaccuracies in the original survey, conducted in 1818).[27] This northern border was originally the Georgia and North Carolina border all the way to the Mississippi River, until Tennessee was divided from North Carolina, and the Yazoo companies induced the legislature of Georgia to pass an act, approved by the governor in 1795, to sell the greater part of Georgia's territory presently comprising Alabama and Mississippi.[28] The state's western border runs in a straight line south-southeastward from a point southwest of Chattanooga, to meet the Chattahoochee River near West Point. It continues downriver to the point where it joins the Flint River (the confluence of the two forming Florida's Apalachicola River); the southern border goes almost due east and very slightly south, in a straight line to the St. Mary's River, which then forms the remainder of the boundary back to the ocean.[citation needed] The water boundaries are still set to be the original thalweg of the rivers. Since then, several have been inundated by lakes created by dams, including the Apalachicola/Chattahoochee/Flint point now under Lake Seminole.[citation needed] An 1818 survey erroneously placed Georgia's border with Tennessee one mile (1.6 km) south of the intended location of the 35th parallel north.[27] State legislators still dispute this placement, as correction of this inaccuracy would allow Georgia access to water from the Tennessee River.[29] Georgia consists of five principal physiographic regions: The Cumberland Plateau, Ridge-and-Valley Appalachians, Blue Ridge Mountains, Piedmont, and the Atlantic coastal plain.[30] Each region has its own distinctive characteristics. For instance, the region, which lies in the northwest corner of the state, includes limestone, sandstone, shale, and other sedimentary rocks, which have yielded construction-grade limestone, barite, ocher, and small amounts of coal. The state of Georgia has approximately 250 tree species and 58 protected plants. Georgia's native trees include red cedar, a variety of pines, oaks, hollies, cypress, sweetgum, scaly-bark and white hickories, and sabal palmetto. East Georgia is in the subtropical coniferous forest biome and conifer species as other broadleaf evergreen flora make up the majority of the southern and coastal regions. Yellow jasmine and mountain laurel make up just a few of the flowering shrubs in the state. White-tailed deer are found in nearly all counties of Georgia. The northern mockingbird and brown thrasher are among the 160 bird species that live in the state. Reptiles include the eastern diamondback, copperhead, and cottonmouth snakes as well as alligators; amphibians include salamanders, frogs and toads. There are about 79 species of reptile and 63 amphibians known to live in Georgia. The Argentine black and white tegu is currently an invasive species in Georgia. It poses a problem to local wildlife by chasing down and killing many native species and dominating habitats.[31] The most popular freshwater game fish are trout, bream, bass, and catfish, all but the last of which are produced in state hatcheries for restocking. Popular saltwater game fish include red drum, spotted seatrout, flounder, and tarpon. Porpoises, whales, shrimp, oysters, and blue crabs are found inshore and offshore of the Georgia coast. The majority of the state is primarily a humid subtropical climate. Hot and humid summers are typical, except at the highest elevations. The entire state, including the North Georgia mountains, receives moderate to heavy precipitation, which varies from 45 inches (1,100 mm) in central Georgia[32] to approximately 75 inches (1,900 mm) around the northeast part of the state.[33] The degree to which the weather of a certain region of Georgia is subtropical depends on the latitude, its proximity to the Atlantic Ocean or Gulf of Mexico, and the elevation. The latter factor is felt chiefly in the mountainous areas of the northern part of the state, which are farther away from the ocean and can be 4,500 feet (1,400 m) above sea level. The USDA plant hardiness zones for Georgia range from zone 6b (no colder than −5 °F (−21 °C)) in the Blue Ridge Mountains to zone 8b (no colder than 15 °F (−9 °C) ) along the Atlantic coast and Florida border.[34] The highest temperature ever recorded is 112 °F (44 °C) in Louisville on July 24, 1952,[35] while the lowest is −17 °F (−27 °C) in northern Floyd County on January 27, 1940.[36] Georgia is one of the leading states in frequency of tornadoes, though they are rarely stronger than EF1. Although tornadoes striking the city are very rare,[37] an EF2 tornado[37] hit downtown Atlanta on March 14, 2008, causing moderate to severe damage to various buildings. With a coastline on the Atlantic Ocean, Georgia is also vulnerable to hurricanes, although direct hurricane strikes were rare during the 20th century. Georgia often is affected by hurricanes that strike the Florida Panhandle, weaken over land, and bring strong tropical storm winds and heavy rain to the interior, a recent example being Hurricane Michael,[38] as well as hurricanes that come close to the Georgia coastline, brushing the coast on their way north without ever making landfall. Hurricane Matthew of 2016 and Hurricane Dorian of 2019 did just that. Due to anthropogenic climate change, the climate of Georgia is warming. This is already causing major disruption, for example, from sea level rise (Georgia is more vulnerable to it than many other states because its land is sinking) and further warming will increase it.[40][41][42][43] Atlanta, located in north-central Georgia at the Eastern Continental Divide, has been Georgia's capital city since 1868. It is the most populous city in Georgia, with a 2020 U.S. census population of just over 498,000.[44] The state has seventeen cities with populations over 50,000, based on official 2020 U.S. census data.[44] Along with the rest of the Southeast, Georgia's population continues to grow rapidly, with primary gains concentrated in urban areas. The U.S. Census Bureau lists fourteen metropolitan areas in the state. The population of the Atlanta metropolitan area added 1.23 million people (24%) between 2000 and 2010, and Atlanta rose in rank from the eleventh-largest metropolitan area in the United States to the ninth-largest.[45] The Atlanta metropolitan area is the cultural and economic center of the Southeast; its official population in 2020 was over 6 million, or 57% of Georgia's total population.[46] The United States Census Bureau reported Georgia's official population to be 10,711,908 as of the 2020 United States census. This was an increase of 1,024,255, or 10.57% over the 2010 figure of 9,687,653 residents.[50] The state made up 3.14% of the total US population in 2010 and 3.23% in 2020. As of 2010[update], the number of illegal immigrants living in Georgia more than doubled to 480,000 from January 2000 to January 2009, according to a federal report. That gave Georgia the greatest percentage increase among the 10 states with the biggest undocumented immigrant populations during those years.[51] Georgia has banned sanctuary cities.[52] In 2018, The top countries of origin for Georgia's immigrants were Mexico, India, Jamaica, Korea, and Guatemala.[53] There were 743,000 veterans in 2009.[54] According to HUD's 2022 Annual Homeless Assessment Report, there were an estimated 10,689 homeless people in Georgia.[55][56] In the 1980 census, 1,584,303 people from Georgia claimed English ancestry out of a total state population of 3,994,817, making them 40% of the state, and the largest ethnic group at the time.[62] Today, many of these same people claim they are of \"American\" ancestry, as do many of Scots-Irish descent; however, their families have lived in the state for so long, in many cases since the colonial period, that they choose to identify simply as having \"American\" ancestry or do not in fact know their own ancestry.[63][64][65][66] Historically, about half of Georgia's population was composed of African Americans who, before the American Civil War, were almost exclusively enslaved. The Great Migration of hundreds of thousands of blacks from the rural South to the industrial North from 1914 to 1970 reduced the African American population.[67] However, the proportion of Georgia's population that is Black has increased since 1990 and today the state is third in percent of the total population that is African American (after Mississippi and Louisiana) and third in numeric Black population after New York and Florida. Georgia had the second-fastest-growing Asian population growth in the U.S. from 1990 to 2000, more than doubling in size during the ten-year period.[68] Indian people and Chinese people are the largest Asian groups in Georgia.[69] Georgia also has a sizeable Latino population. Many are of Mexican descent.[70] Georgia is the state with the third-lowest percentage of older people (65 or older), at 12.8 percent (as of 2015[update]).[71] As of 2011[update], 58.8% of Georgia's population younger than 1 were minorities (meaning they had at least one parent who was not non-Hispanic white) compared to other states like California with 75.1%, Texas with 69.8%, and New York with 55.6%.[72] The colonial settlement of large numbers of Scottish American, English American and Scotch-Irish Americans in the mountains and Piedmont, and coastal settlement by some English Americans and African Americans, have strongly influenced the state's culture in food, language and music. The concentration of African slaves repeatedly \"imported\" to coastal areas in the 18th century from rice-growing regions of West Africa led to the development of Gullah-Geechee language and culture in the Low Country among African Americans. They share a unique heritage in which many African traditions of food, religion and culture were retained. In the creolization of Southern culture, their foodways became an integral part of Low Country cooking.[73][74] Sephardic Jews, French-speaking Swiss people, Moravians, Irish convicts, Piedmont Italians and Russian people immigrated to the state during the colonial era.[75] The largest European ancestry groups as of 2011 were: English 8.1%, Irish 8.1%,[76] and German 7.2%.[77] As of 2021[update], 85.62% (8,711,102) of Georgia residents age 5 and older spoke English at home as a primary language, while 7.82% (795,646) spoke Spanish, and 6.55% (666,849) spoke languages other than English or Spanish at home, with the most common of which were Vietnamese, Chinese, and Korean. In total, 14.38% (1,462,495) of Georgia's population age 5 and older spoke a mother language other than English.[78] According to the Pew Research Center, the composition of religious affiliation in Georgia was 67% Protestant, 9% Catholic, 1% Mormon, 1% Jewish, 0.5% Muslim, 0.5% Buddhist, and 0.5% Hindu. Atheists, deists, agnostics, and other unaffiliated people make up 18% of the population.[80] Overall, Christianity was the dominant religion in the state, as part of the Bible Belt. According to the Association of Religion Data Archives in 2010, the largest Christian denominations by number of adherents were the Southern Baptist Convention with 1,759,317; the United Methodist Church with 619,394; and the Roman Catholic Church with 596,384. Non-denominational Evangelical Protestant had 566,782 members, the Church of God (Cleveland, Tennessee) has 175,184 members, and the National Baptist Convention, USA, Inc. has 172,982 members.[81] The Presbyterian Church (USA) is the largest Presbyterian body in the state, with 300 congregations and 100,000 members. The other large body, Presbyterian Church in America, had at its founding date 14 congregations and 2,800 members; in 2010 it counted 139 congregations and 32,000 members.[81][82] The Roman Catholic Church is noteworthy in Georgia's urban areas, and includes the Archdiocese of Atlanta and the Diocese of Savannah. Georgia is home to the second-largest Hindu temple in the United States, the BAPS Shri Swaminarayan Mandir Atlanta, located in the Atlanta suburb Lilburn. The state also has a minority Sikh population and 4 gurudwaras. Georgia is home to several historic synagogues including The Temple (Atlanta), Congregation Beth Jacob (Atlanta), and Congregation Mickve Israel (Savannah). Chabad and the Rohr Jewish Learning Institute are also active in the state.[83][84] By the 2022 Public Religion Research Institute's study, 71% of the population were Christian; throughout its Christian population, 60% were Protestant and 8% were Catholic. Jehovah's Witnesses and Mormons collectively made up 3% of other Christians according to the study.[85] Judaism, Islam, Buddhism, and Hinduism collectively formed 4% of the state's non-Christian population; New Age spirituality was 2% of the religious population. Approximately 23% of the state was irreligious.[85] Tribes which historically lived in what is now Georgia include the Muscogee (including the Hitchiti subgroup), the Cherokee, the Oconi, the Guale, the Yamasee and the Apalachee.[86] Other tribes which at various times lived in or migrated through Georgia include the Apalachicola, the Chatot, the Yuchi, the Chiaha, the Chickasaw, the Okmulgee, the Shawnee and the Timucua.[87] Today there are no federally recognized tribes in Georgia, but there are three state-recognized tribes. Many inhabitants of Georgia identify as being Native American alone (32,151 people in 2010 census and 50,618 in 2020) or Native American in combination with one or more other races (51,873 people in 2010 census and 163,423 in 2020).[88] Many Georgians also reported belonging to various Native American tribes in 2010 census, the largest of which was the Cherokee (21,525 people). Other tribes reported in Georgia in 2010 included for example the Muscogee (2,370 people), the Choctaw (1,419), the Sioux (1,027), the Seminole (664) and more.[89] Georgia's 2018 total gross state product was $602 billion.[90] For years Georgia as a state has had the highest credit rating by Standard & Poor's (AAA) and is one of only 15 states with a AAA rating.[91] If Georgia were a stand-alone country, it would be the 28th-largest economy in the world, based on data from 2005.[92] There are 16 Fortune 500 companies and 26 Fortune 1000 companies with headquarters in Georgia, including Home Depot, UPS, Coca-Cola, TSYS, Delta Air Lines, Aflac, Southern Company, and Elevance Health Atlanta boasts the world's busiest airport, as measured both by passenger traffic and by aircraft traffic.[94][95] Also, the Port of Savannah is the fourth-largest seaport and fastest-growing container seaport in North America, importing and exporting a total of 2.3 million TEUs per year.[96] Atlanta has a significant effect on the state of Georgia, the Southeastern United States, and beyond. It has been the site of growth in finance, insurance, technology, manufacturing, real estate, service, logistics, transportation, film, communications, convention and trade show businesses and industries, while tourism is important to the economy. Atlanta is a global city, also called world city or sometimes alpha city or world center, as a city generally considered to be an important node in the global economic system. For the five years through November 2017, Georgia has been ranked the top state (number 1) in the nation to do business, and has been recognized as number 1 for business and labor climate in the nation, number 1 in business climate in the nation, number 1 in the nation in workforce training and as having a \"Best in Class\" state economic development agency.[97][98] In 2016, Georgia had a median annual income per person of between $50,000 and $59,999, which is in inflation-adjusted dollars for 2016. The U.S. median annual income for the entire nation is $57,617. This lies within the range of Georgia's median annual income.[99] A 2024 study listed Georgia in the top 20 of states for an affordable cost of living.[100] While many textile jobs moved overseas, there is still a textile industry located around the cities of Rome, Columbus, Augusta, Macon and along the I-75 corridor between Atlanta and Chattanooga, Tennessee. Historically it started along the fall line in the Piedmont, where factories were powered by waterfalls and rivers. It includes the towns of Cartersville, Calhoun, Ringgold and Dalton[101] In November 2009, the South Korean automaker Kia Corporation began production in Georgia. The first Kia plant built in the U.S., Kia Motors Manufacturing Georgia, is located in West Point. Rivian, an electric vehicle manufacturer, plans to begin production at a facility in Social Circle in 2024.[102] Industrial products include textiles and apparel, transportation equipment, food processing, paper products, chemicals and products, and electric equipment. Widespread farms produce peanuts, corn, and soybeans across middle and south Georgia. The state is the number one producer of pecans in the world, thanks to Naomi Chapman Woodroof regarding peanut breeding, with the region around Albany in southwest Georgia being the center of Georgia's pecan production. Gainesville in northeast Georgia touts itself as the Poultry Capital of the World. Georgia is in the top five blueberry producers in the United States.[103] The Georgia Film, Music and Digital Entertainment Office promotes filming in the state.[104] Since 1972, over eight hundred films and 1,500 television shows have been filmed on location in Georgia.[105] Georgia overtook California in 2016 as the state with the most feature films produced on location. In the fiscal year 2017, film and television production in Georgia had an economic impact of $9.5 billion.[106] Atlanta has been called the \"Hollywood of the South\".[107] Television shows like Stranger Things, The Walking Dead, and The Vampire Diaries are filmed in the state.[108] Movies such as Passengers, Forrest Gump, Contagion, Hidden Figures, Sully, Baby Driver, The Hunger Games: Catching Fire, Captain America: Civil War, Black Panther, Birds of Prey, and many more, were filmed around Georgia.[109][110] Georgia's electricity generation and consumption are among the highest in the United States, with natural gas being the primary electrical generation fuel, followed by coal. The state also has two nuclear power facilities, Plant Hatch and Plant Vogtle, which contribute almost one fourth of Georgia's electricity generation, and two additional nuclear reactors are being built at Vogtle as of 2022.[citation needed] In 2013, the generation mix was 39% gas, 35% coal, 23% nuclear, 3% hydro and other renewable sources. The leading area of energy consumption is the industrial sector because Georgia \"is a leader in the energy-intensive wood and paper products industry\".[111] Solar generated energy is becoming more in use with solar energy generators currently installed ranking Georgia 15th in the country in installed solar capacity. In 2013, $189 million was invested in Georgia to install solar for home, business and utility use representing a 795% increase over the previous year.[112] Major products in the mineral industry include a variety of clays, stones, sands and the clay palygorskite, known as attapulgite. Georgia was ranked the number 2 state for infrastructure and global access by Area Development magazine.[113] The Georgia Ports Authority owns and operates four ports in the state: Port of Savannah, Port of Brunswick, Port Bainbridge, and Port Columbus. The Port of Savannah is the third-busiest seaport in the United States,[114] importing and exporting a total of 4.9[115] million TEUs for 2023.[96] The Port of Savannah's Garden City Terminal is the largest single container terminal in North America.[116] Several major companies including Target, IKEA, and Heineken operate distribution centers in close proximity to the Port of Savannah. Hartsfield–Jackson Atlanta International Airport moves over 650,000 tons of cargo annually through three cargo complexes (2 million square feet or 200,000 square meters of floor space). It has nearby cold storage for perishables; it is the only airport in the Southeast with USDA-approved cold-treatment capabilities. Delta Air Lines also offers an on-airport refrigeration facility for perishable cargo, and a 250-acre Foreign Trade Zone is located at the airport.[117] Georgia is a major railway hub, has the most extensive rail system in the Southeast, and has the service of two Class I railroads, CSX and Norfolk Southern, plus 24 short-line railroads. Georgia is ranked the No. 3 state in the nation for rail accessibility. Rail shipments include intermodal, bulk, automotive and every other type of shipment.[118] Georgia has an extensive interstate highway system including 1,200 miles (1,900 kilometers) of interstate highway and 20,000 miles (32,000 kilometers) of federal and state highways that facilitate the efficient movement of more than $620 billion of cargo by truck each year. Georgia's six interstates connect to 80 percent of the U.S. population within a two-day truck drive. More than $14 billion in funding has been approved[when?] for new roadway infrastructure.[119] Southern Congressmen have attracted major investment by the U.S. military in the state. The several installations include Moody Air Force Base, Fort Stewart, Hunter Army Airfield, Naval Submarine Base Kings Bay, Fort Moore, Robins Air Force Base, Fort Eisenhower, Marine Corps Logistics Base Albany, Dobbins Air Reserve Base, Coast Guard Air Station Savannah and Coast Guard Station Brunswick. These installations command numerous jobs and business for related contractors. In the Atlanta area, World of Coke, Georgia Aquarium, Zoo Atlanta and Stone Mountain are important tourist attractions.[120][121] Stone Mountain is Georgia's \"most popular attraction\"; receiving more than four million tourists per year.[122][123] The Georgia Aquarium, in Atlanta, was the largest aquarium in the world in 2010 according to Guinness World Records.[124] Callaway Gardens, in western Georgia, is a family resort.[125] The area is also popular with golfers. The Savannah Historic District attracts more than eleven million tourists each year.[126] The Golden Isles is a string of barrier islands off the Atlantic coast of Georgia near Brunswick that includes beaches, golf courses and the Cumberland Island National Seashore. Several sites honor the lives and careers of noted American leaders: the Little White House in Warm Springs, which served as the summer residence of President Franklin Delano Roosevelt while he was being treated for polio; President Jimmy Carter's hometown of Plains and the Carter Presidential Center in Atlanta; the Martin Luther King Jr. National Historical Park in Atlanta, which is the final resting place of Martin Luther King Jr. and Coretta Scott King; and Atlanta's Ebenezer Baptist Church, where King preached. Georgia has a progressive income tax structure with six brackets of state income tax rates that range from 1% to 6%. In 2009, Georgians paid 9% of their income in state and local taxes, compared to the U.S. average of 9.8% of income.[127] This ranks Georgia 25th among the states for total state and local tax burden.[127] The state sales tax in Georgia is 4%[128] with additional percentages added through local options (e.g. special-purpose local-option sales tax or SPLOST), but there is no sales tax on prescription drugs, certain medical devices, or food items for home consumption.[129] The state legislature may allow municipalities to institute local sales taxes and special local taxes, such as the 2% SPLOST tax and the 1% sales tax for MARTA serviced counties. Excise taxes are levied on alcohol, tobacco, and motor fuel. Owners of real property in Georgia pay property tax to their county. All taxes are collected by the Georgia Department of Revenue and then properly distributed according to any agreements that each county has with its cities. Georgia's major fine art museums include the High Museum of Art and the Michael C. Carlos Museum, both in Atlanta; the Georgia Museum of Art on the campus of the University of Georgia in Athens; Telfair Museum of Art and the SCAD Museum of Art in Savannah; and the Morris Museum of Art in Augusta.[130] The state theatre of Georgia is the Springer Opera House located in Columbus. The Atlanta Opera brings opera to Georgia stages.[131] The Atlanta Symphony Orchestra is the most widely recognized orchestra and largest arts organization in the southeastern United States.[132] There are a number of performing arts venues in the state, among the largest are the Fox Theatre, and the Alliance Theatre at the Woodruff Arts Center, both on Peachtree Street in Midtown Atlanta as well as the Cobb Energy Performing Arts Centre, located in Northwest Atlanta. Two movies, both set in Atlanta, won Oscars for Best Picture: Gone with the Wind (1939) and Driving Miss Daisy (1989). Other films set in Georgia include Deliverance (1972), Parental Guidance (2012), and Vacation (2015). Authors have grappled with Georgia's complex history. Popular novels related to this include Margaret Mitchell's Gone with the Wind, Olive Ann Burns' Cold Sassy Tree, and Alice Walker's The Color Purple. A number of noted authors, poets and playwrights have lived in Georgia, such as James Dickey, Flannery O'Connor, Sidney Lanier, Frank Yerby and Lewis Grizzard.[133] A number of notable musicians in various genres of popular music are from Georgia. Among them are Ray Charles (whose many hits include \"Georgia on My Mind\", now the official state song), and Gladys Knight (known for her Georgia-themed song, \"Midnight Train to Georgia\"). Rock groups from Georgia include the Atlanta Rhythm Section, The Black Crowes, and The Allman Brothers. The city of Athens sparked an influential rock music scene in the 1980s and 1990s. Among the groups achieving their initial prominence there were R.E.M., Widespread Panic, and the B-52's. Since the 1990s, various hip-hop and R&B musicians have included top-selling artists such as Outkast, Usher, Ludacris, TLC, B.o.B., and Ciara. Atlanta is mentioned in a number of these artists' tracks, such as Usher's \"A-Town Down\" reference in his 2004 hit \"Yeah!\" (which also features Atlanta artists Lil Jon and Ludacris), Ludacris' \"Welcome to Atlanta\", Outkast's album \"ATLiens\", and B.o.B.'s multiple references to Decatur, Georgia, as in his hit song \"Strange Clouds\". Well-known television shows set in Atlanta include, from Tyler Perry Studios, House of Payne and Tyler Perry's Meet the Browns, The Real Housewives of Atlanta, the CBS sitcom Designing Women, Matlock, the popular AMC series The Walking Dead, FX comedy drama Atlanta, Lifetime's Drop Dead Diva, Rectify and numerous HGTV original productions. The Dukes of Hazzard, a 1980s TV show, was set in the fictional Hazzard County, Georgia. The first five episodes were shot on location in Conyers and Covington, Georgia as well as some locations in Atlanta. Production was then moved to Burbank, California.[citation needed] Also filmed in Georgia was The Vampire Diaries, using Covington as the setting for the fictional Mystic Falls. Sports in Georgia include professional teams in nearly all major sports, Olympic Games contenders and medalists, collegiate teams in major and small-school conferences and associations, and active amateur teams and individual sports. The state of Georgia has teams in four major professional leagues—the Atlanta Braves of Major League Baseball, the Atlanta Falcons of the National Football League, the Atlanta Hawks of the National Basketball Association, and Atlanta United FC of Major League Soccer. The Georgia Bulldogs (Southeastern Conference), Georgia Tech Yellow Jackets (Atlantic Coast Conference), Georgia State Panthers and Georgia Southern Eagles (Sun Belt Conference) are Georgia's NCAA Division I FBS football teams, having won multiple national championships between them. The Georgia Bulldogs and the Georgia Tech Yellow Jackets have a historical rivalry in college football known as Clean, Old-Fashioned Hate, and the Georgia State Panthers and the Georgia Southern Eagles have recently developed their own rivalry. The 1996 Summer Olympics took place in Atlanta. The stadium that was built to host various Olympic events was converted to Turner Field, home of the Atlanta Braves through 2016. Atlanta will serve as a host city for the 2026 FIFA World Cup.[134] The Masters golf tournament, the first of the PGA Tour's four \"majors\", is held annually the second weekend of April at the Augusta National Golf Club. The RSM Classic is a golf tournament on the PGA Tour, played in the autumn in Saint Simons Island, Georgia.[135] The Atlanta Motor Speedway hosts the Dixie 500 NASCAR Cup Series stock car race and Road Atlanta the Petit Le Mans endurance sports car race. Atlanta's Georgia Dome hosted Super Bowl XXVIII in 1994 and Super Bowl XXXIV in 2000. The dome has hosted the NCAA Final Four Men's Basketball National Championship in 2002, 2007, and 2013.[136] It hosted WWE's WrestleMania XXVII in 2011, an event which set an attendance record of 71,617. The venue was also the site of the annual Chick-fil-A Peach Bowl post-season college football games. Since 2017, they have been held at the Mercedes-Benz Stadium along with the FIRST World Championships. Professional baseball's Ty Cobb was the first player inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame. He was from Narrows, Georgia and was nicknamed the \"Georgia Peach\".[137] The Mercedes-Benz Stadium hosted Super Bowl LIII in 2018 and the CFP National Championship in the same year, the SEC Championship Game in 2017, the MLS All-Star Game in 2018, the MLS Cup in 2018, and the record-setting friendly fixture between Mexico Men's National Football Team and Honduras Men's National Football Team. WWE Hall of Famer Hulk Hogan is from Augusta, Georgia, and State Farm Arena is to host RAW on January 27, 2025. Atlanta has also hosted WrestleMania XXVII and the 2002 and 2010 Royal Rumble. State Farm Arena also hosted Bad Blood (2024).[138] Georgia county and city public school systems are administered by school boards with members elected at the local level. As of 2013[update], all but 19 of 181 boards are elected from single-member districts. Residents and activist groups in Fayette County sued the board of commissioners and school board for maintaining an election system based on at-large voting, which tended to increase the power of the majority and effectively prevented minority participation on elected local boards for nearly 200 years.[139] A change to single-member districts has resulted in the African-American minority being able to elect representatives of its choice. Georgia high schools (grades nine through twelve) are required to administer a standardized, multiple choice End of Course Test, or EOCT, in each of eight core subjects: algebra, geometry, U.S. history, economics, biology, physical science, ninth grade literature and composition, and American literature. The official purpose of the tests is to assess \"specific content knowledge and skills\". Although a minimum test score is not required for the student to receive credit in the course, completion of the test is mandatory. The EOCT score accounts for 15% of a student's grade in the course.[140] The Georgia Milestone evaluation is taken by public school students in the state.[141] In 2020, because of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, the Georgia State BOE agreed to state superintendent Richard Woods' proposal to change the weight of the EOCT test to only count for 0.01% of the Student's course grade. This change is currently only in effect for the 2020–21 school year.[142] Georgia has 85 public colleges, universities, and technical colleges in addition to more than 45 private institutes of higher learning. Among Georgia's public universities is the flagship research university, the University of Georgia, founded in 1785 as the country's oldest state-chartered university and the birthplace of the American system of public higher education.[143] The University System of Georgia is the presiding body over public post-secondary education in the state. The System includes 29 institutions of higher learning and is governed by the Georgia Board of Regents. Georgia's workforce of more than 6.3 million is constantly refreshed by the growing number of people who move there along with the 90,000 graduates from the universities, colleges and technical colleges across the state, including the highly ranked University of Georgia, Georgia Institute of Technology, Georgia State University, Kennesaw State University and Emory University.[144] The HOPE Scholarship, funded by the state lottery, is available to all Georgia residents who have graduated from high school or earned a General Educational Development certificate. The student must maintain a 3.0 or higher grade point average and attend a public college or university in the state.[145] The Georgia Historical Society, an independent educational and research institution, has a research center located in Savannah. The research center's library and archives hold the oldest collection of materials related to Georgia history in the nation. The Atlanta metropolitan area is the ninth largest media market in the United States as ranked by Nielsen Media Research. The state's other top markets are Savannah (95th largest), Augusta (115th largest), and Columbus (127th largest).[146] There are 48 television broadcast stations in Georgia including TBS, TNT, TCM, Cartoon Network, CNN and Headline News, all founded by notable Georgia resident Ted Turner. The Weather Channel also has its headquarters in Atlanta. By far, the largest daily newspaper in Georgia is the Atlanta Journal-Constitution with a daily readership of 195,592 and a Sunday readership of 397,925.[147][148] Other large dailies include The Augusta Chronicle, the Columbus Ledger-Enquirer, The Telegraph (formerly The Macon Telegraph) and the Savannah Morning News. WSB-AM in Atlanta was the first licensed radio station in the southeastern United States, signing on in 1922. Georgia Public Radio has been in service since 1984[149][150] and, with the exception of Atlanta, it broadcasts daily on several FM (and one AM) stations across the state. Georgia Public Radio reaches nearly all of Georgia (with the exception of the Atlanta area, which is served by WABE). WSB-TV in Atlanta is the state's oldest television station, having begun operations in 1948. WSB the first television service in Georgia, and the South.[151] As with all other U.S. states and the federal government, Georgia's government is based on the separation of legislative, executive, and judicial power.[152] Executive authority in the state rests with the governor, currently Brian Kemp (Republican). Both the Governor of Georgia and lieutenant governor are elected on separate ballots to four-year terms of office. Unlike the federal government, but like many other U.S. States, most of the executive officials who comprise the governor's cabinet are elected by the citizens of Georgia rather than appointed by the governor. Legislative authority resides in the General Assembly, composed of the Senate and House of Representatives. The Lieutenant Governor presides over the Senate, while members of the House of Representatives select their own Speaker. The Georgia Constitution mandates a maximum of 56 senators, elected from single-member districts, and a minimum of 180 representatives, apportioned among representative districts (which sometimes results in more than one representative per district); there are currently 56 senators and 180 representatives. The term of office for senators and representatives is two years.[153] The laws enacted by the General Assembly are codified in the Official Code of Georgia Annotated. State judicial authority rests with the state Supreme Court and Court of Appeals, which have statewide authority.[154] In addition, there are smaller courts which have more limited geographical jurisdiction, including Superior Courts, State Courts, Juvenile Courts, Magistrate Courts and Probate Courts. Justices of the Supreme Court and judges of the Court of Appeals are elected statewide by the citizens in non-partisan elections to six-year terms. Judges for the smaller courts are elected to four-year terms by the state's citizens who live within that court's jurisdiction. Georgia consists of 159 counties, second only to Texas, with 254.[155] Georgia had 161 counties until the end of 1931, when Milton and Campbell were merged into the existing Fulton. Some counties have been named for prominent figures in both American and Georgian history, and many bear names with Native American origin. Counties in Georgia have their own elected legislative branch, usually called the Board of Commissioners, which usually also has executive authority in the county.[156] Several counties have a sole Commissioner form of government, with legislative and executive authority vested in a single person. Georgia is the only state with current Sole Commissioner counties. Georgia's Constitution provides all counties and cities with \"home rule\" authority. The county commissions have considerable power to pass legislation within their county, as a municipality would. Georgia recognizes all local units of government as cities, so every incorporated town is legally a city. Georgia does not provide for townships or independent cities, though there have been bills proposed in the Legislature to provide for townships;[157] it does allow consolidated city-county governments by local referendum. All of Georgia's second-tier cities except Savannah have now formed consolidated city-county governments by referendum: Columbus (in 1970), Athens (1990), Augusta (1995), and Macon (2012). (Augusta and Athens have excluded one or more small, incorporated towns within their consolidated boundaries; Columbus and Macon eventually absorbed all smaller incorporated entities within their consolidated boundaries.) The small town of Cusseta adopted a consolidated city-county government after it merged with unincorporated Chattahoochee County in 2003. Three years later, in 2006, the town of Georgetown consolidated with the rest of Quitman County. There is no true metropolitan government in Georgia, though the Atlanta Regional Commission (ARC) and Georgia Regional Transportation Authority do provide some services, and the ARC must review all major land development projects in the Atlanta metropolitan area.[citation needed][158] Georgia voted Republican in six consecutive presidential elections from 1996 to 2016, a streak that was broken when the state went for Democratic candidate Joe Biden in 2020.[159] Until 1964, Georgia's state government had the longest unbroken record of single-party dominance, by the Democratic Party, of any state in the Union. This record was established largely due to the disenfranchisement of most blacks and many poor whites by the state in its constitution and laws in the early 20th century. Some elements, such as requiring payment of poll taxes and passing literacy tests, prevented blacks from registering to vote; their exclusion from the political system lasted into the 1960s and reduced the Republican Party to a non-competitive status in the early 20th century.[160] White Democrats regained power after Reconstruction due in part to the efforts of some using intimidation and violence, but this method came into disrepute.[161] In 1900, shortly before Georgia adopted a disfranchising constitutional amendment in 1908, blacks comprised 47% of the state's population.[162] The whites dealt with this problem of potential political power by the 1908 amendment, which in practice disenfranchised blacks and poor whites, nearly half of the state population. It required that any male at least 21 years of age wanting to register to vote must also be of good character and able to pass a test on citizenship, be able to read and write provisions of the U.S. and Georgia constitutions, or own at least forty acres of land or $500 in property. Any Georgian who had fought in any war from the American Revolution through the Spanish–American War was exempted from these additional qualifications. More importantly, any Georgian descended from a veteran of any of these wars also was exempted. Because, by 1908, many white Georgia males were grandsons of veterans or owned the required property, the exemption and the property requirement basically allowed only well-to-do whites to vote. The qualifications of good character, citizenship knowledge, literacy (all determined subjectively by white registrars), and property ownership were used to disqualify most blacks and poor whites, preventing them from registering to vote. The voter rolls dropped dramatically.[161][163] In the early 20th century, Progressives promoted electoral reform and reducing the power of ward bosses to clean up politics. Their additional rules, such as the eight-box law, continued to effectively close out people who were illiterate.[21] White one-party rule was solidified. For more than 130 years, from 1872 to 2003, Georgians nominated and elected only white Democratic governors, and white Democrats held the majority of seats in the General Assembly.[164] Most of the Democrats elected throughout these years were Southern Democrats, who were fiscally and socially conservative by national standards.[165][166] This voting pattern continued after the segregationist period.[167] Legal segregation was ended by passage of federal legislation in the 1960s. According to the 1960 census, the proportion of Georgia's population that was African American was 28%; hundreds of thousands of blacks had left the state in the Great Migration to the North and Midwest. New white residents arrived through migration and immigration. Following support from the national Democratic Party for the civil rights movement and especially civil rights legislation of 1964 and 1965, most African-American voters, as well as other minority voters, have largely supported the Democratic Party in Georgia.[168] In 2002, incumbent moderate Democratic Governor Roy Barnes was defeated by Republican Sonny Perdue, a state legislator and former Democrat. While Democrats retained control of the State House, they lost their majority in the Senate when four Democrats switched parties. They lost the House in the 2004 election. Republicans then controlled all three partisan elements of the state government. Even before 2002, the state had become increasingly supportive of Republicans in Presidential elections. It has supported a Democrat for president only four times since 1960. In 1976 and 1980, native son Jimmy Carter carried the state; in 1992, the former Arkansas governor Bill Clinton narrowly won the state; and in 2020, Joe Biden narrowly carried the state. Generally, Republicans were strongest in the predominantly white suburban (especially the Atlanta suburbs) and rural portions of the state.[169] Many of these areas were represented by conservative Democrats in the state legislature well into the 21st century. One of the most conservative of these was U.S. Congressman Larry McDonald, former head of the John Birch Society, who died when the Soviet Union shot down KAL 007 near Sakhalin Island. Democratic candidates have tended to win a higher percentage of the vote in the areas where black voters are most numerous,[169] as well as in the cities among liberal urban populations (especially Atlanta and Athens), and the central and southwestern portion of the state. The ascendancy of the Republican Party in Georgia and in the South in general resulted in Georgia U.S. House of Representatives member Newt Gingrich being elected as Speaker of the House following the election of a Republican majority in the House in 1994. Gingrich served as Speaker until 1999, when he resigned in the aftermath of the loss of House seats held by members of the GOP. Gingrich mounted an unsuccessful bid for president in the 2012 election, but withdrew after winning only the South Carolina and Georgia primaries. In 2008, Democrat Jim Martin ran against incumbent Republican Senator Saxby Chambliss. Chambliss failed to acquire the necessary 50 percent of votes due to a Libertarian Party candidate receiving the remainder of votes. In the runoff election held on December 2, 2008, Chambliss became the second Georgia Republican to be reelected to the U.S. Senate. In the 2018 elections, the governorship remained under control by a Republican (by 54,723 votes against a Democrat, Stacey Abrams), Republicans lost eight seats in the Georgia House of Representatives (winning 106), while Democrats gained ten (winning 74), Republicans lost two seats in the Georgia Senate (winning 35 seats), while Democrats gained two seats (winning 21), and five Democrat U.S. Representatives were elected with Republicans winning nine seats (one winning with just 419 votes over the Democratic challenger, and one seat being lost).[170][171][172] In the three presidential elections up to and including 2016, the Republican candidate has won Georgia by approximately five to eight points over the Democratic nominee, at least once for each election being narrower than margins recorded in some states that have flipped within that timeframe, such as Michigan, Ohio and Wisconsin. This trend led to the state narrowly electing Democrat Joe Biden for president in 2020, and it coming to be regarded as a swing state.[173][174] In a 2020 study, Georgia was ranked as 49th on the \"Cost of Voting Index\" with only Texas ranking higher.[175] In 2022, Georgia swung substantially back to the right towards Republicans with incumbent Republican Governor Brian Kemp winning reelection by 7.5% over Democrat Stacey Abrams with a raw vote margin of over 300,000 votes in the 2022 Georgia gubernatorial election; the largest amount since the early 2000s, and every other Republican statewide getting elected by a 5–10% margin of victory.[citation needed] During the 1960s and 1970s, Georgia made significant changes in civil rights and governance. As in many other states, its legislature had not reapportioned congressional districts according to population from 1931 to after the 1960 census. Problems of malapportionment in the state legislature, where rural districts had outsize power in relation to urban districts, such as Atlanta's, were corrected after the U.S. Supreme Court ruling in Wesberry v. Sanders (1964). The court ruled that congressional districts had to be reapportioned to have essentially equal populations. A related case, Reynolds v. Sims (1964), required state legislatures to end their use of geographical districts or counties in favor of \"one man, one vote\"; that is, districts based upon approximately equal populations, to be reviewed and changed as necessary after each census. These changes resulted in residents of Atlanta and other urban areas gaining political power in Georgia in proportion to their populations.[176] From the mid-1960s, the voting electorate increased after African Americans' rights to vote were enforced under civil rights law. Economic growth through this period was dominated by Atlanta and its region. It was a bedrock of the emerging \"New South\". From the late 20th century, Atlanta attracted headquarters and relocated workers of national companies, becoming more diverse, liberal and cosmopolitan than many areas of the state. In the 21st century, many conservative Democrats, including former U.S. Senator and governor Zell Miller, decided to support Republicans. The state's then-socially conservative bent resulted in wide support for measures such as restrictions on abortion. In 2004, a state constitutional amendment banning same-sex marriages was approved by 76% of voters.[177] However, after the United States Supreme Court issued its ruling in Obergefell v. Hodges, all Georgia counties came into full compliance, recognizing the rights of same-sex couples to marry in the state.[178] In presidential elections, Georgia voted solely Democratic in every election from 1900 to 1960. In 1964, it was one of only a handful of states to vote for Republican Barry Goldwater over Democrat Lyndon B. Johnson. In 1968, it did not vote for either of the two parties, but rather the American Independent Party and its nominee, Alabama Governor George Wallace. In 1972, the state returned to Republicans as part of a landslide victory for Richard Nixon. In 1976 and 1980, it voted for Democrat and former Georgia governor Jimmy Carter. The state returned to Republicans in 1984 and 1988, before going Democratic once again in 1992. For every election between that year and 2020, Georgia voted heavily Republican, in line with many of its neighbors in the Deep South. In 2020, it voted Democratic for the first time in 28 years, aiding Joe Biden in his defeat of incumbent Republican Donald Trump. Prior to 2020, Republicans in state, federal and congressional races had seen decreasing margins of victory, and many election forecasts had ranked Georgia as a \"toss-up\" state, or with Biden as a very narrow favorite.[179] Concurrent with the 2020 presidential election were two elections for both of Georgia's United States Senate seats (one of which being a special election due to the resignation of Senator Johnny Isakson, and the other being regularly scheduled). After no candidate in either race received a majority of the vote, both went to January 5, 2021, run-offs, which Democrats Jon Ossoff and Raphael Warnock won. Ossoff is the state's first Jewish senator, and Warnock is the state's first Black senator. Biden's, Ossoff's, and Warnock's wins were attributed to the rapid diversification of the suburbs of Atlanta[180] and increased turnout of younger African American voters, particularly around the suburbs of Atlanta and in Savannah, Georgia.[181][182][183] There are 48 state parks, 15 historic sites, and numerous wildlife preserves under supervision of the Georgia Department of Natural Resources.[184] Other historic sites and parks are supervised by the National Park Service and include the Andersonville National Historic Site in Andersonville; Appalachian National Scenic Trail; Chattahoochee River National Recreation Area near Atlanta; Chickamauga and Chattanooga National Military Park at Fort Oglethorpe; Cumberland Island National Seashore near St. Marys; Fort Frederica National Monument on St. Simons Island; Fort Pulaski National Monument in Savannah; Jimmy Carter National Historic Site near Plains; Kennesaw Mountain National Battlefield Park near Kennesaw; Martin Luther King Jr. National Historical Park in Atlanta; Ocmulgee National Monument at Macon; Trail of Tears National Historic Trail; and the Okefenokee Swamp in Waycross, Georgia.[185] Outdoor recreational activities include hiking along the Appalachian Trail; Civil War Heritage Trails; rock climbing and whitewater kayaking.[186][187][188][189] Other outdoor activities include hunting and fishing. Transportation in Georgia is overseen by the Georgia Department of Transportation, a part of the executive branch of the state government. Georgia's major Interstate Highways are I-20, I-75, I-85, and I-95. On March 18, 1998, the Georgia House of Representatives passed a resolution naming the portion of Interstate 75, which runs from the Chattahoochee River northward to the Tennessee state line the Larry McDonald Memorial Highway. Larry McDonald, a Democratic member of the House of Representatives, had been on Korean Air Lines Flight 007 when it was shot down by the Soviets on September 1, 1983. Georgia's primary commercial airport is Hartsfield–Jackson Atlanta International Airport (ATL), the world's busiest airport.[190] In addition to Hartsfield–Jackson, there are eight other airports serving major commercial traffic in Georgia. Savannah/Hilton Head International Airport is the second-busiest airport in the state as measured by passengers served, and is the only additional international airport. Other commercial airports (ranked in order of passengers served) are located in Augusta, Columbus, Albany, Macon, Brunswick, Valdosta, and Athens.[191] The Georgia Ports Authority manages two deepwater seaports, at Savannah and Brunswick, and two river ports, at Bainbridge and Columbus. The Port of Savannah is a major U.S. seaport on the Atlantic coast. The Metropolitan Atlanta Rapid Transit Authority (MARTA) is the principal rapid transit system in the Atlanta metropolitan area. Formed in 1971 as strictly a bus system, MARTA operates a network of bus routes linked to a rapid transit system consisting of 48 miles (77 km) of rail track with 38 train stations. MARTA operates almost exclusively in Fulton and DeKalb counties, with bus service to two destinations in Cobb county and the Cumberland Transfer Center next to the Cumberland Mall, and a single rail station in Clayton County at Hartsfield–Jackson Atlanta International Airport. MARTA also operates a separate paratransit service for disabled customers. As of 2009[update], the average total daily ridership for the system (bus and rail) was 482,500 passengers.[192] The state has 151 general hospitals, more than 15,000 doctors and almost 6,000 dentists.[193] The state is ranked forty-first in the percentage of residents who engage in regular exercise.[194] Jimmy Carter, from Plains, Georgia, was President of the United States from 1977 to 1981. Martin Luther King Jr. was born in Atlanta in 1929. He was a civil rights movement leader who protested for equal rights and against racial discrimination. He won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1964.[195] Blake R. Van Leer played an important role in the civil rights movement, Georgia's economy and was president of Georgia Tech.[196] Mordecai Sheftall, the highest ranking Jewish officer in the American Revolution, was born and lived his life in Georgia.[197] Naomi Chapman Woodruff, originally from Idaho, was responsible for developing a peanut breeding program in Georgia which lead to a harvest of nearly five times the typical amount.[198] 33°N 83°W﻿ / ﻿33°N 83°W﻿ / 33; -83﻿ (State of Georgia)",

                "content": "Meghan, Duchess of Sussex (/ˈmɛɡən/; born Rachel Meghan Markle; August 4, 1981) is an American member of the British royal family, media personality and former actress. She is married to Prince Harry, Duke of Sussex, the younger son of King Charles III. Meghan was born and raised in Los Angeles, California. Her acting career began at Northwestern University. She played the part of Rachel Zane for seven seasons (2011–2018) in the American TV legal drama Suits. She also developed a social media presence, which included The Tig (2014–2017), a lifestyle blog. During The Tig period, Meghan became involved in charity work focused primarily on women's issues and social justice. She was married to American film producer Trevor Engelson from 2011 until their divorce in 2014. Meghan retired from acting upon her marriage to Prince Harry in 2018 and became known as the Duchess of Sussex. Meghan and Harry have two children: Archie and Lilibet. The couple stepped down as working royals in January 2020, moved to Meghan's native Southern California and launched Archewell Inc., a Beverly Hills-based mix of for-profit and not-for-profit (charitable) business organizations. In March 2021, she and her husband participated in Oprah with Meghan and Harry, a much-publicized American television interview by Oprah Winfrey. She has written The Bench (a picture book for children) and presented a podcast Archetypes. Meghan and Harry starred in Harry & Meghan, a Netflix docuseries, which was released in December 2022. Rachel Meghan Markle was born on August 4, 1981, at West Park Hospital in Canoga Park, Los Angeles, California. She identifies as mixed race; \"My dad is Caucasian and my mom is African American. I'm half black and half white.\"[1] Her parents – former makeup artist Doria Ragland (born 1956) and Thomas Markle Sr. (born 1944), a television lighting director and director of photography[2][3] – separated when she was two years old and divorced four years later.[4][5][6] Markle reportedly has a close relationship with her mother.[7][8] Until the age of nine, both parents contributed to raising her; then, her father was left in charge of caring for her (while her mother pursued a career) so Meghan lived with him full-time before commencing university at age eighteen.[9][10] Markle Sr. worked as a director of photography and lighting for General Hospital and Married... with Children, and Meghan occasionally visited the set of Married... with Children as a child.[11][12] In later life, she became estranged from her father and paternal half-siblings, Samantha Markle and Thomas Markle Jr.[13][14] Growing up in View Park–Windsor Hills, Los Angeles,[15] Markle attended Hollywood Little Red Schoolhouse.[16][17] At age eleven, she and her classmates wrote to Procter & Gamble to gender-neutralize a dishwashing soap commercial on national television.[18] She was raised as a Christian, though conflicting reports indicate she was raised either Catholic or Protestant.[19][20][21] She graduated from Immaculate Heart High School (Los Angeles), a fee-charging all-girls Catholic school.[22] Markle took part in plays and musicals at the school, where her father helped with lighting.[23] During her teenage years, she worked at a local frozen yogurt shop and later as a waitress and babysitter.[24][25] She also volunteered at a soup kitchen in Skid Row, Los Angeles.[26][27] In 1999, she was admitted to Northwestern University (NU) in Evanston, Illinois, where she joined Kappa Kappa Gamma sorority.[28][29] With other members of Kappa Kappa Gamma, Markle did volunteer work with the Glass Slipper Project. After her junior year, her uncle Michael Markle helped secure her an internship as a junior press officer at the American embassy in Buenos Aires,[30] and considered a political career.[31][32] However, she did not score high enough in the Foreign Service Officer Test to proceed further with the US State Department[33] and returned to NU. She also attended a study abroad program in Madrid.[29] In 2003, Markle earned her bachelor's degree with a double major in theater and international studies from Northwestern's School of Communication.[31][33] According to Markle, she had some difficulty getting roles early in her career due to being \"ethnically ambiguous\" because \"I wasn't black enough for the black roles and I wasn't white enough for the white ones.\"[34] To support herself between acting jobs, she worked as a freelance calligrapher and taught bookbinding.[11][35] Her first on-screen appearance was a small role as a nurse in an episode of the daytime soap opera General Hospital,[36][37] a show for which her father served as a lighting director.[38] Markle had small guest roles on the television shows Century City (2004), The War at Home (2006) and CSI: NY (2006).[36] For her role in Century City, she told the casting directors that she was a SAG-AFTRA member when she was not, but after being cast, the employers were obliged to help her join the union according to the Taft–Hartley Act.[39] Markle also did several contract acting and modeling jobs. Between 2006 and 2007, she worked as a \"briefcase girl\" on 34 episodes of the US version of the game show Deal or No Deal.[11] She appeared in Fox's series Fringe as Junior Agent Amy Jessup in the first two episodes of its second season.[40] Markle appeared in small roles in the films Get Him to the Greek, Remember Me (produced by her then-partner Trevor Engelson) and The Candidate in 2010 and the film Horrible Bosses in 2011.[41] She was paid $187,000 for her role in Remember Me and $171,429 for her role in the short film The Candidate.[42] In July 2011, she joined the cast of the USA Network show Suits through to late 2017 and the seventh season. Her character, Rachel Zane, began as a paralegal and eventually became an attorney.[43] While working on Suits, she lived for nine months each year in Toronto.[44][45] Fortune magazine estimated that she was paid $50,000 per episode, amounting to an equivalent annual salary of $450,000.[46] Markle and American film producer Trevor Engelson began dating in 2004.[47][48] They were married in Ocho Rios, Jamaica on August 16, 2011.[49] They separated in July 2013, and granted a no-fault divorce in February 2014, citing irreconcilable differences.[50] Markle's subsequent live-in relationship with Canadian celebrity chef and restaurateur Cory Vitiello ended in May 2016 after almost two years.[51] In mid-2016,[52] Markle began a relationship with Prince Harry, a grandson of Queen Elizabeth II.[53][54] According to the couple, they first connected with each other via Instagram,[55] and they have also said that they were set up on a blind date by a mutual friend in July 2016.[52] On November 8, eight days after the relationship was made public by the press, the prince directed his communications secretary to release a statement on his behalf to express personal concern about pejorative and false comments made about his girlfriend by mainstream media and internet trolls.[56][57] Later, in a letter to a British media regulator, Markle's representatives complained about harassment from journalists.[58] In September 2017, Markle and Prince Harry appeared together in public in Toronto at the Invictus Games, of which Harry is founding patron.[59][60] Meghan Markle's engagement to Prince Harry was announced on November 27, 2017, by Harry's father Charles (then the Prince of Wales).[61] The announcement was greeted with enthusiasm by the British media and prompted generally positive comments about a mixed-race person as a member of the royal family,[62] especially in regard to Commonwealth countries.[9] Markle announced that she would retire from acting[63][64] and her intention to become a British citizen.[65] In preparation for the wedding, the Archbishop of Canterbury, Justin Welby, baptized Markle and confirmed her in the Church of England on March 6, 2018.[66] The private ceremony, performed with water from the River Jordan, took place in the Chapel Royal at St James's Palace.[66] The marriage ceremony was held on May 19 at St George's Chapel, Windsor Castle.[67] Her wedding dress was designed by Clare Waight Keller.[68] Markle later revealed that there was a private exchange of vows three days earlier, with the Archbishop of Canterbury in the couple's garden.[69] However, this private exchange of vows was not a legally recognized marriage.[70][71] After the wedding, the Duke and Duchess lived at Nottingham Cottage in London, in the grounds of Kensington Palace.[72] In May 2018, it was reported that they had signed a two-year lease on Westfield Large, located on the Great Tew Estate in the Cotswolds.[73] They gave up the lease after photos of the house and its interior were published by a paparazzi agency.[73] The couple considered settling at the twenty-one room Apartment 1 within Kensington Palace,[74][75] but moved to Frogmore Cottage in the Home Park of Windsor Castle instead.[76][77] The Crown Estate refurbished the cottage at a cost of £2.4 million, paid out of the Sovereign Grant, with the Duke later reimbursing expenses beyond restoration and ordinary maintenance, a part of which was offset against rental payments that were due at the time.[78][79] Meghan gave birth to a son, Archie, on May 6, 2019.[80] The Duke and Duchess of Sussex's office moved to Buckingham Palace and officially closed on March 31, 2020, when the Sussexes withdrew from undertaking official royal engagements.[81][82] After some months in Canada and the United States, in June 2020, the couple bought a house on the former estate of Riven Rock, Montecito, California.[83][84] The next month, Meghan suffered a miscarriage.[85] She gave birth to a daughter, Lilibet, on June 4, 2021.[86] The Duke and Duchess own a Labrador named Pula and two Beagles named Guy and Mamma Mia.[87][88] Meghan previously owned a Labrador-German Shepherd cross named Bogart.[89] Markle was politically vocal before marrying Prince Harry. At age 9, she and her friends reportedly campaigned against the Gulf War.[90] Decades later, she backed Hillary Clinton during the 2016 United States presidential election and publicly denounced the opponent and eventual winner, Donald Trump. In the same year, when the referendum on the United Kingdom's membership of the European Union resulted in favor of Brexit, Markle expressed her disappointment on Instagram.[91] In 2017, Markle recommended the book Who Rules the World? by left-wing intellectual Noam Chomsky on her Instagram account.[92] In July 2018, Irish Senator Catherine Noone tweeted that the Duchess was \"pleased to see the result\" of the Irish referendum on legalizing abortion. Meghan received criticism for potentially breaching the protocol that prohibits royals from interfering in politics;[93] Noone deleted her tweet and emphasized that her statement was misleading and \"the Duchess was not in any way political\".[93] After she returned to the United States and as an eligible voter, she released a video with her husband encouraging others to register for the 2020 United States presidential election on National Voter Registration Day. Some media outlets took it as an implicit endorsement of the Democratic candidate, Joe Biden, which prompted then-President Trump to dismiss their messaging at a press conference.[94] In October 2021, she penned an open letter to Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, advocating for paid leave for parents.[95] Her remarks were met by backlash from Republican representatives Jason Smith and Lisa McClain, who found her statement \"out of touch\" and criticized her interference with American politics while utilizing her British royal titles.[96] Meghan has reportedly lobbied senators from both parties on the issue of paid family leave, including Democratic senators Patty Murray and Kirsten Gillibrand, as well as Republican senators Shelley Moore Capito and Susan Collins.[97][98] She has also publicly spoken in support of federal voting protections.[99] In February 2022, she voiced her support for the Supreme Court nomination of Ketanji Brown Jackson.[100] In June 2022, she publicly supported Moms Demand Action, an organization which campaigns for safer gun laws in the US.[101] In the same month, in an interview with Jessica Yellin for Vogue, Meghan criticized the decision of the Supreme Court of the United States that abortion is not a protected constitutional right and voiced her support for the proposed Equal Rights Amendment.[102] After becoming engaged, Markle's first official public appearance with Prince Harry was at a World AIDS Day walkabout in Nottingham on December 1, 2017.[103][104] On March 12, the 2018 Commonwealth Day service at Westminster Abbey was the first royal event she attended with the Queen.[105] On March 23, Harry and Meghan made an unannounced day visit to Northern Ireland.[106] In total, Markle attended 26 public engagements prior to the wedding.[107] Meghan's first official engagement after marriage was on May 22, when she and her husband attended a garden party celebrating the charity work of King Charles III (then the Prince of Wales).[108] In July 2018, Meghan's first official trip abroad as a royal was to Dublin, Ireland, alongside Harry.[109][110] In October 2018, the Duke and Duchess traveled to Sydney for the 2018 Invictus Games.[111] This formed part of a Pacific tour that included Australia, Fiji, Tonga and New Zealand.[112][113] As representatives of the Queen, the couple were greeted warmly by crowds in Sydney, and the announcement of Meghan's pregnancy hours after their arrival delighted the public and media.[113][114] During their visit to Morocco in February 2019, the Duke and Duchess focused on projects centered on \"women's empowerment, girls' education, inclusivity and encouragement of social entrepreneurship\".[115] Meghan also participated in her husband's work as youth ambassador to the Commonwealth, which included overseas tours.[116][117] As part of establishing a separate office from that of the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge in 2019, the Duke and Duchess created an Instagram social media account, which broke the record for the fastest account at the time to reach a million followers.[118] In July 2019, the Duchess's security team were criticized for creating an empty zone of about 40 seats around her at Wimbledon where she was watching a match between Serena Williams and Kaja Juvan.[119] In August 2019, Meghan and her husband were criticized by environmental campaigners for using private jets regularly when taking their personal trips abroad, which would leave more carbon footprint per person compared to commercial planes. The criticism was in line with similar criticism faced by the royal family in June 2019, after it was claimed that they \"had doubled [their] carbon footprint from business travel\".[120][121] In September and October 2019, a Southern African tour included Malawi, Angola, South Africa and Botswana. Archie traveled with his parents, making it \"their first official tour as a family\".[122] Meghan completed 179 engagements in total in 2018 and 2019.[123] In January 2020, Meghan and Harry returned to the UK from a vacation in Canada and announced that they were stepping back from their role as senior members of the royal family and would balance their time between the United Kingdom and North America.[124][125] A statement released by the Palace confirmed that the Duke and Duchess were to cease to undertake royal duties as representatives of the Queen and would therefore no longer receive the relevant financial support.[126] The couple would retain their HRH styles but not use them.[126] The formal role of the Duke and Duchess was subject to a twelve-month review period, ending in March 2021. Meghan's final public solo engagement as a senior royal was a visit to Robert Clack School on March 7, 2020, in Dagenham ahead of International Women's Day.[127] She and Harry attended the Commonwealth Day service at Westminster Abbey on March 9, 2020, which was their last engagement as a couple before they officially stepped down on March 31. Two years later, they made their first official appearance in the UK in June 2022 while attending the Platinum Jubilee National Service of Thanksgiving.[128] They visited the UK and Germany in September 2022 for a number of charity events in Manchester and Düsseldorf.[129] On September 8, 2022, while Meghan and Harry were in London preparing to attend a charity event, Queen Elizabeth II died at Balmoral Castle in Scotland, and they remained in the United Kingdom for her funeral.[130] Meghan and Harry visited Nigeria in May 2024 to honor the work of the Invictus Games. Meghan had previously stated that a genetic test had found she was of 43% Nigerian ancestry. According to CNN, their trip focused on \"sports rehabilitation, mental health, and women's empowerment\".[131] Meghan co-hosted a women's empowerment summit with the head of the World Trade Organization, Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala, and she was honored in a ceremony by some of the Nigerian Chiefs.[131] In summer 2019, before announcing their decision to step down in January 2020, Meghan and her husband were involved in talks with Jeffrey Katzenberg, the founder of the now-defunct streaming platform Quibi, over a possible role in the service without gaining personal profits, but they eventually decided against joining the project.[132] In September 2019, it was reported that the couple had hired New York-based PR firm Sunshine Sachs, which represented them until 2022.[133][134][135] The couple has also been associated with Adam Lilling's Plus Capital, a venture capital fund designed to connect early stage companies with influencers and investors.[136] In June 2020, they signed with the Harry Walker Agency, owned by media company Endeavor, to conduct paid public speaking engagements.[137] In September 2020, the Sussexes signed a private commercial deal with Netflix.[138] In December 2020, it was announced that Meghan had invested in Clevr Blends, a coffee company based in Southern California.[139][140] In the same month, Meghan and Harry signed a multi-year deal with Spotify to produce and host their own programs through their audio producing company, Archewell Audio.[141] A holiday special was released by the couple on the service in December 2020,[142] while Meghan's podcast, titled Archetypes, premiered in August 2022.[143][144] In June 2023, Spotify cancelled the podcast, which ran for a single season of 12 episodes.[145][146] The Bench, a picture book written by Meghan with illustrations by Christian Robinson, was published in June 2021 by Random House Children's Books. It is based on her perception of the relationship between her husband and their son.[147] The book received a mixed response; it garnered praise for its illustrations and messaging but was criticized for its structure and writing.[148][149][150] On June 17, the book reached number one in the children's picture books category of The New York Times Best Seller list.[151] In July 2021, it was announced that Meghan would executive produce, alongside David Furnish, a Netflix animated series called Pearl.[152] The series was originally pitched to Netflix in 2018.[153][154] Pearl would depict the adventures of a 12-year-old girl who is inspired by influential women from history,[155] but the project was canceled in May 2022.[156] In the same month, it was reported that Meghan and Harry had signed a four-book publishing deal with Random House, including a wellness guide by Meghan and a memoir by Harry.[157] In October 2021, Meghan and Harry announced their partnership with Ethic, a sustainable investment firm based in New York City, which also manages the couple's investments.[158][159] According to state filings from Delaware, where the couple's Archewell foundation is registered, Meghan and Harry incorporated 11 companies and a trust beginning in early 2020 which include Orinoco Publishing LLC and Peca Publishing LLC to hold the rights for their books as well as Cobblestone Lane LLC and IPHW LLC which are holders of their foundation's logos.[160] Frim Fram Inc., which ran The Tig, had been registered earlier as a new corporation in Delaware in December 2019.[161] Harry & Meghan, a docuseries about the Sussexes, was produced by Netflix and the couple's Archewell Productions and premiered on December 8, 2022. It is directed by Liz Garbus.[162] The series received mixed reviews.[163] In April 2023, it was announced that she had signed with talent agency WME, which would represent Archewell as well.[164] In March 2024, Meghan launched the lifestyle and cooking brand American Riviera Orchard.[165] In April 2024, it was announced that Archewell Productions is working with Netflix to produce two new shows – on lifestyle and on polo – for the streaming platform.[166][167] Later in August, it was revealed that she had invested in the handbag brand Cesta Collective, which sold handwoven basket bags prepared by a group of women in Rwanda that were then completed in Italy.[168] In November of the same year she invested in the haircare line Highbrow Hippie.[169] Markle became a counsellor for the international network One Young World in 2014 and spoke at its 2014 summit in Dublin[171] and attended the 2016 opening ceremony in Ottawa.[172] Also in 2014, she toured Spain, Italy, Turkey, Afghanistan and England with the United Service Organizations.[173] During her time in Toronto, she volunteered for the Community Meals Program of St. Felix Centre and donated food from the set of Suits.[174][175] In 2016, Markle became a global ambassador for World Vision Canada, traveling to Rwanda for the Clean Water Campaign.[176][177][34] After a trip to India focused on raising awareness for women's issues, she penned an op-ed for Time magazine concerning stigmatization of women in regard to menstrual health.[178] She has also worked with the United Nations Entity for Gender Equality and the Empowerment of Women as an advocate.[176][179] Her speech at the UN Women's 2015 conference as an advocate for political participation and leadership contained a number of sentences that were nearly identical to a 1951 speech by Eleanor Roosevelt.[180][181] In 2017, Markle joined Prince Harry in teaming up with the charity Elephants Without Borders to assist with the conservation efforts taking place in Botswana.[182] In January 2018, Markle became interested in the Hubb Community Kitchen run by survivors of the Grenfell Tower fire. She visited the kitchen regularly and suggested that the displaced women publish a cookbook to assist in funding for the group.[183] Together: Our Community Cookbook, her first charity project as Duchess of Sussex, was announced in September.[184] In August 2020, Meghan used proceeds from the cookbook to donate £8,000 to the UK charity Migrateful, which supports refugees, asylum seekers and migrants by helping them organize cookery classes.[185] In March 2021, she donated £10,000 from the proceeds to the UK-based charity Himmah to assist them with stocking the group's food bank, provide them with equipment and help the Salaam Shalom Kitchen, the only Muslim and Jewish community kitchen in the UK.[186] In March 2020, it was announced that Meghan's first post-royal project would be the narration of Disneynature's documentary Elephant, which was released on April 3.[187] In support of elephants, Disneynature and the Disney Conservation Fund would donate to Elephants Without Borders for species conservation in Botswana.[188] In June 2020, the couple backed the Stop Hate for Profit campaign and encouraged CEOs of different companies to join the movement.[189] In July 2020, she spoke in support of the Black Lives Matter movement.[190] In April 2021, the couple were announced as campaign chairs for Vax Live: The Concert to Reunite the World, an event organized by Global Citizen to increase access to COVID-19 vaccinations.[191] They also announced their support for a vaccine equity fundraiser initiated by the same organization,[192] and penned an open letter to the pharmaceutical industry CEOs urging them to address the vaccine equity crisis.[193] In July 2021, Meghan and Harry were among people who were selected by UK-based charity Population Matters to receive the Change Champions Award for their decision to have only two children and help with maintaining a smaller and more sustainable population.[194] In August 2021, to mark her 40th birthday, Meghan launched 40x40, a campaign that asks people around the world to spend 40 minutes of their time mentoring women reentering the workforce.[195] In October 2021 and ahead of the 2021 G20 Rome summit, the couple penned an open letter together with the Director-General of the World Health Organization Tedros Adhanom, asking the G20 leaders to expedite efforts for the global distribution of COVID-19 vaccines.[196] In February 2022, the couple were selected to receive NAACP's President's Award for their work on causes related to social justice and equity.[197] In the following month, they were among more than a hundred people who signed an open letter published by the People's Vaccine Alliance, asking for free global access to COVID-19 vaccines and calling out the UK, EU and Switzerland for opposing a waiver that would allow vaccine intellectual property protections to be lifted.[198] In October 2022, Meghan and Harry were named as Ripple of Hope Award laureates for their work on racial justice, mental health and other social initiatives through their foundation Archewell.[199] In April 2023, she was named as a recipient of the Ms. Foundation for Women's Women of Vision Award.[200] From January 2019 to February 2021, Meghan was patron of London's National Theatre and the Association of Commonwealth Universities.[201][202] She continued her role as the private patron of Mayhew until 2022.[203] She remains a private patron of Smart Works.[202] From March 2019 to February 2021, she was the vice president of The Queen's Commonwealth Trust.[204][202] Until February 2021, periodically, online QCT chat sessions were conducted and uploaded to YouTube for general public viewing.[205] In October 2019, along with other members of the royal family, Meghan voiced a Public Health England announcement, for the \"Every Mind Matters\" mental health program.[206] In 2019 Meghan was a contributor and guest editor for the September issue of British Vogue and highlighted the works of 15 women from different areas, who were described as \"Forces for Change\".[207] Edward Enninful, editor-in-chief of the British Vogue, later revealed that the issue had become the \"fastest-selling issue in the history of British Vogue\".[208] In the same issue, it was announced that she had collaborated with a number of British fashion houses and stores to launch a capsule collection, called The Smart Set, in September 2019 to benefit the charity Smart Works. The collection sought to help \"unemployed and disadvantaged women\", through selling items \"on a one-for-one basis, meaning an item is donated for each item purchased\".[209] Taking advantage of the \"Meghan Markle effect\" (driving consumer purchases), in 10 days the collection provided a year's worth of clothes for the charity.[210] In February 2018, Markle and fiancé Harry attended the first annual forum of The Royal Foundation.[211] After marriage, Meghan became the foundation's fourth patron alongside Prince Harry, Prince William and his wife, Catherine.[212] In May 2019, as a part of their Heads Together initiative, the Duchess of Sussex together with her husband and in-laws launched Shout, a text messaging service for those who suffer from mental issues.[213] In June 2019, it was announced that Harry and Meghan would split from the charity and establish their own foundation. Nevertheless, the couples would collaborate on mutual projects, such as the mental health initiative Heads Together.[214][215] The following month, \"Sussex Royal The Foundation of The Duke and Duchess of Sussex\" was registered in England and Wales.[216] However, it was confirmed on February 21, 2020, that \"Sussex Royal\" would not be used as a brand name for the couple, following their step back from official life as working royals.[217] On August 5, 2020, the Sussex Royal Foundation was renamed \"MWX Foundation\" and dissolved the same day.[218] In March 2021, it was reported that the Charity Commission for England and Wales was conducting a review of the Sussex Royal organization in a \"regulatory and compliance case\" regarding its conduct under charity law during dissolution.[219] Representatives for the couple claimed that Sussex Royal was \"managed by a board of trustees\" and that \"suggestion of mismanagement\" directed exclusively at the Duke and Duchess would be incorrect.[219] The commission later concluded that the foundation did not act unlawfully, but criticized the board of directors for expending a \"substantial proportion of funds\" to setting up and closing the charity.[220][221] In April 2020, Meghan and Harry confirmed that an alternative foundation (in lieu of Sussex Royal) would be called \"Archewell\".[222] The name stems from the Greek word \"arche\", which means \"source of action\"—the same word that inspired the name of their son.[222] Archewell was registered in the United States.[223] Its website was officially launched in October 2020.[224] Between 2010 and 2012, Markle anonymously ran the blog The Working Actress, which detailed the \"pitfalls and triumphs of struggling to make it in Hollywood\".[225] In 2014, she founded her own lifestyle blog The Tig, which posted articles about food, fashion, beauty, travel, and inspirational women.[226] The viewing audience consisted primarily of the fans of Markle and Suits. Promotion of the blog on other social media platforms targeted three million followers on Instagram, 800,000 on Facebook and 350,000 on Twitter.[227] In April 2017, The Tig closed. In January 2018, she took all articles offline and deleted her social media accounts.[227] It is estimated that Markle's social media activities annually earned her about $80,000 from endorsements and sponsorships.[42] She rejoined Instagram in January 2025.[228] She was also known for socializing at Soho House.[229] Markle became known through The Tig for her fashion sense,[45] releasing two fashion collections with Canadian clothing company Reitmans in 2015 and 2016.[227] The lines were based on her personal style and that of her Suits character.[45] Markle has cited Emmanuelle Alt as her style inspiration.[230][231] In 2016, she hosted USA Network's video series Power Lunch with Meghan Markle in collaboration with Lexus and Eater, discussing the culinary inspirations of five different New York kitchens.[232] In 2015, Markle visited Malta after discovering an ancestor had been born there. Her trip was documented by Elle UK.[233][234] She was featured in the cover story for the October 2017 issue of Vanity Fair and the December 2017 issue of Elle France.[235][236] Shortly after her engagement to Prince Harry in 2017, she caused a surge of interest in Scottish retailer Strathberry after carrying one of its handbags to a public event.[237][238] This was reported as an indication that her fashion choices would produce results similar to the Kate Middleton effect.[237][239] After Markle and Prince Harry's first appearance as a couple, brands Mackage, Birks, R&R Jewelers, Crown Jewelers, and Everlane noted an upswing in their website hits and sales.[240][241][238] It was speculated that Markle's effect would be broader internationally because she already had a strong American appeal.[239] Consequently, the United States saw a boost in yellow gold jewelry sales in the first quarter of 2018.[242] In 2018, Tatler included Meghan with other senior royal women on its list of Britain's best dressed people.[243] Following the announcement of her pregnancy, she appeared in a Karen Gee dress that resulted in the Australian designer's website crashing.[244] Fashion website Net-a-Porter ranked Meghan as one of the best dressed women in 2018.[245] She was nominated for the 2018 Teen Choice Awards in the category Choice Style Icon.[246] In 2019, British brand Reiss reported a growth in profits after Meghan was seen wearing a mini dress by them on International Women's Day.[247] In 2022, the black Armani dress worn by Meghan during her Oprah interview was selected by the Fashion Museum, Bath, as Dress of the Year 2021.[248] In the same year, she was featured in the cover story for the 2022 Fall Fashion issue of The Cut.[249] There was controversy over her claim in the interview that she had been told at the premiere of The Lion King that her marriage resulted in rejoicing in South Africa similar to that seen at Nelson Mandela's release from prison in 1990.[250] In 2018, Time selected Meghan as one of the 100 Most Influential People in the World[251] and placed her on its shortlist for Person of the Year.[252] Her name appeared again on the listicle in 2021, and she and her husband were featured on one of the magazine's seven worldwide covers.[253] In 2019, the magazine named Meghan and Prince Harry among the 25 Most Influential People on the Internet.[254] She was also chosen as one of the 25 most influential women in the United Kingdom by British Vogue magazine in 2018, 2019 and 2021.[255][256][257] Her influence was also recognized in both the 2019 and 2020 editions of Powerlist, the 100 most influential Britons of African and Afro-Caribbean descent.[258] In 2022, she was named as one of the 50 Women Changing the World over the past year by Worth magazine.[259] In the same year, Variety named her as a stellar honoree for its Power of Women issue,[260][261] and Financial Times included her on its list of \"25 most influential women of 2022\".[262] In December 2022, Meghan was found to be the second most disliked member of the British royal family by statistics and polling company YouGov, behind her husband's uncle Prince Andrew.[263] In March 2023, The Independent included her on its \"Influence List 2023\".[264] Meghan and Harry's exit from the royal family was satirized in a 2023 episode of South Park.[265] In the same year, James Hibberd of The Hollywood Reporter named Meghan and Harry among the Hollywood losers of 2023.[266] Following Meghan and Harry's trip to Nigeria in May 2024, Lucia Stein of the ABC argued that the couple could have been used by the royal family, and added that \"perhaps how helpful they would have been\" had an agreement on a \"hybrid working model\" been achieved.[267] Among other things, she noted Meghan's style and meetings were extensively covered internationally. Media editor, Tina Brown commented in relation to the visit, they are \"enormously appealing to the public, and very good at [public engagement].\"[267] Brown later criticized Meghan's activities arguing that she had \"the worst judgement of anyone in the entire world\" and \"her issue is that she doesn't listen... She does what she wants to do.\"[268] In November 2016, the MailOnline was criticized for running an article on Markle's family background titled \"(Almost) Straight Outta Compton\", which triggered a response from Prince Harry's Communications Secretary.[15] In October 2019, Meghan filed a lawsuit against Associated Newspapers Limited (ANL), the publisher of The Mail on Sunday and MailOnline over the publication of a letter she had sent to her father.[269][270] Thomas Markle Sr. had provided the publisher with excerpts of the letter after five of his daughter's friends, including Abigail Spencer,[271] referenced it in a People article.[4][272][273] She subsequently received support from more than 70 female MPs from different parties who in an open letter condemned the use of \"outdated, colonial undertones\" against her in some national media outlets.[274] In May 2020, the court dismissed claims of the tabloid's alleged dishonesty and malice, as they were deemed either vague or irrelevant to the case.[275] In February 2021, the High Court of Justice found in a summary judgment that ANL's Mail on Sunday had invaded Meghan's privacy by publishing the letter,[276] and she won her claim for \"misuse of private information and copyright infringement\" in May 2021.[277] She was given a £450,000 down payment on her £1.5 million legal fees as an interim payment, and pursuant to copyright law, her legal team asked for a front-page statement by The Mail on Sunday and MailOnline to acknowledge her legal victory.[278] The Court of Appeal granted ANL permission to appeal against the ruling.[279] The appeal was subsequently launched by ANL in November 2021.[280] Meghan and Harry's former communications secretary Jason Knauf—who had previously denied co-authoring the letter with Meghan[281]—gave a statement to the court of appeal, mentioning that Meghan gave him briefing points to share with Finding Freedom's authors Omid Scobie and Carolyn Durand and that Prince Harry welcomed the suggestion that they should conceal their involvement, while they both discussed the book \"on a routine basis\".[282] ANL had previously applied to use the book in their defense.[283][284] Knauf also revealed that Meghan wondered whether she should refer to her father as \"daddy\" in the letter, as she believed \"in the unfortunate event that it leaked, it would pull at the heartstrings\".[282] Meghan subsequently apologized to the court for not remembering the emails earlier, adding that the \"extent of the information\" Knauf shared with the book's authors was \"unknown\" to her.[285] She also stated in her witness statement that she was \"unable to retrieve any text messages with Mr Knauf\" due to \"an automatic deletion system\" that had been installed on her devices in 2016 for security reasons.[286] In December 2021, three senior appeal judges upheld the judgement of the High Court against ANL, prompting Meghan to call for reform of the tabloid industry.[287] In the same month, ANL's The Mail on Sunday and MailOnline published a front-page statement on Boxing Day acknowledging Meghan's victory, adding that there had been an agreement on \"financial remedies\".[288] In addition to covering a portion of Meghan's legal costs, the outlet agreed to pay her £1 in damages for invading her privacy and a confidential sum for infringing her copyright.[289] They were also banned from naming Meghan's friends, who had spoken to People magazine about the letter in 2018.[289] In November 2016, The Sun ran the headline \"Harry girl's on Pornhub\".[57] The outlet denied any smear after it was revealed that the clips were illegally uploaded scenes from the TV series Suits and not pornographic material.[57] They subsequently apologized via an official statement in February 2017.[290] In February 2018, a letter containing white powder and a racist note addressing Markle was sent to St James's Palace, triggering counter-terrorism and hate crime investigations by Scotland Yard.[291] Meghan and Harry obtained a formal apology in May 2019 from Splash News for privacy invasion at their Cotswolds residence.[292][293] In December 2019, PA Media retracted the publishing of a Christmas card photograph of Meghan, Harry, and their son Archie. The agency said that the photo was retracted because they had been advised that the photograph was \"not representative of the Christmas card sent by the Duke and Duchess of Sussex\".[294] The couple had a legal warning issued to the press in general in January 2020 after the publication of paparazzi photographs.[295] In March 2020, the couple took Splash UK to court after Meghan and her son were photographed without permission in Canada during a \"private family outing\". The case was settled later that year with Splash UK agreeing to no longer take unauthorized photos of the family.[296] The Duke and Duchess announced in April that they would no longer cooperate with the Daily Mail, The Sun, Daily Mirror and Daily Express.[297] They won an apology in October from American news agency X17 for taking photographs of their son at their home using drones.[298] In March 2021, ITV News reported Meghan had complained directly to ITV's CEO about Piers Morgan's comments on mental health following her interview with Oprah Winfrey.[299] Ofcom received over 57,000 complaints about the program including one from the Duchess of Sussex.[300][301] In the same month, it was reported that an American private investigator unlawfully handed over personal details about Meghan to The Sun, including her Social Security number, cell phone number and address, when she first started dating Prince Harry in 2016. Meghan and her husband condemned the \"predatory practices\" of the British tabloids, while The Sun stated that the investigator \"was instructed clearly in writing to act lawfully\", and they did not \"use the information he provided for any unlawful practice\".[302] In July 2021, Meghan filed legal complaints against The Times for two separate articles, with the first one covering an unproven allegation from Robert Lacey's book that she had left an engagement in Fiji for not being appointed by UN Women as a goodwill ambassador and the second one claiming that the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge had refused to talk to Prince Harry after Prince Philip's funeral due to fears of a potential leak.[303][304] In January 2022, the couple jointly filed a legal complaint against The Times for an article reporting on Archewell raising less than $50,000 in 2020.[305] In the same month, she complained to the BBC regarding their five-part podcast Harry, Meghan and the Media, in which the presenter Amol Rajan stated that Meghan had \"apologized for misleading\" the Court of Appeal in her case against the Mail on Sunday.[306][307] The BBC responded by issuing a statement on its \"corrections and clarifications\" website to emphasize that she had \"apologized to the court for not remembering email exchanges\".[307] In March 2022, Meghan's half-sister, Samantha Markle, filed a defamation lawsuit against her in Florida, accusing her of lying in the Oprah interview and disseminating false statements via her communications secretary for the book Finding Freedom and sought damages in excess of $75,000.[308][309] In June 2022, Meghan's initial motion to dismiss the case was rejected by a judge following amendments made by Samantha in her complaint.[310] She filed a second motion in the same month.[310][311] In addition to applying for the case to be dismissed, Meghan's lawyer also applied for the discovery process to be delayed, pending the outcome of the dismissal application.[312] A Florida judge later denied the application to halt the discovery process,[313] but dismissed the lawsuit in March 2023.[314] In April 2023, Samantha refiled the lawsuit with another amended complaint that covered statements made by Meghan in her Netflix docuseries as well.[315] The lawsuit was later dismissed with prejudice in March 2024, after a judge ruled that the claimant was unable to provide evidence of defamation.[316] Samantha later appealed the decision.[317] Between December 2022 and January 2023, more than 25,000 complaints were submitted to the Independent Press Standards Organisation (IPSO) about a column by Jeremy Clarkson in The Sun,[318] in which he stated that he hated Meghan \"on a cellular level\" and dreamed \"of the day when she is made to parade naked through the streets of every town in Britain while the crowds chant, 'Shame!' and throw lumps of excrement at her.\"[319] On December 20, 2022, Conservative MP Caroline Nokes wrote to The Sun's editor, Victoria Newton, calling for \"action [to be] taken\" against Clarkson. The letter was signed by more than 60 cross-party MPs.[320] On December 23, The Sun issued an apology, stating \"columnists' opinions are their own\" but they \"regret the publication of this article\" and are \"sincerely sorry\".[321] On the following day, a spokesperson for the Duke and Duchess of Sussex described the apology as \"nothing more than a PR stunt\".[322] Clarkson said his column was a reference to a scene from the television series Game of Thrones and he later revealed that he had emailed Meghan and Harry on Christmas Day 2022 to apologise.[318][323] A spokesperson for the couple said Clarkson wrote solely to Harry and the article was not an isolated incident.[318] In February 2023, IPSO announced that it was launching an investigation about the article.[324] In June 2023, IPSO concluded that the column was sexist and contained a \"pejorative and prejudicial reference\" to Meghan's sex, but it rejected complaints that the piece raised an issue of fact, or was meant to harass her or included discriminatory references on the grounds of race.[325] In 2021, shortly before Meghan and Harry were due to be interviewed by Oprah Winfrey, Valentine Low reported in The Times that Meghan's former communications secretary, Jason Knauf, complained in October 2018 that her conduct at Kensington Palace had caused two personal assistants to quit and had undermined the confidence of a third employee,[326] prompting an investigation by Buckingham Palace into the bullying allegations.[327][328] The palace hired an external law firm to examine the claims, with ten aides reported to have cooperated with the review.[329][330] Criticism of Meghan for twice wearing earrings gifted from Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman in 2018, after he was accused of complicity in the assassination of Jamal Khashoggi, appeared at the same time.[331][326][332] Her representatives denied her awareness of the accusations against Mohammed bin Salman and said The Times were being used by Buckingham Palace for \"a smear campaign\" against her.[333][326] The television special Oprah with Meghan and Harry was broadcast on CBS on March 7, 2021.[334] Meghan spoke about her personal and royal life and public pressure. She claimed to have been contemplating suicide during her time as a working royal and complained of a lack of protection for her and her son while being part of the royal institution.[335] There was a wide and polarized reaction to the interview.[336] In an updated epilogue for the couple's unauthorized biography, Finding Freedom by Omid Scobie and Carolyn Durand, the authors claimed that \"two of the individuals mentioned in [Knauf's] email asked for any allegations made to HR about their experiences with Meghan to be rescinded\".[337] Speaking on behalf of the Duchess in a BBC documentary, Jenny Afia, a lawyer who represented Meghan in her case against ANL, stated that the bullying allegations were \"just not true\".[338] In June 2022, The Times reported that the results from the inquiry made Buckingham Palace modify some of the policies and procedures in its HR department, but the report would not be published to ensure the privacy of those who took part in it.[339] In September 2024 The Hollywood Reporter reported on complaints raised by American staff members about Meghan's behavior. Her spokesperson declined to comment.[340] In March 2019, European consulting firm 89up reported on their discovery of 1,103 highly connected Twitter accounts with more than two and a half million tweets in favor of Meghan, most of which appeared to be bots carrying out \"coordinated attacks\" on royal correspondents who had reported negatively on her.[341][342] In the same year, CNN had reported on research by Hope not Hate, stating that out of 5,200 \"abusive tweets directed at Meghan\" in January and February 2019, 3,600 came from a small group of trolls.[341] In March 2019, the royal family introduced new rules for followers commenting on its official social media accounts in response to the online abuse aimed at Meghan and her sister-in-law Catherine.[343] In October 2021, Twitter analytics service Bot Sentinel released their analysis of more than 114,000 tweets about the Duke and Duchess of Sussex, as a result of which they found 83 accounts with a combined number of 187,631 followers that were possibly responsible for approximately 70% of the negative content posted about the couple.[344][345][346] The report prompted an investigation by Twitter.[344] The company stated that it found no evidence of \"widespread coordination\" between the accounts and said that it had taken action against users who violated Twitter's conduct policy.[344] Bot Sentinel released three more reports in the following months, arguing that the accounts were part of a \"bot network\" and a similar network could be found on YouTube.[347][348][349] In January 2022, the BBC named Meghan and Harry among people whose photos and videos were used in fake instant profits advertisements and bitcoin-related investment schemes.[350] Among theories widespread on social media, including Twitter and YouTube, were unfounded assertions that Meghan had faked her pregnancies, instead using surrogate mother(s), or that her children do not exist at all.[351][352][353] Meghan's half-sister, Samantha, was reported to have run multiple Twitter accounts that targeted Meghan.[354][355] Meghan became a princess of the United Kingdom upon her marriage to Prince Harry, entitled to the style of Royal Highness.[356] After her marriage, she was styled \"Her Royal Highness The Duchess of Sussex\". She also holds the titles of Countess of Dumbarton and Baroness Kilkeel.[357] She is the first person to hold the title \"Duchess of Sussex\".[358][359] Following the Duke and Duchess's decision to step back from royal duties in 2020, the couple agreed not to use the style of Royal Highness in practice, but they are still referred to as \"His/Her Royal Highness\" in legal settings.[360][361][362][363] During Meghan's trip to Nigeria in May 2024, Igwe Alfred Achebe, the Obi of Onitsha, and Oba Abdulrosheed Akanbi, the Oluwo of Iwo, gave her the chieftaincy titles Ada Mazi (transl. 'the daughter of the Igbo ancestral palace') and Adetokunbo (transl. 'royalty from across the seas').[131]",

                "content": "Editions: En/lifestyle/uk-news A joyful comeback with a purpose Meghan Markle has made a highly anticipated return to social media, marking a new chapter in her digital presence. The Duchess of Sussex, now 43, launched her new Instagram account with two posts this week. On New Year's Day, she shared a joyful video of herself frolicking on the beach, followed by a Thursday post promoting her upcoming Netflix cooking show. In a significant move to prioritize her mental health, Markle has disabled the comments section on her posts, effectively shielding herself from online trolling. Markle's return to social media comes after years of staying offline following intense scrutiny and cyberbullying. She has been vocal about the emotional toll of online abuse, particularly during her pregnancies with Prince Archie, now 5, and Princess Lilibet, 3. Speaking at a SXSW panel in March 2024, she recalled the relentless negativity she faced during that time. \"The bulk of the bullying and the abuse that I was experiencing in social media and online was when I was pregnant - with Archie and with Lili - and with a newborn with each of them,\" she shared, describing the comments as \"not catty\" but \"cruel.\" A source revealed to Page Six that Markle has collaborated with Meta executives to explore ways to foster safer online environments. While acknowledging there is more work to do, Markle reportedly feels optimistic about using her platform to lead by example. \"She feels confident that by returning to Instagram, she can amplify the progress made so far and lead by example in demonstrating the potential for social media to bring joy and positive connection,\" the source explained. This new chapter differs from Markle's earlier online presence when she ran her now-defunct lifestyle blog, The Tig, which encouraged open discussions before it was shuttered in 2017.

                "content": "Anthony Edwards (born August 5, 2001), nicknamed \"Ant-Man\" or simply \"Ant\",[1] is an American professional basketball player for the Minnesota Timberwolves of the National Basketball Association (NBA). A shooting guard, he played college basketball for the Georgia Bulldogs and was selected with the first overall pick by the Timberwolves in the 2020 NBA draft. He was named an All-Star during the 2022–23 and 2023–24 seasons. Edwards also won a gold medal on the 2024 U.S. Olympic team. Edwards finished his high school career at Holy Spirit Preparatory School in his hometown of Atlanta, Georgia, where he was rated a consensus five-star recruit and one of the best players in the 2019 class by major recruiting services. As a senior, he earned McDonald's All-American and USA Today All-USA first team honors. He committed to play college basketball for Georgia, becoming the highest-rated recruit to do so, and was named SEC Freshman of the Year after his freshman season with the team. Edwards spent his early life in Oakland City, Atlanta, Georgia.[2] When he was three years old, he was given the nickname \"Ant-Man\" by his father. For much of his childhood, Edwards played football in the running back, quarterback, and cornerback positions.[3] He played youth football for the Atlanta Vikings and became one of the best Pop Warner running backs in the country by age 10.[3][4][5] Edwards switched his focus to basketball because he \"thought it looked more fun\" after watching his brothers play the sport. He often played basketball with his brothers at their grandmother's house. Entering ninth grade, he began training with Justin Holland, a former college basketball player for Liberty and an Atlanta-based basketball trainer.[3] Due to his success with the Atlanta Xpress 15-under Amateur Athletic Union team, Edwards was considered a four-star recruit by Rivals in 2016.[6] He began playing high school basketball for Therrell High School in Atlanta as a member of the 2019 class.[7] In early January 2017, Edwards transferred to Holy Spirit Preparatory School in Atlanta and reclassified to the 2020 class. He made the move in an effort to improve his academic performance, since Holy Spirit Preparatory had \"small class sizes and support to help that.\"[8] In March 2018, Edwards helped Holy Spirit Preparatory defeat The Heritage School for the Georgia Independent School Association (GISA) Class AAA state championship.[9] He reclassified back to the 2019 class in November 2018 after seeing academic improvement.[7][10] As a result, Edwards rose to become the number one recruit in the Top247 rankings by recruiting website 247Sports.[11] In his senior season, his team finished as GISA Class AAA runners-up to The Heritage School, despite 27 points from Edwards.[12] At the end of the season, he was averaging 29 points, nine rebounds, and two assists per game.[13] Edwards garnered USA Today All-USA first team recognition.[13][14] He played in the McDonald's All-American Game and Jordan Brand Classic in March and April 2019, respectively.[15][16] By consensus among major recruiting services 247Sports, ESPN, and Rivals, Edwards was rated a five-star recruit, top-five player, and the top shooting guard in the 2019 class.[17][18][19] On February 11, 2019, he committed to play college basketball for Georgia, becoming the program's best recruit in the modern recruiting era.[20][21] Edwards chose the Bulldogs over offers from Florida State, Kansas, Kentucky, and North Carolina.[7] He was drawn to Georgia because two of his favorite players, Dwyane Wade and Victor Oladipo, had been coached in college by head coach Tom Crean.[22] Sources: On November 5, 2019, Edwards made his debut for the Georgia Bulldogs, recording 24 points, 9 rebounds, and 4 steals in a 91–72 win over Western Carolina. It was the most points by a Georgia freshman debutant since Basketball Hall of Fame inductee Dominique Wilkins in 1979.[23] On November 26, he scored a season-high 37 points, including 33 in the second half, and posted six rebounds, four steals, and three blocks in a 93–85 loss to third-ranked Michigan State at the Maui Invitational. Edwards became the first Georgia freshman to score at least 37 points in a game since Jacky Dorsey in 1975.[24] In his final game at the tournament, he led all scorers with 24 points and made the game-winning shot against NCAA Division II team Chaminade.[25] On February 1, 2020, Edwards recorded 29 points and 15 rebounds, both game-highs, in a 63–48 victory over Texas A&M.[26] In his next game, he led all scorers with 32 points in an 81–75 loss to Florida.[27] On February 26, Edwards scored 36 points and collected seven rebounds, four assists and four steals, in a 94–90 overtime defeat to South Carolina.[28] As a freshman, he averaged 19.1 points, 5.2 rebounds and 2.8 assists per game.[29] Edwards was the top scorer on his team and among freshmen nationally. He earned second-team All-SEC and SEC Freshman of the Year honors.[30] Edwards collected SEC Freshman of the Week accolades four times during the season, the most in program history.[31] He was also one of five finalists for the Jerry West Award, which recognizes the top collegiate shooting guard.[32] On March 20, 2020, in the spring of his freshman year, Edwards declared for the 2020 NBA draft as one of the most touted prospects in his class. He signed with an agent, forgoing his remaining college basketball eligibility.[33] The 2020 NBA draft was delayed by five months due to the COVID-19 pandemic. In November 2020, the Minnesota Timberwolves selected Edwards as the No. 1 overall pick on draft night. On December 23, 2020, he made his NBA debut, putting up 15 points, 4 rebounds, and 4 assists in 25 minutes, in a 111–101 win against the Detroit Pistons.[34] On March 18, 2021, Edwards scored a then career-high 42 points, along with 7 rebounds and 3 assists, in a game against the Phoenix Suns, becoming the third-youngest player to score 40+ points in NBA history.[35] After the season, he finished second in Rookie of the Year voting and was named to the NBA All-Rookie First Team.[36][37] On November 10, 2021, Edwards scored a then career-high 48 points on 7 three-pointers in a 123–110 loss to the Golden State Warriors.[38] On January 25, 2022, in a 109–107 win over the Portland Trail Blazers, he became the first player in NBA history to record a stat line of at least 40 points, 9 rebounds, 3 blocks, 3 steals, and 5 three-pointers in a single game; he joined Carmelo Anthony as the only players to score 40 points without an assist at 20 years old or younger.[39][40] On April 7, 2022, Edwards scored a career-high 49 points in a 127–121 win over the San Antonio Spurs.[41] In his playoff debut on April 16, 2022, he logged 36 points and 6 assists in a 130–117 Game 1 win over the Memphis Grizzlies in the opening round of the 2022 NBA playoffs.[42] Minnesota lost to Memphis despite Edwards's 30-point, 5-rebound, 5-assist, 2-steal and 2-block outing in the 114–106 close-out loss in Game 6.[43] On January 21, 2023, Edwards scored a season-high 44 points, including a season-high 8 three-pointers, along with 6 rebounds, 4 assists, 3 steals, and 3 blocks in a 113–104 win over the Houston Rockets.[44] On February 10, 2023, he was named an All-Star for the first time in his career as a reserve. Edwards and De'Aaron Fox were announced as injury replacements for injured stars Stephen Curry and Zion Williamson.[45] On April 9, in the final game of the 2022–23 season, Edwards recorded 26 points, 13 rebounds, 4 assists, 4 steals, and 4 blocks to help lead the Timberwolves to a 113–108 win over the New Orleans Pelicans, earning the eight seed in the Western Conference play-in tournament.[46] In Game 2 of the Timberwolves' first-round playoff series against the Denver Nuggets, Edwards put up 41 points in a 122–113 loss. His 41 points also set a Timberwolves franchise record for the most points scored in a playoff game, surpassing Sam Cassell's previous record of 40.[47] On April 21, in Game 3 of the first round of the playoffs, Edwards scored 36 points in a 120–111 loss. He joined Kobe Bryant with the second-most 30-point NBA playoff games before turning 22 years old.[48] In Game 4, Edwards had 34 points, 6 rebounds, 5 assists, 2 steals, and 3 blocks and scored a crucial 3-pointer to lead the Timberwolves to a 114–108 overtime win.[49] In Game 5, the Timberwolves were eliminated from the playoffs by the eventual NBA champion Nuggets despite 29 points, 8 rebounds, 7 assists, and 2 blocks by Edwards. With the Nuggets leading 112–109 in the final seconds of the game, Edwards missed a game-tying three-pointer at the buzzer.[50] Edwards changed his jersey number from #1 to #5 before the 2023–24 season.[51] On November 13, 2023, he was named the NBA Western Conference Player of the Week for the first time in his career after leading Minnesota to an undefeated week (4–0) with averages of 31.3 points, 6.3 rebounds, 6.8 assists and 2.0 steals.[52] On January 27, 2024, Edwards recorded 32 points, 6 rebounds and a career-high 12 assists in a 113–112 loss against the San Antonio Spurs.[53] On February 1, Edwards was named to his second All-Star Game as a Western Conference reserve.[54] On April 9, Edwards put up a career-high 51 points in a 130–121 win over the Washington Wizards.[55] At the season's end, Edwards was named to the All-NBA Second Team for the first time in his career.[56] In Game 4 of the first round of the playoffs against Phoenix, Edwards scored 31 of his 40 points in the second half, along with nine rebounds and six assists in a 122–116 win to close out the series. It was the Timberwolves' first playoff series win in 20 years. He also surpassed Kevin Garnett for the most 30-point playoff games in Timberwolves franchise history, with eight.[57][58] In Game 1 of the Western Conference Semifinals, Edwards scored a then playoff career-high and franchise postseason-record 43 points in a 106–99 victory over the Nuggets. He joined Kobe Bryant as the only players with consecutive 40-point games at age 22 or younger in NBA postseason history.[59] In Game 4 of the Western Conference Semifinals, Edwards scored a playoff career-high and franchise postseason-record 44 points, along with five rebounds and five assists, in a 115–107 loss to the Nuggets.[60] In Game 4 of the Western Conference Finals, Edwards posted a near triple-double with 29 points, 10 rebounds and 9 assists in a 105–100 victory over the Dallas Mavericks.[61] Minnesota would go on to lose to Dallas in five games despite Edwards 28-point, 9-rebound and 6-assist outing in a 124–103 close-out loss in Game 5.[62] Edwards was a member of the United States national team that competed in the 2023 FIBA Basketball World Cup. He started all eight games and was selected in the All-FIBA World Cup Team. He was the leading scorer for the U.S., averaging 18.9 points per game. The team finished in fourth place.[63] He was named to the 2024 Olympic team.[64] He helped Team USA win the gold medal, and in six games, he averaged 12.8 points, 2.8 rebounds, 1.2 assists and 1.3 steals per game while shooting 58% from the field.[65] Edwards plays primarily as a shooting guard. He’s listed at 6’4” (1.93 meters) and weighs 225lb (102 kilograms).[66] He’s known for his explosive athleticism, often going viral for his thunderous poster dunks, including one over John Collins that the NBA named the 2023-24 Dunk of the Year.[67] The Ringer called him \"a preposterous athlete with a nice jumper and better instincts\".[68] He’s drawn comparisons to a young Michael Jordan for his ability to finish around the rim. “They have a lot of the same mannerisms. The moves, the fadeaway, the athleticism, the poster dunks… that same kind of work ethic, that same kind of ‘I don’t sleep at all at night because I’m ready to play, I’m ready to hoop,” according to teammate Mike Conley.[69] Despite pre-draft concerns that he was a limited long-range scorer, Edwards has developed an efficient, high-volume three-point shot — shooting 36% on almost eight attempts per game.[66] In 2024, he became the youngest player in NBA history to make 800 threes.[70] His stout frame, lateral speed and competitiveness have helped transform his reputation on the defensive end — Team USA coach Steve Kerr called his on-ball defense “amazing” during the FIBA World Cup.[71] His ability to match up against both long wings and shifty guards has garnered praise from Timberwolves head coach Chris Finch. Edwards himself believes his defense is “overlooked” by the national media.[72] Edwards's daughter, Aislynn, was born March 2024.[74] Edwards left the Timberwolves’ March 1 game against the Sacramento Kings at halftime to be with Aislynn's mother, Shannon, as their child was born. Edwards's mother, Yvette, and grandmother, Shirley, both died of cancer during an eight-month span in 2015, when he was in eighth grade. He has worn the No. 5 basketball jersey since high school to honor them, as they both died on the fifth day of the month.[75] After their deaths, Edwards was raised by his sister, Antoinette, and brother, Antoine, who shared legal custody of him.[76] In high school, Edwards frequently worked as an instructor at youth camps.[77] He intended to major in marketing while attending the University of Georgia.[78] During his childhood, Edwards also starred in baseball, often acting as his team's fourth or fifth hitter in the batting order. He has jokingly said he was very skilled at a variety of sports when he was younger. He owns two dogs and has also expressed his affinity for lions, although he does not believe he has the requisite space to care for one.[79] Edwards made his acting debut in the 2022 sports drama film Hustle.[80] In September 2022, Edwards posted a video to Instagram story referring to a group of shirtless men standing on a sidewalk with a homophobic slur.[81] The NBA fined him $40,000 for using \"offensive and derogatory language.\"[82] In December 2023, Paige Jordae, an Instagram model, accused Edwards of impregnating her and then offering her $100,000 to get an abortion.[83] Jordae posted screenshots of text messages with Edwards.[84] The screenshots, which were initially posted to Jordae's Instagram story, also included a screenshot of a pending wire transfer of $100,000 on November 27, 2023.[85] Edwards responded, \"I am handling my personal matters privately and will not be commenting on them any further at this time.\"[86]",

                "content": "Anthony Charles Edwards (born July 19, 1962)[2] is an American actor, director, and producer.[3][4] He played Dr. Mark Greene on the first eight seasons of ER, for which he received a Golden Globe Award and six Screen Actors Guild Awards, and was nominated for four consecutive Primetime Emmy Awards. He has appeared in various films and television series, including Fast Times at Ridgemont High, Top Gun, Zodiac, Gotcha!, Miracle Mile, Revenge of the Nerds, Planes, Northern Exposure, and Designated Survivor. Edwards was born in Santa Barbara, California, the son of Erika Kem Edwards Plack (née Weber), an artist/landscape painter, and Peter Edwards, an architect to whom he was one of five children[5][6] His maternal grandfather was designer Kem Weber. He is partly of German and Irish descent. He received a scholarship to the Royal Academy of Dramatic Arts in England and studied theatre at the University of Southern California.[7] Edward's early film appearances included roles in Fast Times at Ridgemont High (1982), Revenge of the Nerds (1984), Gotcha! (1985) and The Sure Thing (1985). It was Edwards's role as LTJG Nick \"Goose\" Bradshaw alongside Tom Cruise in the 1986 film Top Gun that brought his first widespread public acknowledgement.[8] His character, who died in an aviation accident, was among the most prominent and popular in the film. Scenes with him and his film family (played by Meg Ryan and Aaron and Adam Weis) were later reprised as flashbacks in the 2022 sequel Top Gun: Maverick. Edwards's roles following Top Gun included Revenge of the Nerds II: Nerds in Paradise (1987), Miracle Mile (1988), Downtown (1990), Pet Sematary Two (1992) and The Client (1994). He also had a recurring role on the TV series Northern Exposure from 1992 to 1993. His best-known role is as Dr. Mark Greene on the long-running TV series ER, from the series premiere in 1994 to the end of the eighth season in 2002. The series also afforded Edwards his first opportunity to direct. Edwards's desire to pursue directing led to his request to be written out of the series. He reportedly earned $35 million for three seasons on ER, which made him one of television's highest-paid actors.[9] Edwards received four Primetime Emmy Award nominations for ER. He won a Golden Globe Award For Best Performance by an Actor-In a TV Series after being nominated four times and he has two Screen Actor's Guild Awards.[10] In 2008, Edwards returned to ER to reprise his role as Dr. Greene (in flashback scenes, where he treats the dying son of character Catherine Banfield) for one episode during its 15th and final season.[11] Following ER, he took some time to raise his children, appreciating the privilege that his ER salary provided.[12] His film appearances following ER included the science fiction film Thunderbirds (2004), the psychological thriller film The Forgotten (2004) and the crime thriller film Zodiac (2007). In 2010, Edwards appeared in the movie Motherhood, which set a record for the biggest bomb in British cinema history by garnering £88 on 11 tickets on opening weekend.[13] Motherhood did not fare much better in the United States, earning $93,388 in three weeks of release.[14] At the time, he said he took the role because \"it seemed like a very organic and real thing. It really kind of reminded me of what the dynamic in a family is like.\"[15] Edwards reunited with Val Kilmer, another actor from Top Gun, when he voiced one of the fighter jets in the Disneytoon Studios film Planes (2013).[16] In 2018, Edwards was cast in the recurring role in the third season of Netflix's Designated Survivor as Mars Harper, the President's Chief of Staff.[17] In 2020, he served as an executive producer of the film adaptation of Martin Moran's The Tricky Part.[4] In 2022, Edwards was cast as Alan Reed in Netflix's docu-series Inventing Anna.[1] Edwards received four Emmy nominations for Outstanding Lead Actor in a Drama Series for ER and won as an executive producer on Outstanding Television Movie winner Temple Grandin. He earned a People's Choice Award for Favorite Male Performer in a New Television Series (1995);[11] and won six Screen Actors Guild Awards for: Outstanding Performance by a Male Actor in a Drama Series (1996 and 1998), and Best Ensemble Cast (1996, 1997, 1998 and 1999). He won the Golden Globe Award for Best Performance by an Actor in a Television Drama in 1998).[11] Edwards also won a Daytime Emmy for the production of the underground rock documentary N.Y.H.C. (1999) and the telepic adaptation of Kimberly Willis Holt's 1998 coming of age novel My Louisiana Sky (2001),[18] and earned the Carnegie Medal Award for My Louisiana Sky (2003).[18] After a long career in television, Edwards made his Broadway debut as his second act in 2018 in the revival of Children of a Lesser God at Studio 54.[10][12][19] In 2015 he appeared in Classic Stage Company's A Month in the Country but his stage acting career began when he was growing up in Santa Barbara.[20][21] On May 13, 2022, Edwards made his unexpected Broadway musical debut when he appeared as Dr. Walker in the Broadway production of Girl from the North Country due to COVID-19 cases impacting the cast. The show also stars his wife, Mare Winningham.[22][23] Edwards is slated to appear in the 2024 Broadway production of Prayer for the French Republic by Joshua Harmon.[24] Edwards was married to Jeanine Lobell from 1994 to 2015. They have one son and three daughters.[1][20] At the end of 2021, Edwards and longtime friend and fellow actor Mare Winningham eloped.[1][25][26] On November 10, 2017, Edwards wrote an essay on Medium, in which he stated that producer and screenwriter Gary Goddard had befriended and for years sexually assaulted him and his friends, beginning when they were 12 years old.[27][28] Edwards has been a licensed private pilot since 2012.[29]",

Secure .gov websites use HTTPSA lock ( Lock Locked padlock icon ) or https:// means you’ve safely connected to the .gov website. Share sensitive information only on official, secure websites. What is Net Neutrality? Net Neutrality policies are a national standard by which we ensure that broadband internet service is treated as an essential service. It prohibits internet service providers from blocking, throttling, or engaging in paid prioritization of lawful content. By classifying broadband service as a “telecommunications” service under Title II of the law, the FCC restores its oversight of internet service outages, national security threats in broadband networks, and consumer protection and regains key tools to promote broadband deployment. The Way Forward FCC Chairwoman Jessica Rosenworcel is working to restore Net Neutrality as the national standard for broadband reliability, security, and consumer protection. The Chairwoman’s proposal would ensure that broadband services are treated as an essential resource deserving of FCC oversight under Title II authority. BROADBAND IS AN ESSENTIAL SERVICE While internet access has long been important to daily life, the COVID-19 pandemic and the rapid shift of work, education, and health care online demonstrated how essential broadband internet connections are for consumers’ participation in our society and economy. But even as our society has reconfigured itself to do so much online, our institutions have fallen behind. When Net Neutrality protections are not in place, there is no expert agency ensuring that the internet is fast, open, and fair. Since the birth of the modern internet in the 1990s, the Commission had played that role. OVERSIGHT OF OUTAGES When households and businesses lose internet service, they logically expect that the FCC might be able to help the restoration or at least have information about the outage. By restoring the FCC’s Title II authority over internet service providers, the FCC bolsters its authority to require these companies to address internet outages. Without such authority, the FCC cannot require companies to even report broadband outages, cannot collect outage data, and lacks the authority to consider ways that it can help protect against and recover from internet service outages. NATIONAL STANDARD The FCC would once again prevent broadband providers from blocking, slowing down, or creating pay-to-play internet fast lanes. NATIONAL SECURITY OF BROADBAND NETWORKS In this digital age, there are digital threats. Without broadband oversight, the FCC is unable to monitor and respond to such national security issues. For example, without reclassification, the FCC is limited in its authority to direct foreign-owned companies deemed to be national security threats to discontinue any domestic or international broadband services under Sec. 214 – as they have done with telephone services. In addition, without reclassification, the FCC has limited authority to incorporate updated cybersecurity standards into network policies. CONSUMER PROTECTION Net Neutrality protections would increase the tools the FCC has available to protect consumer data and respond to evolving consumer threats. Broadband providers could not sell your location data, among other sensitive information. And the FCC will be empowered to protect consumers from other harmful practices. “In the wake of the pandemic and the generational investment in internet access, we have a window to update our policies to make sure that the internet is not only open, but fast and fair, safe and secure. I am committed to seizing this opportunity. Now is the time for our rules of the road for internet service providers to reflect the reality that internet access is a necessity for daily life. Let’s get to it.” – FCC Chairwoman Jessica Rosenworcel What Is ‘Title II’ Authority Title II is the part of the Communications Act that gives the FCC clear authority to serve as a watchdog over the communications marketplace and look out for the public interest. Title II took on special importance in the Net Neutrality debate because the courts have ruled that the FCC has clear authority to enforce open internet policies if broadband internet is classified as a Title II “telecommunications” service.

                "title": "Net neutrality in the United States - Wikipedia",
                "content": "In the United States, net neutrality—the principle that Internet service providers (ISPs) should make no distinctions between different kinds of content on the Internet, and to not discriminate based on such distinctions—has been an issue of contention between end-users and ISPs since the 1990s.[1][2][3] With net neutrality, ISPs may not intentionally block, slow down, or charge different rates for specific online content.[4] Without net neutrality, ISPs may prioritize certain types of traffic, meter others, or potentially block specific types of content, while charging consumers different rates for that content.[5] A core issue to net neutrality is how ISPs should be classified under the Communications Act of 1934 as amended by the Telecommunications Act of 1996: as either Title I \"information services\" or Title II \"common carrier services\". The classification determines the Federal Communications Commission's (FCC) authority over ISPs: the FCC would have significant ability to regulate ISPs if classified as common carriers, but would have little control over them if classified as information services. Because the Communications Act has not been amended by Congress to account for ISPs, the FCC had taken the authority to designate how ISPs are classified, as affirmed by the Supreme Court in the case National Cable & Telecommunications Ass'n v. Brand X Internet Services (2005), in addition to choosing what regulations to set on common carriers. The five member FCC commission changes with each new administration, and no more than three members may be of the same political party, thus the FCC's attitudes and rule-making regarding net neutrality shifts relatively frequently through the 2020's. Prior FCC decisions on net neutrality had been upheld due to the Chevron deference principle, where the courts gave preference to administrative agencies' interpretation of applicable law. The Supreme Court case Loper Bright Enterprises v. Raimondo (2024) overturned the Chevron deference, and as a result, the Sixth Circuit ruled in 2025 that the FCC does not have the authority to classify ISPs as Title II services. As such, there is no current federal regulations requiring net neutrality, though some states are implementing their own versions of it. The ideas underlying net neutrality have a long pedigree in telecommunications practice and regulation. Services such as telegrams and the phone network (officially, the public switched telephone network or PSTN) have been considered common carriers under U.S. law since the Mann–Elkins Act of 1910, which means that they have been akin to public utilities and expressly forbidden to give preferential treatment. The Communications Act of 1934 created the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to regulate the industry and ensure fair pricing and access.[6] Different titles of the Act covered different modes of communication, but primary focus on the debate of net neutrality has been on Titles I and II. The Act distinguished between common carriers, who were bound under Title II of the Act, and other telecommunication systems of the time, covered broadly under Title I. Within Title II, common carriers such as the phone networks were to be regulated by the FCC as to assure reasonable pricing rates and non-discriminatory practices. Systems under Title I were left to be unregulated by the FCC. In the late 1980s the Internet became legally available for commercial use, and in the early years of public use of the Internet, this was its main use – public access was limited and largely reached through dial-up modems (as was the Bulletin board system dial-up culture that preceded it). The Internet was viewed more as a commercial service than a domestic and societal system. However, by the late 1990s and early 2000s, the Internet started to become common in households and wider society. Also in the 1980s, arguments about the public interest requirements of the telecommunications industry in the U.S. arose; whether companies involved in broadcasting were best viewed as community trustees, with obligations to society and consumers, or mere market participants with obligations only to their shareholders.[7] The legal debate about net neutrality regulations of the 2000s echoes this debate. By the 1990s, some U.S. politicians began to express concern over protecting the Internet: How can government ensure that the nascent Internet will permit everyone to be able to compete with everyone else for the opportunity to provide any service to all willing customers? Next, how can we ensure that this new marketplace reaches the entire nation? And then how can we ensure that it fulfills the enormous promise of education, economic growth, and job creation? The Communications Act of 1934 was amended with the Telecommunications Act of 1996, which besides other provisions, defined \"information services\" as \"the offering of a capability for generating, acquiring, storing, transforming, processing, retrieving, utilizing, or making available information via telecommunications\", and covered only under Title I unregulated by the FCC.[9] In the early 2000s, legal scholars such as Tim Wu and Lawrence Lessig raised the issue of neutrality in a series of academic papers addressing regulatory frameworks for packet networks. Wu is credited with introducing the term \"network neutrality\" in his 2003 paper \"Network Neutrality, Broadband Discrimination\".[10] Wu had found based on behaviors of broadband providers in the early 2000s that there could be potential for commercial interests to interfere with natural evolution of new innovations on the Internet, such as those using higher bandwidth like voice and video applications. Wu outlined the benefits and drawbacks of governmental regulation for net neutrality, writing \"Communications regulators over the next decade will spend increasing time on conflicts between the private interests of broadband providers and the public’s interest in a competitive innovation environment centered on the Internet.\"[11] Papers from Wu and others in the early 2000s sparked debate among academics in information technology and legal areas to device possible frameworks for net neutrality that could be applied within U.S. laws; these discussions paralleled similar concurrent ones in Europe, though due to its different governmental structure, took on different forms of implementation. Within the U.S., media and politicians learned of these regulatory suggestions, leading to the start of net neutrality principles within the government.[12][13] In the wake of the Telecommunications Act of 1996, the introduction of \"information services\" under Title I prompted many cable-based Internet access providers to urge the FCC to classify their services as Title I information services, rather than as cable providers under the Act's Title III which required them to provide open access to other service provides. The FCC took in comments, and after providing its initial findings in 2002, issued \"Inquiry Concerning High-Speed Access to the Internet over Cable and Other Facilities\" in which it had determined that cable ISPs were neither a telecommunications provider (under Title II) nor a cable provider (under Title III) but were solely an information service that fell under Title I and thus could operate unregulated by the FCC.[14] Several non-cable ISPs and other industry groups sued the FCC, challenging this ruling in multiple courts. The cases were consolidated to the Ninth Circuit. In May 2003, the Ninth Circuit vacated the FCC's ruling, stating that cable ISPs had a telecommunications function and thus should be regulated under Title II. The National Cable & Telecommunications Association challenged the ruling, and while the Ninth Circuit refused to rehear the case en banc, the Supreme Court agreed to hear the case. The Court announced its judgment in June 2005. The 6–3 decision reversed the Ninth Circuit's ruling, deeming that the FCC had properly defined cable ISPs as an information service. The majority opinion relied on the Chevron deference, a principle that the judicial body gives deference to an executive agency's interpretation of legislation outlining its granted powers as long as that interpretation is reasonable and consistent.[15] While the ruling was unfavorable for proponents of net neutrality, Brand X established that the FCC had powers to classify Internet services subject to their interpretation, which has played a key role in how net neutrality has since played out in the United States with changing administrations.[16] The majority opinion in Brand X was authored by Justice Clarence Thomas, who has subsequently stated that he regrets the decision, in his dissent to Baldwin v. United States.[17] In February 2004, then Federal Communications Commission Chairman Michael Powell announced a set of non-discrimination principles, which he called the principles of \"Preserving Network Freedom\", based on studies from Tim Wu and Phil Weiser and other academics from the previous years. Powell recognized that it was still early to have a clear picture of what government regulation should be for net neutrality, but agreed that based on practices of broadband operators of the past few years, it was necessary to establish what rights consumers should expect from broadband service. In a speech at the Silicon Flatirons Symposium, Powell encouraged ISPs to offer users these four freedoms:[18] In early 2005, in the Madison River case, the FCC for the first time showed the willingness to enforce its network neutrality principles by opening an investigation about Madison River Communications, a local telephone carrier that was blocking Vonage's voice over IP (VoIP) service in its digital subscriber line (DSL) offering to customers. At the time, while the FCC classified cable providers under Title I as an information provider (as per the Brand X case) and were unregulated, services such as DSL were still considered under Title II as a common carrier, and were bound by non-discriminatory regulation from the FCC.[19] Nevertheless, the FCC's investigation led to a settlement between the FCC and Madison River Communications before any further litigation occurred, with Madison River agreeing to stop blocking VoIP traffic and paying a $15,000 fine.[20] While the action did not set any precedent for the FCC's stance on net neutrality, the Madison River case was an indication the agency was willing to uphold Powell's principles.[21] Shortly after the case was settled, the FCC issued a new rule in 2005 to reclassified DSL as a Title I information service and allowing them to operate unregulated by the FCC.[22][19] In 2004, the court case USTA v. FCC voided the FCC's authority to enforce rules requiring telephone operators to unbundle certain parts of their networks at regulated prices. This caused the economic collapse of many competitive local exchange carriers (CLEC).[23] In the United States, broadband services were historically regulated differently according to the technology by which they were carried. While cable Internet has always been classified by the FCC as an information service free of most regulation, DSL was regulated as a telecommunications service. In 2005, the FCC reclassified Internet access across the phone network, including DSL, as \"information service\" relaxing the common carrier regulations and unbundling requirement.[24] During the FCC's hearing, the National Cable & Telecommunications Association urged the FCC to adopt the four criteria laid out in its 2005 Internet Policy Statement as the requisite openness. This made up a voluntary set of four net neutrality principles.[25] Implementation of the principles was not mandatory; that would require an FCC rule or federal law.[26] The modified principles were as follows:[27][28] In December 2006, the AT&T/Bell South merger agreement defined net neutrality as an agreement on the part of the broadband provider: \"not to provide or to sell to Internet content, application or service providers ... any service that privileges, degrades or prioritizes any (data) packet transmitted over AT&T/BellSouth's wireline broadband Internet access service based on its source, ownership or destination.\"[29] In 2007, Comcast, the largest cable company in the US, was found to be blocking or severely delaying BitTorrent uploads on their network using a technique which involved creating 'reset' packets (TCP RST) that appeared to come from the other party.[30] An August 2007 report by TorrentFreak (based on substantial nationwide research led by chief researcher Andrew Norton) noted that ISPs had been throttling BitTorrent traffic for almost two years, since 2005, but Comcast was completely blocking it in at least some cases.[31] This was later verified by both the EFF[32] and Associated Press.[33] On March 27, 2008, Comcast and BitTorrent reached an agreement to work together on network traffic where Comcast was to adopt a protocol-neutral stance \"as soon as the end of [2008]\", and explore ways to \"more effectively manage traffic on its network at peak times.\"[34] In December 2009, Comcast reached an out-of-court settlement of a class action lawsuit for US$16 million, admitting no wrongdoing[35] and amounting to no more than US$16 per affected account.[36] In August 2008, the FCC made its first Internet network management decision.[37] It voted 3-to-2 to uphold a complaint against Comcast ruling that it had illegally inhibited users of its high-speed Internet service from using file-sharing software because it throttled the bandwidth available to certain customers for video files to ensure that other customers had adequate bandwidth.[38][39] The FCC imposed no fine, but required Comcast to end such blocking in the year 2008, ordered Comcast to disclose the details of its network management practices within 30 days, submit a compliance plan for ending the offending practices by the end of the year, and disclose to the public the details of intended future practices. Then-FCC chairman Kevin J. Martin said the order was meant to set a precedent, that Internet providers and all communications companies could not prevent customers from using their networks the way they see fit, unless there is a good reason. In an interview Martin stated that \"We are preserving the open character of the Internet\" and \"We are saying that network operators can't block people from getting access to any content and any applications.\"[40] In two rulings, in April and June 2010 respectively, the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit ruled against the FCC; the April ruling denied to grant the FCC's request for a cease-and-desist order against Comcast related to BitTorrent transfers, while the June ruling vacated the FCC's order against Comcast. The U.S. Court of Appeals ruled that the FCC has no powers to regulate any Internet provider's network, or the management of its practices: \"[the FCC] 'has failed to tie its assertion' of regulatory authority to an actual law enacted by Congress\",[41][42] and that the FCC lacked the authority under Title I to force ISPs to keep their networks open, while employing reasonable network management practices, to all forms of legal content.[43] In wake of the rulings, the FCC stated it would continue its fight for net neutrality.[44] In February 2008, Kevin Martin, then Chairman of the Federal Communications Commission, said that he is \"ready, willing and able,\" to prevent broadband ISPs from unreasonably interfering with their subscribers' access to content on the internet.[45] In 2008, when the FCC auctioned off the 700 MHz block of wireless spectrum in anticipation of the DTV transition, Google promised to enter a bid of $4.6 billion, if the FCC required the winning licensee to adhere to four conditions:[46] These conditions were broadly similar to the FCC's Internet Policy Statement; FCC's applications and content were combined into a single bullet, and an extra bullet requiring wholesale access for third party providers was included. The FCC adopted only two of these four criteria for the auction, viz., open devices and open applications, and only applied these conditions to the nationwide C block portion of the band.[47] President Barack Obama's American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 called for an investment of $7.2 billion in broadband infrastructure and included an openness stipulation.[48] Towards the end of 2009, the FCC began drafting new rules that would include a series of proposals that would prevent telecommunications, cable and wireless companies from blocking certain information on the Internet.[49] FCC Chair Julius Genachowski proposed to add two rules to the current FCC policy statement in 2005, viz., the nondiscrimination principle that ISPs must not discriminate against any content or applications, and the transparency principle, requiring that ISPs disclose all their policies to customers. He argued that wireless should be subject to the same network neutrality as wireline providers.[50] In October 2009, the FCC gave notice of proposed rule making on net neutrality.[51] Following the ruling in Comcast v. FCC in March 2010, the FCC amended these rules to account for the court's decision. The FCC voted in December 2010 to approve the FCC Open Internet Order banning cable television and telephone service providers from preventing access to competitors or certain web sites. The order established six net \"neutrality principles\" that would apply to ISPs: The 2010 orders did not reclassify ISPs under Title II common carriers, leaving them unregulated by the FCC under Title I information services as a cumulative result of past FCC orders.[52] The measure was denounced by net neutrality advocates as a capitulation to telecommunication companies such as allowing them to discriminate on transmission speed for their profit, especially on mobile devices like the iPad, while pro-business advocates complained about any regulation of the Internet at all.[53][54][55] While the 2010 Open Internet Order was generally favorable to ISPs, the issuing of the neutrality principles that would still apply to Title I information services was criticized by some ISPs. Verizon Communications challenged the order at the D.C. Circuit court in early 2011, asserting that the FCC had overstepped its authority by applying principles to Title I information services. The D.C. Circuit ruled in January 2014 to vacate the blocking and discrimination principles from the 2010 Open Internet Order while upholding other parts. The decision determined that the FCC improperly relied on Section 706 of the amended Communications Act, which gives the FCC authority to incentivize the deployment of telecommunications services to all Americans including those in rural and low-income areas. The FCC had relied on Section 706's language that they had authority to \"promulgate rules governing broadband providers’ treatment of Internet traffic\" to apply these rules to Title I information services. The Court ruled that ISPs were still specifically treated as Title I information services by the FCC, and for the FCC to be able to regulate aspects like blocking or discrimination, they would specifically have to be cataloged as telecommunication common carriers under Title II. The court agreed that FCC can regulate broadband in a general manner and may craft more specific rules that stop short of identifying service providers as common carriers.[56][57][58] As a response to the DC Circuit Court's decision, a dispute developed as to whether net neutrality could be guaranteed under existing law, or if reclassification of ISPs was needed to ensure net neutrality.[59] Wheeler stated that the FCC had the authority under Section 706 of the Telecommunications Act of 1996 to regulate ISPs, while others, including President Obama,[60] supported reclassifying ISPs as common carriers under Title II of the Communications Act of 1934. Critics of Section 706 point out that the section has no clear mandate to guarantee equal access to content provided over the internet, while subsection 202(a) of the Communications Act states that common carriers cannot \"make any unjust or unreasonable discrimination in charges, practices, classifications, regulations, facilities, or services.\" Advocates of net neutrality have generally supported reclassifying ISPs under Title II, while FCC leadership and ISPs have generally opposed such reclassification. The FCC stated that if they reclassified ISPs as common carriers, the commission would selectively enforce Title II, so that only sections relating to broadband would apply to ISPs.[59] On February 19, 2014, the FCC announced plans to formulate new rules to resume enforcing net neutrality while complying with the court rulings.[62] However, in the event, on April 23, 2014, the FCC reported a new draft rule that would permit broadband ISPs such as Comcast and Verizon to offer content providers, such as Netflix, Disney, or Google, willing to pay a higher price, faster connection speeds, so their customers would have preferential access, thus reversing its earlier position and (so far as opinion outside the ISP sector generally agreed) would deny net neutrality.[63][64][65][66][67] Public response was heated, pointing out FCC chairman Tom Wheeler's past as a president and CEO of two major ISP-related organizations, and the suspicion of bias towards the profit-motives of ISPs as a result. Shortly afterwards, during late April 2014, the contours of a document leaked that indicated that the FCC under Wheeler would consider promulgating rules allowing Internet service providers (ISPs) to violate net neutrality principles by making it easier for Internet users to access certain content — whose owners paid fees to the ISPs (including cable companies and wireless ISPs) — and harder to access other content,[68] thus undermining the traditional open architecture of the Internet. These plans received substantial backlash from activists, the mainstream press, and some other FCC commissioners.[69][70] In May 2014, over 100 Internet companies — including Google, Microsoft, eBay, and Facebook — signed a letter to Wheeler voicing their disagreement with his plans, saying they represented a \"grave threat to the Internet\".[71] The FCC voted 3–2 on proposed rules to introduced tiered broadband allowances on May 15, 2014.[72] Besides opening these rules to public comment prior to issuing a final ruling, the FCC asked the public on their opinion in regards to classifying ISPs as Title II common carrier telecommunication services. The public commenting period ran through July 2014,[73][74] and garnering over one million responses, the most the FCC had ever received for rulemaking.[75] The FCC proposal for a tiered Internet received heavy criticism. Opponents argued that a user accessing content over the \"fast lane\" on the Internet would find the \"slow lane\" intolerable in comparison, greatly disadvantaging any content provider who is unable to pay for \"fast lane\" access. They argued that a tiered Internet would suppress new Internet innovations by increasing the barrier to entry. Video providers Netflix[76] and Vimeo[77] in their comments filed with the FCC used the research of S.S. Krishnan and Ramesh Sitaraman that provided quantitative evidence of the impact of Internet speed on online video users.[61] Their research studied the patience level of millions of Internet video users who waited for a slow-loading video to start playing. Users with faster Internet connectivity, such as fiber-to-the-home, demonstrated less patience and abandoned their videos sooner than similar users with slower Internet connectivity.[78][79][80] Opponents of the tiered broadband rules declared September 10, 2014, to be the \"Internet slowdown\". Participating websites were purposely slowed down to show what they felt would happen if the new rules took effect. Websites that participated in the Internet slowdown included Netflix,[81] Reddit, Tumblr, Twitter, Vimeo and Kickstarter.[82][83][84][85] The Economist described the \"Battle for the Net [...] now casting the upcoming FCC decision as an epic clash between \"Team Internet\" (a plucky band of high-tech multi-millionaires) and \"Team Cable\" (a dastardly bunch of Big-ISP billionaires).\"[86] On November 10, 2014, President Obama stepped in, and recommended the FCC reclassify broadband Internet service as a telecommunications service in order to preserve net neutrality.[87][88][89] Republicans presented legislation in January 2015 in the form of a U. S. Congress HR discussion draft bill that made concessions to net neutrality but prohibited the FCC from accomplishing that goal, or from enacting any further regulation affecting ISPs, though the bill failed to be enacted.[90][91] By January 2015, the FCC announced it had revised its prior rules and would be voting on a new preliminary ruling that defined ISPs as a Title II common carrier telecommunication service, with some necessary exemptions.[92][93][94][95][96] Adoption of this notion would reclassify Internet service from one of information to one of telecommunications,[97] treating it as a public good,[98][99] and ensure net neutrality, according to Wheeler.[100][101] Ahead of the FCC's vote on these new rules, social media platforms had a large role on engaging the public in the debate surrounding net neutrality. Popular websites such as Tumblr, Vimeo, and Reddit also participated in the Internet slowdown on September 10, 2014, which the organization said was the largest sustained (lasting more than a single day) online protest effort in history.[102] On January 26, 2015, popular blogging site Tumblr placed links to group Fight For The Future, a net neutrality advocacy group. The website displayed a countdown to the FCC vote on Title II on February 26, 2015. This was part of a widespread Internet campaign to sway congressional opinion and encourage users to call or submit comments to congressional representatives.[103] Net neutrality advocacy groups such as Save the Internet coalition[104] and Battle for the Net[105] responded to the 2015 FCC ruling by calling for defense of the new net neutrality rules.[104] The FCC voted 3–2 on February 25, 2015, to pass these new rules,[106][107][108][98][99] making exemptions for North Carolina and Tennessee where state laws had already established stronger net neutrality concepts, and would be willing to add exemptions for other states with similar laws.[109] In response to ISP and opponent views, Wheeler commented, \"This is no more a plan to regulate the Internet than the First Amendment is a plan to regulate free speech. They both stand for the same concept.\"[110] Full disclosure of the rules were released for public comment on March 12, 2015,[111][112][113] and the final rule was published on April 13, 2015.[114][115] Following the publication of the FCC's ruling in 2015, several internet providers filed suit to challenge the FCC's ruling. The cases were combined into a single case, United States Telecom Ass'n v. FCC 825 F.3d 674 (2016), heard by a three-judge panel on the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit in December 2015.[116] The court issued its decision in June 2016, with the panel split 2-1 in favor of maintaining the FCC's ruling, stating that the Internet should be treated as a utility and not as a luxury. Internet providers signaled their intent to continue to challenge this ruling to the Supreme Court.[117] Several of the telecom groups petitioned the Supreme Court for writ of certiorari following the Court of Appeals ruling, ultimately falling under the case name Berninger v. Federal Communications Commission (Docket 17-489). The petition argued that the FCC did not have the power to issue the Open Internet Order, which required a re-interpretation of the Communications Act of 1934, under the Chevron deference. On November 5, 2018, seven members of the Court denied the petition, leaving in place the Court of Appeals ruling, which established that the FCC had the ability to reclassify Internet under Title II. Chief Justice John Roberts abstained due to financial conflict, and Justice Brett Kavanaugh abstained due to his previous involvement with the case history. Three Justices, Clarence Thomas, Samuel Alito, and Neil Gorsuch had recommended accepting the petition as to order a Munsingwear vacatur, in which the Appeals Court order would have been vacated, returned to that court, and have the case rendered moot due to the more recent 2018 FCC order that reversed the Open Internet Order.[118][119] Donald Trump had been positioning himself for running for presidency as the FCC considered net neutrality and categorizing ISPs as Title II common carriers. He said in 2014, \"Obama’s attack on the internet is another top down power grab. Net neutrality is the Fairness Doctrine. Will target conservative media.\"[120][121] Shortly after his inauguration in January 2017, President Trump appointed Ajit Pai as the new chairman of the FCC. Pai had previously been nominated to fill one of the required Republican seats on the commission by President Obama under the recommendation of Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell.[122] Pai, who objected to the 2015 Open Internet Order, quickly began to roll back some of the policies that had been implemented by the FCC during the Obama administration, and halted an investigation into the use of zero-rating by U.S. wireless providers. After his appointment, Pai stated that he planned to \"modernize\" FCC policies to \"match the reality of the modern marketplace\", but was unsure over whether the FCC would continue to enforce the net neutrality rules or Title II classification of broadband services established in the 2015 Open Internet Order.[123][124] Pai stated his opposition to the current net neutrality rules as they were \"regulating against hypothetical harms\", rather than trying to correct actual anti-competitive behavior, and that there was no need for such wide-spread government intervention when there were only a few companies that may be harming consumers or innovators.[125] Pai argued that net neutrality rules also would \"prohibit a number of pro-competitive business arrangements\" and \"would reduce investments\" into extending the Internet infrastructure.[125] By April 2017, Pai had indicated that the FCC would likely propose to roll back the 2015 Open Internet Order, reverting the classification of ISPs as Title II common carriers, and instead have ISPs to \"voluntarily\" commit to net neutrality principles, with violations to be covered by the Federal Trade Commission rather than the FCC.[126][127] On April 29, 2017, a clearer understanding of the latest net neutrality compromise proposal was described.[128][129] On May 18, 2017, the FCC voted 2–1 to move forward with Pai's Notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM) on \"Restoring Internet freedom\" rules[130] by rolling back net neutrality regulations.[131] The new rules were published for public viewing on July 17, 2017.[132] The FCC supported their rules by arguing that the classification of ISPs as Title II carriers had caused them to reduce their capital expenditures in new infrastructure, threatening the future of the nation's telecommunication systems. The FCC cited a drop of approximately $1 billion in capital spending by telecoms between 2014 and 2015, based on data from the United States Telecom Association and similar figures from industry consultant Hal Singer,[133] to demonstrate this. Analysts stated that the FCC had cherry picked this data, as about 75% of the annual changes in capital spending by telecoms between the period of 1996 to 2015 were decreases of at least $1 billion.[134][135] In her dissent to this NPRM, FCC Commissioner Mignon Clyburn wrote, \"I have yet to see a credible analysis that suggests that broadband provider capital expenditures have declined as a result of our 2015 Open Internet Order. ... Using the same logic that the NPRM uses, one could suggest that the FCC's classification of cable modem service as an information service in 2002 resulted in an even more precipitous drop in broadband provider investment.”[136] Ernesto Falcon, Legislative Council for the Electronic Frontier Foundation[137] claimed that no such claims of CapEx reductions have been made in official reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC),[138] He said that major companies can be sued by investors who assert that they lost money because of misleading information in an SEC filing, and no such penalties apply to potentially misleading statements to Congress or the public.[138] Falcon's claim is supported by an analysis by Turner of Free Press in a report that includes 26 figures and tables, 21 of which were extracted from SEC filings and three of the remaining five came from the U.S. Census Bureau's Annual Capital Expenditures Survey.[139] The change since the Title II Order was negative for only 5 of Turner's 24 tables, and the mean and median change over the 24 tables for which it seemed reasonable to extract a typical annualized percentage change were 8.1% and 5.2%, respectively.[140] As required for any NPRM, a period for public commenting on the FCC's new proposed rules ran from May 18 to August 16, 2017. During the public commenting period, efforts were made by pro-net neutrality groups to get people to submit comments to the FCC in opposition to the new rules. John Oliver, the host of Last Week Tonight, encouraged his viewers to comment against the proposed FCC rules.[141] In early June 2017, Battle for the Net, a coalition spearheaded by Fight for the Future, Free Press Action Fund, and Demand Progress, announced a \"massive day of action\" for July 12.[142] Over 50,000 websites, including multinational corporations, participated in what Fight for the Future called \"the largest online protest in history\".[143] The FCC's open comment period on the proposed language of \"Restoring Internet Freedom\" received about 21.9 million comments, the largest influx of public comments seen by the FCC at that time;[144][145][146] previously the FCC had gotten about 500,000 comments related to new media ownership rules in 2003 and 1.4 million comments from the Super Bowl XXXVIII halftime show controversy in 2004.[147] As these comments were made available to the public, third-party groups began analyzing their contents, recognizing many comments that were against net neutrality shared the same language, and were considered to be duplicative. Analysis suggested that millions of these comments were fraudulent, using the same anti-net neutrality wording that had been proposed by the Center for Individual Freedom.[141][146] One of the first studies performed after the closure of the public commenting period, done on behalf of Broadband for America, which sought to repeal the Obama-era rules, found that 60% of the comments were in favor of retaining the current rules. However, the study also identified a large number of duplicate comments; if these were taken out, the unique comments favoring retaining the current rules far outweighed those seeking repeal, 1.52 million to 23,000.[147] During and after the public commenting period, analysts reviewed the public comments and observed that a significant proportion of those using boilerplate language in support of repealing the rules had used names and addresses off known spam databases, and of those who were willing and able to be contacts asserts they left no such comment for the FCC.[147] At least twenty-four people listed by the FCC as giving anti-net neutrality comments signed an open letter to the FCC in May 2017 requesting the comments they were asserted to have made to be removed from public record.[148] The FCC's system for public comments, the Electronic Comment Filing System (ECFS), came under scrutiny: it uses an open application programming interface (API), along keys to that provided by the FCC, to submit comments, making it exploitable for mass-messaging.[147] In December 2017, the Pew Research Center issued its report in reviewing the comments, affirming that most of them were boilerplate messages, but representative of a mass campaign attempting to sway public policy. The Pew report did recognize that several of the names were nonsensical, such as variations of \"John Smith\", or used \"The Internet\", and in other cases, thousands of messages were received at nearly the same time, potential evidence of a bot spamming in comments.[149] Another study evaluating all the comments submitted by the process was completed at Stanford University and published in October 2018. The Stanford study forced solely on unique comments, resulting in more than 800,000 comments that were called \"semantic outliers\" in contrast to boilerplate language, and in a detailed review of a sampling of one thousand of these, found that 99.7% favored retaining the Obama-era rules; these came from a geographically- and politically-diverse set of users.[150] Shortly after this study, New York State's Attorney General Barbara Underwood, one of the critics of the FCC's process, issued a subpoena to over a dozen advocacy groups on both sides of the net neutrality debate to determine if they had a role in the massive number of fraudulent comments left at the FCC's system.[151] Other states, as well as the Federal Bureau of Investigation, have issued similar subpoenas on the commenting period.[152] Both The New York Times and BuzzFeed had filed Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requests to the FCC to gain information on the IP addresses used in the public comment period. The FCC denied the requests in December 2018 citing that releasing this information would leave the US vulnerable to a cyberattack, and Pai wrote in an attached statement that at least 500,000 of the comments were tied to Russian addresses, interfering in the process and trying to swing the public opinion in favor of keeping the Obama-era net neutrality rules.[153] A separate FOIA request was made by The New York Times as well as the website Gizmodo for records pertaining to the API key logs from the ECFS, which were granted after journalists from the works filed suit against the FCC's initial denial.[154] Data analysis led by The New York Times and Gizmodo to review the logs against those of the duplicated comments. They concluded that the duplicated comments were coming from submissions through the API assigned to CQ Roll Call, which does offer advocacy software to clients for this purpose. Gizmodo found the comments tied to the name of those that had signed the May 2017 open letter to the FCC, matching this pattern. Separately, Gizmodo found the language of the duplicated comments shares many similarities with statements made by the Center for Individual Freedom (CFIF), which had been outspoken against net neutrality of the page. Due to these investigations, CQ Roll Call, CFIF, and several other advocacy groups with access to CQ Roll Call's had been called for questioning within the New York State case against the FCC.[148] In May 2020, Judge Lorna G. Schofield of the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York ruled that the FCC must provide The New York Times the IP addresses of all the comments from this commenting period. Judge Schofield stated that despite the FCC's claims of privacy issues, the request by the newspaper was valid to examine if any fraudulent activity interfered during the public commenting period towards the issue if the FCC's decision to repeal was \"vulnerable to corruption\".[155] The New York state attorney general's office reported in May 2021 that after evaluating the comments, they determined that about 18 million of the 21.9 million submitted were bogus. About 8.5 million of those comments were tied to co-registration promotions put forth by the telecom industry, promising consumers gift cards or entry into sweepstakes but then using their names and information to submit the comments without their knowledge. For this, the office had already reached settlement deals with three telecom companies for a total of $4 million in fines. Another 9.3 million of the comments considered bogus were in favor of net neutrality, according to the report, filed under false identities and many submitted by a single person.[156][157] The attorney general also obtained a total of US$650,000 from three influencer companies paid by the telecom industry that participated in the millions of fake responses.[158] Despite the ongoing analysis into fraudulent activities related to the public commenting period, and that the public comments that were deemed legitimate that weighed in favor of maintaining the 2015 Open Internet Order, the FCC announced in November 2017 that it was planning to go ahead with a final vote on December 14, 2017, to vote in the Restore Internet Freedom order and repeal the net neutrality rules.[159] FCC commissioner Jessica Rosenworcel alleged on December 8 that the FCC was withholding evidence of fraud due to irregularities in its comment period and said the vote should be postponed until after an appropriate investigation.[160] Many organizations involved in the July 12 Day of Action planned an online protest for December 12.[161] A vote was held on December 14, 2017, with a 3–2 party-line vote approving the repeal.[162][163] On January 4, 2018, the current version of \"Restoring Internet freedom\" was made public,[164] and was officially codified in the Federal Register on February 22, 2018,[165] with the rules taking effect on June 11, 2018.[166] The FCC voted along party lines, 3–2, on December 14, 2017, to enact the Restoring Internet freedom rules and repeal the 2015 Open Internet Order.[167] Within minutes after the FCC vote on December 14, 2017, New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman announced his intent to lead a multi-state lawsuit against the FCC to \"stop illegal rollback of net neutrality\".[168] Washington Attorney General Bob Ferguson also stated his intent to sue.[168] Twenty-two states and the District of Columbia, led by New York's Schneiderman, filed a formal suit in the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit against the FCC's ruling on January 16, 2018, calling it \"arbitrary, capricious, and an abuse of discretion\", and that the FCC mis-classified Internet access as a Title I service rather than Title II due to \"an erroneous and unreasonable interpretation\" of laws around communication services.[169] The initial filing was withdrawn in early February 2018 only due to the fact that the FCC's ruling had not yet been published within the Federal Register. Once the new FCC rules were published in February 2018, the states, District of Columbia, joined by the Mozilla Foundation and Vimeo, and several other state and local entities and advocacy groups, refiled the suit on February 22, 2018.[170] The cases were all consolidated under the title Mozilla v. FCC. The FCC issued its defense on October 12, 2018, requesting the Court to reject the lawsuit, as the lawsuit filed brings \"no substantial reason to second-guess the commission’s decision to eliminate rules that the agency has determined are both unlawful and unwise\".[171] Initial court hearings were held on February 1, 2019.[171] The FCC had requested a rescheduling of the hearings due to lack of resources created by the ongoing shutdown of the government,[172] but this request was denied by the D.C. District Court.[173] At the hearing before three judges, the states challenging the FCC not only discussed the issues related to net neutrality, but also charged the FCC with selectively reviewing the public comments to come to its decision, thus \"failed in its responsibility to engage in reasoned decision-making\".[174] ISPs argued the need to have an unregulated approach to providing high-quality services to their users, and that they would not be able to offer anything less than the full Internet to users given the competitive landscape.[174] The Court of Appeals issued its decision on October 1, 2019. In a multipart decision, the Court ruled that the FCC has the capability to reclassify Internet service under Title I based on the prior Brand X ruling from the Supreme Court, allowing its 2017 rule change to stand.[15] However, the opinion stated that the FCC had \"disregard of its duty\" in evaluating the impact of net neutrality on public safety, using the example of throttled communications that impacted the capabilities of first responders during the 2018 Camp Fire. The opinion also stated that the FCC had not addressed how these rules affected utility pole access or other programs like the low-income Lifeline program. The Court did rule against the FCC, vacating the rule's limitations against state-level actions to enforce net neutrality as Congress had not given the FCC any such authority via the Telecommunications Act.[175][176][177] While various parts in support of the plaintiffs requested an en banc hearing from the full Court of Appeals, the Court denied this in February 2020.[178] In January 2018, fifty United States senators endorsed legislative action under the Congressional Review Act (CRA) to reverse the repeal of Title II net neutrality.[179] While the effort was pushed by Democratic Senators, they had also gained support of three Republican Senators, Susan Collins, Lisa Murkowski, and John Kennedy.[180] The motion to restore net neutrality passed in the Senate on May 16, 2018.[181][182] However, efforts for the House of Representatives to pass similar legislative action through the CRA had stalled; Democratic Representatives had attempted to gain sufficient signatures for a discharge petition to force the vote on the matter, but by June 2018, were still 46 signatures short, principally along partisan lines.[183] While the revised FCC order repealing net neutrality has become official as of June 11, 2018, the House could have taken action to reverse the decision, but even with CRA passage, the action would have to be signed into law by the President.[184] However, the Congressional term ended before the House of Representatives could act, preventing the CRA challenge. While various states have enacted versions of net neutrality laws, these mostly have been working within the established parameters set by the FCC. In the FCC's rollback, the ruling includes language that asserts states do not have authority to override the FCC decision. Legal experts believe this clause to be flawed and would allow states to still override the FCC's decision on net neutrality, as the language divests the FCC from regulating broadband carriers, and thus would disallow them from preventing states from regulating them.[185] Following the FCC's revocation of all net neutrality protections, California State Senator Scott Wiener introduced SB822, which comprehensively restored all of the protections of the 2015 Open Internet Order. The bill passed with bi-partisan support in both the State Assembly and State Senate, and on September 30, 2018, Governor Jerry Brown signed it into law. On the same day as it was signed, the US Department of Justice sued the state of California to stop the law, arguing that Congress granted the FCC the sole authority to create rules for broadband internet providers.[186] A few days later, four lobbying groups that represent the major United States terrestrial and mobile communication carriers, United States Telecom Association, CTIA, NCTA and the American Cable Association, also sued the state of California for similar reasons as the Justice Department, claiming that the state does not have authority to regulate Internet providers.[187] The state and the FCC announced on October 26, 2018, that they have reached agreement for California to hold off the enforcement of the law until pending legal action over the FCC's decision. Despite not being enforced, the bill went into effect on January 1, 2019.[188] With the October 2019 decision in Mozilla v. FCC that overturned the 2017 Order's blanket ban on state net neutrality, the U.S. government and the ISP trade groups restarted their lawsuit in August 2020 and are seeking a preliminary injunction to block enforcement of California's law until the case is concluded.[189] However, following the election of Joe Biden as president in 2021, Biden's new Department of Justice withdrew from the challenge, leaving the ISP trade groups to continue the suit.[190] Subsequently, the judge denied the preliminary injunction in a ruling on February 23, 2021, allowing the California law to go into effect, on the basis that the ISP trade groups will be unlikely to prevail in the challenge.[191] The Ninth Circuit ruled unanimously in January 2022 that California's net neutrality law may continue to be enforced and cannot be overridden by the FCC as, current as of the decision, Internet services were classified as information services.[192] The trade groups abandoned the case against the law by May 2022.[193] Democratic Senators and Representatives presented the Save the Internet Act in both Houses of Congress in early March 2019. The Act, if passed, would rescind the 2017 FCC order to repeal the 2015 Open Internet Order, codify the 2015 Open Internet Order into law, and prevent the FCC from making any similar changes baring any further change in law. Republican lawmakers indicated they felt this was too extreme and were unlikely to give support to the bill.[194][195] The bill cleared the House on a 232–190 vote on April 10, 2019, but both leaders in the Republican-controlled Senate and then-president Trump indicated they would stop the bill's passage.[196] With Joe Biden becoming president in January 2021, Ajit Pai announced his departure from the FCC in the same month. Biden named Jessica Rosenworcel, an Obama-era appointee to the FCC, as acting chairperson. Rosenworcel was a vocal proponent for net neutrality in previous FCC rulings.[197] On July 9, 2021, Biden signed Executive Order 14036,[198] \"Promoting Competition in the American Economy\", a sweeping array of initiatives across the executive branch. Among them included instructions to the FCC to restore the net neutrality rules that had been undone during the Trump administration.[199] The resignation of Pai in January 2021 left the FCC at a two-two deadlock until September 2023, when Biden-nominated Anna M. Gomez was sworn in as the Commission's fifth member. Rosenworcel stated that month that the FCC plans to re-introduce net neutrality rules.[200] While it is expected for the FCC to rule to restore net neutrality, a white paper published by telecom legal experts in 2023 warned that the rule will likely face challenges in the Supreme Court under the major questions doctrine.[201] The FCC voted 3-2 on October 19, 2023, to approve issuing a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM) seeking comments about rolling back to the 2015 rules.[202] The commenting period was closed on January 18, 2024.[203] The FCC voted in these proposed guidelines on April 25, 2024, on a 3-2 vote, returning Internet services under Title II, enforcing net neutrality. [204] Providers under the NCTA filed suit to challenge the new rule in June 2024. Under the suit, the providers questioned whether the FCC has the authority to reclassify broadband services. While this had been settled by previous cases like Brand X[205] the Chevron deference central to these cases was overturned in June 2024 by Loper Bright Enterprises v. Raimondo, leaving in question the capability of the FCC to enforce its net neutrality decision[206] The Sixth Circuit granted a temporary injunction against the new net neutrality rules in July 2024, with a hearing to determine if a permanent injunction is necessary at an August hearing. [207] On extending the stay in August 2024, the majority of the Sixth Circuit stated that due to the flip-flopping on how the FCC has classified internet services, it will be highly unlikely for the FCC to prevail using the weaker Skidmore deference. [208] The Sixth issued its final decision in January 2025, ruling that, in the absence of Chevron the FCC's decision classifying internet service providers as a telecommunication service was inconsistent with the Telecommunications Act of 1998. The Sixth also ruled that under the statutory reading of Telecommunications Act of 1996, internet service provides should be treated as Title I information services, which would require an act of Congress to change. [209][210] With the election of Donald Trump for his second term as president starting in 2025, Rosenworcel will step down as chairperson of the FCC.[211] Trump plans to replace her with Brendan Carr, a sitting committee member, and is expected to name another Republican to fill Carr's position. Carr is a vocal opponent of net neutrality and supports aspects such as data caps, and believes that Internet service providers should be allowed to compete without regulation, differentiating their services to draw in customers.[212] Many broadband operators imposed various contractual limits on the activities of their subscribers. In the best known examples, Cox Cable disciplined users of virtual private networks (VPNs) and AT&T, as a cable operator, warned customers that using a Wi-Fi service for home networking constituted \"theft of service\" and a federal crime.[246] Comcast blocked ports of VPNs, forcing the state of Washington, for example, to contract with telecommunications providers to ensure that its employees had access to unimpeded broadband for remote work. Other broadband providers proposed to start charging service and content providers in return for higher levels of service (higher network priority, faster or more predictable), creating what is known as a tiered Internet.[247] In 2005, North Carolina ISP Madison River Communications blocked the voice-over-internet protocol (VOIP) service Vonage. The FCC issued a Letter of Inquiry to Madison River, initiating an investigation. To avoid litigation, Madison River agreed to make a voluntary payment of fifteen thousand dollars and agreed to not block ports used for VoIP applications or otherwise prevent customers from using VoIP applications.[248] According to the consent decree, \"The Parties agree that this Consent Decree does not constitute either an adjudication on the merits or a factual or legal finding regarding any compliance or noncompliance with the requirements of the Act and the Commission’s orders and rules. The Parties agree that this Consent Decree is for settlement purposes only.\" In September 2012, a group of public interest organizations such as Free Press, Public Knowledge and the New America Foundation's Open Technology Institute filed a complaint with the FCC that AT&T was violating net neutrality rules by restricting use of Apple's video-conferencing application FaceTime on cellular networks to those who have a shared data plan on AT&T, excluding those with older, unlimited or tiered data plans.[249] The FCC response noted that \"Although this report does not attempt to engage in any legal interpretations of the Open Internet Order, we do note that the Order treats these mobile broadband networks differently from traditional fixed networks. While both fixed and mobile broadband providers must disclose their management practices, mobile broadband providers have greater latitude for blocking devices and applications (as long as they do not compete with the provider's own voice or video telephony services) and discriminating in how they serve traffic, in accordance with reasonable network-management practices.\"[250] Arguments associated with net neutrality regulations came into prominence in mid-2002 with nine different bills introduced on this issue between 2006 and 2013. Industry officials say that these proposals would launch new rules and regulations for internet providers. On October 22, 2009, Sen. McCain (R-AZ) introduced the “Internet Freedom Act of 2009[251]” (S. 1836). The bill would prohibit the FCC from enacting rules that would regulate the Internet. In other words, the bill, if passed, would prevent the FCC from imposing network or “net” neutrality rules to the Internet. Specifically, the bill language states, “The FCC shall not propose, promulgate, or issue any regulations regarding the Internet or IP-enabled services. In other words, the bill, if passed, would prohibit the FCC from enacting rules that would regulate the Internet – or against net neutrality.[252] On January 5, 2011, two anti-net neutrality bills were introduced. The first bill was H.R. 96, The Internet Freedom Act,[253] introduced by Rep. Blackburn (R-TN), with more than sixty cosponsors (all of whom are Republican). H.R. 96 strikes down the FCC’s December 21 passage of its rule and order on net neutrality by asserting that regulation of the Internet is under the jurisdiction of Congress, not the FCC. The second bill, H.R. 166, The Internet Investment, Innovation, and Competition Preservation Act[254] – was introduced by Rep. Cliff Stearns (R-FL) and co-sponsored by Rep. Blackburn. The bill also seeks to prohibit the FCC from regulating the Internet or information services (i.e. imposing net neutrality rules) unless there is demonstrated market failure. On January 25, 2011, The pro-net neutrality bill – S. 74, The Internet Freedom, Broadband Promotion, and Consumer Protection Act of 2011 [255]– was introduced by Sen. Cantwell (D-WA) and co-sponsored by Sen. Franken (D-MN). The bill would codify the FCC's six net neutrality principles (which the ALA supported), outlined in a November 2009 FCC Notice of Proposed Rule Making (NPRM), among other things. There has been extensive debate about whether net neutrality should be required by law in the United States. Debate over the issue predates the coining of the term. Advocates of net neutrality have raised concerns about the ability of broadband providers to use their last mile infrastructure to block Internet applications and content (e.g. websites, services, and protocols), and even to block out competitors.[256] While opponents claim net neutrality regulations would deter investment into improving broadband infrastructure and try to fix something that isn't broken.[257][258] In 2014 Professor Susan Crawford, a legal and technology expert at Harvard Law School suggested that municipal broadband might be a possible solution to net neutrality concerns.[259] Organizations that support net neutrality come from widely varied political backgrounds and include groups such as Consumer Reports,[260] MoveOn.org, Free Press, Consumer Federation of America, AARP, American Library Association, Public Knowledge, the Media Access Project, the Christian Coalition, TechNet,[261][262][263] the American Civil Liberties Union, the Electronic Frontier Foundation, Greenpeace, Tumblr, Kickstarter, Vimeo, Wikia, Mozilla Foundation, NEA, and others.[264][265][266][267][268][269] Prominent supporters of net neutrality include Vinton Cerf, co-inventor of the Internet Protocol; Tim Berners-Lee, creator of the World Wide Web; law professor Tim Wu; Netflix CEO Reed Hastings; Tumblr founder David Karp; Free Press President Craig Aaron; and Last Week Tonight host John Oliver, who presented two full-length Last Week Tonight segments about the issue.[270][271][272][273][274] Other organizations that have voiced support for Net Neutrality are Facebook, Amazon, Microsoft, and Google. In December 2017 public opinion poll, 83% of voters supported keeping the rules on net neutrality, including 75% of Republican voters, 89% of Democratic voters, and 86% of independent voters.[275][276] Outside of the US, several countries have removed net neutrality protocols and have started double charging for delivering content (once to consumer and again to content providers). This equates to a toll being required for certain internet access, essentially limiting what is available to all people, in particular low income households.[277] Large, already well-established companies may not be harmed by cost increase that providers such as Comcast may levy upon them, but it may stifle small businesses and start-ups.[278] Sites such as Facebook, Google, and Amazon may not have been able to thrive absent net neutrality.[279] Barbara Stripling, the president of the American Library Association states: \"School, public and college libraries rely upon the public availability of open, affordable Internet access for school homework assignments, distance learning classes, e-government services, licensed databases, job-training videos, medical and scientific research, and many other essential services, we must ensure the same quality access to online educational content as to entertainment and other commercial offerings.\"[269] Previously existing FCC rules do not prevent telecommunications companies from charging fees to certain content providers in exchange for preferential treatment (the so-called \"fast lanes\"). Neutrality advocates Tim Wu and Lawrence Lessig have argued that the FCC does have regulatory power over the matter, following from the must-carry precedent set in the Supreme Court case Turner Broadcasting v. Federal Communications Commission.[280] Net neutrality proponents argue that telecom companies seek to impose a tiered service model in order to control the pipeline and thereby remove competition, create artificial scarcity, and oblige subscribers to buy their otherwise noncompetitive services.[264] Many believe net neutrality to be primarily important for the preservation of current internet freedoms; a lack of net neutrality would allow Internet service providers, such as Comcast, to extract payment from content providers like Netflix, and these charges would ultimately be passed on to consumers.[281][282] Civil rights organizations, such as the Color of Change, the National Hispanic Media Coalition, and more[283] argue that net neutrality is also important for communities of color because it allows for them to tell their own stories and “organize for racial and social justice.\"[284] Much of the mainstream media does not showcase these minority people, so these organizations believe that it is important to open the Internet into giving these people some sort of broadcast station. By doing so, their voices can be heard, because beforehand ISPs could “block unpopular speech and prevent dissident voices from speaking freely online.\"[284] In May 2014, some websites admitted to inserting code that slowed user access to their site from known FCC IP addresses, as a protest on the FCC's position on net neutrality.[285] On his show Last Week Tonight, Oliver took on the issue of net neutrality for the first time in 2014, in the show's first season. The episode went viral with 13 million views on YouTube[286] and prompted 45,000 comments on the FCC website.[287] At the 2016 Consumer Electronics Show, former FCC Chairman Tom Wheeler cited Oliver's episode as a turning point in the issue of net neutrality. “John Oliver took the ultimate arcane issue, Title II, and made it something that got people interested. And that’s good.”[288] Oliver returned to the issue of net neutrality on his May 7, 2017, episode in response to Chairman Pai's promise to get rid of the regulation. He prompted viewers to once again comment on the FCC website by buying the domain gofccyourself.com, which garnered 1.6 million contributions.[289] Some have referenced[290] the advance of Elon Musk's Starlink as something that could undercut the lobbying power of cable companies by offering internet access via satellite as opposed to traditional wired or wireless technologies. Some rural areas would have much less or no connectivity without net neutrality, making the use of farm software impracticable or impossible.[291] Individuals against net neutrality include former FCC Commissioner Ajit Pai,[292] Daniel Berninger and Jeff Pulver,[293][294] Marc Andreessen, Robert Kahn, Peter Thiel, MIT Media Lab founder Nicholas Negroponte, Internet engineer and former Chief Technologist for the FCC David Farber, and Nobel Prize economist Gary Becker.[295][296][297][298][299] Nonprofit organizations opposed to net neutrality include FreedomWorks,[300] the Reason Foundation,[301] and Citizens Against Government Waste.[302][303][304] Organizations and companies that oppose net neutrality regulations include several major technology hardware companies, cable and telecommunications companies, hundreds of small internet service providers, various think tanks, several civil rights groups, and others.[257][305][306][294][293][307] Companies such as Verizon, AT&T, and Comcast are some of the biggest opponents to net neutrality. In fact, since 2005 these companies have lobbied three times as much in opposition to net neutrality as the likes of Google and Microsoft have lobbied for it.[308] The statistics show that from 2005 to 2013, anti-neutrality companies filed 427 reports to lobby against net-neutrality, compared to just 176 reports filed by those for it.[308] Opponents argue that net neutrality would benefit industry lobbyists, and not consumers due to the potential of regulatory capture with policies that protect incumbent interests.[309] Former hedge fund manager turned journalist Andy Kessler has argued, the threat of eminent domain against the telecommunication providers, instead of new legislation, is the best approach by forcing competition and better services.[310] One print ad frames the Hands Off the Internet message in pro-consumer terms. \"Net neutrality means consumers will be stuck paying more for their Internet access to cover the big online companies' share,\" the ad claims.[311] In November 2005, Edward Whitacre Jr., then chief executive officer of SBC Communications, stated \"there's going to have to be some mechanism for these [Internet upstarts] who use these pipes to pay for the portion they're using\", and that \"The Internet can't be free in that sense, because we and the cable companies have made an investment,\"[312] sparking a furious debate. SBC spokesman Michael Balmoris said that Whitacre was misinterpreted and his comments only referred to new tiered services.[313] Net neutrality laws are generally opposed by the cable television and telephone industries.[314][315] Net neutrality opponents such as IBM, Intel, Juniper, Qualcomm, and Cisco claim that net neutrality would deter investment into broadband infrastructure, saying that \"shifting to Title II means that instead of billions of broadband investment driving other sectors of the economy forward, any reduction in this spending will stifle growth across the entire economy. Title II is going to lead to a slowdown, if not a hold, in broadband build out, because if you don’t know that you can recover on your investment, you won’t make it.\"[257][316] Others argue that the regulation is \"a solution that won’t work to a problem that simply doesn’t exist\".[317] Critics of net neutrality argue that data discrimination is desirable for reasons like guaranteeing quality of service. Bob Kahn, co-inventor of the Internet Protocol, called the term net neutrality a slogan and opposes establishing it, but he admits that he is against the fragmentation of the net whenever this becomes excluding to other participants.[295] Vint Cerf, Kahn's co-founder of the Internet Protocol, explains the confusion over their positions on net neutrality, \"There’s also some argument that says, well you have to treat every packet the same. That’s not what any of us said. Or you can’t charge more for more usage. We didn’t say that either.\"[318] An alternate position was proposed in 2010 by then-FCC Commissioner Julius Genachowski, which would narrowly reclassify Internet access as a telecommunication service under Title Two of the Communications Act of 1934. It would apply only six[319] common carrier rules under the legal principle of forbearance that would sufficiently prevent unreasonable discrimination and mandate reasonable net neutrality policies under the concept of common carriage. Incumbent ISP AT&T opposed the idea, saying that common carrier regulations would \"cram today's broadband Internet access providers into an ill-fitting 20th century regulatory silo,\" while Google supported the FCC proposal: \"In particular, the Third Way will promote legal certainty and regulatory predictability to spur investment, ensure that the Commission can fulfill the tremendous promise of the National Broadband Plan, and make it possible for the Commission to protect and serve all broadband users, including through meaningful enforcement.\"[320] In October 2014, after the initial proposal was shot down, the FCC began drafting a new proposal that would take a hybrid regulatory approach to the issue. Although this alternative has not yet been circulated, it is said to propose that there be a divide between \"wholesale\" and \"retail\" transactions.[321] In order to illustrate clear rules that are grounded by law, reclassification of Title II of the Communications Act of 1934 will be involved as well as parts of Section 706 of the Telecommunications Act of 1996. Data being sent between content provider and ISPs will involve stricter regulations compared to transactions between ISP's and consumers, which will involve more lax parameters. Restrictions on offering a data fast lane will be enforced between content providers and ISPs to avoid unfair advantages. This hybrid proposal has become the most popular solution among the three options that FCC has reported. However, ISPs, such as AT&T who has already warned the public via tweet \"any use of Title II would be problematic\", are expected to dispute this solution.[321] The official proposal was rumored to become public by the end of 2014.[322] In 2006 Bram Cohen, the creator of BitTorrent, said \"I most definitely do not want the Internet to become like television where there's actual censorship... however it is very difficult to actually create network neutrality laws which don't result in an absurdity, like making it so that ISPs can't drop spam or stop... attacks.\"[323] In June 2007, the US Federal Trade Commission (FTC) urged restraint with respect to new regulations proposed by net neutrality advocates, noting the \"broadband industry is a relatively young and evolving one,\" and given no \"significant market failure or demonstrated consumer harm from conduct by broadband providers\" such regulations \"may well have adverse effects on consumer welfare, despite the good intentions of their proponents.\"[324] The FTC conclusions were questioned in Congress in September 2007, when Sen. Byron Dorgan, D-N.D., chairman of the Senate interstate commerce, trade and tourism subcommittee, told FTC Chairwoman Deborah Platt Majoras that he feared new services as groundbreaking as Google could not get started in a system with price discrimination.[325] In 2011 Aparna Watal, a legal officer at an Internet company named Atomic Labs, has put forward three points for resisting any urge \"to react legislatively to the apparent regulatory crisis\".[326] Firstly, \"contrary to the general opinion, the Comcast decision does not uproot the Commission's authority to regulate ISPs. Section 201(b) of the Act, which was cited as an argument by the Commission but not addressed by the Court on procedural grounds, could grant the Commission authority to regulate broadband Internet services where they render \"charges, practices and regulations for, and in connection with\" common carrier services unjust and unreasonable.\"[326] Secondly, she suggests, it is \"undesirable and premature to legislatively mandate network neutrality or for the Commission to adopt a paternalistic approach on the issue ... [as] there have been few overt incidents to date, and the costs of those incidents to consumers have been limited.\"[326] She cites \"prompt media attention and public backlash\" as effective policing tools to prevent ISPs from throttling traffic. She suggests that it \"would be more prudent to consider introducing modest consumer protection rules, such as requiring ISPs to disclose their network management practices and to allow for consumers to switch ISPs inexpensively, rather than introducing network neutrality laws.\"[326] \"While by regulating broadband services the commission is not directly regulating content and applications on the Internet\", content will be affected by the reclassification. \"The different layers of the Internet work in tandem with each other such that there is no possibility of throttling or improving one layer's performance without impacting the other layers. ... To let the Commission regulate broadband pipelines connecting to the Internet and disregard that it indirectly involves regulating the data that runs through them will lead to a complex, overlapping, and fractured regulatory landscape in the years to come.\"[326] As of 2006 the debate over \"neutrality\" did not yet capture some dimensions of the topic; for example, whether voice packets should get higher priority than packets carrying email or whether emergency services, mission-critical, or life-saving applications, such as tele-medicine, should get priority over spam.[327] Cable companies have lobbied Congress for a federal preemption to ban states and municipalities from competing and thereby interfering with interstate commerce. However, there is current Supreme Court precedent for an exception to the Commerce Power of Congress for states as states going into business for their citizens.[328] In 2006 it was proposed that neither municipal wireless nor other technological solutions such as encryption, onion routing, or time-shifting DVR would be sufficient to render possible discrimination moot.[329] EPB, the municipal utility serving Chattanooga, Tennessee, petitioned the FCC to allow them to deliver internet to communities outside of the 600-square mile area that they service.[330] A similar petition was made by Wilson, North Carolina. According to FCC officials, some residents who lived just outside the service areas of the Chattanooga and Wilson utilities then had no broadband service available.[109] One of the two February 26, 2015, rulings set aside those states' restrictions on municipal broadband, although legal challenges to the FCC's authority to do so were seen as likely.[109] Individual states have taken action to generally uphold net neutrality either through proposed legislation or through by requiring state agencies to establish contracts with Internet providers that offer net neutral-services. The status as of February 26, 2018[update], of executive orders and pending action at state levels is summarized as follows:[331]",
