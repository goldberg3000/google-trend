                <h2 class="article-title">Den of Thieves 2: Pantera - Wikipedia</h2>
                <p class="article-content">"Den of Thieves 2: Pantera," also known as "Den of Thieves: Pantera," is an upcoming American action crime drama film directed and written by Christian Gudegast. It serves as a direct sequel to the 2018 film "Den of Thieves" and features returning stars Gerard Butler and O'Shea Jackson Jr., along with Meadow Williams. The film is set to be released in the United States on January 10, 2025, by Lionsgate.

The plot follows sheriff "Big Nick" O'Brien, portrayed by Butler, as he tracks down Donnie Wilson, played by Jackson Jr., who has fled to Europe and is planning another heist. The story is inspired by the infamous 2003 Antwerp diamond heist, according to Gudegast in an interview with Screen Rant.

Following the success of the first film, development for a sequel began, with plans for Gudegast, Butler, and Jackson Jr. to return. Principal photography took place from April to July 2023 in locations including the United Kingdom and the Canary Islands, where the production team made significant modifications to the local scenery to fit the film's narrative.

Initially, STX Entertainment was set to distribute the film, but in May 2023, Briarcliff Entertainment acquired the distribution rights for the U.S., with Sierra/Affinity managing international sales. However, in May 2024, Lionsgate took over distribution rights as part of their acquisition of Entertainment One, with the release date firmly set for January 10, 2025.

As of now, the film holds a 72% approval rating on Rotten Tomatoes based on 18 reviews, with an average rating of 6.10/10. It is expected to open alongside "Better Man" and is projected to earn between $11 million to $13 million from approximately 3,000 theaters during its opening weekend.</p>

                <h2 class="article-title">'Den Of Thieves 2: Pantera' Review: Gerard Butler Is Back In Action</h2>
                <p class="article-content">**Den of Thieves 2: Pantera** is the highly anticipated sequel to the 2018 action film *Den of Thieves*. Directed and written by Christian Gudegast, the film sees Gerard Butler return as Nick, alongside O’Shea Jackson Jr. reprising his role as Donnie. This time, the duo ventures to Europe for a daring heist at the World Diamond Center in Nice, where they aim to infiltrate a high-security vault filled with valuable jewels, including a coveted pink diamond linked to the Mafia.

The sequel shifts the setting from Los Angeles to picturesque European locales, offering a more international flavor to the storyline. The plot unfolds as Nick, seeking revenge after being outsmarted by Donnie in the first film, teams up with him and a crew of thieves known as the Panthers to pull off an audacious robbery. The film explores the murky lines between law enforcement and criminality, keeping audiences guessing about Nick's true intentions.

The heist itself serves as the film's centerpiece, packed with thrilling action sequences, including a notable car chase through the winding roads of the south of France. The film also features a subplot involving the Mafia, adding layers of tension to the narrative. 

Critics have noted that while the film follows familiar tropes of the heist genre, it benefits from its engaging performances, particularly by Butler and Jackson, as well as its stunning cinematography. The film's runtime of 2 hours and 24 minutes may feel lengthy, but it promises to be an entertaining escape from reality. 

**Den of Thieves 2: Pantera** is set to release on January 10, 2025, distributed by Lionsgate, and aims to deliver a mix of action, intrigue, and character dynamics that fans of the original film will appreciate.</p>
