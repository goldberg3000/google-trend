                "content": "The Association of Southeast Asian Nations,[d] commonly abbreviated as ASEAN,[e] is a political and economic union of 10 states in Southeast Asia. Together, its member states represent a population of more than 600 million people and land area of over 4.5 million km2 (1.7 million sq mi).[14] The bloc generated a purchasing power parity (PPP) gross domestic product (GDP) of around US$10.2 trillion in 2022, constituting approximately 6.5% of global GDP (PPP).[10] ASEAN member states include some of the fastest growing economies in the world, and the institution plays an integral role in East Asian regionalism.[15] The primary objectives of ASEAN, as stated by the association, are \"to accelerate economic growth, social progress and cultural development in the region\", and \"to promote regional peace and stability through abiding respect for justice and the rule of law in the relationship among countries in the region and adherence to the principles of the United Nations Charter.\"[16] In recent years, the bloc has broadened its objectives beyond economic and social spheres. ASEAN engages with other supranational entities in the Asia-Pacific region and other parts of the world. It is a major partner of the UN, SCO, PA, GCC, MERCOSUR, CELAC, and ECO.[17] It also hosts diplomatic missions throughout the world, maintaining a global network of relationships that is widely regarded as the central forum for cooperation in the region.[18] Its success has become the driving force of some of the largest trade blocs in history, including APEC and RCEP.[19][20][21][22] The predecessor of ASEAN was the Association of Southeast Asia (ASA), formed on 31 July 1961 and consisting of Thailand, the Philippines, and Malaya.[23][24] ASEAN itself was created on 8 August 1967, when the foreign ministers of five countries—Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore, and Thailand—signed the ASEAN Declaration.[25] According to the Declaration, ASEAN aims to accelerate economic, social, and cultural development in the region, as well as promoting regional peace, to collaborate on matters of shared interest, and to promote Southeast Asian studies and maintain close cooperation with existing international organisations.[26][27] The creation of ASEAN was initially motivated by the desire to contain communism,[28][29] which had taken a foothold in mainland Asia after World War II, with the formation of communist governments in North Korea, China, and Vietnam, accompanied by the so-called communist \"emergency\" in British Malaya, and unrest in the recently decolonized Philippines. These events also encouraged the earlier formation of the South East Asia Treaty Organization (SEATO), led by the United States, United Kingdom, and Australia, with several Southeast Asian partners in 1954 as an extension of \"containment\" policy, seeking to create an Eastern version of NATO.[30] However, the local member states of ASEAN group achieved greater cohesion in the mid-1970s following a change in the balance of power after the Fall of Saigon and the end of the Vietnam War in April 1975 and the decline of SEATO.[31][32] ASEAN's first summit meeting, held in Bali, Indonesia, in 1976, resulted in an agreement on several industrial projects and the signing of a Treaty of Amity and Cooperation, and a Declaration of Concord. The end of the Cold War allowed ASEAN countries to exercise greater political independence in the region, and in the 1990s, ASEAN emerged as a leading voice on regional trade and security issues.[33] On 15 December 1995, the Southeast Asian Nuclear-Weapon-Free Zone Treaty was signed to turn Southeast Asia into a nuclear-weapon-free zone. The treaty took effect on 28 March 1997 after all but one of the member states had ratified it. It became fully effective on 21 June 2001 after the Philippines ratified it, effectively banning all nuclear weapons in the region.[34] On 7 January 1984, Brunei became ASEAN's sixth member[35] and on 28 July 1995, following the end of the Cold War, Vietnam joined as the seventh member.[36] Laos and Myanmar (formerly Burma) joined two years later on 23 July 1997.[37] Cambodia was to join at the same time as Laos and Myanmar, but a Cambodian coup in 1997 and other internal instability delayed its entry.[38] It then joined on 30 April 1999 following the stabilization of its government.[37][39] In 2006, ASEAN was given observer status at the United Nations General Assembly.[40] In response, the organization awarded the status of \"dialogue partner\" to the UN.[41] Besides their close geographic proximity, political scholars consider Southeast Asian nations a cultural crossroads between East Asia and South Asia, located at critical junctions of the South China Sea as well as the Indian Ocean, and as a result received much influence from Islamic and Persian influences prior to the European colonial ages.[42][43] Since around 100 BCE, the Southeast Asian archipelago occupied a central position at the crossroads of the Indian Ocean and the South China Sea trading routes, which stimulated the economy and the influx of ideas.[44] This included the introduction of abugida scripts to Southeast Asia as well as the Chinese script to Vietnam. Besides various indigenous scripts, various abugida Brahmic scripts were widespread in both continental and insular Southeast Asia. Historically, scripts such as Pallava, Kawi (from ancient Tamil script) and Rencong or Surat Ulu were used to write Old Malay, until they were replaced by Jawi during Islamic missionary missions in the Malay Archipelago.[45] European colonialism influenced most ASEAN countries, including French Indochina (present-day Vietnam, Laos & Cambodia), British Burma, Malaya and Borneo (present-day Myanmar, Malaysia & Singapore, and Brunei), Dutch East Indies (present day Indonesia), Spanish East Indies (present-day Philippines and various other colonies), and Portuguese Timor (present-day Timor-Leste), with only Thailand (then Siam) not formed from a prior European colony.[46] Siam served as a convenient buffer state, sandwiched between British Burma and French Indochina, but its kings had to contend with unequal treaties as well as British and French political interference and territorial losses after the Franco-Siamese conflict of 1893 and the Anglo-Siamese Treaty of 1909.[47] Under European colonization, Southeast Asian nations were introduced to European religions and technologies, as well as the Latin alphabet. The Japanese Empire, in the vein of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere concept, sought to unite and create a pan-Asian identity against Western colonial occupation, but Japan's alliance with the Axis powers in World War II soured relations between many colonies of Europe and the United States.[citation needed] Defeat of Imperial Japan eventuated in decolonization movements throughout Southeast Asia, resulting in the independent ASEAN states of today. On 15 December 2008, the member states met in Jakarta to launch the charter signed in November 2007, to move closer to \"an EU-style community\".[48] The charter formally established ASEAN as a legal entity, aiming to create a single trade bloc for a region encompassing 500 million people. Indonesian president Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono stated: \"This is a momentous development when ASEAN is consolidating, integrating, and transforming itself into a community. It is achieved while ASEAN seeks a more vigorous role in Asian and global affairs at a time when the international system is experiencing a seismic shift\". Referring to climate change and economic upheaval, he concluded: \"Southeast Asia is no longer the bitterly divided, war-torn region it was in the 1960s and 1970s\". The financial crisis of 2007–2008 was seen as a threat to the charter's goals,[49] and also set forth the idea of a proposed human rights body to be discussed at a future summit in February 2009. This proposition caused controversy, as the body would not have the power to impose sanctions or punish countries which violated citizens' rights and would, therefore, be limited in effectiveness.[50] The body was established later in 2009 as the ASEAN Intergovernmental Commission on Human Rights (AICHR). In November 2012, the commission adopted the ASEAN Human Rights Declaration.[51] However, their human rights declaration has been critiqued widely by the international community, with the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights stating that the declaration was worded in problematic ways that do not easily align with international norms. Likewise, the Human Rights Watch in the United States noted several important fundamental rights were omitted or not clearly established.[52] The chairmanship of ASEAN rotates among the member states. Malaysia holds the position for 2025. Recent ASEAN chairs are as follows:[53] In response to pandemics, ASEAN has coordinated with ASEAN+3 and other actors to create a regional public health response.[54] During the SARS outbreak, ASEAN and ASEAN+3 worked together to devise a response to the outbreak. Immediate and short-to-medium term measures were devised. The parties agreed to enhance sharing of best practices against the disease while also agreeing to bolster collaboration between their respective health authorities and harmonize travel procedures to ensure that proper health screening would occur. In addition, China offered to contribute $1.2 million to the ASEAN SARS fund, made both to show that it was willing to cooperate with the rest of the region and make amends for its withholding of information during the initial stages of the outbreak.[55] ASEAN held a special meeting between ASEAN and ASEAN+3 health ministers on 8 May 2009, on responding to the H1N1 pandemic.[56] At this meeting, it was agreed that hotlines would be established between public health authorities, joint response teams would be formed, and ongoing research efforts would be bolstered. Since 2017, political, military and ethnic affairs in Myanmar have posed unusual challenges for ASEAN, creating precedent-breaking situations and threatening the traditions and unity of the group, and its global standing[57][58][59][60][61]—with ASEAN responses indicating possible fundamental change in the nature of the organization.[62][63][64][65][66] The Rohingya genocide erupting in Myanmar in August 2017—killing thousands of Rohingya people in Myanmar,[67][68][69] driving most into neighboring Bangladesh, and continuing for months[70][71][72][73]—created a global outcry demanding ASEAN take action against the civilian-military coalition government of Myanmar, which had long discriminated against the Rohingya, and had launched the 2017 attacks upon them.[62][74][75][76][77] On 1 February 2021, the day before a newly elected slate of civilian leaders was to take office in Myanmar, a military junta overthrew Myanmar's civilian government in a coup d'etat, declaring a national state of emergency, imposing martial law, arresting elected civilian leaders, violently clamping down on dissent, and replacing civilian government with the military's appointees.[78][79][80][81] Widespread protests and resistance erupted, and elements of the civilian leadership formed an underground \"National Unity Government\" (NUG). Global opposition to the coup emerged, and global pressure was brought on ASEAN to take action.[82][83][81][84][85] There are currently two states seeking accession to ASEAN: East Timor[87] and Papua New Guinea.[88][89] As of 1 July 2019[update], the population of the ASEAN was about 655 million people (8.5% of the world population).[91][92][needs update] In ASEAN in 2019, 55.2 million children were age 0–4 and 46.3 million people were older than 65. This corresponds to 8.4% and 7.1% of the total ASEAN population. The region's population growth is 1.1% per year. Thailand is the lowest at 0.2% per year, and Cambodia is the highest at 1.9% per year. ASEAN's sex ratio is 0.996 males per female, with 326.4 million males and 327.8 million females.[citation needed] The 20 largest metropolitan areas within ASEAN are as follows. The \"ASEAN Way\" refers to a methodology or approach to solving issues that respect Southeast Asia's cultural norms. Masilamani and Peterson summarise it as \"a working process or style that is informal and personal. Policymakers constantly utilise compromise, consensus, and consultation in the informal decision-making process... it above all prioritises a consensus-based, non-conflictual way of addressing problems. Quiet diplomacy allows ASEAN leaders to communicate without bringing the discussions into the public view. Members avoid the embarrassment that may lead to further conflict.\"[102] It has been said that the merits of the ASEAN Way might \"be usefully applied to global conflict management\". However, critics have argued that such an approach can be only applied to Asian countries, to specific cultural norms and understandings notably, due to a difference in mindset and level of tension.[103]: pp113-118 Critics object, claiming that the ASEAN Way's emphasis on consultation, consensus, and non-interference forces the organization to adopt only those policies which satisfy the lowest common denominator. Decision-making by consensus requires members to see eye-to-eye before ASEAN can move forward on an issue. Members may not have a common conception of the meaning of the ASEAN Way. Myanmar, Cambodia, and Laos emphasize non-interference while older member countries focus on co-operation and co-ordination. These differences hinder efforts to find common solutions to particular issues, but also make it difficult to determine when collective action is appropriate in a given situation.[104]: 161–163 Beginning in 1997, heads of each member state adopted the ASEAN Vision 2020 during the group's 30th anniversary meeting held in Kuala Lumpur. As a means for the realization of a single ASEAN community, this vision provides provisions on peace and stability, a nuclear-free region, closer economic integration, human development, sustainable development, cultural heritage, being a drug-free region, environment among others. The vision also aimed to \"see an outward-looking ASEAN playing a pivotal role in the international fora, and advancing ASEAN's common interests\".[105][106] ASEAN Vision 2020 was formalized and made comprehensive through the Bali Concord II in 2003. Three major pillars of a single ASEAN community were established: Political-Security Community (APSC), Economic Community (AEC) and Socio-Cultural Community (ASCC).[107][108][109][110][111] To fully embody the three pillars as part of the 2015 integration, blueprints for APSC and ASCC were subsequently adopted in 2009 in Cha-am, Thailand.[112] The ASEAN Community, initially planned to commence by 2020, was accelerated to begin by 31 December 2015.[113] It was decided during the 12th ASEAN Summit in Cebu in 2007.[114] The AEC aims to \"implement economic integration initiatives\" to create a single market for member states.[115][116] The blueprint that serves as a comprehensive guide for the establishment of the community was adopted on 20 November 2007 at the 13th ASEAN Summit in Singapore.[115][117] Its characteristics include a single market and production base, a highly competitive economic region, a region of fair economic development, and a region fully integrated into the global economy. The areas of cooperation include human resources development, recognition of professional qualifications, closer consultation economic policies, enhanced infrastructure and communications connectivity, integrating industries for regional sourcing, and strengthening private sector involvement. Through the free movement of skilled labor, goods, services and investment, ASEAN would rise globally as one market, thus increasing its competitiveness and opportunities for development.[118] During the 14th ASEAN Summit, the group adopted the APSC Blueprint.[119] This document is aimed at creating a robust political-security environment within ASEAN, with programs and activities outlined to establish the APSC by 2016. It is based on the ASEAN Charter, the ASEAN Security Community Plan of Action, and the Vientiane Action Program. The APSC aims to create a sense of responsibility toward comprehensive security and a dynamic, outward-looking region in an increasingly integrated and interdependent world. The ASEAN Defense Industry Collaboration (ADIC) was proposed at the 4th ASEAN Defense Ministers' Meeting (ADMM) on 11 May 2010 in Hanoi.[120] It has the purpose, among others, to reduce defense imports from non-ASEAN countries by half and to further develop the defense industry in the region.[121] It was formally adopted on the next ADMM on 19 May 2011, in Jakarta, Indonesia.[122] The main focus is to industrially and technologically boost the security capability of ASEAN,[123][124] consistent with the principles of flexibility and non-binding and voluntary participation among the member states.[125][126] The concept revolves around education and capability-building programs to develop the skills and capabilities of the workforce, production of capital for defense products, and the provision of numerous services to address the security needs of each member state. It also aims to develop an intra-ASEAN defense trade.[120] ADIC aims to establish a strong defense industry relying on the local capabilities of each member state and limit annual procurement from external original equipment manufacturers (OEMs).[120] Countries like the US, Germany, Russia, France, Italy, UK, China, South Korea, Israel, and the Netherlands are among the major suppliers to ASEAN.[127] ASEAN defense budget rose by 147% from 2004 to 2013 and is expected to rise further in the future.[128] Factors affecting the increase include economic growth, ageing equipment, and the plan to strengthen the establishment of the defense industry.[129] ASEANAPOL is also established to enhance cooperation on law enforcement and crime control among police forces of member states.[130] The ASEAN Socio-Cultural Community (ASCC) was also adopted during the 14th ASEAN Summit.[131] It envisions an \"ASEAN Community that is people-centered and socially responsible with a view to achieving enduring solidarity and unity among the countries and peoples of ASEAN by forging a common identity and building a caring and sharing society which is inclusive and harmonious where the well-being, livelihood, and welfare of the peoples are enhanced\". Among its focus areas include human development, social welfare and protection, social justice and rights, environmental sustainability, building the ASEAN identity, and narrowing the development gap. To track the progress of the AEC, a compliance tool called the AEC Scorecard was developed based on the EU Internal Market Scorecard.[132] It is the only one in effect[133] and is expected to serve as an unbiased assessment tool to measure the extent of integration and the economic health of the region. It is expected to provide relevant information about regional priorities, and thus foster productive, inclusive, and sustainable growth.[134] It makes it possible to monitor the implementation of ASEAN agreements, and the achievement of milestones indicated in the AEC Strategic Schedule. The scorecard outlines specific actions that must be undertaken collectively and individually to establish AEC by 2015.[134] To date, two official scorecards have been published, one in 2010,[135] and the other in 2012.[136][132] However, the scorecard is purely quantitative, as it only examines whether a member state has performed the AEC task or not. The more \"yes\" answers, the higher the score.[133] Part of the work towards the ASEAN Economic Community is the integration of the energy systems of the ASEAN member states. The blueprint for this integration is provided by the ASEAN Plan of Action for Energy Cooperation (APAEC).[137] APAEC is managed by the ASEAN Center for Energy. As trade is liberalized with the integration in 2015, the need arises for ASEAN banking institutions to accommodate and expand their services to an intra-ASEAN market. Experts, however, have already forecast a shaky economic transition, especially for smaller players in the banking and financial services industry. Two separate reports by Standard & Poor's (S&P) outline the challenges that ASEAN financial institutions face as they prepare for the 2020 banking integration.[f] The reports point out that overcrowded banking sector in the Philippines is expected to feel the most pressure as the integration welcomes tighter competition with bigger and more established foreign banks.[138] As a result, there needs to be a regional expansion by countries with a small banking sector to lessen the impact of the post-integration environment. In a follow-up report, S&P recently cited the Philippines for \"shoring up its network bases and building up capital ahead of the banking integration – playing defense and strengthening their domestic networks\".[138] The roadmap for financial integration is the latest regional initiative that aims to strengthen local self-help and support mechanisms. The roadmap's implementation would contribute to the realization of the AEC. Adoption of a common currency, when conditions are ripe, could be the final stage of the AEC. The roadmap identifies approaches and milestones in capital market development, capital account and financial services liberalization, and ASEAN currency cooperation. Capital market development entails promoting institutional capacity as well as the facilitation of greater cross-border collaboration, linkages, and harmonization between capital markets. Orderly capital account liberalization would be promoted with adequate safeguards against volatility and systemic risks. To expedite the process of financial services liberalization, ASEAN has agreed on a positive list modality and adopted milestones to facilitate negotiations. Currency cooperation would involve the exploration of possible currency arrangements, including an ASEAN currency payment system for trade in local goods to reduce the demand for US dollars and to help promote stability of regional currencies, such as by settling intra-ASEAN trade using regional currencies.[139] Member states recognize the importance of strengthening food security to maintain stability and prosperity in the region.[140] As ASEAN moves towards AEC and beyond, food security would be an integral part of the community-building agenda.[141] Strengthened food security is even more relevant in light of potentially severe risks from climate change with agriculture and fisheries being the most affected industries.[142] Part of the aim of ASEAN integration is to achieve food security collectively via trade in rice and maize. Trade facilitation measures and the harmonization/equivalency of food regulation and control standards would reduce the cost of trade in food products. While specialization and revealed comparative and competitive indices point to complementarities between trade patterns among the member states, intra-ASEAN trade in agriculture is quite small, something that integration could address.[143] The MARKET project would provide flexible and demand-driven support to the ASEAN Secretariat while bringing more private-sector and civil-society input into regional agriculture policy dialogue. By building an environment that reduces barriers to trade, ASEAN trade would increase, thereby decreasing the risk of food price crisis.[144] The group sought economic integration by creating the AEC by the end of 2015 that established a single market.[146] The average economic growth of member states from 1989 to 2009 was between 3.8% and 7%. This was greater than the average growth of APEC, which was 2.8%.[147] The ASEAN Free Trade Area (AFTA), established on 28 January 1992,[148] includes a Common Effective Preferential Tariff (CEPT) to promote the free flow of goods between member states.[146] ASEAN had only six members when it was signed. The new member states (Vietnam, Laos, Myanmar, and Cambodia) have not fully met AFTA's obligations, but are officially considered part of the agreement as they were required to sign it upon entry into ASEAN, and were given longer time frames to meet AFTA's tariff reduction obligations.[149] The next steps are to create a single market and production base, a competitive economic region, a region of equitable economic development, and a region that is fully integrated into the global economy. Since 2007, ASEAN countries have gradually lowered their import duties to member states, with a target of zero import duties by 2016.[150] ASEAN countries have many economic zones (industrial parks, eco-industrial parks, special economic zones, technology parks, and innovation districts) (see reference for comprehensive list from 2015).[151] In 2018, eight of the ASEAN members are among the world's outperforming economies, with positive long-term prospect for the region.[152] ASEAN's Secretariat projects that the regional body will grow to become the world's fourth largest economy by 2030.[153] The ASEAN Centre for Energy publishes the ASEAN Energy Outlook every five years, analysing and promoting the integration of national energy systems across the region. The sixth edition was published in 2020.[154] ASEAN planned to establish a single market based upon the four freedoms by the end of 2015, with the goal of ensuring free flow of goods, services, skilled labour, and capital. The ASEAN Economic Community was formed in 2015,[155] but the group deferred about 20% of the harmonization provisions needed to create a common market and set a new deadline of 2025.[156] Until the end of 2010, intra-ASEAN trade was still low as trade involved mainly exports to countries outside the region, with the exception of Laos and Myanmar, whose foreign trade was ASEAN-oriented.[157] In 2009, realised foreign direct investment (FDI) was US$37.9 billion and increased two-fold in 2010 to US$75.8 billion. 22% of FDI came from the European Union, followed by ASEAN countries (16%), and by Japan and the United States. The ASEAN Framework Agreement on Trade in Services (AFAS) was adopted at the ASEAN Summit in Bangkok in December 1995.[158] Under the agreement, member states enter into successive rounds of negotiations to liberalise trade in services with the aim of submitting increasingly higher levels of commitment. ASEAN has concluded seven packages of commitments under AFAS.[159] Mutual Recognition Agreements (MRAs) have been agreed upon by ASEAN for eight professions: physicians, dentists, nurses, architects, engineers, accountants, surveyors, and tourism professionals. Individuals in these professions will be free to work in any ASEAN states effective 31 December 2015.[160][161][162] In addition, six member states (Malaysia, Vietnam (2 exchanges), Indonesia, Philippines, Thailand, and Singapore) have collaborated on integrating their stock exchanges, which includes 70% of its transaction values with the goal to compete with international exchanges.[163] Single market will also include the ASEAN Single Aviation Market (ASEAN-SAM), the region's aviation policy geared towards the development of a unified and single aviation market in Southeast Asia. It was proposed by the ASEAN Air Transport Working Group, supported by the ASEAN Senior Transport Officials Meeting, and endorsed by the ASEAN Transport Ministers.[164] It is expected to liberalise air travel between member states allowing ASEAN airlines to benefit directly from the growth in air travel, and also free up tourism, trade, investment, and service flows.[164][165] Since 1 December 2008, restrictions on the third and fourth freedoms of the air between capital cities of member states for air passenger services have been removed,[166] while from 1 January 2009, full liberalisation of air freight services in the region took effect.[164][165] On 1 January 2011, full liberalisation on fifth freedom traffic rights between all capital cities took effect.[167] This policy supersedes existing unilateral, bilateral, and multilateral air services agreements among member states which are inconsistent with its provisions. The concept of an Asian Currency Unit (ACU) started in the middle of the 1990s, prior to the 1997 Asian financial crisis.[168] It is a proposed basket of Asian currencies, similar to the European Currency Unit, which was the precursor of the Euro. The Asian Development Bank is responsible for exploring the feasibility and construction of the basket.[168][169] Since the ACU is being considered to be a precursor to a common currency, it has a dynamic outlook of the region.[clarification needed][170] The overall goal of a common currency is to contribute to the financial stability of a regional economy, including price stability. It means lower cost of cross-border business through the elimination of currency risk. Greater flows of intra-trade would put pressure on prices, resulting in cheaper goods and services. Individuals benefit not only from the lowering of prices, they save by not having to change money when travelling, by being able to compare prices more readily, and by the reduced cost of transferring money across borders. However, there are conditions for a common currency: the intensity of intra-regional trade and the convergence of macroeconomic conditions. Substantial intra-ASEAN trade (which is growing, partly as a result of the ASEAN Free Trade Area (AFTA) and the ASEAN Economic Community.) and economic integration is an incentive for a monetary union. Member states currently trade more with other countries (80%) than among themselves (20%). Therefore, their economies are more concerned about currency stability against major international currencies, like the US dollar. On macroeconomic conditions, member states have different levels of economic development, capacity, and priorities that translate into different levels of interest and readiness. Monetary integration, however, implies less control over national monetary and fiscal policy to stimulate the economy. Therefore, greater convergence in macroeconomic conditions is being enacted to improve conditions and confidence in a common currency.[139] Other concerns include weaknesses in the financial sectors, inadequacy of regional-level resource pooling mechanisms and institutions required to form and manage a currency union, and lack of political preconditions for monetary co-operation and a common currency.[171] In 1992, the Common Effective Preferential Tariff (CEPT) scheme was adopted as a schedule for phasing out tariffs to increase the \"region's competitive advantage as a production base geared for the world market\". This law would act as the framework for the ASEAN Free Trade Area (AFTA), which is an agreement by member states concerning local manufacturing in ASEAN. It was signed on 28 January 1992 in Singapore.[148] Free trade initiatives in ASEAN are spearheaded by the implementation of the ASEAN Trade in Goods Agreement (ATIGA) and the Agreement on Customs. These agreements are supported by several sector bodies to plan and to execute free trade measures, guided by the provisions and the requirements of ATIGA and the Agreement on Customs. They form a backbone for achieving targets of the AEC Blueprint and establishing the ASEAN Economic Community by the end of 2015.[172] On 26 August 2007, ASEAN stated its aim of completing free trade agreements (FTA) with China, Japan, South Korea, India, Australia, and New Zealand by 2013, which is in line with the start of the ASEAN Economic Community by 2015.[173][174] In November 2007, ASEAN states signed the ASEAN Charter, a constitution governing relations among member states and establishing the group itself as an international legal entity.[175] During the same year, the Cebu Declaration on East Asian Energy Security was signed by ASEAN and the other members of the EAS (Australia, China, India, Japan, New Zealand, South Korea), which pursues energy security by finding energy alternatives to fossil fuels.[176] On 27 February 2009, an FTA with Australia and New Zealand was signed. It is believed that this FTA would boost combined GDP across the 12 countries by more than US$48 billion over the period between 2000 and 2020.[177][178] The agreement with China created the ASEAN–China Free Trade Area (ACFTA), which went into full effect on 1 January 2010. In addition, ASEAN was noted to be negotiating an FTA with the European Union.[179] Bilateral trade with India crossed the US$70 billion target in 2012 (target was to reach the level by 2015).[180] Taiwan has also expressed interest in an agreement with ASEAN but needs to overcome diplomatic objections from China.[181] ASEAN, together with its six major trading partners (Australia, China, India, Japan, New Zealand, South Korea), began the first round of negotiations on 26–28 February 2013, in Bali, Indonesia on the establishment of the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP),[182] which is an extension of ASEAN Plus Three and Six that covers 45% of the world's population and about a third of the world's total GDP.[183][184][185] In 2019, Reuters highlighted a mechanism used by traders to avoid the 70% tariff on ethanol imported into China from the United States, involving importing the fuel into Malaysia, mixing it with at least 40% ASEAN-produced fuel, and re-exporting it to China tariff-free under ACFTA rules.[186] Cross-border electricity trade in ASEAN has been limited, despite efforts since 1997 to establish an ASEAN Power Grid and associated trade. Electricity trade accounts for only about 5% of the generation, whereas trades in coal and gas are 86% and 53% respectively.[187][188] With the institutionalisation of visa-free travel between ASEAN member states, intra-ASEAN travel has escalated. In 2010, 47% or 34 million out of 73 million tourists in ASEAN member-states were from other ASEAN countries.[189] Cooperation in tourism was formalised in 1976, following the formation of the Sub-Committee on Tourism (SCOT) under the ASEAN Committee on Trade and Tourism. The 1st ASEAN Tourism Forum was held on 18–26 October 1981 in Kuala Lumpur. In 1986, ASEAN Promotional Chapters for Tourism (APCT) were established in Hong Kong, West Germany, the United Kingdom, Australia/New Zealand, Japan, and North America.[190] Tourism has been one of the key growth sectors in ASEAN and has proven resilient amid global economic challenges. The wide array of tourist attractions across the region drew 109 million tourists to ASEAN in 2015, up by 34% compared to 81 million tourists in 2011. As of 2012, tourism was estimated to account for 4.6% of ASEAN GDP—10.9% when taking into account all indirect contributions. It directly employed 9.3 million people, or 3.2% of total employment, and indirectly supported some 25 million jobs.[191][192] In addition, the sector accounted for an estimated 8% of total capital investment in the region.[193] In January 2012, ASEAN tourism ministers called for the development of a marketing strategy. The strategy represents the consensus of ASEAN National Tourism Organisations (NTOs) on marketing directions for ASEAN moving forward to 2015.[194] In the 2013 Travel and Tourism Competitiveness Index (TTCI) report, Singapore placed 1st, Malaysia placed 8th, Thailand placed 9th, Indonesia placed 12th, Brunei placed 13th, Vietnam placed 16th, Philippines placed 17th, and Cambodia placed 20th as the top destinations of travellers in the Asia Pacific region.[195] 1981 The ASEAN Tourism Forum (ATF) was established. It is a regional meeting of NGOs, Ministers, sellers, buyers and journalists to promote the ASEAN countries as a single one tourist destination. The annual event 2019 in Ha Long marks the 38th anniversary and involves all the tourism industry sectors of the 10 member states of ASEAN: Brunei Darussalam, Cambodia, Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia, Myanmar, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam. It was organized by TTG Events from Singapore. The establishment of the China-ASEAN Investment Cooperation Fund was announced in 2009 by Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao began operations in 2010.[196] The fund, which is sponsored by the Export-Import Bank of China, among other institutional investors, became the first Southeast Asia-focused private equity fund approved by China's State Council and the National Development and Reform Commission.[197] The Export-Import Bank of China is the \"anchor sponsor\" with a \"seed investment\" of US$300 million.[198] Three other Chinese institutions invested a combined US$500 million.[198] The International Finance Corporation of the World Bank invested US$100 million.[198] In November 2011, the China-ASEAN Maritime Cooperation fund was established.[199]: 160 China underwrote the fund, which is valued at RMB 3 billion.[199]: 160 ASEAN maintains a global network of alliances, dialogue partners and diplomatic missions, and is involved in numerous international affairs.[200][201][202][203] The organisation maintains good relationships on an international scale, particularly towards Asia-Pacific nations, and upholds itself as a neutral party in politics. It holds ASEAN Summits, where heads of government of each member states meet to discuss and resolve regional issues, as well as to conduct other meetings with countries outside the bloc to promote external relations and deal with international affairs. The first summit was held in Bali in 1976. The third summit was in Manila in 1987, and during this meeting, it was decided that the leaders would meet every five years.[204] The fourth meeting was held in Singapore in 1992 where the leaders decided to meet more frequently, every three years.[204] In 2001, it was decided that the organisation will meet annually to address urgent issues affecting the region. In December 2008, the ASEAN Charter came into force and with it, the ASEAN Summit will be held twice a year. The formal summit meets for three days, and usually includes internal organisation meeting, a conference with foreign ministers of the ASEAN Regional Forum, an ASEAN Plus Three meeting and ASEAN-CER, a meeting of member states with Australia and New Zealand.[205] ASEAN is a major partner of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation, developing cooperation model with the organisation in the field of security, economy, finance, tourism, culture, environmental protection, development and sustainability.[206][207][208][209] Additionally, the grouping has been closely aligned with China, cooperating across numerous areas, including economy, security, education, culture, technology, agriculture, human resource, society, development, investment, energy, transport, public health, tourism, media, environment, and sustainability.[210][211][212] It is also the linchpin in the foreign policy of Australia and New Zealand, with the three sides being integrated into an essential alliance.[213][214][215][216] ASEAN also participates in the East Asia Summit (EAS), a pan-Asian forum held annually by the leaders of eighteen countries in the East Asian region, with ASEAN in a leadership position. Initially, membership included all member states of ASEAN plus China, Japan, South Korea, India, Australia, and New Zealand, but was expanded to include the United States and Russia at the Sixth EAS in 2011, as they were also important players having dominance and influence over the region. The first summit was held in Kuala Lumpur on 14 December 2005, and subsequent meetings have been held after the annual ASEAN Leaders' Meeting. The summit has discussed issues including trade, energy, and security and the summit has a role in regional community building. Other meetings include the ASEAN Ministerial Meeting[217][218] that focus mostly on specific topics, such as defence or the environment,[219] and are attended by ministers. The ASEAN Regional Forum (ARF), which met for the first time in 1994, fosters dialogue and consultation, and to promote confidence-building and preventive diplomacy in the region.[220] As of July 2007, it consists of twenty-seven participants that include all ASEAN member states, Australia, Bangladesh, Canada, China, the EU, India, Japan, North and South Korea, Mongolia, New Zealand, Pakistan, Papua New Guinea, Russia, East Timor, the United States, and Sri Lanka.[221] Taiwan has been excluded since the establishment of the ARF, and issues regarding the Taiwan Strait are neither discussed at ARF meetings nor stated in the ARF Chairman's Statements. ASEAN also holds meetings with Europe during the Asia–Europe Meeting (ASEM), an informal dialogue process initiated in 1996 with the intention of strengthening co-operation between the countries of Europe and Asia, especially members of the European Union and ASEAN in particular.[222] ASEAN, represented by its secretariat, is one of the forty-five ASEM partners. It also appoints a representative to sit on the governing board of Asia-Europe Foundation (ASEF), a socio-cultural organisation associated with the meeting. Annual bilateral meetings between ASEAN and India, Russia and the United States are also held. Prior to 2012, ASEAN foreign ministerial statements were not typically contentious.[199]: 90 Particularly as international disagreements over the South China Sea increased, the wording of ASEAN foreign ministerial statements became more politically contended.[199]: 90–91 Following the 2022 visit by United States Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi to Taiwan, ASEAN and individual member states reiterated their support of the One China policy.[199]: 89 On 12 November 2022, Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba urged ASEAN countries to abandon their neutrality and condemn Russia's invasion of Ukraine.[223] With perceptions that there have been multiple incursions into the South China Sea by the PRC (China) and ROC (Taiwan), with land, islands and resources all having had previous overlapping claims between Vietnam, Philippines, Malaysia, Brunei, Indonesia, and various other countries, the PRC and ROC's claim into the region is seen as intrusive by many Southeast Asian countries as of 2022, potentially a reflection of the threat of Chinese expansionism into the region.[224][225][226] Shortly after the conclusion of the South China Sea Arbitration, at the 24 July 2016 China-ASEAN Foreign Ministers summit, China assured ASEAN that it would not conduct land reclamation on the Scarborough Shoal.[227]: 129 The joint statement at the conclusion of the summit emphasized the implementation of the Declaration on the Conduct of Parties in the South China Sea and urged the parties to refrain from inhabiting currently unoccupied islands, reefs, shoals, cays, and other features.[227]: 129 Within ASEAN, Cambodia is often supportive of the PRC's positions, including on the South China Sea issue.[228]: 211 There have been territorial disputes between ASEAN member states such as the Cambodian–Thai border dispute between Cambodia and Thailand, Cambodian–Vietnamese border dispute between Cambodia and Vietnam,[229] and the North Borneo dispute between the Philippines and Malaysia.[230][231][232][233] The Vietnamese invasion of Cambodia in 1978, backed by the Soviet Union, was not accepted by ASEAN. They rejected it as a violation of the principles of regional integration. ASEAN cooperated with US and Australia to oppose Vietnam's move and it sponsored a Cambodian resolution in the United Nations General Assembly. ASEAN played a major role starting in 1980 in the peace process, leading to the 1991 Paris Agreement. In 1990, Malaysia proposed the creation of an East Asia Economic Caucus[234] composed of the members of ASEAN, China, Japan, and South Korea. It intended to counterbalance the growing US influence in Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) and Asia as a whole.[235][236] However, the proposal failed because of strong opposition from the US and Japan.[235][237] Work for further integration continued, and the ASEAN Plus Three,[238] consisting of ASEAN, China, Japan, and South Korea, was created in 1997. ASEAN Plus Three[238] is a forum that functions as a coordinator of co-operation between the ASEAN and the three East Asian nations of China, South Korea, and Japan. Government leaders, ministers, and senior officials from the ten members of the ASEAN and the three East Asian states consult on an increasing range of issues.[239] The ASEAN Plus Three is the latest development of Southeast Asia-East Asia regional co-operation. In the past, proposals, such as South Korea's call for an Asian Common Market in 1970 and Japan's 1988 suggestion for an Asian Network, have been made to bring closer regional co-operation.[240] The first leaders' meetings were held in 1996, and 1997 to deal with Asia–Europe Meeting issues, and China and Japan each wanted regular summit meetings with ASEAN members afterwards. The group's significance and importance were strengthened by the Asian Financial Crisis. In response to the crisis, ASEAN closely cooperated with China, South Korea, and Japan. Since the implementation of the Joint Statement on East Asia Cooperation in 1999 at the Manila Summit, ASEAN Plus Three finance ministers have been holding periodic consultations.[241] ASEAN Plus Three, in establishing the Chiang Mai Initiative, has been credited as forming the basis for financial stability in Asia,[242] the lack of such stability having contributed to the Asian Financial Crisis. Since the process began in 1997, ASEAN Plus Three has also focused on subjects other than finance such as the areas of food and energy security, financial co-operation, trade facilitation, disaster management, people-to-people contacts, narrowing the development gap, rural development, and poverty alleviation, human trafficking, labour movement, communicable diseases, environment and sustainable development, and transnational crime, including counter-terrorism. With the aim of further strengthening the nations' co-operation, East Asia Vision Group (EAVG) II was established at the 13th ASEAN Plus Three Summit on 29 October 2010 in Hanoi to stock-take, review, and identify the future direction of the co-operation. The ASEAN Plus Three framework also serves as a platform for the ASEAN affiliated intergovernmental organizations in China, Korea, and Japan to meet and cooperate. The ASEAN-China Centre, the ASEAN-Japan Centre, and ASEAN-Korea Centre currently convene annually to discuss ongoing projects and to discuss possible areas of cooperation vis-a-vis ASEAN.[243] ASEAN Plus Three was the first of attempts for further integration to improve existing ties of Southeast Asia with East Asian countries of China, Japan and South Korea. This was followed by the even larger East Asia Summit (EAS), which included ASEAN Plus Three as well as India, Australia, and New Zealand. This group acted as a prerequisite for the planned East Asia Community which was supposedly patterned after the European Community (now transformed into the European Union). The ASEAN Eminent Persons Group was created to study this policy's possible successes and failures. The group became ASEAN Plus Six with Australia, New Zealand, and India, and stands as the linchpin of Asia Pacific's economic, political, security, socio-cultural architecture, as well as the global economy.[244][245][246][247] Codification of the relations between these countries has seen progress through the development of the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership, a free-trade agreement involving the 15 countries of ASEAN Plus Six (excluding India). RCEP would, in part, allow the members to protect local sectors and give more time to comply with the aim for developed country members.[248] India temporarily does not join the RCEP for the protection of its own market, but Japan, China, and ASEAN welcomes India's participation.[249] Taiwan has been excluded from participating with the organization owing to China's influence on the Asia Pacific through its economic and diplomatic influence.[250] At the turn of the 21st century, ASEAN began to discuss environmental agreements. These included the signing of the ASEAN Agreement on Transboundary Haze Pollution in 2002 as an attempt to control haze pollution in Southeast Asia, arguably the region's most high-profile environmental issue.[251] Unfortunately, this was unsuccessful due to the outbreaks of haze in 2005, 2006, 2009, 2013, and 2015. As of 2015, thirteen years after signing the ASEAN Agreement on Transboundary Haze Pollution, the situation with respect to the long term issue of Southeast Asian haze had not changed for 50% of the ASEAN member states, and still remained as a crisis every two years during summer and fall.[252][253][254] Trash dumping from foreign countries (such as Japan and Canada) to ASEAN has yet to be discussed and resolved.[255] Important issues include deforestation (with Indonesia recorded the largest loss of forest in the region, more than other member states combined in the 2001–2013 period[256]), plastic waste dumping (5 member states were among the top 10 out of 192 countries based on 2010 data, with Indonesia ranked as second worst polluter[257]), threatened mammal species (Indonesia ranked the worst in the region with 184 species under threat[258]), threatened fish species (Indonesia ranked the worst in the region[259]), threatened (higher) plant species (Malaysia ranked the worst in the region[260]). ASEAN's aggregate economy is one of the fastest growing in the world. It is expected to grow by 4.6% in 2019, and 4.8% in 2020, but at the cost of the release about 1.5 billion tonnes of CO2 to the atmosphere every year. That makes ASEAN a greater source of greenhouse gas emissions than Japan (1.3 billion tonnes per year) or Germany (796 million tonnes per year). It is the only region in the world where coal is expected to increase its share of the energy mix.[137] According to the International Energy Agency (IEA), \"Since 2000 [ASEAN's] overall energy demand has grown by more than 80% and the lion's share of this growth has been met by a doubling in fossil fuel use,... Oil is the largest element in the regional energy mix and coal, largely for power generation, has been the fastest growing.\"[153] ASEAN has been criticized for not doing enough to mitigate climate change although it is the world's most vulnerable region in terms of climate impact.[137] ASEAN has many opportunities for renewable energy.[261][262] With solar and wind power plus off river pumped hydro storage, ASEAN electricity industry could achieve very high penetration (78%–97%) of domestic solar and wind energy resources at a competitive levelised costs of electricity range from 55 to 115 U.S. dollars per megawatt-hour based on 2020 technology costs.[261] Vietnam's experience in solar and wind power development provides relevant implications for the other ASEAN countries.[262] The proposed ASEAN Power Grid could allow for renewable energy transmission from large producers like Vietnam to others within ASEAN. The ASEAN has initiated its transition to cleaner energy sources. This transition is characterized as Demanding, Doable, and Dependent.[263] With approximately 679 million inhabitants, the region is witnessing a substantial surge in energy demand, projected to triple by 2050. However, transitioning energy sources requires significant resources. Southeast Asia would need to invest US$27 billion annually in renewable energy to achieve the target of 23% renewables in the primary energy supply by 2025. Nevertheless, this goal is attainable with the implementation of appropriate policies.[263] Vietnam serves as a compelling example of rapid adoption of solar and wind energy.[264] Since 2019, Vietnam has emerged as a regional leader, with solar and wind energy accounting for 13% of its electricity mix in 2022, a remarkable increase from nearly zero in 2017. The region requires international assistance to meet its net-zero emission targets.[263] Phasing out coal remains a daunting task, although countries such as Indonesia and Vietnam have pledged to phasing out coal power by 2040s.[265] Several high-profile leaders such as the head of the Indonesian national energy company PLN, Darmawan Prasodjo, have stated that the ASEAN Power Grid proposal is key to unlocking the potential for green energy in southeast Asia.[266] To enhance the region's status in education, ASEAN education ministers have agreed four priorities for education at all levels, promoting ASEAN awareness among ASEAN citizens, particularly youth, strengthening ASEAN identity through education, building ASEAN human resources in the field of education strengthening the ASEAN University Network.[267] At the 11th ASEAN Summit in December 2005, leaders set new direction for regional education collaboration when they welcomed the decision of the ASEAN education ministers to convene meetings on a regular basis. The annual ASEAN Education Ministers Meeting oversees co-operation efforts on education at the ministerial level. With regard to implementation, programs, and activities are carried out by the ASEAN Senior Officials on Education (SOM-ED). SOM-ED also manages co-operation on higher education through the ASEAN University Network (AUN).[268] It is a consortium of Southeast Asian tertiary institutions of which 30 currently belong as participating universities.[269] Founded in November 1995 by 11 universities,[270] the AUN was established to:[267] promote co-operation among ASEAN scholars, academics, and scientists, develop academic and professional human resources, promote information dissemination among the ASEAN academic community, enhance awareness of a regional identity and the sense of \"ASEAN-ness\" among member states. In November 2011, ten vocational schools and centers were established in China to help develop human resources to assist in the economic and social development of the ASEAN countries.[199]: 160 ASEAN also has a scholarship program offered by Singapore to the 9 other member states for secondary school, junior college, and university education. It covers accommodation, food, medical benefits and accident insurance, school fees, and examination fees. Its recipients, who perform well on the GCE Advanced Level Examination, may apply for ASEAN undergraduate scholarships, which are tailored specifically to undergraduate institutions in Singapore and other ASEAN member countries.[271][272] 'Australia for ASEAN' scholarships are also offered by the Australian Government to the 'next generation of leaders' from ASEAN member states. By undertaking a Master's degree, recipients are to develop the skills and knowledge to drive change, help build links with Australia, and also participate in the Indo-Pacific Emerging Leaders Program to help develop the ASEAN Outlook for the Indo-Pacific. Each ASEAN member state is able to receive ten 'Australia for ASEAN' scholarships.[273] The organization hosts cultural activities in an attempt to further integrate the region. These include sports and educational activities as well as writing awards. Examples of these include the ASEAN Centre for Biodiversity, ASEAN Heritage Parks[274] and the ASEAN Outstanding Scientist and Technologist Award. In addition, the ASEAN region has been recognized as one of the world's most diverse regions ethnically, religiously and linguistically.[275][276] Member states have promoted co-operation in information to help build an ASEAN identity. One of the main bodies in ASEAN co-operation in information is the ASEAN Committee on Culture and Information (COCI). Established in 1978, its mission is to promote effective co-operation in the fields of information, as well as culture, through its various projects and activities. It includes representatives from national institutions like the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Ministries of Culture and Information, national radio and television networks, museums, archives and libraries, among others. Together, they meet once a year to formulate and agree on projects to fulfil their mission.[277] On 14 November 2014, foreign ministers of member states launched the ASEAN Communication Master Plan (ACPM).[278] It provides a framework for communicating the character, structure, and overall vision of ASEAN and the ASEAN community to key audiences within the region and globally.[279] ASEAN Media Cooperation (AMC) sets digital television standards and policies in preparation for broadcasters to transition from analogue to digital broadcasting. This collaboration was conceptualised during the 11th ASEAN Ministers Responsible for Information (AMRI) Conference in Malaysia on 1 March 2012 where a consensus declared that both new and traditional media were keys to connecting ASEAN peoples and bridging cultural gaps in the region.[280] Several key initiatives under the AMC include:[281] Music plays a significant role in ASEAN affairs, as evidenced by the new music composed for, and to be performed at, the 34th ASEAN Summit in Bangkok in June 2019.[286] Since ASEAN's founding, a number of songs have been written for the regional alliance: The main sporting event of ASEAN is the Southeast Asian Games, a biennial meet of athletes from the ten member-states. A non-member state Timor-Leste (also known as East Timor) is now participating the SEA Games. ASEAN has been credited by many as among the world's most influential organisations and a global powerhouse.[287][288] The organisation plays a prominent role in regional and international diplomacy, politics, security, economy and trade.[289][290][291][292][293][294][295][296][297][298][299][300][excessive citations] The ASEAN Free Trade Area also stands as one of the largest and most important free trade areas in the world, and together with its network of dialogue partners, drove some of the world's largest multilateral forums and blocs, including APEC, EAS and RCEP.[299][301][302][303][298][304][excessive citations] Being one of the world's forefront political, economic and security meetings, the ASEAN Summit serves as a prominent regional (Asia) and international (worldwide) conference, with world leaders attending its related summits and meetings to discuss about various problems and global issues, strengthening cooperation, and making decisions.[305][306] Critics have charged ASEAN with weakly promoting human rights and democracy, particularly in junta-led Myanmar.[307] Some scholars think that non-interference has hindered ASEAN efforts to handle the Myanmar issue, human rights abuse, and haze pollution in the area. Despite global outrage at the military crack-down on unarmed protesters in Yangon, ASEAN has refused to suspend Myanmar as a member and also rejects proposals for economic sanctions.[308] This has caused concern as the European Union has refused to conduct free trade negotiations at a regional level for these political reasons.[309] During a UN vote against the ethnic cleansing of Rohingya, most member states voted to either abstain or against the condemnation. Only the Muslim-majority countries Malaysia, Indonesia, and Brunei voted to condemn the cleansing of Rohingya.[310] Some international observers view ASEAN as a \"talk shop\",[311] stating that the organisation is: \"big on words, but small on action\".[312] \"ASEAN policies have proven to be mostly rhetoric, rather than actual implementation\", according to Pokpong Lawansiri, a Bangkok-based independent analyst of ASEAN. \"It has been noted that less than 50% of ASEAN agreements are actually implemented, while ASEAN holds more than six hundred meetings annually\".[313] The head of the International Institute of Strategic Studies, Tim Huxley, cites the diverse political systems present in the grouping, including many young states, as a barrier to far-reaching co-operation beyond economics. He also asserts that, without an external threat to rally against after the Cold War ended, ASEAN has less successfully restrained its members and resolved such border disputes as those between Myanmar and Thailand or Indonesia and Malaysia.[314] During the 12th ASEAN Summit in Cebu, several activist groups staged anti-globalisation protests,[315] arguing that the agenda of economic integration would negatively affect industries in the Philippines and would deprive thousands of Filipinos of their jobs.[316] Corruption remains a widespread issue, as \"tea money\" remains an important requirement to grease business transactions and to receive public services. Following the release of the Corruption Perceptions Index 2015 by Berlin-based graft watchdog Transparency International on 27 January, its Asia Pacific director, Srirak Plipat, noted that: \"if there was one common challenge to unite the Asia-Pacific region, it would be corruption\", noting that: \"from campaign pledges to media coverage to civil society forums, corruption dominates the discussion. Yet despite all this talk, there's little sign of action.\"[317] The group's integration plan has raised concerns, in particular, the 2015 deadline. Business and economy experts who attended the Lippo-UPH Dialogue in Naypyidaw cited unresolved issues relating to aviation, agriculture, and human resources.[318] Some panelists, among them, Kishore Mahbubani, warned against high expectations at the onset. He stated: \"Please do not expect a big bang event in 2015 where everything is going to happen overnight when the ASEAN Economic Community comes into being. We've made progress in some areas and unfortunately regressed in some areas.\"[319] Some panelists enumerated other matters to be dealt with for a successful launch. Among them were the communications issues involving the 600 million citizens living in the region, increasing understanding in business, current visa arrangements, demand for specific skills, banking connections, and economic differences. Former Philippine National Statistical Coordination Board (NSCB) Secretary General Romulo A. Virola, said in 2012 that the Philippines seems unready to benefit from the integration due to its \"wobbly\" economic performance compared to other member states. According to Virola, the Philippines continues to lag behind in terms of employment rate, tourism, life expectancy, and cellular subscriptions.[320] Nestor Tan, head of BDO Unibank Inc., said that while some businesses see the Asian Economic Blueprint (AEC) as an opportunity, the integration would be more of a threat to local firms. Tan added that protecting the Philippines' agricultural and financial services sectors, as well as the labour sector, would be necessary for the implementation of AEC by 2015.[321] Standard & Poor's also believed that banks in the Philippines are not yet prepared for the tougher competition that would result from the integration. In one of its latest publications, S&P said banks in the country, although profitable and stable, operate on a much smaller scale than their counterparts in the region.[321] The US Chamber of Commerce has highlighted widespread concern that the much-anticipated AEC could not be launched by the 2015 deadline.[322] In January 2014, former ASEAN Secretary-General Rodolfo C. Severino, wrote: \"while ASEAN should not be condemned for its members' failure to make good on their commitments, any failure to deliver will likely lead to a loss of credibility and could mean that member states fall further behind in the global competition for export markets and foreign direct investment (FDI)\".[323] In 2012, the commencement of the AEC was postponed to 31 December 2015 from the original plan of 1 January. Despite Secretary-General Surin Pitsuwan's firm reassurance that \"[t]here will be no more delays and that all ten ASEAN countries will participate\", even the most fervent proponents of AEC worried that AEC would not be delivered on time as December 2015 neared.[132] An article published by Vietnam News echoed some of the challenges and opportunities that Vietnam faces in preparation for the AEC. The article said that the deputy head of the Ministry of Industry and Trade, Tran Thanh Hai, was concerned about local enterprises' lack of knowledge of the AEC. It was said that 80% of local enterprises surveyed acknowledged that they have little information about the interests and challenges available for them in the ASEAN market. The article also noted that the general secretary of the Vietnam Steel Association, Chu Duc Khai, said that most of the local steel making enterprises lack information about doing business in the ASEAN market; they have not had a chance to study it, and have only exported small amounts of steel to ASEAN countries.[324] Another challenge is the need to compete with other countries in the ASEAN market to export raw products since the country had mainly exported raw products.[325] The Asian Development Bank also has doubts about Cambodia's ability to meet the AEC deadline. The leading economist of ADB, Jayant Menon, said that Cambodia needs to speed up its customs reform and to press ahead with automating processes to reduce trade costs and minimise the opportunities for corruption and be ready for the implementation of its National Single Window by 2015.[326] Despite an ASEAN Economic Community goal of significant economic integration as laid out in the AEC Blueprint 2025, ASEAN continues to face challenges towards integration.[327] A report published by the Asian Trade Centre in 2019 identified multiple sectors that face challenges towards integration due to non-tariff barriers that still exist in the region. The report stated that the goals of the AEC 2025 would not be accomplished if ASEAN fails to address the issues of non-tariff measures and eliminate non-tariff barriers in the region.[328][329] ASEAN is recognized by its members to be one of the main forums to discuss security issues; based on the principles in its charter, its main aim is to provide an environment of common understanding and cooperation between the member states to \"respond effectively to all forms of threats, transitional crimes and transboundary challenges\".[330] Accordingly, ASEAN has embraced the idea of cooperative security[331] which means that ASEAN's approach to security issues is through confidence-building measures and transparency for reducing the tension and conflict between its members. Security policies and plans are concerted by the ASEAN Political-Security Community to envision \"a concert of Southeast Asian nations, outward looking, living in peace, stability and prosperity, bonded together in partnership in dynamic development and in a community of caring societies.\"[332] Piracy in the strait of Malacca and in the Sulu and Celebes Sea is one of the main non-traditional security threats for the region, it has challenged the capacity of its members to ensure coordination of effective policy actions to reduce this phenomenon. As highlighted by the ReCAAP report of 2020: \"The increase of incidents (in Asia) during January–June 2020 occurred in Bangladesh, India, Indonesia, the Philippines, Vietnam, South China Sea and Singapore Strait.\"[333] The increment of incidents during 2020, have raised alerts in the region as the phenomenon of piracy could be fostered by the social consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic, in their Fourteenth Asean Ministerial Meeting On Transnational Crime[334] the ministers agreed that ASEAN should embrace a greater commitment to strengthen the measures in combating transnational crime in the context of the pandemic. Despite this statement, ASEAN has not updated their plans for combating piracy, although member states created and enforced the Maritime Security Plan of Action 2018-2020, to address the national legal enforcement capacities and creating a common protocol of action to counter piracy allowing the region to cooperate for ensuring the security of the Pacific Ocean, new discussions and agendas for new measures has not been enforced yet. Accordingly, this plan reinforces the necessity to secure the seas due to the importance of this region geographical and economically, its strategic position as the main link between the Indian and the Pacific Ocean and the region serving as the main passage that connects middle east economies and India with China, Japan, South Korea and Australia. This plan is mainly focused in three priorities:[335] In this sense, spread all over the countries of Southeast Asia, criminal organizations with complex structures pose a challenge to ASEAN's coordination capacity to solve the problem despite the plans created within its institutional framework. Although some measures have been implemented by ASEAN,[336] still the complexity of the problem requires deep solutions of cooperation that might alter the balance of its framework. The maritime security plans for the region are based on the ASEAN idea of political-security community; the two main objectives of the APSC are: \"to accelerate the economic growth, social progress and cultural development by promoting an identity of equality and partnership as the main foundations of peace and prosperity\".[336] Additionally, the APSC promotes \"regional peace and stability through abiding respect for justice and the rule of law in the relationship among countries of the region and adherence to the principles of the United Nations Charter\".[337] Nonetheless, the institutional framework and decision-making procedures in ASEAN make difficult to reach agreements on piracy. ASEAN has struggled to deliver a coordinated response to solve this problem in the region mainly by two reasons: the first one, could be related to the focalized nature of the problem in subregions rather than the whole region. Consequently, this focalization generates that the discussions in the main forums (The ASEAN maritime forum (AMF) and Maritime Security Expert Working Group (MSEWG)) have not resulted in actual measures that tackle piracy and involve all member states as major consensus should be reached to enforce them. One example of this, is the possibility discussed by the 10 ASEAN member states to create a joint ASEAN navy in 2015 to carry on operations in one of the piracy hotspots in the region,[338] the strait of Malacca, this proposal ended up being enforced by bilateral/sub-regional efforts rather than in the ASEAN framework (see ReCAAP for further information).[339][340][341] The second one, consensus on non-traditional security issues has been difficult to reach due to contradictory interest between member states, particularly in joint operations between navies and the reach of these joint operations. These issues are generated mainly by unresolved territorial disputes, specially in the maritime domain, at some extent they pose a challenge to ASEAN members in their capacity to cooperate in regards to the maritime security approach.[342] Consequently, a greater multilateral cooperation has been pushed by the members to solve the piracy challenges on economy, trading and security. Members of the ASEAN, have addressed the necessity for the regional organization to make some concessions and rearrangements to respond to the challenges that non-traditional security (specifically piracy) issues posse to the security of the ASEAN members. Despite the efforts and plans made by the ASEAN, this organization is expected to overcome the image of being regarded solely as a forum to discuss security issues. Two possible solutions has been proposed by some member states for this purpose: 1. Promoting relationships with other major actors regionally to overcome the short-time challenges and 2. Rearrange the institutional framework to \"avoid contention and seek cooperation to maximize the aggregate ability in order to benefit from making the sea fulfil its economic, security and other goals\".[342] In addition to piracy, there are several significant issues facing ASEAN today, including human rights violations, repression, and democratic backsliding. Across the region, various political leaders are known human rights abusers, however there is no proper accountability process, and often human rights violations are sidelined by economic or political interests.[343] Myanmar is in the midst of a devastating civil war, during which the military government that was installed following a coup d’état, has carried out horrendous human rights violations against the Rohingya population.[344] Organisations ASEAN Summits ASEAN organisations ASEAN related websites",

Faskianos April 12, 2023 United States A Conversation With Secretary Antony J. Blinken Event with Antony J. Blinken and Michael Froman December 18, 2024 The Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) is a regional grouping that aims to promote economic and security cooperation among its ten members: Brunei, Cambodia, Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia, Myanmar, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand, and Vietnam. ASEAN countries have a total population of 662 million people and a combined gross domestic product (GDP) of $3.2 trillion. The group has played a central role in Asian economic integration, joining negotiations to form the world’s largest free trade agreement and signing six free trade deals with other economies in the region. Yet experts say ASEAN’s impact is limited by a lack of strategic vision, diverging priorities among member states, and weak leadership. The bloc’s biggest challenges, they say, are developing a unified approach to China, particularly in response to territorial disputes in the South China Sea, and responding to Myanmar’s civil war. More on: Southeast Asia Asia Regional Organizations Defense and Security Trade ASEAN is headed by a chair—a position that rotates annually among leaders of member states—and is assisted by a secretariat based in Jakarta, Indonesia. Important decisions are usually reached through consultation and consensus guided by the principles of noninterference in internal affairs and peaceful resolution of conflicts. Many experts see this approach to decision-making as a drawback of the organization. “These norms of consensus and noninterference have increasingly become outdated, and they have hindered ASEAN’s influence on issues such as dealing with China and crises in particular ASEAN states,” says CFR's senior fellow for Southeast Asian studies, Joshua Kurlantzick. Supporters of ASEAN, such as Kishore Mahbubani, who served as Singapore’s permanent representative to the United Nations, say the grouping has improved previously hostile regional relations. “[ASEAN’s] culture of consultations and consensus generated geopolitical miracles, some so stealthy that few outside the region have noticed them,” says Mahbubani.

Formed in 1967, ASEAN united Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore, and Thailand, who sought to create a common front against the spread of communism. In 1976, the members signed the Treaty of Amity and Cooperation in Southeast Asia, which emphasizes mutual respect and noninterference in other countries’ affairs. Membership doubled by the end of the 1990s. The resolution of Cambodia’s civil war in 1991, the end of the Cold War, and the normalization of relations between the United States and Vietnam in 1995 brought relative peace to mainland Southeast Asia, paving the way for more states to join ASEAN. With the addition of Brunei (1984), Vietnam (1995), Laos and Myanmar (1997), and Cambodia (1999), the group started to launch initiatives to boost regional cooperation. For example, the members signed a treaty in 1995 to refrain from developing, acquiring, or possessing nuclear weapons. Timor-Leste is the latest country to join ASEAN: after the country applied for membership in 2011, the group granted it observer status in 2022, and it is on track for full membership by 2025. Faced with the 1997 Asian financial crisis, which started in Thailand, ASEAN members pushed to further integrate their economies. For instance, the Chiang Mai Initiative was a currency swap arrangement initiated in 2000 among ASEAN members, China, Japan, and South Korea to provide financial support to one another and fight currency speculation. More on: Southeast Asia Asia Regional Organizations Defense and Security Trade In 2007, the ten members adopted the ASEAN Charter, a constitutional document that provided the grouping with legal status and an institutional framework. The charter enshrines core principles and delineates requirements for membership. (Timor-Leste submitted an application for membership in 2011, but some members oppose its accession.) The charter laid out a blueprint for a community made up of three branches: the ASEAN Economic Community (AEC), the ASEAN Political-Security Community, and the ASEAN Socio-Cultural Community. ASEAN brings together countries with significant differences. Singapore has the highest GDP per capita in the group, at around $83,000, according to 2022 World Bank figures; Myanmar’s is the lowest, at around $1,100. Demographics differ across the region, too, with many religious and ethnic groups represented. For example, Singapore and Vietnam are among the world’s most religiously diverse countries, according to a 2014 Pew Research Center report, while Buddhist-majority Cambodia and Muslim-majority Indonesia are relatively homogeneous. ASEAN’s geography includes archipelagos and continental land masses with low plains and mountainous terrain. The members’ political systems include flawed democracies, authoritarian states, and hybrid regimes. The past decade has seen previously some semi-democratic governments, like Indonesia and Cambodia, grow increasingly authoritarian. Today, Timor-Leste remains the only fully free democracy in Southeast Asia, according to research and advocacy group Freedom House. ASEAN has made some progress toward economic integration and free trade. In 1992, members created the ASEAN Free Trade Area (AFTA) with the goals of creating a single market, increasing intra-ASEAN trade and investments, and attracting foreign investment. In 1996, the average tariff rate across the bloc was around 7 percent [PDF]; today, intra-ASEAN tariffs are effectively zero. The bloc has prioritized eleven sectors for integration, including: electronics, automotives, rubber-based products, textiles and apparels, agro-based products, and tourism. In November 2020, all ASEAN members joined Australia, China, Japan, New Zealand, and South Korea in signing the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP), a free trade agreement in the works since 2012. Although the RCEP doesn’t cut tariffs drastically, it covers more of the world’s population—30 percent—than any other trade agreement and promotes economic integration between Northeast and Southeast Asia. ASEAN is also party to six free trade agreements with countries outside of the grouping, including India. However, there remain major challenges to economic integration within ASEAN, such as non-tariff barriers, government-mandated investment prohibition areas, and massive differences in GDP per capita. Intra-ASEAN trade as a share of the bloc’s overall trade remains low, at 21 percent [PDF] in 2020. Domestic issues, such as instability and corruption in certain countries, have also hurt trade within the bloc. Moreover, the COVID-19 pandemic was severely disruptive to economic growth. ASEAN attempted to coordinate a regional response in 2020 to address economic and health-care challenges, but successful pandemic management ultimately hinged on individual states’ policy decisions. Member states agreed to coordinate economic recovery plans and keep trade open. However, prolonged lockdowns severely reduced industrial production, construction, and consumer spending. Additionally, travel restrictions hampered intra-bloc trade and tourism, which contributed almost $400 billion to ASEAN member economies in 2019. ASEAN remains divided over how to address security challenges. These include China’s claims in the South China Sea, human rights abuses, political repression by member states, narcotics trafficking, refugee flows, natural disasters, and terrorism. A primary challenge for ASEAN has been developing a response to the February 2021 coup in Myanmar. The junta has violently suppressed protests, and the conflict with opposition forces has escalated into civil war. Timor-Leste sided with Myanmar’s exiled government, leading to Myanmar’s military junta expelling Timor-Leste’s top diplomat from Myanmar. During the 2023 ASEAN Summit held in Jakarta, Indonesia, ASEAN nations decided to suspend Myanmar’s role as rotating chair for the 2026 summit, substituting the Philippines instead. Another long-standing challenge has been forming a joint response to China, particularly to maritime disputes with Beijing in the South China Sea. Brunei, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, and Vietnam claim features in waters contested with China. For those countries, China’s moves to reclaim land and build artificial islands are seen as violations of their national sovereignty. In response, some have invested in modernizing their militaries. For other ASEAN members, tensions in the South China Sea are geographically distant and not a priority. A few, such as Cambodia, even tend to support China’s claims and block joint ASEAN statements on the South China Sea. In 2002, ASEAN and China signed the nonbinding Declaration of Conduct of Parties in the South China Sea, though they have not yet negotiated a legally binding code and it is unlikely they will negotiate one anytime in the near future. The United States, which has a strong interest in preventing China from controlling access to the South China Sea, has continued military cooperation with ASEAN members, including the Philippines, Thailand, Singapore, Indonesia, and Vietnam, and has increased its maritime presence in regional areas to enforce freedom of navigation in international waters. ASEAN members are divided over their ties to China and to the United States. The region is in need of investment, trade, and infrastructure development. Beijing has moved to meet these needs primarily through becoming the leading trading partner of ASEAN, as well as through its sweeping Belt and Road Initiative. Its dominant trade relationship with most Southeast Asian states, and its massive investment in Southeast Asia, gives it enormous leverage in the region. For instance, China invested $7.3 billion in Indonesia’s first high-speed railway, which began construction in 2015 and is set to expand throughout the main island of Java, despite delays, cost overruns, and anger among people whose land was expropriated. Most ASEAN countries now believe that China has more overall influence in the region compared to the United States, measured by economic relationships, defense networks, and diplomatic and cultural influence. But some member states are anxious about becoming economically dependent on China and seek defense cooperation with the United States to hedge against China’s growing military power. The United States is ASEAN’s fourth-largest trading partner in terms of goods, trailing China, the European Union, and Japan. In 2022, the United States’ total trade in goods and services with ASEAN was an estimated $505.8 billion. The United States has launched subregional and bilateral initiatives to boost ties, including the Mekong-U.S. Partnership, which aims to deepen cooperation between the United States and Cambodia, Laos, Myanmar, Thailand, and Vietnam on issues related to the environment, health, education, and infrastructure development. U.S. presidents have also met Southeast Asian leaders during ASEAN summits and the annual East Asia Summit, which is hosted by ASEAN and also attended by the heads of state of Australia, China, India, Japan, New Zealand, Russia, and South Korea. In 2023, President Joe Biden skipped the ASEAN summit to attend the Group of Twenty (G20) Summit in New Delhi, India, sending Vice President Kamala Harris in his place. Some ASEAN members viewed Biden's absence as a disappointment and diplomatic snub. The Barack Obama administration, as part of its so-called “pivot” or “rebalance” to Asia, increased U.S. participation in activities with ASEAN. President Obama and other senior officials attended some ASEAN summits. The administration also named the first resident ambassador to ASEAN, joined the Treaty of Amity and Cooperation, and established an annual U.S.-ASEAN summit. In 2015, the United States and ASEAN elevated their relationship to a strategic partnership. The following year, Obama hosted the first U.S.-ASEAN leaders’ summit in California. The Donald Trump administration sent high-ranking officials to Southeast Asia, including Vice President Mike Pence and secretaries of state and defense. But President Trump attended just one meeting with ASEAN leaders, in 2017. Some experts in Southeast Asia say the Trump administration’s inconsistent engagement with the region caused U.S.-ASEAN relations to deteriorate. The U.S. withdrawal in 2017 from the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTPP), a free trade agreement formerly known as the TPP, set back broader U.S. efforts to demonstrate commitment to the region’s trade integration, they say. The United States is not part of the RCEP trade deal. President Biden has promised to boost ties with ASEAN by collaborating on issues such as climate change, global supply chains, and the COVID-19 pandemic. However, CFR’s Kurlantzick says the administration has yet to deliver on its promise to strengthen economic ties with the region. The Indo-Pacific Economic Framework (IPEF) for regional economic cooperation, launched in 2022 and which entered its fourth round of negotiations in July 2023, falls short of an actual trade deal. The United States offers no market access to countries involved, alienating many of them. Many Southeast Asian states are disappointed with the IPEF, as compared to regional trade deals led by China and Japan that successfully improve trade across Asia. CFR’s Joshua Kurlantzick discusses democratic backsliding and the revival of military rule in Southeast Asia. In this 2021 report [PDF], the East-West Center, the U.S.-ASEAN Business Council, and the ISEAS–Yusof Ishak Institute take stock of U.S.-ASEAN ties.

                "content": "Our editors will review what you’ve submitted and determine whether to revise the article. ASEAN is an international organization that has 10 member countries in Southeast Asia: Brunei, Cambodia, Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia, Myanmar, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand, and Vietnam. ASEAN’s purpose is to promote economic and cultural exchange among its member countries, maintain peace and stability in Southeast Asia, and establish relationships with foreign powers with similar aims. ASEAN formed during the Cold War to promote stability and cooperation in a politically turbulent region. ASEAN is the acronym for Association of Southeast Asian Nations. ASEAN was established August 8, 1967, by member countries Indonesia, Thailand, Malaysia, the Philippines, and Singapore. The precursor of ASEAN was the Association of South East Asia, which consisted of the Philippines, Thailand, and the Federation of Malaya. The most recent addition to ASEAN is Cambodia, which joined in 1999. Since its conception with five countries in 1967, ASEAN has doubled in membership. ASEAN creates and implements policy based on a system of consultation and consensus. Consultations occur between governments before a proposal is brought to discussion, and a proposal is only passed after there is consensus from all member governments. ASEAN, international organization established by the governments of Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore, and Thailand in 1967 to accelerate economic growth and promote peace and security in Southeast Asia. Brunei joined in 1984, followed by Vietnam in 1995, Laos and Myanmar in 1997, and Cambodia in 1999. East Timor has been granted observer status and is expected to become a full member in 2025. The ASEAN region has a population of more than 700 million, covers a total area of 1.7 million square miles (4.5 million square km), and had a combined gross domestic product of $3.62 trillion as of 2022. Since its establishment, ASEAN has substantially enhanced security and stability throughout Southeast Asia, while also promoting economic growth and cooperation on international issues. Yet certain regional issues remain divisive within ASEAN, such as Myanmar’s civil war, which has proved challenging for the bloc to address uniformly, and relations with China, particularly with regards to economic ties and territorial disputes in the South China Sea. ASEAN’s origins can be traced back to earlier regional organizations such as the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization (SEATO), founded in 1954, and the Association of Southeast Asia (ASA), established in 1961. These early efforts, however, were limited in scope and membership. In 1967 ASEAN was established by Thailand, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, and Singapore with the signing of the ASEAN Declaration in Bangkok. The initial aim was to encourage regional cooperation and create a collective front against the spread of communism in Asia, reflecting the geopolitical concerns of the era. The organization gained a new level of cohesion in the mid-1970s following the Vietnam War. ASEAN’s first summit meeting, held in Bali, Indonesia, in 1976, resulted in several significant agreements, including the signing of the Treaty of Amity and Cooperation. The end of the Cold War and increased regional development and stability saw ASEAN expand its membership, incorporating Brunei, Vietnam, Laos, Myanmar, and Cambodia by the end of the 1990s. This period also marked a shift toward deeper economic integration, exemplified by the establishment of the ASEAN Free Trade Area (AFTA) in 1992 and the response to the 1997 Asian financial crisis with the Chiang Mai Agreement. The adoption of the ASEAN Charter in 2007 provided a legal and institutional framework defined by three core pillars: the ASEAN Economic Community, the ASEAN Political-Security Community, and the ASEAN Socio-Cultural Community. This structure has helped promote increased cooperation and mutual understanding, despite enormous differences in the political structures, cultural backgrounds, and development levels of member states. ASEAN is considered to be one the developing world’s most successful regional economic cooperation zones. Unlike its primary counterparts in the developed world, the European Union (EU) and the United States–Mexico–Canada Agreement (USMCA), ASEAN has followed a more gradual and flexible approach to integration, accommodating the diversity of its member states. ASEAN has prioritized trade liberalization, sustainable development, and attracting foreign investment over deepening political integration or adopting a common currency. ASEAN’s economic integration efforts began with the creation of the ASEAN Free Trade Area (AFTA) in 1992, which successfully reduced tariffs between ASEAN’s first six members (Brunei, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore, and Thailand) to 0–5 percent by 2002. Vietnam, Laos, Myanmar, and Cambodia were required to sign the AFTA agreement upon joining ASEAN. Today tariffs between ASEAN countries are close to zero. In 2007 the ASEAN Economic Community Blueprint was signed in Singapore with the goal of achieving four objectives by 2015: (1) create a single market and production base, (2) become a highly competitive economic region, (3) promote equitable economic development within the region, and (4) fully integrate the region into the global economy. The AEC was implemented in 2015, although approximately 20 percent of measures toward achieving a single market remain in progress and have been deferred to a new deadline of 2025. The ASEAN-Japan Comprehensive Economic Partnership (AJCEP) was implemented in 2008, and the ASEAN-China Free Trade Agreement (ACFTA) was implemented in 2010. In 2020 ASEAN joined Australia, China, Japan, New Zealand, and South Korea in signing the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP), the largest trade agreement in history. Significant challenges remain for ASEAN’s economic integration, including pervasive nontariff barriers, restrictive investment measures, and vast disparities in GDP per capita. Domestic issues such as political instability and corruption in member states exacerbate these challenges. The COVID-19 pandemic created severe economic disruption in sectors such as industrial production and tourism; nonetheless, ASEAN coordinated a regional response to align economic recovery strategies and maintain open trade routes. Ultimately, ASEAN has demonstrated an exemplary and ongoing commitment to strengthening cooperation and integration and maximizing the region’s economic potential. ASEAN faces multifaceted security challenges due to both internal dynamics and external pressures. An outstanding challenge is the bloc’s lack of a unified stance on China. The escalating U.S.-China rivalry has heightened tensions in Southeast Asia, a region which has historically been a battleground for great power competition. China’s assertive actions in the South China Sea have led to territorial disputes with several ASEAN members, with the Philippines and Vietnam in particular struggling with ongoing Chinese harassment of their vessels. China’s Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) has drastically increased its influence, bringing significant infrastructural and economic development to ASEAN countries including Indonesia, Cambodia, and Laos while also raising concerns about sovereignty and financial dependence. Some ASEAN countries, particularly Cambodia, have even supported China’s territorial claims in the South China Sea and opposed joint ASEAN statements on the issue, pushing others, such as the Philippines and Vietnam, to strengthen ties with the U.S. and Japan. Amid growing tension over Taiwan, ASEAN, which has thus far adhered to the one-China policy yet relies on Taiwan for imports of electronic components, has expressed a willingness to mediate between Beijing and Taipei. As ASEAN has historically declined to involve itself in the issue of Taiwan’s independence, this reflects the increasing severity of tensions. The conflict in Myanmar is another critical challenge for ASEAN and has proved difficult for the bloc to address uniformly since the 2021 military coup. With ASEAN as a whole taking no action, some member countries, particularly Thailand and Cambodia, have independently attempted mediation. In early 2024 Thai leaders engaged in talks with both the ruling junta and rebel leaders, and Cambodian Senate President Hun Sen made a request that the junta allow him to speak with imprisoned civilian leader Aung San Suu Kyi—a request which was denied. Additionally, Thailand has increased humanitarian efforts along its 1,500-mile (2,400-kilometer) border with Myanmar, planning to establish a “humanitarian safe zone.” These independent actions reflect Cambodia and Thailand’s growing disillusionment with ASEAN’s inaction. Another significant issue facing ASEAN is climate change, with rising temperatures causing more frequent floods, droughts, typhoons, and other extreme weather events. For archipelagos such as Indonesia and the Philippines, rising sea levels could be particularly devastating. In response, several ASEAN member states have become leaders in combating climate change. Indonesia leads the World Economic Forum’s Ocean 20 initiative, and nine member states have pledged to reach net zero emissions by 2050. The bloc as a whole aims to make 23 percent of its energy resources renewable by 2025, and Vietnam has become a global leader in solar energy. Nonetheless, the Asian Development Bank estimates that the region’s economy could shrink by 11 percent by the end of the 21st century despite these efforts. Relations between ASEAN and other countries are conducted through ASEAN Plus Three, an annual meeting of ASEAN heads of state with the leaders of China, South Korea, and Japan; ASEAN Plus Six, which includes ASEAN Plus Three and Australia, India, and New Zealand; and the East Asia Summit, a meeting of ASEAN Plus Six with Russia and the United States. ASEAN summit meetings have occurred semiannually since the adoption of the ASEAN charter, and the organization’s agenda is overseen by a permanent secretariat based in Jakarta. The bloc’s diplomatic style has been described as “the ASEAN way,” a method of decision making that emphasizes noninterference, consensus, and personal, informal diplomacy, contributing to its growing influence and role as a major geopolitical entity. ASEAN has benefited enormously from Asia’s rise as a global center of power and wealth. By balancing relationships with the U.S., China, India, and the European Union, ASEAN is geographically and politically well situated to continue its extraordinary trajectory as one of the world’s fastest-growing trade blocs. As of 2023, ASEAN accounted for approximately 8 percent of global exports, putting it on par with the U.S. It is also central to two major free trade areas: the previously mentioned Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP) and the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTPP), which includes Canada, Chile, Mexico, and Peru as well as Australia, Brunei, Japan, Malaysia, New Zealand, Singapore, and Vietnam. ASEAN also participates in global forums such as the United Nations (UN), World Trade Organization (WTO), and Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC), advocating for developing countries’ interests.",

                "content": "Manchester City Football Club is a professional football club based in Manchester, England, that competes in the Premier League, the top flight of English football. Founded in 1880 as St. Mark's (West Gorton), they became Ardwick Association Football Club in 1887 and Manchester City in 1894. The club's home ground is the Etihad Stadium in east Manchester, to which they moved in 2003, having played at Maine Road since 1923. Manchester City adopted their sky blue home shirts in 1894, the first season with the current name.[4] Over the course of its history, the club has won ten league titles, seven FA Cups, eight League Cups, seven FA Community Shields, one UEFA Champions League, one European Cup Winners' Cup, one UEFA Super Cup and one FIFA Club World Cup. The club joined the Football League in 1892, and won their first major honour, the FA Cup, in 1904. Manchester City had its first major period of success in the late 1960s and early 1970s, winning the league title, FA Cup, League Cup, and European Cup Winners Cup under the management of Joe Mercer and Malcolm Allison. After losing the 1981 FA Cup final, Manchester City went through a period of decline, culminating in relegation to the third tier of English football for the only time in their history in 1998. They since regained promotion to the top tier in 2001–02 and have remained a fixture in the Premier League since 2002–03. Manchester City received considerable financial investment both in playing staff and facilities following its takeover by Sheikh Mansour bin Zayed Al Nahyan through the Abu Dhabi United Group in August 2008.[5] This started a new era of unprecedented success, with the club winning the FA Cup in 2011 and the Premier League in 2012, both their first since the 1960s, followed by another league title in 2014. Under the management of Pep Guardiola, Manchester City won the Premier League in 2018, becoming the only team in the competition history to attain 100 points in a single season. In 2018–19, they won four trophies, completing an unprecedented sweep of all domestic titles in England and becoming the first English men's team to win the domestic treble.[6] This was followed by four consecutive Premier League titles in 2020–21, 2021–22, 2022–23 and 2023–24, as well as the club's first Champions League final in 2021, which they lost to Chelsea. The 2022–23 season saw Manchester City win their maiden European Cup and complete the continental treble in the process, becoming the second English club to do so.[7] The club was ranked first in the UEFA coefficient standings in 2023.[8] Manchester City topped the Deloitte Football Money League at the end of the 2021–22 season, making it the football club with the highest revenue in the world, approximated at €731 million.[9] In 2022, Forbes estimated the club was the sixth-most valuable in the world, worth $4.250 billion.[10][11] Manchester City are owned by City Football Group Limited, a holding company valued at £3.73 ($4.8) billion in November 2019 and majority-owned by the Abu Dhabi United Group.[12][13] City gained their first honours by winning the Second Division in 1899; with it came promotion to the highest level in English football, the First Division. They went on to claim their first major honour on 23 April 1904, beating Bolton Wanderers 1–0 at Crystal Palace to win the FA Cup; the Blues narrowly missed out on a League and Cup double that season after finishing runners-up in the league campaign, but they still became the first club in Manchester to win a major honour.[15] In the seasons following the FA Cup triumph, the club was dogged by allegations of financial irregularities, culminating in the suspension of seventeen players in 1906, including captain Billy Meredith, who subsequently moved across town to Manchester United.[16] A fire at Hyde Road destroyed the main stand in 1920, and in 1923 the club moved to their new purpose-built stadium at Maine Road in Moss Side.[17] In the 1930s, Manchester City reached two consecutive FA Cup finals, losing to Everton in 1933, before claiming the Cup by beating Portsmouth in 1934.[18] During the 1934 run, the club broke the record for the highest home attendance of any club in English football history, as 84,569 fans packed Maine Road for a sixth-round FA Cup tie against Stoke City – a record which stood until 2016.[19][20] The club won the First Division title for the first time in 1937, but were relegated the following season, despite scoring more goals than any other team in the division.[21] Twenty years later, a City team inspired by a tactical system known as the Revie Plan reached consecutive FA Cup finals again, in 1955 and 1956; just as in the 1930s, they lost the first one, to Newcastle United, and won the second. The 1956 final, in which the Blues defeated Birmingham City 3–1, saw City goalkeeper Bert Trautmann continuing to play on after unknowingly breaking his neck.[22] After being relegated to the Second Division in 1963, the future looked bleak with a record low home attendance of 8,015 against Swindon Town in January 1965.[23] In the summer of 1965, the management team of Joe Mercer and Malcolm Allison was appointed. In the first season under Mercer, Manchester City won the Second Division title and made important signings in Mike Summerbee and Colin Bell.[24] Two seasons later, in 1967–68, City claimed the league championship for the second time, beating their close neighbours Manchester United to the title on the final day of the season with a 4–3 victory at Newcastle United.[25] Further trophies followed: City won the FA Cup in 1969 and a year later triumphed in the European Cup Winners' Cup, defeating Górnik Zabrze 2–1 in the 1970 final. This was the club's only European honour until their triumph in the 2022–23 UEFA Champions League.[26] The Blues also won the League Cup that year, becoming the second English team to win a European trophy and a domestic trophy in the same season. The club continued to challenge for honours throughout the 1970s, finishing one point behind the league champions on two occasions and reaching the final of the 1974 League Cup.[27] One of the matches from this period that is most fondly remembered by supporters of Manchester City is the final match of the 1973–74 season against arch-rivals Manchester United, who needed to win to have any hope of avoiding relegation. Former United player Denis Law scored with a backheel to give City a 1–0 win at Old Trafford and confirm the relegation of their rivals.[28][29] The final trophy of the club's most successful period of the 20th century was won in 1976, when Newcastle United were beaten 2–1 in the League Cup final. A long period of decline followed the success of the 1960s and 1970s. Malcolm Allison rejoined the club to become manager for the second time in 1979, but squandered large sums of money on several unsuccessful signings, such as Steve Daley.[30] A succession of managers then followed – seven in the 1980s alone. Under John Bond, City reached the 1981 FA Cup final but lost in a replay to Tottenham Hotspur. The club were twice relegated from the top flight in the 1980s (in 1983 and 1987), but returned to the top flight again in 1989 under Mel Machin. Howard Kendall guided the club to top flight safety in 1990 and the club finished fifth in 1991 and 1992 under the management of active player Peter Reid.[31] However, this was only a temporary respite, and following Reid's departure Manchester City's fortunes continued to fade. City were co-founders of the Premier League upon its creation in 1992, but after finishing ninth in its first season, Peter Swales, club chairman since 1973, was replaced by club legend Francis Lee in February 1994 in a movement supported by fans. Despite this, they endured three years of struggle under Brian Horton and Alan Ball Jr. before being relegated in dramatic fashion in 1996. After two seasons in the First Division[a] and four different permanent managers, Lee resigned from his role as chairman midway through the 1998 season, although remained as a shareholder, as City fell to the lowest point in their history, becoming the second ever European trophy winners to be relegated to their country's third-tier league after 1. FC Magdeburg of Germany. After relegation, the club underwent off-the-field upheaval, with new chairman David Bernstein introducing greater fiscal discipline.[32] Under manager Joe Royle, City were promoted at the first attempt, achieved in dramatic fashion in the Second Division play-off final against Gillingham.[33] A second successive promotion saw City return to the top division, but this proved to have been a step too far for the recovering club, and in 2001 City were relegated once more. Kevin Keegan replaced Royle as manager in the close season, and achieved an immediate return to the top division as the club won the 2001–02 First Division championship, breaking club records for the number of points gained and goals scored in a single season in the process.[34] The 2002–03 season was the last at Maine Road and included a 3–1 derby victory over rivals Manchester United, ending a 13-year run without a derby win.[35] Additionally, City qualified for European competition for the first time in 25 years via UEFA fair play ranking. In the close 2003–04 season, the club moved to the new City of Manchester Stadium. The first four seasons at the stadium all resulted in mid-table finishes. Former England manager Sven-Göran Eriksson became the club's first foreign manager when appointed in 2007.[36] After a bright start, performances faded in the second half of the season, and Eriksson was sacked on 2 June 2008;[37] he was replaced by Mark Hughes two days later.[38] By 2008, Manchester City were in a financially precarious position. Thaksin Shinawatra had taken control of the club the year before, but his political travails saw his assets frozen.[39] Then, in August 2008, City were purchased by the Abu Dhabi United Group. The takeover was immediately followed by a flurry of bids for high-profile players; the club broke the British transfer record by signing Brazilian international Robinho from Real Madrid for £32.5 million.[40] There was not a huge improvement in performance compared to the previous season despite the influx of money however, with the team finishing tenth, although they did well to reach the quarter-finals of the UEFA Cup. During the summer of 2009, the club took transfer spending to an unprecedented level, with an outlay of over £100 million on players Gareth Barry, Roque Santa Cruz, Kolo Touré, Emmanuel Adebayor, Carlos Tevez, and Joleon Lescott.[41] In December 2009, Mark Hughes – who had been hired shortly before the change in ownership but was originally retained by the new board – was replaced as manager by Roberto Mancini.[42] City finished the season in fifth position in the Premier League, narrowly missing out on a place in the Champions League but qualifying for the UEFA Europa League.[43] Continued investment in players followed in successive seasons, and results began to match the upturn in player quality. City reached the FA Cup final in 2011, their first major final in over 30 years, after defeating derby rivals Manchester United in the semi-finals,[44] the first time they had knocked their rival out of a cup competition since 1975. The Blues defeated Stoke City 1–0 in the final, securing their fifth FA Cup and the club's first major trophy since winning the 1976 League Cup. On the last day of the 2010–11 season, City beat out Arsenal for the third place, thereby securing qualification directly into the Champions League group stage.[45] Strong performances continued to follow in the 2011–12 season, including a 5–1 victory over Tottenham at White Hart Lane and a record-equalling 6–1 win over Manchester United at Old Trafford, but a poor run of form in the second half of the season left City in second place, eight points behind United with only six games left to play. At this point, United suffered their own loss of form, dropping eight points in the space of four games, while City began a run of successive wins which saw both teams level on points with two games to go. Despite the Blues only needing a home win against Queens Park Rangers, a team in the relegation zone, they fell 1–2 behind by the end of normal time. However, two goals in injury time – the second by Sergio Agüero in the fourth added minute – settled the title in City's favour, making them the first team to win the Premier League on goal difference alone.[46] The following season, City were unable to replicate the previous year's success. After finishing second in the league, eleven points behind Manchester United, and losing the FA Cup final 0–1 to relegated Wigan Athletic,[47] Mancini was sacked.[48] He was replaced by Chilean manager Manuel Pellegrini.[49] In Pellegrini's first year in charge, City won the League Cup and regained the Premier League title on the last matchday of the season.[50][51] The team's league form then slowly declined over the next couple of years, as the Blues finished second in 2014–15 and then dropped to fourth in 2015–16, although the 2015–16 season would see City win another League Cup title and reach the Champions League semi-finals for the first time.[52] Pep Guardiola, former head coach of Barcelona and Bayern Munich, was confirmed to become Manchester City's new manager on 1 February 2016,[53] with the announcement having been made several months before Manuel Pellegrini left his position. Guardiola's first season in Manchester would end trophyless, with the Blues placing third in the league standings,[54] but the following season proved far more successful, as City won the Premier League title with the highest points total in history and broke numerous other club and English league records along the way.[55] This would prove to be the start of a period of unprecedented success for Manchester City under Guardiola. Between the 2017–18 and 2023–24 Premier League seasons, City won six out of possible seven league titles, only finishing second behind Liverpool in the 2019–20 season.[56] Guardiola also guided the Blues to silverware in domestic cup competitions, highlighted by four consecutive League Cup triumphs in 2018–2021.[57] During the 2018–19 season, City completed an unprecedented domestic treble of English men's titles.[58] Apart from winning all three of the major English football tournaments, they also won the Community Shield, the first time any team has ever held all four of England's primary football trophies at the same time.[59] On the continental stage, the club achieved breakthrough in 2020–21, reaching their first-ever Champions League final.[60] In an all-English affair, City lost 0–1 to Chelsea at the Estádio do Dragão in Porto.[61] The 2022–23 season turned out to be the greatest in the club's history, as Manchester City won their third consecutive Premier League title, the FA Cup final against rivals Manchester United, and their maiden Champions League title at the Atatürk Olympic Stadium in Istanbul against Inter Milan, thereby assembling a rare feat – the continental treble. The road to the Champions League victory included wins over European giants Bayern Munich, who were defeated 4–1 on aggregate,[62] and Real Madrid, who suffered a 1–5 aggregate loss at the hands of City.[63][64][65] The following season saw considerably less success for the Blues, as they won the UEFA Super Cup and FIFA Club World Cup for the first time and became the first English men's club to win four consecutive league titles.[66] City also advanced to the FA Cup final for the second straight year but lost in a rematch to rivals Manchester United. Manchester City's era of sustained competitive excellence coincided with charges of breaching Financial Fair Play (FFP) regulations. In 2020, the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) ruled that sanctions placed on the club by UEFA were not justified, overturning City's two-year European ban.[67] In 2023, the Premier League announced its own investigation of the allegations levied against Manchester City, charging the club with 115 breaches of its FFP rules up to the 2017–18 season.[68][69] Manchester City's home colours are sky blue and white. Traditional away kit colours have been either maroon or (from the 1960s) red and black; however, in recent years several colours have been used. The origins of the club's home colours are unclear, but there is evidence that the club has worn blue since 1892 or earlier. A booklet entitled Famous Football Clubs – Manchester City published in the 1940s indicates that West Gorton (St. Marks) originally played in scarlet and black, and reports dating from 1884 describe the team wearing black jerseys bearing a white cross, showing the club's origins as a church side.[70]: 14–15 The infrequent yet recurrent use of red and black away colours comes from former assistant manager Malcolm Allison's belief that adopting the colours of AC Milan would inspire City to glory.[71] Allison's theory seemingly took effect, with City winning the 1969 FA Cup final, 1970 League Cup final, and 1970 Cup Winners' Cup final in red and black stripes as opposed to the club's home kit of sky blue. City had previously worn three other badges on their shirts, prior to their current badge being implemented in 2016. The first, introduced in 1970, was based on designs which had been used on official club documentation since the mid-1960s. It consisted of a circular badge which used the same shield as the present badge (including a ship, based on the City of Manchester coat of arms), inside a circle bearing the name of the club. In 1972, this was replaced by a variation which replaced the lower half of the shield with the red rose of Lancashire. In 1976, a heraldic badge was granted by the College of Arms to the English Football League for use by City. The badge consisted of the familiar ship above a red rose but on a circular device instead of a shield (blazoned as \"A roundel per fess azure and argent in chief a three masted ship sails set pennons flying or in base a rose gules barbed and seeded proper\").[72] On occasions when Manchester City played in a major cup final, the club wore shirts bearing the City of Manchester coat of arms, as a symbol of pride in representing the city at a major event. This practice originated from a time when the players' shirts did not normally bear a badge of any kind.[73]: 21 The club has since abandoned the practice; for the 2011 FA Cup final, its first in the 21st century, City used the usual badge with a special legend, but the Manchester coat of arms was included as a small monochrome logo in the numbers on the back of players' shirts.[74] A new club badge was adopted in 1997, as a result of the previous badge being ineligible for registration as a trademark. This badge was based on the arms of the city of Manchester, and consisted of a shield in front of a golden eagle. The eagle is an old heraldic symbol of the city of Manchester; a golden eagle was added to the city's badge in 1958 (but had since been removed), representing the growing aviation industry. The shield featured a ship on its upper half representing the Manchester Ship Canal, and three diagonal stripes in the lower half symbolised the city's three rivers – the Irwell, the Irk and the Medlock. The bottom of the badge bore the motto \"Superbia in Proelio\", which translates as \"Pride in Battle\" in Latin. Above the eagle and shield were the three stars, added for decorative purposes. On 15 October 2015, following years of criticism from the fans over the design of the 1997 badge,[75] the club announced they intended to carry out a fan consultation on whether to discontinue the current badge and institute a new design.[75] After the consultation, the club announced in late November 2015 the badge would be replaced in due course by a new version which would be designed in the style of the older, circular variants.[76] A design purporting to be the new badge was unintentionally leaked two days early prior to the official unveiling on 26 December 2015 by the IPO when the design was trademarked on 22 December.[77] The new badge was officially unveiled at Manchester City's home match against Sunderland on 26 December.[78] Note: Flags indicate national team as defined under FIFA eligibility rules; some limited exceptions apply.

Since 2003, Manchester City have not issued the squad number 23. It was retired in memory of Marc-Vivien Foé, who was on loan to the club from Lyon at the time of his death on the field of play while playing for Cameroon in the 2003 FIFA Confederations Cup.[86] Note: Flags indicate national team as defined under FIFA eligibility rules; some limited exceptions apply.

Other players (vice-captains) have led the team on the pitch when the club captain is not playing or not available. Some players have been made captain on a one-off basis to celebrate or commemorate an event, e.g. Oleksandr Zinchenko captained the team in their 2021–22 FA Cup fifth round tie at Peterborough United in support of his country during the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine.[87] Each season since the end of the 1966–67 season, the members of the Manchester City Official Supporters Club have voted by ballot to choose the player on the team they feel is the most worthy of recognition for his performances during that season.

Even in the late 1990s, when City were relegated twice in three seasons and playing in the third tier of English football (then the Second Division, now the EFL League One), home attendances were in the region of 30,000, compared to an average of fewer than 8,000 for the division.[125] Research carried out by Manchester City in 2005 estimated a fanbase of 886,000 in the United Kingdom and a total in excess of 2 million worldwide, although since the purchase of the club by Sheikh Mansour, and City's recent achievements, that figure has since ballooned to many times that size.[126] Manchester City's officially recognised supporters club is the Manchester City F.C. Supporters Club (1949), formed by a merger of two existing organisations in 2010: the Official Supporters Club (OSC) and the Centenary Supporters Association (CSA).[127] City fans' song of choice is a rendition of \"Blue Moon\", which despite its melancholic theme is belted out with gusto as though it were a heroic anthem. City supporters tend to believe that unpredictability is an inherent trait of their team, and label unexpected results \"typical City\".[128][129] Events that fans regard as \"typical City\" include the club being the only reigning English champions ever to be relegated (in 1938), the only team to score and concede over 100 goals in the same season (1957–58),[130] or the more recent example where Manchester City were the only team to beat Chelsea in the latter's record-breaking 2004–05 Premier League season, yet in the same season City were knocked out of the FA Cup by Oldham Athletic, a team two divisions lower. In the late 1980s, City fans started a craze of bringing inflatable objects to matches, primarily oversized bananas. One disputed explanation for the phenomenon is that in a match against West Bromwich Albion, chants from fans calling for the introduction of Imre Varadi as a substitute mutated into \"Imre Banana\". Terraces packed with inflatable-waving supporters became a frequent sight in the 1988–89 season, as the craze spread to other clubs (inflatable fish were seen at Grimsby Town), with the craze reaching its peak at City's match at Stoke City on 26 December 1988, a game declared by fanzines as a fancy dress party.[131] In 2010, Manchester City supporters adopted an exuberant dance, dubbed The Poznań, from fans of Polish club Lech Poznań that they played in the Europa League.[132] In 2022, Manchester City proposed the release of the Connected Scarf, that would contain a sensor tracking physiological and emotional data of the wearer, for supporters in 2023.[133] Manchester City's biggest rivalry is with neighbours Manchester United, against whom they contest the Manchester derby. Before the Second World War, when travel to away games was rare, many Mancunian football fans regularly watched both teams even if considering themselves \"supporters\" of only one. This practice continued into the early 1960s but as travel became easier, and the cost of entry to matches rose, watching both teams became unusual and the rivalry intensified. A common stereotype is that City fans come from Manchester proper, while United fans come from elsewhere. A 2002 report by a researcher at Manchester Metropolitan University found that while it was true that a higher proportion of City season ticket holders came from Manchester postcode areas (40% compared to United's 29%), there were more United season ticket holders, the lower percentage being due to United's higher overall number of season ticket holders (27,667 compared to City's 16,481). The report noted that since the compiling of data in 2001, the number of both City and United season ticket holders had risen; expansion of United's ground and City's move to the City of Manchester Stadium have caused season ticket sales to increase further.[134] Over the last few years, Manchester City has also developed a notable rivalry with Liverpool,[135] currently considered one of the biggest in association football.[136][137] Though the two clubs had been involved in a title race in the 1976–77 season, Liverpool and City's modern rivalry began in the 2010s, with the Blues beating Liverpool to the 2013–14 title by just two points on the final day of the season.[138] In the final of the 2015–16 League Cup, City defeated Liverpool on penalties after a 1–1 draw. The two clubs met in European competition for the first time in the 2017–18 Champions League quarter-finals, where Liverpool won 5–1 on aggregate, ultimately reaching the final and then winning the competition a year later.[139][140] In the 2018–19 season, City again won the title on the final day, with the Blues' 98 points and Liverpool's 97 being the third- and fourth-highest Premier League points totals ever.[141] The following season, Liverpool clinched the title, recording 99 points (the second-highest Premier League total ever after Manchester City's 100 in 2017–18) to finish 18 points above runners-up City. The Blues then regained the title in 2020–21 and outgunned Liverpool in another closely-fought title race in 2021–22, to finish with 93 points to Liverpool's 92. The success of the two teams in the 2010s and 2020s has led to the development of a rivalry between Jürgen Klopp and Pep Guardiola, the managers of Liverpool and Manchester City, with the two previously having been the respective managers of Der Klassiker rivals Borussia Dortmund and Bayern Munich in the Bundesliga.[142] At the end of the 2018–19 season, Guardiola described his relationship with Klopp as a \"beautiful rivalry\" and called Klopp's Liverpool team \"the strongest opponents I have faced in my career as a manager\".[143][144] In September 2019, Klopp hailed Guardiola for being his 'greatest rival ever', after both were nominated for the FIFA Men's Coach of the Year award in 2019, which Klopp ultimately won.[145][146] In a 2019 survey, City fans answered that Liverpool, and not Manchester United, are the club's biggest rivals.[147] Manchester City also have long established local rivalries with Bolton Wanderers, Oldham Athletic, and Stockport County, and more recent competitive Premier League rivalries with Tottenham Hotspur, Chelsea and Arsenal.[148][149][150] The holding company of Manchester City F.C., Manchester City Limited, is a private limited company, with approximately 54 million shares in issue. The club has been in private hands since 2007, when the major shareholders agreed to sell their holdings to UK Sports Investments Limited (UKSIL), a company controlled by former Thailand prime minister Thaksin Shinawatra. UKSIL then made a formal offer to buy the shares held by several thousands of small shareholders. Prior to the Thaksin takeover, the club was listed on the specialist independent equity market PLUS (formerly OFEX),[151] where it had been listed since 1995. On 6 July 2007, having acquired 75% of the shares, Thaksin de-listed the club and re-registered it as a private company.[152] By August, UKSIL had acquired over 90% of the shares and exercised its rights under the Companies Act to \"squeeze out\" the remaining shareholders, and acquire the entire shareholding. Thaksin Shinawatra became chairman of the club and two of Thaksin's children, Pintongta and Oak Chinnawat became directors. Former chairman John Wardle stayed on the board for a year, but resigned in July 2008 following Nike executive Garry Cook's appointment as executive chairman in May.[153] The club made a pre-tax loss of £11m in the fiscal year ending 31 May 2007, the final year for which the club published accounts as a public company.[154] Thaksin's purchase prompted a period of transfer spending at the club,[155] in total around £30 million,[156] whereas over the several previous seasons Manchester City's net spending had been among the lowest in the Premier League. A year later, this investment was dwarfed by an influx of money derived from the club's takeover. On 1 September 2008, Abu Dhabi-based Abu Dhabi United Group Investment and Development Limited completed the takeover of Manchester City. The deal, worth a reported £200 million, was announced on the morning of 1 September. It sparked various transfer \"deadline-day\" rumours and bids such as the club's attempt to gazump Manchester United's protracted bid to sign Dimitar Berbatov from Tottenham Hotspur for a fee in excess of £30 million.[157][158] Minutes before the transfer window closed, the club signed Robinho from Real Madrid for a British record transfer fee of £32.5 million.[159] The wealth of the new owners meant that, in the summer of 2009, City were able to finance the purchase of experienced international players prior to the new season, spending more than any other club in the Premier League.[160] Created in the 2013–14 season to manage the global footballing interests of the Abu Dhabi United Group, City Football Group (CFG) is an umbrella corporation owning stakes in a network of global clubs for the purposes of resource sharing, academy networking and marketing. In addition to Manchester City, City Football Group owns stakes in a number of clubs: The City of Manchester Stadium in east Manchester, known as the Etihad Stadium since 2011 for sponsorship reasons, is on a 200-year lease from Manchester City Council to Manchester City. It has been the club's home since the end of the 2002–03 season, when City moved from Maine Road.[175] Before moving to the stadium, the club spent in excess of £30 million to convert it to football use: the pitch was lowered, adding another tier of seating around it, and a new North Stand was constructed.[176] The inaugural match at the new stadium was a 2–1 win over Barcelona in a friendly match.[177] A 7,000-seat third tier on the South Stand was completed in time for the start of the 2015–16 football season, increasing the stadium's capacity to 55,097. A North Stand third tier is in development, potentially increasing capacity to around 61,000.[178] After playing home matches at five stadiums between 1880 and 1887, the club settled at Hyde Road Football Stadium, its home for 36 years.[179] A fire destroyed the Main Stand in 1920, and the club moved to the 84,000 capacity Maine Road three years later. Maine Road, nicknamed the \"Wembley of the North\" by its designers, hosted the largest-ever crowd at an English club ground when 84,569 attended an FA Cup tie against Stoke City on 3 March 1934.[180] Though Maine Road was redeveloped several times over its 80-year lifespan, by 1995 its capacity was restricted to 32,000, prompting the search for a new ground which culminated in the move to the City of Manchester Stadium in 2003; it was renamed the Etihad Stadium in 2011.[181] In September 2024, Manchester City revealed plans to expand the North Stand of the Etihad Stadium, increasing the total capacity to 61,000. The expanded section is scheduled to open for the start of the 2025–26 season. The project also includes the construction of a hotel, office premises for club staff and a new fan zone.[182] Based on trophy count, Manchester City are one of the most successful teams in England – their thirty-six major domestic, European and worldwide honours rank them third on the list of most decorated sides in England, ahead of Chelsea with 34. The club's first major trophy was the 1904 FA Cup,[183] though they had previously won three regional Manchester Cups before that point.[184] Their first top division league title came in the 1936–37 season,[14] with the first Charity Shield won in the following August.[14] City's first League Cup and European trophy both came at the end of the 1969–70 season, the two trophies also constituting the team's first double of any kind.[14] In the 2018–19 season, City became the first team to claim all of the major English trophies available in a single season, winning not just the Premier League, FA Cup, and League Cup, but also the Community Shield.[185] The 1970 Cup Winners' Cup victory remained City's only European trophy until their triumph in the 2022–23 UEFA Champions League.[186][65] They have reached the semi-finals of the Champions League four times overall, losing in 2016, then winning en route to their first-ever final in 2021, losing in 2022, and winning en route to their maiden European Cup title in 2023.[187][188] Manchester City jointly held the record for most second division titles with Leicester City, both clubs having won the league on seven occasions, before Leicester clinched their eigth title in 2023–24.[189] Man City's first victory was in 1898–99, and the most recent in 2001–02.[14]",

                "content": "Jessica Ann Johnson (née Simpson; born July 10, 1980)[1] is an American singer, actress, and fashion designer. After performing in church choirs as a child, Simpson signed with Columbia Records in 1997, aged seventeen. Her debut studio album, Sweet Kisses (1999), sold two million copies in the United States and was led by the Billboard Hot 100-top three single \"I Wanna Love You Forever\". Simpson adopted a more mature image for her second studio album, Irresistible (2001), and its title track peaked within the top 20 of the chart. The album received gold certification by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). Simpson's third studio album, In This Skin (2003), sold three million copies in the United States. During her earlier career, Simpson became known for her relationship with and later marriage to Nick Lachey, with whom she also appeared on the MTV reality television series Newlyweds: Nick and Jessica (2003–2005). Following the release of her first Christmas album ReJoyce: The Christmas Album (2004), which was certified gold, Simpson made her film debut as Daisy Duke in The Dukes of Hazzard (2005). She also recorded a cover of \"These Boots Are Made for Walkin'\" for the film's soundtrack. In 2006, she released her fifth studio album, A Public Affair and appeared in the romantic comedy film Employee of the Month. With the release of her sixth studio album Do You Know (2008), she moved into the country music genre. A second Christmas album titled Happy Christmas followed in 2010. Simpson has sold 20 million albums worldwide.[2] Aside from her musical pursuits, Simpson launched The Jessica Simpson Collection in 2005, a fashion-focused line with 34 product categories which has earned over US$1 billion in revenue. She also starred in the reality television series The Price of Beauty in 2010 and judged clothing designs on two seasons of Fashion Star from 2012 to 2013. Jessica Ann Simpson was born on July 10, 1980, in Abilene, Texas.[1] She is the first child of Tina Ann Simpson (née Drew), a homemaker,[3] and Joseph Simpson, a minister. Simpson's parents married in 1978; they divorced in 2013.[4][5][6][7] Simpson has stated that she grew up in Dallas and Waco, but her parents now live in McGregor, Texas.[8] Simpson has a younger sister, Ashlee.[9] In her preteens she briefly attended Amelia Middle School while her father did outreach in Cincinnati, Ohio. After moving back to Texas 20 months later, she attended J. J. Pearce High School in Richardson during her teenage years, though she had to drop out in 1997 as her career began to take off; a year later she earned her GED via distance learning through Texas Tech High School.[10][11][12] Simpson was raised in the Christian faith, and was given a purity ring by her father when she was twelve years old.[13] Jessica and her family moved frequently due to her father's job as a minister, though they remained in Texas for the most part; however, they did live in the Midwest for a few years.[14] She began singing in the church choir as a child. When she was eleven, she dreamed of success as a singer while at a church retreat.[14] Simpson auditioned for The Mickey Mouse Club at the age of twelve, auditioning with a performance of \"Amazing Grace\" and dancing to \"Ice Ice Baby\" (1990).[14] She advanced through multiple rounds, eventually being a semi-finalist for the show alongside artists such as Britney Spears, Christina Aguilera, and Justin Timberlake.[14] Simpson claimed that she became nervous about her final audition after seeing Aguilera perform, and she was ultimately not selected for the show.[14] Simpson resumed performing in her church choir, being discovered by the head of a Christian music label eventually.[14] He asked her for an audition initially and signed her immediately after she performed \"I Will Always Love You\" (1973) by Dolly Parton.[14] She began working on her debut album with Proclaim Records and touring to promote the project.[14] Simpson's father later claimed that she had to quit touring as the size of her breasts led to her being deemed too \"sexual\" for the genre.[14] Her debut album, Jessica, remained unreleased after Proclaim Records went bankrupt; despite this, her grandmother funded a limited pressing of the album personally.[15][16] Shortly after this, Simpson landed several auditions as Jessica was sent to numerous labels and producers.[14] Ultimately, she caught the attention of Tommy Mottola, then married to Mariah Carey and the head of Columbia Records.[14] He went on to sign her to the label at the behest of Columbia talent scout Teresa LaBarbera Whites, claiming \"She had a great little look and a great attitude, a fresh new face, and something a bit different than Britney and all of them; she could actually sing.\"[14] Simpson began working on her debut album in Orlando, Florida.[14] Mottola hoped to market Simpson as a contrast to Spears and Aguilera, both of whom had launched successful careers focused on dancing and sexuality.[14] While working on her musical debut, Simpson enlisted her father Joe as her manager; her mother became her stylist.[17] While at a Christmas party in 1998, Simpson met 98 Degrees singer Nick Lachey, and the two began dating; Lachey claimed that he left the party and told his mother that he would marry Simpson someday.[14] Simpson began working on her debut studio album in 1998. Her debut single, \"I Wanna Love You Forever\", was released on September 28, 1999.[18][19] The single became a success, reaching number three on the Billboard Hot 100 chart in the United States.[20] The song earned a platinum certification from the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) for sales exceeding one million copies in the country.[21] Simpson's debut studio album, Sweet Kisses, was released on November 23, 1999.[22] The album sold 65,000 copies in its first week of release, debuting at number sixty-five on the Billboard 200 chart in the United States.[23] The album also saw success in several European countries.[24][25] The following year, \"Where You Are\" was released as the second single from the album; Simpson's boyfriend Nick Lachey was featured on the track.[26] Simpson went on to announce her plans to remain abstinent until marriage.[27] \"I Think I'm in Love with You\" served as the album's third and final single and achieved success in the United States.[28] With the success of the album's third single, Sweet Kisses rose to a new peak of number twenty-five on the Billboard 200 in August 2000.[28] The album sold over two million copies in the United States, earning a double platinum certification from the RIAA.[29] Simpson embarked on the Heat It Up Tour with her boyfriend's band, 98 Degrees, as their opening act to promote Sweet Kisses throughout 2000.[30] Work on her second album began in 2000; during the recording of the album, Simpson adopted a more mature public image.[31] In a July 2001, Simpson explained \"I recorded [Sweet Kisses] when I was seventeen years old and I'm twenty-one [this month] so there is four years of growth involved.\"[32] While working on the record, Simpson ended her relationship with Lachey to focus on furthering her career; however, the two reconciled romantically that September.[30] Simpson released the record's title track, \"Irresistible\" as the lead single from the project in April 2001.[33] The single became her second top twenty hit on the Billboard Hot 100 chart.[34][35] Simpson released her second studio album, Irresistible, on May 25, 2001.[36] The album sold 127,000 copies in the United States during its first week of release, debuting at number six on the Billboard 200 chart.[37] Though the album's first week sales nearly doubled those of her previous effort, Irresistible failed to match the success of her debut album; the record earned a gold certification from the RIAA for sales of 500,000 copies.[29] \"A Little Bit\", the album's second and final single, failed to achieve significant success. In July, Simpson began performing as a co-headliner on the Total Request Live Tour for the tour's first 14 dates, alongside artists such as Destiny's Child and Nelly.[38][39] On August 7, Simpson embarked on the DreamChaser Tour, a 15-date tour of North America.[40] Simpson announced her engagement to Nick Lachey in February 2002,[41] with the two holding their wedding ceremony on October 26 in Austin, Texas.[42] Simpson also began working on her third studio album in 2002. On July 14, 2003, she released the album's lead single, \"Sweetest Sin\", but the song failed to achieve commercial success. Beginning in 2003, Simpson and Lachey began appearing in the MTV show Newlyweds: Nick and Jessica.[43] The show premiered on August 19, 2003 and focused on the couple's marriage and the recording of Simpson's third studio album.[44][45] The show became a pop culture phenomenon instantly, with Simpson's perceived \"dumb blonde\" antics on the show helping to make the couple a household name.[46][47] The series was a ratings success for MTV and aired for three seasons until 2005.[47] Simpson released her third studio album, In This Skin on August 19, 2003. It was released the day that Newlyweds: Nick and Jessica premiered, with the show serving as a promotional tool for the record. In This Skin debuted at number ten on the Billboard 200, selling 64,000 copies in its first week of release.[48] The album's opening numbers served as the lowest of Simpson's career at the time, and by December 2003 had sold over 565,000 copies in the United States.[48] Simpson released \"With You\" as the second single from the album in October.[49] The single became a hit, reaching the top twenty of the Billboard Hot 100 and topping the Mainstream Top 40 chart based on radio airplay.[28] Simpson appeared in the halftime show of the Super Bowl XXXVIII. She recorded new material for a re-release of In This Skin, which was released in March 2004.[50][51][52] The re-release aided in album sales dramatically; In This Skin went on to sell three million copies in the United States.[53] In 2004 \"Take My Breath Away\" and \"Angels\" were released as singles from the re-release.[54] Simpson and Lachey starred in the ABC special The Nick and Jessica Variety Hour in April, which featured guest appearances by celebrities such as Jewel and Mr. T, among others.[55] That same month, with Randi Shinder, she launched the cosmetics line Jessica Simpson Dessert Beauty; all of the products in the line were edible.[56][57] Simpson embarked on the North American Reality Tour beginning in June through October; the tour was a financial success.[58] During this time, Simpson and her husband began making guest appearances on The Ashlee Simpson Show, chronicling the start of Jessica's sister's music career.[59] Simpson's fourth studio album, a collection of Christmas-themed songs titled ReJoyce: The Christmas Album, was released on November 23, 2004.[60] The album reached a peak of number fourteen on the Billboard 200, and was certified gold by the RIAA for sales exceeding 500,000 copies.[61] Also in 2004, Simpson filmed a sitcom pilot for ABC, which the network did not pick up.[62] In February 2005, Simpson and Shinder launched the Dessert Treats edible cosmetics line, similar to their prior line but targeted towards a younger audience. Following two lawsuits regarding copyright and accounting, both lines were discontinued.[56][63] Simpson performed \"The Star-Spangled Banner\" at the Indy 500 in 2005.[64] Simpson launched The Jessica Simpson Collection in 2005, initially partnering with Tarrant Apparel Group to release the Princy and JS by Jessica Simpson clothing lines.[65] The company has continued to grow throughout the years, and in 2014 was reported to earn $1 billion in annual sales.[66] Simpson made her film debut as Daisy Duke in the film adaption of The Dukes of Hazzard (2005).[67] While the film was met with negative reviews from film critics generally, it grossed over $111 million worldwide.[68] To promote the film, Simpson recorded \"These Boots Are Made For Walkin'\", a cover of the Nancy Sinatra song with additional lyrics.[69] The song entered the top twenty of the Billboard Hot 100, becoming one Simpson's most successful singles to date.[70] The music video, which featured Simpson in character as Daisy Duke, was controversial for featuring Simpson in \"revealing\" outfits and washing the General Lee car in her bikini.[71] In November 2005, Simpson and Lachey announced they were separating.[72] Simpson filed for divorce in December 2005, citing \"irreconcilable differences.\"[73] Their divorce was publicized worldwide and finalized on June 30, 2006.[74] Simpson began working on her fifth studio album in 2005. On March 28, 2006, Simpson announced that she had signed a new record agreement with Epic Records and would be departing from Columbia Records after having been with the label for seven years.[75] Simpson and stylist Ken Pavés launched a line of hair and beauty products on the Home Shopping Network in 2006.[76] On June 29, 2006, Simpson released the single \"A Public Affair\".[77] The song peaked at number 14 on the Billboard Hot 100, and earned a gold certification from the RIAA for sales exceeding 500,000 copies in the United States.[29] The single, an upbeat breakup song, was released the day before her divorce from Lachey was finalized.[77] On August 26, 2006, Simpson released her fifth studio album, A Public Affair. It debuted at number five on the Billboard 200 with first-week sales of 101,000 copies.[28] The album failed to match the success of In This Skin (2003), selling just over 500,000 copies in the United States.[29] The empowerment anthem \"I Belong to Me\", which served as the album's second and final single, failed to achieve commercial success.[78] Simpson starred alongside Dane Cook and Dax Shepard in the comedy film Employee of the Month, released that October.[79] The film received a negative critical reaction and failed to achieve commercial success.[80] Simpson performed a cover of the Dolly Parton song \"9 to 5\" as a tribute to the artist at the Kennedy Center Awards in December 2006, though her performance was cut from the broadcast.[81][82] Simpson had an on-again, off-again relationship with singer-songwriter John Mayer from August 2006 to May 2007.[83][84] Simpson described her relationship with Mayer in her 2020 memoir, Open Book.[83] In November 2007, Simpson began dating Dallas Cowboys quarterback Tony Romo. Cowboys fans considered the relationship controversial, as some blamed Simpson for Romo's poor performance in games after the pair got together. Some fans dubbed Simpson \"Yoko Romo,\" a reference to Yoko Ono, to whom many fans of The Beatles attributed the quartet disbanding in 1970.[85] Even then-president George W. Bush commented on the pair's relationship, blaming Simpson implicitly for Romo's lackluster performances.[86] Simpson and Romo ended their relationship in July 2009.[87] Simpson also appeared alongside Luke Wilson in the film Blonde Ambition (2007); it had a limited release in Texas before being released on home media.[88] Later, she starred in the direct-to-video film Private Valentine: Blonde & Dangerous (2008), portraying an actress who joins the military. The film received a negative reaction overwhelmingly upon its release.[89] Simpson collaborated with Parlux Fragrances to launch her first scent, Fancy, in 2008. The fragrance received a positive commercial reaction.[90] Simpson began working on her sixth studio album, a country music inspired record, in 2007.[91] Simpson claimed to have grown up around country music, and wanted to \"give something back.\"[92] She released \"Come On Over\" as the project's lead single on June 20, 2008.[93] The song debuted at number forty-one on the Billboard Hot Country Songs chart, making it the highest debut for an artist's first entry on that chart.[94] Do You Know was released on September 9, 2008.[95] The project sold 65,000 copies in its first week of release, debuting at number four on the Billboard 200 chart.[96] The album has sold just over 200,000 copies in the United States as of 2012.[97] Simpson opened for country music group Rascal Flatts on their Bob That Head Tour from January to March 2009.[98] Simpson's VH1 documentary series, The Price of Beauty, began airing in March 2010. The series followed Simpson around the world, introducing viewers to the different perceptions of beauty in different cultures.[99][100][101] The premiere episode attracted one million viewers.[102][103] Simpson revealed that the series would return in 2011 with a format change, but these plans never came to fruition.[104] On October 12, 2010, Epic Records released the compilation Playlist: The Very Best of Jessica Simpson, the final release of her three-album contract with the label.[105] Simpson signed a new recording contract with eleveneleven and Primary Wave Music and released her Christmas-themed seventh studio album. Happy Christmas on November 22.[106] It peaked at number 123 on the Billboard 200 chart.[107] Simpson began dating retired NFL tight end Eric Johnson in May 2010[108] and married July 2014 in Montecito, California.[109] The couple have three children: Maxwell Drew Johnson, born May 2012,[110][111][112] Ace Knute Johnson, born June 2013,[113] and Birdie Mae Johnson, born March 2019.[114] In January 2025, Simpson announced she and Johnson had separated.[115] In May 2012, Simpson appeared alongside Nicole Richie as a mentor on the NBC reality television series Fashion Star.[116] The series revolved around a group of designers who competed each week to create clothing; each week, the judges eliminated one contestant.[117] The series aired its second and final season in 2013.[118] Following Maxwell's birth, Simpson launched a maternity clothing line that year.[119] In August 2012, she released the perfume Vintage Bloom.[120] She introduced a bedroom decor line including bedding and draperies offered in a romantic bohemian style, with floral patterns.[121] In August 2014, Simpson released a signature fragrance named after her.[122] Simpson confirmed in 2015 that she would begin working on a new album and said that she was working with Linda Perry on the project.[123][124][125] In August 2015, Simpson was a host on the HSN channel while promoting her products.[126] Simpson launched her Warm Up brand of workout clothing, available at retailers in the United States.[127] She expanded the brand in August 2016 to include trainers.[127] On February 2, 2020, Simpson released her memoir Open Book, which topped The New York Times Best Seller list selling over 59,000 copies in its first week.[128][129] In the book, she discussed her marriage to Nick Lachey, her relationship with musician John Mayer, sexual abuse she experienced during her childhood, dependence on alcohol and prescription drugs, and body image issues.[129][83] Six new songs were released as part of the book, marking her first release of music since Happy Christmas in 2010.[129][130] Simpson has listed Whitney Houston,[131] Mariah Carey, Aretha Franklin and Sade as influences on her music.[132] She attempted to launch her career as a Christian music singer, and at one point completed a self-titled album of Christian music.[14] When she signed with Columbia Records in 1998, she began working on an album of pop music.[14] Simpson has recorded songs with Christian themes in later years, including \"Pray Out Loud\" (2008).[133] The music on her debut album consisted of pop ballads primarily, with the intention of showcasing Simpson's vocals.[134] AllMusic's Stephen Thomas Erlewine opined that the album \"position[ed] her as the teen Celine Dion\".[135] It featured the power ballad \"I Wanna Love You Forever\" (1999).[136] The work drew comparisons to Mariah Carey.[30] With the release of Irresistible (2001), Simpson recorded more upbeat songs, likening herself to artists such as Britney Spears.[137][138] Songs such as \"Irresistible\" and \"A Little Bit\" had more provocative lyrics in comparison to her previous release, with Simpson citing the age difference between the recording of the two albums as the main reason.[31] During the Total Request Live Tour (2001) and her DreamChaser Tour (2001), Simpson incorporated more choreography and backup dancers into her live performances.[139] Simpson began working on her third studio album in 2002 initially, on which rapper Missy Elliott would serve as the primary producer.[140] The record later took on a new direction, which her then-husband Nick Lachey described as \"organic\" in comparison to her two prior albums.[141] Simpson also began co-writing songs for the record, something she had been nervous to do in the past.[141] The result was In This Skin (2003), a record that AllMusic said \"stay[ed] within the contemporary dance-pop realm while inching toward the middle-of-the-road diva that she's always yearned to be.\"[30] Simpson worked with elements of country music with the release of \"These Boots Are Made For Walkin'\" (2005), recorded for Simpson's feature film debut The Dukes of Hazzard (2005).[142] She continued to experiment with the genre on the song \"Push Your Tush\" (2006). Numerous songs on her fifth studio album feature elements of dance and disco music, including \"A Public Affair\" and her cover of \"You Spin Me Round (Like a Record)\".[143][144] Inspired by artists such as Faith Hill, Shania Twain, and Martina McBride, Simpson recorded a country music album titled Do You Know (2008).[145] Throughout her career, Simpson has delved into other genres as well, releasing Christmas-themed albums in 2004 and 2010, respectively.[146] Simpson came to prominence as a teen idol in the late 1990s and the media described her as Columbia Records's \"blond response to Britney Spears and Christina Aguilera\", who had achieved recent success with their respective debut albums.[147][135] Her debut album, Sweet Kisses (1999) mostly explores themes such as love,[135] and Simpson announced that she would remain abstinent until marriage.[1][148] She went through a \"carefully orchestrated sexy makeover\" while she promoted her second album, Irresistible (2001).[148] Simpson later described Columbia's record executive Tommy Mottola as abusive, as he attempted to control her image and told her to \"lose fifteen pounds\" after she signed her contract in 1997.[147] Upon Simpson's rise to stardom with the success of Newlyweds: Nick and Jessica in 2003, media critics and the public perceived her as a \"ditzy blonde\" based on her antics and comments on the show.[149][150][151] The Washington Post's Emily Yahr called her \"one of our first reality TV stars, before anyone could absorb the psychological damage it could cause.\"[147] Simpson recalled her time in the show in her 2020 memoir Open Book, saying: \"Nowadays, I see so many people performing their identities on social media, but I feel like I was a guinea pig for that. How was I supposed to live a real, healthy life filtered through the lens of a reality show? If my personal life was my work, and my work required me to play a certain role, who even was I anymore?\"[147] The media also described her as a sex symbol.[152] Simpson's portrayal of Daisy Duke furthered her sex symbol image,[153] and she portrayed the character in her \"These Boots Are Made For Walkin\" music video, which presents \"footage of Simpson writhing suggestively against a suds-soaked motor vehicle.\"[154] The scene was parodied in Pink's \"Stupid Girls\" music video.[155] Simpson also appeared as Daisy Duke in several television commercials for Pizza Hut airing during[156] the Super Bowl in 2006 and 2007.[157] Simpson claimed that the \"[Daisy Duke] role created a \"gold standard\" that she would be judged by in the years that followed\",[153] and the media scrutinized her intensely following her weight gain in 2009.[158][159] Simpson endorsed George W. Bush during his presidential campaign in 2004,[160] though she canceled an appearance at a 2006 Republican fundraiser as she felt it was not \"appropriate\".[161] Simpson praised former First Lady Michelle Obama during her husband's time in office, stating, \"She's such an incredible woman, and she's with such a powerful man...Everything she does she exudes confidence.\"[162] In April 2004, Simpson performed in VH1's benefit concert Divas Live 2004 alongside Ashanti, Cyndi Lauper, Gladys Knight, Joss Stone and Patti LaBelle to support the Save the Music Foundation.[163] In May 2004, Simpson did a benefit concert to aid the Skin Care Foundation.[164] In March 2007, Simpson donated a new Chrysler minivan to the Elim orphanage in Nuevo Laredo. Simpson is Soles4Souls's Ambassador and participated in autographing shoes to donate the money from communities across the United States.[165] Simpson also works with Make-A-Wish Foundation.[166] Headlining Co-headlining Opening act",

The 28-year-old was claimed by the Texans on Dec. 23 after being waived by the Baltimore Ravens. \"With Diontae, unfortunately it didn't work out and we're on to the Chiefs,\" Texans head coach DeMeco Ryans said Tuesday after the news was announced. Johnson, according to KPRC2 Houston, was visibly frustrated after the Texans' playoff win over the Chargers, as teammates tried to calm the veteran down. He caught his only target thrown his way, and played just 16 snaps on offense, good for 22 percent of the playing time, per Aaron Wilson. Baltimore sent the Carolina Panthers a fifth-round pick in exchange for Johnson and a sixth-rounder in October, but Johnson was unhappy with his role in the offense. The wideout was even suspended for the Week 15 matchup against the New York Giants for conduct detrimental to the team before being cut. In the last calendar year, Johnson has suited up for the Pittsburgh Steelers, Panthers, Ravens and Texans. He's been traded twice and waived twice. Johnson now again hits the waiver wire, but it remains to be seen if there will be interest in him from one of the other five teams. He was viewed by some as a potential \"X-factor\" for a Texans playoff run since Houston found itself without Stefon Diggs and Tank Dell at wide receiver, but the team quickly came to the conclusion he was expendable. Houston will rely on John Metchie III, Robert Woods and Xavier Hutchinson behind Nico Collins at receiver. Johnson has caught 391 passes for 4,363 yards and 25 touchdowns in 77 career games played. He made the Pro Bowl with Pittsburgh in 2021 after catching 107 passes for 1,161 yards and eight touchdowns. © 2004-2024 CBS Interactive. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.

Initially, it appeared that Johnson could be someone to break out with a new team this season, but he instead got traded twice and cut once in a 10-month span. Johnson can still salvage his season by helping the Texans beat the Chargers in the wild-card round of the playoffs. The wide receiver could play a pivotal role on an injury-depleted Houston offense that struggled to close the regular season. How did a player as talented as Johnson end up on so many teams in such a short period of time? The Sporting News examines. SN'S PLAYOFFS HQ: Live NFL scores | Full NFL schedule | Updated NFL bracket Johnson played college football at Toledo, where he produced 1,278 receiving yards and 14 touchdowns in his redshirt sophomore season. He returned to school the following year and totaled 761 receiving yards, but his college production was enough for him to become a day-2 pick. The Steelers drafted Johnson in the third round of the 2019 NFL draft, using the No. 66 overall pick. Johnson was drafted just two picks after the Seahawks selected DK Metcalf and went 10 picks before Washington took Terry McLaurin. Johnson began his NFL career with the Steelers, playing 77 games over a five-year stretch as one of the team's primary pass catchers. His best season came in 2021 when he surpassed 1,000 receiving yards for the first time in his career and made his first and only Pro Bowl appearance. Before the 2022 season, Johnson signed a two-year extension with the Steelers worth $36.7 million, locking him in with Pittsburgh through the 2024 season. However, after Johnson had a disappointing 2023 season, the Steelers traded him to the Panthers for a draft pick swap. Carolina hoped that Johnson would provide stability in the passing game for young quarterback Bryce Young, but the Panthers' overall offense struggled in the first half of the season. With the team already out of playoff contention, the Panthers shipped him to the Ravens before the trade deadline, but Johnson only disappointed even more in Baltimore. Johnson recorded just one catch for six yards over four games with the Ravens and had several off-the-field issues with the team. In early December, Baltimore suspended Johnson for refusing to enter a game against the Eagles, and two weeks later, the Ravens cut him from the team outright. Meanwhile, the Texans dealt with a variety of wide receiver injuries in 2024 — Stefon Diggs and Tank Dell were among those to suffer season-ending injuries. In need of depth entering the playoffs, Houston claimed Johnson off waivers, hoping he can add something alongside Nico Collins. So far this season, while playing for three teams, Johnson has a career-worst 375 yards on 33 catches and three touchdowns. As an early third-round pick, Johnson made $4.3 million over his four-year rookie contract. When he signed an extension with the Steelers, he was set to make $36.7 million combined in 2023 and 2024. The second year of this extension has been split across three teams, with the Panthers, Ravens and Texans paying a portion of the deal. In total, Johnson has made $42.7 million between his rookie contract and extension, and the veteran wide receiver will hit free agency in the offseason.

                "content": "Filed under: Johnson has played on three teams this season and been ditched by all of them. Some players in the NFL had a rollercoaster of a season in 2024. Diontae Johnson was a runaway mine cart in the dark with people screaming at every turn. Johnson was cut by the Texans on Tuesday, which should end his season barring something dramatic happening. We have waived Diontae Johnson and made another roster move. pic.twitter.com/gjFKOc5COS Johnson’s downfall is something to be studied. He entered the year as the No. 1 receiver on the Carolina Panthers, believed to be integral to any success for Bryce Young in his second year — now he’s been cut by two different playoff teams, both of whom are still playing, and both who were in dire need of help at the position. So what exactly happened to take a former 1,000 yard receiver from the Steelers and turn him into a back-of-the-roster cast off before the age of 30? The simple answer is “attitude,” but there’s more going on here too. There’s no doubt Johnson was a tremendous talent for the Steelers, but he also had an incredible knack to alienate himself from teammates and coaches. In the span of five years since being drafted by the team in 2019 he managed to: Correct or not, the perception out of Pittsburgh was that Johnson was more concerned with his stats than helping the team win — and he didn’t want to hear anything from fans when they lost. The end result was the Steelers trading the difficult receiver to the Panthers, which was believed at the time to be a home run move for Carolina. A significant lack of weapons opened up a spot for him to be a true No. 1 receiver, but that didn’t work out either. Initially it all seemed like roses with the Panthers. Johnson was doing and saying the right things, coaches offered glowing praise of his play in training camp, and it seemed things were about to take a big step forward. When actual games started to take place it was clear things were bad. Johnson was frustrated from the jump, which all receivers tend to do when the offense is bad, but this crossed the line with him getting notably angry at Bryce Young for things outside of the young QB’s control. Johnson didn’t like how few deep throws were being called for him. He didn’t like when a QB went to their second or third option. He was visibly angry when coaches put in a package without him on the field. The experiment went bad, and after seven games the Panthers decided to trade Johnson for almost nothing, sending him and a 6th round pick to the Ravens for a 5th. The initial reaction was that Carolina got fleeced for getting so little in return, but little did we know. It seemed like a hand-meets-glove fit to put Diontae Johnson on the Balitmore Ravens. Not only was it poised to give Lamar Jackson the deep threat he’d been missing, but ostensibly coming from a fierce in-division rival was expected to give the Ravens information about the Steelers they didn’t have. Much like Carolina, Johnson was immediately frustrated with his lack of snaps. The team clearly had a pecking order, and Johnson was at the back-end of it. When it finally appeared like the team wanted to begin using him more, Johnson refused to enter the game against the Eagles and was suspended one game for conduct detrimental to the team. Johnson was released by the Ravens shortly after, making his stay in Baltimore last seven weeks. The Texans would be the next organization to step up, claiming Johnson off waivers. Another landing spot that seemed to make sense. With a season ending injury to Tank Dell the Texans were in need of receiving help, and Johnson made a lot of sense. We don’t know the full story in Houston yet, but we do know that Johnson made almost no impact during his time with the team. In the Wild Card Playoff game against the Chargers he played 16 snaps, finishing with one target for 12 yards receiving. Curiously this came after playing almost the entire game in Week 18 vs. the Titans, when C.J. Stroud was benched for the playoffs and Johnson was relegated to playing with backups. From what we know of Johnson’s history this would not have been up to his lofty standards, and that could be one of the reasons he was released for roster space just days before a critical playoff game. Someone could claim Diontae Johnson off waivers, but it’s unclear who would want the headache. He’s been a routine problem at every stop this season, and something needs to happen on a fundamental level if he hopes to get his career back on track. If he clears waivers he’ll be an unrestricted free agent, and someone will likely take a flier on him in 2025. Whether that leads to any kind of sustained success, or it’s simply another stop in a sad decline is another story. Check your inbox for a welcome email. Oops. Something went wrong.

                "title": "Michelle Obama - Wikipedia",
                "content": "Michelle LaVaughn Robinson Obama[1] (née Robinson; born January 17, 1964) is an American attorney and author who served as the first lady of the United States from 2009 to 2017, being married to Barack Obama, the 44th president of the United States. Raised on the South Side of Chicago, Obama is a graduate of Princeton University and Harvard Law School. In her early legal career, she worked at the law firm Sidley Austin where she met her future husband. She subsequently worked in nonprofits and as the associate dean of Student Services at the University of Chicago. Later, she served as vice president for community and external affairs of the University of Chicago Medical Center. Michelle married Barack in 1992, and they have two daughters. Obama campaigned for her husband's 2008 and 2012 presidential campaigns. She was the first African-American woman to serve as first lady. As first lady, Obama worked as an advocate for poverty awareness, education, nutrition, physical activity, and healthy eating. She has written three books including her The New York Times best selling memoir Becoming (2018) and The Light We Carry (2022). Michelle LaVaughn Robinson was born on January 17, 1964, in Chicago, Illinois, to Fraser Robinson III (1935–1991),[2] a city water plant employee and Democratic precinct captain, and Marian Shields Robinson (1937–2024), a secretary at Spiegel's catalog store.[3] Her mother was a full-time homemaker until Michelle entered high school.[4] The Robinson and Shields families trace their roots to pre-Civil War African Americans in the American South.[2] On her father's side, she is descended from the Gullah people of South Carolina's Lowcountry region.[5] Her paternal great-great-grandfather, Jim Robinson, was born into slavery in 1850 on Friendfield Plantation, near Georgetown, South Carolina.[6][7] He became a freedman at age 15 after the war. Some of Obama's paternal family still reside in the Georgetown area.[8][9] Her grandfather, Fraser Robinson Jr., built his own house in South Carolina. He and his wife LaVaughn (née Johnson) returned to the Lowcountry from Chicago after retirement.[6] Among her maternal ancestors was her great-great-great-grandmother, Melvinia Dosey Shields,[10] born into slavery in South Carolina but sold to Henry Walls Shields, who had a 200-acre farm in Clayton County, Georgia, near Atlanta. Melvinia's first son, Adolphus T. Shields, was biracial and born into slavery around 1860. Based on DNA and other evidence, in 2012, researchers said his father was likely 20-year-old Charles Marion Shields, son of Melvinia's master. They may have had a continuing relationship, as she had two more mixed-race children and lived near Shields after emancipation, taking his surname (she later changed her surname).[11] As was often the case, Melvinia did not talk to relatives about Dolphus's father.[12] Dolphus Shields, with his wife Alice, moved to Birmingham, Alabama, after the Civil War. They were great-great-grandparents of Robinson, whose grandparents had moved to Chicago.[12] Other of their children's lines migrated to Cleveland, Ohio, in the 20th century.[11] All four of Robinson's grandparents had multiracial ancestors, reflecting the complex history of the United States. Her extended family has said that people did not talk about the era of slavery when they were growing up.[11] Her distant ancestry includes Irish, English, and Native American roots.[13] Among her contemporary extended family is Rabbi Capers Funnye, her first cousin once removed born in Georgetown, South Carolina. Funnye is the son of her paternal grandfather's sister and her husband, and he is about 12 years older than Michelle. He converted to Judaism after college.[14][15] Robinson's childhood home was on the upper floor of 7436 South Euclid Avenue in Chicago's South Shore community area, which her parents rented from her great-aunt, who had the first floor.[3][16][17][18] She was raised in what she describes as a \"conventional\" home, with \"the mother at home, the father works, you have dinner around the table\".[19] Her elementary school was down the street. She and her family enjoyed playing games such as Monopoly, reading, and frequently saw extended family on both sides.[20] She played piano,[21] learning from her great-aunt, who was a piano teacher.[22] The Robinsons attended services at nearby South Shore United Methodist Church.[16] They used to vacation in a rustic cabin in White Cloud, Michigan.[16] She and her 21-month-older brother, Craig, skipped the second grade.[3][23] Robinson's father suffered from multiple sclerosis, which had a profound effect on her. Subsequently, she was determined to stay out of trouble and perform well in school.[24] By sixth grade, Michelle joined a gifted class at Bryn Mawr Elementary School (later renamed Bouchet Academy).[25] She attended Whitney Young High School,[26] Chicago's first magnet high school, established as a selective enrollment school, where she was a classmate of Jesse Jackson's daughter Santita.[20] The round-trip commute from the Robinsons' South Side home to the Near West Side, where the school was located, took three hours.[27] Michelle recalled being fearful of how others would perceive her, but disregarded any negativity around her and used it \"to fuel me, to keep me going\".[28][29] She recalled facing gender discrimination growing up, saying, for example, that rather than asking her for her opinion on a given subject, people commonly tended to ask what her older brother thought.[30] She was on the honor roll for four years, took advanced placement classes, was a member of the National Honor Society, and served as student council treasurer.[3] She graduated in 1981 as the salutatorian of her class.[27] Robinson was inspired to follow her brother to Princeton University, which she entered in 1981.[31][4] She majored in sociology and minored in African-American studies, graduating cum laude with a Bachelor of Arts in 1985 after completing a 99-page senior thesis titled Princeton-Educated Blacks and the Black Community under the supervision of Walter Wallace.[32][3][33] Robinson recalls that some of her teachers in high school tried to dissuade her from applying, and that she had been warned against \"setting my sights too high\".[34][35] She believed her brother's status as a student in good standing (he graduated in 1983) might have helped her during the admission process,[36] but she was resolved to demonstrate her own worth.[37] She has said she was overwhelmed during her first year, attributing this to the fact that neither of her parents had graduated from college,[38] and that she had never spent time on a college campus.[39] The mother of a white roommate reportedly tried to get her daughter reassigned because of Michelle's race.[31] Robinson said being at Princeton was the first time she became more aware of her ethnicity and, despite the willingness of her classmates and teachers to reach out to her, she still felt \"like a visitor on campus\".[40][41] There were also issues of economic class. \"I remember being shocked,\" she says, \"by college students who drove BMWs. I didn't even know parents who drove BMWs.\"[27] While at Princeton, Robinson became involved with the Third World Center (now known as the Carl A. Fields Center), an academic and cultural group who supported minority students. She ran their daycare center, which also offered after-school tutoring for older children.[42] She challenged the teaching methodology for French because she felt it should be more conversational.[43] As part of her requirements for graduation, she wrote a sociology thesis, entitled Princeton-Educated Blacks and the Black Community.[44][45] She researched her thesis by sending a questionnaire to African-American graduates, asking that they specify when and how comfortable they were with their race prior to their enrollment at Princeton and how they felt about it when they were a student and since then. Of the 400 alumni to whom she sent the survey, fewer than 90 responded. Her findings did not support her hope that the black alumni would still identify with the African-American community, even though they had attended an elite university and had the advantages that accrue to its graduates.[46] Robinson pursued professional study, earning her Juris Doctor (J.D.) degree from Harvard Law School in 1988.[47] By the time she applied for Harvard Law, biographer Bond wrote, her confidence had increased: \"This time around, there was no doubt in her mind that she had earned her place\".[46] Her faculty mentor at Harvard Law was Charles Ogletree, who has said she had answered the question that had plagued her throughout Princeton by the time she arrived at Harvard Law: whether she would remain the product of her parents or keep the identity she had acquired at Princeton; she had concluded she could be \"both brilliant and black\".[48] At Harvard, Robinson participated in demonstrations advocating the hiring of professors who were members of minority groups.[49] She worked for the Harvard Legal Aid Bureau, assisting low-income tenants with housing cases.[50] She is the third first lady with a postgraduate degree, after her two immediate predecessors, Hillary Clinton and Laura Bush.[51] She later said her education gave her opportunities beyond what she had ever imagined.[52] Michelle's mother, Marian Robinson, was a stay-at-home mother.[53] Her father was Fraser C. Robinson III, who worked at the city's water purification plant.[53] Robinson's father, Fraser, died from complications from his illness in March 1991.[54] She would later say that although he was the \"hole in my heart\" and \"loss in my scar\", the memory of her father has motivated her each day since.[39] Her friend Suzanne Alele died from cancer around this time as well. These losses made her think of her contributions toward society and how well she was influencing the world from her law firm in her first job after law school. She considered this a turning point.[55] Robinson met Barack Obama when they were among the few African Americans at their law firm, Sidley Austin LLP (she has sometimes said only two, although others have noted that there were others in different departments).[56] She was assigned to mentor him while he was a summer associate.[57] Their relationship started with a business lunch and then a community organization meeting where he first impressed her.[58] Before meeting Obama, Michelle had told her mother she intended to focus solely on her career.[59] The couple's first date was to Spike Lee's movie Do the Right Thing (1989).[60] Barack Obama has said the couple had an \"opposites attract\" scenario in their initial interest in each other since Michelle had stability from her two-parent home while he was \"adventurous\".[61] They married on October 3, 1992.[58] After suffering a miscarriage, Michelle underwent in vitro fertilisation[62] to conceive their daughters Malia Ann (born 1998) and Natasha (known as Sasha, born 2001).[63] The Obama family lived on Chicago's South Side, where Barack taught at the University of Chicago Law School. He was elected to the state senate in 1996 and to the U.S. Senate in 2004. They chose to keep their residence in Chicago after Barack's election rather than to move to Washington, DC, as they felt it was better for their daughters. Throughout her husband's 2008 campaign for U.S. president, Obama made a \"commitment to be away overnight only once a week – to campaign only two days a week and be home by the end of the second day\" for their two daughters.[64] She once requested that her then-fiancé meet her prospective boss, Valerie Jarrett, when considering her first career move;[19] Jarrett became one of her husband's closest advisors.[65][66] The marital relationship has had its ebbs and flows; the combination of an evolving family life and beginning political career led to many arguments about balancing work and family. Barack Obama wrote in his second book, The Audacity of Hope: Thoughts on Reclaiming the American Dream, that \"Tired and stressed, we had little time for conversation, much less romance.\"[67] Despite their family obligations and careers, they continued to try to schedule \"date nights\" while they lived in Chicago.[68] The Obamas' daughters attended the University of Chicago Laboratory Schools, a private school.[69] As a member of the school's board, Michelle fought to maintain diversity in the school when other board members connected with the University of Chicago tried to reserve more slots for children of the university faculty. This resulted in a plan to expand the school to increase enrollment.[4] In Washington, DC, Malia and Sasha attended Sidwell Friends School, after also considering Georgetown Day School.[70][71] In 2008, Michelle said in an interview on The Ellen DeGeneres Show that they did not intend to have any more children.[72] The Obamas received advice from past first ladies Laura Bush, Rosalynn Carter, and Hillary Clinton about raising children in the White House.[71] Marian Robinson, Michelle's mother, moved in to the White House to assist with child care.[73] Obama was raised United Methodist and joined the Trinity United Church of Christ, a mostly black congregation of the Reformed denomination known as the United Church of Christ. She and Barack Obama were married there by Rev. Jeremiah Wright. On May 31, 2008, Barack and Michelle Obama announced that they had withdrawn their membership in Trinity United Church of Christ saying: \"Our relations with Trinity have been strained by the divisive statements of Reverend Wright, which sharply conflict with our own views.\"[74] The Obama family attended several different Protestant churches after moving to Washington D.C. in 2009, including Shiloh Baptist Church and St. John's Episcopal Church on Lafayette Square, known as the Presidents' Church. At the 49th African Methodist Episcopal Church's general conference, Michelle Obama encouraged the attendees to advocate for political awareness, saying, \"To anyone who says that church is no place to talk about these issues, you tell them there is no place better – no place better, because ultimately, these are not just political issues – they are moral issues, they're issues that have to do with human dignity and human potential, and the future we want for our kids and our grandkids.\"[75] Following law school, Obama became an associate at the Chicago office of the law firm Sidley & Austin, where she met her future husband Barack. At the firm, she worked on marketing and intellectual property law.[3] She continues to hold her law license, but as she no longer needs it for her work, she has kept it on a voluntary inactive status since 1993.[76][77] In 1991, she held public sector positions in the Chicago city government as an assistant to the mayor and as the assistant commissioner of planning and development. In 1993, she became executive director for the Chicago office of Public Allies, a non-profit organization encouraging young people to work on social issues in nonprofit groups and government agencies.[26] She worked there nearly four years and set fundraising records for the organization that stood twelve years after she had left.[20] Obama later said she had never been happier in her life prior to working \"to build Public Allies\".[78] In 1996, Obama served as the associate dean of student services at the University of Chicago, where she developed the university's Community Service Center.[79] In 2002, she began working for the University of Chicago Hospitals, first as executive director for community affairs and, beginning May 2005, as vice president for community and external affairs.[80] She continued to hold the University of Chicago Hospitals position during the primary campaign of 2008 but cut back to part-time in order to spend time with her daughters as well as work for her husband's election.[81] She subsequently took a leave of absence from her job.[82] According to the couple's 2006 income tax return, her salary was $273,618 from the University of Chicago Hospitals, while her husband had a salary of $157,082 from the United States Senate. The Obamas' total income was $991,296, which included $51,200 that she earned as a member of the board of directors of TreeHouse Foods and investments and royalties from his books.[83] Obama served as a salaried board member of TreeHouse Foods, Inc. (NYSE: THS),[84] a major Wal-Mart supplier from shortly after her husband was seated in the Senate until she cut ties shortly after her husband announced his candidacy for the presidency; he criticized Wal-Mart labor policies at an AFL–CIO forum in Trenton, New Jersey, on May 14, 2007.[85] She also served on the board of directors of the Chicago Council on Global Affairs.[86] In 2021, the former first lady announced that she has been \"moving toward retirement\".[87] Though she continues to be active in political campaigns, the former first lady has said she is reducing the amount of work to spend more time with her husband.[87] During an interview in 1996, Michelle Obama acknowledged there was a \"strong possibility\" her husband would begin a political career, but said she was \"wary\" of the process. She knew it meant their lives would be subject to scrutiny and she was intensely private.[88] Although she campaigned on her husband's behalf since early in his political career by handshaking and fund-raising, she did not relish the activity at first. When she campaigned during her husband's 2000 run for United States House of Representatives, her boss at the University of Chicago asked if there was any single thing about campaigning that she enjoyed; after some thought, she replied that visiting so many living rooms had given her some new decorating ideas.[89][90] Obama opposed her husband's run for the congressional seat, and, after his defeat, she preferred he tend to the financial needs of the family in what she deemed a more practical way.[91] At first, Obama had reservations about her husband's presidential campaign, due to fears about a possible negative effect on their daughters.[92] She says that she negotiated an agreement in which her husband was to quit smoking in exchange for her support of his decision to run.[93] About her role in her husband's presidential campaign, she has said: \"My job is not a senior adviser\".[65][94][95] During the campaign, she discussed race and education by using motherhood as a framework.[43] In May 2007, three months after her husband declared his presidential candidacy, Obama reduced her professional responsibilities by 80 percent to support his presidential campaign.[19] Early in the campaign, she had limited involvement, traveling to political events only two days a week and rarely traveling overnight;[96] by early February 2008, her participation had increased significantly. She attended thirty-three events in eight days.[66] She made several campaign appearances with Oprah Winfrey.[97][98] She wrote her own stump speeches for her husband's presidential campaign and generally spoke without notes.[27] During the campaign, columnist Cal Thomas on Fox News described Michelle Obama as an \"Angry Black Woman\"[99][100][101] and some websites attempted to promote this image.[102] Obama said: \"Barack and I have been in the public eye for many years now, and we've developed a thick skin along the way. When you're out campaigning, there will always be criticism. I just take it in stride, and at the end of the day, I know that it comes with the territory.\"[103] By the time of the 2008 Democratic National Convention in August, media outlets observed that her presence on the campaign trail had grown softer than at the start of the race, focusing on soliciting concerns and empathizing with the audience rather than throwing down challenges to them, and giving interviews to shows such as The View and publications like Ladies' Home Journal rather than appearing on news programs. The change was reflected in her fashion choices, as she wore clothes that were more informal clothes than her earlier designer pieces.[89] Partly intended to help soften her public image,[99] her appearance on The View was widely covered in the press.[104] The presidential campaign was Obama's first exposure to the national political scene; she was considered the least famous of the candidates' spouses.[94] Early in the campaign, she told anecdotes about Obama family life; however, as the press began to emphasize her sarcasm, she toned it down.[83][93] New York Times op-ed columnist Maureen Dowd wrote: I wince a bit when Michelle Obama chides her husband as a mere mortal – a comic routine that rests on the presumption that we see him as a god ... But it may not be smart politics to mock him in a way that turns him from the glam JFK into the mundane Gerald Ford, toasting his own English muffin. If all Senator Obama is peddling is the Camelot mystique, why debunk this mystique?[94][105] On the first night of the 2008 Democratic National Convention, Craig Robinson introduced his younger sister.[106] She delivered her speech, during which she sought to portray herself and her family as the embodiment of the American Dream.[107] Obama said she and her husband believe \"that you work hard for what you want in life, that your word is your bond, and you do what you say you're going to do, that you treat people with dignity and respect, even if you don't know them, and even if you don't agree with them.\"[108] She also emphasized loving her country, likely responding to criticism for having said that she felt \"proud of her country for the first time\".[107][109][110] The first statement was seen as a gaffe.[111] Her keynote address was largely well-received and drew mostly positive reviews.[112] A Rasmussen Reports poll found that her favorability among Americans reached 55%, the highest for her.[113] On an October 6, 2008, broadcast, Larry King asked Obama if the American electorate was past the Bradley effect. She said her husband's winning the nomination was a fairly strong indicator that it was.[114] The same night she was interviewed by Jon Stewart on The Daily Show, where she deflected criticism of her husband and his campaign.[115] On Fox News' America's Pulse, E. D. Hill referred to the fist bump shared by the Obamas the night he clinched the Democratic presidential nomination, describing it as a \"terrorist fist jab\". Hill was taken off air, and the show was canceled.[116][117] Obama campaigned for her husband's re-election in 2012. Beginning in 2011, Obama became more politically active than she had been since the 2008 election, though avoided discussions about the re-election bid.[118] By the time of the election cycle, she had developed a more open public image.[119][120] Some commentators viewed her as the most popular member of the Obama administration,[121] noting that her poll approval numbers had not dropped below 60% since she entered the White House.[122] An Obama senior campaign official said she was \"the most popular political figure in America\".[123] The positive assessment was reasoned to have contributed to her active role in the re-election campaign, but it was noted that the challenge for the Obama campaign was to use her without tarnishing her popularity. Obama was considered a polarizing figure, having aroused both \"sharp enmity and deep loyalty\" from Americans, but she was also seen as having improved her image since 2008 when her husband first ran for the presidency.[121] Isabel Wilkinson of The Daily Beast said Obama's fashion style changed over the course of the campaign to be sensitive and economical.[124] Prior to the first debate of the election cycle, Obama expressed confidence in her husband's debating skills.[125] He was later criticized for appearing detached and for looking down when addressing Romney.[126][127] Consensus among uncommitted voters was that the latter had won the debate.[128] After Obama's speech at the 2012 Democratic National Convention, the first lady was found through a CBS News/New York Times poll conducted in September to have a 61% favorably rating with registered voters, the highest percentage she had polled since April 2009.[129] Obama aimed to humanize her husband by relating stories about him, attempting to appeal to female voters in swing states. Paul Harris of The Guardian said the same tactic was being used by Ann Romney, wife of 2012 Republican candidate Mitt Romney. Polls in October showed their husbands tied at 47% for the female vote. However, Michelle Obama's favorability ratings remained higher than Ann Romney's at 69% to 52%.[130] Despite Obama's higher poll numbers, comparisons between Obama and Romney were repeatedly made by the media until the election.[131][132] But, as Michelle Cottle of Newsweek wrote, \"... nobody votes for first lady.\"[133] During her early months as First Lady, Obama visited homeless shelters and soup kitchens.[134] She also sent representatives to schools and advocated public service.[134][135] Obama advocated for her husband's policy priorities by promoting bills that support it. She hosted a White House reception for women's rights advocates in celebration of the enactment of the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act of 2009 Pay equity law. She supported the economic stimulus bill in visits to the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development and United States Department of Education. Some observers looked favorably upon her legislative activities, while others said she should be less involved in politics. According to her representatives, she intended to visit all United States Cabinet-level agencies in order to get acquainted with Washington.[136] On June 5, 2009, the White House announced that Michelle Obama was replacing her then chief of staff, Jackie Norris, with Susan Sher, a longtime friend and adviser. Norris became a senior adviser to the Corporation for National and Community Service.[137] Another key aide, Spelman College alumna Kristen Jarvis, served from 2008 until 2015, when she left to become chief of staff to the Ford Foundation president Darren Walker. In 2009, Obama was named Barbara Walters's Most Fascinating Person of the year.[138] In her memoir, Becoming, Obama describes her four primary initiatives as first lady: Let's Move!, Reach Higher,[139] Let Girls Learn,[140] and Joining Forces.[141] Some initiatives of First Lady Michelle Obama included advocating on behalf of military families, helping working women balance career and family, encouraging national service, and promoting the arts and arts education.[142][143] Obama made supporting military families and spouses a personal mission and increasingly bonded with military families. According to her aides, stories of the sacrifice these families make moved her to tears.[143] In April 2012, Obama and her husband were awarded the Jerald Washington Memorial Founders' Award by the National Coalition for Homeless Veterans (NCHV). The award is the highest honor given to homeless veteran advocates.[144] Obama was again honored with the award in May 2015, accepting with Jill Biden.[145] In November 2013, a Politico article by Michelle Cottle accusing Obama of being a \"feminist nightmare\" for not using her position and education to advocate for women's issues was sharply criticized across the political spectrum.[146][147][148] Cottle quoted Linda Hirshman saying of Obama's trendy styles, promotion of gardening and healthy eating, and support of military families that \"She essentially became the English lady of the manor, Tory Party, circa 1830s.\"[146] A prominent critic of Cottle was MSNBC host Melissa Harris-Perry, who rhetorically asked \"Are you serious?\"[147][148] Supporters of Obama note that the first lady had been one of the only people in the administration to address obesity, through promoting good eating habits, which is one of the leading U.S. public health crises.[149] In May 2014, Obama joined the campaign to bring back school girls who had been kidnapped in Nigeria. The first lady tweeted a picture of herself holding a poster with the #bringbackourgirls campaign hashtag.[150] Obama writes in her book about enlisting help for her initiative Let Girls Learn to produce and sing the song \"This is for My Girls\".[151] Over the course of the Obama presidency, particularly during the second term, Michelle Obama was subject to speculation over whether she would run for the presidency herself, similarly to predecessor Hillary Clinton.[152] A May 2015 Rasmussen poll found Obama had 22% of support to Clinton's 56% of winning the Democratic nomination, higher than that of potential candidates Elizabeth Warren, Martin O'Malley, and Bernie Sanders.[153][154] Another poll that month found that 71% of Americans believed Obama should not run for the presidency, only 14% approving.[154] On January 14, 2016, during a town-hall meeting, President Obama was asked if the first lady could be talked into running. He responded, \"There are three things that are certain in life: death, taxes, and Michelle is not running for president. That I can tell you.\"[155][156] On March 16, 2016, while speaking in Austin, Texas, Obama denied that she would ever run for the office, citing a desire to \"impact as many people as possible in an unbiased way\".[157] In the epilogue to Becoming, Obama writes, \"I have no intention of running for office, ever,\"[158] recognizing that \"politics can be a means for positive change, but this arena is just not for me.\"[159] Obama's predecessors Hillary Clinton and Laura Bush supported the organic movement by instructing the White House kitchens to buy organic food. Obama extended their support of healthy eating by planting the White House Kitchen Garden, an organic garden, the first White House vegetable garden since Eleanor Roosevelt served as First Lady. She also had bee hives installed on the South Lawn of the White House. The garden supplied organic produce and honey for the meals of the First Family and for state dinners and other official gatherings.[160][161][162][163] In January 2010, Obama undertook her first lead role in an administration-wide initiative, which she named \"Let's Move!\", to make progress in reversing the 21st-century trend of childhood obesity.[162][164] On February 9, 2010, the first lady announced Let's Move! and President Barack Obama created the Task Force on Childhood Obesity to review all current programs and create a national plan for change.[165] Michelle Obama said her goal was to make this effort her legacy: \"I want to leave something behind that we can say, 'Because of this time that this person spent here, this thing has changed.' And my hope is that that's going to be in the area of childhood obesity.\"[162] Her 2012 book American Grown: The Story of the White House Kitchen Garden and Gardens Across America is based on her experiences with the garden and promotes healthy eating.[166] Her call for action on healthy eating was repeated by the United States Department of Defense, which has been facing an ever-expanding problem of obesity among recruits.[167] Several Republicans have critiqued or lampooned Obama's initiative. In October 2014, senator Rand Paul linked to Michelle Obama's Twitter account when announcing on the website that he was going to Dunkin' Donuts.[168] In January 2016, Chris Christie, Republican governor of New Jersey and presidential candidate, criticized the first lady's involvement with healthy eating while he was campaigning in Iowa, arguing that she was using the government to exercise her views on eating.[169][170] Obama had previously cited Christie as an example of an adult who struggled with obesity, a demographic that she sought to diminish by targeting children since Let's Move! was \"working with kids when they're young, so that they don't have these direct challenges when they get older.\"[171] In February, Senator Ted Cruz said that he would end Obama's health policies and return french fries to school cafeterias if his wife were first lady.[172] In the 2008 U.S. presidential campaign, Obama boasted to gay Democratic groups of her husband's record on LGBT rights: his support of the Illinois Human Rights Act, the Illinois gender violence act, the Employment Non-Discrimination Act, repealing the \"Don't Ask Don't Tell\" policy, and full repeal of the Defense of Marriage Act, civil unions; along with hate crimes protection for sexual orientation and gender identity and renewed effort to fight HIV and AIDS. They have both opposed amendments proposed to ban same-sex marriage in the federal, California, and Florida constitutions. She said that the U.S. Supreme Court delivered justice in the Lawrence v. Texas case, and she drew a connection between the struggles for gay rights and civil rights by saying, \"We are all only here because of those who marched and bled and died, from Selma to Stonewall, in the pursuit of a more perfect union.\"[173][174][175] After the repeal of Don't Ask Don't Tell on September 20, 2011, Obama included openly gay service members in her national military families initiative.[176] On May 9, 2012, Barack and Michelle Obama came out publicly in favor of same-sex marriage. Prior to this, Michelle Obama had never publicly stated her position on this issue. Senior White House officials said Michelle Obama and Senior Adviser Valerie Jarrett had been the two most consistent advocates for same-sex marriage in Barack Obama's life.[177] Michelle said: This is an important issue for millions of Americans, and for Barack and me, it really comes down to the values of fairness and equality we want to pass down to our girls. These are basic values that kids learn at a very young age and that we encourage them to apply in all areas of their lives. And in a country where we teach our children that everyone is equal under the law, discriminating against same-sex couples just isn't right. It's as simple as that.[178] At the 2012 DNC, Michelle said, \"Barack knows the American Dream because he's lived it ... and he wants everyone in this country to have that same opportunity, no matter who we are, or where we're from, or what we look like, or who we love.\"[179] In May 2009, Obama delivered the commencement speech at a graduating ceremony at UC Merced in Merced County, California, the address being praised afterward by students who found her relatable. Kevin Fagan of the San Francisco Chronicle wrote that there was chemistry between Obama and the students.[180] In August 2013, Obama attended the 50th anniversary ceremony for the March on Washington at the Lincoln Memorial. Positive attention was brought to Obama's attire, a black sleeveless dress with red flowers, designed by Tracy Reese.[181][182] Reese reacted by releasing a public statement that she was honored the first lady \"would choose to wear one of our designs during the celebration of such a deeply significant historical moment\".[183][184] In March 2015, Obama traveled to Selma, Alabama, with her family to commemorate the fiftieth anniversary of the Selma to Montgomery marches.[185] After President Obama's remarks there, the Obamas joined original marchers, including John Lewis, in crossing the Edmund Pettus Bridge.[186][187] In July 2015, Obama journeyed to Coachella Valley while coming to Los Angeles for that year's Special Olympics World Games.[188] In October 2015, Obama was joined by Jill Biden and Prince Harry in visiting a military base in Fort Belvoir, Virginia, in an attempt on the prince's part to raise awareness to programs supporting harmed service members.[189] In December 2015, Obama traveled with her husband to San Bernardino, California, to meet with families of the victims of a terrorist attack that occurred two weeks earlier.[190] On April 1, 2009, Obama met with Queen Elizabeth II in Buckingham Palace. Obama embraced her before attending an event with world leaders.[191] Obama praised her, though the hug generated controversy for being out of protocol when greeting Elizabeth.[192][193] In April 2010, Obama traveled to Mexico, her first solo visit to a nation.[194] In Mexico, Obama spoke to students, encouraging them to take responsibility for their futures.[195][196] Referring to the underprivileged children, Obama argued that \"potential can be found in some of the most unlikely places,\" citing herself and her husband as examples.[197][198] Obama traveled to Africa for the second official trip in June 2011, touring Johannesburg, Cape Town and Botswana and meeting with Graça Machel. Obama was also involved with community events in the foreign countries.[199] It was commented by White House staff that her trip to Africa would advance the foreign policy of her husband.[200][201] In March 2014, Obama visited China along with her two daughters Malia and Sasha, and her mother Marian Robinson. She met with Peng Liyuan, the wife of Chinese president Xi Jinping, visited historic and cultural sites, as well as a university and two high schools.[202][203] Deputy National Security Adviser Ben Rhodes said the visit and intent in Obama journeying there was to symbolize \"the relationship between the United States and China is not just between leaders, it's a relationship between peoples.\"[204][205] In January 2015, Obama traveled to Saudi Arabia alongside her husband, following the death of King Abdullah. She received criticism for not covering her head in a nation where women are forbidden from publicly not doing so,[206][207] though Obama was defended for being a foreigner and thus not having to submit to Saudi Arabia's customs,[208] even being praised in some corners.[209] Obama was neither greeted nor acknowledged by King Salman during the encounter.[210] In June 2015, Obama undertook a weeklong trip to London and three Italian cities. In London, she spoke with students about international education for adolescent girls and met with both British prime minister David Cameron and Prince Harry. She was joined by her two daughters and mother.[211] In November, she spent a week in Qatar, her first official visit to the Middle East. She continued advancing her initiative for international education for women by speaking at the 2015 World Innovation Summit for Education for her \"Let Girls Learn\" initiative in Doha, Qatar, and touring a school in Amman, Jordan, where she met with female students.[30][212][213] During the Qatar trip, Obama had intended to visit Jordan as well, but the trip was canceled due to weather conditions. In Jordan, Obama had intended to visit an Amman school that had been constructed with assistance from U.S. funds.[214] In March 2016, Obama accompanied her husband and children to Cuba in a trip that was seen by the administration as having the possibility of positively impacting relations between the country and America.[215][216] Later that month, the first couple and their daughters traveled to Argentina,[217] meeting with Argentine president Mauricio Macri.[218][219] Obama campaigned for Democratic candidates in the 2010 midterm elections,[220][221] making her debut on the campaign trail in Milwaukee, Wisconsin.[222][223] By the time she began campaigning, Obama's approval rating was 20 percentage points higher than her husband's.[224] Though Obama indicated in January 2010 that a consensus had not been made about whether she would campaign,[225] speculation of her involvement came from her large approval rating as well as reports that she had been invited to speak at events with Democrats such as Barbara Boxer, Mary Jo Kilroy and Joe Sestak.[226] She toured seven states in two weeks within October 2010.[227] Aides reported that, though viewed as essential by the White House, she would not become deeply involved with political discussions nor engage Republicans in public disputes.[228] After the elections, only six of the thirteen Democratic candidates Obama had campaigned for won. The Los Angeles Times concluded that while Obama was indeed more popular than her husband, her \"election scorecard proved no better than his, particularly in her home state\".[229] Obama was a participant in the 2014 midterm elections, held at a time where her popularity superseded her husband's to such an extent that it was theorized she would receive a much larger outpour of support in campaigning. Reporting her travel to Denver, Colorado, David Lightman wrote that while Democrats did not want President Obama to campaign for them, \"the first lady is very popular.\"[230] In May 2014, Obama was found to have a 61% favorable approval rating from a CNN poll, her husband coming in at 43%.[231] In a video released in July, as part of an effort to encourage voter turnout, she called on voters to be \"hungry as you were back in 2008 and 2012\".[232] Obama appeared at a fundraiser in Georgia in September for Democratic senate candidate Michelle Nunn. Obama's approach to campaigning in Georgia strayed from discussing current events and instead broadly stressed the importance of registering to vote and turning out during the elections.[231] Obama's infrequent appearances came from her dislike of being away from her children and Washington politics as well as her distaste for the opposition by Republicans to her husband's agenda and her view that Democrats in the U.S. Senate had not sufficiently been supporters of her initiatives to end childhood obesity.[233] Obama raised her profile in October,[234][235] touring three states in four days.[233] Obama called the elections her husband's \"last campaign\".[236][237] Obama endorsed Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton and made several high-profile speeches in favor of her, including an address at the 2016 Democratic National Convention in Philadelphia.[238] She also appeared multiple times on the campaign trail in either solo or joint appearances with Clinton.[239] On October 13, 2016, Obama heavily criticized Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump for the statements he made in a 2005 audio recording while at a Clinton rally in Manchester, New Hampshire.[240] A week later, Trump attempted to revive past comments Obama made in regard to Clinton during the 2008 presidential election.[241][242] With the ascent of her husband as a prominent national politician, Obama became a part of popular culture. In May 2006, Essence listed her among \"25 of the World's Most Inspiring Women\".[243][244] In July 2007, Vanity Fair listed her among \"10 of the World's Best Dressed People\". She was an honorary guest at Oprah Winfrey's Legends Ball as a \"young'un\" paying tribute to the \"Legends\" who helped pave the way for African-American women. In September 2007, 02138 magazine listed her 58th of \"The Harvard 100\"; a list of the prior year's most influential Harvard alumni. Her husband was ranked fourth.[243][245] In July 2008, she made a repeat appearance on the Vanity Fair international best dressed list.[246] She also appeared on the 2008 People list of best-dressed women and was praised by the magazine for her \"classic and confident\" look.[247][248] At the time of her husband's election, some sources anticipated that as a high-profile African-American woman in a stable marriage Obama would be a positive role model who would influence the view the world has of African Americans.[249][250] Her fashion choices were part of the 2009 Fashion week,[251] but Obama's influence in the field did not have the impact on the paucity of African-American models who participate, that some thought it might.[252][253] Obama's public support grew in her early months as First Lady,[134][254] as she was accepted as a role model.[134] On her first trip abroad in April 2009, she toured a cancer ward with Sarah Brown, wife of British prime minister Gordon Brown.[255] Newsweek described her first trip abroad as an exhibition of her so-called \"star power\"[254] and MSN described it as a display of sartorial elegance.[244] Questions were raised by some in the American and British media regarding protocol when the Obamas met Queen Elizabeth II[256] and Michelle reciprocated a touch on her back by the Queen during a reception, purportedly against traditional royal etiquette.[256][257] Palace sources denied that any breach in etiquette had occurred.[258] Obama has been compared to Jacqueline Kennedy due to her sense of style[246] and also to Barbara Bush for her discipline and decorum.[259][260] Obama's style has been described as \"fashion populist\".[51] In 2010, she wore clothes, many high end, from more than fifty design companies with less expensive pieces from J.Crew and Target, and the same year a study found that her patronage was worth an average of $14 million to a company.[261] She became a fashion trendsetter, in particular favoring sleeveless dresses, including her first-term official portrait in a dress by Michael Kors and her ball gowns designed by Jason Wu for both inaugurals.[262] She has also been known for wearing clothes by African designers such as Mimi Plange, Duro Olowu, Maki Oh, and Osei Duro, and styles such as the Adire fabric.[263][264] Obama appeared on the cover and in a photo spread in the March 2009 issue of Vogue.[265][266] Every first lady since Lou Hoover (except Bess Truman) has been in Vogue,[265] but only Hillary Clinton had previously appeared on the cover.[267] Obama later appeared two more times on the cover of Vogue, while First Lady, the last time in December 2016, with photographs by Annie Leibovitz.[268] In August 2011, she became the first woman ever to appear on the cover of Better Homes and Gardens magazine, and the first person in 48 years.[269] In 2013, during the 85th Academy Awards, she became the first first lady to announce the winner of an Oscar (Best Picture, which went to Argo).[270] The media have been criticized for focusing more on the first lady's fashion sense than her serious contributions.[51][271] She said after the 2008 election that she would like to focus attention as First Lady on issues of concern to military and working families.[249][272][273] In 2008, U.S. News & World Report blogger, PBS host and Scripps Howard columnist Bonnie Erbé argued that Obama's own publicists seemed to be feeding the emphasis on style over substance,[274] and said Obama was miscasting herself by overemphasizing style.[73][275] For three straight years – 2018, 2019, and 2020 – Obama topped the Gallup poll asking who is the \"most admired woman\" in the U.S.[276][277] Time magazine features an annual \"Person of the Year\" cover story in which Time recognizes the individual or group of individuals who have had the biggest impact on news headlines over the previous twelve months. In 2020, the magazine decided to retroactively choose a historically deserving woman for each year in which a man had been named Person of the Year, reflecting the fact that a woman or women had been named Person of the Year only eleven times in the preceding hundred. As part of this review, Michelle Obama was named the Woman of the Year for 2008.[278] In May 2017, during an appearance at the Partnership for a Healthier America conference, Obama rebuked the Trump administration for its delay of a federal requirement designed to increase the nutritional standards for school lunches.[279] In June, while attending the WWDC in Silicon Valley, California, Obama called for tech companies to add women for the diversifying of their ranks.[280] In July, Obama honored Eunice Shriver at the 2017 ESPY Awards.[281] In September, Obama delivered an address at the tech conference in Utah charging the Trump administration with having a fearful White House,[282] appeared in a video for the Global Citizens Festival advocating more attention to giving young girls an education,[283] and attended the Inbound 2017 conference in Boston.[284] During an October 3 appearance at the Philadelphia Conference for Women, Obama cited a lack of diversity in politics with contributing to lawmakers being distrusted by other groups.[285] In November, Obama discussed gender disparity in attitudes with Elizabeth Alexander while attending the Obama Foundation Summit in Chicago,[286] and spoke at the Bushnell Center for the Performing Arts in Hartford, Connecticut.[287] In April 2018, Obama responded to speculation that she might be running for president by saying she has \"never had the passion for politics\" and that \"there are millions of women who are inclined and do have the passion for politics.\"[288] On January 2, 2021, Obama encouraged Georgia residents to vote in the state's runoff in the U.S. Senate election and to contact VoteRiders, a non-profit voter ID education organization, to make sure they have the necessary ID to vote.[289] On January 20, 2021, Obama and her husband attended the inauguration of Joe Biden. Michelle Obama wore a matching plum coat, sweater, pants, and belt designed by Sergio Hudson to the inauguration.[290] In 2021, she was inducted into the National Women's Hall of Fame.[291] On April 28, 2023, Obama, along with actress Kate Capshaw, joined Bruce Springsteen on stage during his show in Barcelona where they provided backing vocals and tambourine on Springsteen's song \"Glory Days\".[292] Amid media speculation over the candidacy of President Biden, Obama's office announced in March 2024 that she would not be running for president in the 2024 United States presidential election.[293] According to a Reuters/Ipsos public opinion poll among 892 registered voters released on July 2, 2024, Michelle Obama was the only listed Democrat option who would defeat Trump in a confrontation, with 50% of the votes for Obama versus 39% for Trump. 55% of the voters also had a favourable view of Obama versus 42% toward Trump.[294][295] On August 20, 2024, Obama gave the next-to-last address on the second night of the 2024 Democratic National Convention and then introduced the final speaker, her husband, former president Barack Obama. The New York Times called her speech \"electrifying\" and suggested she had outshone her husband.[296] Obama's memoir, Becoming, was released in November 2018.[297] By November 2019, it had sold 11.5 million copies.[298] A documentary titled Becoming, which chronicles Obama's book tour promoting the memoir, was released on Netflix on May 6, 2020.[299][300] She received the Grammy Award for Best Audio Book, Narration & Storytelling Recording in 2020.[301] In July 2020, she premiered a podcast titled The Michelle Obama Podcast.[302][303] In February 2021, Obama was announced as an executive producer and presenter on a children's cooking show, Waffles + Mochi.[304] It was released by Netflix on March 16, 2021.[305][306] On September 11, 2021, the Obamas attended a 9/11 memorial to commemorate the 20th anniversary of the attacks.[307] More recently, Regina Hicks had signed a deal with Netflix alongside her and Barack's Higher Ground production company to develop comedies.[308] She received two Children's and Family Emmy Awards at the 1st Children's and Family Emmy Awards: for Outstanding Short Form Program (We the People) and Outstanding Preschool Animated Series (Ada Twist, Scientist).[309] Obama has made occasional guest appearances on TV shows, often portraying herself: iCarly in 2012, Parks and Recreation in 2014, NCIS in 2016, and Black-ish in 2022. She received a Black Reel Awards for Television nomination for Outstanding Guest Actress, Comedy Series for her role in Black-ish.[310] She produced the documentary film Crip Camp (2020) and the biographical drama film Rustin (2023). On July 21, 2022, it was announced that Obama's next book, The Light We Carry: Overcoming in Uncertain Times, would be published in November 2022.[311] The book was published by Penguin Random House.[312] In 2023, Obama received Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Hosted Nonfiction Series or Special nomination at the 75th Primetime Creative Arts Emmy Awards for the Netflix documentary film The Light We Carry: Michelle Obama and Oprah Winfrey.[313] In November 2023, Obama was named to the BBC's 100 Women list.[314]",

                "content": "The White House 1600 Pennsylvania Ave NW Washington, DC 20500 First Lady Michelle LaVaughn Robinson Obama is a lawyer, writer, and the wife of the 44th President, Barack Obama. She is the first African-American First Lady of the United States. Through her four main initiatives, she became a role model for women and an advocate for healthy families, service members and their families, higher education, and international adolescent girls education. Each of us also comes here tonight,” Michelle Obama told the Democratic National Convention in 2008, “by way of our own improbable journey” and “driven by a simple belief that . . . we have an obligation to fight for the world as it should be.” Michelle Obama’s journey began in the South Side of Chicago, where Fraser and Marian Robinson instilled in their daughter a heartfelt commitment to family, hard work, and education. Her father was a pump operator for the Chicago Water Department, while her mother stayed at home to care for Michelle and her older brother Craig. As she watched her father refuse to give in to multiple sclerosis, use two canes to get to his job, and save money to send her to college, she learned that “the only limit to the height of your achievements is the reach of your dreams and your willingness to work hard for them.” Michelle earned a bachelor’s degree from Princeton University and a juris doctor degree from Harvard Law School. In 1988, she returned to Chicago to join the firm of Sidley Austin. It was there that she met Barack Obama, a summer associate she was assigned to advise. They were married in 1992. By that time Michelle had turned her energies to public service. She was assistant commissioner of planning and development in Chicago’s City Hall before becoming the founding executive director of the Chicago chapter of Public Allies, an AmeriCorps program that prepares young people for public service. In 1996, she joined the University of Chicago as associate dean of student services, where she developed the university’s first community service program. In 2002, she went to work for the University of Chicago Medical Center, where in 2005 she became the vice president of community and external affairs. During these years the Obamas’ daughters Malia and Sasha were born. As first lady, Michelle Obama initiated Let’s Move! a program aiming to end childhood obesity within a generation. Through it, elected officials, business leaders, educators, parents, and faith leaders worked together to provide more nutritious food in schools, bring healthy and affordable food into underserved communities, plant vegetable gardens across America, and provide new opportunities for kids to be more active. Each year local schoolchildren helped plant and harvest the garden she started on the White House South Lawn. Its vegetables and fruits were served at the White House and donated to soup kitchens and food banks. During Barack Obama’s second term Michelle spearheaded the Reach Higher Initiative to help students understand job opportunities and the education and skills they need for those jobs. She encouraged young people to continue their education past high school in technical schools and community colleges as well as at colleges and universities. Worldwide, she championed the education of girls and women. In a commencement address at the City College of New York she told graduates, “Never view your challenges as obstacles.” It is a lesson she has embodied all her life. Throughout her time in the White House Mrs. Obama worked to support veterans and military families. She also focused her energies on what she calls her most important role: MominChief to her daughters, who grew into accomplished young women during their eight years in the White House.

                "content": "Jump to main content Jump to navigation First Lady Michelle LaVaughn Robinson Obama is a lawyer, writer, and the wife of the 44th and current President, Barack Obama. She is the first African-American First Lady of the United States. Through her four main initiatives, she has become a role model for women and an advocate for healthy families, service members and their families, higher education, and international adolescent girls education. When people ask First Lady Michelle Obama to describe herself, she doesn't hesitate to say that first and foremost, she is Malia and Sasha's mom. But before she was a mother — or a wife, lawyer, or public servant — she was Fraser and Marian Robinson's daughter. The Robinsons lived in a brick bungalow on the South Side of Chicago. Fraser was a pump operator for the Chicago Water Department, and despite being diagnosed with multiple sclerosis at a young age, he hardly ever missed a day of work. Marian stayed home to raise Michelle and her older brother Craig, skillfully managing a busy household filled with love, laughter, and important life lessons. A product of Chicago public schools, Michelle Robinson studied sociology and African-American studies at Princeton University. After graduating from Harvard Law School in 1988, she joined the Chicago law firm Sidley & Austin, where she later met Barack Obama, the man who would become the love of her life. After a few years, Mrs. Obama decided her true calling was working with people to serve their communities and their neighbors. She served as assistant commissioner of planning and development in Chicago's City Hall before becoming the founding executive director of the Chicago chapter of Public Allies, an AmeriCorps program that prepares youth for public service. In 1996, Mrs. Obama joined the University of Chicago with a vision of bringing campus and community together. As Associate Dean of Student Services, she developed the university's first community service program, and under her leadership as Vice President of Community and External Affairs for the University of Chicago Medical Center, volunteerism skyrocketed. Mrs. Obama has continued her efforts to support and inspire young people during her time as First Lady. In 2010, she launched Let’s Move!, bringing together community leaders, educators, medical professionals, parents, and others in a nationwide effort to address the challenge of childhood obesity. Let’s Move! has an ambitious goal: to solve the epidemic of childhood obesity within a generation. Whether it's providing healthier food in our schools, helping kids be more physically active, or urging companies to market healthier foods to our children, Let’s Move! is focused on giving parents the support they need to make healthier choices for their kids. In 2011, Mrs. Obama and Dr. Jill Biden came together to launch Joining Forces, a nationwide initiative calling all Americans to rally around service members, veterans, and their families and support them through wellness, education, and employment opportunities. Joining Forces works hand in hand with the public and private sector to ensure that service members, veterans, and their families have the tools they need to succeed throughout their lives. In 2014, Mrs. Obama launched the Reach Higher Initiative, an effort to inspire young people across America to take charge of their future by completing their education past high school, whether at a professional training program, a community college, or a four-year college or university. Reach Higher aims to ensure that all students understand what they need to complete their education by working to expose students to college and career opportunities; helping them understand financial aid eligibility; encouraging academic planning and summer learning opportunities; and supporting high school counselors who do essential work to help students get into college. In 2015, Mrs. Obama joined President Obama to launch Let Girls Learn, a U.S. government-wide initiative to help girls around the world go to school and stay in school. As part of this effort, Mrs. Obama is calling on countries across the globe to help educate and empower young women, and she is sharing the stories and struggles of these young women with young people here at home to inspire them to commit to their own education. As First Lady, Mrs. Obama looks forward to continuing her work on the issues close to her heart — supporting military families, helping children lead healthier lives, and encouraging all our young people to fulfill their boundless promise.",

                "content": "Michelle LaVaughn Robinson Obama[1] (born January 17, 1964) is an American lawyer and author. She was the first lady of the United States from 2009 to 2017 as the wife of Barack Obama, the 44th U.S. president. She was also the first African-American first lady in U.S. history. As first lady, Obama was seen as a role model for women. She worked as an advocate for poverty awareness, education, nutrition, physical activity, and healthy eating. She supported American designers and was considered a fashion icon.[2] Michelle LaVaughn Robinson was born on January 17, 1964, at Provident Hospital of Cook County in Chicago, Illinois,[3] to Fraser Robinson III,[4] a city water plant employee and Marian Shields Robinson.[5] Her mother was a full-time homemaker until Robinson entered high school.[6] By sixth grade, Robinson attended Mawr Elementary School.[7] She attended Whitney Young High School,[8] where she was on the honor roll for four years, took advanced placement classes, was a member of the National Honor Society and served as student council treasurer.[9] She graduated in 1981. Robinson enrolled into Princeton University in 1981.[10][11] She majored in sociology and minored in African-American studies and graduated with a Bachelor of Arts in 1985.[12][13][14] While at Princeton, Robinson became involved with the Third World Center, an academic and cultural group who supported minority students. She ran their daycare center, which also offered after school tutoring for older children.[15] As part of her requirements for graduation, she wrote a sociology thesis, titled Princeton-Educated Blacks and the Black Community.[16][17] Robinson pursued professional study, earning her Juris Doctor degree from Harvard Law School in 1988.[18] At Harvard, Robinson participated in demonstrations advocating the hiring of professors who were members of minority groups.[19] She worked for the Harvard Legal Aid Bureau, assisting low-income tenants with housing cases.[20] Following law school, Obama became an associate at the Chicago office of the law firm Sidley & Austin, where she worked on marketing and property law.[21] In 1993, she became executive director for the Chicago office of Public Allies, a non-profit organization encouraging young people to work on social issues in nonprofit groups and government agencies.[22] In 1996, Obama served as the Associate Dean of Student Services at the University of Chicago.[23] In 2002, she began working for the University of Chicago Hospitals, first as executive director for community affairs and, beginning May 2005, as vice president for Community and External Affairs.[24] Robinson met Barack Obama when they were among the few African Americans at their law firm, Sidley Austin LLP.[25] Their relationship started with a business lunch and then a community organization meeting.[26] They got married on October 3, 1992.[26] Their first daughter, Malia Ann was born in July 1998 and their second daughter, Sasha was born June 2001.[27] Obama became the first lady of the United States when her husband was sworn in as the 44th president on January 20, 2009. She became the first African-American first lady in American history. As first lady, Obama visited homeless shelters and soup kitchens.[28] She also sent representatives to schools and advocated public service.[28][29] Obama's initiatives as first lady were: Let's Move!, Reach Higher,[30] Let Girls Learn,[31] and Joining Forces.[32] Some initiatives included advocating for military families.[33][34] She made supporting military families and spouses a personal mission and increasingly bonded with military families.[34] In January 2010, Obama started an initiative, which she named \"Let's Move!\", to make progress in reversing the 21st-century trend of childhood obesity.[35][36] On February 9, 2010, President Barack Obama created the Task Force on Childhood Obesity to review all current programs and create a national plan for change.[37] In 2010, she wore clothes, many high end, from more than fifty designer companies.[38] She wore sleeveless dresses by Michael Kors, and her ball gowns designed by Jason Wu for both inaugurals.[39] She has also been known for wearing clothes by African designers such as Mimi Plange, Duro Olowu, Maki Oh, and Osei Duro.[40][41] Obama appeared on the cover in the March 2009 issue of Vogue.[42][43] She later appeared two more times on the cover of Vogue, while first lady, the last time in December 2016, with photographs by Annie Leibovitz.[44] In August 2011, she became the first woman ever to appear on the cover of Better Homes and Gardens magazine.[45] In 2021, she was inducted into the National Women's Hall of Fame.[46] Obama's memoir, Becoming, was released in November 2018.[47] By November 2019, it had sold 11.5 million copies.[48] A documentary titled Becoming, which chronicles Obama's book tour promoting the memoir, was released on Netflix on May 6, 2020.[49][50] She received Grammy Award for Best Audio Book, Narration & Storytelling Recording in 2020 for audio book.[51] In July 2020, she premiered a podcast titled The Michelle Obama Podcast.[52][53] In February 2021, Obama was announced as an executive producer and presenter on a children's cooking show, Waffles + Mochi.[54] It was released by Netflix on March 16, 2021.[55][56] On July 21, 2022, it was announced that Obama's next book, The Light We Carry: Overcoming in Uncertain Times, would be published in November 2022.[57] The book was published by Penguin Random House.[58] In 2023, Obama received a Emmy Award for the Netflix documentary film The Light We Carry: Michelle Obama and Oprah Winfrey.[59] In November 2023, Obama was named to the BBC's 100 Women list.[60] Time magazine features an annual \"Person of the Year\" cover story in which Time recognizes the individual or group of individuals who have had the biggest impact on news headlines over the previous twelve months.

                "content": "The Cleveland Cavaliers, often referred to as the Cavs, are an American professional basketball team based in Cleveland. The Cavaliers compete in the National Basketball Association (NBA) as a member of the Central Division of the Eastern Conference. The team began play as an expansion team in 1970, along with the Portland Trail Blazers and Buffalo Braves. Home games were first held at Cleveland Arena from 1970 to 1974, followed by the Richfield Coliseum from 1974 to 1994. Since 1994, the Cavs have played home games at Rocket Mortgage FieldHouse in downtown Cleveland, which is shared with the Cleveland Monsters of the American Hockey League. Dan Gilbert has owned the team since March 2005. The Cavaliers opened their inaugural season by losing their first 15 games and struggled in their early years, placing no better than sixth in the Eastern Conference during their first five seasons. The team won their first Central Division title in 1976, which also marked the first winning season and playoff appearance in franchise history, where they advanced to the Eastern Conference Finals. The franchise was purchased by Ted Stepien in 1980. Stepien's tenure as owner was marked by six coaching changes, questionable trades and draft decisions, and poor attendance, leading to $15 million in financial losses. The Cavs went 66–180 over the course of those three seasons and endured a 24-game losing streak spanning the 1981–82 and 1982–83 seasons. George and Gordon Gund purchased the franchise in 1983. During the latter half of the 1980s and through much of the 1990s, the Cavs were a regular playoff contender – led by players such as Mark Price and Brad Daugherty – and advanced to the Eastern Conference Finals in 1992. After the team's playoff appearance in the 1997–98 season, however, the Cavs had six consecutive losing seasons with no playoff action. Cleveland was awarded with the top overall pick in the 2003 draft, and they selected LeBron James. Behind James and Zydrunas Ilgauskas, the Cavaliers again became a regular playoff contender by 2005. They made their first appearance in the NBA Finals in 2007 after winning the first Eastern Conference championship in franchise history. After failing to return to the NBA Finals in the ensuing three seasons, James joined the Miami Heat in 2010. As a result, the Cavaliers finished the 2010–11 season last in the conference, enduring a 26-game losing streak, the third-longest in NBA history. Between 2010 and 2014, however, the team won the top pick in the NBA draft lottery three times – first in 2011 where they selected Kyrie Irving, and again in 2013 and 2014. After four seasons with the Heat and having won back-to-back titles in the 2011–12 and 2012–13 seasons, James returned to the Cavs in 2014 and led the team to four straight NBA Finals appearances. In 2016, the Cavaliers won their first NBA Championship, marking Cleveland's first major sports title since 1964. The 2016 NBA Finals victory over the Golden State Warriors marked the first time in Finals history a team had come back to win the series after trailing, 3–1. The Cavaliers have 23 playoff appearances and have won seven Central Division titles, five Eastern Conference titles and one NBA title. The Cavaliers began play in the 1970–71 season as an expansion team.[9] They set losing records in each of their first five seasons before winning their first division title in 1976.[10][11][12][13][14][15][16] The 1976 team was led by Austin Carr, Bobby \"Bingo\" Smith, Jim Chones, Dick Snyder, Nate Thurmond and head coach Bill Fitch.[17] It was remembered for the \"Miracle at Richfield\", in which the Cavaliers defeated the Washington Bullets, 4–3, in the Eastern Conference Semifinals.[18] They won Game 7, 87–85, on a shot by Snyder with four seconds to go.[18] The Cavaliers moved on to the Eastern Conference Finals for the first time,[18] but were without Chones after he broke his toe before the series opener.[19] As a result, the Cavaliers went on to lose, 4–2, to the Boston Celtics.[20] They made playoff appearances in the following two seasons before a six-year playoff drought.[21][22][23][24][25][26][27][28] The early 1980s were marked by Ted Stepien's ownership. During Stepien's tenure, the Cavaliers made a practice of trading future draft picks for marginal veteran players.[29] His most notable deal sent a 1982 first-round pick to the Los Angeles Lakers in exchange for Don Ford and the 22nd overall pick in 1980.[30] As a result of Stepien's dealings, the NBA introduced the \"Stepien Rule\", which prohibits teams from trading first-round draft picks in successive seasons.[29][31] The Cavaliers went 66–180, dropped to the bottom of the league in attendance and lost $15 million during Stepien's three years as the owner.[29] The Cavs went through six coaches during this span, including four during the 1981–82 season.[29] The team finished 15–67, and between March and November 1982, the team had a 24-game losing streak, which, at the time, was the NBA's longest losing streak.[32][33][34][35][36] George and Gordon Gund purchased the Cavaliers from Stepien in 1983.[31][37] The Cavaliers made the playoffs 10 times between 1985 and 1998.[38] The 1988–89 seasons was the Cavaliers' best season to date, finishing the regular season at 57–25 with a team that included Brad Daugherty, Mark Price, Ron Harper and Larry Nance, and head coach Lenny Wilkens.[38][39] They had their second 57-win season in 1991–92 and reached the Eastern Conference Finals that year.[38][40] However, between 1999 and 2005, the Cavaliers failed to make a playoff appearance.[38] The Cavaliers finished the 2002–03 season 17–65, tied for the worst record in the NBA.[41] The Cavaliers had the No. 1 pick in the 2003 NBA draft, selecting future NBA MVP LeBron James, a native of nearby Akron.[42] On January 3, 2005, the team was sold to businessman Dan Gilbert for $375 million,[43][44][45] and the deal was finalized on March 1, 2005.[46] That year, the team also hired head coach Mike Brown and general manager Danny Ferry.[47] The Cavaliers built a team around James and Žydrūnas Ilgauskas by adding players such as Drew Gooden, Larry Hughes and Anderson Varajao.[48][49] Under this new leadership, the Cavaliers made five straight playoffs from 2006 to 2010, advancing to at least the second round each time.[38] The 2006–07 Cavaliers advanced to the franchise's first NBA Finals, but were swept by the San Antonio Spurs.[50][51] The 2008–09 Cavaliers won a franchise-record 66 games, including a franchise-best 39–2 record at home, but lost the Eastern Conference Finals to the Orlando Magic.[38] Despite the addition of four-time NBA champion Shaquille O'Neal,[52] the 2009–10 Cavaliers were unable to return to the Eastern Conference Finals after losing to the Boston Celtics in the second round.[38] With the Cavaliers out of the playoffs, the focus turned to James' impending free agency.[53] On July 8, 2010, James announced in a nationally televised one-hour special titled The Decision that he would be signing with the Miami Heat.[54] The repercussions of this announcement left many in the city of Cleveland infuriated and feeling betrayed.[55] After a 19–win season in 2010–11, the Cavaliers began a rebuild around Kyrie Irving, whom they selected first overall in the 2011 NBA draft.[38][56] In 2014, James returned to the Cavaliers after four seasons in Miami. While the Heat had a 224–88 record during James' four-year tenure and won NBA titles in 2012 and 2013, the Cavaliers went 97–215 and missed the playoffs each season.[57] The Cavaliers made several moves to build a championship-contending team around James, most notably acquiring power forward Kevin Love from the Minnesota Timberwolves, which created what many fans and media referred to as a \"Big Three\" with James, Love and Irving.[58] The Lebron-led Cavaliers made four consecutive Finals appearances from 2015 to 2018 – all against the Golden State Warriors – winning in 2016.[38][59] The 2016 NBA Championship marked the Cavaliers' first title in franchise history, as they became the first team to come back from a 3–1 deficit to win the Finals.[59] It was also Cleveland's first championship in major professional sports since the 1964 Browns, signaling the end of the so-called Cleveland sports curse.[60] The Cavaliers' roster went through many changes in the 2017–18 season, most notably the trade of Irving to the Boston Celtics in exchange for Isaiah Thomas and other assets.[61][62] Thomas was later traded to the Los Angeles Lakers as part of a trade deadline overhaul that saw the Cavaliers add Jordan Clarkson, Larry Nance Jr. (son of Cavs legend Larry Nance) and others.[63] The following offseason, James declined his player option to rejoin the team, instead signing with the Lakers.[64] In the following two seasons, the team recorded only 19 wins and failed to make the playoffs.[38] In the first three seasons since James left the second time, the Cavaliers won a total of 60 games, missed the playoffs each season and have had four different head coaches: Tyronn Lue, Larry Drew, John Beilein and by this time, J.B. Bickerstaff, who was promoted to head coach for the 2020–21 season after he had been an assistant on Belien's staff the previous season.[38][65][66] In the 2021–22 season, the Cavs finished 44–38 and eighth in the Eastern Conference, and qualified for the NBA play-in tournament, marking the first time the team played in the event. This also marks the team's first postseason basketball since 2017–18 and the first time a non-LeBron-led team qualified for postseason play since 1997–98. The team, however, did not make it out of the play-in tournament, losing the game to the Brooklyn Nets and then to the Atlanta Hawks, ending their season. On March 26, 2023, the Cavaliers clinched a spot in the NBA playoffs, making this the first time since 2018 that the team entered the playoffs, with a 108–91 win over the Houston Rockets. This was also the first time since 1998 that the team entered the playoffs without LeBron James.[67] They wound up losing their first round playoff series to the New York Knicks four games to one.[68] On October 25, 2023, it was announced that defensive end Myles Garrett of the Cleveland Browns had purchased a minority ownership stake in the Cavaliers. Along with his ownership stake, Garrett would serve as an ambassador for the team.[69] The Cavaliers qualified the 2024 NBA Playoffs as the 4th seed in the Eastern Conference, defeating the Orlando Magic 4–3 in the first round, but losing to the Boston Celtics 4–1 in the Conference semifinals.[70] On November 6th, 2024 the Cavaliers beat their all-time franchise \"season start\" win-streak, beating the New Orleans Pelicans 131-122 for a season record of 9-0. [71] After a 128-114 win against the Charlotte Hornets on November 17, 2024, the Cavaliers achieved a 15-0 start, which is tied for the second-best start in franchise history, and the Cavaliers are the fourth team to achieve this milestone, after the 2015-2016 Golden State Warriors team, the 1993-1994 Houston Rockets team, and the 1948-1949 Washington Capitols team. [72][73] The 15-0 start is also the Cavaliers’ longest winning streak in franchise history. [74] On November 19, 2024, the Boston Celtics ended the Cavaliers 15–0 start and 15 game winning streak when they won 120–117, giving the Cavaliers their first loss of the season.

Note: GP = Games played, W = Wins, L = Losses, W–L% = Winning percentage When the Cleveland Cavaliers debuted in the NBA in 1970, the team's original jersey colors were wine and gold. The first jerseys featured the feathered treatment of the letter \"C\" in \"Cavaliers\". In 1974, they changed into the classic block lettering and checkerboard pattern that was synonymous to the \"Miracle of Richfield\" team of 1976. In 1980, the gold shade was changed from yellowish to metallic, and the uniforms removed the checkerboard pattern and placed the stripes above \"Cleveland\" and below the uniform number, the only time the city name was featured in both home and away jerseys. The original logo was that of a swashbuckling cavalier looking right with a sword pointing, surrounded by the team name and a basketball. A modernized swashbuckling cavalier logo was later used by the Cavaliers' NBA Development League affiliate, the Canton Charge. The gold checkerboard uniforms were used as throwbacks in the 2004–05 season to commemorate the 30th anniversary of the \"Miracle of Richfield\" team, while the gold \"feathered C\" uniforms were used again in the 2008–09 season as a buildup to the then-upcoming 40th season of the Cavaliers. The \"Miracle of Richfield\" gold uniforms were used again in the 2015–16 season on special \"Hardwood Classic\" nights to commemorate the Miracle of Richfield team's 40th-anniversary celebration. In the 1983–84 season, the colors were changed to burnt orange, blue and white. The first Cavaliers uniform under the new scheme featured the Cavaliers logo (with a \"V\" in the shape of a hoop and circle above as basketball) in an arched pattern and the player name sewn onto the back shoulder as a patch, with orange being the primary color in both the away and home uniforms. However, in the 1987–88 season, orange was relegated as a secondary color, and blue was used instead as the primary for the away and home uniforms; minor changes in the 1989–90 season include the city name on the blue away uniforms. The drop shadows were also removed. The orange version of the uniform was used again in the 2006–07 and 2016–17 seasons, as part of the respective 20th and 30th anniversaries of the 1986–87 team.[78] The blue versions were worn in the 2009–10 season as part of the franchise's 40th anniversary and as a tribute to the 1988–89 team. Coinciding with the move to Gund Arena in the 1994–95 season, the Cavaliers changed logos and uniforms, adding black in addition to the already existing blue, orange and white colors. The uniforms feature a blue splash in the abdomen area in front. From 1994 to 1997, the word \"CAVS\" on the home uniforms was orange with black lines, while the numbers are in black with white lines; \"CLEVELAND\" on the road uniforms was also orange with black lines, while the numbers are in white with a black line. From 1997 to 1999, the numbers and lettering were slightly tweaked: The word \"CAVS\" and the numbers on the home uniforms were black with orange lines, while the word \"CLEVELAND\" and the numbers on the road uniforms were white with orange lines. In the latter iteration, the blue splash was moved from the right leg to the left leg, surrounding \"CLEVELAND\" on the home uniforms and \"CAVS\" on the road uniforms, with a minor change in striping. In the 1999–2000 season, the Cavaliers opted to go for a cleaner look, eliminating the splash and adding an orange and blue line that runs through the shorts. The home jerseys feature the team nickname and the uniform numbers are in blue with black lines, while the away jerseys featured the city name and the uniform numbers in white with blue lines; these jerseys were used until the 2002–03 season. The logo used in this period was of a basketball on its way down a net, surrounded by a black square and the word \"CAVS\" in blue with black line below. The 1994–1996 black uniforms were revived for the 2019–20 season as part of the Cavaliers' 50th season, as well as the 25th anniversary of the move to Gund Arena (now Rocket Mortgage Fieldhouse).[79] The Cavaliers switched to a modified version of the team's classic wine-and-gold scheme in the 2003–04 season: metallic gold and a crimson shade of wine with navy blue added. The home uniform was white, with the word \"Cavaliers\" in wine lettering with gold trim on the front, the player's name in wine lettering with gold trim on the back, the player's numbers in navy blue, and wine-and-gold trim on the sides. The team's standard road uniform was wine-colored, with the word \"Cleveland\", the player's name and the player's numbers all in white lettering with gold trim, as well as white and gold trim on the sides. The team's alternate jersey was navy blue with the word \"Cleveland\", the player's name and the player's numbers all in white lettering with gold trim, as well as a wine, gold and navy blue checkerboard trim. The checkerboard trim was a tribute to the original Cavaliers uniforms from the 1970s. The logo used was a gold sword piercing through the words \"Cleveland Cavaliers\" in white and navy trim, with a wine basketball surrounding it. The Cavaliers debuted new uniforms before the start of the 2010–11 NBA season to coincide with the team returning to the original shades of wine and gold used from 1970 to 1983.[80] The home uniform is white with a wine-and-gold horizontal stripe trim on the collar, sleeves, waistband and pant legs, the word \"CAVALIERS\" (in block style lettering) in wine on the front of the jersey with wine lettering for the name and number, and white shoes and socks. The road uniform is wine-colored with the same stripe trim, \"Cleveland\" in gold on the front of the jersey, gold lettering on the name and number, and black shoes and socks. An alternate jersey – gold with \"CAVS\" in wine on the front of the jersey, wine lettering on the name and number, white socks and shoes, and the same stripe trim as the other uniforms[81] – was added for the 2012–13 season. All uniforms have the team motto – \"All for one. One for all.\" – stitched on the inside of the collar and the secondary \"Sword C\" logo on the side of the pant legs. The logo used is the same piercing sword logo, updated to the classic wine-and-gold scheme. For the 2014–15 season, a second alternate jersey – and fourth uniform overall – was added, which is navy blue (a callback to the 1987–1994 style) with \"CAVS\" and the player's number in wine with gold trim, the player's name on the back of the jersey in gold and the \"Sword C\" logo on the side of the pant legs.[82] Two alternate jerseys were unveiled prior to the start of the 2015–16 season.[83] The second wine uniform is similar to their regular road jersey, except that it features the arched mid-1980s Cavs logo and white numerals in gold trim. A black sleeved uniform features the wine \"C\" logo in front and was famously worn in the title-clinching Game 7 of the 2016 NBA Finals.[84][85] Their logos for the 2017–18 season newly included the color black to commemorate the victory.[86][87] Beginning in the 2017–18 season, all NBA teams switched to Nike-designed white \"Association\" uniforms and \"Icon\" uniforms in the respective team's primary color. The Cavaliers' Icon uniforms were wine-colored with \"Cleveland\" across the front and the player's name in gold lettering with navy blue numerals both in the front and in the back. The white Association uniforms have \"Cavs\" across the front, with wine color letters and numbers both front and back. All teams have the choice of which uniform to wear for any home game. Also included on the Cavs' jerseys is a small Goodyear \"Wingfoot\" logo, as part of a sponsorship deal with the team.[88][89] Nike also provides a third, alternate uniform called the \"Statement\" uniform. The Cavaliers' Statement uniform is black with dark gray pinstripes, a wine-colored \"C\" trimmed in gold on the front, names in gold letters on the back, wine-colored/gold-trimmed numbers on the front and back, and gold-colored Nike and Goodyear logos on the front. In the same vein as the logo on their 2017–18 jerseys, the black jersey is a nod to the team's former black-sleeved jerseys that they wore when they won Game 7 of the 2016 Finals.[90] For the 2022–23 NBA season, the Cavaliers unveiled an updated logo and color scheme, removing navy blue while reverting to the metallic gold first used from 1980 to 1983, and from 2003 to 2010. The \"C-sword\" alternate logo was retired, and an updated \"V-net\" logo, merging the styles of the 1983–1994 and 1994–2003 logos with the current typeface, was also unveiled.[3][4] With the new logo, the team also introduced three coinciding new uniforms. The white Association uniform features a wine-colored \"V-net\" logo trimmed in gold across the front, wine names and numbers trimmed in gold, and a wine primary \"Cavs C\" logo (outlined in gold) on left leg of the shorts. The wine Icon uniform features \"Cleveland\" in gold lettering on the chest, gold names and numbers, and the \"Cavs C\" logo in wine with a gold outline on the left leg of the shorts. The black Statement uniform – a nod to the black uniforms worn during the team's 2016 NBA championship run – displays a wine \"Cavs C\" logo outlined in gold on the front of the jersey, gold names and numbers, and a gold \"V-net\" logo on the left leg of the shorts.[91][92] From the 2008–09 to the 2011–12 season, the Cavaliers wore special \"mash-up\" uniforms – combining the style from one era with the color scheme of another – on select \"CavFanatic Nights\". Nike also provides a fourth uniform known as the \"City Edition\", which honors the city of Cleveland as well as the state of Ohio: Cleveland Clinic Courts, the team's practice facility and team headquarters, is located in suburban Independence. The 50,000-square-foot (4,600 m2) building opened in 2007 and includes two full-size basketball courts, a weight room, a team room, offices, medical facilities, and kitchen and dining facilities. Naming rights are held by the Cleveland Clinic, which is the team's official healthcare partner. Prior to the opening of Cleveland Clinic Courts, the team used the practice court located on the club level of Rocket Mortgage FieldHouse.[104][105][106] In honor of the Cavs winning the NBA Championship, the city of Independence renamed the section of Brecksville Road leading to the team's practice facility \"Cavaliers Way\" in November 2016.[107] Roster Last transaction: January 12, 2025 The Cavaliers hold the draft rights to the following unsigned draft picks who have been playing outside the NBA. A drafted player – either an international draftee or a college draftee who is not signed by the team that drafted him – is allowed to sign with any non-NBA teams. In this case, the team retains the player's draft rights in the NBA until one year after the player's contract with the non-NBA team ends.[108] This list includes draft rights that were acquired from trades with other teams. The following is a list of past Cavaliers players and other personnel who have been honored as \"Cavs Legends\" – either by retiring their number or having commemorative banners placed in the rafters at Rocket Mortgage FieldHouse.[112][113][114] In 2019, the Cavaliers introduced the Wall of Honor, which honors former players and other personnel, and is located in the newly added North Atrium of the renovated Rocket Mortgage FieldHouse.[118] Note - All personnel who have had their numbers retired or have a similar banner in the rafters are also inducted into the Wall of Honor The following is a list of players and other personnel who have spent at least part of their careers with the Cavaliers that have been inducted into the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame.

When Daugherty serves as game analyst, Carr takes Gibson's place on the pregame/halftime/postgame shows. The Cavaliers have two official mascots: Moondog and Sir C.C. The former was inspired by Cleveland radio DJ Alan Freed, who popularized the phrase \"rock and roll\" and had called himself \"Moondog\". Moondog was an NBA All-Star selection in 2003 and 2004, and he made his first appearance on November 5, 2003. Sir C.C., a swashbuckler character, debuted during a game on November 27, 2010.[124] During the 1990s and early 2000s, the Cavs had a polar bear mascot named Whammer, who was introduced on November 9, 1995. He still makes occasional appearances throughout the season at Cavaliers games.",

TRAILER Locked On Cavs podcast is your daily ticket to stay ahead of the game and the first to know the latest news, analysis, and sports insider info for the Cleveland Cavaliers and the NBA. 04/23/2024 Host 03/09/2023 Cory Darrow As I don’t live in the land anymore, I enjoy tuning into the Pod to get some daily Cavs info. Generally decent discussion, if not somewhat formulaic. Biggest complaint is the constant phrases used by one of the hosts, like “at the end of the day”. Please avoid these sorts of verbal hang-ups, show will come across as more professional that way. Jan 1 Yendoggy So I don’t wanna write a bad review because of the actual content it’s really good, but I’ve literally written into them as someone who doesn’t even really have a particularly sensitive mind for this but the main host has to get a pop filter or something because he is constantly clearing his mouth directly into his microphone, so it is impossible to listen to on EarPods or something because it will just make you insane, even if you’re not sensitive to that thing If you are sensitive to that run away from this because unfortunately it will ruin your day. It’s really as bad as anyone I’ve ever heard and I like the podcast and I’ve written in with the suggestion, but that was months ago and nothing has happened, so I guess he doesn’t think it’s a problem. At times if I have other sounds going, and I don’t use my EarPods, I can listen to it, but it is bad. I mean really bad. He’s constantly pausing to swirl his tongue around his mouth and it is directly into the microphone he does not lean back at all. It seems like he leans in 😆 Please please please a little bit of music underneath your voice would solve it. There’s tons of ways to cover it up. People do it all the time, but they seem to refuse to do it. 11/12/2024 Binglebop22 Hey guys- love the content here. It just sounds like the hosts mic sensitivity is turned up way too high. I want to hear the words without it sounding like he’s chewing gum or eating with his mouth open. So much smacking of the lips , etc,’ makes it harder to listen to. 02/27/2024 True Cavs Fan I know I have been rough on you guys in the past and a little bit in the present but I hope you can at least understand we’re I and a lot of fans of the Cavaliers come from. We are like that dog that has been kicked around all our life and then people look at us crazy when we mess around and bite someone. All I ask is that you treat every episode as if ESPN or FOX sports was listening to your every word. Imagine how much more time energy and effort you would put in compared to what you do now. You didn’t intend this but you are a reflection of me and all other Cleveland Cavaliers fans. And we want you to be the best. So yes I’m harsh at times because I at least want great production and information and it is clear to me that you guys have stepped your game.

                "title": "Alabama Crimson Tide men's basketball - Wikipedia",
                "content": "The Alabama Crimson Tide men's basketball team represents the University of Alabama in NCAA Division I men's basketball. The program plays in the Southeastern Conference (SEC). Among SEC teams it trails only long-time basketball powerhouse Kentucky in SEC tournament titles, is third behind Kentucky and Tennessee in SEC regular season conference titles, and is fourth behind Kentucky, Texas, and Arkansas in total wins. Alabama was retroactively recognized as the pre-NCAA tournament national champion for the 1929–30 season by the Premo-Porretta Power Poll.[3] The team has appeared in the NCAA tournament 24 times, most recently in 2024, and has made ten Sweet Sixteens, two Elite Eights, and one Final Four in the tournament. Alabama's current head coach is Nate Oats. The men's basketball program has spent most of its history in the shadow of Alabama's football team, but has risen in stature over the past several decades. The program was notable as a regular conference basketball contender in the 1980s and early 1990s under the direction of coach Wimp Sanderson and in the 1970s under coach C. M. Newton. Under former coach Mark Gottfried, the team achieved a No. 1 national ranking briefly in 2003. In the 2003–04 season, the team defeated #1-seeded Stanford in the NCAA tournament, and reached the Elite Eight round for the first time where they lost to the eventual national champion, Connecticut. Under Nate Oats, the team earned SEC titles in 2021 and 2023. In the latter year, the Crimson Tide achieved their best-ever season in program history to that point, earning the No. 1 overall seed in the NCAA tournament. They fell to the eventual runner-up, San Diego State, in the Sweet Sixteen. In the 2024 NCAA tournament, they defeated #1-seeded North Carolina in the Sweet Sixteen, and defeated #6-seeded Clemson in the Elite Eight to advance to their first Final Four appearance in the school's history where they lost to the eventual national champion, UConn. Former coaches with at least five years with the Crimson Tide include the following: Hank Crisp (1923–1942, 1945–1946), Hayden Riley (1960–1968), C. M. Newton (1968–1980), Wimp Sanderson (1980–1992) – Alabama's winningest coach (.692), David Hobbs (1992–1998), Mark Gottfried (1998–2009), and Anthony Grant (2009–2015).[4][5] Other coaches include John Dee, D.V. Graves, Floyd Burdette, and Charles A. Bernier.[5] In 1968, legendary Alabama football coach Paul \"Bear\" Bryant, who was also Alabama's athletic director, called Kentucky men's basketball coach Adolph Rupp looking for someone to turn around Alabama's basketball program. Rupp recommended C. M. Newton, a former backup player at Kentucky who had been at Transylvania University for 12 years.[6] In 12 seasons at Alabama, Newton led the Tide to a record of 211–123. The Crimson Tide won three straight SEC titles under Newton (1974, 1975, and 1976), the only program besides Kentucky to accomplish this feat.[6] Newton also guided Alabama to four NIT and two NCAA Men's Division I Championship tournament berths, prompting the school to name a recruiting suite in his honor in 2006.[7] Just as he did at Transylvania, Newton recruited Alabama's first black player, Wendell Hudson, in 1969, integrating his second team in as many coaching stops.[8] Newton resigned as head coach after the 1980–81 season to become assistant commissioner of the SEC. He was succeeded by his top assistant, Wimp Sanderson. He had been at Alabama since 1960 as a graduate assistant to Newton's predecessor, Hayden Riley; he was named a full-fledged assistant in 1961. In 12 years as head coach his teams averaged 21.8 wins a year, with a 267–119 record, and they won 4 SEC tournaments. They played in one NIT and eight NCAA tournaments making the \"Sweet 16\" five times. Sanderson is the only coach in Alabama history to win 200 or more games in his first 10 years. He was the SEC Coach of the Year in 1987, 1989 and 1990, and was the National Coach of the Year in 1987.[9] Sanderson was best known for wearing garish plaid sports jackets on the sidelines. At one point, Coleman Coliseum was known as the \"Plaid Palace\", and the mid-court logo was painted in a crimson-and-white plaid pattern. Hobbs was hired at Alabama as an assistant coach for Wimp Sanderson in 1985 and spent seven years as an assistant in Tuscaloosa helping the Crimson Tide win one SEC Championship and four SEC Tournament crowns while the Tide made four appearances in the NCAA tournament's Sweet 16. As an assistant, he had the opportunity to coach such All-SEC performers as Robert Horry, James \"Hollywood\" Robinson and Latrell Sprewell. When Sanderson left Alabama following the 1992 season, Hobbs was named head coach. In his first season, the Tide finished 16–13 and advanced to the NIT. In 1994 and 1995, Alabama recorded 20-win seasons and advanced to the NCAA tournament behind the play of future NBA All-Star Antonio McDyess. In 1996, Hobbs led UA to a 19–13 mark and a berth in the NIT Final Four. He resigned his post following the 1998 season after compiling a 110–76 (.594) career record and producing nine All-SEC players. Mark Gottfried served as the Crimson Tide's head coach from the 1998–99 season until midway through the 2008–09 season.[4] Gottfried played 3 seasons of basketball at Alabama under Wimp Sanderson, and the Crimson Tide advanced to the Sweet Sixteen in each of those seasons. He was hired by Alabama in March 1998 after coaching at Murray State for three seasons. The Crimson Tide achieved the highest pinnacle ever for the school in both the NCAA Championship tournament and the Associated Press Poll reaching the Elite Eight in the tournament in 2004 and reaching the No. 1 spot in the nation in the AP poll in 2002, both under Mark Gottfried's command. Gottfried led the Tide to its only SEC Championship under his watch during the 2001–02 season, although the team never won a conference tournament championship during his tenure. For his efforts in 2002, Gottfried was named SEC Coach of the Year by both the Associated Press and his fellow Southeastern Conference coaches. Perhaps his biggest accomplishment as coach at Alabama was leading the Crimson Tide to five consecutive NCAA tournaments from 2002 to 2006, another first for the school that occurred under his watch. Gottfried resigned on January 26, 2009, with 11 regular season games still remaining on the team's schedule. Then Athletic Director Mal Moore named long-time Alabama assistant and former player, Philip Pearson as interim head coach for the remainder of the 2008–09 season. On March 27, 2009 Anthony Grant agreed in principle to become the 20th Crimson Tide head men's basketball coach.[11] Grant came to Alabama after serving as the head coach at VCU from 2006 to 2009. After a mediocre first season, Grant led the veteran 2010–11 team to a SEC West title and a 2nd-place finish in the 2011 NIT. The 2011–12 team endured the suspensions of several star players to finish with a 21–12 record and a berth in the 2012 NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament, where they lost in the round of 64 to Creighton. This was the Crimson Tide's first trip to the NCAA tournament since 2006. In March 2015, Grant was fired by Alabama after six seasons. Assistant coach John Brannen served as interim head coach for the 2015 NIT tournament.[12] On April 5, 2015, Avery Johnson agreed to become Alabama's next head coach.[13] The former NBA coach said he was attracted to the position because he perceived it as \"a big challenge\" in that Alabama is not a \"perennial favorite\" and has never won a championship before.[14] Johnson's 2017–18 team finished with a 20–16 (8–10) record and was invited to the NCAA tournament. The next season, the Tide finished 18–16 (8–10) and Johnson was let go at the end of the campaign.[15] On March 27, 2019, Nate Oats was named Alabama's next head coach.[16] Oats was previously the coach for the Buffalo Bulls, and had led them to three NCAA tournament appearances in the past four years. After a 16–15 record in his first season in 2019–20, Oats' second season brought Alabama the first SEC regular-season title since 2002 and the first SEC tournament title since 1991. The Tide were a No. 2 seed in the 2021 tournament, where they fell to UCLA in overtime in the Sweet Sixteen. Then in 2023, Oats coached Alabama to their second SEC regular season and tournament championship in three years. Alabama returned as the No. 1 overall seed in the 2023 NCAA tournament where they advanced to the Sweet Sixteen for the second time under Oats tenure before falling to San Diego State who advanced to the National Championship game. In 2024, Alabama once again made the NCAA tournament and advanced to their second Elite Eight in program history after defeating North Carolina in the Sweet Sixteen. Bama beat Clemson in the West Region finals to advance to the Final Four for the first time in program history. Oats also holds the best record against AP top 10 teams in Alabama history.[citation needed] Roster The Crimson Tide basketball team practices and plays in Coleman Coliseum, a multi-purpose arena on the UA campus in Tuscaloosa. The arena was built for $4.2 million and opened in 1968 as a replacement for the aging Foster Auditorium. In 2005, the building underwent a renovation in which more seats were added. The arena officially seats 15,314 people. Coleman Coliseum was named for Jefferson Jackson Coleman, a prominent alumnus and longtime supporter of the University of Alabama. Until his death in 1995, he was the only person that had attended every Alabama football bowl game, starting with the Rose Bowl Game on January 1, 1926. Prior to 1990, the building was known as Memorial Coliseum. \"Mark's Madness\" was a student organization named after former Crimson Tide coach Mark Gottfried, which is also a play on the nickname for the NCAA basketball tournament, \"March Madness\".[17] It was created by a group of Alabama students in January 2000 in an attempt to create a more exciting atmosphere in Coleman Coliseum.[18] During the Gottfried era, the Crimson Tide was an impressive 137-27 (.835) in Coleman Coliseum.[17] Mark's Madness was the largest student organization on campus during its time.[17] The end of Mark Gottfried's tenure in early 2009 also meant the end of the Mark's Madness name. After Coach Anthony Grant was hired, a group of senior students approached the UA Marketing Department in the summer 2009 about resurrecting the student section organization. During the first exhibition game of the 2009 season, it was announced that the new name of the student organization for supporting Alabama basketball would be \"Crimson Chaos\". As Crimson Chaos entered its second year, it officially registered as a University of Alabama student group and adopted a new format. In addition to supporting men's basketball, Crimson Chaos expanded to support all University of Alabama sports, becoming the official student group of athletics at the university.[19] The group also tried new things to make the atmosphere in Coleman Coliseum as intimidating as it was in previous years, including adding the \"Roll Tide Roller Coaster\".[20] The newly energized environment Crimson Chaos created in Coleman Coliseum helped the Tide complete an undefeated season at home (for the 2010–11 season) with a 19–0 record, including wins over then #12 Kentucky, Georgia, Mississippi State. The group's popularity garnered even more attention and praise thanks to the late superfan Luke “Fluff” Ratliff. He became the Crimson Chaos president and wore a plaid jacket to almost every game. He was loved by many for his light hearted humor and happy-go-lucky attitude. He inspired many people to follow and share in his passion for the tide hoops program and also other athletic teams around campus. He sparked the basketball program under Coach Nate Oats and continues to be an inspiration to so many. There is a plaque engraved to honor Fluff in the dedicated chair for all Crimson Chaos Presidents who come after him.[21][citation needed] Alabama has appeared in the NCAA tournament 24 times. It has reached the Sweet Sixteen ten times,[a][23] the Elite Eight twice, and the Final Four once. Alabama has an overall NCAA tournament record of 29–25.[24][25] Alabama has appeared in 16 National Invitation Tournaments, reaching the championship game on two occasions. Alabama has an overall NIT record of 24–19. Alabama has seen its stars go on to win nine NBA Championships and earn six All-Star selections, six All-Defensive Team honors, three All-Rookie honors and more than $390 million in the NBA. Former Alabama players have gone on to suit up in nearly 10,000 NBA games and have scored more than 90,000 cumulative points.

                "title": "Takeaways from special counsel Jack Smith’s report on January 6 and Trump’s efforts to overturn the 2020 election | CNN Politics",
                "content": "Follow: The evidence was there to convict Donald Trump. That’s the simple and powerful conclusion from former special counsel Jack Smith in his final report on Trump’s effort to overturn the 2020 presidential election culminating in the January 6, 2021, attack on the US Capitol. Smith’s 137-page report, released overnight less than one week before Trump is sworn in for a second term as president, is a full-throated justification of his investigation and defense against his myriad critics. And while he faced substantial political and legal headwinds — especially from the Supreme Court — Smith said his ultimate defeat was at the ballot box when Trump was reelected. With Trump about to be shielded from prosecution as the sitting president, per Justice Department policy, Smith wrote, it was all over. A second volume, summing up the other half of Smith’s work, on what’s been assessed to be a strong but now-closed case against Trump over the retention of classified records after his presidency and obstruction of justice, is still not public. As with all of the legal battles Trump won over the past couple of years, it’s part of the ultimate “what if?” question of the 2024 election. Here’s what to know from Smith’s report: This is the second time a special counsel investigating Trump has pointed to the fact that Justice Department policy means the former and future president won’t face a jury. “The Department’s view that the Constitution prohibits the continued indictment and prosecution of a President is categorical and does not tum on the gravity of the crimes charged, the strength of the Government’s proof, or the merits of the prosecution, which the Office stands fully behind,” Smith wrote. Related article The lost year: How Merrick Garland’s Justice Department ran out of time prosecuting Trump for January 6 “Indeed, but for Mr. Trump’s election and imminent return to the Presidency, the Office assessed that the admissible evidence was sufficient to obtain and sustain a conviction at trial.” Attorney General Merrick Garland has faced criticism from the left for not appointing a special counsel to investigate Trump until November 2022 — and Smith didn’t begin his work until early the next year. And it wasn’t an open-and-shut legal case. However, the special counsel indicated the 2024 election meant he was out of time and options. Smith, however, didn’t guarantee a conviction — he just said there’s enough evidence. “It’s the same conclusion any prosecutor must reach before bringing any indictment, that there’s enough there so a jury will convict,” said CNN senior legal analyst Elie Honig. “He’s not making some boastful prediction about what a hypothetical jury would’ve done.” Trump, who from January 6, 2021, has insisted he did nothing wrong and now plans to pardon many of those arrested, charged and convicted of rioting at the Capitol that day, has repeatedly said he was exonerated since the charges were dropped. Trump’s lawyers even included his “fully exonerated” line in a letter to the attorney general, trying to block the release of the report. But Smith said that’s absolutely not the case. “Mr. Trump’s letter claims that dismissal of his criminal cases signifies Mr. Trump’s ‘complete exoneration,’” Smith wrote. “That is false.” Trump and the public have seen this language before. Former special counsel Robert Muller, in his report on alleged collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia in the 2016 election, said there was more than enough evidence to charge Trump with obstruction of justice but didn’t. “While this report does not conclude that the president committed a crime, it also does not exonerate him,” Mueller wrote in 2019, during Trump’s first term. “If we had confidence after a thorough investigation of the facts that the president clearly did not commit obstruction of justice, we would so state,” Mueller stated. And while Trump pleaded not guilty to the federal charges and consistently called the investigation a “witch hunt,” his lawyers didn’t have any pushback to the facts of Smith’s report, the special counsel said. A letter from Trump’s attorneys to Garland, Smith wrote, “fails to identify any specific factual objections to the draft” report they reviewed ahead of its public release. While Smith claims he could have obtained a conviction, he acknowledges the obvious: The Supreme Court was a deciding factor. “Because of the unprecedented facts and the variety of legal issues that would be litigated in this case, the Office was aware that the case would involve litigation risks, as would any case of this scope and complexity,” Smith wrote. “However, after an exhaustive and detailed review of the law, the Office concluded that the charges were well supported and would survive any legal challenges absent a change in the law as it existed at the time of indictment,” he added. Related article Special counsel report condemns Trump’s ‘criminal efforts to retain power’ in 2020 But the law changed. Slowly. And in Trump’s favor. Smith had attempted to speed things up, asking the Supreme Court in December 2023 to jump in and consider the presidential immunity question. The court, however, wasn’t in a hurry. It declined the request, waited for an appeals court ruling (which Trump lost) and didn’t hear oral arguments in the case until April. When the court’s conservative majority said in July that presidents enjoyed wide immunity for their official actions in the White House, it wasn’t until August that the special counsel was able to try again with a superseding indictment that limited the evidence Smith could use. Unsaid by Smith: Three of the justices in the 6-3 majority were appointed by Trump during the same term for which he now enjoyed immunity. Trump was also able to leverage the immunity ruling to delay being sentenced before the presidential election after being convicted in New York on fraud charges relating to hush money payments to adult-film star Stormy Daniels. Smith said his office would not have charged Trump if he was merely exercising his free speech rights by engaging in “exaggeration or rough-and-tumble politics.” Trump and the unindicted co-conspirators in the case “went well beyond speaking their minds or contesting the election results though our legal system,” Smith said, regarding the efforts to overturn Joe Biden’s election win. Over the course of more than 20 pages, Smith laid out why he believed the unprecedented prosecution was justified and that there was no alternative, citing the need of “protecting the integrity of the United States’ electoral process” and the “federal interest defending from future harm the United States exceptional tradition of peaceful transitions of presidential power.” Impeachment — even if Trump had been convicted by the Senate — is a political process, not a legal one, Smith wrote. Trump was impeached for his role in inciting the riot on January 6, 2021, but was acquitted by the Senate. “Thus, even if Mr. Trump had been convicted by the Senate, political accountability, in the form of impeachment, would not have been an adequate alternative for criminal accountability, especially considering the scope of Mr. Trump’s offenses and the substantial federal interests they targeted,” the report stated. The special counsel noted that more than 1,500 people have been charged for their actions at the US Capitol on January 6, so Trump shouldn’t have gotten off the hook: “Mr. Trump’s relative culpability weighed heavily in favor of charging him, as the individual most responsible for what occurred at the Capitol on January 6.” Nevertheless, there are others who also will avoid federal charges thanks to Trump’s win: the unindicted co-conspirators. At least one subject of the investigation, who was not named, may have committed unrelated crimes, and that person was referred to a US attorney’s office, according to the report. Smith’s report has an entire section contemplating how the Justice Department should approach investigations in election years, something that’s been a constant source of controversy, especially over the past decade. He stated that given the timing of the investigation and Trump’s concurrent reelection bid, the former president’s “actions would be criticized by one constituency or another, regardless of which path the investigations took.” Related article READ: Jack Smith’s report on efforts to overturn the 2020 election The special counsel said he leaned on DOJ policy and his own experience in the department’s Criminal Division’s Public Integrity Section and moved “swiftly.” DOJ policy is to not bring charges in the months before an election, he wrote, but it does not apply to cases already in court, as his were. “Whether it is during an election year or any other time, the duty of prosecutors after indictment is to litigate their cases fully and zealously,” the report states. Smith is essentially giving future prosecutors a roadmap. There has never been as fulsome of an articulation of this, especially in writing, so what Smith and his team wrote here will probably become relatively important in future elections. Smith had choice words for Trump’s attorneys, saying they peddled a “variety of false, misleading, or otherwise unfounded claims” to attack the integrity of his indictments and investigation. This searing rebuke is all the more notable, considering that one of the people Smith criticized was Trump attorney Todd Blanche, the president-elect’s pick to serve as deputy attorney general. It’s not out of the question that Blanche, in that role, could help supervise special counsel investigations in the future. Smith’s condemnations came in a January 7 letter to Garland and made public in the report. Smith sent the letter last week in response to a vitriolic letter from Trump’s team arguing the report should never be released because he is an “out-of-control private citizen unconstitutionally posing as a prosecutor.” It’s all the more jarring to see Smith condemn the incoming president’s lawyers on the same day that a separate special counsel condemned the outgoing president, too. Special counsel David Weiss, who investigated and successfully prosecuted Hunter Biden, said in his own final report on Monday that President Joe Biden made “false” and “wrong” accusations about the probe to justify pardoning his son. (Biden had said the investigation was unfair and tainted by politics.) But here’s the reality: For the first time since 2016, there are no active special counsels at the Justice Department.

                "content": "Carrie Johnson Special counsel Jack Smith said he would have won a criminal conviction of President-elect Donald Trump if not for his election to a second term. MARY LOUISE KELLY, HOST: Early this morning, special counsel Jack Smith closed the book on his election interference charges against Donald Trump. Smith says that criminal case would have produced a conviction against Trump but for Trump's return to the White House this year. Smith also defended his work against accusations that he acted with politics in mind. He said he and his team followed one North Star - the facts, wherever they led. NPR justice correspondent Carrie Johnson has been poring over the 174 pages of the report. Hi, Carrie.CARRIE JOHNSON, BYLINE: Hey, Mary Louise.KELLY: That's an awfully confident assessment, that he says this would have produced a conviction against Trump. What was the evidence that gave him so much confidence that he could get a conviction on four felony counts?JOHNSON: Jack Smith outlined a pervasive pattern of deceit about the 2020 election. He talked about doing interviews with aides and Trump family members that suggest Donald Trump said one thing in public about election fraud and another in private. And Smith mentioned a November 2020 comment Trump allegedly made after watching Joe Biden on TV, basically saying, can you believe I lost to this guy?Smith also said it was foreseeable that violence would happen at the Capitol on January 6, 2021, and that Trump took advantage of it. He refused to call off the mob for hours and actually said, so what, when Trump learned Mike Pence was in danger there. And the prosecutors say they would have convicted if a trial was allowed to happen. But ultimately, that won't happen because of a long-standing Justice Department policy that sitting presidents cannot be charged or tried for crimes.KELLY: And the backdrop is that Jack Smith has resigned. He's dropped his cases. So the basic question - but why does this report matter at this point?JOHNSON: This was really a chance for prosecutors to explain what they did and why. In large part, they're writing for history at a time when Donald Trump and many Republican lawmakers have been calling the rioters hostages and patriots. Smith also got a chance to respond to criticism about possible delay in the Justice Department case. He said some of that is because Trump fought so hard over executive privilege, which took months and months, and that the Supreme Court took a long time to both accept this case over whether Trump had immunity and then to decide it. And the prosecutors also said they had a harder job than the House January 6 Committee did because they had a higher bar to meet.Finally, we learned from this report that prosecutors considered charging Trump with insurrection, which could have disqualified him from running for office, but hardly anyone has been charged with that crime for decades. And they also considered charging him with incitement for comments that he made at the rally before the mob descended on the Capitol, but that's a really high legal bar, and they didn't meet it.KELLY: Well, I will note Trump fought until the last hour. He was fighting still last night to block the report's release. Now that it is out, we can read it. Is this the end of all of the trials that President-elect Trump was facing?JOHNSON: The criminal trials, I think, largely, yes, but the former president and President-elect still faces civil claims from some of the 140 law enforcement officers who were brutalized at the Capitol with things like flagpoles and bear spray. And prosecutions may actually continue at the state level for some of Trump's alleged coconspirators.KELLY: Oh, stay with them for a second, the alleged coconspirators. These are people like Rudy Giuliani, John Eastman. You were talking about state charges. What about federal cases against them?JOHNSON: Neither of those attorneys has been charged with a federal crime. Jack Smith says his team had made some preliminary decisions about charging other people and whether to try them alongside Donald Trump or separately. That work's over now, though, and it's hard to imagine the Trump Justice Department would take up any of those cases. In fact, it's far more likely Trump will pardon many of those at the Capitol as soon as next week when he's inaugurated.KELLY: And Carrie, last thing. Jack Smith had two cases against Trump. The other one was the classified documents case at Mar-a-Lago. What happens to that case now?JOHNSON: You know, the Justice Department is trying to keep alive the case against Trump's codefendants there. Those are longtime Mar-a-Lago aides Walt Nauta and Carlos De Oliveira. It's still an open question whether we're going to see Volume 2 of Jack Smith's report, and that focuses on the highly classified materials the FBI found in Trump's home and in ballrooms and bathrooms in Florida. Florida Judge Aileen Cannon, who was appointed to the bench by Donald Trump, has called for a hearing on releasing that part of the Smith report in Florida this Friday.KELLY: This Friday.

And Smith mentioned a November 2020 comment Trump allegedly made after watching Joe Biden on TV, basically saying, can you believe I lost to this guy?Smith also said it was foreseeable that violence would happen at the Capitol on January 6, 2021, and that Trump took advantage of it. He refused to call off the mob for hours and actually said, so what, when Trump learned Mike Pence was in danger there. And the prosecutors say they would have convicted if a trial was allowed to happen. But ultimately, that won't happen because of a long-standing Justice Department policy that sitting presidents cannot be charged or tried for crimes.KELLY: And the backdrop is that Jack Smith has resigned. He's dropped his cases. So the basic question - but why does this report matter at this point?JOHNSON: This was really a chance for prosecutors to explain what they did and why. In large part, they're writing for history at a time when Donald Trump and many Republican lawmakers have been calling the rioters hostages and patriots. Smith also got a chance to respond to criticism about possible delay in the Justice Department case. He said some of that is because Trump fought so hard over executive privilege, which took months and months, and that the Supreme Court took a long time to both accept this case over whether Trump had immunity and then to decide it. And the prosecutors also said they had a harder job than the House January 6 Committee did because they had a higher bar to meet.Finally, we learned from this report that prosecutors considered charging Trump with insurrection, which could have disqualified him from running for office, but hardly anyone has been charged with that crime for decades. And they also considered charging him with incitement for comments that he made at the rally before the mob descended on the Capitol, but that's a really high legal bar, and they didn't meet it.KELLY: Well, I will note Trump fought until the last hour. He was fighting still last night to block the report's release. Now that it is out, we can read it. Is this the end of all of the trials that President-elect Trump was facing?JOHNSON: The criminal trials, I think, largely, yes, but the former president and President-elect still faces civil claims from some of the 140 law enforcement officers who were brutalized at the Capitol with things like flagpoles and bear spray. And prosecutions may actually continue at the state level for some of Trump's alleged coconspirators.KELLY: Oh, stay with them for a second, the alleged coconspirators. These are people like Rudy Giuliani, John Eastman. You were talking about state charges. What about federal cases against them?JOHNSON: Neither of those attorneys has been charged with a federal crime. Jack Smith says his team had made some preliminary decisions about charging other people and whether to try them alongside Donald Trump or separately. That work's over now, though, and it's hard to imagine the Trump Justice Department would take up any of those cases. In fact, it's far more likely Trump will pardon many of those at the Capitol as soon as next week when he's inaugurated.KELLY: And Carrie, last thing. Jack Smith had two cases against Trump. The other one was the classified documents case at Mar-a-Lago. What happens to that case now?JOHNSON: You know, the Justice Department is trying to keep alive the case against Trump's codefendants there. Those are longtime Mar-a-Lago aides Walt Nauta and Carlos De Oliveira. It's still an open question whether we're going to see Volume 2 of Jack Smith's report, and that focuses on the highly classified materials the FBI found in Trump's home and in ballrooms and bathrooms in Florida. Florida Judge Aileen Cannon, who was appointed to the bench by Donald Trump, has called for a hearing on releasing that part of the Smith report in Florida this Friday.KELLY: This Friday.

Those are longtime Mar-a-Lago aides Walt Nauta and Carlos De Oliveira. It's still an open question whether we're going to see Volume 2 of Jack Smith's report, and that focuses on the highly classified materials the FBI found in Trump's home and in ballrooms and bathrooms in Florida. Florida Judge Aileen Cannon, who was appointed to the bench by Donald Trump, has called for a hearing on releasing that part of the Smith report in Florida this Friday.KELLY: This Friday.

The authoritative record of NPR’s programming is the audio record. Smith also said it was foreseeable that violence would happen at the Capitol on January 6, 2021, and that Trump took advantage of it. He refused to call off the mob for hours and actually said, so what, when Trump learned Mike Pence was in danger there. And the prosecutors say they would have convicted if a trial was allowed to happen. But ultimately, that won't happen because of a long-standing Justice Department policy that sitting presidents cannot be charged or tried for crimes.KELLY: And the backdrop is that Jack Smith has resigned. He's dropped his cases. So the basic question - but why does this report matter at this point?JOHNSON: This was really a chance for prosecutors to explain what they did and why. In large part, they're writing for history at a time when Donald Trump and many Republican lawmakers have been calling the rioters hostages and patriots. Smith also got a chance to respond to criticism about possible delay in the Justice Department case. He said some of that is because Trump fought so hard over executive privilege, which took months and months, and that the Supreme Court took a long time to both accept this case over whether Trump had immunity and then to decide it. And the prosecutors also said they had a harder job than the House January 6 Committee did because they had a higher bar to meet.Finally, we learned from this report that prosecutors considered charging Trump with insurrection, which could have disqualified him from running for office, but hardly anyone has been charged with that crime for decades. And they also considered charging him with incitement for comments that he made at the rally before the mob descended on the Capitol, but that's a really high legal bar, and they didn't meet it.KELLY: Well, I will note Trump fought until the last hour. He was fighting still last night to block the report's release. Now that it is out, we can read it. Is this the end of all of the trials that President-elect Trump was facing?JOHNSON: The criminal trials, I think, largely, yes, but the former president and President-elect still faces civil claims from some of the 140 law enforcement officers who were brutalized at the Capitol with things like flagpoles and bear spray. And prosecutions may actually continue at the state level for some of Trump's alleged coconspirators.KELLY: Oh, stay with them for a second, the alleged coconspirators. These are people like Rudy Giuliani, John Eastman. You were talking about state charges. What about federal cases against them?JOHNSON: Neither of those attorneys has been charged with a federal crime. Jack Smith says his team had made some preliminary decisions about charging other people and whether to try them alongside Donald Trump or separately. That work's over now, though, and it's hard to imagine the Trump Justice Department would take up any of those cases. In fact, it's far more likely Trump will pardon many of those at the Capitol as soon as next week when he's inaugurated.KELLY: And Carrie, last thing. Jack Smith had two cases against Trump. The other one was the classified documents case at Mar-a-Lago.

                "title": "Nuggets' Jamal Murray scores 45, continues to round back into form in blowout win over Mavericks - CBSSports.com",
                "content": "If not listed, please contact your TV provider. They'd never admit it publicly, but the Denver Nuggets had to be pretty nervous about the way Jamal Murray kicked off his 2024-25 season. They were willing to brush off a disappointing 2024 postseason and a disastrous Olympic run with Canada over the summer when they gave him a new, max contract extension, but his performance early on was hardly commensurate with his new compensation. Murray averaged just under 18 points per game on 42% shooting in his first 17 games this season. Fine numbers for most players but not acceptable for someone making what Murray is making. On the heels of a second-round postseason exit, Denver lost starting shooting guard Kentavious Caldwell-Pope in the offseason. They lost Bruce Brown and Jeff Green a year prior after winning the NBA title. If they were going to overcome those absences, they needed their best players to give them more, not less. But the recurring effects of injuries that began last season took a toll. Murray struggled and so did the team. But over the past month or so, Murray has slowly rounded back into form. In his last 15 outings, Murray is back above 20 points per game. Denver is 10-5 in those games. Murray is getting to the rim more frequently, and he's shooting a better percentage once he gets there. Most importantly, though, the 3s are starting to fall again. He's making 42% of them in that stretch, and on Tuesday against the Dallas Mavericks, Murray made just about everything -- particularly in the first half. The tally through 24 minutes: 32 points on 12 of 15 shooting and 4 of 6 on 3s. Murray's season-high for an entire game entering Tuesday was 34 points. The 32 he scored in the first half against Dallas was good enough for second place on its own. And by the time the final buzzer sounded on Denver's 118-99 victory, Murray had tallied 45 points on 18 of 26 shooting. It was his best individual scoring effort since he tied his career-high of 50 on Feb. 19, 2021. Jamal Murray in the 1st half:32 points12/15 shooting4 threes pic.twitter.com/UHxmIae66y Yes, the Mavericks were without key rim protector Dereck Lively for most of the half on Tuesday, but Murray's shots came from everywhere. He made two shots in the restricted area, four in the rest of the paint, four from mid-range and four from behind the arc. This is the sort of varied scoring game that has made Murray so dangerous in the past. His two-man game with Nikola Jokic has been so dominant in part because of its unpredictability. Both of them can score and set each other up from anywhere on the court, but a hobbled Murray couldn't quite do his part. But now he's slowly starting to round into form, and that has significant implications for the Nuggets and the rest of the league. Even if 20 points or so per game doesn't sound especially impressive, remember that Murray has never topped 21.2 per game in a full season. He has never posted gaudy regular-season numbers. What matters here is his health. That he's starting to play in line with his typical regular-season level suggests he'll be ready to scale up in the playoffs as he almost always has. Before last season, Murray averaged 25 points per game in the playoffs. That is the version of Murray that won Denver a championship, and that is the one the Nuggets are hoping will be able to peak when the weather gets warm. This improvement is the first real sign that the Nuggets have had all season that he's coming. And if he does? That changes Denver's entire trade deadline calculus. The Nuggets have been linked to star guards like Zach LaVine in part because Murray's struggles hinted at a need for more shot creation. They certainly still need help for their bench, but their primary lineups featuring both Murray and Jokic have thrived offensively in this stretch. Denver has very little to trade with and is already pressed up against the second apron. If the Nuggets can avoid a major reshaping of the roster, they'd likely prefer to. This version of Murray makes that option a bit more palatable. If he keeps this up, a Nuggets team that looked to be in significant decline might be able to play its way back into the Western Conference title race after all. © 2004-2024 CBS Interactive.

Will they make it four, or will the Mavericks step up and spoil it? We'll know soon. Denver Nuggets @ Dallas Mavericks Current Records: Denver 23-15, Dallas 22-17 Mavericks fans going to Tuesday's game might be disappointed given the experts' predictions. They will look to defend their home court on Tuesday against the Denver Nuggets at 9:30 p.m. ET at American Airlines Center. The Mavericks are headed into this one after the oddsmakers set last week's over/under low at 232, but even that wound up being too high. They fell 112-101 to the Nuggets on Sunday. Dallas was up 86-67 in the third but couldn't hold on to the lead. Multiple players turned in solid performances to lead the Nuggets to victory, but perhaps none more so than Nikola Jokic, who almost dropped a triple-double on 19 points, 18 rebounds, and nine assists. The Nuggets smashed the offensive glass and finished the game with 15 offensive rebounds. They easily outclassed their opponents in that department as the Mavericks only pulled down eight. Dallas has traveled a rocky road recently having lost six of their last eight matches, which put a noticeable dent in their 22-17 record this season. As for Denver, the victory was the third in a row for them, bringing their record for this year to 23-15. Denver is a 4.5-point favorite against Dallas, according to the latest NBA odds. The oddsmakers had a good feel for the line for this one, as the game opened with the Nuggets as a 5.5-point favorite. The over/under is 232.5 points.

        "Tim Tebow": [
            {
                "title": "Tim Tebow - Wikipedia",
                "content": "Timothy Richard Tebow (/ˈtiːboʊ/; born August 14, 1987) is an American former professional football quarterback who played in the National Football League (NFL) for three seasons, primarily with the Denver Broncos. Tebow played college football for the Florida Gators, where he became the first underclassman to win the Heisman Trophy and helped lead the team to two BCS National Championship titles in 2006 and 2008.[3] At the conclusion of his collegiate career, he held the Southeastern Conference's records for career passing efficiency and rushing touchdowns.[4] He was selected by the Broncos in the first round of the 2010 NFL draft. Tebow became the Broncos' starter during the 2011 season and revitalized a struggling team, bringing them to the franchise's first division title and playoff victory since 2005.[5] His frequent comeback victories and outspoken Christian faith made him a cultural phenomenon, with his habit of dropping to one knee in prayer on the field becoming known as \"Tebowing\". Due to questions over Tebow's potential as an NFL quarterback, he was traded after the season to the New York Jets, where he spent one year as a backup.[6] After failing to make the regular season roster of the New England Patriots and Philadelphia Eagles, Tebow pursued a minor league baseball career with the New York Mets organization from 2016 to 2021.[7] The same year he retired from baseball, he returned to the NFL as a tight end for the Jacksonville Jaguars, but was released after one preseason game. Since 2017, he has been a regular contributor and co-host for college football programming on SEC Network and ESPN. Tebow was inducted in the College Football Hall of Fame in 2023. Tebow was born in the Philippines to American parents. In the late 1960s, Tebow's parents – Pamela Elaine (née Pemberton) and Robert Ramsey Tebow II – met while attending the University of Florida.[8][9] During that time, his mother was a freshman and his father was a sophomore. The couple married on June 12, 1971, before Pamela's graduation from the university.[10] In 1985, the family moved to the Philippines where they served as Baptist missionaries and built a ministry.[10] During the Tebows' stay, Pamela contracted amoebic dysentery and fell into a coma. While recovering, she discovered that she was pregnant. The medications used to treat Pamela caused a severe placental abruption.[10] Doctors expected a stillbirth and recommended an abortion, which was illegal in the Philippines even in severe cases; the Tebows decided against it. On August 14, 1987, Pamela Tebow gave birth to Tim Tebow in Manila.[10] When Tim was three years old, his family moved from the Philippines to Jacksonville, Florida.[11] Tebow is the youngest of five children.[10] He is of Belgian (Walloon) origin. His ancestor Andries Tebow sailed to America from Bruges in the 1680s.[12][13] He and his siblings were all homeschooled by their parents, who instilled the family's Christian beliefs.[14] Tebow is dyslexic and believes in his uniqueness as a gift from God.[15] He began his high school football career as a tight end for Trinity Christian Academy in Jacksonville. Before the 2003 season, he moved to nearby St. Johns County, making him eligible to play for the struggling football program at Allen D. Nease High School where he could play quarterback. He never enrolled at either school, however: his parents chose to home-school him. Florida law allows homeschooled students to participate on the team of the local high school in the school district in which they live, and private schools such as Trinity Christian Academy are also allowed to let homeschooled students play on their teams.[16][17] Tebow came to national prominence as a junior at Nease, known for his running and throwing abilities, as well as an intense competitiveness. Later that year, he suffered an injury to his right leg late in the first half of a game. At first believed to be suffering from a bad cramp, he actually played the entire second half with a broken fibula, at one point rushing for a 29-yard touchdown. After the game the extent of the injury was discovered and he was held out for the remainder of his junior season.[18] Nevertheless, he was named Florida's Player of the Year and became a major college football quarterback prospect.[19] During his senior season, he led the Nease Panthers to a state title, earned All-State honors, was named Florida's Mr. Football and a Parade magazine high school All-American, and repeated as Florida's Player of the Year.[19][20] He played in the U.S. Army All-American Bowl in San Antonio, Texas which featured the top 78 senior high school football players in the nation and was shown nationally on NBC television.[21] Tebow was the subject of an ESPN Faces in Sports documentary. The segment was titled \"Tim Tebow: The Chosen One\", and focused on Tebow's home schooling and missionary work in the Philippines, his athletic exploits, and the college recruiting process.[22] Tebow was also featured in Sports Illustrated on the \"Faces in the Crowd\" page.[23] In 2007, he was named to the Florida State Athletic Association's All-Century Team that listed the Top 33 football players in the state of Florida's 100-year history of high school football.[24] Despite family ties to the University of Florida, where his parents met as students,[14] Tebow considered other schools, including the University of Alabama.[25] On January 7, 2007, Tebow was featured prominently in an ESPN Outside The Lines feature on home-schooled athletes seeking equal access to high school athletics in other states. Because a home-schooler's access to public and private school athletic functions varies by state, Tebow and former defensive end Jason Taylor (who was allowed to play at his local high school in Pennsylvania) argued in favor of extending the right to play for local teams to more states.[26] Upon becoming the first home-schooled athlete to be nominated for the Heisman Trophy, he remarked, \"That's really cool. A lot of times people have this stereotype of home-schoolers as not very athletic – it's like, go win a spelling bee or something like that – it's an honor for me to be the first one to do that.\"[27] Tebow received the 2008 Quaqua Protégé Award as outstanding home-education graduate.[28] Tebow was heavily recruited by many college programs and almost accepted a scholarship offer from Mike Shula, then coach at Alabama.[29] Instead, he chose to attend the University of Florida and play for coach Urban Meyer's Florida Gators.[30] He was a key backup on Florida's 2006 national championship team, won the starting quarterback job and the Heisman Trophy in 2007, led the Gators to another BCS championship in 2008, and quarterbacked them to a 13–1 season in 2009. He served as team captain in 2008 and 2009, and he is the only three-time recipient of the Florida's most valuable player award, having been chosen by his teammates in 2007, 2008, and 2009.[31] Despite a strong showing in his first inter-squad scrimmage, head coach Urban Meyer named Tebow second-string behind Chris Leak.[32] A backup throughout the season, Tebow was a significant contributor to the Gators' 2006 success. He made his college debut coming off the bench in a goal line situation against Southern Miss. He rushed for a touchdown on a designed quarterback scramble on his first play.[33] In his next game, he led the team in rushing yards against UCF.[34] Tebow's biggest game in the season came against LSU on October 7, where he accounted for all three of the Gators' touchdowns, passing for two and rushing for another.[35] Tebow played a role in the Gators' victory in the 2007 BCS National Championship Game against Ohio State. He threw for one touchdown and rushed for another, finishing with 39 rushing yards.[36] He finished 2006 with the second-most rushing yards on the Gator team.[37][38] Although questions about his passing skill loomed, Tebow was named the Florida Gators starting quarterback for the 2007 season.[39] He opened the year 13-of-17 for 300 yards and three touchdowns in his starting debut against Western Kentucky.[40] Tebow finished the regular season with the second highest passing efficiency in the nation with 177.8. Additionally, he averaged 4.3 yards per carry on the ground.[41] Tebow set numerous personal, school, and national records in the 2007 season, including: On November 24, against Florida State, Tebow threw for three touchdowns and rushed for two in a 45–12 rout of the Seminoles. It was later revealed that Tebow fractured his right hand during the third quarter but played the rest of the game. He had to wear a cast for the next three weeks.[45] He led the SEC in pass completion percentage and rushing touchdowns.[46] After the 2007 season, Tebow was recognized as a first-team All-SEC selection and a consensus first-team All-American.[47][48] He won the Heisman Trophy, given to the most outstanding college football player of the year. Tebow also received the Davey O'Brien Award, annually given to the best quarterback in the nation, on February 18 in Fort Worth, Texas.[49] In addition, he won the Maxwell Award and AP Player of the Year.[50][51] On December 8, 2007, Tebow was awarded the Heisman Trophy, finishing ahead of Arkansas's Darren McFadden, Hawaii's Colt Brennan, and Missouri's Chase Daniel. He was the first sophomore to win the Heisman Trophy.[18] He garnered 462 first-place votes and 1,957 points, 254 points ahead of the runner-up, Arkansas running back Darren McFadden.[52][53] He finished the regular season as the only player in FBS history to rush and pass for at least 20 touchdowns in both categories in the same season.[54] He had 32 passing touchdowns, 23 rushing touchdowns, and became the third Florida player to win the Heisman Trophy, joining Steve Spurrier and Danny Wuerffel.[55] Before the 2007 season had even come to a close, Florida coach Urban Meyer stated that he would likely use two quarterbacks during the 2008 season to take some of the workload off of Tebow's shoulders.[57] Tebow led the Gators in rushing in 2007[58] but also had to play through a bruised shoulder and broken non-throwing hand.[57] Before the 2008 season even started, Tebow had his name pulled from consideration for the Playboy Preseason All-American team because it conflicted with his Christian beliefs.[59] On September 27, 2008, in the fourth week of the season, the undefeated No. 4 Gators lost to unranked Ole Miss at home, despite being 22-point favorites. After the game, Tebow delivered a speech to the media, later known as \"The Promise\" and later regarded as one of the most iconic speeches in college football history. In this speech, Tebow apologized for the loss and promised he and the team would do better. He would keep good on this promise, as the Gators would not lose another game for the rest of the season.[60][61][62][63] On November 1, 2008, playing against Georgia, Tebow ran for his 37th rushing touchdown, breaking the school record previously held by former Florida running back Emmitt Smith. Tebow helped lead the Gators to a 12–1 record in 2008. After clinching the SEC East title, the team played for and won the SEC title in the 2008 SEC Championship Game against Alabama. The win secured the #2 ranking in the final BCS standings, which earned the Gators the chance to play #1 ranked Oklahoma in the 2009 BCS National Championship Game, which they won 24–14.[64] He led the SEC in pass completion percentage and passing touchdowns.[65] Tebow finished third in the 2008 Heisman Trophy voting, with Oklahoma quarterback Sam Bradford taking the top spot followed by Texas quarterback Colt McCoy, despite Tebow receiving the most first-place votes.[66][67] He won the Maxwell Award in 2008, only the second player to ever win the award twice.[68] He won the Manning Award, Maxwell Award, and SEC Offensive Player of the Year.[69][70][71] On January 11, 2009, at a national championship celebration held at Ben Hill Griffin Stadium,[72] Tebow announced that he would not make himself eligible for the 2009 NFL draft, but would instead return for his senior season at Florida.[73] A day later, he had surgery on his right shoulder to remove a bone spur in an effort to reduce chronic inflammation.[74] Tebow opened the 2009 season continuing a streak of throwing and running for a touchdown in blowout wins over Charleston Southern and Troy.[76][77] He ran for a touchdown in the third game, a win against Tennessee, but failed to throw for a touchdown for the first time since his freshman season.[78] In answer to an interview question, Tebow stated he was a virgin.[79] The statement was subject to much discussion about whether the question was necessary, including criticism of the reporter who originally asked.[80][81][82] Tebow started against Kentucky despite suffering from a respiratory illness and taking two bags of intravenous fluids before the game.[83] He ran for two touchdowns to put him in 2nd place on the all-time SEC touchdown list and he also threw for a touchdown.[84] Late in the third quarter, he was hit in the chest by Kentucky defensive end Taylor Wyndham, fell backwards, and hit the back of his head on the knee of Florida tackle Marcus Gilbert.[83] He lay motionless for several minutes before being helped to the sidelines, where he appeared to vomit.[85] He was taken by ambulance to the University of Kentucky Chandler Medical Center.[85][83] A CT scan showed no bleeding in the brain, with the injury described as a mild concussion.[86] Coach Urban Meyer stayed the night in the hospital with Tebow, who was discharged in the morning.[87] Coincidentally, Florida did not have a game scheduled for the following Saturday, and Tebow was cleared to play in the Gators' next contest at LSU on October 10, two weeks after the incident.[88] On October 31, 2009, while playing against Georgia, Tebow ran for his 50th and 51st rushing touchdowns, breaking the SEC career record previously held by former Georgia running back Herschel Walker.[89] His penultimate collegiate game, the 2009 SEC Championship, saw him once again facing the University of Alabama. Tebow threw for 245 yards and a touchdown and led the team with 63 yards rushing, but the Gators fell 32–13 and lost their chance to play for a second consecutive national title.[90] Florida beat Cincinnati 51–24 in the 2010 Sugar Bowl the following January. In what was Tebow's last college game, he completed 31-of-35 passes for 482 yards and three touchdowns and accounted for four total touchdowns and 533 yards of total offense, which set a record for a Bowl Championship Series game.[91] He graduated from the University of Florida in December 2009.[92] At the end of his college career, Tebow held five National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA), 14 Southeastern Conference (SEC), and 28 University of Florida statistical records.[93] He was the SEC's all-time leader in career passing efficiency (170.8), completion percentage (67.1%), passing touchdown to interception ratio (5.5 to 1), rushing yards by a quarterback (2,947), rushing touchdowns (any position) (57), and total touchdowns responsible for (145).[4][94] Among many mentions in the NCAA Division-I record book, Tebow is ranked second in career passing efficiency, third in career yards per attempt (9.33), 8th in career rushing touchdowns, and also owns the record for most consecutive games in which he both threw at least one touchdown pass and scored at least one rushing touchdown (14).[95] In 2010, a new rule for the next NCAA football season banned messages on eye paint. This rule was dubbed \"The Tebow Rule\"[117][118][119] by media.[119] During his college football career, Tebow frequently wore references to biblical verses on his eye black. In the 2009 BCS Championship Game, he wore John 3:16 on his eye black; the verse was the highest-ranked Google search term over the next 24 hours, generating over 90 million searches.[120][121][122][123] Additionally, later, when Tebow switched to another verse, there were 3.43 million searches of \"Tim Tebow\" and \"Proverbs 3:5–6\" together.[124] Tebow stated of the searches \"It just goes to show you the influence and the platform that you have as a student-athlete and as a quarterback at Florida\".[124] Despite the media labeling it as the Tebow rule, the NCAA denies the rule was influenced by Tebow in particular, since many other notable players (Reggie Bush and Terrelle Pryor for example) wore messages on eye black.[125][126] An NCAA spokesman said: \"When this rule was proposed, the committee did not focus on any one team or student athlete. That measure reinforces what the intended use of eye black is, which is to shade the eyes from the sun.\"[126] The NFL already had a rule prohibiting players from wearing messages on eye black dating back to Jim McMahon's time with the Chicago Bears, so Tebow could not have continued the practice in the NFL.[119] After passing on the 2009 NFL draft for his senior season at Florida, Tebow went on to enter the 2010 NFL draft. Despite his college success, Tebow's NFL potential was much debated. At the time, Jon Gruden said Tebow was \"the strongest human being that's ever played the position\" and \"is the kind of guy who could revolutionize the game\".[127] Former Indianapolis Colts coach Tony Dungy said he would pick Tebow with a top 10 pick over any quarterback in the 2010 Draft.[128] However, NFL analyst Mel Kiper Jr. believed Tebow did not have the intangibles to play quarterback in the NFL. \"I don't think he can be a fulltime quarterback. I don't think he can be the quarterback of the future for you, but I do think in the third round, maybe the second round, he'll be the same as Pat White\", said Kiper.[129] Tebow was particularly mentioned as a potential third-round pick of the Jacksonville Jaguars, his hometown team. Some, including Florida governor Charlie Crist, suggested that Tebow could be the remedy for dwindling Jaguars ticket sales at EverBank Field.[130] Early in the 2009 season, Jaguars owner Wayne Weaver stated: \"He (Tebow) clearly is an outstanding football player and would be an asset to any football organization. Clearly there's going to be a groundswell for Tebow, and we'll have to make that evaluation if we have a draft pick that's going to be anywhere near him.\"[131] Not everyone in the organization agreed, as Jaguar lineman Uche Nwaneri posted doubts about Tebow's potential NFL success on his team's website message board.[132] Tebow was selected by the Denver Broncos in the first round (25th overall) of the 2010 NFL draft.[135] The Broncos had acquired the pick in a trade with the Baltimore Ravens on the first night of the draft for the Broncos' second, third and fourth round picks.[136] Broncos head coach Josh McDaniels said about drafting Tebow, \"He has all the traits you look for. It's a good pick.\"[137] When asked how Tebow will be used, McDaniels commented that Tebow probably wouldn't start at quarterback as a rookie, and that he'll, \"Play when he's ready.\" The Denver Post columnist Woody Paige praised the pick, saying \"Tim Tremendous may be high risk, but he will be a Mile High Reward.\"[138] He set an NFL Draft record for jersey sales and continued to have the top selling jersey through the 2010 season.[139] On July 29, Tebow signed a five-year contract with the Broncos that had a base value of $11.25 million (he could make as much as $33 million through certain performance-based incentives). The contract included $8.7 million guaranteed.[140] On October 17, Tebow scored his first NFL touchdown, which was a five-yard running play against the New York Jets.[141] On November 14, Tebow threw a three-yard touchdown pass to fullback Spencer Larsen on his first career NFL pass attempt, as part of a 49–29 home victory over the Kansas City Chiefs. He also added a one-yard rushing touchdown in the game.[142] Tebow started his first NFL game on December 19, which was a 39–23 road loss to the Oakland Raiders.[143] He completed 8-of-16 passes for 138 yards, including a 33-yard touchdown pass. He also rushed for 78 yards, 40 of which came on a touchdown run in the first quarter of the game.[144] It was the longest touchdown run for a quarterback in Broncos history and the longest touchdown run in NFL history for a quarterback in his first start.[citation needed] Tebow's first career victory came in his second start on December 26. The Broncos defeated the Houston Texans, 24–23, in Denver.[145] He helped rally the Broncos from a 17–0 deficit at halftime, as he finished the game with 308 passing yards and one touchdown pass. He also added a fourth-quarter rushing touchdown, which capped the comeback.[146] Tebow finished his rookie season playing sparingly in six games as a back-up (primarily on plays involving the wild horse formation, which is Denver's variation of the wildcat formation) before starting the last three games of the Broncos' season. He passed for a total of 654 yards, five touchdowns and three interceptions. He also rushed for 227 yards and six touchdowns.[147] He became the first quarterback in NFL history to rush for a touchdown in each of his first three career starts.[citation needed] Tebow began the 2011 season as the Denver Broncos' backup quarterback, behind Kyle Orton.[148][149] After the Broncos started 1–3, Tebow replaced Orton at halftime during a home game against the San Diego Chargers in week five.[150][151] Tebow passed and ran for a touchdown in the fourth quarter, narrowing a 16-point difference to an ultimate 29–24 loss.[152] Shortly afterward, Broncos' head coach John Fox announced Tebow would start in the following game on the road against the Miami Dolphins.[153] Tebow struggled for three-and-a-half quarters against the Dolphins, taking six sacks, but rallied from a 15–0 deficit in the last three minutes to win the game 18–15 in overtime.[154][155] The next week, Tebow took seven sacks in a 45–10 loss to the Detroit Lions.[156] On November 6, Tebow rushed for 118 yards, along with passing for 124 yards and two touchdowns, as part of a 38–24 road victory over the Oakland Raiders, second only to Norris Weese in Broncos history for rushing by a quarterback.[157] The Broncos followed with another road win over the Kansas City Chiefs. Tebow completed two passes on eight attempts for 69 yards and a touchdown.[158] His second completion, a 56-yard touchdown pass in the fourth quarter to wide receiver Eric Decker, sealed the game for Denver.[159] Four days later, Tebow was 9-for-20 with 104 yards in a Thursday Night Football home game against the New York Jets.[160] He led a 95-yard, game-winning touchdown drive with less than six minutes to play, capped by a 20-yard touchdown run on third-and-four with less than one minute remaining.[161] Tebow guided the Broncos to another comeback victory the next week—a 16–13 overtime road win over the San Diego Chargers, where he ran the ball 22 times for 67 yards.[162] In the tenth start of his NFL career, Tebow led the Broncos to their third consecutive come-from-behind win at the Minnesota Vikings, 35–32;[163] followed by a fourth comeback win, this time 13–10 in overtime at home over the Chicago Bears after being shut out for almost 58 minutes.[164] It was the last regular-season win of Tebow's career. In week 15, Tebow rushed for two touchdowns and completed 11-of-22 passes against the New England Patriots in a 41–23 loss. He was sacked four times in the game and had one fumble.[165] In the Broncos' 40–14 loss to the Buffalo Bills the following week, he had one passing and one rushing touchdown but also threw three interceptions, two of which were returned for touchdowns, and two fumbles.[166] He struggled for a third straight game the following week in a 7–3 loss to the Kansas City Chiefs, completing only 6-of-22 passes and finishing with a career-low quarterback rating of 20.6, but a loss by the Oakland Raiders clinched a playoff spot for the Broncos in the AFC West.[167][168] After the three consecutive losses, Broncos vice president and former quarterback John Elway said Tebow was playing tentatively and needed to \"pull the trigger\".[169][170] On January 8, Denver hosted the Pittsburgh Steelers during the Wild Card Round of the NFL playoffs. Tebow completed 10-of-21 passes for a career-high 316 yards and two touchdowns, including an 80-yard touchdown to Demaryius Thomas on the first play of overtime, as the Broncos won 29–23.[170] Media sources noted Tebow's passing yards (316) and yards per completion (31.6) evoked the Bible's John 3:16. The Nielsen ratings for the game also peaked at 31.6. John 3:16 was the top search item on Google the next morning, followed by Tebow and Tim Tebow.[171][172] The next week, Tebow completed just nine of 26 passes and took five sacks in a 45–10 defeat at the hands of the New England Patriots in the Divisional Round.[173][174] After the season, Elway confirmed that Tebow would be the Broncos' starting quarterback going into training camp in 2012.[175] Despite on-field successes by the Broncos under Tebow, he finished the season with the lowest passing completion rate in the NFL (reaching 50% in just four of his 14 games) which led many to question his potential as a quarterback at the professional level.[176] Tebow's persistent fumbles also created uncertainty about his future as a quarterback.[177][178][179] After the Broncos signed free agent Peyton Manning,[180] Tebow was traded to the New York Jets on March 21, 2012, along with the Broncos' 2012 seventh round draft pick, in exchange for the Jets' fourth and sixth round picks.[181] Jets special teams coordinator Mike Westhoff stated that Tebow would be used on special teams,[182] while head coach Rex Ryan and offensive coordinator Tony Sparano stated that he would also be used in the wildcat formation on offense.[183] The presence of Tebow throughout the season, in which the Jets struggled, created a controversy as the fans and media called for Ryan to bench the inconsistent Mark Sanchez in favor of Tebow.[184] Tebow suffered two broken ribs during a road game against the Seattle Seahawks, but his injury was not confirmed until two days before the Jets' Thanksgiving game against the New England Patriots. He was active despite the injury, which was publicly revealed after the game.[185] Tebow was inactive during the Jets' subsequent game against the Arizona Cardinals in which Sanchez was benched in favor of Greg McElroy.[186] On April 29, 2013, Tebow was released by the Jets. He had thrown only eight passes and rushed 32 times in his one season with the team.[187] The New England Patriots signed Tebow on June 10, 2013, the day before the team's mandatory minicamp;[188][189][190] Tebow signed a two-year contract with no guaranteed money, although it did have playing time-based incentives in 2014. The move reunited him with Josh McDaniels, who had resumed his positions as Patriots offensive coordinator and quarterbacks coach.[191] Tebow played in the first two of New England's preseason games, against the Philadelphia Eagles and the Tampa Bay Buccaneers; he completed just five passes in both games, was sacked several times and intercepted once, intensifying criticism of his football acumen.[192] He went 6-for-11 for 91 yards, throwing a pair of touchdown passes and one interception, and gained 30 yards on six carries against the New York Giants, but he also was sacked four times. He threw a total of two touchdown passes and two interceptions in the preseason and had a passer rating of 47.2 and completed 36.7% of his passes.[193] He was released from the Patriots on August 31, 2013, the day NFL teams were required to cut their rosters to 53. After being cut, he publicly thanked the Patriots organization for the opportunity and stated: \"I will remain in relentless pursuit of continuing my lifelong dream of being an NFL quarterback.\"[194] Though he began his broadcasting career in December 2013 on the SEC Network, Tebow continued to seek opportunities to resume his career as an NFL quarterback.[195] Tebow signed a one-year contract with the Philadelphia Eagles on April 20, 2015, and was in competition with Matt Barkley for the Eagles third-string quarterback job.[196] Tebow played all four games in the preseason with no starts, going 21-of-36 for 286 yards, two touchdowns, and one interception, while rushing for 82 yards and a touchdown.[197] He was released by the team on September 5, following the fourth preseason game.[198] On May 20, 2021, after spending six years out of football, Tebow contacted his former college coach, Urban Meyer, then coach of the Jacksonville Jaguars, about returning to the sport.[199] The Jaguars signed him as a tight end to a one-year contract for the veteran minimum of $920,000, none of which was guaranteed.[200] The Jaguars released Tebow on August 17, 2021. He had not caught any passes or played on special teams during limited playing time in the preseason.[199] Tebow's football background combined with his outspoken views on Christianity led some media pundits to label him as a 'cultural phenomenon',[201][202][203][204][205][206] while some Denver Broncos teammates and team management reportedly described him as 'self-centered' and a hypocrite.[207] A nationwide controversy surrounded Tebow's decision to appear in an ad funded by the socially conservative organization Focus on the Family that was broadcast on February 7, 2010, during Super Bowl XLIV on CBS.[208][209] There were two 30-second commercials which included Tebow's personal story as part of a pro-life stance. The abortion issue was not specifically mentioned in the ad.[210] Pro-choice groups criticized the ad,[211] while pro-life groups supported Tebow.[212] In 2011, Tebow was the first quarterback to be featured in ESPN's \"Year of the Quarterback\" series. The documentary, titled Tim Tebow: Everything in Between, followed him from the 2010 Sugar Bowl to the 2010 NFL draft. It premiered on January 6, 2011.[213] On November 8, 2011, the documentary was released on DVD. On May 31, 2011, HarperCollins released Through My Eyes, an autobiography that Tebow co-wrote with author Nathan Whitaker. Tebow details his early life growing up in Jacksonville and the Philippines, as well as his experiences as a college football quarterback.[214] By March 4, 2012, it had spent 24 weeks on the New York Times best seller list.[215] It was named the #1 sports book of 2011.[216] Tim followed his memoir with a young readers' edition titled Through My Eyes: A Quarterback's Journey, also co-written with Whitaker.[217] Tebow was the subject of a 2012 documentary on NFL Network's A Football Life entitled The Faces of Tebow.[218] He is a spokesperson for Nike, Jockey International, FRS Health Energy, and TiVo.[219][220][221][222] In 2013, Tebow collaborated with headphone maker Soul Electronics to create his own signature line of headphones. He launched a line which he called the 'Jet'.[223] In an episode that aired on February 4, 2016, Tebow competed against The Vampire Diaries actress Nina Dobrev on Spike's Lip Sync Battle. Tebow won the lip-sync contest with performances of \"Take Your Time\" by Sam Hunt and \"Eye of the Tiger\" by Survivor.[224] On December 30, 2013, Tebow was hired by ESPN as a college football analyst. He appears mainly on the SEC Network as co-host of SEC Nation, a travelling pre-game show, and contributed to ESPN's other platforms as well; Tebow made his debut on ESPN during the 2014 BCS National Championship Game. He did not give up on playing in the NFL, however, as his contract allowed him to continue to pursue opportunities as a player.[225] Tebow signed a multi-year extension of his contract with ESPN in 2017. His new contract allowed him to continue to pursue his pro baseball career.[226] Tebow was asked to co-host ABC News' Good Morning America on January 31, 2014, two days before Super Bowl XLVIII, and was joined on the morning show by Eli Manning.[227][228][229][230][231] Tebow also hosted two television shows, the second season of Home Free, a reality show about home renovation on Fox in 2016,[232] and Million Dollar Mile, an obstacle course competition show in 2019 on CBS.[233] On September 2, 2021, shortly after his release from the Jaguars, Tebow joined First Take, a talk show run by Stephen A. Smith.[234] Tim Tebow was executive producer[235] along with his older brother Robby Tebow, and actor in his first movie Run the Race which was released on February 22, 2019, in the U.S. This film is an inspirational sports drama with a football theme.[236] In early August 2016, Tebow made announcements that he was interested in pursuing a career in professional baseball and invited all 30 Major League Baseball teams to his open tryout at the end of August.[237] Tebow had not played baseball full-time since 2005, his junior year in high school, when he was an all-state player and the Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim expressed interest in drafting him had he played his senior year.[238] Additionally, he had a tryout with and received interest from the Los Angeles Dodgers prior to the 2016 Major League Baseball season.[239] On August 9, Tebow received contract offers (without tryouts) from two minor independent professional teams: the Schaumburg Boomers of the Frontier League and the Southern Maryland Blue Crabs of the Atlantic League of Professional Baseball.[240][241][242] On the day before his tryout, Tebow was also offered a contract by Águilas del Zulia, a team in the Venezuelan Professional Baseball League that plays winter baseball.[243] Tebow held his tryout on August 30 at Dedeaux Field in front of 40 MLB scouts (from 28 of the 30 MLB teams), Dodgers scouting director Billy Gasparino, and 50 members of the media.[244] On September 8, 2016, Tebow signed a minor league contract with the New York Mets and participated in the Mets' instructional league.[245][246][247] In his first at bat with the organization, on September 28, 2016, Tebow hit a home run on the first pitch.[248] The Mets assigned him to the Scottsdale Scorpions of the Arizona Fall League,[249] where he batted .194 in 70 plate appearances, with 20 strikeouts in 62 at bats.[250] Tebow spent most of 2017 spring training in the Mets' minor league camp, with a few appearances in major league camp.[251][252] He began the 2017 regular season with the Columbia Fireflies of the Class A South Atlantic League.[253] On April 6, 2017, Tebow hit a home run in his first at bat for the Fireflies, playing against the Augusta GreenJackets.[254] He batted .222 with three home runs and 23 runs batted in for Columbia. On June 25, the Mets promoted Tebow to the St. Lucie Mets of the Class A-Advanced Florida State League.[255] Once again he homered in his first day with his new club, St. Lucie, on June 28.[256] Tebow had a 12-game hitting streak between July 3 and 14.[257] Tebow finished the year at St. Lucie hitting .231, with 5 home runs and 57 strikeouts, in 216 at bats. Tebow expressed interest in returning for another season in 2018.[258] On January 19, 2018, the Mets announced that they would invite Tebow to major league camp.[259] Despite a poor showing in spring training (1-for-18 with 11 strikeouts), the Mets organization promoted Tebow to their Double-A team, the Binghamton Rumble Ponies of the Eastern League. On April 5, Tebow again hit a home run in his first at bat for a new team; with two men on base, he hit the first pitch over the right-field wall.[260] On June 29, Tebow was named to the Eastern League All-Star Game; at the time, he was batting .261 for the season and .323 in his last 21 games.[261] In the All-Star Game, held on July 11, Tebow went 1-for-4 as the East team's designated hitter.[262] On July 23, the Mets organization announced that Tebow had broken the hamate bone in his right hand, which required surgery and led him to miss the remainder of the season.[263] In November 2018, the Mets assigned Tebow to the Syracuse Mets of the Class AAA International League.[264] He spent spring training in 2019 with the New York Mets, and returned to Syracuse to start the 2019 season.[265] On May 18, 2019, the Syracuse Mets held a Tebow bobblehead giveaway for the first 1,000 fans in attendance.[266] Between June 28 and July 5, 2019, Tebow hit three home runs over an AAA six game stretch for the Syracuse Mets, his best performance as a professional baseball player.[267] On July 21, 2019, Tebow injured his left pinky fielding a ball in the outfield, requiring eight stitches. As a result, he missed the remainder of the 2019 season.[268] On February 25, Tebow hit his first major league spring training home run,[269] a two-run home run against Detroit Tigers' reliever Alex Wilson.[270] On February 17, Tebow and the Mets formally announced his retirement from professional baseball.[271][272] [273] Tebow accepted an invitation by the Philippines national team to play on their 2021 World Baseball Classic team. He was eligible to play for the Philippines as he was born there. He was scheduled to play in the qualifying round in March 2020 in Arizona, but the tournament was cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic.[269][274] In July 2023, Tebow was announced as a co-owner of an ECHL expansion team to be based in the Lake Tahoe area, later named the Tahoe Knight Monsters. Tebow was also previously a minor partner in the ECHL's Jacksonville Icemen and Savannah Ghost Pirates.[275] Tebow is also an investor in USL Championship and USL Super League soccer club Sporting Club Jacksonville.[276] \"Tebowing\" is a neologism for the act of kneeling on one knee in prayer specifically with one's head bowed and an arm resting on the one bent knee, a form of genuflecting.[277][278] It is derived from Tebow's propensity for kneeling and praying. The origin of the phrase is credited to fan Jared Kleinstein, who posted a picture with friends on Facebook, in which they mimicked a pose of Tebow following the Broncos' comeback overtime victory over the Dolphins on October 23, 2011.[279] The popularity of the picture led Kleinstein to set up a website showing pictures submitted by people depicting various interpretations of \"Tebowing\" all over the world.[279] After two-and-a-half months, the site received 20,000 photograph submissions and 20 million page views from 2 million unique visitors.[280] The New York Times wrote \"it can be hard to tell whether [people Tebowing] are celebrating or mocking [Tebow] for his virtuous ways.\"[278] Pittsburgh mayor Luke Ravenstahl Tebowed as part of a bet with the mayor of Denver following the Broncos playoff victory over the Steelers in 2012.[281] On October 9, 2012, Tebow was awarded the trademark to \"Tebowing\" after winning a legal battle with two fans who had expressed interest in trademarking the name.[282] \"Tebowing\" was included as a feature in the Madden NFL 13 video game.[283] On January 10, 2019, Tebow announced his engagement to Miss Universe 2017 and South African model Demi-Leigh Nel-Peters.[284] The couple were married during a 30-minute ceremony in South Africa on January 20, 2020.[285][286] Tebow has appeared repeatedly at events in opposition to abortion, including the 2021 March for Life, where he was a featured speaker. He has been described as \"staunch pro-life activist\", which he in part attributes to his mother's decision to carry him.[287] Tebow was elected to the College Football Hall of Fame on January 9, 2023, and was inducted on December 5, 2023.[288][289] Tebow is known for his outspoken Christian faith.[290][291] In the Philippines, he preached at schools and villages, and assisted with medical care.[292][293] Tebow supports more than 40 national evangelists working in that nation.[293] In the United States, Tebow has shared his Christian faith in prisons and schools, to church and youth groups, and at meetings and conferences.[290][292] Tebow is a strong advocate for faith-based abstinence, and has publicly stated that he had maintained his virginity before marriage.[294][295] Tebow has spoken multiple times at events presented by the Fellowship of Christian Athletes.[296][297] An Easter Sunday crowd of roughly 20,000 in Florida listened to Tebow on April 8, 2012. He only briefly mentioned his move from Denver to New York, saying, \"Kind of got traded. I'm on another team—excited to be a Jet. Regardless of what happens, I still honor my Lord and Savior Jesus Christ, because at the end of the day, that's what's important, win or lose. ... We need to get back to one nation under God, and be role models for kids.\"[298][299] Honoring his commitment to his religious beliefs and his humanitarian work, Liberty University awarded an honorary Doctorate of Humanities to Tebow on May 15, 2021.[300] Tebow envisioned a foundation to give back to others during his college career, and he, along with other University of Florida students, created \"First and 15\", raising funds for Uncle Dick's Orphanage[301] [clarification needed] in the Philippines, founded by his father's nonprofit association, the Bob Tebow Evangelistic Association.[292] He also raised money for Shands Hospital pediatric cancer center in Gainesville and a Disney trip for disadvantaged children. Upon graduation from University of Florida, Tebow launched the Tim Tebow Foundation in January 2010.[302] In 2013, Tebow was designated a Great Floridian by Florida Governor Rick Scott in recognition of his \"major contributions to the progress and welfare\" of Florida.[303] CURE and the Tebow Foundation announced plans to build a children's hospital in the fall of 2011 in the Philippines, the country where Tebow was born.

                "content": "Our editors will review what you’ve submitted and determine whether to revise the article. Tim Tebow (born August 14, 1987, Makati, Philippines) is a former American football player who was a dominant dual-threat quarterback at the University of Florida, in Gainesville, where he won a Heisman Trophy and led the team to two national championships. After playing briefly in the NFL, he spent several years as a baseball player in the minor leagues and later became a television broadcaster. Starting in high school, Tebow garnered extensive media coverage and won a devoted fan following for his athletic heroics and personal humility. He is also known for speaking openly about his Christian faith. Tebow’s parents, Bob and Pam Tebow, met in the late 1960s while attending the University of Florida and were married in 1971. In 1985 the Tebows—who by then had four children—moved to the Philippines to serve as missionaries. While living in Makati, Pam Tebow became seriously ill with dysentery. She later stated that doctors, upon realizing that she was pregnant, recommended that she have an abortion because the medicine that they had given her to treat the illness had resulted in placental abruption, a condition that deprives the fetus of oxygen and necessary nutrients. Because of their faith and opposition to abortion, the Tebows opted to go through with the pregnancy, and Tim Tebow was born with no lasting health concerns. During the 2010 Super Bowl, Tim and Pam Tebow appeared in a controversial antiabortion advertisement sponsored by the conservative Christian ministry Focus on the Family, in which Pam Tebow called her son “my miracle baby.” In 1990 the Tebows moved to a farm outside Jacksonville, Florida. Tim Tebow, like his siblings, was homeschooled from kindergarten through 12th grade. Florida law that allows homeschooled children to participate in local high-school sports programs, meant he played for Trinity Christian Academy’s football team during his freshman year. The next year he began playing for Nease High School, where he was QB and excelled as a left-handed passer with a strong arm and exhibited adept running instincts. By the end of his senior year, Tebow had broken the state record for passing yards and had led Nease to the state championship. Already well-known in Florida, he was introduced to the broader public as the subject of an ESPN documentary called Tim Tebow: The Chosen One (2005). Heavily recruited by numerous division I schools, in 2006 Tebow opted to join his parents’ alma mater, the University of Florida, to play under head coach Urban Meyer. He was named backup quarterback during his freshman year and was used selectively, more for his running than his passing; the Gators won the BCS national championship. The following year Tebow assumed starting duties. Over the course of the season he proved himself to be one of the country’s top offensive players: he threw for 3,286 yards and 32 touchdowns and rushed for 895 yards and 23 touchdowns. In December 2007 Tebow received the Heisman Trophy, becoming the first ever underclassman (a freshman or sophomore) to win the award. In 2008 Meyer announced that Tebow would be part of a two-quarterback system in order to alleviate some of the physical wear and tear on the young star. Tebow excelled under the new arrangement, helping to lead the Gators to a 13–1 record that ended with another BCS national championship. Despite his lighter workload, Tebow still managed to throw and run for 3,419 total yards, recording 42 touchdowns. In 2009 Tebow again colead the Gators to a 13–1 record, though they missed out on the BCS championship game after losing to the University of Alabama in the Southeastern Conference championship. In his final college season, Tebow was again prolific in passing and running, amassing 3,805 total yards and 35 touchdowns. Throughout his time in Gainesville, Tebow attracted a huge amount of media coverage, partly for the serious way he treated the game. After what turned out to be the team’s only loss of the 2008 season, he addressed the media in a speech that went viral, declaring, on the edge of tears: I just want to say one thing to the fans and everybody in Gator Nation. I’m sorry. Extremely sorry. We were hoping for an undefeated season. That was my goal.…But I promise you one thing: a lot of good will come out of this. You have never seen any player in the entire country play as hard as I will play the rest of this season, and you’ll never see someone push the rest of the team as hard as I will push everybody the rest of this season. You’ll never see a team play harder than we will the rest of the season. God bless. Tebow, who had a clean-cut image and spoke about abstaining from sex before marriage, also drew attention for his outward displays of his faith. He talked frequently about doing missionary work with his family, prayed openly, and wrote references to Bible verses on the eye black he wore for every game. Although Tebow had much success in college, he was considered an uncertain professional prospect because he threw with an awkward motion and was thought to rely more on his grit than outstanding skill. Nevertheless, he was selected by the Denver Broncos with the 25th pick in the 2010 NFL draft. He began his professional career as a backup quarterback and started three games, going 1–2 with five touchdowns and three interceptions. Tebow was named the Broncos’ starting quarterback after week five of his second season. Some of the old football magic reemerged, as he led the Broncos to a 7–1 record—including three overtime victories—in his first eights starts, engineering a series of second-half comebacks after starting each game playing poorly. The crowning moment of his NFL career came in the wild card game of the playoffs, when Tebow threw a game-winning touchdown pass on the first snap in overtime against the Pittsburgh Steelers. During Tebow’s thrilling 2011 run as the Denver Broncos’ starting quarterback, TV broadcasts frequently showed him kneeling in prayer on the sidelines during games. The image quickly became a meme, and people around the world photographed themselves mimicking his contemplative crouch. Despite the excitement generated by that winning run, Tebow remained an inconsistent quarterback and finished the 2011 season with a 46.5 completion percentage. After the season, the Broncos signed Peyton Manning and traded Tebow to the New York Jets. Tebow was a backup during his lone season in New York, and, despite fans calling for his promotion to starter, he threw only eight passes. He was waived by the Jets after the season. Tebow attempted a number of comebacks after his release by the Jets. In 2013 and 2015 he was signed to a preseason roster by the New England Patriots and the Philadelphia Eagles, respectively. In both cases he was released before the season began. He then switched his focus to pursuing baseball, a sport he had played also in high school. In 2016 he was signed to a minor-league affiliate of the New York Mets. He reached triple-A in 2019 and was invited several times to major league spring training camps before retiring in 2021. That year Tebow’s hometown Jacksonville Jaguars signed him to their preseason squad to play tight end. He was released before the season, marking the end of his athletic career. Tebow has appeared on television broadcasts as a commentator for the ESPN-owned SEC Network since 2014. In addition, he has written several books, including the memoir Through My Eyes (2011, with Nathan Whitaker) and, with A.J. Gregory, Shaken: Discovering Your True Identity in the Midst of Life’s Storms (2018), the children’s book Bronco and Friends: A Party to Remember (2021), and Mission Possible: Go Create a Life that Counts (2023). In 2020 Tebow married South African model Demi-Leigh Nel-Peters, the 2017 winner of the Miss Universe pageant. Under the auspices of the Tim Tebow Foundation (established in 2010), the couple is actively involved in Christian ministry, especially to those with special needs. In January 2023 he was named to the College Football Hall of Fame.",

Darius Garland did his damage in the second half, scoring 24 points plus seven assists. Evan Mobley had 22 points and 13 rebounds, while Jarett Allen and Max Strus each had 16 and 13 points, respectively. On the other hand, it was a total team effort for the Indiana Pacers with seven players scoring in double figures. It wasn't enough after Pascal Siakam was shut down in the second half. Siakam had 23 points in the game, scoring 21 of them in the first two quarters. Andrew Nembhard had 10 points and nine assists, while Bennedict Mathurin contributed 19 points.

                "content": "Los Angeles (United States) (AFP) – The Cleveland Cavaliers, fueled by 35 points from Donovan Mitchell, beat the Indiana Pacers 127-117 on Tuesday, avenging a Sunday defeat and pushing their NBA-best record to 34-5. Issued on: 15/01/2025 - 05:21Modified: 15/01/2025 - 06:35 Three days after the Pacers ended their 12-game winning streak -- handing the Cavs just their second home loss of the season -- Cleveland traveled to Indianapolis and halted the Pacers' six-game win streak. Mitchell set an early tone, scoring 19 points in the first quarter. Indiana briefly grabbed a two-point lead early in the second quarter and trailed by just one at halftime, but the Cavaliers outscored the Pacers 38-28 in the third to take control. Pascal Siakam led the Pacers with 23 points. Bennedict Mathurin added 19 before he was ejected late in the fourth quarter after receiving his second technical foul for bumping into an official as he disputed a call. He received his first technical for hanging on the rim after a stunning dunk in the second quarter. Seven Pacers players scored in double figures, but with star Tyrese Haliburton sidelined by a groin injury, it wasn't enough. Cavaliers coach Kenny Atkinson said it was the response he was looking for after Sunday's defeat. \"It was a playoff-type response,\" Atkinson said. \"You get knocked in the teeth, punched in the mouth, and we responded. \"Really, Donovan set the tone. It was one of those nights where he wasn't going to let us lose.\" Cleveland's Evan Mobley scored 13 of his 22 points in the decisive third period and Darius Garland added 24 for the Cavs, who will face the Thunder in Oklahoma City on Thursday in a clash of teams with the best records in the league. Western Conference leaders Oklahoma City pushed their record to 33-6 with a 118-102 wire-to-wire victory over the injury-depleted 76ers in Philadelphia. Thunder guard Shai Gilgeous-Alexander, who endured a poor shooting night in Sunday's win over the lowly Washington Wizards, made all eight of his shot attempts in the first half and finished an efficient 12-of-15 from the floor on the way to 32 points. Gilgeous-Alexander made seven of his eight free-throw attempts, grabbed three rebounds and handed out nine assists as the Thunder cruised past a Sixers team missing not only injured center Joel Embiid but also Paul George and Tyrese Maxey. \"I just tried to be aggressive, tried to set the tone,\" Gilgeous-Alexander said after Oklahoma City notched their 18th win in their last 19 regular-season games. Embiid, who has played in just 13 games this season, remained sidelined by a sprained foot. Maxey was ruled out with a hand injury while George was a late scratch with a sore right ankle. Jamal Murray and Nikola Jokic led the Denver Nuggets to a 118-99 victory over the short-handed Mavericks in Dallas. Murray scored 45 points and NBA Most Valuable Player Jokic notched a triple-double of 10 points, 14 rebounds and 10 assists for the Nuggets, who beat the Mavs for the second time in three days. On Sunday they rallied from a 19-point third-quarter deficit to win, but with 19 first-quarter points from Murray Denver took control early on the way to a fourth straight win. Daniel Gafford led the Mavericks with 13 points off the bench and Kyrie Irving scored 11 in his return from a back sprain that sidelined him five games. But the Mavs, still without star Luka Doncic, saw Dereck Lively II depart early in the first quarter with a sprained right ankle. Milwaukee star Giannis Antetokounmpo delivered a 33-point triple double, adding 11 rebounds and 13 assists as the Bucks snapped the Sacramento Kings' seven-game winning streak with a 130-115 victory. The Bucks, coming off a lopsided loss to the Knicks, scored 47 points in the first quarter and never trailed, leading by as many as 28 points. In Atlanta, Trae Young scored 43 points to propel the Hawks to a 122-117 victory over the Phoenix Suns. © 2025 AFP © 2025 Copyright France 24 - All rights reserved.

                "content": "Editions: En/mlb Former MLB prodigy declared dead at 37 years of age Brian Matusz, once a promising MLB prospect and former Baltimore Orioles pitcher, passed away on January 6 at age 37. According to a Phoenix police report obtained by the Baltimore Banner, his death is suspected to be a drug overdose. Matusz was found by his mother, Elizabeth, at his Phoenix home. She discovered drug paraphernalia and a white substance near his body. The police report revealed that Matusz had a history of substance abuse and had recently expressed feelings of hopelessness. \"There is nothing left for me,\" Matusz is reported as saying recently. On January 4, just days before his passing, Elizabeth took Matusz to the emergency room. While the reason for the visit was redacted in the report, he was advised to seek help from a mental health professional. Later that day, Elizabeth brought him to Banner Behavioral Health Hospital in Scottsdale, but he was not admitted. Born and raised in Phoenix, Matusz's talent on the mound led him to star at the University of San Diego before being selected fourth overall by the Orioles in the 2008 MLB Draft. He showed glimpses of his potential during his nine-year career, posting a 27-41 record with a 4.92 ERA. After leaving the major leagues in 2016, he attempted a comeback in 2019 with the Long Island Ducks of the Atlantic League. Despite his career achievements, transitioning away from professional baseball posed significant challenges for Matusz. Former Oriole Jerry Hairston Jr., a close friend, reflected on these struggles. \"When you are so used to having a schedule... and then it just abruptly ends, you are trying to figure out what is your purpose,\" he told the Baltimore Banner. Hairston described Matusz as an \"incredible human being\" and expressed shock over his passing. \"For his life to be cut short at 37... it's just shocking.

                "content": "Brian Robert Matusz (/ˈmætəs/ MAT-əs; February 11, 1987 – January 6, 2025) was an American professional baseball pitcher. He played in Major League Baseball (MLB) for the Baltimore Orioles and the Chicago Cubs from 2009 to 2016. Matusz attended St. Mary's High School in Phoenix, Arizona, graduating in 2005.[1] He enrolled at the University of San Diego, where he played college baseball for the San Diego Toreros as a starting pitcher. Matusz, Josh Romanski, and Matt Couch anchored the Toreros rotation.[2] In 2008, Matusz was named to the West Coast Conference Pitcher of the Year honors and finalist for the Roger Clemens Award.[3] The Baltimore Orioles selected Matusz in the first round, with the fourth overall selection, in the 2008 MLB draft. Matusz signed a contract with the Orioles on August 15, 2008, the deadline to sign draft picks.[3][4] The Orioles invited him to spring training as a nonroster player in 2009. In June 2009, he was promoted from high Single-A (Frederick Keys) to a starting pitcher for the Double-A Bowie Baysox. He struck out 10 batters in his first start for Bowie on June 17. Matusz was named Baseball America's ninth best overall prospect mid-season in 2009.[5] Before the 2010 season, Baseball America named him the fifth best prospect in all of baseball.[6] Matusz made his MLB debut on August 4, 2009, against the Detroit Tigers. He went five innings, allowing six hits, one earned run and striking out five. He earned a win in his effort. On September 14, the O's decided to shut him down for the remainder of the season, wary of overextending the rookie in his first big league season.[7] He was named a starting pitcher on Baseball America's 2010 All-Rookie Team.[8] Matusz missed the first two months of the 2011 season with an injury.[9] He returned and got six starts and finished with a 1–4 record with an ERA above 7.00 before being demoted to Triple-A Norfolk on June 30 to work on his velocity.[10] He was later recalled and continued to struggle, posting a 1–7 record and 9.84 ERA before his removal from the starting rotation in September.[11][12] Matusz began the 2012 season in the rotation, but was demoted to the bullpen in August. In the bullpen, he excelled, striking out 19 with a 1.35 ERA in 18 appearances. He also did not allow a single inherited runner to score. He pitched the last three months of the season with a rectus abdominis tear, preventing him from sprinting, but not pitching. He had surgery in October to repair the tear, and was expected to be back for spring training.[13] In 2013, Matusz made the transition to full-time reliever, appearing in 65 games. He was 2–1 with a 3.53 ERA for the Orioles.[14][15] On May 23, 2015, he was ejected from the game against the Miami Marlins in the 12th inning for having a foreign substance on his right forearm. He was the second pitcher to be ejected for a foreign substance in that past week. He was suspended for eight games.[16][15] He posted a 2.94 ERA and 10.29 strikeouts per nine innings 58 relief appearances in 2015. On February 4, 2016, Matusz and the Orioles agreed to a one-year deal to avoid arbitration.[17] On May 23, the Orioles traded Matusz and the 76th pick in the 2016 Major League Baseball draft to the Atlanta Braves in return for minor league pitchers Brandon Barker and Trevor Belicek. The Braves designated Matusz for assignment shortly after completing the trade.[18] On June 15, 2016, the Chicago Cubs signed Matusz to a minor league contract. After being employed solely as a reliever since 2012, the Cubs assigned him to be a starter in the minors. On July 30, 2016, the Cubs called him up to start against the Seattle Mariners on July 31.[19] However, after a poor outing in the game, the Cubs designated him for assignment the very next day.[20] He cleared waivers later and was outrighted to the Triple-A Iowa Cubs.[21] Despite only appearing in one game for the Cubs during their 2016 World Series season, he was given a World Series ring.[22] Matusz elected free agency following the season on November 7.[23] On February 13, 2017, Matusz signed a minor league contract with the Arizona Diamondbacks.[24] In 11 games for the Triple–A Reno Aces, he struggled to a 6.11 ERA with 13 strikeouts across 17+2⁄3 innings pitched. On May 16, he was released by the Diamondbacks.[25] On July 23, 2019, Matusz signed with the Acereros de Monclova of the Mexican League.[26] He made one start, going three innings while allowing five hits and five earned runs (15.00 ERA) with three walks and two strikeouts.[27] On August 2, 2019, he signed with the Long Island Ducks of the Atlantic League of Professional Baseball.[28][29] In 46+2⁄3 innings across nine starts, he went 2–3 with a 4.05 ERA and 45 strikeouts.[30] Matusz's brother, Chris, played college baseball at Iowa Wesleyan University.[31] Matusz died in Phoenix on January 6, 2025, at the age of 37 due to a drug overdose.[32][33]",

Took the time to call, encourage me and wish me well in my career and it always meant a lot that he did that. RIP, my friend 🙏🏼 Jake Rill Brian Matusz, a left-handed pitcher who spent nearly all of his eight-year MLB career with the Orioles, died on Tuesday. He was 37. The No. 4 overall pick in the 2008 MLB Draft, Matusz pitched in 279 games (68 starts) for Baltimore from 2009-16. He made only one big league appearance for a team other than the O’s -- a three-inning start for the Cubs on July 31, 2016, in their most recent championship season. “A staple in our clubhouse from 2009-16, Brian was beloved throughout Birdland, and his passion for baseball and our community was unmatched,” the Orioles said in a statement. “He dedicated his time to connecting with any fan he could, was a cherished teammate and always had a smile on his face.” Our hearts are heavy tonight as we mourn the passing of former Oriole, Brian Matusz.A staple in our clubhouse from 2009-2016, Brian was beloved throughout Birdland, and his passion for baseball and our community was unmatched. He dedicated his time to connecting with any fan he… pic.twitter.com/wNN3WkO8l4 Brian Robert Matusz was born on Feb. 11, 1987, in Grand Junction, Colo., and grew up as part of an athletic family. His father, Michael, participated in track and field at Purdue University. His brother, Chris, played baseball at Iowa Wesleyan University. Brian’s baseball career took off during his time at St. Mary’s High School in Phoenix. As a junior in 2004, he went 8-2 with a 0.95 ERA and was named first-team All-State for Arizona. During his ’05 senior campaign, Matusz went 8-1 with a 0.50 ERA and was selected as the Arizona Player of the Year. After being drafted by the Angels in the fourth round of the 2005 MLB Draft, Matusz opted to instead head to the University of San Diego. He went on to have a standout three-year career for the Toreros, capped by winning West Coast Conference Pitcher of the Year in ’08. Matusz, a two-time finalist for the Golden Spikes Award, led the NCAA with 141 strikeouts during his 2008 junior season at San Diego. He recorded 12 wins to go with a 1.71 ERA, the fourth-best single-season mark in the school’s history at the time. Matusz finished his collegiate career as the school’s all-time leader in strikeouts (396). When Matusz joined the Orioles, the organization was loading up on young pitchers. Baltimore took right-hander Matt Hobgood in the first round in 2009, while starters such as Jake Arrieta, Brad Bergesen, Zack Britton and Chris Tillman were expected to develop into key members of the club’s rotation for years to come. Just heard the news about Brian Matusz passing away this morning. This is awful…he was one of the first people to call me after I signed in 09’. Took the time to call, encourage me and wish me well in my career and it always meant a lot that he did that. RIP, my friend 🙏🏼 Matusz reached the big leagues in 2009, posting a 4.63 ERA over eight starts. He built on those results in ’10, recording a 4.30 ERA over 32 starts and finishing fifth in American League Rookie of the Year Award voting. However, that ended up being the southpaw’s best MLB season as a starter. He then pitched to a 10.69 ERA in 12 starts in ’11 and a 5.42 ERA in 16 starts in ’12. But Matusz reinvented himself as a reliever and stuck in the Majors because of it. He had a 1.35 ERA in 18 relief outings in 2012, helping the Orioles end a 15-year postseason drought. He pitched a scoreless one-third of an inning in the AL Wild Card Game win over the Rangers, then posted a 2.08 ERA while pitching in all five games of the AL Division Series vs. the Yankees.

Matusz continued to serve as a reliable left-handed arm out of the bullpen from 2013-15, when he recorded a 3.32 ERA over 186 appearances. He pitched two-thirds of an inning in the AL Championship Series vs. the Royals in ’14. Many fans will remember Matusz for his success against Hall of Fame slugger David Ortiz. During Matusz’s peak as a reliever, the Orioles frequently saved the lefty in matchups vs. the Red Sox for a key spot against “Big Papi.” Matusz often had the left-handed-hitting Ortiz’s number: The slugger went 4-for-29 (.138) with 13 strikeouts in his career against the southpaw. Matusz’s time in Baltimore ended in 2016, when he had a 12.00 ERA in seven games before being traded to the Braves on May 23 that year. Atlanta released him a week later, and he signed on with the Cubs, pitching in the Minors except for one final big league start on the last day of July. He later pitched for Triple-A Reno in the D-backs’ organization in ’17, then made one start in the Mexican League and nine more with the independent Long Island Ducks in ’19 before calling it a career. Well-liked by fans and the Baltimore community, Matusz etched his place into Orioles history with his relief performances on the field and his generous actions off of it during a memorable time for the franchise.",

By Jess Mayhugh | April 2010 [1/9/25: Editor’s Note: Sadly, former Orioles pitcher Brian Matusz—who is profiled in this April 2010 piece—passed away earlier this week. He was 37 and his cause of death is still under investigation. “A staple in our clubhouse from 2009-2016, Brian was beloved throughout Birdland, and his passion for baseball and our community was unmatched,” reads a statement released by the Orioles on Jan. 7. “He dedicated his time to connecting with any fan he could, was a cherished teammate, and always had a smile on his face.” Read on for our interview with Matusz and four other emerging players after their rookie season, in which he discussed getting called up to the majors, his first time on the mound at Camden Yards, and what he loved about living in Baltimore.] It’s amazing how quickly this city changes from purple to orange. Nowhere is this more evident than FanFest, held just one week after the Ravens were ousted from playoff contention. On an unseasonably warm afternoon in January, more than 12,000 O’s fanatics filled the downtown Convention Center to get photographed with The Bird, wait in staggeringly long lines for autographs, and even get a chance to chat with one of their favorite players. Around 4 p.m., there was an unmistakable buzz surrounding the main stage. A safe assumption would be that it’s one of the veterans up there—maybe Nick Markakis or Brian Roberts—waxing poetic about his years on the team. But once you get past some of the standing-room-only crowd, it’s quite the opposite: five baby-faced newcomers. “This is the largest crowd we’ve had here all day,” says emcee Jim Hunter. The crowd laughs, but there’s something serious going on here. These five players—Brad Bergesen, Matt Wieters, Nolan Reimold, Brian Matusz, and Chris Tillman—showed so much promise during their rookie 2009 season that Orioles fans are banking on them. To Orange-and-Black Nation, these five represent no less than the very future of the team. “There is no question of the talent these young guys have,” says Orioles pitching coach Rick Kranitz. “If you’re looking at championships down the line—and that’s why you play the game—that’s what these guys can bring.” For a team that has had (gulp) 12 consecutive losing seasons, even hearing the word championship can inspire much-needed hope. Each player came up through the Orioles minor leagues and ended up with impressive numbers last year: Bergesen notched 65 strikeouts in 19 games, Wieters drove in 43 runs, Reimold hit 15 home runs, Matusz won five out of seven starts, and Tillman (the youngest, at just 21 years old last season) struck out 39. But baseball stats aside, there is something intangible that all five of these players bring to the Orioles clubhouse—an enthusiasm and energy only seen in rookies, the kind of energy that could propel a team to victory. “You need that breath of fresh air, to see their eyes wide open when they walk onto the field,” says second baseman, and nine-year veteran, Brian Roberts. “It keeps it in perspective and makes you realize that our future is very, very bright.” “A staple in our clubhouse from 2009-2016, Brian was beloved throughout Birdland, and his passion for baseball and our community was unmatched,” reads a statement released by the Orioles on Jan. 7. “He dedicated his time to connecting with any fan he could, was a cherished teammate, and always had a smile on his face.” Read on for our interview with Matusz and four other emerging players after their rookie season, in which he discussed getting called up to the majors, his first time on the mound at Camden Yards, and what he loved about living in Baltimore.] It’s amazing how quickly this city changes from purple to orange.

Bergesen, now 24, remembers spending many summer days in his hometown of Fairfield, CA, trading baseball cards with friends. Twenty-six-year-old outfielder Reimold started out playing shortstop in Little League in Greenville, PA. Catcher Wieters, 23, spent every night he can remember sitting in front of the TV with his dad in Goose Creek, SC, watching their beloved Atlanta Braves. And Matusz, 23, says he feels lucky that his childhood passion turned into a pitching scholarship at University of San Diego. Only Tillman, now 22, says he wasn’t that into baseball as a kid growing up in Anaheim, CA. “I know it sounds weird, but I grew up by the beach and just wanted to surf,” he says. “I didn’t even get into pitching until my first couple years of high school.” But, one way or another, they all made it to the big leagues. All baseball players remember what it’s like getting called up to the majors, whether the news is delivered on the bus to a game or actually on the field. Matusz admits he had to hold back some tears when he got the call. “I had just pitched a shutout inning in Double-A in New Britain,” he says. “The manager pulled me to the side and said, ‘That’s it.’ I said, ‘What do you mean?’ and he said, ‘You’re pitching in Detroit in three days.’ I remember I couldn’t stop shaking and I called my dad right away.” A debut for any baseball player is a big deal. But, in Baltimore, there might be some added pressure because of how devoted the fans are to the players, even before they enter the majors. “For as long as I can remember, the fans here have always had a huge interest in their farm system,” says Orioles president Andy MacPhail. “Partly because of the geographic proximity of these minor league teams, but partly because they’re just so invested in the future.” This was certainly the case when the highly touted Wieters made his debut on May 29 to a sold-out stadium of fans and masses of media outlets in the clubhouse. There was a palpable excitement in the air. Heck, there was even a rainbow over Camden Yards. “I was just thinking, ‘Don’t do something to embarrass yourself,’” Wieters recalls. “When you come up with that sort of hype, you want to hit a home run every time. But this game’s too tough for anyone to C5 do that, so you just have to go out there and play like you know you can.” This philosophy worked for the catcher, as he finished his season strong, batting .362 and earning 14 RBIs in the month of September. Also playing in Wieters’s debut game was Bergesen, though he didn’t come up with that same level of expectation. Affectionately known as “Bergie” in the clubhouse, he made his debut earlier in the year and proved to be arguably the Orioles’s most dependable starting pitcher. “I never looked at myself as an ace, that was always [Jeremy] Guthrie,” Bergesen says. “I just always wanted to work hard and go deep in games.” He continued to do just that until a line drive hit him straight in the leg on July 30. Bergesen thought his shin was broken at first, ran off the field into the clubhouse, and collapsed when his leg gave out from under him. Though an MRI revealed no bone fracture, the injury ended his season. While fans were heartbroken to see Bergesen go, it made way for Matusz, or “B-Matt,” to get on the mound. For his debut, 27 of Matusz’s closest friends and family filled the seats in Camden Yards. And they were not disappointed. He earned a win in that game and went on to win five more starts and strike out 38 batters. But, despite that success (or more accurately, because of it), the Orioles shut him down on Sept. 14 to preserve his arm for 2010. “I felt healthy, so I didn’t want to stop throwing,” he says. “But I knew it was coming. They always told me right around 160 innings they would shut me down. At least I won my last three games and ended on a positive note.” Matusz’s best friend on the team is fellow West Coast resident Tillman. They always sit next to each other in the dugout, and, when one player is out signing autographs, fans always ask where the other one is. Tillman, whose teammates call him “Tilly,” was called up on July 29 last year and had a pretty streaky season. In one five-start span in August, he posted a more than respectable 3.34 ERA, but he only ended up winning two of his five starts. “Last season was a lot about me getting the jitters out,” Tillman says. “I have to be more consistent and throw more strikes, and that comes with maturity.” The player that blew everyone’s expectations out of the water was outfielder Reimold. He quietly debuted on May 14 and ended up having a stellar season: He led American League rookies in home runs, on-base percentage, slugging percentage, and walks. “I always expect big things from myself,” Reimold says. “I would have been surprised if I didn’t do that well.” Unfortunately (and pretty impressively considering his accomplishments), Reimold was dealing with the pain of a frayed Achilles tendon for most of the season and was shut down in September to recover. Before his season got cut short, Reimold was a major contender for AL Rookie of the Year. FOR YEARS NOW, THE ORIOLES ORGANIZATION has been encouraging fans to be patient: Yes, the team has floundered. Yes, it’s been a painful winning drought. But look to the farm system! That’s our future. Last year, the future arrived en masse—the Orioles had a total of nine rookies on the roster. “These guys were the final result of a blueprint planned out years ago,” says hitting coach Terry Crowley. “But to have that many come so soon was even more than we were expecting.” The group already felt comfortable, as all five played together at some point, whether in Norfolk, Bowie, or the Arizona Fall League, which Orioles manager Dave Trembley says helped them from day one. “They all automatically fit in very well in the clubhouse,” Trembley says. “They genuinely like each other, and you can tell because they’re always together.” It’s not often that a team gets an influx of top-tier rookies all in the same season. From a player’s perspective, that camaraderie made adjusting to the majors a lot easier. “It was great when I came up because the rookies were able to give me advice about what they just went through,” Wieters says. “Plus, the veterans don’t pick on you as much when you start to outnumber them.” Of course, the young players admit, there was some ritual hazing, some expected (like an Adam Jones pie to the face after an accomplishment) and some pretty unexpected (like being forced to answer very personal questions over a microphone in the front of the entire team bus). “With rookies around, the clubhouse gets a little bit sillier,” Crowley admits. The large group of young guys also serves to remind the older players what a privilege it is to play this game at the highest level. And all five first-year players admit they had plenty of goose-bump moments in 2009. “You can’t get much better than hitting your first major-league home run off of a Hall-of-Famer in Yankee Stadium,” says Reimold of his May 20 rocket off Mariano Rivera. The other players, not surprisingly, count their experiences playing against the Yankees as some of their most awestruck. Bergesen remembers it really got to him when he walked out to the bus with Derek Jeter and Alex Rodriguez one day. “I didn’t think it was going to hit me that hard,” he says. “But to realize you’re on the same playing field as these guys is crazy.” Likewise, growing up in Colorado, Matusz’s favorite player was the Diamondbacks’s Mark Grace. Grace, now retired and doing color commentary, called a game last season when Matusz pitched against the Rangers. “I brought my Mark Grace jersey up to the radio booth before the game,” Matusz says. “We talked for half-an-hour and it was pretty special. I ended up winning that game, too.” Through it all, the five young players were able to form a strong bond. During the season, they all lived in Canton, and some hung out at the ESPN Zone or ate crabs during downtime. Bergesen, who’s been married for about a year, and Reimold, the mellowest of the five, say they preferred to hang at home. But they all adopted a strong appreciation for Baltimore. “I love it here. There’s a different lifestyle living in a city,” Matusz says. “Each neighborhood has its own character and you can see how much people really love their city.” Two of them were already familiar with area: Bergesen’s wife grew up in Catonsville, and Wieters’s sister lives downtown. But some guys admit that they were a bit nervous coming to a town that wasn’t exactly known for racking up baseball pennants. “You know, just looking at the Orioles record, I wasn’t sure how the fans were going to be,” Tillman says. “But Baltimore has some of the most supportive and loyal fans in the league.” Only Tillman, now 22, says he wasn’t that into baseball as a kid growing up in Anaheim, CA. “I know it sounds weird, but I grew up by the beach and just wanted to surf,” he says. “I didn’t even get into pitching until my first couple years of high school.” But, one way or another, they all made it to the big leagues. All baseball players remember what it’s like getting called up to the majors, whether the news is delivered on the bus to a game or actually on the field.

For his debut, 27 of Matusz’s closest friends and family filled the seats in Camden Yards. And they were not disappointed. He earned a win in that game and went on to win five more starts and strike out 38 batters. But, despite that success (or more accurately, because of it), the Orioles shut him down on Sept. 14 to preserve his arm for 2010. “I felt healthy, so I didn’t want to stop throwing,” he says. “But I knew it was coming. They always told me right around 160 innings they would shut me down. At least I won my last three games and ended on a positive note.” Matusz’s best friend on the team is fellow West Coast resident Tillman. They always sit next to each other in the dugout, and, when one player is out signing autographs, fans always ask where the other one is. Tillman, whose teammates call him “Tilly,” was called up on July 29 last year and had a pretty streaky season. In one five-start span in August, he posted a more than respectable 3.34 ERA, but he only ended up winning two of his five starts. “Last season was a lot about me getting the jitters out,” Tillman says. “I have to be more consistent and throw more strikes, and that comes with maturity.” The player that blew everyone’s expectations out of the water was outfielder Reimold. He quietly debuted on May 14 and ended up having a stellar season: He led American League rookies in home runs, on-base percentage, slugging percentage, and walks. “I always expect big things from myself,” Reimold says. “I would have been surprised if I didn’t do that well.” Unfortunately (and pretty impressively considering his accomplishments), Reimold was dealing with the pain of a frayed Achilles tendon for most of the season and was shut down in September to recover. Before his season got cut short, Reimold was a major contender for AL Rookie of the Year. FOR YEARS NOW, THE ORIOLES ORGANIZATION has been encouraging fans to be patient: Yes, the team has floundered. Yes, it’s been a painful winning drought. But look to the farm system! That’s our future. Last year, the future arrived en masse—the Orioles had a total of nine rookies on the roster. “These guys were the final result of a blueprint planned out years ago,” says hitting coach Terry Crowley. “But to have that many come so soon was even more than we were expecting.” The group already felt comfortable, as all five played together at some point, whether in Norfolk, Bowie, or the Arizona Fall League, which Orioles manager Dave Trembley says helped them from day one. “They all automatically fit in very well in the clubhouse,” Trembley says. “They genuinely like each other, and you can tell because they’re always together.” It’s not often that a team gets an influx of top-tier rookies all in the same season. From a player’s perspective, that camaraderie made adjusting to the majors a lot easier. “It was great when I came up because the rookies were able to give me advice about what they just went through,” Wieters says. “Plus, the veterans don’t pick on you as much when you start to outnumber them.” Of course, the young players admit, there was some ritual hazing, some expected (like an Adam Jones pie to the face after an accomplishment) and some pretty unexpected (like being forced to answer very personal questions over a microphone in the front of the entire team bus). “With rookies around, the clubhouse gets a little bit sillier,” Crowley admits. The large group of young guys also serves to remind the older players what a privilege it is to play this game at the highest level. And all five first-year players admit they had plenty of goose-bump moments in 2009. “You can’t get much better than hitting your first major-league home run off of a Hall-of-Famer in Yankee Stadium,” says Reimold of his May 20 rocket off Mariano Rivera. The other players, not surprisingly, count their experiences playing against the Yankees as some of their most awestruck. Bergesen remembers it really got to him when he walked out to the bus with Derek Jeter and Alex Rodriguez one day. “I didn’t think it was going to hit me that hard,” he says. “But to realize you’re on the same playing field as these guys is crazy.” Likewise, growing up in Colorado, Matusz’s favorite player was the Diamondbacks’s Mark Grace. Grace, now retired and doing color commentary, called a game last season when Matusz pitched against the Rangers. “I brought my Mark Grace jersey up to the radio booth before the game,” Matusz says. “We talked for half-an-hour and it was pretty special. I ended up winning that game, too.” Through it all, the five young players were able to form a strong bond. During the season, they all lived in Canton, and some hung out at the ESPN Zone or ate crabs during downtime. Bergesen, who’s been married for about a year, and Reimold, the mellowest of the five, say they preferred to hang at home. But they all adopted a strong appreciation for Baltimore. “I love it here. There’s a different lifestyle living in a city,” Matusz says. “Each neighborhood has its own character and you can see how much people really love their city.” Two of them were already familiar with area: Bergesen’s wife grew up in Catonsville, and Wieters’s sister lives downtown. But some guys admit that they were a bit nervous coming to a town that wasn’t exactly known for racking up baseball pennants. “You know, just looking at the Orioles record, I wasn’t sure how the fans were going to be,” Tillman says. “But Baltimore has some of the most supportive and loyal fans in the league.” “For as long as I can remember, the fans here have always had a huge interest in their farm system,” says Orioles president Andy MacPhail. “Partly because of the geographic proximity of these minor league teams, but partly because they’re just so invested in the future.” This was certainly the case when the highly touted Wieters made his debut on May 29 to a sold-out stadium of fans and masses of media outlets in the clubhouse. There was a palpable excitement in the air. Heck, there was even a rainbow over Camden Yards. “I was just thinking, ‘Don’t do something to embarrass yourself,’” Wieters recalls. “When you come up with that sort of hype, you want to hit a home run every time. But this game’s too tough for anyone to C5 do that, so you just have to go out there and play like you know you can.” This philosophy worked for the catcher, as he finished his season strong, batting .362 and earning 14 RBIs in the month of September. Also playing in Wieters’s debut game was Bergesen, though he didn’t come up with that same level of expectation. Affectionately known as “Bergie” in the clubhouse, he made his debut earlier in the year and proved to be arguably the Orioles’s most dependable starting pitcher. “I never looked at myself as an ace, that was always [Jeremy] Guthrie,” Bergesen says. “I just always wanted to work hard and go deep in games.” He continued to do just that until a line drive hit him straight in the leg on July 30. Bergesen thought his shin was broken at first, ran off the field into the clubhouse, and collapsed when his leg gave out from under him. Though an MRI revealed no bone fracture, the injury ended his season. While fans were heartbroken to see Bergesen go, it made way for Matusz, or “B-Matt,” to get on the mound.

He earned a win in that game and went on to win five more starts and strike out 38 batters. But, despite that success (or more accurately, because of it), the Orioles shut him down on Sept. 14 to preserve his arm for 2010. “I felt healthy, so I didn’t want to stop throwing,” he says. “But I knew it was coming. They always told me right around 160 innings they would shut me down. At least I won my last three games and ended on a positive note.” Matusz’s best friend on the team is fellow West Coast resident Tillman. They always sit next to each other in the dugout, and, when one player is out signing autographs, fans always ask where the other one is. Tillman, whose teammates call him “Tilly,” was called up on July 29 last year and had a pretty streaky season. In one five-start span in August, he posted a more than respectable 3.34 ERA, but he only ended up winning two of his five starts. “Last season was a lot about me getting the jitters out,” Tillman says. “I have to be more consistent and throw more strikes, and that comes with maturity.” The player that blew everyone’s expectations out of the water was outfielder Reimold. He quietly debuted on May 14 and ended up having a stellar season: He led American League rookies in home runs, on-base percentage, slugging percentage, and walks. “I always expect big things from myself,” Reimold says. “I would have been surprised if I didn’t do that well.” Unfortunately (and pretty impressively considering his accomplishments), Reimold was dealing with the pain of a frayed Achilles tendon for most of the season and was shut down in September to recover. Before his season got cut short, Reimold was a major contender for AL Rookie of the Year. FOR YEARS NOW, THE ORIOLES ORGANIZATION has been encouraging fans to be patient: Yes, the team has floundered. Yes, it’s been a painful winning drought. But look to the farm system! That’s our future. Last year, the future arrived en masse—the Orioles had a total of nine rookies on the roster. “These guys were the final result of a blueprint planned out years ago,” says hitting coach Terry Crowley. “But to have that many come so soon was even more than we were expecting.” The group already felt comfortable, as all five played together at some point, whether in Norfolk, Bowie, or the Arizona Fall League, which Orioles manager Dave Trembley says helped them from day one. “They all automatically fit in very well in the clubhouse,” Trembley says. “They genuinely like each other, and you can tell because they’re always together.” It’s not often that a team gets an influx of top-tier rookies all in the same season. From a player’s perspective, that camaraderie made adjusting to the majors a lot easier. “It was great when I came up because the rookies were able to give me advice about what they just went through,” Wieters says. “Plus, the veterans don’t pick on you as much when you start to outnumber them.” Of course, the young players admit, there was some ritual hazing, some expected (like an Adam Jones pie to the face after an accomplishment) and some pretty unexpected (like being forced to answer very personal questions over a microphone in the front of the entire team bus). “With rookies around, the clubhouse gets a little bit sillier,” Crowley admits. The large group of young guys also serves to remind the older players what a privilege it is to play this game at the highest level. And all five first-year players admit they had plenty of goose-bump moments in 2009. “You can’t get much better than hitting your first major-league home run off of a Hall-of-Famer in Yankee Stadium,” says Reimold of his May 20 rocket off Mariano Rivera. The other players, not surprisingly, count their experiences playing against the Yankees as some of their most awestruck. Bergesen remembers it really got to him when he walked out to the bus with Derek Jeter and Alex Rodriguez one day. “I didn’t think it was going to hit me that hard,” he says. “But to realize you’re on the same playing field as these guys is crazy.” Likewise, growing up in Colorado, Matusz’s favorite player was the Diamondbacks’s Mark Grace. Grace, now retired and doing color commentary, called a game last season when Matusz pitched against the Rangers. “I brought my Mark Grace jersey up to the radio booth before the game,” Matusz says. “We talked for half-an-hour and it was pretty special. I ended up winning that game, too.” Through it all, the five young players were able to form a strong bond. During the season, they all lived in Canton, and some hung out at the ESPN Zone or ate crabs during downtime. Bergesen, who’s been married for about a year, and Reimold, the mellowest of the five, say they preferred to hang at home. But they all adopted a strong appreciation for Baltimore. “I love it here. There’s a different lifestyle living in a city,” Matusz says. “Each neighborhood has its own character and you can see how much people really love their city.” Two of them were already familiar with area: Bergesen’s wife grew up in Catonsville, and Wieters’s sister lives downtown. But some guys admit that they were a bit nervous coming to a town that wasn’t exactly known for racking up baseball pennants. “You know, just looking at the Orioles record, I wasn’t sure how the fans were going to be,” Tillman says. “But Baltimore has some of the most supportive and loyal fans in the league.” He continued to do just that until a line drive hit him straight in the leg on July 30. Bergesen thought his shin was broken at first, ran off the field into the clubhouse, and collapsed when his leg gave out from under him. Though an MRI revealed no bone fracture, the injury ended his season. While fans were heartbroken to see Bergesen go, it made way for Matusz, or “B-Matt,” to get on the mound.

And all five first-year players admit they had plenty of goose-bump moments in 2009. “You can’t get much better than hitting your first major-league home run off of a Hall-of-Famer in Yankee Stadium,” says Reimold of his May 20 rocket off Mariano Rivera. The other players, not surprisingly, count their experiences playing against the Yankees as some of their most awestruck. Bergesen remembers it really got to him when he walked out to the bus with Derek Jeter and Alex Rodriguez one day. “I didn’t think it was going to hit me that hard,” he says. “But to realize you’re on the same playing field as these guys is crazy.” Likewise, growing up in Colorado, Matusz’s favorite player was the Diamondbacks’s Mark Grace. Grace, now retired and doing color commentary, called a game last season when Matusz pitched against the Rangers. “I brought my Mark Grace jersey up to the radio booth before the game,” Matusz says. “We talked for half-an-hour and it was pretty special. I ended up winning that game, too.” Through it all, the five young players were able to form a strong bond. During the season, they all lived in Canton, and some hung out at the ESPN Zone or ate crabs during downtime. Bergesen, who’s been married for about a year, and Reimold, the mellowest of the five, say they preferred to hang at home. But they all adopted a strong appreciation for Baltimore. “I love it here. There’s a different lifestyle living in a city,” Matusz says. “Each neighborhood has its own character and you can see how much people really love their city.” Two of them were already familiar with area: Bergesen’s wife grew up in Catonsville, and Wieters’s sister lives downtown. But some guys admit that they were a bit nervous coming to a town that wasn’t exactly known for racking up baseball pennants. “You know, just looking at the Orioles record, I wasn’t sure how the fans were going to be,” Tillman says. “But Baltimore has some of the most supportive and loyal fans in the league.” The player that blew everyone’s expectations out of the water was outfielder Reimold. He quietly debuted on May 14 and ended up having a stellar season: He led American League rookies in home runs, on-base percentage, slugging percentage, and walks. “I always expect big things from myself,” Reimold says. “I would have been surprised if I didn’t do that well.” Unfortunately (and pretty impressively considering his accomplishments), Reimold was dealing with the pain of a frayed Achilles tendon for most of the season and was shut down in September to recover. Before his season got cut short, Reimold was a major contender for AL Rookie of the Year. FOR YEARS NOW, THE ORIOLES ORGANIZATION has been encouraging fans to be patient: Yes, the team has floundered. Yes, it’s been a painful winning drought. But look to the farm system! That’s our future. Last year, the future arrived en masse—the Orioles had a total of nine rookies on the roster. “These guys were the final result of a blueprint planned out years ago,” says hitting coach Terry Crowley. “But to have that many come so soon was even more than we were expecting.” The group already felt comfortable, as all five played together at some point, whether in Norfolk, Bowie, or the Arizona Fall League, which Orioles manager Dave Trembley says helped them from day one. “They all automatically fit in very well in the clubhouse,” Trembley says. “They genuinely like each other, and you can tell because they’re always together.” It’s not often that a team gets an influx of top-tier rookies all in the same season. From a player’s perspective, that camaraderie made adjusting to the majors a lot easier. “It was great when I came up because the rookies were able to give me advice about what they just went through,” Wieters says. “Plus, the veterans don’t pick on you as much when you start to outnumber them.” Of course, the young players admit, there was some ritual hazing, some expected (like an Adam Jones pie to the face after an accomplishment) and some pretty unexpected (like being forced to answer very personal questions over a microphone in the front of the entire team bus). “With rookies around, the clubhouse gets a little bit sillier,” Crowley admits.

But some guys admit that they were a bit nervous coming to a town that wasn’t exactly known for racking up baseball pennants. “You know, just looking at the Orioles record, I wasn’t sure how the fans were going to be,” Tillman says. “But Baltimore has some of the most supportive and loyal fans in the league.” “It was great when I came up because the rookies were able to give me advice about what they just went through,” Wieters says. “Plus, the veterans don’t pick on you as much when you start to outnumber them.” Of course, the young players admit, there was some ritual hazing, some expected (like an Adam Jones pie to the face after an accomplishment) and some pretty unexpected (like being forced to answer very personal questions over a microphone in the front of the entire team bus). “With rookies around, the clubhouse gets a little bit sillier,” Crowley admits. The large group of young guys also serves to remind the older players what a privilege it is to play this game at the highest level. And all five first-year players admit they had plenty of goose-bump moments in 2009. “You can’t get much better than hitting your first major-league home run off of a Hall-of-Famer in Yankee Stadium,” says Reimold of his May 20 rocket off Mariano Rivera. The other players, not surprisingly, count their experiences playing against the Yankees as some of their most awestruck. Bergesen remembers it really got to him when he walked out to the bus with Derek Jeter and Alex Rodriguez one day. “I didn’t think it was going to hit me that hard,” he says. “But to realize you’re on the same playing field as these guys is crazy.” Likewise, growing up in Colorado, Matusz’s favorite player was the Diamondbacks’s Mark Grace. Grace, now retired and doing color commentary, called a game last season when Matusz pitched against the Rangers. “I brought my Mark Grace jersey up to the radio booth before the game,” Matusz says. “We talked for half-an-hour and it was pretty special. I ended up winning that game, too.” Through it all, the five young players were able to form a strong bond. During the season, they all lived in Canton, and some hung out at the ESPN Zone or ate crabs during downtime.

The rookie season was surreal and amazing and it flew by all too quickly. But now these guys won’t be sneaking up on anybody. And there’s a reason why the phrase “sophomore slump” exists. “These kids are going to have to learn when the league starts adjusting to them,” MacPhail says. “Our job in the off-season was to get veteran players around them to prepare them even further.” The Orioles president was probably referring to acquisitions like 13-year veterans Miguel Tejada and Kevin Millwood. Tejada, a former O’s shortstop, will move to third base and boost the core of veteran players. Young pitchers are already excited to learn from longtime hurler Millwood, who comes to Baltimore from the Texas Rangers. Also important for the rooks is recovering from nagging 2009 injuries. Bergesen says that his shin feels back to normal. (Ironically, the pitcher strained his shoulder while shooting a TV commercial in December and had to sit out some of spring training.) Following the end of last season, Reimold had surgery on his Achilles tendon and was doing rehab well into the winter. “I’m feeling good now,” Reimold says with the understated confidence that characterizes most of his answers. The outfielder is almost abnormally relaxed and composed in an interview, much like his attitude at the plate. Nothing seems to faze him. “Nolan has a blue collar approach to the game,” Trembley says. “He has a keen eye and can hit home runs to all fields. He’s improving his outfield play, and left field should be his position in the coming years.” Then there’s Wieters, the guy with the most fanfare. He’s tall at 6’5” and carries himself like he’s been in the majors for years—probably because of all the extra media attention. Crowley calls the pressure on the catcher “unfair,” but says he’s handled himself well despite it. “Wieters will be the Orioles catcher, and a good one, for the next decade or longer,” Trembley says. “He’s got a big upside, hits for average and power, and doesn’t get rattled.” As for the future of our pitching staff, a tumultuous subject throughout Orioles history? Well, there’s hope there, too. Once a few kinks are worked out, Kranitz believes the team will have a successful starting rotation. “Bergesen relies on the ability to get a ground ball, which is huge. Ground balls can’t go over the fence,” he says. “Matusz is a total four-pitch package—and all of them have quality. Tillman is the baby of the group, but I can envision him in the next couple of years being an absolute jaw-dropper.” If all of this sounds like it falls under the category of typical April optimism, that’s because it does. Every spring, as flowers bloom and temperatures climb, Orioles fans all around the city start feeling a sense of expectation, usually crushed by the time the All-Star break rolls around. But something, genuinely, feels a little bit different this season. Maybe that infectious rookie enthusiasm that Roberts was talking about has rubbed off, but 2010 just feels like the year the team can finally make some noise. Or at least get over the .500 hump. “A couple years ago, it was frustrating to think of this as a rebuilding process,” Roberts says. “But I don’t think of it like that anymore. I don’t feel like we’re as much rebuilding as we are preparing to win.” Soon, maybe fans will still be wearing orange in October.” “These kids are going to have to learn when the league starts adjusting to them,” MacPhail says. “Our job in the off-season was to get veteran players around them to prepare them even further.” The Orioles president was probably referring to acquisitions like 13-year veterans Miguel Tejada and Kevin Millwood.

Maybe that infectious rookie enthusiasm that Roberts was talking about has rubbed off, but 2010 just feels like the year the team can finally make some noise.

I don’t feel like we’re as much rebuilding as we are preparing to win.” Soon, maybe fans will still be wearing orange in October.” Then there’s Wieters, the guy with the most fanfare. He’s tall at 6’5” and carries himself like he’s been in the majors for years—probably because of all the extra media attention. Crowley calls the pressure on the catcher “unfair,” but says he’s handled himself well despite it. “Wieters will be the Orioles catcher, and a good one, for the next decade or longer,” Trembley says. “He’s got a big upside, hits for average and power, and doesn’t get rattled.” As for the future of our pitching staff, a tumultuous subject throughout Orioles history? Well, there’s hope there, too. Once a few kinks are worked out, Kranitz believes the team will have a successful starting rotation. “Bergesen relies on the ability to get a ground ball, which is huge. Ground balls can’t go over the fence,” he says. “Matusz is a total four-pitch package—and all of them have quality. Tillman is the baby of the group, but I can envision him in the next couple of years being an absolute jaw-dropper.” If all of this sounds like it falls under the category of typical April optimism, that’s because it does.

                "content": "A bull is an intact (i.e., not castrated) adult male of the species Bos taurus (cattle). More muscular and aggressive than the females of the same species (i.e. cows proper), bulls have long been an important symbol in many religions, including for sacrifices. These animals play a significant role in beef ranching, dairy farming, and a variety of sporting and cultural activities, including bullfighting and bull riding. Due to their temperament, handling of bulls requires precautions.[1] The female counterpart to a bull is a cow, while a male of the species that has been castrated is a steer, ox,[2] or bullock, although in North America, this last term refers to a young bull.[citation needed] Use of these terms varies considerably with area and dialect. Colloquially, people unfamiliar with cattle may also refer to steers and heifers as \"cows\", and bovines of aggressive or long-horned breeds as \"bulls\" regardless of sex. A wild, young, unmarked bull is known as a micky in Australia.[3] Improper or late castration on a bull results in him becoming a coarse steer, also known as a stag in Australia, Canada, and New Zealand.[4] In some countries, an incompletely castrated male is known also as a rig or ridgling. The word \"bull\" also denotes the males of other bovines, including bison and water buffalo, as well as many other species of large animals, including elephants, rhinos, seals and walruses, hippos, camels, giraffes, elk, moose, whales, dolphins, and antelopes. Bulls are much more muscular than cows, with thicker bones, larger feet, a very muscular neck, and a large, bony head with protective ridges over the eyes. These features assist bulls in fighting for domination over a herd, giving the winner superior access to cows for reproduction.[5] The hair is generally shorter on the body, but the neck and head often have a \"mane\" of curlier, wooly hair. Bulls are usually about the same height as cows or a little taller, but because of the additional muscle and bone mass, they often weigh far more. Most of the time, a bull has a hump on his shoulders.[6] In horned cattle, the horns of bulls tend to be thicker and somewhat shorter than those of cows,[7] and in many breeds, they curve outwards in a flat arc rather than upwards in a lyre shape. It is not true, as is commonly believed, that bulls have horns and cows do not: the presence of horns depends on the breed, or in horned breeds on whether the horns have been disbudded. (It is true, however, that in many breeds of sheep only the males have horns.) Cattle that naturally do not have horns are referred to as polled, or muleys.[8] Castrated male cattle are physically similar to females in build and horn shape, although if allowed to reach maturity, they may be considerably taller than either bulls or cows, with heavily muscled shoulders and necks.[9] Bulls become fertile around seven months of age. Their fertility is closely related to the size of their testicles, and one simple test of fertility is to measure the circumference of the scrotum; a young bull is likely to be fertile once this reaches 28 centimetres (11 in); that of a fully adult bull may be over 40 centimetres (16 in).[10][11] Bulls have a fibroelastic penis. Given the small amount of erectile tissue, little enlargement occurs after erection. The penis is quite rigid when not erect, and becomes even more rigid during erection. Protrusion is not affected much by erection, but more by relaxation of the retractor penis muscle and straightening of the sigmoid flexure.[12][13][14] Bulls are occasionally affected by a condition known as \"corkscrew penis\".[15][16] The penis of a mature bull is about 3–4 cm (1+1⁄4–1+1⁄2 inches) in diameter,[17][18][19][20] and 80–100 cm (30–40 inches) in length.[21] The bull's glans penis has a rounded and elongated shape.[21] A common misconception widely repeated in depictions of bull behavior is that the color red angers bulls, inciting them to charge. In fact, like most mammals, cattle are red–green color blind. In bullfighting, the movement of the matador's cape, and not the color, provokes a reaction in the bull.[22][23] Other than the few bulls needed for breeding, the vast majority of male cattle are castrated and slaughtered for meat before the age of three years, except where they are needed (castrated) as work oxen for haulage. Most of these beef animals are castrated as calves to reduce aggressive behavior and prevent unwanted mating,[24] although some are reared as uncastrated bull beef. A bull is typically ready for slaughter one or two months sooner than a castrated male or a female, and produces proportionately more and leaner muscle.[24] Frame score is a useful way of describing the skeletal size of bulls and other cattle. Frame scores can be used as an aid to predict mature cattle sizes and aid in the selection of beef bulls. They are calculated from hip height and age. In sales catalogues, this measurement is frequently reported in addition to weight and other performance data such as estimated breed value.[25] Adult bulls may weigh between 500 and 1,000 kg (1,100 and 2,200 lb). Most are capable of aggressive behavior and require careful handling to ensure the safety of humans and other animals. Those of dairy breeds may be more prone to aggression, while beef breeds are somewhat less aggressive, though beef breeds such as the Spanish Fighting Bull and related animals are also noted for aggressive tendencies, which are further encouraged by selective breeding. An estimated 42% of all livestock-related fatalities in Canada are a result of bull attacks, and fewer than one in 20 victims of a bull attack survives.[26] Dairy breed bulls are particularly dangerous and unpredictable; the hazards of bull handling are a significant cause of injury and death for dairy farmers in some parts of the United States.[27][28][29] The need to move a bull in and out of its pen to cover cows exposes the handler to serious jeopardy of life and limb.[30] Being trampled, jammed against a wall, or gored by a bull was one of the most frequent causes of death in the dairy industry before 1940.[1] With regard to such risks, one popular farming magazine has suggested, \"Handle the bull with a staff and take no chances. The gentle bull, not the vicious one, most often kills or maims his keeper\".[31] In many areas, placing rings in bulls' noses to help control them is traditional. The ring is usually made of copper, and is inserted through a small hole cut in the septum of the nose. It is used by attaching a lead rope either directly to it or running through it from a head collar, or for more difficult bulls, a bull pole (or bull staff) may be used. This is a rigid pole about 1 m (3 ft) long with a clip at one end; this attaches to the ring and allows the bull both to be led and to be held away from his handler. An aggressive bull may be kept confined in a bull pen, a robustly constructed shelter and pen, often with an arrangement to allow the bull to be fed without entering the pen. If an aggressive bull is allowed to graze outside, additional precautions may be needed to help avoid him harming people. One method is a bull mask, which either covers the bull's eyes completely, or restricts his vision to the ground immediately in front of him, so he cannot see his potential victim. Another method is to attach a length of chain to the bull's nose-ring, so that if he ducks his head to charge, he steps on the chain and is brought up short. Alternatively, the bull may be hobbled, or chained by his ring or by a collar to a solid object such as a ring fixed into the ground. In larger pastures, particularly where a bull is kept with other cattle, the animals may simply be fed from a pickup truck or tractor, the vehicle itself providing some protection for the humans involved. Generally, bulls kept with cows tend to be less aggressive than those kept alone. In herd situations, cows with young calves are often more dangerous to humans. In the off season, multiple bulls may be kept together in a \"bachelor herd\". Many cattle ranches and stations run bulls with cows, and most dairy or beef farms traditionally had at least one, if not several, bulls for purposes of herd maintenance.[32][33] However, the problems associated with handling a bull (particularly where cows must be removed from his presence to be worked) has prompted many dairy farmers to restrict themselves to artificial insemination (AI) of the cows.[34] Semen is removed from the bulls and stored in canisters of liquid nitrogen, where it is kept until it can be sold, at which time it can be very profitable; in fact, many ranchers keep bulls specifically for this purpose. AI is also used to improve the quality of a herd, or to introduce an outcross of bloodlines. Some ranchers prefer to use AI to allow them to breed to several different bulls in a season or to breed their best stock to a higher-quality bull than they could afford to purchase outright. AI may also be used in conjunction with embryo transfer to allow cattle producers to add new breeding to their herds. Aside from their reproductive duties, bulls are also used in certain sports, including bullfighting and bull-riding. They are also incorporated into festivals and folk events such as the Running of the Bulls and were seen in ancient sports such as bull-leaping. Though less common than castrated males, bulls are used as draught oxen in some areas.[35][36] The once-popular sport of bull-baiting, in which a bull is attacked by specially bred and trained dogs (which came to be known as bulldogs), was banned in England by the Cruelty to Animals Act 1835. As with other animals, some bulls have been regarded as pets. The singer Charo, for instance, has owned a pet bull named Manolo.[37] Sacred bulls have held a place of significance in human culture since before the beginning of recorded history. They appear in cave paintings estimated to be up to 17,000 years old. The mythic Bull of Heavens plays a role in the ancient Sumerian Epic of Gilgamesh, dating as far back as 2150 BC. The importance of the bull is reflected in its appearance in the zodiac as Taurus, and its numerous appearances in mythology, where it is often associated with fertility. See also Korban. In Hinduism, a bull named Nandi, usually depicted seated, is worshipped as the vehicle of the god Shiva and depicted on many of the images of that deity. Symbolically, the bull appears commonly in heraldry. Bulls appears as charges and crests on the arms of several British families. Winged bulls appear as supporters in the arms of the Worshipful Company of Butchers.[38] In modern times, the bull is used as a mascot by both amateur and professional sports teams. Bulls also have a special significance in Spanish culture, where the Running of the Bulls celebration occurs every year in summer. During this festival, a group of human runners called \"mozos\" try to outrace a group of bulls running behind them, while large crowds watch the entire race.[39] Popular NBA team the Chicago Bulls features a bull in its branding, mascot, and merchandise.",
