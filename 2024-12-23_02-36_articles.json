                "content": "Washington (AFP) – Two US Navy pilots were shot down over the Red Sea early Sunday in \"an apparent case of friendly fire,\" the US military said. Issued on: 22/12/2024 - 17:17 Yemen's Iran-backed Huthi rebels said later on Sunday they had \"targeted\" the aircraft carrier USS Harry S Truman a day earlier in an operation that led to \"shooting down an F-18 aircraft\" and thwarting \"American-British aggression\" against Yemen. United States Central Command said late on Saturday that both US pilots were recovered alive but \"initial assessments indicate that one of the crew members sustained minor injuries\". This incident, \"was not the result of hostile fire, and a full investigation is underway,\" CENTCOM said. The potentially disastrous mistake underscores the dangers of a mission the United States has been involved in for more than a year to counter Yemen's Huthi rebels. The Huthis have repeatedly targeted merchant vessels in the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden, waterways vital to global trade. CENTCOM said the guided missile cruiser USS Gettysburg \"mistakenly fired on and hit the F/A-18\" fighter aircraft, which Navy pilots had flown off the USS Harry S Truman. On Saturday the United States said it struck targets including a missile storage facility in Yemen's rebel-held capital Sanaa, hours after a Huthi rebel missile wounded people in Israel's commercial hub Tel Aviv. US forces also shot down multiple Huthi attack drones and an anti-ship cruise missile over the Red Sea, CENTCOM said. \"The operation involved US Air Force and US Navy assets, including F/A-18s,\" CENTCOM said. The Huthis say they are acting in solidarity with Palestinians in Gaza, where Israel and Hamas have been at war since October 7, 2023. © 2024 AFP © 2024 Copyright France 24 - All rights reserved.

                "content": "DUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP) — Two U.S. Navy pilots were shot down Sunday over the Red Sea in an apparent “friendly fire” incident, the U.S military said, marking the most serious incident to threaten troops in over a year of America targeting Yemen’s Houthi rebels. Both pilots were recovered alive after ejecting from their stricken aircraft, with one suffering minor injuries. But the shootdown underlines just how dangerous the Red Sea corridor has become, with ongoing attacks on shipping by the Iranian-backed Houthis despite U.S. and European military coalitions patrolling the area. The U.S. military had conducted airstrikes targeting Yemen’s Houthi rebels at the time of the friendly fire incident, though the U.S. military’s Central Command did not elaborate on what the pilots’ mission was and did not respond to questions from The Associated Press. The F/A-18 shot down had just flown off the deck of the USS Harry S. Truman aircraft carrier, Central Command said. On Dec. 15, Central Command acknowledged the Truman had entered the Mideast, but hadn’t specified that the carrier and its battle group was in the Red Sea. “The guided-missile cruiser USS Gettysburg, which is part of the USS Harry S. Truman Carrier Strike Group, mistakenly fired on and hit the F/A-18,” Central Command said in a statement. From the military’s description, the aircraft shot down was a two-seat F/A-18 Super Hornet fighter jet assigned to the “Red Rippers” of Strike Fighter Squadron 11 out of Naval Air Station Oceana, Virginia. It wasn’t immediately clear how the Gettysburg could mistake an F/A-18 for an enemy aircraft or missile, particularly as ships in a battle group remain linked by both radar and radio communication. However, Central Command said that warships and aircraft earlier shot down multiple Houthi drones and an anti-ship cruise missile launched by the rebels. Incoming hostile fire from the Houthis has given sailors just seconds to make decisions in the past. Since the Truman’s arrival, the U.S. has stepped up its airstrikes targeting the Houthis and their missile fire into the Red Sea and the surrounding area. However, the presence of an American warship group may spark renewed attacks from the rebels, like what the USS Dwight D. Eisenhower saw earlier this year. That deployment marked what the Navy described as its most intense combat since World War II. On Saturday night and early Sunday, U.S. warplanes conducted airstrikes that shook Sanaa, the capital of Yemen which the Houthis have held since 2014. Central Command described the strikes as targeting a “missile storage facility” and a “command-and-control facility,” without elaborating. Houthi-controlled media reported strikes in both Sanaa and around the port city of Hodeida, without offering any casualty or damage information. In Sanaa, strikes appeared particularly targeted at a mountainside known to be home to military installations. However, there were no images or information released regarding the strikes — which has happened previously when airstrikes hit vital facilities for the rebels. Brig. Gen. Yahya Saree, a Houthi military spokesman, released a prerecorded statement hours later in which he claimed the rebels launched eight drones and 17 cruise missiles in their attack. He also claimed without offering any evidence that the Houthis shot down the F/A-18, likely following a pattern of him making exaggerated claims. During the Eisenhower’s deployment, he repeatedly falsely claimed the carrier had been struck by Houthi fire. The Houthis have targeted about 100 merchant vessels with missiles and drones since the Israel-Hamas war in the Gaza Strip started in October 2023 after Hamas’ surprise attack on Israel that killed 1,200 people and saw 250 others taken hostage. Israel’s grinding offensive in Gaza has killed more than 45,000 Palestinians, local health officials say. The tally doesn’t distinguish between combatants and civilians. The Houthis have seized one vessel and sunk two in a campaign that has also killed four sailors. Other missiles and drones have either been intercepted by separate U.S.- and European-led coalitions in the Red Sea or failed to reach their targets, which have also included Western military vessels. The rebels maintain that they target ships linked to Israel, the U.S. or the United Kingdom to force an end to Israel’s campaign against Hamas in Gaza. However, many of the ships attacked have little or no connection to the conflict, including some bound for Iran. The Houthis also have increasingly targeted Israel itself with drones and missiles, resulting in retaliatory Israeli airstrikes. On Sunday, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said his country would act “forcefully” against the Houthis, as it has against other allies of Iran, “only in this case, we are not acting alone.” ________",

The Frenchman scored the first, and was involved in the other three, marking perhaps his best showing in white to date. Carlo Ancelotti will be annoyed that his side conceded twice, but this was otherwise a remarkably efficient attacking performance. It didn't take long for Madrid to find their flow. Los Blancos were on it from the first minute, and, if anything, it was a surprise that the first goal didn't come before the 10 minute mark. It was a wonderful one, though. Mbappe provided the first, an outrageous spank into the top corner from outside the box. The second came soon after, Federico Valverde smashing on in from outside the box after a well-worked corner routine. Rodrygo made it three about 34 minutes, completing a wonderful team goal with a calm finish. There was a Madrid blip, though, Isaac Romero pulling one back after getting concerningly open on a simple cross and header. That proved to be little more than an annoyance, though. Brahim Diaz bagged the fourth, redeeming an otherwise quiet performance with a fine combination and dink to put the game beyond reach. Los Blancos saw the game out after that. Mbappe had a couple of half chances, while some more incisive passing might have generated a chance or two. Still, those did little to impact what was an otherwise wonderful day for Carlo Ancelotti and Co., who are really starting to find their stride in La Liga.

                "title": "Boxing - Wikipedia",
                "content": "Boxing[b] is a combat sport and martial art.[1] Taking place in a boxing ring, it involves two people – usually wearing protective equipment, such as protective gloves, hand wraps, and mouthguards – throwing punches at each other for a predetermined amount of time. Although the term \"boxing\" is commonly attributed to western boxing, in which only fists are involved, it has developed in different ways in different geographical areas and cultures of the World. In global terms, \"boxing\" today is also a set of combat sports focused on striking, in which two opponents face each other in a fight using at least their fists, and possibly involving other actions, such as kicks, elbow strikes, knee strikes, and headbutts, depending on the rules. Some of these variants are the bare-knuckle boxing, kickboxing, Muay Thai, Lethwei, savate, and sanda.[2][3] Boxing techniques have been incorporated into many martial arts, military systems, and other combat sports. Humans have engaged in hand-to-hand combat since the earliest days of human history. The origins of boxing in any of its forms as a sport remain uncertain,[4] but some sources suggest that it has prehistoric roots in what is now Ethiopia, emerging as early as the sixth millennium BC. It is believed that when the Egyptians invaded Nubia, they adopted boxing from the local populace, subsequently popularizing it in Egypt. From there, the sport of boxing spread to various regions, including Greece, eastward to Mesopotamia, and northward to Rome.[5] The earliest visual evidence of any type of boxing is from Egypt and Sumer, both from the third millennia,[6] and can be seen in Sumerian carvings from the third and second millennia BC.[7][8][9][10] The earliest evidence of boxing rules dates back to Ancient Greece, where boxing was established as an Olympic game in 688 BC.[7] Boxing evolved from 16th- and 18th-century prizefights, largely in Great Britain, to the forerunner of modern boxing in the mid-19th century with the 1867 introduction of the Marquess of Queensberry Rules. Amateur boxing is both an Olympic and Commonwealth Games sport and is a standard fixture in most international games—it also has its world championships. Boxing is overseen by a referee[11] over a series of one-to-three-minute intervals called \"rounds\". A winner can be resolved before the completion of the rounds when a referee deems an opponent incapable of continuing, disqualifies an opponent, or the opponent resigns. When the fight reaches the end of its final round with both opponents still standing, the judges' scorecards determine the victor. In case both fighters gain equal scores from the judges, a professional bout is considered a draw. In Olympic boxing, because a winner must be declared, judges award the contest to one fighter on technical criteria. Hitting with different extremities of the body, such as kicks and punches, as an act of human aggression, has existed across the world throughout human history, being a combat system as old as wrestling. However, in terms of sports competition, due to the lack of writing in the prehistoric times and the lack of references, it is not possible to determine rules of any kind of boxing in prehistory, and in ancient times only can be inferred from the few intact sources and references to the sport. The origin of the sport of boxing is unknown,[4] however according to some sources boxing in any of its forms has prehistoric origins in present-day Ethiopia, where it appeared in the sixth millennium BC. When the Egyptians invaded Nubia they learned the art of boxing from the local population, and they took the sport to Egypt where it became popular. From Egypt, boxing spread to other countries including Greece, eastward to Mesopotamia, and northward to Rome.[5] The earliest visual evidence of any type of boxing comes from Egypt and Sumer both from the third millennium BC.[6][7] A relief sculpture from Egyptian Thebes (c. 1350 BC) shows both boxers and spectators.[7] These early Middle-Eastern and Egyptian depictions showed contests where fighters were either bare-fisted or had a band supporting the wrist.[7] The earliest evidence of use of gloves can be found in Minoan Crete (c. 1500–1400 BC).[7] Various types of boxing existed in ancient India. The earliest references to musti-yuddha come from classical Vedic epics such as the Rig Veda (c. 1500–1000 BCE) and Ramayana (c. 700–400 BCE).[12] The Mahabharata describes two combatants boxing with clenched fists and fighting with kicks, finger strikes, knee strikes and headbutts during the time of King Virata.[13] Duels (niyuddham) were often fought to the death. During the period of the Western Satraps, the ruler Rudradaman—in addition to being well-versed in \"the great sciences\" which included Indian classical music, Sanskrit grammar, and logic—was said to be an excellent horseman, charioteer, elephant rider, swordsman and boxer.[14] The Gurbilas Shemi, an 18th-century Sikh text, gives numerous references to musti-yuddha. The martial art is related to other forms of martial arts found in other parts of the Indian cultural sphere including Muay Thai in Thailand, Muay Lao in Laos, Pradal Serey in Cambodia and Lethwei in Myanmar.[15][16] In Ancient Greece boxing was a well developed sport called pygmachia, and enjoyed consistent popularity. In Olympic terms, it was first introduced in the 23rd Olympiad, 688 BC. The boxers would wind leather thongs around their hands in order to protect them. There were no rounds and boxers fought until one of them acknowledged defeat or could not continue. Weight categories were not used, which meant heavier fighters had a tendency to dominate. The style of boxing practiced typically featured an advanced left leg stance, with the left arm semi-extended as a guard, in addition to being used for striking, and with the right arm drawn back ready to strike. It was the head of the opponent which was primarily targeted, and there is little evidence to suggest that targeting the body or the use of kicks was common,[17][18] in which it resembled modern western boxing. Boxing was a popular spectator sport in Ancient Rome.[19] Fighters protected their knuckles with leather strips wrapped around their fists. Eventually harder leather was used and the strips became a weapon. Metal studs were introduced to the strips to make the cestus. Fighting events were held at Roman amphitheatres. Records of boxing activity disappeared in the west after the fall of the Western Roman Empire when the wearing of weapons became common once again and interest in fighting with the fists waned. However, there are detailed records of various fist-fighting sports that were maintained in different cities and provinces of Italy between the 12th and 17th centuries. There was also a sport in ancient Rus called kulachniy boy or 'fist fighting'.[20] As the wearing of swords became less common, there was renewed interest in fencing with the fists. The sport later resurfaced in England during the early 16th century in the form of bare-knuckle boxing, sometimes referred to as prizefighting. The first documented account of a bare-knuckle fight in England appeared in 1681 in the London Protestant Mercury, and the first English bare-knuckle champion was James Figg in 1719.[21] This is also the time when the word \"boxing\" first came to be used. This earliest form of modern boxing was very different. Contests in Mr. Figg's time, in addition to fist fighting, also contained fencing and cudgeling. On 6 January 1681, the first recorded boxing match took place in Britain when Christopher Monck, 2nd Duke of Albemarle (and later Lieutenant Governor of Jamaica), engineered a bout between his butler and his butcher with the latter winning the prize. Early fighting had no written rules. There were no weight divisions or round limits, and no referee. In general, it was extremely chaotic. An early article on boxing was published in Nottingham in 1713, by Sir Thomas Parkyns, 2nd Baronet, a wrestling patron from Bunny, Nottinghamshire, who had practised the techniques he described. The article, a single page in his manual of wrestling and fencing, Progymnasmata: The inn-play, or Cornish-hugg wrestler, described a system of headbutting, punching, eye-gouging, chokes, and hard throws, not recognized in boxing today.[22] The first boxing rules, called the Broughton Rules, were introduced by champion Jack Broughton in 1743 to protect fighters in the ring where deaths sometimes occurred.[23] Under these rules, if a man went down and could not continue after a count of 30 seconds, the fight was over. Hitting a downed fighter and grasping below the waist were prohibited. Broughton encouraged the use of \"mufflers\", a form of padded bandage or mitten, to be used in \"jousting\" or sparring sessions in training, and in exhibition matches. These rules did allow the fighters an advantage not enjoyed by today's boxers; they permitted the fighter to drop to one knee to end the round and begin the 30-second count at any time. Thus a fighter realizing he was in trouble had an opportunity to recover. However, this was considered \"unmanly\"[24] and was frequently disallowed by additional rules negotiated by the seconds of the boxers.[25] In modern boxing, there is a three-minute limit to rounds (unlike the downed fighter ends the round rule). Intentionally going down in modern boxing will cause the recovering fighter to lose points in the scoring system. Furthermore, as the contestants did not have heavy leather gloves and wristwraps to protect their hands, they used different punching technique to preserve their hands because the head was a common target to hit full out.[dubious – discuss][citation needed] Almost all period manuals have powerful straight punches with the whole body behind them to the face (including forehead) as the basic blows.[26][27][unreliable source?] The British sportswriter Pierce Egan coined the term \"the sweet science\" as an epithet for prizefighting – or more fully \"the sweet science of bruising\" as a description of England's bare-knuckle fight scene in the early nineteenth century.[28] Boxing could also be used to settle disputes even by females. In 1790 in Waddington, Lincolnshire Mary Farmery and Susanna Locker both laid claim to the affections of a young man; this produced a challenge from the former to fight for the prize, which was accepted by the latter. Proper sidesmen were chosen, and every matter conducted in form. After several knock-down blows on both sides, the battle ended in favour of Mary Farmery.[29] The London Prize Ring Rules introduced measures that remain in effect for professional boxing to this day, such as outlawing butting, gouging, scratching, kicking, hitting a man while down, holding the ropes, and using resin, stones or hard objects in the hands, and biting.[30] In 1867, the Marquess of Queensberry rules were drafted by John Chambers for amateur championships held at Lillie Bridge in London for lightweights, middleweights and heavyweights. The rules were published under the patronage of the Marquess of Queensberry, whose name has always been associated with them. There were twelve rules in all, and they specified that fights should be \"a fair stand-up boxing match\" in a 24-foot-square or similar ring. Rounds were three minutes with one-minute rest intervals between rounds. Each fighter was given a ten-second count if he was knocked down, and wrestling was banned. The introduction of gloves of \"fair-size\" also changed the nature of the bouts. An average pair of boxing gloves resembles a bloated pair of mittens and are laced up around the wrists.[32] The gloves can be used to block an opponent's blows. As a result of their introduction, bouts became longer and more strategic with greater importance attached to defensive maneuvers such as slipping, bobbing, countering and angling. Because less defensive emphasis was placed on the use of the forearms and more on the gloves, the classical forearms outwards, torso leaning back stance of the bare knuckle boxer was modified to a more modern stance in which the torso is tilted forward and the hands are held closer to the face. Through the late nineteenth century, the martial art of boxing or prizefighting was primarily a sport of dubious legitimacy. Outlawed in England and much of the United States, prizefights were often held at gambling venues and broken up by police.[33] Brawling and wrestling tactics continued, and riots at prizefights were common occurrences. Still, throughout this period, there arose some notable bare knuckle champions who developed fairly sophisticated fighting tactics. The English case of R v. Coney in 1882 found that a bare-knuckle fight was an assault occasioning actual bodily harm, despite the consent of the participants. This marked the end of widespread public bare-knuckle contests in England. The first world heavyweight champion under the Queensberry Rules was \"Gentleman Jim\" Corbett, who defeated John L. Sullivan in 1892 at the Pelican Athletic Club in New Orleans.[34] The first instance of film censorship in the United States occurred in 1897 when several states banned the showing of prize fighting films from the state of Nevada,[35] where it was legal at the time. Throughout the early twentieth century, boxers struggled to achieve legitimacy.[36] They were aided by the influence of promoters like Tex Rickard and the popularity of great champions such as John L. Sullivan. The modern sport arose from illegal venues and outlawed prizefighting and has become a multibillion-dollar commercial enterprise. A majority of young talent still comes from poverty-stricken areas around the world.[37] Places like Mexico, Africa, South America, and Eastern Europe prove to be filled with young aspiring athletes who wish to become the future of boxing. Even in the U.S., places like the inner cities of New York, and Chicago have given rise to promising young talent. According to Rubin, \"boxing lost its appeal with the American middle class, and most of who boxes in modern America come from the streets and are street fighters\".[38] The Marquess of Queensberry Rules have been the general rules governing modern boxing since their publication in 1867.[32] A boxing match typically consists of a determined number of three-minute rounds, a total of up to 9 to 12 rounds with a minute spent between each round with the fighters resting in their assigned corners and receiving advice and attention from their coach and staff. The fight is controlled by a referee who works within the ring to judge and control the conduct of the fighters, rule on their ability to fight safely, count knocked-down fighters, and rule on fouls. Up to three judges are typically present at ringside to score the bout and assign points to the boxers, based on punches and elbows that connect, defense, knockdowns, hugging and other, more subjective, measures. Because of the open-ended style of boxing judging, many fights have controversial results, in which one or both fighters believe they have been \"robbed\" or unfairly denied a victory. Each fighter has an assigned corner of the ring, where their coach, as well as one or more \"seconds\" may administer to the fighter at the beginning of the fight and between rounds. Each boxer enters into the ring from their assigned corners at the beginning of each round and must cease fighting and return to their corner at the signalled end of each round. A bout in which the predetermined number of rounds passes is decided by the judges, and is said to \"go the distance\". The fighter with the higher score at the end of the fight is ruled the winner. With three judges, unanimous and split decisions are possible, as are draws. A boxer may win the bout before a decision is reached through a knock-out; such bouts are said to have ended \"inside the distance\". If a fighter is knocked down during the fight, determined by whether the boxer touches the canvas floor of the ring with any part of their body other than the feet as a result of the opponent's punch and not a slip, as determined by the referee, the referee begins counting until the fighter returns to their feet and can continue. Some jurisdictions require the referee to count to eight regardless of if the fighter gets up before. Should the referee count to ten, then the knocked-down boxer is ruled \"knocked out\" (whether unconscious or not) and the other boxer is ruled the winner by knockout (KO). A \"technical knock-out\" (TKO) is possible as well, and is ruled by the referee, fight doctor, or a fighter's corner if a fighter is unable to safely continue to fight, based upon injuries or being judged unable to effectively defend themselves. Many jurisdictions and sanctioning agencies also have a \"three-knockdown rule\", in which three knockdowns in a given round result in a TKO. A TKO is considered a knockout in a fighter's record. A \"standing eight\" count rule may also be in effect. This gives the referee the right to step in and administer a count of eight to a fighter that the referee feels may be in danger, even if no knockdown has taken place. After counting the referee will observe the fighter, and decide if the fighter is fit to continue. For scoring purposes, a standing eight count is treated as a knockdown. In general, boxers are prohibited from hitting below the belt, holding, tripping, pushing, biting, or spitting. The boxer's shorts are raised so the opponent is not allowed to hit to the groin area with intent to cause pain or injury. Failure to abide by the former may result in a foul. They also are prohibited from kicking, head-butting, or hitting with any part of the arm other than the knuckles of a closed fist (including hitting with the elbow, shoulder or forearm, as well as with open gloves, the wrist, the inside, back or side of the hand). They are prohibited as well from hitting the back, back of the head or neck (called a \"rabbit-punch\") or the kidneys. They are prohibited from holding the ropes for support when punching, holding an opponent while punching, or ducking below the belt of their opponent (dropping below the waist of your opponent, no matter the distance between). If a \"clinch\" – a defensive move in which a boxer wraps their opponent's arms and holds on to create a pause – is broken by the referee, each fighter must take a full step back before punching again (alternatively, the referee may direct the fighters to \"punch out\" of the clinch). When a boxer is knocked down, the other boxer must immediately cease fighting and move to the furthest neutral corner of the ring until the referee has either ruled a knockout or called for the fight to continue. Violations of these rules may be ruled \"fouls\" by the referee, who may issue warnings, deduct points, or disqualify an offending boxer, causing an automatic loss, depending on the seriousness and intentionality of the foul. An intentional foul that causes injury that prevents a fight from continuing usually causes the boxer who committed it to be disqualified. A fighter who suffers an accidental low-blow may be given up to five minutes to recover, after which they may be ruled knocked out if they are unable to continue. Accidental fouls that cause injury ending a bout may lead to a \"no contest\" result, or else cause the fight to go to a decision if enough rounds (typically four or more, or at least three in a four-round fight) have passed. Unheard of in the modern era, but common during the early 20th Century in North America, a \"newspaper decision (NWS)\" might be made after a no decision bout had ended. A \"no decision\" bout occurred when, by law or by pre-arrangement of the fighters, if both boxers were still standing at the fight's conclusion and there was no knockout, no official decision was rendered and neither boxer was declared the winner. But this did not prevent the pool of ringside newspaper reporters from declaring a consensus result among themselves and printing a newspaper decision in their publications. Officially, however, a \"no decision\" bout resulted in neither boxer winning or losing. Boxing historians sometimes use these unofficial newspaper decisions in compiling fight records for illustrative purposes only. Often, media outlets covering a match will personally score the match, and post their scores as an independent sentence in their report. Throughout the 17th to 19th centuries, boxing bouts were motivated by money, as the fighters competed for prize money, promoters controlled the gate, and spectators bet on the result. The modern Olympic movement revived interest in amateur sports, and amateur boxing became an Olympic sport in 1908. In their current form, Olympic and other amateur bouts are typically limited to three or four rounds, scoring is computed by points based on the number of clean blows landed, regardless of impact, and fighters wear protective headgear, reducing the number of injuries, knockdowns, and knockouts.[39] Currently scoring blows in amateur boxing are subjectively counted by ringside judges, but the Australian Institute for Sport has demonstrated a prototype of an Automated Boxing Scoring System, which introduces scoring objectivity, improves safety, and arguably makes the sport more interesting to spectators. Professional boxing remains by far the most popular form of the sport globally, though amateur boxing is dominant in Cuba and some former Soviet republics. For most fighters, an amateur career, especially at the Olympics, serves to develop skills and gain experience in preparation for a professional career. Western boxers typically participate in one Olympics and then turn pro, while Cubans and boxers from other socialist countries have an opportunity to collect multiple medals.[40] In 2016, professional boxers were admitted in the Olympic Games and other tournaments sanctioned by AIBA.[41] This was done in part to level the playing field and give all of the athletes the same opportunities government-sponsored boxers from socialist countries and post-Soviet republics have.[42] However, professional organizations strongly opposed that decision.[43][44] Amateur boxing may be found at the collegiate level, at the Olympic Games, Commonwealth Games, Asian Games, etc. In many other venues sanctioned by amateur boxing associations. Amateur boxing has a point scoring system that measures the number of clean blows landed rather than physical damage. Bouts consist of three rounds of three minutes in the Olympic and Commonwealth Games, and three rounds of three minutes in a national ABA (Amateur Boxing Association) bout, each with a one-minute interval between rounds. Competitors wear protective headgear and gloves with a white strip or circle across the knuckle. There are cases however, where white ended gloves are not required but any solid color may be worn. The white end is just a way to make it easier for judges to score clean hits. Each competitor must have their hands properly wrapped, pre-fight, for added protection on their hands and for added cushion under the gloves. Gloves worn by the fighters must be twelve ounces in weight unless the fighters weigh under 165 pounds (75 kg), thus allowing them to wear ten ounce gloves. A punch is considered a scoring punch only when the boxers connect with the white portion of the gloves. Each punch that lands cleanly on the head or torso with sufficient force is awarded a point. A referee monitors the fight to ensure that competitors use only legal blows. A belt worn over the torso represents the lower limit of punches – any boxer repeatedly landing low blows below the belt is disqualified. Referees also ensure that the boxers don't use holding tactics to prevent the opponent from swinging. If this occurs, the referee separates the opponents and orders them to continue boxing. Repeated holding can result in a boxer being penalized or ultimately disqualified. Referees will stop the bout if a boxer is seriously injured, if one boxer is significantly dominating the other or if the score is severely imbalanced.[45] Amateur bouts which end this way may be noted as \"RSC\" (referee stopped contest) with notations for an outclassed opponent (RSCO), outscored opponent (RSCOS), injury (RSCI) or head injury (RSCH). Professional bouts are usually much longer than amateur bouts, typically ranging from ten to twelve rounds, though four-round fights are common for less experienced fighters or club fighters. There are also some two- and three-round professional bouts, especially in Australia. Through the early 20th century, it was common for fights to have unlimited rounds, ending only when one fighter quit, benefiting high-energy fighters like Jack Dempsey. Fifteen rounds remained the internationally recognized limit for championship fights for most of the 20th century until the early 1980s, when the death of boxer Kim Duk-koo eventually prompted the World Boxing Council and other organizations sanctioning professional boxing to reduce the limit to twelve rounds. Headgear is not permitted in professional bouts, and boxers are generally allowed to take much more damage before a fight is halted. At any time, the referee may stop the contest if he believes that one participant cannot defend himself due to injury. In that case, the other participant is awarded a technical knockout win. A technical knockout would also be awarded if a fighter lands a punch that opens a cut on the opponent, and the opponent is later deemed not fit to continue by a doctor because of the cut. For this reason, fighters often employ cutmen, whose job is to treat cuts between rounds so that the boxer is able to continue despite the cut. If a boxer simply quits fighting, or if his corner stops the fight, then the winning boxer is also awarded a technical knockout victory. In contrast with amateur boxing, professional male boxers have to be bare-chested.[46] \"Style\" is often defined as the strategic approach a fighter takes during a bout. No two fighters' styles are alike, as each is determined by that individual's physical and mental attributes. Three main styles exist in boxing: outside fighter (\"boxer\"), brawler (or \"slugger\"), and inside fighter (\"swarmer\"). These styles may be divided into several special subgroups, such as counter puncher, etc. The main philosophy of the styles is, that each style has an advantage over one, but disadvantage over the other one. It follows the rock paper scissors scenario – boxer beats brawler, brawler beats swarmer, and swarmer beats boxer.[47] A classic \"boxer\" or stylist (also known as an \"out-fighter\") seeks to maintain distance between himself and his opponent, fighting with faster, longer range punches, most notably the jab, and gradually wearing his opponent down. Due to this reliance on weaker punches, out-fighters tend to win by point decisions rather than by knockout, though some out-fighters have notable knockout records. They are often regarded as the best boxing strategists due to their ability to control the pace of the fight and lead their opponent, methodically wearing him down and exhibiting more skill and finesse than a brawler.[48] Out-fighters need reach, hand speed, reflexes, and footwork. Notable out-fighters include Muhammad Ali, Larry Holmes, Joe Calzaghe, Wilfredo Gómez, Salvador Sánchez, Cecilia Brækhus, Gene Tunney,[49] Ezzard Charles,[50] Willie Pep,[51] Meldrick Taylor, Ricardo \"Finito\" López, Floyd Mayweather Jr., Roy Jones Jr., Sugar Ray Leonard, Miguel Vázquez, Sergio \"Maravilla\" Martínez, Wladimir Klitschko and Guillermo Rigondeaux. This style was also used by fictional boxer Apollo Creed. A boxer-puncher is a well-rounded boxer who is able to fight at close range with a combination of technique and power, often with the ability to knock opponents out with a combination and in some instances a single shot. Their movement and tactics are similar to that of an out-fighter (although they are generally not as mobile as an out-fighter),[52] but instead of winning by decision, they tend to wear their opponents down using combinations and then move in to score the knockout. A boxer must be well rounded to be effective using this style. Notable boxer-punchers include Muhammad Ali, Canelo Álvarez, Sugar Ray Leonard, Roy Jones Jr., Wladimir Klitschko, Vasyl Lomachenko, Lennox Lewis, Joe Louis,[53] Wilfredo Gómez, Oscar De La Hoya, Archie Moore, Miguel Cotto, Nonito Donaire, Sam Langford,[54] Henry Armstrong,[55] Sugar Ray Robinson,[56] Tony Zale, Carlos Monzón,[57] Alexis Argüello, Érik Morales, Terry Norris, Marco Antonio Barrera, Naseem Hamed, Thomas Hearns, Julian Jackson and Gennady Golovkin. Counter punchers are slippery, defensive style fighters who often rely on their opponent's mistakes in order to gain the advantage, whether it be on the score cards or more preferably a knockout. They use their well-rounded defense to avoid or block shots and then immediately catch the opponent off guard with a well placed and timed punch. A fight with a skilled counter-puncher can turn into a war of attrition, where each shot landed is a battle in itself. Thus, fighting against counter punchers requires constant feinting and the ability to avoid telegraphing one's attacks. To be truly successful using this style they must have good reflexes, a high level of prediction and awareness, pinpoint accuracy and speed, both in striking and in footwork. Notable counter punchers include Muhammad Ali, Joe Calzaghe, Vitali Klitschko, Evander Holyfield, Max Schmeling, Chris Byrd, Jim Corbett, Jack Johnson, Bernard Hopkins, Laszlo Papp, Jerry Quarry, Anselmo Moreno, James Toney, Marvin Hagler, Juan Manuel Márquez, Humberto Soto, Floyd Mayweather Jr., Roger Mayweather, Pernell Whitaker, Sergio Martínez and Guillermo Rigondeaux. This style of boxing is also used by fictional boxer Little Mac. Counter punchers usually wear their opponents down by causing them to miss their punches. The more the opponent misses, the faster they tire, and the psychological effects of being unable to land a hit will start to sink in. The counter puncher often tries to outplay their opponent entirely, not just in a physical sense, but also in a mental and emotional sense. This style can be incredibly difficult, especially against seasoned fighters, but winning a fight without getting hit is often worth the pay-off. They usually try to stay away from the center of the ring, in order to outmaneuver and chip away at their opponents. A large advantage in counter-hitting is the forward momentum of the attacker, which drives them further into your return strike. As such, knockouts are more common than one would expect from a defensive style. A brawler is a fighter who generally lacks finesse and footwork in the ring, but makes up for it through sheer punching power. Many brawlers tend to lack mobility, preferring a less mobile, more stable platform and have difficulty pursuing fighters who are fast on their feet. They may also have a tendency to ignore combination punching in favor of continuous beat-downs with one hand and by throwing slower, more powerful single punches (such as hooks and uppercuts). Their slowness and predictable punching pattern (single punches with obvious leads) often leaves them open to counter punches, so successful brawlers must be able to absorb a substantial amount of punishment. However, not all brawler/slugger fighters are not mobile; some can move around and switch styles if needed but still have the brawler/slugger style such as Wilfredo Gómez, Prince Naseem Hamed and Danny García. A brawler's most important assets are power and chin (the ability to absorb punishment while remaining able to continue boxing). Examples of this style include George Foreman, Rocky Marciano, Julio César Chávez, Jack Dempsey, Riddick Bowe, Danny García, Wilfredo Gómez, Sonny Liston, John L. Sullivan, Max Baer, Prince Naseem Hamed, Ray Mancini, David Tua, Arturo Gatti, Micky Ward, Brandon Ríos, Ruslan Provodnikov, Michael Katsidis, James Kirkland, Marcos Maidana, Vitali Klitschko, Jake LaMotta, Manny Pacquiao, and Ireland's John Duddy. This style of boxing was also used by fictional boxers Rocky Balboa and James \"Clubber\" Lang. Brawlers tend to be more predictable and easy to hit but usually fare well enough against other fighting styles because they train to take punches very well. They often have a higher chance than other fighting styles to score a knockout against their opponents because they focus on landing big, powerful hits, instead of smaller, faster attacks. Oftentimes they place focus on training on their upper body instead of their entire body, to increase power and endurance. They also aim to intimidate their opponents because of their power, stature and ability to take a punch. In-fighters/swarmers (sometimes called \"pressure fighters\") attempt to stay close to an opponent, throwing intense flurries and combinations of hooks and uppercuts. Mainly Mexican, Irish, Irish-American, Puerto Rican, and Mexican-American boxers popularized this style. A successful in-fighter often needs a good \"chin\" because swarming usually involves being hit with many jabs before they can maneuver inside where they are more effective. In-fighters operate best at close range because they are generally shorter and have less reach than their opponents and thus are more effective at a short distance where the longer arms of their opponents make punching awkward. However, several fighters tall for their division have been relatively adept at in-fighting as well as out-fighting. The essence of a swarmer is non-stop aggression. Many short in-fighters use their stature to their advantage, employing a bob-and-weave defense by bending at the waist to slip underneath or to the sides of incoming punches. Unlike blocking, causing an opponent to miss a punch disrupts his balance, this permits forward movement past the opponent's extended arm and keeps the hands free to counter. A distinct advantage that in-fighters have is when throwing uppercuts, they can channel their entire bodyweight behind the punch; Mike Tyson was famous for throwing devastating uppercuts. Marvin Hagler was known for his hard \"chin\", punching power, body attack and the stalking of his opponents. Some in-fighters, like Mike Tyson, have been known for being notoriously hard to hit. The key to a swarmer is aggression, endurance, chin, and bobbing-and-weaving. Notable in-fighters include Henry Armstrong, Aaron Pryor, Julio César Chávez, Jack Dempsey, Shawn Porter, Miguel Cotto, Gennady Golovkin, Joe Frazier, Danny García, Mike Tyson, Manny Pacquiao, Rocky Marciano,[58] Wayne McCullough, James Braddock, Gerry Penalosa, Harry Greb,[59][60] David Tua, James Toney and Ricky Hatton. This style was also used by the Street Fighter character Balrog.[citation needed] All fighters have primary skills with which they feel most comfortable, but truly elite fighters are often able to incorporate auxiliary styles when presented with a particular challenge. For example, an out-fighter will sometimes plant his feet and counter punch, or a slugger may have the stamina to pressure fight with his power punches. Old history of the development of boxing and its prevalence contribute to fusion of various types of martial arts and the emergence of new ones that are based on them. For example, a combination of boxing and sportive sambo techniques gave rise to a combat sambo. There is a generally accepted rule of thumb about the success each of these boxing styles has against the others. In general, an in-fighter has an advantage over an out-fighter, an out-fighter has an advantage over a brawler, and a brawler has an advantage over an in-fighter; these form a cycle with each style being stronger relative to one, and weaker relative to another, with none dominating, as in rock paper scissors. Naturally, many other factors, such as the skill level and training of the combatants, determine the outcome of a fight, but the widely held belief in this relationship among the styles is embodied in the cliché amongst boxing fans and writers that \"styles make fights\". Brawlers tend to overcome swarmers or in-fighters because, in trying to get close to the slugger, the in-fighter will invariably have to walk straight into the guns of the much harder-hitting brawler, so, unless the former has a very good chin and the latter's stamina is poor, the brawler's superior power will carry the day. A famous example of this type of match-up advantage would be George Foreman's knockout victory over Joe Frazier in their original bout \"The Sunshine Showdown\". Although in-fighters struggle against heavy sluggers, they typically enjoy more success against out-fighters or boxers. Out-fighters prefer a slower fight, with some distance between themselves and the opponent. The in-fighter tries to close that gap and unleash furious flurries. On the inside, the out-fighter loses a lot of his combat effectiveness, because he cannot throw the hard punches. The in-fighter is generally successful in this case, due to his intensity in advancing on his opponent and his good agility, which makes him difficult to evade. For example, the swarming Joe Frazier, though easily dominated by the slugger George Foreman, was able to create many more problems for the boxer Muhammad Ali in their three fights. Joe Louis, after retirement, admitted that he hated being crowded, and that swarmers like untied/undefeated champ Rocky Marciano would have caused him style problems even in his prime. The boxer or out-fighter tends to be most successful against a brawler, whose slow speed (both hand and foot) and poor technique makes him an easy target to hit for the faster out-fighter. The out-fighter's main concern is to stay alert, as the brawler only needs to land one good punch to finish the fight. If the out-fighter can avoid those power punches, he can often wear the brawler down with fast jabs, tiring him out. If he is successful enough, he may even apply extra pressure in the later rounds in an attempt to achieve a knockout. Most classic boxers, such as Muhammad Ali, enjoyed their best successes against sluggers. An example of a style matchup was the historical fight of Julio César Chávez, a swarmer or in-fighter, against Meldrick Taylor, the boxer or out-fighter (see Julio César Chávez vs. Meldrick Taylor). The match was nicknamed \"Thunder Meets Lightning\" as an allusion to punching power of Chávez and blinding speed of Taylor. Chávez was the epitome of the \"Mexican\" style of boxing. Taylor's hand and foot speed and boxing abilities gave him the early advantage, allowing him to begin building a large lead on points. Chávez remained relentless in his pursuit of Taylor and due to his greater punching power Chávez slowly punished Taylor. Coming into the later rounds, Taylor was bleeding from the mouth, his entire face was swollen, the bones around his eye socket had been broken, he had swallowed a considerable amount of his own blood, and as he grew tired, Taylor was increasingly forced into exchanging blows with Chávez, which only gave Chávez a greater chance to cause damage. While there was little doubt that Taylor had solidly won the first three quarters of the fight, the question at hand was whether he would survive the final quarter. Going into the final round, Taylor held a secure lead on the scorecards of two of the three judges. Chávez would have to knock Taylor out to claim a victory, whereas Taylor merely needed to stay away from the Mexican legend. However, Taylor did not stay away, but continued to trade blows with Chávez. As he did so, Taylor showed signs of extreme exhaustion, and every tick of the clock brought Taylor closer to victory unless Chávez could knock him out. With about a minute left in the round, Chávez hit Taylor squarely with several hard punches and stayed on the attack, continuing to hit Taylor with well-placed shots. Finally, with about 25 seconds to go, Chávez landed a hard right hand that caused Taylor to stagger forward towards a corner, forcing Chávez back ahead of him. Suddenly Chávez stepped around Taylor, positioning him so that Taylor was trapped in the corner, with no way to escape from Chávez' desperate final flurry. Chávez then nailed Taylor with a tremendous right hand that dropped the younger man. By using the ring ropes to pull himself up, Taylor managed to return to his feet and was given the mandatory 8-count. Referee Richard Steele asked Taylor twice if he was able to continue fighting, but Taylor failed to answer. Steele then concluded that Taylor was unfit to continue and signaled that he was ending the fight, resulting in a TKO victory for Chávez with only two seconds to go in the bout. Since boxing involves forceful, repetitive punching, precautions must be taken to prevent damage to bones in the hand. Most trainers do not allow boxers to train and spar without wrist wraps and boxing gloves. Hand wraps are used to secure the bones in the hand, and the gloves are used to protect the hands from blunt injury, allowing boxers to throw punches with more force than if they did not use them. Gloves have been required in competition since the late nineteenth century, though modern boxing gloves are much heavier than those worn by early twentieth-century fighters. Prior to a bout, both boxers agree upon the weight of gloves to be used in the bout, with the understanding that lighter gloves allow heavy punchers to inflict more damage. The brand of gloves can also affect the impact of punches, so this too is usually stipulated before a bout. Both sides are allowed to inspect the wraps and gloves of the opponent to help ensure both are within agreed upon specifications and no tampering has taken place. A mouthguard is important to protect the teeth[61][62] and gums from injury, and to cushion the jaw, resulting in a decreased chance of knockout. Both fighters must wear soft soled shoes to reduce the damage from accidental (or intentional) stepping on feet. While older boxing boots more commonly resembled those of a professional wrestler, modern boxing shoes and boots tend to be quite similar to their amateur wrestling counterparts. Boxers practice their skills on several types of punching bags. A small, tear-drop-shaped \"speed bag\" is used to hone reflexes and repetitive punching skills, while a large cylindrical \"heavy bag\" filled with sand, a synthetic substitute, or water is used to practice power punching and body blows. The double-end bag is usually connected by elastic on the top and bottom and moves randomly upon getting struck and helps the fighter work on accuracy and reflexes. In addition to these distinctive pieces of equipment, boxers also use sport-nonspecific training equipment to build strength, speed, agility, and stamina. Common training equipment includes free weights, rowing machines, jump rope, and medicine balls. Boxers also use punch/focus mitts in which a trainer calls out certain combinations and the fighter strikes the mitts accordingly. This is a great exercise for stamina as the boxer isn't allowed to go at his own pace but that of the trainer, typically forcing the fighter to endure a higher output and volume than usual. In addition, they also allow trainers to make boxers utilize footwork and distances more accurately. Recently boxing clubs have started using something called music boxing machines to train newbies in a more musical way to gain rhythm. Boxing matches typically take place in a boxing ring, a raised platform surrounded by ropes attached to posts rising in each corner. The term \"ring\" has come to be used as a metaphor for many aspects of prize fighting in general. The modern boxing stance differs substantially from the typical boxing stances of the 19th and early 20th centuries. The modern stance has a more upright vertical-armed guard, as opposed to the more horizontal, knuckles-facing-forward guard adopted by early 20th century hook users such as Jack Johnson. In a fully upright stance, the boxer stands with the legs shoulder-width apart and the rear foot a half-step in front of the lead man. Right-handed or orthodox boxers lead with the left foot and fist (for most penetration power). Both feet are parallel, and the right heel is off the ground. The lead (left) fist is held vertically about six inches in front of the face at eye level. The rear (right) fist is held beside the chin and the elbow tucked against the ribcage to protect the body. The chin is tucked into the chest to avoid punches to the jaw which commonly cause knock-outs and is often kept slightly off-center. Wrists are slightly bent to avoid damage when punching and the elbows are kept tucked in to protect the ribcage. Some boxers fight from a crouch, leaning forward and keeping their feet closer together. The stance described is considered the \"textbook\" stance and fighters are encouraged to change it around once it's been mastered as a base. Case in point, many fast fighters have their hands down and have almost exaggerated footwork, while brawlers or bully fighters tend to slowly stalk their opponents. In order to retain their stance boxers take 'the first step in any direction with the foot already leading in that direction.'[63] Different stances allow for bodyweight to be differently positioned and emphasised; this may in turn alter how powerfully and explosively a type of punch can be delivered. For instance, a crouched stance allows for the bodyweight to be positioned further forward over the lead left leg. If a lead left hook is thrown from this position, it will produce a powerful springing action in the lead leg and produce a more explosive punch. This springing action could not be generated effectively, for this punch, if an upright stance was used or if the bodyweight was positioned predominantly over the back leg.[64] Mike Tyson was a keen practitioner of a crouched stance and this style of power punching. The preparatory positioning of the bodyweight over the bent lead leg is also known as an isometric preload. Left-handed or southpaw fighters use a mirror image of the orthodox stance, which can create problems for orthodox fighters unaccustomed to receiving jabs, hooks, or crosses from the opposite side. The southpaw stance, conversely, is vulnerable to a straight right hand. North American fighters tend to favor a more balanced stance, facing the opponent almost squarely, while many European fighters stand with their torso turned more to the side. The positioning of the hands may also vary, as some fighters prefer to have both hands raised in front of the face, risking exposure to body shots. There are four basic punches in boxing: the jab, cross, hook and uppercut. Any punch other than a jab is considered a power punch. If a boxer is right-handed (orthodox), their left hand is the lead hand and his right hand is the rear hand. For a left-handed boxer or southpaw, the hand positions are reversed. For clarity, the following assumes a right-handed boxer. These different punch types can be thrown in rapid succession to form combinations or \"combos\". The most common is the jab and cross combination, nicknamed the \"one-two combo\". This is usually an effective combination, because the jab blocks the opponent's view of the cross, making it easier to land cleanly and forcefully. A large, swinging circular punch starting from a cocked-back position with the arm at a longer extension than the hook and all of the fighter's weight behind it is sometimes referred to as a \"roundhouse\", \"haymaker\", \"overhand\", or sucker-punch. Relying on body weight and centripetal force within a wide arc, the roundhouse can be a powerful blow, but it is often a wild and uncontrolled punch that leaves the fighter delivering it off balance and with an open guard. Wide, looping punches have the further disadvantage of taking more time to deliver, giving the opponent ample warning to react and counter. For this reason, the haymaker or roundhouse is not a conventional punch, and is regarded by trainers as a mark of poor technique or desperation. Sometimes it has been used, because of its immense potential power, to finish off an already staggering opponent who seems unable or unlikely to take advantage of the poor position it leaves the puncher in. Another unconventional punch is the rarely used bolo punch, in which the opponent swings an arm out several times in a wide arc, usually as a distraction, before delivering with either that or the other arm. An illegal punch to the back of the head or neck is known as a rabbit punch. Both the hook and uppercut may be thrown with both hands, resulting in differing footwork and positioning from that described above if thrown by the other hand. Generally the analogous opposite is true of the footwork and torso movement. There are several basic maneuvers a boxer can use in order to evade or block punches, depicted and discussed below. In boxing, each fighter is given a corner of the ring where they rest in between rounds for 1 minute and where their trainers stand. Typically, three individuals stand in the corner besides the boxer; these are the trainer, the assistant trainer and the cutman. The trainer and assistant typically give advice to the boxer on what they are doing wrong as well as encouraging them if they are losing. The cutman is a cutaneous doctor responsible for keeping the boxer's face and eyes free of cuts, blood and excessive swelling. This is of particular importance because many fights are stopped because of cuts or swelling that threaten the boxer's eyes. In addition, the corner is responsible for stopping the fight if they feel their fighter is in grave danger of permanent injury. The corner will occasionally throw in a white towel to signify a boxer's surrender (the idiomatic phrase \"to throw in the towel\", meaning to give up, derives from this practice).[69] This can be seen in the fight between Diego Corrales and Floyd Mayweather. In that fight, Corrales' corner surrendered despite Corrales' steadfast refusal. Participating in boxing causes physical injuries. Injuries to the head are most commonly experienced by participants.[70] Deaths of boxers during or after a bout from injuries received in the ring do occur. A 2011 study of bouts from 1890 and 2011 calculated an average death rate of 13 participants per year, for the years studied.[71] An Australian study from 2022 found that efforts passed to improve safety in the sport in 2011 were unsuccessful at preventing deaths of participants in the sport.[72] Knocking a person unconscious or even causing a concussion may cause permanent brain damage.[73] There is no clear division between the force required to knock a person out and the force likely to kill a person.[74] Additionally, contact sports, especially combat sports, are directly related to a brain disease called chronic traumatic encephalopathy, abbreviated as CTE. This disease begins to develop during the life of the athlete, and continues to develop even after sports activity has ceased. In March 1981, neurosurgeon Fred Sonstein sought to use CAT scans in an attempt to track the degeneration of boxers' cognitive functions after seeing the decline of Bennie Briscoe.[75] From 1980 to 2007, more than 200 amateur boxers, professional boxers and Toughman fighters died due to ring or training injuries.[76] In 1983, editorials in the Journal of the American Medical Association called for a ban on boxing.[77] The editor, George Lundberg, called boxing an \"obscenity\" that \"should not be sanctioned by any civilized society\".[78] Since then, the British,[79] Canadian[80] and Australian[81] Medical Associations have called for bans on boxing. Supporters of the ban state that boxing is the only sport where hurting the other athlete is the goal. Bill O'Neill, boxing spokesman for the British Medical Association, has supported the BMA's proposed ban on boxing: \"It is the only sport where the intention is to inflict serious injury on your opponent, and we feel that we must have a total ban on boxing.\"[82] Opponents respond that such a position is misguided opinion, stating that amateur boxing is scored solely according to total connecting blows with no award for \"injury\". They observe that many skilled professional boxers have had rewarding careers without inflicting injury on opponents by accumulating scoring blows and avoiding punches winning rounds scored 10–9 by the 10-point must system, and they note that there are many other sports where concussions are much more prevalent.[citation needed] However, the data shows that the concussion rate in boxing is the highest of all contact sports.[83][84][85] In addition, repetitive and subconcussive blows to the head, and not just concussions, cause CTE,[86][87][88][89][90][91] and the evidence indicates that brain damage and the effects of CTE are more severe in boxing.[92][93][94][95][96][97] In 2007, one study of amateur boxers showed that protective headgear did not prevent brain damage,[98] and another found that amateur boxers faced a high risk of brain damage.[99] The Gothenburg study analyzed temporary levels of neurofilament light in cerebral spinal fluid which they conclude is evidence of damage, even though the levels soon subside. More comprehensive studies of neurological function on larger samples performed by Johns Hopkins University in 1994 and accident rates analyzed by National Safety Council in 2017 show amateur boxing is a comparatively safe sport due to the regulations of amateur boxing and a greater control of the athletes,[100] although the studies did not focus on CTE or its long-term effects. In addition, a good training methodology and short career can reduce the effects of brain damage.[101] In 1997, the American Association of Professional Ringside Physicians was established to create medical protocols through research and education to prevent injuries in boxing.[102][103] Professional boxing is forbidden in Iceland,[104] Iran and North Korea. It was banned in Sweden until 2007 when the ban was lifted but strict restrictions, including four three-minute rounds for fights, were imposed.[105] Boxing was banned in Albania from 1965 until the fall of Communism in 1991. Norway legalized professional boxing in December 2014.[106] The International Boxing Association (AIBA) restricted the use of head guards for senior males at the World Championships and Olympics after 2013.[107][108] A literature review study analyses present knowledge about protecting headgear and injury prevention in boxing to determine if injury risks associated with not head guard usage increased. The research of the reviewed literature indicates that head guards cover well against lacerations and skull fractures. Therefore, AIBA's decision to terminate the head guard must be considered cautiously, and injury rates among (male) boxers should be continuously evaluated.[109] Like other active and dynamic sports, boxing may be argued to provide some general health benefits, such as fat burning, increased muscle tone, strong bones and ligaments, cardiovascular fitness, muscular endurance, improved core stability, co-ordination and body awareness, strength and power, stress relief and self-esteem. The sport of boxing has two internationally recognized boxing halls of fame; the International Boxing Hall of Fame (IBHOF)[110] and the Boxing Hall of Fame Las Vegas. The latter opened in Las Vegas, Nevada in 2013 and was founded by Steve Lott, former assistant manager for Mike Tyson.[111] The International Boxing Hall of Fame opened in Canastota, New York in 1989. The first inductees in 1990 included Jack Johnson, Benny Leonard, Jack Dempsey, Henry Armstrong, Sugar Ray Robinson, Archie Moore, and Muhammad Ali. Other world-class figures[112] include Salvador Sanchez, Jose Napoles, Roberto \"Manos de Piedra\" Durán, Ricardo Lopez, Gabriel \"Flash\" Elorde, Vicente Saldivar, Ismael Laguna, Eusebio Pedroza, Carlos Monzón, Azumah Nelson, Rocky Marciano, Pipino Cuevas, Wilfred Benitez, Wilfredo Gomez, Felix Trinidad and Ken Buchanan. The Hall of Fame's induction ceremony is held every June as part of a four-day event. The fans who come to Canastota for the Induction Weekend are treated to a number of events, including scheduled autograph sessions, boxing exhibitions, a parade featuring past and present inductees, and the induction ceremony itself. The Boxing Hall of Fame Las Vegas features the $75 million ESPN Classic Sports fight film and tape library and radio broadcast collection. The collection includes the fights of many great champions, including: Muhammad Ali, Mike Tyson, George Foreman, Roberto Durán, Marvin Hagler, Jack Dempsey, Joe Louis, Joe Frazier, Rocky Marciano and Sugar Ray Robinson. It is this exclusive fight film library that will separate the Boxing Hall of Fame Las Vegas from the other halls of fame which do not have rights to any video of their sports. The inaugural inductees included Muhammad Ali, Henry Armstrong, Tony Canzoneri, Ezzard Charles, Julio César Chávez Sr., Jack Dempsey, Roberto Durán, Joe Louis, and Sugar Ray Robinson.[113] There are various organization and websites, that rank boxers in both weight class and pound-for-pound manner.",

                "content": "Our editors will review what you’ve submitted and determine whether to revise the article. boxing, sport, both amateur and professional, involving attack and defense with the fists. Boxers usually wear padded gloves and generally observe the code set forth in the marquess of Queensberry rules. Matched in weight and ability, boxing contestants try to land blows hard and often with their fists, each attempting to avoid the blows of the opponent. A boxer wins a match either by outscoring the opponent—points can be tallied in several ways—or by rendering the opponent incapable of continuing the match. Bouts range from 3 to 12 rounds, each round normally lasting three minutes. (Read Gene Tunney’s 1929 Britannica essay on boxing.) The terms pugilism and prizefighting in modern usage are practically synonymous with boxing, although the first term indicates the ancient origins of the sport in its derivation from the Latin pugil, “a boxer,” related to the Latin pugnus, “fist,” and derived in turn from the Greek pyx, “with clenched fist.” The term prizefighting emphasizes pursuit of the sport for monetary gain, which began in England in the 17th century. Boxing first appeared as a formal Olympic event in the 23rd Olympiad (688 bce), but fist-fighting contests must certainly have had their origin in mankind’s prehistory. The earliest visual evidence for boxing appears in Sumerian relief carvings from the 3rd millennium bce. A relief sculpture from Egyptian Thebes (c. 1350 bce) shows both boxers and spectators. The few extant Middle Eastern and Egyptian depictions are of bare-fisted contests with, at most, a simple band supporting the wrist; the earliest evidence of the use of gloves or hand coverings in boxing is a carved vase from Minoan Crete (c. 1500 bce) that shows helmeted boxers wearing a stiff plate strapped to the fist. The earliest evidence of rules for the sport comes from ancient Greece. These ancient contests had no rounds; they continued until one man either acknowledged defeat by holding up a finger or was unable to continue. Clinching (holding an opponent at close quarters with one or both arms) was strictly forbidden. Contests were held outdoors, which added the challenge of intense heat and bright sunlight to the fight. Contestants represented all social classes; in the early years of the major athletic festivals, a preponderance of the boxers came from wealthy and distinguished backgrounds. The Greeks considered boxing the most injurious of their sports. A 1st-century-bce inscription praising a pugilist states, “A boxer’s victory is gained in blood.” In fact, Greek literature offers much evidence that the sport caused disfigurement and, occasionally, even death. An amazingly bloody bout is recounted by Homer in the Iliad (c. 675 bce): By the 4th century bce, the simple ox-hide thongs described in the Iliad had been replaced by what the Greeks called “sharp thongs,” which had a thick strip of hard leather over the knuckles that made them into lacerative weapons. Although the Greeks used padded gloves for practice, not dissimilar from the modern boxing glove, these gloves had no role in actual contests. The Romans developed a glove called the caestus (cestus) that is seen in Roman mosaics and described in their literature; this glove often had lumps of metal or spikes sewn into the leather. The caestus is an important feature in a boxing match in Virgil’s Aeneid (1st century bce). The story of the match between Dares and Entellus is majestically told in this passage from the pugilism article in the 11th edition of Encyclopædia Britannica: Further on we find the account of the games on the occasion of the funeral of Anchises, in the course of which Dares, the Trojan, receiving no answer to his challenge from the Sicilians, who stood aghast at his mighty proportions, claims the prize; but, just as it is about to be awarded him, Entellus, an aged but huge and sinewy Sicilian, arises and casts into the arena as a sign of his acceptance of the combat the massive cesti, all stained with blood and brains, which he has inherited from King Eryx, his master in the art of boxing. The Trojans are now appalled in their turn, and Dares, aghast at the fearful implements, refused the battle, which, however, is at length begun after Aeneas has furnished the heroes with equally matched cesti. For some time the young and lusty Dares circles about his gigantic but old and stiff opponent, upon whom he rains a torrent of blows which are avoided by the clever guarding and dodging of the Sicilian hero. At last Entellus, having got his opponent into a favourable position, raises his tremendous right hand on high and aims a terrible blow at the Trojan’s head; but the wary Dares deftly steps aside, and Entellus, missing his adversary altogether, falls headlong by the impetus of his own blow, with a crash like that of a falling pine. Shouts of mingled exultation and dismay break from the multitude, and the friends of the aged Sicilian rush forward to raise their fallen champion and bear him from the arena; but, greatly to the astonishment of all, Entellus motions them away and returns to the fight more keenly than before. The old man’s blood is stirred, and he attacks his youthful enemy with such furious and headlong rushes, buffeting him grievously with both hands, that Aeneas put an end to the battle, though barely in time to save the discomfited Trojan from being beaten into insensibility. Roman boxing took place in both the sporting and gladiatorial arenas. Roman soldiers often boxed each other for sport and as training for hand-to-hand combat. The gladiatorial boxing contests usually ended only with the death of the losing boxer. With the rise of Christianity and the concurrent decline of the Roman Empire, pugilism as entertainment apparently ceased to exist for many centuries.",

KANSAS CITY, Mo. -- — Patrick Mahomes knew he could run on the ankle he sprained last week. The bigger concern for the Chiefs quarterback was how he would stop, when all the weight and pressure and momentum would land squarely upon it. The solution against Houston was simple: Mahomes didn't stop. The two-time MVP kept chugging forward until he plowed into the end zone on a 15-yard scramble to cap the Chiefs' opening drive on Saturday. Mahomes proceeded to throw for 260 yards and another score, never once looking troubled by his ailing ankle, and led Kansas City to a 27-19 victory that put the Chiefs on the brink of the No. 1 seed in the AFC playoffs. The Chiefs (14-1) can clinch the postseason bye and home-field advantage if Buffalo loses to or ties New England on Sunday. If the Bills win, Kansas City can wrap it up by beating Pittsburgh on Christmas Day — its third game in an 11-day span. “I ask a lot from the guys around me. I feel like if I'm going to ask them to play through pain and nicks and bruises, I've got to do it as well,” Mahomes said. “That's something that I pride myself on is being out there with my guys.” Xavier Worthy had seven catches for 65 yards and a touchdown, Kareem Hunt ran for 55 yards and another score, and Marquise Brown had five catches for 45 yards for Kansas City in his first game this season after recovering from a shoulder injury. The result was what Chiefs coach Andy Reid called his team's most comprehensive performance of the season. As for Mahomes? “He spoils the dog out of us, he's so tough,” Reid said. “You get used to it. But most guys don't come back from that like he did.” C.J. Stroud threw for 244 yards and two touchdowns with two interceptions for Houston (9-6), and one of those TD throws came at a great expense. Tank Dell, who had six catches for 98 yards, sustained a devastating knee injury on the play and was taken to the University of Kansas Medical Center, where Texans coach DeMeco Ryans said he would remain overnight. “All our thoughts and prayers are with Tank right now. You see what he means to our entire team,” Ryans said. “It hurts to see him go down like that. He was having a fantastic game, playing really well for us.” Stroud was visibly shaken by the injury and had to be consoled by teammates on the sideline. “I mean, all you can really do is pray,” he said. There were questions early in the week about whether Mahomes, who has a history of ankle injuries, would play at all after he sustained a high ankle sprain late in last week's win over Cleveland. But he was off the injury report by Friday, and he was on the field and leading the Chiefs to a touchdown on their opening possession. His scramble for a score was merely the start of a back-and-forth first half. The Texans answered with a 33-yard field goal, then went on a 13-play, 82-yard drive that ended with Stroud's touchdown toss to Dalton Schutlz. But the Chiefs quickly regained the lead when Hunt barreled into the end zone, and they tacked on a field goal a few minutes later after Stroud's second interception to lead 17-10 at the break. Dell was hurt on the Texans' opening drive of the third quarter. He was coming across the back of the end zone and made a spectacular catch but collided with teammate Jared Wayne on his way to the ground. He immediately grabbed his left knee, and players from both teams surrounded him as he was loaded onto a cart and driven from the field. Ka'imi Fairbairn promptly missed the extra point, and any momentum Houston might've had disappeared. Kansas City marched the other way, relying heavily on Worthy, who touched the ball four times on the drive. The first-round pick finished it off with an 8-yard reception, giving him a season high for receiving yards and his eighth touchdown of the year. The teams matched fourth-quarter field goals, and the Texans took over trailing 27-19 with just over five minutes to go. But the Chiefs forced a three-and-out, getting a sack from Josh Williams on a cornerback blitz, and ran out the clock from there. “This was a great test versus a really good playoff team,” Ryans said. “This was a playoff atmosphere here today. I thought our guys battled the right way. We just have to finish.” Taylor time Pop star Taylor Swift was on hand for the Chiefs' regular-season finale. She has been spending more time with her boyfriend, Chiefs tight end Travis Kelce, in Kansas City since she wrapped up her Eras Tour on Dec. 8 in Vancouver, British Columbia, including making a surprise visit to Children's Mercy Hospital.

                "content": "There has been only one team to win 16 regular-season games. That was the 2007 New England Patriots. If the Kansas City Chiefs match the 2007 Patriots, it won’t carry the same weight. They are playing 17 games, not the 16 that was the NFL norm for years. But they might be on their way to a 16-1 record. So much attention has been paid to how the Chiefs win that them winning almost every week has been overshadowed. The Chiefs improved to 14-1 this season and are closing in on getting the AFC’s No. 1 seed after a 27-19 win over the Houston Texans on Saturday. It was the 16th straight win for the Chiefs in one-score games, extending their NFL record streak. It wasn’t a particularly dominant performance but it had a familiar result. The Chiefs have won in strange and sometimes unbelievable ways. They’ve rarely blown anyone out this season. But they keep winning, and might end up with as many regular-season wins as any team in NFL history. Since the Chiefs were playing, it wasn’t a surprise that it was a close game. Kansas City struck first. Patrick Mahomes suffered what was described as a mild high ankle sprain last week, and there was a brief concern over his availability for this weekend’s game, but Mahomes played and had some nice runs early. His 15-yard touchdown run opened up the scoring. MAHOMES TAKES IT HIMSELF FOR THE TD 🔥📺: #HOUvsKC on NBC/Peacock📱: Stream on #NFLPlus pic.twitter.com/soKpySTT8L — NFL (@NFL) December 21, 2024 The Texans battled back. QB C.J. Stroud had a nice touchdown pass across his body to tight end Dalton Schultz. He also had a 30-yard touchdown pass to Tank Dell but it was costly. Houston receiver Jared Wayne dove for the deep pass and inadvertently dove into Dell’s knee. It was immediately clear Dell had suffered a serious injury. He was carted off while his teammates were emotional. Stroud was in tears and had to be consoled by teammates. That injury seemed to understandably affect the Texans. They missed the extra point right after the Dell touchdown. The Chiefs drove on their defense, with Xavier Worthy catching a touchdown pass to extend Kansas City’s lead to 24-16. The Chiefs are hard enough to beat in ideal conditions. The Texans missing one of their best receivers, and worried about him as he left the field on a cart, didn’t help them. Houston didn’t score a touchdown after Dell’s injury. Clearly, the Chiefs have an edge in close games. The second half on Saturday looked like a lot of other Kansas City games. In the fourth quarter, the Chiefs had a 14-play drive that took 6:33 off the clock. It ended with a field goal, but that kept the pressure on the Texans to be perfect. Houston couldn’t come up with its own long drive after that. Trailing 27-19, Stroud was sacked on third down and the Texans punted. Mahomes hit Samaje Perine for a big conversion on third-and-4 to chew up more clock. Kareem Hunt had a first-down run after the two-minute warning to seal it. The Chiefs have an 89% chance of getting the No. 1 seed after the win, NBC said on its broadcast. They’ll clinch the top seed with a win at the Steelers on Christmas Day next week. A 15-1 Chiefs team wouldn’t have anything to play for in Week 18 and could sit some players. But a 15-2 regular season, coming off back-to-back Super Bowls, would be remarkable. As time goes on, how the Chiefs piled up all those wins will be forgotten. It will just be viewed as another dominant Chiefs team, which is perhaps on its way to a historic championship. A 20-yard run by Hunt gives the Chiefs the first down and ends any chance for a Houston comeback. The Texans are out of timeouts and Patrick Mahomes runs out the clock with two kneel downs. Kansas City improved to 13-1 and will finish the season undefeated at home (8-0), while the Texans fall to 9-6.

                "content": "The Kansas City Chiefs came into Week 16 with concerns about how quarterback Patrick Mahomes would look after suffering a \"mild\" high-ankle sprain in the team's Week 15 win over the Cleveland Browns. Mahomes quickly put those worries to bed in Kansas City's 27-19 victory over the Houston Texans. He showed he was healthy by scrambling for 27 yards and a touchdown on two carries on Kansas City's open drive and never looked back. Mahomes finished the day going 28-of-41 for 260 yards and a touchdown. He connected well with Marquise \"Hollywood\" Brown (five catches, 45 yards) in his team debut while also continuing to see his chemistry with rookie Xavier Worthy (seven catches, 65 yards, one touchdown) grow. As a result, the Chiefs now need to win just once more to clinch the AFC's No. 1 seed. They can also clinch the top seed if the Buffalo Bills lose any of their final three games. The Texans had a fighting chance in this one-score loss, and it appeared they had changed the momentum when C.J. Stroud hit Tank Dell for a 30-yard touchdown to cut the Chiefs' lead to 17-16 early in the third quarter. NFL STATS CENTRAL: The latest NFL scores, schedules, odds, stats and more. However, Dell suffered a gruesome-looking knee injury on the play. He had to be carted off the field in an air cast, which left many Texans players emotional. After the injury and delay, Ka'imi Fairbairn missed an extra point, which set the tone for the rest of the game. The Dell injury took the wind out Houston's sails offensively and the team simply couldn't overcome the loss of its No. 2 receiver across from Nico Collins. The Texans scored just three more points and dropped to 9-6, positioning the AFC South winner as the likely No. 4 seed in the AFC playoff picture. USA TODAY Sports provided live updates, highlights and more from the Chiefs-Texans Saturday matchup below. On the first play after the two-minute warning, Hunt runs up the middle for 13 yards. The Chiefs can kneel on it from here and earn their 14th win of the 2024 NFL season. The Chiefs got a key sack of C.J. Stroud on a third-and-11 after Kansas City's field goal drive. Joshua Williams came on a cornerback blitz and nobody picked him up, forcing the Texans to punt with just 3:41 left in regulation. Houston has just two timeouts and the two-minute warning left to stop the clock. With a couple of first downs, the Chiefs may be able to run the clock out on this game. The Chiefs re-extended their lead to eight points after Harrison Butker made a chip-shot, 27-yard field goal to cap off a 14-play, 6:33 drive. The Texans got a much-needed stop on third-and-5 when Patrick Mahomes launched a pass toward Kelce in the back of the end-zone. Worthy flashed in front of the tight end, along with a defender, and went for the ball, assuming it was intended for him. The rookie couldn't make the catch and denied Kelce a chance at grabbing it. In fairness to Worthy, the defender may have been able to knock the ball down anyway, as Mahomes' pass came in on a low trajectory. Either way, Kansas City leads 27-19 with 5:13 left in the fourth quarter. The Texans had a golden opportunity in the red zone, but constant pressure from the Chiefs defense and a delay of game penalty pushed Houston to attempt a Ka'imi Fairbairn field goal. That pushed the Texans to within a touchdown, 24-19. Xavier Worthy accounted for 46 yards of offense on Kansas City's scoring drive, and he capped it off with a touchdown grab from the arm of Patrick Mahomes. Mahomes is 21-of-31 passing for 190 yards and two touchdowns on the day as the Chiefs extend their lead to 24-16 with 2:42 left in the third quarter. The Texans wide receiver was eventually taken off the field in a medical cart after his injury. The Texans would confirm that Dell suffered an injury to his left knee. Play resumed at Arrowhead Stadium after Dell received several minutes of medical attention on the field. He was stretchered off in an air cast after getting hurt on the Texans' touchdown after suffering a serious-looking knee injury. The Texans were shaken up after the injury, with several players showing emotion in its wake. It isn't clear if that had an impact on Fairbairn, but the veteran kicker missed his first extra point attempt of the season following the delay. As a result, the Chiefs still lead 17-16. The NBC broadcast cut back to Arrowhead Stadium to show Dell still down and being tended to on the field, with a cart out of the locker room. The cameras then showed a clearly emotional Stroud, who was among the players gathered around Dell. The good news for the Texans: C.J. Stroud hit Dell on a perfectly thrown 30-yard touchdown pass. The bad news: Dell was hit by his teammate while making the catch and suffered an apparent leg injury during the play. Dell immediately reached for his leg after the play. The Texans medical staff immediately came out to tend to him on the field. The Texans defense got off to a good start in the second half. They limited the Chiefs to five plays on their first drive before forcing Mahomes into a third-and-long. The quarterback tried to get the ball to Xavier Worthy, but Lassiter broke up the pass after undercutting the route. Tank Dell had a nice return of Matt Araiza's punt and that gave the Texans great starting field position around midfield. The Chiefs' mascot is a wolf known as KC Wolf. He was introduced in 1989 and \"has been bringing energy and excitement, as well as laughs and smiles to audiences of all ages,\" according to the team's official website. Houston's offense has moved the ball well against Kansas City's defense, but the team has been guilty of plenty of negative plays. That includes two interceptions and a few negative-yardage runs and screen pass efforts. Below is a look at the Texans' notable first-half stats: Patrick Mahomes is spreading the ball around as usual in the Chiefs' Week 16 game against the Texans, but it's becoming clear that Hollywood Brown is going to be one of his favorite targets now that the veteran is back from an injured collarbone. Below is a look at the Chiefs' notable first-half stats: The back-and-forth first half between the Chiefs and Texans came to an end after a C.J. Stroud Hail Mary attempt was knocked down at the goal line. Kansas City has gotten a strong showing from Patrick Mahomes, who is showing no signs of the ankle injury he dealt with leading up to the Week 16 contest. He has completed 13-of-20 passes for 127 yards while adding a touchdown and 27 yards on the ground. Meanwhile, Stroud has been shakier, making some big passing plays, including a 10-yard touchdown to Dalton Schultz, but has also tossed two interceptions. The Chiefs are set to get the ball first after halftime. They scored 10 unanswered points to close the half. After missing a 29-yard field goal on his lone attempt last week, Butker makes his first attempt in Week 16 from 44 yards away. That gives the Chiefs the lead with 19 seconds left in the half. The Texans were facing a third-and-20 on the edge of field goal range when Stroud tried to force a pass amid pressure. The result? Stroud hit Trent McDuffie over the middle of the field, and that allowed Chiefs to get the ball back with just under a minute left in the half. The Chiefs are back on top after an easy score for Hunt. The veteran back entered the game on a first-and-goal and patiently waited for the Chiefs' interior offensive line to open a lane for him to the end-zone. It developed, he saw it and powered through the final yard to put the Chiefs up 14-10. Kansas City's go-ahead drive covered 82 yards and was 13 plays long. The Chiefs converted four third downs on the drive and will now look to protect a lead with 4:38 left until halftime. No, Brown's first name is still Marquise. He just prefers to go by his nickname \"Hollywood,\" which most broadcasts are now doing. Brown grew up in Hollywood, Fla., which is how he earned the nickname. It lends itself well to him given his origins and his flashy, speedy style of play when healthy. A strange play just unfolded in Saturday's Chiefs vs. Texans game. Houston pressured Patrick Mahomes and appeared to force the quarterback to fumble. The Texans picked up the ball and brought it all the way to the end zone for a touchdown. However, the play was later ruled an incomplete pass just before Derek Barnett was called for roughing the passer. As such, the Chiefs avoided a third-and-10 and took the ball across midfield while the Texans were denied a chance to go up by two scores. Mahomes had been sacked 35 times entering Week 16. That is easily the most he has ever been sacked in a single season, seven more than his previous career high of 28 in 2021. Stroud faced pressure from George Karlaftis on a first-and-goal from the 10-yard line but scrambled out to his right to create time to throw. Eventually, he found Schultz wide open in the middle of the field and lofted a pass to him for an easy completion. The Kansas City crowd jeered the officials for choosing not to flag what it believed was a holding call against the Texans on Karlaftis. Ka'imi Fairbairn converted on the extra point to give the Texans a 10-7 lead. Kansas City may be leading after 15 minutes, but Houston is driving and nearing scoring range. Nico Collins caught a 32-yard pass to close the quarter after winning quickly off the line of scrimmage and forcing the Chiefs defensive back to chase him down along the sidelines. C.J. Stroud is 7-of-11 for 74 yards in the early goings of the game, though he did throw an interception on a first-drive overthrow. His counterpart, Patrick Mahomes, has gone an efficient 6-of-7 for 38 yards but also has run for 27 yards and a touchdown, showing that his injured ankle isn't much of a concern at all. The Texans were able to pressure and sack Mahomes on their second defensive drive, something they couldn't do their first time playing defense. They will need to continuing doing that to keep Kansas City's offense out of rhythm. Mahomes has been sacked more during the 2024 NFL season than he has at any point during his career. He took another one on the team's second drive when Harris came on a blitz and dropped the Chiefs quarterback. Mahomes got up just fine after the hit, which was notable given his injury. The loss pushed the team back into a third-and-long, however, and Kansas City was forced to punt the ball back to the Texans after failing to convert that. The Chiefs lost to the Buffalo Bills 30-21 in a Week 11 during which Josh Allen racked up 317 yards and two touchdowns. That marks Kansas City's only defeat of the 2024 NFL season through 15 weeks. C.J. Stroud and the Houston offense mounted a good response to Kansas City's touchdown drive, as Nico Collins, Tank Dell and Joe Mixon ripped off some big plays to get the Texans into the red zone. Ultimately, they stalled out and Ka'imi Fairbairn came on to attempt a 33-yard field goal. Fairbairn made the chip-shot to get the Texans on the board and make it 7-3 Chiefs. How healthy is Mahomes' injured ankle? The Chiefs quarterback isn't as fast as he has usually is, but he also showed that fans shouldn't be overly concerned about his mobility being impacted by his \"mild\" high-ankle sprain. Mahomes ran for 12 yards on a third-and-13 earlier in the drive before taking off from the 15-yard line later to score a touchdown on a run up the middle. Mahomes now has 27 rushing yards in the first quarter of the game. That's already the fourth-most he has recorded in a single game this season. The Texans faced a third-and-12 on their first drive and Stroud tried to force a downfield shot to Collins in double coverage. Rookie Jaden Hicks caught the overthrown pass and set Kansas City up with great field position on its first drive of the day. Houston's first drive is off to an inauspicious start, as starting right guard Mason was hurt just four plays into it. He walked off the field under his own power but headed for the blue medical tent. The Texans were already without starting left guard Juice Scruggs and will be forced to put either Kenyon Green or Kendrick Green into action. The Chiefs and Texans are scheduled for kick off on Saturday at 1 p.m. ET, noon CT. NBC will broadcast the Chiefs-Texans matchup in Week 16.

Carson Wentz is the Chiefs' backup quarterback for the 2024 NFL season. The former Philadelphia Eagles star signed a one-year deal with the Chiefs during the offseason to take on that role after playing behind Matthew Stafford with the Los Angeles Rams in the second half of the 2023 NFL season. On Thursday, head coach Andy Reid told reporters he expected his quarterback to make the start. That turned out to be true, as Mahomes will to start vs. the Houston. Patrick Mahomes and Marquise \"Hollywood\" Brown will both play vs. the Texans today. Mahomes avoids missing a game due to injury, while Brown is making his season debut.

                "content": "The two biggest plays of the game were made by the Ravens defense on plays you could call mistakes by Russell Wilson. He went 22/33 for 217 yards and two TDs but this pick six by Marlon Humphery shut the door on the Steelers. The Ravens are now tied at 10-5 with Steelers at the top of the AFC North, but Pittsburgh still holds the slight tiebreaker which means if they win out they win the division. They have the Chiefs on Christmas Day and the Bengals in the final week of the season. The Ravens have the Texans and the Browns to close out the season. Should Pittsburgh lose a game and Baltimore win out, the Ravens would take the division title. Just when it looked like the Ravens were going to put the game out of reach, the Steelers defense did what the Steelers defense does. They came up with a play that kept the team in the game, this time it was Minkah Fitzpatrick who made the red zone pick, but the joy would be short lived. Derrick Henry was a monster all game long. He usually gets stronger as the game goes on, but he started off on fire and never cooled down. This 44 yard run was his longest on a night that he went for 162 yards on 24 carries. Jackson and the Ravens punched back just six plays later with Jackson's third TD toss of the night. This one went to Mark Andrews in the back of the end zone. Jackson has thrown eight TD passes in the last two games, and he went 15/23 for 207 yards and 3 TDs with just one pick in the win. the Steelers weren't done. The tied the game up midway through the third quarter after a 44 yard completion from Wilson to Calvin Austin III set up this TD pass for Cordarrelle Patterson. This was a heavyweight battle and both teams were exchanging blows for the first three quarters. After the fumble the Ravens went 95 yards down the field and took the lead in a 14 point swing as Jackson found Rachod Bateman in the end zone to put BAL back in the lead. There was a lot of talk about Lamar Jackson not being able to beat the Steelers, but he came out with a point to prove against Pittsburgh with the division title on the line. Coming into the night we thought the Steelers had the defense that made the big, game changing plays but I don't know if anyone thought it would the Ravens were going to win this game with their defensive plays. The first one came on this Wilson scramble that looked like it could go for a TD but Ar'Darius Washington forced fumble that was recovered by Kyle Van Noy. The Steelers were driving to take the lead, but the Ravens not only kept them out of the end zone but kept them off the board. The Steelers went three and out on their first drive, but they bounced back with a balanced attack of Jaylen Warren running the football and Russell Wilson connecting on a handful of passes. Wilson found MyCole Pruitt in the back of the end zone to tie the game up with the first play of the second quarter. The Baltimore Ravens knew they needed to beat the Pittsburgh Steelers if they were going to have a chance to win the AFC North, and they got the job done to set up an interesting end of the season for these two teams. Lamar Jackson had a hat trick of touchdown passes to lead his team to the biggest win of the season. Jackson had five TD passes against the New York Giants last week, and picked up right where he left off today in Baltimore. The Ravens got Derrick Henry going early and that set up the pass game for Lamar Jackson. The two time MVP hit Isaiah Likely for the first score of the game. The Ravens join the Steelers at 10-5 at the top of the AFC North. The Ravens are going to kneel out the clock and Baltimore is going to win this huge AFC North showdown. Wilson is rushed out of the pocket and is forced to throw it away. 4th and 13 and the Steelers will punt with under 2:00 to go. WE ARE AT THE TWO MINUTE WARNING FROM BALTIMORE!!!

Lamar Jackson and the Ravens start the ball from the 30 to begin the game. Coming into Week 16 we see the Chiefs at the top of the AFC, currently in the top spot for the one seed and home field advantage. They have some tough games coming up, and if they slip the Bills will be waiting, but it’s unlikely a one loss team losses multiple games in the next few weeks. That means the these two teams will likely be putting all their energy on winning the AFC North and earning home field advantage in at least one game in the playoffs. The Steelers have already clinched a playoff spot with 10 wins, while the Ravens can do that today with a win. Should they lose there is a miniscule chance they don’t make the playoffs but they would have to lose out and the Dolphins or Colts would have to win out. So basically these two teams are in, but both of these teams are desperate to win the division. That means they will have to win today in Baltimore. It was an old school, rock ‘em sock ‘em AFC North game filled with defense, big hits and not much scoring. The Steelers held Lamar Jackson to just 207 yards 1 TD and 1 INT and Derrick Henry to just 65 yards on 13 carries as the then top rated offense scored just 16 points. The Steelers offense didn’t do much better, but the six Chris Boswell field goals were enough to hold off the Ravens. As always the Steelers defense came up with some huge plays including a 4th quarter interception and a two point conversion stand after the Ravens scored a late TD that could have tied the game had they converted the two point conversion. The Steelers stars have been and still are on the defensive side of the ball. This team has lived and died on the defenses ability to shut the other team down and make the occasional big play that would change the game around. No one is more responsible for that than TJ Watt, who gave Steelers fans a big scare last week when he went down late in the game with an ankle injury. After being limited in practice early in the week he participated fully in practice on Thursday and he is good to go today. That will be a huge boost to this defense today against the reigning MVP of the league. TJ Watt has 54 tackles, 11.5 sacks and is the heart and soul of this defense that has had Lamar Jackson’s number over the last few years. Lamar Jackson is the most explosive player in the league. With the ability to beat you with his legs or his arm, he constantly keeps defenses on edge, except when he plays against the Steelers. He is 2-5 against the Steelers in his career, and they have a history of being able to slow down the two time MVP of the league. This year, he has thrown for 3,580 yards (5th in the NFL), 34 TDs (2nd) and just 3 INTs (T-1st) and as another 743 yards rushing with three TDs on the ground. It looks as though Jackson is going to come up a little shy of being the first QB to throw for 4,000 yards and run for 1,000 yards in the same season, but he is still well in the MVP race. He will be much more interested in winning the remaining three games of the season and taking the Ravens back to the Super Bowl. This was supposed to be the year the Ravens made a deep playoff run and challenged the Chiefs for AFC supremacy. They got their chance at the Chiefs in the first week of the season and lost that game by a toe. Then they inexplicably blew a double digit second half lead against the Raiders before straightening the ship and winning the next five games. The Browns stunned them in Cleveland and the Ravens would lose three of their next six before their BYE week. Their win over the Giants puts them in position to win the AFC North, but they know they have to win this game after losing to the Steelers earlier in the year. After years of having the defense carry the load for a team that could barley move the ball on offense, Pittsburgh went out and signed two veteran QBs in a matter of days. Russell Wilson was hurt for the start of the season which meant Justin Fields started the season under center for the Steelers. Pittsburgh went 4-2 in his time, but the offensive problems persisted. Coach Mike Tomlin made the change in Week 7, starting Russell Wilson and boom, the Steelers put up 37 points against the Jets and then won their next three games including a a low scoring win against the Ravens in Pittsburgh. Their momentum was halted on a snowy night in Cleveland, but they bounced back scoring 44 points in a win over the Bengals and then exacted revenge on the Browns the week before last. The game in Philly was ugly, but they have a chance to silence some of the doubters who still might not be completely convinced by the offense. The Ravens came out of their BYE week in perfect circumstances. They got some much needed rest, and had a trip to New York for a match up with the Giants to get the “warmed up” for the rest of the season. Lamar Jackson went wild, throwing for 290 yards and 5 TDs to thrust his name right back into the MVP conversation. The Giants, who had Tim Boyle and Tommy DeVito in under center had no chance as the Ravens built up a 21-0 lead on a day that Derrick Henry had a light work load. The Ravens would wax the Giants, 35-14 and keep within a game of the Steelers to set up today’s massive matchup in Baltimore. The Steelers gauntlet of a schedule to end the season started last week in Philadelphia. The Eagles controlled the game from start to finish on a day that Pittsburgh only gained 163 yards of total offense. Despite their offensive troubles they were still in the game at halftime after a couple field goals and a TD pass from Russell Wilson to Pat Freiermuth sent the Steelers to half-time down 17-13. Philly dominated the second half, controlling the ball for 24 of the 30 minutes, holding the Steelers to just 54 yards on 11 plays and stretching their lead out to 27-13 after a field goal and a tush push from Jalen Hurts. Hurts had almost 300 yards, two TDs and another rushing TD while Russell Wilson had just 128 yards on 14/22 passing. Hello everyone and welcome to M&T Bank Stadium where the Ravens know they can take a big step towards winning the division with a win today. If they lose it will be almost impossible, and they will be forced to go on the road for each of their playoff games once the postseason comes rolling around. They are coming off one of their best performances of the year last week and the Ravens will look to keep it rolling against a Steelers team that have lost two of their last four games. They are in the midst of a brutal end of the season that could see them go from competing for a one seed in the AFC to the Wild Card spot if they aren’t careful. Needless to say, this one is a big one. Both of these teams know they will be in the playoffs but the question is who will win the division and earn the right to host at least one postseason game. There is going to be a playoff atmosphere this afternoon in Baltimore as two teams who are headed to the postseason will be fighting for the division from M&T Bank Stadium. The Pittsburgh Steelers lead the AFC North by just a game but the Baltimore Ravens have a chance to draw level with them with a win in this massive Saturday afternoon kickoff.

                "content": "It's a procrastinator's time of year. As we tick down into the final weeks of 2024, it's all about last-minute holiday shopping, making last-minute plans and trying to make good on those resolutions before the year calendar flips. In the NFL, it's about making those last-minute playoff pushes. The Ravens were feeling the pressure Saturday in Baltimore as they try to track down the AFC North crown. The Steelers came ready to celebrate, but the champagne remains on ice in Pittsburgh until further notice. The Ravens were 34-17 winners Week 16, finally beating their hated rivals for the first time in two years. As a result, they moved into a tie atop the division with just two weeks to go. While the margin of victory indicates a lopsided affair, this was close throughout before a chaotic sequence changed the game early in the fourth quarter. There were multiple turnovers, a head-scratching decision from Pittsburgh to go for it on fourth down, and much more packed into just a few minutes. The Ravens will want to clean up their game going forward, but they'll feel good after getting this win. With a quick turnaround looming, Baltimore is traveling to Houston for a Christmas showdown with the Texans, so there's no time to celebrate. NFL STATS CENTRAL: The latest NFL scores, schedules, odds, stats and more. Derrick Henry was a machine on the ground, once again, finishing with 162 yards on 24 carries. As for Lamar Jackson, he shook off some of his struggles against Pittsburgh, turning in a solid performance and avoiding big mistakes, aside from the unfortunate interception. Tiebreakers will come into focus now, but there is plenty of work to be done before these teams head to the postseason. At the very least, they'll each have a seat at the table. Here's a look at how the action unfolded on Saturday. NFL MVP RANKINGS:Josh Allen is shining brighter than Lamar Jackson, Jared Goff There are 12 tiebreakers to determine a division winner if two teams are tied in the NFL. Here they are, according to NFL.com: While the Steelers and Ravens split their two meetings, they also own the same record within the division. That moves us to the third tiebreaker, common opponents, which is where the Steelers have the edge right now. Pittsburgh also owns the conference record tiebreaker. The race is not over with two games to go, but it is still an uphill battle from here for the Ravens. And, just like that, this one is over. The Ravens are headed back to the playoffs thanks to their win over the Steelers. A 17-point win for the hosts doesn't indicate just how close it was, but Pittsburgh now finds itself in a battle for the AFC North crown with just two weeks to go. Both teams will be back in action on Christmas. At this point in the game, the clock is all that matters. Baltimore was able to eat 6:09 off the clock and cap off the long drive with a 23-yard field goal from Tucker to extend the lead to 17. Ravens 34, Steelers 17 Flowers has been fairly quiet today, but that doesn't mean he hasn't been productive. The receiver just had a 49-yard catch-and-run, giving him 100 yards on the evening. He's brought in five catches on eight targets, but this one gives Baltimore the chance to take some more time off the clock. \"Anything you can do, I can do better.\" While we don't know if Russell Wilson actually said that, the throw to Marlon Humphrey told the whole story there. After being gifted an interception from Jackson, Wilson, like many others on Dec. 26, opted to return the favor.\" Humphrey scampers 37 yards for the touchdown, giving Baltimore a 14-point lead. Ravens 31, Steelers 17 Jackson's history against the Steelers is well-documented by now and none of it is particularly good. He isn't doing anything to silence those critics with this interception, as he floats one into the arms of Minkah Fitzpatrick. The Steelers take over with a chance to right their previous wrong. The Steelers get the fourth quarter started by going for it on fourth down near midfield, for some reason. Wilson chucks up a 50-50 ball for Calvin Austin III, which falls incomplete. Head-scratching move there in a close game. Well, that didn't take long. The Steelers' kickoff went out of bounds, giving the Ravens great starting field position on their drive. Six plays and 60 yards later, Mark Andrews is celebrating in the end zone as Baltimore reclaims the lead. Ravens 24, Steelers 17 No, your eyes were not failing you. That was actually Patterson catching that touchdown. The wide receiver turned running back now looks like he's built like a tight end, but it doesn't matter. Touchdowns count the same for all the positions. Wilson lofted one up for Patterson out of the backfield, who comes down with it in the end zone with the game-tying touchdown. Again, we're right back to where we started. New game in Baltimore! Ravens 17, Steelers 17 After an uneventful start to the half, Russell Wilson chucks one up for Austin down the sideline, who somehow comes down in bounds for the 44-yard gain. You'll want to get a look at this one. Pittsburgh's momentum didn't carry over to start the second half, as they pick up just six yards before punting it away. Now the Ravens have the chance to extend their lead, once again. As we get set to start the second half, the field goal fest at the end of the half brings back memories. Tucker's 2024 struggles have been well-documented, but let's not forget this is the same guy who holds the record for the longest field goal in NFL history. He famously converted from 66 yards out in 2021 to defeat the Lions in Detroit. There have been attempts to break the record, notoriously by the Cowboys' Brandon Aubrey's 70-yard attempt in Week 15, but they fell short or drifted wide. Boswell saw Tucker's 51-yard try and decided to match it, converting the attempt to bring the gap back to seven. It's halftime in Baltimore and the Steelers get the ball to start the second half. Another close game between these two bitter rivals means we should be in for treat when the second half kicks off. Ravens 17, Steelers 10 The Baltimore faithful are in a celebratory mood after Tucker knocks through a field goal from 51 yards out. The kicker has experienced plenty of struggles in 2024, but they weren't visible on this play as the Ravens lead grows to 10 right before the halftime break. Pittsburgh will have a chance to respond with a two-minute drive of their own. Ravens 17, Steelers 7 Baltimore is trying to build on their seven-point lead just before halftime. They're set up at around the Pittsburgh 34, which should be in Justin Tucker's field goal range. Baltimore cashed in on the Wilson fumble, driving 96 yards and taking only eight plays to do it before Bateman hauls in the touchdown pass from Lamar Jackson. The 14-yard connection caps off a drive that took only 3:29 off the clock. It's Bateman's third touchdown in the last two games and his fifth in the last six. Ravens 14, Steelers 7 Hill has been quickly ruled out with a concussion. He picked up 25 yards on a big run after the fumble, but the play ended with the running back being injured after his head slammed into the field. Hill was able to get up and walk off the field, but it's never a good sign to be ruled out almost instantly. He will now be subjected to the league's concussion protocol. Wilson and the Steelers have been in a groove ever since their touchdown drive, but that'll have to be put on the back burner. The quarterback turned back the clock, rumbling for a 20-yard gain to set his team up with a first-and-goal, but coughed up the ball. Unlike the Ravens, the Steelers can't recover. Baltimore takes over and the Pittsburgh drive ends in disappointing fashion. Given the early results, the players might want to try some new gloves to avoid fumbling. If you were wondering how the Ravens would respond to the Steelers' touchdown, well, it wasn't good. A penalty, drop and incomplete pass aren't in the recipe for success and a shanked punt definitely isn't either. Stout's 14-yard punt gives the Steelers great starting field position in what is another ode to the AFC North's ugly style of play. Steelers' OC Arthur Smith is getting frisky around the holidays, opting for a pass on first down at the one. It's a move that goes against the brand of the former Falcons' head coach, but results in a touchdown for Pruitt, who gets Pittsburgh on the board. Any port in a storm will do and we're right back to where we started with a tie game. Ravens 7, Steelers 7 A fast-paced opening 15 minutes comes to a close with the Ravens on top. It might not be for long, however, after a Fox pays the bills with some commercials. When we return, Pittsburgh is set up nicely with a first-and-goal at the one. They've responded nicely, traveling 72 yards with nine plays. Drive No. 2 ends in much better fashion for the Ravens, as Likely finds the end zone from nine yards out. The tight end slipped out, uncovered, for the easy score. Ravens 7, Steelers 0 The Steelers cornerback walked off the field under his own power after being steamrolled by Derrick Henry. It is a calf injury for Porter and he is questionable to return. UPDATE: Porter has been ruled out with a calf injury. Pittsburgh didn't fare much better than Baltimore, as the Steelers' drive ends without incident. A quick three plays leads to a punt, which also nearly ends with a turnover. Butterfingers are typically considered a Halloween candy, but Baltimore brought them to the game today. Two fumbles in the early going, but they've fallen on both. Lamar Jackson and company go back to work at the Steelers' 41. A promising opening drive quickly stalled for the Ravens. Lamar Jackson nearly fumbled, but Baltimore avoided disaster and had to kick it away. It's downed at the Steelers' three-yard line, giving Russell Wilson some bad starting field position. The Ravens vs. Steelers game will begin at 4:30 p.m. ET on Saturday. It will be the second of the NFL’s two games to kick off during the afternoon game slate.

Fubo carries NBC, as well as CBS, FOX, NFL Network and the ESPN family of networks, meaning you can catch NFL action through the remainder of the season. The Steelers have already clinched a playoff berth, but with a win over the Ravens, Pittsburgh would clinch the AFC North title. That would guarantee the Steelers a top four seed in the playoffs. A loss would tie the Steelers in the standings with the Ravens. The two also would have identical division records in the case of a Baltimore win and a 5-2 record in common, non-divisional games. Pittsburgh would remain ahead in the division race because of its superior record against AFC opponents, but it would be by a thin margin. Either way, the Steelers have the inside track to the AFC North title and, most likely, the No. 3 seed in the AFC. The Ravens haven’t yet clinched a playoff berth but can do so with a win over the Steelers. They can also guarantee passage to the postseason as a wild card with a loss and losses (or ties) by the Dolphins and Colts. Baltimore is tracking to be the No. 5 seed if it makes the postseason. However, a win would give it a shot to catch Pittsburgh in the division race. The Steelers own a head-to-head tiebreaker over the Ravens at present, so Lamar Jackson and Co. must win in Week 16 to stay in the division race. The Ravens are favorites to defeat the Steelers, according to the BetMGM NFL odds. The Ravens excused Johnson from practice ahead of Week 16. This came after he was suspended in Week 15 for refusing to enter Baltimore’s Week 13 loss to the Philadelphia Eagles. That led to the Ravens waiving him prior to their Week 16 matchup vs. the Steelers. The team acquired him in pre-deadline trade with the Carolina Panthers, who acquired the free-agent-to-be during the offseason from the Steelers. As a result, Johnson, a former Steeler, will not get a chance to face his former team. Jackson has struggled during his career against Pittsburgh. The two-time MVP has just a 2-5 record against them in seven contests. That includes an 18-16 loss to the Steelers earlier in the 2024 NFL season. The weather is supposed to be a little chilly for Baltimore’s home game against the Steelers. Temperatures will peak at 38 degrees while winds between 10-20 mph will blow throughout the day. There is only a 3% chance of precipitation during Saturday’s game. As such, the wind will be the greatest obstacle for kickers and quarterbacks alike to overcome in the Week 16 matchup. The Steelers are tied with the New England Patriots for the most Super Bowl wins with six. Pittsburgh and Dallas have the unique distinction of playing each other more than any other team combination in Super Bowl history with three matchups. Here's how the 2025 NFL draft order shakes out after the Week 16 edition of \"Thursday Night Football,\" according to Tankathon.com: Fox will broadcast the second NFL game on Saturday after NBC and Peacock were granted the rights to the Chiefs-Texans game. Fox’s No. 1 broadcast team – play-by-play announcer Kevin Burkhardt and game analyst Tom Brady – will be on the call for the AFC North rivalry. The duo will be joined by Erin Andrews and Tom Rinaldi on the sidelines for the star-studded affair.

                "content": "If not listed, please contact your TV provider. BALTIMORE (AP) Lamar Jackson was solid in Baltimore's biggest game of the season so far. Then, after one of the star quarterback's rare slip-ups, one of his teammates delivered the play of the day. Jackson threw three touchdown passes and Marlon Humphrey scored on a fourth-quarter interception return to help the Ravens pull even with Pittsburgh atop the AFC North with a 34-17 victory over the Steelers on Saturday. Pittsburgh (10-5) would have clinched the division with a victory, but now the teams are deadlocked after the Ravens (10-5) won for just the second time in the last 10 games in this series. Baltimore clinched a playoff berth. The Steelers had already done so. “It was cool to get a pick-6, but clinching a spot in the playoffs, to beat the Steelers, I'm just happy that the guys came in, put in the work, and we just took care of business,” Humphrey said. “I felt that this team has had our number over the years. Just take care of business, man. I felt like the performance we put on wasn't perfect, but I felt like that's what we were supposed to do.” Russell Wilson threw two touchdown passes, the second of which tied the game at 17 with 5:14 left in the third quarter. Jackson answered with a 7-yard scoring strike to Mark Andrews, and after Pittsburgh turned the ball over on downs, a 44-yard run by Derrick Henry put the Ravens in the red zone. That drive came to nothing when Jackson was intercepted for just the fourth time this season, but then Humphrey - who was celebrating the recent birth of his son Duke - picked off Wilson and went 37 yards to the end zone to give Baltimore a cushion in a series that’s been razor-thin of late. The previous nine games between the Steelers and Ravens were decided by seven points or fewer. “My whole family's in town to help out with my wife and everything,” Humphrey said. “I was texting her before. I'm supposed to go pick her up from the hospital, discharge her with the baby. So there's a lot of just great things that happened this week.” Jackson improved to 2-4 against Pittsburgh as a starter. This was his first time facing the Steelers at home since 2020. “I feel like we've been busting our behind all season long, had ups and downs throughout this whole season, but to clinch a playoff against a great team like that, that's great,” Jackson said. “That means we're moving in the right direction.” Henry rushed for 162 yards. Pittsburgh entered the game with a plus-18 margin in turnovers, but the Ravens had the edge in that department Saturday. Baltimore recovered three of its own fumbles and had two big takeaways. “We didn’t control the run game. We never did. When you don’t, you’ve got to do some splash plays or win the turnover battle in a significant way, and we didn’t do that either,” Steelers coach Mike Tomlin said. “There were some balls on the ground that we didn’t get. Then obviously we turned the ball over going in -- it took seven points off the board -- and they had a pick-6. The rest is history, as they say.” Jackson found Isaiah Likely for a 9-yard touchdown to open the scoring. Wilson answered with a 1-yard scoring pass to MyCole Pruitt, and the Steelers appeared poised to take the lead when the veteran quarterback broke loose for a 19-yard run in Baltimore territory. But Ar'Darius Washington delivered a punishing hit on Wilson at the end of that play, jarring the ball loose. Kyle Van Noy recovered for the Ravens at the Baltimore 4. The Ravens then drove 96 yards and took a 14-7 lead on Jackson's 14-yard touchdown toss to Rashod Bateman. Wilson threw a 12-yard TD to Cordarrelle Patterson to tie it in the third. Jackson set a team record with his 37th touchdown pass of the season, and he's now up to a career high of 3,787 yards. Ravens receiver Zay Flowers had five catches for 100 yards, surpassing 1,000 on the season. Henry has exceeded 1,500 yards rushing for the fourth time. He's now up to 1,636, a mark he's only surpassed once - in his 2,027-yard campaign of 2020. Steelers CB Joey Porter Jr. injured his calf, and WR Ben Skowronek hurt his hip. ... Baltimore RB Justice Hill left the game because of a concussion. Both teams play on Christmas Day to wrap up stretches of three games in 11 days.

The Baltimore Ravens captured a playoff berth on Saturday, but they accomplished much more than that after vanquishing their arch rival at home. Baltimore's 34-17 win over Pittsburgh snapped the Ravens' four-game losing streak over the Steelers, who missed an opportunity to clinch their first division title since 2020. Instead, the Ravens now have a chance to steal the AFC North from Pittsburgh during the season's final two weeks. Three touchdown passes by Lamar Jackson (who recorded his first win over the Steelers since 2019), 162 rushing yards from Derrick Henry and two turnovers by Steelers quarterback Russell Wilson were the game's biggest storylines. Baltimore parlayed both of Wilson's turnovers into touchdowns, with Marlon Humphrey's pick-six early in the fourth quarter serving as the game's biggest play. Wilson's first turnover, a fumble after he was hit by safety Ar'Darius Washington deep in Ravens territory, set up Baltimore's go-ahead scoring drive as the Ravens took a 17-10 halftime lead. Pittsburgh tied the game on a Wilson touchdown pass late in the third quarter, but the Ravens responded with 17 unanswered points that included Humphrey's pick-six that made it a two-possession game. Pittsburgh (10-5) has lost two straight games, while Baltimore (10-5) is riding a two-game winning streak following their Week 14 bye. Here's a closer look at how Baltimore got it done. Baltimore's five losses earlier in the year were largely due to self-inflicted wounds. On Saturday, however, the Ravens played cleaner and were able to atone for the mistakes they did make, such as Jackson's interception to Minkah Fitzpatrick that gave the Steelers an opportunity to tie the score. But Humphrey came up with the pick-six two plays later, and Pittsburgh never threatened again. Justin Tucker, who missed two field goals in Baltimore's Week 11 loss in Pittsburgh, made both of his kicks Saturday, which included a 51-yard boot that extended the Ravens' lead to 17-7 in the second quarter. Baltimore's running game was clicking on all cylinders, too. Henry's 75 rushing yards in the first half exceeded his total for the entire game when the Ravens faced the Steelers five weeks ago. Henry looked like former Steelers bulldozer Jerome Bettis as he became the fourth-fastest player in NFL history to reach 11,000 career rushing yards and 100 career touchdown runs. Defensively, the Ravens consistently put pressure on Wilson, especially linebacker Kyle Van Noy, who racked up 1.5 sacks. The unit also came up with two of the game's biggest plays. In Week 11, Pittsburgh feasted on two Baltimore turnovers and two missed field goals by Tucker. On Saturday, the Steelers were unable to recover three Ravens fumbles that included linebacker Alex Highsmith's strip-sack of Jackson on the game's first drive. Tucker, as alluded to earlier, also didn't miss the kicks he missed in Pittsburgh. Defensively, the Steelers were unable to mask the absence of four starters that included three in the secondary. Pittsburgh ruled three defensive starters out prior to kickoff before losing starting cornerback Joey Porter Jr. in the first quarter. For a second straight game, Pittsburgh's offense committed costly turnovers. Last week, it was Najee Harris' fumble with the Steelers in scoring position. On Saturday, it was Wilson's fumble late in the first half as well as his pick-six that essentially ended the game. On both turnovers, Wilson didn't get much help from tight end MyCole Pruitt, who was on the receiving end of Wilson's first touchdown pass (Cordarrelle Patterson caught Wilson's second touchdown). Pruitt didn't make much of an attempt to block Washington before he forced the fumble of Wilson, who was likely expecting Pruitt to block for him. On the pick, Pruitt wasn't in position to catch the ball (he also didn't do a good enough job blocking his defender before going out for the pass), but Wilson is more to blame for what transpired. He would have been better served throwing the ball away as he was under duress. Pittsburgh received an inspired effort from Calvin Austin III, who has stepped up this season as the team's No. 2 receiver. The Steelers' other receivers continue to come up short, though, a fact that is made more glaring with George Pickens' absence as he deals with an injury. The Steelers' running game was solid, but they didn't get nearly enough opportunities. After falling behind early, the Steelers tied the score and were in position to take the lead after getting a short field following a 14-yard punt by Jordan Stout. But Washington's forced fumble of Wilson turned the game on its head; it stopped a sure Steelers scoring drive in its tracks while setting up the Ravens' go-ahead scoring drive. Humphrey's first career pick-six couldn't have come at a better time. The veteran corner read the play before stepping in front of Pruitt and racing to pay dirt. \"It feels good. Any win feels good, especially against a rival like this. Got the little monkey off my back for the time being.\" -- Jackson during his postgame interview with Fox when asked about getting his second career win over Pittsburgh. Both teams have quick turnarounds. Baltimore will travel to face Houston on Christmas Day. The Texans fell to 9-6 on Saturday after losing to the Chiefs in Kansas City. The Steelers will also play on Christmas, hosting Kansas City in a game that will have definite playoff implications. Tucker is now 2 of 2 on field goals today. Ravens two minutes away from clinching a playoff berth. Jackson throws a bomb to Flowers, who bullies Steelers rookie CB Beanie Bishop for a 49-yard gain. Ravens in position to add to their lead. There's still 7 minutes to play, but hard to envision the Ravens blowing this. What a crazy sequence of events. Just after Fitzpatrick's pick, Marlon Humphrey picks off Wilson and runs to pay dirt, giving the Ravens a 30-17 lead with 13:06 left. That one's on Pruitt, who didn't make any attempt at trying to catch the ball. Steelers fans have been waiting for Minkah Fitzpatrick get a turnover. Well, he just did at a very crucial moment. Fitzpatrick picks off Jackson just after the Ravens entered the red zone. Steelers have life after it looked like the Ravens were about to take complete control of the game. Wilson launches it deep to Calvin Austin III, but it never had a chance. Austin wasn't close to the ball and Kyle Hamilton able to get the pass deflection. I don't mind the decision to go for it, but that was a bad play call. Almost looked like they would have been content with the Ravens picking it off. Meanwhile, Henry rips off a 44-yard run on the very next play. Fitzpatrick came in on a blitz but missed him. Steelers, trailing 24-17, are on the other side of the 50 and are facing a fourth down with the fourth quarter about to start. The Steelers initially lined up like they were going for it, now they get some time to talk it over. I'd go for it personally. Defense hasn't played terribly well anyways and Russ has made several clutch throws already. Jackson responds by hitting Mark Andrews for his third TD pass of the night with 1:50 left in the quarter. Ravens had a short field after Chris Boswell's kickoff went out of bounds, giving the Ravens the ball at the 40. Ravens ahead 24-17. High scoring game for Steelers-Ravens. Joey Porter Jr. has been ruled out with a calf injury. It's Cory Trice the rest of the way at corner opposite fellow backup James Pierre. Another big completion to Austin sets up Wilson's TD pass to Cordarrelle Patterson for a game-tying score. Patterson made an incredible catch as he was falling down. Wilson throws his trademark moon ball to Calvin Austin, who reels it in on the far sideline for a 44-yard pickup. Steelers getting close to Boswell's range. Marlon Humphrey down for the Ravens. Looks like he has something in his eye. Elandon Roberts stuffs Henry on third-and-1, forcing the Ravens to punt on their first drive of the second half. Steelers offense needs to possess the ball on this drive. They were killed on time of possession in Philly and a similar situation is unfolding today. They ran the ball just 11 times in the first half despite consistently getting yards on easy carry. The Steelers punt after Wilson settles for a short completion to Jefferson on third down. Warren got nothing on his first down run, which set the tone for the rest of the drive. Score: Ravens 17-10 First downs: Ravens 15-11 Third down: Ravens 2-5, Steelers 2-4 Total yards: Ravens 201-170 Red zone: Ravens 2-2, Steelers 1-1 TOP: Ravens 16:24 Jackson: 8 of 15, 89 yards, 2 TD's, 1 sack Wilson: 12 of 16, 110 yards, 1 TD, 2 sacks Wilson: 27 yards on 3 carries Harris: 23 yards on 4 carries Warren: 25 yards on 4 carries Steelers: 75 yards on 11 carries Henry: 75 yards on 13 carries Flowers: 37 yards on 3 catches Warren: 38 yards on 3 catches Justin Tucker -- who missed two field goals in Pittsburgh in Week 11 -- drills a 51-yard FG to extend the Ravens' lead to 17-7 with 1:43 left until halftime. Things are happening for Ravens today that didn't happen five weeks ago in Pittsburgh. Ravens haven't committed a TO yet (they had two in the first half in Week 11) and are making up for their mistakes with big plays of their own. A few Jackson completions and a punishing run by has Baltimore on Pittsburgh's 34-yard-line at the two-minute warning. Jackson is picking on Trice, who is in for Joey Porter after Porter sustained an injury in the first quarter. Henry is already up to 74 yards, 11 more than he had in Pittsburgh in Week 11. Wilson had Calvin Austin III open underneath on third down, but pressure up the gut by Nnamdi Madubuike forced Wilson to keep the ball. He was ultimately sacked by the veteran Kyle Van Noy, who collected his 10th sack of the campaign. Ravens have the ball and a 14-7 lead with just under six minutes left in the first half. Jackson hits Bateman for a short TD to cap off a 96-yard scoring drive following Wilson's fumble. Jackson taking full advantage of Pittsburgh's injury plagued secondary. Hill is out for the remainder of the game with a head injury. The Ravens are extremely thin at RB now as third string RB Keaton Mitchell is inactive. Jackson hits Flowers for 14 yards, but they tack on another 15 yards after Minkah Fitzpatrick grabbed Flowers' face mask. Hill is down after ripping off a 25-yard run down the near sideline. Hill fell hard on his head after getting tackled by Steelers DB Damontae Kazee, who is filling in for injured DeShon Elliott. Wilson broke free for a nice run, but he fumbled after getting hit by Ravens DB Ar'Darius Washington inside the 10-yard-line. Wilson's toughness is commendable, but he should have slid in that situation instead of going for the score. Turnover ends what was a promising drive for Steelers. Baltimore forced to punt as Jackson was under pressure on that drive. Highsmith forced him to throw high and incomplete on second down. On third down, Jackson was flushed from the pocket and threw an errant pass to Flowers. Things got worse for Baltimore moments later when Jordan Stout shanked a punt that went just 14 yards. Steelers will start at their own 44 early in the second quarter. Wilson hits a wide open MyCole Pruitt for a TD off play-action on the first play of the second quarter. Wilson actually had two teammates open but decided to throw to Pruitt, who has his first TD of the year. An impressive completion from Wilson to Van Jefferson has put Pittsburgh at the Ravens' 1-yard-line with the second quarter about to start. Pittsburgh's offense has quickly found its rhythm, but was a big key if they were going to upset Baltimore. Wilson has made two impressive plays on this drive, and Harris and Warren are making an early impact. Wilson extends the Steelers' second drive after scrambling and hitting WR Ben Skowronek for a first down on third-and-7. Steelers move the chains despite Wilson getting sacked by Michael Pierce two plays earlier. Ravens are applying pressure on Wilson. Jackson throws his 35th TD of the season, this one to TE Isaiah Likley, to take an early lead. Likely was wide open b/c Steelers safety Minkah Fitzpatrick was locked in on RB Derrick Henry, whose punishing runs helped set up the TD. Steelers CB Joey Porter Jr. left the game after tackling Henry just prior to the TD. Baltimore muffed a punt after the Steelers went three and out, but they are able to pounce on the ball. The Steelers have had two golden chances to record the game's first TO but have come up empty both times. Alex Highsmith strip sacked Lamar Jackson, but the Ravens pounced on the fumble. The sack contributed to a Baltimore punt, which was downed inside the 10-yard-line. The Ravens had picked up a pair of first downs to move into Steelers territory. Baltimore started Week 11 matchup with the ball, but fumbled it away, leading to the first of Chris Boswell's six FG's in the Steelers eventual 18-16 win. Pittsburgh obviously wants to win today, but the objective all year has been to make the playoffs and do damage when they get there. The Steelers haven't won a playoff game since 2016 and they are intent on ending that. Tomlin is likely erring on the side of caution today when it comes to his injured players, just like he has all year up to this point. That being said, T.J. Watt is playing after injuring his ankle late last week. © 2004-2024 CBS Interactive. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED. CBS Sports is a registered trademark of CBS Broadcasting Inc.

                "title": "Rickey Henderson - Wikipedia",
                "content": "As coach MLB records Rickey Nelson Henley Henderson (December 25, 1958 – December 20, 2024), nicknamed \"Man of Steal\", was an American professional baseball left fielder who played 25 seasons in Major League Baseball (MLB) for nine teams from 1979 to 2003, including four separate tenures with his original team, the Oakland Athletics. He is widely regarded as baseball's greatest leadoff hitter and baserunner.[1][2] He holds MLB records for career stolen bases, runs, unintentional walks, and leadoff home runs. At the time of his last major league game in 2003, the 10-time American League (AL) All-Star ranked among the sport's top 100 all-time home run hitters and was its all-time leader in walks. In 2009, he was inducted to the Baseball Hall of Fame in his first year of eligibility. Henderson holds the single-season record for stolen bases (130 in 1982) and is the only player in AL history to steal 100 bases in a season, having done so three times (in 1980, 1982, and 1983). His 1,406 career steals is 50% higher than the previous record of 938 by Lou Brock. Henderson is the all-time stolen base leader for the Oakland Athletics[3] and previously held the New York Yankees' franchise record from 1988 to 2011.[4][5] He was among the league's top ten base stealers in 21 different seasons. Henderson was named the AL's Most Valuable Player (MVP) in 1990, and he was twice the lead-off hitter for World Series champions: the 1989 Oakland Athletics and the 1993 Toronto Blue Jays. A 12-time stolen base champion, Henderson led the league in runs five times. His 25-season career elevated him to the top ten in several other categories, including career at-bats, games, and outfield putouts and total chances. His high on-base percentage, power hitting, and stolen base and run totals made him one of the most dominant and innovative players of all time. He was further known for his unquenchable passion for playing baseball and a buoyant, eccentric, and quotable personality that both perplexed and entertained fans. Once asked if he thought Henderson was a future Hall of Famer, statistician Bill James replied, \"If you could split him in two, you'd have two Hall of Famers.\"[6] Henderson was born on December 25, 1958, in Chicago in the back seat of an Oldsmobile on the way to the hospital. Henderson later joked, \"I was already fast. I couldn't wait.\"[7] He was named Rickey Nelson Henley, after singer-actor Ricky Nelson,[8] and is the son of John L. Henley and Bobbie Henley.[8] When he was two years old, his father moved to Oakland, California. Rickey lived with his grandmother in Pine Bluff, Arkansas, from when he was two until he was seven, when he migrated to Oakland with his family. His father died in an automobile accident 10 years after leaving home.[9] His mother married Paul Henderson in Rickey Henley's junior year of high school and the family adopted the Henderson surname.[8] As a child learning to play baseball in Oakland, Rickey Henderson developed the ability to bat right-handed although he was a naturally left-handed thrower—a rare combination for baseball players, especially non-pitchers.[10] In the entire history of Major League Baseball through the 2008 season, only 57 position players are known to have batted right and thrown left, and Henderson is easily the most successful player to do so.[11] Henderson later said, \"All my friends were right-handed and swung from the right side, so I thought that's the way it was supposed to be done.\"[12] In 1976, Henderson graduated from Oakland Technical High School in Oakland, California, where he played baseball, basketball and football, and was an All-American running back with two 1,000-yard rushing seasons. He also ran track, but did not stay with the team as the schedule conflicted with baseball.[13] Henderson received over a dozen scholarship offers to play football. Despite a childhood dream to play for the Oakland Raiders, he turned down the scholarships on the advice of his mother, who argued that football players had shorter careers.[13][14] Henderson was drafted by the Oakland Athletics in the fourth round of the 1976 Major League Baseball draft.[15] For the first season of his minor league career he was with the Boise A's of the Northwest League. In 46 games, Henderson batted .336 and hit three home runs and two triples.[16] Henderson spent the following season with the Modesto A's. He batted .345 in 134 games during his record-setting season with Modesto. Henderson, along with Darrell Woodard, nearly broke the league record for team stolen bases. The Modesto A's finished the season with 357 stolen bases,[17] just shy of the league record of 370.[18] While Woodard tied the single-season player record with 90 stolen bases,[17] Henderson beat the record by stealing 95 bases, and was awarded the Sundial Trophy, given to the Modesto A's Most Valuable Player.[16][19] Henderson spent the 1978 season with the Jersey City A's of the Eastern League. After the minor league season ended, he played the 1978–1979 winter season for the Navojoa Mayos of the Mexican Pacific League. He played in six games for the team, which won its first championship.[20] In 1979, Henderson started the season with the Ogden A's of the Pacific Coast League. In 71 games for Ogden, he had a batting average of .309 and stole 44 bases.[16] Henderson made his major league debut with Oakland on June 24, 1979, getting two hits in four at-bats, along with a stolen base.[21] He batted .274 with 33 stolen bases in 89 games.[22] In 1980, Henderson became the third modern-era player to steal 100 bases in a season (Maury Wills 104 in 1962 and Lou Brock's 118 in 1974 had preceded him).[23] His 100 steals broke Eddie Collins' franchise record of 81 in 1910 with what were then the Philadelphia Athletics and set a new American League (AL) record, surpassing Ty Cobb's 96 set in 1915.[23] He also batted .303, had 179 hits (tied for ninth in AL), scored 111 runs (fourth in AL), drew 117 walks (second in AL), had a .420 on-base percentage (third in AL) and led the AL by reaching base 301 times.[24] That winter, Henderson played in the Puerto Rican Professional Baseball League; his 42 stolen bases broke that league's record as well.[25] Henderson was an MVP candidate a year later, in a season shortened by a players' strike. He hit .319, fourth in the AL, and led the league in hits (135), runs (89) and in steals (56). Henderson was also third in on-base percentage (.408), tied for second in triples (7), fourth in walks (64), eighth in total bases (185) and second in times reaching base (201). In so doing, he became the emblematic figure of Oakland manager Billy Martin's aggressive \"Billy Ball\" philosophy, which received much media attention.[26] Finishing second to the Milwaukee Brewers' Rollie Fingers in the MVP voting, Henderson earned his only Gold Glove Award in fielding that season. He later became known for his showboat \"snatch catches\", in which he would flick his glove out at incoming fly balls, then whip his arm behind his back after making the catch.[27] In 1982, Henderson broke Lou Brock's modern major league single season record by stealing 130 bases, a total which has not been approached since. He stole 84 bases by the All-Star break; no player has stolen as many as 84 bases in an entire season since 1988, when Henderson himself stole 93.[28] Henderson's 130 steals outpaced nine of the American League's 14 teams that season. He also led the AL in walks (116), was fourth in runs (119) and third in on-base percentage (.398).[24] Inspired by Dodgers leadoff hitter Rudy Law, Henderson adopted an exaggerated crouch as his batting stance, which reduced his strike zone without sacrificing much power.[29] Sportswriter Jim Murray described Henderson's strike zone as being \"smaller than Hitler's heart\".[30] In 1982, he described his approach to Sports Illustrated: I found that if I squatted down real low at the plate... I could see the ball better. I also knew it threw the pitcher off. I found that I could put my weight on my back foot and still turn my hips on the swing. I'm down so low I don't have much of a strike zone. Sometimes, walking so much even gets me mad. Last year Ed Ott of the Angels got so frustrated because the umpire was calling balls that would've been strikes on anybody else that he stood up and shouted at me, \"Stand up and hit like a man.\" I guess I do that to people.[31] Regarding Henderson's 1982 season, the mid-1980s book The Hidden Game of Baseball looked at such statistics as .78 expected runs with a runner on first and no outs, 1.07 expected runs with runner on second and no outs, and only .25 expected runs no one on and one out. The authors concluded that with Henderson's 130 stolen bases he contributed 22.2 runs to the A's offense. By being caught stealing 42 times, he cost his team 20.6 runs, and therefore, the authors concluded, the net effect of his running activity was merely 1.6 extra runs for the season.[32] A later analysis determined his net contribution was 5.3 runs for the season.[33] Henderson also made MLB history in 1983 with his third 100 runs/100 stolen bases/100 walks season (no other modern player has done it even once), when he led the AL in stolen bases (108), walks (103) while finishing fourth in runs scored (105). He was also second in on-base percentage (.414), tied for ninth in triples (7) and fifth in times on base, reaching 257 times.[24] In 1984, Henderson hit 16 home runs while leading the league in stolen bases (66), finishing second in runs scored (113) and third in on-base-percentage (.399). After the season, he was traded to the New York Yankees.[24] As his muscular frame developed, Henderson continued to improve as a hitter. His increasing power-hitting ability eventually led to a record for home runs to lead off a game. During his career, he hit over 20 home runs in four different seasons, with a high of 28 in 1986 and again in 1990.[24] In December 1984, Henderson was traded to the New York Yankees along with Bert Bradley for five players: Tim Birtsas, Jay Howell, Stan Javier, Eric Plunk, and José Rijo.[24] In his first season with the Yankees, he led the league in runs scored (146) and stolen bases (80), was fourth in batting average (.314), walks (99) and on-base percentage (.419), seventh in slugging (.516), third in OPS (.934) and hit 24 home runs.[34] He also won the Silver Slugger Award, and was third in the voting for the MVP award. His 146 runs scored were the most since Ted Williams had 150 in 1950,[35] and he became the first player since Jimmie Foxx in 1939 to amass more runs scored than games played. Henderson became the first player in major league history to reach 80 stolen bases and 20 home runs in the 1985 season. He matched the feat in 1986, as did the Reds' Eric Davis; they remain the only players in major league history who are in the \"20/80 club\".[24][36] It was with the Yankees that Henderson, who had previously worn number 35 with Oakland, which was already taken by his Yankees teammate Phil Niekro, switched to his now famous 24, a number he would wear for the rest of his career (with exceptions: (1) he briefly wore number 14 in 1993 while playing with the Blue Jays, (2) he wore his \"old\" number 35 in 2000 and 2002 while playing with the Mariners and the Red Sox, and (3) he wore number 25 while playing with the Dodgers).[37] In 1986, he led the AL in runs scored (130) and stolen bases (87) for the second year in a row, and was seventh in walks (89) and extra base hits (64) while hitting 28 home runs (9 of which led off games) and had 74 runs batted in (RBIs).[38] In 1987, he had a below-average season by his standards, fueling criticism from the New York media, which had never covered Henderson or his eccentricities kindly.[39] Yankees owner George Steinbrenner issued a press release claiming that manager Lou Piniella wanted to trade Henderson for \"jaking it\" (playing lackadaisically).[40] Still, Henderson had his best on-base percentage to that point in his career (.423), with a .291 batting avg., was fifth in the AL in stolen bases (41) and hit 17 home runs despite playing only 95 games.[41] It was the only season from 1980 to 1991 in which Henderson did not lead the AL in steals. Seattle's Harold Reynolds led the league with 60 steals; Reynolds tells the story of getting an impish phone call from Henderson after the season: The phone rings. 'Henderson here.' I say, 'Hey, what's going on, Rickey?' I think he's calling to congratulate me, but he goes, 'Sixty stolen bases? You ought to be ashamed. Rickey would have 60 at the break'... then click, he hung up.\"[7] In 1988, Henderson led the AL in steals (93), was third in runs scored (118), fifth in OBP (.394) and seventh in walks (82), while hitting .305.[24] Though only in New York for 4+1⁄2 seasons, Henderson set the Yankees' franchise record with 326 stolen bases; the previous high (248) had been held by Hal Chase, who last played for the Yankees in 1913, when the team was still known as the Highlanders. On May 28, 2011, Henderson's total was surpassed by Derek Jeter,[42] who by that point had already played 1,700 more games as a Yankee than Henderson.[43] On June 21, 1989, the Yankees traded Henderson back to Oakland for Plunk, Greg Cadaret, and Luis Polonia.[44] After the trade, his 52 steals and 72 runs scored led the Athletics into the postseason;[24] his 126 walks for the year were the most for any AL hitter since Frank Howard's 132 in 1970.[45] Henderson was named MVP of the 1989 American League Championship Series (ALCS) after hitting .400, scoring eight runs and delivering two home runs, five RBIs, seven walks and a 1.000 slugging percentage.[24] He had eight stolen bases in the five-game series, breaking Brock's postseason series record of seven,[46] which he set in 1967 and repeated in 1968.[a] Leading the Athletics to a four-game sweep over the San Francisco Giants and the franchise's first World Series title since 1974, Henderson hit .474 with an .895 slugging average (including two triples and a homer), while stealing three more bases.[24] On August 22, 1989, he became Nolan Ryan's 5,000th strikeout victim, but Henderson took an odd delight in the occurrence, saying, \"If you haven't been struck out by Nolan Ryan, you're nobody.\"[47] A year later, Henderson finished second in the league in batting average with a mark of .325, losing out to the Kansas City Royals' George Brett on the final day of the season. Henderson had a remarkably consistent season, with his batting average falling below .320 for only one game, the third of the year. Reaching safely by a hit or a walk in 125 of his 136 games, he led the league in runs (119), stolen bases (65), on-base percentage (.439) and OPS (1.016) was second in slugging percentage (.577), fourth in walks (97) and extra base hits (66), sixth in home runs (28) and total bases (282) and had 61 RBIs. Henderson won the AL's MVP award and helped Oakland to another pennant. He again performed well in the World Series (.333 batting, .667 slugging, a home run and three steals in four games), but the A's were swept by the underdog Cincinnati Reds.[48] On May 1, 1991, Henderson broke one of baseball's most noted records when he stole the 939th base of his career, one more than Brock's total compiled from 1961 to 1979, mainly with the St. Louis Cardinals.[49][50] On July 16, 1993, Henderson broke the world stolen base record by stealing his 1,066th base, thus going past the record which was previously held by Yutaka Fukumoto. In 90 games with Oakland, he was batting .327 (second in AL) with 17 home runs and 47 RBIs. He also had scored 77 runs, stolen 31 bases, drew 85 walks, had a .469 on-base percentage and was slugging .553.[24] In July 1993, the Athletics traded Henderson to the playoff-bound Toronto Blue Jays for Steve Karsay and José Herrera.[24] He performed disappointingly for the Jays, hitting only .215 in 44 games, which was probably due to the fact that he fractured a bone on his hand early on with the team, after being hit by a pitch, although he still contributed 22 stolen bases and 37 runs scored. However, his hitting woes continued in the post-season, batting .120 in the American League Championship Series and .227 in the World Series. Nevertheless, Henderson was involved in the final play of the World Series that year. He and Paul Molitor scored on Joe Carter's Series-ending home run, one of the most famous moments in baseball history.[51] After the 1993 season, Henderson re-signed as a free agent with Oakland in December 1993.[24] In 1994 and 1995, Henderson finished in the top 10 in the league in walks, steals and on-base percentage.[24] His .300 average in 1995 marked his sixth and final season in the AL with a .300 or better average.[24] Henderson signed with the San Diego Padres in the offseason. In 1996, he again finished in the top ten in the National League (NL) in walks, OBP, steals and runs.[52] On August 13, 1997, the Padres traded Henderson to the Anaheim Angels for minor leaguers Ryan Hancock and Stevenson Agosto, as well as a player to be named later.[53] The Padres acquired George Arias to complete the trade.[54] As an Angel, Henderson batted only .183 for the rest of the season.[24] In January 1998, Henderson signed as a free agent with the Athletics, the fourth time he played for the franchise.[24] That season he led the majors in stolen bases (66) and the AL in walks (118), while scoring 101 runs.[24] In so doing, the 39-year-old became the oldest player to lead a league in stolen bases, and the oldest player to reach 50 steals.[55] A year later, Henderson signed as a free agent with the New York Mets. In 1999, he batted .315 with 37 steals and was seventh in the NL in on-base percentage.[56] Henderson was voted the 1999 National League comeback player of the year by The Sporting News. He wore number 24, which—although not officially retired—had not been regularly worn by a Mets player since Willie Mays' retirement in 1973. Nonetheless, Henderson and the Mets were an uneasy fit. After the Mets' loss in the 1999 NLCS, the New York press made much of a card game between Henderson and Bobby Bonilla. Both players had been substituted out of the lineup, and they reportedly left the dugout before the playoff game had concluded.[57] Henderson sought a raise on his $1.9 million salary for the 2000 season, but the Mets refused to renegotiate. He also feuded with manager Bobby Valentine and complained about traveling to Tokyo for the 2000 season opening series against the Chicago Cubs. Worse, he put in minimal effort, effectively tanking, and forcing his release. Henderson batted .219 with no home runs and two RBIs, while The Mets offered him to every team in the league, with no takers. The team then put him on waivers and granted him his release in May.[58][59] After his release from the Mets, Henderson signed as a free agent with the Seattle Mariners.[60] In his second game as a Mariner, on May 20, Henderson hit a leadoff home run, thus becoming the third player to hit a home run in four different decades (Ted Williams and Willie McCovey were the others).[61] Despite starting the season in the National League, Henderson finished fourth in the AL in stolen bases (31).[62] A free agent in March 2001, Henderson returned to the Padres. During the 2001 season, he broke three major league career records and reached an additional major career milestone. He broke Babe Ruth's record of 2,062 career walks,[52] Ty Cobb's record of 2,245 career runs,[63] and Zack Wheat's record of 2,328 career games in left field, and on the final day of the season (October 7) collected his 3,000th career hit, a leadoff double off Rockies pitcher John Thomson in San Diego.[64][65] That final game was also Tony Gwynn's last major league game, and Henderson had originally wanted to sit out so as not to detract from the occasion, but Gwynn insisted that Henderson play.[66] After scoring the game's first run, Henderson was removed from the lineup. At the age of 42, in his last substantial major league season, Henderson finished the year with 25 stolen bases, ninth in the NL;[24] it also marked his 23rd consecutive season with more than 20 steals.[24] Of the ten top base stealers who were still active as of 2002, the other nine each stole fewer bases in 2002 than the 42-year-old Henderson.[67] In February 2002, Henderson signed as a free agent with the Boston Red Sox, where at age 43 he became the oldest player to play center field in major league history when he replaced Johnny Damon for three games in April and another in July. Henderson's arrival was marked by a statistical oddity. During the 22+1⁄2 years from his June 1979 debut through the end of the 2001 season, he had stolen more bases by himself than his new team had: 1,395 steals for Henderson, 1,382 for the Boston franchise. The Red Sox finally \"passed\" Henderson on April 30, 2002. At age 43, Henderson was the oldest player in the American League.[68] While playing in Boston, Henderson wore his old number 35, as his regular number 24 was already taken by Red Sox teammate Manny Ramirez.[69][70] As the 2003 season began, Henderson was without a team for the first time in his career. He played in the independent Atlantic League with the Newark Bears, hoping for a chance with another major league organization.[71][72] After being named the Atlantic League All-Star Game MVP and receiving much media attention, the Los Angeles Dodgers signed him over the All-Star break. In 30 games with the Dodgers, he had 15 hits and three stolen bases, with a .208 batting average.[24] Before the 2003 season, his last in the majors, Henderson discussed his reputation for hanging onto his lengthy baseball career: Each and every day I set a record, but we never talk about it. We'll talk about a home run hitter 24/7. Well, they haven't broken any all-time records, but they hit homers, and that's what matters nowadays. You continue playing, you accomplish a lot, and you'd think people would look at it as a fantastic career. Instead, Rickey thinks people want Rickey to quit more than anything.\"[73] Henderson played his last major league game on September 19, 2003; he was hit by a pitch in his only plate appearance, and came around to score his 2,295th run. Though it became increasingly unlikely that he would return, he continued to publicly debate his own official retirement.[74] After leaving the Dodgers, Henderson started his second consecutive season with the Newark Bears in May 2004.[75] In 91 games he had a .462 OBP, with more than twice as many walks (96) as strikeouts (41), and stole 37 bases while being caught only twice.[16] On May 9, 2005, Henderson signed with the San Diego Surf Dawgs of the Golden Baseball League, an independent league. This was the Surf Dawgs' and the Golden Baseball League's inaugural season, and Henderson helped the team to the league championship. In 73 games he had a .456 OBP, with 73 walks while striking out 43 times, and 16 steals while being caught only twice.[76] It would be his final professional season. Henderson would not accept the end of his major league career. In May 2005, he was still insisting that he was capable of playing in the major leagues. NBC and ESPN reported that Henderson had announced his much-delayed official retirement on December 6, 2005, but his agent denied the report the following day. On February 10, 2006, he accepted a position as a hitting instructor for the Mets, while leaving the door open to returning as a player. In July 2006, Henderson discussed an offer he'd received to rejoin the Surf Dawgs for the 2006 season, which would have been his 31st in professional baseball, but suggested he'd had enough. Six weeks later, though, on August 11, he claimed \"It's sort of weird not to be playing, but I decided to take a year off\", adding, \"I can't say I will retire. My heart is still in it... I still love the game right now, so I'm going to wait it out and see what happens.\"[77] On May 18, 2007, the San Francisco Chronicle reported that Oakland general manager Billy Beane was considering adding Henderson to the roster for one game in September, provided it did not \"infringe on the integrity of the roster or of the season\", so that Henderson could retire as an Oakland A's player.[78] A month later, Henderson appeared to reject the overture, saying, \"One day? I don't want one day. I want to play again, man. I don't want nobody's spot... I just want to see if I deserve to be out there. If I don't, just get rid of me, release me. And if I belong, you don't have to pay me but the minimum—and I'll donate every penny of that to some charity. So, how's that hurtin' anybody?... Don't say goodbye for me... When I want that one day they want to give me so bad, I'll let you know.\"[79] The Athletics retired Henderson's #24 on August 1, 2009.[80] Henderson finally conceded his \"official retirement\" on July 13, 2007: \"I haven't submitted retirement papers to MLB, but I think MLB already had their papers that I was retired.\" Characteristically, he added, \"If it was a situation where we were going to win the World Series and I was the only player that they had left, I would put on the shoes.\"[81] Contrary to speculation,[82][83][84] Henderson's refusal to officially retire had not been delaying his eligibility for Hall of Fame induction. Since the 1970s, the five-year waiting period has been based on major league service only. Henderson was elected as part of the 2009 Hall of Fame vote, in his first appearance on the ballot. At a press conference two days after his election, the 50-year-old Henderson told reporters, \"I believe today, and people say I'm crazy, but if you gave me as many at-bats that you would give the runners out there today, I would outsteal every last one of them ... they can always ring my phone and I'll come on down and help their ballclub, that's how much I love the game.\"[85] In 2011, on the 20th anniversary of his record-breaking stolen base, the Oakland A's held \"Rickey Henderson Bobblehead Day.\" At Henderson's insistence, the giveaway plastic dolls had one atypical modification: \"I told them, put a little dirt on mine, make sure that [it looks] like I'm playing the game.\" Almost eight years after his final game, Henderson also reiterated his desire to return: \"Sometimes when I sit around and look at the game and things ain't going right, I just think, 'Just let me put on the uniform and go out there and take a chance'.\"[86] The New York Mets hired Henderson as a special instructor in 2006, primarily to work with hitters and to teach base stealing. Henderson's impact was noticeable on José Reyes, the Mets' former leadoff hitter.[87] \"I always want to be around the game,\" Henderson said in May 2007. \"That's something that's in my blood. Helping them have success feels just as good.\"[88] On July 13, 2007, the Mets promoted Henderson from special instructor to first base coach, replacing Howard Johnson, who became the hitting coach.[89] Henderson was not retained as a coach for 2008. Henderson had periodically been a special instructor in the Athletics' spring training camps. In 2010, he worked on base stealing (most notably with Rajai Davis and Coco Crisp) and outfield drills.[90] Sports Illustrated's Tom Verducci wrote in 2003, \"There are certain figures in American history who have passed into the realm of cultural mythology, as if reality could no longer contain their stories: Johnny Appleseed. Wild Bill Hickok. Davy Crockett. Rickey Henderson. They exist on the sometimes narrow margin between Fact and Fiction.\"[91] Henderson notably referred to himself in the third-person.[92][93] According to Verducci, during one off-season, Henderson called Padres general manager Kevin Towers and left this message: \"Kevin, this is Rickey. Calling on behalf of Rickey. Rickey wants to play baseball.\"[30] However, Henderson denied that this happened in a February 26, 2009, interview on Mike and Mike in the Morning.[94] In 2003, he discussed his unusual phraseology, saying, \"People are always saying, 'Rickey says Rickey.' But it's been blown way out of proportion. Rickey says it when Rickey doesn't do what Rickey needs to be doing. Rickey uses it to remind himself, like, 'Rickey, what you doing, you stupid. ... ' Rickey's just scolding himself.\"[73] Henderson did use the first person pronoun on occasion, such as when he defended his position during a contract dispute: \"All I'm asking for is what I want.\"[30] Henderson was so proud of a $1 million signing bonus that he framed it instead of cashing it, thus losing several months' interest.[95] Similarly, Henderson refused to spend his per diem money that all players receive on road trips: instead, he would put the envelopes containing the cash in a box, and when one of his children performed well in school he would invite them to choose an envelope out of the box and keep its contents. In 2002, following an argument with pitcher Orlando Hernández, Henderson stated, \"He needs to grow up a little bit. I ain't a kid. When I broke into the game, he was crawling on his hands and knees. Unless he's as old as I am. He probably is.\" (Hernández is approximately seven years younger.)[96] There are many unconfirmed stories about Henderson. A Padres teammate (variously reported as Steve Finley or Tony Gwynn) once offered him a seat anywhere on the bus, saying that Henderson had tenure. Henderson supposedly replied, \"Ten years? What are you talking about? Rickey got 16, 17 years.\"[97] One widely reported story was a fabrication that began as a clubhouse joke made by a visiting player.[97] While playing for Seattle in 2000, Henderson was said to have commented on first baseman John Olerud's practice of wearing a batting helmet while playing defense, noting that a former teammate in Toronto did the same thing. Olerud was reported to have replied, \"That was me.\" The two men had been together the previous season with the 1999 Mets, as well as with the 1993 World Champion Blue Jays. Several news outlets originally reported the story as fact.[98][99][100] Verducci wrote, \"Rickey is the modern-day Yogi Berra, only faster.\" Henderson himself was resigned to his persona: \"A lot of stuff they had me doing or something they said I had created, it's comedy. I guess that's how they want to judge me, as a character.\"[91] In 1983, Henderson married his high-school sweetheart, Pamela. They had three children: Angela, Alexis, and Adrianna.[12] Following a bout with pneumonia, Henderson died on December 20, 2024, five days before his 66th birthday.[101][102] He had been a patient at the University of California, San Francisco Medical Center.[103] It took a long time, huh [Pause for cheers] First of all, I would like to thank God for giving me the opportunity. I want to thank the Haas family, the Oakland organization, the city of Oakland, and all you beautiful fans for supporting me. [Pause for cheers] Most of all, I'd like to thank my mom, my friends, and loved ones for their support. I want to give my appreciation to Tom Trebelhorn and the late Billy Martin. Billy Martin was a great manager. He was a great friend to me. I love you, Billy. I wish you were here. [Pause for cheers] Lou Brock was the symbol of great base stealing. But today, I'm the greatest of all time. Thank you. On May 1, 1991, Henderson stole his 939th base to pass Lou Brock and became the sport's all-time stolen base leader.[49] Henderson's speech after breaking Brock's record was similar to the standard victory or award speech. He thanked God and his mother, as well as the people that helped him in baseball. Because his idol was Muhammad Ali, Henderson decided to use the words \"greatest of all time.\"[105] These words have since been taken by many to support the notion that Henderson is selfish and arrogant,[106] although years later, Henderson revealed that he had gone over his planned remarks ahead of time with Brock, and the Cardinals Hall of Famer \"had no problem with it. In fact, he helped me write what I was going to say that day.\"[107] On the day of the speech, Brock later told reporters amiably, \"He spoke from his heart.\" Brock and Henderson had had a friendly relationship ever since their first meeting in 1981. Brock pronounced the young speedster as the heir to his record, saying, \"How are we gonna break it?\"[7] Henderson has mixed feelings about his comments: As soon as I said it, it ruined everything. Everybody thought it was the worst thing you could ever say. Those words haunt me to this day, and will continue to haunt me. They overshadow what I've accomplished in this game.[73] At the end of his July 2009 Hall of Fame induction, Henderson alluded to his earlier speech, saying:[108] In closing, I would like to say my favorite hero was Muhammad Ali. He said at one time, quote, 'I am the greatest,' end of quote. That is something I always wanted to be. And now that the Association has voted me into the Baseball Hall of Fame, my journey as a player is complete. I am now in the class of the greatest players of all time. And at this moment, I am ... [pause] ... very, very humble. Thank you. Asked if he believes the passage of time will improve his reputation, Henderson said: If you talk about baseball, you can't eliminate me, because I'm all over baseball... It's the truth. Telling the truth isn't being cocky. What do you want me to say, that I didn't put up the numbers? That my teams didn't win a lot of games? People don't want me to say anything about what I've done. Then why don't you say it? Because if I don't say it and you don't say it, nobody says it.[73] Henderson had 468 more stolen bases in his career than Brock, one short of 50% more than the game's second-most prolific basestealer.[109] In 1993, Henderson stole his 1,066th base, surpassing the world record established ten years earlier by Yutaka Fukumoto for the Hankyu Braves in Japan's Pacific League.[110] In his prime, Henderson had a virtual monopoly on the stolen base title in the American League. Between 1980 and 1991, he led the league in steals every season except 1987,[111] when he missed part of the season due to a nagging hamstring injury,[112] allowing Mariners second baseman Harold Reynolds to win the title. Henderson had one more league-leading season after that stretch, when his 66 steals in 1998 made him the oldest steals leader in baseball history. Perhaps unsurprisingly, Henderson also owns the record for times caught stealing (335). Due to incomplete historical recordkeeping for that statistic, though, it is unknown whether he is the actual career leader.[113] However, Henderson's overall 81% success rate on the basepaths is among the highest percentages in history.[114] (Carlos Beltran ranks first among players with at least 300 career attempts, at just over 86%.)[115] On July 29, 1989, Henderson stole five bases against the Mariners' left-handed Randy Johnson, his career high, and one shy of the single-game major league record. Unusually, Henderson was hitless in the game (he had four walks). Henderson had 18 four-steal games during his career. In August 1983, in a three-game series against the Brewers and a 2-game series versus the Yankees, Henderson had 13 stolen bases in five games. Baltimore Orioles third baseman Floyd Rayford described the confusion he felt during a particular game, when Henderson was leading off first base and signaling him with two fingers. Henderson quickly stole second base, then third, and Rayford understood the gesture.[30] Longtime scout Charlie Metro remembered the havoc caused by Henderson: '\"I did a lot of study and I found that it's impossible to throw Rickey Henderson out. I started using stopwatches and everything. I found it was impossible to throw some other guys out also. They can go from first to second in 2.9 seconds; and no pitcher catcher combination in baseball could throw from here to there to tag second in 2.9 seconds, it was always 3, 3.1, 3.2. So actually, the runner that can make the continuous, regular move like Rickey's can't be thrown out, and he's proven it.\"[116] Joe Posnanski of the Kansas City Star and Sports Illustrated wrote: I'm about to give you one of my all-time favorite statistics: Rickey Henderson walked 796 times in his career LEADING OFF AN INNING. Think about this again. There would be nothing, absolutely nothing, a pitcher would want to avoid more than walking Rickey Henderson to lead off an inning. And yet he walked SEVEN HUNDRED NINETY SIX times to lead off an inning. He walked more times just leading off in an inning than Lou Brock, Roberto Clemente, Luis Aparicio, Ernie Banks, Kirby Puckett, Ryne Sandberg and more than 50 other Hall of Famers walked in their entire careers... I simply cannot imagine a baseball statistic more staggering.[117] Henderson was a headfirst slider. In September 2008, Henderson discussed his base-stealing technique at length with Sports Illustrated: I wanted to know how to dive into the base because I was getting strawberries on my knees and strawberries on my ass... I was thinking about head-first versus feet-first, and wondering which would save my body. With head-first I worried about pounding my shoulders and my hands, and with feet-first I would worry about my knees and my legs. I felt that running was more important to me, with my legs, so I started going head-first. I got my [low-to-the-ground] technique from airplanes... I was on a plane and asleep and the plane bounced and when we landed we bounced and it woke me up. Then the next flight I had the same pilot and the plane went down so smooth. So I asked the pilot why, and he said when you land a plane smooth, you get the plane elevated to the lowest position you can and then you smooth it in. Same with sliding... If you dive when you're running straight up then you have a long distance to get to the ground. But the closer you get to the ground the less time it will take... I was hitting the dirt so smooth, so fast, when I hit the dirt, there wasn't no hesitation. It was like a skid mark, like you throw a rock on the water and skid off it. So when I hit the ground, if you didn't have the tag down, I was by you. No matter if the ball beat me, I was by you. That was what made the close plays go my way, I think.[118] Padres closer Trevor Hoffman said, \"I don't know how to put into words how fortunate I was to spend time around one of the icons of the game. I can't comprehend that yet. Years from now, though, I'll be able to say I played with Rickey Henderson, and I imagine it will be like saying I played with Babe Ruth.\"[30] When Henderson was 44 years old and playing for the Newark Bears in 2003, Padres general manager Kevin Towers said, \"I get e-mails daily from fans saying, 'Sign Rickey.'... I get more calls and e-mails about him than anybody... We've had some special players come through San Diego. But there's an aura about him nobody else has.\"[30] Tony La Russa, Henderson's manager in the late 1980s in Oakland, said, \"He rises to the occasion—the big moment—better than anybody I've ever seen.\"[30] Coach Rene Lachemann said, \"If you're one run down, there's nobody you'd ever rather have up at the plate than Rickey.\" Teammate Mitchell Page said, \"It wasn't until I saw Rickey that I understood what baseball was about. Rickey Henderson is a run, man. That's it. When you see Rickey Henderson, I don't care when, the score's already 1–0. If he's with you, that's great. If he's not, you won't like it.\"[26] A's pitching coach Dave Duncan said of Henderson, \"You have to be careful because he can knock one out. But you don't want to be too careful because he's got a small strike zone and you can't afford to walk him. And that's only half the problem. When he gets on base he's more trouble still.\" Sportswriter Tom Verducci wrote, \"Baseball is designed to be an egalitarian sort of game in which one player among the 18 is not supposed to dominate... Yet in the past quarter-century Henderson and Barry Bonds have come closest to dominating a baseball game the way Michael Jordan could a basketball game.\"[91] In July 2007, New York Sun sportswriter Tim Marchman wrote about Henderson's accomplishments: He stole all those bases and scored all those runs and played all those years not because of his body, but because of his brain. Rickey could tell from the faintest, most undetectable twitch of a pitcher's muscles whether he was going home or throwing over to first. He understood that conditioning isn't about strength, but about flexibility. And more than anyone else in the history of the game, he understood that baseball is entirely a game of discipline—the discipline to work endless 1–1 counts your way, the discipline to understand that your job is to get on base, and the discipline to understand that the season is more important than the game, and a career more important than the season. Maybe he'd get a bit more credit for all this if he were some boring drip like Cal Ripken Jr., blathering on endlessly about humility and apple pie and tradition and whatever else, but we're all better off with things the way they are... Everyone had their fun when he broke Lou Brock's stolen base record and proclaimed, 'I am the greatest', but he was, of course, just saying what was plainly true.\"[119] As of 2024[update], Henderson ranks first all-time in runs scored (2,295) and stolen bases (1,406), fourth in career games played (3,081), 13th in at bats (10,961), and 26th in hits (3,055). He has the second-highest career power–speed number, behind Barry Bonds, at 490.4.[120][121] His record for most career walks (2,190) has since been broken by Barry Bonds; Henderson is now second but continues to hold the record for most unintentional walks (2,129).[122] While his career batting average of .279 is considered somewhat modest for a leadoff hitter, his walks helped him post a stout .401 on-base percentage (OBP) for his career. He posted an OBP of at least .400 in 16 separate seasons, with a high mark of .439 in his 1990 MVP season. Henderson averaged 115 walks per 162 games over his career.[123] Henderson also holds the record for most home runs to lead off a game, with 81;[92] George Springer is second with 60 going into the 2025 season.[124] During the 2003 season, Henderson surpassed Babe Ruth for the career record in secondary bases (total bases compiled from extra base hits, walks, stolen bases, and times hit by pitch). In 1993, he led off both games of a doubleheader with homers. At the time of his last major league game, Henderson was still in the all-time top 100 home run hitters, with 297. Bill James wrote in 2000, \"Without exaggerating one inch, you could find fifty Hall of Famers who, all taken together, don't own as many records, and as many important records, as Rickey Henderson.\"[125] Henderson's eight steals during the 1989 ALCS broke Lou Brock's postseason record for a single series.[126][127] His record for the most postseason stolen bases was broken by Kenny Lofton's 34th career steal during the 2007 ALCS;[128] however, Lofton accomplished his total in 95 postseason games compared to Henderson's 60.[24][129] Henderson is the only American League player to steal more than 100 bases in a single season (having accomplished the feat three times), and he is the all-time stolen base leader for the Oakland A's.[24][130] In 1999, before breaking the career records for runs scored and walks, Henderson was ranked number 51 on The Sporting News' list of the 100 Greatest Baseball Players,[131] and was a nominee for the Major League Baseball All-Century Team.[132] In 2005, The Sporting News updated their 100 Greatest Players list, and Henderson had inched up to number 50.[133] On January 12, 2009, Henderson was elected to the Baseball Hall of Fame in his first year on the ballot, receiving 94.8% of the vote.[73] This was the 13th highest percentage in major league history.[134] Asked to choose the best player in history, Henderson declined, saying, \"There are guys who have done different things very well, but I don't know of anyone who mastered everything.\" Offered the chance to assess his own placement among the game's greats, he said, \"I haven't mastered the homers or RBI. The little things, I probably mastered.\" Of his various records and achievements, he values his career-runs-scored mark the most: \"You have to score to win.\"[135] Italics denotes active player",

                "content": "If not listed, please contact your TV provider. Upon hearing of the death of all-time great Rickey Henderson, I first got a little pedantic with myself. The overuse of the word \"unique\" has become a bit of a pet peeve here. Every single person, by definition of the word, is unique. There are no copies of us and we're all one of a kind, after all. I'll hear people in the sports media say something is \"very unique\" or something and it nearly makes me want to scream. You're either one of a kind or you aren't. There's no very. With Rickey, though, I'm ready to be a hypocrite and throw my issue out the proverbial window. He was a special kind of unique and baseball is never going to see anything like him ever again. It wasn't just how good he was, though that was a major component. There are plenty of mind-blowing stats posted by Henderson. He led the league in steals 12 times, including when he was 39 years old. He led the league in runs five times. He got on base more times than all but three players in history. He scored more runs and stole more bases than anyone, ever. Rickey Henderson was, without a doubt, the single greatest leadoff man in baseball history. It wasn't just that he was so good at getting on base and stealing bases and scoring runs. He was a power threat as a table-setter, a generally foreign concept in his era. He squatted down so low in his batting stance that despite opposing pitchers desperately wanting to keep him off first base, he drew more walks than anyone not named Barry Bonds in history. More than any of that, though, Rickey had a swagger that was something to behold. Back before home run celebrations were ubiquitous, he would pick at his jersey while rounding the bases in style: The \"cool\" just oozes out of the screen, man. There was just no one in his ballpark. He homered to set the all-time record for runs scored and fittingly slid into home plate. The personality was legendary. Sure, there are mainstream stories on it. Who could forget when he said \"today, I am the greatest of all time\" while standing right next to Lou Brock, having just broken Brock's stolen base record? We've all heard the John Olerud tale -- which isn't true, but we'll get to that -- a million times, but in diving into Howard Bryant's excellent book, \"Rickey,\" you'll find some other gems. Such as ... For some, this paints a picture that Henderson was a bit of a circus act, but that isn't who he was. He was a serious player and he took himself seriously when need be. His Hall of Fame speech is a good example there. Notice that he closes with \"today, I am very, very humble,\" as a play on this \"greatest of all-time\" speech. Also, his talking in the third person was \"exaggerated,\" Dave Parker told Bryant, and it was done to get laughs out of white people. And, hey, it works. Those stories are funny. It's one of the many reasons he's one of my favorite players of all-time. The main takeaway from Henderson's life as a baseball legend, though, is being the greatest leadoff man of all-time. The leadoff man is the catalyst to the offense. He sets the tone of the game to come. No one has ever hit more leadoff home runs and nothing sets the tone for the game like that. No one has ever scored more runs and there's no more important job for a leadoff man. No one has ever come even remotely close to stealing as many bases and that makes him the biggest pest of pitchers we've ever seen. He won an MVP. He won two World Series. He ranks in the top 20 all-time in WAR. He squeezed every bit of production possible out of his baseball talent. Throw the swagger and funny stories on top of everything and we've got the one and only Rickey. The baseball world has lost an all-time great. There was never anyone even close to Rickey Henderson and we'll never see anyone come close moving forward. He was enough to throw the rules out the window and make exceptions to our own personal preferences. He was, truly, a special kind of unique. © 2004-2024 CBS Interactive. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.

                "content": "Statement from Pamela Henderson It is with profound sadness that we share the passing of my husband, Rickey Henderson. A legend on and off the field, Rickey was a devoted son, dad, friend, grandfather, brother, uncle, and a truly humble soul. Rickey lived his life with integrity, and his love for baseball was paramount. Now, Rickey is at peace with the Lord, cherishing the extraordinary moments and achievements he leaves behind. We are deeply grateful for the outpouring of love, support, and heartfelt memories from family, friends, and fans — all of which have brought immense comfort. We also extend our sincere gratitude to MLB, the Oakland A's, and the incredible doctors and nurses at UCSF who cared for Rickey with dedication and compassion. Your prayers and kindness mean more than words can express. In this difficult time, we kindly ask for your respect and privacy as we adjust to life without Rickey, holding on to the legacy he left for all of us. With gratitude,Pamela Henderson and his daughters Statement from the A’s Rickey Henderson is one of the greatest baseball players of all time. His on-field accomplishments speak for themselves, and his records will forever stand atop baseball history. He was undoubtedly the most legendary player in Oakland history and made an indelible mark on generations of A’s fans over his 14 seasons wearing the Green and Gold. For those who knew him personally, Rickey was much more than a franchise icon and a Baseball Hall of Famer. He was a friend and mentor to every player, coach, and employee who passed through the Oakland Coliseum or played a game on the field that came to bear his name. We are shocked and heartbroken by his passing. His loss will be felt not only by A’s fans but also by baseball fans around the world. The entire A's organization sends its sincere condolences to Rickey’s family and loved ones at this time. Statement from A’s Owner John Fisher Rickey was one of a kind. I’m shocked and deeply saddened by his passing, knowing we will no longer see this humble, smiling, and always approachable legend at Spring Training or in the clubhouse. He symbolized everything that is great about baseball and his hometown team, the Oakland Athletics. As Billy Beane shared with me, \"At 65, Rickey still looked ready to put on his uniform and lead off.\" I will miss him. My deepest condolences to his wife, daughters, family, and friends. Statement from A’s Senior Advisor to the Managing Partner Billy Beane Rickey was a teammate, a competitor, and someone I was lucky enough to work alongside and ultimately call a friend. He was the greatest Oakland A of all time and will deservedly be remembered that way by fans of baseball across the world. His impact on the A's, on Oakland, and on baseball is immeasurable, as he continued to affect the lives and careers of A's players and staff until the very end. My condolences go out, first and foremost, to his family for their loss, and to everyone who knew and admired Rickey. He will be greatly missed. Statement from A’s President Dave Kaval Rickey was a true original. One of the greats. He lived life the same way he played baseball, with a joy that inspired others. I was blessed to have him as a friend. I, like so many others, will miss him dearly. Statement from A’s Manager Mark Kotsay It was just an honor to wear the same uniform and to have him alongside us in the dugout and on the field. Rickey’s presence was felt everywhere in our clubhouse, and it’s hard to imagine the A’s without him around.",

                "content": "Watch CBS News By Lucia Suarez Sang Updated on: December 21, 2024 / 9:52 PM EST / CBS News Rickey Henderson, a Major League Baseball Hall of Famer and the league's all-time stolen bases leader, has died at age 65, MLB announced Saturday. MLB Commissioner Robert Manfred confirmed Henderson's death in a statement, calling him \"the gold standard of base stealing and leadoff hitting.\" \"Rickey was one of the most accomplished and beloved Athletics of all-time,\" Manfred wrote. \"He also made an impact with many other Clubs during a quarter-century career like no other. Rickey epitomized speed, power and entertainment in setting the tone at the top of the lineup. When we considered new rules for the game in recent years, we had the era of Rickey Henderson in mind.\" Henderson would have been 66 on Christmas Day. No cause of death was immediately provided. Henderson's wife, Pamela Henderson, released a statement through the Oakland Athletics in which she described her husband as \"a devoted son, dad, friend, grandfather, brother, uncle, and a truly humble soul.\" She also extended the family's \"sincere gratitude to MLB, the Oakland A's, and the incredible doctors and nurses at UCSF who cared for Rickey with dedication and compassion. Your prayers and kindness mean more than words can express.\" The Chicago native, nicknamed the \"Man of Steal,\" was one of the greatest players to don the A's jersey and was widely considered to be one of the best leadoff hitters and base stealers in the sport's history. During his 25-year career, he compiled 2,055 hits, 297 home runs and 1,115 RBIs. His 1,406 stolen bases and 2,295 career runs remain Major League records. He was a 10-time All-Star and won the league MVP in 1990 with the A's, where he played the bulk of his career — 14 years over four different stints. He also spent seven years in New York — five with the Yankees and two with the Mets. He played with several other teams including the San Diego Padres, Toronto Blue Jays, Anaheim Angels, Seattle Mariners, Boston Red Sox and Los Angeles Dodgers. Henderson won two World Series titles, one with Oakland in 1989, and again with Toronto in 1993. After retiring from playing, Henderson coached one year with the Mets. He was inducted into Cooperstown as a first-ballot Hall of Famer in 2009, and just six days later, the A's retired his jersey. Lucia Suarez Sang is an associate managing editor at CBSNews.com.

                "content": "Justin Louis Baldoni (born January 24, 1984)[1] is an American actor and filmmaker. Baldoni started his career as an actor portraying Rafael Solano on the CW satirical telenovela Jane the Virgin (2014–2019). He has since gone on to direct the romance drama films Five Feet Apart (2019), Clouds (2020) and It Ends with Us (2024), the latter of which playing the role of a neurosurgeon and domestic abuser.[2] Baldoni was born in Los Angeles, California, and was raised in Medford, Oregon, the son of Sharon and Sam Baldoni.[3] His mother is from a Jewish family,[4] and his father is of Italian ancestry. His paternal grandfather is Louis Baldoni, an Indiana senator and Italian immigrant.[5] Baldoni's parents joined the Baháʼí Faith, which Baldoni practices devoutly.[6][7] Baldoni played soccer and ran track in high school, and was a radio disc jockey at a local top-40 radio station. While moving into a new apartment building, Baldoni met a manager who advised him to pursue a career in acting.[8] He attended college on a partial athletic scholarship, but later dropped out.[9] Baldoni made his acting debut in the soap opera The Young and the Restless in 2004. In 2008, Baldoni wrote, produced, and directed his first music video that was selected and won him his first \"Audience Choice Award\" at Dawn Breakers International Film Festival.[10] In 2012, Baldoni created a digital documentary series, My Last Days, a show about living—as told by the dying.[11][12] The show eventually became one of the most-watched YouTube documentary series streamed online.[13] The second season of My Last Days aired on CW and third season was released in the winter of 2018. On the heels of that success Baldoni founded Wayfarer Entertainment, a digital media studio focused on disruptive inspiration.[14] In December 2018, Baldoni spoke at the annual End Well Symposium about why he believes that thinking about our death can help us live better.[15] From 2014 to 2019, Baldoni played Rafael Solano in the CW satirical telenovela Jane the Virgin starring opposite Gina Rodriguez.[16] In May 2016 he launched a time-lapse video app for pregnant women and new moms called Belly Bump.[17] In 2018 he played a young Barry Minkow in the crime drama Con Man, directed by Bruce Caulk. Baldoni directed and produced CBS Films' Five Feet Apart, starring Cole Sprouse and Haley Lu Richardson, and based on an original script by Mikki Daughtry and Tobias Iaconis. The film was released on March 15, 2019, and chronicles the lives of two teenagers living with cystic fibrosis.[18] The film was a financial success but received mixed reviews.[19][20] The following year he directed and produced Clouds, a film depicting the life of musician Zach Sobiech with Warner Bros.[21][22] On May 14, 2020, it was announced Disney+ had acquired distribution rights to the film from Warner Bros., in light of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the film industry. It was released on October 16, 2020.[23] In 2024 Baldoni directed, produced, and starred in the romantic drama It Ends with Us, based on Colleen Hoover's novel of the same name.[24] In the film, in which he acted opposite Blake Lively, Baldoni portrays a neurosurgeon who is a domestic abuser. The film became a box office hit, earning over $350 million, but it received mixed reviews from critics.[25][26] Baldoni and Lively had a combative working relationship on the set, with Lively accusing him of sexually harassing her and creating a toxic workplace environment. When The New York Times investigated the incident, it revealed private messages from Baldoni that suggested he had orchestrated a smear campaign against her. The Times also noted that Baldoni had hired a PR crisis firm in order to \"bury her\" through social media platforms such as TikTok, Reddit, and X.[27] In July 2017, Variety announced that Baldoni was developing a male talk show through his media company Wayfarer Entertainment. The show, entitled Man Enough, is described as a disruptive panel series that explores what it means to be a man today.[28] In an interview, Baldoni described the reason he created the show. \"Man Enough really came about because I wanted to take a dive into what it really means to be a man, and this question of 'do we have it right?'\"[29] The show includes men like Matt McGorry and Javier Muñoz.[30] In August 2017, TED announced Baldoni would be a speaker at the annual TEDWomen Conference.[31] In 2021, Baldoni released a book under the same premise as his previous talk show and TED Talk titled Man Enough: Undefining My Masculinity.[32] He began a podcast series under the same name with co-hosts Liz Plank and Jamey Heath. A children's version of the book Boys Will Be Human was released in October 2022.[33] Baldoni co-founded a production company called Wayfarer Entertainment that produces television, films, and digital content. In 2019, Wayfarer sold a majority stake in the company to investment fund 4S Bay Partners, setting up a $25 million content fund,[34][35] and was renamed Wayfarer Studios in 2020.[36] The philanthropic branch of the company, called the Wayfarer Foundation, benefits homeless residents of Los Angeles.[37] They host an annual Skid Row Carnival of Love, which provides resources for employment, education, non-emergency medical care, food, clothing, hygiene, and other festivities such as face-painting, live concerts, and children's activities, serving over 4,000 homeless guests each year.[38] After almost two years of dating, Baldoni married Swedish actress Emily Fuxler, now known as Emily Baldoni, in July 2013 in Corona, California.[39] They have a daughter[40] and a son.[41] Baldoni has stated that he has ADHD.[42][43] In December 2024, Blake Lively sued Baldoni, with whom she co-starred in It Ends with Us (2024), for sexual harassment and for causing her family \"severe emotional distress\".[44] According to the complaint filed with the California Civil Rights Department, Lively alleged that Baldoni had improvised unwanted kissing during filming and created a hostile work environment through inappropriate sexual comments and boundary violations.[45] Prior to the resumption of filming after the 2023 TV and movie writers' strike, Wayfarer Studios had agreed to implement safeguards that included providing a full-time intimacy coordinator and bringing in an outside producer.[45] Lively and her husband, Ryan Reynolds, had sit-down meetings with Wayfarer Studios to address their demands of Baldoni, which were reported to include \"not showing nude videos or images of women to Lively; no more mentions of Baldoni's alleged previous 'pornography addiction'; no more discussions about sexual experiences in front of Lively and others; no further mentions of cast and crew's genitalia; and no more inquiries about Lively's weight.\"[46][47] According to documents reviewed by The New York Times, after Lively raised concerns, Baldoni and producer Jamey Heath hired crisis management experts who allegedly coordinated efforts to damage Lively's reputation through social media campaigns and strategic media placement.[45] Baldoni has denied the accusations.[48] In response to the allegations, the talent agency WME dropped Baldoni as a client.[49]",

He played college football at Alabama A&M, Independence Community College, and Houston. Dell attended Mainland High School in Daytona Beach, Florida.[1] He had originally committed to Florida International University (FIU) to play college football but attended Alabama A&M University instead.[2][3] After one year at Alabama A&M in which he had 12 receptions for 364 yards and three touchdowns, he transferred to Independence Community College.[4] In his lone year at Independence, he had 52 receptions for 766 yards and eight touchdowns.[5][1] Dell transferred to the University of Houston in 2020.[6] In his first year at Houston, he led the team with 29 receptions for 428 yards and three touchdowns over eight games.[7] In 2021, he again led the team with 90 receptions for 1,329 yards with 12 touchdowns.[8][9] He returned to Houston as the number one receiver in 2022, during which he made 100 receptions for 1,398 receiving yards and 17 receiving touchdowns in only 13 games played. Dell was drafted by the Houston Texans in the third round, 69th overall, of the 2023 NFL draft.[12] In Week 11 against the Arizona Cardinals, Dell caught a career-high eight passes for a career-high 149 yards, and one touchdown.[13] In Week 13 against the Denver Broncos, Dell suffered a fractured fibula and was ruled out for the rest of the season. He went under surgery to repair the fibula the next day.[14][15] He finished the season with 47 catches for 709 yards and seven touchdowns, which was among the rookie leaders at the time of the injury.[16] In Week 9 of the 2024 season, against the New York Jets, Dell had six receptions for 126 yards in the 21–13 loss.[17] During the Texans’ Week 15 matchup of the 2024 season against the Kansas City Chiefs, Dell suffered a season-ending dislocated knee injury and was hospitalized after catching a touchdown pass from C.J. Stroud.[18] On April 27, 2024, Dell sustained minor injuries from a shooting in Sanford, Florida. He was released from the hospital the next day.[19]",

Tank Dell comes down with a touchdown, but Jared Wayne inadvertently runs into his knee, leaving the Texans emotional for their teammate. (0:35) KANSAS CITY, Mo. -- Houston Texans wideout Tank Dell was carted off the field with what coach DeMeco Ryans called a \"significant\" knee injury after he caught a touchdown pass during Saturday's 27-19 loss to the Kansas City Chiefs. Dell was taken to University of Kansas Hospital, a Level 1 trauma center about 12 miles from Arrowhead Stadium. A source told ESPN that Dell dislocated his kneecap, confirming an NFL Network report. Any other potential injuries to the knee weren't immediately known. Ryans said Dell would remain at the hospital overnight for further evaluation. \"All our thoughts and prayers are with Tank right now,\" Ryans said. \"You guys can see what he means to our entire team.\" On the Texans' first possession of the second half, quarterback C.J. Stroud threw a 30-yard touchdown pass to Dell to cut Kansas City's lead to 17-16. But on the reception, Texans wideout Jared Wayne collided with Dell's lower leg deep in the end zone, and Dell immediately grabbed his leg but otherwise barely moved. The Texans hovered around Dell, and a few players broke into tears before his leg was placed in an air cast and he was lifted into the back of the cart. The second-year wideout out of Houston was playing a major role against the Chiefs, as he had a team-high 98 yards on seven catches with the touchdown. \"It hurts to see him go down like that,\" Ryans said. \"He was having a fantastic game.\" Houston had three possessions after Dell was hurt and scored only three points. The unit got the ball with 5:13 left and trailing 27-19, but after two negative plays, Stroud was sacked on third down, leading to a punt. The Chiefs' offense subsequently picked up multiple first downs and ran out the clock. Stroud, who shed tears after the injury, sent out his prayers to Dell postgame. \"It's not easy seeing your brother go down like that,\" Stroud said. \"I'm just tore up. \"But at the same time, I got to be strong for him. For anything, whether it goes left or right, up or down, I have to praise my Lord and savior. It's not easy, but after [the injury], I try to use it as motivation; it's not easy to just let it go. That's my best friend. It's not easy to move on and just keep playing. I tried to do the best that I could. My teammates helped me up, Joe [Mixon] helped me up and Dalton [Schultz]. I appreciate the guys just talking to me because I was going through it.\" Texans wideout Nico Collins, who finished with seven catches for 60 yards, struggled to find words to express his emotions postgame. \"That s--- hurts. It hurts. We know how much he meant to this team,\" Collins said of Dell. \"But losing one of your brothers, man, it hurts. Speedy recovery for my dog. Mentally, he's going through it, but we have to keep stepping, keep climbing for him.\" Dell's rookie season in 2023 was cut short after he suffered a broken leg in an early-December game against the Denver Broncos. In late April, he was shot at a private event in Sanford, Florida, where authorities said a teenage gunman injured 10 people after an altercation. Dell's wound was minor, and he was released from the hospital shortly after the shooting. Dell has 667 receiving yards and three touchdowns on the season. Dell's injury was the third major lower leg injury for the Texans on the afternoon. Guard Shaq Mason suffered a knee injury during a pileup in the first quarter. He limped off but was ruled out shortly afterward. Safety Jimmie Ward injured a foot in the second quarter and was carted off. The Texans have only three full days to recover from the loss, as they will host the Baltimore Ravens on Christmas Day.",

                "content": "If not listed, please contact your TV provider. Tyson Fury spent a decade and a half and 35 professional fights without suffering defeat, he has now lost back-to-back fights to Oleksandr Usyk. The native of Ukraine won their fantastic, high-pace second fight by unanimous decision on Saturday in Saudi Arabia to remain WBO, WBA and WBC world champion.. Momentum swung wildly for the first half of the bout, with Fury landing hard jabs and occasional right hands while Usyk focused his attack on Fury's body. Despite Fury weighing in at more than 280 pounds for the fight, the constant Usyk body attack never fully slowed Fury down. What did turn the tables was Usyk's left hand from his southpaw stance. That shot landed with increased frequency as the fight wore on and led to Fury backing into the ropes more often in the second half of the fight. This was similar to their first meeting in May, when Fury fought brilliantly early before Usyk took the fight over, including scoring a knockdown in Round 9 of that bout. Fury didn't suffer a knockdown in the rematch, but did struggle to keep up with Usyk's pace and pressure. Usyk was also brilliantly sharp with his punch selection, landing 179 of 423 punches to 144 of 509 for Fury. At the conclusion of 12 rounds, the ringside judges turned in identical scores of 116-112, though they did not have consensus on which rounds each man won, something Fury promoter Frank Warren took issue with while claiming his fighter deserved the nod. Both fights between Usyk and Fury are in the Fight of the Year discussion for 2024 and the Fury that showed up on Saturday night would likely defeat every heavyweight on the planet not named Oleksandr Usyk. \"He's a great fighter and a great opponent,\" Usyk said after the fight. \"It's a great fight for 24 rounds, unbelievable 24 rounds in my career.\" Asked about what's next in his career, Usyk delivered a line in broken English in his classic deadpan style. \"I can more,\" Usyk said. Usyk's post-fight interview was interrupted by IBF champion Daniel Dubois. Usyk defeated Dubois by knockout in 2023 and it was Dubois who picked up the IBF title after Usyk was stripped by the sanctioning body for going ahead with his contractually obligated rematch with Fury. \"I want my revenge,\" Dubois said as he grabbed the microphone. \"I want my revenge, Usyk. Well done tonight. I want my revenge.\" Usyk said he was willing to go through with the rematch, telling Turki Alalshikh to make the fight. Should that fight materialize -- Dubois is scheduled to defend his title against Joseph Parker on Feb. 22 -- Usyk would have a chance to become a two-time undisputed heavyweight champion. He moved to the heavyweight division in 2019 after a cruiserweight career that saw him go undisputed at that weight. The undercard saw a pair of rising prospects pick up vicious knockouts and improve their resumes. Moses Itauma, the teenage heavyweight phenom, took care of veteran Demsey McKean in brutal fashion, scoring a first-round knockout. Junior middleweight Serhii Bohachuk managed to do the same in a showdown with Ismael Davis after some incredible back-and-forth action before the fight was called off in the sixth round. Bohachuk was originally scheduled to face Israil Madrimov, but Madrimov withdrew from the fight just weeks out after coming down with bronchitis.

Tyson Fury’s mission to avenge his only professional defeat ended in crushing disappointment as he lost on a unanimous points decision to unified heavyweight champion Oleksandr Usyk in Riyadh. Another classic encounter between the well-matched rivals ended with Usyk retaining his WBC, WBA and WBO belts by finishing 116-112 ahead on all three judges’ scorecards, with an upset Fury storming out of the ring. It was a fair reflection of the Ukrainian’s control of the rematch given he set the pace for most of the 12 rounds and was the harder worker, landing more frequently and with greater impact. But that was not the view of Fury, who labelled the result an “early Christmas gift” from the judges to Usyk, or his promoter Frank Warren, who described the decision as “nuts”, “crazy” and “a nonsense”. Usyk’s performance confirmed his status as an all-time great and the 37-year-old will now look to become undisputed champion for the second time by toppling IBF champion Daniel Dubois. Relive the fight with round-by-round updates below, plus all the reaction from the Kingdom Arena: Oleksandr Usyk is the king of the modern heavyweights and has left in his slipstream the ruins of every giant boxer he has faced in the ring. On Saturday night in Riyadh, Usyk fought to a standstill once again in a gruelling clash with Tyson Fury. It was their rematch and it was personal and brilliant. At the end of 12 rounds, Usyk won an oddly wide unanimous decision to retain his championship belts and his crown as the king of the heavyweights. The three identical scores of 116-112, which meant Usyk won eight and Fury just four of the completed rounds, was harsh on Fury, but the right man had his hands raised. Read Steve Bunce’s full analysis from Riyadh: The Usyk-Fury rematch was personal and brilliant, writes Steve Bunce, but big decisions lie in both fighters’ future and danger lurks round the corner Daniel Dubois stormed the ring to interrupt Oleksandr Usyk’s celebrations after his latest win over Tyson Fury and demanded “revenge” in the form a unification bout with the Ukrainian. Usyk retained his WBC, WBA and WBO heavyweight world championship belts by finishing 116-112 ahead on all three judges’ scorecards in Riyadh to claim a unanimous decision victory over an angry Fury – who abruptly left the ring and called the decision an “early Christmas gift” from the judges to Usyk. As the Ukrainian superstar celebrated his hard-fought triumph, IBF champion Dubois decided that was the moment to climb into the ring and confront the champion, demanding a rematch with him. Dubois was knocked out by Usyk in a controversial fight in August 2023 but stormed the ring after the Ukrainian’s victory over Tyson Fury to demand a rematch Tyson Fury insisted Oleksandr Usyk had been gifted an early Christmas present after disputing the Ukrainian’s unanimous points victory in their rematch in Riyadh. Fury lost 116-112 on all three judges’ scorecards as his bid to avenge his only career loss ended conclusively with the extraordinary Usyk retaining his WBA, WBC and WBO titles. Promoter Frank Warren said he was “dumbfounded” by both the result and the wide margin of victory – and Fury agreed. “I felt a little Christmas spirit in there and I think he got a little Christmas gift from them judges. An early Christmas gift,” said Fury, who lost the first fight in May by split decision. Promoter Frank Warren also said he was ‘dumbfounded’ by both the result and the wide margin of victory Tyson Fury’s unanimous points defeat to unified world heavyweight champion Oleksandr Usyk in Riyadh was branded “nuts” by promoter Frank Warren. Fury lost 116-112 on all three judges’ scorecards as his bid to avenge his only career loss ended conclusively with the extraordinary Usyk retaining his WBA, WBC and WBO belts. The 36-year-old from Morecambe left the ring after the decision was read out, leaving Warren to protest over the outcome. “I’m dumbfounded, they gave him four rounds out of the 12 rounds, it’s impossible, one judge didn’t give him any round from round six onwards,” the Queensbury Promotions boss told DAZN. “Only four rounds. Each of them gave him four rounds, four different rounds. How can that be? It’s impossible. It’s crazy. It’s a nonsense. What fight were they watching?” Tyson Fury lost a unanimous decision 116-112 on all three judges’ scorecards, much to the confusion of promoter Warren Oleksandr Usyk beat Tyson Fury on points on Saturday to do the double over the Briton, retaining the unified heavyweight titles in the process. Usyk had beaten Fury on points in May, becoming the first undisputed heavyweight champion in 24 years. That result in Riyadh kept the Ukrainian unbeaten, while Fury tasted defeat for the first time as a professional. And on Saturday, in the same Saudi city, Usyk repeated the result, outpointing Fury again to retain the unified titles. This time it was clearer, too, with Usyk a 116-112 winner on all three scorecards, after he won via split decision in May. While Usyk’s first victory secured him undisputed status at heavyweight – after he previously reigned as undisputed cruiserweight king – the southpaw vacated the IBF title in June. As such, only the WBC, WBO and WBA belts were up for grabs in Saturday’s rematch. The Ukrainian wins more clearly this time, beating Fury 116-112 on all three scorecards Oleksandr Usyk emerged victorious over Tyson Fury again on Saturday, winning on points – just as he did in their first fight. Except this time, it was a clearer win for Usyk, according to the judges. While the Ukrainian was a split-decision winner in May, this time he won by unanimous decision. In his first fight with Fury, Usyk secured scorecards of 115-112 and 114-113, while the other judge favoured the Briton 114-113. With that, Usyk became the undisputed heavyweight champion in Riyadh. Usyk beat Fury via unanimous decision, seven months after winning by split decision Eddie Hearn tells IFL TV: “I think that the best I could hope for in the ring was a draw. Johnny Fisher won the first four rounds and the 12th. “If you give Dave Allen every other round and the knockdown, he wins by a point. I’m not sure. My true reaction was we could lose by a point or a draw. I thought he was lucky. “We suffered from inexperience and a lack of rounds. I thought Dave was fantastic. I want to make the rematch. Big fight, crowd and in London. Johnny is in hospital and had to get his ear drained. I thought he was lucky to get the win but I couldn’t split them.” Anthony Joshua believes Tyson Fury was one round away from a draw or even claiming revenge against Oleksandr Usyk in the pair’s heavyweight world title rematch in Riyadh. Another classic fight unfolded between the rivals, with the Ukrainian retaining the WBC, WBA and WBO belts after all three judges scored the fight in his favour 116-112. But Joshua saw a much closer fight than judges Gerardo Martinez, Patrick Morley and Ignacio Robles, following late drama to decide the third official. Usyk retained his titles after finishing 116-112 ahead on all three judges’ scorecards, but former champion Joshua provided his own version of events “I felt I won both fights, I knew what I had to do, knock him out to get a decision, there’s no doubt in my mind that I won the fight,” Fury said. “What’s next for me? I’m going home and having some time off. “On the record, there’s no difference, two losses. It’s been a good experience, good training. “I felt good in there, good pace on the front foot.” Tyson Fury stormed back to his changing room after the fight, incredulous that he dropped another decision to Oleksandr Usyk.

                "content": "First Team Club Tickets & Museum Download the official FC Barcelona App FC Barcelona have suffered a third consecutive home defeat in Liga. And this was perhaps the cruellest of all. In one of those games that are impossible to fathom, they played delightful football from start to finish, while Atlético were just a shadow of the side they had been bigged up to be in the build-up to Saturday’s fixture. Barça fans will be going home tonight wondering how on earth it happened, but they lost. When Pedri had given the Catalans the lead after half an hour, it was a fair reflection of the utter blaugrana domination we had enjoyed. On the back of footballing brilliance, there were plenty more chances where that came from, but the visitors managed to scramble an equaliser in practically their only attack of the entire 90 minutes of regular time play. Unfazed, Barça kept pressing, but the winner just didn’t want to come, and in the final minute of injury time, Atlético stunned the Estadi Olimpic with a late winner. It was the first time since 2006 that Barça have lost at home to Atlético, and the result means that today’s winners go three points clear at the top of the table, and with a game in hand. If Real Madrid win on Sunday, Barça would drop down to third after collecting just five of the last 21 points on offer. It’s not a great situation to be in, made all the more frustrating by the fact that today’s defeat was so utterly unwarranted. Barça had underperformed in their last two home fixtures, but there were no signs of recent shortcomings when this game got under way. All the energy and ideas that were lacking against Las Palmas and Leganés were back on display, and pretty much the entire first half was constant blaugrana pressure. Raphinha came especially close to scoring before and an extremely busy Jan Oblak was finally beaten just before the half hour. He was having a class game, but Gavi failed to fully control Pedri’s pass. Luckily for him, he inadvertently positioned the ball perfectly for the Canary Islander to finish off the move and put Barça ahead. Nobody could argue that the lead was anything less than Barça deserved. They were well and truly bossing this in every department. Unable to keep the ball long enough to create any danger of their own, Atlético were utterly overwhelmed at the back, making numerous unforced errors, and being made to look nothing like a side that had come into this game on a run of 11 straight victories. But football can be a very cruel sport. Moments after Raphinha had lobbed the most exquisite of long balls from Pedri onto the bar, Atlético somehow managed to equalise. A rare mistake from Marc Casadó and Rodrigo De Paul found himself in a position to shoot. With practically their first meaningful attack of the game, the visitors were back level. A goal like that often changes the dynamic of a game. Not this time. It was still all Barça, and the Estadi Olimpic was possibly the loudest its ever been, as the fans willed the team to get the second goal and do justice to what they were witnessing. Robert Lewandowski had it. But he fumbled a wonderful opportunity, and in the move that immediately followed had it not been for a superlative Iñaki Peña, Pablo Barrios could have earned Atlético a mystifying lead. The pace of this game had been relentless all the way, and the final minutes were more intense still. Barça piled forward, but time and again they came up against an inspired Oblak in the visiting goal. Atlético looked exhausted, but their Slovenian keeper was keeping them in the game. It was agonising to watch. Barça so, so deserved to be winning this. They certainly didn’t deserve to lose it. But in the dying minutes of injury time, as they were desperately giving it one last go, Barça were caught on the break. Alexander Sørloth was there to convert. Atlético had no idea how they had won this. And Barça had no idea how they had lost. Heartbreaking.",

                "content": "DOWNLOAD OUR APPS Atlético Madrid defeated FC Barcelona 2-1 in the 18th round of La Liga, with goals from Rodrigo De Paul and Alexander Sorloth for Atlético. Pedri scored for Barcelona. In an emotional clash, Atlético de Madrid stunned FC Barcelona with a last-minute comeback (1-2) in Matchday 18 of LaLiga. The winning goal came in the 96th minute from Alexander Sorloth, who capitalized on a counterattack to give the Colchoneros their twelfth consecutive win, while also snatching the top spot in the league from Barça, who now sit in second place. Barcelona's Dominance and Football’s Justice From the start, FC Barcelona dominated the game, with Pedri pulling the strings in midfield and a fluid style of play creating several clear chances. The pressure from Raphinha and his crosses for Lewandowski continuously troubled the Atlético defense, who struggled to maintain possession. In the 30th minute, Barcelona's dominance paid off when Pedri combined with Gavi and scored the opening goal with a precise cross-shot. Despite Barcelona’s control, Atlético stayed afloat thanks to Jan Oblak's key interventions and Barcelona’s inability to capitalize on important moments. The team led by Xabi Flick failed to make the most of their superiority, missing clear chances such as Raphinha's crossbar or Fermín’s missed one-on-one opportunity. Atlético's Comeback The second half began with more opportunities for Barça, but it was Atlético who took their first clear chance in the 61st minute. A pass from Julián Álvarez to Rodrigo De Paul, who curled in a stunning goal from outside the box, equalized the score. Although Barcelona tried to regain control with the introduction of Dani Olmo, their chances continued to be squandered. In the final minutes, Oblak kept his team alive with key saves against Olmo, Raphinha, and Pedri. However, football had one last surprise in store: in the 96th minute, Raphinha lost possession of the ball, and Atlético launched a deadly counterattack, which Sorloth finished off to score the winner, sending the Atlético bench into a frenzy. A Bitter End for Barcelona Atlético de Madrid took the three points and now leads LaLiga with 41 points, while FC Barcelona drops to second place with 38 points. The Blaugrana end the year on a sour note, having earned only five points from their last seven matches after having a substantial lead at the top of the table. With this result, Atlético Madrid climbs to the top of La Liga, taking the first spot from Barcelona with 41 points, while Barcelona drops to second with 38 points. DOWNLOAD OUR APPS",

The seismic moment in the Spanish title race was also a historic one, representing the first-ever league win for Diego Simeone at Barcelona and marking the first time since 2006 that Atletico Madrid secured a La Liga victory on the road against the Catalan giants. Barcelona dominated nearly the entire match from an attacking perspective and, as Pedri scored with half an hour played, it seemed a harbinger of yet another painful reminder of Atleti's woes in their City of Horrors. Simeone's side were under siege the entire first 45 minutes, failing to produce a single shot before the break. MORE: A closer look at the insane streaks that ended when Barcelona fell to Atletico Madrid As the second half began, little changed, and it seemed the visitors were helpless to stop history repeating itself yet again. Even after Rodrigo de Paul equalized against the run of play in the 60th minute, it felt only a matter of time that Barcelona would re-establish their earlier lead. Yet when Robert Lewandowski inexplicably missed a sitter with 15 minutes to go, hope began to creep in for Atletico Madrid. Then, in the 97th minute, super-sub Alexander Sorloth completed a venomous counter-attack and plunged a dagger into Barcelona hearts. It sent Atletico Madrid top of the Spanish top flight table on 12 consecutive wins across all competitions, while Barcelona have now won just one of their past seven in La Liga play, including back-to-back defeats.

LEWANDOWSKI MISSES A HUGE CHANCE! pic.twitter.com/KIGrpwJptD 74th min: Antoine Griezmann, who's been utterly invisible against Barcelona yet again, is replaced by Alexander Sorloth for the final 15 minutes. Barcelona remains the only La Liga opponent against whom Griezmann has not scored against for Atletico Madrid. Robin Le Normand also enters to replace Marcos Llorente. 66th min: Chance, Barcelona! Raphinha once again unlocks the Atletico Madrid back line with a delicious flick to Robert Lewandowski on the end line, but the striker can't get it, and nobody is there at the far post to tap the ball in as it flashes across the open goal! 62nd min: Koke will enter into the Atletico Madrid midfield in place of Conor Gallagher. The England international was involved in that last attacking move but it's his final contribution to the game. Also entering is Nahuel Molina to replace the invisible Guiliano Simeone. Barcelona respond shortly after by bringing on Dani Olmo and Ferran Torres to replace Fermin Lopez and Gavi. 60th min: GOAL! ATLETICO MADRID! THE VISITORS ARE LEVEL OUT OF NOTHING! It's Rodrigo de Paul with a cut finish from an attack that seemingly had fizzled out! A breakaway down the left-hand side for Julian Alvarez ends in a cutback for a trailing Antoine Griezmann, but the feed was well behind the Frenchman and it seemed that was the end of that move. Instead, the ball clips off the outstretched leg of Marc Casado, and it falls right to De Paul charging onto it from deep, and he makes no mistake from a good 25 yards out, burying it inside the far post! VIDEO: Watch De Paul goal in USA 3 - Rodrigo de Paul 🇦🇷 has scored three goals in his last four games in @LaLiga, the same as in his previous 53 games in the competition. 50% of the goals he's scored for #AtléticoDeMadrid 🔴⚪️ have been from outside the box (7/14). Punch. pic.twitter.com/rkrHdtiOXe 57th min: Chance, Barcelona! RAPHINHA PUTS HIS CHIPPED EFFORT OFF THE CROSSBAR! Pedri releases the Brazilian down the right, and Raphinha tries a sensational clip over Jan Oblak but gets it off the top of the woodwork. On the rebound, Robert Lewandowski tries to attack it but slips and only clatters Axel Witsel who's down and needs treatment. 56th min: Julian Alvarez does well to get on a through ball at pace against Pau Cubarsi, beating the young defender to the ball, but Cubarsi stays right on his hip and gets a vital dispossessing touch at the last possible moment before Alvarez get get a shot off. Anything Atleti have right now has come purely on the counter, they have no buildup to speak of. 54th min: Robert Lewandowski is bundled over at the top of the penalty area by Axel Witsel, just inches outside the 18-yard box. Witsel, who only just came on, gets a yellow card for the poor challenge. It gives the hosts a very dangerous free-kick shaded just left of the middle, and Lewandowski takes it but smashes the ball straight into the wall. Moments later, Pedri goes for the top corner from a dangerous position on the right but sails it just high. Barcelona remain in firm control of this match, nothing notable has changed since halftime. 52nd min: Atletico Madrid are forced into a change as Jose Gimenez, their most experienced player and captain, is brought off. He looks to be in some pain, with frustration on his face, as he's replaced by Axel Witsel. 48th min: Chance, Barcelona! Fermin Lopez is clean through on goal thanks to a truly fantastic vertical through-ball from Pedri, but he's denied by Jan Oblak! A wonderful, top-class save to keep the deficit at one! From an Atletico Madrid perspective, though, that's an ugly chance to give up as it looked very similar to the one which opened the scoring! It came off a horrible giveaway by Jose Gimenez who attempted a switch but passed it right to Raphinha in the central attacking area. 2nd half kickoff: They're back under way at the Olympic Stadium in Barcelona. No changes for either side for now, which is maybe a bit of a surprise from an Atletico Madrid perspective. HALFTIME: Barcelona 1-0 Atletico Madrid Complete and utter domination by Barcelona for the first 40 minutes of the game, with Pedri's goal the exclamation mark. Atletico Madrid looked as if they had something to say in the final five minutes before halftime, but they have been far and away second-best in this game. With just the one goal for Barcelona at the end of all that attacking pressure, it will be interesting to see how Diego Simeone puts together any tactical or personnel changes at the break. Atletico Madrid are once again being humbled on the road at Barcelona, something that's become a regular occurrence over the past two decades. 23 - Teams from Europe's top five leagues with the most goals scored during the first half of their matches this season.23 - #BARCELONA 🔵🔴22 - Bayer Leverkusen21 - PSG21 - Inter20 - Bayern MunichTuned. pic.twitter.com/kCobdIhTHF 40th min: Atletico Madrid look to be on the breakaway as Conor Gallagher does well to spring Julian Alvarez up front, but the famed Barcelona offside trap works to perfection and Alvarez is caught leaning just a fraction too soon. 37th min: Raphinha is absolutely cooking today, as he nutmegs Conor Gallagher to get free on the right touchline. He's dispossessed shortly thereafter as he tries to get by another defender in similar fashion, but he's giving Atletico Madrid players nightmares so far. 30th min: GOAL! BARCELONA! AN ABSOLUTELY DELICIOUS OPENING GOAL BY PEDRI!!!!! Truly sensational combo work with Gavi, and it's been coming!! The Barcelona midfielder carves through the Atletico Madrid midfield and touches to Gavi, who produces an utterly brilliant turn to free himself from a defender and release the one-two with Pedri. Through on goal, all Pedri has to do is beat Jan Oblak which he does low into the far corner! What a gorgeous combination! VIDEO: Watch Pedri goal in USA | Watch in UK Come celebrate with Pedri! 🔥#BarçaAtleti | #LaLigaHighlights pic.twitter.com/LBfBGs7YRT 25th min: Chance, Barcelona! The pressure continues for Barcelona and Gavi puts a thumping header wide! Raphinha, who's been brilliant thus far, was the one to deliver the cross on a platter to the near post, but Gavi can't hit the target, getting good power on the effort but blazing it past the woodwork. 21st min: Chance, Barcelona! The match is paused for VAR to take a closer look at an incident where a Barcelona cross evades two attackers and clips Giuliano Simeone on the elbow. The replay officials are not convinced, however, as there was no advantage gained from the incident as two forwards whiffed with attempts on goal as the ball sailed through. Credit to the officials for use of common sense! On the eventual corner, Inigo Martinez attempts a powerful hit from about 10 yards out shaded right, but Jan Oblak has his near post covered and palms the ball away with two hands! 18th min: Atletico Madrid have managed to get a lid on Barcelona's attack, but they haven't had much of their own either. Finally, the visitors get forward and secure a speculative set-piece chance from out near the right corner flag but the fizzed delivery is hoofed away and cleared. 9th min: Barcelona continue to hold all the attacking possession, pressing Atletico Madrid back into their defensive third. Raphinha has been an absolute menace down the left, forcing Atleti into a few moments of emergency last-ditch defending. They are clearly in control of the early proceedings. 4th min: Chance, Barcelona! The hosts are on the front foot early as Atletico Madrid have blocked two clear chances right on the goal mouth! Raphinha's effort is the best of the two as he rifles one from the top-right corner of the six-yard box only to see it turned away! Raphinha with a solid chance!#BarçaAtleti ⏐ #LaLigaHighlights pic.twitter.com/dxdLzn58EF Kickoff: The top two teams in the La Liga table are under way in Barcelona! 15 mins to kickoff: We've spoken already about Atletico Madrid's horrible recent record against Barcelona, but here's one number to really put it into perspective: Atleti have not won a league game at Barcelona since February of 2006. That's over a year before Lamine Yamal was born! Can their recent form this season push them to a reversal of that dismal road fortune against the Catalan giants today? 💡: Atlético Madrid’s coach Diego Simeone has never won a match away at Barcelona in 17 attempts in all competitions. He has recorded 7 draws and 10 defeats while visiting Barça. pic.twitter.com/8DewZKMhKr 30 mins to kickoff: The all-time top goal scorer in this league fixture is none other than Lionel Messi, with his 26 La Liga goals for Barcelona against Atletico Madrid — and 32 if you count all competitions. For the visitors today, their all-time top goal scorer is Paco Campos with 12, not even half Messi's career total. 🗃️ From The Vault:The 🐐 🆚 Atleti#BarçaAtleti pic.twitter.com/9aSuPqVWH1 45 mins to kickoff: Both teams have gone with a relatively consistent starting lineup given their available squad, but both made changes in midfield. Both Conor Gallagher for Atletico Madrid and Gavi for Barcelona bring a high work rate to the middle of the park. The more interesting aspect of this is a focus on who was sent to the bench. Frenkie de Jong and Dani Olmo both miss out for Barcelona, with the latter not having grabbed a goal contribution since early November. For Atletico Madrid, Samuel Lino was hooked at halftime of their win over Getafe last time out, and is replaced by a pure midfielder in Gallagher. Could that mean a move away from the 4-4-2 and instead put Antoine Griezmann at the 10 with Simeone and Alvarez up front? We'll see how it shakes out. 1 hour to kickoff: The Barcelona lineup was also released a bit early, and there are also no quirks from Hansi Flick's XI. Lamine Yamal remains out with an ankle injury, with Fermin Lopez replacing him on the wing instead of the red-hot Ferran Torres. Gavi enters in midfield for just his third start of the league season since coming back from an ACL tear. The head man Flick will not be on the touchline today as he serves the second of his two-match ban. 1 hour 15 mins to kick: Atletico Madrid have released their starting lineup 15 minutes early. There are no surprises in Diego Simeone's XI, with only one change as England international Conor Gallagher enters the lineup in place of Samuel Lino. 1 hour 30 mins to kick: Atletico Madrid are wearing their slick gray tops today. A gorgeous away kit indeed! 😁 pic.twitter.com/SzCTAWJhUN 1 hour 45 mins to kick: Ferran Torres has been a man in form off the bench for Barcelona of late, often coming in for the aging Robert Lewandowski to finish off games. The former Man City forward says he's been a better player recently thanks to Lewandowski, saying before this match he's tried to be \"like a sponge\" to learn from the famed Polish striker. 2 hours to kickoff: The juxtaposition of Atletico Madrid's recent league form against their recent history against Barcelona could not be more in contrast. Atleti have won 11 straight games across all competitions, including their last six in league play. Yet they have lost five in a row against Barcelona in league play and just one in their last 16, failing to score in any of their latest four. Even crazier, the electric Antoine Griezmann has never scored for Atletico Madrid against Barcelona in a league game, with just one goal contribution in his 15 appearances, an assist in a 1-1 draw back in 2018. Could that change today? Both Griezmann and Atletico Madrid's recent form indicate now's their best chance in quite a while to turn that awful streak around. ❗️Antoine Griezmann has scored against 29 of the 30 teams he has faced with Atletico Madrid in La Liga.He just has not scored against Barcelona. @mundodeportivo pic.twitter.com/EQd7AibZ5F This top-of-the-table La Liga match kicks off from the Lluis Companys Olympic Stadium on Saturday, December 21 at 9 p.m. local time in Barcelona, Spain. Here's how that time translates across some of the major territories around the globe: Barcelona will be without teenage superstar Lamine Yamal with an ankle injury keeping him sidelined until the start of 2025. Hansi Flick's side has failed to win any of the four league games already missed by the 17-year-old in 2024/25 with Fermin Lopez potentially replacing him in the starting XI. Also missing is none other than the aforementioned head man himself, as Flick serves the second of a two-match suspention. Andreas Christensen, Marc Bernal and Marc-Andre ter Stegen all remain out injured as well with the Blaugrana looking thin, something fans have become accustomed to in recent years, although they do get Ansu Fati back on the bench today while Ronaldo Araujo is also amongst the substitutes while he works back from a long-term hamstring issue. Barcelona starting lineup (4-3-3): Pena (GK) — Kounde, Cubarsi, Martinez, Balde — Gavi, Casado, Pedri — Lopez, Lewandowski, Raphinha. Barcelona subs (12): Szczesny (GK), Astralaga (GK), Araujo, E. Garcia, S. Dominguez, G. Martin, De Jong, Olmo, Torre, Fati, F. Torres, Victor. Diego Simeone has not confirmed any fresh injury concerns in his camp and he could stick with an unchanged team from last weekend's 1-0 over Getafe. Only Angel Correa was expected to be absent thanks to a muscle injury, but even he is available off the bench. Despite scoring a winner off the bench last time out, Alexander Sorloth could remain amongst the substitutes, with Julian Alvarez and Antoine Griezmann in sparkling form up front. Atletico Madrid starting lineup (4-4-2): Oblak (GK) — Llorente, Gimenez, Lenglet, Galan — Simeone, De Paul, Barrios, Gallagher — Alvarez, Griezmann. Atletico Madrid subs (12): Musso (GK), Azpilicueta, Le Normand, Witsel, Riquelme, Reinildo, Lino, Molina, Lemar, Koke, Correa, Sorloth.

                "content": "The UConn Huskies women's basketball team is the college basketball program representing the University of Connecticut in Storrs, Connecticut, in NCAA Division I women's basketball competition. They currently play in the Big East Conference. The UConn Huskies are the most successful women's basketball program in the nation, having won a record 11 NCAA Division I National Championships and a women's record four in a row, from 2013 through 2016,[2] plus over 50 conference regular season and tournament championships. They have taken part in every NCAA tournament since 1989; as of the end of the 2018–19 season, this is the third-longest active streak in Division I.[3] From 2008 to 2022, they appeared in a record 14 consecutive Final Fours.[4] UConn owns the two longest winning streaks (men's or women's) in college basketball history. The longest streak, 111 straight wins, started with a win against Creighton University on November 23, 2014, and ended on March 31, 2017, when a buzzer-beater at the end of overtime caused a 66–64 loss in the 2017 NCAA Final Four to Mississippi State.[5] The second streak counts 90 consecutive wins, including two undefeated seasons (2008–09 and 2009–10), and was delimited by two losses against Stanford, the first on April 6, 2008, in the National Semifinals of the NCAA Tournament, and the second – three seasons later – on December 19, 2010.[6] The Huskies also own the longest winning streak in regular-season games in college history; after an overtime loss to Stanford on November 17, 2014, they won their next 126 regular-season games until a 68–57 loss to Baylor on January 3, 2019.[7] UConn's current head coach is Luigi \"Geno\" Auriemma, who joined the team in 1985. Auriemma is one of the most successful coaches in college basketball: his 1149–150 (.885) record as of April 2022[update] represents the highest winning percentage among NCAA basketball coaches (minimum 10 seasons), any level, men's or women's,[8] while ranking him second in all-time women's wins behind retired Stanford coach Tara VanDerveer. UConn has also been one of the leaders in women's basketball attendance; the team plays its home games at both the Harry A. Gampel Pavilion in Storrs and the XL Center in Hartford. The UConn Huskies' first ever game was played on December 5, 1974, and was a 40–27 win over visiting Eastern Connecticut State University.[9] After winning their first two games, the team lost the other eight in a 10-game season. The team had a losing record during its first six seasons under coaches Sandra Hamm (1974–75) and Wanda Flora (1975–80), and only one winning season (in 1980–81) in five seasons under Jean Balthaser (1980–85). Prior to the 1985–86 season, UConn hired Geno Auriemma as their new head coach, who had served as assistant coach at Virginia, with the goal of revitalizing the program. Auriemma's training skills had an immediate impact and the team showed steady signs of progress: after going 12–15 in his first season in 1985–86, Auriemma led UConn to winning seasons in 1986–87 and 1987–88.[10] Auriemma pulled off one of his biggest and most important early recruiting successes in 1987 when he convinced an All American from New Hampshire, Kerry Bascom, to come to UConn. Bascom had an immediate impact on the UConn program: in 1989 she won the Big East Player of the Year award as a sophomore (she also won the award in her junior and senior years) and led UConn to its first Big East regular season and tournament title, along with its first-ever NCAA tournament appearance at a #8 seed; the tournament ended in a first round loss to #9 seed La Salle, 72–63. With Bascom and teammates Laura Lishness, Megan Pattyson, Wendy Davis and Debbie Baer, UConn reached the NCAA Tournament again in 1990 as a #4 seed, losing 61–59 to Clemson in the second round after a first-round bye.[11] In Auriemma's 6th season (1990–91) the Huskies broke through on the national scene, again capturing the Big East regular season and tournament titles, and earning a #3 seed in the East Regional of the NCAA Tournament, its highest seed up to then. UConn beat Toledo 81–80 at Gampel Pavilion in the opening round, with Bascom scoring an NCAA tournament single-game record 39 points. The Huskies then moved on to the regionals at The Palestra in Auriemma's hometown of Philadelphia. Here, the team upset heavily favored ACC power North Carolina State in the Sweet 16 by 11 points, and then defeated Clemson 60–57 in the Elite Eight to advance to their first-ever Final Four (also a first for any Big East school). UConn's season ended with a 61–55 loss to top-seeded Virginia in the national semifinals at Lakefront Arena in New Orleans. Bascom was hit with early foul trouble and Virginia held off a late UConn rally. Including all tournament games, Bascom had set a new UConn scoring record with 2,177 points during her years at the school.[12] The 1990–91 season is widely credited with bringing UConn's women's basketball program into the national spotlight for the first time. It also followed the men's 1989–90 \"Dream Season,\" which brought that program into the national spotlight as well. UConn followed up its surprise run to the Final Four in 1991 by landing All-American Rebecca Lobo from Southwick, Massachusetts. UConn had modest success in Lobo's first 2 seasons, losing early in the NCAA Tournament in both seasons. In 1993–94, UConn had its most successful season up to that point;[13] led by Lobo and teammates Jamelle Elliott, Jennifer Rizzotti, Pam Webber, Kara Wolters and Carla Berube, UConn won 30 games for the first time in program history, winning the Big East tournament and regular-season titles. In the NCAA tournament, UConn reached the Elite Eight but came up short in its hopes to make it back to the Final Four, losing to eventual champion North Carolina. With every major player back from 1994, and the addition of Auriemma's most highly ranked recruit to date (Connecticut Player of the Year Nykesha Sales), UConn was in for a season to remember in 1994–95.[14] The season started with an 80-point win over Morgan State; two weeks later, UConn defeated powerhouse North Carolina State by 23 points on the road. This season also saw the birth of one of the greatest rivalries in college sports, the UConn-Tennessee rivalry, that began when the two teams met for the first time on Martin Luther King Day at Gampel Pavilion. UConn defeated Tennessee 77–66 in front of a sold-out crowd in a game televised on ESPN and soon afterwards became ranked No. 1 in the polls for the first time in program history. UConn went unbeaten through the Conference regular season and Tournament and easily advanced into the NCAA tournament. In the Elite Eight against Virginia, a 4-point win (their closest game of the year) secured the team's place in the Final Four at the Target Center in Minneapolis.[15] UConn blew out Stanford in the National semifinals 87–60, reaching the championship for a rematch against Tennessee. In the championship game, UConn found itself in early trouble when Lobo was called for three personal fouls in 94 seconds in the first half. However, in the second half the team was able to rally from a 9-point deficit, and a key Rizzotti layup gave UConn the lead with less than 2 minutes to go. UConn won the game with a final score of 70–64 and claimed their first ever national title. Rebecca Lobo was named the Final Four's Most Outstanding Player. With a perfect 35–0 record, UConn became only the fifth Division I women's basketball team to go undefeated en route to a national championship, and only the second since the NCAA era began in 1982. The Huskies also became the first unbeaten team in NCAA history, all divisions, men or women, to win 35 games in a season.[16] The 1994–95 UConn team was widely credited with increasing interest in women's basketball.[17] The team was honored with a parade in Hartford, CT, that drew over 100,000 spectators. The team won the Team of the Year Award at the ESPN ESPY awards that year, and Lobo became a popular symbol of the sport. UConn also signed a landmark deal during the season with Connecticut Public Television to broadcast their games.[18] Lobo graduated in 1995, receiving countless accolades: the Naismith College Player of the Year award, the Wade Trophy, the Associated Press Women's College Basketball Player of the Year award, the USBWA Women's National Player of the Year award, the Honda-Broderick Cup, the Best Female Athlete ESPY Award (first basketball player ever), the Associated Press Athlete of the Year (second basketball player after Sheryl Swoopes), the NCAA Woman of the Year Award, the Academic All-America of the Year, and made the All-sports Academic All-America of the Year. In 2010 Lobo became the first Connecticut player inducted into the Women's Basketball Hall of Fame, among a class of six inductees,[19] followed by teammate Jennifer Rizzotti in the class of 2013.[20] After the 1995 Championship title, UConn rose to national prominence as one of the powerhouses in women's college basketball, giving coach Auriemma the chance to recruit star talents from high school like Shea Ralph in 1996 and Svetlana Abrosimova in 1997. Starting with their two meetings in 1995, the rivalry between the Tennessee Lady Vols and UConn escalated through the late 1990s and into the 2000s, becoming the marquee matchup in all women's sports, and taking on parallels to the Red Sox-Yankees rivalry in Major League Baseball. Geno Auriemma jokingly once referred to Pat Summitt and Tennessee as the \"evil empire\", like Red Sox president and CEO Larry Lucchino said of the Yankees.[21] In the 1995–96 season, UConn ended Tennessee's home court winning streak at Thompson–Boling Arena in Knoxville. Tennessee avenged itself in the Final Four that year in Charlotte, defeating UConn 88–83 in overtime; the game is often thought to be one of the more memorable tournament games in tournament history with many back and forth swings of momentum.[22] UConn defeated Tennessee during the 1996–97 regular season; after a season-ending injury for Shea Ralph in the first round of the NCAA tournament, UConn reached the Regional Final where the two teams met again, with Tennessee prevailing and ending Connecticut's unbeaten season by winning 91–81.[23] Tennessee defeated Connecticut again in the 1997–98 regular season. A mini controversy erupted in the days after the game when Tennessee's Chamique Holdsclaw was quoted in the papers as saying UConn looked scared during the game; Auriemma denounced that quote.[24] With Shea Ralph and senior Nykesha Sales out for the entire season, freshman Svetlana Abrosimova led a young UConn team to the NCAA Tournament Regional Final, where they eventually lost to North Carolina State 60–52. Auriemma found himself in a national debate following a decision he made during the 1997–98 season. Senior Nykesha Sales suffered a season-ending injury in one of the final games of the regular season. At the time of her injury, she was only one point shy of Kerry Bascom's school scoring record. The next game, with Bascom's blessing, and assistance from friend and Villanova head coach Harry Perretta, Auriemma arranged to have Sales, who was on crutches, score a basket and then allow Villanova to score a basket to start the game at 2–2. Sales then held the school scoring record.[25] Many people weighed in on the decision on both national and local levels. Auriemma felt guilty that he put Sales through the ordeal and was angry that some columnists chose to fault her and not him. Auriemma was criticized for compromising the integrity of the game, but defended the decision saying it was a school record and he would never have done it without Bascom's blessing.[26] Auriemma signed his best recruiting class to date in 1998 when he signed five top-15 nationally ranked players. High school All-Americans Swin Cash, Tamika Williams, Sue Bird, Asjha Jones, and Keirsten Walters were dubbed \"TASSK Force\" by Connecticut fans, using the players' initials. The class renewed hope of bringing more championships to UConn after watching archrival Tennessee win three in a row. The first season for the highly ranked class in 1998–99 featured mixed results and featured many injuries: Sue Bird tore her ACL and went out for the season after only 10 games. In their 1999 meeting at Gampel Pavilion, Tennessee prevailed over the Huskies again. During the game there was a scuffle involving Tennessee's Semeka Randall and Connecticut's Svetlana Abrosimova where Randall threw the ball down, hitting Abrosimova's head. UConn fans booed Randall the rest of the game and Tennessee fans later gave her the nickname \"Boo.\"[27] The 1998–99 season ended in the Sweet Sixteen round of the NCAA Tournament, where UConn lost 64–58 to Iowa State, falling short of reaching the Final Four for the third consecutive year. Motivated by their previous disappointing season, UConn returned in 1999–2000 with the clear goal of reaching championship level again. Led by upperclassmen Shea Ralph, Kelly Schumacher, Svetlana Abrosimova and the TASS Force (the K was dropped when Keirsten Walters had to give up basketball due to knee problems), UConn went through the regular season with a 27–1 record, with their only loss being a single-point defeat to Tennessee at home. The Huskies advanced to their first Final Four since 1996 and defeated Penn State in the semifinals. The team then met the Lady Vols for the championship game in Auriemma's hometown of Philadelphia. Despite the two regular season meetings being close battles, UConn used tenacious defense and backdoor cuts to overwhelm Tennessee 71–52 for their second national championship. Connecticut's final season record was 36–1 and Shea Ralph was named the Final Four's MVP.[28] Auriemma pulled off another huge recruiting coup when he convinced All-American guard Diana Taurasi to travel across country to attend Connecticut. Taurasi hailed from Chino, California, and attended Don Lugo High School where she was the recipient of the 2000 Cheryl Miller Award, presented by the Los Angeles Times to the best player in southern California. She was also named the 2000 Naismith and Parade Magazine National High School Player of the Year. Taurasi finished her high school career ranked second to Cheryl Miller in state history with 3,047 points.[29] With Taurasi joining the core of the 2000 Championship team, Auriemma confidently predicted another championship in 2001, but the season turned out to be more difficult than expected. UConn won the Big East tournament over Notre Dame in a game remembered for the Bird at the Buzzer shot, but lost key players Abrosimova and Ralph to season-ending injuries.[30] As a consequence, Taurasi had to play a much larger role than anticipated in the NCAA Tournament. She led UConn to the Final Four, but in the National semifinals against Notre Dame in St. Louis, Taurasi had a poor shooting game, and despite UConn having attained a 16-point lead at one point, the team lost 90–75. Notre Dame went on to win its first national championship. As with the 2000 champions, who had also come off a disappointing loss the year before, UConn returned hungrier than ever in 2001–02. With the TASS force in their senior season and Taurasi emerging as a star in her sophomore year, UConn rolled through all its opponents throughout the year and maintained an undefeated record going into the NCAA Tournament. The team easily won the Big East regular season and tournament trophies, defeating Boston College 96–54 in the Big East championship game. In the NCAA Tournament, the Huskies were once again awarded the #1 overall seed and demolished their opponents to advance to their 3rd consecutive Final Four. In the semifinals, UConn used tenacious offensive play to defeat rival Tennessee by a whopping 23 points. In front of a record-breaking crowd at the Alamodome in San Antonio, UConn defeated Oklahoma in the championship game, 82–70, to complete a perfect 39–0 season. The starting five of Bird, Taurasi, Cash, Jones, and Williams is widely regarded as the best starting five in women's college basketball history.[31] The championship game that year shattered ratings for ESPN and at the time was the highest rated college basketball game to air on the network, men's or women's.[32] With the TASS force graduated, Diana Taurasi had to carry most of the load in her junior season, with help from returning teammates Maria Conlon, Jessica Moore and Ashley Battle and a top-ranked recruiting class that included Ann Strother, Barbara Turner, Willnet Crockett and Nicole Wolff. With no seniors on the roster, 2003 was supposed to be a rebuilding year for UConn, but as the year progressed it became clear that Taurasi was up to the challenge of carrying a group of young players to the championship game. UConn finished the regular season undefeated and established a 70-game winning streak, shattering the previous mark of 54 set by Louisiana Tech; the streak ended in the Big East championship game with a 52–48 loss to Villanova.[33] In the NCAA Tournament, UConn easily advanced to the Final Four at the Georgia Dome in Atlanta. UConn rallied from a 9-point deficit to beat Texas 71–69 in the semifinals and, aided by Taurasi's 28 points in the finals, defeated rival Tennessee 73–68 to claim the program's fourth national championship. The Huskies became the first team ever to win a championship without a senior on their roster.[34][35] Although the entire team returned and expectations were sky high for a \"three-peat\" in Taurasi's senior year, UConn had an uneven season. The team gave up large leads against Duke and suffered losses to Notre Dame and Villanova, also losing to Boston College in the semifinals of the Big East tournament. The Huskies found their rhythm during the NCAA Tournament, in which they were a #2 seed; in the Elite Eight they beat top-seeded Penn State 66–49 to advance to their 5th straight Final Four at the New Orleans Arena. After beating Minnesota in the national semifinals, UConn again defeated Tennessee to win their 3rd consecutive national championship, winning 70–61. The win was even more special as the UConn men's basketball team won the men's national championship the previous night, marking the first time one University won both the men's and women's basketball championships in one season, a feat UConn repeated in 2014. In her career at UConn, Taurasi led the team to four consecutive Final Fours and three straight national titles. Prior to that final championship, her coach, Geno Auriemma, predicted his team's likelihood of winning with the statement, \"We have Diana, and you don't.\"[36] Taurasi received many personal accolades at UConn including the 2003 and 2004 Naismith College Player of the Year awards, the 2003 Wade Trophy, the 2003 Associated Press Women's College Basketball Player of the Year award, the 2003 USBWA Women's National Player of the Year award and the 2004 Best Female Athlete ESPY Award. Taurasi was the third basketball player to receive this final honor, after former UConn star Rebecca Lobo and Tennessee star Chamique Holdsclaw. She achieved legendary status among UConn fans, and is widely considered one of the greatest players of all time.[37] Relative to their high standards, UConn struggled during the first two years following Taurasi's graduation in 2004. Some of its highly touted recruits did not play up to expectations while others suffered injuries. Taken together during the three years 2005–2007, UConn never made a Final Four, something that had become almost routine (7 final fours in 10 years from 1995 to 2004). The 2004–05 season was marked with sloppy play and ragged offense; UConn lost 8 games and failed to win the Big East regular season crown for the first time since 1993. In the NCAA tournament, UConn lost to Stanford in the Sweet Sixteen.[38] In the 2005–06 season, UConn showed some signs of improvement, winning the Big East tournament and beating Georgia in the Sweet Sixteen thanks to a fadeaway 3-pointer with 1.8 seconds left by senior Barbara Turner.[39] Behind a home state crowd, UConn almost upset #1 ranked Duke in the regional final, before falling in overtime by 2 points.[40] In the 2006–07 season, the team improved their record with the additions of Renee Montgomery, Mel Thomas, Ketia Swanier, and the #1 ranked high school player Tina Charles, helping UConn emerge as a national contender again. UConn was a #1 seed in the NCAA tournament, but eventually lost to LSU in the regional final to end the season with a 32–4 record.[41] After three down years by UConn standards, the team emerged as a heavy contender for the championship in the 2007–08 season. In addition to all of the star players returning from the 2006–07 team, #1 ranked high school player Maya Moore joined the Huskies after a bitter recruitment battle between UConn and Tennessee. Shortly after Moore's commitment to UConn, Tennessee announced they were cancelling the annual series with UConn, thus ending one of the biggest rivalries in the sport. Even if both coaches remained vague and unspecific about the reasons of the cancellation, Tennessee filed a complaint to the NCAA about UConn's recruitment of Moore. UConn was found to have committed a secondary violation (involving a tour of the ESPN campus) and no punishment was handed out.[42][43] Despite losing Mel Thomas and Kalana Greene to season-ending knee injuries, UConn went through the 2007–08 regular season with only a single loss at Rutgers, by two points, winning both the Big East regular season and tournament titles. Rallying from a 14-point deficit in the NCAA regional final, they beat conference rival Rutgers 66–56 and advanced to their first Final Four since Taurasi graduated in 2004. These tournament victories were largely credited to senior Charde Houston, a top-ranked recruit out of San Diego viewed as not living up to expectations from Geno Auriemma and the UConn fans up to that point, who came up with key rebounds and clutch points in those games.[44] In the National semifinals, played at the St. Pete Times Forum in Tampa, UConn lost to Stanford 82–73, ending its season with a 36–2 record. For the third consecutive year, UConn successfully recruited the top ranked high school player in Elena Delle Donne, but shortly before enrolling at UConn Delle Donne requested a release from her scholarship, giving up basketball in order to stay closer to home and play volleyball at the University of Delaware; Delle Donne would eventually play basketball at Delaware, having a great college career that culminated in the #2 pick in the 2013 WNBA draft.[45] Despite losing Delle Donne, the Huskies were ranked No. 1 in the preseason polls, having returned 10 players from their 2008 Final Four team (including All-Americans Maya Moore, Renee Montgomery and Tina Charles), in addition to Kalana Greene (who had recovered from her knee injury by this point). UConn finished the regular season undefeated for the 5th time in school history with a 30–0 record. They won their 17th Big East Regular Season title and their 15th Big East tournament title, beating the Louisville Cardinals in the championship game. The Huskies advanced to their 10th Final Four with an 83–64 victory over Arizona State, and then to their 6th NCAA Championship Game in program history by defeating Stanford, also by a score of 83–64. In the Championship Game, UConn defeated Louisville 76–54 with help from Charles' 25 points and 19 boards, ending the season with a perfect 39–0 record (with every victory by at least 10 points, a record of its own) and sixth national title.[46] For the second consecutive year (and the sixth time in school history), UConn finished their regular season undefeated, with an average margin of victory of 35.9 points. During the regular season, UConn played 11 games against ranked opponents (including 6 in the top ten), winning by an average margin of 24 points per game. They dominated the Big East tournament yet again, winning the championship game 60–32. Throughout the regular season and the Big East tournament, UConn's closest win was against Stanford, by 12 points. Leading up to the Final Four in San Antonio, UConn dominated teams from Southern, Temple, Iowa State and Florida State. Maya Moore and Tina Charles played little more than half the minutes of every game, with Moore averaging one point per minute played, and the team outscoring its opponents by an average of 47 points. In the Final Four UConn was finally challenged by Baylor and the 6-foot-8 freshman Brittney Griner;[47] Baylor trailed 39–26 at halftime, cut the deficit to 41–38 with 15 minutes remaining in the game, but UConn finally pulled away for a final score of 70–50. The national championship game against Stanford was a different story. UConn started the game with its worst first half in school history by scoring only 12 points; only 11 teams in tournament history have been held to 12 points or less in the first half: three of them were against UConn teams, and two of them (Southern and Temple) just days earlier in the 2010 Tournament. Stanford itself only managed to score 20 points in the first half. Maya Moore gave UConn the lead (23–22) in the second half with a three-pointer and led the team on a scoring run of 30–6 that eventually secured the national championship with a final score of 53–47.[48] It was the only game in the Huskies' 78-game winning streak that was won by fewer than 10 points. Moore was named the Tournament Most Outstanding Player, to go along with her second straight Wade Trophy award and Academic All-America of the Year award. Charles, who won the John R. Wooden Award and Naismith College Player of the Year awards,[49] was chosen first overall in the WNBA draft days later.[50] The 2010–11 season began with high hopes but much uncertainty for the Huskies. Maya Moore returned for her senior season after a summer with the U.S. National team, but UConn lost major contributors in Tina Charles and Kalana Greene, who graduated in 2010. Additionally, junior guard Caroline Doty would be out the entire season due to a third knee injury. In an early test, UConn squeaked by #2 Baylor in their second game of the season. They powered their way through 8 more consecutive wins for their 88th straight victory, beating #10 Ohio State at Madison Square Garden. Their 89th win came at home against #20 Florida State to set the college basketball record for most consecutive wins, previously held by the UCLA men's team. After a break in the schedule for the holidays, UConn traveled out west and beat the Pacific Tigers to stretch the streak to 90 games.[51] That game, however, was largely a warm-up match for their biggest test of the season, a December 30 matchup at the powerhouse Stanford Cardinals. UConn trailed for the entire game and lost for the first time since their April 6, 2008, Final Four appearance (also against the Cardinals). The loss ended the highly publicized winning streak, as well as their long-held spot as the top ranked team in women's basketball which was taken over by Baylor. Connecticut recovered focus after the loss and got through the rest of the regular season undefeated, regaining the #1 ranking along the way after Baylor's loss to Texas Tech in February. They marched through and won the Big East tournament, including their 3rd victory of the year over Notre Dame in the Big East tournament Championship Game. In the NCAA tournament Final Four, UConn met Notre Dame for the fourth time of the season, with the underdog Fighting Irish prevailing 72–63 and ending UConn's bid for a third straight national championship. The keys to Notre Dame's success were the stellar performance of sophomore Skylar Diggins and the hot shooting (over 50 percent from the field, a first against UConn in its last 262 games), while UConn had a lack of support for Moore's 36 points.[52] Notre Dame went on to the National Championship Game, but were ultimately defeated by the Texas A&M Aggies. During the 2010–11 season, Maya Moore posted career highs in scoring (22.3 ppg), assists (4.1 apg) and steals (2.2 spg), sweeping all possible individual honors: she won her 2nd Naismith College Player of the Year award, her 3rd straight Wade Trophy (only player in history - freshmen are not eligible for this award), her 2nd Associated Press Women's College Basketball Player of the Year award, her 2nd USBWA Women's National Player of the Year award and her 2nd John R. Wooden Award; she was also voted Big East Player of The Year (3rd time) and a fourth straight unanimous First-Team All-American in WBCA, USBWA and AP polls (second player ever after Oklahoma's Courtney Paris). In her astounding college career, Maya Moore won 150 games and only lost 4, amassing a total 3036 points (1st Husky ever and 4th all-time in NCAA division I women's basketball), 1276 rebounds (2nd Husky ever), 310 steals (3rd Husky ever), 544 assists (6th Husky ever) and 204 blocks (4th Husky ever); she is the only women's basketball player in Division I history to record 2500 points, 1000 rebounds, 500 assists, 250 steals and 150 blocked shots. On February 28, she was enshrined in the Huskies of Honor (3rd time ever for an active player). Maya Moore was also a brilliant college student: she graduated with a 3.7 GPA, earning the Elite 88 Award, and was named Cosida Academic All-America First-Team in 2009, 2010 and 2011, Cosida Academic All-America of the Year in 2010 and 2011 (1st player to ever repeat) and All-sports Academic All-America of the Year in 2011.[53] After graduation, Maya Moore was selected by the Minnesota Lynx as the 1st overall pick in the 2011 WNBA draft (4th time for a Husky), also becoming the first female basketball player signed to the Jordan Brand.[54] The 2011–12 season would inevitably be a new era after Maya Moore's graduation. Her absence and the loss of 6th-man Lorin Dixon left significant holes to fill in the roster. Geno Auriemma seemed to find the right pieces with a freshman class that included Kaleena Mosqueda-Lewis, Brianna Banks and Kiah Stokes. Mosqueda-Lewis was another State Farm/WBCA High School Player of the Year for UConn,[55] Banks was a highly rated point guard,[56] and Stokes, a 6'3 post player, was highly ranked as well. Other key players included sophomores Stefanie Dolson and Bria Hartley, junior Kelly Faris and senior Tiffany Hayes, who would be all selected in the WNBA draft after graduation. Even if the Huskies were still a strong national contender, they were no longer viewed as a favorite to win it all. Two key rivals were the usual conference foe Notre Dame and the new rival Baylor, who had the nation's top player in Brittney Griner. In December Griner led #1 ranked Baylor against #2 UConn, scoring 25 points to go along with nine blocks. The 66–61 loss was UConn's first of the season, but not its last. Notre Dame, led by junior star Skylar Diggins, beat the Huskies twice in the regular season, but UConn was able to reverse the roles in the Big East tournament Championship Game; the win was the school's 15th conference title, as well as the 800th career win for coach Geno Auriemma. Ultimately Notre Dame found its revenge with an upset win in the NCAA Tournament Final Four, winning in overtime 83–75. The Fighting Irish finished the season with a 3–1 record against the Huskies, a record that would be repeated the following year. The 2012–13 season began with high hopes for UConn. The team landed three highly ranked recruits: #1 overall Breanna Stewart from Cicero – North Syracuse High School, forward Morgan Tuck and guard Moriah Jefferson. Their play was uneven during the regular season, where the team went 27–3 with a loss to Baylor and a pair of losses to Notre Dame (including a three-overtime game in South Bend); in the Big East tournament, UConn lost for a third straight time to Notre Dame, who delivered a last-minute comeback to win 61–59. However, in the NCAA tournament, key-players Stewart, Kaleena Mosqueda-Lewis, Stefanie Dolson and senior Kelly Faris raised their level of play significantly, and UConn easily advanced to the Final Four. In the National Semifinals, the team handily beat Notre Dame 83–65, a rematch of the 2012 Final Four. Two days later, the Huskies obtained a 93–60 win over Louisville in the championship game to garner a record tying eighth national championship. UConn finished the season with a 35–4 overall record, with 3 of their losses to Notre Dame. The end of the 2012–13 season saw the breakup of the Big East Conference. First Pittsburgh, Syracuse, and Notre Dame defected to the Atlantic Coast Conference, with Louisville announcing that they would follow in 2014. Then, the non-FBS football playing members of the Big East (Georgetown, Villanova, Providence, DePaul, Marquette, Seton Hall, St. John's), known colloquially as the \"Catholic 7\", left to form their own conference, taking the conference name with them. The remaining teams of the former Big East (Connecticut and Cincinnati) joined the new American Athletic Conference (The American or AAC), thus ending the UConn–Notre Dame rivalry in conference tournaments.[57] With Faris and Doty graduated, sophomore Breanna Stewart became the undisputed leader of the 2013–14 UConn team, starting in all 40 games and leading the team with 19.4 points and 2.8 blocks per game; her 291 field goals made was the third-highest single-season total in UConn history. The Huskies beat every opponent by at least 10 points, with their average margin being 34 points, and easily reached the NCAA tournament finals. In the Final Four, the Huskies routed No. 3 Stanford with a 75–56 victory to advance to the championship game. There, they met unbeaten Notre Dame, making it the first matchup of two undefeated teams in the championship game. UConn defeated Notre Dame 79–58 (hindered by the loss of one of their stars, Natalie Achonwa, who had torn her ACL in the Elite Eight) to finish the season 40–0, tying Baylor for the most wins in a season and setting a new record for national championships with nine.[58] Breanna Stewart was named the AP Player of the year, only the third time in history a sophomore has won the honor. With the UConn men's basketball team winning the championship in 2014 as well, UConn became the only school in NCAA history to have both their men's and women's teams win a national championship in the same year, and do it twice (first time was 2004). The 2014–15 regular season started with an overtime loss to Stanford in the team's second game of the season, ending a 47-game winning streak for UConn. Led by juniors Stewart and Jefferson, as well as senior Kaleena Mosqueda-Lewis, UConn quickly recovered and won every remaining regular season game, including a 76–58 win against rival Notre Dame. In the NCAA Tournament, both Connecticut and Notre Dame were seeded first in their respective playoff brackets; each advanced to the Final Four as well. Connecticut handily defeated Maryland 81–58, while Notre Dame narrowly beat South Carolina, 66–65, in the National Semifinals. The two teams met on April 7, 2015, in the national championship game. UConn won by a score of 63–53 to achieve their third straight national championship and tenth total, with coach Auriemma tying a record set by John Wooden in college basketball.[59] The Huskies 10-point margin of victory in the championship game was their smallest since 2010. Their margins of victory in the 2013, 2014, and 2016 championship games were all above 20 points. UConn finished the season with a 38–1 overall record (18–0 in AAC play). In 2015 UConn landed another top recruit in #1 High School prospect Katie Lou Samuelson; she quickly earned a spot in the starting five alongside sophomore Kia Nurse and seniors Breanna Stewart, Moriah Jefferson and Morgan Tuck. The team was unstoppable all season long, beating every opponent by an average of 39.7 points, and easily winning the conference regular season and tournament. While other #1 seeds Notre Dame, South Carolina and Baylor suffered early upsets in the NCAA Tournament, UConn easily advanced to the Final Four, where they defeated Oregon State 80–51. In the championship game, the Huskies defeated old Big East rival Syracuse 82–51 to complete their sixth undefeated season, while also winning their 11th overall championship and 4th consecutive one. Geno Auriemma became the only coach in college basketball history to have won 11 titles, surpassing UCLA legend John Wooden (who has 10).[60] UConn finished the season with a perfect 38–0 record. Senior Breanna Stewart was named the Final Four Most Outstanding Player for a record 4th straight time; she also performed a back-to-back sweep of all individual honors, winning her 2nd straight Wade Trophy, a record 3rd Associated Press Women's College Basketball Player of the Year award, a record 3rd USBWA Women's National Player of the Year award, a record 3rd Naismith College Player of the Year award and her 2nd straight John R. Wooden Award. Stewart finished with 2,676 points (2nd Husky ever), 1,179 rebounds (4th Husky ever), 426 assists and 414 blocked shots (1st Husky ever). She was also the #1 overall pick in the 2016 WNBA draft.[61] Moriah Jefferson finished with a program-record 659 assists and a back-to-back Nancy Lieberman Award as best point guard in the nation. The trio of Stewart-Jefferson-Tuck ended their college career with a 151–5 record, the most victories for any group of college basketball players; they are the only 4-time winners in college basketball history (freshmen were not eligible to play during the UCLA men's streak). With their eleventh championship win in 2016, the UConn Huskies tied the UCLA Bruins men's team for most college basketball championships, and became the first Division I women's basketball team to win four straight national championships. After losing the stellar trio of Stewart, Jefferson and Tuck, many predicted a sub-par season for UConn standards; the AP Poll ranked the team third in the nation, and coach Auriemma had designed a very tough non-conference calendar to test the strength of his young team. The first regular season game, a 2-point win against #12 Florida State, seemed to confirm the expectations, with coach Auriemma predicting \"a good beat\" ahead.[62] As the season progressed, however, the team quickly found its rhythm, beating ranked teams like Baylor, Notre Dame and Maryland, and showcasing a talented core of young players. With sophomore Katie Lou Samuelson and junior Kia Nurse, the only returning starters, the duo of sophomore Napheesa Collier and junior Gabby Williams quickly rose to national attention; even senior Saniya Chong, who had played only few minutes in her first three seasons, showed great improvements, leading the nation in assists-to-turnovers ratio.[63] Coming from a 75-win streak in the previous season, UConn tied its own previous 90-win record with a 102–37 win against South Florida on January 10, 2017;[64] the 100th straight win mark was reached on February 13, 2017, with a 66–55 win against South Carolina.[65] After easy wins in both the conference regular season and conference tournament, UConn entered the NCAA tournament unbeaten, #1 overall, and once again a heavy favorite to win it all. However, the season came to an unexpected end when Mississippi State's Morgan William hit a buzzer-beater to give its team a 66–64 overtime victory in the NCAA Final Four.[66] The loss ended the streak at 111 consecutive wins, an all-time record not only for college basketball, but also for any team sport played at the college level.[67] UConn's overall record for the season was 36–1. UConn entered the 2017–18 season with high energy. The team gained a 5-star recruiting class that included future All-American player Megan Walker. On December 19, 2017, a win over Oklahoma gave coach Geno Auriemma his 1000th victory in just 1135 games, making him only the fourth women's coach to reach that plateau — preceded by Pat Summitt, Tara VanDerveer and Sylvia Hatchell — and the fastest one.[68] UConn finished the regular season 16–0 in AAC play to win the AAC regular season championship. The Huskies ultimately defeated Tulane, Cincinnati, and South Florida to win the AAC women's tournament title. As a result, they received the conference's automatic bid to the NCAA women's tournament. As the overall No. 1 seed again, they defeated Saint Francis (PA) and Quinnipiac to advance to the Sweet Sixteen. They then defeated Duke in the Sweet Sixteen and South Carolina in the Elite Eight to reach their 19th Final Four. In the National semifinals, they lost in overtime on a last-second shot for the second consecutive year, this time to Notre Dame, ending an undefeated season yet again. Notre Dame would go onto win the national championship with a buzzer-beater against Mississippi State. The Huskies ended their season with a 36–1 overall record for the second straight year. UConn entered the 2018–19 season with another 5-star recruiting class that included Christyn Williams, a highly decorated high-school guard and future 2-time All-Big East First Team player. The team started the year with an 11–0 run, which included an 89–71 win at No. 1 Notre Dame on December 2. The Huskies were ranked #1 in the nation for the next 5 weeks until they lost their first game at No. 8 Baylor on January 3, 2019. Baylor would go on to win the title later in the year against Notre Dame. UConn again finished their regular season with a record of 16–0 in AAC play to win the AAC regular season championship. Ranked #2 in the nation at the start of their conference tournament, the Huskies defeated East Carolina, South Florida, and UCF to win the AAC women's tournament title for the 6th straight year. As a result, they received the conference's automatic bid to the NCAA women's tournament. As a No. 2 seed, UConn defeated Towson and Buffalo to advance to the Sweet Sixteen. Then, they defeated UCLA in the Sweet Sixteen and Louisville in the Elite Eight to reach their 20th Final Four. In the National semifinals, they lost in the rematch of last year's game to Notre Dame, 81–76. UConn ended the season with a 35–3 overall record, their worst since 2013. UConn began the 2019–20 season with a 12–0 run and reached #1 in the AP poll by New Year's Day. Their first loss was against No. 8 Baylor on January 9, 2020, at the XL Center. The Huskies lost twice more against No. 3 Oregon and at No. 1 South Carolina during the regular season. At the conclusion of the 2019–20 regular season, UConn had a record of 26–3. They went 16–0 in the AAC and were the conference regular season champions. Then, they won the AAC tournament for the 7th year in a row, defeating Cincinnati in the title game 87–53 on March 9, 2020. UConn received an automatic bid to the 2020 NCAA Division I women's basketball tournament, but the tournament was cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The team finished the season ranked number 5 in the AP poll, and with a 29–3 overall record. This was the last year that the Huskies played in the American Athletic Conference, as they left to join several of their former conference mates in the Big East Conference in July 2020. UConn dominated women's basketball during their time in the American, going undefeated in all seven of their regular seasons in AAC play and winning every conference tournament during their membership. The Huskies entered the 2020–2021 season with extremely high hopes. They gained two ESPN five-star recruits with the addition of point guard Paige Bueckers and forward Aaliyah Edwards, as well as future 2-time Big East Defensive Player of the Year Nika Mühl. This season also marked the teams return to the Big East Conference, which they had previously left in 2013 to join the AAC. UConn was ranked no. 3 in both the AP and Coaches pre-season polls. During the regular season, they had a record of 21–1, including 18–0 in the Big East to win the conference regular season championship. UConn won the Big East tournament, winning all three of their games by over 30 points. As a no. 1 seed in the NCAA tournament, they won their region with a narrow victory over no. 5 ranked Baylor in the Elite Eight, 69–67. UConn then lost to Arizona in the Final Four, 69–59, and finished their campaign with a record of 28–2. Bueckers, the team's leading scorer, won several awards at the end of the season, including the Naismith College Player of the Year. The season was heavily affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, with numerous game cancellations and no spectators allowed at any sporting events. Returning from a 28–2 season with no graduations, UConn went into the 2021–22 season highly regarded, starting the season ranked 2nd in the AP poll. The Huskies returned three seniors and sophomore consensus 2020–21 NCAA player of the year Paige Bueckers, while adding a 2nd ranked recruiting class that included number-one ranked high school recruit Azzi Fudd. Several athletes transferred during the offseason and early season, leaving the team with 12 players. Effects of the COVID-19 pandemic continued to cause game postponements and cancellations. Injuries plagued the team; only two athletes played every game. In December, Bueckers suffered a knee fracture which kept her sidelined until late in the season. With Bueckers out, UConn's offense struggled against several teams, with losses against unranked Georgia Tech and no. 6 Louisville before semester break, no. 9 Oregon in January, and unranked Big East Conference opponent Villanova in February. Coach Auriemma had the team focus on defense, keeping the Huskies in games when their offense was struggling. Nine different players started, and Auriemma tried eleven different starting lineups during the season. By the time Bueckers returned to the lineup for limited minutes, the Huskies were dominating without her. After winning the Big East regular season championship, the team won the 2022 Big East tournament and accepted an automatic bid to the 2022 NCAA Division I tournament, where they were awarded a No. 2 seed. In the NCAA tournament, in the Bridgeport Region, UConn beat 15th seed Mercer, 7th seed UCF, 3rd seed Indiana and 1st seed NC State in double overtime to reach the Final Four for a record 14th consecutive year. They then beat long-time rival and defending national champions Stanford 63–58 to reach the national championship game for the first time since 2016.[69] However, they ultimately lost to the number one overall seed South Carolina, 64–49. UConn entered the 2022–23 season with six returning starters, including the backcourt of Paige Bueckers, Azzi Fudd, and Nika Mühl, as well as forwards Dorka Juhász, Aaliyah Edwards, and Caroline Ducharme. With this line-up, UConn was expected to win the much-improved Big East again and be highly competitive in the NCAA tournament. However, the team became plagued by injuries before the season even began. Bueckers tore an ACL in a pickup game before fall workouts, and five-star recruit Ice Brady suffered a tendon dislocation during an early practice; both players underwent season ending surgeries and sat on the bench all season.[70][71] UConn ultimately finished their regular season with an overall record of 26–5 and a conference record of 18–2. They won the Big East regular season championship and were the top seed in the Big East tournament. Azzi Fudd and Caroline Ducharme, who both missed a significant part of the regular season due to injury, returned in time for the conference tournament. With the UConn squad healthy for the first time since its first games, the Huskies methodically notched three consecutive wins to emerge as the Big East champions, getting the automatic bid to the 2023 NCAA women's basketball tournament, where they were awarded a No. 2 seed. The team advanced to the Sweet 16, where they lost to No. 3-seeded Ohio State, 73–61.[72] This was the first time the team failed to make the Final Four since 2007, and was also the first time they had failed to make the Elite Eight since 2005. After gaining a high school recruiting class ranked #4 in the nation, UConn entered the 2023–24 season ranked second in pre-season polls. However, they lost three early non-conference games and several key players to injury by midseason. On February 7, 2024, Geno Auriemma became just the third college basketball coach to reach 1,200 wins when the Huskies defeated Seton Hall.[73] Later that season, UConn won the 2024 Big East Tournament and was awarded a No. 3 seed in the Portland 3 regional of the 2024 NCAA tournament. Despite being plagued by injuries yet again, the Huskies defeated No. 1-seeded USC 80–73 in the Elite Eight to advance to the Final Four in what Geno Auriemma described as the teams most surprising run since their first Final Four appearance in 1991.[74] However, the team narrowly lost to No. 1-seeded Iowa in the National semifinals, 71–69.[75] National champion Postseason invitational champion Conference regular season champion Conference regular season and conference tournament champion Division regular season champion Division regular season and conference tournament champion Conference tournament champion UConn played in the Big East Conference from the 1982–83 season, the first in which the league sponsored women's basketball and held a tournament, until the conference split in 2013. The Huskies won 18 tournaments in 31 years.[77] From 2013–14 to 2019–20, UConn played in the American Athletic Conference, where they went unbeaten both in regular season and conference tournament games, with a perfect 139–0 record and 7 conference tournaments. In 2020–21, UConn rejoined several of its former conference mates in the current Big East Conference.[57] The Huskies have appeared in the NCAA tournament 34 times, every year since their first appearance in 1989. Their combined record is 128–24 .842; they have been to 23 Final Fours and are 11-time National Champions (1995, 2000, 2002, 2003, 2004, 2009, 2010, 2013, 2014, 2015, 2016).[78] The following lists where the Huskies have been seeded in the NCAA tournament. Sandra Hamm, a Terryville native, was employed part-time as the interim women's coach in the 1974–1975 season, when the team was 2–8. When she wasn't coaching, she taught physical education at a junior high school in Manchester.[79] After graduating from college in California, Wanda Flora went to graduate school at Indiana University, where she was an assistant coach for the women's basketball team and coached the junior varsity team. After a brief stint at a small college in Pennsylvania, she applied for the job at UConn, starting in 1975 and leading the team to a 38–66 record in five seasons. During her tenure, shooting guard Karen Mullins was the first UConn woman to receive a basketball scholarship; that number had increased to 12 by 1980. In 1980 the university hired Jean Balthaser, who had coached at the University of Pittsburgh. Ms. Balthaser continued to expand the program, leading UConn to its first winning season in her first year as coach, and finishing with a 52–88 record over five seasons. In his 38 years as head coach of the University of Connecticut women's basketball team, the Italian-born Luigi \"Geno\" Auriemma has inextricably linked his name with that of the team. Inheriting a program that had only had one winning season in its entire history, Auriemma has overseen one of the most successful rebuilding projects in college sports history. Under his watch, UConn has become the winningest team in women's college basketball, and he has made a strong case as one of the best coaches ever.[80][81][82] In his astonishing career Auriemma has won more than 25 different national Coach of the Year awards and was inducted into both the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame and the Women's Basketball Hall of Fame. He was head coach of the United States women's national basketball team from 2009 until stepping down from that role after the 2016 Summer Olympics. During his tenure with Team USA, they won the 2010 and 2014 World Cups, plus Olympic gold medals in 2012 and 2016. UConn has featured a great number of star players, All-Americans, Hall of Famers and recipients of individual trophies. The following table shows the UConn players recipients of the major individual awards in women's college basketball. After the end of the NCAA tournament, the Associated Press selects a Most Outstanding Player. Seven UConn players received this award since its induction in 1982: Rebecca Lobo (1995), Sue Bird (2002), Swin Cash (2002), Diana Taurasi (2003 and 2004), Tina Charles (2009), Maya Moore (2010), and Breanna Stewart who won 4 times (2013, 2014, 2015, 2016). Statistics correct through December 17, 2024.[83][84][85][86][87] Players active in 2024-2025 are in bold. Most points (1000-point club) Most rebounds (top-15) Most assists (top-15) Most steals (top-15) Most blocks (top-15) Most 3-Point Field Goals Made (top-15) The Huskies of Honor is a program recognizing the most significant figures in UConn history, with plaques in Gampel Pavilion commemorating the inductees. The women's basketball players list includes guards Sue Bird, Bria Hartley, Moriah Jefferson, Renee Montgomery, Shea Ralph, Jennifer Rizzotti, Nykesha Sales, and Diana Taurasi; forwards Svetlana Abrosimova, Swin Cash, Napheesa Collier, Maya Moore, Kaleena Mosqueda-Lewis, Katie Lou Samuelson, Breanna Stewart, Morgan Tuck, and Gabby Williams; centers Kerry Bascom, Tina Charles, Stefanie Dolson, Rebecca Lobo, and Kara Wolters. On December 7, 2018, UConn announced that the #50 worn by Rebecca Lobo would be permanently retired, effective with ceremonies to be held during the Huskies' final 2018–19 home game on March 2, 2019. In its announcement, UConn stated that going forward, number retirement would be reserved for former Huskies players inducted into the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame, as Lobo was in 2017. At the same time, the Huskies announced that the #34 worn by Ray Allen, a 2018 Naismith Hall inductee, would be retired by UConn men's basketball, with ceremonies held during the season's final men's home game on March 3, 2019.[88] UConn's announcement did not make it clear whether both numbers would be retired across both men's and women's programs, but a university spokesperson clarified that the retirements applied only to the teams that Lobo and Allen competed for, meaning that #50 remains available in men's basketball and #34 in women's.[89] Additionally, on November 14, 2022, UConn retired the #32 worn by Swin Cash, as she was a 2022 Naismith Hall inductee, with ceremonies held during the women's team game against Texas.[90] Twenty UConn players have been selected in the first round of WNBA drafts. Five of them have been first overall picks: Sue Bird (2002), Diana Taurasi (2004), Tina Charles (2010), Maya Moore (2011), and Breanna Stewart (2016). Rebecca Lobo was part of the 1997 inaugural draft, with the top players allocated to founding teams without any particular order; similarly Nykesha Sales was part of the 1998 WNBA expansion players allocation. In the 2002 WNBA draft, the four UConn players tabbed \"TASS Force\" (Tamika Williams, Asjha Jones, Sue Bird, Swin Cash) were all first round selections, each having immediate impact with their WNBA team.[91] In the 2016 WNBA draft UConn performed even better, with the three seniors Breanna Stewart, Moriah Jefferson and Morgan Tuck sweeping the first three picks for the first time in the history of any major sport.[92] Roster Last update: April 28, 2024 Team of the Decade 2000–2009 In 2010 Sports Illustrated selected the top 25 sports franchises of the decade 2000–2009. The sports under consideration were the four major professional sports (NFL, MLB, NBA and NHL) along with the three most prominent college sports: football, men's basketball and women's basketball. The Connecticut Huskies were the #3 selection on the list, behind only the professional basketball Lakers and the professional football Patriots, making the Connecticut women's basketball team the highest ranked of the collegiate teams for the three sports under consideration.[93] During this period, UConn won five national titles, while making the Final Four seven of the ten years. Two of the seasons (2001–02 and 2008–09) resulted in perfect 39–0 records. Active streaks in bold",

                "content": "Paul Edward Goldschmidt (born September 10, 1987), nicknamed \"Goldy\", is an American professional baseball first baseman who is a free agent. He has played in Major League Baseball (MLB) for the Arizona Diamondbacks and St. Louis Cardinals. He has also represented the United States in international competition. Lightly recruited out of The Woodlands High School in The Woodlands, Texas, Goldschmidt played for the Texas State Bobcats, and was selected by the Diamondbacks in the eighth round of the 2009 MLB draft. He made his MLB debut with them in 2011, and they traded him to the Cardinals during the 2018–19 offseason. A seven-time MLB All-Star, Goldschmidt won the National League (NL) Most Valuable Player (MVP) Award in 2022. He has also won two Hank Aaron Awards, four Gold Gloves, and five Silver Slugger Awards, the latter of which is the most among first baseman. While leading the NL in home runs and runs batted in (RBI) in 2013, Goldschmidt won each of an All-Star selection, Hank Aaron, Gold Glove, and Silver Slugger Awards for the first time. He also has twice finished runner-up for the NL MVP Award, in 2013 and 2015. Paul Goldschmidt was born in Wilmington, Delaware, on September 10, 1987,[1] and grew up a Houston Astros fan.[2] His parents, David and Kim, met at the Rochester Institute of Technology in New York.[1] His mother is Catholic and his father is Jewish.[1] Goldschmidt and his two younger brothers were raised Catholic.[1] His Jewish great-grandparents, Paul and Ilse Goldschmidt, and his grandfather, Ernie (who now lives in Fort Lauderdale, Florida), escaped Nazi Germany in 1938 before the Holocaust.[1] Goldschmidt said he and his two brothers \"know our Jewish history and we respect those beliefs. We had both sides of it as kids. My dad's side, my mom's side. We were exposed to all of it.\"[1] The Goldschmidt family moved from Wilmington to Dallas, and then to Houston, because of the flooring company his family owns.[1] He grew up in The Woodlands, which is situated within the Greater Houston area, and attended The Woodlands High School and played for their baseball team. With Goldschmidt playing third base, The Woodlands won the Texas state championship in 2006.[3] Goldschmidt enrolled at Texas State University to play college baseball for the Bobcats. He was named the Southland Conference hitter of the year in 2008 and 2009, Southland player of the year in 2009,[4] and was a third-team All-American as a junior in 2009 after hitting .352 with 18 home runs and 88 runs batted in (RBIs) in 57 games played.[5] Goldschmidt set Bobcat career records with 36 home runs and 179 RBIs.[6] The Los Angeles Dodgers selected Goldschmidt in the 49th round of the 2006 MLB draft.[7] The Dodgers knew he was a long shot to sign with them, but selected him nonetheless. Goldschmidt played with the son of one of the Dodgers' scouts.[8] The Arizona Diamondbacks selected Goldschmidt in the eighth round, with the 246th overall selection, of the 2009 MLB draft.[9] He signed with the Diamondbacks, receiving a $95,000 signing bonus.[10] The Diamondbacks assigned Goldschmidt to the Missoula Osprey of the Rookie-level Pioneer League, where he hit .334 and 18 home runs along with 62 RBIs in his first 74 professional games.[11] The 18 home runs were a Missoula franchise record.[12] The following year, playing for the Visalia Rawhide in the Class A-Advanced California League, he hit 35 home runs, the most for all Class A players, and one behind Mike Moustakas and Mark Trumbo for the Joe Bauman Home Run Award.[13] He was selected as an all-star and won the California League Most Valuable Player Award. He was also named the Arizona Diamondbacks Minor League Player of the Year.[14] In 2011, Goldschmidt played for the Mobile Bay Bears of the Class AA Southern League. He had a .306 batting average, 30 home runs, and 94 RBIs in 103 games played through the end of July, leading all minor leaguers in home runs and RBIs, while his 82 walks was third-best.[15] After the season, Goldschmidt was again named the Diamondbacks' player of the year, a Baseball America first-team Minor League All-Star, Class AA all-star first baseman, Southern League all-star first baseman, and the Southern League's Most Valuable Player.[16] The Diamondbacks promoted Goldschmidt to the major leagues on August 1, 2011.[17] The Diamondbacks intended to platoon Goldschmidt with Xavier Nady.[18] Goldschmidt recorded a base hit in his first MLB at-bat on August 1,[15] and hit his first MLB home run the next day off San Francisco Giants pitcher Tim Lincecum.[12] After Nady broke his wrist in mid-August, the Diamondbacks signed Lyle Overbay to replace him. Goldschmidt credited Overbay for his mentorship.[18] Goldschmidt struck out 20 times in his first 44 MLB at-bats.[12] In his rookie season, Goldschmidt batted .250 with eight home runs and 26 RBI in 48 games.[19] The Diamondbacks made the postseason and played against the Milwaukee Brewers in the 2011 National League Division Series (NLDS). In Game 3, Goldschmidt hit a grand slam to extend the team's lead in its first victory of the series. His home run was the third grand slam by a rookie in MLB postseason history.[20] The Diamondbacks lost the series in five games, and Goldschmidt batted .438 with six RBIs and an OBP of .526.[21] Goldschmidt and Overbay made the Diamondbacks' Opening Day roster in 2012.[22] Goldschmidt hit his first career regular-season grand slam on June 1, 2012, off of Chicago Cubs pitcher Carlos Mármol at Wrigley Field.[23] Four days later, Goldschmidt hit another grand slam off St. Louis Cardinals reliever Maikel Cleto.[24] Overbay played sparingly, and was designated for assignment at the end of July.[25] In 2012, Goldschmidt played 145 games and batted .286 with 20 home runs, 82 runs, 82 RBIs, 43 doubles, and 18 stolen bases.[26] Before the 2013 season, the Diamondbacks and Goldschmidt agreed to a $32 million contract covering the 2014 through 2018 seasons with a club option for the 2019 season worth $14.5 million.[27] He would not have been eligible for salary arbitration until the 2014–15 offseason and free agency until the 2017–18 offseason.[28] Goldschmidt was selected to the National League's team in the 2013 Major League Baseball All-Star Game.[29] Goldschmidt doubled with two outs in the ninth inning, one of only three hits for the National League, and the only extra-base hit.[30] On August 13, he hit a game-tying home run against the Baltimore Orioles in the bottom of the ninth inning to send the game into extra innings. Goldschmidt then hit a walk-off home run in the bottom of the eleventh.[31] Goldschmidt hit a third grand slam on August 20, 2013, against J. J. Hoover of the Cincinnati Reds.[32] In 160 games that season, he attained a .302 batting average, 36 home runs, and 125 RBI.[33] Goldschmidt finished second in the voting for the National League's Most Valuable Player Award, behind Pittsburgh Pirates outfielder Andrew McCutchen.[34] He led MLB with four walk-off hits in 2013.[35] Goldschmidt was the starting first baseman for the National League in the 2014 MLB All-Star Game.[36] In 2014, Goldschmidt batted .300 with 19 home runs, 75 runs, and 69 RBIs. While playing against the Pittsburgh Pirates on August 1, Goldschmidt was hit by a pitch from Ernesto Frieri in the 9th inning. The resulting impact broke a bone in his left hand, which prematurely ended his season.[37] On June 10, 2015, Goldschmidt hit his 100th career home run against Brett Anderson of the Los Angeles Dodgers. At the time of his 100th home run, Goldschmidt was sixth on the Diamondbacks' all-time home run list.[38] Later that year, Goldschmidt was again the starting first baseman for the National League in the All-Star Game. Goldschmidt attained a .321 batting average with 33 home runs and 110 RBIs, with a major-league-leading 29 intentional walks, in 2015.[39] He also was 2nd in the league in power-speed number (25.7).[40] He won his second Gold Glove Award and Silver Slugger Award.[41] For the second time in three seasons, Goldschmidt was voted the runner-up for the National League Most Valuable Player Award, this time finishing behind Washington Nationals outfielder Bryce Harper.[42] In 2016, Goldschmidt batted .297 with 24 home runs, 106 runs, and 95 RBIs in 579 at-bats. He also was third in the league in power–speed number (27.4).[43] He was selected to appear in the 2016 MLB All-Star Game, where he went 0-for-3.[44] On August 3, 2017, Goldschmidt hit three home runs in a game for the first time, bolstering the Diamondbacks' 10–8 win over the Chicago Cubs.[45] For the fifth time in his career, Goldschmidt was named to the National League's All-Star Team. On September 13, 2017, in a game against the Colorado Rockies, Goldschmidt recorded his 1,000th career hit. Goldschmidt finished the 2017 season batting .297 with 36 home runs, 117 runs, and 120 RBIs. He tied for the National League lead in power-speed number (24.0).[46] After the season, Goldschmidt was awarded his third Gold Glove Award and Silver Slugger Award. He also finished third in voting for the National League Most Valuable Player Award.[47] In the 2017 National League Wild Card Game, Goldschmidt hit a three-run home run in the first inning that helped the Diamondbacks to win 11–8 over the Rockies.[48] During the 2017 NLDS, Goldschmidt batted only .091. The Diamondbacks lost the series to the Los Angeles Dodgers.[49] Through the first 20 games in May of the 2018 season, Goldschmidt struggled, managing to get only seven hits out of 73 at-bats (.096). At the time, this lowered his batting average for the season to just .198. Goldschmidt improved in the following month, recording a .390 batting average between June 1 and July 3. In June, he won the National League Player of the Month Award for the first time in his career. His efforts earned him a spot on the All-Star Team for a sixth consecutive year.[50] On August 3, 2018, Goldschmidt hit his 200th career home run against Chris Stratton of the San Francisco Giants.[51] Goldschmidt finished the 2018 season batting .290 with 33 home runs, 95 runs, and 83 RBIs.[52] His 1,088 games played, 209 home runs, 710 RBIs, 1,179 hits, 708 runs scored, and 267 doubles are second in Diamondbacks' history, behind Luis Gonzalez.[53] After the season, the Diamondbacks exercised the $14.5 million option on Goldschmidt's contract for the 2019 season.[54] On December 5, 2018, the Diamondbacks traded Goldschmidt to the St. Louis Cardinals in exchange for Luke Weaver, Carson Kelly, Andy Young, and a Competitive Balance Round B pick in the 2019 MLB draft.[52][55] On March 23, 2019, Goldschmidt and the Cardinals agreed to a five-year contract extension worth $130 million, spanning the 2020–24 seasons.[56] The deal became the largest in team history, eclipsing the seven-year, $120 million contract with Matt Holliday signed in 2010.[57] In his second game with the Cardinals against the Milwaukee Brewers, he hit three home runs and became the first player in Major League history to hit three homers in either his first or second game with a new team.[58] On April 20, 2019, in a game against the New York Mets Goldschmidt hit a 465-foot home run off Paul Sewald that would become both his longest career home run and the longest home run hit at Busch Stadium during the Statcast era. On June 21, 2019, in a game against the Los Angeles Angels, Goldschmidt hit a foul ball that ended up flying over the upper deck seating and out of the stadium, the first such occurrence in the current Busch Stadium.[59] On July 26, 2019, in a game against the Houston Astros, Goldschmidt reached a streak of six home runs in six consecutive games for the first time in his career, also tying the Cardinals franchise record previously set by Matt Carpenter and Mark McGwire. Goldschmidt finished his 2019 regular season, and his first season as a Cardinal, slashing .260/.346/.476 with 34 home runs and 97 RBIs over 161 games. On defense, he had the best fielding percentage of all major league first basemen (.996).[60] Following the season, he was nominated for his first ever Gold Glove in a Cardinals uniform.[61] In 2020, Goldschmidt appeared in 58 games batting .304/.417/.466 with six home runs and 21 RBIs in 231 at-bats.[62] On October 28, 2020, he underwent surgery to have a bone spur removed out of his right elbow.[63] On April 13, 2021, against the Washington Nationals, Goldschmidt hit his 250th career home run.[62] Goldschmidt finished the 2021 season with 603 at-bats over 158 games, slashing .294/.365/.514 with 31 home runs and 99 RBIs.[64] He won the Gold Glove Award at first base, being one of five Cardinals (an MLB record) to win the award.[65] On May 23, 2022, Goldschmidt hit a walk-off grand slam in the bottom of the tenth inning versus the Toronto Blue Jays for a 7–3 win. That grand slam extended Goldschmidt's hitting streak to 15 games, during which he hit .438 with 28 hits, 12 doubles, five home runs, and 22 RBI. Since RBI became an official statistic in 1920, no major leaguer had previously achieved all of those totals during any 15-game span.[a][66] For May, Goldschmidt led the major leagues with a 1.288 OPS and 33 RBI, alongside leading the National League with a .404 average. His ten home runs ranked second in the NL. He was named the NL Player of the Month.[67] The hit streak continued for 25 games until June 4 versus the Chicago Cubs, when Goldschmidt was 0-for-2 with two bases on balls. Over the 25 games, he batted .424 (42-for-99)/.482/.869, 24 extra-base hits, and 36 RBI. It was the longest by a Cardinal since Albert Pujols hit 30 straight in 2003, and tied for the third-longest for the Cardinals since 1963.[68] Goldschmidt reached base safely in 46 consecutive games, which ended on June 11, 2022, versus the Cincinnati Reds.[69] In a two-game span versus the Pittsburgh Pirates on June 14–15, 2022, Goldschmidt achieved nine hits in 12 at-bats with four home runs, six runs scored, nine RBI, a double, and no strikeouts. No player had matched or exceeded those totals with zero strikeouts over a two-game span since Ty Cobb on May 5–6, 1925, when the Detroit Tigers visited the St. Louis Browns.[70] On June 21, Goldschmidt claimed his fourth Player of the Week award after having batted .467 (14-for-30), with four home runs, 11 RBI, and a .967 slugging percentage. He tallied at least one base hit in each of the seven games over the week, including four multi-hit games.[71] On July 5, 2022, Goldschmidt scored his 1,000th run in a contest versus Atlanta.[72] On July 16, he hit his 300th career home run in a game against Cincinnati, the 153rd major leaguer to reach the milestone.[73] Goldschmidt was named the starting first baseman for the National League at the MLB All-Star Game, played at Dodger Stadium.[74] In the first inning, he hit his first career home run in an All-Star Game.[75] On July 23, in a game against the Cincinnati Reds, Goldschmidt recorded his 1,000th career run batted in.[76] On July 24, it was announced that Goldschmidt, along with teammate Nolan Arenado, would not be allowed to travel with the Cardinals to Toronto for a scheduled series against the Blue Jays, due to his lack of a COVID-19 vaccination.[77] At the end of the season, Goldschmidt led the National League with a .578 slugging percentage and .981 OPS while ranking second with 115 RBIs, 324 total bases, and a .404 on-base percentage. His .317 batting average and 35 home runs were ranked third and tied fifth respectively in the NL. Goldschmidt was named the 2022 NL Hank Aaron Award winner.[78] Goldschmidt was also awarded his fifth Silver Slugger Award, giving him the all-time record for Silver Sluggers won among first basemen.[79] On November 17, Goldschmidt won his first National League Most Valuable Player Award, garnering 22 of 30 first-place votes.[80] After playing in the 2023 London Series, Goldschmidt became the first player in MLB history to play regular-season games in five different countries, having played in the United States, Australia, Mexico, Canada, and the United Kingdom.[81] On July 26, 2024, Goldschmidt hit his 2,000th career hit against the Washington Nationals by hitting a two-run homer run off Kyle Finnegan in the bottom of the 10th inning.[82] With that hit, Goldschmidt became the 295th player in Major League history to reach 2,000 hits and the 5th active player to achieve that milestone. Goldschmidt was selected to the United States national baseball team for the 2017 World Baseball Classic, splitting time at first base with Eric Hosmer. In 13 at-bats, he slashed .077/.250/.077 with three walks.[83] Team USA would go on to win the tournament. On August 6, 2022, Goldschmidt announced that he would again play for the United States in the 2023 World Baseball Classic.[84] Goldschmidt met his wife, Amy (née Glazier), during his freshman year at Texas State and they married in October 2010.[85][86] The couple have two children, a son and a daughter.[87][88][89] Goldschmidt became an evangelical Protestant as an adult; he has Jewish, Catholic, and German ancestry.[90][91] In September 2013, Goldschmidt graduated from the University of Phoenix with a Bachelor of Science degree in management.[92] Goldschmidt owned a home in Scottsdale, Arizona, selling it in 2020.[93] That same year, he bought a home in Palm Beach Gardens, Florida, purchasing it from South African golfer Louis Oosthuizen.[94][95] During his tenure with the Diamondbacks, Goldschmidt set up a charity, called \"Goldy's Fund 4 Kids\".[96] His charity has hosted bowling events, which raises funds for Phoenix Children's Hospital.[97]",

                "content": "ABOUT THE MLBPA PRESS RELEASES HISTORY RESOURCES More... MiLB MLB Players, Inc. PLAYERS TRUST AGENTS More... Paul Goldschmidt has never taken a day in the majors for granted. Now all those days have carried him to 10 years By Jerry Crasnick Paul Goldschmidt is a six-time All-Star with four Silver Slugger Awards, three Gold Gloves and a track record of durability and achievement for the Arizona Diamondbacks and St. Louis Cardinals. Since 2015, he ranks second to Manny Machado for most games played in the big leagues with 952. He also ranks among the game’s top 10 with 183 home runs and 583 RBIs in that span. ​ On July 22, Goldschmidt checked a major item off his list when he reached 10 years of MLB service time. The Cardinals recognized him with a social media post and a message on the Busch Stadium scoreboard, and Goldschmidt’s parents flew in for an off-day celebration. Then he turned off the “pause’’ button and went back to work. ​ “We all know how hard it is just to get to the big leagues,’’ he said. “I guess that's where my mind has been. It still feels like yesterday I was in the minor leagues and I was trying to make it or survive. It’s hard to produce, year after year and for such a long time, so it's pretty special.’’ ​ At age 33, Goldschmidt plays the game with an earnestness and a commitment that transcend age gaps. He’s a role model for young teammates and a favorite of veterans with more of a “throwback’’ mindset. ​ “He’s a pro,’’ said former MLB outfielder Lance Berkman, a friend and fellow Houstonian. “I don’t know if that’s still prevalent, but we used to talk about that among the players, and it was the highest compliment you can receive. Being in the majors makes you a professional, but it doesn’t make you a pro. He’s a professional in every way.’’ Goldschmidt, who joined Mike Trout, Jose Altuve, Salvador Perez and Alex Cobb in the 10-year club in July, recently sat down with the MLBPA to reflect on his road to the milestone. Some of the interview questions and responses have been edited for clarity. \"It's more a credit to the people around me than even me. I had such great mentors and coaches and teammates, everything I learned was from someone else. \" It's easy to forget now, but you were lightly recruited out of high school before going to Texas State, and you were an eighth-round draft pick in 2009. Does that give you a different perspective on your longevity in the game? ​ “I think I was pretty realistic about my expectations. I got drafted and I was going to give baseball a shot, but by no means did I think getting to the big leagues or making a career of it was guaranteed, so I always had a backup plan. I went back to school to finish my college degree. I never took it for granted, and I still don't. Every year, you have to go out there and prove yourself. There are a lot of great players, so you have to keep adapting and trying to find new ways to produce and help your team. ​ “That storyline of me being an eighth-round pick . . . I don’t know if 'crazy' is the right word, but it was a longer shot. But I don't care if you’re the first overall pick: It’s hard to get to the big leagues and have a long career, so I think I'm in the same boat as everyone else. That's what makes being able to produce over a decade so special for so many players, because anything can happen. There are injuries and so many different things, so just being able to do that is a big honor.’’ In 2011, Baseball America wrote, ‘There's no denying Goldschmidt’s legitimate power to all fields.’’ But some scouts thought you might wind up as a platoon player. Did that give you any extra motivation? ​ “I'm very focused on blocking out any distractions, so I never concerned myself too much with what the scouts or other people said. It’s not like they’re coming up to you and telling that to your face. If you buy Baseball America, I guess you can find out what people think about you. Even now I purposely don’t read what's out there about me or our team or really a lot of teams. It just allows me to focus each day and not get distracted. ​ “When you're good, everyone wants to tell you how great you are, and when you're struggling, they tell you you're worse than you really are, so trying to be consistent is a big goal of mine. It's not like I thought, ‘I’m surefire going to get to the big leagues and have a long career.’ My (attitude) was, ‘I'm gonna work as hard as I can and play as hard as I can and see how good I can be.’ If that was Single A ball and I got released, then I’ll know I gave it my all. And if it was a cup of coffee in the big leagues or anywhere else, whenever my career ends, I want to look back and not have any regrets.’’ A lot of 10-year players look back and recall an injury or a low point when they found out what they were made of. Does anything spring to mind for you? ​ “Not being a high pick, there is more failure built in at the amateur level. Even though I had success, you’re playing with guys who get drafted higher than you or go to bigger colleges or have more success. As I got into pro ball, I think that really helped prepare me. Probably the biggest thing I learned in the minor leagues was how to deal with failure, because you just can't perform like you did at the college and high school level. ​ “If there was one time (in the big leagues) it was probably my last year in Arizona in 2018. I got off to a really bad start, and I was under .200 the first couple months of the season. I kept working and working, but I wasn’t performing, and you’re like, ‘Man, this game is really hard.’ I still had confidence in myself, but you know some things are out of your control. It’s ironic, because I followed up the worst two months of my career with maybe the best two months. It’s funny how the game works out like that.’’ How important has it been to embrace the pressure without letting it overwhelm you? ​ “I think on the outside everyone is like, ‘Oh well, these guys just go out there and perform.’ I remember speaking at Texas State and being asked, ‘When did you know you’ve made it?’ And I was like, ‘I’m scared every year this could be my last year.’ It’s a healthy fear and I think it keeps you motivated to get better, because you know how hard it is.’ There’s always this adjustment. If you do the same thing every year, it’s impossible to have sustained success or keep getting better. Every year is a little different.’’ You mentioned going back for your degree in management. Can you reflect on that period, and your thought process? ​ “It was all online, which is why I chose to go back to the University of Phoenix. I was on all the planes with my laptop and my iPad doing homework and reading and writing papers. For most of 2012 and ‘13 on almost all the road trips, there was a lot less hanging out with the guys because I had to get that done. But I'm very proud that I did that. It was something I really wanted. ​ “I had three years of college and I took my studies seriously and I didn't want those three years to go to waste. I wanted to finish up and not be denied any opportunity outside of baseball, whether my career was a short one or a long one. I wanted to set the example for my future kids. It was something that was important for me and I'm very glad that I did.’’ When Rhys Hoskins was breaking in with the Phillies, he was a bit awestruck over meeting Paul Goldschmidt. Was there a veteran who elicited a similar response in you as a young player? ​ “When I first got called up, I had been watching every guy in the big leagues on TV, so they're all guys you look up to. In order to perform, I had to trick myself that they weren't these guys I was watching on TV. I remember doing that a lot -- pretending they were someone else. ​ “There was maybe only one time I was nervous. One of my favorite players growing up was Lance Berkman. He got to first base when he was with the Rangers, and I was like, ‘Wow, this is a really cool moment.’ I grew up in Houston and he was with the Astros for such a long time and I watched him almost on a daily basis. I took that moment in and I was like, ‘This is really special.’ I never thought this would happen -- and he even knew who I was. He knew I was from Houston, so it turned out to be really cool. We’ve become friends since he retired, with him playing for the Cardinals and just having mutual friends around the game. ​ “I remember when I made the All-Star team in 2013, Joey Votto was starting and he was one of the best first basemen in the game and he said, ‘Do you want to take groundballs?’ I’ll talk to guys at first base. If a guy comes over there and I like the way he hits, I'll try to ask him some questions and try to keep getting better.’’ So you’re a guy who’ll engage in conversation at first base? ​ “It depends where the game is. If it’s a tie game in the bottom of the ninth, you're not over there chit-chatting. It’s not like I’m striking up a conversation with everyone who gets over there. But you build a relationship with some guys. Maybe it’s guys in your division that you see all the time, or you know from the World Baseball Classic or the All-Star Game. Even if there are guys you’re together with in the locker room for one or two days at the All-Star Game, there’s a connection.\" Now that you’ve reached 10 years, do you think about people who influenced you along the way? ​ “I'm really glad you asked that. It's more a credit to the people around me than even me. I had such great mentors and coaches and teammates, everything I learned was from someone else. It starts out even before that. I just think about my parents, my dad, and the lessons they taught me. ​ “Turner Ward was a huge mentor to me. He was my manager in Double-A and then eventually one of our hitting coaches in Arizona, Alan Zinter was a hitting coach I had in the minor leagues. When I got called up, Kirk Gibson was our manager and Don Baylor was our hitting coach. Matt Williams was there. These guys had really long and successful careers. We had a lot of veteran players on the team that took me under their wing. Lyle Overbay was another first baseman, and he was great to me even though we were kind of competing in a sense. I had my locker between Willie Bloomquist and JJ Putz. Geoff Blum and John McDonald were there, and Aaron Hill and I would work out together every day in the offseason at 6 a.m. So he helped mentor me in the offseason. “When I got called up, there were six or eight guys who all had 10 years. That doesn't happen as much anymore. Those guys showed me how to be a big leaguer, and they made the learning curve so much quicker than I could ever imagine. I think that's the great thing about experience. If you use it the right way, even though it doesn't show up in a stat line, you're helping the team or helping other players perform -- which helps a team. A huge amount of any credit that I get goes to those guys I mentioned -- and many, many more.’’ Now that you’ve ascended to that mentor role, what lessons do you try to convey to younger teammates? ​ “It's so easy to get caught up in the moment, which is good: We have to be present. But if you want to have longevity, you need to have a little longer view of things. Sometimes it means not taking as many swings or groundballs because there are 162 games. You want to save your body, but it's hard in the moment. ​ “I think a big thing is dealing with failure. This game is really hard. There are a lot of ups and downs, and everyone's gonna go through it. I don't care who you are. I try to share tips that were taught to me and help speed up that learning curve. There were things that would have taken me five or six years to learn, and (the veterans) told me in my first or second year and made me a better player. ​ “I remember making an error or striking out and guys saying, ‘Hey, it’s all right. You'll get it tomorrow.’ In your rookie year, you can really get down on yourself and you're not sure what tomorrow's gonna look like, or if the guys in the locker room are disappointed with you. Those little sayings or encouraging (words) were the biggest things for me. So I want to be encouraging to all the guys in our locker room to the best of my ability.’’ You're going to be around a while, but have you given any thought to what you want to do when your playing career is over? ​ “I'm not really sure. I definitely have some thoughts in the back of my mind on ways to give back and help out. We’re going to do a baseball camp this year for a bunch of kids in St. Louis and talk about baseball as a way to develop life skills. I was in their shoes when I was 10-12 years old, so that's an idea I'm kind of working on right now. “Sports are just a metaphor for life. There are so many great things about sports. Baseball is my favorite, but with any sport, you’re dealing with failure. Teammates. The humility of dealing with success. How to work with others. Hard work. Sports really bring out all these life skills we value so much. For me, the idea of exploring and spreading that idea is something I'd like to work on over the next few years and kind of see where that takes me when i'm done playing.’’ © 2024 Major League Baseball Players Association (MLBPA).

                "title": "Paul Goldschmidt to sign with Yankees: Former MVP lands in New York on one-year deal worth $12.5 million - CBSSports.com",
                "content": "If not listed, please contact your TV provider. Decorated veteran slugger and former MVP Paul Goldschmidt has agreed to terms with the New York Yankees on a one-year pact worth $12.5 million, Jim Bowden of CBS Sports HQ reported Saturday. This past season with the St. Louis Cardinals, Goldschmidt showed signs of decline at the plate. In 154 games for the Cardinals, Goldschmidt batted .245/.302/.414 (98 OPS+) with 22 home runs. On the upside, Goldschmidt was productive in 2022 and in 2023 claimed his first and only MVP award as a member of the Cardinals. As well, he's still capable of hitting the ball quite hard, and the Yankees are betting on that quality of contact to hold sway over Goldschmidt's age, 37, and increasing strikeout rates. Goldschmidt will slot in at first base for the Yankees, replacing fellow free-agent Anthony Rizzo after his own disappointing 2024 campaign. Earlier in the offseason, CBS Sports ranked Goldschmidt as the No. 43 available free agent in the current class. Here's part of our write-up: It took 14 seasons but, for the first time in Goldschmidt's career, he failed to post an OPS+ of 100 or better. We must admit that the end is nigh. Goldschmidt's strikeout and walk rates both veered in the wrong directions, leaving him more dependent on his slugging. He can still put a charge into the ball, but his power output has slipped over the last two seasons. There's no shame to any of this; it's simply how aging in baseball works. Goldschmidt is 37 years old and has had a phenomenal career, one that has included seven All-Star Game appearances and a Most Valuable Player Award victory. We think he'll play big-league baseball in 2025 if he chooses to; he just won't be as good as he used to be, to say nothing of him being as good as he wants to be. Goldschmidt will enter the 2025 season with a career OPS+ of 139, 362 home runs, and a WAR of 62.8. He'll one day be a candidate to be elected to the Baseball Hall of Fame, but for now Goldschmidt's focus will be on authoring a comeback season in 2025. © 2004-2024 CBS Interactive.

                "content": "Manchester City Football Club (or simply Man City F.C.) is a professional football club based in Manchester, England, that competes in the Premier League, the top flight of English football. Founded in 1880 as St. Mark's (West Gorton), they became Ardwick Association Football Club in 1887 and Manchester City in 1894. The club's home ground is the City of Manchester Stadium, currently known as the Etihad Stadium in east Manchester, to which they moved in 2003, having played at Maine Road since 1923. Manchester City adopted their sky blue home shirts in 1894, the first season with the current name.[4] Over the course of its history, the club has won ten league titles, seven FA Cups, eight League Cups, seven FA Community Shields, one UEFA Champions League, one European Cup Winners' Cup, one UEFA Super Cup and one FIFA Club World Cup. The club joined the Football League in 1892, and won their first major honour, the FA Cup, in 1904. Manchester City had its first major period of success in the late 1960s and early 1970s, winning the league title, FA Cup, League Cup, and European Cup Winners Cup under the management of Joe Mercer and Malcolm Allison. After losing the 1981 FA Cup final, Manchester City went through a period of decline, culminating in relegation to the third tier of English football for the only time in their history in 1998. They since regained promotion to the top tier in 2001–02 and have remained a fixture in the Premier League since 2002–03. Manchester City received considerable financial investment both in playing staff and facilities following its takeover by Sheikh Mansour bin Zayed Al Nahyan through the Abu Dhabi United Group in August 2008.[5] This started a new era of unprecedented success, with the club winning the FA Cup in 2011 and the Premier League in 2012, both their first since the 1960s, followed by another league title in 2014. Under the management of Pep Guardiola, Manchester City won the Premier League in 2018, becoming the only team in the competition history to attain 100 points in a single season. In 2018–19, they won four trophies, completing an unprecedented sweep of all domestic titles in England and becoming the first English men's team to win the domestic treble.[6] This was followed by four consecutive Premier League titles in 2020–21, 2021–22, 2022–23 and 2023–24, as well as the club's first Champions League final in 2021, which they lost to Chelsea. The 2022–23 season saw Manchester City win their maiden European Cup and complete the continental treble in the process, becoming the second English club to do so.[7] The club is ranked first in the UEFA coefficient standings as of 2023.[8] Manchester City topped the Deloitte Football Money League at the end of the 2021–22 season, making it the football club with the highest revenue in the world, approximated at €731 million.[9] In 2022, Forbes estimated the club was the sixth-most valuable in the world, worth $4.250 billion.[10][11] Manchester City are owned by City Football Group Limited, a holding company valued at £3.73 ($4.8) billion in November 2019 and majority-owned by the Abu Dhabi United Group.[12][13] City gained their first honours by winning the Second Division in 1899; with it came promotion to the highest level in English football, the First Division. They went on to claim their first major honour on 23 April 1904, beating Bolton Wanderers 1–0 at Crystal Palace to win the FA Cup; the Blues narrowly missed out on a League and Cup double that season after finishing runners-up in the league campaign, but they still became the first club in Manchester to win a major honour.[15] In the seasons following the FA Cup triumph, the club was dogged by allegations of financial irregularities, culminating in the suspension of seventeen players in 1906, including captain Billy Meredith, who subsequently moved across town to Manchester United.[16] A fire at Hyde Road destroyed the main stand in 1920, and in 1923 the club moved to their new purpose-built stadium at Maine Road in Moss Side.[17] In the 1930s, Manchester City reached two consecutive FA Cup finals, losing to Everton in 1933, before claiming the Cup by beating Portsmouth in 1934.[18] During the 1934 run, the club broke the record for the highest home attendance of any club in English football history, as 84,569 fans packed Maine Road for a sixth-round FA Cup tie against Stoke City – a record which stood until 2016.[19][20] The club won the First Division title for the first time in 1937, but were relegated the following season, despite scoring more goals than any other team in the division.[21] Twenty years later, a City team inspired by a tactical system known as the Revie Plan reached consecutive FA Cup finals again, in 1955 and 1956; just as in the 1930s, they lost the first one, to Newcastle United, and won the second. The 1956 final, in which the Blues defeated Birmingham City 3–1, saw City goalkeeper Bert Trautmann continuing to play on after unknowingly breaking his neck.[22] After being relegated to the Second Division in 1963, the future looked bleak with a record low home attendance of 8,015 against Swindon Town in January 1965.[23] In the summer of 1965, the management team of Joe Mercer and Malcolm Allison was appointed. In the first season under Mercer, Manchester City won the Second Division title and made important signings in Mike Summerbee and Colin Bell.[24] Two seasons later, in 1967–68, City claimed the league championship for the second time, beating their close neighbours Manchester United to the title on the final day of the season with a 4–3 victory at Newcastle United.[25] Further trophies followed: City won the FA Cup in 1969 and a year later triumphed in the European Cup Winners' Cup, defeating Górnik Zabrze 2–1 in the 1970 final. This was the club's only European honour until their triumph in the 2022–23 UEFA Champions League.[26] The Blues also won the League Cup that year, becoming the second English team to win a European trophy and a domestic trophy in the same season. The club continued to challenge for honours throughout the 1970s, finishing one point behind the league champions on two occasions and reaching the final of the 1974 League Cup.[27] One of the matches from this period that is most fondly remembered by supporters of Manchester City is the final match of the 1973–74 season against arch-rivals Manchester United, who needed to win to have any hope of avoiding relegation. Former United player Denis Law scored with a backheel to give City a 1–0 win at Old Trafford and confirm the relegation of their rivals.[28][29] The final trophy of the club's most successful period of the 20th century was won in 1976, when Newcastle United were beaten 2–1 in the League Cup final. A long period of decline followed the success of the 1960s and 1970s. Malcolm Allison rejoined the club to become manager for the second time in 1979, but squandered large sums of money on several unsuccessful signings, such as Steve Daley.[30] A succession of managers then followed – seven in the 1980s alone. Under John Bond, City reached the 1981 FA Cup final but lost in a replay to Tottenham Hotspur. The club were twice relegated from the top flight in the 1980s (in 1983 and 1987), but returned to the top flight again in 1989 under Mel Machin. Howard Kendall guided the club to top flight safety in 1990 and the club finished fifth in 1991 and 1992 under the management of active player Peter Reid.[31] However, this was only a temporary respite, and following Reid's departure Manchester City's fortunes continued to fade. City were co-founders of the Premier League upon its creation in 1992, but after finishing ninth in its first season, Peter Swales, club chairman since 1973, was replaced by club legend Francis Lee in February 1994 in a movement supported by fans. Despite this, they endured three years of struggle under Brian Horton and Alan Ball Jr. before being relegated in dramatic fashion in 1996. After two seasons in the First Division[a] and four different permanent managers, Lee resigned from his role as chairman midway through the 1998 season, although remained as a shareholder, as City fell to the lowest point in their history, becoming the second ever European trophy winners to be relegated to their country's third-tier league after 1. FC Magdeburg of Germany. After relegation, the club underwent off-the-field upheaval, with new chairman David Bernstein introducing greater fiscal discipline.[32] Under manager Joe Royle, City were promoted at the first attempt, achieved in dramatic fashion in the Second Division play-off final against Gillingham.[33] A second successive promotion saw City return to the top division, but this proved to have been a step too far for the recovering club, and in 2001 City were relegated once more. Kevin Keegan replaced Royle as manager in the close season, and achieved an immediate return to the top division as the club won the 2001–02 First Division championship, breaking club records for the number of points gained and goals scored in a single season in the process.[34] The 2002–03 season was the last at Maine Road and included a 3–1 derby victory over rivals Manchester United, ending a 13-year run without a derby win.[35] Additionally, City qualified for European competition for the first time in 25 years via UEFA fair play ranking. In the close 2003–04 season, the club moved to the new City of Manchester Stadium. The first four seasons at the stadium all resulted in mid-table finishes. Former England manager Sven-Göran Eriksson became the club's first foreign manager when appointed in 2007.[36] After a bright start, performances faded in the second half of the season, and Eriksson was sacked on 2 June 2008;[37] he was replaced by Mark Hughes two days later.[38] By 2008, Manchester City were in a financially precarious position. Thaksin Shinawatra had taken control of the club the year before, but his political travails saw his assets frozen.[39] Then, in August 2008, City were purchased by the Abu Dhabi United Group. The takeover was immediately followed by a flurry of bids for high-profile players; the club broke the British transfer record by signing Brazilian international Robinho from Real Madrid for £32.5 million.[40] There was not a huge improvement in performance compared to the previous season despite the influx of money however, with the team finishing tenth, although they did well to reach the quarter-finals of the UEFA Cup. During the summer of 2009, the club took transfer spending to an unprecedented level, with an outlay of over £100 million on players Gareth Barry, Roque Santa Cruz, Kolo Touré, Emmanuel Adebayor, Carlos Tevez, and Joleon Lescott.[41] In December 2009, Mark Hughes – who had been hired shortly before the change in ownership but was originally retained by the new board – was replaced as manager by Roberto Mancini.[42] City finished the season in fifth position in the Premier League, narrowly missing out on a place in the Champions League but qualifying for the UEFA Europa League.[43] Continued investment in players followed in successive seasons, and results began to match the upturn in player quality. City reached the FA Cup final in 2011, their first major final in over 30 years, after defeating derby rivals Manchester United in the semi-finals,[44] the first time they had knocked their rival out of a cup competition since 1975. The Blues defeated Stoke City 1–0 in the final, securing their fifth FA Cup and the club's first major trophy since winning the 1976 League Cup. On the last day of the 2010–11 season, City beat out Arsenal for the third place, thereby securing qualification directly into the Champions League group stage.[45] Strong performances continued to follow in the 2011–12 season, including a 5–1 victory over Tottenham at White Hart Lane and a record-equalling 6–1 win over Manchester United at Old Trafford, but a poor run of form in the second half of the season left City in second place, eight points behind United with only six games left to play. At this point, United suffered their own loss of form, dropping eight points in the space of four games, while City began a run of successive wins which saw both teams level on points with two games to go. Despite the Blues only needing a home win against Queens Park Rangers, a team in the relegation zone, they fell 1–2 behind by the end of normal time. However, two goals in injury time – the second by Sergio Agüero in the fourth added minute – settled the title in City's favour, making them the first team to win the Premier League on goal difference alone.[46] The following season, City were unable to replicate the previous year's success. After finishing second in the league, eleven points behind Manchester United, and losing the FA Cup final 0–1 to relegated Wigan Athletic,[47] Mancini was sacked.[48] He was replaced by Chilean manager Manuel Pellegrini.[49] In Pellegrini's first year in charge, City won the League Cup and regained the Premier League title on the last matchday of the season.[50][51] The team's league form then slowly declined over the next couple of years, as the Blues finished second in 2014–15 and then dropped to fourth in 2015–16, although the 2015–16 season would see City win another League Cup title and reach the Champions League semi-finals for the first time.[52] Pep Guardiola, former head coach of Barcelona and Bayern Munich, was confirmed to become Manchester City's new manager on 1 February 2016,[53] with the announcement having been made several months before Manuel Pellegrini left his position. Guardiola's first season in Manchester would end trophyless, with the Blues placing third in the league standings,[54] but the following season proved far more successful, as City won the Premier League title with the highest points total in history and broke numerous other club and English league records along the way.[55] This would prove to be the start of a period of unprecedented success for Manchester City under Guardiola. Between the 2017–18 and 2023–24 Premier League seasons, City won six out of possible seven league titles, only finishing second behind Liverpool in the 2019–20 season.[56] Guardiola also guided the Blues to silverware in domestic cup competitions, highlighted by four consecutive League Cup triumphs in 2018–2021.[57] During the 2018–19 season, City completed an unprecedented domestic treble of English men's titles.[58] Apart from winning all three of the major English football tournaments, they also won the Community Shield, the first time any team has ever held all four of England's primary football trophies at the same time.[59] On the continental stage, the club achieved breakthrough in 2020–21, reaching their first-ever Champions League final.[60] In an all-English affair, City lost 0–1 to Chelsea at the Estádio do Dragão in Porto.[61] The 2022–23 season turned out to be the greatest in the club's history, as Manchester City won their third consecutive Premier League title, the FA Cup final against rivals Manchester United, and their maiden Champions League title at the Atatürk Olympic Stadium in Istanbul against Inter Milan, thereby assembling a rare feat – the continental treble. The road to the Champions League victory included wins over European giants Bayern Munich, who were defeated 4–1 on aggregate,[62] and Real Madrid, who suffered a 1–5 aggregate loss at the hands of City.[63][64][65] The following season saw considerably less success for the Blues, as they won the UEFA Super Cup and FIFA Club World Cup for the first time and became the first English men's club to win four consecutive league titles.[66] City also advanced to the FA Cup final for the second straight year but lost in a rematch to rivals Manchester United. Manchester City's era of sustained competitive excellence coincided with charges of breaching Financial Fair Play (FFP) regulations. In 2020, the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) ruled that sanctions placed on the club by UEFA were not justified, overturning City's two-year European ban.[67] In 2023, the Premier League announced its own investigation of the allegations levied against Manchester City, charging the club with 115 breaches of its FFP rules up to the 2017–18 season.[68][69] On 24 November 2024 in the 2024-25 season, City lost 0-4 to Tottenham Hotspur that marked the end of their 52-game unbeaten streak at home. It was the Citizen's first home defeat since November 2022 when Brentford claimed a surprise victory at the same venue. Despite having most of the ball possession and creating 23 attempts at goal, City were made to rue wasteful chances while their opponent on the day converted their chances clinically.[70] Manchester City's home colours are sky blue and white. Traditional away kit colours have been either maroon or (from the 1960s) red and black; however, in recent years several colours have been used. The origins of the club's home colours are unclear, but there is evidence that the club has worn blue since 1892 or earlier. A booklet entitled Famous Football Clubs – Manchester City published in the 1940s indicates that West Gorton (St. Marks) originally played in scarlet and black, and reports dating from 1884 describe the team wearing black jerseys bearing a white cross, showing the club's origins as a church side.[71]: 14–15 The infrequent yet recurrent use of red and black away colours comes from former assistant manager Malcolm Allison's belief that adopting the colours of AC Milan would inspire City to glory.[72] Allison's theory seemingly took effect, with City winning the 1969 FA Cup final, 1970 League Cup final, and 1970 Cup Winners' Cup final in red and black stripes as opposed to the club's home kit of sky blue. City had previously worn three other badges on their shirts, prior to their current badge being implemented in 2016. The first, introduced in 1970, was based on designs which had been used on official club documentation since the mid-1960s. It consisted of a circular badge which used the same shield as the present badge (including a ship, based on the City of Manchester coat of arms), inside a circle bearing the name of the club. In 1972, this was replaced by a variation which replaced the lower half of the shield with the red rose of Lancashire. In 1976, a heraldic badge was granted by the College of Arms to the English Football League for use by City. The badge consisted of the familiar ship above a red rose but on a circular device instead of a shield (blazoned as \"A roundel per fess azure and argent in chief a three masted ship sails set pennons flying or in base a rose gules barbed and seeded proper\").[73] On occasions when Manchester City played in a major cup final, the club wore shirts bearing the City of Manchester coat of arms, as a symbol of pride in representing the city at a major event. This practice originated from a time when the players' shirts did not normally bear a badge of any kind.[74]: 21 The club has since abandoned the practice; for the 2011 FA Cup final, its first in the 21st century, City used the usual badge with a special legend, but the Manchester coat of arms was included as a small monochrome logo in the numbers on the back of players' shirts.[75] A new club badge was adopted in 1997, as a result of the previous badge being ineligible for registration as a trademark. This badge was based on the arms of the city of Manchester, and consisted of a shield in front of a golden eagle. The eagle is an old heraldic symbol of the city of Manchester; a golden eagle was added to the city's badge in 1958 (but had since been removed), representing the growing aviation industry. The shield featured a ship on its upper half representing the Manchester Ship Canal, and three diagonal stripes in the lower half symbolised the city's three rivers – the Irwell, the Irk and the Medlock. The bottom of the badge bore the motto \"Superbia in Proelio\", which translates as \"Pride in Battle\" in Latin. Above the eagle and shield were the three stars, added for decorative purposes. On 15 October 2015, following years of criticism from the fans over the design of the 1997 badge,[76] the club announced they intended to carry out a fan consultation on whether to discontinue the current badge and institute a new design.[76] After the consultation, the club announced in late November 2015 the badge would be replaced in due course by a new version which would be designed in the style of the older, circular variants.[77] A design purporting to be the new badge was unintentionally leaked two days early prior to the official unveiling on 26 December 2015 by the IPO when the design was trademarked on 22 December.[78] The new badge was officially unveiled at Manchester City's home match against Sunderland on 26 December.[79] Note: Flags indicate national team as defined under FIFA eligibility rules; some limited exceptions apply.

Since 2003, Manchester City have not issued the squad number 23. It was retired in memory of Marc-Vivien Foé, who was on loan to the club from Lyon at the time of his death on the field of play while playing for Cameroon in the 2003 FIFA Confederations Cup.[87] Note: Flags indicate national team as defined under FIFA eligibility rules; some limited exceptions apply.

Other players (vice-captains) have led the team on the pitch when the club captain is not playing or not available. Some players have been made captain on a one-off basis to celebrate or commemorate an event, e.g. Oleksandr Zinchenko captained the team in their 2021–22 FA Cup fifth round tie at Peterborough United in support of his country during the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine.[88] Each season since the end of the 1966–67 season, the members of the Manchester City Official Supporters Club have voted by ballot to choose the player on the team they feel is the most worthy of recognition for his performances during that season.

Even in the late 1990s, when City were relegated twice in three seasons and playing in the third tier of English football (then the Second Division, now the EFL League One), home attendances were in the region of 30,000, compared to an average of fewer than 8,000 for the division.[126] Research carried out by Manchester City in 2005 estimated a fanbase of 886,000 in the United Kingdom and a total in excess of 2 million worldwide, although since the purchase of the club by Sheikh Mansour, and City's recent achievements, that figure has since ballooned to many times that size.[127] Manchester City's officially recognised supporters club is the Manchester City F.C. Supporters Club (1949), formed by a merger of two existing organisations in 2010: the Official Supporters Club (OSC) and the Centenary Supporters Association (CSA).[128] City fans' song of choice is a rendition of \"Blue Moon\", which despite its melancholic theme is belted out with gusto as though it were a heroic anthem. City supporters tend to believe that unpredictability is an inherent trait of their team, and label unexpected results \"typical City\".[129][130] Events that fans regard as \"typical City\" include the club being the only reigning English champions ever to be relegated (in 1938), the only team to score and concede over 100 goals in the same season (1957–58),[131] or the more recent example where Manchester City were the only team to beat Chelsea in the latter's record-breaking 2004–05 Premier League season, yet in the same season City were knocked out of the FA Cup by Oldham Athletic, a team two divisions lower. In the late 1980s, City fans started a craze of bringing inflatable objects to matches, primarily oversized bananas. One disputed explanation for the phenomenon is that in a match against West Bromwich Albion, chants from fans calling for the introduction of Imre Varadi as a substitute mutated into \"Imre Banana\". Terraces packed with inflatable-waving supporters became a frequent sight in the 1988–89 season, as the craze spread to other clubs (inflatable fish were seen at Grimsby Town), with the craze reaching its peak at City's match at Stoke City on 26 December 1988, a game declared by fanzines as a fancy dress party.[132] In 2010, Manchester City supporters adopted an exuberant dance, dubbed The Poznań, from fans of Polish club Lech Poznań that they played in the Europa League.[133] In 2022, Manchester City proposed the release of the Connected Scarf, that would contain a sensor tracking physiological and emotional data of the wearer, for supporters in 2023.[134] Manchester City's biggest rivalry is with neighbours Manchester United, against whom they contest the Manchester derby. Before the Second World War, when travel to away games was rare, many Mancunian football fans regularly watched both teams even if considering themselves \"supporters\" of only one. This practice continued into the early 1960s but as travel became easier, and the cost of entry to matches rose, watching both teams became unusual and the rivalry intensified. A common stereotype is that City fans come from Manchester proper, while United fans come from elsewhere. A 2002 report by a researcher at Manchester Metropolitan University found that while it was true that a higher proportion of City season ticket holders came from Manchester postcode areas (40% compared to United's 29%), there were more United season ticket holders, the lower percentage being due to United's higher overall number of season ticket holders (27,667 compared to City's 16,481). The report noted that since the compiling of data in 2001, the number of both City and United season ticket holders had risen; expansion of United's ground and City's move to the City of Manchester Stadium have caused season ticket sales to increase further.[135] Over the last few years, Manchester City has also developed a notable rivalry with Liverpool,[136] currently considered one of the biggest in association football.[137][138] Though the two clubs had been involved in a title race in the 1976–77 season, Liverpool and City's modern rivalry began in the 2010s, with the Blues beating Liverpool to the 2013–14 title by just two points on the final day of the season.[139] In the final of the 2015–16 League Cup, City defeated Liverpool on penalties after a 1–1 draw. The two clubs met in European competition for the first time in the 2017–18 Champions League quarter-finals, where Liverpool won 5–1 on aggregate, ultimately reaching the final and then winning the competition a year later.[140][141] In the 2018–19 season, City again won the title on the final day, with the Blues' 98 points and Liverpool's 97 being the third- and fourth-highest Premier League points totals ever.[142] The following season, Liverpool clinched the title, recording 99 points (the second-highest Premier League total ever after Manchester City's 100 in 2017–18) to finish 18 points above runners-up City. The Blues then regained the title in 2020–21 and outgunned Liverpool in another closely-fought title race in 2021–22, to finish with 93 points to Liverpool's 92. The success of the two teams in the 2010s and 2020s has led to the development of a rivalry between Jürgen Klopp and Pep Guardiola, the managers of Liverpool and Manchester City, with the two previously having been the respective managers of Der Klassiker rivals Borussia Dortmund and Bayern Munich in the Bundesliga.[143] At the end of the 2018–19 season, Guardiola described his relationship with Klopp as a \"beautiful rivalry\" and called Klopp's Liverpool team \"the strongest opponents I have faced in my career as a manager\".[144][145] In September 2019, Klopp hailed Guardiola for being his 'greatest rival ever', after both were nominated for the FIFA Men's Coach of the Year award in 2019, which Klopp ultimately won.[146][147] In a 2019 survey, City fans answered that Liverpool, and not Manchester United, are the club's biggest rivals.[148] Manchester City also have long established local rivalries with Bolton Wanderers, Oldham Athletic, and Stockport County, and more recent competitive Premier League rivalries with Tottenham Hotspur, Chelsea and Arsenal.[149][150][151] The holding company of Manchester City F.C., Manchester City Limited, is a private limited company, with approximately 54 million shares in issue. The club has been in private hands since 2007, when the major shareholders agreed to sell their holdings to UK Sports Investments Limited (UKSIL), a company controlled by former Thailand prime minister Thaksin Shinawatra. UKSIL then made a formal offer to buy the shares held by several thousands of small shareholders. Prior to the Thaksin takeover, the club was listed on the specialist independent equity market PLUS (formerly OFEX),[152] where it had been listed since 1995. On 6 July 2007, having acquired 75% of the shares, Thaksin de-listed the club and re-registered it as a private company.[153] By August, UKSIL had acquired over 90% of the shares and exercised its rights under the Companies Act to \"squeeze out\" the remaining shareholders, and acquire the entire shareholding. Thaksin Shinawatra became chairman of the club and two of Thaksin's children, Pintongta and Oak Chinnawat became directors. Former chairman John Wardle stayed on the board for a year, but resigned in July 2008 following Nike executive Garry Cook's appointment as executive chairman in May.[154] The club made a pre-tax loss of £11m in the fiscal year ending 31 May 2007, the final year for which the club published accounts as a public company.[155] Thaksin's purchase prompted a period of transfer spending at the club,[156] in total around £30 million,[157] whereas over the several previous seasons Manchester City's net spending had been among the lowest in the Premier League. A year later, this investment was dwarfed by an influx of money derived from the club's takeover. On 1 September 2008, Abu Dhabi-based Abu Dhabi United Group Investment and Development Limited completed the takeover of Manchester City. The deal, worth a reported £200 million, was announced on the morning of 1 September. It sparked various transfer \"deadline-day\" rumours and bids such as the club's attempt to gazump Manchester United's protracted bid to sign Dimitar Berbatov from Tottenham Hotspur for a fee in excess of £30 million.[158][159] Minutes before the transfer window closed, the club signed Robinho from Real Madrid for a British record transfer fee of £32.5 million.[160] The wealth of the new owners meant that, in the summer of 2009, City were able to finance the purchase of experienced international players prior to the new season, spending more than any other club in the Premier League.[161] Created in the 2013–14 season to manage the global footballing interests of the Abu Dhabi United Group, City Football Group (CFG) is an umbrella corporation owning stakes in a network of global clubs for the purposes of resource sharing, academy networking and marketing. In addition to Manchester City, City Football Group owns stakes in a number of clubs: The City of Manchester Stadium in east Manchester, known as the Etihad Stadium since 2011 for sponsorship reasons, is on a 200-year lease from Manchester City Council to Manchester City. It has been the club's home since the end of the 2002–03 season, when City moved from Maine Road.[176] Before moving to the stadium, the club spent in excess of £30 million to convert it to football use: the pitch was lowered, adding another tier of seating around it, and a new North Stand was constructed.[177] The inaugural match at the new stadium was a 2–1 win over Barcelona in a friendly match.[178] A 7,000-seat third tier on the South Stand was completed in time for the start of the 2015–16 football season, increasing the stadium's capacity to 55,097. A North Stand third tier is in development, potentially increasing capacity to around 61,000.[179] After playing home matches at five stadiums between 1880 and 1887, the club settled at Hyde Road Football Stadium, its home for 36 years.[180] A fire destroyed the Main Stand in 1920, and the club moved to the 84,000 capacity Maine Road three years later. Maine Road, nicknamed the \"Wembley of the North\" by its designers, hosted the largest-ever crowd at an English club ground when 84,569 attended an FA Cup tie against Stoke City on 3 March 1934.[181] Though Maine Road was redeveloped several times over its 80-year lifespan, by 1995 its capacity was restricted to 32,000, prompting the search for a new ground which culminated in the move to the City of Manchester Stadium in 2003; it was renamed the Etihad Stadium in 2011.[182] In September 2024, Manchester City revealed plans to expand the North Stand of the Etihad Stadium, increasing the total capacity to 61,000. The expanded section is scheduled to open for the start of the 2025/26 season. The project also includes the construction of a hotel, office premises for club staff and a new fan zone .[183] Based on trophy count, Manchester City are one of the most successful teams in England – their thirty-six major domestic, European and worldwide honours rank them third on the list of most decorated sides in England, ahead of Chelsea with 34. The club's first major trophy was the 1904 FA Cup,[184] though they had previously won three regional Manchester Cups before that point.[185] Their first top division league title came in the 1936–37 season,[14] with the first Charity Shield won in the following August.[14] City's first League Cup and European trophy both came at the end of the 1969–70 season, the two trophies also constituting the team's first double of any kind.[14] In the 2018–19 season, City became the first team to claim all of the major English trophies available in a single season, winning not just the Premier League, FA Cup, and League Cup, but also the Community Shield.[186] The 1970 Cup Winners' Cup victory remained City's only European trophy until their triumph in the 2022–23 UEFA Champions League.[187][65] They have reached the semi-finals of the Champions League four times overall, losing in 2016, then winning en route to their first-ever final in 2021, losing in 2022, and winning en route to their maiden European Cup title in 2023.[188][189] Manchester City jointly held the record for most second division titles with Leicester City, both clubs having won the league on seven occasions, before Leicester clinched their eighth title in 2023–24.[190] Man City's first victory was in 1898–99, and the most recent in 2001–02.[14]",

                "content": "Kirk Daniel Cousins (born August 19, 1988) is an American professional football quarterback for the Atlanta Falcons of the National Football League (NFL). He played college football for the Michigan State Spartans and was selected by the Washington Redskins in the fourth round of the 2012 NFL draft. Cousins ranks sixth all-time in completion percentage with at least 1,500 pass attempts[2] and is 11th in the NFL's all-time regular season career passer rating. Cousins spent his first three seasons with the Redskins as a backup to Robert Griffin III before replacing an injured Griffin in 2015 and leading the team to a division title. With Washington, Cousins set several franchise records and was named to the 2017 Pro Bowl. After two years of signing franchise tags and being unable to agree with the team on a long-term deal, Cousins signed a fully guaranteed three-year US$84 million contract with the Minnesota Vikings as a free agent in 2018. In six seasons with the Vikings, he earned three Pro Bowl selections and ranks third in the Vikings' all-time passing yards list. Cousins signed a four-year deal with the Falcons in 2024. Kirk Cousins was born to Don Cousins[3] and Maryann Cousins, the second oldest of their three children. Born in Barrington, Illinois[4][5] on August 19, 1988,[4] Cousins attended Holland Christian High School in Holland, Michigan, where he starred in football, baseball (as a third baseman and a pitcher), and basketball for the Maroons athletic teams. He broke his ankle in his junior year and was forced to attend camps in order to make an impression with recruiting colleges.[6] Cousins finished his high school football career with 3,204 passing yards, 40 touchdowns, and 18 interceptions.[7] After high school, Cousins was set to sign with Toledo or Western Michigan, until Mark Dantonio became the head coach at Michigan State in 2007. After Dantonio failed to sign his top targets at quarterback, he offered a scholarship to Cousins, which he accepted. He also participated in the Athletes in Action sports ministry.[citation needed] Sources: Cousins redshirted for the 2007 season.[8] In 2008, he spent the season as the backup quarterback to Brian Hoyer. He played in five games passing for a total of 310 yards and two touchdowns and one interception.[9][10] In 2009, he competed for and won the starting quarterback job against teammate Keith Nichol. He led Michigan State to a 6–7 (4–4) season with 19 touchdowns, nine interceptions and 2,680 passing yards in 12 games.[11] In 2010, he led Michigan State to an 11–2 (7–1) record and a share of the Big Ten Conference Championship.[12][13][14] In 2011, the Spartans went 11–3 (7–2) and played in the first-ever Big Ten Football Championship Game.[15][16] He led the Big Ten Conference in pass completions, pass attempts, and passing yards in 2011.[17] Cousins was named second-team All-Big Ten by the coaches, and played his final game as a Michigan State Spartan on January 2, 2012, defeating the Georgia Bulldogs in the Outback Bowl.[18] His teams posted an undefeated 4–0 record against the in-state rival Michigan Wolverines.[19] Cousins won the 2011 Lowes's Senior CLASS Award.[20] Cousins majored in kinesiology.[21] Cousins was selected by the Washington Redskins as the seventh choice in the fourth round of the 2012 NFL draft, making him the 102nd draft pick overall.[25] The pick surprised many analysts, as the Redskins had drafted 2011 Heisman Trophy winner Robert Griffin III with the second overall pick to be their franchise quarterback. The Redskins acquired the Griffin pick by giving the St. Louis Rams four high-value draft picks over three years.[26] Cousins was viewed as an insurance policy in case Griffin was injured, with Redskins head coach Mike Shanahan saying \"You're one or two plays away from being the starter...And if I see that value out there on the third day of the draft, I'm going to take that.\"[27] The Redskins drafting Griffin and Cousins in the same draft echoed the team's strategy in the 1994 NFL draft, when the team drafted Heath Shuler with the third overall pick and later drafted Gus Frerotte in the seventh round.[28] On May 31, 2012, Cousins signed a four-year contract with the Redskins.[29] In the second game of the preseason against the Chicago Bears, Cousins threw three touchdowns in the fourth quarter, though the Redskins would go on to lose 33–31.[30] In the fourth and final game of preseason, against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, Cousins completed 15 of 27 passes for 222 yards as the Redskins won 30–3. He was named the backup quarterback over incumbent starter Rex Grossman. Cousins made his NFL debut in the third quarter of a Week 5 loss to the Atlanta Falcons after Griffin suffered a concussion. Cousins threw his first NFL touchdown pass on a 77-yard pass to Santana Moss but threw two interceptions in the last two series of the game while trying to tie the game.[31] Cousins' second NFL appearance came in Week 14 against the Baltimore Ravens. On the final drive of the game, with the Redskins down 8, Griffin suffered a knee injury. Cousins went 2–2 and finished the drive with an 11-yard touchdown pass to Pierre Garçon with 29 seconds remaining, to bring the Redskins within 2 points of the Ravens. On the two-point conversion, Shanahan called for a run-pass option, and Cousins scored on a quarterback draw to tie the game at 28. The Redskins would win in overtime 31–28.[32] The following week, on December 15, 2012, Cousins was announced as the Redskins starter for the Week 15 game against the Cleveland Browns, marking his first NFL start.[33] After a slow first half, Cousins rallied the offense to a 28-point second half. Cousins finished the day 26-of-37 for 329 yards with 2 touchdown passes, bringing the Redskins a 38–21 win.[34][35] Later that week, Cousins was voted the Pepsi NFL Rookie of the Week, becoming the third Redskins rookie to receive the honor that season (after Griffin and Alfred Morris).[36] Cousins finished his rookie year with 466 passing yards, four touchdowns, and three interceptions in three games and one start.[37] The Redskins finished atop the NFC East with a 10–6 record.[38] In the Wild Card Round, they faced the Seattle Seahawks. In the 24–14 loss, Cousins came into the game late in the fourth quarter in relief of an injured Griffin. He finished the game 3-of-10 for 31 yards and was unable to rally the team to victory.[39] On December 11, 2013, Cousins was named starting quarterback for the rest of the year after Shanahan deactivated Robert Griffin III for the remainder of the season in order to protect him for the following year, with Rex Grossman as Cousins's backup.[40][41] In Week 15, in a narrow 27–26 loss to the Falcons, he finished 29-of-45 for 381 yards, three touchdowns, and two interceptions.[42] Cousins finished his second professional season with 854 passing yards, four touchdowns, and seven interceptions in five games and three starts.[43] On February 2, 2014, it was reported that Cousins had stated that he was open to a trade from the Redskins.[44] In March, Cousins announced that he would be giving the #12 jersey to incoming new wide receiver Andre Roberts for the price of a $12,000 donation to the Kirk Cousins Football Camp. Cousins then switched over to the #8 jersey, a number he wore throughout his high school and college career.[45] During Week 2 against the Jacksonville Jaguars, Cousins came in relief of Griffin who left the game with a dislocated ankle. Cousins finished the game with 250 passing yards and two touchdowns in a 41–10 victory.[46] In the next game against the Philadelphia Eagles, Cousins threw for 427 yards, the first game he had over 400 passing yards. Washington still lost an ensuing slugfest to the Eagles 37–34.[47] The following week against the New York Giants, Cousins had a poor showing, throwing for a touchdown with four interceptions and a lost fumble.[48] The Redskins were blown out 45–14 with a total of 6 turnovers. In Week 5, against the defending Super Bowl champion Seahawks, Cousins showed progress from the embarrassing loss to the Giants by throwing for two touchdowns without an interception, including a 68-yard touchdown pass to DeSean Jackson. Despite the solid performance from Cousins, the Redskins lost by a score of 27–17.[49] Following a poor performance in the first half in the Week 7 game against the Tennessee Titans, he was benched at halftime in favor of backup quarterback Colt McCoy, and did not play in any more games for the remainder of the season.[50] On August 31, 2015, Cousins was named the starter for the season over Robert Griffin III.[51] On October 4, Cousins led a 90-yard game-winning drive against the Eagles, his first since 2012, when he threw a touchdown pass to Pierre Garçon with under a minute left in the fourth quarter, winning the game 23–20.[52] On October 25, Cousins helped lead the Redskins to their largest comeback win in franchise history. After being down 24–0 in the second quarter against the Buccaneers at home, Cousins finished with 317 yards and four total touchdowns, three passing and one rushing, throwing the final touchdown pass to Jordan Reed in the final seconds of the game.[53] Cousins also tied a franchise record for completions in a game with 33, tying Jason Campbell who did the same in 2007. When heading into the locker room after the game, Cousins was caught on camera shouting, \"You like that?!\" to reporters, which later become a catchphrase used by Cousins, his teammates, and Redskins fans throughout the rest of the season.[54] Cousins and his brother Kyle applied to trademark the catchphrase later in the season and began to sell T-shirts with the phrase to raise money for the International Justice Mission charitable organization.[55][56][57][58] He was named National Football Conference (NFC) Offensive Player of the Week for his game against Tampa Bay.[59] Against the New Orleans Saints on November 15, Cousins threw for a career-high four touchdowns, as well as posting a perfect passer rating of 158.3, making him the first Redskins quarterback since 1950 to do that with at least 20 attempts.[a][60][61] He was named NFC Offensive Player of the Week for this game against the Saints.[62] Against the Buffalo Bills on December 20, Cousins passed for four touchdowns, and ran for another in a Redskins victory, marking his second four-touchdown passing game of the season.[63] The following week against the Eagles, Cousins took an ill-advised quarterback kneel inside the Eagles' redzone with six seconds left before halftime, running out the clock and forgoing any chance of adding upon Washington's lead.[64] Despite that, Cousins eventually passed for four touchdowns in the game, his second consecutive four-touchdown performance and third overall on the season. The performance led to the Redskins' victory over the Eagles with a score of 38–24, which allowed the team to win the NFC East division title for the first time since Griffin III did it in 2012.[65][66] Cousins was named NFC Offensive Player of the Month for December.[67] Cousins finished the 2015 season posting the highest completion percentage (74.7) in home games in NFL history, with a minimum of 100 attempts, leading the Redskins to a 6–2 record at home.[68] He also became the first Redskins quarterback since Sonny Jurgensen in 1970 to have at least four passing touchdowns in three or more games in one season.[69] Against the Dallas Cowboys on January 3, 2016, he set the Redskins single-season passing yardage record with 4,166, passing Jay Schroeder who had 4,109 in 1986.[70] He also finished the season with 29 passing touchdowns, second in Redskins history behind Jurgensen who had 31 in 1967, while posting a league-leading completion percentage of 69.8%, second in team history behind Sammy Baugh who completed 70.3% of his passes in 1945.[70] Against the Green Bay Packers in the Wild Card Round on January 10, 2016, Cousins completed 29-of-46 passes for 329 yards and scored two touchdowns (one passing, one rushing), but was sacked six times and lost one fumble. The Redskins lost 35–18, ending their season.[71] He was named the PFWA Most Improved Player.[72] He was ranked 85th by his fellow players on the NFL Top 100 Players of 2016.[73] Cousins was set to become an unrestricted free agent in the 2016 offseason, but the Redskins used the non-exclusive franchise tag on him on March 1, 2016. The tag acted as a one-year, $20 million contract, which prevented other teams in the league from signing him without giving up two first round draft picks to the Redskins.[74][75] During the Week 8 International Series game against the Cincinnati Bengals at Wembley Stadium in London, Cousins threw for a career-high 458 passing yards, as the game ended in a 27–27 tie.[76] As the game ended in a tie, it also marked the first time a game held in London went into overtime. Three weeks later against the Packers, Cousins threw for 375 yards along with three touchdowns in a 42–24 victory, earning him his third NFC Offensive Player of the Week award.[77] After the game, Cousins was caught on camera asking Redskins general manager Scot McCloughan \"How you like me now?\" which many in the media believed Cousins was addressing concerns about his potentially lucrative long-term contract with the team next season.[78] In a Thanksgiving Day 31–26 road loss against the Cowboys, Cousins completed 41 of 53 passes for 449 yards with three touchdowns and no interceptions, putting him second on the list of most passing yards in a Thanksgiving Day game in NFL history.[79] For his accomplishments in the month of November, Cousins won the NFC Offensive Player Of The Month award, his second time winning the award.[80][81] In Week 16, on Christmas Eve, against the Bears, Cousins had a career-high two rushing touchdowns in the 41–21 road victory.[82] Despite missing the playoffs, Cousins led the team to a winning record of 8–7–1 and finished the season with a career-high 4,917 passing yards, which was third in the NFL behind Drew Brees and Matt Ryan, breaking various personal and team records he had set the previous year.[83][84] Cousins' 67% completion percentage ranked No. 7 and his 45.7% deep-ball completion percentage ranked No. 5 among NFL quarterbacks in 2016.[85] Due to his performance in the season, Cousins was named to his first Pro Bowl, replacing Atlanta Falcons quarterback Matt Ryan, who could not take part in the game due to the Falcons' appearance in Super Bowl LI.[86] During the game, Cousins played throughout most of the second half, and notably forced a fumble on Denver Broncos cornerback Aqib Talib after chasing him down the field after throwing an interception late in the fourth quarter.[87] Cousins was also ranked 70th by his peers on the NFL Top 100 Players of 2017.[88] Again set to become an unrestricted free agent in the offseason, Cousins and the Redskins attempted to work out a long-term deal before the start of free agency, but could only come to an agreement on the exclusive franchise tag on February 28, 2017, becoming the first quarterback in NFL history to be franchise-tagged in consecutive years.[89] During a Week 3 27–10 victory over the Oakland Raiders on NBC Sunday Night Football, Cousins went 25-for-30 for a season-high 365 yards and three touchdowns, earning him his fourth NFC Offensive Player of the Week award of his career.[90][91][92] During Week 10 against the Minnesota Vikings, Cousins tied his single-game career-high with two rushing touchdowns in the 38–30 loss.[93] The Redskins finished the 2017 season with a 7–9 record and missed the playoffs.[94] Cousins finished the season 347-of-540 for 4,093 yards, 27 touchdowns, and 13 interceptions.[95] The 2017 season marked his third consecutive season of passing for at least 4,000 yards.

                "content": "By Miguel Angel Fernandez Castro December 19, 2024 01:21PM EDT December 19, 2024 01:21PM EDT By Miguel Angel Fernandez Castro Kirk Cousins was looking for an opportunity to revamp his career when he signed with the Atlanta Falcons. After being the star of the Minnesota Vikings, the quarterback chose to leave the team and signed Arthur Blank’s offer: a four-year, $180 million contract. The goal was very clear. Become the leader of a franchise desperately seeking to win the first Super Bowl in its history. Cousins would be the key piece for the new head coach, Raheem Morris. However, the results have not been as expected. The Falcons hold a 7-7 record and could miss the playoffs in a division dominated by Baker Mayfield and the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. Because of this, a key decision has been made by Morris. Michael Penix Jr. will be the starting quarterback for the Atlanta Falcons in the game against the New York Giants. The team’s front office knew this was the Plan B ever since they surprised the NFL by drafting him with the No. 8 overall pick. Given this scenario, the big question is how Cousins would react to being replaced by a rookie. Kirk displayed great maturity and assured that he would support the young prospect from Washington in every way possible. see also NFL News: Falcons HC Raheem Morris issues strong message to Kirk Cousins after win vs Raiders “It’s pro football and there’s a standard that I have for myself, that the team has for me, that, unfortunately, I wasn’t playing up to that standard consistently enough. And so, it is what it is, and you roll with it and now you still get ready. One play away kind of a thing and support Mike and just try to help our team be able to find a way to win these last three to get in the playoffs. That’s what it’s all about.

                "content": "U.S. Representatives Garret Graves (R-LA-06) and Abigail Spanberger (D-VA-07) today released the following statement after a bipartisan majority of the U.S. Senate voted to pass the Social Security Fairness Act, their bipartisan legislation to eliminate the Windfall Elimination Provision (WEP) and the Government Pension Offset (GPO). The bill now heads to the president’s desk to be signed into law. “Finally, Congress showed up for the millions of Americans — police officers, firefighters, teachers, federal employees, and other local and state public servants — who worked a second job to care for their families or began a second career to afford to live. Congress showed up for the hundreds of thousands of widows and widowers who are denied their spouses’ Social Security benefits while grappling with their loss,” said Graves and Spanberger. “Louisianians, Virginians and Americans across the country have for more than four decades implored their representatives in Congress to listen to their stories and protect their retirement security and ability to support their families. Today, a bipartisan majority of the U.S. Senate voted to correct this glaring injustice.” The lawmakers continued, “For years, we’ve worked alongside these advocates to build overwhelming bipartisan support among our colleagues, urged leadership to give these reforms the consideration impacted Americans deserve, and ultimately force a vote on the U.S. House floor to put an end to this theft. We will not take our foot off the gas until this bill reaches the president’s desk and is signed into law to repeal the WEP and GPO.” Before Congress left Capitol Hill for the October district work period, Graves and Spanberger filed a discharge petition for their Social Security Fairness Act — which secured the required 218 signatures needed to force a vote in the U.S. House. Last month, a bipartisan majority of the U.S. House voted to pass the legislation and send it to the U.S. Senate. BACKGROUND The Windfall Elimination Provision and the Government Pension Offset were added to the Social Security Act in 1983. These two provisions reduce or eliminate retirement benefits for more than 2.4 million Americans who devoted much of their careers to public service — including police officers, firefighters, educators, and federal, state, and local government employees. According to a nonpartisan 2024 report, the WEP denies earned benefits to more than 1.7 million Americans, and the GPO hurts more than 420,000 Social Security beneficiaries. Additionally, more than 320,000 American retirees are impacted by both the WEP and the GPO. Graves and Spanberger reintroduced the Social Security Fairness Act in January 2023 at the start of the 118th Congress. In November 2023, Graves and Spanberger urged the U.S. House Ways and Means Committee to hold a hearing on reforms to the WEP and GPO — and a hearing was held later that month. In March 2024, the lawmakers urged the Committee to take the next step to eliminate the WEP and GPO by holding a markup on their bipartisan Social Security Fairness Act. Graves and Spanberger have consistently pushed for a vote on the bill. Currently, the WEP reduces the earned Social Security benefits of an individual who also receives a public pension from a job not covered by Social Security. For example, educators who do not earn Social Security in public schools but who work part-time or during the summer in jobs covered by Social Security have reduced benefits, even though they pay into the system for enough quarters to receive benefits. Likewise, the GPO affects the spousal benefits of people who work as federal, state, or local government employees — including police officers, firefighters, and educators — if the job is not covered by Social Security. The GPO reduces by two-thirds the benefit received by surviving spouses who also collect a government pension — often offsetting benefits entirely.",

                "content": "On November 12, the U.S. House of Representatives passed the Social Security Fairness Act (H.R. 82). The legislation passed by a vote of 327-75, with one member voting “Present.” The bill would increase the Social Security benefit for many career fire and EMS personnel and their spouses. H.R 82 would repeal the Windfall Elimination Provision (WEP) and the Government Pension Offset (GPO). The Windfall Elimination Provision (WEP) is a modified benefit formula that reduces the Social Security benefits of certain retired or disabled workers, who also are entitled to pension benefits based on earnings from jobs that are not subject to the Social Security payroll tax. The Government Pension Offset (GPO) reduces the Social Security’s spouses’ or widows/ers’ benefits of most people who also receive a pension based on federal, state, or local government employment not covered by Social Security. The Senate still must vote on H.R. 82. The Senate companion bill (S. 597) was introduced by Senator Sherrod Brown (D-OH) and has 62 cosponsors. \"The IAFC community of firefighters is pleased that the House has restored full Social Security benefits for us and other public service people. The two provisions of current law – the Windfall Elimination Provision (WEP) and the Government Pension Offset (GPO) significantly impact the income and quality of life for retired firefighters.

                "title": "Ohio State Buckeyes football - Wikipedia",
                "content": "The Ohio State Buckeyes football team competes as part of the NCAA Division I Football Bowl Subdivision, representing Ohio State University in the Big Ten Conference. Ohio State has played its home games at Ohio Stadium in Columbus, Ohio, since 1922.[3] The Buckeyes are recognized by the university and NCAA as having won eight national championships,[4] including six from the major wire-service selectors: AP Poll and/or Coaches' Poll. The program has also captured 41 conference championships (2 OAC and 39 Big Ten), 10 division championships, and has compiled 10 undefeated seasons, including six perfect seasons (no losses or ties). Seven players have received the Heisman Trophy (second all-time), with the program holding the distinction of having the only two-time winner (Archie Griffin) of the award. As of 2017, the football program is valued at $1.5–2 billion,[5][6] the highest valuation of any such program in the country. NCAA's first millionaire student-athlete (Quinn Ewers) became such using NIL while in the program. After early attempts at forming a team in 1886 (led by future Nebraska governor Chester Hardy Aldrich) and 1887, football was ultimately established at the university in 1890.[7] On the site of the first OSU game, on the campus of Ohio Wesleyan University in Delaware, Ohio, on May 3, 1890, the Delaware County Historical Society has set an historical marker.[8] Some histories of Ohio State football credit George Cole, an undergraduate, and Alexander S. Lilley with introducing the sport to the campus. More recent research has challenged that claim, stating that George Cole did not persuade Lilley to coach the football team until after its first full season began that fall.[8] OSU's first home game took place at 2:30 p.m. on November 1, 1890. They played the University of Wooster on the site that was then called Recreation Park. Just east of historic German Village, the park occupied the north side of Schiller (now Whittier), between Ebner and Jaeger, in what is now Schumacher Place. OSU lost the game, 64–0. Over the next eight years, under a number of coaches, the team played to a cumulative record of 31 wins, 39 losses, and 2 ties. The first game against the University of Michigan, in Ann Arbor, was a 34–0 loss in 1897, a year that saw the low point in Buckeye football history with a 1–7–1 record. Jack Ryder was Ohio State's first paid coach, earning $150 per season, and lost his first game, against Oberlin College and John Heisman, on October 15, 1892.[9] In 1899 the university hired John Eckstorm to bring professional coaching skills to the program and immediately went undefeated.[10] In 1901, however, center John Sigrist was fatally injured in a game against Western Reserve University and the continuation of football at Ohio State was in serious question. Although the school's athletic board let the team decide its future, Eckstorm resigned.[11] In 1912, football underwent a number of developments that included joining the Western Conference, making football as part of a new Department of Athletics, and hiring Lynn W. St. John to be athletic director. Chic Harley attended East High in Columbus and was regarded as one of the greatest players to attend an Ohio high school. A well-rounded player, Harley came to Ohio State in 1916 and instantly became a fan favorite. Harley and the Buckeyes won the first Big Ten championship in school history in 1916, finishing 7–0. The team would repeat in 1917 finishing 8–0–1. In 1918, Harley left to be a pilot in the U.S. Army Air Service during World War I. With Harley's return in 1919, the Buckeyes would only lose one game, to Illinois. Harley left OSU with a career record of 22–1–1. At the time, OSU played at the small Ohio Field and Harley brought such record crowds it became necessary to open Ohio Stadium in 1922. The stadium was built entirely on fan donations and several stadium drives around the city where Harley would often appear. In 1951, when the College Football Hall of Fame opened, Harley was inducted as an inaugural member. Ohio State's first rival was Kenyon College, a small liberal arts college in Gambier, roughly 50 miles to the northeast. The Buckeyes first played them in their first season in 1890 on Nov 27, Kenyon won the first two meetings; however, Ohio State won 15 in a row and the rivalry diminished. Kenyon made it their season goal to defeat OSU. After the Bucks joined the Big Ten they stopped playing Kenyon. The all-time record stands at 17–6, OSU.[12] In hiring Francis Schmidt in March 1934 to coach its football team, Ohio State moved its program to a \"big-time\" level of competition. Schmidt was a well-established coach and an acknowledged offensive innovator. His offensive schemes were a \"wide-open\" style called \"razzle-dazzle\" and led him to be the first Buckeye football coach granted a multi-year contract. Schmidt's first four seasons saw victories over archrival Michigan, all by shut-out. The 1935 squad went 7–1, its sole loss was to Notre Dame, 18–13, in the first contest between the programs. However Schmidt's remaining seasons were less successful, except in 1939 when the Buckeyes won the Big Ten championship, and his popularity faded for a number of reasons.[13] On December 17, 1940, he resigned. Ohio State hired the coach of Massillon Washington High School football team, Paul Brown, to succeed Schmidt.[14][15] Brown's Tigers had just won their sixth straight state championship. Brown immediately changed Ohio State's style of offense, planned and organized his program in great detail, and delegated to his assistant coaches using highly structured practices. In 1942, Ohio State lost 22 veteran players to military service as the United States joined World War II, and with a team of mostly sophomores went on to lose only once in winning its first national championship. Brown accepted a commission in the United States Navy in 1944, ending his coaching run prior to the season. When Brown went into the Navy, he directed his assistant Carroll Widdoes to head the team in his absence. The 1944 team fielded 31 freshmen but went undefeated and untied, including a victory over Paul Brown's Great Lakes Navy team. Ohio State finished second in the national rankings behind Army and Les Horvath became the first Buckeye to be awarded the Heisman Trophy. Also prominent on the 1942–44 teams was the first Buckeye African American star, Bill Willis. Brown chose not to return to Ohio State after the war, going into professional football instead. Widdoes, despite having the highest two-year winning percentage of any Buckeye coach, asked to return to an assistant's position. Offensive coordinator Paul Bixler and Widdoes switched positions, and Bixler endured a mediocre 4–3–2 season. Bixler resigned and talk of Ohio State being a \"graveyard of coaches\" became commonplace, a reputation that lingered for decades.[16] Wes Fesler became head coach in 1947 but finished last in the Big Ten for the only time in team history. Ohio State improved greatly in 1948, winning 6 and losing 3, then in 1949 enjoyed a successful season due to the play of sophomore Vic Janowicz. Ohio State received the Rose Bowl invitation, where they came from behind to defeat California. In 1950, Fesler, rumored to be resigning because of pressures associated with the position and abuse of his family by anonymous critics, returned to coach the Buckeyes, who won six games in a row to move into the top ranking in the AP poll. However, the season fell apart as the Buckeyes lost to Michigan during a blizzard, a game that came to be known as the \"Snow Bowl\". Two weeks later, citing concerns about his health and family, Fesler resigned. Wayne Woodrow \"Woody\" Hayes beat out Paul Brown,[17] among others, to be named head coach on February 18, 1951. He instituted a demanding practice regimen and was both aggressive and vocal in enforcing it, alienating many players accustomed to Fesler's laid-back style. The 1951 Buckeyes won 4, lost 3, and tied 2, leaving many to question the ability of the new coach. In 1952, the team improved to 6–3 and recorded their first victory over Michigan in eight years, but after a 1953 loss to Michigan, critics called for the replacement of Hayes. In 1954, the Buckeyes were picked to finish no higher than 10th in the Big Ten. Hayes, however, had the talents of Howard \"Hopalong\" Cassady, and a historic goal-line stand against Michigan propelled Ohio State to a perfect season. Hayes led the powerhouse Buckeyes to a shared national championship (his first and the team's second). In 1955 the team again won the Big Ten, set an attendance record, and won in Ann Arbor for the first time in 18 years, while Hopalong Cassady was securing the Heisman Trophy. Ohio State passed only three times against Michigan (the sole reception was the only completion in the final three games of the year), leading to the characterization of Hayes' style of offensive play as \"three yards and a cloud of dust\". In a 1955 article in Sports Illustrated, Hayes admitted to making small personal loans to financially needy players.[18] The article resulted in a furor over possible violations of NCAA rules, and the faculty council, followed by the Big Ten and NCAA, conducted lengthy investigations. Big Ten Commissioner Kenneth \"Tug\" Wilson found Hayes and the program guilty of violations and placed it on a year's probation in 1956. In 1957, Ohio State won all of its remaining games after an opening loss to claim the Big Ten championship, then won the Rose Bowl over Oregon, and shared a national title with Auburn, for which Hayes was named Coach of the Year. In 1961, the team went undefeated to be named national champions by the FWAA but a growing conflict between academics and athletics over Ohio State's reputation as a \"football school\" resulted in a faculty council vote to decline an invitation to the Rose Bowl, resulting in much public protest and debate.[19] Over the next 6 seasons, Ohio State finished no higher than 2nd and had a losing season in 1966, and public speculation that Hayes would be replaced as a coach grew to its highest point since 1953. In 1968, Ohio State defeated the number one-ranked Purdue Boilermakers and continued to an undefeated season including a 50–14 rout of Michigan and a Rose Bowl victory over the USC Trojans that resulted in the national championship. The Class of 1970 became known as the \"super sophomores\" in 1968 and might have gone on to three consecutive national championships except for what may have been the most bitter loss in Buckeye history. The winning streak reached 22 games as Ohio State traveled to Michigan. The Buckeyes were 17-point favorites but directed by first-year coach Bo Schembechler, Michigan shocked the Buckeyes in a 24–12 upset. The 1969 loss to Michigan initiated what came to be known as \"The Ten Year War\", in which the rivalry, which pitted some of OSU's and UM's strongest teams ever, rose to the uppermost level of all sports and the competition between Schembechler and Hayes became legendary.[20] Four times between 1970 and 1975, Ohio State and Michigan were both ranked in the top five of the AP Poll before their matchup. The Wolverines entered every game during those years undefeated and won only once, a 10–7 victory in Ann Arbor on November 20, 1971. Both teams used the annual game as motivation for entire seasons and after the initial win by Michigan, played dead even at four wins and a tie apiece. Hayes had the upper hand during the first part of the war, in which Ohio State won the conference championship and went to the Rose Bowl four straight years, while Michigan won the final three. It was also an era in which through television Ohio State football again came to the forefront of national attention. Hayes set the tone in spring practice in 1970, placing a rug at the entrance to the Buckeye dressing room emblazoned with the words: \"1969 MICH 24 OSU 12 — 1970 MICH:__ OSU:__\" as a constant reminder of their objective.[21] The \"super sophomores\", now seniors, used a strong fullback-oriented offense to smash their way through the season undefeated, struggling only with Purdue the week before the Michigan game. The return match in Columbus found both teams undefeated and untied, a \"first\" in the history of the rivalry, with Michigan, ranked fourth and Ohio State fifth. Ohio State combined a powerful defense that held Michigan to only 37 yards rushing, a rushing offense employing two tight ends as blockers, and a 26-yard touchdown pass from Kern to Bruce Jankowski to win 20–9. The Buckeyes returned to the Rose Bowl to be upset by Stanford 27–17. The \"super sophomores\" had garnered a record of 27–2, the best winning percentage of any three-year period in team history, and won or shared the Big Ten title all three years. The National Football Foundation named Ohio State as a national co-champion, along with Texas, for 1970 and awarded the teams joint possession of the MacArthur Bowl. 1971 was less successful than the preceding seasons, but the middle four years of the 10-year war saw the greatest success for Hayes against Michigan, although the teams fell short of repeating their 1968 national championship. Archie Griffin began his college football career in 1972, taking advantage of new NCAA eligibility rules that allowed freshmen to compete at the varsity level. In his second game, sent in against North Carolina late in the first quarter, Griffin set a new Buckeye rushing record with 239 yards and led the team in rushing for the season with 867. The following season, Hayes installed an I-formation attack with Griffin at tailback and fellow sophomore Cornelius Greene at quarterback. The Buckeyes went undefeated with a powerful offense and impenetrable defense, achieving an average margin of victory of 31 points a game. The only blemish on their record was a 10–10 tie with Michigan after both teams had entered the game unbeaten. (The tie was more galling for the Wolverines, however, as the Big Ten selected Ohio State to represent the conference in the Rose Bowl.) Despite soundly defeating defending national champion USC, however, the tie with Michigan resulted in the Buckeyes finishing second to Notre Dame in the final AP rankings. Griffin, Randy Gradishar, Van DeCree, and John Hicks were named All-Americans; Hicks, an offensive tackle, not only won both the Outland and Lombardi Trophies but placed second in the Heisman Trophy competition. 1974 and 1975 were seasons of both elation and frustration. The Buckeyes twice more defeated Michigan, and went to two Rose Bowls, but lost both. The 1974 team seemed bound for another national championship when it was derailed by a loss to unranked Michigan State (Ohio State lost only twice in the regular season during Griffin's four-year career, both to the Spartans), and the next year, the No. 1-ranked Bucks lost 23–10 to 11th-ranked UCLA in the 1976 Rose Bowl. In all, the Buckeyes were 40–5–1 from 1972 to 1975, winning the Big Ten all four years and never losing to Michigan, but it was the losses and ties that proved important to Ohio State missing out on achieving a national championship. At any rate, Archie Griffin rushed for 5,589 yards combined in his four seasons at Ohio State while winning the Heisman Trophy in 1974 (1,695 yards rushed) and 1975 (1,450 yards).[22] The falloff in the success of Hayes' last three years was not great. His teams forged records of 9–2–1, 9–3, and 7–4–1, and made bowl appearances in all three years (the rules had changed to allow appearances in other than the Rose Bowl). However, frustrations in losing three straight years to Michigan, and other factors, resulted in growing criticism of Hayes and his methods, particularly his on-the-field fits of temper. Even so, his downfall was sudden and shocking when near the end of the nationally televised Gator Bowl, Hayes punched Clemson middle guard Charlie Bauman after Bauman intercepted a pass to kill Ohio State's last chance to win.[23] Hayes was fired after the game by Ohio State president Harold Enarson and athletic director Hugh Hindman.[24] Hayes was replaced by a former protégé, Iowa State head coach Earle Bruce.[25] Bruce inherited a strong team led by sophomore quarterback Art Schlichter but that had also lost 11 starters, and the 1979 squad exceeded pre-season expectations, ending the 3-year loss drought against Michigan and going to the Rose Bowl with an opportunity once again to be national champions. The Buckeyes lost both by a single point, 17–16, but Bruce was named Coach of the Year. His success was hailed by those in the media who saw it as a rebuke of Hayes and the start of a \"new era\".[26] 1980, however, saw the start of a trend that eventually brought criticism to Bruce, when Ohio State finished with a 9–3 record, the first of six consecutive years at 9–3. Though each of these seasons, and the 10–3 season that followed them, culminated in a bowl game, Ohio State did not appear to be any closer to a national championship than during the end of the Hayes era. Bruce's teams were not without impact players, however. All-Americans and future National Football League stars included Keith Byars, Cris Carter, Chris Spielman, John Frank, Jim Lachey, Tom Tupa, Marcus Marek, and Pepper Johnson. His program was also known for the number of notable assistant coaches on staff, including Jim Tressel, Glen Mason, Pete Carroll, Nick Saban, Urban Meyer and Dom Capers. For the first time since 1922, the Buckeyes lost three in a row in Ohio Stadium in 1982, including rematches with Stanford and Florida State, and for the second year in a row to Wisconsin, but then won seven straight, the last over BYU in the Holiday Bowl. Sophomore running back Keith Byars had a stand-out season in 1983, rushing for 1,199 yards, and Ohio State defeated the Oklahoma Sooners in Norman, but three losses in conference meant a 4th-place finish. 1984 witnessed what Bruce called \"the greatest comeback after the worst start\" when Ohio State fell behind Illinois 24–0 at home but roared back on 274 yards rushing and five touchdowns by Byars to win 45–38. Ohio State also defeated Michigan to win an outright Big Ten championship. Byars led the nation in rushing and scoring but finished second in Heisman balloting. In 1986, Bruce received a 3-year contract, the first for the modern program but the team opened with two losses, which had not occurred in over 90 years. The Buckeyes then won 9 in a row before Michigan took a close game when kicker Matt Frantz missed a field goal with a minute to play. After the season Bruce was offered the position of head coach at the University of Arizona with a 5-year contract but was persuaded to stay at his alma mater by Athletic Director Rick Bay. Hopes for a standout season in 1987 suffered a serious setback when All-American wide receiver Cris Carter was dropped from the team for signing with an agent. Indiana defeated Ohio State for the first time since 1951, 31–10, in a game that came to be known as the \"darkest day\",[27] and Ohio State lost three conference games in a row going into the Michigan game. On the Monday of Michigan week, after a weekend of rumors and speculation, Ohio State President Edward Jennings fired Bruce but tried to keep the dismissal secret until after the end of the season. Bay, who had been instrumental in keeping Bruce at Ohio State, disregarded Jennings' orders and announced the firing and his own resignation in protest. Jennings made his own situation worse by refusing to give a reason for the firing and the circumstances have been the subject of controversy since.[28] The Buckeyes enjoyed an emotional come-from-behind victory over Michigan in Ann Arbor after the entire team wore headbands bearing the word \"EARLE\", then declined an invitation to play in the Sun Bowl. John Cooper was hired as the 21st football head coach at Ohio State before the end of 1987 and before he had coached his last game at Arizona State University.[29] Cooper's coaching record at ASU and at Tulsa prior to that stood out among his credentials, as did a victory over Michigan in the 1987 Rose Bowl.[30] Cooper's 13 years as the Buckeye head coach are largely remembered in the litany of negative statistics associated with him: a notorious 2–10–1 record against Michigan, a 3–8 record in bowl games, a 5-year losing streak to Illinois to start his term and a 6–7 record overall, and blowing a 15-point 3rd quarter lead in a 28–24 loss to unranked Michigan State when the Buckeyes were the top-ranked team in the nation and en route to a national championship. However, his record also has many positives: back-to-back victories over Notre Dame, two finishes second-ranked in the polls, and three Big Ten championships (albeit shared). Cooper also recruited 15 players who were first-round draft picks in the National Football League.[31] Both 1988 and 1989 began identically: a season-opening win followed by an embarrassing loss to a highly regarded team (Pitt and USC); a rebound win against two other highly regarded programs (LSU and Boston College) followed by a loss to Illinois in the conference opener. However, 1988 saw Ohio State lose its first three conference games and a close game at home against Michigan for a 4–6–1 record, its first losing season in 22 years. In 1989 the Buckeyes won 6 consecutive Big Ten games before losing its last two to go 8–4. The most noteworthy victory occurred in Minneapolis when Ohio State overcame a 31–0 deficit to Minnesota to win 41–37. 1990 continued the pattern with a 2-win 2-loss start and an overall 7–4–1 record that included an embarrassing loss to Air Force in the Liberty Bowl. 1991 was 8–4, notable primarily as the season that sophomore running back Robert Smith quit the team. 1992, with senior Kirk Herbstreit at quarterback, and Smith back on the team was 8–3–1, but the losing string to Michigan was broken with a 13–13 tie. Persistent rumors that Cooper would resign or be fired were laid to rest when University President Gordon Gee announced he would be back in 1993.[32] The next six seasons were very successful, winning 10 or more games in five out of six, and sharing the conference championship in three. Eddie George won the Heisman Trophy in 1995 after a tremendous senior season, Ohio State defeated Notre Dame in 1995 and 1996, and won half its bowl games. But in three seasons (1993, 1995, and 1996) the Buckeyes entered the Michigan game undefeated, with the possibility of a national championship in at least one, and lost all three to underdog Wolverine teams. Ohio State had won 62 games and lost only 12, but a third of those were to Michigan. After renewing his contract and becoming a member of the \"million dollar coaching club\",[33] Cooper started sophomore Austin Moherman against the Miami Hurricanes in the nationally televised Kickoff Classic and was soundly beaten. That presaged a mediocre season in which the Buckeyes finished 6–6, ending their successful 90's run. The 2000 team was more successful, going 8–4, but criticism of Cooper among fans had risen to a clamor again and touched on many areas of the program beyond specific game records. The negative publicity rose to a peak in the days leading up to Ohio State's matchup with South Carolina in the Outback Bowl, when wide receiver Reggie Germany was suspended for having a 0.0 GPA, team captain Matt Wilhelm publicly criticized fellow player Ken-Yon Rambo, and one Buckeye lineman sued another.[34] On January 3, 2001, Cooper was fired.[35] His loss in the Outback Bowl to a team that had not even won a single game the year before was a factor in his subsequent firing, as was negative publicity regarding player behavior before and during the game. Other contributing factors included the record against Michigan (which was actually considered by most people to be the biggest reason for his firing), a reputation of inability to win \"big games\", the lack of a national championship, the perception of him as an outsider by many alumni, the poor bowl game record, and finally a perceived lack of discipline on the team. Ohio State quickly sought a replacement for Cooper and after a nationwide search hired Jim Tressel.[36] With four NCAA Division I-AA National Championships at Youngstown State University, Tressel, formerly an assistant coach for Earle Bruce, was an Ohioan who was considered to be appreciative of Buckeye football traditions. Although there were some doubts as to whether or not Tressel could repeat his earlier success at the Division 1A level, most fans and alumni met the coaching change with enthusiasm. On the day of his hiring, Jim Tressel, speaking to fans and students at a Buckeye basketball game, made a prophetic implication that he would lead the Buckeyes to beat Michigan in Ann Arbor the following November.[37] Tressel's first season was difficult as the Buckeyes finished 7–5 (all but one loss was by a touchdown or less), but he made good on his promise, beating Michigan in Ann Arbor. While its fans were optimistic about the chance for success of the 2002 team, most observers were surprised by Ohio State's National Championship.[38][39] Ohio State used strong defense, ball-control play-calling, and field position tactics to win numerous close games, a style of play characterized as \"Tresselball\",[40] and disparaged by detractors as \"the Luckeyes\".[41] The 2006 and 2007 regular seasons ended with just one combined loss and consecutive appearances in the national championship game. The Buckeyes lost both by wide margins. On January 1, 2010, the Buckeyes defeated the Oregon Ducks in The Rose Bowl Game by a score of 26–17. This ended a 3-game BCS losing streak for Ohio State, having lost 2 national championships and one Tostitos Fiesta Bowl. Terrelle Pryor was named MVP of the contest with 2 touchdown passes for a career-high 266 passing yards. In addition, he had more total yards than the entire Oregon Ducks team. In December 2010, it was announced that five student-athletes on the football team would be suspended for the first five games of the 2011 season for NCAA violations. The punishments stemmed from an incident when some of the Buckeye players received tattoos for their autographs, according to news reports. Other violations committed by the players included the selling of several items given to them by the university, such as Big Ten championship rings.[42] On December 22, 2010, the NCAA announced that five players would be suspended for the first five games of the 2011 season due to receiving improper benefits. Mike Adams, Dan Herron, DeVier Posey, Solomon Thomas, and quarterback Terrelle Pryor were found to have signed autographs in return for tattoos, as well as selling memorabilia given to them by the university.[43] In addition, Jordan Whiting was suspended for the season opener for his involvement. The scandal originated at Fine Line Tattoos and Piercings in Columbus, whose owner, Edward Rife, was being investigated for felony drug trafficking. On January 4, 2011, with all the players allowed to participate by the NCAA, the Buckeyes defeated the Arkansas Razorbacks in the Sugar Bowl by a margin of 31–26.[44] The win, along with every other one from the 2010 season, would later be vacated due to the scandal. The Buckeyes finished the season 12–1, with their only official game being a loss to Wisconsin. On March 8, 2011, OSU suspended head coach Jim Tressel for the first 2 games of the 2011 season and fined him $250,000 for not informing the university and the NCAA that he had knowledge of his players receiving improper benefits. Coach Tressel's suspension would later be increased to 5 games by the university. On May 30, 2011, Jim Tressel resigned as head coach of the Buckeyes.[45] On June 6, 2011, a story in Sports Illustrated reported that at least 28 players, including Rob Rose, T. J. Downing, Louis Irizarry, Chris Vance, C. J. Barnett, Dorien Bell, Jamaal Berry, Bo DeLande, Zach Domicone, Storm Klein, Etienne Sabino, John Simon, Nathan Williams, Jermale Hines, Devon Torrence, Donald Washington, Thaddeus Gibson, Jermil Martin, Lamaar Thomas, and Doug Worthington traded team memorabilia or used equipment for tattoos or other merchandise or services between 2002 and 2010. The report alleged that Tressel had violated NCAA bylaw 10.1, unethical conduct, three times by not acting when told of the tattoo improprieties, by signing a statement saying he knew of no violations, and for withholding information on what was going on from university officials.[46] On July 8, 2011, Ohio State University decided to vacate all victories from the 2010 football season as self-imposed punishment for major NCAA violations.[47] Former coach Jim Tressel received more than $52,000 from the university and didn't have to pay a $250,000 fine for his involvement in the scandal. His status was also changed from \"Resigned\" to \"Retired\" in keeping with his wishes to \"remain a Buckeye for life\".[48] Ohio State named Luke Fickell interim head coach for the 2011 season following Tressel's resignation, and Fickell coached the 2011 Buckeyes to a 6–7 record; going 6–6 in the regular season and losing in the Gator Bowl to Florida. On November 28, 2011, former University of Florida head coach and ESPN college football analyst Urban Meyer accepted the position of Buckeyes head coach.[49] Meyer assumed head coaching responsibilities following the Buckeyes' January 2012 Gator Bowl appearance. Meyer's first season at Ohio State did not include a postseason contest, as the Buckeyes were sanctioned with a one-year bowl ban on December 20, 2011. The NCAA sanctions also included the loss of three scholarships each year for the following three years and three years' probation to end on December 19, 2014. Ohio State was required to vacate all wins from the 2010 season, the 2010 Big Ten Conference championship and their win in the 2011 Sugar Bowl. The school's share of the Sugar Bowl proceeds was forfeited as well.[50] In Meyer's first year, the Buckeyes went a perfect 12–0, winning the 2012 Big Ten Leaders Division, though the previously mentioned sanctions kept them from playing in the 2012 Big Ten Football Championship Game and a postseason bowl game.[50] On November 23, 2013, the Buckeyes clinched their second straight Leaders Division Championship, after defeating Indiana 42–14. With the victory over Indiana, Ohio State set a team record for all-time consecutive wins, with 23. The following week, Ohio State defeated Michigan 42–41 in Ann Arbor, to increase the streak to 24. The streak ended with Ohio State's 34–24 loss to Michigan State in the 2013 Big Ten Conference Championship game on December 7, marking Meyer's first loss as the Buckeyes' head coach. On January 3, 2014, the Buckeyes were defeated by Clemson in the Orange Bowl 40–35. On November 22, 2014, the Buckeyes clinched the first-ever Big Ten East Division Championship when they defeated Indiana 42–27, earning a berth in the 2014 Big Ten Championship Game, where they defeated West Division champion Wisconsin 59–0 to win the Big Ten Conference Championship and qualified for the four-team playoff to decide the National Champion. OSU defeated Alabama in the Sugar Bowl 42–35, on January 1, 2015, to qualify for the National Championship Game against Rose Bowl winner Oregon on January 12 (the Rose and Sugar Bowls were the designated semifinal games in 2014). OSU claimed the first-ever College Football Playoff National Championship by defeating Oregon 42–20.[51][52][53] The 2015 season for the Buckeyes began with a 10–0 start before losing on a last-second field goal to Michigan State on November 21, ending the Buckeyes' quest to repeat as National Champions. However, the Buckeyes recovered their 2 next games with dominating wins over Michigan and then over Notre Dame in the Fiesta Bowl to finish the season at 12–1. The 2016 season started off great with 6 straight victories, including a win over the Oklahoma Sooners, but the streak came to an end as the team lost a heart-breaker to the Penn State Nittany Lions. The Buckeyes went on to win the rest of their regular-season games, finishing 11–1. They did not play in the Big Ten Championship as Penn State took the division. In a controversial call, the College Football Playoff committee gave Ohio State a spot in the Playoff. Ohio State lost in the Fiesta Bowl to the Clemson Tigers in an embarrassing 31–0 loss, ending the season 11–2. The 2017 season started out on a high note with a victory over the Indiana Hoosiers, but the next week the Buckeyes fell to the Oklahoma Sooners. The Buckeyes won the next 6 games, including a win over No. 2 Penn State in a revenge game of sorts. The Buckeyes suffered an embarrassing defeat against the Iowa Hawkeyes. The Buckeyes ended the season 12–2 overall, winning the rest of their games including a Big Ten Championship victory over Wisconsin and a Cotton Bowl victory over USC. Urban Meyer was suspended for the first three games of the 2018 season for mishandling domestic violence allegations against then-wide receivers coach Zach Smith. Co-Offensive coordinator and quarterbacks coach Ryan Day served as interim coach and led the Buckeyes to a 3–0 start. Meyer returned to the sidelines and coached the team to four more victories before the team suffered a loss on October 20 to Purdue, 49–20. The Buckeyes won their last four games of the regular season, including a 62–39 win over archrival Michigan, in Columbus. The win gave the Buckeyes a share of the Big Ten East Division title, and the right to face Northwestern in the Big Ten Championship Game, which Ohio State won for its second consecutive Big Ten Championship. Ohio State would go on to win the Rose Bowl over Pac-12 Champion Washington 28–23, giving Ohio State their 8th Rose Bowl win. On December 4, 2018, the university announced that Meyer would retire after the 2019 Rose Bowl and be replaced by co-offensive coordinator Ryan Day.[54][55] In Day's first year, the Buckeyes went a perfect 13–0, including a win over archrival Michigan by a score of 56–27 and defeating Wisconsin for the Big Ten Championship. They would earn a spot in the College Football Playoff but would lose to Clemson 29–23 in the 2019 Fiesta Bowl. In Day's second year, the Big Ten season didn't start until late October due to the COVID-19 pandemic, and the Buckeyes would only play five out of a scheduled eight games due to several virus-related cancellations - including the Michigan game. Nevertheless, the Buckeyes would go 5–0 in the regular season, win the East Division title, and go on to beat Northwestern 22–10 in the Big Ten Championship Game, giving Day his second straight conference title. On January 1, 2021, the Buckeyes defeated Clemson 49–28 to win the Sugar Bowl in a rematch of the 2019 Fiesta Bowl to advance to the CFP National Championship Game against Alabama on January 11, which they lost 52–24. On September 11, 2021, he suffered his first regular season loss as head coach when the Oregon Ducks defeated the Buckeyes 35–28 in the 2nd game of the season. Ohio State's streak of defeating Michigan also came to an end on November 27, 2021, in Ann Arbor, when Ohio State lost 42–27.[56] They then won the 2022 Rose Bowl against Utah 48–45 on January 1, 2022. In 2022, Day led the team to an 11–0 record and was ranked #2 going into the Michigan game, which #3 Michigan would win 45–23 on November 26, 2022 (outscoring the Buckeyes 28–3 in the second half), in Ohio State's first loss to Michigan in Columbus since 2000, and first back–to–back losses to Michigan since 1999–2000. The Buckeyes would go on to play the defending national champion Georgia Bulldogs in the 2022 national semifinal game on New Year's Eve, taking a 14-point lead into the fourth quarter, but ultimately seeing their season come to an end with a 42–41 loss.[57] Kicker Noah Ruggles' would-be game-winning field goal attempt sailed wide left just as the clock struck midnight on New Year's Day, 2023. In 2023, Day led the team to an 11–0 record and was ranked #2 going into the Michigan game for the second consecutive year. This time, Michigan won by six points 30–24 on November 25, 2023. This marked the first three game losing streak to Michigan since 1995–97. The Buckeyes were then invited to the 2023 Cotton Bowl, where they lost to the Missouri Tigers 14–3 on December 29, 2023. Ohio State recognizes eight national championships from NCAA-designated \"consensus\" selectors,[58][59] including six (1942, 1954, 1957, 1968, 2002, 2014) from the major wire-service: AP Poll and/or Coaches' Poll.[59][60] The following is a list of Ohio State's claimed national championships: Ohio State has also been selected an additional seven times by various NCAA-designated \"major selectors\", in 1933, 1944, 1969, 1973, 1974, 1975, and 2006.[59][63][64] However, the Buckeyes do not recognize any of those championships. Ohio State joined the Big Ten in 1912; before that they were a member of the Ohio Athletic Conference (OAC) and won two OAC titles. Ohio State has won a championship in the Big Ten 39 times, second-most in the conference.[65] † Co-champions From 2011 to 2023, Big Ten had divisions to decide who would play for the conference championship. The divisions were known as Legends and Leaders from 2011 to 2013. In 2014, the divisions were realigned geographically into East and West. The divisional format ended for the 2024 season. † Co-champions Ohio State has played in 56 bowl games in which they are 28–29–0.[66] The Buckeyes have been to the Rose Bowl 16 times. Below are the team's most recent bowl games. † Vacated Ohio State University Marching Band[68] is the most visible and possibly best-known tradition of Ohio State football.[69] Home games are preceded by four marching band traditions:[70] The series versus Illinois began in 1902 and became the longest continuous series in 2002 when the schools played in their 89th consecutive year. In 2007, Ohio State was given their only defeat of the regular season by the Illini. Through the 2019 season, Ohio State leads the series 68–30–4.[71] Ohio State's first game with Michigan dates to 1897. Michigan leads the series 62–51–6 through the 2024 season.[72]This rivalry is considered to be Buckeyes' biggest rivalry. All the appearances of the letter M in Ohio Stadium are crossed out with red tape. Halftime shows during OSU games often feature something bad happening to the Michigan logo. When Penn State was added to the Big Ten conference football play in 1993, every member was given two designated rivals, teams to be played every year, with the other conference teams rotated out of the schedule at regular intervals. For geographic convenience, the Big Ten named Penn State as Ohio State's new designated rival in addition to Michigan. Ohio State leads the series 25–14 through the 2024 season.[73] The Buckeyes have had 24 head coaches in their 121-year history. Of the team's eight national championships to date, Woody Hayes won five, with Paul Brown, Jim Tressel, and Urban Meyer each having one. Roster Last update: August 22, 2024 [74] This table reflects the results of Big Ten match-ups when both OSU and its opponent were members of the conference through November 9, 2019.[75] Ohio State began Big Ten play in 1913. Examples of excluded results are Chicago after 1939, Michigan between 1907 and 1916, Michigan State before 1953, Penn State before 1993, and Nebraska before 2011 (see Big Ten History for further information). Ohio State's vacated wins from 2010 are not included (see 2010 Ohio State Buckeyes football team for further information). Through the 2006 season, Ohio State players have by a significant margin won more trophies than any other NCAA Division 1A program. Ohio State players have won 34 of the listed major awards, with the next closest being 26 (Oklahoma). Ohio State is the only university to have received each of the awards at least once. Of the five awards created prior to 1980 (Heisman, Lombardi, Maxwell, Outland, and Walter Camp), Ohio State has received the most with 25 (Notre Dame follows with 23). Although these numbers are cited as \"retired\" on Ohio State website,[76] they are considered enshrined rather than retired, and are available to be worn. All previously retired jersey numbers remain retired.[77] In 2020, the NCAA approved the use of the No. 0.[78] In order to further pay tribute to Bill Willis, Coach Day decided to start a new tradition and choose the player who will wear the number each season.[79] Note: Due to number restrictions, Thayer Munford could not wear number 0. Instead, he wore his regular number and honored the award with a patch. Two head coaches have also been honored by the Buckeyes, with banners at Ohio Stadium: Ohio State players have won the Heisman Trophy seven times, which ties Notre Dame and Oklahoma for the second most awards for any school, behind only USC with eight. Archie Griffin is the only two-time recipient in the history of the award.[80] Ohio State players have won the Lombardi Award six times: Four Ohio State players have won the Maxwell Award: Four Ohio State players have won the Outland Trophy: Ohio State players have won the Walter Camp Award four times: Ohio State Players have won the Fred Biletnikoff Award twice: Ohio State Players have won the Bronko Nagurski Trophy award twice: Ohio State players have won the Dick Butkus Award twice: Ohio State players have won the Jim Thorpe Award twice: Ohio State players have won the Dave Rimington Trophy four times: Ohio State players have won the Chicago Tribune Silver Football award 23 times: Ohio State players have won the Graham–George Offensive Player of the Year 13 times: Ohio State players have won the Nagurski–Woodson Defensive Player of the Year 11 times: Through 2017, 199 Buckeyes have been named first team All-Americans since 1914. Of those 85 have been consensus picks. 388 have been named to the All-Big Ten team, and 16 have won the Chicago Tribune Silver Football, the Big Ten's Most Valuable Player award, including Troy Smith for 2006. The Athletic Directors of the Big Ten Conference voted Eddie George Big Ten-Jesse Owens Athlete of the Year for 1996. On November 22, 2006, ten Buckeyes were named to either the Coaches or Conference media All-Big Ten First Team selections for the 2006 season, and seven were named to both. Troy Smith was named Big Ten Offensive Player of the Year. Four other Buckeyes received Second Team honors.

WBNS/Columbus (1460 AM) and sister station WBNS-FM/Columbus (97.1 FM) serve as flagship stations, with more than 60 affiliates in Ohio, and two additional affiliates in West Virginia. Paul Keels is the play-by-play announcer, while former Buckeye left guard Jim Lachey serves as color analyst. They are joined by sideline reporter Matt Andrews and Skip Mosic, host of the network pregame and halftime shows.[82] WBNS-TV (channel 10) in Columbus is the long-standing \"official TV home\" of the Buckeyes, airing the official coach's show Game Time with Ryan Day (simulcast statewide on Bally Sports Ohio).[83] In addition, Ohio State football games are broadcast by their student radio organization, Scarlet and Gray Sports Radio on OhioStateSports.net Schedule announced October 5, 2023[84] (*) denotes protected matchup Announced schedules as of September 28, 2023.[85] In 2011, a study conducted by Nate Silver of the New York Times, which he described as \"not quite scientific,\" determined that Ohio State had the most fans of any college football team.[86]",

                "content": "Patrick Lavon Mahomes II[5] (/məˈhoʊmz/;[6] born September 17, 1995) is an American professional football quarterback for the Kansas City Chiefs of the National Football League (NFL). Mahomes has led the Chiefs to six consecutive AFC Championship Game appearances and four Super Bowl appearances since becoming the team's starting quarterback in 2018. He is one of five quarterbacks in NFL history to win three or more Super Bowls as a starter.[7][8] Mahomes's career accolades through seven seasons in the NFL have earned him widespread praise from sports journalists, and he is considered to be one of the greatest quarterbacks of all time.[9][10][11] Mahomes played college football and baseball for the Texas Tech Red Raiders. Following his sophomore year, he quit baseball to focus solely on football.[12] In his junior year, he led all NCAA Division I FBS players in multiple categories including passing yards (5,052) and total touchdowns (53). He was selected 10th overall by the Kansas City Chiefs in the 2017 NFL draft. Mahomes spent his rookie season as the backup to Alex Smith. He was named the starter in 2018 after the Chiefs traded Smith to the Washington Redskins. That season, Mahomes threw for 5,097 yards, 50 touchdowns, and 12 interceptions. He became the only quarterback in history to throw for more than 5,000 yards in a single season in both college and in the NFL. He joined Peyton Manning as the only players in NFL history to throw for 5,000 yards and 50 passing touchdowns in the same season.[13] For his performance in his first season as starter, he was named to the Pro Bowl, named first-team All-Pro, and won the NFL Offensive Player of the Year and NFL Most Valuable Player awards. Mahomes is one of four black quarterbacks to win the AP MVP award.[b][14] In the 2019 season, Mahomes led the Chiefs to Super Bowl LIV, their first Super Bowl appearance in 50 years, where they defeated the San Francisco 49ers.[15] Mahomes was awarded the Super Bowl MVP for his performance, the second black quarterback and youngest overall to do so.[c][16] He is also the third African American quarterback to win a Super Bowl.[d] In 2020, Mahomes signed a 10-year contract extension worth $477 million with another $26 million in potential bonuses, for a total of $503 million, making it the fourth-largest known contract in sporting history.[18][19] The year after signing his contract, he led the Chiefs to their second consecutive Super Bowl appearance, but they lost to the Tampa Bay Buccaneers in Super Bowl LV. In the 2022 season, Mahomes won his second career NFL MVP and his second Super Bowl MVP in Super Bowl LVII after the Chiefs defeated the Philadelphia Eagles, becoming the first player to win NFL MVP and Super Bowl MVP in the same year since Kurt Warner in 1999, and joined Tom Brady and Joe Montana as the only quarterbacks to win multiple regular season and Super Bowl MVPs.[20][21] In the 2023 season, he won his third Super Bowl MVP after the Chiefs defeated the 49ers in Super Bowl LVIII.

In baseball, he threw a no-hitter with 16 strikeouts in a game his senior year.[35] He was named the Maxpreps Male Athlete of the Year for 2013–2014.[36] Mahomes was rated by Rivals.com as a three-star football recruit and was ranked as the 12th best dual-threat quarterback in his class. He received offers from Texas Tech, Rice, and Houston.[37] He committed to Texas Tech University.[38] Mahomes was also a top prospect for the 2014 Major League Baseball draft, but was not expected to be selected high due to his commitment to Texas Tech.[39][40][41] He was selected by the Detroit Tigers in the 37th round of the 2014 MLB draft, but did not sign a contract.[42] Mahomes entered his freshman season at Texas Tech as a backup to Davis Webb.[43] He saw his first career action against the Oklahoma State Cowboys after Webb left the game with an injury, completing two of five passes for 20 yards for one touchdown and an interception.[44] After Webb was again injured, Mahomes started his first career game against the Texas Longhorns.[45] He completed 13 of 21 passes for 109 yards in the 34–13 loss.[46][47] Mahomes remained the starter for the season's final three games.

Mahomes helped lead the Red Raiders to a 7–6 season with numerous productive outings throughout the season.[52] He recorded ten games going over 350 passing yards, including four games going over 400. He passed for at least three touchdowns in eight of the games, including a five-touchdown performance against the Iowa State Cyclones on October 10.[53] Overall, in the 2015 season, he led the Big 12 Conference with 364 pass completions on 573 attempts for 4,653 yards, 36 touchdowns, and 15 interceptions.[54][55] Mahomes appeared in three games as a baseball player, recording no hits in two at bats, and three runs allowed, as a pitcher.[56] Prior to the start of the 2016 season, Mahomes announced that he was leaving baseball to focus on football.[50] Mahomes had a very productive junior season. In the month of September alone, Mahomes passed for 18 touchdowns to three interceptions while rushing for four touchdowns. He averaged 442.5 passing yards per game that month, which included a 540-yard game against the Arizona State Sun Devils in the Red Raiders' second game.[57] Mahomes started the month of October with 504 passing yards, two passing touchdowns, and three rushing touchdowns in a losing effort to the Kansas State Wildcats.[58] On October 22, Mahomes set multiple NCAA, Big 12, and school records in a 66–59 loss to the Oklahoma Sooners at home. Mahomes broke the NCAA FBS records for single-game total offense with 819 yards. He tied the NCAA record for single game passing yards with 734. He fell one short of the record for most attempts at 88. Overall, the game set NCAA records for most combined yards of total offense with 1,708 combined passing yards, and total offense by two players (the other was Oklahoma quarterback Baker Mayfield).[59] The 125 combined points are the second most all time involving ranked teams.[59] Following the Oklahoma game, the Red Raiders defeated the TCU Horned Frogs before dropping three consecutive games to finish outside bowl eligibility with a 5–7 record.

Symons as other Red Raiders to have won the award.[62] He was named an Academic All-America second team by the College Sports Information Directors of America.[63] Mahomes announced on January 3, 2017, that he would forgo his last year of college eligibility and enter the NFL draft.[64] Mahomes was projected to be a first or second round pick by the majority of analysts and scouts.[65] During the throwing drills at the NFL Scouting Combine, his passes were clocked at 60 mph, tying Logan Thomas and Bryan Bennett for the fastest pass ever recorded there.[66] Mahomes was ranked second best quarterback by SI.com,[67] third by ESPN,[68] and fourth by NFLDraftScout.com.[69] Representatives from 28 NFL teams attended his pro day at Texas Tech. He became one of the fastest rising prospects during the draft process and had 18 private workouts and official team visits, the most for any prospect in 2017.[70] Among the coaches that he had workouts and visits with were the Arizona Cardinals head coach Bruce Arians, New Orleans Saints head coach Sean Payton, Cincinnati Bengals quarterbacks coach Bill Lazor, and coaches from the Los Angeles Chargers, Cleveland Browns, Chicago Bears, and Pittsburgh Steelers.[71] The Kansas City Chiefs selected Mahomes in the first round (10th overall) of the 2017 NFL draft.[74] The Chiefs, originally slated to have the 27th overall selection, traded up in the draft with the Buffalo Bills for the 10th overall selection. The Chiefs traded their first round pick and a third round pick in 2017, and the Chiefs' first round pick in the 2018 NFL draft for the selection.[75] He was the first quarterback selected by the Chiefs in the first round since selecting Todd Blackledge seventh overall in the 1983 NFL draft.[76] On July 20, 2017, the Chiefs signed Mahomes to a guaranteed four-year, $16.42 million contract that included a signing bonus of $10.08 million.[77] The Chiefs announced on December 27 that, with a playoff spot and the fourth seed in the playoffs secured, they would rest starter Alex Smith and give Mahomes his first career start in their week 17 game against the Denver Broncos.[78] Mahomes played most of the game and helped lead the Chiefs to a 27–24 win, completing 22 of 35 passes for 284 yards and one interception.[79][80] On January 30, 2018, the Chiefs announced they had agreed to trade Smith to the Washington Redskins, elevating Mahomes as starting quarterback.[81] In his first game as the Chiefs starting quarterback, the Chiefs beat the division rival Los Angeles Chargers by a score of 38–28.[82] Mahomes threw for 256 yards and four touchdowns with no interceptions and a 127.5 passer rating and was named AFC Offensive Player of the Week.[83] His first career touchdown came on a 58-yard pass to wide receiver Tyreek Hill in the first quarter.[84] The following week against the Pittsburgh Steelers, Mahomes threw for 326 yards, six touchdowns, no interceptions, and a passer rating of 154.8 in the 42–37 victory.

With just over 7 minutes to play, a successful 49ers challenge of a completed catch left the Chiefs facing 3rd and 15 on their own 35-yard-line. Mahomes asked his coaching staff to call the play Jet Chip Wasp, and successfully completed a deep pass to Tyreek Hill for 44 yards. This shifted momentum towards the Chiefs, who in the remaining minutes of the game went on a 21–0 run, securing their first Super Bowl victory in 50 years. Mahomes threw for 286 yards and two touchdowns, with two interceptions, and rushed for another 29 yards and touchdown run and was named Super Bowl MVP.[119] He was the youngest quarterback and third-youngest player in NFL history to earn the award.[120] He was ranked fourth by his fellow players on the NFL Top 100 Players of 2020.[121] On April 30, 2020, the Chiefs picked up the fifth-year option on Mahomes' contract.[122] On July 6, he signed a ten-year extension worth $477 million with another $26 million in potential bonuses for a total of $503 million. The contract extends through the 2031 season.[18] The contract is currently the fourth–largest contract in American professional sports history, surpassing Mike Trout's 12-year, $426.5 million contract with the Los Angeles Angels.[123] Mahomes became the first professional athlete to have a half-billion dollar contract.[124] Soccer players Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo and baseball player Shohei Ohtani have since surpassed the contract amount.[125][126] In the Chiefs' week 2 win over the Los Angeles Chargers, Mahomes achieved his fourth fourth-quarter comeback. The Chiefs trailed 17–9 entering the fourth quarter before winning in overtime 23–20. The comeback was the NFL record sixth time he overcame a 10+ point deficit to win.[127] In a week 3 win over the Baltimore Ravens, he threw for 385 passing yards, passing for four touchdowns and rushing for one.

He was diagnosed with a concussion, and as per NFL rules he was unable to return.[140] The Chiefs would win the game 22–17 with backup quarterback Chad Henne. Later that week, Mahomes announced in a press conference that he had cleared concussion protocol, saying, \"Everything has been good. I went through everything; three or four different doctors have said everything is looking good.'\"[141] In the AFC Championship in a highly anticipated matchup against the Buffalo Bills and their dual-threat quarterback Josh Allen, Mahomes threw for 325 yards and three touchdowns,[142] while leading the Chiefs to a 38–24 victory and their second consecutive Super Bowl appearance.

It was his first double-digit loss in the NFL, and also the first time since he became the Chiefs starting quarterback that the offense did not score any touchdowns.[145] The Buccaneers defense used two deep safeties to neutralize Mahomes' wide receiver targets.[146] The Chiefs' injury-ravaged offensive line was no match for the Buccaneers' pass rush defense, as Mahomes was pressured on a Super Bowl record 29 of 56 dropbacks while also being sacked three times and hit twice.[147][148] Despite the pressure, Mahomes still managed to throw several long accurate passes that were dropped by their intended targets resulting in incompletions: one fourth-quarter highlight showed Mahomes throwing a sidearm pass, despite being tripped by Buccaneers defensive end William Gholston, that ultimately hit the facemask of receiver Darrel Williams and was dropped.[149] Three days after the Super Bowl, Mahomes underwent surgery to repair a turf toe injury he suffered in the divisional round game against the Browns.[150] He was named as the top-ranked player in the NFL by his peers on the NFL Top 100 Players of 2021.[151] On March 12, 2021, Mahomes restructured his contract to save the Chiefs $17 million in salary cap space.[152] In week 1, Mahomes had three passing touchdowns, one rushing touchdown, and 337 yards in a 33–29 win over the Cleveland Browns, earning AFC Offensive Player of the Week.[153] In the Chiefs' week 2 loss to the Baltimore Ravens, he threw his first interception in the month of September of his career. The 36–35 setback marked Mahomes' first loss in the month of September in his career.[154] In a week 5 loss to the Buffalo Bills, Mahomes set career highs for rushing yards with 61 and passing attempts with 54. The 38–20 loss was only his second loss by double digits in his career and his first in the regular season.[155] Two weeks later, the Chiefs lost to the Tennessee Titans 27–3. The Chiefs' three points were the fewest points a Mahomes-led team scored since he became the starter. It was his sixth consecutive game with an interception, the longest streak of his career. He had two fumbles in the second half which gave him the most turnovers he has had in a season only seven games into the season.[156] In the Chiefs' week 9 victory over the Green Bay Packers, Mahomes threw for 166 yards, which was a career low in games he finished. By not throwing an interception for the first time since week 1, he ended a career worst streak of six consecutive games throwing an interception.[157] Mahomes bounced back the following week in a 41–14 victory over the Las Vegas Raiders, where he threw for 406 yards and five touchdowns, an NFL record-tying third game throwing for at least 400 yards and five touchdowns.

However, Mahomes stayed in the game and led Kansas City to a touchdown on their first three drives of the second half, leading the Chiefs to a 38–35 win over the Eagles.[191] He was awarded his second career Super Bowl MVP for his efforts. Mahomes also finished the season as the Most Valuable Player, and was the league leader in both passing yards and passing touchdowns, becoming the first player in NFL history to achieve all four feats in a season.[192] Mahomes was ranked as the top player in the NFL by his peers on the NFL Top 100 Players of 2023.[193] On September 18, 2023, the Chiefs and Mahomes agreed to restructure his contract, giving him $210.6 million between 2023 and 2026, the most money in NFL history over a four-season span.[194] In Week 4 against the Jets, Mahomes passed for his 200th career touchdown, becoming the fastest player in NFL history to reach that milestone, having done so in just his 84th start. His 51 rushing yards in the game also allowed him to break Alex Smith's franchise record for most career rushing yards by a quarterback.[195] After defeating the Minnesota Vikings in Week 5, Mahomes became the youngest quarterback in NFL history to defeat all other 31 teams besides their own.[196] In Week 12, Mahomes was 27-of-34 for 298 yards and two touchdowns to overcome a 14-point deficit in a 31–17 win over the Las Vegas Raiders, earning AFC Offensive Player of the Week.[197] Despite meeting these milestones, Mahomes had his worst statistical season to that point in several categories, including yards per attempt (7.0), passing yards per game (261.4), interceptions (14), and passer rating (92.6).[198][199] His receivers struggled at several points throughout the season;[200] going into Week 18, they led the league in dropped passes. Despite this, Mahomes set a career-high in completion percentage with 67.2%.[201] Mahomes was notably fined $50,000 for publicly criticizing the referees of the Chiefs' game against the Buffalo Bills, in which they lost 20–17 after a go-ahead touchdown by receiver Kadarius Toney was negated due to Toney lining up offsides.[202] Mahomes ranted as he greeted Josh Allen after the game, saying \"Fucking terrible. Fucking worst call I've ever fucking seen.\"[203] In spite of these struggles, the Chiefs once again won the division, resulting in Mahomes and several other starters resting in the final game of the season.[204] The Chiefs' playoff run began with a commanding 26–7 win over the Miami Dolphins at home in subzero temperatures in the wild card round.[205] The next week, Mahomes played his first career road playoff game, scoring a narrow 27–24 win over the Buffalo Bills in the divisional round.[206] This win gave the Chiefs their sixth consecutive AFC Championship Game, the second-most consecutive conference championship games for a franchise of all time (the most is held by the New England Patriots with 8).[207] Against the Bills, Mahomes, along with tight end Travis Kelce, broke the record for most career touchdowns in the playoffs for a quarterback/receiver duo.[208] Mahomes then led the Chiefs to a win on the road against the top-seeded Baltimore Ravens in the AFC Championship to advance to Super Bowl LVIII, marking Mahomes' fourth Super Bowl appearance in five seasons.[209] The win marked Mahomes' 14th career playoff win, tying Terry Bradshaw, John Elway, and Peyton Manning for third place in quarterback playoff wins.[210] In the Super Bowl, Mahomes won his third Super Bowl MVP after throwing for 333 yards with two touchdowns, including the game-winning touchdown pass in overtime to Mecole Hardman, as the Chiefs defeated the San Francisco 49ers 25–22 in just the second Super Bowl in history to go to overtime.[211] Kansas City became the first team to repeat as Super Bowl champions since the New England Patriots nineteen years earlier and Mahomes became the third player with three Super Bowl MVPs.[212] With his victory in the Super Bowl, Mahomes earned his 15th postseason victory, moving into sole possession of third-most in NFL history, only behind Joe Montana and Tom Brady.[213] He was ranked fourth by his fellow players on the NFL Top 100 Players of 2024.[214] Mahomes and the Chiefs entered the 2024 season looking to become the first team to win three consecutive Super Bowl championships.[215] In the NFL Kickoff Game against the Ravens, Mahomes passed Len Dawson as the Chiefs' all-time passing yards leader in a 27–20 win.[216] In Week 3, Mahomes won his 77th regular season start in a victory against the Atlanta Falcons. With the win, Mahomes passed Tom Brady and Roger Staubach for most victories by a quarterback through their first 100 starts.[217] In Week 8 against the Las Vegas Raiders, Mahomes reached 30,000 career passing yards, doing so in just 103 regular season games. This was faster than any other quarterback in NFL history, surpassing the previous record of 109 games set by Matthew Stafford.[218] Mahomes helped lead the Chiefs to a 9–0 start, tying the best start to a season in franchise history.[219] In Week 11, the team suffered their first setback with a 30–21 loss to the Buffalo Bills.[220] Both records are Division I-FBS records. NFL College awards Other awards A former baseball pitcher and considered by some a dual-threat quarterback and the \"most talented player in the NFL\" due to his elusiveness in the pocket, arm strength, running ability, and athleticism despite being a pass-first quarterback,[241][242] Mahomes is also known for attempting and completing innovative throws, including no-look passes and behind-the-back tosses.[243] FiveThirtyEight also cites his unique and \"uncanny\" ability to know his receivers' timing and use his athleticism to fool defenders and get his receivers open.[241] Mahomes credits his years playing baseball with developing his arm strength while throwing the football.[244] Ahead of Super Bowl LVII, which was the first Super Bowl to feature two black starting quarterbacks as the Chiefs faced off against Jalen Hurts and the Philadelphia Eagles, Mahomes acknowledged that his creative playing style was inspired by that of Negro league baseball players, especially Satchel Paige, who likewise inspired his father's baseball playing style.[243] A number of defensive coordinators have cited Mahomes' ability to improvise as one of his key skills.[245] Since Mahomes' breakout 2018 season, NFL general managers and scouts have sought out prospects that can break out of designed plays. Number one overall draft picks Kyler Murray and Bryce Young are regarded as examples of this effect, with the two being highly touted prospects despite lacking traditional size for the position.[246] On September 1, 2020, Mahomes proposed to Brittany Matthews, his high school sweetheart, in a suite in Arrowhead Stadium, the day Mahomes received his Super Bowl LIV championship ring.[247] Matthews had a brief professional soccer career playing for Icelandic club UMF Afturelding and then became a certified personal trainer.[248] She is also a co-owner of the Kansas City Current, a women's professional soccer team.[249] The couple married on March 12, 2022.[250] They have two children: a daughter[251] and a son.[252] In July 2024, the couple announced they were expecting their third child.[253] Mahomes is an evangelical Christian.[254] His mother said he found his faith when he was in middle school, where he was involved with a youth group at his church.[255] Mahomes has said, \"Faith is huge for me ... Before every game, I walk the field and I do a prayer at the goalpost. I just thank God for those opportunities and I thank God for letting me be on a stage where I can glorify Him. The biggest thing that I pray for is that whatever happens, win or lose, success or failure, that I'm glorifying Him.\"[256] Mahomes is featured in the NFL Films and Netflix sports documentary series Quarterback, alongside other NFL quarterbacks Kirk Cousins and Marcus Mariota. All three players were filmed during the 2022 season on-and-off the field. The series premiered on Netflix on July 12, 2023. Mahomes' newly established 2PM Productions collaborated on producing the series.[257][258] Mahomes plays golf during the offseason.[259] He has participated in several celebrity tournaments, including the American Century Championship since 2020.[260] He participated in the 2022 edition of The Match alongside Josh Allen, losing to Tom Brady and Aaron Rodgers.[261] He also participated in the 2023 edition teaming up with his Chiefs teammate Travis Kelce against Golden State Warriors teammates Stephen Curry and Klay Thompson. Mahomes and Kelce won the match.[262] Following his 2018 MVP season, Mahomes received multiple endorsement deals. His first contract came from Hunt's upon revealing his love for ketchup.[263] In addition, he has signed endorsement deals with Oakley,[264] Essentia Water, Hy-Vee,[265] State Farm,[266] DirectTV,[267] Adidas,[268] and Head & Shoulders.[269] He also signed an endorsement contract with Helzberg Diamonds who released a line of necklaces featuring his logo.[270] He was named the cover athlete for Madden NFL 20, becoming the first Chiefs player to be on the cover.[271] He would be named the Madden cover athlete again, along with Tom Brady, two years later for Madden NFL 22. Mahomes and Brady are the first players to be named cover athlete twice.[272] In 2020, he signed an endorsement deal with sports drink maker BioSteel sports drinks.[273] He also became an equity partner in the company.[274] On August 16, 2021, he announced he would be releasing his own signature shoe as part of his endorsement deal with Adidas. The shoe was called the Mahomes 1 Impact FLX and was released on August 23.[275] In 2022, Mahomes appeared in a commercial for Coors Light. NFL rules prohibit players from endorsing alcohol products, so the product in the commercial was a Coors flashlight instead of beer.[276] In 2023, he appeared in commercials for cellphone provider T-Mobile.[277] Also in 2023, he signed an endorsement deal with the beverage manufacturer Prime.[278] In April 2019, Mahomes announced the establishment of a nonprofit organization called the 15 and the Mahomies Foundation.[279] The nonprofit's website states that it is \"dedicated to improving the lives of children\".[280] Following the murder of George Floyd by police officer Derek Chauvin, Mahomes, along with teammate Tyrann Mathieu and several other NFL players, made a video encouraging the NFL to condemn police brutality and violence against black people and to admit it was wrong to silence Colin Kaepernick and Eric Reid for their protests during the playing of the National Anthem.[281] Mahomes and Mathieu started a voter registration project in Kansas City. The project encouraged residents to register to vote in the 2020 presidential election. He worked with the Chiefs to encourage players to vote. He joined LeBron James' Rock the Vote initiative to encourage people to register and vote.[282] Mahomes was named to the Time 100 list of most influential people of 2020,[283] 2023,[284] and 2024.[285] In 2024, Mahomes donated $5 million to his alma mater, Texas Tech, to assist with stadium and football center projects.[286] In 2020, Mahomes joined the Kansas City Royals ownership group as a minority stakeholder.[287] In 2021, he joined Sporting Club, the ownership group of the Major League Soccer franchise Sporting Kansas City.[288] Mahomes is a member of an ownership group of an upcoming professional pickleball team based in Miami, Florida. The ownership group also includes Naomi Osaka, Nick Kyrgios, and Rich Paul.[289] Mahomes joined the ownership group of the NWSL's Kansas City Current in 2023. His wife has been a member of the ownership group since the team was established.[290] In 2023, Mahomes (as well as Travis Kelce) became an investor in the Alpine racing team of Formula One.[291] In 2021, Mahomes became an investor in a group to expand the Whataburger fast food restaurant franchise to Missouri and Kansas. The locations will primarily be in the Kansas City metropolitan area and the Wichita, Kansas metropolitan area, and multiple locations in between the cities.[292] In 2024, Mahomes, along with the rest of the ownership group of the Current, expressed interest in bringing a WNBA expansion franchise to Kansas City. They cited the success of the Current, the WNBA expanding to add teams in San Francisco, Portland, and Toronto by 2026, and the WNBA hoping to have 16 teams by 2028. The bid is likely to have competition from other cities like St. Louis and Philadelphia.[293][294]",

He plays the quarterback position. He is the son of former Major League Baseball (MLB) player Pat Mahomes. He played college football and college baseball at Texas Tech University, but quit baseball to focus on football more. He was selected in the first round of the 2017 NFL Draft. Mahomes spent his first season with the Chiefs as a backup to Alex Smith. He became the primary player in the 2018 season. In the same season, Mahomes threw for 5,097 yards, 50 touchdowns, and 12 interceptions. He had also thrown for over 5,000 yards in a college season, becoming the first player to throw more than 5,000 yards in college and the NFL. He also became the second player to throw for more than 5,000 yards and score 50 touchdowns in a season, with Peyton Manning being the first.[6] During the 2019–20 playoffs, Mahomes appeared in Super Bowl LIV, the Chiefs' first Super Bowl appearance in 50 years, where they beat the San Francisco 49ers.[7] Mahomes was awarded the Super Bowl MVP, the second African-American quarterback and youngest player to do so. Mahomes is known for his athleticism and his unique passing ability. Mahomes was born on September 17, 1995, in Tyler, Texas, to MLB player, Pat Mahomes and Randi Mahomes.[8] In high school, Mahomes played football, baseball, and basketball.[9] Playing football in his senior year, Mahomes he had 4,619 passing yards and 50 passing touchdowns.[10] In baseball, he threw a no-hitter with 16 strikeouts in a game.[10] He was selected in the 37th round of the 2014 MLB Draft by the Detroit Tigers, but did not sign a contract.[11]",

                "content": "The Montana State Bobcats football program competes in the Big Sky Conference of the NCAA's Division I Football Championship Subdivision for Montana State University. The program began in 1897 and has won three national championships (1956, 1976, and 1984). It is the only college football program in the nation to win national championships on three different levels of competition, NAIA, NCAA Division II, and NCAA Division I-AA (now FCS). Through the 2022 season, the Bobcats had played in 1,049 games with an all-time record of 525–492–32.[3] The first championship came in Montana State's last season in the Rocky Mountain Athletic Conference, which moved to NAIA in 1952. The national championship was the first ever for the RMAC and was also the first time the NAIA had a football champion. The Bobcats were members of the RMAC from 1917 to 1956, after being an independent from 1897 to 1916. MSC rejoined the NCAA (College Division) in 1957, and had one of its most successful runs as an independent from 1957 to 1962 with six straight winning seasons, including an 8–2 mark in 1957 and 8–1 in 1958. In 1963, Montana State became a charter member of the Big Sky Conference and has since won two national championships.[4] Montana State has won 21 conference titles, including 16 in the Big Sky Conference and five in the Rocky Mountain Athletic Conference. The Bobcats have won conference titles in eight of the past nine decades and have won multiple conference titles in seven of the last eight decades. MSU finished the 1926 season undefeated in RMAC conference games, but was not awarded a conference title. They have qualified for the NCAA playoffs thirteen times, once (1976) as a Division II member and twelve times (1984, 2002, 2003, 2010, 2011, 2012, 2014, 2018, 2019, 2021, 2022, and 2023) as a Division I-AA/FCS member. Through the 2023 season, the Bobcats are 18–13–2 in postseason play.[5] Their primary rival are the Montana Grizzlies, whom they meet in the annual Brawl of the Wild, more commonly referred to as the Cat-Griz game by MSU students, alumni and supporters.[6] Before World War II, Montana State football tasted success often, but in small doses. The Bobcats did not record a winning season between 1931 and 1941, MSC's last pre-war squad. The 'Cats were 1–10 in that stretch against Montana, and were shut out for eight consecutive years. In 1946, however, things began to change. Composed of war-hardened veterans, Clyde Carpenter and the Bobcats rolled up a 5–3–1 regular season record, impressive enough to land the team its first-ever bowl bid. The Bobcats tied New Mexico, 13–13. Although it would be seven more seasons until Montana State would again win more than it lost, that season helped chart the course into what would become an unbelievably successful period in Montana State's football history as the Bobcats would take 22 of the next 30 games from 1956 to 1985 from the Grizzlies and would win all three of their national championships during that same span.[citation needed] The 1946 team was special for more than its accomplishments, however. When it reassembled following World War II, its special mission was to carry the Bobcat banner after 14 members of Montana State's previous team, the 1941 squad, were killed during World War II. The only pre-war regular to play in the Harbor Bowl was Bill Zupan, whose brother Al was among those 'Cat gridders making the ultimate sacrifice. Others were Orin Beller, Newell Berg,[7][8] Dana Bradford, John Burke, Bernard Cluzen, William Coey, Karl Fye, John Hall, Joseph McGeever, John Phelan, Richard Roman, Wendell Scabad and Alton Zempel, according to the outstanding centennial history of MSU, \"In the People's Interest\". In 1956, the Bobcats, led by freshman captain and two-way (center and middle linebacker) starter Sonny Holland, won a share of the NAIA title at the Aluminum Bowl in Little Rock, Arkansas, playing to a scoreless tie with the Pumas of St. Joseph's College from Rensselaer, Indiana. The game was nationally aired on CBS television and radio. It was played on a rain-soaked field that thwarted MSU's offense, which had run for an average of 323.1 yards rushing and 31.2 points per game. The championship was the first for the Rocky Mountain Athletic Conference and the 1956 Montana State football team is a member of the RMAC Hall of Fame. The 1956 Bobcats of head coach Tony Storti were the fourth, and last, Montana State football team to go undefeated. The game is the only blemish on the record of the team as it finished at 9–0–1.[citation needed] Behind head coach Jim Sweeney in 1964, Montana State won the NCAA Western Regional College Division Championship, which existed from 1964 to 1972, with a 28–7 win over Sacramento State in what was also known as the Camellia Bowl. The NCAA Western Regional was one of four regionals that led up to the selection of the NCAA College Division champion by poll. However, neither MSU nor any of the other regional winners—Northern Iowa (Midwest), Middle Tennessee State (Mideast), or East Carolina (East)—were awarded the national championship. That distinction went in split fashion to Los Angeles State (UPI/Coaches) and Wittenberg (AP). Upon the establishment of Division II in 1973, a full playoff system was introduced to determine the national champion. MSU is one of three Big Sky Conference schools, along with Boise State and North Dakota, to win a Camellia Bowl game. The Bobcats finished the 1964 season at 7–4.[citation needed] Montana State won the 1976 NCAA Division II championship at the Pioneer Bowl in Wichita Falls, Texas, beating the Akron Zips 24–13. The Bobcats were led by head coach Sonny Holland and sophomore quarterback Paul Dennehy. MSU led 17–0 in the third quarter before Akron cut the lead to 17–13. Running back Tom Kostrba scored from seven yards out in the fourth quarter to seal the win.[9] The Bobcats advanced to the championship game with a 17–16 quarterfinal win over the New Hampshire in Bozeman. The extra-point attempt to tie the game with seven minutes remaining missed wide right, and the remainder of the game was scoreless.[10] That was followed by a 10–3 semifinal win in the Grantland Rice Bowl over North Dakota State, after trailing 3–0 at halftime on the road in Fargo.[11] Kostrba ran for 100 yards in both playoff games and Don Ueland ran for 94 in the championship game. Montana State finished the 1976 season with ten consecutive wins and a 12–1 record; the lone loss at Fresno State came in September. Eight years later, the Bobcats defeated Louisiana Tech 19–6 in the Division I-AA Championship Game in Charleston, South Carolina, for their third national championship. Led by second-year head coach Dave Arnold, MSU was seeded third in the twelve-team playoffs, which meant a first-round bye and a home game in the quarterfinals, in which the Bobcats rallied from a 0–14 deficit to eliminate Arkansas State 31–14. In the semifinals, also in Bozeman, Montana State trailed second-seeded Rhode Island 12–20 entering the fourth quarter, then scored twenty unanswered points to win 32–20. MSU took the lead on a 97-yard interception return for a touchdown by safety Joe Roberts Jr. Quarterback Kelly Bradley threw for over 300 yards in each playoff game and had eight touchdown passes in the postseason. Tight end Joe Bignell hauled in 10 passes for 130 yards and two touchdowns in the championship game.[12] After a 2–2 start, the Bobcats won ten straight to end at 12–2 in 1984,[13] which followed a 1–10 season in 1983,[14] and preceded a 2–9 record in 1985. Montana State holds the distinction of being the only college football program with national championships in three levels of college football.[15] The Bobcats of head coach Tony Storti claimed a share of the 1956 NAIA title when it finished in a scoreless tie with St. Joseph's (Indiana). In 1976, Sonny Holland's MSU team downed Akron 24–13 for the NCAA Division II championship, and the Bobcats won the NCAA Division I-AA (FCS) championship in 1984 under Dave Arnold with a 19–6 win over Louisiana Tech.[16][17] In the history of college football, including the NAIA, there have been just 11 quarterbacks that have gone over 10,000 yards passing and 1,000 yards rushing for their career. Two of those quarterbacks were produced by Montana State. Travis Lulay accomplished the feat in 2005 when he finished with 10,746 passing and 1,459 rushing. DeNarius McGhee hit those milestones on consecutive weeks in 2013 when he went over 1,000 rushing against Northern Arizona, then hit 10,000 passing against Weber State. He finished his career with 1,133 yards rushing and 11,203 yards passing.[18] Both quarterbacks began playing their freshman season at Montana State. Lulay started the sixth game of his freshman year against Idaho State. After a 2–4 start, he led the Bobcats to the Big Sky regular season championship and their first trip to the playoffs in 18 years. McGhee started the first game of his frosh season and has only missed two games – both in his senior year. He led MSU to Big Sky titles and the FCS playoffs the first three years of his career. MSU is one of just three schools to have repeat winners of the Buck Buchanan Award, which is given out annually by The Sports Network to the most outstanding defensive player in the Football Championship Subdivision.[citation needed] In 2012 Caleb Schreibeis became the first Bobcat to win the award followed by Brad Daly in 2013. Both players manned the defensive end (Bandit) position for MSU and racked up big numbers playing in defensive line coach Bo Beck's system. The two players took completely different routes to the award as Schreibeis, a walk-on out of Billings West, didn't get on the list until the last week of the season and Daly, a highly touted prospect out of Helena Capital, was on the list all season.[citation needed] On November 17, 2018, at approximately 3:19 in the afternoon at Washington-Grizzly Stadium in Missoula with Montana State clinging to a 29–25 lead after rallying from a 22–0 deficit and rival Montana sitting within one foot of the Bobcats goal line with 14 seconds to play, defensive tackle Tucker Yates of Colstrip, Mont. jarred the ball loose from UM's Adam Eastwood and Grant Collins of Bozeman, Mont. sent the ball rolling into the UM backfield where Derek Marks of Belgrade, Mont. pounced on the ball to seal the win for the Bobcats. MSU's other defensive tackle Chase Benson of Helena, Mont. knocked his man so far into the UM backfield that Eastwood had to alter his course causing him to collide with Yates. Bobcat fans have since referred to the play as The Stuff or The Montana Stuff in reference to the four Montana natives who played key roles in the play. Earlier in the quarter Collins had forced and recovered a fumble in UM territory to set up the go-ahead touchdown. The Bobcats trailed by 15 points in the fourth quarter and outscored the Grizzlies 29–3 after falling behind 22–0. The overall comeback is the greatest in Cat-Griz Game history and the fourth quarter comeback matched the comeback from a 24–9 deficit by the 1968 Bobcats, which ended in a 29–24 win over UM. Montana State has won 22 (five in the Rocky Mountain Athletic Conference (per RMAC website); 17 in the Big Sky Conference) conference championships through the 2024 season.[19] † Co-champions ‡ Montana and Montana State tied for the 2011 championship, which Montana subsequently vacated[20] NCAA Division I FCS playoff results (known as \"Division I-AA\" from 1978 through 2005) Montana State is 15–12 all time in the FCS playoffs and has won the national championship once, in 1984. The Brawl of the Wild is the game between MSU and their primary rival, the University of Montana Grizzlies. Both teams play for The Great Divide Trophy. As of 2016, Montana holds a healthy 73–42–5 lead in the series, but the series has been tight since 1956 with UM holding just a 33–32 lead; however, there was a notable losing record in the 1990s where MSU failed to win a single game. The series has three distinct periods. From 1897 to 1916 the teams didn't belong to a conference and at times would play twice per year. Early seasons had seven games or less with one season seeing the Grizzlies play just one game. Four of the five ties in the series came during this era. Montana won 12 games to Montana State's 7. In 1917 Montana State joined the Rocky Mountain Athletic Conference and in 1924 Montana joined the Pacific Coast Conference, the predecessor of today's Pac-12. The RMAC included several teams that would become Mountain West members. When MSU joined the RMAC it included Colorado, Colorado State, Utah, Utah State, and Brigham Young. The RMAC would drop down to the small college division of NCAA football in 1939 and remained there until 1952 when it joined the NAIA. UM joined the PCC after spending 22 years as part of the Northwest Intercollegiate Athletic Association with league members Washington, Oregon, Washington State, Oregon State, Idaho and Wittman College in 1924. By then the PCC included Stanford, California, UCLA, USC, Oregon, Oregon State, Washington, Washington State, and Idaho. The Bobcats remained in the RMAC through 1956, while the Grizzlies continued in the PCC through 1949 and joined the Skyline (aka Mountain States) Conference, which also competed in the NCAA University (large) Division, from 1951 to 1961. MSU was a NAIA independent from 1957 to 1962 and UM was an NCAA University Division (large) independent in 1950 and 1962. During this period UM enjoyed a 30–8–1 edge in Cat-Griz games. Both schools entered the Big Sky Conference as charter members in 1963 with Montana holding a 42–15–2 series lead, but the Bobcats winning five of the previous seven. From 1963 to 1985 Montana State enjoyed its most successful period of the Cat-Griz rivalry. MSU won 17 games to just six for UM. Following that Montana started \"The Streak\" when it won 16 straight games from 1986 to 2001. MSU ended the drought by winning three of four, MSU (as of 2022) leads the series 10–9 * after \"The Streak.\" The Big Sky era shows Montana with a 31–28 lead. Since MSU won its first national championship in 1956, the series shows UM with a 33–32 edge. Prior to that UM had a 40–10–5 advantage. The Bobcats play their home games at Bobcat Stadium, located at the south end of campus in Bozeman. The stadium and area around the stadium have been under vast renovations and improvements with approximately $14.3 million invested over the past five years. In 2013, the stadium's parking lots were paved, landscaped, and had lighting installed to enhance the pre-game tailgating experience. During and following the 2011 season, stadium lighting was added and its first night game was in 2012 against Chadron State on Thursday, August 30. MSU renovated the south end zone in 2011, adding 5,277 seats to bring the official seating capacity to 17,777. The Cat-Griz game against Montana in 2022 set a stadium record with an attendance of 22,047. The new end zone seating holds over 7,200 fans. Included in the 2011 upgrades were an 18' x 37' LED video board, two scoreboards, and sound system. In 2008, the natural grass playing surface was replaced with FieldTurf. In the late fall of 2011, Montana State raised funds for stadium lighting in order to extend the hours it can practice and play night games. Seven light standards were erected around the stadium. MSU currently has plans to renovate the east grandstand to include matching sky suites of the west grandstand and erect seating in the north end zone. These additions would increase seating capacity to approximately 24,000. Fund-raising isn't expected to go public until 2015. Prior to the 2011 addition, Bobcat Stadium was renovated in 1997 when the west grandstand was removed and replaced with a new grandstand with luxury sky suites, indoor stadium seating, press box, and club room. The north bleachers were also removed at this time and replaced with locker rooms for visitors, game officials, and an auxiliary locker room for the Bobcats. The name of the stadium was changed from Reno H. Sales Stadium to Bobcat Stadium at this time. The stadium capacity dropped from 15,000 to 12,500 due to the reconfiguration. Reno H. Sales Stadium was erected in 1973 and replaced Gatton Field. Through the 1971 football season, the Bobcats played home games for four decades at Gatton Field. It was located directly south of the Romney Gym, across Grant Street and northeast of the Brick Breeden Fieldhouse, which opened in 1957. The playing field ran east–west and had lighting as far back as the 1940s.[21] It was razed in early 1972 and is the site of the Marga Hosaeus Fitness Center, opened in 1973. Bobcat Stadium is approximately a half mile (0.8 km) due south. The field was named for Cyrus J. Gatton (1894–1918), a former Montana State football player from 1913 to 1916. A native of Iowa who was raised in Bozeman, Gatton enlisted in the U.S. Army Air Service during World War I and was killed while flying for the French on November 4, 1918, just a week before the Armistice. The class of 1917 voted in 1920 that when the school built a new football field it should be named for Cyrus Gatton, and the request was honored ten years later. MSU played its 1972 season at Bozeman High School's Van Winkle Stadium, with expanded temporary seating.[22] Despite the temporary relocation, the Bobcats still won the Big Sky Conference title that season. Montana State has seen 29 players receive First Team All-America recognition, with 22 of those earning consensus All-America status based on being selected to the first team of three or more recognized All-America teams. In 1954, Jim Argeris became the first player selected as a first team All-America. Center Sonny Holland is the only three-time honoree and running back Don Hass the only two-time honoree. MSU had seven first team selections from 2009 to 2012, which is the most of any four-year span in school history. In 2012 quarterback DeNarius McGhee, outside linebacker Jody Owens, and defensive end Caleb Schreibeis were selected to one or more of the various 2012 All-America first teams. McGhee is the first quarterback, Owens is the third linebacker, and Schreibeis the fifth defensive end in MSU history to receive the honor. 2012 marked the second time that MSU has had three All-America selections in one season. The other time it occurred was when 1984's national championship team saw defensive end Mark Fellows, punter Dirk Nelson, and offensive tackle Bill Schmidt selected. In 2013, Brad Daly became the seventh defensive lineman to earn All-America status. Daly joined Bill Kollar, Les Leininger, Mark Fellows, Neal Smith, Dane Fletcher, and Caleb Schreibeis. Daly also joined punter Matthew Peot as the only unanimous All-America selections in school history. (*)unanimous selection Sonny Holland is considered the greatest Bobcat football player in school history. The Butte native joined the program in 1956, and starting at center as a true freshman, helped lead Montana State to its first national title when it tied St. Joseph's in the first NAIA championship game 0–0. He would earn first team All-America honors in 1957, 1958 and 1959 and is the only MSU player to do so three times. As a player, his teams never lost to rival Montana beating the Grizzlies 33–14, 22–13, 20–6, and 40–6, with Holland manning both the center and middle linebacker positions in most of those games. Holland returned to MSU as an assistant coach and became the head coach in 1971. After a disappointing 2–7–1 first season that included his only loss to Montana as a player or head coach, he went on to finish .500 or better in each of the next six years, and set a school record with 47 wins. After a humiliating 30–0 loss to UM in 1971, Holland's teams rattled off wins of 21–3, 33–7, 43–29, 20–3, 21–12, and 24–19 against their rivals. The highlight of his coaching career was the 1976 team, which won the NCAA Division II national championship with a 24–13 victory over the Akron Zips. In 11 games against Montana as a player and head coach Holland went 10–1 outscoring the Grizzlies 277–142. Holland's No. 52 football jersey is one of four retired by Montana State University. A running back from 1964 to 1967 nicknamed the Iron Tumbleweed, Don Hass is one of only two players in MSU history to receive first team All-America status twice, and is the only MSU player to be named a first team NCAA All-America twice. Hass set the game (298), season (1,460), and career (2,954) rushing records for the Bobcats during his four years. His 298 yards in a single game in 1966 against Weber State is still the top single game performance in school history. While that game stands out, his best performances were against the Grizzlies. He led them to wins in 1965 and 1966. In 1965, he ran for 100 yards for the first time in his career, and finished with 129 yards in a 24–7 win. In 1966 he ran for 142 yards in a 38–0 rout in Missoula. He ran for a Cat-Griz record 209 yards against Montana in 1967, leading the Bobcats to a 14–8 win. All told he had 480 yards rushing in three games against Montana, all wins. The Montana State football jersey with number 21 is retired in his honor and hangs inside Bobcat Stadium. Dennis Erickson was a MSU quarterback from 1966 to 1968. He was also a head coach in college and professional football from 1982 to 2011. In 1968, Erickson engineered the greatest comeback, in what is considered by many as the most exciting game in the Cat-Griz series. In all, 34 points were scored in the final quarter. Erickson, flanker Ron Bain, and running back Paul Schafer led the comeback, as the Bobcats clinched a tie for the Big Sky championship—their third straight. Bain's brother, Doug of the Grizzlies, gave Montana a 17–9 lead early in the quarter on a pass from Ray Brum. After another UM touchdown made the score 24–9 with just over 10 minutes to go it looked as if the Grizzlies would win going away, but the Bobcats weren't done. Schaefer scored on a short run with 8:15 to play and Erickson hit Bain for a touchdown with five minutes left cutting the lead to two at 24–22. The Grizzlies appeared to have the winning drive stopped at the MSU 32, but a facemask penalty gave the Cats new life on the 17. Scoring 20 points in the last nine minutes, Montana State won 29–24 when Schafer, who had 58 carries for 234 yards in the game, dove into the end zone with 12 seconds left. After Schafer's go-ahead touchdown with 12 seconds to play, the Grizzlies nearly spoiled things for MSU. After a touchback on the kickoff, UM takes over at the 20 with speedy receiver Ron Baines at quarterback. He gains 15, and another 15 are tacked on by an unnecessary roughness penalty to stop the clock with three seconds to go. Baines then makes a circus run of 37 yards from midfield before he's dragged down at the MSU 13 after time expires. Bobcat QB Dennis Erickson was the difference. \"Erickson killed us,\" UM head coach Jack Swarthout said. Erickson led Montana State to three straight (1966, 1967, 1968) Big Sky Conference championships, and a spot in the 1966 College Division Western Regional (Camellia Bowl), where the Bobcats lost to the San Diego State Aztecs 28–7. He went on to coach the Miami Hurricanes to two NCAA Division I-A national championships. He also had college head coaching stints with the Idaho Vandals, Wyoming Cowboys, Washington State Cougars, Oregon State Beavers and Arizona State Sun Devils. Professionally, he was the head coach of the NFL's Seattle Seahawks and San Francisco 49ers. One Montana State Bobcat has been inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame: Jan Stenerud. After coming to MSU from Norway on a ski jumping scholarship, Stenerud starred on the varsity team, having a then-NCAA record 59-yard field goal against rival Montana in 1965. Stenerud scored 82 points as a senior in 1965. He was drafted by the Kansas City Chiefs in the third round of the AFL's 1966 draft. In 1970, he kicked a then-Super Bowl record 48-yard field goal in Kansas City's 23–7 Super Bowl IV win. He would later go on to play for the Green Bay Packers and Minnesota Vikings earning seven All-Pro and three All-AFL selections, and four trips to the Pro Bowl in his 19 seasons as a professional. He was inducted in 1991 as the first pure kicker in the Pro Football Hall of Fame. Stenerud's name is in the Kansas City Chiefs' ring of honor, and he is one of just four MSU players to have his number, \"78\" retired. Six Montana State graduates have played in a Super Bowl. The most recent is Mike Person. Dane Fletcher, who was a linebacker for the New England Patriots, in Super Bowl XLVI. The first was Stenerud in Super Bowl IV, followed by Ron East, who played defensive tackle the following year in Super Bowl V for the Dallas Cowboys. Sam McCullum was a wide receiver for the Minnesota Vikings in Super Bowl IX against the Oakland Raiders. Running back Tony Boddie played in Super Bowl XXII for the Denver Broncos. Travis Jonsen earned a Super Bowl ring as a practice squad player for Tampa Bay. In 2011, quarterback Travis Lulay was named the Most Outstanding Player in the Canadian Football League and led the British Columbia Lions to the Grey Cup title, garnering the game's Most Valuable Player award in the 34–23 win over Winnipeg. The Lions started the season 0–5 before winning 13 of their last 15 games to win the championship. Lulay threw for a league-high 32 touchdowns and passed for 4,815 yards to finish with the second best passer rating in the CFL. He also ran for 391 yards (8.3 per carry), which was good for 12th in the CFL and was the most by a quarterback. Lulay was the quarterback at MSU from 2002 to 2005 leading the Bobcats to three Big Sky Conference titles and two NCAA Division I-AA playoff appearances. All three Big Sky Conference championships were taken in the last game of the season with wins over rival Montana. As a true freshman, Lulay engineered MSU's 10–7 win over the Grizzlies in Missoula, ending UM's 16-game winning streak over the Bobcats, and was named the Big Sky Conference's Newcomer of the Year. Lulay led Montana State in rushing his senior year with 611 yards. He left with school records for career passing yards (10,746–11th in NCAA Division I-AA history), single-season total offense, and total offense in a career. He graduated with a 3.91 GPA. He played briefly for the Seattle Seahawks and New Orleans Saints of the NFL and also played in the NFL Europa for two seasons. In 1974 Kollar became the first small college (non-FBS) player to win the Senior Bowl MVP, and is one of only two (Portland State's Neil Lomax being the other) small college players to win the award in that game's history. Kollar became one of just four Big Sky Conference players ever selected as an NFL first round draft choice when he was taken by the Cincinnati Bengals in 1974. He went on to play eight seasons in the NFL, including five with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. He has been an NFL defensive line coach since 1990 and currently coaches in that capacity for the Denver Broncos. He is a member of the Senior Bowl and MSU Hall of Fames, and his number \"77\" is one of only four football numbers retired by MSU. Don Haas, Holland and Stenerud are the others. Following the completion of the 2012 NCAA FCS regular season, Schreibeis was named the winner of Buck Buchanan Award given annually by The Sports Network to the most outstanding defensive player in the FCS. It was the first such distinction for a Montana State player. He was also a consensus All-America in 2012, the 20th Bobcat to attain that status. Schreibeis came to Montana State as a walk-on in 2008, and after red-shirting for one season, eventually worked his way into a starting position for one game as a sophomore in 2010. He became a full-time starter in 2011 and was selected as an honorable mention to the All-Big Sky team. The 2012 season was a breakout campaign for Schreibeis. In 10 regular-season games, the team captain collected 51 tackles and led the Big Sky with 12 sacks. He ranked first on his team in tackles for loss (14.5), quarterback hurries (seven) and forced fumbles (seven), which was also the top mark in the nation. The Bobcats also won their third straight Big Sky Conference title that season. Brad Daly garnered the 2013 Buck Buchanan Award and the FCS Athletics Directors Association Award, and is perhaps the best pure pass rusher in MSU history. Along with the two defensive player of the year awards, he was also a finalist for the Ted Hendricks Award, given to the best defensive end in all divisions of college football. He finished fifth in the final voting. He made an immediate impact as a true-freshman, despite playing sparingly, as he recorded two sacks and blocked two kicks, leaving observers to speculate that he would have a great career. Daly left football after that season, only to return a year later with a renewed vigor. In his sophomore year, he proved his worth by leading the Big Sky Conference with 12.5 sacks as a situational pass rusher. As a junior he became a full-time defensive end, but suffered a severely sprained ankle, and dropped to just 5.5 sacks. A year later he bounced back, despite nagging injuries, to lead the nation in sacks with 14 sacks and 20.5 tackles for loss. For his career Daly finished with 34 sacks. He was also a unanimous first team All-America selection and the Big Sky Conference defensive player of the year as a senior. He was voted a team captain prior to his senior season, joining his father J and brother Bobby as MSU team captains and All-Americans. Bobby Daly was sixth in the 2007 Buck Buchanan Award voting. Two Montana State Bobcats have been inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame; Jan Stenerud. After coming to MSU from Norway on a ski jumping scholarship, Stenerud starred on the varsity team with a then-NCAA record 59-yard field goal against rival Montana and 82 points scored as a senior in 1965. He was drafted by the Kansas City Chiefs in the third round of the AFL's 1966 draft. Stenerud scored 11 points, including a then-Super Bowl record 48-yard field goal, in Kansas City's 23–7 Super Bowl IV win in 1970. He would later go on to play for the Green Bay Packers and Minnesota Vikings earning four trips to the Pro Bowl in his 19 seasons as a professional. He was inducted in 1991 and is one of only two pure kickers in the Pro Football Hall of Fame, the other being Morten Andersen. Stenerud's name is in the Kansas City Chiefs' ring of honor and he is one of just four MSU players to have his number \"78\" retired. William Wallace \"Bill\" Kollar. Wilson was elected to the Canadian Football Hall of Fame on September 20, 1997, following a long career as an offensive lineman with the British Columbia Lions. The guard and center was awarded All-Western All-Star and All-Canadian All-Star honors for seven years, 1975–81. He was voted the Schenley Most Outstanding Offensive Lineman in 1977. He played in two Grey Cup games (1983 and 1985), and was a key member of B.C.'s 1985 championship team. Wylie was elected to the Canadian Football Hall of Fame on May 24, 1980. The former Bobcat All-America was a standout defensive back and kick return specialist for nine years with Calgary. He played for the Calgary Stampeders from 1956 to 1964, and for five straight years was an All-Western All-Star and twice was an All-Canadian All-Star.

                "content": "Montana's Best Country One of the best lines of any show comes from Andy on The Office during the final episode when he says the following: \"I wish there was a way to know you're in the good old days before you've actually left them.\" I've thought about that a lot lately, especially when it comes to Montana State Football. This has been a season that folks will talk about for years to come. An undefeated regular season (first in the history of the program) and now we're one win away from heading back to Frisco, Texas for the National Championship Game. While we certainly don't want to look past Saturday's game against South Dakota, it's hard not to think about playing in the big game. With four teams remaining, we are down to the best of the best. Saturday's game at Bobcat Stadium will no doubt be action-packed as the 4th-seeded Coyotes come to take on the number-one-seed Bobcats. So far, the Cats have looked like the team to beat, but as you know, in College Football, in the Playoffs, anything can happen. The truth is, these are the good old days. We're in the middle of them right now. We have a Head Coach who will no doubt be in demand for bigger programs. We have a Quarterback who is not only a great athlete, but a great person. We have a team that plays together, believes in each other, and is determined to bring a Natty back to Bozeman. Then there is Bobcat Nation. Sure, there are bigger schools with bigger fan bases. But the passion and the love that MSU fans show for this team rival any of those big-time schools. Oh, and it's not just some local saying that. Remember a couple of years back when ESPN Gameday came to town? They went on the record saying their favorite stop that year was Bozeman, Montana. So while most of Montana will be cheering for the Bobcats this Saturday, take the time to enjoy every minute of this, because this is the stuff we'll tell our kids and grandkids about one day. Go Cats! Gallery Credit: Will Gordon Gallery Credit: Sophia Crisafulli",
